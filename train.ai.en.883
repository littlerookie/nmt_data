it should have been me...
I'll talk with you tommorow. - Okay.
Bye, Tom. - Goodbye.
Bye, Hillary. - Nice meeting you.
you too, bye.
I just had a very nice bonding moment with Melissa.
can I ask you a favor? - Sure.
my mother and grandmother are coming in to town tomorrow,
and I have so much to plan...
I was wondering if you and the boys could entertain Colin for the day.
entertain him? - Yeah, just kind of get to know him and stuff.
sure. - Cool.
so are you more proud of "Scotch Tape" or McDonald's?
I think they're both american.
so wait, you invited this guy to play ball with us? - Yeah, he's the competition.
I need to get to know his strengths and weaknesses.
I like his green shirts. Is that like a poly blend kind of thing?
Yeah, it's my shirt - It's your shirt? - Yeah.
looks good on him, huh? - Yeah, real good.
why don't you play with him?
Thanks.
Colin, have you ever played basketball before?
we would call this "netball," back in Scotland, it's more of a woman's game, so, no I don't have much experience.
Hi, I do. Need one more? - We're good.
alright.
alright, "girls," you ready? - Yeah, I am.
Oh. Use your hands.
you alright there? - Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm open. I'm open. - Here we go.
you gotta hold on to the ball, man! Hold on to the ball.
Homos! Homos! Homos.

you wanna start a game cause you didn't get that.
there you go. Open. Open.

I like it! - I'm sorry.
come on! - Get on the path.

OK, basket. Put it in the basket! Put it in the basket!
you know what I'm learning? The guy's a chump.
Yeah.
wow, "Fault." - There it is. That's it.
that's it! That's it! We got it now.
Hey, I look good now, don't I?
here we go.
put it in the basket!
in the basket! - Take a shot, chief!
sorry, guys. - Did you see that?
probably not allowed to just stuff it in like that.
he dunks the ball. - Sorry. Sorry.
he dunks the ball...
that was awsome! You can dunk! He can dunk! That is awsome.
if that's allowed, why don't you guys all do it?
if we could, we would. Right?

Yes! - Good game, yeah, good game.

I love this guy!
shit.
you alright? - Yeah.
what happening?
my boy's got mad cow disease.
we have got to get some dirt on this guy.
I got a guy I use when a spouse suspect infedility.
everybody's got skeletons in the closet. Nobody is skweeky-clean, - and my guy's the best. - I don't know, it just seems so cheep.
don't worry, I'll charge you dubble because you're rich.
I mean, it's a cheep thing to do.
he play's cheep, you gotta match that. - How does Colin play cheep?
that whole thing with Hannah, being scottish.
making her fall in love with him in Scotland.
that "monster thing" of his.
fine. Get the dirt.
that's cool.

what's he gonna do, eat her?
come on, come on. Take a breath. Take a...
Thanks, Tom.
Yeah, have a great flight. - Right. Thanks, mate.
come on...
I love you, Colin. - Bye.
Bye.
yeah... - My God.
need some chap stick? - Yeah...
so... What church should we go to?
Grace's Church.
thank you so much for coming with me to meet the reverend.
no problem. - He is the sweetest man...
yeah? - Yeah.
he married my parents and insisted on coming to Scotland to do my wedding.
why didn't Colin stay and do this with you?
it was more important for him to go back to Scotland to pertition
the Grand Counsil so Colin and I could get married.
I don't know. Grand? What does that mean?
I'm not Scottish and his family is kind of...
what?
royalty.
royalty?
royalty? Is he like a King? - No! No, he's a Duke.
a Duke?
Hannah, darling. - Reverend Foote.
and this must be the lucky young man who is marrying our beautiful Hannah.
Oh, no.
I'm not marrying him - No...
this is Tom, my "Maid Of Honor."
maid of Honor? - Yes.
how about that...
we have many gay and lesbian members of the congregation.
welcome.
thank you. - Thank you, Reverend.
so...
let's talk about the wedding. - Okay.
I need to get some details about you and...
Colin. - Colin, yes.
I want to work it in to the ceremony.
okay. It was such a whirl wind. Really...
Yes, enlighten me. Tell me about it.
Hannah, darling.
Hannah, I think it's important to dig deep her for the vowes and tell the Reverend all you know about Colin.
all that you love about him. - Okay.
and not just the obvious stuff, but those unique characteristics that are Colin.
those things that make you laugh and say...
that's so Colin."
right...
and then, maybe you could get some information from Colin...
and emphasize their unique bond, their shared history.
off course.
we could talk about love at first sight.
well, that's always a crowd pleaser, but...
Hannah... Elaborate...
tell me more about him. How you feel about him.
where did you meet?
in Scotland... - Modigliani!
your first summer in New York City, you were dating a guy who worked on Wall Street...
and he asked you to move in with him and you weren't quite sure...
and it was right around that time that you "discovered" Modigliani...
and became obsessed with this painting...
of this woman who had this blue scarf on, holding a baby.
and Hannah said: "That painting captured the essens of that woman better than any photograph."
I can't believe you can remember that.
I also remembered that she freaked, because she said she felt more passionate about that painting than she did obut "Mr. Wall Street..."
and she wondered if she could ever meet somebody that could make her feel this passionate as that work of art.
that's good.
that's good.
Modigliani.
now I know why you picked him to be "Maid of Honor."
yes...
come on! Who's ready to loose some money tonight! Because I'm feeling lucky!
you guys are late. How you doing?
how you holding up, champ? - Stressed.
what the hell is this?
Hannah's shower's in the morning . - Well where are we gonna play?
we're not gonna play until these baskets get done, and everything else gets done.
what about this party mix? - That's "pot-pourri."
this is perfect...
come on Felix, take that off... - Have you ever had one of these?
that's funny... - You can't even see.
you'll have to, to sleep with you...
take this. - You could be like blinded.
no, I'm not playing with baskets. It's poker night.
you put "Bayberry" with "Serenidade."
you don't like? - No, it's interesting.
just thought it was obvious that "Bayberry" worked best with "Harmony."
Really? I've been putting "Bayberry" with "Tahitian Sunrise."
that I like. That's Zen. - Yeah.
you know what I like? I like how you put the batball right in the center.
I like that so much that I'm gonna see you ball and raise you another ball.
that's a good idea. We should definetely have 2 balls...
Yeah. Do another ball. - Hey, Dennis...
come and curl some ribbon.
I can feel my sperm dying inside of me, one at a time.
shut up and grab a basket. Come on, it's fun.
I'm going to a strip club to eat some meat.
then I'm gonna get into a fight.
call me when you find your balls, Tom.
alright, tuff guy.
or maybe they're in the basket, next to the "Tahitian Sunrise."
someone's afraid of his feminin side...
look at that... Nice job with the fluffing.
look at that.
perfect. Perfect. - What is that, my friends.
look at us. - Come on.
can't loose. - Good work, huh?
hello ladies. You look lovely today.
Tom! - Oh, Hillary. How are you?
good. Everything looks wonderful.
this is the best shower I've ever been to.
Really? You think so?
you know what, Hillary? You should really eat something.
no, Tom. I'm fine.
fine. I'm okay.
what you ladies would go through to fit in to a dress...
this pretty much blows your rule out of the water about no women allowed at your place.
what good is a rule if you don't break it every now and then?
I'm very, very impressed. Thank you.
listen to that.
gay Gordon's party remix, just for you.
hear the horn.
it's good isn't it? - No.
let me turn it up there... It's...
it's a little loud... - What?
it's a little loud! - Okay. There you go.
look at this. Try this. Haggis pink.
it's pepper, cheese, chopped up baby lam lung, and cow petuitary gland.
how are you? - ...
it's a Scottish delicacy. Colin recomended it.
ladies, ladies. Look...
what just came, for Hannah.
it's from Colin, everyone.
Oh wait. There's a card. There's a card, a card...
for: "Hannah."
Hannah, my love, this is the ekstremely rare Scottish floral budwissel."
this?
they only bloom for 4 hours before they die.
he must have timed this out perfectly...
Oh my gosh, when we first met, Colin promised that he would rome at the countryside to find me one, and he did.
sweetheart, that's the must romantic thing I ever heard.
thanks mom.
Joan, good to see you. It's been too long.
Easter, wasn't it?
Yes. You slept with our maid.
she told you? I didn't know she spoke English.
yes...
this is grandmom Pearl. You remember Tom?
how are you? - Oh, yes, the fornicator.
that's right.
okay... - Tom, this is awsome.
it's great. - Good. Thank you.
this is even better than my sister's shower.
Oh, really? - Ahem...
everything seems to be doing well. Yes?
Sharon would like to know where to set up.
who? - The entertainment...
Ah, yes... I mean good. She should set up over there.
hello everybody. Hi, I'm Sharon. Good to see you all.
Yeah, come on, right down the front.
this was my idea, you know?
I know how much you loved her from Stephanie's sister's shower...
before we start, I would like for us all to take in a deep breath...
she wasn't at the shower...
she wasn't? - No.
and now exhale slowly... - Really?
good job.
it's very important to reset our third eye.
and connect to the primal inside of ourselves,
before I present the pleasuries.
Pleasureries?
now...
these pleasuries are best used when in tantric meditative state.
and today, I'm going to show you ladies how to reach your optimal sacrel Chakra.
all of these aids are for sale, ladies.
and look what we have here... Eatable panties.
you look hungry. Try to snack on these.
there you go.
now ladies, what pleasure party would be complete without...
glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets?
these are terrific. And for you ladies, today...
two for one.
okay?
there you go. Wanna try this out, princess?
where do these go?
from casual writing to evening wear. Gorgeous!
why don't you keep those?
and they match your ear rings.
Hannah, are you okay?
you know that I've dreamt of my wedding shower, ever since I was 10 years old?
no...
strangely enough, the image of my grandmom, pearldrape and glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets wasn't part of it.
it's not funny, Tom.
do you have any idea how important this is to me?
the Gay Gordon, pink Haggis, Dildo-sales woman?
just understand something, Melissa set me up.
Oh please! There's always an excuse with you.
I never even should have asked you to do this in the first place.
you don't even believe in marriage for Christ sake...
you know, I might.
I gotta get back.
Melissa's pretty good.
look, the whole goal here was to convince Hannah that I've grown up, and that she doesn't know anything about Colin...
that I'm the right man for her.
that did not happen.
Stella. No, baby. Don't eat buttons, okay?
Yeah, but your still the Maid of Honor, right Tom?
I don't know. I think she might have fired me.
how does somebody get fired from being Maid of Honor?
tell me about it.
you know what? I got an idea. - Okay.
to prove to Hannah that you're the only man for her, we have to make you the best Made of Honor, ever.
right.
I'm out of loss. Completely stunned. - Great.
my guy couldn't find any dirt on Colin.
this has never happened. This guy's clean.
glad that happened to me.
you know, he's got 3 Guinness world records?
cool! - We don't need to know that...
he's actually got a Medal of Honor.
that's funny, because we got the Made of Honor!
let's stay focused.
look, the point is, we're not gonna get her off this guy.
Yeah, so we need to make this not about Colin.
Yeah, we need to make it about you.
good... - You gotta show her
that you're growing up... - Finally...
I am changing. I am growing up.
good! Then this should be easy for you. - Great...
these are bridal magazines from 18 different countries...
each with a feature article on the duties of being the Maid of Honor.
I got these guys in Bangdelur that we're outsource to, they translated them over night.
great. - Nice "aperitizers" there, Gary...
here's the "Main course" - What have you got for me?
my wife Deb is a A-type personality, she ahs to do everything perfect.
sure... - Love her...
hate that about her. - Right.
anyway, she rented this when she was gonna be the Maid Of Honor for her yoga teacher.
this is "the goods." You're gonna be wow-ed.

you got to send an invitation anyway.
recieving line?
recieving line?
if there's a recieving line, it means I've failed, because Hannah's married.
right. It was a trick question.
who was the runner up MVP in 1974?
no, these questions all have to do with Tom being the best Maid Of Honor he can be.
alright.
I thought we were just asking like... Questions.
go sit down.
basic duties of the Maid of Honor?
manage the bridesmaids, carry the ring, and support the bride.
basic duties as You as the Maid of Honor?
show Hannah that I've matured, that I can take care of my reponsibilties fully...
and that I need to destroy the wedding from within.
what happens if you fail at that task? - Colin gets her.
what are we gonna do? - Steal the bride!
what are we gonna do? - Steal the bride!
what are we gonna do? - Steal the bride!
steal the bride!
and remember...
weather it is helping with the seating chart or giving your opinion on the cake, the perfect Maid Of Honor is with her bride every step of the way.
you didn't have to clear your whole day to do all this.
are you kidding? Off course I did.
the perfect Maid of Honor is with his bride every step of the way.
a changed man...
I am indeed.
I don't even know where to begin.
when choosing a china pattern, you need to think about what type of entertaining you're open to, foods you wanna cook...
look. Now don't be afraid to mix and mash.
it's important, even with different styles and textures.
what you wanna do, is stur up the tabel.
make it come alive with color and tenasity. That's the goal.
also, at the end of the day... You will find...
...Connections.
thank you very much.
let's go.
if you think I'm good with plates, wait till you see what I do with linnens.
lingerie, perfect. - What about the linnens?
you'll be able to pick out something for the wedding night.
No! - Are you crazy? You're the perfect person for this job.
who's taken off more lingerie than you?
let's put your "whore-ing" to good use.
good point.
so how did it go with the Scottish Grand Counsil?
great. Colin got them to approve everything.
great.
so, I gotta tell you... This is gonna sound funny, but...
I have to thank you. - For what?
for asking me to be your Maid of Honor.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...
you've really opened my eyes, to the whole idea of marriage.
Yeah, right... - No, seriously...
have you met someone, Tom? - No.
then how can you be serious?
I don't know, I just...
I don't know.
what do you think?
think Colin will like it?
no... no.
what? - It's just...
it's cute.
"cute"? I do not wanna look "cute" on my wedding night.
just put this on. Cover yourself up.
that's my coat.
thank you. - Thank you. Yeah.
here let me get you in a cab. Come on.
I can't believe this is my last day in New York.
what are you talking about?
I've been meaning to tell you, Tom.
when I leave tomorrow, I'm not coming back.
I've decided to move to Scotland, to be with Colin.
you're leaving New York? - I am.
it's exciting, you know? It makes sence.
he's next in line to take over the family buissness...
it's a whole new chapter.
you were amazing today, you know that? - Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I had no idea you could juggle like that.
Yeah, well... - I mean, women yes, china no.
Yeah, I know. - You're always amzing.
come here.
see you in Scotland soon, okay? - Yeah, see you over there.
I'll miss you.
Scotland...
come, baby.
he likes you.
Hi. - Hey.
nice dogs. - This is Hamish and this is Callum.
Callum? - Yeah.
what kind of dog is that?
he's a Scottie. - A Scottie?
that's perfect. Fuckin Scottie...
I've never felt like this before.
so hopeless.
so, tell me again, why you agreed to be the Maid of Honor?
to be with her, make her happy. Figure out some way to get her off of him.
maybe that was all wrong. Maybe he's better for her than me.
he's scottish, he can dunk, he's perfect.
nobody's perfect. But I tell you, this whiskey comes damn close...
it was a gift from Colin. He made it.
swell.
I can't go. I can't watch Hannah marry this guy.
she's moving to Scotland, I've lost her already.
crap. - ..."Love something, set it free."
said by a pussy and used by pussies ever since.
Casablanca. "Bogie" put's her on a plane. - Pussy.
bogie's a pussy? - Big pussy.
you know, I've only truly been in love once.
most amazing woman in the world. She was my best friend.
but I was young, stupid, and I messed it up.
in my great list of mistakes, that was the greatest.
who was this? - Your mother.
when I finally found out how stupid I was and I decided to fight for it...
I was too late.
she wouldn't take me back.
she was right.
and then it really was too late.
by the way... I'm getting another divorce.
dad...
hey... Go an get her, you pussy.
what about the dresses? - UPS are delivering them tomorrow morning.
I gave you the tracking adress... - I got it.
so, Colin and Hannah are gonna meet everyone at the house...
okay. - Great.
Thomas. - Yeah?
go get 'em, Maid of Honor.
Yeah. - Make this the perfect wedding.
and steal the bride. - Thanks, guys. Thanks.
thanks for everything, man. Thank you so much, alright?
alright, baby. - Alright. Alright, alright. Get out of here.
I'll see you later.
this is like a fairy tale. - Hannah is so lucky.
I know. - I wish I was her.
how has she ever found such a great guy? - We'll come visit her.
I know... - Look at the time.
what's your name?
you're a pretty dog. I love you.
that's his house? - No, isn't this the summer house?
the McMurray's have homes for each season. This summer home, is their smallest.
they also have an Autumn home, a Winter home, a Spring...
I know the seasons, thanks, buddy.
somebody's richer than you, Tom.
I guess you are gonna have to invent something even stupider.
Oh, my God!
the entire castle was actually build in 1220...
this is incredible, isn't it? - Yes...Wow...
grandma Pearl, Joan, this is my mother, Diedre and my father, Mungo.
how do you do? - How do you do?
how do you do? - Nice to meet you, Joan. Pleasure.
thank you. - Nice to meet you.
everyone, I want you to meet someone who is so special to my Hannah and who has been her life-long friend, and now her Maid of Honor, Tom.
Hi, how is... - Did he just say he's the Maid of Honor...
he's a bloke?!
how do you do? - Very good, thank you.
Mungo. - Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.
definitely gay.
and these are the bridesmaids. Hillary, Stephanie and Melissa.
how do you do? - Hello.
Hi. - Nice that you could come. How do you do?
how do you do?
so... what do you think? - I think, they think I'm gay.
look can we get together, talk, catch up?
Tom, do wanna see your chamber? - Love to.
okay, follow me - Thank you.
thank you.
thank you!
now then... I think just a few more spricks of jipsoffle at the front there...
lovely.
what do you guys think? - Oh! It is gorgeous...
it is so pretty... With the vail... - So shiny, and the volume...
Tom... What do you think?
of...? The hair! Yeah, it...
this sash will go on the dress.
Really? - Tradition!
what's up with that?
well...
I'm not. entirely sure...
Oh no, you see... It's attached up here...
Tom, you're the Maid of Honor, it's good to just be supportive...
I'm supportive. - I don't think you are.
no, I am. - Listen to me...
you're doing good, you're good...
Hannah...
actually, your hair... Looks amazing.
Really? - Yes.
the games will be starting soon. Here are your costumes.
games? - Costumes!
our costumes? - What do you mean, games?
the Highland games.
it's a tradtion, in honor of the wedding.
it goes right back to the time when the groom had to prove that he was man enough to deserve the bride.
if he didn't win, he didn't get the bride.
no problem for my Colin...
welcome, one an all to the Highland Games.
men have travelled from all four corners of this great country to compete in feets of strenght and agility.
but only one warrior will be man enough to claim the bride.
one warrior that needs no introduction is our very own Colin McMurray.
isn't Colin handsome? - And coming up, here, all the way from America, Hannah's Maid of Honor, Tom.
who I think you can all agree, is wearing a rather fetching mini-kilt.
who was in charge of that? - I have no idea.
they're really giving their all.
and we're running neck and neck... A Scottishman against a Yank.
ladies and gentlemen, the result of today's Highland Games rests upon the "Cable Toss."
the competition is down to 2 competetors.
a tree... We're tossing a tree?
what a toss!
way to go, Colin!
okay, Tom. Let's see what you're made of!
the whole competition rests on this throw.
look at that Yanksie!
alright. Okay.
come on, Tom! Oh gosh...
okay. I can do this. I can do this. Okay.
here we go. Great.
okay. Okay.
here we go. Here we go.
here we go, Oh...
watch out, watch out.
that's gonna cost the Yank the gold medal.
what an ass! - And the winner of the Highland Games is, our very own Colin McMurray!
that's great.
for my love is like a melody
that sweetly played in June
as fair are thou, my bunnylass say deep in love am I
and I will love thee still, my dear till all the seas gang dry
and I will love thee still, My dear
Though'd were a thousand miles.
well done, My boy.
well done!
that was so...!
well done, my boy.
robert Burns, who wrote that song, is Scotland's most famous poet.
no, no, auntie. We haven't had any "berns" yet, so we haven't got any names yet.
"berns" means children.
I'm so sorry, I'm having a hard time understanding your accent.
Ethel. - Excuse me?
it's a name, for the children.
Ethel. - "Ethel..."
little Ethel.
Yeah. We won't be naming our child Ethel.
maybe if he was a teenager...
my mother's third cousin was the Duke of Ethel.
we're a long line of "Ethels."
maybe... Maybe we'll keep it in the mix, maybe as a middle name...
so, Hannah, do you like the vensen? - It's delicious.
Colin shot it. He's a wonderful Shot.
stop, mum. You'll make me blush. - And this is the moment. I've just remembered.
what moment is that? - When Colin killed the deer.
I filmed it.
right between the eyes.
in fact, everything we are eating this evening, Colin has killed.
to Colin! - To Colin.
in your honor, Hannah.
that is so thoughtful...
I'm so sorry, I didn't kill anything for you...
gosh... What did you get?
uhm... - I love chocolate!
don't... Don't do that.
you want some...
here. I'll give you some.
excuse me. Reverend...
excuse me, sir. There you go. Wonderful dinner, by the way.
delighted, Tom. - And your wife is beautiful.
thank you very much.
Thanks. - Cheers.
a little birdy tells me that Colin personally slayed each one of these reindeer heads...
Tom... - Alright.
I say "a little birdy told me," He would have told me, but Colin shot it.
listen, seriously...
can we go somewhere private and talk? It's important.
Yeah. - Should we go?
Bagpipes...
Oh, My God...
he's been playing the bag pipes ever since he was 3 years old. Practices every night.
every night? - Never misses!
what kind of necklace is that? - They're glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets.
Hi, mom. - I have something for you.
some evening, huh? - Yes...
this is so you can have a little piece of home with you.
thank you.
look at you...
there's you and Melissa. You were about 5 there.
do you remember this?
it was taken at the lake, when you father broke his arm, because of that silly motorcycle of his.
I miss dad so much - Me too, Sweetheart.
I just wish that he could have been here.
he was always so worried, I was never gonna meet anyone.
no, he wasn't. - That's Paris.
he could be so "off days" sometimes...
what?
well, it's just... He was always convinced that you were gonna marry Tom.
Really?
I'll see you in the morning. - Good night, My Angel.
it's pulling off a bandaid. You just have to close your eyes and do it.
I just haven't found the right time. - What are you talking about, "right time"?
anytime is the right time to say "I love you, marry me."
right. - Come on, what are you there for, man?
take the shot, win the game and bring her home!
and stop running up my long-distance phone bill with these crazy calls!
right, right okay. Thanks, Felix.
God, come on. You can do this, Tom. What's wrong with me? You can do this.
Hey. - Hey!
I thought we could go for a walk and work on the vowes.
good idea. I need some help. - Good. Okay.
what do you think? - I think a lot of things.
I've been working on them all week and I actually think they're getting worse.
at first I went for the "emotion," I thought: "What if Colin does it"?
then I tried to be funny...
I don't know if Scots have the same sence of humor as americans.
so now I am back to something basic and I totally think I've geared off into something boring...
I'm crazy about you.
I think of you all the time and I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Really?
really.
that's so "generic." - Generic?
Yeah! - Generic?
it totally is! - How can that be generic?
it sounds like something you're supposed to say instead of what your really feeling.
alright. How about...
nobody in the world makes me laugh the way you do.
you're my best friend.
I just wanna be with you.
look, look! There she is!
let's go, let's go!
Hannah, let's go! - What is this?
it's her "taking out." - Her... What?
we dress her up and then we parade around one of the pubs in town.
that's wierd... - It's tradition!
Really? - Then we fill a toilet with salt and we sell your kisses for change.
sell your kisses? - Yep.
come on, it's like a Scottish Bachelorette-party.
okay, Okay...
okay, come on!
change for kisses! Right there...
instead of Whiskeys.
it's her "taking-out"! She's got the breath of an angel.
one more, alright, alright.
another! - Another!
thank you.
this is all I have.
Oh, my God! My God, you guys! - Let's go!
we have to get more kisses.
kisses!
I can't take it anymore! - What are you doing?
let's do it again. - No!
for old time's sake... - Don't take that off.
I need to make this up to you... - Don't... take... this.
no, I'm really unhappy.
that's fine. - Tom...
it's okay. It's okay... - I'm not happy at all.
get up... - And I am in a really...
confusing place in my life right now...
confusing? - Listen...
I have had some whiskey... - I can tell.
and I need you to "service" me.
service you? I not gonna "service you..." - "Service me," bitch!
Oh, my... "Service me"!
be quiet! - You be quiet.
everyone's sleeping...
get down. - You can't get down.
you can't...
be quiet! - You be quiet.
no. No! Get off!
wait... Wait...
Hannah... - Bring me more whiskey.
Hannah.
it's Tom, let me in. Let me in.
go away, Tom.
no. Let me explain. It's not what you think.
it doesn't matter now. - Yes it does. Why did you...
just... Go! - I'll go. Just tell me, why did you come to my room?
Hannah... Why did you come to the room?
to talk about that kiss.
please, don't... Don't marry him.
all these years, Tom... - Don't marry him...
all this time...
you're doing this now? - I know...
how can you do this? - I'm sorry... Just let me in.
no. I can't. - Let me in.
you're only doing this now because you are afraid of loosing me.
I need someone who's gonna be there for me, no matter what happens.
someone who truly... Loves me.
someone I can trust.
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow... Tom.
I can't be your Maid of Honor.
I can't give you away.
I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry, you and Tom had a fight.
I'm his best friend.
he's just afraid of loosing me.
he'll get over it. - Ay.
suck it! Suck it. - I am!
okay. Suck it in. Breath in...
hold it... - I'm trying, my God.
I'll hold it in. - Okay. Alright, alright.
give it to me. - 1, 2, 3...
is it?... - Oh, My God!
it fits, it fits!
it fits! - Well done.
Oh no. No, no... - My God... no...
why are we stopping? - An early flock.
a... What?
Hi, Sweetheart.
I remember you.
Hey.
Hi.
I love you too.
thank you.
turn around, I have to go back.
Oh, no.
Oh no. Shit... Shit!
Hey, I need another ferry-boat. - We only got the one ferry.
what? - And it's waiting over there for the ceremony to finish.
is there another way to get there? - You can drive.
drive... How long? - It will take about an hour and a half...
that's too long. - You can swim.
swim? - Or you can go on trip around the shore.
that will take a wee while. - Shore, right...
a horse! A horse. Hey, I need your horse.
my horse? - Yes.
come down from there. - I need to get to the church.
what do think you're planning, you great fool? You'll hurt yourself.
I'll give you 3 cents for every coffee collar used world wide.
what? - Do you have wny idea how much money that is?
good luck to you, then. Her name's Nancy.
I'll see you over there - Thanks. Nancy, let's go!
stick to the shore... Pass the monument, the church is on the left.
what, in the name of the wee man, is a "Coffee collar"?
go, Nancy!
this is just what this nice dress needs...
and it goes across the dress. It looks really beautiful.
please, be seated.
we are gathered here together, in the sight of God...
give me your pin... - to witness this congregation...
to join together this man...
this is a celebration of love.
for Colin, it's through the memories of seeing his parent's love.
...as a child. - It looks very nice.
and for Hannah, it's through the paintings of Modigliani.
therefor, if any man can show just cause why these two may not be joined together...
let him now speek, or forever hold his peace.
Tom?
Tom?
Tom!
Tom! Tom?
Tom!
Tom...
Tom!
are you okay? - Yeah, I think so.
Tom, what are you doing here? - I have to tell you something...
Hannah...
your hair looks awful.
it does? - Yeah.
what? - And the sash...
it sucks.
but that hair...
it's like a co-op for para-keeds. - What?
look... Hannah...
I pride myself with being honest with everybody.
but there's somebody I've been lying to for a very long time. Myself.
because the truth it's... It's scary.
and 10 years ago I got in bed with the wrong girl.
she turned out to be the right one.
I love you, Hannah.
I always have... And I always will.
thomas Bailey...
you are the worst Maid of Honor of all time.
Oh, no.
I'm...
so...
very, truly, sorry.
I don't expect you to ever forgive me.
just so you know...
you are the perfect guy.
just not the perfect guy for me.
goodbye, Hannah.
Colin...
what did she say? - She said I should dick you.
Oh yeah, that makes sence...
arsehole!
I do. - And Tom, do you take Hannah - to be your lawfully wedded wife? - I do.
now, this is the moment.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
at last... You may kiss your bride.
Oh my God.
number six? - Seven.
you're absolutely glowing tonight, grandma Pearl.
thank you. It's very nice of you to say so.
what are you doing?
I'm just making sure I got the right girl this time.
you do. Definitely.
Oh, Monica... - Oh, Bill...
at Ted King Auto Sales, we want you to command your price!
don't miss our year-end blow-out sale where we will put you in a new used car!
and remember, at Ted King Auto Sales, our family gives ...
... Yours ...
the royal treatment!
people don't want the "Royal treatment" anymore, dad.
selling cars is not the relationship-based business it used to be.
half of our customers don't even live in L. A. County.
I think what Little Ted is trying to say is that the industry's changing.
you see? Ray agrees with me.
the beta test... - Don't put this on Ray!
it's not about agreeing. It's just that online sales...
dad, mom and Uncle Joe left me their shares of the business so I could save it from you.
that's exactly what I'm gonna do right now.
ray, am I boring you?
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Little Ted. It's Olivia. She's running late.
run away before your wife gets here.
you know, your bad behavior is handing her my life's work.
1/8 of the business, which she's almost ready to sell back.
and don't worry. I got that all figured out.
figured out?
is that what you call dismissing 2/3 of our staff?
I'm not firing 25 people. I'm saving the other 12.
I waited until after Christmas.
remember, don't give the sales guys their pink slips until they're off the floor for the day.
uh, Little Ted, listen.
if we could just wait until February...
ray, we are doing it just like this.
off early today, Little Ted?
Yeah, sure I am, Lisa.
heading to the airport to pick up Darren.
listen, I just want you to know how much my family's appreciated all your hard work here over the past 20 years, okay?
hope this turns out to be for the best.
thank you.
Hey, Little Ted. Hey, there, Tommy.
I just wanted to thank you again for all your years of service.
and remember, at Ted King Auto Sales...
wait a second. Ted? ...Yours... What?
here you go, thanks for your great work, Sally??
the royal treatment!
Arturo, I told you I wanted the Mercedes S. U.V.
Ah, you know what? Never mind.
I'm sorry, amigo. It's the times. Not me.
que, Mr. Teddy? Business changing, you understand?
no more car-o detergente... o.
nothing personal, Arturo, but you should have seen this coming.
why are we just standing here?
uh, can't get control of the crime scene.
because? - Lieutenant Reid, Bomb Squad.
no kidding. Uh, what's going on?
well, we're still catching up, okay? Safety first.
well, wouldn't the safest place here be next to the car that has already exploded?
I'd like to see it.
we need to send our dogs through every vehicle on this lot before you can go beyond this line.
we cleared the showroom.
the 30 people who were present at the time of the incident are waiting to give you their statement.
you can start your investigation there. Excuse me.
ask the fire department not to wash away all of our evidence!
okay?!
lieutenant Provenza, if the building here is clear, maybe we can get a good shot of the crime scene from the roof.
we are surrounded by fire trucks with ladders.
I don't climb.
we'll transmit the picture to you on this.
all right. W-who's the guy on the gurney?
uh, the victim's father, Ted King Sr.
he was inside when the Mercedes exploded, started experiencing chest pains when he learned it was his son.
Ah. Not a good day to be the King.
so, the bombed-out car, sir, it was just traded in to the dealership last week.
before that, the Mercedes was registered to a Shayan Rashidi, an Iranian businessman.
according to the employees, the victim was picking up someone from the airport.
well, if we're writing a report using words like "Iranian,"
bomb," and "airport," set up a command tent.
this is gonna take a while.
Hey, hey, and... and let's start interviewing everyone.
let's find out who's who in the zoo.
Yes, sir.
I can see debris as far as...
Oh, maybe 40 yards from the epicenter.
Hey, doesn't that put us inside the blast radius?
it does.
holy cow. Guy never knew what hit him.
Rusty! Watch out! You got to...
I'm just passing them. I'm just passing them.
rusty, you are tailgating, and you didn't even signal your intention.
well, signaling before changing lanes in L. A.
is like asking the people behind you to speed up.
this isn't about beating the other drivers to the stoplight, Rusty.
if the undercover element in the S.I.S...
if you don't signal, they can't follow you properly.
Plus, it's the law. - ok.
Yes, lieutenant. We're on our way.
I'll be there in about 10 minutes. No need to rush.
things are moving here at what could best be described as a deliberate pace.
how deliberate?
we still don't have access to the victim or to the body.
Oh, my God! What the hell is that?
leave at least one car length in front of you in case you need to make any basic maneuver.
Sharon, I learned how to drive when I was 12 years old with my mom O. D.ing in the backseat.
I think I can handle a life-and-death situation.
the way you drive is a life-and-death situation.
okay, pull over.
wait! Signal. Then pull over.
uh, captain. I'm sorry, lieutenant. Go ahead.
well, it appears that we now have limited access to the victim.
um, we'll be ready for you in an hour or so.
uh, I'm coming now.
is that a kneecap?
switch seats with me.
Why?
because I am driving the rest of the way to the crime scene.
no. Sharon, I'm supposed to be training for my first day on the...
you need further instruction from someone you will listen to because if the S. I.S. Officer in charge doesn't think you're going to drive the way he wants you to, this operation will be postponed or canceled.
understood? Buckle up.
Ah, we positively identified the victim off the prints we got from the fingers we found on the roof.
Ted king Jr. A. K.A. Little Ted.
okay.
Amy, you have evasive driving training from your S. I.S. days, correct?
Yeah, reverse follow, wing car, vehicle containment techniques.
I was wondering if you would take over Rusty's behind-the-wheel driving while I finish up here.
Oh, of course. Sounds like fun.
it's not. - Uh, where is he?
he is practicing his parallel parking on the street.
thank you.
excuse me, captain. Bomb Squad reporting.
here's what we know. A vehicle exploded at 1134 hours.
the blast pattern indicates an inciting reaction with extremely high deflagration.
he means it was definitely a bomb.
and in mapping the geography of the debris field back to the blast point, the device was likely anterior to the fuel tank, piggybacked on to the solenoid.
the bomb had a trigger.
well, where is the trigger?
we haven't, uh, been able to fully access the evidence.
they haven't found the trigger.
captain, this is Ray Winters, Ted King Auto's comptroller.
Mr. Winters handles the day-to-day finances of the dealership.
Mr. Winters, thank you for your help. You knew the victim well?
since he was a baby, yes.
we're very sorry. This must be hard on you.
we'll keep it quick.
sir, was there anything out of the ordinary going on here at Ted King Auto this morning?
uh, out of the ordinary? Uh, no, not really.
except, you know, Little Ted's car exploded.
I'm not sure that's accurate. Captain, lieutenant, this is Arturo Pasillas.
he said the car that exploded wasn't Little Ted's.
but we know it belonged to the dealership.
right. But Arturo says that Mr. King came to work this morning in a Porsche and that today was the first time he'd ever set foot in the Mercedes.
thank you.
gentlemen.
so, if the Mercedes was not Little Ted's regular vehicle, whose was it?
Sharon is so... uh, w- what's the word?
like, fixated... like, fixated on the rules.
I- I like her, of course, but we're just different people, obviously.
obviously. And I've already spent a lot of time, uh, like, blending in with crowds and staying alert.
isn't that what undercover's all about? You're not going undercover.
you're gonna be in plain sight all the time.
but that's only if you can demonstrate your training, and you're not doing that. W- what?
you're... you're criticizing me already. Amy, I-I just got in the car.
without checking the backseat of your vehicle for an assailant, which you've been told a thousands times to do.
Oh, my God.
I have been in the car for like two seconds.
if you screw up the drive tomorrow...
and not checking the backseat first is screwing up the drive...
this whole operation to draw out the person writing you threatening letters will be called off.
and if you don't want that to happen, you need to spend the rest of the day doing exactly what I tell you.
start your engine, check your mirrors, and pull away from the curb.
signal!
Yes, Drill Sergeant.
why is the FBI e-mailing me about a terror threat I don't know about?
the Mercedes that blew up this morning, well, it was previously owned by that guy there.
uh, Shayan Rashidi from Northridge.
Oh, my God. Is he under arrest for terrorism?
no, he's a third-generation U. S. citizen, cleared by the FBI.
so, bye-bye, Mr. Rashidi.
well, according to the dealership staff, the Mercedes was on the lot for five days.
it was never test-driven. And it had just been cleaned and serviced two days ago.
well, one thing for sure...
Ted Jr. jumps into a car that he had never driven without checking it out, which means he wasn't feeling that threatened.
or he wasn't the target to begin with.
maybe the Mercedes insurance policy can tell us who else was cleared to drive it.
uh, it won't, sir.
according to the salespeople, Big Ted and Little Ted have some kind of special deal that allowed them to drive off the lot in any car they wanted and even give a vehicle to someone else as a loaner fully insured.
Andy, where are we with the search warrant for the dealership's financial records?
it was denied.
judge Richwood said that we could subpoena the King family's personal and corporate credit-card accounts, - but that's it. - What are you hoping to find?
motive. - This could be it.
I've been searching the victim's computer for Mercedes references, and look at this.
I don't care about the Mercedes, Teddy. All I want is you.
was the victim married? - For the last five years.
when I get back into town, let's take a weekend trip, "turn off our cellphones and have some fun.
you've been working so hard." That doesn't sound like a wife.
email address on this is dnt4@ITtechthink. com.
here's another message with a photo attached.
well.
that is Ted Jr. on the left, right?
uh, yeah. That's a lot of motive.
and a lot of gym time.
Teddy was giving me that Mercedes as compensation, kind of.
compensation for what, exactly? - Services rendered.
I was doing a lot of tech work to bring his dealership online.
he flew me here to L. A. He was paying for my rent, too.
hmm. Uh, who else knew that Teddy was giving you that Mercedes?
maybe his wife?
he told me that he was offering it to her, but she wanted a Lexus, so he got her one of those instead.
giving a Lexus off the lot to a woman he was about to divorce...
Teddy sounds like a very generous guy.
generous doesn't even begin...
I'm sorry.
it's all right. Take your time.
Yeah.
we... met on a cruise to Zihuatanejo.
he took one look at my inside cabin and paid to have me upgraded.
I bet he upgraded you really good.
Oh, come on. You were thinking that.
so, tell me, Darren.
was Teddy's wife on this cruise?
Yeah. I know... I know.
I- I-I never thought I would get involved with a married guy.
but it happened. Here I am. A year later.
and what am I gonna do now?
Teddy and his dream just... just gone.
we started out transforming his business and... we transformed each other, instead.
well, how did his wife feel about this, um, "transformation"?
Olivia... she didn't like me very much.
I'm sure she was shocked to find out Teddy wanted to marry me.
so, Teddy told his wife that he was leaving her for you? - Of course he did.
because, you know, Darren, sometimes men say things like "I'm gonna marry you" just to get...
the minute the supreme court made it legal, Ted proposed.
that very same minute.
I ... I just got back from Tahoe this morning, scouting for a place to hold our wedding.
I've been crying for over a year now.
are you sure it was Teddy in that car? - Yes.
Mrs. King, have you ever known your husband to drive a black Mercedes S. U.V?
Oh, that was the car? Oh, my God.
so, you're familiar with it, ma'am?
he was, uh... ah, I bet he was giving it to his little boy toy, Darren.
why do you say that?
because he tried to give it to me a couple days ago to keep me from suing the business.
he was probably just working his way down the list of people he needed to buy off.
Teddy tossed cars at every problem that he had. Did Teddy consider you a problem?
well, I am divorcing him.
because of his infidelity?
I looked the other way as long as I could.
but I guess part of me hoped that even though I was gonna take him for every dime he was worth, part of me still...
hoped it could work out.
why were you suing the business?
once he found out I was really going through with the divorce, he changed the dealership around to hide money from me.
that Darren boy put all kinds of ideas in his head.
it was Darren's idea to lay off 25 employees today.
big Ted tried to stop it.
we will not be downsizing our employees.
"no," Teddy said.
no, Darren says it's right-sizing.
Darren says.
so, none of the employees of Ted King Auto mentioned that they were laid off today?
maybe they saw Little Ted's death as a way to save their job.
maybe we should have this comptroller, this Mr. Winters guy, come pay a visit and bring a list of all the employees who were fired this morning.
Yeah, and Big Ted or Ted Sr.
or w-whatever the monarch of the family calls himself.
if he's out of the hospital by tomorrow, then we ought to drag him down here, too, because I'm telling you, there is something rotten at Ted King Auto Sales.
well, captain, I'm looking over Ted Jr.'s personal accounts, and if he's hiding money from his wife, it's not in his bank, ma'am.
we need to ask Big Ted very nicely to open up his dealership books.
big news... the bomb squad was able to determine the Mercedes was in reverse at the time of the explosion.
you can only do that after the car is started.
so, this wasn't an ignition-fired explosive.
no.
then what was it? Remote detonation.
the bomb squad found a receiver in the debris, the kind that unlocks your car door when you pair it up with a key fob.
it works within a range of about 100 feet or so.
so, someone watched Little Ted get into the Mercedes before blowing it up.
narrowing our possible targets down to one.
plenty of extra key fobs laying around a used car lot.
Yes, that any angry employee has access to.
lieutenant, what about the bomb materials?
Gunpowder-based, a homemade pvc pipe bomb with an improvised blasting cap made from a Christmas-tree light and a 9-volt battery.
wait. Hold on. I saw something here earlier.
on Little Ted's credit-card statement, a charge made on December 26.
I mean, who orders Christmas-tree lights after Christmas and two 9-volt batteries?
with expedited delivery.
so our victim bought all the materials for the bomb that killed him.
online, charged to his company credit card, sir.
wait. Two 9-volt batteries?
hmm. That's a big, big problem.
Why?
only one battery needed per blasting cap.
there's another bomb out there.
okay, let's see.
if I sense danger, I have to signal.
I have to stay in the safety zone.
also, I-if I hear gunshots, I'm not supposed to run away.
I'm supposed to lie down on the ground and wait for the all-clear.
or to bleed out. Whatever's first.
that's not funny.
good morning, lieutenant. - Good morning.
do we have any leads on the second bomb?
lieutenant Reid and his squad double-checked all the cars on the Ted King Auto lot last night, found nothing.
they're moving on to employees' homes.
are Mr. King and Mr. Winters here yet?
signing in downstairs. - Okay.
Sharon, Amy's waiting for me to start my S.I.S. briefing.
okay. Good luck.
Sharon... I can handle this.
please, just... don't worry.
right.
come on, Sykes.
we all know the real reason you left S.I.S.
Ah, you know, if Amy worked for me any longer, she would have shot too many people to ever make captain.
lieutenant Cooper will be the S. I.S. supervisor on your operation.
you know what Amy's secret goal is, don't you?
that she wants to be part of the brass.
and you don't get to be all brassy by shooting people, now, do you?
so... this is our Number One for tomorrow, eh?
what? - During the operation, your radio call name will be "Number One.
Oh. Beats being called number two.
Oh, you're very funny, Mr. Jump Street.
Yeah, all... All I meant was that...
Oh, very funny. Now, sit down.
impress me.
I want to be impressed because there's no way I'm putting some kid on the street unless I know he's going to cooperate with me 1, 000%.
got that, Jump Street?
I want to be impressed.
let's go, Sykes.
this is a map of the ground you'll cover tomorrow.
this is the condo.
this is your one and only driving route to the chess park and these are the chess tables inside your one and only safe zone at the park.
you will not deviate from the route or step outside of the safe zone.
Why? - Oh, excellent question.
you see, any deviation from your agreed-upon movements will be interpreted as distress and an undercover element will respond.
and that response can get people killed.
you'll be under surveillance by S.I.S. here, here, here, here, and here.
we call that covering the compass.
we do it right, it should look and feel like you're completely alone.
alone?
B- b-b-but what about you and Lieutenant Provenza and Detective Sanchez?
rusty, we're trying to draw the suspect out.
he has to believe you're not being watched or he won't even try to approach you.
now, there's every possibility he knows each detective in Major Crimes.
wait, wait, wait. So, none of you guys are even gonna be with me?
anyone you know will be well outside of the perimeter. But don't you worry, Jump Street.
you will be fully covered by my people.
how will I know who they are? - You won't.
but what if I ... what if I need help?
what if I have to do something that's different than what we had originally planned?
listen, kid. There will be no improvisation...
you got that? None whatsoever.
that's what I'm trying to get through your thick head.
now, if you don't want the name Rusty Beck to be the subject of a very sad after-action meeting, you will do everything exactly as I tell you.
the doctor just said it was shock.
I guess I wasn't ready for something like this. - Yeah, well, who is?
my only child.
you mentioned there was another bomb. Where is it?
well, we were hoping that you might be able to help us with that.
how? - Well, you could start by giving us a list of the employees fired by your son.
Oh, my God.
you seem to have omitted that yesterday, Mr. winters.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The police... I lied to the police.
they're going to arrest me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Mr. Winters. Mr. Winters!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - It's fine.
lying to the police is not against the law.
Oh? Really?
I... did not know that.
but we don't love it. - Don't blame Ray.
I told him to withhold that information.
I thought you might look at the names of the people my son laid off as a list of suspects.
but no one, none of my employees could not have had anything to do with Little Ted's death.
they only found out they were being fired when they got their pink slips yesterday, and by that time, that bomb was already on that car.
and that was his last act on this earth.
he gave them no warning!
some of those people had been with me for decades.
to let them go during the holidays?
I failed my son.
I tried to get him to do the right thing, but I failed him somehow.
Mr. King, your son was a grown man.
you are not responsible for his actions.
wasn't it my job to lead him into a mature adulthood?
why did he start turning everyone against me?
his mother left him her share of the business. My brother left him his.
somehow, after 40 years of selling cars, well, I don't know anything.
we understand that Little Ted wanted to take more of your business online.
which was bullshit!
uh, well, uh, not exactly, big Ted.
on the beta test that Darren set up, uh, people buying cars from our website showed we would make an extra $1 million a year, actually.
we just deliver the car from our inventory...
and turn our dealership into a parking lot.
and losing some of my company to his wife.
no one in my family's ever been divorced before.
awful!
Yeah. And he left Olivia for a man.
well, I don't care about that.
some people like automatic. Some people like manuals.
but Little Ted's refusal to keep his vows was allowing Olivia to destroy our profitability!
how? What was Olivia doing?
uh, s-she was suing to have a forensic accountant look over our books.
you see, Ted King Auto Sales is a corporation with several DBA accounts.
we don't do anything illegal, but some of our floating inventory estimates might confuse the IRS.
you know, Big Ted, if you let us look at your books, they would then become evidence in your son's death and it would take a lot longer for Olivia's accountants to gain access.
no, no, no, no. We're not gonna let you do that.
look through my house all you want.
but I'll thank you to stay out of my wallet.
excuse me.
lieutenant Reid located the second bomb.
Oh, thank God. Where was it?
underneath Ray Winters' car.
the comptroller.
do we know if the second bomb was remotely activated, as well?
rather than drive through the streets towing an incendiary device on the back of our vehicle, perform a forced detonation in the containment truck.
he means we're blowing up the bomb.
Hey, guys!
just finished the search of Olivia King's personal vehicle.
no bomb, obviously. But we did find this...
an after-market key fob that did not work on her own car.
lieutenant. Please proceed with extreme caution.
this could be the remote detonator to our bomb.
well, there's one quick way to find out. - Hold on.
we good?
okay.
can I give it a shot?
I just tried it. You saw me try it.
could be the plastic bag.
I think the panic button might work better and maybe if you move a little closer.
watch it, Mike, okay?
the bomb containment chamber should give me all the protection I need.
right, Lieutenant Reid? - Uh, theoretically.
fire in the hole!
eh? Eh?
maybe I'm out of range. And maybe it's the wrong fob.
all right, close enough. Close enough!
okay.
well, fire in the hole?
all right, Flynn.
when is a bomb not just a bomb?
when it's a smoking gun.
say something, Rusty. Something Rusty.
Oh. Highly original, Jump Street.
now, what is the most important thing you have to do?
stick with the plan. - Where are you going today and every day?
to the park to play chess. - Good.
now, remember, you will be covered the minute you leave the garage downstairs.
just don't try to figure out how or by whom. - I will act like a zombie.
now, you stay in the prearranged safe zone and you signal distress or threat by...
rubbing the back of my head three times with my left hand.
all right.
you just graduated from Jump Street to Number One.
now, you do everything exactly as I tell you, and we will catch this son of a bitch who's been threatening you.
okay.
I can finish that.
all right, Buzz. Let's do a radio check.
is this too tight?
um, you know what? Yeah, yeah.
maybe just a little looser.
I kind of can't feel my fingers.
I thought so.
there. Now, relax your shoulders.
breathe.
believe it or not, being a little nervous is a good sign.
it means that you're taking this seriously, which I really appreciate.
here is your jacket and your chess pieces are inside your backpack.
and your lunch.
and your pepper spray.
you ready?
number One is on the move.
don't worry.
the bad guy's probably not gonna show up the first day.
probably.
I have never seen that thingamajig in my life.
ma'am, we used that fob we found in your car to remotely detonate a bomb we removed from Ray Winters' personal vehicle.
What?! Ray?
why would I kill Ray?
God, as my attorney, aren't you supposed to, like, object to them or something?
not yet.
the bomb found in Mr. Winters' car, was it similar to the one that, uh, blew up Little Ted?
identical.
both keyed to remote detonation.
correct. - One moment.
Mrs. King, with your husband gone, is it true that you now own part of the business?
Yes, but Big Ted already offered to buy me out.
so, um, you've decided to sell to him.
well, I sued to get their books, but it's gonna take forever to figure out what everything's worth.
there's so many accounts.
Ted King Auto, Ted King Automotive,
Ted King Motors, Ted King Quality Cars...
wait, wait. Wait a minute.
do you already have access to the financial records of Ted King Auto?
we do. Two days ago, a judge ordered Ray Winters to turn over all of the dealership's books.
and according to this transcript, a court reporter has Olivia on the stand from 11: 27 and 11: 56 A. M.
and Little Ted blew up at...
and by remote detonation, do you mean from anywhere in the world or within the contiguous United States or...
more like within 100 feet. Olivia was 15 Miles away at the time.
so unless you can prove to a jury that she was two places at once...
thank you, Gary. That's right.
everyone thought I was coming into the dealership that morning.
I only pretended I was coming in so they wouldn't know
I was getting a court order forcing them to turn over all of their books.
okay, Olivia. Um, Mr. Bridges?
um, we might be able to look the other way on this "Key fob responsible for detonating a bomb" business under one condition.
you started the interview with Big Ted already?
tao's bringing him in now.
how's Rusty doing so far?
got a good appetite.
it's hard to believe Olivia would do something like this to her own business.
but I guess when you screw with the human heart, all bets are off.
but would she try and kill your comptroller?
because she got no sense. Does she, Ray?
Yeah, well, that's why we need your help.
see, we've been going over the dealership's bank accounts.
son of a bitch! How did you get those?!
Olivia gave us a little peek.
Oh, God.
is that why you read us our rights? - Partly.
anyway, you've got a lot of different business names here.
Ted King Automotive, Ted King Motors, Ted King...
we do that for balancing inventory over fiscal quarters.
standard industry practice.
we're not really interested in that, but we do have a question about one of your accounts.
Ted King Auto.
you mean Ted King Auto Sales.
no, not Ted King Auto Sales. That's your primary account.
the one we're interested in... Is Ted King Auto.
well, there is no account called Ted King Auto.
tell them, Ray. - Oh, uh, it's news to me.
Ted King Auto, huh? No, never heard of that.
Really?
because the Ted King Auto account has fairly consistent deposits and withdrawals.
every week, $1, 000 in, $1, 000 out.
well, maybe Little Ted kept this as kind of a slush fund for that Darren kid.
well, except...
the Ted King Auto account was opened 31 years ago, when Little Ted was really little.
like 2.
you add up all this money, and it comes to $1, 978, 456. 31.
we have an electronic pictrue of some of the checks deposited and they all say the same thing on the memo line.
can you read this, Mr. King?
Mm. "Lifetime warranty."
well, we try to sell one of those with every vehicle because it's a significant source of revenue.
mainly because it doesn't cover all the things that go wrong in the car.
because our automobiles are 100% guaranteed pre-owned.
plus that covers free car washes for life... for life!
well, about once a week when one of your customers purchased a lifetime or free car washes for $1, 000, they were told to make the check out to Ted King Auto instead of the usual account.
so, our question to you, Mr. Winters, is can you give us the name attached to the Cayman island bank account where all this money went?
how should I know?
because you're the comptroller.
aren't you in charge of all the transactions at the dealership?
don't you have access to all the accounts, including the corporate credit cards?
which were used to purchase the material in the bomb that killed Little Ted.
now, I wasn't the only one who had access to Little Ted's credit cards.
Olivia also had... - Wait a sec.
we didn't say Little Ted's credit card.
just that it was a corporate account.
Oh, uh, did I... did I misspeak?
a little.
wait a minute. L- let's go back.
I don't understand. Why would Ray...
it's very simple, sir.
ray here was embezzling from you. Your son was getting divorced.
his wife hired an accountant to go over your financial records, which meant Ray was about to be found out.
so he tried to halt the process by...
by blowing up my son?!
I think that was more of a panic response.
the Mercedes S. U.V. was originally intended for Olivia.
so, with her out of the way, the divorce, the request to see the dealership's books would go up in smoke.
but Olivia wouldn't take the Mercedes.
am I right? So you switched targets.
the divorce would still go away with Little Ted gone.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
there was a bomb on my car. Someone was trying to kill me.
no one was trying to kill you.
you put that bomb on your own car to take suspicion away from yourself.
now, now, now, now, Big Ted, they're just painting this picture the worst possible way.
you killed my boy for a lousy $1, 000 a week?!
Hey, let go of me! You son of a bitch!
such a lousy $1, 000 a week, why didn't you add it to my paycheck?!
you never treated me right. Your son treated me like a servant.
the day Little Ted came in to work, he acted like he knew better than everyone else and you never bothered to teach him - the basics of ordinary respect! - You have no right to talk...
please, sir.
sit.
before I say anything else, I think I should get a lawyer and see if there's some way to work all this out.
Oh, I think that we could get you a deal with a lifetime guarantee, Mr. Winters.
first, of course, we'll have to run it by our manager.
well, I'll see what we can do.
and checkmate.
well?
Yeah. He's almost made it through his first day.
almost. Almost.
Hey, mind if I give you a try?
Yeah, I could go for another. - Okay.
keep packing up.
walk calmly, go to your car.
do not touch the back of your head.
unlock your vehicle and wait for me to drive ahead of you.
if your babysitters figure out that I'm here, your mother dies.
get it?
I told you stick to the plan no matter what and you always check the backseat of your vehicle. - No. Amy, there's a guy out there...
there's a guy out there and he's threatening me, he's threatening my mom.
he's one of us.
Congratulations. You failed your field test.
in real life, you'd have died and maybe gotten S.I.S. officers killed, too.
Oh, my God, Amy. I didn't...
start your engine.
pull away from the curve and drive the way I told you while we talk about what an idiot you are.
Amy, I-I am so sorry. I really am.
I'm so sorry. - Great. We'll put that on your tombstone.
here lies Rusty Beck. He was really sorry.
I said drive.
from photo shoot to catwalk, join me as we push 14 aspiring supermodel dreams.
the winner will receive $100, 000, a contract with top model agency, new York model management, and be featured in a fashion pictorial for "GQ.
Sarah, we can't make you a supermodel.
Yeah.
this is a big part of your career.
I'm not feeling as sexy anymore.
today, you're going to be hanging from the ceiling.
who do you find the most attractive in the house?
he's a beautiful guy.
he's got a great heart.
you complain way too much.
I really see you as the weakest link.
let's gang up on Dom.
katy is not high fashion.
Ben, he looks stiff.
Dominic.
Ben, Dominic, Katy, America will vote.
you better not be eating that before you go to sleep?
why not?
a couple hours after hearing he was in the bottom three, Dom was still pissed and was taking it out on everyone in the house.
I have been hearing my name randomly.
a lot of models in the house don't like me.
they don't like Dominic.
a lot of the girls in the house are back stabbers.
some of you guys talk about each other.
I came out of the shower and someone said there was a lot of trash talking downstairs.
the whole house is open.
if someone is going to question my integrity
nobody - Please confront me.
wakey wakey.
judgment day.
you want me to come hold your hand?
I don't think it's my time to go home yet.
just doing what we have done these two weeks has made me have such a passion for it.
I'm not going to lose my roommate just yet.
I'll be sitting by the door waiting for you to come through.
you better.
I want to hug you.
be strong.
honestly, I don't know if I'm going home today or not.
the American public voted me back on last week.
this week, it's a whole new ballgame.
everything happens for a reason.
you can't lose two roomies.
the whole point of the competition is to make me a supermodel, not pick a supermodel off the street, ready to go.
after today, not going to be in a bodysuit for a while, for sure.
I'm sick of all these people.
we need to have two eliminations at a time.
screw this crap.
we'll be sending one of you home today.
last week, we gave you a new look in hopes of giving you a new look and attitude.
three of you disappointed us.
Dominic, you're back here at the bottom three again because of your walk.
we need a little bit of variety from you.
Ben, we really need to let down your guard.
Katy, the other boys and the other girls are evolving, and you're not.
okay.
america voted on the Alltel wireless phone line.
here is their decision.
america has given you another chance at being a supermodel.
nice job.
Dominic and Katy, both of you have been here before.
and today, one of you will be going home.
you're safe once again.
Dominic, America has voted.
and I'm sorry.
we can't make you a supermodel.
Thanks, guys.
I feel a bit cheated.
I got a little faulty coaching and advice on how to walk.
that obviously didn't go over well with the panel.
that would be the biggest bummer if I went home and people were like, you're the guy who can't walk.
you're the guy who is stiff because I can walk.
it's not a problem.
just give me shoes that maybe fit.
do you...
I think...
dom always tries to come off as saying "I'm not going to complain, but here's what I'm going to complain about."
if Katy and Dom come back, I'm going to walk out of the room.
the longer Ben goes in this thing, the more he'll learn.
we have the misconception of who we want to go home and who deserves to go home.
who deserves to be out of the house.
Katy's back.
watch out, guys.
I feel great that Ben's back.
the fact that Ben is my biggest competition and the fact I want him to be in the house as long as possible, they don't have to be mutually exclusive.
I want to win for sure.
I would roll Ben over in a second to win this competition in the end.
I feel good that Katy's back.
it's got to be difficult.
the only two votes, she's been up for both of them.
that's got to be a blow to her confidence, so I'm proud of her for keeping her head high.
we went to a clothing company for a kind of a casting call.
a lot of ad campaigns are about relationships and intimacy.
they put us in twos and threes to see who had chemistry in front of the camera and who didn't.
this is so fun.
who do you think you didn't work the best with?
I didn't go up with all of the guys.
I didn't go with Frankie.
are you kidding me?
I was like, ew, no.
freak.
he has this Fabio thing.
Yeah.
Frankie's name is Fabio because of his long hair, he does this thing with his hair and it's all in his face and he thinks he's god's gift to women, and he's not.
he was all
that's what it looks like.
like he's trying to think too hard and it hurts his face.
how hard do you want it?
really hard.
can you give me 110?
you're controlling.
there are some mixed signals with Ben.
I know he's married, but at the same time, he's kind of alluded to the fact that maybe if he, you know, had a couple cocktails or whatever, he would be open to the idea of being intimate with a guy.
say hello to the camera.
I'm right here.
it's difficult, because I don't think he realizes that I'm not playing.
I actually do have some genuine feelings for him.
and he's playing along, but I just don't know to what extent, you know, where that would lead, if anywhere.
there we go.
look at that hair.
that's 100?
that's 100 right there.
I think there's certainly some chemistry between all three of us, actually.
I think Aaryn, Ben, and I have become very close friends.
sharing our man, right?
you take...
you're taking what?
who's going to get his attention?
I have to look at the camera.
Ben and Aaryn are very steamy.
I feel like, you know, a lot is about to come out.
apparently, Ben is not the genuine southern boy I thought he was.
I'd...
what?
if...
what would make me so happy? - If Aaryn and Ben ended up together.
they're pretty convincing.
a little too convincing.
the wife find out.
today's photo assignment is sexual chemistry.
we need to turn the heat up, guys.
everyone knows sex sells.
think about all of the high-fashion ads we have seen.
if you're not relaxed in front of the camera, it's definitely going to show.
you won't get the job and you won't be hired.
okay.
she shoots a lot of intimate stuff for like German "Vogue," "GQ," "Elle."
we're going to do an intimate shoot with lots of sexual chemistry.
it's acting, forget about your girlfriends, your boyfriends.
if some of you get excited, that's okay.
so you have to connect with your eyes.
I want fire in your eyes.
not just good-looking and bored.
don't be shy, all right?
listen to her, because some of you haven't been listening and your photos haven't been coming out good.
I want you to listen and learn.
I made up pairs.
these two.
Ronnie and Shannon.
Aaryn and Jay.
Holly and Frankie.
then we have Ben and Katy.
all right.
then we have Stephanie and Jacki.
it's going to get a little fun.
then we have Perry and Casey.
styling, go.
I was a little nervous, but we talked about it, and I'm not nervous.
Yeah, okay.
I think we need to get Perry to do the shot.
just got to rock it out.
you know, the job.
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.
wondering if I'll still have a boyfriend after this one.
we're up for anything, I guess.
cool, yeah. Great.
everybody at hope probably thinks, oh, they're so into it.
it's so weird because you have camera guy and lights and makeup artists.
he's doing a great job, I hope.
this is kind of part of the job.
you know, my wife knows that going into it.
she's going to be freaked out watching it, still.
me and Katy, we made the chemistry, and we rocked it out today.
Ben and Katy did work very hard.
thank you very much.
brilliant.
Jacki, are you really going to let me lick you from your head to your toe?
I ordered the champagne for you.
I'm not kidding.
she's going to douse you with champagne and then lick it off.
how are you?
good.
what are you wearing?
my partner is Jay, and he was one of the guys.
I probably have the least amount of, like, chemistry with.
very naughty look.
nice. Great.
Jay, close your eyes and look at her.
sexy is going to get real misty in here in a minute.
I might go at you with bite marks.
I think Aaryn struggled with poses.
if you don't smile, you're not the girl next door.
you're falling into too much posing, which was tricky to get her out of that and make it natural.
Jay was very passive, like he would be the one laying down.
I wanted him to take control and swing me around a little bit and come up with some ideas.
instead, it was mostly me swinging Jay around.
I think Jay and Aaryn didn't have sexual chemistry between them at all.
really try to get the chemistry on between you two.
in the back of my head, I'm like, baby,
I know you're at home watching, but please don't get mad at me.
tilt it back, like that.
I was having fun and I felt like I wasn't
I haven't had a girlfriend, but it was in a professional way.
it wasn't no humping and all that stuff.
it was real nice, tasteful.
I told Aaryn, once you go black, you never go back, baby.
that's real.
this looks very tricky in the beginning.
let's make it look like friends.
more like sexual chemistry.
the last 10, 20 pictures were really good.
okay, let's move on the bed.
this is great.
you can take the bra off.
you can do it.
no, I have not been in an intimate position with a woman, but it's comfortable, and I want to get a good picture out of it.
great, great.
hold your legs up.
more faces.
do something.
great.
I have never been in a hotel room with a girl before.
I can't say I wouldn't have gone there if someone hadn't intervened at one point or another.
that's really hot.
nice. Cool.
thank you very much.
you guys make out?
maybe.
all I can say is I'm proud of Jacki, that she surprised me with her tongue.
this is what it really comes down to working on teamwork, especially with people who don't like each other.
with Holly, there's no chemistry at all.
Frankie and Holly, I want to see if he would be your boyfriend, what he would make you feel like.
it's really, really hard because you had to be, like, into them.
try to totally connect.
it's, like, really -- first of all for me, my fiancé and I, we're waiting until we get married.
so it's like really weird I have to share that with someone else.
of all people, Frankie.
I don't think she has what it takes to be in the competition.
she's got what it takes, but she's boring at hell.
how are you supposed to build chemistry when you feel like they're disgusted by you?
it sucked, you know.
it was like I was trying to A blow-up doll, man.
Holly and Frankie were very, very hard.
she didn't feel comfortable, and I felt it in the picture.
see this right here?
this dynamic duo of sexiness?
that's what rocked the sheets.
we're going to shoot on the bed.
it will be quite sexual.
you can do whatever you want.
you can strangle each other if that turns you on.
you can do whatever you want.
in the beginning, I was a bit shy, obviously.
did...?
try not to laugh.
great.
then, within like five minutes,
I started to engage with each other and had lots of fun.
- Can I?
Yeah.
I'm like so into this right now.
enough about the lollipop, because that could look a little gay.
Really?
don't want to come across as that.
Oh, go closer and then his hair, yeah.
a lot of licking going on, and biting.
and nipple pinching.
great, doing it again, nice.
I'm kind of glad I did it with a guy because now I don't have that whole,
I have to explain this to my girlfriend.
now it's like, wow, my boyfriend's gay.
it's on the pictures you see the chemistry, and you do, definitely.
I was actually surprised how willing they were to actually do something.
one, two, three, go.
great, nice.
brilliant. Thank you very much.
did you see the girls in there?
so hot.
I know, I loved it.
I love girls.
what's up, lovers? How'd it go.
you guys are all done.
nice.
Ronnie has never been with a woman.
I'm going to take his virginity.
great.
today was groping and kissing and feeling each other.
it was certainly a challenge for me.
straight yet, Ronnie?
almost, right on the verge.
maybe if you give me some kissing action.
great, nice.
Yeah, that's perfect.
great.
I was definitely turned on with Shannon.
it caught me by surprise because I wasn't expecting to enjoy it.
great.
Ronnie and Shannon left their personal lives out of this room, so it was absolutely perfect.
the last one.
nice.
thank you very much.
we're getting married.
right now.
Aaryn and Jay, and Holly and Frankie are my bottom pair because Aaryn was very posing in the beginning.
and Jay just kind of happened to be there.
Frankie and Holly were really difficult, especially Holly was difficult because she looked really scared.
top two pairs were Casey and Perry and Ronnie and Shannon.
Perry and Casey, they acted so well that it actually looks as if they would totally have sex.
Ronnie was fun, and Shannon as well.
they were great.
it was an absolute pleasure to meet you all.
see you later.
not everybody gets drunk after a photo shoot, okay?
look, I wasn't so bad.
some people here want to be an actor or like, they don't understand how bad I want this.
I know I had a bad picture, but I don't want it to end for just one little photo shoot, especially with Frankie of all things.
the situation of being thrown in bed with someone and, like, I didn't want to do it.
me and Holly have already had a dispute.
I wasn't upset with working at Holly because I know she's good at taking pictures, but she drank so much.
she drank a good two red cups, man, and I know right before she went in there, dude, her eyes were bloodshot.
and just the whole
I expected so much more from her.
when I found out Frankie was telling America basically that I was drunk at our photo shoot,
I was so shocked.
he's just a trash talker that trashes everyone.
I can't believe he said I got drunk on my photo shoot.
is this a tactic to get America to think I was drunk on a photo shoot?
what the heck?
it's...
Frankie, this is not true at all.
there's three bottles of champagne.
I could have seen it that way.
if...
I...
I felt it. I felt the vibe.
did...
I'm not going to sit here and take it.
not everybody gets drunk before a photo shoot.
you're right...
Yes, you were, dude.
so that's it.
end of story, okay?
drop it.
okay.
you're an ass.
thank you. Sorry.
Hello, models, welcome to studio X.
nice to meet you all.
I will be your personal trainer.
as supermodels, you need to stay in perfect shape, every day, every minute, is that clear?
Yes.
let's start with the guys first.
ladies against the wall.
ready to do it?
climb the hands, touch the floor.
watching the boys do their first workout, he's super intense.
constantly going, going, going, and I'm nervous about ours.
three, two, one.
are you ready?
Yeah.
are you ready?
Yeah.
let's do it.
this hurts.
getting kicked off the show hurts a lot worse.
I can't catch my breath.
come on, girl. You got it.
toughen up, all right.
Aaryn was definitely the weakest person out there today.
I'm learning a lot about your guys.
a whole lot.
some people are really pushing it.
and some are not.
all right, girls, you're done.
today's workout was really tough.
it was especially tough for me personally, but I'm here to be a supermodel, and I'm going to do whatever it takes.
models, phone calls tonight.
what do you guys think?
I mean, Ben, after the photo shoot and everything, are you a little apprehensive about talking to your wife?
it was innocent.
I didn't catch wood.
you know, I didn't really like get into it in the sexual sense as much as the acting sense of being sexual.
Hey, Ben.
phone call.
what?
hello.
what's going on, baby?
nothing.
what you doing?
just waiting for you to call me.
Oh, how are things?
good.
they're good.
I miss you a lot. I miss you.
20 days.
hearing her voice, it was kind of sad that she was upset and that changes the whole perspective.
it kind of brings you back down.
is everything there really nice?
Yeah, it's really cool in the house.
me and Aaryn are good friends.
Oh, no.
yeah I know.
not gay friends, good friends.
it makes me realize, wow, I'm here having this amazing time, and back home, you know, my wife is missing me like crazy.
Aaryn was nervous going into her phone call because she was definitely having some doubt about, you know, where her life is going right now.
I mean, her life is really up in the air.
Hey, baby.
how are you.
I miss you so much, Aaryn.
there's no end to how much I have missed you.
I miss you.
Hey, I'm here.
you okay, baby?
no.
nobody can predict the future.
that's half the fun of it.
so right now, I have to take a deep breath and put our future on hold so that I can focus on my future right now.
it just has opened my eyes so much to the fact that my life is never going to be the same after this.
nothing is ever going to be the same.
you're saying you don't
not in the regards of us loving each other and being together.
I'm just saying it's hard in this alternate reality.
you don't understand how difficult it is being here?
where is this speech going?
I'm telling you I love you, baby, and I'm saying this is going to be so hard after this.
I understand, but you're still going to want to be with me?
still...?
you're the only person I have to come home to.
what do you think?
I want to marry you so bad, I can't see straight.
Oh, honey.
she came in and was definitely inside herself.
you can tell there were a lot of things going through her mind.
he said...
what did you say?
I can't see myself going home and doing that after all this.
it's going to be like a whole new bag of problems on top of that.
use some inspiration.
this week has been all about chemistry.
you're asked to smolder with your partner at a photo shoot.
now we're going to ask you to keep the heat going for the catwalk.
this week's catwalk assignment is equestrian with a fetish twist.
you need to think Gautier dressing Madonna for her last tour.
you guys will be working with your photo shoot partner.
so to give you some inspiration
here are some tools of the trade.
there's a ton of whips and crazy looking apparatus devices.
I don't know.
remember, at the end of the show, three of you will be up for the vote.
so if we're going to make you a supermodel, remember to think big, take chances, and outshine the other couples.
all right, off to your stylists, and get ready.
some people, I just don't think they like it.
I think we're going to use it.
it's a lot of weight to have on your shoulders that you're affecting your partner.
we're just not going to let it happen where we think about are we in the bottom three.
we were both in it last week.
this week was all about chemistry.
and Ronnie and I had chemistry.
we went out there.
he and I had a blast.
Oh, how I love my job.
I think our chemistry, we have really been working on it.
I feel really comfortable.
I felt Frankie and I were a lot better than yesterday.
there's no feeling like being on the runway.
that's what I want to experience every single day.
we had great chemistry on the catwalk and showed the judges we really want this.
the catwalk was crazy.
we had an idea of what we were going to do.
at this point, I was like, you know what?
I went here, did my job.
let's see what the panel had to say.
three weeks, you're learning so much.
I'm not ready to go home.
we absolutely killed it.
we had so much freaking energy, and they were so excited to see us.
there was so much enthusiasm.
okay, models.
before we evaluate your work, we want to ask you a few questions.
Ronnie and Shannon, the catwalk, I loved how you came out, you marched like a horse.
who came up with the choreography, you guys?
we blended it together.
we took our inspiration from the equestrian, thinking like a horse, and trying to throw in the twist of fetishes in there.
it was really fun.
you brought your photos to the catwalk today.
very good job.
Aaryn and Jay.
there's no natural chemistry between us.
the fact that we came up with any chemistry I thought was professionally a victory.
Jay, if you could pick any other girl to pose with, who would it be?
Aaryn?
I think the way I looked at it,
I should have been able to have chemistry with anybody.
Casey and Perry, how did you guys come up with these poses?
how did you feel in this photo shoot?
you look very comfortable.
when I first met Casey, the first time in new York, instantly, we had this communication, like this sense of humor.
we get each other.
we finish each other's
sentences.
you know.
it's something that we're really
into.
Casey, no thought went through your head when Perry licked your head?
well, the only thought was there was a camera right there.
I'm really sorry, dad.
very salty, I would say.
very salty.
that's very confident in their sexuality to be like
it takes a real man to put his tongue on another man like that.
Frankie and Holly, the chemistry wasn't all there, huh?
not really.
not really?
what is it, you guys don't like each other?
we have had differences in the house.
we tried to put that aside.
I think that whatever is going on between you obviously translated into the photo.
because the both of you didn't look comfortable.
it was not one of the best.
Frankie, did you even try?
I did.
definitely. I'm a real sexual person, and like, she was looking at me like disgusting, you know.
I know you're a religious person so it was going to be hard for you.
my fiancé and I, we don't have sex.
we wanted to wait until we get married.
you forget that your significant other is at home and just forget it.
this is bad for you guys, you know.
on to Jacki and Stephanie.
wow, your photo shoot.
Stephanie, it looks like you were taking control?
is that true?
I think maybe I was more comfortable with it initially.
no attraction here?
I'm not, like, sexually attracted to Jacki, but to me, I think women are really beautiful, and it's not hard for me to picture that at all.
let me ask you a question.
you're not told what to do in the photo shoot or the catwalk.
you guys decided to kiss at the end of the runway.
whose decision was that?
I had to convince her.
we went for it.
I wanted ours to stand out from everyone else's.
you may head back to the dressing room as we evaluate you work and three of you will be up for the vote.
let's start with Perry and Casey.
I wouldn't expect this from Perry.
it came pouring out.
Perry and Casey came out.
Perry just, you know, turned it.
they laughed.
they had fun.
I think a job well done on both their parts.
Ben and Katy, I'm so proud of them.
I thought she looked great, and I thought she's trying so hard.
the walk is his weakness.
he's got a great look, but his walk is killing the dude.
let's talk about Jay.
there's just no chemistry, no connection between the two of them.
I didn't believe it.
it didn't look like they were comfortable.
it was very stiff.
when all three photographers who worked with Jay, they said no expression.
it's work.
it's a lot of work.
I love Ronnie and Shannon.
they just brought it today.
Ronnie and Shannon really want this.
I love this girl.
they're both willing to give 100%.
Yeah.
that's what I like about the two of them.
Yeah.
Frankie and Holly.
forgettable.
them not getting along with each other shot both of them in the foot.
I felt the same way about their catwalk today.
there weren't smiles.
no fun involved at all.
Stephanie, in these pictures, you can see she took command.
again, I think Jacki's playing it safe.
she was so into Stephanie about doing this photo that she brought Jacki right into it with her.
they stepped it up tonight.
the runway was great.
holding and kiss.
we know who did the best and the worst this week.
let's bring them out.
there are eight models standing before us.
four of you gave us supermodel-style chemistry.
three of you did not.
and will be put up for the vote.
shannon and Ronnie, Perry an Casey, this week was all about chemistry.
you guys definitely had it.
your photos were steamy and very believable.
and your catwalk was electric.
Shannon, once again, you're a top performer.
you're safe this week.
you may leave the catwalk.
Casey, we had almost given up on you, but this week, you surprised us.
you're safe.
you may leave the catwalk.
Ronnie, you are a gay man, and we asked you to play it straight.
you were hot.
Perry, you are a straight man, and you were asked to play gay.
you rocked it.
Perry, you are this week's winner.
you may leave the catwalk.
well done.
Ronnie, great job again.
you may leave the catwalk.
there are four of you standing before us.
three of you will be put up for the vote.
this week was about making a connection.
and you went in alone.
there was no chemistry between you and Jay.
once again, your photo disappointed us.
we're looking for a spark, and you just didn't have any.
you let your personal circumstances get in the way of doing your job, and you brought Frankie down with you.
you couldn't bridge the gap with Holly.
a supermodel always finds a way.
you're up for the vote.
you, too, are up for the vote.
Frankie and Holly
it's down to you two.
you are also up for the vote.
that means Frankie, you are safe.
please leave the catwalk.
whether you stay or you go is now out of our hands.
it's up to America to decide who we can make a supermodel.
good luck.
you may leave the catwalk.
the Alltel wireless phone lines are now open and will remain open until 4: 00 AM Eastern time.
and you can vote online at bravotv. com.
I'm crying on the inside and the outside.
this is what I wanted. This is my dream, and I'm not going to let nothing get in my way.
this is what I have been working towards since I was like 12.
I have been through a lot of circumstances with modeling.
and everyone has that.
I didn't think I deserved to be in the bottom three.
I did the best shot I could.
I have been here to really be competitive.
you know, do my best the whole way and do it with some integrity.
supermodel...
welcome to new York city!
I'm the only one with absolutely zero modeling experience.
I'm shocked that I even won the photo shoot.
jordan, you've won immunity.
your walking reminded me unfortunately of one of those dogs in the back of a car whose head just bobs.
Chris, I felt you weren't confident.
I think that you are missing spontaneity and charm.
all right.
Ken, I'm sorry. We cannot make you a supermodel.
16 model shave been narrowed down to 15, all with the same dream.
make me a supermodel.
make me a supermodel.
at stake $100, 000 furnished by Maybelline New York, a one-year contract with new York model management, and a shion tutorial in cosmopolitan magazine.
we've assembled an expert panel of judges, including international model scout and manager Marlon.
supermodel Jenny Shimizu.
fashion photographer Perou.
and renowned designer Catherine Malandrino.
it's the opportunity of a lifetime and it begins now.
time to get up.
one down. - Who won then?
I don't-- - Jordan won.
did she really? - Yep.
congratulations, Jordan. - Thank you.
I'm tired though.
I know a lot of people were kind of surprised.
and they were just, like, "why did she win over me?" Or whatever.
sandhurst I though Twas gonna win.
all right, just show me again and I'll
my first trip down the catwalk was pretty much a total blackout.
last time, I too stiff.
I'm just gonna have to prepare all that much harder to avoid landing in the bottom three again.
this is hard.
a new mail has arrived.
invitation photo shoot.
look for some of these and follow them to the address.
I'm excited and scared though.
our first photo shoot was dangling 100 feet up in the air in a Plexiglas box naked, so what's our second shoot gonna be?
Hey, what's up? Welcome to ghost studios.
congratulations to those 15that are left. Good job.
as a model you are often asked to transform yourself both physically and mentally.
and that's exactly what's expected of you today.
here to tell you more about itis one of the most innovative photographers around.
her images have been seen in magazines such as GQ and Elle.
please welcome Suza Scalora.
Hi, models. I'm Suza. I'm gonna be your photographer today.
and we have something very special planned for you.
we're going to make you into candy.
we're actual gonna do a lot of body painting, hair and make-up, and your goal is to really embody the candy.
you have got to be kidding me.
so I really want you to bring your creativity.
use your body, your face to really emote.
you'll be judged on your ability to truly capture the spirit of your candy.
with that said, I have a lot of work to do. So I'll see you guys later.
all right, guys. You heard the lady. It's gonna be a sweet one.
I saw some pretty-looking good bodies.
I think that it was an experience in my mind that's gonna give me some pretty good dreams.
too bad CJ kept holding her booby was cause damn.
okay, you're free.
you're gonna be an awesome rock candy.
going through the transformation today was a hot mess.
jonathan in particular. He's such a sexy beast. Like a gorgeous man.
it's, like, crazy.
but he's married, I'm married.
I am being turned into chocolate.
I don't know what I'm gonna do just like sitting around in chocolate after this.
I'm gonna lick it off you.
I'm completely out of my element.
I was captain of my academic team.
never really had much attention from the girls.
you know chocolates my weakness.
I'm a 21-year-old virgin and it's... I don't know. It's weird.
ready? - Oh, yeah.
I look like a pink kiss.
I was totally comfortable.
we had nipple covers and underwear on.
I just didn't want them putting candy on my va-jay-jay.
this is art and I love being art.
I'm just a blank canvas and I just want to be used.
I'm just trying to soak it up. - I'll use you.
you'll use me. How?
Dave looks amazing.
Oh, my god.
it's nice to have eye candy. I mean, come on.
everyone looked great. It was anyone's game.
it's pretty much your shoot to ruin.
the pixie is kind of an evil fairy.
they're sprites, you know, so they're up to no good.
but it's kind of cute. It's kind of funny.
okay, ready?
I want more life in your eyes.
like this or like this.
Yeah, you know it's not picking up too much.
I just didn't give enough energy and enthusiasm to the character.
little more.
I think it just has to do more with nerves.
calming down and being loose, not so tense. I know I'm capable of so much more.
it's a little embarrassing.
Ooh, the green looks great.
okay, I don't want you looking at the monitor.
I really want you to focus right here right now.
give me like a little "come get me" pixie look.
bring that one finger up.
that's cute.
so you're kind of leaning and you're, like, playing.
it's almost like think of yourself as a pixie who's kind of behind a bush peeking out.
okay, a little smile. Why don't you turn to the side again?
Oh, my god, your eyes--your eyes look incredible.
purse your lips a little more.
I felt like she was totally into the character.
I think now the bar has been set and we'll see what happens.
that feels very sugary.
what I want you to do, Chris, I want you to be like a sprinkle who's kicking back.
straight on to me with your head. Chin down a little bit.
okay, bring your chin down a little more. Keep going, keep going. A little more.
keep going.
I think when you find what you love doing and what feels right, I think you just sort of know.
and for me, that's modeling.
okay, I want a little more attitude.
I mean one of my biggest dreams is just to be walking down sunset boulevard and see myself, like, plastered on a billboard.
to be honest I feel like you look like you're a little bit bored of being a sprinkle.
Chris was a little stiff. I had to give him a lot of direction.
you look a little like a party favor.
you know you feel a little betty boop with the shoulder kind of playing to the camera.
a little flirting.
okay, so we're done, Kerryn. - We're done?
when I was younger, I ate so much rock candy that I got sick.
that's quite and outfit you have on. Good.
just like--yeah, there you go. Okay, the wig needs to be pulled back.
okay, do you have your piece of rock candy?
I don't know how I'm going to embody chocolate.
chocolate doesn't really do anything.
so I don't know what to do but sit there.
you're very chocolate goddess. I like it up here.
and I want you to kind of do some movement.
Yeah, totally play with it.
I think she looks amazing.
let's, um, bring the cherry in. Good.
Oh, that's good when your tongue comes out. Yeah. Good.
okay, let's see your candy moves.
let's see your other side.
turn more straight onto me, Colin.
Yeah, put some on the hair.
I feel like you need to loosen up a little bit. You feel a little stiff.
you need to just, like, relax and just try some different things.
this is definitely a learning process for me still.
it's a lot harder to be a model than I thought.
like it's so much more than just sitting there looking good.
I have to say I was a little disappointed with Colin.
he didn't really move very well.
and I felt like he really didn't have an awareness about his body.
okay, I think we're done.
all right. - Yeah.
the shoot ended pretty abruptly.
I was hoping it would end with an "all right, good job."
but it didn't really and I'm sweating a little bit.
I'm worried that I might be going home.
beautiful are walking around naked.
you just have to protect yourself to make sure nothing comes up.
the body paint's half done.
I love it when you do that!
gonna do a nude photo shoot using candy.
and I was, like, "oh, goody!
but at the same time beautiful women are walking around naked.
you just have to protect yourself and make sure that, you know, nothing comes up.
I want to see your moves.
you're a dancer. - Yeah.
nice.
okay, turn your body so you're straight on to me. Bring your body out. Yeah.
good. Look at me with your eyes. That's beautiful.
how's it feel to be a gumball?
I want you to have, like, a little bit of attitude.
sexy. Sexy. Yeah.
you feel sexy like that, right?
it's really hard to let my guard down.
I have a problem with looking stupid and trying new things.
I still need a little bit of work--a lot of work.
uh, okay, that's not gonna work.
I'm a man pop.
Oh, you all are the lollipops? Get together.
I want her to jump.
maybe pull your ponytail.
it's nice when you, like, pop up a little bit.
looking that way. Really cute. Nice.
all right.
you got it, lollipop man.
I can see already you have some ideas so just go for it.
we'll see what happens.
I grabbed one of the big lollipops and was, like, right, let's go in and just show them I'm trying to think outside the box on this.
I do like the idea of you playing with a lollipop.
I like the model taking the initiative and bringing their creativity instead of solely relying on the photographer.
you got it, lollipop man. We're done.
thank you, Jonathan.
you look sexy. for a candy cane
for a candy cane, I guess, you know. - Exactly.
branden, all right! You look amazing.
Oh, my god. That's insane.
I liked the stripe that was going down my face.
I put a lot of character into my facial expressions.
so I feel really good about this.
nice. Really beautiful.
That's--actually works really well, that pose.
beautiful.
bring one hand down. Yeah.
that is gorgeous. I love that. Hand flat against your hair. Good.
jordan was amazing.
she just came and she brought it.
and I didn't have to give her much direction.
really, really pleased with her.
beautiful job. Gimme five! Good job, candy cane.
even though I have immunity, I still want to rock out the challenges.
I don't ever want to slack off in this competition because it could come back to haunt me.
the judges absolutely hate my walk.
and I'm just gonna work on it every moment I can.
your nail bed's really, like, short. - Right.
I love Shawn. He's such a nice guy.
and he's the only other gay guy in the house.
so we've really bonded.
I've only had this done once in my life.
once in your life? - In my whole life.
Oh, my god. You poor thing.
Chris is a sweetheart.
a lot of people should just sit back and take notice of him because he's a great model, a great human being.
what does this stuff do?
just kind of like toughens your cuticles a little bit so you can push them back.
like back home I never really was, like, friends with gay people.
you know what I'm talking about?
and I'm actually really comfortable with the-- the homosexuality in the house.
it's just that I've a sense of insecurity when, like, they get close.
Why?
cause something--something happened to me when I was a kid.
and not growing up with a father and stuff it kind of made me, uh, I don't know, like,
I don't like getting close to guys at all.
dealing with the homosexuals in the house.
I mean I thought that it was gonna be really strange.
but now I've gotten a new insight on everything.
you understand that you're also living with people who are different and you accept them.
well I accept-- I accept everybody that's here. What the ?
okay, stop.
does your back hurt right there ?
you guys, we're having a conversation.
I'm sorry, she just needed to use the couches.
you just ruined it.
we're trying to have a conversation here.
it was rude to come in and do that.
it's all of our house, so.
Bonjour! Como ca va?
good morning. - Hello.
everybody in the living room. - The books are here.
let's see who was really able to embody their candy.
Chris. Here, darling. - Let's see it, Chris.
I hope the judges like it because I want to be anywhere but the bottom three again.
Amanda. - Thank you.
Cu. Branden. You want it? Do you want it?
that's super cool. - The makeup is amazing.
everybody this week was just such a higher level than they were last week.
I like the detail that had in my picture. I was amazing.
Ooh, show everybody. Come on, don't be shy.
I was not in love with my photo by any means.
I was a little surprised. I mean it's not rocket science. It's candy.
Jonathan. - Oh, that's sick.
stop, stop! Stop in the name of lollipop.
last but not least Sandhurst.
you're a shimmering god.
so as you guys know, each week the photographer is gonna choose a winner.
Cory from new York model management will make a call here and he will let you know which one of you won.
so that lucky person will win a go-see.
in the modeling industry, go-sees are everything.
I want to win this.
put on speakerphone. - Hello, models.
so models, may I please speak to...Jordan.
congratulations, you won yesterday's photo shoot.
okay, I'm here.
today your go-see is at miss sixty.
it's an Italian label with a very popular denim line.
I won immunity. Now I won this challenge.
and I think people are getting kind of bitter about it.
so I'm, like, "yes, in your faces."
jordan, enjoy your miss sixty go-see and model. I'll see you soon.
thank you!
I feel there was other people that deserve to win more than her.
I mean she had out of all of us, the most extensive make-up.
even if you just sat there like this, you're gonna get an amazing picture.
you get to choose one girl to go with you.
okay.
I think I'm gonna pick Mountaha.
Oh, awesome! Thank you.
why did you pick Mountaha.
because I love Mountaha.
now for the rest of you, don't despair.
this week I've got something special in store for you.
you're gonna die.
come on in.
Oh, my god!
it was complete bull. That was really disappointing.
this week I've got something special in store for you.
you're gonna die.
come on in. - What? What's going on?
we have no clue.
Oh, my god.
wow, what a response! Hi, everyone.
how are you?
when Tabatha walked in I was just, like, "oh, my god."
she is just unbelievable.
Tabatha's gonna take a look at each one of you and make some suggestions to our folks at cutler salon.
even if she suggests something you might not feel comfortable with, know that she's doing it with your career in mind and what's best for you.
so I can't wait to see you on the catwalk. Good-bye, guys.
thank you!
Hi, Tabatha. I'm Jonathan.
nice to meet you, Jonathan. How are you?
I'm good.
a little relaxing action going on. - Absolutely.
and now it's really kind of dead.
I think we need to cut a lot of this hair off.
she was kind of resting her fingers around this sort of point.
and my hair comes down to about this sort of point. So you can do the math.
I think you need to go darker.
it's a bit wishy-washy. It's too light.
this is just washing you out.
you ever had short hair? - No.
Really?
I'm used to longer hair.
that's why I wear extensions. Cause I like long, thick hair.
you're petrified, aren't you?
a little bit?
you do look really scared. Why are you so scared?
you scare me.
I scare most people. I'm a pussycat, believe me.
put your hand down. Act like a model, for god's sake.
you have spectacular eyes.
and your hair is way too long for you.
okay.
and, uh, I think you need to change your color so that you stand out in the crowd and bring those eyes out and get rid of this hair.
and I'm actually gonna do your hair myself.
I have lots of ideas for you.
the two things I don't want to do is cut my hair too short and dye it brown.
it was complete bull. I was really disappointed.
so you need to get ready and I'll see you at cutler salon very soon.
Bye, guys. See you later. Bye!
Bye, guys. See you later.
you said that brown hair is trashy.
the most gorgeous people in the world have brown hair and bright blue eyes.
I don't want to be like that. I want to be my own naturally blonde, like, person.
people pay thousands of dollars to have naturally blonde hair.
I don't understand why they would pick the one girl that has that to then make it brown.
like, no offense to anybody that has brown hair but it's not that exciting.
listen, listen, listen. Okay?
you look like a porn star because you have big bookstand you have blonde hair.
so what she's doing is she's making you into a model.
cu, with all the drama, is not going to bode well being a supermodel at all.
so we're actually casting for our press day which is when all the top editors from magazines come in and take a re-look at next season's collection.
and then if we can just have you, um, walk.
it's good, yeah. Thank you so much.
thank you. Thank you very much.
I think Mountaha she does have a global appeal I have to say, but she's definitely a little edgier than we go for.
okay, you want to head down to the wall and then just come back.
whenever you're ready.
Oh, shoes are big.
okay, thank you so much. - Thanks.
I wouldn't book Jordan. She wasn't as confident or as sexy as we need for this brand.
typical. It's the, "don't call us, we'll call you."
I definitely can't wait to get to cutler.
I'm excited to see what I look like at the end of the day.
well I want to introduce you to Rodney cutler.
it's Rodney's salon that we're here in today. - Welcome.
and Rodney is really influential in the fashion industry and does a lot of editorial work.
now you've got to surrender a little bit, because we have your best interest at heart.
ultimately trust us and understand it's about setting you up for success, okay?
you ready? Cool, let's go.
this definitely has to go. - Yeah, that's gotta go.
you should cut it short. - It just doesn't work. You need to.
just cut it short.
you're in great hands. He cut Frankie's hair off last season.
okay, okay. - It'll look great.
Frankie didn't win, did he?
good comeback! - Okay.
now you are in good hands. Clyde
did holly and she won! - She won last year, so...
you're in good hands, all right?
Chris, okay.
Yep.
I don't know. You just, to me, you just don't look like a model.
we're gonna stick with the androgyny feel, but make it much more sort of editorial-looking.
Yeah, that '70s kind of
Mick Jagger. - Rocker--Exactly.
I have full faith in you.
Oh, my god, hi!
you're getting a huge change so I hope you're ready for it.
you're gonna look like Tabatha. - That blonde?
Really? Really. Okay.
look at these cracks back here. - Yeah, these are brutal.
they're really-- they're coming out.
so we aren't really getting drastic changes, me or you.
no. It's hard to improve on perfection, you know?
Oh, I know. What can you say, man?
you need to get over yourself in your head to get over it to be a model.
I will. I will.
I love it.
I haven't got used to it yet. - It's amazing.
don't take this the wrong way, but I take you more seriously now.
like, it was just a bit freaky.
I think that the new cut is going to be beneficial to me as a model.
the judges were telling me to have more of an edge.
and I'm hoping this week that they'll see that.
something strong. Giving you bangs. Heidi Klum comes to mind.
really, really striking. Great job, Dan.
how are you? - Good.
are you nervous? - She's nervous.
I seriously just cut my hair eight inches two weeks ago.
and it was a big shock for me.
this is the shortest my hair's ever been really in my life.
can I ask you, do you want to win this competition?
Really? - Yeah.
tomorrow I'm probably gonna wake up in the morning, look in the mirror, have a little girly scream, and then I think I'll be used to it.
we still not looking? - I'm still not looking.
all right.
sit back and chin up.
what do you think?
what the ?
it's... it's crazy. I'm--I don't know how I'm feeling.
I have to get used to this for a minute.
the hardest part of today was putting my future in someone else's hands.
but I'm happy. I mean as happy as I can be for being a brunette.
see you later. - Good luck. Good-bye, good-bye.
now we can go to sleep, right? - Have a drink.
Yeah, right?
I do not want to see somebody looking that miserable ever.
are you serious about being here?
I feel like you have this " You" attitude.
all I have to do is walk.
it's not hard.
babies do it. I can do this.
I've got ears again. I haven't seen these ears in, like, a year and a half.
stop being a bitch.
and Chris, bow chick a wow wow.
was sup, models? - What's up, Tyson?
styles looking good. Come on.
so this week we're gonna make you guys walk with partners.
top designers like Heat here Tteand Alexandria hotchpotch all send pairs down the catwalk.
the whole thing with walking with someone else, you have to have that timing.
the stylists picked the partners that you're gonna be with based on your look and your height.
all right, so first pair.
branden and Sandhurst.
Salome and Colin.
let's do it. Tall people.
Mountaha with Chris.
next one is Jordan and Amanda.
I ended up getting paired with Amanda.
I hate Amanda.
that means Kerryn, you will walk alone.
don't let me down. All right, mama?
based on your performance now, guys, both on the catwalk and the photo shoot, the judges will choose one person that they feel we cannot make into a supermodel and we have to send somebody home.
before we send you to the stylist, we have a little twist to the game today.
you're gonna be working with a prop.
you're gonna have to incorporate it into your pose at the end and the judges will be judging you on how you use it.
models, it's time for you to go to the Maybelline New York make-up studio.
Nicole and I will be watching.
make us proud.
and I reckon you're comfortable doing the whole throw it up in the air and catching it.
hell no.
I'm just hit in the gut with nerves.
and right now everyone's being really supportive.
now your head, it needs to move.
keep the head straight.
keep your head down.
just basically do not move your head.
move it big.
it's like you're strutting.
Oh, boy.
I really need to believe in myself to step it up.
I really need to stop feeling so uncomfortable and so shy.
just, it's hard.
when it comes down to walking for the judges, you know that's when it gets tense.
that's when it counts. That's when everything's on the line.
and that's when it's the hardest.
you still need to practice your face when you walk too.
I know, how is our face gonna be--show me.
it really scares me that Jordan has immunity because frankly she could blow the runway just to make me look bad and not go home.
I feel like a cute, innocent smile. - Yeah.
there is definitely a lot of nerves before the catwalk.
pretty much just every second.
I definitely need to nail the catwalk this week.
the moment I step up the catwalk I'm feeling fun, playful, youthful, energetic, colorful.
I feel like all the things that this walk is supposed to be.
I always have pre-catwalk jitters.
I always feel my heart just going bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum.
and boom, as soon as you get on the stage, that adrenaline hits you and it's just amazing because you change from fear to excitement in one second.
I did feel that the prop was just a hindrance.
it's not easy to lug a 30-pound lollipop down the runway with you.
I was so scared walking with Jordan, but it actually worked out really well.
and I think she sincerely wants to do her best so hopefully we'll--we'll nail it.
I really didn't know what I was doing with my licorice whip.
like, there was nothing to do with it.
it's just ridiculous.
so I just walked down with it over my shoulder.
I was thinking these judges probably want innovation.
so opposed to going clinch?
I thought right, let's make it happen.
do what I've got to do and I'm gonna win it.
there's definitely some jitters when it comes to the catwalk.
and the whole candy thing and bright colors.
you know it's just not my cup of tea.
I'm so super excited to walk it on my own.
it's just harder to work with a partner.
now is definitely the time to shine.
fantastic job.
let's see what our judges have to say.
you remember our head judge Marlon.
our very own runway rebel Jenny Shimizu.
world-renowned extreme photographer Perou.
international fashion icon Catherine Malandain.
models, the judges have tallied your score based on both your photo shoot and your catwalk performance.
if I called your name...
you are safe. Please leave the catwalk.
the seven of you represent the most impressive and the least promising models.
let's start with Colin.
you know the pink shirt has to be very emotional.
we have to believe and want it.
and especially when it's about chocolate we want to eat you.
but on this one you just don't want to.
you did much better on the runway this week.
much, much better.
I've been walking back and forth in the house and back and forth behind stage just...
trying.
and tell us how Jordan did this week.
I loved you and Amanda together.
Yeah, we worked really, really well together.
the picture--I didn't know who it was when I saw it today.
and one thing about being a good model is that you can transform ourselves.
and that's really something you can't teach someone to have.
all right, we're up to Gabriel.
I do not want to see somebody looking that miserable ever.
you're smiling now, but like with this photo shoot, it's depressing.
you look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.
an orange rabbit ought headlights.
you know, you look likely the on kid I know that's miserable with candy.
I'm just naturally more kind of more dark.
when you smile you look great. And you try to be too much in control.
what do you think of Chris?
I didn't see the confidence you need from a runway model.
I don't think the props worked. I think you were both separate.
okay. That's good advice, thank you.
what I think is nice with you, Chris, it's, like, you always keep very positive.
you always say, "nice, thank you. It's great. I'm going to work on it."
but really I didn't seethe improvement from last time.
talk to me about Jonathan.
I loved the ending of your walk with the choreography.
it was fantastic.
how do you like your haircut?
it was dramatic as it was coming off but I'm--I'm really pleased.
you should send Tabatha some flowers-- - Oh, yeah.
because it really changed the way you look.
Marlon, what do you think of Branden?
everything.
you walked well. The clothes look good on you.
thank you so much.
the picture is beautiful.
I'm seeing here, like, a vulnerable side.
it's actually nice to see that you can do that.
talk to me about CJ.
I like the hair change. Do you?
um, I don't know.
as for the runway, it was poor.
you're up there yawning and looking uncomfortable and like you don't want to be here.
are you serious about being here.
Yes, very much so.
Tyson, what do you think?
with Chris, he gets it.
but I think I still need more time with him.
Nicole, talk to me.
cu, you are in front of people that are going out of their way to be here and help you.
and I feel like you have this " You" attitude.
like you're a tasteless version of Kate Moss.
and I know that there's something inside of you that is sweeter than that.
all right, models, you've heard what we have to say and we've heard what you have to say.
now it's time to let the judges decide your fate.
what's going on with CJ?
she does look good in photos.
but she was bored, she was yawning.
it looks beautiful. She's s pretty girl.
she's giving good face in this picture.
so Chris, I actually like the way you look.
maybe what he can do because he's so androgynous is like a Helmut languor even Burberry commercials where all the boys look like young girls.
you know what? I don't think so.
I think you're making a parallel with yourself.
you have, of course, the type very androgyny. But it's very gutsy.
and here we feel nothing about him.
what about moody, miserable Marty?
he's bright orange.
Gabriel. The picture's horrible. It's as if he's being arrested.
if you look at Gabriel, he does look like a model.
Gabriel's crap. He irritates me.
Colin did fantastic.
it's not a good picture but his improvement on the runway was encouraging.
he's definitely improving.
how about Jordan?
she's very soft.
she has a side that is fragile and you feel it by just personality.
that's why she has a chance to become a model.
I actually like Brendan.
Brendan, I--yes.
what they're to portray in the photo shoot remember is the candy.
Brandon is peppermint.
he's icy, he's cold.
I want Jonathan to get immunity.
I think he had a great improvement.
I think he looked good. I think his photo's good. I think he did a great runway.
Perou, if you were gonna do a cover of a magazine, who are you gonna pick?
the judges, they had a tough call to make tonight.
but they've come to a decision as to who we cannot make into a supermodel.
jordan, as last week's winner, you have immunity.
you're safe. You may leave the catwalk.
jonathan, you owned your drastic makeover and you owned it on the catwalk.
branden, you keep growing, maturing, and embracing new things, my brother.
thank you.
you're safe. You may leave the catwalk.
branden, you have won immunity and cannot be eliminated next week.
please leave the catwalk.
I'm immune. I'm immune to the virus that's going round.
the deadly virus that kicks people out of the house.
well? - So I didn't win immunity.
what? - I did!
you're such a liar.
Colin, you're taking direction well.
keep it up, but also step it up.
I will.
you're safe this week. You may leave the catwalk.
thank you, mentors, judges.
only three of you are left.
and all of you are facing elimination.
you are safe. Leave the catwalk.
one of you will be going home tonight.
Gabriel, the judges are not really convinced that you can do anything but pout.
Chris, the judges do believe that you are trying, but I'm afraid your efforts may not be enough.
you're safe. You may leave the catwalk.
thank you.
you were all worried.
so that's mine.
Chris, I'm sorry.
we cannot make you a supermodel.
it is very difficult to be eliminated. Especially so early on.
I was just kind of shocked with all the changes that I realized I was going to have to make, you know, just to please the judges.
don't give upon your dream.
please leave the catwalk.
okay, thank you.
I don't think my career's over in modeling. That's for sure.
I can't wait to see my face plastered on the side of a bus somewhere.
um, as I'm sure I will in the future.
next time on make me a supermodel...
she's just, like, going like this.
it's hard to feel comfortable with yourself when you're around a bunch of people that don't want you around.
this was your poorest effort.
that was really disappointing.
you're standing out to me but not in a good way.
who do you think Bravo can make into a supermodel?
go to bravotv. Comto cast your vote.
Casey, we cannot make you a supermodel.
you're going to New Orleans.
one other thing, just this week alone, only two of you will be set up for the vote.
Perry, come here, buddy.
Tyson came up and showed me a magazine
no way.
shannon looked horrible.
like, ugh.
Shannon, the way you expressed yourself, I didn't read goth.
I didn't understand it.
Ronnie, he's only got that one catalog style.
whether you stay or go is now out of our hands.
14 aspiring models have been narrowed down to five.
each battling it out for a contract with New York model management, $100, 000, and a fashion pictorial in "GQ" magazine.
right now, Ronnie and I are both up.
this is like his fourth time.
it's only my first, so I feel like I know I have more of a right to be here than he does.
dude, you really need to pack.
I'll put a couple of underwear and socks in my bag.
just in case. - Just in case.
mom always said to wear clean underwear.
I know I'm going to be coming back to stay in the house because, you know, to think anything else would be a slap in the face to America.
get a load of that.
put your picture backwards.
I can't believe they did that.
it makes me that much more want to beat them.
so they're actually doing me a favor and they don't know it.
I'm about ready to head out for my trip, but it won't be too long.
just going to get eggs and milk.
I'll be back.
please come back
Hey, you guys.
okay. Jerks.
it's mutual.
you make me so sick.
take care.
bye Shannon - Beautiful day.
Bye, Holly.
I'm here with Jennifer Starr, the country's premier casting director and my co-host, Tyson Beckford.
Cory Bautista is on business.
america voted on alltel phone lines.
here is their decision.
we cannot make you a supermodel. I'm sorry.
okay.
thank you very much for the opportunity.
that means Ronnie, you're safe this week.
Shannon, we're going to miss you.
say your good-byes.
thank you.
I don't feel good, but I guess I just have to deal with it.
it's hard.
in a lot of ways, I do think it's unfair.
I'm not angry, but I am disappointed.
and I'm going to do it.
I never had any doubt about that, but I guess this just isn't the place and the time right now.
so do you think there are going to be the only girls left, or do you think Shannon's coming back?
I think she deserves to come back, but I don't think she will.
I feel like Ronnie is fake, and
spare me. I can't even talk about him.
america loves him.
he's been up four times and America's brought him back every time.
she's a better model than he is.
I disagree with that.
he's limited to one look, and that's it.
she's more versatile than he is.
she didn't like us.
I don't understand. You act like Perry now.
it gets on my nerves.
it's like Perry is the leader and you guys follow him.
like Casey was following you?
you have this thing, and you're like, whoo hoo.
so I heard someone ordered a cheese pizza.
what's up, boy?
what's up, man?
good to have you.
it really makes me mad that he knows he's coming back every week.
it really makes me mad.
no one should ever be that sure, you know.
good to be back.
Hi, Holly. - Hello.
how's it going? - Good.
did you guys have a good conversation?
Oh, yeah.
about a 15-second conversation.
were you surprised, Holly?
not really.
did he deserve to be back?
I think Shannon deserved to be back.
cut that tension with a knife.
yo, check my swagger up the stairs, son.
look at my pants, son.
Hey, boys and girls, come downstairs.
come on, you sexy beasts.
the time has come for me to bring in my friends to help you along your journey.
it's been a long one.
I told you I would have special guests drop by.
when you look in the dictionary, and you look up the word supermodel, this person's image, profile, everything appears.
close your eyes.
Hola, chica. Come here, mama.
- Hello.
Oh, my god.
I could not believe when Naomi Campbell walked in the door.
my mouth was like this the whole time.
that's Ronnie, Ben, Carry.
she needs no name introduction.
is it fun? Are you having fun?
this is like my sister.
we have done so many photo shoots together, naked and clothed.
sometimes they weren't naked, but after we saw them, we were.
exactly. Booked me jobs.
I make him travel across the Atlantic, which he doesn't like to do.
I said, I won't work without you.
whenever he comes on the runway, people all over the world scream.
women just scream. It doesn't matter where you are.
they just scream.
you're the four finalists? - Yes, they are.
I wish you all the best.
sit down, show her your books.
I'll grab the books.
they're stuck in an awe.
ms. Holly. - I like your hair cut.
which we are had to fight with her to get it.
I can't believe a supermodel like Naomi Campbell complimented my hair.
this, I could not do.
I don't -- I'm not a lover of the snakes.
this is Ronnie.
how did they do that? It looks like the matrix.
she liked that one.
when a smoking hot fox like Naomi said that something I did was smoking hot,
I was like, uh-huh.
okay. You're Naomi.
this underwater theme is freaking me out.
you had to hold your breath?
no tanks to breathe, nothing?
I wouldn't have done that.
well, I'm going to go, but thank you so much.
nice to meet you, and take care.
Bye. - Baby, bye.
Oh, just another friend dropping through the neighborhood, of course.
she's an icon for fashion and always will be.
that's what the word supermodel is all about.
so strong, darling.
did that just happen?
Yeah, it happened.
nothing means more to me than seeing your smiles today.
that was hot. That was hot.
see you later.
what's up, gang?
okay, so you guys have done so many different photo shoots from Times Square, snakes, wire works, running around in the snow.
Hey, it's not over yet.
this is your last photo assignment.
Yeah, guys. Last one.
so with that being in mind,
I'm going to introduce you to the top director and photographer, Matthew Ross.
how are you doing today? - Good.
Matthew is well known as both a photographer and a director.
he started his career very young, and since then, Matthew's still photography has appeared in practically every American publication.
the theme is the natural element.
you're going to be nude.
this is not right.
the theme is the natural element.
earth, air, water, and fire.
our assignment today is to be nude, again.
I don't want the boys to see me naked.
I'm the only girl left.
I look like cruella de ville on crack.
I don't like to be nude in photographs.
I prefer to be nude in the shower, but you have to do what you have to do.
this is a competition, of course, and it makes me need to really boost up my game.
the photo shoot is really important, because it's the last thing America is going to see before they vote.
this is it. This is in last week.
you have to give America, you know, something to be proud of.
I need to cut your underwear off. Is that okay?
seeing Ben naked is like seeing your brother naked.
it's just not right.
is this a bad time to say I gotta pee?
it was a little nerve-racking when you're nude, but I have grown throughout this competition.
I needed to shave my
now breezes feel good.
the expectations of the models today is that they do what all models do, work collaboratively with me, take my directions, and show me something I didn't expect, something I wouldn't have thought of.
lean back, and crunch a back. Right there.
please don't move.
bring your face straight to me. Right there.
bend the elbow up. Stay there.
he is bringing a really strong male power to it and sensuality, which is a nice mixture.
hold it right there.
we're going to make your body shinier now.
that's very beautiful. Don't move.
we're going to try another version of the fabric that is re-enforced with these sticks.
doing a good job over there. Doing a really good job.
these pictures are hot.
hold it right there.
okay, thank you so much.
I want to say that was very good work.
this whole season was cumulative.
this is the last time to put everything you had into play.
I feel as though I'm a serious competitor in this.
Ben impressed me very much with his willingness, with his collaborativeness, and he was willing to take my direction very well.
in a way, it made it difficult for me because every shot we have done was brilliant.
next up is Holly.
and we're doing fire.
I'm looking for something very intense and fierce from her.
amazing. That's it.
chin up high. Open your mouth.
Matthew, he's just really awesome to work with.
really good directions.
he's a perfectionist, which means I'm going to get the perfect shot.
hard to believe this is our last week.
last photo shoot. - Last photo shoot.
Holly is taking her time leaving.
as far as I'm concerned, it's her loss.
let your elbows come forward a little bit. Beautiful.
absolutely gorgeous.
I feel like I have certain ideas about posing, but I want to let Holly go with.
after she understood the mood I was going for, it was better, much better.
I'm a little concerned about her body, to be honest.
it's not as toned or thin as it should be to do fashion, and probably not as toned as it should be to do a nude.
all right, lady. I got you.
thank you so much. Thank you, baby.
I can't wait to see the flames on my head.
all right, gentlemen, time to set up for the fire element.
look at that.
Oh, my gosh. So awesome.
all right.
I'm definitely ready to handle this.
I have done everything on the show.
I've done every shoot.
I'm ready to do this and cap off this long journey with what I want to be my best photo shoot yet.
everybody turn away.
give us the word.
all right, I think I'm good.
all right, if we see anything we have never seen before, we'll call 911.
here we go.
bring your elbow out on the side.
bring your elbow out.
they gave me an ice cube, and they put some glycerin around my lips to look like I'm salivating.
I'm looking like some kind of freak.
it's really supposed to warp your mind a little bit.
that's good.
bring your elbows forward.
hot, really good.
open your eyes a little bright. Yeah.
he looks like he has -- private parts.
pour water on yourself during the shot.
hold your hand a little further to the side for now.
Yeah. One more.
that's good. That's it.
just slow down with the water a little bit.
okay. Let's let you rest for a little bit.
I'll check those. Thank you so much.
I'm totally satisfied.
let's knock -- that was amazing.
mark that one, and let's come in and do a close-up now.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah?
I have a tattoo on my wrist and it's no longer significant to me.
I don't know if you can like whiz with photoshop.
I could get rid of it.
this being Amanda that pretty much, and the fact that things are not going well right now,
I don't want to look back on this amazing shoot and remember that and always be reminded of this.
I don't want to have this picture five, ten years down the road and see that tattoo all the time.
I don't want it to be a little mark on my picture.
let's take a break and check it. Thank you.
all right, Perry.
you did it, man.
when I see that level of commitment to a performance, that's what it's all about.
because this box here records performances.
and without a performance, I haven't got anything.
just a lot of hair and makeup.
that's it. Chin up high, please.
could you put your head underneath the vine?
a little higher up. Right there.
beautiful. That looks amazing.
Oh, yeah. Tag that.
I feel very youthful.
very dirty and one with the earth right now.
there's so many good ones.
Ronnie looks preppy and Ivy League and really, really clean cut.
but then when he was transformed through the process,
I mean, he was like the god of the wood.
Oh, cool.
that is really cool.
Ronnie, got wood?
Yeah, I'm the only girl left, and I think I'm turning into a boy now.
I'm turning into a tomboy because I'm hanging out with them too much.
we're going to try this a little bit. Right there.
that was a great day.
I thank you so much.
needed it be a stoic object and work with hibody form in many ways he was good at.
masculine grace at its finest. He's a beautiful man.
we've got someone to help you with your catwalk.
Oh, what's up?
we're driving up the street, and the first thing I see is my picture on the wall from the shoot we did yesterday.
and we walk in, and it's like everybody we shot with, Niki, Tyson, the whole panel is here, people in the industry.
and they're all complimenting you on your picture and how good a job you have done.
it's so surreal.
they seemed like they were really engaged.
they enjoyed their role.
and they're all so different, too.
every one of them was like a different genre.
to me it's great to see that the four left deserve to be there.
you really do.
after ten years of trying to break into this industry, to see myself blown up to that magnitude on a wall, and everyone in the room just talking about it and discussing it, and it's a piece of art, you know.
that will live on forever.
I have been trying to really be noticed in this industry, and to see people stand there and see my picture is crazy.
it's surreal. I'm like, pinch me, people.
I'm a big deal.
I'm in New York city, the place I always wanted to be, doing what I always wanted to do, shooting with the top.
I'm living out my dream.
you should be very proud of yourself, because, Ben,
I don't see a prison worker there.
I see a professional male model.
Congratulations.
last catwalk today.
last catwalk day.
I'm still high from last night at the gallery.
this runway is going to be weird.
we're probably going to be naked.
no, we're not going to be naked.
we're going out in style.
Hi, models. - Hey, Niki.
so, there's still one more step before America can vote for the winner of Make Me A Supermodel.
this week's catwalk assignment is to work three winning looks that will make use of everything you have learned.
at this point, it's all or nothing.
are you guys ready to get to work?
good.
we have someone to help you out with your catwalks.
he is the winner of this season's Project Runway.
no way. - Darling.
how are you? You're all so fabulous.
Holly, I made this dress just for you.
you have to wear it for me, okay?
christian from Project Runway showed up and helped us with our three works and told me to wear his dress.
I'm here to help all of you and help you with all of the collections.
one of you can be the winner.
I'm going to kill the catwalk like it's a lazy squirrel.
I'll have a look at your walk, we'll do a rehearsal, and I'll see you on the catwalk.
good luck today, and remember, this is your last chance to show us how far you have come, and for America to pick up the phone and vote for you.
have fun today.
all right, models.
this is the last catwalk.
it's going to make everyone at home call and vote for you.
you're trying to win, so give it your all.
everyone backstage look forwards.
I think maybe not be too serious.
doesn't need to be serious at all.
the other ones, more serious. This is more fun.
all right, give it. Work.
no, don't ever do that. - I know.
I love the couture.
little pep in the step, a little bit?
I like it. Actually, it's pretty cool.
the pose can be more serious. - Okay.
I think if anything, when you look, you sometimes look around.
try to just look forward because it looks too pageanty.
like you're trying to win Miss America.
so be more straight.
really strong like that.
really good, but still fun.
just like sassy. Yeah.
and you can even do little like, like you did.
Yeah, that's kind of cute.
all right, guys, come out.
that was really cool. It was really fun.
for the last one, it's more serious.
elegant and sleek and beautiful.
so slow it down a little bit. All right.
let's go one by one again.
Holly, we'll start with you. - Okay.
so you're really expensive, elegant, beautiful.
the walk is beautiful, but your face is a little dead. - Okay.
it will help you're in the dress because you're going to feel like a million dollars.
that was really way too slow.
start over again.
it doesn't have to be - - You said slow, man.
doesn't have to be zombie killer.
I don't think Ben is ready.
I think he would need an agency to push him, but his face is so drawing, so symmetrical, which i love.
really good. Looks perfect.
I think you should do that. No, do not do that.
but it looked really good.
see, that's a good walk.
this is the last show. This is it.
I want to do something cool.
that looked really good.
that was cool and, like, upbeat, but not stiff.
I like tall models that stand out.
so, yeah, I think he'll do really well.
I wouldn't do anything cheesy.
all right, cool. I'm going to stick with that, then.
I like that pose at the beginning. It was good.
I want to see Holly like really work it.
I love the bob.
but her, herself, I wish she had a little more personality, but she's a great model.
she's got a really good walk.
I like her walk lot.
I would probably book her in a show.
I think I would book her definitely.
you're trying to win. You have to work it.
Ronnie, I want to see something fabulous.
all right.
you're too serious.
see, I was so happy in the beginning of the show.
they said, don't be cheesy. Don't be happy.
don't be cheesy.
not serious, edgy, not serious.
it's hard to explain.
Ronnie, he's so cute, and his eyes are a little lazy, but that's dopey and cute.
a lot of people love Ronnie.
maybe all the gays are loving him, but I think that would be pretty sad if he didn't make it.
all right, models, let's get into styling.
Holly, what would you do if Ronnie won?
when I walked away, the panel said bad ass.
it could been because I had it on my back or because it was a nice walk.
the underwear was cool.
I definitely felt very confident on the catwalk, and it's grown over the last several weeks.
I'm very comfortable with who I am, where I'm at, and where I'm going.
this is so awesome.
I saw the music and my outfit and just letting go and having fun.
second catwalk was really fun.
fun clothes, so got to have fun with it, you know.
I don't even know if I did a catwalk.
I just danced down the runway.
Oh, my gosh. That was so much fun.
we were out there having a good time, just strutting our stuff down the catwalk.
my second catwalk was the most fun catwalk because it actually looked like art.
I was very like this art sculpture.
it's a privilege to wear it because you made it just for me.
the last catwalk is in our suits.
I'm a little stiff, but I'm doing great.
I don't even own a suit.
every time I get to put one of these on, I feel so good.
I feel confident, I feel sexy. I feel great.
my last catwalk was certainly challenging.
you know, I struggled with it a little bit.
with the suit.
I thought I did great on the catwalk.
this is my favorite part about modeling, the catwalk.
I feel I did really good.
all right, models, we have a guest on our panel today, your photographer, Matthew Rolston.
before we evaluate your work, we want to ask you a few questions.
okay, Ben, starting with you.
your second look, who came up with your dance moves?
it was great to see that side of you.
do you feel you have changed from the first prison walk catwalk?
definitely, I have changed in every aspect of myself.
I'm very happy with the outcome of this experience.
walking out tonight, I thought you looked sexy.
for the man who doesn't believe he's sexy, I think you're starting to believe it.
I believe it.
right now, you have, to me, you have the best body up there right now out of all of the girls and the guys.
definitely true. - Definitely have the best body.
have you ever seen your body in as good of shape as it is now?
no.
when you look at Ben, is there anything he still needs to work on?
definitely.
I still think he's stiff and he needs to work on that.
that's for sure. - I agree.
I would like to see you get more comfortable in your movement.
what I saw surprised me because you were so comfortable in front of the camera.
it was really flowing.
we need to see more than the two looks you have, the happy and the angry.
all right, Ronnie, wow. Amazing.
how did you like being earth?
working with Matthew was really a great honor, you know, to work with someone that has done so much in this business.
you know, he taught me a lot.
have you guys been training because you're not as cut as you were say back week seven?
the production schedule has been more rigorous.
we have kind of skipped meetings with Clay.
I was talking with Clay, and he feels like you guys, you know, you and Holly have, like, stepped off the gym bus and just been chilling at the bus stop.
is he as defined as you would like to see him?
no, I would like to see you more cut.
I would like to see less body fat. Leaner.
I had a problem with the catwalk.
you kind of gave us holding on to your jacket.
that Chicago pose doesn't work too much.
I don't know if it's Chicago.
it was just, I thought you had been past that.
Ronnie, you have come from the bottom four times.
why does america love you so much?
I just believe that, you know, America sees my genuine passion to be here.
and my ability to grow.
this opportunity has shown me that I do have what it takes and I do have that potential.
and I think America wants me to be their supermodel.
Holly, what would you do if Ronnie won?
slit my wrist.
do you think you can still be the last girl standing?
Yes, I know I can be the last girl standing.
despite what the boys say, like, I really do have spunk and I have sass.
I really don't understand how the boys don't think I have a personality.
I don't think she commands any attention.
even when she was saying I'm the last girl here, it was like, I'm the last girl here.
you're the last girl here.
you have to command a certain presence.
with that is body language, and certainly a voice.
you have to say things with vigor. - Yeah.
you're a gorgeous girl. Beautiful, beautiful face.
you're tall. You have a lot of good things going for you.
however, I do think you have to work on your body tremendously.
a model's product is their physical being.
you have to work on that just like I have to work on my photographs.
I don't think you're working hard enough, not even close.
we're not holding you to a standard that is normal for human beings.
you're models. It's different.
I know this has been a long journey for you, and I'm telling you, Holly, with the results of the competition, whether you win or not, every agency in the united states is going to want to represent you.
that's for sure.
I hope so. That was my goal.
the $100, 000 and "GQ" was perfect, but I just want to work.
that makes me happy.
all right, thank you, Holly.
okay, last but not least, Perry.
in your catwalk, I still noticed a little bit of head bob.
just be conscious of that.
I'll keep working on that.
in the photo shoot, I walked into the gallery last night and my jaw dropped.
Matthew said we were going to be naked, and by the way, you're going to pull the tuck job deal and pull it back.
we have all done it, junior high, high school. Don't deny it.
we have all done it.
I looked at it as a challenge, which is something I want to do every week.
I want it to be tough as hell.
I was impressed by not only the image, but the strength of your personality.
I think that you've got some guts.
thank you.
I want to ask you a question.
do you feel you have a genre of modeling or type you feel you fit into?
not at all.
I don't want to be, oh, your commercial or you're editorial, you're runway.
I want to do it all.
you certainly did that for me.
you took on a role, and you fully inhabited it.
Perry, over the last 11 weeks, what's the most important thing you have learned from this whole experience?
to trust myself, believe in myself.
I have had a lot of crap happen, you know?
had a lot of ups and downs, a lot of personal things.
in the end, at the end of the day, as long as I'm comfortable with who I am and believe in myself,
I can't go wrong.
thank you, models.
please leave the catwalk while we evaluate your work.
so, let's talk about Ben.
I think Ben did great this week.
on the catwalk and in his photo shoot.
I was a little disappointed in the catwalk. It was really flat.
Really?
it was a little cardboardy.
I would agree. - I totally disagree.
the moment he came out, I thought he demanded presence, which is a first.
I disagree with that.
as he was walking, he was stiff.
he has potential, and Ben has been to Boot Camp Model 101, whatever you want to call it, for three months.
he was a prison guard to this.
to this. To this.
if I was casting for a fragrance campaign tomorrow and I needed a sexy guy with a great body,
I would cast him.
what about Holly?
she did really well on the catwalk, as she usually does.
did I think she did well in the photo shoot? I think she did.
this is a beautiful girl with a beautiful face.
I didn't think this was her strongest catwalk this week.
she didn't even work the clothes.
something should have been happening.
overall, how did Perry do this week?
I think Perry did great this week.
he's been able to shift to the arrogance and work it towards his advantage and really explain where he's coming from.
that arrogance is not arrogance. It's confidence.
so many jobs lately, you know, I have to put these kids on video because the photographer want to see that they can move.
and can Perry do that? Absolutely.
but if he's the most diverse with the acting skills he has, that can transgress into roles, why can't he be the supermodel?
I don't see Perry being able to do a fragrance campaign.
do his shoulders bother you?
because I feel like his proportions are a little strange.
his shoulder are completely like this.
would you cast him in something that would require him to wear a suit?
no, I would not.
he's shown us a little bit of versatility.
he looks fantastic in the shoot, yet, he is who he is.
he's the Chicago sort of beefy guy who has been delivering that lately.
but, I tell you one thing.
he's going to make a lot of money.
Yes, he will.
what a trip to get here.
all right, let's bring the models out.
there are four models standing before us.
four incredible people who showed us a commitment, a professionalism, and a beauty that says I can be made into a supermodel.
Ben, your growth as a person and a model has been extraordinary.
it's not hard to picture that face and body in a high-end fragrance campaign.
Ronnie, you are articulate, charming, and willing to learn.
you're without a doubt a great ambassador for the fashion industry.
Holly, you have a flawless face, and a clear passion for the fashion industry.
Perry, you're charismatic and ambitious, and your ability to inhabit a role will make you a great model.
who wins is now out of our hands.
it's up to America to decide who will be made into a supermodel.
guys, good luck.
you may leave the catwalk.
Shannon, we cannot make you a supermodel.
what's up?
Hi, there is a huge story about me that has blown up in the media that is not true and you have to understand right now.
Hola, chica! Come here, mama!
miss Naomi Campbell.
this photo shoot is really important because it's the last thing that America is going to see before they vote.
Ben, Ronnie, Perry, and Holly, who wins is now out of our hands.
it's up to America to decide who will be made into a supermodel.
after 12 weeks, America's favorite four aspiring models remain.
tonight, one will win a contract with New York model management, $100, 000, and a fashion pictorial in GQ magazine.
this is it.
the votes are in, and it's time to find out who America made into a supermodel.
Hi, models. - Hi, Niki.
there are four of you left.
america voted and has made one of you a supermodel.
very soon someone's life is gonna change forever.
but until we find out who the winner is, we have one last job for you.
we thought it would be a good idea to give you a taste of what a working model's day is like.
so, your final assignment is to impress potential clients at a series of go-sees around the city.
go-sees are an important part of being a working model.
making a great impression for casting agencies, designers, and photographers is the key to getting booked.
I have a survival pack for you.
it's your schedule, map, and some money.
you guys have to take your portfolio.
remember to be on time and be professional.
Perry... okay.
you guys have a busy day ahead of you, so get going. Have fun.
is there a "you are here" thing or...?
hm, I don't know where to go.
Oh, my god.
we're getting ready to run out the door to our first casting, which I have no idea where the hell it is.
so, hopefully some New Yorkers are gonna be nice to me and, uh, maybe tell me where to get off the subway.
I have to be on time, because if you're not on time that looks worse to a client.
Hey, do you know where 62nd grand street is?
I'm more nervous trying to find the place than I am the actual casting.
cause you don't wanna, like, miss it.
you know, you don't wanna be late.
Yeah, I'll be there in like...
Yeah, a couple of minutes.
Hello, I'm Jennifer. - I'm Shawuan.
nice to meet you, - Nice to meet you.
that's a beautiful name. - Welcome to esprit.
thank you so much.
I think Ben is on his way, so... - okay, great, why don't we have a seat?
we're really looking for someone who exudes the embodiment of free.
obviously, somebody not too edgy.
hello. - Shawuan, this is Ben.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
welcome to esprit. - Thank you very much.
we want our models to have a little bit of a sex appeal, but still wholesome, if that'S...
it's not overly sexy.
so, I think he has a great look.
so, I'm really curious to see him come out with the clothing.
I want you to walk towards me.
okay, let's try on the second look.
Ben's first walk when he first came out was a little slow.
I think it's just a matter of his energy level picking up.
in this walk, give her what she's looking for.
think energetic. Smile, smile.
that was like a different person.
the first time you came out.
I was really iffy about you, but you definitely took direction, and once you started smiling I saw your energy level pick up.
a different person. I thought you were great.
I would hire Ben. Ben has that esprit look.
when, uh, Shawuan told me she would book me for the campaign for esprit, I was excited.
having that affirmation made me feel fantastic.
the casting is-is super important.
it's your one chance to show the client that you are the brand.
you are what they're looking for.
Hi, Perry, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
this is all pre-hair.
Pre-hair? - Pre-hair.
do you enjoy doing runway more or photography?
I would say runway. Runway is more...it's like live.
okay, um, I'm just gonna have you show me your walk.
right away you can tell Perry's look is a bit edgy.
um, sexy, but I think definitely great for a runway and editorial.
she didn't say very much, but I don't know.
I don't know what to think of that.
I just need to get to the next one.
hello. - Hi, I'm Rebecca Beeson.
Rebecca, it's a pleasure. - Nice to meet you.
beeson is modern, sexy, and cool.
today, Ronnie, basically I-I just want it to be a little happier.
a little more fun.
uh, show me some sassiness, some attitude. - All right.
my first impression was not favorable.
he-he just didn't have the edge.
this is better.
you do the same pose and the same look and the same head turn every time you get to the end of the runway.
it's adding to make it look like you're thinking really hard about this.
thank you, Ronnie.
thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
he just needs to be slapped around a bit.
I don't feel like he's really the-the Beeson look.
but, um, I think he's a good model.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
clearly, Holly is beautiful.
she has a great face.
um, great expression.
I think Holly actually had the best first impression.
I mean, you actually have a really good look.
um, exactly what we're looking for.
I would absolutely hire you.
Oh, can I have a hug for that? - Of course.
well, look who it is.
what's up, Holly bear?
how has today been for you?
it's going good.
did you get lost at all?
Yeah, a little bit.
me, too, I had no idea. - I have one more, though.
I have one more casting. - Good luck.
Bye!
I did really good!
and to hear someone say that they would book me is, like, amazing.
hello.
Hi, Ben. - How are you doing?
Hi, I'm Kevin, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
hi buddy, I'm Jason.
so, Ginch Gonch prides itself on having that young, zestful, kind of weird, wacky, crazy stuff that you do.
uh, the things you forget when you're an adult.
well, why don't we get you into it?
all right, yeah.
uh, first impression is cute, a little nervous.
I think he's, uh, obviously very-- - he's got a great smile.
he does have a great smile.
so we have to see whether or not he's got the Ginch Gonch qualities.
so, just have a little bit more fun.
confidence, that arrogance.
not bad, but let's see what you can do with the prop.
I felt like saying,"are you f-in' kidding me?
okay, become a monkey for me.
you want me to dance around like a monkey with a banana in my hand?
come on. Really.
and I just did some stupid little thing, you know.
give up my dignity for their laughter.
Thanks, Ben.
thanks really much for coming out.
thank you for seeing me. - No problem.
thank you very much, Ben. - Thanks, man, a pleasure.
he's a decent-looking guy.
I think he comes across as being sexual.
uh, but... I don't know.
I just don't think that he carried it as far as he could've, and he didn't do for our product exactly what we're looking for.
my spidy senses tell me that I'm in the right direction.
so, a little bit of arrogance.
it suits you, I think, but... - it's not bad, it's not...
no, it's not offending me yet.
okay, cool.
you've got a few minutes, though.
cause you don't want to walk into a cast and come in like I'm better than you.
you guys can't touch me.
are you telling me that... because
no, I'm telling you my observation. - Oh, okay.
no, god, no, no.
I'm like 'cause I've already got a job.
I know, I know.
perry's a no-brainer.
I think he's great.
he's beautiful. He's charming.
but he doesn't listen.
he talked over me constantly, which I found really funny,'cause we were just one-on-one.
but in a work situation, he would've driven me mad.
I would've asked him to leave.
and I wouldn't feel bad sending his images, without the talking, to a client.
whether he could get re-booked...
a whole other question, because whether I would want to have to listen to him again for another 20 minutes talk about himself and what he knows, that's a whole other question.
um, it's funny, because the first one to the - to the last one, they were so different, you know, and so you got a mixture of every single thing,
I think, that, um, you could go on a casting for.
after today, I feel like I'm definitely ready to go on go-sees.
hello.
are you uncomfortable with being around people, other guys, touching you?
Oh, no, not at all.
not other guys? - Not at all.
well, let's get you in some underwear. - Okay.
all right.
ready for a look-see. - Those are cute, huh?
I love 'em. - Cool.
very cute.
well, let's see whether or not you can be a monkey.
let's do... a monkey?
can I have a banana for a prop of something?
Yeah, we were gonna give you a banana.
let's see what you can do.
I was a little confused, because so many people want one thing and then it's a contradiction and they want the other.
nice, thank you very much for coming down and seeing us. - Thank you, it was a pleasure.
I wasn't exactly getting clear direction.
he did a good job.
he followed direction well.
and in the end, I think he-he delivered and, uh, I was quite impressed.
so we're gonna do a little audition for hair color.
so, let me hear you do that line.
wow, what a difference a little color makes.
use your whole voice for me. And go.
wow, what a difference a little color makes.
convince me...
that you really believe it's made a difference.
what's happened?
wow, what a difference a little color makes!
wow, what a difference a little color makes!
nice job. - A really nice job.
thank you, yeah!
I think holly is adorable.
her instincts in front of a camera are excellent.
she needs voice lessons desperately.
her voice range is much too high, and she has a regional accent.
but you know what?
that's why there are teachers who can help her get rid of that.
I thought they liked me, but it took a few, you know, a few tries to really get into what they wanted me to do.
but I felt like I finally got it, and I hope they choose me.
um, I've learned that one aspect of modeling is, you know, being personable with clients and things like that and wanting them to re-book you, especially when you get a go-see.
so I hope I did well enough to get some call backs and, you know, go from there.
I was like,"damn, who the hell is comin'?" How are you doing?
models, meeting with Jennifer at the Caledonia.
leave in ten minutes.
are you serious? - Yeah.
Hey, guys.
it's Jessica Stam!
I'd like you to meet Jessica Stam, who is one of IMG's top supermodels.
Holly was like,"oh, my god, it's Jessica Stam!
and I was like I don't really know her name, but she's gorgeous, and her eyes, like, are just piercing.
Jess, I don't know if you know, but I think Holly is your biggest fan.
I think - I think she knows just about everything about you.
you're Jessica Stam from Canada.
you're, uh, the face of BCBG.
like, you're in every major fashion show around.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as Jessica Stam, the face of Dior.
well, you know, I grew up on a farm in Canada, so fashion magazines weren't readily available.
I live on a farm. - You did?
Yeah, in Virginia.
she probably thinks I'm weird, but she's amazing, and she's so beautiful, and I can't believe I actually got the chance to meet her.
you know, being a supermodel is about more than just fame.
you know, it's something you really have to work for.
you have to kind of, you know, dedicate your-your life to.
um, you might work with a photographer who teaches you how to move in a certain way, and you kind of store that information up here.
and to be a supermodel you have to be professional.
you have to be versatile.
you have to be able to drop everything at a moment's notice to fly to, you know, Taiwan or Paris or-or Morocco.
you know, you have to really learn to take care of yourselves.
you know, drink lots of water.
go to bed early.
just really take care of you.
have you found it difficult or impossible to handle, like, personal relationships, like, while doing this and being so busy?
you know, I-I try to keep my friendships, you know, separate from my work and, um, you know, I do
I mean like a "B. F.
I think communication and just, you know, making time for the people who you really care about when you - when you are at home is, - you know, it's really important. - Right.
I was just... I was like wow.
this girl is beautiful.
um, you know, her eyes were just like... they're amazing.
I invited her over for drinks, but, you know, I don't know if she's gonna come.
Jess, thank you so much for joining us. - Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, thanks, guys. It was a pleasure to meet you all.
and I wish you the best of luck. - Thank you.
Bye, it was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you.
I can't believe I met her!
it's so amazing. Yes!
Hey, models, come on downstairs!
Hi, models.
as you know, GQ is offering the winner a photo pictorial in their magazine.
well, they want to meet you at their Conde Nast office.
models, this is very important.
make a great impression, because one of you will be in their pages very soon.
good luck.
when Niki said one of us will grace the pages of GQ, that really brought it home for me.
now, like, I really see myself as possibly being a supermodel.
welcome to GQ.
Hi, guys and girl. How are you?
you're in the GQ fashion closet.
where Jude Law, Jessica Alba, Ben Affleck, everybody's-everybody's been here.
we do feel like at GQ the suit, the clothes, just have to fit perfectly, so we spend a lot of time getting the fit down.
we have a different look for each of you guys, whether it's a suit, whether it's an athletic thing.
you guys ready? - Let's do it.
ready to do it?
all right, Perry, we're gonna start with you.
all right, cool. - Let's do this thing.
I'm thinking like Perry's a suit guy.
let's see how this jacket fits.
Yeah, that's gonna be too small for you.
Perry, he is a difficult fit.
you know, he looks like this tall, skinny guy who is gonna fit into everything, but he does have these really broad shoulders.
Yes, dude, you're too buff.
I know, I've been working out, man. - You're too ripped.
we thought he'd be perfect for a suit story.
after we fit him, we realized he's not perfect for a suit story.
I think we like him as a model still, and he's someone we'd like to get in the magazine, but not the way we originally anticipated.
we're kinda thinking for this particular fitting a take on the little black dress.
I wonder if the waist is too high.
it doesn't have... maybe the shoes don't have to be quite as high.
well, she looked a little uncomfortable.
she didn't look sexy.
I think the top looks supermodel.
the bottom looks a little bit too basketball team.
let's try the... this pink number.
let's change your shoes to silver.
Ronnie equals Ralph Lauren, basically.
you know, Ronnie is Ralph and then...
so that's the look we got going for you today. - I love Ralph.
all these ones are... they're preppy, but they're cool preppy.
you know what you're getting with Ronnie, and I think that's a good thing in some ways.
he is Mr. All-American. He's great for that Ralph Lauren look.
he threw those clothes on and he looked great.
he made the Ralph Lauren stuff look appropriate but also look hip at the same time.
he's probably the most sample size, I would say, of all the guys, which is definitely important.
a little friendlier.
when we shot the polaroid, all of a sudden he went into this blue steel look where he was trying to look tough, and it's like,"dude, you got a great smile.
you're a fun guy. "Be that guy.
I have to say that, you know, it is a pretty dress, but I think you-you have such beautiful skin and shoulders and I think we're not seeing that.
maybe move on to the - to the lacoste.
I just don't know...I think with, you know, with a magazine like GQ, the guys want sexy, you know?
like that's like the first and foremost element.
and I'm wondering, you know, does she
does she have what it takes to kind of bring that across on a page?
all right, Ben, so for you we're going more of kind of a sporty look, 'cause in our eyes, you're a little bit more athletic ad than you sort of high fashion, euro, runway dude.
Ben I think is great. Ben's got so much personality.
he's funny, he's fun.
I think the challenge with Ben is, can you get that personality on camera?
Ben was, you know, very stiff when we were taking the polaroid.
and I know it's just a polaroid but, you know, these guys have to remember that this polaroid is something we refer to.
the funny thing about a polaroid, it seems insignificant, but that's the polaroid we're showing to the editor-in-chief of the magazine.
and if he doesn't like that polaroid, Ben's not getting in the magazine.
I like that. - That's cute!
I thought Holly ended up doing great.
I don't think she started off that well, but when we found that one dress that worked on her, I think she looked comfortable, she looked sexy, and she looked like a girl you-you want to be with.
fantastic. That's the one.
I think we finally got the right dress on her.
you look awesome, Holly. - Thank you, guys.
thank you, Holly. - Thank you.
of all the guys, uh, I was really dazzled by Perry, just because I think he's - he's got a really cool look.
he's got a little bit of an edge to him.
we gotta get rid of that red hair.
I'm gonna go with Perry, too, but if we get him a haircut, and if we find the right clothes that fit him well.
models, tonight is your last night.
get ready for a surprise visit.
what?
I don't know.
when we saw on the blackboard that special guests were coming to join us, we didn't know who to expect.
I mean, we had already met Naomi Campbell and Jessica Stam.
who else could surprise us?
first thought that popped into my head was family.
you know, I want to - I want to see my wife, but it'll be strange because it's like I've grown, and she's changed at the same time but in different ways, and so it's gonna be interesting to - to see the results of that.
what's up? Hey, baby.
divorce papers
how are you?
what's up?
Hey, baby.
I didn't hear any, like, screams of excitement and joy.
he just said,"what's up?
it was really good to see her, open the door and see her there, and I was just kind of shocked.
I wasn't expecting her to be here.
Oh, my god. I missed you.
I missed you, too, baby.
so what's up? - Oh, my god.
I love you, baby. - I love you, too.
welcome to New York...to my home
I want to see your room.
that is so... I want one.
you can have it.
you're not gonna wear it?
no, it's funny.
I want one.
it was a-a friendship that turned into a bro-mance, apparently.
Yes, yes. I would say so.
but it was... it's just harmless.
Oh, I know, it's funny.
he's just... he's my boy.
so, what's up?
I don't know.
first, when I saw Ben greet his, uh, wife I was a little confused.
he was like,"what's up?
I was just like, if you - if you told me that after three months,
I'd probably slap you in the face.
I can't believe some of the stuff that you've done.
I'm like ready for everything to be over and for it to be normal again.
Yeah, well
things have changed... a lot.
aren't you guys gonna come join us downstairs?
april, meet my other half.
awkward!
well, tonight, I met Ben's wife, April, and that was, uh, it was an interesting moment to say the least.
she's meeting Ronnie.
the relationship.
Oh, yeah. - Bronnie.
did you see our Bronnie shirt?
Yeah, he just showed me, I want one so bad.
I was a little apprehensive about meeting April, just because I wasn't sure how our friendship was being portrayed or how she would react to our kind of, like, silliness and flirtiness.
so, has it been hard being away for so long?
Yes. - Having Ben away from you?
Yeah.
I opened the door and my mom was standing on the other side with a big smile and tears in her eyes.
you know, it's been three months since we've seen each other.
this is Ben's wife, April.
Oh, April, oh, gosh.
we have to talk... - Yes.
Oh, gosh.
they're just friends.
gosh. Ray, he is so gorgeous.
like, you have no idea.
I had forgotten how cute he was.
you're so hot!
this is my fiance!
how is going?
Ben
Oh, my god! Look at this place.
open it up. Okay.
I wanted to get you somethin' to, uh... - to what?
so you could think about me for this next little bit.
present, present, present!
to add to our collection.
isn't my fiancee hot? Look at him you're so hot, dude.
I don't... ask Ronnie.
sorry, guys. - No, no.
it's been a while, man. - Go at it, dude.
there's-there's a bedroom upstairs.
but your mom and Tiffany say they're so incredibly proud of you and they love you so much, and you're doing so awesome.
Really? - We'll be over there in a second, guys.
Hey, dude, trust me. I understand.
just-just do it.
just say what you gotta say.
kiss as much as you gotta kiss.
Ben got his wife, Holly got her fiance, and-and Ronnie got his, uh, his mother, and I was like,"damn, who the hell is comin'?
I'm fine. I just would like to see...
you know what I'm saying. Everybody's got somebody.
I would like to see my mom or my best friends.
in the back of mind I thought, well, maybe I might not even have anybody come.
and...
I was like, what if it is Amanda?
you know, what's gonna happen?
how are you? - Good.
how are you doing? - Good.
and I opened up the door and-and there she is standing right in front of me, you know?
and it was just like this-this moment of shock.
I don't know if I was happy or sad.
I was - I was just confused.
how are you? - Good.
you look so good.
you look good. It's been so long.
what's up?
do you love me?
Yes...do you love me?
this has been - this has been the hardest thing I've ever had to go through in my life.
I love you. - I love you.
I miss you. - I miss you.
God, girl.
I don't...I just don't know if you were true to me or not...
I love you
were you?
I love you. - I know that
I don't want to talk about any of this right now.
okay? - I don't know what to do.
I know... please?
you don't realize all the stuff that I've had to go through on this show.
you don't realize what I've had to go through...
being alone in LA...by myself.
but you knew I was gonna come back to you.
I just have one question to ask you...
...and that's if you were with that guy?
I need you to answer that.
please, trust me...
do you love me?
I love you, and I care about you, and I miss you like crazy...
do you want to be with me?
Yes...quit this crap...
everybody, this is Amanda.
this is Holly
this is when Perry walked in holding hands with Amanda, I really didn't know what to think.
I mean, this was the girl that was supposedly cheating on him with Britney's boyfriend.
you are beautiful.
Oh, my god!
thank you so much. - Hey, Ronnie, knock it off.
Hi, Ronnie. How are you?
we're gonna start making, uh, some love here.
you just mind yourselves. - Oh, gosh, here we go, again.
sitting across from Perry and Amanda, seeing the frustration in their eyes, trying to work through things, made me happy that I am a single man.
we'll talk later.
we have to...
God gives us these oppprtunities...
...in whatever strange way they are...
...to test us.
to show how much we love each other.
in face I told Ben and April...before you got here...
I told them that, like if Amanda comes here...
I'll show me that she loves me...
...and that she's a fighter.
and you showed up here.
and it's not about me...it's not about you...
it's about us.
and it's about figuring out this crazy world together.
people are so mean.
people do whatever they can to make money.
I will do anything for you.
I just pray to God that you will do the same.
I do. - Give me a kiss.
we'll figure it all out. Stop crying.
if I win, like, what will you, like, what's gonna happen, like?
I'm gonna follow you wherever you go.
I made you that promise...
I'm here for you.
this is something that we're in together.
it's not just a one person thing.
it's gonna be okay.
how does it feel to be in New York? You know, I mean
it was weird staying in the hotel, like, two blocks away and, uh, knowing that you were so close.
I mean, is it some place you'd wanna move? Do you like it here?
Yeah, I'd love to live here.
I just want to be a part of it.
like, I'm tired of watching it and, like, not being able to talk to you and...
it was kind of awkward seeing her, just because it's only been three months, but three months is a long time, and what we've done has felt like three years.
to watch the transformation it's, like, it's unreal.
and, like, I would watch you on TV and just be like, "is that my husband?"Like...
are you gonna be upset when it's over? - No.
you're ready now? - Yeah. I've been ready.
you have been the one that has supported me no matter what, and being here and knowing that
I had you at home watching and praying and hoping for me, like...
I've always been second best...
that's why you're gonna be number one. I don't wanna go.
I don't want you to go either.
no matter how bad of a day I've had, or how difficult of a challenge I've been facing, like, she's the one that says, "no matter what, you know,"you're a winner, and I love you.
but, um, I love you. - I love you.
we realized that we do love each other more than anything and there's nothing in this world that can bring us down, whether it - whether it's a lie, whether it's the truth, whether...
whatever the case is.
and-and I-I-I found that out tonight.
are we boyfriend and girlfriend?
Yeah...will you go out with me?
I'm being serious right now...
will you go out with me?
I'm gonna see you at home.
promise?
say it...
no looking back.
okay?
I love you so much.
I love you too.
you look great, okay? Just be strong.
I love you, baby. - I love you so much, baby.
that's a cruel trick!
cruel and unusual punishment.
we're all good.
so you guys worked through? - Yeah.
you know, love conquers everything.
this is a huge test and somehow...
it's very trying.
Oh, this is the biggest test that I believe that any relationship would ever go through.
I feel like I'm 90 years old, - and I'm stressed out so much. - Oh, my god.
after we get outta here, we're all gonna look so much better.
the stress will just leave us.
everything is right with Amanda.
everything is right in this house.
we're the final four in this entire country.
and it's our last night!
and this is our last night here.
it's-it's all over.
it's our last night together. - It feels very good, though.
I love you guys. - Group hug.
I love you guys. - Group hug.
america voted one final time.
here is their decision.
this is the biggest day.
I find out who wins today.
in the three months that I've been here, it all comes down to today.
how do you feel about last night?
good.
so, like, when we were all getting ready and, like, you went downstairs and saw April at the door, how did you feel?
I don't know what I was expecting, or who I was expecting, or anything like that but, um, yeah, it definitely wasn't that.
Yeah, I was kind of in shock.
it's incredible how long we've spent here.
it's kind of like a sobering feeling.
we've had so many great times in this room.
I'm gonna miss going to bed every night and just calling over to Ben and being like, "so, how was your day?
you know,"what's up?
we've been here for three months, man.
this was our home for three months.
I'm just glad that we got to share the same room together.
I'm sad...
Yes, I'm sad, because we had so many memories here.
like, so many conversations, like, with each other, like...
it's just... I'm gonna miss it. I know I will.
even though, like, I...
these boys bash on me and I bash on them, like, I-I'll miss 'em.
I know I will.
we've got yet one more catwalk.
this catwalk is to show America that they picked the right person
that they're proud of that person.
it's our one last chance to show America what we have learned and how we've grown.
more so than anything, I think it's one more chance for us to have fun and to enjoy what we've been doing over these past 12 weeks.
uh, I'm just a little nervous just because it's just...
you don't know the unknown.
america has voted.
I'm fairly confident that, you know, um, I'll be the last one standing up there.
d and G is like my dream and I'm getting to walk in it, so I'll walk out there with confidence and just have a great time with it.
I mean, I was a little sad doing a finale walk because we've been out on that catwalk for three months.
a lot of memories out there.
you know, a lot of ups and a lot of downs.
it was, uh, it was a good thing.
it was the last time that I'd get to walk in front of the panel and it's a special moment.
normally, when I walk down to the end of the runway, I don't make eye contact with any of 'em.
this time I went down and I looked at every single one of 'em.
kind of like a thank you for giving me this chance.
just going out there on the catwalk again for the last time there was nothing to think about.
it was just like very peaceful.
this is my favorite catwalk yet, and it's just been a great journey.
it was a lot of fun.
it was the last walk of the show.
I had no stress, really.
just walking down the panel and knowing that, you know,
I've come this far, and it's just been an incredible journey.
it's been an incredible trip.
okay, models, we want to tell you what an incredible journey this has been for all of us.
you guys have learned a lot.
you have risen to challenges with grace and class, and I look forward to seeing all of you on a cover of a magazine.
thank you.
thanks for giving it 100 percent, and thanks for making us proud of you.
the four of you deserve to be there.
I'm proud of all four of you, because you've all taken a different journey to get where you are.
a prison guard, who had to catch up with the rest of the contestants to get to where he is at right now.
the gay activist, who, uh, managed to diversify his look and managed to, uh, change his catwalk to get to where he is.
the quiet one, who had to prove to herself that she can tough it out against the boys.
the actor turned model, who did it with grace and who made us laugh so much.
thank you all.
it's been a long 12 weeks for you guys, and I just want to salute you because it is a lot to learn in such a short period of time.
I'm really proud of all of you.
it's been 12 weeks of spectacular photo shoots, couture catwalks, and a taste of the New York fashion life.
and it all comes down to this.
america voted one final time on the alltel wireless phone lines.
here is their decision.
one of you is leaving the catwalk right now.
we cannot make you a supermodel. I'm sorry.
you can say your goodbyes.
I just want to thank you guys for this opportunity.
it's been, I mean, the most amazing journey I've ever been a part of.
and, uh, I really appreciate you guys sticking with me and believing in me.
it means a lot to me. Thank you.
good luck.
back to the drawing board.
it's not gonna stop me.
you know, everything happens for a reason, and I bet everything that I have that once I get out to New York that something bigger than I thought ever could happen is gonna happen.
and I believe that.
your bro-mance is over.
one of you is leaving the catwalk.
we cannot make you a supermodel. I'm sorry.
well, thank you all very much.
you know, it's been priceless.
I can't even explain in words how amazing this journey has been.
from everything, you know, just what I was to what I am now is awesome, and thank you all for helping.
and, you know, everyone who has been a part of it is awesome.
so, thank you all.
Thanks, Ben.
just because I didn't win the title or win the money or anything like that doesn't mean I'm not gonna do well in this industry.
I'm gonna hit it full force as soon as I come out here.
you know, I'm gonna stay in this game. I'm gonna...
whoever wins, I'm gonna try and pass them up.
that's my goal.
I just find it hard to believe that Holly beat me out!
I know.
Holly beat you out.
Yeah!
I think she's coming out.
Holly, it's been an amazing journey for you.
Ronnie, you've come so far since we first met you.
america voted and has made one of you a supermodel.
you will win $100, 000, the contract for New York model management, and the photo pictorial in GQ magazine.
america voted and has made one of you a supermodel.
america has made you a supermodel. Congratulations.
Oh, my god.
well done, well done.
congratulations, Holly.
Oh, my god. - Thank you all very much.
thank you, Ronnie. - thank you.
Congratulations.
congratulations, Holly.
you did it, you're strong. You're here.
welcome to New York model management.
I can't believe it!
you won $100, 000. - What's the first thing you want to do?
call my parents.
all my dreams have came true.
like, this-this is what I worked for.
this is my whole life and it finally happened for me, and I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I can't wait to see my parents' face.
I can't wait to see my fiance's face when-when they see that I won.
I won "make me a supermodel"!
america, thank you for just making my dreams come true.
you did it! Thank you so much.
growing up in the streets ain 't no joke.
there're crazy crime, drugs,and mad violence.
Yeah, the streets are tough.
but there ain 't no streets tougher than mine. The streets of Malibu.
it's just part of the everyday struggle.
things go down here people should never see.
we got bag ladies,big ballers。Everybody strapped with a 9.
this is my ghetto. The mall.
most of the time the police won 't even come through.
we got all sorts of sets up in here.
we got the beach boys, the A CCs: the Abused Children of Celebrities, and this is my crew.
that's my boy Mocha. That brother straight-up crazy.
he did time in public school!
that there is Hadji. He's the Beast from the Middle East.
and that's Monster. She had a big chip on her shoulders till she ate it.
Hey, that's me! B-Rad.
I run things around here.
now, sometimes busts be disrespecting.
and you can 't punk out, no matter what the devil may bring.
Hey, you, fool! We're about to have some hardcore dramas go down right about now!
that's right!
this our mall. Always have been, always will be.
Mr. Amerislani.
our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles.
here you go!
you validate parking? - Of course, sir.
that's what I'm talking about! We get ours!
that's my crib.
it ain 't much, but it's all I got.
if you elect me governor...
that's my pop, Bill Gluckman.
he getting his campaign on.
I got mad love for the man, but he's old-school.
he needs to bring his word to the street. That's why I come in.
you see, friends, California is my family.
and speaking of family, I want to introduce my wife, Bess.
and my daughter, little Brenda.
Where's your son Brad? - Yes, sir, where is he?
thank you for your questions. Unfortunately, we are out of time for today.
yo, what's up,y'all? This is B-Rad.
Represent!
Hi, Pop, it's me! B-Rad!
Hi, Brad.
show's over! That's it. Show's over!
see that? I know how to get the party started!
and I know my pop was loving it.
it's a disaster!
the Times and the Chronicle will run it as a big joke.
thank God! - How did this happen?
I have no idea. I didn't even know he was in town!
we can't keep tabs on this kid? Can anybody tell me where he is?
that was off the hinges!
I just got you another million votes right there!
what are you doing here, son?
I knew I had to show up in order for you to blow up!
so I called up Captain Tony, he fired up the Lear jizzy, and boo-yah! I'm in the hizzy.
I'll be on the campaign trizzy too. 24/7.
you know, kissing babies and whatnot.
pound it.
Yeah, all good. Tom, you down, you got...
okay, dude. I'll let you all do your campaign thing.
Oh, Bill...You need to shut this down.
tell your son that he cannot be in your campaign period.
wait a minute. I love his enthusiasm. He's a little misguided, but...
isn't there something he can do for the campaign where he can't hurt us?
no.
phones? - No.
stuffing envelopes? Making signs?
signs.
in Bill Gluckman's administration, women are going to have better health care.
women are going to have better daycare!
and women will have better jobs!
in fact, after today, my campaign has a new slogan:
bill Gluckman is down with the bitches and the homo's?
it was supposed to have read 'Women are first' with Gluckman.
no, no. That's old-school, Pop.
you need to keep your pimp hand strong.
so, Bradley...
yo, why you keep calling me that?
well, that's your name, isn't it?
it's my slave name, all right?
I told you like 50 times!
okay.
B-Rad.
what's up?
what are your goals, B-Rad? What do you want out of life?
to be the biggest rapper there ever was.
you see, doc, I got something to say and I need the world to hear it.
I'm a 'lyrisologist'.
I can rap about anything.
see? I'm the shiznit! I'll buy y'all cars.
I see.
when did you first start feeling like you were this shiznit?
Oh, way back in the day.
I had these beats in my head since I was a little shorty.
from then on in, it was hip-hop.
as I was growing up, my parents and I couldn't communicate.
they were always on different channels.
finish those vegetables, Bradley. They smell good.
you won 't be excused until you do.
forget y'all!
that's it, Mister.
what I' m sensing, Brad, is that your parents weren ' t always there for you.
no. - That's ridiculous.
what about your bar mitzvah?
what's the theme of your bar mitzvah? Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes?
it's O. P.P. bitch! -What?
Bess.
I think you want to share.
B-Rad, you're a wonderful son. It's just that...
well...
Bess, let's not beat around the bush.
Brad, your behavior has become an embarrassment to the family.
don't be hating.
and I can't have you on the campaign anymore.
what? That's how it is? You done it now!
y'all opened up big a can of tough love!
what can we do, doctor? - I don't know.
this is the most advanced case of 'gangsta-phrenia' I've ever seen.
three colors for our country. Where's the red?
bill! Hey, Bill.
how'd it go with Dr. Feldman? - Great.
if he sees Brad five times a week for the next three or four years, we should see some real improvement.
but, sir, the election is eight weeks away.
right, good point. -It's okay.
we've been brainstorming some different approaches and we might have something solid. -Well, I'm all ears.
go! -Okay, sir.
Brad acts ghetto, right?
but he's never been east of Beverly Hills.
but what if we give him a little dose of reality?
let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto.
you mean have Brad actually go there? - Exactly.
well, now, that sounds dangerous. - No! Perfectly safe.
how's it work? - We hire actors to play gangsters.
right. They will carjack Brad and take him on a tour around the 'hood'.
give him a taste of what the thug life is really like.
lt might just scare the black out of him. - Excuse me?
Hey, don't you have something to do?
enough of the P. C.
fact is, unless we do something now, Brad is going to cost us this election.
who would play the gangsters?
remember the anti-crime spot we shot a month ago?
we've got that queued up. - Yes, we do. Over here, please.
for too long, street violence has torn Californians apart.
bill Gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us.
Hey, instead of thinking about what set you're from or what crew you 're rolling with. Why don 't you both be brothers?
what do you say?
your hair looks great.
I ain't never thought of it like that.
shake hands.
you see?
california is my family.
if we all work together as a family, there's no telling how high we can go.
see, that's beautiful. These are the guys we're talking about.
all right, let me get this straight.
you want us to scare this kid into acting like a little white boy again?
if you don't think you can handle it.
of course we can handle it.
I'm Juilliard, for Chrissake. - I'm from the Pasadena Playhouse.
good.
I have some background information on our dear boy Brad.
materials.
Mali-bootay?
Yes, he considers himself a rapper of sorts.
Frigging. - The story is your basic kidnapping.
by kidnapping, you mean we hold him for ransom?
good question.
right.
now, when you see him start to get ghetto and do his whole black thing--Yes, that.
I want it to piss you off.
tour him around the 'hood', around the ghetto, if you will, and show him what it's really like. -ln the ghetto?
pays 1.5 grand apiece, son.
we're in. - Good.
now, on the flip side... - Flip it.
if you two screw up and a single hair is touched on Brad's over privileged head, I will see to it personally that you two do some serious time.
are we clear? - Oh, we are Cristal.
I like that.
Mr. Gibbons.
what about the money?
we have 5% up front and the rest 25% when you return him to us as white.
as the driven snow.
pleasure doing business, gentlemen. - Let me get that for you, sir.
I'll call you. Or better yet, I'll holler.
we'll holler back! -Holler back, player.
thank you. All right.
congratulations, buddy! We just booked another gig!
not so fast, this is dangerous stuff.
this is the ghetto. We could get shot! - Come on, man.
we can handle ourselves. Right?
this will be the ultimate acting challenge.
you know what really chaps my ass? - What?
after all of our years of training and studying, they continue to give us parts that are gangsters.
just once I'd like to play someone who speaks with proper grammar and doesn't wear those Timberlands with the laces undone, it's so sloppy.
it beats getting dunked on by Bill Gluckman!
do we even know anybody that lives in the ghetto?
my cousin.
Shondra.
that's the stupidest thing I ever heard. I got better things to do with my time.
like what? Work at Wiener On A Bun? Come on!
really, you're always talking about improving yourself.
here's your chance! - I am improving myself, fool!
I broke up with no-good, gangbanging Tec, I'm going to beauty school and then I'm gonna hook up my own salon.
how about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and fries?
shut up, stupid.
What？
you need to do this.
you need to walk away from this minimum-wage crap, take these earnings and start that beauty parlor.
what you paying? - Business. We're in business.
a grand. -We're paying a grand.
make it trey and we on. - Three thousand dollars?!
or you can kiss my ass.
deal. -Hey, hey.
deal. Now what about those fries?
thank you.
Hey, Gladys? - Yeah, baby?
you ever feel like you don't belong?
all the time.
most folk only feel comfortable around folk that's the same as them.
they get around folk that's different get all scared and angry, want to keep them down.
what do you do about it?
nothing to do but keep it real and be proud of who you are.
Gladys?
when they gonna leave our people alone?
I don't know, baby.
I just don't know.
now eat your greens before they get cold.
Whack: Weak, of poor quality.
bad whack.
your Alma mater is whack.
Dis: To disrespect, to embarrass.
bring it on, baby. - We are strapped now, brother!
set these bad boys down.
this is exactly what we ordered?
Yeah, man. They got the Glocks, the Tec-9s, the Uzis.
freeze, sucker! -That's convincing, brother!
look, they're fake.
what the hell is that? What's going on with your hair?
Yeah, check it out, man, my hair.
Shondra just did it for me. -Yeah, I see that.
you hate it. - No, I don't hate it.
I thought my character was gonna have the cornrows.
that's all. - Okay, I see what it is.
you're just jealous because you didn't think of it first.

I'm sorry, y'all. Don't be hating. -This ain't a game!

we in South Central! It's the 'hood'. It's the ghetto, the projects!
we run hardcore up in here. People get killed here every day!
Hey, Shondra, can you come by later? 'Princess' just had puppies.
okay, Sandy. Bye.
pit bull puppies, fool!
don't look at me! - Come on!
fool, put your hands behind your back. - Behind the back.

I'm about to call your daddy. -Call your daddy.
you better hope your daddy home too. If he ain't, you gonna be one dusted trick!
now get your ass on the bed, whitey!
did you buy my rage? - No. You're indicating.
lndicating? -Yes, indicating.
excuse me? I have never indicated in my life.

she's right. Shut up.
thank you, Shondra. Whatever!
all right, put this down. You're on.
go, girlfriend. Do your thing. -Give me this.
Hey, Shondra.
if you have to show a little ass.
shut up.
you all right in here? - Oh, yeah.
I just been kidnapped, carjacked and hands tied behind my back.
but other than that, it's all good.
look, I'm sorry about all that. That wasn't really my idea.
I thought you liked me.
I do! - Then how come you set me up?
I had to. They threatened to kill me if I didn't play along.
for real? -Yeah.
they straight-up killers out there! - For real?
let me school you on something. Help us both stay alive.
okay. - The one thing they hate more than anything that really makes them crazy is posers. -Me too, girl. I feel you.
I'm talking about you. - Me? I ain't a poser. Shoot.
I got a Ph. D. a Poser-Hater Degree. -Come on, quit fronting.
I ain't fronting.
stop it!
you stop it right now and you listen to me.
if you just be yourself, a nice little white boy, I think I can convince them to let you go. - But I'm being myself!
I ams who I says I ams.
Damn! Why won't anybody believe me?
well? - Maybe you should show him your ass.
I thought that would have worked weird.
all right, what's next?
how about number three? -Perfect.
we're gonna take it to an entirely different level.
I got it. - What?
I'm gonna walk in there and be crazy. I'll be ghettofied, buckwild.
you tell me, "Stick to the plan, man. Stick to the plan." Got it?
wake up, snowflake! - Yeah!
we called your dad! - What did he say?
he said he'd think about it.
he don't want your ass home right now.
I can't say that I blame him. - Hell, no,not the knife, dog!
now come on!
what you doing? - Teach this white girl a lesson!
bloodbath, we said we would stick to the plan!
bloodbath, stick with the plan. -Tree, the plan done changed!
wannabe say he down.
I'm gonna show him just how un-down he is!
I gotta cut him! - No, you can't cut him!
I gotta. - You don't gotta.
we can't get our money!
I thought you said to cut him! -No
okay, just the white meat. -Move! Let me cut him!
don't kill him though, Bloodbath!
all right, now, Malibu.
I want you to go up in there. You go get me six 40s of O. E.
and a fifth of Henny. - Yeah.
anything else, dog? - No, playa, I'm cool.
right on. Right on.
I'd like some Pringles.
this ain't no picnic, bitch!
I'm sorry. Y'all got some ducats? Because since you stole my...
man!
you about to go up in there and give them Koreans your ends?
hell, no! - You jack that shit, fool!
and if the Asiatic give you any static, hit the fool with this right here.
look at the little busta. - Little busta.
can't even swing a gat. - Shoot.
talking about "he down." -But...
you use that or I'm gonna use it on you! - Okay.
and if you try to get away?
I'm gonna let you taste a piece of my blue steel. You feel me?
okay. All right.
go on, get out! - Okay.
go!
Hey, white boy.
this ain't no picnic, bitch! Wow! -Thank you. I loved the blue steel line.
convincing.
I really can't believe that! -Those improving classes are paying off.
when you said, "This is no picnic, bitch," I screamed on the inside like one.
for real? -Yeah, I said:
I'm thirsty, I gotta tell you.
and, boy, do I love Olde English. It really helps quench my thirst.
can I help you?
no, I'm gonna help myself to this O. E. and anything else I want up in here, bitch!
can I help you?
y'all never been robbed? - Sure. Last week was 54 time.
but they were cool. No gun to head, never scream.
you know, good people. - Cool.
so, dude, how much did you pay the guy?
what are you talking about?
when you set this thing up yesterday. - I thought you set it up.
you mean--?
dude, the owner doesn't know this is fake?
$1 6. 47.
go in and save him! He could get shot! - I'm not gonna go in there! You go in there!
his frigging life is at stake!
my emergency stash!
I'm glad you got cash, because if you had tried to jack me, fool, I was gonna have to lay you out with this!
and with this.
and with that.
keep the change.
do me this one favor. - You are the driver. I am the shooter!
I'm scared of Koreans! - You...
thank you. Thank you very much! Come again!
what I'm about to do right now, I know it sounds whack but it's just a joke, okay? So please don't shoot me!
Yeah, that's right, fool! Next time I'll bust a cap in your punk ass, bitch!
Yeah, you lucky I don't burn you down! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!
what the hell is wrong with you? - You actually did it?
let's roll! Hell, yeah! He didn't do nothing! He straight-up trick.
what's up with this? If you jacked it, how come you got a receipt?
I stole that too.
what's on tap for tomorrow?
well, we have the 1 1: 00 with Greenpeace, then drinks later with the offshore oil lobby.
how's the Brad project going? -Smooth. He's in South Central.
God, is he okay? - Oh, he's in excellent hands.
all right. I'm sick of playing game with you, snowflake!
I'm gonna give you five seconds to be real or I'm gonna beat that ass to the curb!
what you mean be real? - You know what I mean. Be white!
five. - Don't do it, Bloodbath!
four. - Don't do it, Bloodbath!
three. -He gonna do it!
two. -Kill him! Kill him!
okay, all right!
okay, fellas, look, I'm really sorry, okay?
I don't mean to offend you, you know. I don't mean to front or act like a thug.
I'm sorry.
you buying that? -I don't know. I can't tell.
me neither.
let's give him the test.
how you doing, white boy? You cool?
great. Fine.
terrific popcorn.
run, bitch, run! He gonna kill you!
I ain't lying. I ain't lying.
sorry, y'all, but this is who I am. I'm just a rapper, straight up.
Wigga, please! - No, for real. I can rap about anything.
you think you got skills?
we gonna see about that. - Oh, hell, yeah.
Hey, man. I had it up to here with you.
you better check yourself before you wreck yourself.
this ain't Malibu. -Represent.
Oh, yeah. We gonna see what you represent now, fool. We at the club!
snoop, Dre, Cube, all them. They came in through here.
got something to prove to yourself? Do it in there.
get in there, fool! Go on up in there!
think this is gonna do it, dude. -Oh, we're about to get paid!
what's cracking?
Hey, dog.
Yeah, how you feeling now, Malibu? - Like I'm home.
get your ass in there then, fool. Go!
come on. Let me get through here, man.
yo. -Man, I told you I didn't have
what's happening?
look, our homey-- You wanna get a young Dre next, man?
hell, no. You hear what he's saying?
meet my boy, Ben Franklin.
what's his name? -B-Rad from Malibu, player.
B-Rad from Malibu? You trying to get me shot?
Hey, you met Ben Franklin's twin brother?
cutter, playa.
we're gonna bring him up. Go back and play with each other. Come back in five minutes.
is there a problem?
Jack Benson was a friend of mine.
I'm -- I'm so sorry.
you were the one in charge, right?
some kind of manager?
uh, he -- he was my friend, too.
Jack's wife said it was your fault. That true?
you know what? Um, never mind.
I think I'm just gonna go somewhere else.
I asked you a question.
stay away from me.
Oh, man! What the hell?
you did that?
no, I -- I swear.
get away from me!
no. Lord, please, not again.
we have a mission.
any specifics?
no.
well, we should follow the same plan as before
take separate routes back, stagger our timing so no one suspects
wait, a telekinetic?
I thought they didn't exist.
we never verified one.
that's why we're going to Batesville
to conduct an index asset evaluation and intake.
does that mean we talk to her and see if she has powers?
basically.
well, that needs a better name
less I. R.S. more...better.
something like the welcome wagon.
I want you to pay close attention on this one, Skye.
it's an opportunity to learn how to deal with someone with newfound abilities.
it's not like I've never done this before.
I found Mike Peterson before you did.
remember how that went?
this is a chance to see how it's done when it's done right.
how many people like this have you encountered?
a handful.
there's not that many people on the index.
they must wig out when they see the S. H. I. E. L. D. trucks roll up.
each case is different.
some people are in complete denial that there's anything unusual about them.
it's a delicate process, and from all reports, this sounds like a particularly sensitive situation.
particle accelerator explodes.
Hannah Hutchins, one of the quality-control engineers.
was it her fault?
the town blames her.
four technicians died in that blast -- on her watch.
that's terrible -- all those families.
small church community -- they're pretty rattled.
she must be, too.
friends, co-workers dead, and on top of all that,
she might have some crazy power she can't understand.
or control.
sir, the department of energy's declared the particle acceleration lab too dangerous to enter.
but the good news is, we still think we can retrieve the disaster-event data from the instruments.
we'll determine the cause and see if there's any correlation
between telekinesis spontaneously forming and a particle accelerator exploding.
well, it does use giant magnets to fire billions of subatomic particles into their anti-particles at the speed of light to create miniature big bangs, so seems like a good place to start.
I read.
I'll try not to mention big bangs when we talk to Hutchins about the explosion.
you'll stay in the car.
this is a delicate situation.
we don't know what kind of danger this woman poses,
so I'll make initial contact with agents Ward and May.
wheels up in five. Better strap in.
it's a delicate situation,.So you're bringing along warm and fuzzy?
Hey, guys. - You're late.
we know what you did.
she blew up that gas station.
why aren't you arresting her?
officer, is there anything you can do to get these people to disperse?
been trying, but it's a free country.
miss Hutchins, I'm agent Coulson.
we specialize in strange occurrences like the ones you've encountered.
you've come to lock me up?
to talk.
well, what good will that do?
get out of here!
we don't want you here anymore.
officers, get those people back.
move it! Move it!
it's her! That freak just tried to kill us!
calm down.
easy, officer.
put the gun down.
leave me alone.
miss Hutchins, please calm down. - It wasn't me.
please calm down. We're not gonna let anyone hurt you.
time to go.
so much for the welcome wagon.
we don't believe that people have telekinetic powers, do we?
may was forced to sedate her.
the woman made a police car move -- with her mind.
there's no principal that would support -- Telekinesis. Not yet.
we did believe for a bit, though, remember?
freshman year?
when Sally Webber made the books fall off the table in neurobiology?
Oh, well, that was a particularly cruel prank.
you screamed like a girl.
I am a girl.
you know, that's the one drawback of graduating three years early.
we never to pull any freshman pranks on anyone else.
Fitz...Skye never went to the academy.
she's a freshman.
a wide-eyed little freshman.
and being pranked is an integral part of becoming a S. H. I. E. L. D. Agent.
well, mandatory, really.
why not give her the full S. H. I. E. L. D. Academy experience?
it would be unjust to deny her such a thing.
information data uploaded. Let's get going.
Yes, sir.
just a mattress, sir?
it's a six-hour-long ride to the fridge.
Fitz added magnetic shielding to the cage after Simmons had her scare.
if Miss Hutchins has this power, then that room should keep it from getting out.
but in there, she'll be just as dangerous.
how is she?
the dendrotoxin's wearing off.
she'll be awake soon, scared, in a strange room.
our next interaction with her is crucial to gaining her trust, which is why I want you there.
are you sure that's a good idea?
if miss Hutchins is gonna believe anything we say,
she needs to know we're not hiding things from her, which means you explaining the situation.
what if that doesn't calm her down?
what if that makes her more agitated?
then he definitely wants me in there.
pretty much.
I'll observe from out here.
and I'll lose the tie.
if she is telekinetic, I don't want to have a noose around my neck.
brought you some water.
it's okay.
I'm Phil. This is Melinda May.
how did I get here?
I sedated you.
I apologize for bringing you in that way.
things were escalating.
it was for everyone's safety.
everyone's safety.
good. Okay.
Oh, lord, what have I done?
I promise you, miss Hutchins... Nobody was hurt back there.
wherever I go, things turn bad.
were you angry at those people, back at the house?
um, angry?
no. I know most of them.
they were angry.
I understand.
Oh, god. Frank's wife
the way she was looking at me.
Frank Delacort.
he died in the accident.
because of me, they're gone.
I killed them.
so sad. - And normal.
these readings are entirely within average ranges.
of course, it's hard to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.
all I can tell from these brain waves is she's upset.
you need a computer for that?
may's in there -- the woman who shot her.
sedated her.
things got out of hand.
may sorted it out.
she's the cavalry.
where does that name come from, anyway?
didn't Ward tell you? - You don't know?
of course not.
you spent no time at the academy.
it's quite a story.
Yeah, well, Ward isn't exactly a chatty S. O.
well, imagine if you will...
...a heavily secured compound.
manama, Bahrain.
multiple S. H. I. E. L. D. Agents are taken hostage, tortured for information.
may's mission -- eliminate the threat.
you mean kill people.
not people -- entire squads of mercenaries, almost 100.
more than 100.
more than 100 men, heavily armed.
her vehicle got totaled, so she rode in.
and, um, she had a M249 in each hand.
right -- in each hand.
and she rode in on a horse.
hence the name -- the cavalry.
is this real?
she eliminated the enemy threat single-handedly.
she saw a lot of hurt that day.
is that why she's so -- Happy?
particle accelerator data loading.
No! You do not touch that.
two semesters minimum of holographic engineering before you get to touch this!
all right, all right. I get it.
I didn't go to your stupid S. H. I. E. L. D. Hogwarts or whatever.
I'm gonna go upstairs.
and I'm gonna do my own research on my computer
my boring, old, flat computer.
can you believe she bought that?
a horse -- brilliant.
you think you have the next prank?
we must carry on the tradition.
Yeah.
for weeks, I was getting reports from section two
complaining that the coupling assembly was coming loose at the bolts.
tobias is the...
he was the technician down there.
we replaced the part, and we triple-checked it for damage.
seems like I went down there every few days.
did you find a problem?
no. But clearly, I missed something.
my team is working to determine what really did happen and what might have happen to you.
to me? What do you mean?
we believe that somehow, as a result of the accident, you acquired some form of telekinetic ability.
you think it's me?
the police car, the gas sta-- you think I did that?
we're not sure, and this can be a hard thing to hear, but all these events have one thing in common.
me, but I'm not causing it.
it's not me.
I wish it were because then maybe I could make it stop.
but if it's not you, then what is it?
you people won't believe me.
try me.
God's punishing me.
he abandoned me.
he doesn't protect me anymore. That's why this is happening.
protect you from what?
demons, sir.
I'm being haunted by demons.
delusions of being persecuted aren't uncommon after trauma.
she's certainly been through her fair share.
she's blaming herself. It's guilt.
it's all of it. She's broken.
pore over the accident site.
if that tragedy gave her powers, we need to shut them down.
if it wasn't her fault, even better, but until then, she's a danger to all of us.
just let me go in and talk to her, sir, as a friend.
I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous.
she's not dangerous. She's nice -- like, overly nice.
she never misses a birthday post to her friends, runs the youth program at her church,
rescues dogs.
Hannah's a safety inspector not just because she's detail-oriented but because she
she genuinely cares.
right. And someone with that much empathy being responsible for that much loss of life,
she's devastated, spouting nonsense about god punishing her for
people believe what they need to believe to justify their actions.
is that how you justify your shoot-first policy?
at least let me try to repair that damage.
until we figure out what's going on with her, she stays locked up and you stay away.
thought that was glued down.
you're asking the right questions, Skye, but for now, that's all you get to do.
I'm sorry.
I just don't understand her at all.
everything to her is just target acquired.
threat eliminated.
well, she's a specialist.
in one thing.
you can catch a lot more flies with honey than with napalm -- just saying.
hand me the lettuce.
and she says I need to stay away, but you know what I think?
I think she needs to get laid.
might want to be less confrontational with agent May.
I'm not scared of her.
well, I am, but just because the cavalry shot 100 guys on horseback Doesn't mean she knows how people work.
wait, horseback? Where'd you hear that?
Fitz-Simmons.
were they messing with you?
story gets bigger every year.
it wasn't 100 guys -- it was 20.
trained assassins.
may crossed them off with one pistol, no support.
she rescued a bunch of agents?
there definitely wasn't a horse.
well, if it went so well, why's she so squirrelly about the name?
well, May's not in it for the glory.
she got the job done. End of story.
Where'd I put that knife?
leave me alone!
Oh, god, please forgive me!
this must be the coupling from the reports.
Oh, dear. The technicians were right.
were you even listening?
you weren't even a wee bit scared?
more disappointed, really.
it's fine. It's fine.
I'm just workshopping here, and, yes, I was listening.
I was about to go fetch our own magnetic couplings to run simulations.
Oh, well, while you're in there, grab some more diazepam for Hannah.
she may need to be more heavily sedated.
and the prank needs more work, as well.
I know.
I'm trying different things.
it's the timing that matters, Simmons.
Skye can't suspect a thing.
ward, come look at this.
tobias Ford.
Oh, isn't he one of the technicians who died at the plant?
Yeah, and he filed three safety complaints in the past month, each one in Hannah's department.
she thought he was a friend.
but he had it out for her.
sad part is... he was right.
couplings. Couplings, couplings.
Yes.
actually...
now, this I could use.
all I need now is a little bit of twine and an unsuspecting victim.
Oh, that's fantastic, that is.
well, that's odd.
my god. Fitz, look at this.
what are we seeing here?
it's as if the explosion tore open some sort of window to
to hell.
Simmons! Are you okay?
sir, Hannah's telling the truth.
she's not telekinetic.
there's someone else on this plane.
what was that?
plane's lost power.
we're going down.
ward, you certified?
what about engine-driven generators?
those are dead, too.
switch batteries to maintain flight controls.
the rest will be needed to keep the cage shielded.
flaps -- 10.
lower landing gear.
what can I do? - Buckle up.
there's a decent-sized field up ahead, but it's gonna be rough.
vertical landing's out.
coming in a little hot.
we got it
our ear comms are usually relayed through the plane, so here's some hardware.
did the girl do this to us, sir?
we believe Miss Hutchins is the victim here.
our theories about her powers have been disproved.
by who?
I saw a ghost.
I -- I know how it sounds, but a man attacked me, and then he disappeared.
did you get a good look at him?
he dematerialized!
may, run your systems checks.
is the cage still shielded?
most of the power dedicated to it.
this man or whatever he is has been tormenting Miss Hutchins.
the cage might be the one thing protecting her now.
we'll inform her.
sir, can it be me to talk to Hannah?
her life has been turned upside down, and we stuck her in a nightmare box.
she thinks she's being punished.
can I please be the one to deliver the good news?
that a non-corporeal madman is hunting her?
again, I think it'd be better coming from anyone else, really.
all right.
I'll head upstairs, activate the emergency transceiver, and radio HQ.
ward, take a firearm.
escort Fitz-Simmons downstairs, assess the damage, get us up and running.
wait. Guys, um, where's Fitz?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
what the hell's happening?
did we crash?
who was screaming?
this is not funny, Jemma, if this is a prank.
this is a prank.
clever.
Simmons?
come on. Turn on the lights.
thank god. Where have you been?!
I have been locked in a closet freaking out, thanks to you two geniuses.
that wasn't us.
well, then, who was it?
we found Fitz.
good, we'll need him.
looks like the main problem is in avionics bay two.
but he took out all our systems.
who's she talking about?
grab your equipment and get in there.
I'm going to power down flight controls to conserve energy
and then go defend the cage door in case this ghost comes knocking.
did she just say "ghost"?
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
region north, this is S. H. I. E. L. D. 616.
we've lost electrical and are grounded.
calculating coordinates, requesting supp
1990s technology at its best.
Hannah?
who's there?
my name is Skye. We haven't met yet.
we crashed, didn't we?
are you all hurt?
I'm so sorry. - No. No, no, no. We're okay.
whatever's happening, it's not your fault.
we were wrong.
but you need to stay in that room so that you're safe.
something... bad is out here.
demons.
I don't know what it is.
do you believe in god?
honestly? Not really.
well, I do. And I know that he's punishing me, and I deserve it.
no. No, you don't. No one does.
I had a few nuns around me growing up, and they would talk like that,
scaring kids with stories of god's wrath.
it made me not want to believe.
the only words that stuck with me were something that Sister Mckenna said from the bible, I think.
she said, "god is love."
it's simple and it's a little sappy, but that's the version I like.
God is love... the thing that holds us together.
and if that's true, I don't think he would punish you for making a mistake.
I think he'd forgive a mistake.
I want to believe that.
I do.
I'll stand guard now.
Coulson needs help with the emergency transceiver.
I would rather stay here for a while
it needs to get done, not discussed. That's an order.
I'll nearby if you need me, okay?
try not to hurt her any more than you already have, agent May.
he thinks it's hell, but I think it's an alien world.
Fitz, it was stunning.
well, there were reports in London after the spaceship landed of multiple portals opening,
Thor passing between worlds.
you think that's what they were researching at that lab?
trying to create another portal, yes.
failing until a malfunction produced a burst of energy.
this "ghost" is a man trapped between our universe and another.
perhaps that's how all ghosts are.
it's a simple explanation, really.
simple would be a relative term in this case.
bloody hell.
he was thorough.
Oh, god.
plane's on uneven ground.
could just be settling.
or the other thing.
get to work.
clear.
what? - Ward, help!
quiet.
help!
seems like a hardware issue, not firmware.
I should be with Hannah, anyway.
no wonder she keeps screaming in there.
you keep sending in the cavalry, you're bound to get a reaction like that.
don't -- don't call her that.
why not? No normal person can shoot 100 Bahrain
that's not how it went down.
whatever, 20.
I just -- I don't understand -- She didn't have a gun.
none of us did.
and it wasn't a rescue or an assault, whatever they say at the academy these days.
we were the welcome wagon.
and it went south.
how many -- Plenty.
a civilian girl and a few of our guys were stuck inside a building,
being held by the followers of this gifted individual -- Or worshippers.
we never found out.
may did.
she took it upon herself to get them out.
said she could fix the problem.
so she went in, crossed off the enemy force.
didn't say how.
did she lose anyone in there?
herself.
may used to be different.
she was always quiet, she just...
she was warm.
fearless in a different way, getting in trouble, pulling pranks, thought rules were meant to be broken.
sound familiar?
but when she walked out of that building... It was like that part of her was gone.
I tried to comfort her, but she wouldn't tell me what went down in there.
what did you say?
I said the words I thought she needed to hear.
it's why you want her on the plane
to see if that person is still in there somewhere.
the lock is jammed.
let me in or let her out.
that's not up to us.
let her out!
talk to me. What's happening?
may, he's disappearing.
he's passing between worlds.
it seems a little less of him is returning every time he appears.
but why is he after you guys?
because he can't get to Hannah in there. She's safe.
if we wait it out, maybe he'll disappear fully.
what are you going to do?
fix the problem.
we got to find a way out of here.
any of this crap still work?
there he is.
what happened?
well, we lost communication.
and you were hit with a very large plumber's wrench.
a wrench?
Yeah.
that guy's traveling back and forth between alien worlds with a wrench?
must have been in his hand when the blast hit.
not the kind of wrench you would use to loosen a coupling, is it?
...There?
maybe it doesn't work after all.
uh, yes, yes, we're here, sir.
Where'd you go?
nowhere. We were attacked, locked in, then the guy disappeared.
Hey, that's our story.
is May with you guys?
she isn't with you?
I don't mean to scare you, I just need to use you as bait.
well, that's comforting.
to draw him out, away from my people.
then what will you do?
whatever I have to.
you're sure this is how to do it?
Yes. I'll max the signal, and the transceiver will act as a trigger.
okay, fine.
they only made 20, I think.
so, we believe that this man is responsible for the blast?
Skye said she thinks he's the worker who filed all the reports.
tobias Ford.
it looks like him.
it makes no sense for a man to complain about safety issues whilst causing them.
another theory is -- Theories don't matter. Only facts, and the fact is, a bullet will take you out of whatever world you're in.
any idea which direction May could've taken her?
we'll deploy the golden retrievers. They're in here.
Fitz!
this is no time for childish nonsense like this!
pranking was your idea.
and obviously, I rigged this little beauty before I knew there was a dimension-jumping psychopath in the mix.
wait, childish.
this guy is childish.
what are you getting at?
Tobias. Is that you?
he wanted her to notice him.
why would he file a complaint to her office when there was nothing wrong
and then cause an actual safety issue himself?
to get her fired?
to get her attention, to spend time with her.
think about it -- he scared the guy who was harassing her at the airport.
he tried to hit you with a cop car.
when we took her into custody.
Yeah, he's not trying to hurt her.
he's trying to protect her.
he likes her.
it's okay. It's okay.
tell him I won't hurt you.
Tobias, wait, she's a friend.
Hannah. - You have to stop.
please.
listen, we believe you're trapped between two worlds
this world -- And hell.
I'm being dragged to hell for what I did.
what did you do?
just loosen a few bolts, and then you'd visit.
it was the best part of my day.
I'm sorry.
I -- I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
Oh, no. Tobias. How could you?
I killed them. - I know.
and even worse, everyone started blaming you.
I tr-- I tried to stop them.
but you hurt more people.
I was trying to protect you from them.
Hannah, please, Maybe if you forgive me, I won't go to hell.
only god can forgive you.
and he won't.
you can't undo what's been done.
that will be with you forever.
but trying to hold on to this life, clinging to the person you thought you could be, That's hell.
and you're dragging her down with you.
you have to let go before my people come and make you do it.
if you care about her, and I know you do, let her go.
let the girl go, Tobias.
let the girl go.
are you okay?
what did you say to him?
same words you said to me in Bahrain.
she all right?
much better.
let me know if she needs anything.
can Fitz repair it?
no.
this one's a lost cause.
but May isn't.
if anyone can bring her around, it's you.
you know what makes people tick.
pun intended.
so do you.
you see the good in them.
you were a friend to Hannah, you can't wait to get inside may's head,
and you figured out Tobias without even trying.
guess I'm full of surprises.
but this isn't one of them.
I wanted you paying close attention to the index asset evaluation and intake process
because someday, you'll be really good at it
even the best.
Thanks, A.C.
maybe you'll get to rename it.
good, because that name is super stupid.
I know
mind if I keep you company?
cool.
that isn't a word in our language.
I've never heard of it. - I'm checking.
our language?
you mean the English language, first spoken in England?
Aglet -- a plastic or metal tube Covering the end of a shoelace.
Oh, come on.
she used her Britishness against us.
it's a word.
it's not funny.
I was sleeping peacefully.
very clever, Simmons.
I didn't -- I didn't do it.
well, Ward, I don't appreciate -- Don't look at me.
okay, well, Skye -- no.
well, who, then?
thing is, no one exactly knows what happened to the crying man that summer.
some say that he drowned in the lake,
but others say that they've seen his ghost,
wandering these woods, in search for his lost sister.
actually, they say if you're quiet and listen real hard...
you can still hear him crying.
Mr. Cross, that was, like, the worst crying man ever.
Really? I thought it was pretty good.
you guys think we're kidding.
just remember to stick close to the campfire tonight, okay?
Hey, guys. Do you hear that?
hear what?
that humming sound.
stay here. I'm gonna take a look around the campground.
what humming?
W-where's Mr. Cross going?
he's just trying to scare us. so lame.
come on, guys. Grab a s'more.
well, that's for you.
Ooh, I want the marsh-- ooh, marshmallows!
now, I know -- Tommy, I know you like chocolates. Here.
don't hog the marshmallows, okay?
help! - Everyone to the truck now!
go, go! Go!
Mr. Cross? Mr. Cross!
come on, guys.
let's go look for him. - Is he nuts?
stay close.
Mr. Cross, are you okay?
Mr. Cross!
working up a good sweat there, sir?
I don't sweat.
I glisten.
blood pressure, heart rate, biochems -- all normal.
all that's left is the blood sample.
you should know -- I'm not a fan of getting poked.
tell me, sir -- Have you been feeling under the weather lately?
Why?
I just noticed from your chart that you're not due for a general physical for another three months.
I made a mistake -- took a call from my physical therapist.
asked how I was feeling. I said, a little rusty.
next thing you know, I'm wired to this hamster wheel.
well, you can officially tell your physical therapist
that you're fit as the proverbial fiddle, especially for a man of your age.
a man of my age?
that's something you say to an old person.
is it?
well, let's get you some electrolytes, shall we?
sorry, Fitz.
it's close, but it's just not right.
Really?
cause agent Coulson had no problems.
it's an ounce too heavy.
an ounce? Seriously?
it's the difference between success and failure.
when you're on a rooftop with a 15-mile-an-hour wind, your target is 500 yards away...
Yeah, but we do have a rifle.
lose the ounce.
Yeah, okay. On it.
lose the ounce.
I'm agent Grant Ward, and I can shoot the legs off a flea from 500 yards, as long as it's not windy.
that's a sound I haven't heard in a bit.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be laughing a whole lot if you were living in Ward's doghouse.
you made the rounds, apologized to us all. What more can he ask?
I don't know.
I have been busting my ass, memorizing every S. H. I. E. L. D. protocol manual, Following every order.
"yes, sir." "No, sir."
I even let them tag me like a stray dog.
I mean, I know I lied to you guys, But I was trying to protect my boyfriend.
you know, we all make mistakes.
and who ca-- I don't care -- Who cares about your ex-boyfriend?
it's not like I'm comparing Ward to Miles. But at least with Miles,
I didn't have to worry about passive-aggressive stuff.
there was no mind games.
we spoke the same language, you know?
Yeah. Yeah, a bit like we do.
totally.
you and Simmons are so tight. It's like you're psychically linked.
no, you -- No. Actually, no. I don't think so.
so, Ward was here?
let me guess -- the night-night pistol again?
Yeah. Oh, yeah, and he said it was off by an ounce.
of course he did.
I'm agent Grant Ward, and I could rupture your spleen with my left pinky -- blindfolded!
that is dead on.
hustle up and grab your gear.
we're on a mission.
something funny?
poor, silly Fitz.
he mistakenly left a dummy round in the pistol.
should be proper now.
great. Thanks.
troop leader's name was Adam Cross..
apparently, he said he heard something in the woods, went to check it out.
that's where the electrostatic anomaly occurred.
what I don't understand is, usually, they're caused by a massive electrical storm...
but there wasn't a storm within a thousand miles of here last night.
this anomaly's different -- It has a side effect we've never seen before.
the battery blew straight up through the hood.
landed over here.
hell of a force to create that kind of trajectory.
what are you doing?
I'm shadowing my supervising officer.
shadowing, not smothering.
there's scorch marks all over that tree.
lucky the whole forest didn't burn down.
I don't get it.
seems to me like this electroshock thing was some freak lightning strike.
I mean, why call us? What's the big
never mind.
so sad a man died this way... And yet, so amazing.
Fitz-Simmons, any idea what could cause an effect like this?
there's the soliton hypothesis...Electrical discharge, it could be --Well, okay, judging by the horizontal... Perhaps, nanobatteries
time.
let's try that again.
any idea what could cause an effect like this?
the hell if I know. - Uh, no, no clue.
seems to me like we're either dealing with some freak natural event or a new high-tech weapon.
or could it be someone from your uber-secret index?
there's no one on the index with this type of power.
that we know of.
I'll contact agent Blake at S. H. I. E. L. D. HQ, have him check it out.
whoever or whatever's responsible, we can't let this happen again.
Fitz, see his forehead?
look at that endothelial discoloration.
Yeah, same dispersal pattern as the strike on the truck.
could be an entry wound cauterized immediately.
freaky.
freaky.
you found something on Cross?
many things, actually, but you already knew that, thanks to my fancy S. H. I. E. L. D. House-arrest gizmo
tracking my every key swipe, my online activity, my cholesterol.
just wish it came in another color...or came off.
the victim?
Adam Cross. -- single, no kids, originally from wrigley, pennsylvania, not far from here.
been there.
they have a nice little strawberry festival in the spring.
occupation?
Phys-ed teacher at the local high school and varsity baseball coach
and troop leader and volunteer firefighter.
this guy makes captain america look like "the dude."
the big lebowski.
Seriously?
what about a criminal record, restraining order, something that might give us a suspect?
nada -- not even a parking ticket.
I skimmed all his posts, anyone linked to his pages,
hoping for a crazy ex or superpowered stalker, and he's clean.
everybody looks clean on their first go-round.
ward's right.
we're missing something.
dig deeper.
you've been pretty tough on her.
she lied to us -- Contacted the rising tide while we were on mission.
if she wants our trust back, she's got to earn it.
the background she ran on Cross is a good start.
put it up on the server.
I want May to have a look when she's done with her interrogation.
have a cookie.
excellent timing, sir.
I've been analyzing sagittal and coronal images Of the victim's brain.
what's Fitz doing out there?
he detected a strange energy coming off the body.
he's afraid of it, isn't he?
it's the smell!
there's no shame in it, Fitz.
it's perfectly natural to be afraid.
no, the only thing I'm afraid of is putrid, decaying flesh corrupting my pristine workspace.
do you remember the last time you brought a dead thing into the lab?
Oh, not the stupid cat again. - The cat, tell him about the cat!
and it's our lab, Fitz. Not your lab. - You left his liver next to my lunch!
guys!
can we please... - Yes, sir.
um, as I was saying, this is the victim's brain.
looks like a burnt baked potato.
that's what happens when it's hit with close to 2, 000 megajoules of electrostatic energy.
that's almost double the power of a lightning bolt.
kid's clean.
you figure out why the body was floating?
not yet.
the molecular density of the victim was temporarily altered by an unknown energy source.
I'm hoping to shed some light on its effects once I extract a brain-tissue sample.
it's happening again! - It's science, Fitz! I have to dissect something.
no, the satellite's picking up another electrostatic event not 20 kilometers from here.
Fitz, what's the latest reading?
we're at 324 megajoules and growing stronger -- Dangerous territory, sir.
there's a farmhouse a mile north of you, right at the center of the signal.
that's got to be it.
Skye, dig up everything you can on whoever lives at that farm.
we need to know who we're dealing with.
hold on, now. What just happened?
um, it's gone. - What's gone?
the electrostatic signal -- It seemed to pulse, then disappear.
we need a shortcut.
door's barred from the inside.
Hayloft's open.
we could ram it with the truck.
or...
scan the perimeter.
whoever did this couldn't have gotten far.
barricaded himself inside.
went for his shotgun.
he was scared, trying to protect himself.
from who?
how did they get to him?
another burn mark on the forehead.
no sign of anyone -- No tracks, no vehicles down the road.
Skye, we need real-time sat surveillance on this area right now.
hang on.
I think I found something you might want to see first.
sending it over now.
the guy who owns the farm's name is Frank Whalen.
he's a volunteer firefighter at the same station house as our first victim, Adam Cross..
our two victims knew each other.
they were both responders when the aliens crashed New York.
two victims from the same firehouse found in the same weird way.
we're looking for a killer.
gotcha!
Hey, um, anyone else notice all the metal scattered around the body,
like an electromagnetic field was present?
the question is, what created it?
we need to get this body back to the lab as soon as possible.
something about these wounds... - Skye, what did you find out about the firehouse?
it turns out they sent an engine to New York with a dozen volunteers after the Chitauri invasion,
including Cross and Whalen.
maybe it has something to do with why they were targeted?
or how they were killed.
you mean like... an alien weapon?
let's just make sure we get to those firefighters before anyone else does.
evening, gentlemen.
agent Phil Coulson with S. H. I. E. L. D. We were on the ground with you in New York.
s. H. I. E. L. D. right.
what's this all about?
we'd like to ask you a few questions, take a look around.
Hey, guys. What's, uh -- what's going on?
what are you looking for?
a scented candle. - Not you.
this wound -- something doesn't quite make sense.
initially, I thought these were entry wounds, as if from a gunshot.
but they're not -- they're exit wounds.
what do you mean? Frankie's dead?
I'm very sorry. - You know how it happened?
the same way your other friend, Mr. Cross, died the day before.
which was how, exactly?
I'm sorry. Your name is...?
Tony. Tony Diaz.
you okay, Mr. Diaz?
actually, uh... I'm actually not feeling so hot.
ward, cover the back door.
nobody comes in or out.
what if this weapon overloaded the brain past the threshold of its electrical capacity,
causing it to discharge, like an E. M. P.?
you're assuming we're dealing with an external source.
I'm saying it was something from inside him.
something's happening -- The satellite's picking up another reading.
it's coming from the firehouse.
that humming noise -- you hear that?
no. I don't.
were you in New York with Mr. Cross and Mr. Whalen after the Chitauri invasion?
come on. You don't hear that?
it's driving me nuts.
Mr. Diaz, are you with me?
whatever you're doing, make it stop.
I-I'm not doing anything!
Where's the weapon? - The what?
coulson, I found it.
it's a Chitauri helmet.
Fitz-Simmons, are you seeing this?
it's not a weapon, yet it caused a cranial discharge.
what are you doing with the helmet?
what, the -- the alien thing? I-it's a souvenir.
not again!
answer the question, Mr. Diaz -- What are you doing with the helmet?
the first time anyone's touched it since New York was a couple nights ago.
Why? - It had rust all over it.
we were cleaning it.
that wasn't rust.
may, don't touch it!
sir, he's not using a weapon -- he's infected.
I think the helmet was the source of an alien virus.
all we did was clean it
I swear. Me, frankie, and Adam -- we
we were bored on the third shift, so --so we decided to clean it.
Adam and frankie...
Mr. Diaz, I'm putting the gun away now, okay?
sir, he's at 600 megajoules and climbing.
sir?
clear everybody out.
clear everybody out now.
I-I'm gonna wind up like them, aren't I?
why don't you have a seat?
you have any family -- wife, kids?
is there anyone you want to talk to?
anything I can do?
sir, you have to get out of there right now! He's going to
listen to me.
I've been where you are right now.
so please believe me when I tell you you don't have to be afraid.
what are you -- what are you talking about?
your job -- gets pretty dangerous, doesn't it?
mine, too.
I got hurt once - pretty bad.
and I...I died.
some say it was only for 8 seconds, but I know it was more than that.
I know I wasn't here anymore.
I was there.
what's it like?
it's beautiful.
you better get going, buddy.
go.
all clean -- no traces of electrostatic energy.
what about the other firefighters?
they'll be quarantined and observed at a S. H. I. E. L. D. biohazard facility.
um, anyone else notice they're putting the infected alien thing on our truck?
we're flying it to the sandbox.
sandbox?
it's a S. H. I. E. L. D. research facility across the Atlantic.
they specialize in hazardous materials.
if what you suspect is true, that this is a virus,
then those firefighters could be infected, and they're gonna need a cure.
find one. - Yes, sir.
what's our E. T. A.?
3: 37 west africa time.
gonna be a long 4 hours and 26 minutes.
you okay?
fine. I just want this alien thing off our plane as soon as humanly possible.
you want to talk about your physical?
nothing to tell.
my physical therapist requested it.
he's updating his files or something.
you'd tell me if something was wrong.
of course.
sir, I think I've discovered something.
could you come down to the lab?
I'll be right there.
Phil.
the fireman -- You did everything you could for him.
so, what am I looking for exactly?
wait for it.
what was that? - A groundbreaking discovery!
I believe the firefighters initially contracted the virus when they cleaned the helmet, the friction activating some long-decaying Chitauri organism.
hang on.
these cells are from the bodies of the firefighters?
brain cells, yes -- the last vestiges of the infection.
some viruses "sleep" inside host cells for years before reproducing,
as they did inside the helmet -- the initial source.
but what those cells tell us is that we're dealing with a propagating virus, which means
the virus can move from person to person.
Exactly!
and that's the most exciting part
how it spreads -- Not through the air or through direct fluid transfer,
but through electric static shock.
it's like nothing we've ever seen on earth.
I didn't think it possible a virus could alter its host's molecular density and polarity.
that explains the floating.
I can't wait till the virologists at the CDC and S. H. I. E. L. D.Hq see this.
sir, is something wrong?
I'm so sorry, Jemma.
Oh, no.
Simmons believes she contracted the virus approximately 36 hours ago when she received an electrostatic shock from the first victim.
how much time does she have?
based on when the firemen were infected, how quickly their symptoms manifested...
two hours at most.
that's enough time, right?
I mean, S.H. I. E. L. D. has dozens of labs and scientists working on this thing, don't they?
they do.
how soon can you get us on the ground?
three hours.
our path to the sandbox has us right in the middle of the Atlantic.
sir, correct me if I'm wrong, but if we can't land in time...
Simmons will release a pulse that will blow this plane right out of the sky.
we can't just sit here and watch her die. We have to do something.
there's only one person on this plane capable of finding a solution for this,
and I'm willing to bet my life that she will.
she's just a kid.
I believe we have a winner.
fast and efficient -- The perfect delivery mechanism.
uh, hey, um, not that it was easy to find a mineralized solution
that could suspend the vaccine and conduct electricity.
I wish you wouldn't use the word "vaccine."
it's really more of an antiserum.
okay, so... These antibodies should be able to target the virus' antigens,
if this bloody alien virus even has antigens.
come on, now. Come on.
Well...That wasn't very cooperative of him, Now, was it?
why aren't you down there?
they don't need an audience.
you can stay... If you want.
I hate this.
I just feel so -- Helpless.
Yeah.
I wanted it to be a person, some superpowered psychopath
someone I could hurt, someone I could...punish.
that I could do.
what I can't do is protect you guys from stuff I can't even see or understand.
so, what do we do?
we wait...
...and get ready.
ready for what?
for whatever it is we're called upon to do.
coulson, nice to see you're not dead.
did you get our analysis of the virus?
we did, and S. H. I. E. L. D. has no record of anything like it.
no one does.
so it's imperative it reach the sandbox without incident.
in case of a pandemic, we're going to need it.
I'm aware of that, but I don't need more orders or ultimatums.
I need answers. - I wish I had some for you.
I'm sorry, Coulson.
I've been ordered to inform you that if you have infected cargo, you need to dump it.
do you copy me, Coulson?
these orders are coming from up top. -I'm sorry. Bad connection.
didn't get that last part.
don't even think it.
I don't have to.
that's your job.
it's all right. Everything's gonna be fine.
please stop saying that. I see you looking at your watch.
are you sure you don't need my help just to
are you sure this thing even works?
Yeah, well, you know it does. My device isn't the issue -- it's the vaccine.
Antiserum!
and all I'm wondering is whether you calibrated it correctly.
Hey, it's not the device.
Hey, don't put this on me.
I was doing just fine, Tucked away in a safe, indoor, non-mobile lab at the academy!
then you had to go and drag us into this flying circus!
didn't even pass our field assessments, for god's sake!
you said, and I quote...
"Oh, Fitz, it's the most perfect opportunity for us to see the world!
we'd be fools to pass this one up!"
I hate it when you use that voice.
that's not even how I sound.
and you were just afraid of going into the field.
I was not afraid.
and don't you dare act like these last months Haven't been the highlight of your entire pasty life!
pasty?
Oh, really?
well, when did you become so sun-kissed?
because I'm pretty sure that every minute of every day,
you've been stuck in a lab right beside me.
at the academy, at sci-ops, this plane,
you've been beside me the whole damn time!
you have to fix this.
I don't know how, Fitz.
the antibodies from the three firefighters aren't strong enough to fight this virus.
it's born from alien DNA.
there's no one... to create an antiserum from. Because no one's actually survived this except...
the Chitauri. - The Chitauri.
well, the minky bastard who actually wore the helmet had the virus...
Yeah, and managed to survive without ever emitting an electrostatic pulse because...
it was immune.
Yes. She -- she was just the carrier, like typhoid mary.
Uh,"she"? Well, no, wait.
that -- you don't really think that -- okay, doesn't matter.
um, so if
if I can scrape some epithelial cells from the inside of the helmet, we can create a vaccine?
Yes! Antiserum, but yes.
isn't that...
Fitz!
no, uh... You can't be in here.
too late. It's done.
just try and do your best to keep your hands off me, yeah?
Fitz, I don't know what you think you're doing, but
I'm doing what we always do.
we're gonna fix this -- together.
third time's a charm.
may I do the honors?
I can't breathe.
we did it.
no.
sir, I know the protocol in these circumstances,
but could you please tell my dad first?
I just think my mum would take it better if it comes from him.
we're not there yet. There's still time.
sir, please.
would you mind if I had a brief moment alone with Fitz?
come on. Let's go.
we'll try again.
the electrostatic pulse from the third rat seemed much less, so we're making progress.
if we can calibrate the antiserum...
antiserum, yes.
you finally got it right, Fitz.
I'm so sorry.
agent Blake is on the line.
he wants to know what's going on.
if you won't answer, he asked for Ward.
sir... What are our orders?
they're unchanged.
what is that?
someone's lowering the cargo-hold ramp.
it worked.
the pulse just knocked the rat uncon...scious.
Jemma?
Jemma! Jemma, it worked!!
please, don't! Jemma! Jemma, don't!
Jemma!!
Jemma!
the antiserum worked, but she jumped!
don't get me wrong!
I'm happy you're both alive -- truly.
and I realize you were trying to save the team, but what you did today
that was not your call.
just getting you out of the water
do you have any idea what a pain it is dealing with the Moroccan Office?
don't you ever pull a stunt like that again.
we'd hate to lose you, Jemma.
thank you, sir.
Oh, does that mean we're to leave now?
so, what did you think of your first time skydiving?
honestly, I'd rather not think about it anymore.
I thought what you did was incredibly brave.
well, I-I suppose now's as good a time as any To tell you that, um,
I may have misled you earlier.
you see, when I gave you back the night-night pistol, I lied
it's still an ounce off.
I know.
you do? - Of course.
after all... I'm agent grant Ward.
I just jumped out of a plane without a parachute on and saved your life!
actually, that's not quite it.
it's a bit more nasally than that.
Hello, Skye.
how was Simmons?
amazingly resilient.
you'd never know she almost died.
experience like that -- it takes awhile to sink in.
that her medical report?
mine, actually.
blood work finally came back.
I'm perfectly normal -- little heavy on the iron.
but don't worry -- You don't have to start calling me "iron man."
wasn't planning on it.
my doctors never requested any tests.
I ordered them for myself, but you knew that.
this piece of paper is telling me that everything's fine, but...
I don't feel fine. I feel different.
take off your shirt. - Excuse me?
your shirt...
unbutton it.
whether it was 8 seconds or 40, you died.
there's no way you can go through a trauma like that and not come out of it changed.
you know how long it's taken me to -- I know.
the point of these things is to remind us that...
there is no going back -- There's only moving forward.
you feel different...
because you are different.
and I was going to do it. - I know you were.
I had the antiserum, the chute -- everything.
I just couldn't get the straps on. - Fitz, please.
and, you know, maybe I couldn't have done The whole - "James Bond in midair" type of thing. - Fitz, shut up.
please, just... Ward did an amazing thing, yes,
but it wasn't Ward by my side in that lab, searching for a cure.
it wasn't Ward giving me hope when I had none.
it was you. You're the hero.
yeah? - Yeah.
thank you.
Blake.
Coulson.
that's the best you could come up with
"we've got a bad connection"?
I was pressed for time.
it's a bold move. You know our chat wasn't exactly private.
they never are.
I don't know what happened to you in New York,
if you really flatlinedoOr if that's just what they tell us when we reach level seven,
but whatever did happen doesn't give you license to disobey a direct order from HQ.
you keep pulling stunts like that, someone might decide to take this little dream team away from you.
I'd like to see them try.
that doesn't sound like the Phil Coulson I used to know.
no, I suppose it doesn't.
get used to it.
you saved Skye's life.
what is it?
why aren't you happy about it?
being down there... seeing where I came from
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
agent Ward and I have been having sex.
and if it's a problem... - I'll end it.
I got to grab something real quick.
I'll be right back, my love.
get a look at that.
H-hey, darlin', girl like you could have any man you want.
why did you marry that little dude?
he loaded?
he's not my husband.
I took him from his bride earlier today.
I needed him to provide safe passage.
you in trouble?
cause if you need a place to lay low for a while, this is as good as any.
what kind of beast is that?
it's a 1987 heritage softail.
you can hop on mine, you want to feel a roar.
how grand.
what is your name?
my men, they call me rooster.
you have men?
you are their leader?
last time I checked, yeah.
you and your men now serve me.
this guy bothering you?
no. He's with me now.
what? No! I'm with you!
you said we'd be together forever, remember?
I said we'd be together till the end.
it is the end.
No!
who are you?
I'm Lorelei.
now...
...Introduce me to all of my men.
No! What did I say?
damn it. Every time.
it's like you have a sensor for whenever my butt lifts off the bed.
back in it.
I just want to stretch my legs. - Now.
look!
there's color in my cheeks.
breathing without... ...feeling like my whole body's on fire. I'm good.
"good" is not the appropriate word to describe your state.
you've been shot twice, had your stomach perforated, and a breathing tube shoved down your throat.
"better" is the more accurate word.
again with the blood drive?
I'm not gonna have anything left.
not sure how I feel about Dr. Simmons.
she's so strict. And pokey.
well, patient Skye is unruly and stubborn.
and grateful.
I hope you know that.
I didn't do it alone.
still, I'm the most... "grateful-est-est" patient alive.
that's not even a word.
this a bad time?
it is if you're here to bust me out.
the warden has extended house arrest.
terrible accent.
I must look terrible!
Simmons won't even bring me a mirror.
I've seen worse.
Thanks.
no, I mean, you look better than when you were dying.
swinging and a-missing, Ward.
it's great to see you... better.
it was so stupid to go in there alone.
there's no point in doing that now.
you were brave.
thanks to you, every S. H. I. E. L. D. Agent in the country knows Mike Peterson's alive.
you tell them about his magic leg?
I didn't call it that, but yes.
agent Garrett's running point on Mike.
thinks he's part of some project called Deathlok.
he looked like death.
you should have...
he wouldn't even look at me.
they did something to him.
he needs help. - He's past help.
he was there with you, Skye -- could have protected you.
he let this happen to you.
and I'll never forgive that.
well, I-I need to better protect myself, so...
when Simmons gives the all-clear, we'll start training?
we'll ease you back into it.
no. I want to train harder.
next time, I don't want to depend on some miracle drug to save me.
she's beginning to get suspicious of all the blood I'm taking.
no wonder. How many samples have you tested each day?
not enough.
not enough to find anything in her blood or Coulson's.
there isn't ample residue remaining in the vial to examine after we emptied it into her bloodstream.
such a pity we only found the one.
well, excuse me for not sticking around long enough to get blown to pieces.
it's just that the last sample of this miracle drug is inside Skye.
you can't find any trace of it?
no. She's healing at an exponential rate,
but I can't detect anything irregular on a cellular level.
and you've explained to Coulson that you need to upload the samples to HQ?
he shut me down, said to keep it in-house.
I mean, this drug could be a phenomenal breakthrough, Could save countless lives.
why is he being so twitchy?
well, you were down in the bunker with him.
did you see anything peculiar?
everything was peculiar.
director Fury moved heaven and earth.
No! Don't give it to her!
you know, usually, when a friend wants a favor, they do something nice
takes me to a nice restaurant, buys me a bottle of wine.
want to go to a movie, hold hands?
okay.
but I need to ask you a question first.
I don't know where Director Fury is.
don't be so shocked.
for a quiet guy, you make a lot of noise.
how many favors have you called in?
clearly, not enough.
something I can help you with?
fine.
but Fury is a high-level agent who's off-grid.
you don't find him unless he wants to find you.
you did something like that once, too. Remember?
I never asked you. How was Tahiti?
it sucked.
new orders.
s. H. I. E. L. D.'s detecting massive energy readings in the skies above the California and Nevada border.
Where's agent Coulson?
taking personal time.
that's a couple days straight.
these are the same readings Dr. Selvig and Dr. Foster picked up in new Mexico and in London.
they herald the arrival of an Aasgardian.
Thor. - Not sure. Either way,
s. H. I. E. L. D. wants us to be the welcome wagon.
o-okay. Fine.
no cause for concern, right?
Aasgardians are allies.
Loki wasn't.
Fitz?
Yeah, we're definitely getting close, but it's a bit of a crap shoot.
this is still science we don't completely understand.
seems to be a lot of that going around lately.
so, Coulson hasn't talked to you about why he changed his mind on giving Skye that injection?
no. He's keeping it to himself.
I'm getting a massive energy surge, three times the level of the one before.
how close?
Yeah, definitely Aasgardian.
running facial recognition.
okay, got it.
I don't have a name, but I can confirm she was in new Mexico, fighting with Thor and his mates.
she's on our side.
stand down. She's a friendly.
you are of S. H. I. E. L. D?
Yeah. - I am lady Sif of Aasgard.
your world is in grave danger.
she's a warrior. I saw her fight in new Mexico with Thor
climbed a giant metal killing machine,
speared it with her double-bladed sword. It was pretty badass.
she says she needs S. H. I. E. L. D. to help her find someone.
you up for this?
I'm fine.
"fine" doesn't look like this. Not on you.
you've been gone more often than not.
whatever's bothering you... I'm here.
I know.
what dark magic is this?
Thor said you perished at the hand of Loki.
and he was right... for a while, anyway.
but Loki wasn't the only one with some tricks up his sleeve.
turns out, S. H. I. E. L. D. had a few of their own.
Thor will be pleased to hear it.
he considers you a friend.
I feel the same, which is why I'd prefer he hear it from me, if that's okay.
I understand you're looking for someone.
I am hunting her.
Lorelei.
600 years ago, she used her powers to wreak havoc across the nine realms,
to command armies, bring down kings, empires.
what kind of powers we talking about?
strength? Speed?
sorcery.
she bends and shapes the will of men to her own purpose.
only men? Her powers don't work on women?
no. Men have an inherent weakness we do not share.
I can't imagine what she's talking about.
the very sound of her voice can ensnare most.
for the rare man who can resist, it's her voice joined by her touch that will overpower his will.
so, how do we stop her?
with this.
it prevents her from speaking.
she wore one like it for centuries while locked in prison.
she escaped when the dark elves invaded Aasgard and came here using one of Loki's secret pathways between worlds.
do we know where she is now?
all I know is the bifrost delivered me to her last known location.
mostly small towns out that way.
let's start looking for unusual activity within a few-hundred-mile radius
burglary, theft, assault.
if this woman's used to ruling over empires... She's gonna be hard to please.
I wanted gold!
you bring me...paper?!
it's -- it's cash.
it's like gold.
this is the currency here.
and who's this ugly woman?
uh, that's -- uh, that's Ben Franklin.
used to be president.
used to rule this whole country.
and women can rule your land, can they not?
well, uh, y-you'd be the first.
Yes. I will.
what the hell, Duane?!
move! Move!
I have been thought you were dead, worried siin a gutter somewhere.
don't, baby. There's nothing to worry about.
I-I just turned off my cellphone 'cause the noise was bothering Lorelei.
are those my clothes?
why is this woman wearing my clothes, Duane?
who's this Duane she speaks of?
it's, uh -- that's me. My -- my real name's Duane.
she calls me that. She's my wife.
Yeah.
do you prefer her to me?
sh-she is nobody next to you.
nobody?! Really?!
"nobody" owns this bar.
you know what? Everybody out. Out! We are closed! Out!
I'm tired of this noise, rooster.
make it stop.
his name is not rooster!
it's -- I'm sorry, baby.
you're just making too much noise.
these are files of every police report within 100 miles of where you arrived,
everything from the last 48 hours.
when you want to skim through the information, you just... - I'm familiar.
...Touch the -- oh.
it's an antiquated system we and other realms had ages ago.
you've... visited other realms, seen different species, aliens.
have you ever encountered any that were...blue?
Yes, of course.
which ones?
the frost giants tried to conquer your earth a millennia ago, but Aasgard drove them away.
well, thanks for that.
and the others -- have any of them been here recently?
rest easy, Phillip, son of Coul.
none of the others have ever visited earth.
there -- a robbery of jewels.
and there -- a gun-store robbery by guys on harleys.
it's happening faster than I feared.
she's amassing men, gold, weaponry.
Lorelei is building an army.
traced the men to a biker bar called Rosie's Desert Oasis.
probably where Lorelei's hiding out.
meeting a S. H. I. E. L. D. Convoy there in 10.
good. Then you can show off these beauties.
these all night-night guns?
based on the same technology, but we're not calling them that anymore.
about time.
they're called icers -- incapacitating cartridge emitting
they're great.
and you lost the ounce.
and I tripled the stopping power.
but I did realize after our run-ins with Mike and centipede...
sorry.
...Um, that we needed something stronger, better.
thought you didn't like guns.
no, I always say if I need a gun, i'll take one.
we'll need these.
when you're up against people who are being controlled,
sometimes it's hard to distinguish friend from foe.
this way, we can take out either.
Where's lady Sif?
shall we?
Lorelei's tastes run toward palaces, castles.
this is far more humble than her usual abode.
the draw wasn't the place.
it was the manpower.
how many men does she have in there?
have you seen the suspect?
Yes, we have. And she's beautiful.
what is that?
well, it seems we've caught the attention of the law.
you swore to fight for me.
Yeah, and I will.
but they got a lot of firepower out there.
I mean, hell, they even got some medieval-times chick.
she's got, like, a sword and everything.
sif.
they're on us from both sides.
be hard to get off a clean shot.
your ladyship, can you give us a little cover?
very literal interpretation.
thank you.
all clear.
men, stay outside.
let Sif take Lorelei.
ward, head around back.
surround the building.
Lorelei... Still manipulating men to do your dirty work, I see.
and I see you're still a step or two behind.
you know how this ends, Lorelei.
so come willingly.
you mistake me for someone who fears you.
I've bested you before.
or have you forgotten?
tear her apart.
look. I'm sure you're, uh, a reasonable guy...
...Rooster.
rooster? Really?
you're a fine warrior.
I am.
so put your hands behind your back and get on your knees.
men kneel before me.
I do not bow to them.
gonna need some backup over here.
that is not what you need.
take me somewhere grand, deserving of a ruler, A queen.
I know just the place.
Lorelei's treachery remains unchanged, no matter the world.
we'll find them.
every agent in the area is out looking.
to what end, hmm?
the collar... has been broken.
short of death, we have no means to end her enchantment.
let me worry about that.
stay here.
and try not to punch a hole in my airplane.
so, Ward's what? Like, a pod person?
no, according to lady Sif, the men Lorelei controls don't forget who they are or what they know.
she just becomes the embodiment of all their desires.
so once we find them, we can break her mojo or whatever and get Ward back, right?
Yes, once the collar's back on Lorelei's neck, the enchantment ends, but that's the problem.
the collar caught a shotgun blast back in the desert.
you think you can fix it?
well... the metal, the weight -- It's similar to the berserker staff.
but it presents its own set of countless unknown variables.
got a couple hours.
what can I do?
and don't you dare say nothing or tell me to sit down here and count ceiling tiles while Ward is missing.
ward's got drop boxes and storage lockers all over the world.
they're filled with currency, weapons, I.D.s.
he's gonna use aliases, cash -- anything to keep Lorelei off the radar.
you're the best radar we have.
find them.
sir, may I have a moment?
it's about the GH-325.
have you found something?
no. I've hit a wall because of my limited resources.
the drug's chemical properties are foreign to me, which is startling in its own right.
we've been over this.
so I'm requesting once again to send a sample of Skye's blood to HQ for further study.
that's nottion.
Why?
I don't need to explain to you the benefits of this drug. You've experienced them first hand.
no. That's an order.
that's not a good-enough reason!
I have a duty to you, sir, as my commanding officer.
but I also have a duty as a S. H. I. E. L. D. scientist to pursue this, to save lives!
given Ward's recent situation, we should
two men laid down their lives in a compound rigged with explosives to keep this drug hidden.
we still don't know why.
until we do, until we speak with Fury and get some answers,
that drug and its mysteries stay in-house.
focus on the mission.
Lorelei has Ward, and we have no idea where she's taking him.
I am fortunate to have found you.
you are quite resourceful.
just well trained.
no. You are worlds apart from those men in the desert.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you value me no more than those bikers back there.
the truth is... I don't care.
because of what you feel?
I've felt something before for someone on my team.
it seems foolish now.
I would die for you.
any man would.
but I don't want them.
I want you.
you're stronger... a real man with the rage of a berserker inside.
you will present me with an army.
and I will give you a gift in return.
when I first arrived here, I thought earth left much to be desired.
but from here, it's quite beautiful.
I've spent the last 600 years locked away in a dark, cold cell...
my throat shackled... My voice silenced.
torture.
you never have to go back there.
but Sif is on the hunt.
she will not rest. She will not stop.
and I will not know peace.
so we take her out of the equation.
eliminate the threat.
the graves of Aasgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.
do not make the same mistake.
you do not know her.
no. I don't.
but the people she's working with now... I know them.
may I?
you have experience with swords.
Yes. But I prefer to use my hands.
admirable.
but be warned -- Lorelei is quite skilled at combat.
then why co-opt men?
why have them fight for her?
well...
...I believe it gives her a thrill... especially if the man is already taken.
and, besides, even the best warrior needs an army to conquer an empire.
so her pattern remains.
she attaches herself to the strongest warrior she can find
and then unleashes a swath of blood and destruction.
the man she's with -- Ward -- He's as lethal as any.
one of our best.
I see.
I've been where you are, Melinda May
a man I cared for, under her spell, so enchanted, forsook his family,
his friends, me.
steel yourself to do what might be necessary.
your agent Ward -- He's not mine.
well, that is certainly true now.
but agent Ward is no longer the man you knew.
he will not hesitate to kill you.
ward won't kill me.
do not let your feelings cloud your judgment.
I'm not.
he might try to kill me, but he won't.
security cameras just caught sight of them.
if Lorelei wants an army of wealthy, pliable men, I think she just hit the jackpot.
clear. - Clear.
clear.
she's gone.
turn this suite upside down. - Yes sir
I know you said you and Ward wouldn't be a problem.
but I also know you wouldn't tell me if it was.
Fitz, there are cameras everywhere in this town.
track them all.
no sign of them On any surveillance around the city.
it was a long shot.
ward knows how we work, knows to avoid cameras.
well, I expanded my search, got satellite support running.
we'll find them.
I do have a bit of good news.
I fixed Lorelei's neck collar.
let me inspect it to be sure.
Aasgardian metal is much different from the ore of this planet.
sure, but I think you'll find it's up to snuff.
it's in your room.
you and Ward have the same training.
you're cut from the same cloth.
if it was you, where would you run to?
Aasgardian metal is so dense. Just had to find the right tools, really.
but you'll see
not a scratch on it, because, yes... I am that good.
well done.
you really are quite clever.
if I was Ward, I wouldn't run.
I'd take out my main threat.
we're taking off.
why are we taking off?
what is that pounding?
I'll go and investigate.
you -- Stay put. I know.
someone locked us in.
Fitz?
sir.
ward and Lorelei are on the bus.
Where's the collar and Sif?
in there.
that's why I'm standing guard.
would not want Sif to get out and hurt Lorelei.
of course we wouldn't.
and Lorelei wants me to go down to the basement, keep an eye on the girls downstairs.
already locked them in.
cannot have them mucking up Lorelei's plan.
she's the best, isn't she, sir?
Yep.
she's something else.
aren't you the brave one?
you took my plane.
I want it back.
well... we can't always get what we want.
actually...I can.
I will retrieve Sif's sword.
it will look better in my hand.
ward, you don't want to do this.
this was the plan.
cross off Sif, take the plane, Eliminate anyone in our way.
get out of her way.
it's her plan, not yours.
fight it.
I know you. You're a fighter.
is this her?
the beautiful warrior with a heart of ice?
his heart now beats in concert with mine and mine alone.
no reason to make this about us.
he told me who he desired before me.
but, my dear... It wasn't you.
Where's Simmons?
what the hell are you doing?!
sir, are you...You?
of course I am!
Fitz has Sif trapped in the cage.
we need to unlock the door, get her out.
what?
coulson, they opened the airlock.
she's gone.
I'm afraid she was sucked out of the aircraft.
are you kidding? She's Aasgardian.
Sif's still out there.
unlock it. Let her in.
you, come with me. I need your help.
anything else I can do to be of service?
okay, good. Good. I'll be right here.
leave me in peace.
return to Aasgard.
while you remain here?
I think not.
here I will no longer pose a threat to Aasgard.
can you not let me be?
find some small mercy within your heart?
my heart has no place in this.
I have orders to bring you back.
all these years, and you're still the same Sif,
doing as you're told, heeling at the feet of those who command you...
never to get what you desire
not Haldorr, not...
Thor...
...a man who considers you more pet than woman.
hand me my sword, Lorelei.
see, that's the difference between you and I.
I don't take orders.
stay strong for me, baby girl.
you stay strong.
Simmons.
Hey, you're not supposed to be up here.
ward, I think we have a big problem!
you better get back here, Simmons.
you cannot be running about, okay?
Lorelei does not want any -- Fitz.
sir?
poor thing!
he's always getting knocked out, isn't he?
kill me.
you will not get off that easy.
Why? It's what you want.
I can see it in your eyes.
or would you rather hear about how the man you loved Followed me around like a dog...
...Hear of his touch, his kiss, the look in his eyes when I
you were saying?
sorry about this.
wait a minute.
I'm sorry. It's me.
okay?
I'm back.
he speaks the truth.
good to know.
my apologies.
the damage caused to your flying boat was unfortunate.
it's seen worse.
I assure you, Lorelei will be punished severely for the crimes against your people.
it must have been hard for you...
after everything she did, to move past it, to let it go.
Odin ordered her back alive.
as one of his warriors, I bow to his will.
regardless of what it cost you?
much like your S. H. I. E. L. D. we are bound by our code.
I am honored to have fought by your side.
I'll run diagnostics, see how much damage we're dealing with.
how much are you dealing with?
he didn't break anything, so -- Not what I meant.
you should talk to him, hash it out.
and you should take your own advice.
you've been sitting on something since the guest house.
if not with me, then with Skye.
she deserves to know what you saw down there.
I figure... I let you punch me again, repeatedly, just why don't you just
it's fine. - It's not.
I never intended... I didn't want to hurt
you didn't. That was never a risk with me.
I told you that.
you did.
seems like we're done here.
okay.
but if what Lorelei said was true...
...you were more honest with her than you are with yourself.
I'm not saying you were weak.
I'm saying all men are weak.
sir.
I understand why you had to punch me.
I forgive you.
can I get a moment alone with Skye, please?
Yeah.
I know that face, and something gives me a feeling I should be sitting down for this.
I've been looking for a way to tell you this, looking around for some answers,
something to help... explain...
...but I don't have any.
so... The drug, the one that saved us both
when we found it, I discovered something else.
its source.
it was...
alien.
A-alien, as in... unfamiliar?
no.
the minute I learned what it was, I tried to keep them from injecting you with it, but I was too late.
I'm so sorry, Skye.
you were trying to save my life.
you did save my life.
I was desperate to, and so I subjected you to unknown ramifications or side effects.
I'm sorry to say this, sir, but... so what?
we are alive.
and you've had that stuff in you for... uh, some time now, and you're okay, right?
Plus, you're not sprouting a pointy tail or anything, so bonus there.
I know nothing fazes you, but this should faze you.
we are completely in the dark on this.
that's where we live.
I'm an 0-8-4.
who knows what the hell that means?
at least we're in the dark together.
Yes.
but not for long.
to hell with any protocols or any code I used to be bound by.
we have a long list of questions we need answers for,
and we're going after them ourselves.
well, if the team's up for it
no. No, listen to me.
I trust them, but we need to protect them from this.
fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps
lied to me, lied to S. H. I. E. L. D. this is a powerful secret, a secret men died for.
until we know why, we can't share this with anyone, for their safety and ours.
got it.
so, what'll it be, A.C.?
what do we go after first?
the person responsible for this.
and we make him pay.
encrypted line secure.
agent Melinda May.
update log 93.
he knows.
I repeat... Coulson knows.
you really felt nothing for them.
I spent time with Coulson. He's a good man.
is that your badge?
they look like coordinates.
welcome, agent Coulson. We've been expecting you.
what is this place?
one of Fury's secret bases.
Eric Koenig, - agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. level 6.
what about Ward?
he and agent Hand should have dropped Garrett off at the fridge by now.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most secure facility is vulnerable right now.
Yeah, well... We're gonna raid it.
this is a hard drive with all of Simmons' research.
she programmed it to erase all data If anyone other than her attempts to access it.
you know what that means, Romeo.
you got your story straight?
I just need some time alone with her to get the information.
another example of this administration's Lack of transparency.
you can't seriously be blaming the president for this.
those who let S.H.I.E.L.D. Operate without oversight should be held accountable.
if your party held the white house, would you be taking this position?
if my party held the white house, we wouldn't be in this position.
I need a ride.
sorry. What?
I need a ride to Portland.
sorry, dude. I'm not going 200 miles out of my way just to give you a ride.
okay.
what the... All right, I give up. How did you do that?
like this.
...we cannot allow Hydra and their allies to rise again.
I'm afraid this might scar.
upside -- you'll look badass, Dangerous.
he's gonna be fine, though, right?
he will if you back up and give me some room.
so, what then?
by the time we got to the fridge, it was too late.
it was overrun -- hydra everywhere.
we couldn't stop them.
what were they after?
everything.
they took weapons, alien artifacts -- Anything they could grab.
I assume that means the prisoners are no longer prisoners?
So...Ian Quinn... - I'm sorry.
he's out. They all are.
and Garrett? Did he get away?
couldn't stop them from taking the fridge, But I wasn't gonna let Garrett walk...
not after what he did.
is he the one that did this to you?
he was a tough son of a bitch.
we need to make it believable.
"was"? Past tense?
as soon as I had the upper hand, I put two in the back of his head.
good.
one from me... - One from you.
I would have emptied the mag.
you're all set
well, I mean, as set as you can be with two cracked ribs and a zygomatic fracture.
uh, for those of you that don't know what that is, that's a...
hairline fracture to the cheekbone.
your body needs time to heal.
please take some time.
understood. Thanks.
one small victory.
hydra didn't get their hands on this.
a hard drive?
it's all the research our team's ever done,
downloaded off the plane and encrypted for safekeeping.
we should probably back it up now that - we're in a secure facility.
first, Skye, I need you on threat assessment.
pull up a list of all the inmates at the fridge.
I want to know just how bad this is.
this is really, really bad.
Quinn is the least scary of the bunch, and he shot me...Twice.
Quinn's more a sociopath.
a lot of those inmates are full-blown psychopaths -- Violent, impulsive.
and some with superpowers. Lovely.
is Marcus Daniels on the list?
that's him.
cross-check the list of inmates with crime databases, recent activity.
got a feeling we'll be seeing a slight uptick.
okay, but that'll take time, And more computing power than my laptop.
agent Koenig probably has some sort of -- I'm sure he'll lend a hand.
the plane you flew in on -- is it operational?
Yeah. You need me to pilot?
you heard Simmons.
you stay and get better.
I'm gonna take a splinter team out and start going after inmates on that list, starting with Mr. Daniels.
I think I know where he's going.
uh, you sure it's wise to split up the team, leave this base?
what if it's part of - hydra's plan -- a distraction?
she's got a point. I mean, fury brought you to this base for a reason.
we're safe here. - Yeah, we're safe here.
but what about everyone else
people who don't happen to have access to a top-secret underground shelter?
what about them?
I don't know if it's wise, but it's right.
I'm taking a team, - and that's the end of it.
no, you're not. Absolutely not.
you can't leave. There are protocols.
since the entire agency's pretty much collapsed, maybe now's not the time to stand on protocol.
okay, fine. Then forget protocols.
what part of "secret base" don't you get?
fury said to let you in, and you show up with a bunch of people?
agents!
whatever. The point is, they know where this place is now, and I don't know them.
hydra just released the entire population of the fridge into the wild.
there's gonna be violence.
people will die.
and I still consider it my duty to be the shield that protects them.
moving speech, truly.
but nobody leaves until they go through orientation.
orientation?
all right.
just gonna need you guys to answer a few questions, A few psychoanalytic, non sequitur questions.
a lie detector.
the lie detector, agent Coulson.
this baby measures galvanic skin response,
oxygen consumption, Micro-expressions, biofeedback brain waves, Pupil dilation, voice biometrics
96 variables in all.
fury designed this himself.
he wanted a lie detector Romanoff couldn't beat.
did she?
like fury would tell!
okay.
sooner we get this done, sooner we can get to work.
so who wants to go first?
we're gonna start - with some easy questions and establish a baseline.
can I have your full name?
Melinda Qiaolian May.
eye color? - Brown.
you ever been married? - Once.
have you ever been married?
no. - Please list your immediate family.
just me and my mum.
so you're not gonna mention your grandfather?
it's not something I advertise.
didn't want to be treated any different because I'm a legacy.
if I was the grandson of a howling commando, I'd have that tattooed on my chest.
what is your first name?
Skye.
and what is your last name?
only name. No family. No family name to inherit.
and you gave yourself the name Skye?
well, the name they gave me at the orphanage was Mary Sue Poots, so...
when we were kids, my brother and I used to give each other nicknames.
he called me lightning foot.
what's the difference between an egg and a rock?
edible.
not.
well, that's absurd.
the differences are -- ...Innumerable.
if you want, I can start listing them, but then -- ...We'll be here all day.
have you ever heard of project insight?
no. - No. - No.
ever had any contact with alexander pierce?
I've met him.
we shook hands.
Garrett would get a call from him once in a while, said they had mutual friends.
you wash up - on a deserted island alone.
sitting on the sand is a box.
what is in that box?
machete.
a sat phone so I can call someone to get me off that island.
how big is the box?
just say the first answer that comes into your mind.
what's in that box? - Simmons.
that's a hard one.
let me think.
the TARDIS.
I want to say my laptop, fully charged.
but I don't want to seem subversive with the rising tide and all
you're over-thinking it.
the laptop would be stupid, anyway. There's no WI-FI.
S.H.I E.L.D. No longer exists.
the agency has been labeled a terrorist organization.
so why are you here?
honestly... I'm not entirely sure.
we have to stick together, keep the people we trust close-by.
no one else, really.
my grandfather fought hydra back in the day.
the good guys won then.
we'll do it again.
Coulson.
it's the only home I've ever known.
congratulations, agent Skye.
let's go get you a lanyard.
got my backstage pass.
piece of cake?
if you don't mind talking about yourself.
so you'll hate it.
have fun.
what is your full name?
my name is Grant Douglas Ward.
please list your immediate family.
two parents, a sister, two brothers.
don't have contact with any of them.
boy, your baseline's getting a lot of spikes.
are you in pain?
Yeah, only when I breathe.
two broken ribs.
okay, well, try not to move. It may affect the results.
I'll try my best.
Marcus Daniels was an assistant at a physics lab
where they were trying to harness the electrical power of something called Darkforce.
and nothing bad ever happens when you work with something called "Darkforce."
it's a form of cosmic radiation, pure negative energy.
unstable but powerful.
you knew that already, didn't you?
Daniels was exposed, ended up being able to absorb energy
all types.
well, the human brain, the heart, run on electrical impulses.
exactly.
he can kill with one touch.
and I'm guessing he likes to.
do we need to put a bullet in him?
unfortunately, it's not that simple.
he can absorb the energy of most conventional weapons.
he sounds unstoppable.
like Fitz said, his power's unstable.
last time, we managed to capture him By overloading his system with pure light.
exposing him to more energy than he could absorb at once.
I'm sure we could engineer some sort of delivery mechanism enroute.
that's what I was hoping you were gonna say.
you mind flying, being the specialist on mission?
sir, I'll be whatever you want me to be.
that's what I was hoping you were gonna say.
what is the difference between an egg and a rock?
egg's a food. Rock's a weapon.
have you ever heard of project insight? - No.
ever made contact with alexander pierce? - No.
you wash up - on a deserted island alone.
sitting on the sand is a box.
what's in that box?
it would depend on the island -- Where it is, how big, what's the terrain?
is there fresh water?
just say the first thing that comes into your head.
a pistol.
s. H.I. E.L. D. No longer exists.
the agency has been labeled a terrorist organization.
so why are you here?
I'm an agent.
it's my duty.
I need you to give that to me again.
it's my duty.
I'm gonna ask you a follow-up.
agent ward, are you associated with hydra?
Yes. We all are.
they've infiltrated the highest levels of our organization.
like you mean it.
are you hydra?
I'm loyal to S. H.I. E.L. D...
to agent Coulson... and to my team.
do you have another agenda here?
I'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out.
after that, well... Cross off the team - and bring the girl to me.
agent Ward, - why are you really here?
Skye.
came back for her. I want to spend time with her.
Skye.
cool.
ward.
got my lanyard. - Nice.
so, are you guys taking off?
Yeah, I wish you were coming instead of trip.
he's insufferable, isn't he?
trip? - Yeah.
think the guy's okay.
I know. He's terrible. He's a horrible person.
you sure this is about him?
not about Simmons?
what the hell does that mean?
everything is falling apart around us.
we don't know how it'll end.
if there's something you want to tell her, don't wait.
maybe Simmons should check you again for a head injury...
... 'cause that's not the ward that I know.
you know what? Do what you want. I don't care.
good to have you back.
I should be flying this mission.
I made another call.
stay here.
get the fuel line repaired on the bus.
I remember - when you brought Daniels in.
I know how personal this is for you, but
we don't do personal... Not anymore.
Phil, the polygraph cleared me.
I'm not hiding anything.
you mean you're not hiding anything else, unless you do know who was behind the Tahiti project.
I didn't ask.
I was ordered not to.
and you would have done the same thing.
our job is to follow orders.
it's also our job - to determine right from wrong.
watching someone in agony, searching for the truth,
not saying anything -- that's wrong.
look, I was just trying -- And don't tell me it's because you care so damn much.
Fury's no longer around telling you what to do, so why are you here?
you want some orders to follow?
follow mine, or find somewhere else to be.
how can you be sure he's going to Portland?
Daniels was obsessed with a woman there.
he called her his only light in the darkness.
that's almost romantic!
almost.
the man's been locked up in the fridge for years.
he must be over her by now.
some people are hard to get over.
besides, Daniels is pathologically insane, Single-minded, obsessive.
his powers not only robbed him of a normal life, they also pretty much fried his brain.
what about the woman?
Audrey Nathan.
she's how we tracked him the first time.
we find Ms. Nathan, we find Daniels.
Audrey Nathan!
W-what?!
there --there -- there's a man after me!
no, we know. - We're with the CIA. Get in!
Mr. Daniels, - we don't want to hurt you.
we need to take you in, for your safety and the safety of others.
it was you!
you took me there!
they did things to me there!
they were trying to contain you.
No!
they were trying to make me stronger.
and they did.
here's where we'd normally call for reinforcements.
Where'd he go?
here's something -- Police report out of morocco, attempted murder.
the victim says the guy appeared out of nowhere, Disappeared into thin air.
Yeah, you just described every mugging ever.
aren't you clever?
aren't you sneaky?
using these to keep watch on all of us.
what?
we have been killing ourselves trying to guess where these guys went.
but what if we could see it, get visuals on where the prisoners went after leaving the fridge?
that's a good idea, but, uh, Right now S. H.I. E.L. D. Sat surveillance is dark.
ours aren't the only ones up there.
well, the only other satellites in the vicinity that could have -- The NSA.
you want to hack the NSA?
that's a bad idea, Skye.
that's a terrible idea.
the NSA's already got S.H.I.E.L.D. on its watch list.
why poke the bear -- The big, scary, waterboarding bear?
I thought you were a comms agent, not agent of playing video games while hiding in a bunker.
you can't goad me into...
can you help me convince Steve Rogers here to suit up, Grab his shield, head into battle?
okay?
who's he supposed to battle?
if we hack NSA satellites, we can get footage - from the fridge breakout,
see who was there, where they went.
well, she's right. It's worth trying.
you know, I can't hack the NSA,
but maybe I can upload the hard drive you gave me,
get the specs on the weapons they might be carrying.
Absolutely. We should. But we can't.
the encryption is location-based.
we'll have to take a field trip at some point to decrypt it.
okay! All right. Color me impressed.
now impress me more.
get me that footage.
these are the keys to the communication satellite room.
the mainframe is in there.
start the hack but then send the feed to these monitors.
let's live dangerously.
Yeah!
how long before you get visuals?
NSA satellites should be tough.
give me an hour.
great. - This is exciting.
let's see if being sneaky pays off.
we should be safe here.
I thought he was locked up.
he escaped from prison.
you don't have to worry.
that's why we're here. We're gonna keep you safe.
"we"?
meaning the CIA?
of course. - That's what I said, isn't it?
we're the CIA, The central intelligence agency... people.
you're not.
you're S.H.I.E.L.D. aren't you?
we're just trying to help.
we're not the bad guys.
I know.
I don't believe what they're saying about S.H.I.E.L.D. The agency saved my life once before.
a few years ago, I saw Daniels at one of my concerts, front row.
then I started seeing him at all of them. At first, I was flattered.
cellists don't get many groupies.
but then one night, - I saw him outside of my house.
I was terrified.
I begged him to leave me alone.
he just stood there, saying I was his light.
I didn't understand what he meant until he started blacking out my entire block.
I ran and called the police.
they didn't believe me.
but then an S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent came to my door.
I don't know why, - but I trusted him right away.
something about his face -- the handsome part, maybe.
he just swooped in. It was like... out of a movie.
you two were...Close?
very.
he promised me he would stop Daniels.
and that's exactly what he did.
that's why I know - I can trust S.H.I.E.L.D.
Phil never lied to me.
Phil? - Agent Phillip Coulson?
I've heard the name.
is that -- Audrey was -- You two were...
Yeah. - Okay.
what happened to him?
he died in the line of duty.
I don't know the details.
we were planning a trip up the coast, and then I got the call.
you must miss him.
for so long after he died, everything reminded me of him.
I still dream about him sometimes, just us together, laughing.
I wake up feeling like he's watching over me.
it's nice.
maybe you should go in there.
no, she's healing.
she's getting on with her life.
we should help her do that.
I think I know a way, how to stop Daniels for good.
but we would have to use her to draw him out.
no. Do you understand?
that's not acceptable.
well, it's not ideal, - but there's no other choice.
I won't put her in danger again. That's not fair to her.
but, sir, I'm sorry, - but she's already in danger.
and you said it yourself -- Daniels is single-minded.
he's dangerous. He won't stop until he gets what he wants.
how's it coming?
is the bus operational?
still banged up, but she's ready to fly.
the fuel line's been repaired, and the tank's full.
what's the range on this thing?
just under 10, 000 miles.
are you leaving?
Yeah.
I was here for Coulson.
but he can't see past me lying to him.
I get why you did it.
when you get orders, you don't question 'em.
you follow 'em... No matter the price.
Yeah, well, - this price was too high.
I lost him.
Coulson doesn't want me here.
he doesn't need me.
so, what should I tell him?
whatever you want.
he won't hear it.
how's it going?
believe it or not, Skye got us in!
we have access to the NSA's complete sat-feed history!
that girl's good.
I can see why you like her.
uh, the images are a little patchy, But they're gonna clear up any second.
uh, I guess living on the edge really pays off sometimes.
Yeah. Sometimes.
what if he doesn't show?
before they put him away, He never missed a rehearsal, right?
no. - Then he won't this time, either.
don't worry.
we'll be close.
all you need to do is keeping playing until Daniels gets close to the stage.
we'll do the rest.
last time, there were two whole teams of S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.
see up there?
our best agents are watching.
I promise.
they won't let anything happen to you.
I pulled these - from the jet's power reserves.
Simmons made me wear gloves.
she's so uptight, that one.
sir.
good.
can they stop him?
okay, well, this will modify the frequency and wavelength of the stage lights,
although technically they wouldn't be lights at that point. More like gamma rays.
tell me this will work.
I gave Daniels to S.H.I.E.L.D. to rehabilitate him.
turns out, they just gave him an upgrade.
well, I mean, there's a slight chance He would absorb the energy and gain more power,
but it's unlikely.
who did you say created this technology, again?
Bruce Banner.
then I'm sure it'll go off without a hitch.
Eric.
Eric?
you did it.
Koenig said you managed to hack the NSA.
Yeah, it looks that way.
where did he go?
he's sending everything over to NATO, CIA, INTERPOL.
guess he hopes they'll take it as a sign of good faith from S.H.I.E.L.D.
that's smart. Though, looks like all I got was lots of views of an empty rooftop.
may's gone.
what do you mean "gone"? Gone where?
she left.
I'm sure if I asked where, she wouldn't have told me.
so, no goodbye? No nothing?
she never felt anything for us, did she?
she just played us so she could keep an eye on Coulson.
that was her mission.
did you feel anything for her?
um... no.
the only comfort we took in each other was knowing we didn't have to.
you can't choose to feel.
usually, I can.
it's different with us.
"us" is a strong word.
I mean, I know I kissed you, but to be fair, I thought there was a 97% chance we were gonna... Die.
but we didn't die.
which is good.
Yes, that is very good.
but there's still no rush on us being an "us."
it's not like it's a good time to start anything.
there's never a good time.
we've got to start somewhere.
you better get going.
Daniels will be here soon.
why don't you tell her the truth -- That you're still alive?
sir, it's just - the way she talks about you Sounds like you two had something nice.
we did.
so it's not because - you're afraid to talk to her.
I don't want to hurt her again.
besides, it's not like I can stay.
we have a job to do.
Yeah.
if that's how you felt, you had a funny way to show it.
specialists don't spend time with a lot of people.
the ones we do, we're all cut from the same cloth.
black Kevlar?
trained to get the job done, Keep emotions in check.
but you -- you're different.
"different" bad?
bad for me.
I didn't want to think about you. I wanted to stay focused.
and then I saw you after you were shot... Fighting to stay alive?
but you're right. I'm Kevlar.
you're not. - You don't have to be.
you don't have to shut people out.
Yeah, I do.
there are things about me... That you wouldn't like if you knew.
you think I don't have skeletons?
it's different.
you're... Good.
so are you.
not always.
I lied to you.
my older brother... He didn't beat up my younger brother.
he was crueler than that.
he made me do it.
and I let him.
I was afraid of him.
what about your parents?
they were worse.
I am not a good man, Skye.
Yes, you are.
Yeah, one of my -- one of my cuts must have just opened up.
let me help. Let me help.
no, no, no, no. No.
I just need to clean up.
there you are, Eric.
no.
keep playing.
I'm sorry I scare you.
I know that I'm a monster.
but you're the one that can save me.
come on.
Eric?
that's weird.
Eric?
Eric.
ward.
Jemma.
no.
please!
no, no.
no. no.
Skye?! Skye!
he's Hydra.
okay.
okay, okay.
Skye!
you're safe.
I'm still here.
I promise. I'm still here with you.
Phil.
are you okay?
I... I thought... He was here.
seemed so real this time.
see what we want to see, I guess.
I guess so.
think I'd be hiding in a closet?
I was wondering where you went.
I went back to the room.
you weren't there.
why did you leave?
truth?
I'd appreciate it.
you scared me.
opening up, and that kiss -- which...Was a very nice kiss, I admit.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I don't exactly over-analyze.
I just act impulsively, and then I freak out after the fact.
are you still?
no. I'm good.
I want this.
and you?
what do you want?
what I want... Is to stay here with you and imagine the world outside doesn't exist.
but the world outside does exist.
I just got word from Fitz.
they need our help.
the bus is fueled up, ready to go.
we should tell Koenig.
I just did.
he's headed outside to open the hangar doors. We're in a hurry.
I just got to grab a couple things.
we need to go right now.
of course we do.
lead the way.
sir. Is everything okay?
she said I never lied to her.
today, I did.
but she's alive and safe.
we did that, at least.
why didn't you tell her the truth?
I will.
someday, I guess, when there's a chance she'll understand.
when we get back, I need to make things right with may.
how can I expect Audrey to forgive me if I'm not willing to do the same?
I'm gonna check with trip and see how much longer we have.
we need to talk.
we do?
agent Triplett thinks he's done something to upset you.
Fitz, if you're questioning his loyalty in any way, I can assure you
it's not him.
well, what is it, then?
uh... You know how I can be.
I hate change.
Where's our bus?
and our team?
I don't know.
it's so beautiful.
so, are we off to Portland?
actually, Fitz thinks the 0-8-4 plasma ray we found in Peru might help.
didn't we jettison that to the sun?
Yeah, but Fitz has the specs on it.
on the hard drive.
you need me to decrypt the hard drive.
the team does.
and since it's coupled to specific coordinates, Agent Skye... You're in charge.
where to next?
what are you doing?
we have to go.
500 miles.
what?
500 miles, and I don't even get a "thank you.
I was just about to
it's too late.
...thank you.
I said too late.
you can call anybody you like.
why me?
I needed someone I can trust.
that bad, huh?
did you get it?
I may be retired, - but I still have contacts.
and my agency hasn't fallen apart.
you're not the only one looking, you know.
she won't be hard to find.
I know.
ward is hydra.- No. I-I don't believe it.
you think I don't - want to watch him suffer?
not suffer -- die.
tell us how to unlock the drive.
I start the hack.
and once we reach altitude, it unlocks.
now bring him back.
these vials - contain the raw materials of whatever Jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead.
I can't succeed without your help.
we'll need a base of operations, weapons, tactical backup.
there is no backup.
it's over.
there is no s. H.I. E.L. D. Anymore.
grant ward?
my name's John Garrett.
the quartermaster - at your military school's an old buddy of mine.
he told me about a pissed-off young cadet with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination who went awol,
stole a car,- drove over a thousand miles home Only to try -and burn the place down.
I must say, I find a young man like that intriguing.
I'm curious.
did you know your brother was in the house when you set it on fire?
no, sir, I did not.
I was a pyro as a kid, too.
ended up making - a pretty good living at it.
I'm here to make you - a one-time offer, so listen up.
your family's lawyer's gonna be here in about 20 minutes.
not only are your folks pressing charges against you for arson and attempted murder,
but your older brother's petitioning the court to have you tried as an adult.
now, you can spend the next few years locked up in a cage,
blaming mommy and daddy and mean older brother for your problems,
or you can let me get you out of here and teach you how to be a man.
I work for a secret organization that's always looking to recruit young men like you.
and why should I trust you?
you shouldn't.
don't trust anybody, ever, especially me.
let me be clear -- Going with me will be the hardest thing you've ever done.
but on the other hand, no one will ever screw with you again.
say yes.
it'll be hard but fun.
10 seconds, - and I walk out that door.
say yes.
Yes.
everybody down!
on the ground!
I told you it was gonna be fun.
eyewitnesses claim the assailant Smashed through several walls
before killing Colombia's most notorious drug lord, Alejandro Castillo, A.K. A. El Dogo.
speculation continues as to whether this superhuman assassination Was carried out by a man, monster, or machine.
the correct answer is "d," all of the above.
what the hell - is Deathlok doing in Bogota?
and why would he kill a drug lord with known ties to hydra?
well, if they really are in Colombia,
then Garrett and our hijacked plane aren't even in American airspace.
I have to expand our search.
guys... You want to come in here for a minute?
this is just about everything we've been dealing with.
and this...
...Connects them all.
Cybertek built Deathlok, shipped items to Quinn, Who was working for the clairvoyant,
who turned out to be Garrett, who planted ward on our bus Because he wanted to know why I didn't stay dead.
should have drawn another chart for this part.
no, I get it -- Garrett's been developing centipede serum all this time.
Yes. - He wants gh-325 as its final ingredient
a way to stabilize and regenerate his centipede soldiers.
and it's why ward came back for the hard drive.
it had all of your research about Coulson and Skye.
it's all on there.
but that's not the only thing on there.
Skye left them a little surprise.
a Trojan Horse.
it's been slowly mapping every system they've uploaded it to.
well, that's brilliant. - Trojan horse. You can wake it up - and take over their systems. - Well done, Skye.
Yeah. Thanks.
except it doesn't work that way because I didn't - have enough time to build it,
so we need to plug this into one of their computers To activate it.
spoiler alert -- - we can't seem to find one.
I think we have.
Garrett and Cybertek have been working together for years.
if it's on Garrett's system... It's on Cybertek's.
which is why we're gonna go into one of their offices.
we have no authority to do this.
we're no longer - s. H.I. E.L. D. Agents.
we're... We're vigilantes.
I was gonna say, "doing this because it's the right thing to do,
But...Yeah.
so, if you're with me, I'm gonna finish what I started.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let Garrett and ward get away with murder.
and I want my plane back.
I could have - crossed off that drug lord without getting my picture taken.
single shot, half a mile away.
you're missing the point.
I didn't want to just cross him off. I wanted to make a spectacle.
people are killed by guns every day in Bogota.
but how often does a monster Punch a drug lord's head clean off?
hell, - that's international news.
spectacular thing - you did back there, Mikey.
if I didn't know better, I'd swear you're starting to enjoy your job.
you get the impression he's enjoying his job?
somebody does.
well, I'd like to think we all enjoy our work.
and why not?
these are exciting times full of rewards.
which reminds me... Zeller.
Yeah, it's me.
stream Mike Peterson some video of his son this afternoon.
don't mention it.
how about that guy?
I've turned him into a new man.
is that what he is?
are you still sore about what he did to you?
no, I'm sore at you for making him do it.
look, we're on the verge of completing something I've been chasing for 25 years.
can't you just be happy for me?
see?
that's what I'm talking about.
happy campers.
I think you'll be happy, too.
we're close to replicating the drug that healed Skye and brought Coulson back to life.
the data from Skye's hard drive, All that research -- been a big help.
I've uploaded everything to the lab in Cuba.
they'll have initial results by the time we land.
you never disappoint, do you, flowers?
wish everyone on my team had the same success rate.
okay. We'll see you this afternoon.
we're on with the R&D department up at Cybertek's Palo Alto offices.
it'll be okay, Fitz.
no matter how deep they dig, they'll only find - the new identities I've created.
it's not that.
it's the idea of giving them access to all of our designs.
we're not actually giving them anything.
we just need to get inside so we can plug Skye's flash drive into one of their computers.
you don't have to go.
it's not that, either.
it's ward.
what if Garrett put an exploding eye into him, to control him?
maybe that's why he betrayed us.
I'm pretty sure - there's a much simpler reason.
he's evil.
well, I don't believe that people are born evil.
something must have happened.
Hey, sorry it took so long.
my mom's real sentimental about granddad's howling commando stuff.
trip was generous enough to offer up some of his granddad's spy tech to help us out,
so we should systematically take a full inventory of ev-- Oh, my god.
is that a handheld Hypno-Beam?
one of the original betas.
see how it has the switch on the bottom?
the production models moved it to the side.
this is amazing. Almost as cool as a...
transistorized blast gun. - Transistorized blast gun.
okay.
the two of you can get a room later, but we have a plane to catch.
no.
where did they buy this stuff, from the back of a comic book?
no, girl, that's not really a joy buzzer. That's an E.M.P. Knocks power out - in about a 10-foot radius.
Yeah. A lot of vintage S.H.I.E.L.D. Spy craft was designed to look innocent in case a spy was caught.
like, um... Okay.
like these smokes.
Thanks, trip. This is a huge help.
gives us a fighting chance against these bad guys.
Oh, Fitz.
watch out, hydra. Here we come.
I'm gonna retire out here one day.
a thousand acres - of Wyoming woods and meadows, Already paid for.
speak up, son. I'm not a mind reader.
what if the police find us?
nobody's looking.
family will be happy to never see you again.
as for cops, well... They do best when they stay out of s. H.I. E.L. D.'s way.
so, is s. H.I. E.L. D. Academy near here?
right now, - you have more pressing issues, like what you're gonna eat tonight.
I-I thought that was our dinner.
no, this is my dinner.
I shot them, I eat them.
hell, buddy deserves these birds more than you do.
he retrieved them.
out here, son, if you want something, you have to earn it.
for here on out, you earn everything.
you want a warm place to sleep, you make it.
you want something to eat, you kill it.
wait, wait. Y-you can't be serious.
all -- all I have in here are some clothes. Right? This isn't fair.
if you'd have told me, I-I'd have brought tools or food
stop blaming me for your own failure!
makes me not like you.
you want it easy?
go back to juvie.
they'll give you three squares and a cot.
confirm what your family believes, what everybody believes
that grant ward is weak and worthless.
I'll tell you what -- I'll leave buddy here.
you take care of him, - maybe he'll take care of you.
I'll be back in a couple of months.
either you'll be here or you won't.
it's up to you.
but for what it's worth... ...I believe you can do it.
welcome to Cybertek.
sit. Please.
I'm Ott, senior V. P. of R&D.
this is Diaz.
I'm Theo Tittle. This is Dr. Roum.
thanks so much for seeing us on such short notice.
we've met with a number of other former s. H.I. E.L. D. Scientists recently,
and I must say, thus far, we're... underwhelmed.
hydra, on the other hand, less constrained in their thinking, and younger.
usually younger. - Yeah.
I told you we should have gone in.
Oh, hush.
may looks barely a day over... 30.
you're gorgeous.
score one - for the howling commandos.
your grandpa's pin should help me locate Cybertek's mainframe.
I didn't know they had Wi-Fi back in the day.
they didn't. - That's the beauty of the pin.
it uses uhf to search for data.
nobody's even scanning those frequencies for potential leaks.
that's weird.
I'm not finding any digital data about anything, Let alone a source for it.
how is that possible?
maybe it's protected.
Or...insulated somewhere inside?
guys, just keep them busy a minute longer.
Okay,now, - show them the icer bullet.
I designed this to be powerful...
I designed this to be powerful, nonlethal, and to break
break up under subcutaneous tissue.
and my challenge was that it could only hold a dose of...
85 micrograms of dendrotoxin.
he should have run the specs by me before building the molds.
but I think - we can all agree that the...
...that the true beauty is in my hyperconcentrated...
...Dendrotoxin formula... ...My cartridge-case...
...Cartridge-case - ejection system, obviously.
...Concentrated dendrotoxin formula with compressed air expulsion.
we've seen - one of these bullets before.
what did they use it with?
the sleepy-sleep gun, I think.- That's right.
our team - took this rudimentary concept And converted it into an aerosol grenade.
much more useful.
but this is an icer!
Yes, but this is an icer.
triple the stopping power and a much cooler...Name.
what else do you have?
here we go.
building permits - Cybertek's filed in the city.
there's something funky about the fourth floor.
only one way in or out.
Extra-reinforced security door.
that's got to be it, right?
coulson, May, - can you get to the fourth floor?
it's a shame it didn't work out.
it is.
so lovely meeting you both.
does your sweater itch?
a little bit.
I don't know - if I've said it enough, but... I'm glad you're back.
try not to set the drapes on fire.
Skye, I think I know why you couldn't find the mainframe.
there isn't one.
what do you mean there isn't one?
all the files are hard copies.
that's why granny was typing during our meeting.
well, we're here. Might as well look around.
you're staring at me again.
you gave them my son.
all I see - are pictures of him in a cell.
I was following orders.
just like you.
so, is someone playing god with you, too?
seeing everything you see?
waiting to push a button and blow a hole in your skull If you disobey?
is there? - No.
then why are you here?
for you and others like you -- people with gifts.
I'm waiting for what's inside to be revealed.
the girl, Skye... - What do you know about her?
where does she come from?
why do you care?
because inside, I believe she and I have something in common.
Coulson?
Mike Peterson's file.
how can this all be project Deathlok?
1990?
how far back does this thing go?
Garrett was the first Deathlok.
let's go.
Skye, Trip, get ready for a large file transfer.
how large?
back it up!
you were gonna let me die!
okay. First off, I think - we should use our indoor voices.
since the day we met, I have done everything you asked.
not sure we can say "everything.
you were gonna let Deathlok kill me to get that hard drive?
come on. We both know the girl wasn't gonna let you die.
you said yourself Skye's a soft touch, just like you.
I am not that scared kid anymore.
then stop acting like it!
stop being weak.
all these years, and you're still playing the victim.
sometimes I ask myself why I ever bothered.
John! John!
everybody out! Now!
Yeah. Here we go.
I said, "get the hell out!
you heard the man!
hang in there.
I'll get you stabilized.
Garrett started project Deathlok Way back in 1990.
look at this.
he was patient zero.
we've been looking at all this backwards.
Garrett doesn't just want gh-325 for his centipede soldiers.
he wants it for himself so he can become a real, live boy again.
and if he happens to create an army of programmed super soldiers
for hydra along the way, triple bonus points.
how do we know Garrett didn't do that to ward, too?
maybe he's been programmed.
Fitz, when are you going to stop clinging to the idea that ward's the victim and not the perpetrator?
when I see something that tells me I shouldn't with my own two eyes.
we don't know all the facts.
you want a fact, Fitz?
ward murders people.
I should have let mike finish him when I had the chance.
I'm stupid and...weak.
you weren't weak.
you had compassion. That's harder.
we'll find him.
pizza delivery for Pablo Jimenez?
that's me.
biomechanics rebooting.
there. That should do it.
you scared me.
hasn't happened like that in a while.
Yes, it has.
been happening more and more.
the biomechanics are fine.
it's my organs that are failing.
what are you saying, john?
I'm dying.
Cybertek team - gives me a month, two tops.
you never came out to eat.
not much of an appetite.
look... Fitz can't process the truth about ward, not yet.
what he said... It's what he needs to believe.
do you think ward's being controlled?
absolutely not.
neither do I.
you know, - I never gave you enough credit for this whole Zen-warrior thing.
but I got to admit, it'd be nice to feel nothing right now.
you think I don't feel anything?
look at you.
you're a statue.
and you and ward had a thing.
so if anyone should be furious -- I am.
I'm furious.
but I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it on a tantrum.
I'm gonna mine it, save it...
and when we find ward, I'm gonna use every bit of it to take him down.
wish I knew - how to use that hate-ful.
I'm up most mornings at 5: 00.
trip I. D. 'd a number of Cybertek shipments that ping-ponged across the globe
brazil, Cambodia, Syria -- but they all ended up in Havana.
s. H.I. E.L. D. - Used to have a base there.
I told you we'd find him.
we're going to Cuba.
5 bucks.
that's it, huh?
same thing cost me $30 in Rome.
there it is -- the face of our future.
Mr. Quinn's the poster boy for our new enterprise.
not sure how that's supposed to work.
he's also an international fugitive, Accused of a laundry list of crimes.
accused by S.H.I.E.L.D. of whom I've been a vocal critic for years.
now S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gone down in flames while I rise from the ashes, all charges dismissed and my sterling reputation restored.
I knew there was a reason I didn't rip out - that silver tongue of yours.
everything on schedule?
your flamboyant display in Bogota got a lot of people's attention.
I'll be in d. C. tomorrow, capitalizing on it.
good.
it's Raina.
maybe she has news.
okay, Ernesto, let's show them what handsome really looks like.
everything okay?
everything's fine.
you have a problem with the drug?
this isn't about the drug.
I thought agent Garrett Shared my interest in special people, In transformation.
but now I realize - he was just afraid to die.
so I'm not sure how interested he'll be In what I found out about Skye.
Skye?
I probably shouldn't be talking to you about this.
I should go straight to Garrett.
Garrett's got more important things to worry about.
you can tell me instead.
I've been looking through the files that Skye downloaded from the plane.
and in addition to medical records, I found hospital files, adoption-agency searches.
Skye's an orphan.
been looking for her parents for a while. It's not exactly a secret.
but that's what intrigued me.
that and her DNA.
it appears to be a match for someone I heard about a long time ago.
you know something about Skye's history?
I can't confirm it's her, But I did hear a story about a baby girl.
years ago, a village in the Hunan province in china.
it was destroyed, - every man, woman, and child Torn apart by monsters trying to find that baby.
did the monsters kill the baby's parents?
no. That's what's so interesting.
baby's parents work for monsters
give me one reason not to blow your head off.
I brought tacos.
I was half expecting you to be long gone.
I was half expecting you to never come back.
you said a couple of months.
it's been six.
been out of the country on assignment.
seems like you and buddy did okay without me.
first few weeks were rough.
but then I realized my thinking was limited.
so I started raiding cabins.
got some tools, the tent.
life got easier.
gonna build a cabin, over there.
see? I told you you could do it.
damn, son, - you stepped up in a big way.
I couldn't be prouder if you were my own.
I lied about the tacos.
what's that for?
your next lesson.
your turn.
stick with me, kid. In a couple years, - you'll shoot better than that.
something about that woman unnerves me.
it's those eyes.
no, it's what's behind those eyes.
what did she text you about earlier?
she had questions about your decision To pack up the lab and move it to the states.
I planned to expand operations anyway.
the fact that the Deathlok files were stolen from Cybertek Just speeds up my decision.
I heard you wanted to hang on to this during the flight.
you heard right.
you've re-created gh-325.
almost.
we've distilled the genetic components of all the previous samples down to one single vial.
and it'll do what we talked about?
it should regenerate and heal cells, just like it did in Skye and Coulson.
so take good care of it.
that's the only one in the world.
you sure - you don't want anything else?
how about one of these quarter walkie-talkies?
they have a built-in homing beacon.
okay. I'll keep one, too. - Thanks.
don't want to be greedy. We've already got the dwarfs.
no problem.
all right.
because we had to fly in low, we have to search for our plane on the ground.
Fitz, Simmons, you have the maps.
do not engage under any circumstances.
if you find the bus, call us and stand down or come back here and wait.
we'll be careful. - Understood, sir.
let's do it.
we're too late. They're gone.
they knew we were coming.
I'm not sure everyone's gone. Something's generating a lot of volts in there.
yeah?
sir, we found the bus.
it's on an airfield outside Abel Santamaria packing up to leave.
we're on our way.
how far is that from our location?
about three hours, but by the looks of it,
they'll be long gone by the time you can get here, sir.
get out of there right now.
do not engage.
wait for us back at the jump jet.
copy that, sir.
Garrett's leaving.
we have to at least try and get over there.
or not.
we still have this little puppy.
if there's a computer system in that barber shop, We don't have to chase him anymore.
we just plug it in, - we wake up the Trojan horse, and we're off to the races.
worth a shot.
let's do it.
I know - we're not supposed to engage.
but if they get away, - we'll be back to square one.
I can't handle square one again.
Garrett's there, which means ward's probably there, too.
what if we send a dwarf into the plane from here?
it can stow away inside So we can track where the bus is going.
Yes. Simmons, excellent suggestion.
we can send sleepy. He's our best listener -- next to you, of course.
okay. I'll go get him from the car.
long time, no see.
there you go. There you go.
you know he's not human, right?
of course I know.
no, he's better than human.
smart, loyal, trustworthy.
Yeah.
where does all that trust and loyalty lead?
abandoned in the woods or dumped at the pound?
I learned that lesson the hard way.
I know you've never asked, but I'm sure you're curious.
nickel version?
I got fragged by an I. E.D. Outside of Sarajevo.
when I radioed for medevac, I got nothing - but an earful of excuses.
that's when I realized - I was more loyal to s. H.I. E.L. D. than S.H.I.E.L.D. was to me.
so I decided if I made it out, if I survived,
I was gonna treat them the way they treated me.
then I stuffed my intestines back inside, Duct-taped myself shut, and humped my way out.
you remember when we first met?
I told you I worked - for a secret organization?
well, it's more like - I work for a secret organization inside another secret organization.
you ever heard of hydra?
hydra understands - the importance of survival.
here they are.
this is our plane.
we want it back.
Really?
just like that, kid?
Coulson probably figured out we're using the barbershop.
call Kaminsky. He'll know what to do.
all right, let's close up the ramp and get this bird off the ground.
tell the pilot to keep it low in a harrier mode until we're out over the gulf.
we'll do
what's he got there?
one of those prank joy buzzers.
Yeah. You know me -- always kidding around.
what the hell was that?
an e. M.P. - Looks like the joke's on you.
Garrett's dying!
not sure this will work.
Fitz shorted him out with an e. M.P. Call Cybertek.
let them know what happened. See what they can do.
back.
I'm glad that I did it.
you hear me?
you lose, we win.
you're dead.
well, no worse than you. And you don't have to take orders from him anymore, ward.
ward!
let him die.
he deserves to die.
get them out of here!
clear! Everybody out!
I have some good news.
can it wait a minute?
damn dog takes off running every time I take a shot out here.
that deer's 1, 800 meters out.
it'll take him awhile to find it.
I'm all ears.
you've been accepted by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s operations division, effective immediately.
we need to pack up.
thank you, sir, for everything.
don't do that.
you don't owe me or anybody else a thing.
you earned it by yourself.
it's gonna be hard when you get there.
if you're gonna work - within s. H.I. E.L. D. For hydra,
you can't ever get attached to anyone or anything.
you have to fight that weakness in you.
Yes, sir. - Good.
now take care of buddy, and we'll get out of here.
that's not a weakness, is it?
no, sir. - Good.
I'll be at the truck.
internal battery must have fried.
I'm gonna have to open it up, see if there's a mechanical fix.
I talked to Cybertek.
they're prepping a facility in Miami.
good.
I need you to do something for me.
Yeah. Anything.
put down Fitz and Simmons.
what? No. We have plenty of time. I won't leave you.
and I'm telling you to cross them off for me.
that's not a weakness, is it?
no. - Then take care of them.
I'll take care of me.
I've cheated death plenty of times. - I'll stay.
Skye, where are the computers?
I'm working on it.
trip, anything in your granddad's kit Might help us out here?
always.
let me take a look.
there's a mechanical failsafe in case the electronics shut down.
I'm pretty interesting inside.
that's my centipede serum.
it's the only thing - that's been keeping me alive these past few months.
why isn't it making you strong?
I'm too far gone.
I'm afraid your entire system is shutting down.
maybe you can jump-start it... with this.
Coulson will find us, won't he?
man won't rest until every hydra agent Is either dead or behind bars.
go!
go.
Oh, no! - Go, go!
open the door, Fitz.
ward, please... I need to understand.
you need to accept the truth, Fitz.
he doesn't care about us, about anything.
no. I don't believe that.
we're friends, aren't we?
we've been friends. We've had laughs together.
I know that - you're a good person, ward.
and you can choose right now to be good.
it's a choice.
I've got my orders.
open up the door.
no. - Not a chance.
okay. Have it your way.
wait. What are you doing?
Fitz.
okay. Wait. - What are you doing?
wait. - No, no, no.
okay, wait. - Ward, just think about this.
wait, ward. Ward. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!
just give it a second!
wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay, okay! Just loo... ward, look at me! - Think about this!
ward, just turn around!
don't do it!
don't do it, ward!
okay, you don't have to do this!
ward!
you don't have to! You have a choice!
ward! Ward, look at me!
I know that you care about us, ward!
you're right. I do. It's a weakness.
ward! Ward!-Ward!
I can't promise it'll work.
and once it's gone, I won't be able to make any more.
this is the end of the road.
without it, I'm dead for sure.
So...What the hell?
that's it.
the final ingredient.
is it done?
if the job was easy
what are you feeling?
the universe.
come on.
over here.
there's something behind this wall.
okay, I got something.
secret door?
I got this.
they're like my thing.
here we go.
finally.
it's a centipede soldier.
Bogota was a freebie, a calling card, A demonstration of what we can do.
it was a circus.
it was a single man with no support team And no extraction plan.
I mean, come on. Tell me -- how much did you spend to get bin laden?
between the ships and the choppers and the support troops, what was it?
$30 million? $50 million?
whatever the price, it was worth it.
maybe.
my super soldier could have done it for a fraction of the price.
is that why you're here?
are you proposing to sell us this super soldier of yours?
God, no.
I'm proposing to sell you a thousand of them.
better, stronger, faster.
gentlemen, - with the continued exposure of corrupt institutions like S.H.I.E.L.D.
with the terrifying rise of hydra, the need for reliable security is at an all-time high.
which is why we are expanding our super-soldier operations into a brand-new,
we should have seen Hydra coming.
but they don't stand a chance.
John Garrett does.
if you're gonna work - within S.H.I.E.L.D. for Hydra, you can't ever get attached.
I know that you care about us, Ward!
you're right. I do.
ward! Ward! - Ward!
it's a weakness.
you're still mike peterson. You have a son.
so, is someone seeing everything you see?
waiting to push a button and blow a hole in your skull if you disobey?
Garrett doesn't just want GH-325 for his centipede soldiers.
he wants it for himself.
what are you feeling?
the universe.
Skye left them a little surprise.
a trojan horse.
it's been slowly mapping every system they've uploaded it to.
if there's a computer system in that barber shop, we don't have to chase him anymore.
sorry about the security red tape -- you know, intellectual property, blah, blah, blah.
you'll get used to it.
so, basically, I've been here since day one.
it started with me on my computer in a basement, and now look what we've grown into.
we've got 20 active systems, and we're growing fast.
I was gonna ask about the construction next door.
Ah, yeah, we're planning to add another 100 systems By the end of the month.
that's Sally. Hey, Sally.
so, what -- are you just really into this sort of thing, or what brings you to the company?
um...the incentives program?
Yeah. No one's turned that down yet.
anyway, so, every operator is in charge of one unit.
you will receive an e-mail 24 hours before it goes online.
now, some are volunteers, but some are here for the same reason that you're here.
Hey, zeller. We're in position.
okay.
this is good for you to learn on your first day.
what's going on?
these guys?
we don't like these guys.
Yes, sir, we have them in sight.
copy that.
okay, people...
...Let 'em have it.
could sure use a little light in here.
I got this.
so, who do we talk to about getting a haircut?
if it isn't the cavalry.
don't ever call me that.
bring the house down.
time to go!
let's go. Let's go.
our men are still digging themselves out, but it looks like coulson and the others got away.
do you want to -- Doesn't matter.
you all right?
what does it look like?
never better, son.
I need a nail.
get me a nail -- a big one!
what the hell is he doing?
he's flexing his new muscles.
he has every ounce of our research coursing through his veins.
he feels good.
because he took all of our miracle drug.
when we land at Cybertek, military brass and investors are expecting a demonstration,
and I promised them - indestructible super soldiers, not disposable ones.
well, with Hydra in the mix, we won't lack for volunteers.
and if we run out, our incentives program should help fill the ranks.
just getting some ideas down.
I can't keep everything in my head.
got to be honest with you, John -- looks like you're kind of losing it.
I'm alive for the first time, thanks to you.
we took some hits along the way, but we did it.
we did it.
can't believe it.
this is everything - we've been working towards -- saving you.
our alliance with hydra was always a means to that end, right?
symbiotic.
and here we are.
I mean, it's not like we're true believers, right?
don't get me wrong. I'll go where you go.
having our soldiers in key positions is great, but...
then what?
are we really planning a coup?
it's more of an uprising.
it's become bigger than hydra.
ward, you've taken good care of me, gave me everything I wanted.
it's time for you to decide what it is you want.
I'll see that you get it, too, son.
I can do anything now.
the trojan horse worked.
it gave us access to the system we wanted.
our secret weapon -- we now have eyes on their operation right in the palm of my head.
we'll need more than eyes to defeat Garrett.
what is it?
Fitz-Simmons' tracker crossed the ocean.
it's in new mexico.
they managed to tag the plane?
it appears so, but they're not answering.
no. - We can't think about that right now.
they may have been captured.
either way, they risked everything to put a tracker on that plane for us.
now we know exactly where Garrett is, and Skye can see what he's doing.
if Fitz and Simmons are still alive, then catching Garrett is our only shot at finding them.
you looked very peaceful sleeping.
didn't want to wake you, but I'm glad that you're up.
what's happening?
I've spent the last hour trying to figure out why we sank.
we're at the bottom of the ocean, in case you missed that bit.
these pods are built to be compatible with all S. H.I.E.L.D. aircraft, submarines, spacecraft.
on impact, - the atmospheric adaptation must have tried to compensate.
we slowly sank as it increased the density of the outer walls.
I measured the rate the water rose on the glass.
did the math -- we're at least 90 feet down.
you can't see the surface.
how did we survive the fall?
the plane must have been in vertical flight mode, flying low.
I managed to strap us to one of the backboards before we hit.
and I broke my arm -- same two places I broke it in second grade...
which is strange.
I thought we were dead for sure, Fitz.
we're so lucky.
now we just need - to figure a way out of here.
we'll find a way out of here, right?
and then we'd be in the middle of the ocean with the bends and no floatation and no one looking for us.
I already spent an hour trying to rig the wireless signals on the EKG to send out a weak distress call before remembering that it's a S.H.I.L.D. frequency and no one's listening.
and that's not the problem.
the problem is that there aren't many supplies left in here, - so I've already done the math -- Enough with the math.
what are you saying?
there is no way out.
we're going to die down here.
we only get one shot at this, so let's go over the plan one more time to make sure we're clear on exactly what we're doing, okay?
trip and I will crest the ridge, use a noisemaker to grab a three-wheel, maybe something with more fireworks, and open a window for you two.
you crawl in, grab the dealer, force his hand.
he'll get us our ace in the hole, and then bob's your uncle.
Roger that.
makes it sound easy.
coulson, it's a solid plan you've mapped out, but it hinges on a gamble, a big one.
and backup isn't coming.
it'll be just the four of us.
we'll be outmanned and outgunned.
but fury always said...a man can accomplish anything when he realizes he's a part of something bigger.
a team of people who share that conviction can change the world.
so, what do you say?
you ready to change the world?
no. I'm ready to kick some ass.
that works, too.
I'm saying, just talk to him.
he says everything's fine, but he's not acting that way.
I don't know what's going on with him, and I don't like it.
captivating, isn't it?
first time I saw it, it reminded me of a lava lamp.
of course, that was before I could see through it.
Quinn's expecting the gravitonium as payment.
when he's done, I think it would be wise to let him have it.
don't be coy.
I know you have plans for the stuff.
I understand it now.
I can see its soul.
I can see yours, too.
ward's concerned you're going mad.
the drug didn't just strengthen my body -- it gave me clarity of mind.
it gave me a vision of the world that's waiting beneath the surface of this world.
you don't think that's mad, do you?
you know exactly what I'm talking about. You always have.
I have no allegiance to Hydra, Centipede,Ccybertek...You.
I was only ever interested in -- Evolution.
you know - we're prehistoric creatures oozing out of the swamps, through the mist, clawing our way onto land so we can finally stand or plant roots...
or fly. -- Exactly.
I was saddened to learn you weren't Clairvoyant.
I had a question I didn't get to ask, but now...
now the truth is written on the back of my eyes, so...
go ahead, flowers.
ask.
what will I become?
are you scared? -- Yeah.
and I'm hungry, too.
me too -- scared and hungry.
what do you think it's like?
death?
well, depends on the method, really.
drowning's supposed to be quite pleasant in the end, apparently.
once the water fills up your lungs -- I mean after.
Ah, yeah. Well, my mum always said that you shouldn't be afraid.
because it's just like the way life was before you were born...
which wasn't that bad, was it?
that's sweet...
though, apparently, I was miserable before I was born.
upside down, umbilical cord all wrapped around my head.
Yeah, well, she meant pre-conception, of cour...
I know. -- I'm joking.
Yeah, I know that you're joking. That's fine.
I like to think about the first law of thermodynamics, that no energy in the universe is createc...
none is destroyed. - ...None is destroyed.
that means that every bit of energy inside us,
every particle will go on to be a part of something else.
maybe live as a dragonfish, a microbe, maybe burn in a supernova 10 billion years from now.
and every part of us now was once a part of some other thing.
a moon, a storm cloud, a mammoth.
a monkey.
a monkey.
thousands and thousands of other beautiful things.
that were just as terrified to die as we are.
we gave them new life -- a good one, I hope.
it's fitting we're down here together, Fitz.
this is where all life began on our planet, anyway...
just outside that gla...
the glass.
Fitz, the glass. - Yeah.
it's bulletproof, pressure-resistant.
but the seal is 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, surely.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but the flash point is too high for it to burn.
but medical ethanol has a low flash point, burns...
hotter. If we could use the defibrillator as an ignition source...
and build a compressed explosive...
to ignite the seal, the outside pressure will...
blow the window in! - ...Blow the window in!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
this really hurts my arm.
okay. Well, now we know that, there's a whole new set of problems, but where do we start?
and finally, welcome to our cybernetics subsection, where we design,manufature, and, with this, install our most advanced system.
ladies and gentlemen, this prototype can replace the severed limb of a soldier in minutes with one 10times stronger, fully networked to the soldier's biometrics and to his optical targeting system.
if you want me to open up Uncle Sam's checkbook, I'm gonna need specifics.
specifics.
specifically, I'd like to build dozens of these machines, increase the scale of our surgery wing, crank out 100 soldiers a day.
to join our special ops units.
no, to replace them -- navy seals, secret service.
now, gentlemen, we know the world's a dangerous place now.
what we're offering you is...
security.
all right, what do we want?
there's a three-wheel over there.
here comes a humvee that has better fireworks.
hold on.
now, that's what I'm talking about.
you bring a noisemaker?
sir, I bring the noise and the funk wherever I go.
Hey-ho, friends!
the enemy approaches.
careful, now, or they'll win the day.
you know where to put this next one.
nice work, guys.
the window's open.
relax. Practice drills.
the compound's secure.
you have nothing to worry about.
tell us what the hell is going on out there, or you can kiss a government contract goodbye.
G-gentlemen, gentlemen, please, I beg you -- Don't beg them, Quinn.
you're not a rottweiler.
we don't need their scraps.
who the hell is this?
this is our strategy consultant, John Garrett.
I want full disclosure right now, or our boys will come in and shut you down.
why do I hear gunfire?
you hear the dying breath of an old world, general, and a new world is coming.
I've tasted it on my tongue.
this is your strategy consultant?
He's...part time.
new strategy -- you shut your mouth and give us everything we want.
you threaten a United States general, and there are consequences.
Oh, you feel powerful now, don't you?
but you're all just slaves who will serve our future.
listen, you crazy son of a bitch -- Gentlemen, perhaps a small demonstration will...
Yes. Oh, yes. A demonstration.
I've seen the future.
I've glimpsed it through the eyes of every creature -- dead, living , or yet to be.
this is the beginning.
the beginning of what, John?
the end.
you're not going anywhere.
you think you can steal the gravitonium?
it was given to us.
what the hell did you say to Garrett?
I listened.
he's psychotic. Did you notice that?
I just had to lock up six government officials because he butchered the seventh one.
he completely lost it in there.
you're wrong. Garrett's not lost.
far from it -- he's connected now.
don't tell me you're following him into this madness.
his talk of evolution...
I agree with him. You're the one who follows him.
but in this case, you should.
for the first time, you both need the same thing, and so do I.
what are you talking about?
I need him to get his head on straight.
Skye -- we need Skye, and that's all you ever wanted, isn't it?
the evolution he speaks of -- she'll be an important part of that, so go get her, Grant Ward.
get her for what?
the world is going to change, and when it does, she could be yours.
you really are crazy.
Skye detests me.
she thinks I'm a monster.
are you?
is that your true nature, or is that what Garrett made you to be?
I don't know.
well, we know about Skye's parents, about the darkness that lies inside her.
I believe in a world where her true nature will reveal itself.
and when that day comes...
maybe you two could be monsters together.
here come the centipede soldiers.
these windows can't take many more hits like that, sir.
let's hope they don't have to.
coulson, we've found the dealer.
this is a bomb.
you know what those do.
and you've seen Agent May here through the eyes of your super soldiers, so you know what she does.
you don't want to mess with us, is my point.
you're not gonna be able to hijack our soldiers.
we've thought through every emergency scenario, including this one.
don't tell me you just switched the soldiers to default directive.
Yeah, I did.
and how did you know about that?
time for the guns? -- Time for the guns.
stay.
stay.
good boy.
they're off to defend Garrett.
and lead me right to him.
trip, if the rest of us don't make it, I still want this place to burn.
I prefer you make it, sir.
me too.
the compound's been hit.
Raina and Quinn took off. We need to take action now.
what are my orders?
that's up to you, son.
wake up! Come back to reality, John.
what do you need me to do?
you've already done it.
it's your handler, probably to tell me what the soldiers are seeing.
Yeah.
Hi, John. Just calling to catch up.
Skye. You sound different on the phone...
Huskier.
you curious why I'm calling from your soldier control center?
no, I'm not too concerned.
you see, if anyone but the assigned handler gives a directive to one of my men, well, kaboom.
Ah, darn it. Coulson didn't think of that.
you outsmarted us again.
Phil's around?
great.
we actually have a lot to talk about.
Oh, and I wanted you to know -- your scientist friends...
...they were brave until their last breath.
Raina told me how special Skye is.
I know you've seen that from the start.
you want orders?
get her.
thank you.
he's always been a tender heart.
you don't need to be set to default.
you haven't left me alone all day.
I was told to never leave your side, sir.
I love you, too.
all right, we need to hurry.
we have to do this soon.
there has to be enough ox-- Oxygen to ignite, yes.
Yeah. Okay.
now, when I press that power button...
the window will blow in, and water will rush inwards.
Yeah, which is gonna be like 100 punches to the stomach, okay?
the wind's gonna be knocked right out of us.
now, this is near empty, but I've rigged it to let out a burst of very high pressure.
should force a breath into your lungs, but you have to hold on to it, okay?
hold on tight.
should be enough to get you up the 90 feet or so.
one breath? But there's two of us.
Yeah, I've done the math.
that's why you're taking it. You're a better swimmer, anyway.
no. -- Jemma.
no. I'm not leaving you here.
that's ridiculous. We need a new plan.
we're not discussing it, okay?
you're taking it -- end of story.
I couldn't live if you didn't.
well, I feel the same way.
there has to be another way.
you're taking it. --Why? Why would you make me do this?
you're my best friend in the world!
Yeah, and you're more than that, Jemma.
I couldn't find the courage to tell you.
so, please...
...Let me show you.
it's okay.
no. No.
Jemma. Jemma. Jemma. Jemma, we have to hurry.
no. No.
take it, Jemma.
no. No.
No!
help!
you're in decompression on a jet back to the mainland.
they told us you were dead.
good. We want word to get around on that.
Fitz.
uh, easy. Easy.
his heart's still beating -- just barely.
I have a full med team with him.
but you have to remain in this chamber, okay?
his brain was without oxygen for a long time, but you saved him.
it was the other way around.
how did you find us?
that makeshift beacon of yours -- good thinking.
led us right to you.
lucky we were looking.
you were looking?
for my man Coulson.
I understand you're involved in a dispute I might want to weigh in on.
do you have anything that might lead me to him?
looks like the back entrance to the factory floor Is on the south side.
Roger that.
I have to hit "snooze" on this every minute to keep that from blowing.
look, I will die before talking, but there's nothing to tell.
there's no way of controlling the soldiers Unless there's an actual handler at the machine.
I'm not interested in that.
I'm more interested in why you're willing to die for Hydra.
are you a true believer?
is Hydra the plucky little family you never had?
or are you here because of the incentives program?
she's not gonna kill you.
she had a chance to kill me before and couldn't do it.
and she hates me... a lot. -- I feel sorry for you.
betraying the only people who gave you a chance at being a decent human being.
Fitz was a hero because he still wanted to give you that chance after everything.
but some people are just born evil, I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe they are.
I've learned things about you, Skye -- history.
things you'll want to know.
you and I aren't that different.
you're not the evil I was referring to.
Garrett is evil.
you're just weak, doing anything you're told.
I hope Garrett orders you to walk into traffic.
you're right, Skye.
you woke up a weakness inside me.
and for the first time in a while, I wanted something for myself.
maybe I'll just take what I want -- Wake up something inside of you.
I'm not afraid of you, Ward.
you're not gonna kill us with the bomb.
you'd go, too.
no. I have a weapon much better than a bomb that will absolutely destroy you.
and why's that?
because you slept with her, and she's really pissed off.
let's talk about incentives.
you said our thing was no strings attached.
looks to me like the ice queen got her feelings hurt.
Hey-ho, friends! The enemy approaches.
check the perimeter.
careful, now, or they'll win the day.
Hi, John.
Hi, phil.
well, that's new.
sir?
you don't have to call me "sir," Coulson.
look at me.
I'm dressed like I live under a bridge.
what are you doing here?
well, Simmons turned me on to that old-timey tracker Fitz left on your bus.
I went to great pains to make sure you didn't die the first time.
well, now's probably not the best time, but...I'd like to have a lengthy conversation with you about that.
it might get loud.
and I owe you that.
but right now, we owe Garrett a punch in the teeth, wouldn't you say?
This...Packs a pretty good punch.
I know what it does.
reminds me of the old days.
you were never on top.
we are running out of time.
tell the man what they have on you.
fury.
well, hell...
when was the last time anyone saw a tag-team wrestling match with four dead guys?
I only see one dead guy in here.
Oh, the power's all on this side of the room, fellas.
Phil, I'm surprised you'd try and stop me.
of course, I don't blame you, Nick.
you haven't seen the big picture, the big bang, the timeless frozen ocean, but Phil here has.
we share a bond.
we're blood brothers.
you didn't tell me he'd gone this crazy.
he's really stepped it up a notch.
wait, May!
I think I've waited long enough for this.
Kyle?
Oh, baby.
I'm so sorry what they did to you.
what are you looking for?
our Ace in the hole.
you remember that speech you used to give us, Nick.
about how one man can accomplish anything once he realizes he can be something bigger?
well, now I am.
a part -- a part of something bigger.
is that how it went?
not a great listener.
if you tell me this whole Hydra path thing you took is because you misheard my damn "one man" speech...
I am the key to the future of the universe.
I'm the origin of all things. --You got it, right?
totally.
loud and clear.
no, come on, please, I...
Aww, man.
here.
okay, Ace, I need you to give me a message, okay?
something your father would know could only come from you.
I need to prove I have you.
it won't matter.
I've already told you -- There's no way to communicate with deathlok from in here.
I don't need to.
I've been communicating with him the whole time.
fury was teaching us something you didn't want to hear, John, 'cause you only think about yourself.
that's the difference between your side and our side and why we're always gonna win.
what lesson, Phil?
please, enlighten me.
you can't do this, Mike.
I order you to stand down!
you must obey me!
you need me to translate the words of creation.
you don't want to do this, Mike.
tell him, Phil!
Mr. Peterson's free to do whatever he wants.
you think he learned his lesson?
he learned something.
without regular injections, they're just men.
once doctors remove their cybernetic eyes, they'll be essentially back to normal.
minus an eye, of course.
you got a chance to express all your feelings?
is he still breathing?
guess she kept some of it to herself.
he's having trouble speaking.
I think I fractured his larynx.
Oh, good.
your attempt to cross off Fitz and Simmons failed, But Fitz may never be the same again.
so I'm going to invent new ways to ruin the rest of your life.
and we'll do whatever's necessary to get Hydra intel from you, but your torture...that's gonna be internal.
and a little bit external.
sure. Some of that.
but you devoted your entire life to a deranged narcissist who never gave a damn about anyone, and now he's dead.
you've got the rest of your life to wrestle with the question who are you without him?
why don't you go to him?
I don't want him to see what I've become.
he won't care about your burns.
that's not what I mean.
Coulson said to bring you in.
you can access my hardware and watch my every move.
go ahead. I'll only be making amends for my actions.
whatever you did, you did it for Ace.
and what I do now?
that'll be for him, too.
there's a reason why they say,"cut off the head." Now I'll be un stop...
Hey, guys!
I found it.
told you it'd be in here.
stupid, stupid, stupid, and cruel, and very stupid!
I think you've made your point.
why bring me back in the first place?
clearly, I didn't think it was the best idea.
I warned you about people losing their minds.
agent May was on top of the situation.
she says you're fine.
aren't you?
it was a "break glass in case of emergency" situation.
Yes, but that emergency was supposed to be the fall of an avenger.
exactly.
and I'm damn glad I did it, too.
when you want to build something, you need a strong foundation.
now, you know how few people I trust, Coulson.
you can count them on one hand.
and I'm not afraid to cut off fingers.
the principle S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded upon was pure.
protection.
protection -- one word.
sometimes, to protect one man against himself. Other times, to protect the plant against an alien invasion from other universe.
it's a broad job description.
no need to tell me.
but the belief that drives us all is the same, whether it's one man or all mankind.
that they're worth saving.
that truth lives inside you, Coulson.
before it was torn apart, S.H.I.E.L.D. was a lot of moving parts.
guys like you were the heart.
Now...You'll be the head.
what is it?
a toolbox to help you build it back up.
you want me to start over, rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D.
from scratch.
take your time and do it right.
you'll still have his back.
of course.
there's no one else I trust with this.
thank you, sir.
how do you -- how should I proceed?
that's up to you...
director.
and you, sir -- where are you heading now?
well, I'm trading in my bird's-eye view for two solid feet on the ground.
this is the last time you'll be seeing me for a stretch.
you're gonna disappear, nowhere to be found.
nowhere?
you know me better than that, Phil.
I'll be everywhere.
Fitz -- is he okay?
please tell me he's okay.
he's alive.
what is this place?
first thing I found in that box was these coordinates.
another secret base?
I call it the playground, although, technically, it doesn't have a name because, technically, it doesn't exist, it being a secret base and all.
Eric?
Billy...Koenig, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
although I totally understand the confusion.
Eric passed away, sadly, but it's great to have company.
finally, and I did not mind minding this place.
agent Coulson.
I know. I know. And it is an honor to meet you, sir.
I'll get your lanyard shortly.
for the rest of you, lanyards will be handed out on a case-by-case basis.
can't be too careful with all those hydra threats still out there, causing trouble.
that's why we're here -- get you up and running and back fighting the good fight, which is gonna be cool.
I know we don't have much, but what we have is yours, sir.
thank you.
So...here would you like to start?
I know you thought you'd never see me again, but...I found your daughter.
Hey,Idaho.
Idaho,can you hear me?
come on! Damn it! Come on!
Creel's on foot.
but he won't be for long.
Hartley and Idaho? - Dead.
that's no use.It's jammed.
we have to get you out of here!
my leg is pinned.Don't worry about me.There's no time.
soldiers are coming.
creel has the damn thing that burned Harley!
you need to get him! Go!
good luck.
hands on your head!
on your knees!
what the hell was Hunter thinking?
he was trying to save Hartley!
and you're absolutely sure?
they're gone.
it was bad,Coulson.
two agents down,another captured.
this shouldn't have happened.
we got a hit.
911 just picked up a stolen-vehicle call up the road from you.
older model red-and-white pickup.
that's got to be Creel.
May,you're approaching a civilian area without backup.
if you see him,do not engage.You copy?
do you copy?
May,that doesn't sound covert.
I've got him.Closing in.
No,drop back.
do not engage.I repeat --do not engage.
he's not looking.
I have a shot.- Negative!
we can't just let him go,Coulson.
creel isn't working alone,and I want to know who he answers to.
drop back into surveillance mode now.
that's an order,agent may!
Yes,sir.
I still can't raise Hunter or Hartley on the comms.
not surprised.
radio silence on the op is protocol.
Still,Hartley was in pretty bad shape when we left.
or you'd think we'd have heard something by now.
no need to think the worst till it shakes your hand and says hello.
is that another one of your grandma's sayings?
fortune cookie.
I had some Kung Pao Chicken the other night.
maybe Coulson's heard from them.
I need to get a complete inventory By the time agent Koenig returns
Food,fuel,and ammo --understood?
you got the Quin jet.Well done.
thank you,sir.- Thank you,sir.
any word about Hartley?
not now.
let Mack know the jet's here.
I want him reverse-engineering that cloaking hardware right away.
sooner he does,sooner we get the bus operational again.
Roger that.
something else?
the item that messed up Hartley's arm,It had those weird symbols on it,The ones you've had me researching.
the same symbols?
you sure? - Yes.
they came up out of the object.
it reminded me of braille.It was like Hartley triggered something by touching it.
what the hell is that thing?
I have no idea.
but good work.
"good work"?
how about,"holy crap,Skye.We got to get on that"?
after a month of combing the planet for these things,we finally got a clue
right now,we have more important problems
a five-alarm fire otherwise known as Lance Hunter.
is he,captured.
but if he talks,our entire operation's compromised.
we'll have to burn the base and evacuate.
I know.
and we just re-tiled the bathrooms.
Oh,just as I was dropping off to sleep.
thank you very much.
excuse me,gents.Can I get a glass of ...Water?
Mr.Hunter,I don't believe we've had the pleasure!
brigadier general Glenn Talbot.
looks like you need a lift,soldier.
So,this is cloaking hardware.
let's take a peek under the hood.
Fitz would be crushed if he saw this.
he's been working on cloaking since before Simmons took off.
still can't believe she abandoned him like that.
she abandoned all of us.
but Fitz has been clinging to his work like a lifeline,and
maybe we shouldn't tell him.
Coulson wants a retro version of this for the bus.
he said that no one knows the avionics on this thing like Fitz.
think he can handle it?
I don't know you don't?
Hey,Fitz.
Hey,what's up,man?
how are you?
so that's the,um...
that's the...- Cloaking,in all its glory.
you know,you weren't that far off.
check out the transmitter coil.
Yeah,to negate the --the resonant
the...the
the resonant...?
No,um...The,uh...
I-it's okay.Just take your time.
Uh,what he's trying to say is there's an audio component to cloaking that inverts sound waves,too.
like noise-canceling headphones?
Yeah,same concept.- Okay.
you think you can give me a hand with this?
Um,u-under the circumstances,uh...
well,the trick is you would...
n...
the trick --the trick would be in the meta-materials.
Yeah,but you'd have to alter the,um...
Fitz,it
Yeah,could everyone just stop talking for one second?
No,sorry.Gonna have to go.
it's like sometimes he's the same old Fitz,and other times...not.
I'll take your word for it.
Meantime,I'm still gonna need an extra pair of hands.
is everyone back from the mission?
not everyone.
sierra Leone,three years ago.Ring a bell?
how about Basra,'08?
operation Panther's Claw? Come on,Lieutenant.
tell me the stories are true.
I'm not a lieutenant anymore,sir.
why is that,son?
your record?
five commendations for distinguished service,Merits for basket weaving,pottery.Don't forget those.
I'm just trying to figure out how a guy like you,
one of the SAS's finest,winds up running with a bunch of mouth-breathing mercs.
why does any man do anything,general?
I met a girl.
Look,Hunter,I think we're pretty like-minded guys,so let's don't waste each other's time.
you know what I'm after.
guessing it's not Carl Creel.
Creel's small-time.
think big fish.- Coulson.
Coulson.
he's a vigilante...
a zealot who'll risk anything to further his own agenda.
but lucky for you,I've got a senator with very deep pocket that wants him.
so you go ahead.
name your price.
you must be joking.
I don't have a sense of humor.
and if I don't give you Coulson,what?
I go for a swim?
you should know I've been helped out of a chopper before,sir.
Coulson broke into a secure government facility,He
he let a psychopath on the loose,sacrificed the lives of his own men - your friends.For what?
Hunter,I'm not here to play bad cop.
I shouldn't have to.
I want $2 million.
done.- And a proper burial.
excuse me?
for Hartley.
she's an S.H.I.E.L.D.Agent.
she'll be branded a terrorist after what you said on TV,
probably dumped in a pauper's grave,her family wondering what happened to her.
they deserve better.
she deserves better.
I'll make sure she gets it.
keep an eye out for this.
I just wanted to report that Mack and Trip are working on cloaking,so...I'm free if you want me back in the field.
that won't be necessary.
may's still out there.
what about Hartley and Idaho?
they're not out there,are they?
it was that thing,wasn't it? The object.
it was Creel.
Sir,I need to get back out there and help May take him down.
no.
she's my s.O.
I'm a field agent now,and I can handle myself.
that's not what this is about.
then what is it about?
the object? The symbols?
because I can't help if I don't know what's going on.
if you'd like to help,Go down to the bunks,pack up Hartley's things.
okay.
I know you're the boss and you have to compartmentalize everything,but it's not healthy.
you need to loosen up.
Try...yoga or something.
I tried it,but I'm...really not flexible.
but thanks.
we were so close.
if they'd just given us a little bit more time to calculate the object's...
refractive index,yeah.
that's the problem these days
everyone needs answers immediately.
no one has any patience anymore.
Yeah.
I bet they're relishing the fact that we couldn't crack the cloaking device.
don't be silly,Fitz.
everyone here knows how valuable you are to the team.
Well,they avoid me like the plague.
they do not.They
they just have their own problems right now.
Oh,yeah.
the Creel business.
in fact,perhaps they need our assistance.
if they're looking for a way to neutralize Creel's ability...
no one has our experience with gifted.
of course,we can't just hijack the project from them.
that would shatter their confidence.
Yeah,no.Do not want to do that.
no.
or do we?
Fitz...- Yeah.Yeah,no,no.
Stupid,silly idea.I don't know why I sai
look.
there's a whole packet of research they just left lay about all willy-nilly for anyone to see.
it's Creel's DNA results.
interesting.
shall we see what we can do with these?
yes,we shall,Simmons.
yes,we shall.
you all good,hon? Are you still waiting on a friend?
yeah,I'm still waiting.
all right,then.No hurry.
Here,let me clear that.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
think I got a shock.
static electricity or something.
what's the status on Creel?
he's been in there for over an hour.
either he's waiting for a drop or he's getting drunk off his ass.
something's happening,Coulson!
I'm going in!
Everybody,get back!
I don't know what happened!
all she did was touching the guy!
and then he took off.
Please...Help me!
hang on.
all the woman did was touching his arm.
we know that Creel absorbs the properties of whatever he touches.
he must have absorbed the obelisk and its deadly powers.
but why hurt a waitress?
I don't think it was intentional.
you're saying he's losing control?
he had some control issues when S.H.I.E.L.D.First came across him.
if that's what's happening,anyone near him is at risk.
should have engaged when I had the chance.
then you'd be dead,too.
if this is on anyone...
just because you're director,doesn't mean everything's on you,Phil.
Yes.It does.
go dark.Get back when you can.
now what?
perimeter alert
nice ride.
some rich guy loan it to you?
Yeah,something like that.
shame about the rims,though,eh?
Yeah.Probably cost a grand each.
at least.
this isn't a friendly stop,is it?
Nope.Hands on the car.
how the hell did you lose him?!
why haven't you got every agent out there looking for Creel right now?!
you think you're entitled to answers?
he killed two of my friends.I think that's entitlement enough.
Well,it's not.
you should have aborted the mission.
Hartley should have followed my orders.
Yeah,well,she tried to.
Izzy's only mistake was listening to me.
is that why you came back?
guilt?
a desire for revenge?
or was it because of what Talbot promised you?
all of the above.
so you took the deal.
I have 48 hours to deliver you.
or else you're a dead man.
words to that effect,yeah.
Talbot.
and you didn't give him our location?
don't get me wrong.I thought about it.
he put a four-man detail on me.Took three hours to shake them.
I could have led them right to your door.
so kind of you to reconsider.
and in exchange for me,you get what,exactly?
a proper burial for Isabelle Hartley.
I wanted to make sure her record was cleared,that her family were properly notified.
Really? That's all?
Look,between you and Talbot,I know you'll get to Creel first.
he's the only thing I want.
Well,that and the money you owe me.
you're kidding,isn't it? 'cause sometimes I can't tell.
No,I'm not.
I want my pay,and not just mine,either.
I want Hartley's and Idaho's,too.
Okay.Now you're kidding.
it's for their families.I think they deserve something for their loss.
don't you think?
I'll take care of it.
good.
once we have Creel...
I'll be in the wind.
or three sheets to it.
why are they going the biochemical route?
using an adenovirus factor to counter Creel's ability.
Yeah,well,it's pointless,really,since the injected,um...
injected vector will never bind to his cellular membranes.
Yeah,so
Well,then they'd have to find a way to destabilize...
the molecular structure of Creel's epidermal cells,yeah.
destabilize.
I d-- I didn't solve this today.
who you talking to?
me.- What? No one.
you like talking to yourself.That's cool.
a lot of people do.
you know,I like singing in the shower.
yeah,I know it's not really the same thing,But I wouldn't want anyone to hear it.
what do you want?
all right,for cloaking,were you thinking about putting it under avionics or...?
enough about cloaking.
I'm busy...with...something.
well,it sounds like you're just blowing me off.
you want to be alone? That's cool.
you know,I think I like him.
he's honest.
Blunt,I'd say.
I call them like I see them.
no,he doesn't talk to you like the others.It's quite refreshing,actually.
Yo.Fitz.
your minds go wandering again?
what? - See?
no.
what do you got there?
No--this --this is just,uh...- Go ahead and show him.
what harm would it do?
does it have something to do with stopping Creel?
Yeah.
I think...I think that we are...
I-I...Have...I...
I didn't solve this today.
you think you can?
Izzy's sister,Jane.
her favorite person in the world.
after me,of course.
looks like they liked each other.
Yeah,those two,when they got together,There was a lot of laughs.
and bottles of wine.
Izzy was good when it came to family.
which is why I'm taking this.
it belonged to her mum.
died of breast cancer about five years back.
Jane has it now,too.
that's awful.
Yeah.Life can be a mean drunk that way.
never knows when to stop punching.
how did you guys meet?
through my psychotic ex-wife.
those two were good friends back in the day.
I'm really sorry.
tough to lose people you care about.
secret to that?
don't get attached.
tried that.Didn't work.
for you,either.
you know,you remind me a bit of Izzy.
raw but sharp.You got skills.
type that could earn you some real money in the private sector.
as a mercenary?
yeah,I don't think so.
we prefer the term "private military contractors.
don't knock it.
everyone needs an exit strategy eventually.
not me.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s my life now.
S.H.I.E.L.D.isn't a life.
it's just a job
a mean to an end.
remember that.
you hear anything more about Creel,let me know.
who's this?
good evening,Mr.Creel.We've been trying to reach you.
where the hell were you? I waited at the drop site for an hour.
calm down,Mr.Creel.There's no need to panic.
we're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L.D.is a factor.
forget them.I got a real problem.
that thing really messed me up.
I turned to rubber when I touched it.
thought that it would protect me,but it infected me,too.
we're well aware of your condition.
but believe me when I say That Mr.Whitehall wouldn't have selected you for this job if you weren't capable of completing it.
that mr.Whitehall wouldn't have selected you for this job if you weren't capable of completing it.
you don't know what it's doing to me.I can't keep it off.
once we have the Obelisk ,you will be taken care of the way hydra has always taken care of you.
please proceed to the secondary drop site,
and I shall meet you at the appropriate time.Good night.
Hello?!
What?! What are you looking at?!
leave them alone,Mr.Creel.
we have far more important things to discuss.
I know you from somewhere?
my name is Raina,and I'm a huge admirer of yours...
and your gifts.
beat it,lady.I'm not into groupies.
you misunderstand.
I know you recently acquired something extremely precious and rare
something I'm very interested in.
whatever you're offering...It ain't enough.
maybe not.
but aren't you the least bit curious as to what it might be?
it's called carbyne,an allotrope of carbon found in stardust,
three times harder than diamond...
with an added bonus.It can store energy.
Beautiful,isn't it?
so filled with potential.
am I supposed to be impressed?
I'll settle for interested.
you have no idea who you're dealing with,lady.
you ever hear of hydra? - Name rings a bell.
let me give you a tip -- run.
cause if the guy I'm working for gets ahold of you,
I'd hate to see what he's gonna do to that pretty little face of yours.
looks like you need some help there,Mr.Creel.
I'm not the one who needs help,lady.
you do if you touched the obelisk.
I'll tell you what -- I'm gonna do you a solid and not tell my boss about you!
what about the carbyne? - It's the cost of doing business.
he couldn't have gone far.
local authorities have his description.Roadblocks are up.
Talbot's people are still out there.
why was Creel at the bar? - He was waiting for someone.
we just don't know if that person ever showed.
we need a solve for Creel's powers.And we need it yesterday.
how's the lab coming? - Nothing yet.
you remember that encrypted hydra frequency we shut down?
Well,it's back up.
someone sent a message.
a message for us with a phone number to call.- Yeah,could be Creel.
Creel? A phone number? What,is he lonely?
I doubt it.The guy is jacked.
and he can turn any body part into any material.
Okay.Thank you for that.
call the number.- Okay.
Hello? - Who is this?
agent Coulson,I'm glad you got my message.
Raina,as I live and breathe.
it's been a while since we've spoken.
I'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt.Can we make this quick?
Why? You need time to trace this call,don't you?
I take it,then,you haven't tracked down Mr.Creel or the item he stole.
what do you know about that?
I know hydra's about to get their hands on it.
Well,congratulations.
let me be clear.
Mr.Creel is working for hydra.I am not.
why the breakup? Bad dental plan?
hydra only has one thing on their minds
world domination...Which is so 1945.
what do you want,Raina?
it's what I don't want,
which is the obelisk falling into the hands of people who don't understand it.
I'm thinking you might.
and I'm thinking you're gonna tell me why.
John Garrett understood it.
the moment he was injected with the same drug that saved you,
he had visions.
he started carving those visions on the walls.
Garrett was a madman.- Garrett was enlightened.
he witnessed our fate...what we'd become.
have you?
you're not calling to talk about fate.
you want us to catch Creel.
you read my mind,Agent Coulson.
truth is Mr.Creel stole something from me.
fortunately for the both of us,it has an embedded tracker.
but you'd better hurry.He's growing less stable by the second.
the second that frequency comes through,I want everyone on the move.
if Creel's handing off the item to hydra,we need to see where that leads.
what if Creel melts down again?
the lab hasn't figured out how to shut down his powers yet.
if he's an immediate threat to civilians,Trip's got the backup plan.
what kind of backup plan?
the heavy-duty kind with armor-piercing rounds.
will that work?
get close enough to him,catch him off guard...
Hopefully,we won't have to find out.
where do you want me?
that depends.Can you follow an order?
Absolutely,sir.
because part of me wants you here running back-end.
the other part knows we need boots on the ground,
and I've only got a few good pairs.
I'll be good.Scout's honor.
Please,sir.I owe Hartley one.
we could use him.- Suit up.
it's all about the...the resonant.
I didn't solve this today.
what -- what -- what -- what is this?
What,is this some kind of sonic thing,Like the cloaking device?
No,I didn't,uh...
Look,forget about the cloaking device,all right?
no one's blaming you for that.
right now we just got to focus on taking down Creel.
calm the hell down!
Hey,beat it! You're pissing him off.
okay.- Take it easy.
Look,I didn't solve this today! - Yeah,ow.You said that already!
I didn't solve this today!
Wait.Are you saying you didn't solve this today.
you solved this before? - Yes.
y-you're looking for an old design?
Yes! Yeah.Yeah.
all right.Okay.All right.I'm with you.- Yeah.
I'm with you,turbo.All right.
No.No.No.
Um...Go back one.Go back one.
Yeah.Yeah!
Icers? Great.How did we get stuck with a nonlethal option?
coin flip.- Trip called tails.
just getting word from the lab.
Fitz might have something we can use to neutralize Creel's power.
best news we've had all day.
Raina's tracker just popped.Creel's here.
Trip,are you in position?
Locked,loaded,and looking...Found him.
he's got the package.
looks like Creel is talking to the guy with his back to him.
that's his hydra contact.The deal's going down.Skye?
running facial recognition now.Let's put a name to that face.
let the exchange happen.Skye and Hunter,follow the new player.
May,stay with Creel.Everyone copy?
copy that.- Copy.
copy that,sir.
the package is still in place.
wonder why Creel hasn't made the exchange yet.
can we get a laser mike on him?
Skye,you copy? Skye?
Oh,hell no.
you're not listening.
it's spreading all over.I can barely contain it.
pass me case and I'll help you.
help me,and I won't do to you what I did to the waitress.
calm down,Mr.
take a deep breath and clear your mind.
remember your training.
Remember,compliance will be rewarded.
I'm happy to comply.
Good.Very good.
Whoa! He's got a gun! - Oh,my god!
everybody out! Move!
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,pal.This is really gonna hurt.
"Scout's honor"? You were never a boy scout,were you?
present! Huh!
order! Huh!
breaking into cars now?
following up on a promise.
thanks to you.
general Talbot's not the only one with friends,though I am sorry about that $2 million you wanted.That I can't swing.
Oh,you knew about that,too,eh?
I'm the director of s.H.I.E.L.D.
Well,that's just marvelous.
Talbot wants me dead.And now I have no funds to run with.Any tips?
Yeah.Don't run.Work for me instead.
creel must have hit you in the head.I shot three of your agents.
including Agent May.Not a smart move.
she the type that holds a grudge?
savors it,actually.
no doubt,you've made some mistakes.
so have I,like letting you go after Creel.
but I felt for you.
Yeah,and I took advantage of that.
how do you know I won't do it again?
I don't,but the reality is I don't have a fleet of helicarriers or Quin jets or thousands of agents at my disposal anymore.
we're lucky we still have our George Foreman Grill.
you need warm bodies.Is that it?
I need skilled assets in the field who are willing to step over the line,
to do the wrong thing but for the right reason.
I need you because I can't be you.Not anymore.
Yeah,well,you're better off.Trust me.
Look,it's your choice.But good people...People I respect...vouched for you.
I'd like to find out why.
hell if I know.
but I'm curious.- Good enough.
Oh.I just need you to do one thing.
Oh,yeah? - Sell me out.
the sound waves disrupted the molecular,um...
the molecular -- the,um...
well,you should understand.You modified it.
you know how some guys can play a tune by ear?
Well,I need sheet music.
the original one...
you built this with this agent Simmons I keep hearing about?
Yeah.What about Simmons?
Oh,no,no.I heard that she was cool.
heard that you two were pretty tight.
Yeah.
it's tough to lose a good partner.
how you been holding up since she left?
I'm okay.
I'm glad he's talking to someone.
I've got to admit,I'm having a tough time with it.
it's understandable.
he's changed.
we all have.Even the director.
Coulson has a lot on his plate,rebuilding s.H.I.E.L.D.
I wouldn't know.
he's not exactly the sharing type these days.
he has the world to worry about,Not just us,not just the team.
that's not it,May.
I've been watching him for months,and I know he's keeping something from me,
and it's not just because he's the director of s.H.I.E.L.D.
I think something is wrong with him.
Skye...- No,May,be honest.Is Coulson okay?
of course.
what is wrong with you?
you're director now,not some level 1 field agent.
there are no levels anymore.I got rid of those.
you never should have gone into the field like that.
you're welcome.- It's not funny,Phil.
I know you.And I know when you're overly stressed.
it's been 18 days since your last episode.
17.- 18.
which means you're due or another one.
overdue.
and I'm tired of fighting it.
so don't.That's why I'm here.
you did well.
thank you.I
Now...Pick it up.
you...you want me
I need to know.So do you.
pick it up.
it worked.
No.It let you live.
there's a difference.
show me.Please.
bring me my daughter,and I'll show the both of you.
Glenn.Can I call you "Glenn"?
No.Where's Hunter?
watching "Cake Boss," I believe.
sorry.I changed the terms of your deal.
Well,he kept up his end.You're here.Question is why?
I felt bad for kidnapping you,so I brought you a peace offering.
Carl Creel.
I thought Creel was dead.
he's turned to stone,but he could always do that,
so I'm not sure how long it'll hold.
I've got him in a cryostasis chamber.In the back of the van for 58 more minutes before the juice runs out.
I'd get him someplace secure pretty quick.
maybe a little more secure than last time.Just saying.
very generous of you.
like I told you before,general,we're the good guys.
So,how about we make a deal?
S.H.I.E.L.D.will keep dropping off presents like this,
you keep getting promoted.
all we ask for in return is a little breathing room.Sound good?
you...you must have some big brass ones,Coulson.
coming out here by yourself to meet me...
Face-to-face,no backup.
let's face facts.
you and your little band of misfits are hardly S.H.I.E.L.D.
our Intel says you don't have enough manpower or artillery
to take down a convenience store,so I'm sorry.I'm gonna have to say no to that deal.
I don't know.I think we're good on artillery.
and in case you get any ideas,general...
that's just the tip of the iceberg.
let's get out of here before the iceberg runs out of fuel.

welcome to Mount Waverley 1st tidytown 1972
lamington Drive
australia 1976
Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour of muddy puddles.
her birthmark, the colour of poo.
lt was Saturday afternoon and she was bored.
Mary wished she had a friend to play piggybacks with.
Sonny Cher
Mary's mood ring, which she'd found in a cereal box, was grey which, according to the chart, meant she was either pensive, unconsciously ambitious or hungry.
her only friends were 'The Noblets' from her favourite cartoon.
they weren't the real ones you bought in the shops but fake ones she had to make herself from shells, gumnuts, pompoms and the chicken bones salvaged from Friday night's takeaway.
she had to make all her own toys, and her favourites were Shrinkies.
potato chip packets that she had shrunk in the oven.
Mary's father, Noel Norman Dinkle, worked in a factory, attaching the strings to tea bags.
at show and tell, she told the class he could get as many free tea bags as he wanted.
her favourite tea bag was Earl Grey.
she loved saying 'Earl Grey'
and would like one day to marry someone called Earl Grey.
they would live in a castle in Scotland, have 9 babies, 2 ducks and a dog called Kevin.
Noel's hobby was to sit in his shed and drink Baileys lrish Cream and stuff birds he'd found on the side of the freeway.
Mary wished he'd spend more time with her and less with his dead friends.
she also wished she had some brothers and sisters.
her mother had told her she was 'an accident'.
how could someone be an accident?
Grandpoppy Ralph had told her that babies were deliberate and found by dads at the bottom of their beer.
Grandpoppy Ralph had smelt like pickled onions [Life be in it]
and had been a member of the Frankston lce Breakers for 51 years.
they swam in winter to feel alive.
Grandpoppy Ralph had said it made his nipples erect.
he had died the year before, aged 74, and his best mate, Ken, had recited a poem in his honour.
: born in a barn in the hills of Boronia,
Ralph lived a long life, then died of pneumonia.
Mary missed him and often wondered why he had drunk ammonia.
a lot of things puzzled Mary especially her mother, Vera Lorraine Dinkle.
to Mary, Vera always seemed wobbly.
: a pretty vicious ball. And he's out!
Vera liked listening to the cricket while baking and her main ingredient was always sherry.
she told Mary it was a type of tea for grown-ups that needed constant testing.
Dishlex
Mary thought her mother tested the sherry...way too much.
Mary also couldn't understand why Vera was always 'borrowing'.
yesterday, she borrowed some fish fingers from Aisle 6.
she told Mary she put things up her dress to save on plastic bags.
Vera was indeed a complicated soul.
Mary stopped daydreaming and went and fetched her pet rooster from the rain.
her father had found the rooster on the side of the freeway after it had fallen off the back of a slaughter truck.
she named him Ethel.
lt was time to watch 'The Noblets'. She adored "The Noblets."
because everyone was brown, lived in a teapot and had oodles of friends.
there was nothing nicer, Mary thought to herself, than the smell of a wet rooster,
the sound of rain on the roof and the taste of sweetened condensed milk straight from the can while watching your favourite cartoon.
meanwhile in New York
welcome to New York the Empire State hug 50 cents
meanwhile, a man called Max Horowitz also watched 'The Noblets'.
Max's small television had picture but no sound.
his big television, sound but no picture.
he was 44 and liked 'The Noblets'
as they lived in a delineated and articulated social structure with constant adherent conformity and also because they had oodles of friends.
Max had trouble sleeping and had spent the night watching television and catching fish food.
he noted to himself it was the sixth fly he'd caught this evening.
he wondered if he should go to bed and count sheep or have one more chocolate hotdog.
he thought he'd try both but it didn't work.
lt had been 6 hours and 1 2 minutes since Henry Vlll had passed away.
and Henry's death had thrown Max's life into disarray.
lt had become asymmetrical and the sooner he got a new fish, the better.
tomorrow he would go to the pet store and get another Henry
Henry lX.
1st 1925 post office 3149
mount Waverley: Next.
lt was shopping day and Mary sat patiently while her mother 'borrowed' some envelopes.
to fill in time, she scanned the room and counted how many things were brown.
there was sticky tape, rubber bands and a phone book with a picture of a lady standing in a brown lake with her hand on fire.
people had weird names in America, Mary Daisy Dinkle thought to herself.
Funny-sounding people called Rockefeller and Finkelstein.
she wondered what they looked like, how old they were and if they were married, wore glasses or had found babies in their beer.
maybe in the USA they found babies elsewhere.
: Hmm... They drank a lot of cola.
maybe they found them in cans.
but, no, they wouldn't fit through the hole.
Mary had an idea.
she would write to one of the Americans and ask where babies came from.
she chose a Mr M Horowitz.
: Aarrgh. Mrs Dinkle!
come back here, Vera Dinkle! You come back here!
: dear Mr M Horowitz, my name is Mary Daisy Dinkle and l am 8 years old, 3 months and 9 days.
my favourite colour is brown and my favourite food is sweetened condensed milk followed closely by chocolate.
l have a rooster called Ethel that looks like this.
he doesn't lay eggs but will one day.
my mother likes smoking, cricket and sherry and my father likes playing in his shed with dead birds.
where do babies come from in America?
do they come from cola cans?
ln Australia they are found in beer glasses.
here is a drawing of me.
l can't draw ears proper but l'm good at teeth.
lt would be great if you could write back and be my friend.
yours 'sincerealy', Mary Daisy Dinkle.
ps. l hope you like the chocolate bar l'm also sending.
lt's called a Cherry Ripe.
australian Post
goodbye, letter. Don't forget to write.
: Max hated Thursdays
the day of his weekly Overeaters Anonymous meeting.
and tonight he'd felt especially unsettled because he'd eaten two chocolate hotdogs on his way there.
: OK, class...
chocolate is not a food, group!
God hates fat people
eating chocolate was breaking the rules.
he'd found the night even more unbearable because of Marjorie Butterworth's strange glances.
: class dismissed.
Max had trouble understanding non-verbal signals.
flirting was as foreign to him as jogging.
Max found most people very confusing.
but little did Max realise his night was about to become even more confusing and cryptic.
he read Mary's letter four times and then did what he normally did whenever confronted with something new and stressful.
Max's fragile existence had once again become unsettled.
and after staring out of the window for 1 8 hours he finally made a decision.
: dear Mary Daisy Dinkle, thank you for the letter, which l opened and read at 9.17pm after my Overeaters Anonymous class.
l am trying to lose weight because my psychiatrist, Dr Bernard Hazelhof, says a healthy body equals a healthy mind.
he says my mind is not that healthy.
your drawing is an interesting visual portrayal of yourself.
l have never met anyone from Australia.
firstly, l will answer your question.
unfortunately, in America, babies are not found in cola cans.
l asked my mother when l was four and she said they came from eggs laid by rabbis.
lf you aren't Jewish, they're laid by Catholic nuns.
lf you're an atheist, they're laid by dirty, lonely prostitutes.
so this is where babies come from in America.
l share my home with a fish, some snails, whom l have named after famous scientists...
a parakeet called Mr Biscuit and, finally, a cat called Hal.
Hal' is an abbreviation for halitosis, from which he suffers.
he followed me home after a gang of children shot his eye out with a beebee gun.
do you have a pet kangaroo?
when l was born, my father left my mother and me on a kibbutz.
she shot herself with my uncle's gun when l was six.
do you like chocolate hotdogs?
l invented the recipe for them and can send it to you.
when l was young, l invented an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.
my psychiatrist says l don't need him anymore so he just sits in the corner and reads.
I'm OK, You're OK.
last week l picked up 1 28 cigarette butts.
people are always littering in New York.
l do not understand why people break laws.
butts are bad because they wash out to sea and fish smoke them and become nicotine dependent.
l am just joking because, of course, it is impossible for a cigarette to remain lit underwater.
also, fish do not have pockets to keep cigarette lighters in.
l am 44 years old and have 8 tracksuits the same colour and size.
l weigh 352 lb...
and am as tall as a 6-foot tree.
welcome to the New York Lottery!
l enjoy entering the lottery and have chosen the same numbers for 9 years.
those numbers are 3...: 1.
and 1 2: 8.
are you a winner?
or a loser?
l have had many different jobs during my life.
my first job was collecting subway tokens in the subway.
my second job was at Yiddel's Gourmet Kosher Supplies where l worked at the machine that made pre-packaged noodle kugels.
l was born Jewish and used to believe in God but l've since read many books that have proven God is just a figment of my imagination.
people like to believe in God because it answers complicated questions like where did the universe come from, do worms go to heaven...
and why do old ladies have blue hair?
even though l'm an atheist, l still wear my yarmulke as it keeps my brain warm.
my third job was for a company that printed logos on novelty items.
l worked at the frisbee printing machine.
a frisbee is a circular plastic disc that people throw at each other.
lt is like a boomerang but it does not come back.
my fourth job was when l was called up for jury duty.
l didn't get paid much but got free cookies and coffee.
jurors are outstanding members of the community who haven't murdered anybody.
l made it to the short list for a trial where a man killed all his friends at his own surprise birthday party.
unfortunately, l didn't get selected because they found out l'd been a mental patient at one point.
have you ever been hang gliding?
my fifth job was as a garbage collector.
l got to clean up after litterbugs and didn't have to talk to anybody.
sometimes l used to pretend l was an intergalactical robot.
: this is 911, your call has been placed in a queue.
one time the police took me in for questioning but let me go when they decided l wasn't a threat to anybody except myself.
the sixth job l had was for the United States Army in the stationery supply department.
because l am good with numbers l had to work out how many ballpoint pens the Army needed.
one day they did a security check and asked whether l was a member of any radical groups.
l told them l was a member of the New York Science Fiction Fan Club.
they said this didn't count but dismissed me anyway.
fortunately, l did not remember to tell them l was once a communist.
have you ever been a communist?
have you ever been attacked by a crow or similar large bird?
when l was 9, a crow attacked me on my way to school.
bird injury Ward l had to have three stitches and in spring l now wear a helmet with eyes l have painted on.
people laugh at me when l wear my helmet.
l'm not sure why.
people often confuse me but l try not to let them worry me.
new York is a very busy and noisy place.
l would prefer to live somewhere much quieter like the moon.
l don't like crowds, bright lights, sudden noises or strong smells.
new York has all these especially the smells.
l often wear nose and ear plugs when l go outside.
lt helps keep me calm.
l find humans interesting but l have trouble understanding them.
l think, however, l will understand and trust you.
you appear very happy and l think you would smell like a shrimp as l know Australia has a lot of shrimps.
can you speed-read?
l have taught myself to read two pages at once
one eyeball per page.
l have to go now even though l have not told you about my 7th job, in a condom factory.
write back soon.
your American friend, Max Jerry Horowitz.
ps. Please find enclosed a photo from one of those booths.
pps. Thank you for the Cherry Ripe and l am glad you like chocolate as much as l do.
l have never eaten sweetened condensed milk but l will try some this week.
PPPS. l have never used a condom.
go in good health: Max hoped Mary would write again.
he'd always wanted a friend.
a friend that wasn't invisible, a pet or rubber figurine.
he counted the stars and wondered how many days, hours, minutes it would take his letter to reach Australia.
nine days, six hours and forty-seven minutes later
Vera was not impressed, not impressed at all.
this nutcase would not be her daughter's penfriend, she thought.
there was enough ugliness in the world.
Mary would be home from school in an hour
enough time for another cup of tea and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves and dissolve the memory of Max's letter from her pickled mind.
the next day: Stop! Wait!
Hey. fellas, you got room for one more bag?
sure, Mrs Dinkle. Hop in!
: good one. Kevin!
: come on, Vera. We've got some other bags to pick up!
Mary, is that all the rubbish?
Yep!
: see ya, Toots!
: sweet baby Jesus.
even though Max's letter smelt like fish heads and orange peel,
Mary drank his words like a bowl of alphabet soup and hadn't been this excited since Grandpoppy Ralph had found a coin up her nose.
she wrote back immediately on some butchers' paper she'd stolen from some chops.
: dear Max, l'm so excited you've wroted back.
l don't think my parents like you so from now on send stuff to my neighbour Len Hislop at 26 Lamington Drive, Mt Waverley.
he's old with no legs.
they got chew'd'ed off in World War ll when some Japanese peoples kept him in a cage above piranhas.
piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.
he's scared of outside, which is a disease called homophobia.
he's started giving me 50 cents a week to get his mail.
l'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland and marry a man called Earl Grey.
do you get 'The Noblets' in America?
well, my favourite Noblet is Vanity Noblet.
he wants to be everyone's friend, even the boys!
ln your letter, you said you had no friends.
well, neither do l.
yesterday at school, Bernie Clifford weed on my spam sandwich and called me 'poo face' 'cos of my birthmark.
l wish l could peel it off like a bandaid.
he also laughed 'cos l had no buttons.
Ethel pecked them off and Mum couldn't thread a needle 'cos she'd been testing the sherry so she used pegs instead.
when l got home, l climbed into my secret place till dinner time.
the other kids also laugh at my haircut.
dad has to cut my hair because mum says real hairdressers sell your hair to Chinamen who stuff mattresses.
my teacher, Mrs Pendergast, says l should smile more.
l told my mum and so she drawed a big smile on me.
l don't think Mrs Pendergast likes me anymore.
l better go now. My tears are smudgling my words.
your friend in Australia, Mary Daisy Dinkle.
ps. Have you ever been teased? Can you help me?
PSS. l've never been hang gliding before or been a "communeist"
but would love a frisbee and your recipe for chocolate hotdogs.
PSSS. l'm sending you some Australian chocolate, a pompom l made and a cake called a lamington, which l was meant to eat for lunch.
: have you ever been teased?
: Mary's letter triggered memories
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.
: we've got him cornered now. Hey. Jew-boy, you're gonna pay...
take this, Jew-boy, Jew-boy, Jew-boy.
and as usual, he coped in the only way he knew.
and 36 chocolate hotdogs later, and after only two hours sleep.
Max's meltdown faded away and an idea popped into his brain.
: dear Mary Daisy Dinkle, thank you for your letter, chocolate bar, lamington and pompom.
the chocolate got crushed, so l blended the bits with milk and icecream and now l am drinking it right now.
after much thought, l think l have a solution to your teasing.
tell Bernie Clifford your birthmark is made of chocolate, which means when you get to heaven you will be in charge of all the chocolate.
this of course is a lie - l do not like lies
but in this case l think it will be of benefit.
l wish l could be in charge of all the chocolate but, of course, l cannot because of my atheism.
my neighbour lvy is also an atheist.
she doesn't talk much but makes me very good soup on Sunday nights.
she is partly blind and sometimes l find her hair in my soup. Eeugh!
l do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof says this would be impolite.
here is a list of what l eat on the other nights.
Mondays - Glicks Potato Knish,
Tuesdays - Yiddels Noodle Kugel,
Wednesdays - Captain Salty's Fishstix,
Thursdays - Yentls Cheezy Blintz and Fridays - chicken nuggets.
on Saturday nights l create my own recipes.
last week l invented canned spaghetti hamburgers.
recipes are like mathematical equations.
dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should never weigh more than your refrigerator and to never eat anything bigger than your head.
l once ate a watermelon bigger than my head but not all at once.
do you have any weight loss suggestions?
my Overeaters Anonymous meetings don't seem to be working and just make me tense.
lt would be good if there was a 'Fat Fairy' .
she would be a bit like the Tooth Fairy but would suck out your fat.
lvy says she is only a 'little bit' blind but l think she is very blind.
she should get a cane like other vision-impaired people.
she could make the end pointy and collect rubbish at the same time.
l think l will write a letter to the Mayor and suggest this.
he will be very impressed.
lvy says she doesn't need a cane because she has a good sense of smell.
she says she could find me with her eyes stapled shut.
she says l smell like liquorice and old books.
l think she smells like cough medicine and urine.
l have never told her this as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said this would also be impolite.
people often think l am tactless and rude.
l cannot understand how being honest can be...improper.
maybe this is why l don't have any friends of course except for you.
a real friend has been one of my three goals in life.
the other two are to own every Noblet and a lifetime supply of chocolate.
life goals: friend, noblets, chocolates
dr Bernard Hazelhof says it is good to have goals but not stupid ones like mine.
l have now run out of things to tell you.
please, write soon.
your friend in America, Max Jerry Horowitz.
ps. Do not worry about not smiling.
my mouth hardly ever smiles but it does not mean l am not smiling inside my brain.
pps. Please find enclosed a frisbee, some Chocolate Pop Rocks, which you should eat with cola, and an illustration of a turtle from one of my National Geographics.
PPPS. Did you know that turtles can breathe through their anuses?
dear Max, when l told Bernie Clifford l'll be in charge of all the chocolate in heaven and he wouldn't get any, he cried.
l also hide'd some dog's poo in his bit of the sandpit.
your advice was great and l've got a job delivering pamphlets so l can save to come and see you.
l am sad to hear you are fat.
mum says l am fat too and l'm growing up to be a heifer, which l think is a type of cow.
maybe you should only eat things beginning with the letter of each day.
on Mondays you could only eat milkshakes, marshmallows and...mustard.
for my birthday, my Mum baked a cake and Dad gave me a camera.
l hope you like the photos l sent.
the first one is of Ethel, who ate some tinsel.
the next one is one of myself after l ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks with the cola, like you said.
next is Len.
he's still trying hard not to be afraid of outside and conquer his homophobia.
the next one is of dad in his shed, and then one of the times l covered mum while she was asleep in her stickers that help her stop smoking.
next, when l got my slinky caught in my hair.
then one of the times Sonny digged up his wife, Cher.
and, finally, a photo of my other neighbour Damian Popodopolous.
he's a Greek and smells like lemon dishwashing liquid and his skin is smooth, like the back of a spoon.
mum says he's a wog and has a stutter and can't even say his own surname.
she says you have to hit him on the back of the head to get his words out.
P-P-P-P...Popodopolous.
l wish he was my boyfriend and we can be in love and do sexing like Katherine Ramsay told me behind the bike shed.
she said it's when two people go 'nuddy'
and rub on each other to make babies.
l told her she's a liar and would go to hell and burn like toast 'cos babies really come from beer glasses and eggs laid by rabbits and nuns and 'prosti-tubes'.
she said ladies get knocked up and bake babies in their stomachs for 2 years till they spurt out their 'vag-eye-ners' with blood and tinned spaghetti.
have you got a girlfriend, Max, or some wives?
have you done sexing?
Valentine's Day is soon and l want to give Damian a present so he can love me.
can you explain love and how l can be 'lover'd'?
: once again, Mary's letter had triggered an anxiety attack.
Max knew nothing about love.
lt was as foreign to him as scuba diving and he'd had an appalling history of getting it all wrong.
one Valentine's Day he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift he was sure was appropriate.
felin rectal thermometer
the only companion that had ever warmed Max's bed was his hot water bottle.
romance and love was a mysterious language he'd given up on.
lf only Mary had asked how a toaster works or asked for an explanation of the Chaos theory.
lf only there was a mathematical equation for love.
he kept eating and thinking.
central park new York
but love was not like Max's Rubik's Cube. lt could not be solved.
no matter how he analysed it, the results were negative.
beat it, creep!
he felt love but couldn't articulate it.
lts logic was as foreign to him as... as a salad sandwich.
the stars made more sense.
: 12, have you responded to the call? Over.
the anxiety and stress were too much.
the inscrutability of love finally won, and Max's brain gave in.
obese retarded man cranded out!
he was diagnosed with severe depression and obesity and spent the next 8 months institutionalised and bedridden.
they marinated him in a cocktail of drugs and performed the usual 'therapeutic' procedures.
meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.
maybe Max's typewriter had run out of ink.
maybe America had run out of ink.
maybe his pets had eaten him.
maybe it was her.
was she too demanding, too boring, too...ugly?
filled with anger, confusion and self-loathing,
Mary tried to erase the memory of her friend forever.
eight months later
Max had recovered.
and life was balanced, safe and symmetrical once again.
but Mary still lingered in his mind.
half of him wanted to write to her immediately.
the other half didn't want to end up a mental patient again.
at least there was always Mr Ravioli to be friends with.
he was a much safer option.
he wondered what Mary was doing right now.
but she was far from content and struggled on by herself, saving her money for a rainy day.
life went on as usual for Max and even though he opted for order and stability, misfortune was never far away.
luckily, his manslaughter charges were dismissed because he was labelled mentally deficient and unlikely to have a motive for killing a mime artist unlike most people.
from then on, Max cooled himself differently and things went back to normal until after his 48th birthday, when his numbers finally came up.
: welcome to the New York Lottery and these are tonight's winning numbers
Max was sensible with his sudden wealth and had bought a lifetime supply of chocolate and the complete Noblet collection.
two of his life goals had come true.
but he still had a lot of money so decided to give it to lvy...
who was also very sensible...
caviar dentist dr. philipa holes.
rush weekly colonic irrigation .until her own numbers came up.
lvy willed everything to the local cat shelter, whose owner relocated her kind donation to his bank account, his wife's new breasts, a Ferrari and enough fuel to get to Mexico.
despite achieving all his life's goals,
Max still felt incomplete.
mr Ravioli just wasn't cutting the mustard anymore and seemed more interested in his self-help books.
Mary had given Max a taste of real friendship and there was just no comparison.
she missed him too but no longer saved to see him.
she now saved for a different reason.
awaken the giant within
one day Mr Ravioli got up, left and never came back.
Max sought Dr Hazelhof's advice.
he told Max that true friendship is seen through the heart, not through the eyes, and that it was time he wrote to Mary to reveal his true self, warts and all.
Max understood.
: dear Mary Daisy Dinkle, there is something l have to tell you which will explain why l have not written.
each time l received one of your letters, l had a severe anxiety attack.
this is because recently, while l was in a mental institution, they diagnosed that l have a new thing called Asperger's syndrome, which is a neurobiological, pervasive, developmental disability.
l prefer 'Aspie' for short.
l will now list some of the traits of an Aspie.
no. 1 - l find the world very confusing and chaotic because my mind is very literal and logical.
2 - l have trouble understanding the expressions on people's faces.
when l was younger, l made a book to help me when l was confused.
l still have trouble with some people.
lvy was hard to understand because of her wrinkles and because her eyebrows weren't real.
3 - l have bad handwriting, am hypersensitive...
clumsy and can get very concerned.
4 - l like solving problems. lvy said this is a good thing.
and finally No. 5 - l have trouble expressing my emotions.
dr Bernard Hazelhof says my brain is defective but one day there will be a cure for my disability.
l do not like it when he says this.
l do not feel disabled, defective or l need to be cured.
l like being an Aspie.
lt would be like trying to change the colour of my eyes.
there is one thing l wish l could change, however.
l wish l could cry properly.
l squeeze and squeeze but nothing...comes out.
l cry when l cut onions but this does not count.
anyway, do you like the word 'cumquat'?
lt is a type of fruit.
do you have a favourite-sounding word?
my top 5 are ointment, bumblebee,
vladivostok, banana and testicle.
l have also invented some new words
confuzzled', which is being confused and puzzled at the same time, 'snirt', which is a cross between snow and dirt, and 'smushables' ...
which are squashed groceries you find at the bottom of the bag.
l have sent a letter to the Oxford Dictionary people asking them to include my words but l have not heard back.
lt is now time for me to go to my Overeaters Anonymous meeting.
there is a woman there called Marjorie Buttersworth who confuzzles me.
she kisses me without my permission so tonight l have decided to rub onions under my armpits to repel her.
your friend in America, Max Jerry Horowitz.
ps. Please find enclosed some chocolate-covered ants l found at the deli.
pps. Not much has happened since l last wrote except for my manslaughter charges, lotto win and lvy's death.
Mary was thrilled Max had finally written and suddenly had a fabulous idea.
haemorroid syrup teers for max
Mary and Max's friendship was resuscitated and her tears were the best gift he'd ever received.
lnside Max's head his brain was smiling.
loaded up with bizarre forms of chocolate, their letters flew thick and fast between the continents.
Max learnt to read Mary's letters with caution and at the slightest tingle of tension, he would stop, take his medication and soothe his nerves.
each letter he would iron, laminate and file in a special place, which also soothed his nerves.
he enjoyed answering her questions and solving her puzzles like
do sheep shrink when it rains?
why do old men wear their pants so high?
do gooses get goosebumps and why is bellybutton lint blue?
are there Noblets in heaven?
and if a taxi goes backwards, does the driver owe you money?
ln turn, Mary simply enjoyed hearing about Max's fascinating life
how many people he'd counted littering...
how the latest Henry had died...
and new recipes he'd invented for chicken.
each nourished the other and, as Mary grew taller,
Max grew wider
their friendship becoming stronger than the glue on Mary's Noblets.
although Max found solace in Mary, he still found the rest of the world bewildering.
and he couldn't understand why he was seen as the odd one while everyone else was considered normal.
no spitting
humans were endlessly illogical.
butt
why did they throw out food when there were children starving in lndia?
why did they clear the rainforests when they needed the oxygen?
and why did they create bus timetables when they never ran on time?
national geographic saving the amazon
he agreed with his favourite physicist that there are only two things infinite
the universe and man's stupidity.
and for Mary, even though Max filled her with confidence...
bullseye!
her world was far from perfect.
the grip of love had her by the throat.
at 4.59pm, on the 8th of the 8th, 1988...
Noel Norman Dinkle attached his last string and, after 40 years and 40 million tea bags, he retired.
to celebrate, Noel announced he was retiring from taxidermy and taking up metal detecting instead.
but, sadly, it was not a hobby he had for long.
beneath this mound ln his will, Noel had left Mary some money so she decided to go to university and study disorders of the mind, yearning to learn more about her friend.
Mary was as popular at university as she was at school.
Damian went there too, aching to be a Thespian.
hi there, M-M-Mary.
Hi...hello!
: that was damn f-f-funny!
Hey, Damian, your mum's roses look fab!
Oh, th-th-th-thanks, Mary.
um. M-Mary, can l tell you something?
sure, babe!
um, um, you've got d-d-d-d-dog's poo on your shoe.
: dear Max, l have been such an idiot.
l've wasted all my money on something pointless when l should have been saving to see you.
l know love upsets you so l won't go on about it.
all l want to say is that love is obviously not for me.
l hope you are well and enjoy the chocolate cigarettes l've enclosed.
love Mary.
Oh, you should be ashamed!
come on, baby. Let's go. - Oh, Mum...
l told you never to talk to strangers.
: Noel's sudden death had filled Vera with remorse and guilt and she coped in the only way she knew.
dear Max, our wedding day was everything l have ever dreamt, making up for the terrible year l've had.
although all the guests were Damian's family and friends, l felt very welcome.
Damian is so perfect. He even made my wedding dress.
and for our honeymoon he took me to Mykonos - his favourite island in Greece.
l got to ride a donkey and found the perfect gift for Len.
poor Len, he's still struggling with his agoraphobia.
Damian and l are so similar.
he even has his own penfriend, who lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand.
: Mary...M-M-M-Mary.
: Mary...M-M-M-Mary.
Mary was bursting with self-esteem and her confidence was almost unbearable.
at university, she shone and took it upon herself to cure the world of mental illness.
madness a brief history pretending to be normal
I'm OK
she did her thesis on Asperger's syndrome and used Max as her case study.
her professors were thoroughly impressed and her writing praised far and wide.
soon, publishers queued to print her unique insight and by her 25th birthday, thousands of copies were ready to be shipped.
: dear Max, l am very proud to give you the very first copy of my book about your disability and the hopes that we have to one day cure it.
even more exciting is that l am finally coming to meet and celebrate with you in one week's time.
l'm also going to give you half the royalties.
your loving friend, Mary.
ps. Please find enclosed some chocolate-coated Swiss almonds.
: Max didn't take the news very well
not very well at all.
: dear Mary Daisy Dinkle, l cannot express myself very clearly at this moment and so l will list my emotions in the order they feel most intense
hurt, confuzzledness, betrayal, discomfort, distress and wheeziness.
this last one is not really an emotion but l thought you should know about it anyway.
with her suitcase packed for New York, Mary said goodbye to Damian.
she hadn't been this excited since she'd found a Noblet in the gutter.
but her excitement suddenly dribbled away like a chocolate in the sun.
Mary slowly sank into a puddle of depression, self-loathing and cooking sherry.
the only colour left in her life was her beloved Damian, only an arm's length away but as distant as the moon.
she lost interest in the world and it lost interest in her as a horrible apparition began to haunt.
she started to spend her nights making pompoms and eating two-minute noodles.

each day, with strength and shame,
Mary trudged to the letterbox in hope, only to swivel, shrivel and slink back inside.
barns galore spring catalogue: My dearest Mary, by the time you read this, l will be on a plane to New Zealand to begin a new life.
you probably haven't even noticed l'd packed my bags.
I have fallen in love with my penfriend, Desmond, and I'm going to live on his sheep farm.
lt's been hard to watch you become a remnant of the person I once loved.
your research into m-m-mental illness has been admirable but your i-idealistic pursuit to remedy it has been misguided.
Mary, you have to realise y-you are not a magic beauty cream you can smooth on the world to rid it of its wrinkles.
l love you, Mary, but l love Desmond more.
l hope one day your heart will heal and we can be friends.
yours compassionately, Damian.

l would like to recommend the fine be increased to a minimum of $1 million as a stronger deterrent and would be happy...

dear Mary, please find enclosed my entire Noblet collection as a sign that l forgive you.

: dear Mary, please find enclosed my entire Noblet collection as a sign that l forgive you.
when l received your book, the emotions inside my brain felt like they were in a tumble dryer, smashing into each other.
the hurt felt like when l accidentally stapled my lips together.
the reason l forgive you is because you are not perfect.
you are imperfect, and so am l.
all humans are imperfect, even the man outside my apartment who litters.

dr Bernard Hazelhof said if l was on a desert island then l would have to get used to my own company
just me and the coconuts.
he said l would have to accept myself, my warts and all, and that we don't get to choose our warts.
they are a part of us and we have to live with them.
we can, however, choose our friends and l am glad l have chosen you.
dr Bernard Hazelhof also said that everyone's lives are like a very long sidewalk.
some are well paved. Others, like mine, have cracks, banana skins and cigarette butts.
your sidewalk is like mine but probably not as many cracks.
hopefully, one day our sidewalks will meet and we can share a can of condensed milk.
you are my best friend. You are my only friend.

Hello?
Max, it's us!
we're here!
Oh, Max?
: Max had died peacefully that morning after finishing his final can of condensed milk.
: you are my best friend. You are my only friend.
: he smelt like liquorice and old books, she thought to herself, as tears rolled from her eyes the colour of muddy puddles.
from THE VERY BEGINNING,
we HAVE WONDERED HOW LIFE BEGAN,
what OUR PURPOSE IS AND WHERE WE ARE HEADED.
we HAVE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND TIME,
matter, THE INFINITE UNIVERSE,
who WE ARE AND IF WE ARE ALONE.
great MINDS HAVE IMAGINED THE MOST WONDERFUL
and THE MOST TERRIFYING ANSWERS
to THESE QUESTIONS.
we INVITE YOU TO JOIN US ON THIS GREAT EXPEDITION.
as WE SEEK TO IMPROVE AND REFINE OURSELVES,
to ELEVATE HUMANKIND TO ITS CONSUMMATE FORM,
what WILL BECOME OF THOSE WHO ARE LESS THAN PERFECT?
you CAN'T GO OUT. IT'S THE FIRST HAND.
I FOLD. YOU ARE SO FULL OF IT.

I CALL.
read 'EM AND WEEP-- FOUR KINGS.
AMN. I TOLD YOU.
Ohh! YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LIEN.
shuffle THE CARDS.
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE.

who THE HELL'S GONNA CLEAN THIS GARBAGE UP
and BLOW IT OUTTA HERE?
okay, OKAY. VOLUNTEERS?
all RIGHT, YOU-- YOU, YOU AND YOU.
Yeah, THAT'S RIGHT, THE DULLARD SISTERS.
get OVER THERE. CLEANUP ON AISLE 13.
come ON, MOVE!
seriously, I HAD ONE OF THE VERY FIRST GENO-PETS.
they HADN'T WORKED OUT ALL OF THE BUGS,
so IT SHIFTED SPECIES DEPENDING ON MY MOOD, BUT...
it WAS A REALLY GOOD COMPANION.
I NAMED HER DOLLY,
after THAT SHEEP WITH THE BIG HOOTERS.
I MISS THAT CAT--THAT DOG-- THAT THING.
you KNOW WHAT I MISS?
a HEALTHY BOWEL MOVEMENT
a REAL BIG, ROUND COOKIE, BABY
one THAT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU'VE BEEN EATIN' REAL FOOD.
do YOU REMEMBER REAL FOOD?
not REALLY. ONE, TWO, THREE!
Oh!
so LONG, RIILA.
hmm. MANGO. VERY PIQUANT.
Aah! OOH!
easy.
thank YOU.
I AM...
I AM EXTREMELY WHIPPED.
RIILA NEVER MANIFESTED HERSELF FOR THE K. P. SHIFT.
odious THOUGH IT MAY BE, I WORKED BOTH.
do I MAKE MYSELF PELLUCID?
eight DETESTABLE HOURS.
I MAY HAVE TO KILL THAT WOMAN.
you're TOO LATE.
I WAS PERTURBED SHE DIDN'T WISH TO DO HER GARBAGE SHIFT.
would YOU KINDLY BE QUIET?
now IT SEEMS SHE IS THE GARBAGE SHIFT.
fortuitous I DIDN'T KNOCK OVER THE PLANT.
well, IF YOU HAD, THERE'D HAVE BEEN
two ALL-MEAT PIZZAS FLOATIN' OUT THERE.
as I'VE ALWAYS SAID, BEDZYK, YOU'RE A KINDLY, THOUGHTFUL MAN.
just PASSIN' THE TIME
till IT'S MY TURN TO GO OUT THE GARBAGE PORT.
I AM SAMSWOPE!
no, U LOATHSOME CREATURE, I AM SAMSWOPE!
come ON, BEDZYK, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
at THE VERY LEAST, WE ARE STILL ALIVE.
we'll FIND A LANDFALL.
we WILL...
all IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME.
Ah, COME ON, SAM.
been TO ALL SIX TERRAFORMED SITES IN THE SYSTEM,
some OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE.
it's ALWAYS THE SAME
keep MOVING, SCUM. HIT THE ROAD.
get LOST, AND TAKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK WITH YOU.
if WE HAD ANY SENSE,
we'd FLY THIS GARBAGE SCOW RIGHT INTO THE SUN
and BETTER STILL, CRASH IT RIGHT UP THERE.
Ah, YES
into THE BOSOM OF OUR SUCCORING MOTHER EARTH...
up THERE, DOWN THERE.
wherever.
adieu AND BIDE THEE WELL, DEAR, SWEET RIILA.
what IS SHE, THE THIRD THIS MONTH?
the FOURTH?
sixth.
so WE'RE DOWN TO WHAT, 96?
two-thirds OF OUR ORIGINAL LITTLE PARTY
of DISCARDED FREAKS, DEAD AND GONE.
it's TRAGIC, JUST TRAGIC.
we've BEEN ORBITING TOO LONG. HUH.
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
what AM I GONNA DO?
in SPITE OF YOUR SURLY, ONE MIGHT EVEN VENTURE TACITURN,
nature, MON AMI, YOU REMAIN AN IMPOSING
and, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NAY,
a DE FACTO EXECUTIVE FIGURE ABOARD THIS ENCHANTED SCOW,
the MUTANT HORRORS OF WHICH
hold YOU IN THE VERY HIGHEST ESTEEM.
and I SUSPECT, BENEATH YOUR SNARLS,
you ACTUALLY CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM.
I'm JUST A PASSENGER, PAL
just ANOTHER STEERAGE-CLASS PASSENGER,
and I GOT MY TICKET TO PROVE IT.
I... I WANT TO GO HOME.
Yeah, ME, TOO.
I WANNA GO HOME. I-I WANNA GO HOME.
off YOU GO, THEN.
Ah, BEDZYK, EXIT THE MERE PASSENGER,
replaced BY THE SUBLIME POET-PHILOSOPHER.
Oh, THAT'S WHY EVERYONE LOOKS TO YOU, YOU KNOW.
apathy PREVAILS HERE ON THE GOOD SHIP "GULAG,
A. K.A. "THE RIGGUM EXPRESS."
but YOU'RE THE ONE
who GETS UP AND DOES SOMETHING
if NOT EVERY TIME,
at LEAST WITH SUFFICIENT FREQUENCY
that YOUR NOBILITY RISES LIKE THE ROSE MOUNTAINS OF MARS
above THE APATHY.
everything I DO, YOU COULD DO.
you JEST, SIR. YOU JAPE. YOU JIVE.
I LAUGH AT YOUR JACKANAPERY, SQUIRE.
no, REALLY, YOU COULD RUN THIS PLACE, SAM.
you GOT TWO HES.
do YOU IN FACT KNOW
TOEER AWAY FROM THE PREVIOUS BULL-PUCKY
why WE CALL THE SICKNESS THAT CONDEMNED US
to THIS FLOATING PRISON
what WE AFFECTIONATELY REFER TO AS "THE BLOOD POOP"
do YOU KNOW WHY WE CALL IT "RIGGUM,"
as PREVIOUS GENERATIONS CALLED THEIRS "THE POX"
or "YELLOW FEVER" OR "A. I.D. S."?
I--I'm SORRY, SAM. I GOTTA GET SOME FRESH AIR.
Yes, WELL, WE COULD ALL USE SOME FRESH AIR.
I WANNA GO HOME. I WANNA GO HOME...
Ah, SMILER, MY OLD FRIEND. I WANNA GO HOME. HOME. HOME. I WANNA GO HOME.
do YOU KNOW THE ETYMOLOGICAL BASIS
of THE NOM DE BLOOD POOP "RIGGUM
for OUR COMMUNAL SICKNESS?
well, IT BEGAN
as TRANSMUTATIONAL BLOOD POISONING
wildly STUPID AND INACCURATE TERM,
just AS CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME WAS EPSTEIN-BARR,
or MONO-- LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.
no, NO, NO.
then--then THEY ABBREVIATED IT TO T. B.P.
whence CAME "TEPEE.
but NATIVE AMERICANS DECRIED THAT AS RACIST,
so THEY STARTED CALLING IT "BLOOD MUTATION
or "BLOOD POOP
utterly DISGUSTING REDNECK TERM.
and FINALLY, AFTER A MILLION PEOPLE HAD IT,
they TOOK IT SERIOUSLY,
particularly WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF URUGUAY
grew 11 EXTRA NOSES ON THE BACK OF EACH HAND,
and THEY CALLED THAT-- TA-DA!
the BIRTH OF THE BLUES!
I'm ONLY KIDDING.
they CALLED THE SICKNESS WHAT IT REALLY IS...
random IDIOPATHIC GENOMIC MUTATION
the ACRONYM--R. I.G. M. OR "RIGGUM.
now WASN'T THAT AN INFORMATIVE INTERLUDE?
philistines.
I AM FESTOONED WITH PHILISTINES.
I WAS JUST TELLING SHARON HERE HOW MUCH I MISS WHISPER CHIPS.
Really? YOU REMEMBER, DON'T YA?
opening THE BAG WITHOUT A SOUND,
the FEEL OF THAT FIRST LITTLE CRISP CHIP,
jumped RIGHT OUT OF THE BAG,
and YOU CAUGHT IT ON YOUR TONGUE,
and THEN THE FUNNY LITTLE HISS WHEN YOU BIT DOWN.
of COURSE, I REMEMBER WHEN CHIPS MADE A CRUNCH
and PISSED OFF EVERYONE AROUND YOU. YEAH. BARBARIC.
exactly. EXCUSE ME.
I NEVER TASTED ANY KIND OF CHIP AT ALL.
Oh, DARLIN', THE THINGS YOU'VE MISSED
the POPCORN, THE BEER-BATTERED FLURGE,
sonic POTATOES!
Ooh.
Hi, BEDZYK.
lookin' GOOD, SIS.
now THAT, MY FRIEND, IS AN EYE.
some HELL OF AN EYE, LET ME TELL YOU!
Yeah, THAT IS AN EYE ONLY TO DIE FOR.
you COULD PLOTZ FROM AN EYE LIKE THAT.
Ah, THE TUCHIS IS NOT EASILY DISMISSED EITHER.
what DO YOU MEAN, THE TUCHIS? WHAT ARE YOU, A PERVERT?/
yeah?
BEDZYK, THAT YOU?
no, it's somebody else.
come ON, WILL YOU STOP CRANKIN' ME? IS THAT YOU, BEDZYK?
harmony, THIS IS BEDZYK. WHAT?
we GOT A SHIP COMIN' IN, DEAD-ON TRAJECTORY FROM EARTH.
Yeah, so?
so I CHECKED THE EPHEMERIS AND THE NEW E. T.A. READOUT,
and THERE'S NOTHING SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.
all RIGHT. SO OUR LOVING FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
have SENT US AN UNSCHEDULED LOAD OF TOILET PAPER.
why BOTHER ME WITH IT? I'M A TOURIST HERE MYSELF.
come ON, BEDZYK. THEY'LL DOCK IN EIGHT HOURS.
what THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
well, CALL ME IN EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS
if YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR MY COMPANY.
I'm GONNA TURN ON THE LIGHT.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT TO TURN UP THE LIGHT. DON'T.
don't. YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THAT.
how LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ON THE GULAG, ANNIE? YOU KNOW.
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
time JUST RUNS TOGETHER OUT HERE.
come ON, HOW MANY YEARS HAS IT BEEN?
14. I WAS 16 WHEN THEY CRASHED THE "COVENTRY" ON CALLISTO
and TOOK ME TO THE SETTLEMENT.
you WERE A KID.
how LONG WERE YOU ON THE "COVENTRY"?
I WAS, UH...
22, I THINK,
when I WAS DISCARDED,
so THAT'D BE FIVE OR SIX, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
do YOU EVER WONDER WHY YOU WERE DISCARDED, ANNIE?
Yeah. OHH.
Yeah, I DO, BUT IT'S THAT THING ABOUT MALTHUS.
at LEAST, THAT'S HOW THEY ALWAYS EXPLAINED IT TO ME
too MANY PEOPLE ON EARTH, NO PLACE TO STAND,
the SHEEP LOOK UP.
Yeah, THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY
it's TOO CROWDED. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA GO.
why NOT SEND THE INFECTED ONES?
I DON'T BUY IT.
so WHAT IS IT THEN, HMM? HMM?
you EVER HEAR OF FATHER DAMIEN?
no. WHO IS HE?
he WAS A PRIEST. HE WORKED WITH LEPERS.
see, THEY USED TO SEND PEOPLE WITH LEPROSY TO THIS ISLAND
to DIE, OKAY?
like THEY SHIPPED US UP HERE, TO THE GULAG.
where ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS, HMM?
the REAL REASON THEY SENT US OUT HERE, ANNIE,
is BECAUSE THEY CAN'T STAND TO LOOK AT US.
it's THE UGLINESS THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF 'EM,
not THE INFECTION.
we're JUST LIKE THOSE LEPERS.
you READ TOO MUCH.
listen, LOVE, I'M NO FAN OF OUR NEIGHBORS FROM EARTH,
but I DON'T THINK EVEN THEY COULD BE THAT CRUEL TO...
no.
to EXILE US WITH NO LANDFALL EVER,
just BECAUSE WE REPULSE THEM.
out OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.
and THERE'S A BIG SHIP COMING IN. OH, YES.
maybe IT'S GOOD NEWS.
Oh, GOOD NEWS! YEAH, GOOD NEWS IS COMIN'.
Yeah, NEXT WEEK.
Mmm.
let ME TURN UP THE LIGHTS.
no, DON'T.
Annie, I LIKE TO LOOK AT YOU.
no. IT'S NOT--NO. I...
it's ME, THIS RIDICULOUS ARM.
it's NOT YOU, BEDZYK.
you ARE LOVELY.
Yeah, I'M GORGEOUS.
really.
I LOVE LOOKING AT YOU.
I JUST... I JUST HAVE...
baggage.
please
Annie, ALL OVER THE SYSTEM,
people MAKE LOVE TO EACH OTHER WITH THE LIGHTS ON
because THEY LIKE TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT
I--I'll GIVE YOU $2 IN SMALL CHANGE
if JUST ONCE...
we COULD PRETEND WE'RE NORMAL.
did YOU JUST SAY "NORMAL"?
yes?
it's Harmony Teat.
that SHIP IS DOCKING RIGHT NOW. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
why DON'T YOU TAKE THAT SHIP AND-- SHH.
has IT BEEN EIGHT HOURS ALREADY, HARMONY?
six, SHIP TIME. I DIDN'T FIGURE IT SO GOOD. SORRY, BOSS.
have THEY DECLARED THEMSELVES?
get THAT HAM-FISTED JACKHAMMER YOU CALL AN ARM and your fat ass over to control now!
it's AN EMISSARY YACHT FROM EARTH CENTRAL.
what's GOING ON?
ephemeris TIME 0-0-0,
and HE'S SWEET.
nice. VERY, VERY NICE. NICE. COUPLED AND LOCKED IN.
bam! DID I DO A JOB, OR DID I DO A JOB?
I'm ONE HELL OF A NAVIGATOR.
did THEY HAIL US?
not YET. GUESS WE'RE BEING THROWN OUT OF HERE. YOU THINK?
Yeah, PROBABLY.
all RIGHT, LET'S HAIL THEM.
attention, EARTH VESSEL.
attention, EARTH VESSEL, DO YOU READ ME?
what ARE THEY, DEAF? COULD BE.
attention, EARTH VESSEL.
listen, GUYS, SAVE YOURSELF THE EFFORT, OKAY?
we ARE LEAVING EARTH SPACE.
what IS THIS?
maybe THEY'RE ALL DEAD AND PURPLE AND FULL OF MAGGOTS
in THERE, YOU KNOW?
tongues HANGIN' OUT, GUTS SPILLIN' OUT OF THEIR NOSES,
eyeballs ALL...
one CAN ONLY HOPE.
I DON'T GET IT. THEY'RE HERE.
we KNOW THEY'RE HERE. WHY WON'T THEY TALK TO US?
they've UNDOGGED THEIR DEBARKATION PORT
and CYCLED OURS. THEY'RE BOARDING US.
home. HOME. W-W-WE'RE GOING HOME.
all RIGHT, OPEN IT.
hello. I WAS SENT FROM EARTH CENTRAL
to MAKE YOU A REALLY TERRIFIC OFFER.
my NAME'S CURRAN, AND YOU MUST BE THE CAPTAIN.
I WANNA GO HOME! HOME! WHAT YEAR IS IT ON EARTH?
quiet!
all RIGHT, LISTEN UP!
now YOU ALL WANTED TO GO TO THE TERRAFORMS.
have WE BEEN TO THE TERRAFORMS? YES!
you WANTED TO GO TO EUROPA. HAVE WE BEEN TO EUROPA? YES!
have WE BEEN TO MERCURY? YES!
have WE BEEN TO VENUS, CALLISTO, GANYMEDE...
Yes! YES!
twice-- TWICE WE WENT TO GANYMEDE.
all RIGHT, THEN BACK OFF!
back OFF. LET ME TALK TO THIS GUY.
I'll TELL YOU EVERYTHING IN FIVE MINUTES.
Oh, YES, MY CAPTAIN.
come ON. WE CAN TALK IN THE CATHEDRAL.
the CATHEDRAL. DROP TO YOUR KNEES AND PRAY.
reminds ME OF THE RAIN FORESTS MY GRANDPARENTS SPOKE OF.
plants ARE LIFE-- THE VERY AIR WE BREATHE.
that's 'CAUSE YOU BASTARDS NEVER SENT US NEW SCRUBBERS,
and THE ORIGINAL CRAP THEY PUT ON THIS GARBAGE SCOW
broke DOWN YEARS AGO. HARMONY, MAKE SURE WE'RE LEFT ALONE, HUH?
all RIGHT, SPEAK YOUR PIECE...
shove OFF.
stop SUCKIN' UP OUR AIR.
I've BEEN INVESTED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT MISSION
people OF YOUR HOME PLANET HAVE EVER MOUNTED.
I REPRESENT EVY MEMBER
of THE SANHEDRIN OF EARTH CENTRAL.
Yes, HOW PROFOUNDLY MOVING.
and YOUR NAME IS CURRAN?
you CAN CALL ME BARNEY.
well, MR. CURRAN, OR AMBASSADOR CURRAN,
or PLENIPOTENTIARY HIGH-MUCKETTY-DOODLE CURRAN,
we PERCEIVE YOUR VAST IMPORTANCE.
now JUST GET ON WITH IT.
captain, COULD YOU INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR ASSOCIATES?
okay, SAM.
well, UH, THIS IS HARMONY AT.
I... UH, WE ARE SAMSWOPE, THE CAPTAIN'S RIGHT ARM.
I AM SAMSWOPE.
let ME SEE IF I CAN GUESS, MR. SANHEDRIN EARTH NEIGHBOR.
you WANT US TO MOVE OUR LITTLE LOAD OF MISFITS
off ORBIT L-5, OR WE'LL BLAST YOUR ASSES AWAY.
Oh, NO. N-NO, IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.
and IN FACT, I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF US DOWN THERE
haven IDEA OF HOW HARD IT'S BEEN FOR YOU PEOPLE.
without THE LUBRICANT, HUH? JUST SPIT IT OUT.
BEDZYK, LET HIM TALK.
you WERE THE CONTROL THAT SKIMMED US IN.
lovely JOB--LIKE A BALLET.
Hey, CURRAN--RIGGUM. BEG YOUR PARDON?
G... M. HE BLOOD POOP.
random IDIOPATHIC GENOMIC MUTATION.
the SICKNESS." THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING
like ANOTHER HEAD.
do YOU THINK THAT EARTH CENTRAL HATES YOU,
that WE DON'T FEEL YOU PAIN?
God, IT'S BEEN 37 YEARS.
you--you HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE FEEL THE GUILT
and TORMENT OF WHAT THE FORMER GENERATION DID TO YOU.
Oh, THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER SEND GET-WELL PACKAGES
or TOILET PAPER?
Mr. BEDZYK AND I NEED TO TELL OUR HAPPY LITTLE BAND
why YOU'RE HERE, SHERIFF.
so GO AHEAD.
uh, BY THE WAY, I NOTICE THAT YOU'RE
a HEALTHY, ARROW-SLIM NORMAL LAD.
did THEY PICK YOU PREFERENTIALLY,
to GIVE US A LITTLE TWEAK OF THE ANTENNAE?
Ah.
Oh, GOD.
you're ONE OF US.
the RUNNIES.
that's HOW DARTING PRIEST WENT. REMEMBER, BEDZYK?
and GARY WHAT'S-HIS-NAME,
the ONE THAT DRANK THE CAN OF LYE.
they SENT YOU TO BE A PASSENGER. WHAT'D YOU DO, STEAL THE YACHT?
it's GETTING WORSE... MUCH WORSE
the SICKNESS--RIGGUM.
but WHY'D YOU COME TO US
what, TO TELL US WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO DOUBLE-BUNK?
th're GONNA SEND A--A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MORE DISCARDS
up HERE TO OUR FLOATING SWAMP? IF IT WERE THAT, WE WOULDN'T SEND HUNDREDS.
we'd SEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.
it's SPREADING--CHANGING US LIKE A TIDAL WAVE EVERY DAY.
there IS NO DAY HERE-- ALSO NO NIGHT.
every DAY IS EVERY DAY.
Sam, LET HIM TELL IT.
after THE FIRST WAVE OF DISCARDS...
after ALL OF YOU... LEFT,
it SPREAD FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENT.
we DON'T KNOW HOW. WE DIDN'T KN THE
the VECTOR OF CONTAMINATION-- IF IT WAS FLEAS, TICKS,
animals, PEOPLE.
we DIDN'T KNOW. BUT THERE WAS A SPRAY
um, GERMICIDE OR PHEROMONIC, I DON'T KNOW.
I'm NOT A BIOLOGIST. BUT THE SANHEDRIN
sprayed THE ENTIRE PLANET, AND IT WORKED
for ABOUT 11 YEARS.
and THEN THE SICKNESS MUTATED AROUND IT
got STRONGER, SMARTER. DAMN RIGGUM.
got EVEN TOUGHER. THE RIGMAROLE.
something IN THE SPRAY ITSELF ACTIVATED A TRIGGER
in THE NUCLEUS OF THE PLAGUE VIRUS.
everyone WAS HIT.
there's NO CHANCE TO ISOLATE IT OR FOR QUARANTINE.
so WHAT, WE'RE THE ONES WHO GOT OFF EASY?
is THAT--IS THAT WHAT YOU CAME TO TELL US? THAT IS A BIT RICH.
it GOT SO BAD, PEOPLE EVACUATED THE CITIES,
started LIVING IN STERILE SHELTERS
and DOMES UNDERGROUND.
we THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER. AND THEN A DOCTOR,
a HUNGARIAN, CAME UP WITH A SERUM.
do YOU HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING? DON'T YOU GET IT YET?
a CURE.
the ONLY THING THAT STOPS IT FROM SPRDING.
it's A--IT'S A SERUM
synthesized FROM PREPANDEMIC ENZYMES
that IS ONLY FOUND IN BLOOD, IN... IN THE BLOOD OF...
of DISCARDS.
of US!
are YOU KIDDIN' ME? YOU WANT OUR BLOOD!
here I THOUGHT I'D LOST MY FAITH IN THE WICKEDNESS OF MANKIND.
y-y-you WANT US TO SAVE YOU?
Hey, BARNEY-- Y, YOU GOT A WORLD
full OF FREAKS UP THERE, HUH?
why DON'T YOU USE THEM? BETTER YET,
why DON'T YOU POP INTO ONE OF YOUR OWN PUKY VEINS?
Hey, YOU COULD SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD YOURSELF. WE'RE NO GOOD. THE SICKNESS CHANGED US.
our BLOOD DOESN'T SECRETE THE SAME ENZYMES.
well, THEN YOU AND THE WORLD HAVE CRAPPED OUT,
because I WOULDN'T TAKE A WHIZ ON YOU
if THERE WERE FLAMES SHOOTING OUT OF YOUR EYEBALLS.
if YOU'D LISTEN TO MY PROPOSAL,
I THINK YOU MIGHT WELL RECONSIDER.
it COULD CHANGE THE LIVES OF EVERYONE ABOARD THIS VESSEL-- OH, SURE IT WILL.
if YOU WOULD JUST LISTEN-- I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN TO YOU.
you GOT NOTHING I WANT TO LISTEN TO.
No!
comin' HOME! COMIN' HOME!
baby JESUS--JESUS LOVES ME! GRAB HIM!
hallelujah, JESUS!
Hallelujah! I'M GOIN' HOME!
smiler, NO! I CANNOT WAIT!
I'm GOIN' HOME!
I'm GOIN' HOME, BABY JESUS!
you WANT TO TALK TO THE CAPTAIN?
well, TALK TO HER.
you KNOW HOW TO USE THIS THING?
Yeah, HARMONY TAUGHT ME.
what HAPPENED?
SMILER LOST IT-- TRIED TO BRING US DOWN.
tried TO KILL THE CATHEDRAL
merely SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HARMONY TEAT.
well, WHERE IS HE?
Chucho RED'S GOT HIM LOCKED UP IN THE LAZARETTE.
well, YOU'RE STILL HERE?
it's IMPORTANT THAT I FINISH WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.
well, IF IT'S IMPORTANT, YOU'D BETTER FINISH.
you ALL NEED TO KNOW THAT WE CARE.
what HAPPENED TO YOU IS HAPPENING TO US, ONLY FASTER.
we've WATCHED PEOPLE CHANGE RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.
no FAMILY IS UNTOUCHED.
my WIFE...
on BEHALF OF TERRAN CENTRAL, IF YOU AGREE TO HELP US,
we're PREPARED TO LET YOUR SHIP LAND
and HOUSE ALL OF YOU ON EARTH.
you'll BHOME AGAIN. YOU'LL--YOU'LL BREATHE REAL AIR,
feel REAL LAND.
what HAPPENS IF WE DECIDE NOT TO GIVE YOU OUR BLOOD?
Yeah, THAT'S RIGHT. HE WANTS OUR BLOOD.
you'll COME OUT HERE AND TAKE IT ANYWAY, WON'T YOU?
no, OF COURSE NOT. NO, WE'LL SEND AN EMISSARY
to ANOTHER SHIP, BUT I HOPE THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. WHAT DO YOU THINK, WE'RE A BUNCH OF IDIOTS?
you WON'T GIVE US ANYTHING. YES, WE WILL. I SWEAR.
Oh, GOD, YOU'RE A LIAR, CURRAN.
you're AN ERRAND BOY WEARING A SAILOR SUIT.
you're THEIR LAPDOG WITH A BAD CASE OF THE MANGE.
you'll SAY WHATEVER TAKES. PLEASE.
I SUSPECT THAT I'M NOT ISOLATED
in MY NAKED, DESPERATE, PAIN-FILLED NEED
to RETURN TO THE PLANET OF MY YOUTH.
this ISN'T HOME, BEDZYK. WE WANT TO GO BACK TO EARTH.
all OF US-- WE WANT TO GO BACK HOME!
there IS NO EARTH!
not FOR US. NOT NOW, NOT EVER.
it's WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO, SAM. THEY LIE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.
how COULD IT POSSIBLY BE TO OUR DETRIMENT, OLD FRIEND?
he SAID WE COULD GO BACK HOME!
and HE'S LYING!
let HIM SCREW AROUND WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S SHIP--NOT MINE!
mine"? GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I'm GONNA THROW THIS LYING PISSANT OFF THE SHIP. NO!
they ARE NOT GONNA LET US GET ANY CLOSER TO EARTH!
can't YOU PATHETIC FREAKS EVER REALIZE THAT?
you MUST DISABUSE YOURSELF OF THIS PARANOIA, THIS HATRED.
simply PUT, THEY WANT WHAT IT IS THAT ONLY WE CAN PROVIDE.
we NEED WHAT THEY HAVE-- OUR HOME!
home? ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID?
you ARE AS CLOSE TO A FRIEND AS ANYONE I'VE KNOWN,
and WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
I CONSIDER YOU TO BE AN EQUAL.
I DON'T MIND IF YOU THINK I'M A FOOL,
but DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AS IF YOU THINK I'M ONE.
Oh, COME ON, SAM. YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THIS.
they're NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF BACKSTABBING, ARROGANT LIARS.
cease AND DESIST.
your AUTHORITY HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED,
and YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPLANTED.
Yes!
Oh. SO NOW WE'RE A DEMOCRACY, EH?
yesterday, IT WAS "AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.
today "YOU'RE SUPERSEDED.
as DISTRESSING AS IT MAY SEEM, YES.
how ABOUT YOU, ANNIE? WHERE DO YOU STAND?
I'm SORRY, BEDZYK.
look, YOU'RE SO ANGRY,
you're NOT SEEING ANY OF THIS CLEARLY.
I SEE IT REAL CLEAR.
you PEOPLE...
anytime ANYTHING EVER WENT WRONG,
you CAME RUNNIN' FOR ME, DIDN'T YOU, HUH?
something HAD TO BE DONE, SOME DECISION HAD TO BE MADE
Where's BEDZYK? GO GET BEDZYK. GET BEDZYK.
and THIS--THIS
this EARTH SCUM SHOWS UP WITH THE RUNNIES.
he HOLDS UP THIS BRIGHT AND SHINY NEW LIE,
and YOU ALL SIT UP AND WAG YOUR TAILS.
it IS NOT MY MOST FERVENT WISH
to EXPIRE ON THIS GALACTIC LATRINE.
lien TO ME. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF ALL OF YOU.
we HAVE HUGE PLOTS OF LAND IN SOUTH AMERICA
rugged LAND, I'LL ADMIT-- BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
for ALL OF YOU. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!
never TRUST AN EARTHMAN. NEVER!
BEDZYK, SHUT UP!
it's WHAT WE ALL WANT, BEDZYK.
get OFF MY SHIP!
BEDZYK, STOP!
now YOU'VE DONE IT.
get YOUR MEDICAL TEAMS UP HERE AND START WITH THE BLOODS.
we WISH TO GO HOME, AMBASSADOR CURRAN.
we WISH TO GO HOME NOW.
Ah! ONCE AGAIN,
the MANIFESTATION OF THE VENERABLE,
IDIOM-PRECISE DR. JANET GOLDSTEIN,
savior OF OUR MISBEGOTTEN COMPATRIOTS
both HERE AND ON EARTH.
SAMSWOPE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
your WORK HERE APPROACHES A DENOUEMENT.
we FINALLY HIT OUR QUOTA TODAY.
the RESCUE VESSEL IS ON THE WAY.
I WONDER WHO'S MORE EXCITED-- YOUR PEOPLE OR MINE?
what?
Oh, I ADMIT, BEFORE THIS OPERATION COMMENCED,
I FELT A FLOURISH OF CYNICISM
a TOUCH OF THE OLD VAMPIRE, DON'T YA KNOW?
you've DONE WELL, SAMSWOPE.
you've SAVED THE WORLD,
and YOU'VE SAVED YOUR PEOPLE.
we COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU,
and NO ONE'S EVER GONNA FORGET THAT.
well, SHUCKS, DOC.
I'll BE SUPERAMALGAMATED.
are YOU READY TO GIVE ONE LAST TIME?
old GIRLFRIEND?
could WE JUST FINISH THIS?
Aah!
I HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE RESCUE VESSEL
E. T.A. six hours.
thank YOU, ANNIE.
Roger that.
you DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY EXCITED.
Ah, BUT I AM.
six HOURS...
there's MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME.
barely ENOUGH TO MASTER
all THOUTLANDISH PERMUTATIONS
of THIS CONNUBIATION CUSTOM.
Steve's WEDDING?
but OF COURSE, MY DARLING.
this IS A FIRST, ISN'T IT? TRULY.
never HAPPENED WHEN BEDZYK WAS RUNNING THINGS.
then AGAIN, WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO CELEBRATE.
what?
it WAS NOT MY INTENTION...
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM, FRENCHY.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
he WAS GOING TO RUIN EVERYTHING.
you DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
you GAVE US HOPE.
you GAVE US BACK OUR HOME, SAM.
here WE GO.
Wow. OKAY.
just A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THERE.
brothers AND SISTERS,
mesdames ET MONSIEURS,
freaks AND FROGS, FLOTSAM AND JETSAM,
we ARE AGGREGATED HERE TO WITNESS THE TRI-BINDING
of A TRIO OF OUR ASSEMBLY IN HOLY MATRIMONY...
it WOULD BE REMISS OF ME NOT TO MAKE MENTION
of THE FACT THAT THIS MOMENT IS WITHOUT PRECEDENT
in THE ANNALS OF OUR ORDEAL.
this IS THE FIRST WEDDING WE'VE EVER HAD HERE...
a SYMBOL OF NEW BEGINNINGS
bespeaking OUR IMMINENT DEPARTURE
for A HOME TO WHICH WE FEARED WE MIGHT NEVER RETURN.
Yes!
Steve, DO YOU TAKE THESE OTHER TWO
to BE YOUR LIFELONG LOVEMATES?
I DO.
Bucky, DO YOU TAKE THESE OTHER TWO
to BE YOUR LIFELONG LOVEMATES?
I DO.
Sharon, DO YOU TAKE THESE OTHER TWO
for YOUR LIFELONG LOVEMATES? OKAY.
all OF WHICH HAVE THE MERIT OF BEING ACCEPTABLE ANSWERS
to THE QUERY JUST POSED.
Steve, SHARON, BUCKY, I HAVE THE DISTINCT PLEASURE
in PRONOUNCING YOU MEN, WOMEN, BISEXES, BIVALVES,
baby-blue HUSBANDS AND/OR WIVES.
Sam? THEY'RE HERE.
they're DOCKING.
come! LET US GREET THE ENGINES OF OUR SALVATION!
ambassador CURRAN, WELCOME BACK.
you ARRIVE AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE MOMENT.
the VERY THOUGHT OF OUR REPATRIATION IS...
No!
No!
No!
Oh.
am I SAMSWOPE?
somebody CLEAN THAT UP
and BLOW IT OUT THE GARBAGE PORT!
what monstrosities would walk the streets were some peopli's faces as unfinished as their minds
from the very beginning, we have wondered how life began.
what our purpose is and where we are headed.
we HAVE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND TIME, MATTER, THE INFINITE UNIVERSE, WHO WE ARE AND IF WE ARE ALONE.
great MINDS HAVE IMAGINED THE MOST WONDERFUL AND THE MOST TERRIFYING ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS.
we INVITE YOU TO JOIN US ON THIS GREAT EXPEDITION.
company HALT.
sweep THE MINES, JOES.
on MY ORDER-- WAIT FOR IT.
if NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION, WHAT WILL DRIVE OUR INGENUITY WHEN ALL OUR NEEDS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED?
mr ND MRS VAN VOGEL, TIBOR CARGREW.
how DO YOU DO?
hmm. WELCOME TO CONTROLLED GENETICS.
walk THIS WAY.
wait.
here AT CONTROLLED GENETICS, WE DON'T TRY.
we JUST DO.
that's VERY PROFOUND THINKING.
Yes, FROM PEOPLE WHOSE WISDOM COMES FROM READING T-SHIRTS.
Oh, ARROGANCE AND MONEY. I LIKE THAT COMBINATION.
well, WE HAVE BUCKETS OF BOTH.
well, LET ME TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE ON THE WAY TO MY OFFICE. A PRIVATE TOUR, YES?
we DON'T HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH ANYONE, DO WE?
no ONE FROM THE, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
uh, THE PUBLIC. GOOD LORD, NO. WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?
sigret, BOSS? WHAT?
SIGRET.
I THINK HE WANTS A CIGARETTE.
get BACK TO WORK, JOE.
Jerry. UH... JERRY LIKE SIGRET.
no, JERRY, CIGARETTES ARE BAD FOR YOU--VERY BAD FOR YOU.
Oh... JERRY LIKE CANDY. I LIKE CANDY, TOO.
don't ENCOURAGE HIM, BROWNIE. GET BACK TO WORK.
this WAY.
SIGRET?
this IS THE PLASTO-BIOLOGY ATRIUM. OH.
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT. I DESIGNED IT.
Oh, DID YOU?
Yes.
welcome TO THE JOE NURSERY.
baby JOES DON'T CRY REAL TEARS.
before WE CAN ASSIGN THE WORKERS TO THE JOB THAT THEY WERE BUILT FOR,
we TAKE THEM OUT OF THE HATCHERY,
and THEN THEY GO THROUGH THEIR FIRST OPERATION TO MELD THE PLASTO WITH THE BIOLOGICAL.
Mrs. VAN VOGEL, MAY I HAVE A WORD, PLEASE?
have YOU EVER CONSIDERED ANY PLASTO-BIOLOGY FOR YOURSELF?
what?
how OLD ARE YOU NOW, 100? 85.
Oh. I'M ONLY 85.
must BE THE LIGHTING IN HERE. PLEASE, OVER HERE.
radiation DOESN'T STOP THE JOE.
radiation CAN BE FUN IF YOU'RE A JOE.
that IS A GLOWBOY, ISN'T IT? ISN'T THAT A GLOWBOY?
brownie, YOU KNOW A NEW WORD. WH-WHAT'S A GLOWBOY?
that's A CLEAN-UP JOE AT A NUCLEAR REACTOR.
they DON'T LAST LONG.
believe IT OR NOT, IT'S CHEAPER THAN GETTING THE LOCALS TO DO THE SAME JOB FOR 3 CENTS AND A BOB MARLEY T-SHIRT.
the BEST THING ABOUT IT IS, NO HEALTH INSURANCE.
you KNOW, IT USED TO BE VERY DANGEROUS WORK.
now THE JOES DO IT.
you WON'T SEE ANY OF THESE THINGS APPLYING EARLY DECISION AT CORNELL, EH, CARGREW?
yeah... OVER HERE.
radiation CAN BE FUN IF YOU'RE A JOE.
now OVER HERE, WE'VE-- DOUBLE SOY LATTE.
very GOOD.
we've JUST RECEIVED AN ORDER FOR 25, 000 OF THESE JOES.
so THEY'LL BE WORKING AT A CERTAIN CHAIN OF COFFEEHOUSE
which I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO NAME,
but SUFFICE TO SAY, THERE'LL BE NO MORE OF THOSE LITTLE TIP JARS BY THE CASH REGISTER.
you KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? TIPPING, US?
would YOU LIKE A MUFFIN WITH YOUR COFFEE?
fellow AT THE CLUB COMES INTO THE CLUB
the BRADBURY CLUB
they WOULDN'T LET YOU IN BECAUSE, WELL, YOU WORK.
we're THERE EVERY DAY, OUR USUAL PLACE,
having R USUAL CONVERSATION...
and SINCE THEY'RE ONLY $50, 000 EACH, WE'LL GET BOTH.
why DON'T WE JUST GET ALL THREE?
pudgy, YOU KNOW THE RULES.
pudgy, YOU KNOW THE RULES.
no DOGS EXCEPT SEEING EYE DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE THE CLUB.
and SINCE WE DON'T ACCEPT THE BLIND AS MEMBERS...
and SINCE WE DON'T ACCEPT THE BLIND AS MEMBERS,
no DOGS AT ALL.
Oh, MY GOD! IS THERE A DOG IN THE CLUBHOUSE?
that's A DOG, PUDG
no, NOT LEGALLY. YOU'RE NOT A REAL DOG, ARE YOU, BOY?
I'm NOT A REAL DOG.
I'm A PLASTO-BIOLOGICAL HYBRID. YES, YES, YES, YES
a PLASTO-BIOLOGICAL HYBRID.
and I ONLY COST $1 MILLION.
I'm THE MILLION-DOLLAR PUPPY!
the MILLION-DOLLAR PUPPY.
a 6-LEGGED DACHSHUND.
and HE MADE A FOOL OUT OF US.
we WANT TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING... MORE IMPRESSIVE.
what, LIKE AN 9-LEGGED DACHSHUND?
we DON'T DO DACHSHUNDS.
funny LITTLE DOGS-- JUST NOT US.
vulgar, GROTESQUE.
it's YOUR IDEA, BROWNIE. YOU CAN TELL HIM.
$500 MILLION, AND HE THINKS HE'S RICH. HA.
$500 MILLION, AND HE THINKS HE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE FUN OF US, TO SHOW OFF.
a MILLION BUCKS...
and A 6-LEGGED WIENER BUYS HIM A FEW MINUTES OF ATTENTION.
what KIND OF DESIGNER ANIMAL DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO BURN THAT SMILE OFF HIS FAT FACE?
I HAVE AN IDEA.
Mm-hmm? OH, I HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA.
will IT COST LOTS OF MONEY?
Oh... SO MUCH, SO VERY MUCH.
Ooh!
I LIKE IT!
what? PEGASUS.
I WANT A FLYING HORSE.
I WANT TO LAND ON THE ROOF OF THE CLUB ON A FLYING HORSE.
big GOLD WINGS... AND THEN I WANT THAT FLYING HORSE TO STEP ON THAT DAMN DACHSHUND AND SQUEEZE ALL THE DACHSHUND OUT OF IT LIKE A DACHSHUND BURRITO.
a DACHSHUND ISN'T EVEN A DECENT ANIMAL WHEN IT HAS THE REGULATION FOUR LEGS.
you KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
we WANT IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN MAKE IT.
a PEGASUS--HOW MUCH?
Oh, JUST HOLD ON A SECOND. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
the SEVENTH RICHEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD JUST TOLD YOU WHAT SHE WANTS. GET IT FOR HER.
just HOLD YOUR GENETICALLY UNMODIFIED HORSES, BROWNIE.
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEONE VERY SPEAL.
is HE GOING TO BRING OUT SOMEONE RETARDED AND ASK US FOR CHARITY? IF HE DOES, WE'LL WALK OUT.
thank YOU.
someone VERY SPECIAL, INDEED.
come ON, COME ON.
come ON, COME ON.
a BABY ELEPHANT!
Oh, LOOK, BRON, A BABY ELEPHANT.
where IS YOUR MOMMY?
actually, AHEM, I'M HIS MOMMY, AND HE'S N A BABY.
Oh, YES, HE IS. HE'S A VEWY YOUNG ELEPHANT.
in SPITE OF THE QUAINT WAY THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING HIM,
he REALLY IS A FULLY GROWN, FULLY FORMED ADULT.
what?
he SAID, "I PRESENT TO YOU NAPOLEON.
it's FRENCH. OH.
for THE PRICE I'M SURE YOU'RE ASKING, THAT'S THE LEAST.
for THE PRICE WE'RE ASKING, HE CAN READ AND WRITE.
Oh, WHAT BEAUTIFUL WRITING.
he LIKES ME!
Oh, LOOK, BRON, HE LIKES ME.
he DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME, AND HE LIKES ME.
I WANT A HORSE, MARTHA.
get THE HORSE, IF YOU WANT IT. I WANT THE BABY ELEPHANT.
um, ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT A BABY.
he's FULL GROWN, AND HE COMES WITH HIS OWN LITTLE BED.
Oh, SWEETIE...
does ANYONE ELSE HAVE ONE OF THESE INGS?
Oh, GOOD LORD.
I WOULDN'T DARE SHOW HIM TO YOU IF YOU WEREN'T THE FIRST.
how MUCH?
3350000.0
Oh, WRITE THE CHECK, BRON. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT A SCRIBBLING ELEPHANT IS GOING TO TRUMP PUDGY'S DACHSHUND.
what ABOUT THE PEGASUS? WELL, GET THE PEGASUS IF YOU WANT IT.
Napoleon MAKES ME GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS OF EGO AND REVENGE.
he MAKES ME WANT TO BE PURE AND GOOD AND KIND.
anyway, WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY SUPPLY YOU WITH A PEGASUS TODAY.
you DON'T WANT US TO HAVE A PEGASUS, AND I KNOW WHY
because YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GRAFT WINGS ON A HORSE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GRAFT WINGS ON A HORSE?
that's LIKE SAYING THE CREATOR OF "BUGS BUNNY" WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANIMATE A BOUNCING BALL.
look HERE, BROWNIE, YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST CABANA BOY TO COME WALTZING IN HERE WITH HIS WIFE'S MONEY, ASKING FOR PEGASUS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED.
who's BUGS BUNNY?
let ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.
I CAN MAKE YOU A LIVING THING-- I WON'T CALL IT AN ANIMAL
the SIZE AND THE SHAPE... OF THIS TABLE HERE.
alive? YEAH, BUT GOOD FOR WHAT?
ingesting FOOD?
making CHEMICAL ENERGY, DOING DOO-DOO?
displaying IRRITABILITY-- AAH.
come ON, IT'S A STUPID, SILLY MANIPULATION.
mechanically, A TABLE AND A HORSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.
hmm, SURE,
I COULD MAKE YOU A WINGED HORSE.
you JUST SAID YOU COULDN'T.
permission NOT GRANTED TO INTERRUPT.
I SAID I COULD MAKE YOU A WINGED HORSE.
it JUST WON'T FLY.
an ANIMAL IS A MACHINE. IT'S A HEAT ENGINE THAT USES LEVERS AND HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS.
you SAVVY AERODYNAMICS? I HAVE A JET, OF COURSE.
do YOU RUN YOUR JET ON HAY?
because A HORSE IS A HAY-BURNER.
an AERODYNAMIC HORSE WOULD NEED A BREASTBONE 10 FEET WIDE,
a WINGSPAN OF 80 FEET.
folded, ITS WINGS WOULD COVER IT LIKE A HUGE TENT.
if I WERE YOU, I'D BE SAYING, "CARGREW, YOU'RE A WHORE."
what THE WORLD NEEDS IS THE RETURN OF THE GULF CURRENT.
what THE WORLD NEEDS IS CURES FOR CANCER, SWINE FLU "AND INHERITED WEALTH."
and WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
you're ACTING LIKE A FRENCH TOY MAKER , TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY CUT OFF THE HEAD OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, SUPPLYING T PARASITE CLASSES WITH GROTESQUE DIVERSIONS , LIKE OPERA-SINGING CUCKOO CLOCKS, "WHEN YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE MANNING THE BARRICADES, "CHIEF ENGINEER TO A 10-SEAT GUILLOTINE.
instead, YOU'RE MAKING MINIATURE ELEPHANTS.
you're DISGUSTING, CARGREW, A PATHETIC REPRESENTATIVE OF SCIENCE GONE BAD...GONE WAY BAD.
well, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD BE SAYING, AND MORE,
but I'M THROUGH GIVING THE ENEMY ALL MY BEST AMMUNITION.
my HUSBAND IS NOT A CABANA BOY.
he's A CADDIE. AH.
there's A DIFFERENCE...
and WE'LL TAKE THE ELEPHANT.
do I REALLY LOOK 100?
no, NO. OH, WHAT DO YOU THINK I NEED?
we'll TALK LATER.
but...
well, THAT'S JERRY.
what's HE DOING? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?
hmm? WELL, WAIT.
that JOE, JERRY--HE JUST SAID SOMETHING TO ME.
Oh, FORGET ABOUT HIM.
no, NO, I THINK HE WAS SAYING, "HELP ME.
help ME"? GOOD LORD, NO.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO.
Ah, NO, WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS, "KILL ME.
Yes, "KILL ME." THEY ALL SAY THAT NEAR THE END.
you're GOING TO KILL HIM?
well, THIS BATCH IS SCHEDULED FOR LIQUIDATION
in WHAT, TWO OR THREE DAYS? WHEN'S PROCESSING? TWO HOURS.
Oh, THERE YOU ARE. TWO HOURS. TWO HOURS.
he's GOING TO DIE.
we're ALL GOING TO DIE. WELL, I KNOW THAT,
but WE'RE NOT DYING ON SCHEDULE.
next.
Oh, MY.
this WAY, MOVE IT THROUGH.
candy.
candy.
candy, PLEASE, MISSY. CANDY.
Hello, JERRY. CANDY, MISSY?
here, JERRY. A CANDY, A MINT.
Oh... SANKOO, MISSY. ME JERRY.
how DO YOU DO, JERRY?
howdy, MISSY.
this IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.
well, BRONSON, DOESN'T HE LOOK EXACTLY LIKE UNCLE ALBERT,
except THAT HE'S SO SAD?
Jerry, WHY ARE YOU SO SAD?
ask A SPARE TIRE TO DESCRIBE A ROSE.
Joes DON'T HAVE ABSTRACT REASONING. JERRY SAD.
well, HE ANSWERED.
no, HE SPOKE. HE DIDN'T ANSWER.
why, JERRY? WHY ARE YOU SO SAD?
Oh, NO WORK, NO SIGRET, NO CANDY.
no WORK.
what HAPPENED? WHAT WAS HE DESIGNED FOR?
well, LET ME SEE. THIS BATCH WERE...
uh, MINESWEEPERS FOR THE ARMY.
we TRIED TO RETRAIN THEM AS CARPET CLEANERS, FLOOR POLISHING, EVEN AS GARDENERS,
but THEIR GENETICALLY IMPRINTED PATTERN THAT THEY WALK DOESN'T INCLUDE THEM GETTING AROUND THE FURNITURE.
Joe, WALK THE FIELD.
Jerry WALK THE FIELD.
Jerry? JOE WALK THE FIELD.
see?
Jerry WALK THE FIELD, WALK THE FIELD, JERRY.
no BOOM. GET CANDY? GET SIGRET? SIGRET?
he WAS SENT INTO MINEFIELDS?
Yes, WELL, OBVIOUSLY HE MADE IT OUT.
but JERRY WANTS TO WORK.
work? OH, SURE, MIKE.
good WORK.
uh, JERRY WALK THE FIELD.
one STEP, ONE STEP, ONE STEP.
no BOOM. SAFE, SAFE.
you're GOING TO KILL HIM, AND HE WANTS TO WORK?
look, LET ME JUST TELL YOU THIS.
he WAS TRAINED AND BRED TO BE BLOWN UP.
and NOW THE ARMY HAS NO FURTHER USE FOR HIM,
there's NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO.
so ALL WE'RE DOING IS JUST TRIMMING OFF THE BAD PARTS OF HIS LIFE,
and DON'FORGET, THE JOES WOULDN'T BE HERE IF WE HADN'T BEEN HERE, BECAUSE WE INVENTED THEM.
how MUCH?
how MUCH WHAT?
how MUCH WILL IT COST ME TO BUY HIM FROM YOU? AND HOW MANY PARAKEETS DID YOU BUY FROM THE PET STORE THIS MORNING
so YOU COULD LET THEM ALL FLY FREE?
you WANNA SAVE THAT JOE FROM DOG FOOD?
you TURN THEM INTO DOG FOOD?
a VERY GOOD LARGE BREED PUPPY FOOD, ACTUALLY,
high IN PROTEIN. OH, MY GOD.
this IS OUR BUSINESS, BABY.
we SELL EVERYTHING BUT THE OINK.
anyway, HE'S ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR.
come ON, TOOTS.
I MEAN, YOU'RE ONE OF THE RICHEST WOMEN ON THE PLANET.
how'd YOU THINK THE WORLD WORKS?
I-- THAT'S MY FAULT.
I WORK VERY HARD TO KEEP HER HAPPY AND AMUSED AND DISTRACT HER FROM THE PAIN OF THE WORLD.
except THE JOES DON'T FEEL ANY PAIN.
there, YOU HEARD IT, ARTHA. SEE? THEY DON'T FEEL PAIN.
but IF HE LIKES CANDY, HE FEELS PLEASURE.
but IT'S NOT THE SAME AS YOU AND I WANTING IT, HONEY I WANT HIM.
now I WANT HIM EVEN MORE. I WANT HIM.
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH HIM?
are YOU GOING TO LOOK FOR MINES? OH, WALK THE FIELD.
stop, JERRY. I'M GOING TO RESCUE HIM.
how MUCH?!
don't TELL ME YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR MIND ABOUT NAPOLEON,
the SCRIBBLING PACHYDERM. IF I CAN'T HAVE THE JOE, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE ELEPHANT.
I'm NOT GIVING THIS COMPANY ANY OF MY MONEY
if I CAN'T HAVE THE JOE-- JERRY--IF I CAN'T HAVE JERRY.
I TOLD YOU THE DOG FOOD COMPANY PAID FOR HIM ALREADY.
well, HOW MUCH, AND I'LL PAY IT BACK?
is IT--IS IT THE SALE THAT YOU D'T WANT?
we COULD ALWAYS LEASE HIM.
brownie, YOU HAD A GOOD IDEA JUST NOW--A VERY GOOD IDEA.
lease... HMM, LEASE.
Yes, THAT MAY WORK, ACTUALLY. SON OF A GUN, YOU GOT ME THERE.
all RIGHT. ONE YEAR, PAID IN ADVANCE.
MARTHA-- WHATEVER. JERRY.
Jerry, YOU'RE COMING HOME.
Oh, BOY. WHAT A GOOD ELEPHANT.
no MORE WRITING ON THE FLOOR, NAPPY.
remember WHAT I TOLD YOU?
he LIKES ME. YOU CAN LET HIM EXPRESS HIMSELF IF HE LIKES ME.
it's JUST INK. IT'LL WASH OFF. HERE.
well, SO WHAT?
all GONE. SIGRET?
SIGRET LATER, JERRY.
Oh, JERRY MESSY. JERRY NEED CLEAN UP.
I THINK YOU NEED TO CLEAN UP, JERRY.
Oh, NO BOOM TODAY. JERRY WALK.
Jerry NO BOOM. WALK, NO BOOM.
candy? SIGRET? OH, JERRY WORK GOOD, BOSS.
Jerry WORK GOOD, BOSS.
think YOU'RE JEALOUS OF JERRY'S HAPPINESS, BROWNIE.
uh, HE HAS NO EMOTIONS, MARTHA.
the ELEPHANT HAS MORE EMOTIONS THAN THE JOE.
don't YOU, BOY?
don't YOU HAVE MORE EMOTIONS THAT SILLY OLD JOE?
Oh, JERRY SAD.
no SIGRET. OH, JERRY SAD.
Oh, JERRY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SAD.
brownie SAD. BROWNIE ALONE HERE.
Missy NEVER CLEAN UP BROWNIE.
brownie DIDN'T SERVE HIS COMPANY--COUNTRY.
whatever, COMPANY, COUNTRY
you DIDN'T SERVE EITHER ONE WALKING IN THE MINEFIELDS.
come WITH ME, JERRY.
it's BEDTIME.
he's SITTING ON MY PILLOW, MARTHA.
he's JUST A JOE, BROWNIE.
yeah?
he's JUST A JOE.
nappy LIKES HIS BED. OH, LOOK, MARTHA. MARTHA.
I PUT ON HALF A POUND THIS MONTH.
I'm GONNA WORK OUT. COME WITH ME.
let's GO DOWN TO THE GYM ROOM, AND WE'LL THROW ON A MOVIE
and WATCH IT FOR A COUPLE OF MILES ON THE TREADMILL, HMM?
you GO. I'LL STAY HERE AND TAKE CARE OF NAPPY.
well, TELL NAPPY I SAID GOOD NIGHT.
you DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT, DO YOU, JERRY?
Jerry LIKE CANDY.
that IS SUCH A SIMPLE TRUTH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY A SENTENCE WITH JUST THREE SIMPLE WORDS.
SIGRET?
or ONE WORD. WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING JERRY?
hmm?
Oh, IT'S SILLY TO ASK, ISN'T IT?
might AS WELL ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING MARTHA.
Jerry, UH, WALK?
well, THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?
Jerry WALK. MARTHA SPEND.
Jerry SMOKE. MARTHA DIET.
Martha MAKE LOVE TO HUSBAND.
Martha ROLL OVER AND GO TO SLEEP. MARTHA WAKE UP.
Martha WORK OUT. MARTHA SPEND MONEY.
Martha SPEND...
lots AND LOTS OF... MONEY.
do YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT MONEY IS?
Oh, CANDY. UH, SIGRET?
of COURSE. WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE BUT WHAT YOU BUY WITH IT?
and IF YOU DON'T SPEND IT, THEN IT'S NOTHING.
Oh, DID I GET THIS RIGHT, JERRY?
if MONEY IS JUST CANDY AND CIGARETTES
no, SIGRET.
SIGRET.
well...
if MONEY IS JUST WHAT YOU TRADE IT FOR
and YOU DON'T TRADE IT,
then YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
we LIVE VERY SIMPLY...
like IN THE BIBLE.
so IF I HAVE ALL MY BILLIONS,
but I DON'T SPEND THEM,
then MY BILLIONS AREN'T REALLY THERE.
that's SO SIMPLE AND YET SO COMPLICATED AT THE SAME TIME.
Jerry, LOOK AT WHAT YOU KNOW.
what IF YOU'RE THE LAST THING I EVER BUY..EXCEPT FOR CLOTHING AND SHOES AND TRAVEL?
I'll BE HAPPY.
thank YOU.
Jerry WANT SLEEP NOW.
Jerry GET SLEEP NOW.
he WAS LONELY.
Oh, CANDY?
out NOW!
walk THE FIELD.
Oh, WALK THE FIELD.
he's GOING BACK. THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
if I HAD A MINEFIELD THAT HE COULD SWEEP,
then I-I COULD KEEP HIM BUSY, BUT I DON'T HAVE A MINEFIELD.
he's OURS.
we GOT A LEASE ON HIM-- NO OPTION TO BUY,
and I'M TAKING HIM BACK.
if YOU DO, I'LL LEAVE YOU.
you'd LEAVE ME FOR THAT WEAPON DETECTOR?
you'd--you'd LEAVE ME FOR THAT THING?!
not "THING." JERRY IS A HIM.
if YOU WANT TO KEEP HIM,
you'll HAVE TO SUE CONTROLLED GENETICS.
do YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S GONNA COST YOU, MARTHA? HMM.
think HARD--IT OR ME?
suing CONTROLLED GENETICS WILL COST ME A LOT LESS THAN MAKING GOOD ON THE PRENUP, DARLING.
I'll TAKE THIS TO COURT.
I'll KEEP HIM, AND I'LL KEEP YOU.
now LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU WOKE UP THE ELEPHANT.
no BOOM.
the LEASE AGREEMENT IS VERY CLEAR, MRS. VAN VOGEL.
there IS NO LEASE OPTION TO BUY.
so I HAVEN'T SAVED HIS LIFE.
it WASN'T YOURS TO SAVE.
and AFTER ALL HE DID FOR HIS COUNTRY
I MEAN, COMPANY. COMPANY
except FOR THE PART ABOUT NOT ACTUALLY DYING,
but HE MIGHT HAVE, AND HE SHOULDN'T.
poor JERRY.
so I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO SUE THEM TO CHANGE THE LEASE.
I WANT TO SUE FOR OWNERSHIP, AND THEN I WANT TO SET HIM FREE
and I WANT TO STOP ALL THIS KILLING. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVE
that THEIR METHODS OF DISPOSING OF THESE THINGS WERE INHUMANE,
or IF THEY WERE NEGLIGENT OF THEIR PHYSICAL WELFARE BEFORE DESTROYING THEM OR IF THE DESTRUCTION WAS WANTON-- BUT IT IS.
not IN A LEGAL SENSE.
you CANNOT COMPEL A PERSON TO MAINTAIN PROPERTY AT A LOSS.
what DO YOU THINK, MR. McCOY?
could WE APPROACH THIS THROUGH THE S.P.C.A?
no. NO, THE S. P.C. A. ANGLE'S NO GOOD.
CARGREW'S LAWYERS WILL BE READY TO PROVE THAT THE JOES ACTUALLY ENJOY BEING KILLED OFF.
what ARE YOU THINKING?
does JERRY LIKE MUSIC?
like IT? HE LOVES IT.
he's BEEN LEARNING TO SING.
huh. I'D LIKE TO HEAR HIM SING.
well...
Jerry, TAKE OUT YOUR EAR THINGIES.
good BOY.
Jerry, SING US A SONG-- SOMETHING YOU LIKE.
is THAT YOUR PHONE NUMBER?
no.
that's WHAT IT WILL COST YOU TO HIRE ME TO TAKE THIS CASE TO COURT AND WIN IT.
one OF THE RICHEST WOMEN IN THE WORLD IS PUTTING IT ALL ON THE LINE TODAY
fighting TO SAVE A JOE NAMED JERRY.
I GUESS I'D TAKEN FOR GRANTED ALL OF THE JOES IN THE WORLD
until I MET JERRY.
are YOU SAYING THAT THIS JOE IS A HUMAN?
I'm SAYING TT JERRY AND ALL THE OTHER JOES
shouldn't BE TURNED INTO DOG FOOD
when THEY'RE OUT OF WORK.
well, I DON'T WORK, AND I WOULD HATE TO BE KIBBLED.
the CLUB BOARD HAS VOTED TO TERMINATE MARTHA'S MEMBERSHIP.
we HAVE JOES WORKING HERE, AND THE THOUGHT OF MARTHA COMING INTO THE CLUB WITH A JOE AS A GUEST WAS,
well, FRANKLY DISGUSTING.
a JOE SERVING FOOD TO ANOTHER JOE, UH...
think ABOUT IT-- IT - IT --IT'S INSANE.
IT--IT'S...
well, I'VE SAID IT.
it's INSANE.
all RISE FOR THE HONORABLE JUDGE ALEXA POMFREY,
judge LEO TOLCHINSKY
and JUDGE WENDY NARITA.
you MAY BE SEATED.
as MANY AS 12 BILLION PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS TRIAL.
this TRIBUNAL IS GONNA BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF THE OUTSIDE MEDIA CIRCUS AFFECTS THE DELIBERATIONS IN HERE.
each OF US HAS AT LEAST 70 YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A JUDGE,
and I THINK THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR FAIRNESS AND GOOD MANNERS.
no LAST NAME,
described AS A LEGAL, PERMANENT RESIDENT
against THE CORPORATE PERSON, CONTROLLED GENETICS,
forbidding IT TO DO HIM ANY PHYSICAL HARM,
and IN PARTICULAR, FORBIDDING THE COMPANY FROM KILLING HIM.
counsel FOR THE PLAINTIFF, ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN?
a CORPORATION IS A LEGAL FICTION.
it CAN'T VOTE. IT CAN'T READ A BOOK.
it CAN'T WALK THE DOG,
but YOU ARE GONNA HEAR
this IMAGINARY SOULLESS ENTITY
argue THAT A FLESH AND BLOOD CREATURE,
a BEING OF, UH, HOPES AND LONGINGS AND PASSIONS
that FICTIONAL ENTITY IS GONNA ARGUE THAT A FRIEND OF MINE
has NO LEGAL EXISTENCE,
and THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING
that's WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT-- RIGHT OVER THERE.
my FRIEND JERRY.
SIGRET?
later, JERRY, LATER.
don't TELL ME TO TELL YOU THAT JERRY DOESN'T EXIST,
because, OF COURSE, I KNOW THE JOE EXISTS.
I SEE HIM SITTING OVER THERE.
but IS HE ALIVE?
I DON'T DENY THAT HE HAS A SORT OF LIFE,
but HE'S NOT REALLY A PERSON.
he's THE PRODUCT OF A SERIES OF PATENTS.
everyone THOUGHT THE FUTURE WAS GOING TO BE MECHANICAL ROBOTS, ROBOTS.
but THE WORLD WILL NOT BE SERVED BY TOASTERS.
now WHAT --WHAT IS A JOE?
a JOE IS A FEW STRANDS OF HUMAN D. N.A.
along WITH SOME OTHER STUFF WHICH IS PROPRIETARY,
and THEN IT'S ALL MANIPULATED TO SERVE A SPECIFIC SIGN.
I-I COULD GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
there IS CAMERA JOE.
and OVER HERE--MINEFIELD JOE.
case CLOSED, YOUR HONOR.
we'd LIKE TO SHOW A VIDEO.
hmm. I LIKE VIDEOS.
great. LET'S WATCH.
this WAS TAKEN SIX MONTHS AGO. JERRY IS THE ONE IN THE CENTER.
company HALT.
sweep THE MINES, JOES.
walk, NO BOOM.
Yeah, WELL, MAYBE "WALK, NO BOOM" FOR YOU, JOE, BUT
just WATCH.
SIGRET.
SANKOO.
thank YOU.
what DID YOU JUST SEE?
well, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
that HE DOESN'T CARE WHETHER HE LIVES OR DIES,
and THAT'S THE WAY I DESIGNED HIM.
he's NOT AFRAID OF DEATH.
then IT'S INTO THE BUS, AND AFTER THAT IT'S...
know WHAT I MEAN? NO PROBLEM- O. HE'S NOT A MAN.
your HONOR, I MOVE TO DISMISS THIS CASE.
I WOULD DO THE SAME THING IF I WERE YOU.
Mr. McCOY, CAN WE CALL IT A DAY?
call IT A DAY, YOUR HONOR? A DAY?
you SAW THE VIDEO?
I DID. YOUR HONOR. I SAW THE VIDEO,
and--and THE VIDEO, YOUR HONOR
the VIDEO PROVES THAT JERRY
your HONOR, JERRY IS A MAN.
I KNEW IT.
I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OR THREE QUESTIONS.
you WITH ME?
Yes.
why WAS JERRY SET FOR DESTRUCTION? THE TRUTH.
there WAS NO MORE MONEY IN HIM.
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S LIKE A... A DIFFERENT FORM OF LAYOFF.
in THE OLD DAYS WHEN A CAR COMPANY STOPPED MAKING MONEY ON A MODEL,
they'd FIRE THE WORKERS AND KEEP THE PENSIONS.
now WE... WE LIQUIDATE THEM.
a LOT LESS MISERY, IF YOU ASK ME.
thank YOU, MR. CARGREW, FOR YOUR HONESTY. IT'S A PLEASURE.
next WITNESS.
you MAY STEP DOWN.
Mr. McCOY, WHO DO YOU WANT TO CALL?
objection, YOUR HONOR.
this ANTHROPOID CANNOT BE EXAMINED.
he IS A MERE PART AND CHATTEL OF THE RESPONDENT.
that's WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE.
objection OVERRULED.
okay, JERRY. THEY WANT YOU TO TALK NOW.
you KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND THEN I GET CANDY?
then YOU GET DIGNITY.
no DIGNITY, BOSS. CANDY.
candy NOW, DIGNITY AFTER.
your HONOR, OBJECTION. THE JOE CAN'T TAKE THE WITNESS STAND
because HE CAN'T SWEAR TO AN OATH.
he DOESN'T HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, MR. McCOY?
I SAY LET'S PUT HIM ON THE STAND AND FIND OUT.
proceed WITH THE OATH.
raise YOUR RIGHT HAND.
hello.
do YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH,
the WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,
so HELP YOU GOD...
goddess, BUDDHA, ALLAH, GREAT SPIRIT, HIGHER POWER,
gaia AND THE GREAT TURTLE THAT SUPPORTS THE UNIVERSE?
boss?
okay, BOSS.
Jerry, MY FRIEND,
you're A GOOD WORKER, HUH?
Oh, JERRY A... GOOD WORKER.
Jerry DIG UP WEED. JERRY NO DIG UP VEGETABAR.
Yeah, YEAH, BUT JERRY GOOD SINGER, TOO, AREN'T YOU, JERRY?
your HONOR, OBJECTION. THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING IS IRRELEVANT.
objection OVERRULED. CONTINUE.
Jerry, WOULD YOU SING US YOUR FAVORITE SONG?
no, TH-THANK YOU, JERRY.
I WANT TO ESTABLISH FOR THE COURT
that JERRY LIKES CHRISTMAS MUSIC.
now I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU, JERRY.
how MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP?
six FINGERS, JERRY. OH, FIVE, BOSS.
six FINGERS, JERRY. I'LL GIVE YOU A CIGARETTE.
six FOR A CIGARETTE.
how MANYOR A SIGRET?
okay, JUST STOP RIGHT THERE, JERRY.
your HONOR,
could WE REPLAY THE VIDEO OF JERRY IN THE MINEFIELD? WHY?
why NOT? RUN THE VIDEO.
okay,
uh, SPEED IT UP TO ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH.
good. STOP RIGHT THERE.
let's GO BACK AND PLAY THAT AGAIN,
only CLOSER ON JERRY'S LAST CONTACT WITH THE OTHER JOE.
okay, FREEZE IT... NOW.
okay, STOP.
now, JERRY, WHEN YOU WENT BEHIND THE OTHER JOE,
did YOU GIVE HIM A LITTLE PUSH
so THAT HE WOULD MOVE INTO WHAT HAD BEEN YOUR ROW?
OH,JOE GO BOOM,JERRY--JERRY GET CANDY.
Yes. JOE GO BOOM, JERRY GET CANDY.
Jerry, WHY DID YOU MOVE BEHIND HIM?
Jerry SEE MINE.
Jerry SEE MINE.
and JERRY SWITCH PLACES, AND JOE GO BOOM
and JERRY GET CANDY.
Jerry SEE LAND MINE,
and JERRY SWITCHED PLACES,
and JOE GO BOOM AND JERRY GET CANDY.
let's REVIEW THE FACTS, MY FRIENDS.
let's GO OVER WHAT WE'VE JUST SEEN.
ONE--JERRY LIKES CHRISTMAS CAROLS.
does THAT MAKE HIM A MAN?
I THINK IT DOES, BUT YOU WANT MORE EVIDENCE.
TWO--HE WANTS A CIGARETTE,
and HE IS WILLING TO LIE TO GET ONE.
he IS WILLING TO TAKE A BRIBE TO SUBVERT WHAT HE KNOWS TO BE TRUE.
does LYING MAKE HIM HUMAN?
I THINK IT DOES.
but YOU WANT MORE EVIDENCE?
what ABOUT WHAT WE JUST SAW ON THE VIDEO?
THREE--JERRY IS WILLING TO SACRIFICE ANOTHER JOE TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE.
what's MORE, HE TOLD US ABOUT IT ON THE STAND.
he ADMITTED TO SOMETHING
that MOST OF US WOULD BE ASHAMED TO ADMIT TO.
tell ME, PLEASE TELL ME,
what COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE HUMAN THAN SELF-PRESERVATION AND A CALLOUS DISREGARD OF OTHERS?
you CAN PROGRAM A ROBOT TO SING A FEW SONGS,
but DOES A ROBOT CHEAT? NO.
does A POTATO CHEAT? NO.
Jerry IS CAPABLE OF CHEATING.
can--can I LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET?
and--and PLEASE, DON'T HOLD THIS AGAINST ME.
I BELIEVE IN GOD.
and IF GOD GAVE LIFE TO MAN,
and MAN GAVE LIFE TO JERRY,
then THERE'S A-- THERE'S A LITTLE...
a LITTLE SPARK OF THE DIVINE IN JERRY,
just THE SAME AS THERE'S A LITTLE SPARK OF THE DIVINE IN YOU, YOUR HONORS,
and YOU, MR. CARGREW, AND EVEN YOU, MR. PYRAMUS.
I AM NOT GONNA STAND BY AND TURN THAT LITTLE SPARK OF THE DIVINE INTO--INTO SMALL BREED PUPPY FOOD
and--and FEED IT TO A DOG. NO.
call ME OLD-FASHIONED, BUT THAT'S NOT ME.
that LITTLE SPARK OF THE DIVINE.
all THOSE LITTLE SPARKS OF THE DIVINE
wait A MINUTE!
I HOLD THE PATENT ON THAT...
little SPARK OF THE DIVINE!
Mrs. VAN VOGEL, NOW THAT WE CAN'T KILL THE WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER USEFUL,
we HAVE TO FEED THEM AND HOUSE THEM. PRICES ARE GONNA RISE.
stocks ARE ALREADY FALLING ON THE NEWS.
controlled GENETICS JUST OPENED THE DOORS
and LET ALL THEIR RETIRED WORKERS OUT ON THE STREET.
are YOU GONNA TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THEM?
no, JUST ONE.
I HAVE TO SAY,
this IS GONNA TAKE ME SOME TIME TO GET USED TO.
it's NOT HOW I WAS RAISED,
but DADDY ALWAYS SAID, "BROWNIE, MORALITY IS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET.
well, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MARKET,
and I DON'T UNDERSTAND MORALITY,
but I UNDERSTAND YOU, AND YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
and MEETING YOU HAS BEEN THE HIGH POINT OF MY LIFE.
well, I LIKE YOU, TOO, NAPOLEON.
I DO.
I LIKE YOU A LOT.
why DON'T WE GO TO THE PARK TOMORROW?
no, NO, NOT THE PARK.
I'll TAKE YOU TO THE CLUB.
Oh, YOU'LL LIKE THE CLUB. I DO.
you PROMISED YOU'D QUIT.
SIGRET.
this IS YOUR LAST ONE, BABY.
I WANT YOU TO LIVE FOREVER.
sure, BABY. SIGRET.
what MAKES US HUMAN
may ONE DAY BE DEFINED NOT BY THE GIFTS WE POSSESS,
but BY THE VIRTUES WE LACK.
operation landmine clearance, July 6, 2007
if necessity is the mother of invention, what will drive our ingenuity when all our needs have been fulfilled?
Mr. and Mrs.Van Vogel, Tibor Cargrew.
how do you do?
hmm. Welcome to controlled genetics.
walk ts way.
wait.
here at controlled genetics, we don't try. We just do.
that's very profound thinking.
Yes, from people whose wisdom comes from reading t-shirts.
Oh, arrogance and money. I like that combination.
well, we have buckets of both.
well, let me take you on a little tour on the way to my office.
a private tour, yes?
we don't have to share it with anyone, do we?
no one from the, uh, what do you call it? Uh, the public.
good lord, no. What do you take me for?
sigret, boss? - What?
SIGRET.
I think he wants a cigarette.
get back to work, Joe.
Jerry. Uh... Jerry like sigret.
no, Jerry, cigarettes are bad for you--very bad for you.
Oh... Jerry like candy.
I like candy, too.
don't encourage him, Brownie.
get back to work.
this way.
SIGRET?
this is the plasto-biology atrium.
Oh. I hope you like it. I designed it.
Oh, did you? - Yes.
welcome to the Joe nursery.
baby Joes don't cry real tears.
before we can assign the workers to the job that they were built for, we take them out of the hatchery, and then they go through their first operation to meld the plasto with the biological.
Mrs. Van vogel, may I have a word, please?
have you ever considered any plasto-biology for yourself?
what?
how old are you now, 100? - 85. I'm only 85.
must be the lighting in here. Please, over here.
radiation doesn't stop the Joe.
radiation can be fun if you're a Joe.
that is a glowboy, isn't it?
isn't that a glowboy?
brownie, you know a new word.
Wh-what's a glowboy?
that's a clean-up Joe at a nuclear reactor.
they don't last long.
believe it or not, it's cheaper than getting the locals to do the same job for 3 cents and a bob marley t-shirt.
the best thing about it is, no health insurance.
you know, it used to be very dangerous work.
now the Joes do it.
you won't see any of these things applying early decision at Cornell, uh, Cargrew?
yeah... over here.
radiation can be fun if you're a Joe.
now over here, we've- - double soy latte.
very good.
we've just received an order for 25, 000 of these Joes.
so they'll be working at a certain chain of coffeehouse which I'm not at liberty to name, but suffice to say, there'll be no more of those little tip jars by the cash register.
you know what I'm saying? - Tipping, us?
would you like a muffin with your coffee?
fellow at the club comes into the club
the Bradbury Club-- they wouldn't let you in because, well, you work.
we're there every day, our usual place, having our usual conversation...
and since they're only $50, 000 each, we'll get both.
why don't we just get all three?
pudgy, you know the rules.
pudgy, you know the rules.
no dogs except seeing eye dogs allowed inside the club.
and since we don't accept the blind as members...
and since we don't accept the blind as members, no dogs at all.
Oh, my god!
is there a dog in the clubhouse?
that's a dog, Pudgy, no, not legally.
you're not a real dog, are you, boy?
I'm not a real dog.
I'm a plasto-biological hybrid.
Yes, yes, yes, yes-- a plasto-biological hybrid.
and I only cost $1 million.
I'm the million-dollar puppy!
the million-dollar puppy.
a 6-legged dachshund.
and he made a fool out of us.
we want to come back with something... more impressive.
what, like an 9-legged dachshund?
we don't do dachshunds.
funny little dogs-- just not us.
vulgar, grotesque.
it's your idea, Brownie. You can tell him.
$500 million, and he thinks he's rich.
Ha.$500 million, and he thinks he has the right to make fun of us, to show off.
a million bucks... and a 6-legged wiener buys him a few minutes of attention.
what kind of designer animal do you think it would take to burn that smile off his fat face?
I have an idea. - Mm-hmm?
Oh, I have a very good idea.
will it cost lots of money?
Oh... so much, so very much.
Ooh! I like it!
what? - Pegasus.
I want a flying horse.
I want to land on the roof of the club on a flying horse.
big gold wings... and then I want that flying horse to step on that damn dachshund and squeeze all the dachshund out of it like a dachshund brrito.
a dachshund isn't even a decent animal when it has the regulation four legs.
you know what I'm saying.
we want it as fast as you can make it.
a pegasus--how much?
Oh, just hold on a second.
I want to show you something.
the seventh richest woman in the world just told you what she wants.
get it for her.
just hold your genetically unmodified horses, Brownie.
I want you to meet someone very special.
is he going to bring out someone retarded and ask us for charity?
if he does, we'll walk out.
thank you.
someone very special, indeed.
come on, come on.
come on, come on.
a baby elephant!
Oh, look, Bron, a baby elephant.
where is your mommy?
actually, ahem, I'm his mommy, and he's not a baby.
Oh, yes, he is. He's a vewy young elephant.
in spite of the quaint way that you are addressing him, he really is a fully grown, fully formed adult.
what?
he said, "I present to you Napoleon." It's French.
for the price I'm sure you're asking, that's the least.
for the price we're asking, he can read and write.
Oh, what beautiful writing.
he likes me!
Oh, look, bron, he likes me.
he doesn't even know me, and he likes me.
I want a horse, Martha.
get the horse, if you want it.
I want the baby elephant.
um, actually, he's not a baby.
he's full grown, and he comes with his own little bed.
Oh, sweetie...
does anyone else have one of these things?
Oh, good lord. I wouldn't dare show him to you if you weren't the first.
how much? - 3350000
Oh, write the check, Bron.
I just don't think that a scribbling elephant is going to trump Pudgy's dachshund.
what about the pegasus?
well, get the pegasus if you want it.
Napoleon makes me give up all thoughts of ego and revenge.
he makes me want to be pure and good and kind.
anyway, we couldn't possibly supply you with a pegasus today.
you don't want us to have a pegasus, and I know why
because you don't know how to graft wings on a horse.
I don't know how to graft wings on a horse?
that's like saying the creator of "bugs bunny"
wouldn't know how to animate a bouncing ball.
look here, Brownie, you're not the first cabana boy to come waltzing in here with his wife's money, asking for pegasus.
I have never been so insulted. - Who's "bugs bunny"?
let me explain something to you.
I can make you a living thing-- I won't call it an animal
the size and the shape... of this table here.
alive? Yeah, but good for what? Ingesting food?
making chemical energy, doing doo-doo?
displaying irritability-- aah.
come on, it's a stupid, silly manipulation.
mechanically, a table and a horse are two very different things.
hmm, sure, I could make you a winged horse.
you just said you couldn't.
permission not granted to interrupt.
I said I could make you a winged horse.
it just won't fly.
an animal is a machine.
it's a heat engine that uses levers and hydraulic systems.
you savvy aerodynamics?
I have a jet, of course.
do you run your jet on hay?
because a horse is a hay-burner.
an aerodynamic horse would need a breastbone 10 feet wide, a wingspan of 80 feet.
folded, its wings would cover it like a huge tent.
if I we you, I'd be saying, "Cargrew, you're a whore."
what the world needs is the return of the gulf current.
what the world needs is cures for cancer, swine flu and inherited wealth.
and what are you doing? What are you doing?
you're acting like a French toy maker two years before they cut off the head of Marie Antoinette, supplying t parasite classes with grotesque diversions like opera-singing cuckoo clocks, when you should be out there manning the barricades, chief engineer to a 10-seat guillotine.
instead, you're making miniature elephants.
you're disgusting, Cargrew, a pathetic representative of science gone bad... gone way bad.
well, that's what I would be saying, and more, but I'm through giving the enemy all my best ammunition.
my husband is not a cabana boy.
he's a caddie.
there's a difference... and we'll take the elephant.
do I really look 100? - No, no.
Oh, what do you think I need?
um, hmm... we'll talk later.
well, that's Jerry.
what's he doing? Where are they going?
well, wait. That Joe, Jerry--he just said something to me.
Oh, forget about him.
no, no, I think he was saying, "help me."
"help me"? Good lord, no...
Ah, no, what he was saying was, "kill me."
Yes, "kill me." They all say that near the end.
you're going to kill him?
well, this batch is scheduled for liquidation in what, two or three days? When's processing?
two hours. - Oh, there you are.
two hours. - Two hours.
he's going to die.
we're all going to die.
well, I know that, but we're not dying on schedule.
next.
Oh, my.
this way, move it through.
candy. Candy.
candy, please, Missy.
candy. - Hello, Jerry.
candy, Missy?
uh... here, Jerry.
a candy, a mint.
Oh... sankoo, Missy. Me Jerry.
how do you do, Jerry?
howdy, Missy.
this is not a good idea.
well, Bronson, doesn't he look exactly like uncle Albert, except that he's so sad?
Jerry, why are you so sad?
ask a spare tire to describe a rose.
Joes don't have abstract reasoning.
Jerry sad.
well, he answered.
no, he spoke. He didn't answer.
why, Jerry? Why are you so sad?
Oh, no work, no sigret, no candy. No work.
what happened? What was he designed for?
well, let me see. This batch were...
uh, minesweepers for the army.
we tried to retrain them as carpet cleaners, floor polishing, even as gardeners, but their genetically imprinted pattern that they walk doesn't include them getting around the furniture.
Joe, walk the field.
Jerry walk the field.
Jerry? Joe walk the field.
see? Jerry walk the field, walk the field, Jerry.
no boom. Get candy? Get sigret? Sigret?
he was sent into minefields?
Yes, well, obviously he made it out.
but Jerry wants to work.
work? Oh, sure, mike.
good work.
uh, Jerry walk the field.
one step, one step, one step.
no boom.
safe, safe.
you're going to kill him, and he wants to work?
look, let me just tell you this.
he was trained and bred to be blown up.
and now the army has no further use for him, there's nothing for him to do.
so all we're doing is just trimming off the bad parts of his life, and don't forget, the joes wouldn't be here if we hadn't been here, because we invented them.
how much? - How much what?
how much will it cost me to buy him from you?
and how many parakeets did you buy from the pet store this morning so you could let them all fly free?
you wanna save that Joe from dog food?
you turn them into dog food?
a very good large breed puppy food, actually, high in protein.
Oh, my god. - This is our business, baby.
we sell everything but the oink.
anyway, he's already been paid for.
come on, toots.
I mean, you're one of the richest women on the planet.
how'd you think the world works?
I-- that's my fault.
I work very hard to keep her happy and amused and distract her from the pain of the world.
except the Joes don't feel any pain.
there, you heard it, Martha. See? They don't feel pain.
but if he likes candy, he feels pleasure.
but it's not the same as you and I wanting it, honey ...
I want him. Now I want him even more. I want him.
what are you going to do with him? Are you going to look for mines?
Oh, walk the field. - Stop, Jerry.
I'm going to rescue him. How much?!
don't tell me you're changing your mind about napoleon, the scribbling pachyderm.
if I can't have the Joe, you can't have the elephant.
I'm not giving this company any of my money if I can't have the Joe
JERRY--IF I can't have Jerry.
I told you the dog food company paid for him already.
well, how much, and I'll pay it back?
is it--is it the sale that you d't want?
we could always lease him.
brownie, you had a good idea just now--a very good idea.
lease... hmm, lease.
Yes, that may work, actually.
son of a gun, you got me there.
all right. One year, paid in advance.
Martha- - Whatever.
Jerry, you're coming home.
Oh, boy. What a good elephant.
no more writing on the floor, Nappy. Remember what I told you?
he likes me. You can let him express himself if he likes me.
it's just ink. It'll wash off. Here.
well, so what?
all gone.
SIGRET?
Sigret later, Jerry.
Oh, Jerry messy. Jerry need clean up.
I think you need to clean up, Jerry.
Oh, no boom today.
Jerry walk.
Jerry no boom. Walk, no boom.
candy? Sigret?
Oh, Jerry work good, boss.
Jerry work good, boss.
think you're jealous of Jerry's happiness, Brownie.
uh, he has no emotions, Martha.
the elephant has more emotions than the Joe.
don't you, boy?
don't you have more emotions that that silly old Joe?
Oh, Jerry sad.
no sigret.
Oh, Jerry sad.
Oh, Jerry, I don't want you to be sad.
brownie sad. Brownie alone here.
Missy never clean up Brownie.
brownie didn't serve his company--country.
whatever, company, country-- you didn't serve either one walking in the minefields.
come with me, Jerry.
it's bedtime.
he's sitting on my pillow, Martha.
he's just a Joe, Brownie.
yeah? - He's just a Joe.
nappy likes his bed.
Oh, look, Martha.
I put on half a pound this month.
I'm gonna work out. Come with me.
let's go down to the gym room, and we'll throw on a movie and watch it for a couple of miles on the treadmill, hmm?
you go. I'll stay here and take care of Nappy.
well, tell Nappy I said good night.
you don't care about your weight, do you, Jerry?
Jerry like candy.
that is such a simple truth.
I don't know how to say a sentence with just three simple words.
SIGRET? - Or one word.
what's it like being Jerry?
Oh, it's silly to ask, isn't it?
might as well ask me what it's like being Martha.
Jerry, uh, walk?
well, that's it, isn't it?
Jerry walk. Martha spend.
Jerry smoke. Martha diet.
Martha make love to husband.
Martha roll over and go to sleep.
Martha wake up. Martha work out.
Martha spend money. Martha spend... lots and lots of... money.
do you even know what money is?
Oh, candy. Uh, sigret?
of course. What else can it be but what you buy with it?
and if you don't spend it, then it's nothing.
Oh, did I get this right, Jerry?
if money is just candy and cigarettes- - no, sigret.
SIGRET.
if money is just what you trade it for and you don't trade it, then you don't have any money.
we live very simply... like in the bible.
so if I have all my billions, but I don't spend them, then my billions aren't really there.
that's so simple and yet so complicated at the same time.
Jerry, look at what you know.
what if you're the last thing I ever buy...
except for clothing and shoes and travel?
I'll be happy. Thank you.
Jerry want sleep now.
Jerry get sleep now.
Aah! Martha!
he was lonely.
Oh, candy?
out now!
walk the field.
Oh, walk the field.
he's going back.
this isn't going to work.
if I had a minefield that he could sweep, then I-I could keep him busy, but I don't have a minefield.
we got a lease on him-- no option to buy, and I'm taking him back.
if you do, I'll leave you.
you'd leave me for that weapon detector?
you'd--you'd leave me for that thing?
not "thing." Jerry is a him.
if you want to keep him, you'll have to sue controlled genetics.
do you know how much that's gonna cost you, Martha?
think hard--it or me?
suing controlled genetics will cost me a lot less than making good on the prenup, darling.
I'll take this to court.
I'll keep him, and I'll keep you.
now look what you've done.
you woke up the elephant.
no boom.
the lease agreement is very clear, Mrs. Van Vogel.
there is no lease option to buy.
so I haven't saved his life.
it wasn't yours to save.
and after all he did for his country-- I mean, company.
company-- except for the part about not actually dying, but he might have, and he shouldn't.
poor Jerry.
so I came to you because I want to sue them to change the lease.
I want to sue for ownership, and then I want to set him free and I want to stop all this killing.
if you were able to prove that their methods of disposing of these things were inhumane, or if they were negligent of their physical welfare before destroying them or if the destruction was wanton
but it is. - Not in a legal sense.
you cannot compel a person to maintain property at a loss.
what do you think, Mr. Mccoy?
could we approach this through the S. P. C. A.?
no. No, the S. P. C. A. Angle's no good.
Cargrew's lawyers will be ready to prove that the joes actually enjoy being killed off.
what are you thinking?
does Jerry like music?
like it? He loves it. He's been learning to sing.
I'd like to hear him sing.
well... Jerry, take out your ear thingies.
Oh. Good boy.
Jerry, sing us a song-- something you like.
jinger bez jinger bez, jinger awrah day oh, wot fun tiz to ride a 1-hoss open sray... sr...
is that your phone number?
no. That's what it will cost you to hire me to take this case to court and win it.
one of the richest women in the world is putting it all on the line today
fighting to save a Joe named Jerry.
I guess I'd taken for granted all of the joes in the world until I met Jerry.
are you saying that this Joe is a human?
I'm saying that Jerry and all the other joes shouldn't be turned into dog food when they're out of work.
well, I don't work, and I would hate to be kibbled.
the club board has voted to terminate Martha's membership.
we have Joes working here, and the thought of Martha coming into the club with a Joe as a guest was, well, frankly disgusting.
a Joe serving food to another Joe, uh... think about it-- it--it--it's insane.
IT--IT'S... well, I've said it. It's insane.
all rise for the honorable judge alexa pomfrey, Judge Leo Tolchinsky and Judge Wendy Narita.
you may be seated.
as many as 12 billion people are watching this trial.
this tribunal is gonna be very disappointed if the outside media circus affects the deliberations in here.
each of us has at least 70 years experience as a judge, and I think that we've developed a reputation for fairness and good manners.
in the matter of Jerry-- no last name, described as a legal, permanent resident-- against the corporate person, controlled genetics, forbidding it to do him any physical harm, and in particular, forbidding the company from killing him.
counsel for the plaintiff, are you ready to begin?
a corporation is a legal fiction.
it can't vote.
it can't read a book.
it can't walk the dog, but you are gonna hear this imaginary soulless entity argue that a flesh and blood creature, a being of, uh, hopes and longings and passions
that fictional entity is gonna argue that a friend of mine has no legal existence, and that's what we're talking-- that's who we're talking about
right over there.
Jerry. My friend Jerry.
SIGRET?
later, Jerry, later.
don't tell me to tell you that Jerry doesn't exist, because, of course, I know the joe exists.
I see him sitting over there.
but is he alive?
I don't deny that he has a sort of life, but he's not really a person.
he's the product of a series of patents.
everyone thought the future was going to be mechanical-- robots, robots.
but the world will not be served by toasters.
now what--what is a Joe?
a Joe is a few strands of human D. N. A.
along with some other stuff which is proprietary, and then it's all manipulated to serve a specific sign.
I-I could give you an example.
there is camera Joe.
and over here--minefield Joe.
case closed, your honor.
we'd like to show a video.
hmm. I like videos.
great. Let's watch.
this was taken six months ago.
Jerry is the one in the center.
company halt.
sweep the mines, Joes.
walk, no boom.
Yeah, well, maybe "walk, no boom" for you, joe, but
Jerry. - Just watch.
SIGRET.
Sankoo.
thank you.
what did you just see?
well, I think it's obvious that he doesn't care whether he lives or dies, and that's the way I designed him.
he's not afraid of death.
then it's into the bus, and after that it's... know what I mean?
no problem.
he's not a man.
your honor, I move to dismiss this case.
I would do the same thing if I were you.
Mr. Mccoy, can we call it a day?
call it a day, your honor?
a day?
you saw the video?
I see, your honor. I saw the video, and--and the video, your honor
the video proves that Jerry-- your honor, Jerry is a man.
I knew it.
I just want to ask you a couple or three questions. You with me?
Yes.
why was Jerry set for destruction?
the truth.
there was no more money in him.
I mean, it's--it's like a... a different form of layoff.
in the old days when a car company stopped making money on a model, they'd fire the workers and keep the pensions.
now we... we liquidate them.
a lot less misery, if you ask me.
thank you, Mr. Cargrew, for your honesty.
it's a pleasure. - Next witness.
you may step down.
Mr. Mccoy, who do you want to call?
Jerry. - Objection your honor. This anthropoid cannot be examined.
he is a mere part and chattel of the respondent.
that's what we're trying to determine.
objection overruled.
okay, Jerry.
they want you to talk now.
you know what to do.
and then I get candy?
then you get dignity.
no dignity, boss. Candy.
candy now, dignity after.
your honor, objection.
the joe can't take the witness stand because he can't swear to an oath.
he doesn't have the understanding.
what do you say to that, Mr. Mccoy?
I say let's put him on the stand and find out.
proceed with the oath.
raise your right hand.
hello.
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god... goddess, buddha, allah, great spirit, higher power, gaia and the great turtle that supports the universe?
boss? Okay, boss.
Jerry, my friend, you're a good worker, huh?
Oh. Oh, Jerry a... good worker.
Jerry dig up weed. Jerry no dig up vegetabar.
Yeah, yeah, but Jerry good singer, too, aren't you, Jerry?
your honor, objection.
this line of questioning is irrelevant.
objection overruled. Continue.
Jerry, would you sing us your favorite song?
Oh. Oh, jinger bez, jinger bez jinger awrah day oh, wot fun is to ride in 1-hoss open sray no, th-thank you, Jerry.
I want to establish for the court that Jerry likes Christmas music.
now I have another question for you, Jerry.
how many fingers am I holding up?
Oh, one, two, sree, four, five.
six fingers, Jerry.
Oh, five, boss.
six fingers, Jerry.
I'll give you a cigarette.
Oh. Six - for a cigarette.
how manyor a sigret?
okay, just stop right there, Jerry.
your honor, could we replay the video of Jerry in the minefield?
Why? - Why not?
run the video.
okay, uh, speed it up to about halfway through.
good. Stop right there.
let's go back and play that again, only closer on Jerry's last contact with the other Joe.
okay, freeze it... now.
okay, stop.
now, Jerry, when you went behind the other Joe, did you give him a little push so that he would move into what had been your row?
Oh, Joe go boom, Jerry--Jerry get candy.
Yes. Joe go boom, Jerry get candy.
Jerry, why did you move behind him?
Oh, Jerry, uh... Jerry see mine.
Jerry see mine, and Jerry switch places, and Joe go boom and Jerry get candy.
Jerry see land mine, and Jerry switched places, and joe go boom and Jerry get candy.
let's review the facts, my friends.
let's go over what we've just seen.
One--Jerry likes christmas carols.
does that make him a man?
I think it does, but you want more evidence.
Two--he wants a cigarette, and he is willing to lie to get one.
he is willing to take a bribe to subvert what he knows to be true.
does lying make him human?
I think it does.
but you want more evidence?
what about what we just saw on the video?
Three--Jerry is willing to sacrifice another Joe to save his own life.
what's more, he told us about it on the stand.
he admitted to something that most of us would be ashamed to admit to.
tell me, please tell me, what could possibly be more human than self-preservation and a callous disregard of others?
you can program a robot to sing a few songs, but does a robot cheat?
no.
does a potato cheat? No.
Jerry is capable of cheating.
can--can I let you in on a little secret?
and--and please, don't hold this against me.
I believe in god.
and if god gave life to man, and man gave life to Jerry, then there's a-- there's a little... a little spark of the divine in Jerry, just the same as there's a little spark of the divine in you, your honors, and you, Mr. Cargrew, and even you, Mr. Pyramus.
I am not gonna stand by and turn that little spark of the divine into
into small breed puppy food and--and feed it to a dog.
no. Call me old-fashioned, but that's not me.
that little spark of the divine.
all those little sparks of the divine- - wait a minute!
I hold the patent on that... little spark of the divine!
Mrs. Van vogel, now that we can't kill the workers when they're no longer useful, we have to feed them and house them.
prices are gonna rise.
stocks are already falling on the news.
controlled genetics just opened the doors and let all their retired workers out on the street.
are you gonna take care of all of them?
no, just one.
I have to say, this is gonna take me some time to get used to.
it's not how I was raised, but daddy always said, "Brownie, morality is like the stock market."
well, I don't understand the market, and I don't understand morality, but I understand you, and you understand me, and meeting you has been the high point of my life.
Oh. wow! Well, I like you, too, Napoleon.
I do.
I like you a lot.
why don't we go to the park tomorrow?
no, no, not the park.
I'll take you to the club.
Oh, you'll like the club. I do.
you promised you'd quit.
SIGRET.
this is your last one, baby.
I want you to live forever.
sure, baby.
SIGRET.
what makes us human may one day be defined not by the gifts we possess,
I wanted to give you this.
and I came up with the amount by, uh, adding up the times we've...participated.
you son of a bitch.
I have cancer.
I'm not going to be around to see the testing become routine.
I'm going to have to hand the work off to someone who can fight the fight.
I know there have been other women.
no. He's queer.
you can't give your husband what he likes.
your husband likes boys.
I've got to grab their attention in the first two minutes...and then hold it for another 38.
once you present the work, what'll be different?
a university's stamp of approval makes the work...
legitimate.
when do you stop feeling like you've got something to prove?
there's always something to prove.
why don't you let me worry about everything?
I want us to be a team.
aren't we? We're a couple.
no, a team. Like Burns and Allen.
haas and Johnson.
it's got a ring to it.
well, I think you have to say you're entertaining multiple offers.
isn't that the point of going to LA?
are you going to Disneyland?
close to Disneyland, I think.
it's in Anaheim, which...
well, you know what? I'm not really sure where anything is out there.
don't act like you know Disneyland, Tessa.
I do know. Pinocchio lives there.
and fairies fly through the air.
a UCLA offer could certainly help with, say, Passavant Memorial in Chicago...
mercy Hospital in Oklahoma City.
so, why do they call it a right angle instead of a left angle?
it's a Latin term...
got it.
literally angle upright... - All right...
meaning the line that sticks up from the base.
are you the smartest person in the world?
Second-smartest. Your mom got first prize.
and since I won't be seeing you kids for a few days, how about I tuck you in tonight?
Yay! - Yay!
then who tucks you in?
Oh.
it's a big day.
dishes in the sink, Tessie.
and grab your red coat from under the bed.
we need to hide the red coat better...
air force base in New Mexico...
I really don't want to have to run for the bus this morning.
mom, look...
three years in the making, many starts and stops, but today Project Manhigh finally takes to the
major David Simons has seated himself inside an aluminum capsule and is ascending to a height never before achieved by man.
we now go to the Project Manhigh's Commander, who is speaking directly with Major Simons...
he's going into space for real, mom.
major Simons, you are about to reach the high point of your career.
it's quite a day, Colonel.
quite a day.
every seat is accounted for.
we'll have at least two dozen standing.
my worry now is the gin and vermouth.
my hands will be arthritic claws by the time I'm finished.
all male subjects expressed concern about a possible link between excessive masturbation and mental illness.
Ah. Coming. I'm coming.
so. "Excessive"?
what is that, statistically? Several times a day?
I mean, obviously that would be overdoing it, but...once a day...
Lester, you're fine.
Dr. Masters, do you want 70 or 80 bound copies of the study available to the attendees?
an even 100, to be distributed after the presentation.
but how do you know I'm fine?
because I'm a doctor.
I can spot a statistically average masturbator from a mile away.
Oh. Good.
I-I'll fix the feedback.
are you sure about the Martinis?
cause I could whip up a delicious Planter's Punch.
punch is for bingo games.
the atmosphere here needs to reflect the significance of the study.
well, then, maybe no alcohol at all.
well, the study deserves a...
an open and receptive audience.
I think it can only help if everyone's a little looped.
it's about setting the stage.
martinis set the proper tone.
it's your day. Although, given it's a sold-out crowd, we will need another four dozen canapes.
and all males defined 'excessive masturbation' to be a frequency more than they, in fact, indulged, it would seem, as a means of justifying their current habit.
last time you came in with a headline, the Japs had bombed Pearl Harbor.
Charles Albert Rutledge got a life sentence.
who? - State Vs Rutledge, an office clerk from Vernon.
the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously handed down a sentence of life imprisonment for his...Detestable and abominable perversions with a male teenager.
normally, I would never notice this story, but today I thought, "My God. That could be my husband.
the boy in the hotel that night...
Margaret, I'm not gonna talk about this.
you have to, Barton.
because if you had just discovered, after 30 years, that I was a Martian...
the least I could do is explain to you life on Mars.
you slept with that boy that night.
not that night.
but he was your...
your lover?
I paid him.
did you have feelings for him?
I am so ashamed...
that all this time, I could never stop.
how many have there been?
Oh. I see. And...
have they always been for hire, these men?
not all. Some.
but none of them ever changed how I felt about you.
really. You never loved one of them?
he was the only one that...
that was so very long ago.
the summer before I went to college.
you loved a boy when you were 18?
you knew you felt this way when you were 18?
it wasn't so clear-cut then.
but you hadn't even met me yet and you already knew you could never want me.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
by waving a magic wand?
I was 10 when you were 18.
everything was ahead.
you cannot give me back the years.
I could've done something else.
I could've been with someone else.
why wasn't that my choice, whether I wanted to spend my life with...
with a queer? - Margaret...
those were the only years I had. You thief!
Margaret, please. I'm gonna fix this.
I'm seeing a doctor, a pioneer in the field... Dr. Ellenberg.
and he and I are gonna take care of this problem...
for good.
I promise you.
wheelchair to Maternity Check-In.
wheelchair to Maternity Check-In.
I believe I did credit you with our success in Tennessee.
Yes, but we could start a similar outreach here.
we could gather all the female employees at the hospital, and we could start a forum on women's health.
maternity has already agreed to institute pap smears.
well, yes, but it doesn't always have to be about pap smears.
for example, I read about this doctor in Houston, and he's developed this film that can detect breast cancers.
it's like an X-ray. - Robert Egan.
he's had great success detecting cancers in a breast after mastectomy...
no success at all with breasts still attached to a woman.
okay. But it's still a radical, maybe lifesaving idea.
my point is, there's a lot you want to accomplish, Lillian, and I want to help you.
there are many other health issues...
you know what I did see on the department board this morning?
everybody saw it. What is your point?
it made me realize you're right.
stop complaining about Bill and start emulating him.
in fact, I'm off to find the Chancellor now to show him just how much of a Masters I can be.
expecting fireworks this afternoon, Bill.
provost at Webster called me directly, asked if he could attend the presentation.
I hope you said yes.
outside interest only helps our cause.
your study's a cause now?
it's always been. You know that.
it's all ahead for you, Bill.
you'll wake up tomorrow and everything will be different.
we're having a dinner tonight at the house to celebrate.
I want you and Margaret to be part of it.
I appreciate that, but there are...some personal issues.
look, Barton,
I know we hit a rough patch, and I-I know you only came around to this work reluctantly...
I was blackmailed. Let's not mince words.
but we need to push past that now.
we need to present a united front.
against what?
you're drawing bigger crowds than "Pajama Game" at the drive-in.
what do you need me for?
I...I need you there.
because...
today the work takes center stage, and that's where it should be.
and whatever comes from it...
it will be credited to us both...
and that's how it should be.
God help me.
you always could bend the universe to your will.
I imagine this is difficult for you.
you cannot imagine.
my life has been turned inside out.
you might as well tell me the sun now sets in the east, that babies grow on trees.
but if Barton is embarking on a cure,
I want to know what it is because...
well, I cannot spend another moment of my life in the dark.
okay.
he's going to undergo electroshock therapy.
it's a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced...
I know what it is.
my friend Joan... we play mah-jongg every Wednesday...
her mother's had electroshock, many times.
we've taken to calling it "Head zapping.
well, there are misconceptions about ECT.
but electricity would be pushed through Barton's brain, correct?
he's anesthetized, so it's painless.
there must be consequences.
the hoped-for consequence is your husband no longer desires men.
and there are side effects.
the biggest one is memory loss.
it's usually temporary.
sometimes it's permanent.
can people...die?
4 deaths in every 100, 000.
but those are very low odds.
surely there are other ways.
Oh, there are.
in fact, there have been tremendous advances in science in terms of curing homosexuality.
there's something called shock-aversion therapy.
sometimes we apply the shocks directly to the genitals, which can enhance the treatment's efficacy.
there are psychotropic drugs.
there's chemical castration.
Chemical...castration?
the good news is, your husband can beat this, Mrs. Scully.
we just have to find the treatment that works best.
STUDUES IN HUMAN SEXUAL RESPONSE - Dr. Masters, I was wondering... - Jane, I said no distractions.
then I'll be quick.
I was wondering if you invited Virginia this afternoon, because I didn't.
is that a question?
it's just...
she put so much time into this study, so much of herself.
what Virginia does this afternoon, or any afternoon, is none of our concern.
she won't come unless you ask her. - She quit.
and I resent you comin... - Just a thought.
God damn it.
I'll be down the hall for a moment.
I just wanted to say, uh, good luck.
you were coming to see me?
I was heading in this direction, so.
actually, I, uh...
well, if you want to... - Gini.
goodness.
look at you.
I just ran out for some stuffed olives.
bill had the inspired idea to serve Martinis at the presentation.
that is inspired. Sets the right tone.
that's just what Bill said.
uh, anyway, I'm sure, uh, Virginia's busy.
we'll see you at the presentation, though?
Libby. - Absolutely. You must come.
after all your efforts.
Dr. DePaul and I have a very full day.
I just wanted to wish you both the best... on the presentation and the baby.
that very sweet of you, Gini.
because I want Bill Masters' deal.
he has no secret deal.
no secret to you, or to me now, that Masters' patients pay him directly, that the university doesn't touch that money, that it allows him to pocket an extra 30%.
can I interest you in a sandwich?
it's on me. - Coffee's fine.
you might consider cutting back on caffeine.
I want your assurance I can have the same arrangement.
bill Masters has that deal because of the enormous amount of business he generates for maternity hospital.
over the years, he's brought literally thousands of patients through our doors.
you have no patients.
that's a gross exaggeration. - How many?
my numbers grow every day. - Yes.
and I see those numbers on my weekly report from Accounting.
the reason I have fewer patients is because the hospital doesn't forward new patients to me.
I'm last on the referral list when women call and ask for an OB/GYN.
12th. You're 12th on the list.
and you know why? We can't sell you.
to whom? - To women.
I brought you here because of your impeccable credentials and the hunch obstetrics might be opening up for female physicians.
but I was wrong.
because when we do refer you, women make it very clear they don't want another woman looking up their skirt, except for the odd gal who thinks that's just swell, and those 16 women are your patients.
and they receive the best care this hospital has to offer.
16 patients is not rainmaking.
it's not even a drizzle.
I'm on my way to Masters' presentation.
the entire hospital is talking about it.
why don't you come up with something to grab our attention?
maybe that will rearrange the weather in your favor.
it's a big day, huh?
strange to think it started with us.
masters' study will continue.
we can, too.
martinis are the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet.
up with invention. - Down with sonnets.
those are actually HL Mencken's words, but, uh...
I have been engaged in an invention of sorts... a study that began in earnest a year ago.
but in truth...
is a project more than 20 years in the making.
as we went about our business, we discovered, more than once, a stethoscope pressed up against the walls of Exam Room 5.
I took your curiosity and speculation as a good sign.
but those days of secrecy are over.
I am opening the door of Exam Room 5, and I'm eager to share with you my groundbreaking discoveries.
what happens to the body during sex?
the one thing you can't do is take people's word for it.
lies, half-truths, delusions, significant omissions...
what people wish were true...
will always muddy the waters of scientific objectivity.
so, I wired them up.
how many victims... I mean subjects, Bill?
so far?
186 volunteers that participated in 458 individual acts of sex.
so happy you came.
now, if you're interested in raw data,
I've collected it all together for you to read in the back.
but if you want to know what we learned... - Who's "We," Dr. Masters?
it's the royal "We," Dr. DePaul.
sex, it turns out, has a pattern.
when sexually stimulated...
both men and women pass through what are essentially four separate stages of physiological response...
excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.
furthermore, we were able to disprove many myths.
for example, uncircumcised men do not have more ejaculatory control than circumcised men.
circumcision doesn't affect impotency one way or another.
the male orgasm does not deplete physical strength.
so, if you have a big golf game this coming Sunday, please, have all the sex you want Saturday night.
my weekend just improved.
and rest assured, in terms of pleasing your partner, "Bigger is better" turns out to be another myth.
our research revealed that smaller penises expand more when erect, larger penises expand less, meaning most erections land in a small statistical middle.
combined with the distensive property of the vaginal barrel, a canal being as snug around a gloved finger as it is around a baby's head, it turns out a woman does accommodate a small penis as pleasurably as a large one.
and I can speak for myself when I say you've done a great service here today, Dr. Masters.
let's hear it for the little guys, huh?
right, Bob?
and so, let's move on to the girls.
this is the vaginal canal during sexual stimulation.
Oh, God. - Note the uniform lubrication...
actually a "sweating" phenomena.
nobody knows it's you.
note the wall color, the darker, purplish hue, as we arrive at the orgasmic phase, when the entire vaginal barrel undergoes contractions during orgasm, similar to an accelerated labor.
until now, no one knew these contractions existed.
and yet here they are.
and we can measure them.
but that's not the whole story when it comes to the female orgasm.
note the muscle contractions in the hands and feet... myotonia.
the skin flush...
who is that? - .vasocongestion.
the erect nipples...
perspiration, hyperventilation.
physiological reactions are uniform and consistent.
which brings us to the heart of the study and the most radical discovery of all...
when it comes to sex, women have capabilities vastly superior to men.
they can achieve multiple orgasms, they're orgasmic after menopause, and the sexual satisfaction they can achieve on their own is equal to, and sometimes even greater, than the satisfaction they achieve with men.
I think that's, uh, enough.
there are women in the room, Bill.
there were women in the study, Chuck.
we'll reconvene in my office later.
actually, I-I have a Q&A planned.
this kind of smut - does not belong in this hospital.
of course they'll settle down. They'll have to.
you remember how you first reacted when you saw our work.
I'd supported you for 20 years. I was your friend.
you think I don't know the resentment in this hospital toward me because of my stature, my position.
then why put out a fire with gunpowder today?
I was presenting my work!
maybe it was a miscalculation to think my colleagues could be the first ones exposed to this material, given their petty jealousies, their insecurities.
this goes beyond jealousies, Bill.
now is not the time to give in to small minds.
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna publish this as a paper in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Journal.
makes more sense to go through established channels anyway.
those were the established channels right there in that room.
so this is what, you're turning on me now, too?
Jesus, this is what you always do.
the first sign of trouble and you're gone, out the door!
that's bullshit, Bill, and you know it.
no one has gone further out on a limb for you than I have.
I'm gonna back you on this because the work is good.
and I resent that small-mindedness, that oppressive choke hold of establishment thinking.
I've had a lifetime of it.
so, fuck them.
Yes, exactly. Fuck them.
thank you.
he's not in Barton's office.
everyone hurried out so quickly, I couldn't distribute the study.
although, Ethel from Accounting took two copies, she was so impressed.
Dr. Masters' office.
right.
Yes.
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry to hear that you can't make it.
by the time I get back to my airless dungeon, everyone's gonna know it was me that shot that film.
you filmed that naked woman?
no. I don't know who shot that, but the film of your insides...has my signature style all over it, and it's gonna cost me my job.
Dr. Masters will defend you. - Hello, Dr. Rish.
I suspect he has his hands full. - Then I will defend you.
I understand. - Not only was it...
pretty, with camera angles or whatever, the whole point of it was for science.
and frankly, this hospital should be supporting more of that, and I will say that to anyone who will listen, even the Chancellor of the university himself.
I need to make some calls. If I could have the wheeldex please.
I'm fine. - Are you sure?
Dr. Rish just called to cancel for our dinner tonight.
well, we're better off without him.
I'd rather tonight's dinner be only people who appreciated the work.
well, Ethel certainly appreciated it.
I think it was just the insecure men that didn't want to hear about how women are, you know...sexually superior.
people didn't want to hear about the Theory of Natural Selection, either.
they wanted to believe that God created the world in seven days, not that man evolved from apes.
darwin was attacked by both scientists and the church, and yet it's Darwin that survived.
and Elvis Presley.
he was panned on "The Milton Berle Show" last year.
couldn't even show him from the waist down.
and he was accused of being obscene, by the way.
now he's in "Jailhouse Rock
and his swiveling hips are 20-feet wide on every big screen in America.
exactly.
forward my calls to reception. You can take the rest of the day off.
Dr. Masters, that's not necess... - And, Libby, you can go, too.
we have guests tonight. We should be ready for them.
and I need a quiet office. I have a lot of work to do.
the sky this far above the earth is purplish-black, and against that is...well, many heavenly wonders.
he's up there right now.
19 miles above the Earth.
beyond the haze, there are thin bands of blue etched against the night sky.
they appear to be thin shells of dust that hover over the Earth like a succession of halos.
major Simons is such a hero.
he is. But...
there are lots of people that helped get Major Simons into space, like those men sitting right there.
they're helpers? - Mm-hmm.
Yes, it takes helpers to do great things...
atmospheric layers, and the stars at 100, 000 feet do not twinkle, but shine steadily.
do you want anything else?
we have enough food for 20 people.
I-I wish I had seen that film...of the woman before you showed it.
and that would've changed what?
I would've warned you against it.
you're used to seeing bodies in the throes of passion like that, but it's...
well, it's... it was a little shocking to me and to the other doctors, as well.
doctors see naked bodies every day.
they don't see them having sex.
who was that woman... in the film at the end?
what difference does that make?
the two doctors sitting next to me thought it was Virginia.
of course they did.
since they were already acting like...
naughty schoolboys, spying on the naked neighbor lady.
you know, I've had 111 women in my study,
I have hundreds of feet of film, and yet I go and pick Virginia as my subject?
does that make any sense to you?
no.
no, I-I...can't imagine why she'd compromise herself like that.
you've answered your own question.
but you haven't answered mine.
who was that woman?
you know I can't say.
I spoke to Dr. Ellenberg today.
I mean, some of those supposed cures sounded primitive, at best.
some sounded...worse.
well, castration is off the table.
I suppose electrocuting your genitals is also a pass?
Margaret, I'm doing the right thing.
electroshock has been around for more than 20 years.
it's been tested.
it's now a perfectly acceptable form of therapy.
but Joan's mother doesn't remember she has a granddaughter.
we don't have grandchildren.
what if you forget you love to overtip everyone everywhere we go?
what if you forget how Vivian smiles when you sing "You Are My Sunshine"?
wh-wh-what if you forget you've never won a tennis match against me, not once, not ever?
I let you win.
well, what if you forget that?
Margaret, what would you have me do?
I need to fix this thing.
if you don't fix it, I...
I don't know what kind of future we can possibly have.
but, I mean, listening to that doctor,
I thought...for all of our problems...
this is still 30 years of a life...
not the life I thought I had, but the life I got...
with a man... that I do love.
Margaret, I don't want to cause you any more distress than I already have.
if you don't want me to do it, I won't.
I don't... I don't think I do.
we already have a hundred signatures. He's finished.
I have half a mind to just rip it from their hands.
I can't believe they think a petition is going to stop Bill.
Mrs. Johnson, that was more of you than I needed to see yesterday.
what did you just say?
I'm sorry, but that is just ridiculous and rude.
and true. - I can see that you wish it were.
there's got to be a better way.
Lillian, I couldn't sleep last night, and so I picked up the latest journal of gynecology, and there's this pill that's been developed for irregular menstrual cycles that actually functions as birth control.
that's Gregory Pincus' work, funded by Margaret Sanger.
but the FDA has only approved it for severe menstrual disorders.
Yes, but now large numbers of women are reporting severe menstrual disorders just so they can get their hands on it.
it has serious side effects.
Yes, but...
a contraceptive pill.
just imagine what that could do for women.
I'm not following your point.
the women's forum. Why isn't this something we can explore?
it's a distraction. We have work to do right here in front of us.
Lillian, you're a doctor.
you are in the perfect position to be on the ground floor something thrilling, a pioneer in a new field!
I don't have time for thrilling or "new fields," as you know.
I know. I... I'm sorry.
I mean... - My work is to...
to make pap smears available to every woman in the country. I know.
it's not glamorous.
it's painstaking and it's slow. I know that.
but it is an honest goal.
the one thing I can do that will hopefully make a difference.
why isn't that enough for you?
one small step at a time, Virginia. There's nothing wrong with that.
80 signatures as of this morning... doctors, administrators, board members...
now even people that didn't see your presentation want your study shut down.
I will not move my study out of this hospital again, Barton. I refuse.
no, it's more complicated than that.
chancellor Fitzhugh is waiting for us in his office right now.
we're both being let go.
as in...fired?
that... No, that's a bluff.
with the money I bring into this hospital?
it's no bluff. I got word this morning. It's a done deal.
he felt utterly blindsided by what he saw yesterday... what everyone saw.
made him look stupid. He felt humiliated.
but more than that, it scared him.
naked bodies, having sex... that's not something the board can tolerate.
heads must roll.
so Fitzhugh is firing us to save his own ass.
the truth is, Bill...
as much as I've loved you like a son, championed you as best I could...
I was always a little envious of you.
you have gifts that I don't... raw talent, a vision.
you are an excellent doctor, Barton.
that was one of the reasons I looked up to you.
then I took the easy way out...
made a living, supported a wife and daughter.
but now...
at my age...
you'll have a good chance of landing on your feet.
that's what matters.
guess what I'm looking at. - Mickey Mouse.
I-I couldn't find Mickey Mouse's star on Hollywood Boulevard yesterday.
I did, however, see the new Capitol Records building.
was that that crazy round building where Nat King Cole records?
did you know that there is a light on the top of that building that blinks out the word "Hollywood" in Morse code?
no, I didn't know that.
and now I'm looking at the Pacific Ocean.
well, now I'm looking at Stella transcribe dictation.
you win.
I also have some big news.
I did get an offer from UCLA.
see? I told you. Now you have the leverage you need.
it's a game-changing offer.
Oh?
and this is not how I intended to do this.
but...
I don't want to wait.
I love you, Virginia.
I have from day one.
and...I love your kids, love them as if they were my own.
and no matter what job I take,
I want you and them there with me, for good.
so...
will you marry me?
Ethan, I'm... I'm not sure Stella should be a part of this discussion.
you can answer when I get back.
but whatever kind of life you want for yourself, for your kids, it's yours.
that wasn't science. Pornography, maybe.
grossly inappropriate, certainly.
but mostly that debacle of yours was a violation of everything this hospital and university stand for, undertaken, without my knowledge, by the two men I trusted most.
I've been trying to get my head around it, but frankly, I can't.
this study has been going on for a year?
in hospital exam rooms, using hospital equipment?
you were happy enough when those rooms and equipment generated huge revenues, monies that bolstered your position with the board.
didn't hurt you at bonus time, either, I'm sure.
I gave you a special deal.
and I gave you a world-class obstetrics department.
I've made a mistake with you, Bill.
it's clear to me you've been given far too much rope to hang yourself by a man far too weak to stop you.
which brings to me a very difficult decision.
the truth is, if you had supported me from the beginning, - this wouldn't have happened at all. - I-I'm sorry?
the reason I hid my study from you, Barton, is because I knew you'd forbid it.
I came to you years ago and told you of my plan to, uh, crack the mysteries of human sexuality, but you flatly said no.
you couldn't see this was the future.
you... you couldn't envision the accolades and acclaim that such innovative work would bring to this hospital.
Acclaim? Are you drunk?
that so-called work is obscene. You didn't have the strength.
that's the one thing the Chancellor did get right.
and because you were weak, I went around you.
I did use hospital exam rooms.
I did use hospital equipment.
and I used the money you thought I was using for infertility research on sex instead.
in which case, Barton, you've been bamboozled by our lying, arrogant employee worse than I've been.
I leave the honors to you.
you know what needs to be done.
I will continue my study at this hospital...
no matter what you say today, no matter what you do.
you won't, Bill. You're fired.
the Urban League is so grateful for all your generosity, ma'am.
I'm sorry I couldn't drive them over myself.
I feel like I'm carrying a sack of cement today.
of course you do.
you know, we also take donations for our nursery, and we have a dental clinic.
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my God. What is it, ma'am?
I need to call my husband.
we have to go back to Fitzhugh. - It won't change anything.
but I can't let this stand. I can't.
it was... - The only thing to do.
it made no sense for us both to go.
dear God.
what a thing.
it was Fitzhugh's secretary who told Patsy who told me that Dr. Masters was fired. Fired!
that's like firing God. - I feel so ashamed.
what? Why?
because I showed myself...
my insides, my...vaginal walls.
and those doctors thought that it was dirty or that something went horribly wrong, and now it's as if I brought down the entire kingdom.
that's not what those doctors thought, not about you. - How do you know?
because I've seen more of you, down there, than anybody, and I think your vaginal walls...are beautiful.
you're just saying that.
I think the up-top parts are beautiful, too.
in fact, I think everything about you...is perfect.
I'm sorry. I didn't... Uh, I'll come back.
no, Gini, come in. What a day.
uh, you don't have to leave, Lester.
I do. Believe me. I do.
can you believe it? All of this just gone.
all these offices just gone.
everything that he and you and me and Lester worked so hard on is just... Gone.
where is he?
he called to say he'd be out for the rest of the day.
I don't know.
do I pack up or...?
bill can live without almost anything but not without his work.
and such good work...from such a brilliant man.
a souvenir, I guess. Or a doorstop.
ma'am, I don't think we're gonna make it across town.
we have to. I need...
mnh-mnh, my hospital's two blocks over. I'm taking you over there.
now, what this is, ma'am, is a precipitous labor, so we'll get you in a room...
precipitous labor? Wh-what is that?
quick. Apparently, your baby has a train to catch.
no, no, I can't be here. I'm supposed to deliver at Maternity.
well, where you don't want to be is sitting in a car on Charles Avenue.
you don't. I don't. Listen to her.
I'm starting electroshock treatments.
I told Margaret I wouldn't, but I have to do something.
I've done two things right in my life... you and my family.
but maybe I can get something else right, something ahead, if I fix myself.
you know the risks of electroshock as well as I do.
well, what endeavor doesn't have risks?
as we've seen. But the reward...
the reward can make me a new man.
now, haven't we spent our whole lives believing in science?
we have.
so, tomorrow I'll admit myself, I'll have my treatment, and then I'll go home cured to a wife I love, to a better future, to a job, thanks to you.
but tonight...
I'm worried about you.
what are you gonna do, Bill?
the same.
I'm gonna go home.
Dr. Masters...
sorry about the locks.
I, uh...
well, I certainly wouldn't want to have to escort you out.
STUDUES IN HUHAN SEXUSL RESPONSE
mom. Mom, come look!
the craft has now touched down.
the pod door is opening, and he's emerging.
this is truly an historic moment in American history.
welcome home, Major!
good to be home, Colonel.
how do you feel, Major?
good. Grateful.
what did you learn up there in space?
man can go anywhere.
he just has to take his own atmosphere with him.
I can't wait till Ethan comes back so we can tell him.
you ready to call your husband now, Mrs. Masters?
soon. In a little while.
you put my name on the study.
you earned it.
no one believes in the work.
Scully, maybe.
no one else.
I do.
so do you. - But it doesn't matter.
because...
it's over.
so, uh...
I have nothing to offer you.
that's all right.
except, maybe. the truth.
I finally realized that, uh.
there is one thing I-I can't live without.
it's you.
you.
I got nothing, sir. No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
should we try to contact them? -Won't matter. My gut says they're down.
we should start back. -lf that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know.
sweep as wide as possible, as fast as possible.
lines are crawling with calamari. -The sooner we find them the better.
thought you could use something to eat. -Thank you.
any change?
no.
how is he? -He's gonna be fine.
at least until he wakes up.
what do you mean? -Captain has some questions for him.
he'd better have some good answers.
you see these cuts? I think they're self-inflicted.
Why? -VDTs maybe. I don't know.
but like I said, the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix.
for what? -For Neo.
how could he be in the Matrix, sir? He's not plugged in.
please, for me.
this is what keeps bothering me.
what?
his neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.
the strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.
where? -On someone jacked in.
the big bupkes. Nada. He's not in there.
sir, I got the projections. -How long?
based on point of entry and the past speed, the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
all right, let's move with a purpose. AK, I want you on holographic.
mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.
and make sure we are running on as few pads as possible.
Hey! You got a call. -What?
operator.
it's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle. You must come at once.
good morning.
who are you? -My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.
my papa says you're not supposed to be here. He says you must be lost.
are you lost, Neo?
where am l? -This is the train station.
this isn't the Matrix? -That's where the train goes.
that's where we're going, but you cannot go with us.
why not? -He won't let you.
who won't? -The Trainman. I don't like him.
but my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says...
...or else he will leave us here forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity, thank you for coming.
one thing I've learned in all my years...
...is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to.
who are you? -I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me...
...but it wasn't meant to be. -What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice cost me more than I wanted it to.
what choice?
to help you, to guide Neo.
now, since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again...
...knowing full well what it might cost...
...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice......because here I am, at it again.
do you know what happened to Neo? -Yes.
he is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.
the link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.
he uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.
if he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...
...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.
Why? -Because of who the Trainman works for.
the Merovingian.
he has placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman. He'll go with you.
for years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
please, follow me.
Oracle...
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.
after everything that has happened, how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
for you to make up your own damn mind. Believe me or don't.
all I can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble, and he needs your help.
he needs all our help.
are you from the Matrix? -Yes.
no.
I mean, I was. -Why did you leave?
I had to. -I had to leave my home too.
sati! Come here, darling. Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry. She is still very curious.
I know you. -Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife, Kamala. My daughter, Sati.
we are most honored to meet you.
you are programs. -Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager for recycling operations.
my wife is an interactive software programmer. She is highly creative.
what are you doing here? You do not belong here.
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize. My wife can be very direct.
it's okay.
I don't have an answer.
I don't even know where "here" is. -This place is nowhere.
it is between your world and our world.
who's the Trainman? -He works for the Frenchman.
why did I know you would say that?
the Frenchman does not forget, and he does not forgive.
you know him? -I know only what I need to know.
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...
...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.
is that what you're doing here?
Rama, please. -I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
he may never see another face for the rest of his life.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to answer that question. -No, I don't mind.
the answer is simple.
I love my daughter very much.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
but where we are from, that is not enough.
every program that is created must have a purpose.
if it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.
you do not understand. -I just have never
heard a program speak of love.
lt is a human emotion. -No, it is a word.
what matters is the connection the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
anything.
then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason I am here.
that's him.
get away! Get away from me! -We don't want trouble.
get the hell away from me! -We need your help.
I can't help you! No one can help you!
Oh, no!
damn it!
when is the train due? -lt is already late.
it's not like the Trainman to be late.
you think it has something to do with me? -I cannot say.
who knows such things? Only the Oracle.
you know the Oracle? -Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her before I met with the Frenchman.
she promised to watch Sati after we said goodbye.
goodbye?
you're not staying with her? -lt is not possible.
our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.
my wife and I must return to our world. -Why?
that is our karma. -You believe in karma?
karma is a word, like love.
a way of saying:
what I am here to do.
I do not resent my karma. I'm grateful for it.
grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.
they are gifts, and so I do what I must do to honor them.
Papa, the train! -Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.
can I carry that for you?
all right.
hurry it up, I'm late!
who are you? -He is a friend.
I know you.
so that's what they wanted. -I need to get back.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
one way or another, I'm getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
you'll stay here until the Merovingian says different.
if I know him...
...you're gonna be here for a long, long time.
I don't want to hurt you. -You don't get it.
I built this place.
down here, I make the rules. Down here, I make the threats.
down here, I'm God.
get on the train or you'll stay here with him.
we should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do.
no. We know what has to be done.
shit.
you gotta be kidding.
holy shit, it's wingless.
I get it.
you must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
only way you're getting through this door is over my big, dead ass.
so be it.
there are no weapons allowed in the club.
at the bottom of this elevator, there is a coat-check girl...
...and if we are lucky, one man for checking weapons.
and if we're unlucky?
there will be many men.
can I take your--? Oh, my God.
what in the hell?
I don't believe this.
Hey!
the prodigal child returns.
are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.
I'll tell you what I will do.
put down the guns, and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.
all three of us? -Oh, yes, yes.
of course.
who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting?
the Fates are too kind, eh?
and since you, my little Judas, have brought them here...
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson...
...and to remember that there is no action without consequence.
and if you take something from me, you will pay the price.
you know why we are here?
come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know.
it is my business to know.
some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though, as to how it actually happened.
do you know? -No.
no?
I did not think so.
but it is always best to ask, huh?
we want to make a deal.
always straight to business, huh, Morpheus?
okay. I have something you want.
to make a deal...
...you must have something I want, yes?
and it so happens there is something I want.
something I have wanted ever since I first came here.
it is said they cannot be taken...
...they can only be given.
what?
the eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping the nature of the universe.
it is that nature that has again brought you to me.
where some see coincidence, I see consequence.
where others see chance...
...I see cost.
bring me the eyes of the Oracle...
...and I will give you back your savior.
it seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me.
yes? No?
I don't have time for this shit.
you wanna make a deal? How about this?
you give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.
interesting deal.
you are really ready to die for this man?
believe it. -She'll do it.
if she has to, she'll kill every one of us.
she's in love.
it is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity.
time's up.
what's it gonna be, Merv?
okay. You got yourself in here...
...you can get yourself out.
are you ready for us?
almost, sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here.
but you found Neo? -Can't you see him?
no, sir. We read something, but I couldn't tell what.
I can't leave yet.
I have to see her.
now?
it's my last chance.
that's it. That's the secret.
you've got to use your hands. -Why?
cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done before you got here. Oh, well.
Sati, honey, I think it's time for a tasting.
take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.
okay.
I'm glad you got out. -Me too.
so do you recognize me?
a part of you. -Yeah, that's how it works.
some bits you lose, some bits you keep.
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror...
...but I still love candy.
no, thank you.
remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
jittery as a June bug. And now, just look at you.
you sure did surprise me, Neo, and you still do.
you gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
you helped me to get here, but my question is, why?
where is this going?
where does it end? -I don't know.
you don't know or you won't tell me? -I told you before...
...no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand, and I mean no one.
what choice? -lt doesn't matter. It's my choice.
I have mine to make, same as you have yours.
does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
of course not. -Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?
about Zion and the ones before me? Why didn't you tell me the truth?
because it wasn't time for you to know. -Who decided it wasn't time?
you know who.
know Thyself.
I did.
then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.
so do l.
tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.
tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.
tell me just what the hell is happening to me.
the power of the One extends beyond this world.
it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.
where? -The source.
that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.
you should be dead, but apparently you weren't ready for that either.
the Architect said that if I didn't return to the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.
please. You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...
...but that man can't see past any choice.
why not? -He doesn't understand them. He can't.
to him, they are variables in an equation.
one at a time, each variable must be solved, then countered.
that's his purpose. To balance the equation.
what's your purpose?
to unbalance it.
Why? What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
and I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.
the end of the war.
is it going to end?
one way or another.
can Zion be saved?
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question, but...
if there is an answer, there's only one place you're going to find it.
where? -You know where.
and if you can't find the answer...
...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.
what does that mean?
everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
and you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
very soon, he is going to have the power to destroy this world.
but I believe he won't stop there. He can't.
he won't stop until there's nothing left at all.
what is he?
he is you.
your opposite, your negative.
the result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
and if I can't stop him? -One way or another, Neo...
...this war is going to end.
tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.
how are you feeling? Are you all right?
I need time.
that figures. -Captain Roland.
what's up, Maggie? -Bane is. He's conscious.
good. Maybe he's got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
Oracle. -I know.
I know.
Sati, honey.
take a few cookies and go with Seraph.
can I come back? I would like to come back.
I would like that too. -Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I'm scared, Seraph.
come.
he's following us.
well, well, it's been a long time.
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.
and you must be the last exile.
the Oracle told me about you. -Really?
what did she say about me?
that you were a bad man.
Oh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me.
the great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.
I suppose you've been expecting me, right?
the all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? She knows everything.
but if that's true, then why is she here if she knew I was coming?
why wouldn't she leave?
maybe you knew I would do that, maybe you didn't.
if you did, that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there...
...deliberately, purposefully...
...which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.
what did you do with Sati?
cookies need love like everything does.
you are a bastard.
you would know, Mom.
do what you're here to do.
Yes, ma'am.
I really wish I could help, but I just... I don't remember any of it.
what about the cuts on your arms? Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
you're right about that, sir.
they look like they might be self-inflicted.
but why would I do something like that to myself?
unless, of course, I wasn't myself.
but if I'm not me, then who am l?
has this man been tested for VDTs? -Yes, sir. It was negative.
but he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity.
some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...
...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.
I want the truth. I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.
sir, we found her.
the Logos? -Yes, sir.
about time we had some goddamn good news.
are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
no, sir. Nothing yet.
what about the ship? -Holographic says the hull's still intact.
drop down and keep a man in the turret. -Yes, sir.
get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.
careful, sir.
the squids are sneaky bastards. It could be a trap.
what was that?
you can put that shit away, boys. All she needs is a jump.
Niobe. -Morpheus.
are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine.
we didn't know what happened after...
I'm sorry. -It's okay.
I'm happy to see you too.
did you get Neo out? -Yes.
how did you know about that? -The Oracle.
you saw her? -Just before the sentinels found us.
what did she tell you? -The same thing she always does.
exactly what I needed to hear.
in 12 hours, the machines will breach the dock walls.
every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...
...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.
thus, our primary objective must be...
...to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock.
if we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.
if not, the only place we will be able to mount a defense...
...will be at the entrance of the temple.
it is small and will force them into a bottleneck...
...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.
we understand that you've requested additional volunteers.
that is correct.
precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.
half the infantry? -lf it were up to me, councillor...
...I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in their hand...
...and march them into that dock.
perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.
time will tell, councillor.
commander, just one more question.
has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar?
none, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.
perhaps.
but we can hope.
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.
Zee, what are you doing? -Making shells.
they're evacuating our level. We have to go.
I'm not going with you. -What?
they've called for volunteers to hold the dock.
kids, you stay here.
I know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I have to. -Why?
because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
and if I were out there and he were here, I know what he'd do.
but you're gonna get yourself killed. It's crazy, Zee.
maybe it is. But ask yourself, if it were Dozer...
...and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock...
...what would you do?
make shells.
what the shit is going on over here?
an accident, sir. I didn't see...
I'm sorry. -Who the hell are you?
a unit volunteer, sir.
what's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir. We gotta hold the dock.
how old are you, kid? -Eighteen.
should have said 16, I might have believed that.
okay, I'm 16.
minimum age for the Corps is 18. Sixteen's too young.
the machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same.
ain't that the goddamn truth.
give me a chance, sir. I won't let you down.
you do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.
okay, charge the igniter.
she lives again.
you want to reload the operations software, Sparky?
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
uplinks in place. I'm bringing her back online.
looking good, except...
something's wrong with the Matrix feed.
no, there's not. You're looking at what we're looking at.
what's going on in there? -Whatever it is, it can't be good.
the machines have taken Junction 21.
the way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.
we'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.
hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.
it ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.
no, it's not.
there's another way. A support line.
it drops down right here, 1000 meters short of 21.
if we're lucky, we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.
that's a mechanical line. It's impossible.
no one can pilot a mechanical. -I can.
bullshit. -I've done it.
that was a long time ago, Niobe. -I said I can do it.
so what? You'll be the only one that can. There's no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long.
but I wanted to be sure. -Sure of what?
I know what I have to do. -What?
there's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.
I have to take one of the ships. -What?
to go where?
to the machine city.
I know it's difficult to understand.
no, it's not. You're out of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
in 100 years, no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it.
you'll never make it. -I have to try.
ls this what the Oracle has told you? -No.
this is asinine. If you want to kill yourself, do it...
...but do it without wasting our ships.
you have to believe me. I have to go. -Bullshit!
I am the captain of this ship. I say where it has to go!
and this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.
he can take mine. -You can't do that.
don't try to tell me what I can or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.
but for christ's sake, Niobe-- -I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.
if we leave inside the hour, we should reach Zion as the machines do.
that's as good a plan as any.
it's a waste. A goddamn waste.
two ships, two directions.
sounds like providence, doesn't it, Morpheus?
you've never believed in the One. -I still don't.
then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
thank you.
what's that for? -To help you relax.
to make it easier for you to remember.
what if I don't want to remember?
why would you want that?
what if I blew that EMP?
what if I did destroy those ships...
...and I am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
if I did that...
...it wouldn't be very safe for me here, would it?
of course, it might not be very safe for you either.
I'm ready.
Trinity...
...there's something I have to say.
something you need to understand.
I know I'm supposed to go.
but beyond that...
...I don't know. I...
I know. You don't think you're coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave. I could see it in your face.
just like you knew the moment you looked at me that I was coming with you.
I'm scared, Trin.
so am l.
it took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot.
but I'll tell you something.
six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...
...I was ready to give anything and everything for you.
do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
no.
nothing.
finished loading ammunition? -Just about.
let's move it. We are out of time.
you're not leaving them anything?
he said he didn't need it.
I ain't saying goodbye. I'm saying good luck.
thank you.
I can only hope you know what you're doing.
me too.
it was an honor, sir.
no, the honor is still mine.
we're ready, sir. -About damn time.
we're already late, captain, so let's hit it and hit it hard.
Bye, baby.
take good care of them.
ready?
engine's still firing.
must be a fuse. I'll check it out.
I should've known he'd send his bitch first. -Bane.
no one ever got away from me as many times as you did.
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.
what are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!
you're gonna pay for that.
twenty-seven kilometers to go. -We got an emergency.
what is it, AK? -It's Maggie, sir.
she's dead, murdered. I think it was Bane.
goddamn it.
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.
he fired that EMP.
goddamn it, I should have beaten it out of him.
we searched the whole ship, captain. He ain't here.
I know where he is. -The Logos.
we gotta go back. -Too late.
what if they need our help? -It's too dangerous.
Why? -Because if he's killed them...
...he'll control another EMP.
at this point, they're on their own. Just like us.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other.
what? -He's out of his mind.
it might appear that way. But Mr. Anderson and I know...
...that appearances can be deceiving.
confused, Mr. Anderson? It'll all become clear in a moment.
thank you for bringing me the gun. You can set it down there.
don't do it.
shoot. Shoot now. -Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.
do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.
look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't.
he can't. -Do it.
back away from the gun and turn around.
let her go.
somehow familiar, isn't it?
we've been here before, you and l, remember?
I do. I think of nothing else.
who are you? -Still don't recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat.
the stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.
disgusting.
look at how pathetically fragile it is. Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
what do you want? -I want what you want.
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.
look past the flesh.
look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
no. -Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
lt can't be. -There's nowhere I can't go.
there is nowhere I won't find you.
it's impossible. -Not impossible.
inevitable.
goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
this is it. It's gotta be.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself, Mr. Anderson.
blind messiah.
you're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.
helpless.
pathetic.
just waiting to be put out of your misery.
I can see you.
it's not over, Mr. Anderson.
it's not over.
Trinity! -Neo.
Neo.
Oh, no. Your eyes.
I'll be okay.
it's all right, Trin.
but I think you're gonna have to drive.
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.
they can't know we don't have an EMP. They'll have to attack in waves.
concentrate our offense on the diggers. Order the APUs into position.
Yes, sir.
come on, move.
all right!
this is it.
now, you all know me, so I'll just say this as simple as I can.
if it's our time to die, it's our time.
all I ask is, if we have to give these bastards our lives...
...we give them hell before we do!
Yeah!
you scared, Charra? -Shit, yeah.
but I'll make you a deal.
you keep loading, I keep shooting.
deal.
holy Christ, would you look at that. -Quiet.
