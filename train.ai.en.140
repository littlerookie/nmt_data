yingli green energy (yge, news): yingli is my choice for a horse to ride in china's solar industry.
yingli green energy, based near beijing, has an even bigger share of the california market than suntech, though it produces fewer panels overall. It also has even lower costs. Others, such as ja solar, trina solar, and china sunergy, are rapidly gaining brand recognition worldwide.
yingli is based in baoding, a city 90 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of beijing that promotes itself as a center for renewable energy.
yingli plans to set up a sales office in south africa this year, and is also interested in expanding into northern africa.
yingli solar, another large chinese manufacturer, said on thursday that it also had a "preliminary plan" to assemble panels in the united states.
yingli, for example, has net debt of about$ 1.9 billion.
yingluck is the younger sister of one of thailand's most polarizing political figures, former prime minister thaksin shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup.
yingluck shinawatra led the crowd's roar of approval at a campaign stop in thailand, leaving little doubt of where her political allegiances lie: the gulf city is home to her brother, the deposed and exiled prime minister, thaksin shinawatra.

yingluck won 296 votes in the nearly 500-member parliament.
yingluck's critics worry she will do her brother's bidding--something she has denied.
yingluck's main challenge--provided she wins--will be to negotiate the rocky political shoals of a tense and turbulent thai society.

if mr prestowitz is right, the global crisis means more than a cyclical shock to asian economies.
if mr putin decides to return to the kremlin it will probably be because he believes mr medvedev is too weak to exert control.
if mr putin does shrink from reform at home, however, he risks sowing the seeds of his own downfall.
if mr putin has stopped lamenting the level of corruption in russia, as he used to, it is only because he believes this is futile and that other countries are the same.
