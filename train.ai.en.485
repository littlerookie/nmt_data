and if we can only find out why this was, then perhaps we'll be able to get somewhere.
and if we can pass that test,
and if we can prove Jane Doe sedated the dog, it's premeditation.
and if we can prove that this is a sexual fetish, indecent assault.

and if we could rocket back a few hours,
and if we could somehow remove them
and if we could trust the police
and if we couldn't find anything you didn't disclose on the application,

and if we did know...
and if we did some sort of anniversary concert...
and if we did win,
and if we did, we got thrown out too.

and if we didn't get it from him, then we'd all be dinged.
and if we didn't get it from him, then we'd all be dinged.
and if we didn't start doing something about it, we would have...

and if we die, you'll die because we're too big to fail.
and if we dive into that swamp of indiscretion known as social media,
and if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got.
and if we do all those things,
and if we do destroy it, what do we face in retaliation?
and if we do find him?
and if we do find him?
and if we do get there, it sure as heck won't be something that a poodle pees on.
and if we do have them, then, you know
and if we do it wrong,
and if we do it wrong, we just proved our alibi false.

and if we do nothing, there's a chance it's all okay?
and if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway.
and if we do operate, I may die.
and if we do remember it, we must immediately forget it.
and if we do so accidentally, we won't burst intotearswithoutwarning

and if we do that,
and if we do the same thing?
and if we do this, I'm gonna care about you even more,
and if we do this, it would mean a lot to him.
and if we do this, what does it make us?
and if we do this...
and if we do well, if we do really well,
and if we do, in our hearts,
and if we do, we let the coast guard watch it and we wait for a warrant.
and if we do, we'll tell them not to tell anyone.
and if we do, what's the first thing you're gonna say to him?
and if we do, you'll shoot us and bury us in the same hole.
and if we do?
and if we do? The maximum.
and if we don't - - and if we don't create these memories now,
and if we don't -
and if we don't Co up with that new witness,
and if we don't act fast, they'll all be dead by morning.
and if we don't all chip in
you'd bet their lives on that?
to help you do it.
to help you expand your thinking, examine the impact the following events would have on your organization.
to help you fake your death,
to help you fake your death,

that's why she has 20 ex-boyfriends.
no, I didn't. - yes, I am, actually.
and if we don't bail him out, the bank's gonna foreclose.
and if we don't before we leave,
and if we don't bring her body temperature down,
and if we don't bring it to him first think in the morning...
and if we don't bring it up
and if we don't catch him soon, he's gonna kill again. You can't take this personally.
and if we don't catch the bad guys, there might not be any toast.
and if we don't choose Amy's baby,
and if we don't choose Amy's baby,
and if we don't choose to spend more money ourselves, the government will do it for us.

and if we don't do anything? And just leave him?
and if we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month.
and if we don't do something to stop him,
and if we don't do something to stop him, he's going to kill us all.
and if we don't do something, he's gonna kill this girl.
and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay,
and if we don't eat his flesh or drink his blood...
and if we don't eat his fleshor drink his blood...
and if we don't expand, our clients will leave us for someone who will.
and if we don't find a solution to stop the killing now, this species will become extinct.
and if we don't find a way out of here, we're next.
and if we don't find her another one in the next three days, she's going to be dead,
and if we don't find her, and I mean soon,
and if we don't find her, here's what else.
and if we don't find him soon...

and if we don't find out what's wrong on Mars, it could be our last.
and if we don't find the Duke, this, everything, all over.

and if we don't have it here,
and if we don't help each other, what hope do we have?
and if we don't help her, her name will make the obituaries.
and if we don't help her, she's out of here.
and if we don't know Mars, our next door neighbor...
and if we don't know about him,

you'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons.
you'd better back and get some sleep.
you'd better back down.
you'd better bag and tag him.

and if we don't maintain our social life,
and if we don't move now apparently we're going to loose him.
and if we don't move now, we're all going to be.
and if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.
and if we don't punish him, well,
