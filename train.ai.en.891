he seem injured or ill when you picked him up? - Not really.
he was kind of out of breat - like he was running?
Yeah, and he kept looking back over his shoulder like he thought someone might be following us.
were they? - Good luck tailing anyone in D. C.Traffic.
did he speak to you? - Not a word.
as usual, I did all the talking. Pass the time, you know?
I passed the time, he passed away, poor guy.
Yeah, gibbs. - Secnav is holding, sir.
SECNAV? Tell him I'm...
I already told him you on the navy yard and available, sir.
Cynthia, don't ever tell anybody I'm available untii tell you I'm available, okay?
Yes, sir. - Put him through.
that the director on the phone? - Secnav.
wonder what Gibbs did wrong. - Slipped into Jenny's heels.
uh, Ziva, take the driver's statement. - I already did.
McGee, crime scene photos, finish 'em. - Yeah, I finished 'em.
you get an I.D.?
Yeah, the photo on the yemeni's driver's license matches the victim's.
Hamal farhan. No buzzers. - List.
what else? - List, seven names on it, Farhan is number five.
obviously, whatever he want to tell us had something to do with this list.
find everyone on it. - So, director, does that mean you're...
I'm heading the investigation.
Hey, Duck, you win the pool. - Yes!
thank you, Jethro! - And I didn't do anything wrong, Mcgee.
black rose has countered our ejection-seat bid.
how does the pob hope to maintain a classical ballet company if there are no classical works scheduled?
I have no idea. Black rose, Rene?
what is Leame's bid?
20, 000 euros per seat.
double it.
I know you want to corner the market on F-14 components, Rene, but even if the iranians pay top euros, by the time we split the shipment for transport...
we're not splitting the shipment now. It's all going on le tortue.
she sails for Hormuz on the 23rd.
if the americans stop her, you risk losing not only the components, but the ship.
$68 million and chan.
Regine, the U. S. Ny will seize le tortue after she enters the Persian Gulf.
don't you know americans pay more to keep their 14 parts out of iranian hands than iranians pay to get them.
So...Just double it.
nice in 20 minutes.
time to refresh.
a friend in the gru informs me that NCIS naples is quietly trying to locate a former colonel-general Dimitri Borov.
she is relentless. - Does that surprise you?
she is the first female director of an armed federal agency.
have they located colonel-general Dimitri Borov?
not yet.
perhaps they should.
I've been hacking cabs for 22 years. Never had a fare die on me.
couple of heart attacks, a suicide attempt or two, but none of them died.
till now. Anyone who does something for 22 years must love it.
you kidding? It's the best job in the world!
Soow you think I'm crazy, right? But here's the thing.
my best friend, I met him in the cab.
the guy who does my taxes, I met him in the cab.
poker buddies, met 'emn the cab. I even met my wi in the cab.
well, three out of four ain't bad.
this is your statement. Read it. If you agree, sign it.
I think we should, uh, call for a recount.
on what? Ducky winning the pool.
Gibbs is up in the director's office directing, right?
we're working the case. He's not.
because he's waiting for me to give him an update.
which I'm gonna do as soon as Mr. Kelly signs his statement and leaves.
I can go?
you can go to the head or our conference room.
he said I could leave.
well, what I say doesn't count when the boss here.
like me when the wife is around.
Mr. Kelly. - Lead the way.
follow me.
update? - Mcgee.
according to immigration, Hamal Farhan applied for a student visa twice and was turned down twice.
granted a six-month tourist visa. That was a year-and-a-half ago.
even if he had it extended for a year, he's here illegally.
should we notify immigration and deport him?
that's a good one, boss.
actually, his visa was extended indefinitely.
yemen added farhan to their embassy personnel.
what are you trying to do, make me look bad?
I just read it. - Added as what?
a gardener.
in here.
anything I can get you, Mr. Kelly?
my cab so I can leave. - To eat or drink?
Philly cheese steak and a beer would be nice.
no alcoholic beverages allowed. I will work on your sandwich.
you gonna lock me in?
uh, no, but there will be an escort outside the door.
is that another name for a guard?
Thelma, you're never gonna believe where I am.
no, I'm not at Kelsey's bar.
how did he die, Duck?
quickly, Jethro, as the meter ticked over and without the driver even noticing.
and whatever caused his demise is not evident from my autopsy.
there's no sign of violence, lumps, bumps, punctures or holes.
drug overdose?
well, I can't say for certain till I receive Abby's report.
but he didn't die of a cardiac infarion which is how most overdoses kill.
his heart shows no sign of coronary artery disease.
in fact, it's in excellent condition, as can be said of all your organs.
pity they couldn't all have been donated. They were all so healthy.
poison?
it's the most likely culprit, but again, I await Abigail.
I thought you were supposed to solve these riddles, Duck.
Abby and I like to share. - Right.
that wouldn't have been your assistant, would it, director?
I do hate a nagging woman, Duck. - She's only doing her job, Jethro.
Ah, Abby. Any news on the tox screen?
Abby, Abby, are you there?
Oh, I guess she must have...
gone.
Oh, this cab is bringing bac memories Cheap vinyl, plastic divider, dirty floors.
actually, these floors are pretty clean. The ones I remember were dirty.
let me guess. Short-lived career as a cabbie?
Ah, a short-lived encounter.
ship in the night.
my first time. - For what?
front seat or back? - Back.
well, both, kind of.
my first time was in a weapons carrier.
of course it was.
where was the cabbie when this encounter took place?
he was the cabbie, putting himself through school.
it was his first time, too. - First time for what?
seeing a curling match, Gibbs. Have y ever seen a curling match?
the pristine ice and those ttle brooms that sweep...
that's a clean cab.
so, um, what killed him, heart attack - No, Ducky ruled out a heart attack.
poison looks better all the time.
well, major mass sperometer is working as fast as he can.
make him work faster, Abby. - Yes, sir.
running shoe.
Yeah, that impression matches Forhan's left foot.
the cab must have been cleaned before he was picked up.
after he hailed the cab, like most passengers, he didn't sit directly behind the driver.
crossed his leg like this. - Then he died.
in a very relaxed position. - May have been a natural death, Gibbs.
I know he was healthy and young, but it does happen.
sads. - No, sad. No "s."
no, it is sads sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. - Right. Sorry.
it can leave the heart looking perfectly normal.
McGee, you check out our cabbie?
uh, not yet. That is my next task.
Hey, boss.
five of the seven names found on the list in Farhan's wallet are dead.
a hit list? - When?
first died three weeks ago.
the last-- not including Farhan-- Monday.
kind of rules out our sads theory, Ziva. - Sads?
sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. - I know what it is, Ziva.
it's number two on the list. Sean price, 24, died of sads.
the others? - Heart attack. Or a blown autopsy.
no autopsy. He was 79.
one car crash, one drowning. One list, five people.
you and Ziva go find the two live names on this list. Look for a connection.
david Brown and Robert Smith. There'll be dozens of them.
I read the obits. If there's a connection, I didn't see it.
Oh, there's a connection.
what? - They're all dead.
relax, Thelma, they won't keep me here overnight.
I'll be out of here soon. Right, boss?
I'm not your boss.
right now it sure feels like it. - When'd you have the cab cleaned?
I got it that way from dispatch. - How many fares before Farhan?
he was my first. - He was looking over his shoulder?
till he was sure we weren't being tailed. Then he relaxed.
maybe I just thought he relaxed, seeing how he was dead.
can I get my cab and go now? - Not yet.
I am very relieved that none of the decead are your friends or relatives.
Hi, may I speak with david brown?
Yes, I am certain they are dead. - Thanks.
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't send flowers. - May I speak with David Brown?
if you wish to send a sympathy card, I am sure it would be very appreciated.
well, you have a good life, too.
I wouldn't normally ask you this, but since you don't know the deceased,
I was wondering if you'd be interested in subscribing to our DVD club.
it's mostly east german films. Because I have a very special...
gets 'em off the line fast ery time.
Hey, boss, 32 David Browns in the metro area.
so far I've talked to four. - 41 Robert Smiths, two.
and I notified the yemen embassy of... - Director Gibbs!
your cell phone is off. - Because I shut it off.
the yemen embass has been calling for the director.
did you tell them she's in Paris? - Yes.
good.
I also told them you were acting director.
they're sending an attach to identify the body.
Yes, that is him, Hamal Farhan. When will the body be released?
when we know how he died and why. - You suspect murder?
I always suspect murder when a healthy young man dies of no apparent cause.
finding thcause of death could take several days.
weeks.
it is our request that mr. Farhan be turned over to the embassy immediately.
kid must have been a hell of a gardener.
he had no family in America. We take care of our own.
this time of night, the embassy sends an e-mail, not a cultural attach? Dr. Temani.
you are acting director of NCIS, I believe?
director will be back at the end of the week if you want to wait around.
Mr. Farhan wanted to attend an american university, but was repeatedly denied a student visa.
so he took up gardening? - Only on paper.
he stops at the embassy everfriday just to pick up a paycheck.
he was connected. - Yes.
the son of one of the Prime Minister's advisors.
Hamal wanted to learn English and study American culture, nothing more.
did I say there was? - No, but I know what you're thinking.
Hamal was not the type to be involved with terrorism.
he asked to be broug toNCIS for a reason.
I cannot imagine why.
the last person from your country who asked to talk to NCIS was killed.
when was that? - October 10, 2000.
two days before the terrorist attack on Uss Cole.
do you know Maury Goldberg, Thomas West, Adam Zeileg, Sean Price or Hamal Farhan?
no, not Adam West. Adam Zeileg or Thomas West.
Burt Ward is a good friend of mine. - You know Burt Ward?
Yeah, I do. - Really?
holy molars!
no kidding. On the Simpsons? Which one?
is that the one with the muslim guy on the bike?
uh, thanks for your help, Mr. Brown. Tell Burt, Tony says hi.
I know, boss. This isn't TV trivia.
a dead man was left on our doorstep clutching a hit list.
well, not exactly clutching, but with a hit list in his wallet, and we have to find the two names on the list that haven't been hit yet before they are hit.
no, Dinozzo. - No?
we have to find the dirt bag that killed the other five!
agt gibbs? - What?
justice called on the scoletti case.
they've granted the defense permission to do their own ballistics test tomorrow.
tell special agent Gillman this is his case.
as acting director, you have to sign off on it.
we still have those case files to review.
we can do them later.
uh, legit. He's had a hack license in D. C. for 22 years.
other than a couple of minor traffic violations, he's clean.
he has been here a while. Should we release him?
if I wanted him released, Mcgee... - You would have told me.
scoletti's lawyers have a hired gun coming in to check Abby's ballistics.
tell abby. - I'd really rather not.
it wasn't a request.
when is the director returning? - Sometime tomorrow.
I don't think Gibbs is going to last that...
Hello? - Yes.
mister Smith. I'm calling from NCIS.
naval Criminal Investigative Service.
they're questioning the validity of my ballistics?
scoletti's lawyers are desperate. They're desperate.
they're like drowning men grasping... - At thin polystyrene tubes?
I-I was going to say straws, but I do like that idiom better.
well, because mine's more accurate.
I mean, does saying,"grasping at straws" tell you if they're made out of paper or glass or metal or polystyrene? No!
I pride myself on the accuracy of my forensics, and lawyers...
lawyers are questioning it!
Abby, they don't know you like we know you. Okay?
they're hoping that you made a mistake, but when their ballistic experts don't find any, that makes your forensics all the more damning in court.
so please do not let desperate lawyers grasping at thin polystyrene tubes upset you please?
I love you, Mcgee.
not like love you, love you.
not that I don't love you, because I do, kind of.
you know, like... Like the way I love puppies.
I-I could have done without the comparison.
but I love puppies.
you'll just have to wait. They can't hold me here overnight.
my wife doesn't believe I'm being held by navy cop he's a material witness.
Thanks, pal. You know how wives are...
they don't trust you as far as they can kick you.
wouldn't know. Never married. - How did you get away?
after a while, women-- they just don't like me.
what do you do, leave the toilet lid up?
I know when they're lying. Men, too.
from the top
the guy was my first fare.
flagged me down outside Kelsey's Bar on 25th.
done. - I have a dozen Smiths left.
want to take half of them?
I don't think so.
will make it worth your wow. - While. Not wow.
wow makes more sense. - You're right. Wow would be better.
then you'll help me? - No - Hey. - Did you call to apologize?
uh, yeah. You're right. I was in a rush.
I should have taken more time. - Me, too.
I sprung that house on you. - It was a surprise.
you willing to look at it with me?
look yeah, when? - Saturday.
deal.
I got to go. Love you, Tony.
love you, too, Jeanne.
come on. You can tell us what you're feeling.
stop nagging my baby or you can plot the mass spectrum on a graph yourself, Mcgee.
perfect.
you know what they say about the watched pot, right?
don't you have something to do? - No.
not until major mass spec tells me if Farhan was poisoned or not.
be a good boy and go get me scoletti's weapon out of the evidence locker.
you going to run another ballistics test?
no, I've already quadruple-checkethat, but the serial number was filed off of the weapon.
I used an acid-etching solution to lift it up.
I'm going to quadruple-check that now.
Abby. You did not make an error.
by the time you get back, the kettle will be whistling.
if not sooner. Saxitoxin? - Never heard of it.
it's a neurotoxin.
it's found in most cases of paralytic shellfish poisoning.
he ate a bad clam? - I don't know.
what are you looking for? - Gibbs.
he has this uncanny way of just showing up whenever I make a discovery.
he's a little bit off his game since he's been playing director.
is that so, Mcgee?
both of you, get down here.
saxitoxin is produced by a single-cell organism that floishes in the warm months.
it is eaten by oysterscls, mussels, and is responsible for the deadly phemenon known as red tide.
the poison disrupts the electrical impulses to the bra, and the body basically forgets how to breathe, how to live, and it's prtically undetectable.
good work, my dear. - Thank you, Ducky.
you're welcome - whenever you two are done.
Yes, well, six-tenths of a milligram could kill an adult.
that levels consistent with, well, for example, improperly prepared fugu.
that's, uh, blowfish. Japanese delicacy.
Farhan's death was accidental?
not likely. His stomach was empty.
and even if it wasn't, the saxitoxin levels were a hundred times higher than he could have possibly consumed by eating shellfish.
there's nothing in nature with that high of a concentration.
during the 50s, a suicide pill was synthesized using contaminated butter clams.
by who? - Our old friends.
the CIA.
Shepard. - Colonel-general Borov.
who is this? - I have located him.
place de la concorde.
circle the obelisk. I will be waiting where marie lost her head.
ten minutes.
place de la concorde. And hit it. - Yes, director.
there he is. Pull over.
after pulp fiction, a gun aimed my way in a car makes me nervous.
put it away, Hektor.
and turn around, Hektor.
this is to be a private conversation.
colonel-general Borov?
no foreplay? - No time.
so american.
is La Grenouille in Paris? - That's better. No.
he is in Nice. I'm joining him later tonight.
why is the CIA helping me?
perhaps we believe in righting a wrong.
colonel-general Borov's address.
He'in the hospital? - Dying of lung cancer.
pull over by the bridge.
there's an e-ticket in your name with a visa at charles de gaulle.
aeroflot flight SU 252 to Moscow.
it departs in three hours.
au revoir, cherie.
we are trying to establish a timeline of Farhan's final ride, Gibbs.
Taxicab's onboard computer tracked his movements with a GPS, and determined the fare based on how many zones it crossed.
our cabbie did not take the most direct route from the embassy.
this is America, Ziva. Lack of opportunity. No cabbie ever takes the quickest route.
he dropped down along the river, circumnted the city center.
how much? - 27. 65
hope you guys are on overtime.
is this the routyou took to the navy yard this afternoon?
more or less. - More.
the fare was $27. 65
it does not match the distance you said you traveled.
there was traffic. I was trying to avoid it. Got jammed up.
he wasn't complaining, you know? - Because he was dead.
the wife. I'm going to take this because she scares me more than you guys.
Thelma? - I made the switch. Now get us the hell out of here.
I'm trying, Thelma, I'm trying. - Yeah, well, try harder, sweet pea.
I'm pretty sure they're going to let me go soon.
well, they'd better, or you're going to end up like your fare.
love you, too, sweetheart.
thelma's really getting worried. - The route.
okay, so maybe I took the long way around.
what cabbie doesn't now and then? Report me to the commission.
I'll report myself to the commission. Tell me we're done.
tell me I can get my cab and go home to Thelma.
Abby's done with the taxi and he's been here all day.
call the front gate. - Thank you.
thank you...Thank you...Thank you...
just go home to your wife.
did I tell you Thelma and I am going to take a cruise to the Bahamas?
bingo. So how did it get there, Abigail?
what are we watching?
it's an NSA decryption program scanning all possible connections between people on the list.
there's a five and a three in all their social security numbers.
except for Farhan, who didn't have a social security card.
I have the numbers ree and five in mine. - Me, too.
that's it No other connections? - Nope.
no common churches, social clubs, schools, fraternities, nothing.
the only place these people ever met was in the obituaries.
pull up the full pages of the obituaries.
what do your eyes go to?
the photos. You think their names were randomly picked from the obits?
gives the appearance of a hit list.
the only one actually murdered was Farhan.
Why? - To distract us.
unless this foam grew legs, something weird is going on.
not that polyurethane foam growing legs isn't weird in the first ace, but, um, this is the foam that we found on the floor of the taxi, and this foam is exactly the same.
too late, he's gone.
speed it up. - 15's the limit.
never had my ass give me orders. - What?
main gate's coming up.
Hi, NCIS call about me? - They did, sir.
both hands on the wheel. - Ok, okay, whatever you say.
step out of the taxi.
hands on the wheel or steput? I can't do both.
guess.
Oh, man.
both hands on the hood. - What is this Baghdad?
Gibbs! Thank god you'reere.
tell these gyrines I can go.
clear. - Clear? It's empty.
front or back? - What?
whh seat? - Which seat? What are you talking about?
the accomplice you smuggled into the evidence lock-up.
accomplice?
Thelma looks like you when she's pissed, only she doesn't have a gun, thank god.
front or back? - Front, front.
name? - Mario Vincetti.
Mario! Special agent Gibbs. Come out.
slowly, hands first.
there's no sense in getting...
don't shoot. I'm coming out.
I said drive faster.
and to think I pitied a murderer.
murderer? That g was murdered?
I didn't know. I ain't no murderer.
mario told me the guy was a stiff they got from a funeral home. Tell them.
let Scoletti's lawyers do the talking, dummy.
scoletti's lawyers got us into this mess. - Shut up!
honest, I didn't know they killed the guy.
I was going to get ten grand, take Thelma on princess cruise to the Bahamas.
a second honeymoon.
we never had a first.
tell her enough with the evil eye. It reminds me of my mother.
you're comparing me to your mother.
just the eyes and maybe a little around the mouth.
permission to shoot?
and you come all the way from America to see my grandfather?
actually, I was in paris when I found out he was ill.
he is dying. This week, perhaps next.
lung cancer. - I'm sorry.
still, you must have flown half the day to get here.
I'm writing my father's biography.
he and the colon-general were close friends.
they were adversaries, yes?
Sometis adversaries make the best friends.
most days the morphine affects his memory.
let's hope this isn't one of them.
stuff the crocus. Do you have a cigarette?
cigarettes put you here. - Oh, what are they going to do?
kill me twice?
it appears to be a good day. I will find a vase.
do you have a cigarette?
your father and I swapped cuban cigars for american cigarettes.
like vodka.
it does not burn so much the second time.
you...did not come...
all this way to watch an old man die.
no.
I came for your signature.
W-what does it say?
that you verified the destruction of Warsaw pact weapons that were in fact acquired by an arms dealer known as La Grenouille.
are you angry at your father? - No.
why would you even think that?
that's a lie - Ask your father - My father was dead - When - 12 years ago
the old fox.
one last move in the game, huh?
my father has been dead since 95.
he stood where you stand...
three weeks ago, smoking a cigar.
that's why I always sit in back to avoid the little pre-boarders.
thank you so much for picking me up, Steph.
Trent's always working late.
been there, hate that.
I figure it's about time that I throw a little fit in case he's forgotten how I feel about it.
well, that sounds like he's working really hard, doesn't it?
Trent, turn it down.
what are you trying to do, wake the dead?
Hey, trent.
how's it go...
good morning, Gibbs.
did you get it? - It ?
I put this year's tax refund of good use.
I got one for everybody on team Gibbs.
Hey, boss.
sorry about that. Sinatra, you got to sing along.
I mean, it's Old Blue Eyes.
it's the chairman of the board. I'm gonna rat pack it up.
becoming an alpha male means that without saying a word you're able to project confidence and sexuality simply through your body language...
mit lecture.
nothing I can't listen to on my own time.
it's the newest version, Gibbs.
it's 80 gigabytes.
you could download like 20, 000 songs.
I only listen to five, Abs.
5, 000? - No.
five. - Oh, Gibbs.
we really have to broaden your horizons.
I could download some of my music for you.
like Android Lust or Flesh-eating Foundation, Green Satan, or Suicide Commando.
dead marine.
never heard of 'em.
fort Belvoir Army Base. Let's go.
dead marine.
army base.
her rocks matches his scissors.
which puts the Conel on top.
you work for me on this one, Jethro.
it's my army base and my crime scene.
and my people, my office.
they know we're still seeing each other?
is she... - Still on top?
seeing Gibbs?
same thing.
but an excellent question nonethess, probie.
marine Captain Trent Reynolds.
worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency on an inter-agency task force.
his, uh, wife found him last night when she got back from a convention in charlottesville.
Where's the wife now?
mother's house.
how long has he been, uh... stuck here?
only the dead know the true meaning of patience, Timothy.
no more places to go, people to see.
except me, of course.
Colonel, Jethro.
so, uh... to whom do I report?
her. - Me.
better get used to that.
spear guns.
pretty cool.
Thunderball. Very James Bond...
boss... Ma'am...colonel.
captain Reynolds was a recreational diver.
burglary?
well, the back door was jimmied, but the wallet and cash were still on him, and the wife doesn't think that anything's missing.
Dr. Mallard, you got anything?
you do realize I arrived about a minute ago.
the dead speak to me, Colonel, but give the poor man time to catch his breath, so to speak.
time of death-- between 7: 00 and 9: 00 P. M.
Yeah, Gibbs.
Tony, review the witness statements.
Yes, boss... ma'am...
uh, colonel.
I will check Captain Reynolds' phone and bank records.
agent McGee, see if you can pull some prints off the back door.
Yes, ma'am.
do you know a Major Sweigart?
major Sweigart was Captain Reynold's superior at Defense Intelligence.
he understands the army CID and NCIS will be working hand in hand on this case.
I mean... side by side.
cooperatively.
you've taken Captain Reynold's laptop.
I want it back.
that's evidence, Major.
dia deals with highly classified materials, ma'am.
and we have top secret clearance.
I'm talking about special access programs which go well beyond your clearance.
black ops?
major Sweigart, these are your options:
either read in our forensic scientist to your special access programs or send someone who can oversee her work.
send someone over from cyber.
Yes, sir.
any thoughts on who might have wanted to kill Captain Reynolds?
he got along with everyone at work.
what about his personal life?
other than the usual command dinners I didn't really know Captain Reynolds on a personal basis.
you, Lieutenant?
we played some pickup basketball together. That's about it.
I think he spent his free time with his wife.
Why?
because he was always rushing home to be with her.
crash and burn... only a matter of time.
what?
not a what-- a whom.
Colonel Mann, Gibbs, Army-Navy Joint Operation.
it could last a lifetime.
behind the torture techniques and the contract killings, Ziva, you're really just a...
a whom?
what? Whom?
not a whom... it's more...it's a what.
a what then?
what then?
uh, what? What then?
I'm still just a what?
a girl.
I was sent here to check in so I could see her.
probie.
Fred Rinnert, DIA.
that's Defense Intelligence Agency.
I was sent here to keep track of a laptop of ours.
laptop is down in the lab.
meaning, you will be scrutinizing her every move?
exactly.
I gotta warn you, Abby doesn't work well with people looking over her shoulder.
we'll do fine.
I'm a people person.
make him go away, McGee.
Abby, I can't.
look at him.
I feel blocked.
I can't work when I'm blocked.
well, then just block him out.
what? - You block him out.
he's not there. Say it.
he's not there.
he's still there.
close your eyes, open them, and imagine him gone.
didn't work.
try it again.
he's not there.
he's not there.
still not working, McGee.
try the return key . - This one?
well, here, let me.
no, I got it.
no, I don't think you do. - I got it.
sometimes it takes a soft touch, okay.
there.
uh, no.
no.
no, no.
no, no, no, no, no.
prints from Reynolds' back door scored a match, but your computer's a little...
it's linked to Abby's lab.
it's perfectly fine, Colonel.
which is more than can be said for Major Sweigart.
I dropped off some documents to Captain Reynolds' a couple of weeks ago.
and you left via the back door?
his wife was having friends around.
I didn't want to disturb them.
Mrs. Reynolds can verify that you were at the house?
don't know.
guess you'll he to ask her, ma'am.
means you saw what was hanging in his office.
sorry.
knew how to use it.
you look pretty handy with that speargun.
well, picture's worth a thousand words to a jury.
Yeah, or just one: Guilty.
lots of guys dive.
look, colonel, I was with someone last night.
a date.
she got a name?
we went to dinner.
name.
the woman who was with Mrs. Reynolds when she found him dead?
that's right.
Yeah.
you know her?
I was married to her.
we have a, a little issue.
we?
you, you want to tell her, Agent Gibbs?
no, not particularly.
is this issue going to involve lawyers?
it already did.
it's his ex-wife. She's a material witness.
and which ex would that be?
what number is she again?
second? - Third.
Oh, right.
you lived Europe with her for a while, Frankfurt.
Moscow.
two years? - One.
well, it's hard to live in moscow.
with anyone.
do you think he should divorce himself from this case, Colonel Mann?
no, no, ma'am.
nor do I.
I don't see a problem if you conduct the interview.
do you have a problem with Colonel Mann interviewing your ex-wife, Agent Gibbs?
do I have a choice?
no. - No.
problem solved.
what time did Major Sweigart arrive at your apartment?
uh, about 6: 30.
and leave?
about 10: 00.
Where's Gibbs?
I know you know he's my ex.
he's busy.
some things never change.
who do you think is prettier?
ex-wife nunber three or future ex-wife number four?
Colonel Mann is at a disadvantage because of her uniform.
tell me you are not trying to imagine her without her uniform, Tony.
how long have you known Agent Gibbs-- Major Sweigart?
eight months.
known Gibbs longer.
wedding bells?
I know how this works.
you're implying because I love Eric, I'm lying for him.
are you?
he's, he's watching, isn't he?
if you're going to have me interrogated, Jethro, at least do it yourself.
come on. You never could talk to me, could you?
well, that was then, this is now, so just get the hell in here!
feisty.
in an attractive kind of way.
got zip at Fort Belvoir, boss.
captain Reynolds got along with everyone.
no one heard thing last night.
I'm gonna go check those phone records.
I am going to help him.
interesting.
so you work off an image of Captain Reynolds' hard drive instead of the actual laptop.
sorry.
what are you doing?
imagining you talking to me. - The laptop is evidence.
it can't be touched, so we copy the hard drive and put the laptop back in the evidence locker.
any other questions? - No.
except did you see that sniffer?
sniffer?
Yeah, just back up a bit.
right there.
I've seen one of these.
looks like a dll file, right?
it is a dll file.
that's what it wants you to think.
it's actually an executable file.
it sniffs out stuff when you're not looking.
so is this file classified?
it's yours, free and clear.
so...
captain Reynolds was a hacker.
does it really matter what I made for dinner?
uh, chicken piccata, slightly overdone, steamed vegetables, slightly underdone, served with a chardonnay that was just right.
did he appear at all agitated? - No.
you having fun, Jethro?
still decaf?
we need to talk.
the colonel's conducting the interview.
I'm done.
why are you targeting my boyfriend?
you couldn't make me happy, so you won't let me be happy with someone else, is that it?
no.
then what are you doing?
what I've always had to do, Stephanie, my job.
can we at least finish one conversation?
I'm starting to feel like I'm married again. - Well, that's funny.
I never felt like we were ever married.
look, Eric didn't do this and I don't know what evidence you've got that makes you think he did, but you're wrong.
just don't screw this up for me, Jethro.
it's not about you.
well, it was never about me, was it?
uh, boss?
Abby needs to see us.
I'm just gonna...
I'm happy you found somebody.
I'll send an agent down to escort you out.
cyber guy here yet. - Yeah, in with Abby.
she'll be fine.
get out!
I'm serious.
so... the dead are strung up on a spit and roted?
Yeah, and then the tribe serves up the drippings.
so gross.
and you saw this?
saw what, Abs?
a death ritual that would make your hair stand up on end.
maybe not your hair but definily, say, McGee's hair.
Ah, what about our ritual? Solving crimes.
Fred found a sniffer.
it's a keystroke logger used by hackers to find passwords.
and you're never going to guess whose computer Captain Reynolds was hacking into.
well, just 'cause i said you'd never guess doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
major Eric Sweigart.
him again.
what was Reynolds accessing?
Sweigart's e-mails, which I still have to manually cut and paste.
do it, Abs.
well, I-I found something else.
captain Reynolds opened a file-share application at 7: 30 last night.
what's a file-share... - File-share application.
you share music, videos, other files, put 'em on the internet, anyone who wants to can copy 'em.
7: 30 is about the time of death.
but what's weird is...
the song.
drumroll, please.
the elements song.
a song about the weather?
no, no, no, it recites all the elements.
it's a comic ditty written by a Harvard math professor in the late 50s.
it's really catchy...
well, Abby, maybe if you play it, you'll...
there's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrog and rhenium and nickel, neodymium, neptunium, gernium and iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium and lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium and gold and protactinium and indium and gallium...
he has access to the nation's secrets and he's file-sharing that song just before he dies?
Why?
Abby's going to find out.
Yes, because neither rain nor sleet nor any class of simple atomic substance will keep me from my appointed duty, sir.
sweet.
you know, when I was in the sixth grade,
I made a complete periodic table out of licorice and junior mints.
cool.
Yeah, that's... impressive, McGee.
that must have been extremely awkward for all concerned.
so what happened between them?
you know, a man's heart often tells us how he lived.
sometimes...
it might even tell us how he died, but contrary to popular myth, it never tells us how he loved.
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to put you on the spot.
you won't find a better man than Jethro.
he's a fiercely loyal colleague and friend, but he does come with his challenges.
tell me about it.
there's a part of him I...
I don't know, I mean, he just shuts me out.
I thought maybe it was Stephanie or their marriage...
they weren't married long.
fourteen months.
top of my class in interrogation.
remind me to ask for a highly qualified lawyer should I ever be interrogated by you.
I don't want to be another one of his mistakes, ducky.
I know he's been married three times.
more than three times?
perhaps I should get that lawyer now.
uh, divorced three times, married four.
Jethro's married?
heavens no.
well, then, I don't...
his first wife, along with his only child.
Oh, my god...
he-he named the boat Kelly.
after his daughter.
she was eight years old.
what happened?
I think you should ask Jethro that.
his wife witnessed a murder.
she identified the shooter.
he came after her.
what was her name?
results, duck?
uh, Captain Reynolds' cause of death was relatively straightforward, but I did find something else.
on his cheeks, we found a residue of prolactin and lysozyme.
tears, Jethro.
captain Reynolds was crying when he died.
uh, checked reynolds' phone records, boss.
Colonel, uh, ma'am...
uh, I drew a blank.
so we checked Major Sweigart' phone records.
ten calls in the last three days to the same person...
a woman.
Stephanie? - No.
Jill, Captain Reynolds' wife.
the husband, the wife and the lover.
all the trademarks of a classic love triangle.
you forgot the lover's lover, which would make I technically,
I think, a lovers quadrangle or it could be a ring.
Abby uncovered suspicious activity on the victim's laptop.
and since Captain Reynoldsd had access to highly classified defense secrets, we cannot rule out a spy ring.
and we know that Major Sweigart was with your ex...
with, uh... Stephanie Flynn.
and Mrs. Reynolds was at a pharmaceutical convention in Charlottesville.
Charlottesville.
Yes, charlottesville.
great minds think alike, McGee.
fort Belvoir, where Reynolds died, is here.
Charlottesville is here, 104 miles.
two hour drive.
close enough for Jill Reynolds to drive home, kill her husband, drive back to charlottesville, and fly home again to discover him dead with witness present.
that does not mean she did it.
it doesn't mean she didn't do it.
motive?
DiNozzo, check... - Life iurance. Did it, 400 grand from the military, another quarter mill from a private carrier, beneficiary: Jill Reynolds.
the crime scene just became our prime suspect's house.
get a warrant.
Mrs. Reynolds?
we'll bring her in.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
I hope so.
steganography.
not even close.
if the song has a meaning, then the meaning is probably hidden inside a file.
what's the most sophisticated way to hide a file in a computer?
steganography.
now you're thinking what I'm thinking.
Yeah, but I was enjoying thinking what I was thinking before you asked me what I was thinking.
would I have enjoyed what you were thinking?
don't answer that.
I developed a program to search for any steganography algorithm.
if there's a stego file on there, this puppy will find it.
you're good.
please hey! You ever feel like you could use some extra help around here?
I work like 16 hours a day.
whoa, that's like two eight-hour days stuck together.
Yup.
it's probably not the budget, and, um...
I'm kind of a control freak.
I work for two control freaks, neither of whom are as smart as you.
I'm not that smart.
Oh, please.
I'm not.
I'm not.
password cracker?
password cracker.
you're going to tell me?
tell you what?
what's bugging you.
how long have we been together?
week - months.
meaning many weeks.
we've shared a lot, right? - Yeah.
divorced three times.
I told you that.
married four.
you never told me about your first wife, Shannon.
or that you had a daughter, Kelly.
why, Jethro?
they're dead.
end of story.
I've put it behind me.
have you?
Hey, anything from those ATMs in Charlottesville?
Oh, not yet, boss.
I was thinking, boss.
now, you know that Abby and I have solved a lot of computer probls together, and it seems to me that, you know, three heads are better than two.
and seeing as how the periodic table is, you know, in my wheelhouse...
it seems...
I...
I was thinking it would probably be best if I just stay here, focus on my job and let...
Yeah, that's a good call.
Abby focus on hers.
you know, colonel, guys like fred-- they're a dime a dozen at MIT.
charming, funny, successful, good-looking.
women see right through that.
exactly.
excuse us there.
NCIS, we are looking for Jill Reynolds.
she's in the back.
you a friend?
lieutenant Marsden.
command sent me out to go over Captain Reynolds' death benefits with her.
quite the waterfall.
she means windfall.
if you think money compensates for the loss of a loved one.
no.
no, I'm sure it doesn't.
excuse me.
NCIS. Mrs. Reynolds?
in here.
cleaning is kind of therapeutic for me.
give it to me, baby, come on.
don't make me beg.
Hey, McGee.
everything okay? - Yeah.
I'm still running a password cracker.
Hey, I, uh, brought you a...
Caf-POW!
this is a monumental task, McGee.
I mean, the keyboard doesn't just have number it has the whole alphabet.
could be case-sensitive.
or you could take 1000 years to go through all the possible permutations.
well, you know, the more complicated the password, the bigger the need to keep some record of it.
nice try, McGee, but we already looked for it in the copy of his hard drive.
but not in the actual laptop.
it could be hidden in a secret partition of ram.
that's brilliant!
I'm going to go get the laptop out of the evidence locker.
these have quite a kick, don't they?
Oh, I down six or seven of these bad boys a day.
there's a serious conflict here.
Jethro shouldn't be leading this investigation.
he's not.
Colonel Mann is.
you pick up that look from Gibbs?
I picked up a lot of bad habits from Gibbs.
I understand your concern.
then take him off the case.
I've known Agent Gibbs a long time.
I trust and respect his judgment.
my boyfriend didn't kill anyone.
then I'm sure the investigation will bear that out.
maybe not before damaging Eric's military career.
if Major Sweigart wasn't involved,
I'll personally see to it that he suffers no career repercussions.
thank you.
can I ask you a personal question?
I don't quite know how to put this, but I always had this feeling that before our marriage, there was something between you and Jethro.
it has always been strictly professional between us.
she's got something to hide.
why else would she clean so thoroughly?
train wreck.
I want to look away, but I can't.
agent Gibbs?
director.
Colonel, I was just reassuring Gibbs'...your witness that Agent Gibbs could separate himself from the personal aspects of this investigation
well, I'll monitor him, closely, dector.
I'm sure you will.
is that the look you're talking about?
Yeah, that's it.
Yup, we've all seen that one.
well, Miss Flynn was just leaving, unless you need her for something.
no. She can go home.
for now.
you find anything, Dinozzo?
I bet you've never been happier to see me, boss.
uh, it was clean. - Spotless.
she's like that professional cleaner in pulp fiction.
we found a partial print in the kitchen near the office.
Yeah. Run it.
well, I mean, with only, like, a squiggle on a little loop.
we don't even know which finger.
only ten possibilities, Dinozzo.
well, no. There's one point, there's ten fingers.
you know, that's thousands of... on it.
train wreck.
why have you kept me waiting?
give you time to think.
I don't... want to think.
I want to clean.
we know about your affair with Major Sweigart.
your husband knew, too.
he didn't.
listen, he hacked into Major Sweigart's e-mails.
read everything you ever wrote to each other.
he was crying when he died.
we also know about the life insurance.
650, 000 reasons not to want a divorce.
I don't care about the money.
wait. You think that...
look, my marriage wasn't good, but I would never, ever...
I told you, I was at a conference in Charlottesville.
all you have to do is check.
we did.
I signed in.
and you slipped out.
came home, killed your husband, drove back.
No!
you want to clean?
you clean your conscience, you tell the truth.
I am! - You're not!
what?
we'll be right there.
I've been watching the footage of ATMs surrounding the pharmaceutical convention in Charlottesville on the day Captain Reynolds died.
as you can see, it's time-stamped.
check out the brunette.
no. In the background rounding the corner.
wait for it.
there!
can't be two places at once.
she's clean in more ways than one.
maybe she hired a contract killer.
what about the partial prints in Reynolds' kitchen?
came up with 80, 000 potential hits.
I know.
trying to narrow it down to people who might have had access to the army base.
have we given up on Major Sweigart?
he has an alibi.
from someone who thinks he's her future husband.
Stephanie wouldn't lie.
are you sure?
well, I'm not.
I mean, finds out that her boyfriend was having an affair with her best friend, she might just change her story.
bring her in for another interview.
wait.
I said bring her in.
and I said wait.
this never turns out well for the kids.
can you be objective here?
because if you can't, you're no good to me.
if this wasn't your ex, what would your gut be saying right now?
it would be saying bring her in and break her.
maybe she's lying to protect her boyfriend.
maybe it's worse.
what if Stephanie knew about the affair?
she'd walk?
okay, then let's talk about motive.
maybe she wants to frame Jill for being the bitch who stole her boyfriend.
or maybe Major Sweigart for cheating on her.
you don'know Stephanie.
but I do know my job.
here I am, boss.
call her.
tell her to come in.
I need to talk with her.
voicemail.
same thing.
this is Special Agent Anthony Dinozzo of NCIS for Stephanie Flynn.
as of when?
thank you.
Stephanie quit her job this morning.
Pow!
another one?
I found a program on Captain Reynolds' boot-up sequence.
guess what it does.
judging by your expression, something good.
it creates the password when you turn the computer on, and it deletes it when you turn it off.
hidden in ram.
you know what?
if I weren't so irrationally confident,
I might actually be intimidated by you.
please.
okay, so it's 30 characters.
that's too many for a password cracker.
here we go.
that was really anticlimactic.
okay, so...
the file extension indicates it's an audio plug-in file.
last accessed...
at 7: 31 P. M. On monday.
that's the same time Captain Reynolds uploaded the song.
that's the same time he died, give or take a chorus.
let's see what the plug-in does with the song.
Selenium...
uranium...
gallium...
phosphorus potassium...polonium...
curium...
sodium.
the plug-in is just a filter
it highlights pieces of the song.
it's a code.
it's not a code.
it's just words, Abby.
it's not just words, Fred.
it's numbers.
every element has a corresponding number on the periodic table.
selenium is 34, uranium 92, and gallium 31.
Abby's office.
Yeah. She's right here.
I could... okay.
no. I'll tell her, sir.
your boss wants to see you.
he has this uncanny ability to know when I found something.
I don't even know what I found yet.
well, he didn't seem happy.
Oh, no, no, no.
he never does, even when he is happy.
and I doubt he's happy right now.
but, you know, I am his favorite, so he's usually pretty good with me.
even when you keep him waiting?
I'll be right back.
hurry up.
try her again.
I'm here, Gibbs.
Abby... - Wait!
selenium, uranium, gallium, phosphorus potassium, polonium, curium and sodium.
it's the song, Gibbs!
there was a program on Captain Reynolds' laptop that highliged these elements.
the periodic table has a number associated with each one.
I think the numbers mean something, I just don't know what yet.
like 34 could three-four...
92 could be nine-two.
could be a GPS coordinate.
or a bank account.
I just need to know how you knew that I found something.
I didn't, Abby.
Stephanie's still not answerin well, why did you call me?
I didn't.
Fred said you did.
boss, guess who was one of the 88, 000 hits from the crime scene fingerprints.
Fred. - You guessed.
where is he? - In my lab.
with evidence? - With the laptop!
find out what this means, McGee.
Hey, going somewhere?
home.
tell me you didn't.
didn't what?
uh, you know, I think we had a power surge.
data UNRECOVERABLE NO RECOMENDATIONS
they're wiped clean.
the original laptop?
I did not leave this open.
you wiped it, too!
Abby, I'm hurt!
you think I did this?
Gibbs, can I hit him?
no.
look, anybody could have done it.
the lab was left unattended, right, Abby?
unless you're going to arrest me, I've got a date with my pilates instructor.
Hey, what are you doing?
last number dialed, my lab.
Yeah, so, could've misdialed.
the last e-mail.
confirmed for a flight on Thai air.
why did you erase the hard drives?
didn't.
whato the numbers mean?
not a clue.
dia deals with classified material.
you find a foreign buyer?
you have to go up, in order to go down, right?
can I hit him now, Gibbs?
no.
you think Reynolds could have set up that computer code?
only an expert could have done it.
Reynolds had access to the secrets, you knew how to steal them.
are we gonna find some money stashed away?
if you've got the evidence, arrest me.
if not... have a nice day.
lieutenant Marsden just confirmed that our friend here volunteered to oversee Abby's work on the laptop.
why didn't you wipe the hard drive after you killed him?
cause he didn't think anyone was smart enough to find the code, until it was sent to me.
I didn't kill anyone.
either Reynolds wouldn't split the money with you or you got greedy.
think of the slimiest thing and that's what he did!
come on, McGee!
Hey, I know my rights.
boss, I got it.
numbers are an offshore account in the names of both Captain Reynolds and Fred Rinnert.
one half-million dollars transferred into the account from a bank in Beirut at 7: 30 the night Reynolds died.
it was cleaned out two hours later.
so, it was greed, huh?
my acting boss says you ain't going anywhere.
What'd you sell? Who'd you sell it to?
maybe if you cut me a deal, I'll tell you.
sweet.
Why?
why is it that a romantic night on the town always turns into a less than romantic night in your basement, sanding...your boat.
Hello, stephanie.
still not locking your front door, Jethro.
sweet.
I-I just came to, um...
give you these.
I found them in a drawer about six years ago.
I thought I'd lost them.
I'm gonna, um...
wait for you upstairs. - No, no...it's okay.
I'm... I'm not staying. So...
I'll walk you out.
good luck.
Thanks.
why'd you quit your job?
I'm, uh, I'm moving to Philadelphia.
my parents are getting old.
and, uh, shelley had a baby.
another one?
she's a baby factory.
it's a good thing someone in my family is.
I guess I'm gonna be that doting aunt that still looks great in her bikini.
Eric and I split up.
he told me about his affair with, uh, with Jill.
you knew.
after all my ranting in your office, you miss a perfect opportunity to throw that in my face.
I wouldn't do that you.
no, you wouldn't.
you said it never seems to work out for me, Jethro.
I'm sorry.
me. Us. Not your fault.
wasn't anybody's fault.
well, we'll always have Moscow.
Jethro, you never cease to surprise me.
music.
what do you think, daddy?
I came in second place.
you would have been proud of her, Jethro.
I miss you, daddy!
when you get home, I'll be really good at it, promise.
I love you.
a kiss for daddy.
love you, daddy... love you.
now although this gentleman died a natural death, he gave his cadaver to further your education, so pay attention to what he has to tell us.
now, the brain.
now, inside, you will see the delicate structures and pathways that determine memories, emotions, basic motor functions.
in sum, who we are.
Mr. Palmer, would you cradle the brain while I sever this...?
lieutenant Greer, the four lobes of the cerebrum?
um, it's the frontal, the parietal, occipital and temporal.
the adult human weighs approximately.
feels like a soggy grapefruit.
Yes. Well, uh, pass it around.
now, don't let its small size fool you.
the cerebral cortex contains one billion neurons and one million, billion connections。If-If you were to count one synapse per second, you wouldn't finish counting for 32 million years.
doctor, is this natural?
certainly not.
what the hell is that?
DUCKY: This, my dear lieutenant...
...is murder.
ZIVA: Not bad.
all right, look at this one.
you're going to love this guy.
yeah
I would eat him.
he's so adorable. How can you say no to that face?
please tell me you're looking for a man for Ziva.
not me. Oh.
McGoo, is there something you want to tell me?
looking at animal rescue sites.
McGee's thinking about getting a puppy.
puppy's a lot of work-- you got to feed it, walk it, train it.
Yeah. I'm not 12, all right?
I work hard. I deserve someone who will jump up all excited when I get home, you know?
lay on the couch, watch TV.
maybe lick my face a little bit.
might be easier getting a girlfriend. Oh!
which might be even easier with a puppy.
even for you.
I'm not ready to start taking tips from you on this yet, probie.
Tony, I think it's time you get back on that horse.
are you getting a pony? It's an adage.
I am not familiar with that breed.
Yeah, well, they are quite rare.
sort of a cross between a Pegasus and a unicorn.
so, who's the favorite?
the pit bull.
Oh. Yeah, that makes sense for you, actually.
not really for McGee.
he's more of a spaniel.
cocker, maybe?
how about an Australian Shepherd?
Oh.
they're working dogs.
pick it up, DiNozzo. On it, boss.
A. F.I. P. Smooth things over.
please hold.
what did we do to incur the wrath of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology?
Ducky kept one of their cadavers.
Ducky stole a cadaver?
I'm sure he had a good reason.
I hope so.
sit.
stay.
roll over.
it's absolutely ridiculous, Jethro.
this man's body should never have been donated to science.
too late for a refund.
he was murdered, Jethro, with an injection of mercury into his brain.
a liquid bullet.
Mr. Palmer is presently endeavoring to reach the M. E. who made such a grievous oversight.
still no answer, Doctor.
then redial, Mr. Palmer.
Yes.
unidentified, African-American male, approximately 50 years old, blood-alcohol level zero point one-two.
official cause of death-- asphyxiation from the deceased's own vomit.
however, here's the kicker.
they elected not to perform an autopsy.
Jimmy: But it would be pretty hard to find a pinprick hole in the base of a skull.
and heavy metals wouldn't show on a tox screen unless you're looking for them specifically.
Mr. Palmer, do not defend the inefficiin of others.
GIBBS: I'm not sure you can just take control of a body, Duck.
well, someone has to.
I mean, based on preliminary findings, County Police determined that he was a nameless drifter.
a John Doe.
had too much to drink and died in his sleep.
some people live their whole lives off the grid.
no, not our man.
I'd wager that he spent several years in prison.
Yeah, it's elementary, my dear Jethro.
the proliferation of scar tissue on his body.
Cigarette-sized burns.
our John Doe led a violent life.
Yes, well, this long scar on his left leg is surgical.
however, it healed poorly.
suggests prison-caliber medical treatment.
and the tattooing.
pen ink. Jailhouse style.
DUCKY: Yes. Perhaps we can get Abby to shed some light on this pattern.
it's her area of expertise.
a John Doe.
I mean, it's ridiculous.
it can't be that difficult to locate a prison record.
somebody must actually care that this man is dead.
well?
did you locate the M. E?
Oh. Therein lies the problem.
people are just not willing to do the legwork.
he had a murder victim right in front of him, classroom full of military students.
I think he might be a bit embarrassed.
excellent detective work.
DUCKY: I hope your opinion of me doesn't waver after I've given this fellow. Never.
I warn you, this might get ugly.
I'm looking for Dr. Jordan Hampton.
huh. You found her.
uh, is there something wrong with your telephone?
wouldn't know.
I don't answer it.
too many bodies, and not enough time.
special Agent Gibbs, uh, Dr. Donald Mallard. NCIS.
pleasure. I assume you're not here to check on my phone.
DUCKY: Perhaps you'd have a moment to discuss a John Doe that crossed your table
remember the body?
Ah, I remember every body.
50-something black male found DOA on Highland Pier.
aspirated on his own vomit.
I assume you kept him the requisite 72 hours.
no one made any inquiries.
day two of his stay,
I caught a priority triple homicide.
day four, Anatomy Board picked him up.
you needed the space.
not a whole lot of elbow room.
where he went after that, I can't say.
A. F.I. P. and then, our autopsy suite.
hmm.
GIBBS: We're investigating his death as a homicide.
damn it.
I missed something.
DUCKY: An injection of mercury into his brain between the first vertebra and the occipital bone.
police tried and failed to I. D. him.
AFIS database and dental record searores-- they came up empty.
GIBBS: DNA?
now, I'm not sure how it goes at N. C.I. S. but around here, that takes about six months.
never canvassed the scene.
: sadly, most cops I know
they prefer to hear, "case closed
than look for a reason to open one.
it's not the first time someone's slipped through the cracth
well, I'm glad you caught him, Dr. Mallard.
as am I.
Yeah, I hope she recovers from that tongue-lashing.
what did you find under the pier?
uh, 85 cents, two batteries and a bottle cap.
no mercury, no needle.
GIBBS: Keep looking.
got to find someone who knew him.
highland Beach in October.
not much of a tourist draw.
soft-shell crab season's almost over.
people really like boats that much?
you work for the Navy, DiNozzo.
maybe we should start with this waitress.
eating or asking questions?
if you were hoping for subtle, you could have lost the guns.
or at least the hats.
uh, excuse me.
I'd just like to show you a photo, see if, uh, you recognize this man.
okay.
you trying to build suspense?
no.
um, it's just that the man in the photo is dead, and, uh, some people find that shocking.
Oh. Thanks for being gentle.
I'm a gentle man.
uh, never seen him.
uh, so, the waitress,
miss Shannon O'Hara, remembers our guy.
never got a name, paid cash, big tipper.
how about your biker gang there?
Oh, they're just passing through.
that's it?
Yeah, they don't like cops much.
check at the table.
good eye, boss.
I'll tell you, my radar is just totally shot.
she's smokin'.
that's not what you meant.
you were suggesting that she seems interested in our presence, maybe a little too interested, and that I should question her.
not a problem.
Mm.
that's a problem.
Oh, excuse me. No, excuse me.
McGee: Mind if we ask where you're going in such a hurry?
what business is it of NCIS?
Tony: We're looking for anyone
he's dead.
you know him?
his name's Marvin Hinton.
he was with me.
and you are?
careful.
I was just reaching for my I. D.
special Agent Courtney Krieger.
Hinton was working for the FBI.
Hey, Gibbs, need a refill? I'm going.
well, yeah, Betro. Thanks, make it a double.
you got it.
McGee: Still can't find any record of Marvin Hinton.
and you won't. Marvin Hinton doesn't exist anymore.
anymore? His cellmates swear Marvin Hinton served six years at Cumberland, although any record of it vanished when he was released last month.
we had to reassemble his history by hand; it's not complete.
he once went by the name Frederick LeClair.
bootlegging, false I. D.s, resisting arrest, theft.
the guy's a career felon.
Interstate trafficking, primarily.
how did he show up on your radar?
was a routine tip.
end him up offloading stolen cargo containers.
at which point, you discover a nameless man whose entire history's been erased.
no fingerprints, no criminal record.
not even a high school transcript.
that's impossible, you'd need first-person access Jederal mainframe, crit ratings, countless private companies.
that'd be like taking spit out of the ocean.
how did he do it?
claimed he didn't.
said he was contacted by someone offering the service.
the Eraser.
what movie is that from?
I don't know, Flashdance?
why was Hinton not back in prison?
he was a small fish, but the eraser...
he's our real target.
we hoped he would contact Hinton.
provide Hinton with a new identity.
exactly.
I was left to baby-sit.
it was my first field assignment.
never expected him to be killed.
that is what happens to bait.
Hey, it's not your fault.
McGee: So why didn't Hinton skip town
he was having too good a time on the government expense account.
but we did have him under 24-hour monitoring, three-team shifts.
what changed?
the eraser didn't make contact.
they pulled my surveillance team to chase other leads.
you notify your boss.
we need to know everything you know.
the Bureau set Hinton up here?
to maintain the appearance he was flush.
anyone else have their own key?
no, we met here weekly so no one would see us together.
but he knew it could be dangerous.
wow, forget the puppy, McGee.
a place like this is what you need to score with the chicks.
here.
boss, this could be the murder weapon: mercury.
positive for blood.
Ooh, fluids.
no surprise there.
six years in prison.
KRIEGER: The eraser made the initial contact at the Crab Shack.
not face to face.
no, slipped him a note.
so, you sent Hinton back, hoping for another one.
well, Hinton was supposed toeep a record of anyone he came in contact with.
I was running background checks, chasing down his leads.
I was waiting for anything new.
you got your wish.
your first crime scene.
he was killed in that room.
this is why I love you guys.
you bring me hair, you bring me blood, you bring me fluids.
and mercury.
predictable, yet constantly surprising.
we try.
of course, mercury is toxic, so you shouldn't let kids break open thermometers and play with it.
speaking from personal experience, Abs?
actually explains a lot.
you want it, but it kills you.
it's like a metaphor.
it's a cigarette.
or chocolate for dogs.
by the way,
I like the dachshund for you.
you could name him Mercury.
this mercury, Abby.
industrial grade, commonly used in heavy machinery, although it's fallen out of favor because of the fear factor.
a lot of it's being dropped on developing nations like India.
where exporting/dumping has become a major revenue stream.
anyways, um, this is what killed our painted man.
speaking of which...
I've seen a lot of great skin art done with a ballpoint pen and a needle.
like this and this.
very nice.
but this guy's tattoo, it's a mess.
the symbols are gibberish, the pattern's haphazard.
it's a puzzle.
it puzzles me, Gibbs.
I'm determined to solve it.
hair samples. Not nearly as interesting.
six different women.
Hinton had a lot of girlfriends. One's a bleach blonde.
one's auburn from a bottle-- if you want to know anything else, you have to find me something to match it against.
man: Delivery for Tony.
Hey, how are you?
good, thanks.
whoa.
here you go.
thank you. Have a good night.
I... Keep the change.
Portobello mushroom, no tomato.
Philly cheese steak, extra steak, extra cheese.
these are all Hinton's contacts.
ha, can't help but notice they're all women.
what made him think the eraser was a woman?
I don't know that he did.
well...
cause you know, you said he was enjoying himself.
Y-you...
you have mushroom in your teeth.
Where's your bathroom?
Ah, I will show you where it is.
Hey, so I've been thinking about the murder.
why kill him that way?
I mean, an injection into the brain.
definitely not the most common method.
to find out "why" ,"must ask "who.
someone tidy.
someone who doesn't like messes.
you have a theory?
someone who needs to be, someone who does not like.
Ziva, what are you doing?
uh, I'm not an expert here, but I'm pretty sure it is not against the law.
the woman's code.
McGee, I bet you if we take a strand of her hair, it will match the sample from Hinton's condo.
well, of course it would.
she's already said she been there every week.
this woman is uptight.
not even a single strand.
we will have to go to the source.
Ziva, no hair pulling. She's the only one that was in contact with Hinton.
it would have been easy for her to just sweep him under the rug.
motive?
she's ambitious.
he became too much of a complication.
when someone's that uptight, it's only a matter of time before they...
snap. Okay.
you don't like her.
do you?
I understand what she's going through.
I remember what it was like to be green, afraid you're going to mess up.
which she did.
so what, you want to rub it in?
come on, Ziva, I think she deserves a little sympathy.
Tony seems to like her.
I do not think Gibbs does.
who do you work for, Tobias?
homeland Security or the FBI?
the world's on my shoulders, Gibbs.
world made of paper.
just throw that anywhere.
kind of defeats the purpose of e-mail when you have to print it all out for the file anyway. Yeah.
that's why I don't use it. Really?
not because you can't figure out how to work it?
I spend most of my time now coordinating the flow of information.
what can I give you?
your opinion on Special Agent Courtney Krieger.
promising.
does everything by the book, but the book doesn't show very much imagination.
definitely a child of the electronic age.
currently running a low-level asset in Highland Beach.
asset named Hinton.
okay, what am I missing?
fact he was murdered.
Marvin Hinton is dead?
I told her to notify you.
you've got to be kidding me.
she sent an e-mail.
it went in my spam folder.
this is serious, Gibbs.
alive, Hinton was just an ex-con who made a deal with the devil.
dead means the devil came to collect.
devil have a name?
that's just about all he's got.
you ever heard of Kamal Konkani?
built his reputation in the early 90s manufacturing false I. D.s for IRA bombers.
moved around Europe one step ahead of the authorities for the next ten years.
been invisible since the millennium.
he made a fortune working for terrorists.
Hinton wasn't a terrorist.
the game has changed in a decade.
documents are more sophisticated, electronic tracking, facial recognition.
we think Kamal was using Hinton as a test.
a test? For what?
homeland picked up chatter from a training facility in Libya.
a terrorist cell with assurances of clean entry onto U. S. soil.
assurances from Kamal Konkani.
and with Hinton dead... The only eyes
you're telling me that there are terrorists on the way here and they could be anyone?
how did this start?
with a dead man named Marvin Hinton aka Frederick LeClair.
an ex-con looking for a new identity.
a wish your eraser was more than happy to accommodate.
my boss looks mad.
he's going to chew you up.
out. Chew you out.
maybe not, maybe he's one of those silent killer types.
SHEPARD: What do you know about this eraser?
believed to be a Pakistani national raised in India and England.
made his name working with terrorists.
clean I. D.s, easy transit.
FORNELL: Facilitated Basque terror attacks in Spain, IRA bombings in England.
the GIA bombing in France in 1995.
SHEPARD: Killed eight, wounded hundreds, led by Khaled Kelkal.
french authorities identified the man who made it possible as Kamal Konkani.
Tony: That's a lot of "K's.
K's are funny.
agent Krieger.
you ever see The SunshineBoys? Shh!
but they weren't able to put a face to the name before he disappeared off the radar.
SHEPARD: Apparently, he's relocated to Maryland.
upgraded his system for taking people off the grid.
FORNELL: We were tipped off to Hinton.
so it's possible that Kamal dropped the dime himself to test his work.
his work seems impeccable.
now he's covering his tracks.
and shopping the service to terrorists overseas.
I'll monitor the situation in the training camps, watch closely for any movement.
I suggest you pick up Kamal's trail on this end.
no trace. No face.
this ought to be easy.
special Agent Krieger. A word.
ZIVA: According to his Interpol,
Kamal rarely ventures out of his safe house once it is established.
style's cloak-and-dagger.
low-tech.
no cell phone, no electronic messages. Smart.
he prefers to pass notes.
the Bureau provided several intercepted by the French 12 years ago.
coded. Abby has them now.
FORNELL: I don't give a flying crap what it states in the handbook!
you don't know enough to make a decision on your own!
that was long overdue.
what have you got against her?
I do not like cleaning up after other people.
it is very clear what you would like to have against her.
excuse me?
you want to sleep with her.
I...
well, so...
what if I do?
same old Tony.
I thought the new Tony wanted something more.
a real relationship.
I was pretending to be someone else.
Yeah, you could have fooled me.
I thought you had grown.
I'm not particularly interested in outgrowing sex.
sure it would be nice, Tony.
but it would be meaningless.
empty.
it would be wrong for you.
she's a pretty girl, but she's just a girl.
the man you were becoming needs a woman.
at least I thought he did.
you believe that?
an e-mail!
perhaps we're looking at this tattoo from the wrong angle.
I've manipulated the image every way I can.
I've inverted it. I've shrunk it.
I've stretched it.
I can't figure it out.
Oh, gonna have to mute ya, Duck.
no, wait. Nothing personal.
it-it's very peculiar...
you got something on the tattoo?
it's a work in progress, but...
I did find out something about the notes that the FBI got from Kamal.
FBI code-breakers couldn't make anything of the language.
no, neither could I.
but the paper that the notes are written on, it has a curve, so it came off of some sort of spool.
cash register receipt.
and Major Mass Spec had a field day makki ki roti and sarson ka saag.
Maize-flour bread and mustard-leaf sauce. Mmm.
goes nice with a glass of lassi.
indian food.
punjab, to be specific.
Kamal likes his home cooking.
might add to his profile.
it's good work.
gonna have to mute you, Gibbs.
don't say 'good work.'
not till I figure out the riddle of the tattoo.
Ziva, can I ask you a question?
isn't it hard being the only woman on the team?
no. God,
I wish I had your confidence.
well, it comes from experience.
well, the way I'm going, that's something I'll never get.
look, Courtney, they obviously saw something valuable in you, otherwise you would not have made it this far.
thank you. But...
stop trying to be perfect.
you will mess up.
and occasionally you will take a beating.
and then what?
then, you know the expression 'you get back on the horse'?
I competed in equestrian.
show jumping mostly.
Oh.
my uncle bred Arabians.
Oh.
do we hug now?
McGee: Assuming he still likes home cooking, there are 15 Indian restaurants within a ten-mile radius of Highland Beach.
Kamal doesn't travel.
confine the search to walking distance.
there's only one in the vicinity Punjab Tandoori.
man's gotta eat.
we know he's been in the area.
if he's using the same M. O. passing notes;
who's he handing 'em to? Any chance he's got people from the old country working on this side? Makes that restaurant the perfect place to hang out if he does.
slim chance he could be at the restaurant himself. Let's keep this one low-key when we go to scope it out.
have to go in undercover.
Hi. Table for two, please. Right this way.
looks like a nice place, doesn't it, honey? Mm-hmm.
sure does, sweet cheeks.
hold it steady, I'm gonna zoom in.
on the waiter, DiNozzo.
our specials this evening are the masala chops and the lobia curry.
the lobia is my personal favorite. And freeze.
here are the menus and I'll be right back to take your order.
facial I. D. should only take a second here.
unless he has been erased.
married father of three.
resident since 1987, legal citizen since 1999.
seems clean.
Courtney, can you get an angle on the kitchen staff.
she looks tense.
think maybe it should be you in there?
I think she'll do fine.
act natural.
just a normal date.
can I tell you a secret?
it's been a while.
Tony: Yeah.
me, too.
well, work comes first.
just pretend you like me.
that's not too hard to do.
Tony: You have really soft hands.
how is it going, Tony?
whoa.
I'm so sorry.
no, I... ah.
it's okay.
good thing we didn't put the mic in his pants.
I'm just gonna go clean this up.
not quite how I remember dating.
McGee: Feels about par for the course.
sorry. Sorry, man.
excuse me.
didn't get a good look at the delivery boy.
well, looks like they keep him busy.
maybe Kamal gets take-out.
cross-checking the addresses.
can I help you, sir?
Yeah.
can we get our food to go?
because my girlfriend and...
waiter: Ah.
I understand.
very naughty.
stop. Third on the list.
it's a rend apartment.
look at the name.
Yeah.
I see him.
to a Frederick LeClaire.
that's a name our dead guy's used before.
dead guys don't eat.
Yeah. So who's using it now?
we can't be this lucky.
let him make the drop first, Ziva.
Yes, Gibbs. Standing by.
okay, take him.
ZIVA: Moving in.
Hi. I was wondering if you could help us.
I'm a bit lost.
where are you, uh...?
what the he...? Ow!
what the hell's going on?
just dinner.
the door?
allow me.
clear.
ZIVA: Clear.
clear
nobody here.
this is Kamal's place.
Yeah, or it was.
can't have gone far.
GIBBS: Where's the guy who lives here?
how would I know? I just deliver the food.
how's he going to eat if he's not home?
it's a standing dinner order.
I drop off his meal every afternoon, and he pays two weeks in advance.
so you've seen him? Yeah.
once. Gave me a-a big wad of cash and a... and a good tip.
can you describe him?
okay, I ess.
uh...
older black guy, about my height, maybe-maybe a little taller.
what about this guy-- you seen him before?
is this a trick question?
that is the guy who lives here.
our dead guy's our bad guy.
then who killed him?
25 years old.
no aliases, no priors.
no passport. According to his W-4, he's been working at the restaurant six months.
if you believe everything on paper.
how much longer are we going to do this?
anxious to get out?
wasn't planning on spending the night in custody.
I have a term paper due tomorrow.
grad student in electrical engineering.
solid B-minus average.
you grew up in Hagerstown.
is it a nice neighborhood?
my parents were working class.
I've had jobs since I was 13 and I've had to work twice as hard as the silver spoons to get where I am.
the delivery boy.
what did I do wrong?
was there something in the package?
drugs?
McGee: He could still be a courier and not know it.
he delivers information in to-go boxes.
returns with cash that contains the reply.
and someone else at the restaurant sends on instructions to prospective clients, tucked in a meal.
it doesn't matter how he did it.
Hinton played you.
he was the eraser all along.
Hinton was Kamal...
that explains his so-called retirement.
he was in prison.
spending his time improving the technique for eliminating a person's htory.
well. Which means...
he was testing it on himself.
so, why...
let himself be caught on the trafficking charge?
and who...
killed him? That...
was clearly not part of the plan.
we were working under the assumption the eraser killed his client to cover his tracks.
what if it was the other way around?
the eraser was killed
terrorists?
we don't even know if they've arrived yet.
another client, then.
someone...
with a past they needed to forget.
and once the client's past had been erased, he kills Kamal.
to eliminate the only person who knows his true identity.
almost.
not a him, a her.
one of his girlfriends... Was actually a client.
cute.
she was erased, so we don't know anything about her.
wrong.
we do know how she kills.
where is Dr. Mallard?
with our forensic scientist.
I don't think he's ready to release the body, though.
he really gets into his work.
Yeah, he's turned himself inside out trying to unscramble the meaning behind this tattoo.
Dr. Mallard hates to leave anything unfinished.
Yeah.
me, too.
Dr. Hampton.
W-what are you doing?
I would never cut into your body without your permission, but I would appreciate the opportunity to...
perhaps level the scales.
of course.
you could have come into my lab flapping and quacking about miracles I failed to weave.
I assure you that's not in my character.
um...
shall we, uh, do this together?
I could only hope that this makes us even.
I might even owe you one...
...Doctor.
the girls have a theory.
the murder does not have anything to do.
it's one of the eraser's other clients.
so the killer could be anyone from anywhere?
we have been sifting through instances involving mercury.
did not find a similar murder, but...
idaho three years ago.
george Barney dies in his sleep.
ZIVA: Choked to death on his own vomit.
he's buried on his family farm.
ZIVA: Last month, the Barneys are digging a new well.
it turns out, the groundwater had been contaminated.
KRIEGER: EPA was called in, uh, traced the source of the contamination back to a leak in George Barney's casket.
mercury.
ZIVA: His young widow had been the high school science teacher.
she moved on after his untimely death.
local cops couldn't track her down.
she killed her husband.
KRIEGER: Here's a picture of the grieving wife.
look familiar?
do you need me to identify another photo?
recognize this person?
her hair matches one of the samples from Hinton's condo.
and the murder has her signature.
o'hara: All right, look. It was a tragedy when my husband died.
the entire town thought so.
doesn't sound like you shared their sentiments.
they didn't know what he was like when he was drunk, which was all the time.
so when the opportunity presented itself to start a new life, you took it.
wouldn't you?
how did Marvin Hinton know you were on the run?
he knew everything about me in one look, everything that matters.
he knew how I'd gotten my new name.
he said he'd been contacted the same way.
so you went home with him?
that he was toying with you?
cause he was the only one who knew about your past.
right?
I didn't kill him.
I suppose it wouldn't be any fun if she just admitted it.
Yes, sir.
FORNELL: Delivery boy still here?
waiting in the conference room.
make sure he gets home.
nice work today.
GIBBS: She killed once for a new life.
why not twice?
did us a favor-- Kamal is dead.
it doesn't seem to bother his international clients.
the terrorist training camp?
marine task force just went in.
And?
one terrorist killed.
they found an American passport on his body.
it went through squeaky clean.
Kamal had completed the job.
what about the rest of the cell?
too late. Already gone.
they're on their way here.
and the only man who knows who they are is past telling us.
that's not certain, Tony.
our dead man may have one thing left to say.
we cracked it, Gibbs; me and Ducky
we solved the puzzle.
we were just looking at it wrong.
Yeah, it was Jordon, uh... Dr. Hampton who had the idea of excising the section of inked flesh.
that is so gross.
but what we found is so cool.
the blotchy, thick, blue jailhouse dye that's just a camouflage.
Yes, the real clue is underneath, hidden like a painted-over Monet canvas.
all I had to do was eliminate the blue to clarify it.
this... is the original tattoo.
it's beautiful, with deeper needling.
professional work.
it's a masterpiece; it's a Blaine Parker.
he's something of a legend, Boston artist.
a man like Hinton trying to shed his past...
so I talked to Parker's assistant, and she was able to determine the exact dates when Hinton got the original tattoo.
over a period of several days,
Interpol's timeline, puts Kamal in London ten years ago.
Hinton's not Kamal.
delivery boy lied to us.
he did more than that; he set us up.
he wanted us to believe it was Hinton.
you think the kid's Kamal?
he would have had to start when he was eight years old.
not if he's the new Dread Pirate Roberts.
I love The Princess Bride.
no one would ever surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.
uh, the Dread Pirate Roberts picks a successor, then trains him, starts calling him Roberts and then settles into a cushy retirement.
it's the name "Kamal" that sells the business.
you can let me off up here.
sorry for the inconvenience.
just a case of mistaken identity.
good luck on your term paper.
Thanks.
GIBBS: Ziva, where are you?
dropping off Graves, Gibbs.
don't!
can we hug now?
FORNELL: From your closet.
GIBBS: Special delivery.
how'd you find Kamal?
you don't find Kamal.
Kamal finds you.
he tempt you with the money
or just the chance to become somebody else?
Kamal could tell you needed him.
he needed me.
he can't even work his own computer.
man's a dinosaur.
he knows how to read people.
FORNELL: Cover his tracks.
but you don't have the discipline.
Hinton figured you out.
he would've led the FBI right to you.
FORNELL: So you killed him before he got the chance.
made us think he was Kamal.
then you framed another client for his murder.
shannon O'Hara, aka Karen Barney.
you knew how she'd killed in the past.
she was your first client.
good for you.
you've got the whole story.
the worst mistake you made...
you tried to shoot our agents.
Hey, let me hang that up for you, Tobias.
sit down!
what do you want? The rest of your client list.
tell us where to find the real Kamal!
now!
I was at an embassy party once
gated, razor wire, surveillance system, the whole deal
and this guy just walks in the front door, wearing T-shirt that says "Liquor Store.
holds up a brown paper bag, and he goes, "Did anybody order, um, a bottle of vodk
hmm, the places you can access when you look the part.
Tony: This thing starts kind of slow.
I'm sure it gets better.
the picture's up, boss.
Tony: An NCIS production.
brought to you by Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
starring, as usual, the FBI, and the elusive Kamal Konkani.
GIBBS: Freeze it.
Tony: Hmm. The Dread Pirate Roberts,
did you get her number?
Tony: Who, Courtney? No.
I did.
she wants to learn how to fight.
Yes. Go away.
somebody being dumped?
Oh...
how do you tell someone you no longer want to see them?
easy.
listen, dirt bag, this is Ziva's husband.
I have your phone number now. I can find your address.
if you ever try to contact her again,
I will reach down your throat, grab your intestines, rip them out and drive over your head!
lose this number or lose your life.
you're welcome.
that was my aunt Nettie from Tel Aviv.
she was trying to stop seeing her 86-year-old Mahjong partner.
why didn't you stop me?
too stunned.
where do I send flowers?
if you ever communicate with her again, I will kill you.
McGee: Is it always this bright in here?
wait a second. I recognize that look.
you had sex, and I'm guessing it was with a girl.
no. No, it wasn't a girl?
no, it's none of your business.
if the probie was probing last night, I demand details.
actually it was this morning.
and it wasn't sex, it was coffee.
and it was good.
the coffee or the sex?
it wasn't sex. I met a nice girl, and we're hitting it off, that's all.
Where'd you meet?
moved into my building a few days ago right across the hall.
proximity, that's convenient.
very, hmm?
Wow. McGee is getting some.
get it out of your head, DiNozzo.
and gear up, we got a dead one.
you know, repeated head trauma causes brain damage?
explains a lot.
is this side of my head bigger?
Yes, but so is the other side.
Tony: Bonnie and Clyde.
ZIVA: Who and what?
it's a movie.
1967, Warren Beatty.
it's a classic tale of crime and punishment.
focus on this crime scene, DiNozzo.
nine millimeter cartridges.
it's not a robbery.
cash box is still under the seat.
credit cards are here, too.
rear Admiral Kenneth Kirkland.
worked at the Pentagon.
the driver's name...
Gesundheit.
address is listed as DC.
tire tracks.
single alignment, looks like a motorcycle.
top choice of assassins who often dump their weapons.
look, Ziva.
DUCKY: Well, this was no traffic accident.
no kidding.
little doubt they were killed here.
cause of death: multiple gunshots.
any one of which could have been fatal.
time?
that's not gonna be a problem.
onboard digital surveillance camera, probably time-stamped.
let's see it, DiNozzo.
what? There a problem?
well, I...
um, McGee has the cable... McGee.
normally I have the cable, but McGee has the other bag.
recorded straight onto a flash drive, probably on a 15 minute loop.
let's see the last recorded images here.
at 9: 23, first shot was fired.
cab crashed seven seconds later.
ZIVA: A turkey shoot.
Tony: Fish in a barrel.
DiNozzo, find out where the admiral was coming from, headed to, who knew about it...
and if any of those files are missing.
all right, I'll take care...
that lipstick on your collar, McGee?
well...
good for you, Tim.
good for you.
just don't ever get married.
Hello?
uh, I didn't order a sofa.
Yeah, that's my credit card number.
rear Admiral Kirkland's credited with several innovative efficiency programs at the Pentagon.
he was involved in developing the Ready-Rapid Deployment model for moving massive amounts of assets with minimum delays.
possible target for terrorists?
Admiral hasn't left dry land since '02.
not exactly a high-value al-Qaeda target.
any admiral is a high-value target.
taxi.
Kirkland was heading from his home to attend a budget meeting at the GAO.
no government car?
broke down on 14th Street.
his aide stayed with the car, Admiral called a cab.
why go through the park?
three car pile-up on Connecticut.
the cabdriver was probably trying to make up time.
sabotage?
ZIVA: No, we checked the Pentagon surveillance tapes.
nobody touched the car before it left to pick him up.
files? Staff checked his briefcase.
nothing was missing.
personal. No enemies, loving family, devoted wife.
no large insurance policies.
no motive.
every murder has a motive, McGee.
I thought you were quitting.
I did.
it's no caffeine.
no kick.
I can suck down, like, a half dozen of these babies, no ill effects.
Gibbs, I'm steel.
no, I am okay.
I'm better than okay.
way better. From the taxi.
bullets, the slug on the right is a nine millimeter, full metal jacket, high velocity;
you can see by its deformation that it went through metal, glass, the whole she-bang.
the other one?
also nine millimeter.
but just a standard hollow-point.
the striations on the rounds indicate that they were using silencers.
casings?
ejection port marks show that you're looking for a Glock or a Beretta.
you should really try this, Gibbs.
it'll change your life.
motorcycle?
the tread on the bike was only offered as an option on the Yamaha R-six series.
no hits on sales records yet, indicating that the bike may have been purchased overseas and then brought across the border.
all that, no caffeine.
crime scene?
I'm working on some fresh oil drops that were found near the tire tracks.
GIBBS: Cab took a detour.
must have followed them.
or they could've hacked into the taxi's onboard navigation system and were waiting. Ambush.
okay... can I just have one little teeny-tiny baby booster sip? Please?
no.
thank you, sir.- Welcome.
: McGee, garage. Now.
McGee: Boss, the navigation system was definitely hackable.
all they would've needed was the car's VIN number and the owner's address.
they could have requested a diagnostic test, then captured and cloned the signal.
who hacked it? -No way to tell.
the signal doesn't ghost, and there's no recording of GPS markers after the fact.
does anyone have any answers?
Ziva?- No.
Ziva doesn't have any answers, boss.
Yeah, Duck. I'm on my way up.
you look into the cab company.
Hey, uh, I can't really talk right now.
sure you can, probie.
you can talk right now. Go away, Tony.
put her on speaker, probie.
get out of here!
Probie...
look, there's something... Ah, look at him.
he's all grown up having his first fight.
now, where did you get my credit card number?
you opened my mail?
listen, I need to go, but we'll talk about this later, okay?
you, too.
: I'll see you later, Bumby.
well, we can't all be called "probie," can we?
what have you got, Duck?
bullet from the frontal lobe of your rear admiral.
Yeah, both bodies received multiple rounds from a variety of ranges and angles.
Indicating?
Yes, well, the first projectiles struck them after deflected off metal or glass.
and they were followed by two close contact wounds with stippling, indicating that they were shot execution style.
okay. That's it? - No, no, no, no.
come here. Take a look at this.
what am I looking at?
between the second bicuspid and second molar, lower left.
missing tooth?
freshly extracted.
and the lack of bleeding around the gum tissue indicates that it was postmortem.
there was no tooth in his throat or in his stomach, so he didn't swallow it.
and there was no tooth at the crime scene.
they pulled his tooth?
well, they could have used a pair of pliers.
it's a crude if effective means of extraction.
anything taken from our admiral?
no, no, no, no, but I found something really interesting on the driver's right hand.
what is that?
Abby ran the analysis. It's a fingerprint salve.
invisible until it's pressed on paper.
fingerprints and tooth pulp DNA.
two of the best ways to identify a body.
Yeah, your rear admiral wasn't the target, Jethro.
no.
dead driver's name was Atif Nukunda.
immigrated here seven years ago after his name was found on a death squad list.
a political refugee.
employment record show he worked two jobs
cab and pizza delivery driver, about 85 hours a week.
land of opportunity.
check his address.
metro Police have been there, done that. Vacant lot.
attacks on other cabdrivers in the past 60 days?
already working on it.
DiNozzo, check out the cab company.
go to, boss.
"go to." It's the new "on it" .
new catchphrase, just came up with it.
you like it? No.
cab company?
on it, boss.
go, too.
McGee, what do you got?
well, boss, the time-stamped footage of the killings enabled us to track all cell calls made from the park in the two minutes after the shooting.
ten calls in all.
one that stands out was a high-density bandwidth transmission, almost certainly a video file.
someone filmed the execution.
proof of death.
call was made from a pre-paid cell phone, then sent through a router in East Africa.
lost it there.
find it.
well, it went to a series of public pay phones, all of which were answered.
impossible to tell which line was actually the intended number.
whoever these guys are, boss, they're very good.
but so are we.
ZIVA: Nukunda is dead, Mr. Bayliss.
Oh, my God.
Really? Dead?
what happened?
have you not missed him?
no, he works the morning shift, so, uh, usually he's sleeping all day long.
where, in his cab?
in his apartment.
fake address.- Really?
wow, that is weird.
you know, I can't figure out if you're DeVito in Taxi or De Niro in Taxi Driver.
what?
you're acting.
I worked transit detail in Baltimore for two years.
come on.
okay, Nukunda was off book.
off book? - Off book.
means he worked for himself, not just the cab company.
it also means he required an illegal hack license.
cause there's a lot of places that cabdrivers won't go in the city, so we let the gypsies work those areas, service the public.
everybody wins.
the dead cabdriver was not a gypsy.
what?
no, "gypsy" means a cabdriver ?
it's also a great way to take advantage of immigrants who are desperate for work, isn't it?
dude, look, all I know is that the guy worked his ass off, okay?
he never invited me to his house, so I don't know where he lives.
I just can't help you out.
listen, dude, every dispatcher knows every driver and everything about them, so...
: ...I could have the Taxi Commission come down here and talk to you guys 'cause I know they'd like to meet each and every one of you and...
wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
look, okay, the Burundi drivers, they hang out at a little caf? on 18th Street, Northwest.
little tip: lime juice.
it cuts that just-barfed-on backseat smell, smelly guy.
how long have you been in this country?
Why?
well, you never heard of gypsy cabs?
you don't use contractions.
assimilate already.
what are contraptions?
: never mind.
there's definitely a photo missing.
any way to tell what was there?
would I have you down here to watch me fail?
silver bromide particles on any positive print leave minute traces on any surface when they're combined with compression and heat, like, say, a wallet being sat on for ten hours a day in a hot taxi.
Abby, your picture from the cadaver.
Oh, that's sad.
why would they take the family photo?
more proof they got the right guy.
any good news?
Yes, um, the oil, not from the taxi but from the motorcycle.
I was able to determine the exact viscosity and degradation, and I found microscopic metal shavings in it.
trace the bike?
well, not exactly.
well, actually, um, not at all, but if you find the motorcycle, then I can positively place it at the murder scene.
unless they change the oil.
unless they change the oil. Hmm.
this is a gift for you.
it's decaf.
I sleep at night.
I actually eat food.
it is so weird, you've got to try it.
don't let that hurt your feelings.
you speak Burundi?
the official language is Kirundi and French.
but these people speak English.
they just don't want to speak it with us.
federal agents.
looking for anybody who knows this man, his family, where he lives.
I take it this is the hack section
I'm just guessing
and your work visas are in order, 'cause I hate paperwork, so, uh...
how about a little help here?
may I see the photograph, please?
I know the man you're looking for, but his name is not Nukunda.
you must forgive them.
where they come from, agents of the government seldom bring good news.
well, we have questions.
even worse.
these are delicious.
then I won't tell you what they are made from.
Mr. Abaka, you say you're a professor?
at Waverly University.
I teach African Studies there.
how long have you been in this country?
seven years.
same as our dead cabdriver.
the same as many people in here.
it was a time of unrest
thousands of us came here looking for freedom and safety.
it is unfortunate that this man and his family only found death.
someone must know where his family is.
if they are in hiding, no.
what's his real name?
ABAKA: I don't know.
we keep secrets because secrets keep us alive.
we don't put people in jail for cooperating, but we do put them in jail for not cooperating.
Tony. I have been tortured in prison.
I am not afraid of your legal system.
how do you feel about deportation?
I will ask, but it is not in their culture to cooperate with the government.
they are too afraid.
he is lying about something.
he looked suspicious.
they all looked suspicious.
I'm surprised you could understand him, Ziva.
he spoke perfect English.
you are xenophobic.
I am not Xena-phobic-- it's one of my favorite shows.
leather skirts, lesbian sword fighting, female empowerment.
maybe I'm a little Ziva-phobic.
do you see what I see?
a crazy Israeli chick with impulse issues?
the reflection.
Oh. We could go ask him who he's calling.
or we can have McGee ask for us.
okay, triangulating all traffic from the towers closest to Caf?
but, narrowing it down to all outgoing calls at the time Abaka made his call.
less narration, McGee.
tracing.
look at that.
it's incredible.
probie's lips are still moving
he's like one of those Romanian orphans who can't stop rocking.
you are so prejudiced.
I am not.
I'm not.
by the way, that's a contraction-- "I'm" .
you should try it sometime.
got it.
ha! Beat my old record by two seconds.
uh...
cell number is listed to Delphin Abaka of Georgetown.
who'd he call?
the Wilmont Hotel, room 234.
currently occupied by a Sayda Zuri.
African.
accessing immigration files.
ZIVA: Probably Burundian.
cabdriver's wife maybe?
she came through customs two days ago from Burundi.
restricted travel visa.
picking her up, boss.
found her.
I have come to claim my husband's body.
his name is Thomas.
did he change it when he got here?
many times.
I don't know what he calls himself now, but he'll always be Thomas to me.
you said he came from Burundi seven years ago?
Yes.
but according to immigration records, this is the first time you have been here.
Why?
the situation in Burundi is very complicated, Miss.
I have not been free to come before now, but it seems I am too late.
I am sorry for your loss.
who told you to come to us?
a friend called me.
professor Abaka?
he has been helping me to try and find Thomas.
we are soul mates, Thomas and I.
have you met your soul mate, Miss?
you will know the minute you do.
ready.
no, this is not Thomas.
Yes, well, there's considerable swelling...
may I see his body?
thomas was tortured.
this man has no scars.
no.
this is not my husband.
you gotta be kidding me.
$15, 000?
something wrong, McGee?
computer glitch.
better?
much.
Where's Ziva?
right behind you.
there have been 11 attacks on cabdrivers in the past 60 days in the DC and Maryland area.
three of them are very interesting.
DiNozzo, put them up.
all three were shot with a nine-millimeter.
and all three autopsies showed a tooth missing.
enlarge the photos.
Ah.
Oh. Come on. Tell me you just didn't lose all that information.
I hit the space bar.
just push the buttons I tell you to push, monkey.
love is not treating you well, my friend.
Yeah, no kidding.
bring up our John Doe from the morgue.
anybody see what I see?
black males. All in their mid to late 40s. All local cabdrivers.
none of them work for the same company, though.
vitals.
similar age, similar height, similar weight...
they all have shaved heads and facial hair.
bad guys don't know exactly what their target looks like now.
they only have a general description.
seven years. Long time. People change.
would explain the teeth pulling and the videos.
DiNozzo. How many cabdrivers in DC fit this general description?
huh.
I'd say dozens.
thomas was a storekeeper.
he had no interest in politics.
but his words were so eloquent, so passionate, that his message spread from village to village.
he became a symbol of hope
extremists saw him as a threat.
privately, many in the government did not care if he died.
that was seven years ago.
what's changed?
there is a growing movement against the old ways.
some people are openly calling for him to return and lead the new people's party.
his enemies fear he will do exactly that.
I have been told they have sent people here to kill him.
came to warn him.
Yes.
how did your husband get here?
he was smuggled out of the country by your embassy in Burundi.
our government brought him here?
Yes.
you see, Thomas was pro-American.
that is why the extremists hate him.
why did you stay?
I could not leave my family, Miss.
my father was dying.
thomas felt that if he left, the extremists would no longer be threatened by him.
he was right.
they left me alone.
a year after he left,
I received this.
no postmark.
it was smuggled to me by the embassy.
he writes that he's working in Washington, driving a taxi.
that he misses me.
that he wants me to join him in America.
and then?
and then there was another civil war.
I never received another letter.
the embassy could no longer help me.
and now they have come for him.
I know men like these.
they will not stop until they are sure my husband is dead.
we need something from you.
anything.
the name of the embassy official who helped him get away.
are you aware that I no longer work for the State Department, Director?
Mr. Choyce, are you aware that the State Department and NCIS are part of the same government?
I doubt if there's anything I can do to help you.
you smuggled Thomas Zuri out of Burundi seven years ago.
you set him up in DC.
gave him a new identity.
don't know what you're talking about.
GIBBS: Talking about saving a life.
maybe several.
I wish I could help.
sit down.
you're not done yet.
you're a consultant now
what do you think would happen to your value in the private sector if I were to call ZNN, and tell them you refused to help us solve a murder of a United States Naval Officer?
an Admiral.
off the record.
Zuri walked away.
happens all the time.
once we get a political asset into the country, we hold onto them in case we need them in the future.
Zuri was very helpful.
but often the assets don't like the restrictions, so they leave the program.
we have no control over that.
Zuri left.
that was five years ago.
how do we find him?
anything I tell you is a violation of the agreement we had with him.
I am sure he'll understand.
I don't know where he is.
last known address.
look, he changed his address often.
all I can give you is where I know he lived five years ago.
do you understand?
stop laughing. It's not funny.
what's not funny, McGee?
uh, nothing. Personal...
well, don't tell me about it.
I want you to visit the State Department's strategic analysis unit.
visit?
I'm going to need clearance.
visit. Visit.
visit, visit, that kind of visit.
okay.
uh, what exactly am I looking for?
uh, oil in Burundi.
don't think there's oil in Burundi.
well, yeah, that's why I want you to look.
Ah, and run this.
last know address for Thomas Zuri.
okay, multitasking, boss.
Tony: Take my money, take my money.
take my money. Give me my candy.
you cannot buck the system, Tony.
trade bucks with me?
if you stop forcing things, they will come to you.
thank you, Obi-Wan.
why don't you like immigrants?
What?!
my great-grandparents came through Ellis Island, not the first-class lounge at El Al.
I came here in the jump seat of a C1-30 with turbulence.
whatever.
my point is, you're here on a weekend fun pass.
I'm the immigrant.
my family came here with nothing.
just loads of charm, talent and great looks.
my great-grandfather drove a truck for two dollars a day.
took him 20 years to start his own transportation company.
and now their great-grandson, he's an NCIS agent.
so don't tell me about the immigrant experience.
until you are one.
any of that true?
parts.
is this stuck to my teeth?
nothing sticks to you.
do you ever think about soul mates?
they were on Decca, right, big hit, mid-'70s?
sort of a disco thing?
sing a few bar, I'll get it.
you'll never get it.
: boss.
I did that thing you told me to do.
you don't have to whisper, McGee.
I don't care who hears.
do you want me to tell you how...
Nope.
cause I can give you the short...
forget I asked.
classified satellite recon photos of a petroleum exploration firm linked to China, doing drilling in the Dajee region of Burundi.
they find anything?
considering the money they're poured into the region, I'd say yes.
oil.
and guess who still has top-level clearance in the State Department?
he's still working for them.
not as an employee, but as a consultant.
plausible deniability.
you run that address Choyce gave us?
Yeah, construction site. New condos.
original building was demolished two years ago.
guess Zuri moved on, found a new place to live.
four drivers, four different cab companies.
McGee: Nothing in common?
all attacked at different times of the day.
time of death of the first driver?
2: 30 in the morning.
McGee: Which was 90 minutes after he clocked out.
second driver?
9: 45 in the evening.
two hours after he logged off.
none of them were officially working when they were attacked.
boss, in two of the attacks, the cabs had passengers.
in each case, including the admiral's, the passengers called for a cab.
meaning, they didn't just hail it on the street.
meaning someone had to have dispatched it.
even if they was off the records.
meaning Bayliss, the cab company dispatcher.
McGee: He was working when every attack happened.
probably used a bypass to channel the calls.
Bayliss did not report to work today.
address.
Yeah, got it.
warrant!
clear.
clear
Ziva, pick it.
no problem.
fives and tens. Curb cash.
what's curb cash?
fares.
small denominations.
street money. Kickbacks.
lollipop for Mc Loverboy.
those real?
no.
fakes. But they're really good fakes.
guy's a regular cab coyote.
is that like a wolf in sheep's clothing?
coyote is a person who exploits people
Tony: As opposed to outsourcing,
Whoa!
that's Bayliss.
attic space.
he must have been hiding.
been shot.
still warm, boss.
boss, MPD shut down a 12-block perimeter around Bayliss's apartment. Nothing.
got a BOLO out on the Yamaha.
traffic cams?
McGee: Lost the bike after three blocks. He took side streets.
how did they know about Bayliss?
GIBBS: McGee, Choyce's bank records and personnel file from State.
and find out who the hell Choyce called after he left here.
boss.
bring him in.
get Sayda.
yes?
no, I don't want to give you her name.
I just want to cancel my credit cards.
60... Well, why would you send the IRS after me?
I haven't done anything.
yeah?
did you know that it's 365 steps from my lab to your desk?
trying to get my blood pumping.
what's wrong with you?
nothing.
okay, this is the new, caffeine-free, non-jittery Abby.
still waters. Deep.
you're hiding something, and I seek it.
speak.
I've been seeing this girl.
Oh. That's nice.
no, actually, it's not nice.
she, uh, stole my mail, and took out $65, 000 in pre-approved credit cards in my name.
Wow. You have really good credit.
FICA score's 750.
well, was.
so, this is, like, the best worst love story ever?
Abby, what do I do?
it's like I'm nuts for this girl, you know, and she's just...
...nuts.
she stole your heart, she stole your money.
arrest her.
that's the thing.
that's what she wants.
she admitted everything to me.
that is a check for $65, 000.
Yeah, her father's Earnest Leonard.
he's worth billions.
she does this for fun.
she's been arrested twice.
she steals people's money, she buys things.
the crazy ones are the best.
see, the weird thing is...
I kind of dig it, you know?
okay, love is never having to read her Miranda rights.
but she's going to do this to somebody else.
throw her psycho ass in the brig.
I love you, McGee.
that should be enough.
shall we try this again?
has something changed?
Oh, you might say that.
recognize these?
my banking details.
this is outrageous. How did you get these?
warrant, and this is what we found.
two deposits.
one for $100, 000.
the second for $150, 000. From a bank in Burundi.
now, we're still following the paper trail, but I think we all know where it's going to take us, don't we, Mr. Choyce?
to Burundi political extremists.
with well-oiled pockets.
you sold them information about Zuri.
I want a deal before I say anything else.
SHEPARD: First the truth. Then a deal.
look, I didn't sell them anything useful.
it was information from years ago.
old addresses and phone numbers, that's all.
he was paranoid!
he moved six times in the first year!
there's no way they could find him!
was one of these old phone numbers used by a taxi dispatcher named Bayliss?
Zuri only drove cabs for a couple of months years ago.
then he quit.
wrong. He went gypsy, off the books.
you gave them Bayliss's name.
Bayliss is dead.
got to believe he told them where to find Zuri.
Oh, my God.
how did you communicate with them?
they contacted me.
by phone?
pre-paid cell. They called me.
Non-traceable.
I tried.
name.
tie him to Burundi terrorism.
send him to Gitmo.
no lawyer, no phone.
good luck with that deal.
Delphin Abaka.
McGee: No luck, boss. Abaka's off the grid.
he's a damn teacher at a university, McGee.
McGee: Also served in the Burundi army 20 years ago and hasn't been teaching since last semester.
I guess when he realized we were involved, he tried to use Sayda to find out what we knew.
we probably know less than he does.
the DMV needs a thumbprint to get a driver's license.
means Zuri's in the system.
if we can match his prints to DMV records, we can get his current alias and an address.
Tony: That's a nice try, probie.
if Zuri's still out there, he's got his fake hack license with him.
I'm sorry, boss. I already looked.
I think I know where we can get a fingerprint.
Sayda's locket.
scanning.
okay.
let's see what we got.
it's a partial right thumb.
degraded by age, but I have enough whirls and deltas to get eight points.
how long is this going to take, madam?
you know what? It's hard to tell.
tell, Abby.
somebody needs to switch to decaf.
could be seconds, could be hours if he used his other thumb for his driver's license.
okay, he's not in the DC system, or Virginia or Maryland.
do you want me to run all 50 states? - Yes.
wow, it's getting really late.
not that I'm tired or anything from a lack of caffeine, mind you, 'cause I'm not. At all. Really.
my meter is running full blast, Gibbs.
relax, Abs.
I think you just solved the case.
I did?
meters.
a form of measurement used extensively in Europe.
taxi meters, DiNozzo.
Bayliss keep meter records for gypsy drivers?
Yeah, sure. Without records, he wouldn't be able to keep track of kickbacks.
Bayliss's laptop.
every driver who hasn't reported to work for the past 72 hours.
I'm only interested in meters that are not running.
I don't follow.
but I'm willing to give it a try.
Tony: I get it.
Zuri heard about other cabdrivers being attacked.
he knows they're after him.
so he would have stopped driving after the first attack.
put it up.
McGee: Dumping all females, non-African-Americans, everyone over 50 and under 30.
match the rest against our victims' stats.
five left, boss.
that is Thomas.
that is my husband. Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
give me the address, McGee.
I want to come with you.
I want to see him.
please.- No.
please.
yamaha's on the side. Engine's still hot.
McGee, you're out front.
DiNozzo, you're with us.
man: I will not have a... to ruin my country
it's time for you to die.
if you're going to do this, do it, but do not harm my wife.
shut up, shopkeeper. Be still.
be still, or she will end up dead like you.
if you think I would let you return to my country, you are wrong, very wrong.
NCIS! Drop your weapons!
you.
hello again, Professor Abaka.
thomas Zuri? - Yes.
you're a hard man to find.
well, perhaps... not hard enough.
my wife...
he is okay.
Oh, thank you.
seven years is a long time.
I've missed you so much.
you have been in my heart every moment.
I-I wrote to you.
so many letters. Hundreds.
but I just received one letter, Thomas.
and then I heard that the army had killed everyone in our village.
I survived.
we both survived.
I thought I would never see you again.
I'm so sorry, Sayda.
I am so very sorry.
it's okay, Thomas.
I understand.
I am just glad you are safe.
let's go in.
Hi, gorgeous. Hi.
Elvis has left the building.
Yeah, we got it.
get in there, DiNozz
on my way, boss.
so where are we going on this... mystery date?
well, it wouldn't be a mystery if I told you, Gina.
should I have brought my toothbrush?
going right on Connecticut.
you left the bar early last night. Yes.
my husband was calling from Fallujah.
what did you do when I left? Nothing.
went home, went to bed.
should I get on the expressway?
Nope. Mm...
I like a man who keeps secrets.
what's the gap?
almost two blocks.
boss... You done?
don't need the bugs, boss, got Hoffman's latest victim.
number five.
female Caucasian, mid to late twenties.
dead on the living roofloor.
what about the finger?
Yep, missing a finger.
call Ziva-- give her thedistress code.
tell her we're taking Hoffman down now.
hello.
uh, no, you've got the wrong number.
if yo're not going to tell me where we are going,
I'm gonna need a ladies' room.
what are you doing?
who's Gibbs?
wrong number.
his name's number two on your speed dial.
he was an ex-boyfriend, okay?
can I have my phone back, plea?
drive.
they just turned west.
all right, he car is stopped two blocks ahead.
you're a cop, aren't you?
why did you kill those women, Andy?
for their husbands.
save them the humiliation of finding out that their wives were screwing around on them while they were serving their country.
is that what happened to you?
you don't need to know what happened to me.
walk.
get in there.
come on.
you all right?
sorry.
she should go for X-ray.
I am fine.
you don't look fine.
well, don't stand there,
Mr. Palmer, get the gurney. Yes, doctor.
he did not hurt me.
need your clothes.
get changed, get an X-ray, go home.
I do not need to see you again day.
where the hell are you, McTardy?
I'm still here alone with the dead body.
we're still processing our own, Tony.
we'll be there soon as we can.
how's Ziva?
pretty shaken up.
keep me updated. I will.
finally got the dirtbag.
his name's Andrew Hoffman.
you heard of him? No.
but I hear you've got another body.
victim number five.
military wife? Don't know yet.
how'd you get on to Homan?
officer David was working undercover in the bar where two of the victims were last seen.
planning to do the same thing ourselves ifou guys hadn't taken over the case.
you know, Rosetti, I don't think Hoffman is yr type.
nice work, David.
I'll get someone to take you to the hospital.
I can give you a lift.
no, I'm fine, Detective.
I'm fine, really, thank you.
I told you to go home.
my statement is on your desk.
have you identified the last victim?
no.
I thought I would go back to the bar where I met Hoffman, show the victim's photo.
do you have a face shot?
Yeah, I'll print one.
you stay with her, DiNozzo.
okay.
what?
you don't look so bad.
McGee said you were a wreck.
I was just gonna tussle your hair.
sometimes it makes you smile.
sorry.
a fifth, still unidentified victim was found is afternoon inside Hoffman's home.
his shooting death by an undercover NCIS agent ends the series of brutal murders of military wives found in war memorials around DC.
the murders have been taking place over the last two months...
Wow.
I'll take the bartender.
her name is Heidi.
Gina, you hear about Andy Hoffman, guy that sits at the end of the bar? Yes.
you were just talking to him the other night.
can you believe he would... Michael.
my name is, uh, not Gina.
my name is Ziva.
you're an undercover cop?
that... that was you?
I'm a deral agent, actually.
holy crap... You never...
Ah, so when you were chatting me up, you were... mean, you thoughI might be...
Michael, I was doing my job.
sure, just doing your job.
have you ever seen this woman before?
she's dead?
she s never in here on my shift.
she the one they found at Hoffman's house?
Yes, she is.
do you ever talk to him?
all the time.
actually gives me the creeps thinking about it.
there's a couple of guys in here
I would've suspected before him.
he er mention his ex-wife?
I didn't know he was married.
interesting...
you know who that guy is over there in the corner?
with Gina?
his name is Michael.
what's his story?
michael used to come in here all the time with his girlfriend.
she walked out on him a few weeks ago, and he hasn't been able to find her.
this girl's name is Julie.
I don't know her surme.
I talked to her once or twice.
I thought maybe she knew Devon, my girlfriend... ex.
I still haven't found her-- it's been three weeks.
you don't think Hoffman, uh...
I mean, you think they're gonna find more bodies?
I hope not.
well, I'm worried.
she used to be married to a Navy SEAL-- it fits the profile.
did he do that?
name's Julie Ann Smight.
employer filed a missing persons with the Chevy Chase PD this morning.
she married? Yeah, to, uh...
petty Officer First Class Donald Smight.
he's aboard the USS Eisenhower.
she was last seen two nights ago, leaving a lounge on U Street... alone.
petty Officer Massey's here to pick up his wife's personal belongings.
how you holding up?
I'm all right, I guess.
hope you don't mind, ma'am, but I asked Special Agent DiNozzo to bring me up here.
I wanted to thank you personally for killing that bastard.
I hope you made him suffer for what he did.
take Petty Officer Massey down to the evidence locker.
will do. This way.
Hey.
what do you want, Duck?
I've reviewed the autopsies of the first four victims, and I'm currently examining the fifth.
all four were stabbed in the same manner with the same knife.
in all five, tox screens show large amounts of Rohypnol and alcohol.
but in regard to the fingers...
Oh.
...I found a curious inconsistenc
four of the five were severed postmortem.
based on lividity and blood flow,
I'd estimate several hours after death.
but the finger of fourth victim...was cut off almost immediately.
maybe someone interrupted him so he had to rush to finish it.
Abby, what're you doing?
efficiency, Gibbs.
took off 14 and a half seconds from what it usually takes me to get here.
so, I estimate that I could gain 17 minutes a day.
that would be 85 minutes in a week.
2 minutes in a month.
so, in a year... Abs.
Yes, Gibbs?
is that knife gonna tell me something?
Oh, um...
yes and no.
I mean, it definitely is the serrated knife that severed the victims' fingers.
But? But, um, I found a partial print in blood on the handle.
it doesn't match Hoffman or the oer victims.
I don't think Hoffman was working alone.
die, you stupid mache!
she seems unfazed.
those are standard Mossad style copy machine assault tactics, McGee.
she's fine.
Hey, McGee thinks you're raging against the machine 'cause you had to take down your serial killer boyfriend.
thanks for that.
I was just concerned...
I am fine. See?
she's a steely-eyed killer.
I don't know him. Borscht-belt comedian?
it is Hebrew. For shut up.
really did affect you, huh?
have you had your mandatory session with the shrink?
Yes.
still crazy, then?
getting off your case.
well, you can stay on this one.
Abby found a partial print on the murder weapon that does not match our killer.
had an accomplice?
that's one explanation.
could be a copycat killer.
copycats copy.
they don't use the same weapon.
re-examine the crime scene, canvass Hoffman's neighborhood, take another look at the surveilnce video.
tomorrow.
go home.
been a long day.
get some rest.
you.
I do not need to see you here tomorrow.
anyone want to, uh, get a drink?
drink?
not tonight, Tony.
listen
I wasn't trying to make light of what you went through.
just trying to snap you out of your head space, you know?
I have perfectly good space in my head.
great.
then let's get a drink.
you talk, I'll listen.
I don't want a drink.
okay.
one drink.
I'll talk, you listen.
no.
let me buy you the next one.
you working?
no.
no, really.
I'm not working.
Just...drinking.
uno mas, s'il vous plait.
ming up! You're mixing your languages.
and my liquors.
not exactly the place to come if you're not other case.
there's a thsand bars in this town.
I like the atmosphere.
and Heidi... makes onkiller mojito.
I thought maybe you took a shine to one of the patrons.
and you?
you are here, no doubt, in search of Debbie?
potato, potato.
Yeah, well, not searching.
just drinking.
so, tell me about Debbie.
just kidding.
very pretty.
and smart.
funny.
Teible sense of direction.
drive you insane with her incessant movie references.
worries about others more than herself.
generous to a fault.
no wonder you're looking for her.
she sounds amazing.
other than the fact that we were totally incompatible,
Devon was perfect for me.
you miss her?
I'm not looking to get back together with her.
I just want to know she's okay.
I'm going to help you.
you already have.
how so? By killing Hoffman.
one less nightmare.
you okay?
never better.
thought you were taking the day.
Gibbs' idea. Not mine.
that Hoffman?
Yeah, I'm reviewing the tapes.
victim number three?
Monica Bishop, judging by the dress.
look at this guy here.
he's watching 'em.
if Hoffman had an accomplice, he could very ll be him.
or he could just be a passerby.
there he goes.
look, he's heading in the same direction Hoffman took the girl.
or he could be going to a bar.
or he was checking to ma sure no one was following them, before joining Hoffman and killing the woman.
that's got to be Hoffman's accomplice.
man without a face.
spoke to the neighbors.
they barely knew Hoffman.
guy was an enigma.
well, he still is.
found a stack of photos, too.
not a woman in any of them.
just Hoffman and his Marine buddies.
any one of 'em a potential accomplice.
good a place to start as any.
Gibbs, I thought we closed the case on this one.
Yeah, well, found a partial print on Hoffman's knife that doesn't belong to him.
most seriakillers work alone.
Yeah. Most.
couldn't be the first time a killer worked with a partner.
you got the Cook brothers,
Eric and Lyle Menendez...
I wouldn't get too excited about a partial print on a knife-- it could be anything.
I need to review all the evidence you have.
I've already given you everything that I think is relevant.
well, then give me everything you think isn't.
Gibbs, you've got your killer, you've got all your bodies...
most of the bodies-- we're still missing five of the fingers that he cut off the victims.
doesn't mean that there's a second killer.
well, maybe Hoffman kept the bodies as a prize, and his accomplice got to keep the fingers.
you were a cop.
tell your boss what it's like to have 20 open case files on your desk.
you know what, Rosetti? I don't care if you've got a hundred.
there could still be a killer out there.
well, I hope you weren't looking for me.
is that really what you are hoping?
not even close.
you know, I could, uh, I could buy you a drink, or... Or what?
you could come home with me.
why would I do that?
because you feel guilty about lying to me.
or because you just killed somebody and...
need someone to hug.
why do I have the feeling that you are angling for more than just a hug?
Angling? No.
hoping?
have you been telling me the truth about your girlfriend?
or are you just taking advantage of my raw emotional state?
Yes.
and... yes.
easy, You should not do that to me.
look...I don't usually do this kind of thing.
neither do I.
is that the gun you shot Hoffman with?
no.
we struggled and then I
no, it's not the gun.
so, uh what's it like to shoot someone?
it is what it is.
it is what you have to do.
these are not things I dwell upon.
were you scared?
no.
sorry. That's a... That's a dumb question.
I guess you wouldn't be an NCIS agent if you had a problem with it.
I'm not an NCIS agent.
I am Israeli Mossad.
Wow.
Guessingoffman's not the first guy you've, uh...
why does everyone think all Mossad agents are assassins?
are you?
you know, I've never handled a gun before.
well, you're not going to handle one now.
well, I guess I'll just have to handle something else.
I've re-sampled the image as many times as I can, McGee.
try removing compression artifacts.
it's too pixelated.
did you try detecting edges?
I am detecting an edge.
I'm good, McGee, but I can't work miracles.
this is impossible.I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...
there is no substitute for quality source imagery. I know
where are u going?
I am going back to work.
well, you think I'm going to give up that easily?
you think I'm a quitter?
you, of all people should know that I thrive in the face of adversity.
you're making the face of adversity.
I found each of the victim's blood on the murder weapon.
Hoffman didn't clean the knife after each murder?
Oh, no, he did meticulously.
but I-I found trace evidence where the blade goes into the handle.
okay, look, four of the victims have blood type O-positive.
the fifth victim has blood type A-positive.
well, that's not that strange.
most killers don't chose their victims by blood type.
no, no, that's not what's strange.
I also found traces of B-posite.
than it must be Hoffman's blood.
no.
he's O-gative.
not a match.
there's a sixth victim, McGee.
whose body hasn't been found yet.
did she leave any forwarding number or address?
I'm afraid she didn't.
okay. Well, if she makes contact, will you please notify me?
thank you.
you're welcome.
what are you doing?
checking in Locke's missing girlfriend.
you? Same.
what? Why?
Yeah, not like the musical.
starts with a K, ends with a Z.
Thanks. All right.
checking her medical records.
what, you think she's been lying in some hospital unable to communicate?
no. I think she's been lying in a shallow grave, unable to communicate.
medical records are privileged information.
you need a subpoena.
not if you have an I. O.U. from a county clerk with a very expressive poker face. Hey.
there it is.
Thanks, Laramie. I owe you.
well, not as much as you owe me, of course.
right.
guess what Locke's girlfriend's ood type is?
the same blood type Abby found on the knife-- B-positive.
although it's hard to be positive when the news is so negative.
millions have at blood type.
only ten percent of Americans have that blood type
so you have narrowed it down to what, millions?
narrows it down a lot further when you consider that she was a regular at the bar frequented by two other victims.
she could easily be victim number six.
and your pal Locke could be her killer.
he is not a killer.
okay.
Co-killer, assistant killer, killer's apprentice.
michael was not involved in the murders.
that is his name.
that is his first name.
you didn't.
no, don't tell me.
okay, tell me. What I did or did not do is none of your business.
detective Rosetti, morning.
here are the case files your boss wanted.
sorry.
Hoffman's car. -Yep.
all 786 square feet of dustable surface.
you find anything?
$3. 50 in change.
an impressive gum wrapper collection.
all right.
thanks for the files, Detective.
you want the rest?
you guys wanted everything.
here's everything.
you didn't happen to make a digital catalogue of all the evidence, did you?
Digitacatalogue, huh?
that'a good one. Okay.
four boxes, four bags of evidence, four bags of personaeffects.
I am going to be here forever.
this one has your name written all over it.
thank you.
got address book.
that's great.
far, all of the prints from the car-- they match Hoffman.
there's justo sign of an accomplice.
what about the video still?
I have tried everything.
I just... I can't get an ID.
you're admitting defeat?
no.
I have a new tactical plan.
by triangulating the heights of the landmarks
like the street lights and cars and stuff
I think I can figure out an approximate height and weight of Hoffman's alleged accomplice.
that's great.
there's a page missing.
torn out.
that's why the pages fall.
someone tore out the binding.
why would someone tear out a page?
how tall is your buddy Locke?
about six-one, six-two.
how much do you think he weighs?
why do you ask?
why don't you answer?
170, 1.
Abby calculated the height and the weight of the mystery man on the surveillance video.
six-one, 180, just like Locke.
well, the only thing that proves is that you are jealous.
I'm concerned.
slim build, just like Locke.
of course, with your hands-on experience last night, maybe you could elaborate.
saw you two leaving the bar together.
you followed me?
don't flatter yourself.
you do look good on the sveillance video, though.
add about ten pounds.
address book belonged to Monica Bishop, victim number three.
missing page is from the Rs.
pull up her phone records.
sea of Love, boss.
remember that movie?
al Pacino plays a cop, sleeps with a serial killer played by Ellen Barkin?
but the zany twist here is,
Ziva's Pacino, and Locke is Barkin.
might even be biting. Shut your trap, DiNozzo!
am I missing something here?
boss, I got it.
matching calls Bishop sent or received over the past year against the letter R.
a two-week period last year,
Rosetti call Bishop five times.
Rosetti never said boo about knowing the third victim.
he's covering for something.
bring him in.
you know the ramifications tampering with evidence?
what are you talking about?
belonged to Monica Bishop.
victim number three.
you forget?
nobody knows this case better than me, Gibbs.
well, I'm guessing you knew Monica more than a little bit.
that why you tore the page out of this with your name and address on it?
how did it go down, Chris?
did you meet Hoffman in the same bar where you met Monica Bishop?
what was your beef?
rejection?
jealousy?
Impotency?
I had an affair with Monica Bishop.
end of story.
feels more like the middle, actually.
do you help Hoffman, or you just watch?
go to hell, Gibbs.
you got the wrong story.
put me straight.
I met her at that bar six months ago.
she was a fixture there.
you could drag a dozen guys in here who slept with her.
she had it coming?
it was just an affai
no big deal.
yeah? Then why'd you hide it?
she was married, I was married.
you don't tamper with evidence because your afraid your wife's gonna see it.
if my captain found out I slept with her, he would have taken me off the case.
well, he should have.
I wanted to catch this guy.
you were getting laid.
you wanted to protect your ass.
no.
I wanted the scumbag dead!
I was investigating the first two murders before she turned up as the third victim.
if you guys hadn't taken over this case,
I would have caught Hoffman, and I would have popped him.
gladly.
Gibbs doesn't think Rosetti's the killer.
neither do I.
guess that just leaves your boyfriend.
you got to stop staring at this one, Ziva.
put it behind you.
you seeing Ocke?
you have a problem with that?
I if he's a suspect. Is he?
you tell me.
look, if you're going to give me a lecture on my bad judgment,
I don't need to hear it.
is that what this is about?
you doubting your judgment? I should've moved earlier.
you would've if you could've.
I left it too late.
you still took him out.
I almost died.
but you didn't.
you've got to trust your judgment, Ziva.
moment you don't...it won't be "almost."
Devon, it's me.
did you tellichael about us yet?
cause if you meant what you said last night, it's over between you two.
you've got to tell him about us.
cause if you don't, I will.
who is he? Don't know yet.
it's a deleted message from Devon Katz's phone.
locke's missing girlfriend.
mystery voice was obviously begging her to dump Locke.
how did we get the recording?
Ah, tell him, McSneaky.
accessed the phone provider's mainframe.
what do we got on him? He's been hanging on at the bar where two of the victims were last see
we can tie him to Hoffman.
bartender says they were friendly.
locke reported Devon Katz missing two weeks ago.
covering his tracks.
no trace of her.
her blood type was B-positive.
same as the blood type Abby found on the knife. Victim six?
my guess is Locke found out she was bouncy-bouncy with some other guy and he killed her.
you're wrong.
you've got to look at this objectively, Ziva.
evidence says he's guilty.
all circumcised.
uh, circumstantial.
I think she knows what she's talking about.
his print is on the barrel.
what are you doing? Trusting my judgement.
come on, you big band of belted butyl.
Oh, good.
I could use some help here.
not tired of those things yet?
hold ts, carefully.
locke's fingerprint's on it.
roll aside.
man's work.
heavy.
Ooh...
thank you.
my...
what?
you brought me here for a reason.
I need some answers.
I thought you said you wanted to put this behind you.
how long is this gonna take?
just a few minutes.
you match the fingers to the victims yet?
I'm working on it, Gib.
did you call Ziva?
not answering, boss.
okay. So this one...
no-brainer, easy to match.
I've always really liked this color.
it's called Arctic Blue.
and the rest?
well, I'll give you a help, Abby.
it shouldn't take as long.
so what went wrong?
I waited too long.
I should have moved faster.
right about here...
there was nowhere left to go.
and we fell onto the floor.
we struggled, and then I pushed himff.
Jethro,based on blood type, skin tone, angle of cut, I am 95%
certain that these belong to victims one, two, three and five.
as you'll recall, victim number four's finger, unlike the others, was severed immediately after death.
copycat theory sounding pretty good, boss.
whoever killed number four knew to cut off the finger, but didn't know
Hoffman was keeping them as souvenirs.
or where he stashed them.
I crawled.
I grabbed the gun.
I rolled over...and there he was.
and you shot him.
I shot him.
I don't understand.
why didn't you shoot him earlier?
I was undercover.
I didn't have my gun.
just like now.
locke was all whorls.
bad guy, loops and arches.
locke is not the killer.
you owe Ziva an apology.
Yes, but we still have to account for victim number four's finger, cut off right after death.
Patricia Massey, military wife.
copycat hides her murder among Hoffman's victims.
husband?
always suspect the spouse.
speaking from personal experience, Jethro?
that's why I'm never getting married.
petty Officer Massey's build does match the guy following Hoffman on the surveillance video.
call her.
wheel!
ABS. Yes, Gibbs?
lose the wheels.
what do you want, Tony?
locke's print doesn't match the partial.
his print is not a match?
right.
well, next time we should both listen to my instcts.
Yeah.
was that about me?
w-was this about me, still a suspect?
I never believed it.
how'd you get my print?
you touched my gun.
so you took my fingerprintran it.
I didn't match up, and now you're telling me u never believed it was me?
look...
I tried to stop this, okay?
I'm sorry, Michael.
I wish I could believe you,
Ziva, Gina... whatever.
Hey, something wrong?
like to talk to you. Need to come with us.
Yeah, we're a man short today. Can it wait?
no.
what's the problem? Got some theories on your wife's murder.
Yeah, you got the guy; he's dead.
we don't think Andy Hoffman killed her.
sure you want to do this here, Massey?
I got nothing to hide.
Hoffman was killing women who were cheating on their husbands.
you saying my wife was cheating on me?
probably why you were drinking at your favorite bar.
same bar Hoffman frequented.
same bar where he picked up two of his victims.
you noticed him, heard about the killings in the news.
put two and two together. The night Hoffman picked up his third victim at the bar, you watched them leave.
not me.
you followed them back to Hoffman's house.
when he left and she didn't, you broke in.
it's pretty neat. Copycat killing using the same knife and M. O. as the original killer.
you guys got a wild imagination.
Yeah, well, the mistake you made, the thing you didn't know, is that Hoffman kept the fingers, except your wife's.
boy, that looks deep.
working on the engine.
no.
I think it's from cutting off your wife's finger.
we found a partial print and traces of blood on the murder weapon,
that don't match Hoffman or the victims.
DNA's going to narrow it down you.
Hi.
what do you want?
telephone number.
I found Devon.
I thought I owed you that much.
she wants to talk to you.
Thanks.
be right there.
Hi, gorgeous.
Yeah, we got it.
get in there, dinozz on my way, boss.
so where are we going on this... mystery date?
well, it wouldn't be a mystery if I told you, Gina.
should I have brought my toothbrush?
going right on connecticut.
you left the bar early last night. - Yes.
my husband was calling from Fallujah.
what did you do when I left? - Nothing.
went home, went to bed.
should I get on the expressway? - Nope.
I like a man who keeps secrets.
what's the gap? - Almost two blocks.
boss... - yodone?
don't need the bugs, boss, got Hoffman's latest victim.
number five. Female caucasian, mid to late twenties.
dead on the living roofloor.
what about the finger?
Yep, missing a finger.
call Ziva-- give her the distress code.
tell her we're taking Hoffman down now.
hello. - Bernard?
uh, no, you've got the wrong number.
if youre not going to tell me where we are going,
I'm gonna need a ladies' room.
what are you doing?
who's Gibbs? - Wrong number.
his name's number two on your speed dial.
he was an ex-boyfriend, okay?
can I have my phone back, plea?
drive.
they just turned west.
all right, he car is stopped two blocks ahead.
you're a cop, aren't you?
why did you kill those women, Andy?
for their husbands.
save them the humiliation of finding out that their wives were screwing around on them while they were serving their country.
is that what happened to you?
you don't need to know what happened to me.
walk.
get in there.
come on.
you all right?
sorry.
she should go for x-ray.
I am fine.
you don't look fine.
well, don't stand there, mr. Palmer, get the gurney.
Yes, doctor.
he did not hurt me.
need your clothes.
get changed, get an x-ray, go home.
I do not need to see you again day.
McGee.
where the hell are you, mctardy?
I'm still here alone with the dead body.
we're still processing our own, Tony.
we'll be there soon as we can.
how's Ziva?
pretty shaken up.
keep me updated. - I will.
finally got the dirtbag.
his name's Andrew Hoffman. You heard of him?
no. But I hear you've got another body.
victim number five.
military wife? - Don't know yet.
how'd you get on to Hoffman?
officer David was working undercover in the bar where two of the victims were last seen.
planning to do the same thing ourselves ifou guys hadn't taken over the case.
you know, rosetti, I don't think Hoffman is yr type.
nice work, David.
I'll get someone to take you to the hospital.
I can give you a lift.
no, I'm fine, detective.
I'm fine, really, thank you.
I told you to go home.
my statement is on your desk.
have you identified the last victim?
no.
I thought I would go back to the bar where I met Hoffman, show the victim's photo.
do you have a fa shot?
Yeah, I'll print one.
you stay with her, Dinozzo.
okay.
what?
you don't look so bad.
McGee said you were a wreck.
I was just gonna tussle your hair.
sometimes it makes you smile.
sorry.
a fifth, still unidentified victim was found is afternoon inside Hoffman's home.
his shooting death by an undercover ncis agent ends the series of brutal murders of military wives found in war memorials ound dc.
the murders have been taking place over the last two months...
I'll take the bartender. - Her name is Heidi.
Gina, you hear abouandy Hoffman, guy that sits at the end of the bar?
Yes.
you were just talking to him the other night. Can you believe he would...
Michael. My name is, uh, not Gina.
my name is Ziva.
you're an undercover cop? That... that was you?
I'm a deral agent, actually.
holy crap... you never...
Ah, so when you were chatting me up, you were... I mean, you thoughi might be...
Michael, I was doing my job.
sure, just doing your job.
have you ever seen this woman before?
she's dead?
she s never in here on my shift.
she the one they found at hoffman's house?
Yes, she is.
do you ever talk to him? - All the time.
actually gives me the creeps thinking about it.
there's a couple of guys in here I would've suspected before him.
he er mention his ex-wife?
I didn't know he was married. - Interesting...
you know who that guy is over there in the corner?
with Gina? His name is Michael.
what's his story?
michael used to come in here all the time with his girlfriend.
she walked out on him a few weeks ago, and he hasn't been able to find her.
this girl's name is Julie.
I don't know her surme. I talked to her once or twice.
I thought maybe she knew devon, my girlfriend... ex.
I still haven't found her-- it's been three weeks.
you don't think Hoffman, uh...
I mean, you think they're gonna find more bodies?
I hope not.
well, I'm worried.
she used to be married to a navy seal-- it fits the profile.
did he do that?
name's Julie Ann Smight.
employer filed a missing persons with the chevy chase pd this morning.
she married?
ye, to, uh... petty officer first class Donald Smight.
he's aboard the Uss Eisenhower.
she was last seen two nights ago, leaving a lounge on U street... alone.
petty officer massey's here to pick up his wifs personal belongings.
how you holding up? - I'm all right, I guess.
hope you don't mind, ma'am, but I asked special agent Dinozzo to bring me up here.
I wanted to thank you personally for killing that bastard.
I hopeou made him suffer for what he did.
DiNozzo, take petty officer massey down to the evidence locker.
will do. This way.
what do you want, Duck?
Ah, Jethro.
I've reviewed the autopsies of the first four victims, anI'm currently examining the fifth.
all four were stabbed in the same manner with the same knife.
in all five, tox screens show large amounts of rohypnol and alcohol.
but in regard to the fingers, or the lk thereof...
I found a curious inconsistenc four of the five were severed postmortem.
based on lividity and blood flow, I'd estimate several hours after death.
but the finger of fourth victim...
was cut off almost immediately.
maybe someone interrupted him so he had to rush to finish it.
Abby, what're you doing?
efficiency, Gibbs.
took off 14 and a half seconds from what it usually takes me to get here.
so, I estimate that I could gain 17 minutes a day.
that would be 85 minutes in a week.
2 minutes in a month. So, in a year...
Yes, Gibbs?
is that knife gonna tell me something?
yes and no.
I mean, it definitely is the serrated knife that severed the victims' fingers.
But?
but, um, I found a partial print in blood on the handle.
it doesn't match Hoffman or the oer victims.
I don't think hoffman was working alone.
die, you stupid mache!
she seems unfazed.
those are standard mossad style copy machine assault tactics, Mcgee.
she's fine.
Hey, Mcgee thinks you're raging against the machine 'cause you had to take down your serial killer boyfriend.
thanks for that.
Ziva, I was just concerned... - I am fine.
see? Mcgee?
she's a steely-eyed killer.
I don't know him. Borscht-belt comedian?
it is hebrew. For shut up.
really did affect you, huh?
have you had your mandatory session with the shrink?
Yes.
still crazy, then?
getting off your case.
well, you can stay on this one.
Abby found a partial print on the murder weapon that does not match our killer.
Hoffman had an accomplice?
that's one explanation.
could be a copycat killer.
copycats copy. They don't use the same weapon.
re-examine the crime scene, canvass Hoffman's neighborhood, take another look at the surveilnce video.
tomorrow.
go home. Been a long day.
get some rest.
you.
I do not need to see you here tomorrow.
anyone want to, uh, get a drink?
drink?
not tonight, Tony.
listen I wasn't trying to make light of what you went through.
just trying to snap you out of your head space, you know?
I have perfectly good space in my head.
great. Then let's get a drink.
you talk, I'll listen.
I don't want a drink.
okay. One drink. I'll talk, you listen.
Tony. No.
let me buy you the next one.
you working?
no.
no, really. I'm not working.
just... drinking.
coming up! - You're mixing your languages.
and my liquors.
not exactly the place to come if you're not othe case.
there's a thsand bars in this town.
I like the atmosphere. And Heidi...
makes Onkiller Mojito.
I thought maybe you took a shine to one of the patrons.
and you?
you are here, no doubt, in search of debbie?
Devon. - Potato, potahto.
Yeah, well, not searching. Just drinking.
so, tell me about Debbie. Just kidding.
Devon. Very pretty.
and smar T. Funny.
Teible sense of direction.
drive you insane with her incessant movie references.
worries about others more than herself. Generous to a fault.
no wonder you're looking for her. She sounds amazing.
other than the fact that we were totally incompatible, devon was perfect for me.
you miss her?
I'm not looking to get bac together with her. I just want to know shs okay.
I'm going to help you.
you already have. - How so?
by killing Hoffman. One less nightmare.
you okay?
never better.
thought you were taking the day.
Gibbs' idea. Not mine.
that Hoffman?
Yeah, I'm reviewing the tapes.
victim number three?
Monica bishop, judging by the dress.
look at this guy here.
he's watching 'em.
if Hoffman had an accomplice, he could very ll be him.
or he could just be a passerby.
there he goes.
look, he's heading in the same direction Hoffman took the girl.
or he could be going to a bar.
or he was checking to ma sure no one was following them, before joining Hoffman and killing the woman.
thats got to be Hoffman's accomplice.
man without a face.
spoke to the neighbors. They barely knew Hoffman. Guy was an enigma.
well, he still is.
found a stack of photos, too. Not a woman in any of them.
just Hoffman and his marine buddies.
any one of 'em a potential accomplice.
good a place to start as any.
Gibbs, I thought we closed the case on this one.
Yeah, well, found a partial print on Hoffman's knife that doesn't belong to him.
most seriakillers work alone.
Yeah. Most.
uldn't be the first time a killer worked with a partner.
you got the cook brothers, Eric and Lyle Menendez...
I wouldn't get too excited about a partial print on a knife-- it could be anything.
I need to review all the evidence you have.
I've already given you everything that I think is relevant.
well, then give me everything you think isn't.
Gibbs, you've got your killer, you've got all your bodies...
most of the bodies-- we're still missing five of the fingers that he cut off the victims.
doesn't mean that there's a second killer.
well, maybe Hoffman kept the bodies as a prize, and his accomplice got to keep the fingers.
DiNozzo. You were a cop.
tell your boss what it's like to have 20 open case files on your desk.
you know what, Rosetti? I don't care if you've got a hundred.
there could still be a killer out there.
well, I hope you weren't looking for me.
is that really what you are hoping?
not even close.
you know, I could, uh, I could buy you a drink, or...
or what?
you could come home with me.
why would I do that?
because you feel guilty about lying to me.
or because you just killed somebody and... need someone to hug.
why do I have the feeling that you are angling for more than just a hug?
Angling? No. Hoping?
have you been telling me the truth about your girlfriend?
or are you just taking advantage of my raw emotional state?
Yes. And... yes.
no, easy. Easy. Just reaching for my glasses.
you should not do that to me.
look... I don't usually do this kind of thing.
neither do I.
is that the gun you shot hoffman with? - No.
we struggled and then I-- no, it's not the gun.
so, uh what's it like to shoot someone?
it is what it is.
it is what you have to do.
these are not things I dwell upon.
were you scared?
no.
sorry. That's a... that's a dumb question.
I guess you wouldn't be an ncis agent if you had a problem with it.
I'm not an NCIS agent.
I am israeli mossad.
guessing Hoffman's not the first guy you've, uh...
why does everyone think all mossad agents are assassins?
are you?
you know, I've never handled a gun before.
well, you're not going to handle one now.
well, I guess I'll just have to handle something else.
I've re-sampled the image as many times as I can, Mcgee.
try removing compression artifacts.
it's too pixelated.
did you try detecting edges?
I am detecting an edge.
I'm good, Mcgee, but I can't work miracles. This is impossible.
I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times...
there is no substitute for quality source imagery. I know where are you going?
I am going back to work.
well, you think I'm going to give up that easily? You think I'm a quitter?
you, of all people should know that I thrive in the face of adversity.
you're making the face of adversity.
I found each of the victim's blood on the murder weapon.
Hoffman didn't clean the knife after each murder?
Oh, no, he did meticulously.
but I...I found trace evidence where the blade goes into the handle.
okay, look, four of the victims have blood type O-positive.
the fifth victim has blood type a-positive.
well, that's not that strange. Most killers don't chose their victims by blood type.
no, no, that's not what's strange.
I also found traces of B-positive.
than it must be Hoffman's blood.
no. He's O-gative. Not a match.
there's a sixth victim, mcgee.
whose body hasn't been found yet.
did she leave any forwarding number or address?
I'm afraid she didn't. - Okay.
well, if she makes contact, will you please notify me?
thank you. - You're welcome.
what are you doing?
checking on Locke's missing girlfriend. You?
same. - What? Why?
Devon Linden Katz. Yeah, not like the musical.
starts with a K, ends with a Z. Thanks. All right.
checking her medical records.
what, you think she's been lying in some hospital unable to communicate?
no. I think she's been lying in a shallow grave, unable to communicate.
medical records are privileged information. You need a subpoena.
not if you have an I. O.U. from a county clerk with a very expressive poker face.
there it is. Thanks, laramie. I owe you.
well, not as much as you owe me, of course. Right.
guess what Locke's girlfriend's ood type is?
the same blood typabby found on the knife-- B-positive.
although it's hard to be positive when the news is so negative.
millions have at blood type.
only ten percent of americans have that blood type so you have narrowed it down to what, millions?
narrows it down a lot further when you consider that she was a regular at the bar frequented by two other victims.
she could easily be victim number six.
and your pal Locke could be her killer.
he is not a killer. - Okay.
Co-killer, assistant killer, killer's apprentice.
michael was not involved in the murders.
that is his name.
that is his first name.
you didn't. No, don't tell me.
okay, tell me.
what I did or did not do is none of your business.
detective Rosetti, morning.
here are the case files your boss wanted.
sorry.
Hoffman's car.
Yep. All 786 square feet of dustable surface.
you find anything?
an impressive gum wrapper collection.
all right. Thanks for the files, detective.
you want the rest?
you guys wanted everything.
here's everything.
you didn't happ to make a digital catalogue of all the evidence, did you?
digitacatalogue, huh?
that'a good one. - Okay.
four boxes, four bags of evidence, four bags of personaeffects.
I am going to be here forever.
this one has your name written all over it. - Thank you.
got address book. That's great.
far, all of the prints from the car-- they match Hoffman.
there's justo sign of an accomplice.
what about the video still?
I have tried everything.
I just... I can't get an id.
you're admitting defeat?
no. I have a new tactical pl.
by triangulating the heights of the landmarks.
like the street lights and cars and stuff
I think I cafigure out an approximate height and weight of hoffman's alleged accomplice.
that's great. There's a page missing.
torn out. That's why the pages ll. Someone tore out the binding.
why would someone tear out a page?
how tall is your buddy Locke?
about six-one, six-two.
how much do you think he weighs?
why do you ask?
why don't you answer?
Abby calculated the height and the weight of the mystery man on the surveillance video.
six-one, 180, just like Locke.
well, the only thing that proves is that you are jealous.
I'm concerned.
slim build, just like Locke.
of course, with your hands-on experience last night, maybe you could elaborate.
saw you two leaving the bar together.
you followed me?
don't flatter yourself.
you do look good on the sveillance video, though.
add about ten pounds.
come with me, my love
address book belonged to Monica bishop, victim number three.
missing page is from the rs. - Pull up her phone records.
I want to tell you just how much I sea of love, boss. Remember that movie?
al Pacino plays a cop, sleeps with a serial killer played bellen Barkin?
but the zany twist here is, Ziva's Pacino, and Locke is Barkin.
might even be biting. - Shut your trap, Dinozzo!
am I missing something here?
boss, I got it.
matching calls bishop sent or received over the past year against the letter R.
er a two-week period last year, Rosetti call Bishop five times.
Rosetti never said boo about knowing the third victim.
he's covering for something. - Bring him in.
you know the ramifications tampering with evidence?
what are you talking about?
belonged to Monica bishop.
victim number three.
you forget?
nobody knows this case better than me, Gibbs.
well, I'm guessing you knew monica more than a little bit.
that why you tore the page out of this with your name and address on it?
how did it go down, Chris?
did you meet Hoffman in the same bar where you met Monica bishop?
what was your beef?
rejection?
jealousy?
Impotency?
I had an affair with Monica bishop. End of story.
feels more like the middle, actually.
d you help Hoffman, or you just watch?
go to hell, Gibbs.
you got the wrong story.
put me straight.
I met her at that bar six months ago.
she was a fixture there.
you could drag a dozen guys in here who slept with her.
she had it coming?
it was just an affai no big deal.
yeah? Then why'd you hide it?
she was married, I was married.
you don't tamper with evidence because your afraid your wife's gonna see it.
if my captain found out I slept with her, he would have taken me off the case.
well, he should have.
I wanted to catch this guy.
you were getting laid.
you wanted to protect your ass. - No.
I wanted the scumbag dead!
I was investigating the first two murders before she turned up as the third victim.
if you guys hadn't taken over this case, I would have caught Hoffman, and I would have popped him. Gladly.
Gibbs doesn't think Rosetti's the killer.
neither do I.
guess that just leaves your boyfriend.
you got to stop staring at this one, Ziva.
put it behind you.
you are seeing Locke?
you have a problem with that? - I if he's a suspect.
is he? - You tell me.
look, if you're going to give me a lecture on my bad judgment, I don't need to hear it.
is that what this is about?
you doubting your judgment?
I should've moved earlier.
you would've if you could've.
I left it too late.
you still took him out.
I almost died.
but you didn't.
you've got to trust your judgment, Ziva.
moment you don't...
it won't be "almost.
Devon, it's me.
did you tell Michael about us yet?
cause if you meant what you said last night, it's over between you two.
you've got to tell him about us.
cause if you don't, I will. - Who is he?
don't know yet. It's a deleted message from Devon Katz's phone.
locke's missing girlfriend.
mystery voice was obviously begging her to dump Locke.
how did we get the recording?
Ah, tell him, mcsneaky.
accessed the phone provider's mainframe.
what do we got on him?
he's been hanging on at the bar where two of the victims were last see we can tie him to Hoffman.
bartender says they were friendly.
locke reported Devon Katz missing two weeks ago.
covering his tracks.
no trace of her.
her blood type was B-positive.
same as the blood type abby found on the knife.
victim six?
my guess is Locke found out she was bouncy-bouncy with some other guy and he killed her.
you're wrong.
you've got to look at this objectively, Ziva.
evidence says he's guilty.
all circumcised.
uh, circumstantial.
I think she knows what she's talking about.
his print is on the barrel.
what are you doing?
trusting my dgment.
come on, you big band of belted butyl.
Oh, good. I could use some help here.
not tired of those things yet?
hold this, carefully. Locke's fingerprint's on it. Roll aside.
man's rk.
heavy.
thank you.
my... - what?
you brought me here for a reason.
I need some answers.
I thought you said you wanted to put this behind you.
how long is this gonna take?
just a few minutes.
you match the fingers to the victims yet?
I'm working on it, gib.
did you call Ziva? - Not answering, boss.
okay. So this one... no-brainer, easy to match.
I've always really liked this color. It's called arctic blue.
and the rest?
well, I'll give you a nd, Abby.
it shouldn't take as long.
so what went wrong?
ited too long.
I should have moved faster.
right about here...
there was nowhere left to go.
and we fell onto the floor.
we struggled, and then I pushed him.
Jethro, based on blood type, skin tone, angle of cut,
I am 95% certain that these belong to victims one, two, three and five.
as you'll recall, victim number four's finger, unlike the others, was severed immediately after death.
copycat theory sounding pretty good, boss.
whoever killed number four knew to cut off the finger, but didn't know hoffman was keeping them as souvenirs.
or where he stashed them.
I crawled.
I grabbed the gun.
I rolled over...
and there he was.
and you shot him.
I shot him.
I don't understand. Why didn't you shoot him earlier?
I was undercover.
I didn't have my gun.
just like now.
locke was all whorls.
bad guy, loops and arches.
locke is not the killer.
you owe Ziva an apology.
Yes, but we still have to account for victim number four's fier, cut off right after death.
Patricia Massey, military wife.
copycat hides her murder among Hoffman's victims.
husband?
always suspect the spouse.
speaking from personal experience, Jethro?
at's why I'm never getting married.
petty officer massey's build does match the guy following hoffman on the surveillance video.
call her.
ABS. - Yes, Gibbs?
lose the wheels.
what do you want, Tony?
locke's print doesn't match the partial.
his print is not a match? - Right.
well, next time we should both listen to my instcts. - Yeah.
was this about me?
w-was this about me, still a suspect?
I never believed it.
how'd you get my print? - You touched my gun.
so you took my fingerprintran it.
I didn't match up, and now you're telling me u never believed it was me?
look... I tried to stop this, okay?
I'm sorry, Melicha.
I wish I could believe you, Ziva, Gina... whatever.
Hey, something wrong?
like to talk to you. Need to come with us.
Yeah, we're a man short today. Can it wait?
no. - What's the probm?
got some theories on your wife's murder.
Yeah, you got the guy; he's dead.
we don't think Andy Hoffman killed her.
sure you want to do this here, Massey?
I got nothing to hide.
Hoffman was killing women who were cheating on their husbands.
you saying my wife was cheating on me?
probably why you were drinking at your favorite bar.
same bar Hoffman frequented.
same bar where he picked up two of his victims.
you noticed him, heard about the killings in the news. Put two and two together.
the night Hoffman picked up his third victim at the bar, you watched them leave.
not me.
you followed them back to Hoffman's house.
when he left and she didn't, you broke in.
it's pretty neat.
copycat killing using the same knife and M. O. as the original killer.
you guys got a wild imagination.
Yeah, well, the mistake you made, the thing you didn't know, is that Hoffman kept the fingers, except your wife's.
boy, that looks deep. - Working on the engine.
no. I think it's from cutting off your wife's finger.
we found a partial print and traces of blood on the murder weapon that don't match Hoffman or the victims.
DNA's going to narrow it down you.
what do you want?
telephone number. I found Devon.
I thought I owed you that much.
she wants to talk to you.
Thanks.
make it 20.
guess you owe me 20 bucks.
Oh, my God!
looks scrumptious!
they call it Chocoholic's Choice.
claim it is the ultimate cupcake.
Oh, that smells great.
don't you dare!
isn't this the week you're going gluten-free?
thank you, Ziva. You shouldn't have.
I owe you for letting me sleep at your place.
slumber party.
you two spent the night together?
what's going on here, McGee?
don't know, don't care.
none of my business, DiNosey.
you are such a control geek.
freak.
Yes. That, too.
why do you always need to know everything that everybody does, Tony?
what he needs to know is that a lieutenant commander's body was found in Rock Creek Park.
...identified as a female United States Navy Lieutenant Commander.
gear up. Her name is being withheld, pending notification of her next of kin.
lieutenant Commander Carrie McLellan, 35.
stationed at the Pentagon.
she worked as a congressional liaison officer for the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs.
lives alone in the Cleveland Park area.
help, DiNizzo.
single, small-caliber gunshot to the back.
no exit wound.
however, her death took place elsewhere.
this bloodstain to her back indicates she bled out on a solid surface.
time of death?
well, movement of the body and immersion in water complicates matters, but at least 12 hours, no more than 24.
I'll be able to be more accurate when I get her back on the table.
they were predicting precipitation.
just what we need.
got a partial shoeprint here, boss.
uh, boss?
work fast. It rains, we lose evidence.
Yeah. Gibbs.
stayed at Abby's last night, huh?
you guys, uh, sleep in the same room?
it is a one-bedroom apartment.
one bedroom, one bed.
one coffin.
you want the truth? - Yeah.
I think I can handle the truth.
my building was being fumigated, and Abby was kind enough to let me stay over.
on the couch.
in my pajamas.
come on, work with me. DiNozzo?
couldn't you lie just a little bit?
after you're through here, the victim's apartment.
right.
we're fighting the weather, and he wants us to hurry up, and then he leaves.
what is this all about?
senator?
gunny.
Hello, Patrick.
thanks for coming, Jethro.
Yeah, sure.
why here?
well, it's best we not be seen together right now.
I saw on the news, a lieutenant commander was found shot in Rock Creek Park.
NCIS involved?
I just left there.
was it Carrie McLellan?
did you know her?
did you know her?
we were having an affair.
why'd you think it was Carrie McClellan?
news report said the victim was a female lieutenant commander.
Carrie lived near the park.
we were supposed to meet last night.
she didn't show, didn't call.
try to reach her?
Carrie always made the contact.
nothing unusual about a congressional liaison calling a senator's office.
her parents been told?
not yet.
they'll be devastated.
she was an only child.
I'm an idiot, Gunny.
I've thrown my career away.
Lynn and the kids don't deserve this.
once the affair is made public, everyone is gonna think I killed her.
pat, I can't cover this up.
don't expect you to, Jethro.
tell me about the lieutenant commander.
she was an incredible young woman.
smart.
well-liked.
ex-boyfriends?
not that she mentioned. - Problems?
she had a run-in with her commanding officer.
yeah? She say what it was about?
not really.
he took exception to a report she wrote.
media's gonna have a field day with this.
couldn't have happened at a worse time.
my energy bill is up for vote next week.
it shouldn't be defeated because of my indiscretions.
legislation is far too important.
the economy is a mess, and fuel costs are leading the way.
this bill is a way of turning things around.
could you please keep my name out of this until after the vote?
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, it is sad.
it was her birthday last week.
her grandmother sent her this card.
am I the only one that's starving?
haven't eaten since lunch.
well, there's half a veggie pizza in the fridge.
what are you doing?
I'm building a profile of the victim.
not exactly Navy issue.
she was not just a Navy officer.
she was also a woman.
officer and a gentlewoman.
richard Gere. Debra Winger.
it's a rare commodity.
military chick flick.
it appears she had a lover.
to the woman I love.
you mean everything to me.
and it is signed, "You know who" .
why would he not sign his name?
well, maybe it's not a he.
maybe it's a she.
we are dealing with the military.
don't ask, don't tell.
looks like a man's handwriting.
definitely a man. - How do you know?
medicine cabinet. Low-estrogen birth control pills.
she's on the ninth day of her cycle.
you just love snooping around into other people's lives, don't you?
Yeah. That's why I became a cop.
Hey, boss.
everything all right?
Yeah.
no signs of a struggle.
didn't find any traces of blood.
the commander wasn't shot here.
the neighbors describe the victim as a loner.
no one knew her particularly well.
still looking her personal effects.
keys, wallet, cell phone.
her car's parked in her space downstairs.
she's got a lover who won't sign his name.
there's no pictures or evidence of him in the apartment.
boss, my gut tells me she was having an affair with a married man.
lieutenant Commander McLellan spent more time on the Hill than she did at the Pentagon, but that goes with her job.
when's the last time you saw her?
monday's staff meeting.
she had Top Secret clearance.
do I have a security problem here?
Oh, I don't know.
what were her responsibilities?
developing and coordinating relationships between representatives of the D. O.N.
and members of Congress.
she made a lot of powerful friends.
Carrie was on the fast track.
ever meet her boyfriend?
didn't know she had one.
don't really know anything about her personal life.
understand you took exception to a report Lieutenant Commander McLellan filed.
technical specs were supposedly leaked to a defense contractor a couple days before their official release.
it was no big deal.
never traced to my command.
McLellan wrote it up.
I told her not to.
she could be stubborn.
that it?
Yeah, for now.
gonna need to take a look at her office.
had it secured.
I'll make arrangements for you to get in.
hmm. That's odd. - What?
I'm looking at Commander McLellan's cell phone calls for the past month.
restaurants, family, nothing unusual.
but there is one number she called 36 times.
trace it.
I don't have to.
it's the Capitol switchboard.
well, that makes sense.
I am sure she has to call senators'
and representatives' offices all the time.
it's part of her job. That's exactly my point.
wouldn't she have their direct dial numbers?
how'd it go? - Admiral made an impression on DiNozzo.
I'm gonna check him out.
he was more interested in covering his ass than the victim.
you got anything, McGee?
I ran a locator search on McLellan's cell.
either her phone is turned off or the battery's died, so I pulled her phone records.
she made numerous calls to the Capitol, but always to the switchboard.
she didn't want her calls traced.
accessed her ESR.
she was fourth in her class at the academy.
been nothing but uphill since then.
awards and rapid promotions.
the family has not returned my call yet.
got a minute?
so, what's up with el jefe?
yesterday, he leaves the crime scene with no explanation.
today, he knew the admiral had a problem with the victim.
Where'd he get that?
maybe he's bluffing.
Uh-uh. It was on the nose.
whose nose?
on the money. Bull's-eye.
right as rain.
you were doing better before you went back to Israel.
you've reverted.
I found this message on my private line.
you have one saved message.
the gun that killed Lieutenant Commander McLellan can be found in the drainage ditch, alongside the two-mile marker, near the Grant Road entrance to Rock Creek Park.
it's so filthy.
I can't see anything.
it is filthy. Must be some kind of sewage thing or something.
it's not here.
someone's messing with us.
Hey!
I see something.
over here. Look.
look, look, look.
there. See that?
looks like a sort of shadowy thing.
here. Your turn.
I am the Jedi Master.
you are the Padawan learner.
no, it's...
farther.
farther out!
I can't go farther.
farther out! - I can't.
all right, here.
I gotcha. I gotcha.
you got me?
I'm holding you.
farther out. Here, hold on.
a little further.
what's that?
what do you got there?
see, I told you I saw something.
I had nothing to do with that one.
it's a Smith & Wesson 32 kit.
just like the gat Bogie was packing in Maltese Falcon.
it's the stuff dreams are made of.
out of my way.
any prints on the weapon?
Gibbs, it was underwater and covered in mud.
McGee found it with his butt.
the serial number remained intact.
I gave it to Ziva. She's running it down.
so, the test-fired slug is on the left.
and the one that Ducky removed from our victim is on the right.
you've got your murder weapon, Gibbs.
Yeah. Handed to us on a silver platter.
...near the Grant Road entrance to Rock Creek Park.
secure line, restricted number.
find out who made the call.
director Vance, I'll need the password to your voice mail account.
for your eyes only.
Yes, sir.
and the messages from my wife, not for your ears.
I understand.
go home. Change.
you think this is a catch-me-if-you-can?
the killer's taunting us?
possibility.
the lieutenant commander had Top Secret clearance.
worked on the Hill.
had a lot of high-profile contacts.
I'm going to need to be kept in the loop on this.
I've been on the case less than 24 hours.
when I get something concrete,
I will let you know.
Abby... what're you doing?
a boundary's been crossed, Gibbs.
I've been violated.
nothing is sacred anymore.
Yeah. Tell me.
someone stole my cupcake.
cupcake? - Yes.
and it wasn't just any cupcake.
it was a Chocoholic's Choice cupcake.
there is a thief amongst us.
I'm gonna find out who, and they're going to be sorry.
do you think you could pull yourself away from this long enough to focus on the murder?
I've been working, Gibbs.
commander McLellan...
she buys a lot of clothes online.
she downloads classical music, and she reads her horoscope every day, as do I.
today it said I was gonna have a positive encounter with a coworker.
not gonna happen.
that all you got?
no. Um, I also found fibers on the victim's clothing.
they're consistent with automobile carpet.
so, I'm running the fibers through the FBI fiber database to try to find out the make and... model.
what?
What?!
is that a cupcake crumb?
no.
we'll see.
Thanks, Jer.
you are indeed the man.
if Carrie McLellan had a married lover,
I've got a pretty good candidate.
her C. O.Admiral Graves.
What'd you find out?
he and the wife separated a year ago.
now they're back together, trying to make it work.
but my source at the Pentagon says he's still a player.
who's your source?
Jerry the barber.
a barber?
Yeah, works in the Pentagon Athletic Center.
overhears more gossip than anyone else in the building.
barbers, manicurists, shoe-shine guys
they're invisible.
people talk in front of them like they're not even there.
graves is involved.
you accusing an admiral,
DiNozzo? - Following my instincts.
boss, the anonymous call made to Director Vance came from a burn phone.
was purchased in cash from a convenience store in Arlington.
when?
more than a year ago.
surveillance video is only kept for a month.
call originated from a cell tower near Lafayette Park, across from the White House.
Oh, and I, I identified the voice.
who?
not exactly a "who."
the sly brown fox quickly jumped over the lazy dog.
it's a text reader from WriteDraft 2007.
the most sophisticated voice-generating software around.
are we gonna catch a break on this one?
I got lucky with the gun.
serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1949.
was never registered.
but the firing pin looked new, so I checked around.
turns out ten years ago, it was taken to a master gunsmith for restoration and cleaning.
the owner's name was...
he died in 1999.
no one leaves here till I get back.
okay.
now I'm officially curious.
we found the murder weapon.
that's a good thing, right? - Yeah.
owned by a Marine who's been dead nine years
Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.
smith & Wesson, 32 kit.
have you ever see it?
Yeah. Otis left it to me.
I don't understand.
it was in my den, locked in the gun cabinet with the rest of my collection.
where did you find it?
all right, I see where this is going.
I did not kill that woman.
I could never get anything by you.
you could always see right through my bull.
I'm telling you the truth.
I did not kill Carrie McLellan.
somebody's framing me.
it sure looks that way.
did Carrie get killed because of me?
Yeah, Gibbs.
I need you back at my office now.
what?
I gotta go.
I-I love you, too.
yeah?
When'd the call come in?
about an hour ago.
you have reached the voice mail of...
what's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.
when is an arrest going to be made?
is Special Agent Gibbs covering up for an old friend?
if there's something you've been holding back, now would be a very good time for you to tell me.
where the hell are you going?
director Vance.
senator Patrick Kiley.
I met Carrie about a year and a half ago.
she was helping me with two high school students from my state who I was sponsoring for admission to the academy.
I became fascinated.
her intelligence, wit, beauty.
I kept finding excuses to see her.
obviously, that was a mistake.
and when you heard she was dead, you called Special Agent Gibbs.
I knew the investigation would lead to me.
in Jethro's defense, the first thing he said was he wouldn't cover anything up.
senator's being framed.
by whom?
any enemies?
Oh, I'm a politician, Director Vance.
enemies come with the territory.
anyone in particular?
Yeah. Big oil money.
I hate to accuse anyone.
we're talking about murder.
no, Pat.
no, we're talking about you.
we're talking about your life, murder of a naval officer who might have been killed because of her association with you.
my energy bill is going to pass.
if I'm a suspect of a murder, the legislation is dead.
there's a lobbyist...
...Reed Talbot, who's been trying to dig up dirt on me.
would he have killed somebody over a bill not passing?
it could cost the oil companies tens of billions of dollars.
and the vote's next week.
Tuesday.
your status as a senator aside, this investigation will take us where it takes us.
but it's the agency's policy never to divulge details of an ongoing case.
thank you.
Hey, guys.
I identified the fibers I found on the lieutenant commander's clothing.
charcoal gray from the cargo compartment of a 2003 to 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
hmm. Must be hundreds of those in the metro area.
1267
open your mouth.
what? Why?
I need a DNA swab.
what's this about?
someone stole her cupcake.
no. It's an invasion of privacy.
McGee, I will get your DNA one way or the another.
do what the woman says.
she sleeps in a coffin.
Thanks. You're next.
Oh. Hmm. Can I do that myself?
I don't like people putting things in my mouth.
Thanks.
Abby, you're making too much of this.
I'll buy you another cupcake.
feeling guilty, Ziva?
I got you the cupcake.
no one is above suspicion.
is that, uh...?
Yes, it is.
Ziva, background on Reed Talbot.
lobbyist for oil interes.
McGee, Director got another anonymous phone call.
on it, boss.
come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.
need your DNA, Gibbs.
I'll show you to the study.
senator?
is everything all right, sir?
you haven't been answering your cell phone.
I turned if off, Cole. Everything's fine.
um, you know you missed the Press Club Dinner.
I know.
special Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo, this is Cole Erickson, my chief of staff.
we're here investigating a stolen weapon.
I'll explain it later, Cole.
I thought I heard a familiar voice.
I was going to give Patrick grief for disappearing tonight, but since he was with you,
I'll forgive him.
Hello, Lynn.
Hi. I'm Lynn.
Lynn, I wish it were, but this isn't a social visit.
Oh?
honey, we have to talk.
what's wrong?
would you take Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo into the study?
they're here to look at my gun cabinet.
mm, yes, sir.
right this way.
let's go in here.
look at that.
armed to the teeth.
desert Storm?
Yeah, our base camp in Doha.
you're that gunnery sergeant the senator always talks about.
we served together.
well, the way he tells it, you made a young, raw lieutenant look good.
it's locked.
know where the key is?
um... I believe the senator keeps it in his top drawer.
I got it.
thanks very much.
we'll let you know if we need anything.
well, some things never change.
door's unlocked, and you're down here working on that damn boat.
how you doing, Lynn?
I've had better days.
it is a six to five game, top of the seventh inning.
and the series is tied at two games apiece.
is the bar open?
digs in. There's the windup.
sure.
Oh, and a strike on the inside corner...
thank God the boys are away at school.
I had to get out of the house.
been driving around for hours.
realized I needed someone to talk to.
cause I promised the bastard I wouldn't tell anyone about his sleazy affair with the dead girl, but since you already know.
go. Talk.
you were there for me.
if you can get through Shannon and Kelly's deaths,
I can get through this.
gonna be tough.
a circus when the media gets a hold of it.
I'll tell you one thing, Jethro.
I am not going to be the dutiful wife, standing by his side at the press conference.
he got himself into this.
he can deal with it.
you knew about the affair?
not at first.
I mean, you suspect, but you don't want to believe it.
I didn't even know who the woman was.
I knew where they were meeting.
at his chief of staff's apartment.
I didn't like that weasel from day one.
seems very loyal.
loyal?
he'd do anything Patrick asked.
I think he's in love with my husband.
I've never seen him with a woman.
it's the fifth time he's called.
you can't keep avoiding him.
well, I'm not feeling very forgiving at the moment.
that'll come.
you need to go home.
thanks for listening, Jethro.
you know, as much as I hate Patrick at this moment, you and I both know he's a Marine to the core, and he would never shoot anyone, let alone a woman, in the back.
okay, talk to me, Abs.
Thanks.
um, okay, I analyzed all the prints from the gun cabinet, and I matched them all to the elimination prints that Tony took from Senator Kiley, his wife and the chief of staff, Cole Erickson.
there's was one right index finger that didn't belong to anybody.
I ran it through AFIS. Nothing.
did the senator have a-a housekeeper?
well, you'd think so.
what's that?
that the shoeprint McGee lifted from the crime scene?
um... no.
uh, the print that he lifted was from a metro policeman.
well, then, what's that?
I'm so close to a bust, Gibbs.
you cannot have my cupcake and eat it, too.
you're not serious.
dead.
the night janitor?
seems like he's...
recently put on a little weight.
look at the crooked grin on his face.
well, he's a lobbyist.
arm-twisting sleazebag.
to quote a Congressional aide
I interviewed this morning, "Reed Talbot will do anything in his power to defeat Senator Kiley's energy bill.
I have a feeling about this guy.
Yeah, I had a feeling about Admiral Graves.
even I can be wrong.
Abby's got a fingerprint she can't match.
Talbot's on file? - No.
checked. He has never been in the military or arrested.
Hey, are Cole Erickson's prints on the gun cabinet?
Yeah.
he's moving up my list.
he drives a 2006 Jeep Cherokee.
don't know what color the interior is, but I'm gonna find out.
that second anonymous call to the director was made from the same burn phone.
the same location? - No.
I need this.
what for?
Hey!
the call lasted 26 seconds.
started on this cell tower.
halfway through, transferred to this one.
the caller was in a vehicle, traveling westbound on Independence.
probably used a laptop to generate the voice.
excuse me, sir.
do you have a minute?
sure.
I am collecting signatures for a national referendum.
what's it about?
there is a movement trying to reintroduce the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit to reduce fuel consumption.
we are against it.
do you know who I am?
a very handsome man who looks like he keeps himself in shape.
where do I sign?
phone number and e-mail?
that's optional...
well, I'll be happy to give them...
uh, to you.
thank you very much.
my pleasure.
here's the number of Erickson's PDA.
trace it.
I'm in the middle of something. - Now!
Cole Erickson's Jeep has a charcoal gray interior.
matches the fiber Abby found on the victim.
get a look at the vehicle. Can't find Erickson.
not answering his phones.
called the Senator's office, Erickson never showed for work this morning-- they're looking for him, too.
PDA's on. Where is it?
watergate Complex.
Erickson has an apartment there.
Yeah, we're here.
is it still on?
Yeah. - Location?
McGee says the PDA's still on at this location.
give me a key.
keep the hallway clear.
Mr. Erickson, NCIS!
clear.
boss?
it's a suicide note.
the suicide note was written and printed on this computer.
Erickson's Grand Cherokee is still in his parking space.
having it towed to the evidence garage.
looks like you were wrong about Reed Talbot. He's still a crumb bag.
Hey, you got something?
Yes, this area of the carpet was recently cleaned.
I will get the ALS.
I can give you a preliminary cause of death.
asphyxia.
Yes, well, it is rather obvious, isn't it?
would you care to venture the time of death?
little after 10: 00 this morning.
I'm not feeling very needed.
on what do you base your reasoning?
suicide note was written at 10: 02.
found this in the desk.
it's the burn phone Erickson used to make the anonymous calls to the director.
the laptop has WriteDraft Text Reader.
listen to this.
what's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.
visitor.
Cole's body is still in there?
can I see him?
it's a secure crime scene, Pat.
I just can't believe Cole would do this.
when did he learn about your affair?
he knew from the beginning.
he let us use his apartment.
what was his relationship with her?
didn't really have one that I know of.
he met her a few times.
I had my own key, so he was usually gone before we got here.
if what you're asking is, did Cole disapprove?
Yes.
he left a note.
full confession.
admitted making the calls to NCIS.
addressed to you.
blood.
asphyxia confirmed.
and I found a large quantity of diazepam in his stomach and bloodstream.
a depressant?
well, it's not unusual.
suicides often take drugs to relax so they won't change their mind, and in his case, pull the bag off his head.
you got an opinion?
it doesn't feel right.
we were handed the gun and a suicide confession-- it's too easy.
senator Kiley is holding a press conference in two hours.
I've been asked to attend.
I would like to be able to confirm that this case is solved, but I'm getting the feeling that you don't think so.
hell, you can get a lot done in two hours, Leon.
Hey.
you looking for me, Tony?
no.
I am.
do you think I'm an idiot?
no.
what, you thought I wouldn't figure it out?
what is she talking about?
the cupcake.
you stole it from my refrigerator!
I have forensic evidence.
your big fat fingerprint.
Oh, come on, you think I'm that stupid?
look, if I was going to steal your precious cupcake,
I would not leave a fingerprint on your refrigerator.
you didn't.
you used latex gloves.
brand-new box, McGee.
only prints...
mine and yours.
you said you were going gluten-free.
where is it, McGee?
I was saving you from yourself, Abby.
where did you "save it," McGee?
okay, I ate it.
look, it was late.
I hadn't eaten since lunch.
th-th-the machine in the break room was empty, and it looked so good.
what were you thinking, McGee?
she's a world-class forensic scientist. Thank you, Tony.
I bought the cupcake for Abby.
so...
how was it?
it was life-changing.
book him, Danno.
Ah, break it up, we've got work to do.
we have a confession.
the blood on the carpet was Carrie McLellan's.
she was killed at Erickson's apartment.
and more of her blood was in the back of his truck.
that's how he moved the body to the park.
McGee, pull Erickson's phone company records for his PDA.
find out if his device was used during these dates and times.
got you, boss.
your two hours are up.
appreciate your showing up.
it's good to have the support of an old friend.
I'm not here to support you.
let's...
I'm here to arrest you, Pat.
this a joke?
I don't think so.
Cole Erickson's confession didn't pan out.
he wasn't the anonymous caller.
at the time you got the second tip from the burn phone,
Erickson... he was 50 miles away talking to his mother on his PDA.
you placed those calls, Pat.
when you were coming to meet me at the Tidal Basin.
Jethro, I...
no, no, you traded on our friendship.
you did know that the investigation of Commander McLellan's murder would lead to you.
so you came to me, and you volunteered the information.
I should have known I'd never get it by you.
I shot Carrie.
no, you didn't.
you said that I'd always know when you were lying.
well, you're lying right now.
no, I... Why would I...?
don't say any more, Patrick.
your mistake, Lynn: coming to me, saying to me that Pat would never shoot anybody in the back.
that detail was never released.
you never should have gone to him.
what the hell happened to you two?
I didn't go to Cole's apartment to kill her.
I took my father's gun to scare her off.
she got defensive and said terrible things.
I lost it.
I don't even remember pulling the trigger.
I got there right after it happened.
I wasn't going to let Lynn go to prison for something that was ultimately my fault, so when Cole got home, I persuaded him to help me dispose of the body.
it was an accident.
maybe... but the murder of Cole Erickson was cold and was premeditated.
framed him.
made it look like suicide to save yourselves.
you murdered him.
do we need to leave with handcuffs?
you are all out of favors, Pat.
earlier today, NCIS agents arrested
senator Patrick Kiley and his wife, Lynn Tripp Kiley, for the murders of Lieutenant Commander Carrie McLellan and Cole Erickson, the senator's chief of staff.
welcome to Washington.
would have appreciated a heads-up before the arrest.
you covered good.
trust.
loyalty.
they're important.
guess you know all about that after today.
how do you think we're gonna do in that department?
can't keep up? Ten bucks says I beat you to the car.
make it 20.
guess you owe me 20 bucks.
Oh, my God!
looks scrumptious!
they call it Chocoholic's Choice.
claim it is the ultimate cupcake.
Oh, that smells great.
don't you dare!
isn't this the week you're going gluten-free?
thank you, Ziva. You shouldn't have.
I owe you for letting me sleep at your place.
slumber party.
you two spent the night together?
what's going on here, McGee?
don't know, don't care.
none of my business, DiNosey.
you are such a control geek.
freak.
Yes. That, too.
why do you always need to know everything that everybody does, Tony?
what he needs to know is that a lieutenant commander's body was found in Rock Creek Park.
...identified as a female United States Navy Lieutenant Commander.
gear up. Her name is being withheld, pending notification of her next of kin.
lieutenant Commander Carrie McLellan, 35.
stationed at the Pentagon.
she worked as a congressional liaison officer for the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs.
lives alone in the Cleveland Park area.
help, DiNizzo.
single, small-caliber gunshot to the back.
no exit wound.
however, her death took place elsewhere.
this bloodstain to her back indicates she bled out on a solid surface.
time of death?
well, movement of the body and immersion in water complicates matters, but at least 12 hours, no more than 24.
I'll be able to be more accurate when I get her back on the table.
they were predicting precipitation.
just what we need.
got a partial shoeprint here, boss.
uh, boss?
work fast. It rains, we lose evidence.
Yeah. Gibbs.
stayed at Abby's last night, huh?
you guys, uh, sleep in the same room?
it is a one-bedroom apartment.
one bedroom, one bed.
one coffin.
you want the truth? - Yeah.
I think I can handle the truth.
my building was being fumigated, and Abby was kind enough to let me stay over.
on the couch.
in my pajamas.
come on, work with me. DiNozzo?
couldn't you lie just a little bit?
after you're through here, the victim's apartment.
right.
we're fighting the weather, and he wants us to hurry up, and then he leaves.
what is this all about?
senator?
gunny.
Hello, Patrick.
thanks for coming, Jethro.
Yeah, sure.
why here?
well, it's best we not be seen together right now.
I saw on the news, a lieutenant commander was found shot in Rock Creek Park.
NCIS involved?
I just left there.
was it Carrie McLellan?
did you know her?
did you know her?
we were having an affair.
why'd you think it was Carrie McClellan?
news report said the victim was a female lieutenant commander.
Carrie lived near the park.
we were supposed to meet last night.
she didn't show, didn't call.
try to reach her?
Carrie always made the contact.
nothing unusual about a congressional liaison calling a senator's office.
her parents been told?
not yet.
they'll be devastated.
she was an only child.
I'm an idiot, Gunny.
I've thrown my career away.
Lynn and the kids don't deserve this.
once the affair is made public, everyone is gonna think I killed her.
pat, I can't cover this up.
don't expect you to, Jethro.
tell me about the lieutenant commander.
she was an incredible young woman.
smart.
well-liked.
ex-boyfriends?
not that she mentioned. - Problems?
she had a run-in with her commanding officer.
yeah? She say what it was about?
not really.
he took exception to a report she wrote.
media's gonna have a field day with this.
couldn't have happened at a worse time.
my energy bill is up for vote next week.
it shouldn't be defeated because of my indiscretions.
legislation is far too important.
the economy is a mess, and fuel costs are leading the way.
this bill is a way of turning things around.
could you please keep my name out of this until after the vote?
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, it is sad.
it was her birthday last week.
her grandmother sent her this card.
am I the only one that's starving?
haven't eaten since lunch.
well, there's half a veggie pizza in the fridge.
what are you doing?
I'm building a profile of the victim.
not exactly Navy issue.
she was not just a Navy officer.
she was also a woman.
officer and a gentlewoman.
richard Gere. Debra Winger.
it's a rare commodity.
military chick flick.
it appears she had a lover.
to the woman I love.
you mean everything to me.
and it is signed, "You know who" .
why would he not sign his name?
well, maybe it's not a he.
maybe it's a she.
we are dealing with the military.
don't ask, don't tell.
looks like a man's handwriting.
definitely a man. - How do you know?
medicine cabinet. Low-estrogen birth control pills.
she's on the ninth day of her cycle.
you just love snooping around into other people's lives, don't you?
Yeah. That's why I became a cop.
Hey, boss.
everything all right?
Yeah.
no signs of a struggle.
didn't find any traces of blood.
the commander wasn't shot here.
the neighbors describe the victim as a loner.
no one knew her particularly well.
still looking her personal effects.
keys, wallet, cell phone.
her car's parked in her space downstairs.
she's got a lover who won't sign his name.
there's no pictures or evidence of him in the apartment.
boss, my gut tells me she was having an affair with a married man.
lieutenant Commander McLellan spent more time on the Hill than she did at the Pentagon, but that goes with her job.
when's the last time you saw her?
monday's staff meeting.
she had Top Secret clearance.
do I have a security problem here?
Oh, I don't know.
what were her responsibilities?
developing and coordinating relationships between representatives of the D. O.N.
and members of Congress.
she made a lot of powerful friends.
Carrie was on the fast track.
ever meet her boyfriend?
didn't know she had one.
don't really know anything about her personal life.
understand you took exception to a report Lieutenant Commander McLellan filed.
technical specs were supposedly leaked to a defense contractor a couple days before their official release.
it was no big deal.
never traced to my command.
McLellan wrote it up.
I told her not to.
she could be stubborn.
that it?
Yeah, for now.
gonna need to take a look at her office.
had it secured.
I'll make arrangements for you to get in.
hmm. That's odd. - What?
I'm looking at Commander McLellan's cell phone calls for the past month.
restaurants, family, nothing unusual.
but there is one number she called 36 times.
trace it.
I don't have to.
it's the Capitol switchboard.
well, that makes sense.
I am sure she has to call senators'
and representatives' offices all the time.
it's part of her job. That's exactly my point.
wouldn't she have their direct dial numbers?
how'd it go? - Admiral made an impression on DiNozzo.
I'm gonna check him out.
he was more interested in covering his ass than the victim.
you got anything, McGee?
I ran a locator search on McLellan's cell.
either her phone is turned off or the battery's died, so I pulled her phone records.
she made numerous calls to the Capitol, but always to the switchboard.
she didn't want her calls traced.
accessed her ESR.
she was fourth in her class at the academy.
been nothing but uphill since then.
awards and rapid promotions.
the family has not returned my call yet.
got a minute?
so, what's up with el jefe?
yesterday, he leaves the crime scene with no explanation.
today, he knew the admiral had a problem with the victim.
Where'd he get that?
maybe he's bluffing.
Uh-uh. It was on the nose.
whose nose?
on the money. Bull's-eye.
right as rain.
you were doing better before you went back to Israel.
you've reverted.
I found this message on my private line.
you have one saved message.
the gun that killed Lieutenant Commander McLellan can be found in the drainage ditch, alongside the two-mile marker, near the Grant Road entrance to Rock Creek Park.
it's so filthy.
I can't see anything.
it is filthy. Must be some kind of sewage thing or something.
it's not here.
someone's messing with us.
Hey!
I see something.
over here. Look.
look, look, look.
there. See that?
looks like a sort of shadowy thing.
here. Your turn.
I am the Jedi Master.
you are the Padawan learner.
no, it's...
farther.
farther out!
I can't go farther.
farther out! - I can't.
all right, here.
I gotcha. I gotcha.
you got me?
I'm holding you.
farther out. Here, hold on.
a little further.
what's that?
what do you got there?
see, I told you I saw something.
I had nothing to do with that one.
it's a Smith & Wesson 32 kit.
just like the gat Bogie was packing in Maltese Falcon.
it's the stuff dreams are made of.
out of my way.
any prints on the weapon?
Gibbs, it was underwater and covered in mud.
McGee found it with his butt.
the serial number remained intact.
I gave it to Ziva. She's running it down.
so, the test-fired slug is on the left.
and the one that Ducky removed from our victim is on the right.
you've got your murder weapon, Gibbs.
Yeah. Handed to us on a silver platter.
...near the Grant Road entrance to Rock Creek Park.
secure line, restricted number.
find out who made the call.
director Vance, I'll need the password to your voice mail account.
for your eyes only.
Yes, sir.
and the messages from my wife, not for your ears.
I understand.
go home. Change.
you think this is a catch-me-if-you-can?
the killer's taunting us?
possibility.
the lieutenant commander had Top Secret clearance.
worked on the Hill.
had a lot of high-profile contacts.
I'm going to need to be kept in the loop on this.
I've been on the case less than 24 hours.
when I get something concrete,
I will let you know.
Abby... what're you doing?
a boundary's been crossed, Gibbs.
I've been violated.
nothing is sacred anymore.
Yeah. Tell me.
someone stole my cupcake.
cupcake? - Yes.
and it wasn't just any cupcake.
it was a Chocoholic's Choice cupcake.
there is a thief amongst us.
I'm gonna find out who, and they're going to be sorry.
do you think you could pull yourself away from this long enough to focus on the murder?
I've been working, Gibbs.
commander McLellan...
she buys a lot of clothes online.
she downloads classical music, and she reads her horoscope every day, as do I.
today it said I was gonna have a positive encounter with a coworker.
not gonna happen.
that all you got?
no. Um, I also found fibers on the victim's clothing.
they're consistent with automobile carpet.
so, I'm running the fibers through the FBI fiber database to try to find out the make and... model.
what?
What?!
is that a cupcake crumb?
no.
we'll see.
Thanks, Jer.
you are indeed the man.
if Carrie McLellan had a married lover,
I've got a pretty good candidate.
her C. O.Admiral Graves.
What'd you find out?
he and the wife separated a year ago.
now they're back together, trying to make it work.
but my source at the Pentagon says he's still a player.
who's your source?
Jerry the barber.
a barber?
Yeah, works in the Pentagon Athletic Center.
overhears more gossip than anyone else in the building.
barbers, manicurists, shoe-shine guys
they're invisible.
people talk in front of them like they're not even there.
graves is involved.
you accusing an admiral,
DiNozzo? - Following my instincts.
boss, the anonymous call made to Director Vance came from a burn phone.
was purchased in cash from a convenience store in Arlington.
when?
more than a year ago.
surveillance video is only kept for a month.
call originated from a cell tower near Lafayette Park, across from the White House.
Oh, and I, I identified the voice.
who?
not exactly a "who."
the sly brown fox quickly jumped over the lazy dog.
it's a text reader from WriteDraft 2007.
the most sophisticated voice-generating software around.
are we gonna catch a break on this one?
I got lucky with the gun.
serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1949.
was never registered.
but the firing pin looked new, so I checked around.
turns out ten years ago, it was taken to a master gunsmith for restoration and cleaning.
the owner's name was...
he died in 1999.
no one leaves here till I get back.
okay.
now I'm officially curious.
we found the murder weapon.
that's a good thing, right? - Yeah.
owned by a Marine who's been dead nine years
Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.
smith & Wesson, 32 kit.
have you ever see it?
Yeah. Otis left it to me.
I don't understand.
it was in my den, locked in the gun cabinet with the rest of my collection.
where did you find it?
all right, I see where this is going.
I did not kill that woman.
I could never get anything by you.
you could always see right through my bull.
I'm telling you the truth.
I did not kill Carrie McLellan.
somebody's framing me.
it sure looks that way.
did Carrie get killed because of me?
Yeah, Gibbs.
I need you back at my office now.
what?
I gotta go.
I-I love you, too.
yeah?
When'd the call come in?
about an hour ago.
you have reached the voice mail of...
what's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.
when is an arrest going to be made?
is Special Agent Gibbs covering up for an old friend?
if there's something you've been holding back, now would be a very good time for you to tell me.
where the hell are you going?
director Vance.
senator Patrick Kiley.
I met Carrie about a year and a half ago.
she was helping me with two high school students from my state who I was sponsoring for admission to the academy.
I became fascinated.
her intelligence, wit, beauty.
I kept finding excuses to see her.
obviously, that was a mistake.
and when you heard she was dead, you called Special Agent Gibbs.
I knew the investigation would lead to me.
in Jethro's defense, the first thing he said was he wouldn't cover anything up.
senator's being framed.
by whom?
any enemies?
Oh, I'm a politician, Director Vance.
enemies come with the territory.
anyone in particular?
Yeah. Big oil money.
I hate to accuse anyone.
we're talking about murder.
no, Pat.
no, we're talking about you.
we're talking about your life, murder of a naval officer who might have been killed because of her association with you.
my energy bill is going to pass.
if I'm a suspect of a murder, the legislation is dead.
there's a lobbyist...
...Reed Talbot, who's been trying to dig up dirt on me.
would he have killed somebody over a bill not passing?
it could cost the oil companies tens of billions of dollars.
and the vote's next week.
Tuesday.
your status as a senator aside, this investigation will take us where it takes us.
but it's the agency's policy never to divulge details of an ongoing case.
thank you.
Hey, guys.
I identified the fibers I found on the lieutenant commander's clothing.
charcoal gray from the cargo compartment of a 2003 to 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
hmm. Must be hundreds of those in the metro area.
1267
open your mouth.
what? Why?
I need a DNA swab.
what's this about?
someone stole her cupcake.
no. It's an invasion of privacy.
McGee, I will get your DNA one way or the another.
do what the woman says.
she sleeps in a coffin.
Thanks. You're next.
Oh. Hmm. Can I do that myself?
I don't like people putting things in my mouth.
Thanks.
Abby, you're making too much of this.
I'll buy you another cupcake.
feeling guilty, Ziva?
I got you the cupcake.
no one is above suspicion.
is that, uh...?
Yes, it is.
Ziva, background on Reed Talbot.
lobbyist for oil interes.
McGee, Director got another anonymous phone call.
on it, boss.
come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.
need your DNA, Gibbs.
I'll show you to the study.
senator?
is everything all right, sir?
you haven't been answering your cell phone.
I turned if off, Cole. Everything's fine.
um, you know you missed the Press Club Dinner.
I know.
special Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo, this is Cole Erickson, my chief of staff.
we're here investigating a stolen weapon.
I'll explain it later, Cole.
I thought I heard a familiar voice.
I was going to give Patrick grief for disappearing tonight, but since he was with you,
I'll forgive him.
Hello, Lynn.
Hi. I'm Lynn.
Lynn, I wish it were, but this isn't a social visit.
Oh?
honey, we have to talk.
what's wrong?
would you take Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo into the study?
they're here to look at my gun cabinet.
mm, yes, sir.
right this way.
let's go in here.
look at that.
armed to the teeth.
desert Storm?
Yeah, our base camp in Doha.
you're that gunnery sergeant the senator always talks about.
we served together.
well, the way he tells it, you made a young, raw lieutenant look good.
it's locked.
know where the key is?
um... I believe the senator keeps it in his top drawer.
I got it.
thanks very much.
we'll let you know if we need anything.
well, some things never change.
door's unlocked, and you're down here working on that damn boat.
how you doing, Lynn?
I've had better days.
it is a six to five game, top of the seventh inning.
and the series is tied at two games apiece.
is the bar open?
digs in. There's the windup.
sure.
Oh, and a strike on the inside corner...
thank God the boys are away at school.
I had to get out of the house.
been driving around for hours.
realized I needed someone to talk to.
cause I promised the bastard I wouldn't tell anyone about his sleazy affair with the dead girl, but since you already know.
go. Talk.
you were there for me.
if you can get through Shannon and Kelly's deaths,
I can get through this.
gonna be tough.
a circus when the media gets a hold of it.
I'll tell you one thing, Jethro.
I am not going to be the dutiful wife, standing by his side at the press conference.
he got himself into this.
he can deal with it.
you knew about the affair?
not at first.
I mean, you suspect, but you don't want to believe it.
I didn't even know who the woman was.
I knew where they were meeting.
at his chief of staff's apartment.
I didn't like that weasel from day one.
seems very loyal.
loyal?
he'd do anything Patrick asked.
I think he's in love with my husband.
I've never seen him with a woman.
it's the fifth time he's called.
you can't keep avoiding him.
well, I'm not feeling very forgiving at the moment.
that'll come.
you need to go home.
thanks for listening, Jethro.
you know, as much as I hate Patrick at this moment, you and I both know he's a Marine to the core, and he would never shoot anyone, let alone a woman, in the back.
okay, talk to me, Abs.
Thanks.
um, okay, I analyzed all the prints from the gun cabinet, and I matched them all to the elimination prints that Tony took from Senator Kiley, his wife and the chief of staff, Cole Erickson.
there's was one right index finger that didn't belong to anybody.
I ran it through AFIS. Nothing.
did the senator have a-a housekeeper?
well, you'd think so.
what's that?
that the shoeprint McGee lifted from the crime scene?
um... no.
uh, the print that he lifted was from a metro policeman.
well, then, what's that?
I'm so close to a bust, Gibbs.
you cannot have my cupcake and eat it, too.
you're not serious.
dead.
the night janitor?
seems like he's...
recently put on a little weight.
look at the crooked grin on his face.
well, he's a lobbyist.
arm-twisting sleazebag.
to quote a Congressional aide
I interviewed this morning, "Reed Talbot will do anything in his power to defeat Senator Kiley's energy bill.
I have a feeling about this guy.
Yeah, I had a feeling about Admiral Graves.
even I can be wrong.
Abby's got a fingerprint she can't match.
Talbot's on file? - No.
checked. He has never been in the military or arrested.
Hey, are Cole Erickson's prints on the gun cabinet?
Yeah.
he's moving up my list.
he drives a 2006 Jeep Cherokee.
don't know what color the interior is, but I'm gonna find out.
that second anonymous call to the director was made from the same burn phone.
the same location? - No.
I need this.
what for?
Hey!
the call lasted 26 seconds.
started on this cell tower.
halfway through, transferred to this one.
the caller was in a vehicle, traveling westbound on Independence.
probably used a laptop to generate the voice.
excuse me, sir.
do you have a minute?
sure.
I am collecting signatures for a national referendum.
what's it about?
there is a movement trying to reintroduce the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit to reduce fuel consumption.
we are against it.
do you know who I am?
a very handsome man who looks like he keeps himself in shape.
where do I sign?
phone number and e-mail?
that's optional...
well, I'll be happy to give them...
uh, to you.
thank you very much.
my pleasure.
here's the number of Erickson's PDA.
trace it.
I'm in the middle of something. - Now!
Cole Erickson's Jeep has a charcoal gray interior.
matches the fiber Abby found on the victim.
get a look at the vehicle. Can't find Erickson.
not answering his phones.
called the Senator's office, Erickson never showed for work this morning-- they're looking for him, too.
PDA's on. Where is it?
watergate Complex.
Erickson has an apartment there.
Yeah, we're here.
is it still on?
Yeah. - Location?
McGee says the PDA's still on at this location.
give me a key.
keep the hallway clear.
Mr. Erickson, NCIS!
clear.
boss?
it's a suicide note.
the suicide note was written and printed on this computer.
Erickson's Grand Cherokee is still in his parking space.
having it towed to the evidence garage.
looks like you were wrong about Reed Talbot. He's still a crumb bag.
Hey, you got something?
Yes, this area of the carpet was recently cleaned.
I will get the ALS.
I can give you a preliminary cause of death.
asphyxia.
Yes, well, it is rather obvious, isn't it?
would you care to venture the time of death?
little after 10: 00 this morning.
I'm not feeling very needed.
on what do you base your reasoning?
suicide note was written at 10: 02.
found this in the desk.
it's the burn phone Erickson used to make the anonymous calls to the director.
the laptop has WriteDraft Text Reader.
listen to this.
what's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.
visitor.
Cole's body is still in there?
can I see him?
it's a secure crime scene, Pat.
I just can't believe Cole would do this.
when did he learn about your affair?
he knew from the beginning.
he let us use his apartment.
what was his relationship with her?
didn't really have one that I know of.
he met her a few times.
I had my own key, so he was usually gone before we got here.
if what you're asking is, did Cole disapprove?
Yes.
he left a note.
full confession.
admitted making the calls to NCIS.
addressed to you.
blood.
asphyxia confirmed.
and I found a large quantity of diazepam in his stomach and bloodstream.
a depressant?
well, it's not unusual.
suicides often take drugs to relax so they won't change their mind, and in his case, pull the bag off his head.
you got an opinion?
it doesn't feel right.
we were handed the gun and a suicide confession-- it's too easy.
senator Kiley is holding a press conference in two hours.
I've been asked to attend.
I would like to be able to confirm that this case is solved, but I'm getting the feeling that you don't think so.
hell, you can get a lot done in two hours, Leon.
Hey.
you looking for me, Tony?
no.
I am.
do you think I'm an idiot?
no.
what, you thought I wouldn't figure it out?
what is she talking about?
the cupcake.
you stole it from my refrigerator!
I have forensic evidence.
your big fat fingerprint.
Oh, come on, you think I'm that stupid?
look, if I was going to steal your precious cupcake,
I would not leave a fingerprint on your refrigerator.
you didn't.
you used latex gloves.
brand-new box, McGee.
only prints...
mine and yours.
you said you were going gluten-free.
where is it, McGee?
I was saving you from yourself, Abby.
where did you "save it," McGee?
okay, I ate it.
look, it was late.
I hadn't eaten since lunch.
th-th-the machine in the break room was empty, and it looked so good.
what were you thinking, McGee?
she's a world-class forensic scientist. Thank you, Tony.
I bought the cupcake for Abby.
so...
how was it?
it was life-changing.
book him, Danno.
Ah, break it up, we've got work to do.
we have a confession.
the blood on the carpet was Carrie McLellan's.
she was killed at Erickson's apartment.
and more of her blood was in the back of his truck.
that's how he moved the body to the park.
McGee, pull Erickson's phone company records for his PDA.
find out if his device was used during these dates and times.
got you, boss.
your two hours are up.
appreciate your showing up.
it's good to have the support of an old friend.
I'm not here to support you.
let's...
I'm here to arrest you, Pat.
this a joke?
I don't think so.
Cole Erickson's confession didn't pan out.
he wasn't the anonymous caller.
at the time you got the second tip from the burn phone,
Erickson... he was 50 miles away talking to his mother on his PDA.
you placed those calls, Pat.
when you were coming to meet me at the Tidal Basin.
Jethro, I...
no, no, you traded on our friendship.
you did know that the investigation of Commander McLellan's murder would lead to you.
so you came to me, and you volunteered the information.
I should have known I'd never get it by you.
I shot Carrie.
no, you didn't.
you said that I'd always know when you were lying.
well, you're lying right now.
no, I... Why would I...?
don't say any more, Patrick.
your mistake, Lynn: coming to me, saying to me that Pat would never shoot anybody in the back.
that detail was never released.
you never should have gone to him.
what the hell happened to you two?
I didn't go to Cole's apartment to kill her.
I took my father's gun to scare her off.
she got defensive and said terrible things.
I lost it.
I don't even remember pulling the trigger.
I got there right after it happened.
I wasn't going to let Lynn go to prison for something that was ultimately my fault, so when Cole got home, I persuaded him to help me dispose of the body.
it was an accident.
maybe... but the murder of Cole Erickson was cold and was premeditated.
framed him.
made it look like suicide to save yourselves.
you murdered him.
do we need to leave with handcuffs?
you are all out of favors, Pat.
earlier today, NCIS agents arrested
senator Patrick Kiley and his wife, Lynn Tripp Kiley, for the murders of Lieutenant Commander Carrie McLellan and Cole Erickson, the senator's chief of staff.
welcome to Washington.
would have appreciated a heads-up before the arrest.
you covered good.
trust.
loyalty.
they're important.
guess you know all about that after today.
how do you think we're gonna do in that department?
langer was in possession of Domino when Lee killed him.
we're gonna steal it.
nobody gets hurt.
it was a trap.
there's a mole at NCIS.
you mean, Langer was not alone?
do you know who it is?
liar! He wasn't part of it.
who are they?! I don't know!
this is Amanda.
she's my daughter.
if I don't deliver what they want, they will kill her.
what am I supposed to do?
looks like we're working together.
Hey, stop!
come back!
Hey!
Hey!
there you go.
all right.
Thanks.
you know what I hate?
women with discriminating taste?
coffee shops without restrooms.
you're not actually drinking that, are you?
we're on a stakeout.
I was up late last night. I'm tired.
what?
this is probie 1 stuff.
you don't actually drink.
I call it the Gibb-sip.
see that? Yeah.
looks like I'm drinking?
Yeah.
not actually drinking.
and I've been...
you know, come to think of it, it always looks like Gibbs is drinking, but he never has to take a...
DiNozzo, change the subject.
gonna have to change more than the subject if I don't get a bathroom break soon, boss.
hold it.
lee's on your ten, DiNozzo
got her on my crosshairs.
finger the trigger.
Hi. How are you?
show some sympathy, Tony
her daughter's out there somewhere.
she lied about killing two men, lied about stealing secrets.
how do we know she's not lying about her daughter, who nobody's ever seen?
the pickup man shows, she's not lying.
here you go.
thank you. Thank you.
either Lee is very anal, or she's sending someone a signal.
I smell a non-fat soy double-cross latte.
here we go.
boss, we got a guy in a scarf, sunglasses and a hat.
that's him.
on his tail, DiNozzo
got him.
Oh, my God! Oh!
I am so sorry.
lost visual. Get on him.
I know. No. Get out of my way.
sorry, sir. I got him. Where is he?
parking structure.
just let me get that.
I'm so... Ugh!
boss, we lost him.
Lee, what the hell were you thinking?
you were too close. He could have made you.
my show. My call.
my car. Now.
heard you had a little accident.
wasn't an accident.
any news about my daughter?
NSA got a hit.
they're downloading the footage now.
NSA?
does Gibbs know?
know about what?
do they have something?
we had something.
the pickup man in perfect position before you blew it with the brew.
he knows my routine.
I felt I may have been compromised.
look, I did my part. I made the drop.
but I couldn't risk him seeing anything unusual.
what do you know about him?
nothing. I only see him when he's expecting a drop at the cafe. Always the same guy?
he hides his face. I try not to stare.
Yeah.
footage coming in.
okay. On our way. McGee's ready for us in MTAC, boss.
it's a restricted area.
you're not invited.
no. She is invited.
we need confirmation.
you got eyes on her, right?
what about this morning?
her rope got shorter.
lucky she's not hanging by it.
it's online now, Agent McGee.
working off what Abby gave us, an NSA satellite came up with this thermal footage early this morning over Hickory Grove, Virginia.
found unusual activity.
we convinced NSA to give us a look at photos from one of their keyhole imaging satellites.
this is 4: 14: 46 a. m.
no facial recognition on the man.
he never looked up.
we had better luck with the girl, though.
you recognize her?
looks like Lee was telling the truth.
maybe. Maybe?
it is a little girl being chased into a field.
maybe that's the plan.
what plan?
exactly.
all right. Coordinates are done programming.
GPS will take you to the spot where the girl was last seen.
there's a built-in compass in there so you don't get lost.
don't worry, McScout.
we got our Mossad hunting dog.
I'm going with you.
you're not going anywhere.
sit.
sir? You still talking?
why are you still here?
McGee, photos.
okay.
now, we can't see their...
sorry, boss.
can't see their faces, but based on height and build relative to Agent Lee and the little girl, we're looking at two very different guys.
I only get text-message instructions from one person.
it could be either one.
or neither one.
someone else could be pulling the strings.
take her to the conference room.
and do what? Watch her.
shouldn't I at least take a laptop?
at least get an ID? Let Abby do that.
your eyes are gonna be on her.
are we looking for three people?
don't know.
well, someone's taken the bait.
thinks he's gotten away with a sample of Domino that details how our military will respond to an attack on a communications link in Israel.
and he'll test it.
then wait and see if our response matches his info.
it's the only way to prove to him Lee has access to the complete Domino.
SECNAV doesn't share your enthusiasm.
lee is the onlway to get to the top of the pyramid.
and to get her daughter back.
SECNAV wants the pickup man picked up at the next opportunity.
Oh, that's a bad idea.
maybe.
but it's an order.
were you able to trace any of the text messages from him?
because of the level of SMS encryption he was using, along with the fact that he masked the signal by bouncing it halfway around the world, no.
whoever this guy is, he knows how to hide.
well, what about the messages I sent him?
sorry.
you have a sister, don't you, McGee?
you once withheld evidence in a murder investigation to protect her.
she was eventually cleared.
Yeah, but you didn't know that at the time.
you did what you had to do to save someone close to you because you were scared for her.
I know I'm going to have to pay for what I did.
I'm just saying, don't judge me without remembering who I was scared for.
how can you work with somebody for three years and not know they have a kid?
well, just because you work with somebody every day does not mean you know everything about them.
Really? Then I shouldn't know about that tattoo on the inside of your...
I meant, I can understand someone wanting to keep their personal and professional lives separate.
as should you.
did not end well when you fell in love while you were undercover, did it?
thanks for the memory.
trail starts here, continues off northwest.
north by northwest.
I'm talking about espionage,
sound familiar?
ready for a hike?
can't we drive?
if we end up hanging off Lincoln's nose, this is really gonna suck.
how'd it go?
that's an inappropriate question, McGee.
tag. You're it.
she wouldn't say a word to me in there.
she's usually the sympathetic one, right?
Abby has her own code.
stand here.
in the doorway?
Yeah, in the doorway.
any hits on the pickup man?
nothing yet.
like most things, it would go faster if there were two people working on it.
but since you're baby-sitting the P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R...
I can spell, Abby
Really?
um, okay, how about T-R-U-S-T?
look, McGee told me you had something to do with the satellites that helped find my daughter, and I just wanted to thank you.
how did you do it?
I analyzed your daughter's hair using the samples the blackmailer sent as proof of life.
as far as a person's diet goes, hair is like a time machine.
the longer the hair, the further back we can travel.
we can find out what she's been eating, drinking, the vitamins and nutrients.
is she healthy?
Yeah. She is.
hair grows about a half an inch a month.
I cut a strand into equal sections, and I analyzed each portion.
after she was kidnapped, your daughter's drinking habits changed.
hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios-- they vary by region.
but since most water supplies are tested by law, we could are done programming. pinpoint a general location.
the water she was drinking was from eastern Prince William County.
NSA kept an eye out for her.
it's like a spot in the dark, a hot spot.
two, as it turned out.
that was then.
Yup.
yesterday's news, Gibbs
just got to hop back in the DeLorean and get back to today's problems.
can I have McGee back, please?
Tony needs me to call him.
probably got lost.
Yeah, go.
thank you, Abby
I mean it.
okay, listen.
so what I didn't tell her is, until we get the full DNA test results back, we don't even know if that hair belongs to her daughter.
define lost, McGee.
I know exactly where we are.
we're between a tree and a bush.
directly underneath the earth's sun.
you're not showing up on the map.
let me restart the scan.
you might want to hurry.
Ziva's turning in circles.
either the trail's gone cold or she's about to mark her territory.
got it. Locating.
you're about six miles from where you started.
kid must have been scared out of her mind.
McGPS, are we close to anything?
all right, Tony, there's a structure on the other side of those woods.
200 yards northwest.
it's the only building around for miles. I got it.
Hey.
that way. 200 yards.
someone has been coming here regularly.
clear.
this is not right.
Yeah, we're gonna have to walk all the way back to the car. No.
this room is smaller than it should be.
did look bigger from the outside.
creepy.
she has been moved.
boss, we found something.
it's not good. Yeah, go.
the dead body. Our kidnapper.
full rigor.
I'd say he was killed shortly after we saw him grab the girl on satellite.
gunshot to the head.
execution-style.
should keep Ducky busy.
no, he won't.
he won't?
no.
boss, We're not coming.
Yeah, I know. this is a crime scene.
Docume everything. Get the hell out of there.
whoever's behind this could come back.
got it.
all right.
wrap it up, shutterbug.
we're bailing. We're leaving?
Yeah, we are leaving.
he is staying. Gibbs doesn't want any lights, cameras, action.
in case the guy who shot him comes back. Wait.
no refrigerator.
no food storage.
he must have brought in supplies.
the little girl realizes the routine.
she makes a run for it.He catches her.
and when the boss hears that she got away...
he can't trust him or the safe house.
kills the guy, moves the girl.
speaking of moving-- let's go.
here.
hairs from her hairbrush.
were you able to lift any prints? Yeah.
I got the prints off the dead guy.
the rest of the place is wiped clean.
what is this?
blood.
come on. Let's go.
ketchup.
she was counting the days with her lunch.
brave girl.
forensic evidence requires some evidence.
of late I have had too many bodies or none at all.
I'm not here about a dead body.
Yes, well, I hope you didn't come down to ask for more patience.
I am not a patient man.
which led me to realize thatur blackmailer is.
patient.
he's had the girl for eight months.
he's also methodical, calculating, confident in his ability to plan and execute.
to wit:
everything from tank tops to winter coats.
from summer through winter and back again.
and even when Domino was first compromised and Agent Langer was killed, he didn't alter his plans.
he merely extended his contingencies.
so?
lee lays low for two months.
our blackmailer works slowly, deliberately.
and yet, he killed this man and moved the girl within hours of her near-escape.
fast and slow.
the man is a contradiction.
he only has compassion when it suits him, cruelty when it's called for.
I believe the poker term is a "grinder."
okay.
go on.
well, the only way to get at him is to make him believe he has the winning hand.
he needs to feel safe so that he can show all his cards.
otherwise...
he folds.
goes back to waiting.
what about the girl?
unfortunately, he no longer will see her as his victim, but more as a witness to be diosed of.
did you find her?
I'm here to relieve you.
Thanks.
have fun.
sit down.
no, we didn't find her.
just where she's been held.
okay, what did you find exactly?
he moved her.
that's all we know.
and if he moved her, it means she's alive.
anything else?
what do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.
had enough of your lies.
this has never been about me.
they had Amanda.
I had no choice.
this is for your drop tomorrow.
same routine?
except we're gonna grab your pickup man.
and this time you're not gonna burn us or me with your coffee.
you can't arrest him.
he couldead us to my daughter.
we should be following him.
only person I'm gonna be following is you.
home. Now.
get your things.
thank you, sir.
Hi, what can I get you?
large drip and a paper.
no problem.
thank you.
same routine.
I'm having a splashback.
she must be nervous.
you're so naive, McGullible.
Tony, I spent the morning with her.
I think I gained a little insight.
Really?
Hey, let me get that for you.
what are you doing?
removing the wool she's pulled over your eyes.
got a little more.
Hey, come-come on!
I'm not saying I trust her.
okay?
I'm just saying I understand her.
a little.
boss.
lipstick. Off routine. She could be sending a signal. Hold.
Hi, good. How are you?
who would be low eugh to kidnap a little girl?
good question. Answer?
my gosh.
what's wrong?
um, nothing, sir.
it's just that you've never been down here.
before. Alone.
it's just weird. I mean, not like kissing-your-brother weird, but more like new weird.
like the first time you put your feet in Jell-O weird.
what do you got?
Oh, it's Abs. Gibbs calls me Abs "What do you got, Abs?
you're doing a Gibbs impression?
no, I'm doing Vance.
what do you got, Abs?
see, now that's better. It needs work.
like a little more swagger.
a little gravitas.
but you still weren't doing a Gibbs impression.
Sciuto.
extra weird.
okay, um, I matched six points on the dead man's fingerprints, but there's no data.
there's no banking records, no address, no credit history.
the information's been deleted.
his identity's erased.
a spy?
what?
it's test results found on the hairs in the little girl's bedroom-slash-prison.
okay, most of them match the little girl.
but there's one different strand here, based on the amount of hair spray around the cortex,
I'd say it comes from an unknown female.
blackmailer is a woman?
well, women can be criminals, too.
like Agent Lee
heard about your techie mojo.
not that we talk about you behind your back.
appreciate that.
it's the final DNA analysis of Lee's daughter's hair.
Oh... Leon...
too soon for the Leon?
sorry.
this is bad.
heads up.
the invisible man is back.
something's wrong, boss.
she's not leaving.
yeah?
we got a problem.
what?
DNA came back on the little girl's hair.
she is not Lee's daughter.
no relation.
lee's lying.
tell me where my daughter is. Put it down.
tell me where... Give me the paper.
drop it! Let go!
give me the paper!
no, you're screwing everything up!
now what if he's watching?
he'll kill her!
who, Amanda?
my wife!
not your damn daughter.
DNA tests, they don't lie.
she's my sister.
I raised her from the time she was six months old.
I'm the only mother she's ever known.
who is she? My parents adopted her.
and when then they died,
I promised that I would look after her, protect her.
by killing two innocent people?
to save her life.
every night I went to bed praying for this to be over.
and every morning,
I wake up knowing that it wouldn't be.
don't tell me you don't know what this is.
thought I'd care more if she was your daughter?
you wouldn't do what I did to save your daughter's life?
this time you tell the truth.
you should have come to me as soon as it happened!
before you murdered two men.
former NSA analyst.
Yes.
says you left NSA 12 months ago, accused of mishandling classified information.
Yes.
did you?
Yes.
I stole information.
when you lost your security clearan, you needed to find a new source.
what? No.
you hired this guy to grab the girl, you blackmailed Lee.
no, I've never seen him.
Where's the girl?
you're getting everything wrong!
I don't have anybody.
he has my wife, and if I don't deliver the rest of Domino...
he will kill her.
how do you know he has your wife?
he sends these in little envelopes.
how long?
almost a year.
I thought when I left the NSA, it would end.
but now he uses me as a drop man for Lee.
I will tell you whatever you want to know, go wherever you want me to go.
just tell me that you won't let my wife die.
what do you do with the information Lee passes you?
he texts me.
then he sends me different places to make a drop.
you ever seen him?
no, not in person.
but you've spoken to him?
a few times.
via computer.
he calls himself "The Weather Man."
you know, like he can predict the future, tomorrow's weather, you know?
he wants access to Domino to predict US military responses.
troop movements. Why?
money.
a pipeline is targeted in Israel.
the Pentagon moves the US Sixth Fleet to the Middle East.
world market flinches.
the price of everything changes right overnight.
oil, commodities, airlines, real estate, currency.
buys and sells stocks.
and he makes millions every day simply by knowing one thing:
what's going to happen tomorrow.
and I don't know if my wife's even going to be alive tomorrow.
boss, NSA report you requested.
back story checks out.
dates, reason he left the NSA, everything.
Yeah, Gibbs
my office.
on my way.
what do you got, Abs?
bam.
okay.
hair on the left is from the cabin in Virginia.
hair on the right is from Bankston's wife.
they match.
Bankston's wife was kept there, too?
Oh, um, it gets worse.
both hairs are missing a cellular protein sheath that's called...
you know, it makes no difference what it's called.
what really matters is that it's missing.
missing what?
well, hair and fingernail roots, they can show of decomposition, just like a body.
proteins break down and moisture is lost.
things that will only happen...
after death. Yeah.
Bankston's proof of life was actually proof of death.
his wife is already dead, Gibbs.
communications tower was destroyed this morning...
we've got the world jumping through hoops.
blackmailer knows that Domino's real, least the part we gave him.
so now what?
Bankston's gonna tell him the truth.
lee's got him.
he refuses to hand over the complete Domino until he hands over the girl.
it's risky.
Oh, you haven't heard the risky part yet, Leon.
going to need the real Domino.
that's not gonna happen.
he finds out it's a fake, that girl dies.
paperwork authorizing use of the real Domino.
needs your signature.
we're not ring our government's military playbook.
you are authorized to use a decoy.
that's it.
good luck.
he should have contacted me by now.
what if he got spooked?
and what about my wife?
Domino's the bait.
girl's the ploy. We're keeping it simple.
that's him.
tell him Lee has Domino.
she has a gun on him.
tell him he gets Domino when she gets her girl.
DiNozzo I'm just going to type what you say.
boss?
deal? Deal.
tell McGee Adam's Tavern is the dead drop.
unmarked units patrolling a five-block radius around the bar, additional agents on the inside.
evidence garage, five minutes.
you got him.
do I get one of those? No.
sorry.
me, too.
you've pled your case with everyone else.
why not me?
I'm done trying to explain. No one understands.
I do.
you would do what I did?
is that too tight?
it's fine.
thank you.
I'm never going to see my daughter again, am I?
probably not.
agent DiNozzo, we're ready for audio check.
audio check, one, two, three.
agents at each exit.
nobody gets made.
this guy is going to be watching.
agent Gibbs
go.
all right, people, let's move out.
you're going to need this.
the Pentagon let you have the real Domino?
they just arrived at the rendezvous, Director.
thank you.
Yes, Mr. Sec...
when did...?
it was downloaded from your office.
I assure you...
...another element of your plan you opted not to share?!
do I have to come down there Our plan is...
and personally oversee every decision that you make?!
I'll deal with it immediately, sir.
do that.
something wrong, Director? SECNAV.
somebody hacked into the Defense Intelligence computer, downloaded Domino, the real Domino.
they traced it back to your computer, McGee.
we're live, Boss.
look at him. Man's an artist.
fake stakeout drinking.
watch the Adam's apple move.
yet, no actual consumption.
we've got a lot to learn, Ziva.
okay, I'll be right back with your drinks.
yeah?
shut it down.
well, it's a little late for that.
I know you downloaded the real Domino.
damn it. Shut it down!
hold on a second, Leon?
I'm a little busy here.
call you back.
okay, we're up.
Yeah. Ready to order?
I said I'd call you back.
you did?
what, Abs?
I figured it out, Gibbs What?
our dead kidnapper's identity...
er, actually it's his non-identity.
very busy here, Abby
do you want to call me back?
no, I want you to talk faster. Faster-- okay.
NSA finally returned my call, which is good, because I was starting to think that their cooperation on the satellite thing was just a one-night stand.
and I wouldn't want NCIS to get the reputation of being easy...
um, our dead kidnapper's real name is Paul Winton, witness in an NSA/FBI joint investigation, put into FBI witness protection.
new identity, new location.
lived in a safe house, which is four blocks from where you are now.
address.
1815 Longview.
I ran the power records.
there's some massive juice use.
take a breath, Abs
you've earned it.
FBI safe house, 1815 Longview.
take the agent from the south exit.
you stay put.
boss, I'll go.
do it.
where are they going?
north, fast.
I want to talk to them. Already dialing.
they're not answering.
clear.
what the hell is this?
computers.
I'm glad you're here.
Hey, probie, what am I looking at?
a career in the fast food industry.
director Vance, how are you, sir?
it looks like sequentially linked network racks.
I'd say he's developed his own Internet hub.
that's how he covered his stock purchases.
could make it look like 500 different sellers when it was just one: him.
he's using an auto-response program.
doesn't have to be here to send text messages.
I have to call you back.
still breathing.
sleeping pills.
Uh-oh.
this is not good.
be careful, Tony
there's some kind of pressure plate.
a bomb?
electrical circuit.
hardwired into the grid.
powers the computers.
she's part of the circuit.
cut the power? No, no, no.
may cause a surge.
cooks the computers, destroys the evidence.
and her.
backup plan in case he didn't make it.
she wakes up, shifts her weight off the pressure plate.
same result.
you ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark?
how much do you think she weighs?
how much does a gallon of water weigh?
eight pounds.
cover the exits.
shut down the alarm.
lock it down.
search everyone.
no one leaves.
I'm gonna say 43 pounds.
more.
Uh-oh.
too late-- got to move her.
now.
everyone, please stay where you are.
Gibbs, you got to let me go, please.
no one leaves.
listen up, everyone.
it's not here.
this is a federal operation, and we need your cooperation. It never was.
there's no cause for alarm.
please, everyone, stay...
keep everyone inside.
go, go!
drive now!
Hey, pal, you can't...
boss, Tony's got Amanda. She's safe.
thank you.
found Bankston's wife.
buried in back of an old rental property.
he killed her 12 months ago.
he planted her hair in the cabin as insurance in case he got caught.
thought he was gonna walk out of that bar with Domino in his pocket.
this guy thought of everything.
not everything.
it's probably the best way for it to end.
treason, double murder.
she was headed for a life sentence.
or worse.
she was never gonna see her sister again.
SECNAV wants Domino back.
it never left the building, Leon.
I needed everyone to think it was real.
even me.
so, what are you going to tell her?
lee a hero or a villain?
both.
red apples.
that's good, Amanda.
breakfast is served, my lady.
a chocolate chip cookie. Thank you.
and some hot cocoa.
your aunt will be here soon to pick you up.
thank you for helping me with my drawing, Ziva
you are one brave little girl.
Where's Michy?
what happened to your hand?
Michy would want you to have that.
Hey, this is my big week, man.
I made more tips today than all last month.
Yeah, I got four more deliveries.
Yeah, I'll hook up with you around 7: 00.
Yeah, whatever.
I used to love this game as a kid.
Oh, me, too.
my mother preferred I played with dolls.
my favorite was G. I.Joe.
David, thank you. - My pleasure.
I enjoy shopping-- especially when it's not my money.
good.
that was security.
a Detective Kemp is on his way up.
anyone know where Gibbs is?
detective Justin Kemp?
that's the one. Metro Homicide. Why, do you know him?
um, sort of... you know...
what does that mean?
we have a mutual friend.
I used to date Kemp's wife.
how, uh-- how many dates we talking about here?
guys, what's it matter? I don't know.
like two, or three?
four.
Oh, that's... - Not a big deal.
four months. At least four months.
Oh, that is... - That is a big deal.
so what's Kemp doing here?
uh, investigating a home invasion robbery.
double homicide-- it's an older couple.
and how does that involve us?
they don't want to discuss it on the phone.
close your mouth, Ziva. He's married.
special Agent Gibbs.
sorry to ruin your Christmas.
it's December 23. We're not going anywhere.
found fingerprints at the crime scene.
ran them through AFIS-- I got a hit-- a Ned Quinn.
a former petty officer. Vietnam vet.
we had a witness-- a delivery boy.
worked with our sketch artist.
looks like an older version of... him.
can't be. Quinn died in a fire in 1991.
that's why I'm here.
according to V. A.records, Quinn's buried at Arlington.
McGee, pull a copy of the death certificate.
boss, this is not good.
it's a six pence.
what does it have to do with Christmas?
everything, Abby. It's a tradition.
that coin has been baked, well, steamed actually, into every Mallard Christmas pudding since the 1850s.
it brings good fortune and luck in the coming year to whoever finds it on their plate.
assuming they don't choke to death on it.
sadly, with no extended family here, I've let the tradition lapse.
next year, Ducky, you and me-- we're going to make Christmas pudding.
I'd like that.
I like everything about Christmas.
except for that Chipmunk song.
and shopping-- I hate shopping.
I never know what do get anyone-- specially Gibbs.
what do you get for the guy that has nothing and wants nothing?
some squeaky shoes.
Hi, Gibbs!
Bye, Gibbs.
something wrong, Jethro?
fingerprints found at a double homicide yesterday
belong to a petty officer who's supposed to have been dead 17 years.
his death certificate.
Oh, dear. Someone's in trouble.
I signed it?
graduated with honors from the University of Virginia.
he was accepted to its medical school, but didn't go.
enlisted in the Navy.
became a corpsman instead.
attached to the First Battalion, Ninth Marines.
the walking dead.
came home from Vietnam in 1972.
was treated at V. A.for post traumatic stress disorder.
Quinn became addicted to methamphetamine and was in and out of rehab.
his wife divorced him in 1980, and got full custody of their three-year-old daughter Melissa.
he started living on the streets and supposedly died with seven others in a fire at a halfway house on Canal Street.
there was nothing to hint that Quinn was alive until yesterday's murders.
a lot of years in between.
Where's the ex-wife and the daughter now?
wife lives in Alexandria and the daughter lives in Clearfield.
McGee, go with her.
massive charring.
pugilistic contractions of the extremities.
heat fractions.
Evulsion of the brain...
large and small intestines.
my voice had a deeper timbre in those days.
you make a mistake, Duck?
the city M. E.was unable to make a positive identification from the charred remains.
so I was called in in the hope that Quinn's military medical and dental records could confirm his identity.
unfortunately, due to the victim's heavy drug use, he suffered from meth mouth.
which deteriorated his teeth and made a dental match impossible.
DNA?
that was not an option back then.
all I had to go by was an examination of the skull and measurement of the bones.
from which I determined only that it was a male,
Caucasian, about 40 years old and six-foot, two.
well, fit Quinn's description then.
and since the remains were found in Quinn's room with all of Quinn's personal effects, we both naturally reached a circumstantial and logical conclusion.
what's more, nobody turned up claiming to be Quinn.
well, if it wasn't him, then maybe he killed someone and covered it up with the fire.
in Quinn's file, it says that he was treated for his PTSD at Bethesda.
by a psychiatrist-- one Dr.
Dr. Pryor. Yes. As I recall, he's still there.
I need to talk to him.
thanks for coming over, Mom.
I just have to get a few stocking stuffers.
go, go, go, go.
as long as I'm home by 6: 30 to help your father brine the turkey.
you know how he gets.
have you seen my car keys?
Jordie, did you take my keys?
I'll get it. Hang on, hang on.
you stay here, my sweet boy.
afternoon. NCIS.
I'm Special Agent Timothy McGee looking for Melissa Fox.
who is it, Mom?
are you Connie Wheeler?
Yes.
we need to ask you some questions about your former husband, Ned Quinn.
fingerprints found at a crime scene match his.
well, that can't be.
he's been dead for 20 years.
if he were alive, do you have any idea where he might be?
I couldn't even offer a clue.
he's been out of our lives since the divorce.
Melissa, have you had any contact with your father?
her father is my husband Ed.
he raised Melissa since she was four years old.
Ned Quinn has never been a part of her life.
I only have vague memories of him.
if he is still alive, I don't want him to know where we are.
he's already destroyed our lives once.
mommy, Mommy, I'm done. - I'm sorry, excuse me.
when he came back from Vietnam...
he was a drug addict.
I tried, but he didn't want my help.
I moved on.
we both moved on.
I don't remember Quinn.
apparently we treated him over a three year period-- 1979 to '82.
what were you treating him for?
he suffered from survivor guilt.
blamed himself for a buddy's death.
Oh, my God.
I heard there was a Santa in the building.
Abby... - He's great.
rosy cheeks, wire-rim glasses.
your beard looks so real...
that's because it is.
Abigail, Dr. Pryor is a psychiatrist. He's here to help me find
to find out who's naughty and who's nice. Hello?
you think I could get a picture?
why did Quinn blame himself for his friend's death?
well, he and another corpsman switched patrols a week before their tour was to end.
the other guy got killed in an ambush.
you last saw him in '82. The fire was in '91.
have you any idea of anything that happened in the intervening years?
no. Like a lot of those guys, he stopped coming.
they give up.
did he have any violent tendencies?
I don't remember.
I have to be at the Children's Hospital party in 30 minutes.
anything that I once knew about the man is in here.
thank you, Dr. Pryor.
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
thank you, Santa.
I just suffered for hours through the good doctor's rambling notes.
there is nothing to suggest aggressive or impulsive behavior.
per his service record, Quinn left Vietnam on December 30, 1972.
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall listed 58, 000 plus names of the dead and missing in chronological order.
according to its Web site, 17 military personnel died that week.
of that number, two were in Long Khanh Province where Quinn was stationed.
only one was a Navy corpsman.
Yeah.
after the Vietnam Memorial was dedicated,
Quinn went regularly to the wall to pay tribute to his fallen friend.
if Quinn is still alive, there's a chance he might honor Roger Grant's memory by visiting the Memorial on the anniversary of his death-- December 24.
tomorrow.
he does not dress like a cop. - Who?
your Detective Kemp.
you are a little fascinated by him.
he come from money? - Married it.
we're missing the office Christmas party.
that could have been you.
what is her name? - Guy in the blue hoodie.
could be Quinn.
go check him out.
too young, too fat, too female.
answer my question. She pretty?
gorgeous.
she was perfect, okay?
witty, smart.
that was 12 years ago.
she's had kids; God knows what she looks like now.
so... what happened?
you ever, um, regret not having a wife and kids?
especially during this time of year.
Hanukkah is all about family.
is it not the same with Christmas?
I'm gonna check out the guy in the blue hoodie.
it is a woman!
Hey, Gibbs. The party's starting to wind down up there.
Hollander had to be sent home in a cab-- fourth year in a row.
I brought you and McGee some eggnog.
right. Two for McGee.
speaking of McGee...
and Ziva... and Tony...
ABS, it's Christmas Eve. Go home.
I can't. I have to go shopping.
then do it.
I don't know what to get anybody.
what do you think Tony needs?
an attitude adjustment.
Gibbs, you're not helping.
right this way, please.
ABS. Merry Christmas.
boss, this is Melissa Fox, Ned Quinn's daughter.
Melissa, this is Special Agent Gibbs.
he's in charge of the case.
thank you for seeing me, Agent Gibbs.
I just wanted to make it clear that my mother doesn't speak for me.
she wants no part of my father.
I do.
I have all these childhood memories of him.
maybe they're just fantasies, but...
don't get me wrong. My stepfather is wonderful.
but I hoped one day to connect with my biological father.
did you try?
my mother protected me from him.
she didn't even tell me when he died.
how'd you find out?
I did a search when I was 21.
excuse me. Yeah.
he's here. Should we take him down?
no. I'm on my way. Thanks.
sorry about that.
I'm still reeling from the possibility that he might be alive.
unlike my mother, I'd very much like to see him.
it's like a piece of me is missing.
no matter how many times I come here, it still gets to me.
you look at a name, you have to look at a reflection of yourself.
you are among the fallen.
Yeah.
difference is you can leave...
the names don't.
no.
death is permanent.
except in your case, Ned Quinn.
it's been a long time since anybody's called me that.
he hasn't said a word since we brought him in here.
not surprising for a man who spent 17 years hiding.
skin and eyes clear, good hygiene, no tremors.
clean and sober.
all he had on him was eight dollars and a key to a long-term downtown hotel room. No ID.
metro P. D.is on the way to pick you up.
you'll be their problem.
that's your buddy. Petty Officer Grant.
corpsman.
just like you.
corpsman saved my life once.
so you're a former Marine, huh?
so what happened at the Taylor house then?
your fingerprints were all over the place.
I didn't kill them.
you were there.
Why?
I was out on the street with my sign, looking for work, and the Taylors picked me up.
they needed help decorating their house for the holidays.
you never met them before?
no, they said it was their traditional way of extending a helping hand to those less fortunate.
well, if you didn't kill them, who did?
I don't know.
I was in the garage. I was digging decorations out of boxes.
when I got back, I found them.
there was blood everywhere.
the husband was already dead.
the wife was on the couch.
I put her on the floor, I tried to administer CPR.
but it was too late.
I'll be back. - Where you going?
I want to catch the city M. E.before he leaves his office.
wish me luck.
why'd you run?
I'd been dead for 17 years.
who's gonna believe me?
how long has Quinn lived here?
who?
the guy in this room. Rembrandt?
I've been here 12 years.
he's been here longer than that.
rembrandt ever give you any trouble?
never. Pays his rent every Saturday, in cash. Keeps to himself.
all right.
we'll say good-bye to you downstairs. Bye. Downstairs. Thanks.
wow, guy's got some personality.
check this out.
that's pretty good.
not what I expected to find.
not what I expected to be doing on Christmas Eve.
what did you expect to be doing? - Not this.
you had no plans.
I had plans. I had big plans. Big, big plans.
I was ten blocks away when the fire broke out.
so who died in your room?
another tweaker.
I didn't know him.
he told me where I could cop.
I told him he could crash there till I got back.
when I did, there were fire engines and cop cars all over the place.
why didn't you just identify yourself?
I realized they thought I was in the room.
and in a rare, lucid moment, it occurred to me that my ex-wife and my daughter might be better off if I was dead and they could receive my military benefits.
that was the only decent thing I ever did for them.
so you disappeared. You hid.
it's not hard if no one's looking for you.
you work for cash, you pay cash for what you buy, you don't need a name.
Ziva. - Did you leave D. C?
thought about it, but never did.
Abby, I thought you went home.
did Gibbs tell him that his daughter was here and she wants to meet him?
no. - He has to. It means everything to her.
Abby, this is not a lost puppy for you to rescue.
you cannot make this better.
this is a murder investigation.
I think Gibbs should tell him.
and I think... you should stay out of this.
missed the party, don't have to miss the food.
Hey, Ducky, I found these in the conference room. They're pretty de-lish.
you might want to try some of this, Ducky. It's pretty good stuff.
no, thank you.
What'd you find out at his place? - Nothing to tie him to the murders.
appears to have led a, uh, non-criminal and invisible life.
actually, uh, he's an artist-- sketches. Pretty good stuff.
you catch the M. E? - Yes.
Mr. Taylor died of blunt force trauma to the head from what appears to be several strikes of a hammer.
Mrs. Taylor, heart attack.
uh, ligature marks on her wrists suggest that she was restrained by handcuffs.
but what is much more interesting: our suspect is telling the truth.
he was trying to save Mrs. Taylor.
how do you know that?
Quinn's bloody fingerprints knew what they were doing.
and compression bruises on her chest suggest he was trying to perform CPR, Jethro.
and he knew to put her on a hard surface, the floor.
Yeah.
kill the husband, try and save the wife? Doesn't make sense.
Kemp's here to pick up Quinn.
I will go get him.
keep him here till I get back.
how can he eat those things?
yeah?
nice work finding Quinn so fast.
well, I got a lot of help from Ducky.
same guy that declared him dead 17 years ago.
well, Jackie is furious.
I was supposed to be home hours ago.
all right, time to start the Christmas holiday.
you're not here to wish me a merry Christmas, are you?
I can't get a handle on Quinn.
he faked his own death and we can place him at the crime scene.
but you don't think he did it?
I think we may be handing over an innocent man to Metro.
and you're concerned they think they've got a slam-dunk case.
they're not gonna look any further.
this was taken last Christmas.
is that your wife?
nobody looks that good in a bikini after two kids.
that hotel is awesome. Is that a Ritz-Carlton?
no, no, that's, uh, that's my father-in-law's villa.
so, uh, where's Gibbs? I need to get Quinn downtown.
we're gonna hold him here, Detective Kemp.
leon Vance. - Director.
the Navy's got unfinished business with former Petty Officer Quinn.
what exactly?
faked his death.
his family collected death benefits.
with all due respect, Director, I've got him for a double homicide.
not even close.
you know you won't be able to get Quinn in front of a judge for days.
relax. Enjoy a little family time.
what am I missing?
why is NCIS interfering with a Metro case?
fine. Tomorrow's Christmas.
I've got two bikes and a dollhouse to put together.
we'll be back with a court order day after tomorrow.
let's go.
you asked for it. You better work fast. You only have a day.
merry Christmas.
Hey, guys. What's up?
I hope no one has plans.
keep Quinn in interrogation.
we'll watch him in shifts.
what do I do?
you and Duck go home. It's late. Get some sleep.
Oh, I haven't slept on Christmas Eve since I was, like, four.
since I started camping out in front of the fireplace trying to catch Santa.
I should have pulled a fingerprint off his milk glass.
I may need you both tomorrow.
Yes, I have to go visit Mother in her new home.
may I walk you to your car?
how is she?
driving the nurses crazy.
Kemp Is focused on Quinn's fingerprints.
he's not looking at anything else.
do our own investigation.
visit the crime scene?
Kemp will go ballistic.
boss, I Googled the dead couple for background information.
found something interesting here.
six months ago, the husband, Avery Taylor, filed a multimillion-dollar patent-infringement lawsuit against Paradigm Industries.
get out of town. - What?
paradigm Industries is owned by Gary Vanderlicht.
metro Detective Justin Kemp's filthy-rich father-in-law?
all right, that's it. I know when I'm beaten.
how are we going to get the game back in the box and make it look like it was never opened?
I am an expert at repacking and rewrapping.
Christmas mornings, I knew what was in each present under the tree.
you peeked?
is anybody in there?
agent Gibbs?
when are the police coming to pick me up?
not for a while.
because of the holiday, shifts are not fully staffed.
I think you know more than you're telling me.
are you hungry?
do you need anything?
a pencil and paper.
I can't sleep.
sketching relaxes me.
Oh, yeah, I know, sharp object.
I promise I won't stab myself.
not a happy Christmas morning for the Taylors.
Hey, wanna make this interesting?
I bet you five bucks I can crack the alarm code before you can pick the lock, boss.
I will take that bet. - Okay.
Ta-da!
how did you do that?
the one, the four, theeven and the nine are worn.
the code had to be a combination of those four numbers.
people like to choose numbers that are easy to rember:
address, anniversary, birthday, birth year.
being a Boy Scout, I came prepared.
the Taylors were born in 1947.
five bucks.
sore loser.
what do we think the police missed?
if we believe Quinn, he found the wife's body on the couch and moved it on the floor.
they wouldn't have known that.
got it.
Kemp's investigation focused on the fingerprint evidence and the couple's bodies, which were found here and here.
let's check out the rest of the house.
that's good.
so were the sketches in your room.
did you take art classes in college?
no. Rehab.
I guess being pre-med, you don't really have a lot of time to take electives.
you wanted to be a doctor.
Nam changed things.
looks like a chair was moved.
found fibers, hair and... Watch! a button.
found the chair.
looks like somebody wanted to get something on the upper shelf.
it's a safe. It's empty.
I'm guessing Metro police got it wrong.
the robbery netted more than just the jewelry the wife was wearing and the husband's cash.
dust it. - Security patrol.
uh, who are you guys?
we received an alarm.
I thought you turned it off?
it's our top-of-the-line HS 3000 system.
it's a double-redundant.
if you don't punch in the code twice, it sends a silent alarm.
double redundancy, how could I know that?
thought the police, uh, had a suspect.
what are you guys doing here?
they asked for our help.
they didn't tell us.
we got work to do.
NCIS... heard about you guys.
I've been in the private security business for three years.
doesn't pay very well.
does NCIS take applications?
merry Christmas, Tiny Tim!
what are you doing here?
well, today's Christmas.
I just came from church.
I didn't have anything planned and I wanted to be with my team.
where is everybody?
in the field.
how's he doin'? - Ah, you know.
has he, um, mentioned his daughter?
no.
you think he'd like to see her?
I don't know. Why are you asking?
because Melissa's in the lobby and she wants to see him.
how did she know that we found him?
well, she might have figured it out when I called her and told her.
Abby, what, what are you doing? You called her?
Gibbs, Gibbs is gonna kill you!
no, he won't.
think about it, Tim.
this is the greatest fairy tale ever.
there's a little girl and her dad leaves.
and then he lives on the streets.
and then he dies.
and she's never gonna see him again.
she's never gonna get to say all the things that a daughter wants to say to her father.
and then she grows up and she has a child of her own, and then wonder of all wonders, he comes back from the dead and they get reunited on Christmas!
Abby, are you finished?
please, please, please, pretty please?
do it for me, okay?
just, just tell him Melissa's here.
you'll understand when you see the sparkle in his eye.
all right.
you have a visitor.
who?
Melissa, your daughter.
she's here? - Yep.
wants to talk to you.
I don't want to see her.
and you tell her that she was better off when I was dead.
okay.
here, let me, let me help you with that.
got it. Thanks.
so how'd you hook up with NCIS?
see if DiNozzo is finished in the garage.
she's cute.
so, maybe I could, uh, you know...
well, good luck with the case.
think we just got a Christmas present.
what the hell is going on?
metro Police Chief just gave me an earful.
claims you broke into their crime scene and corrupted the chain of evidence.
tell me you didn't do that.
how'd he find out?
metro got a call from the home-security firm.
come on, Daddy!
this how you spend your Christmas, Gibbs?
most people are home opening presents.
Yeah, most people.
cops are on their way to pick up Quinn.
leon, we're late. - Get him ready.
Hey, Gibbs. - Looks like we got the murder weapon.
blood on the hammer matches the victim's type.
you're not gonna like this, Gibbs.
the prints on the handle belong to the victim.
and to Ned Quinn.
it looks like mine.
your prints are on it.
look, the Taylors hired me to help them decorate their house.
I brought my toolbox.
when I left, I was in a hurry.
I didn't stop to see if I brought my hammer.
you said you were in their garage.
that's where the hammer was found.
I don't know how it got-- What do you want me to tell you?
you know, you're getting harder and harder to believe.
right, Sherlock.
vietnam Vet, stoner, a man with no name.
it's got to be me.
metro police are here.
I will have McGee bring you down.
you make it a habit, keeping people waiting?
what's the rush, Kemp? - It's Christmas.
maybe if you had a family, DiNozzo, you'd understand.
how did your daughter like the dollhouse?
Oh, she loved it.
Yeah, she took it with her when she left this morning.
where did she go?
a family tradition.
Yeah, we spend the week between Christmas and New Year's at the villa.
Yeah, right now they're on my father-in-law's G5.
thanks to you guys, the Chief's on my ass, wouldn't let me leave.
and if I'm lucky I'm getting out of here late tonight.
Where's Quinn? - On the way.
you gonna explain to me why you broke into the crime scene?
are you gonna explain to me why you didn't remove yourself from this case?
why would I do that?
Avery Taylor was suing your father-in-law.
you have no business investigating Taylor's murder.
what are you talking about?
paradigm Industries? A little case of patent-infringement?
all right, let me tell you a couple things.
okay, one: My father-in-law is the CEO of a holding company that owns over a dozen multimillion-dollar companies.
and two: He never discusses business with me.
I don't like what you're insinuating.
he's all yours. - Are you going to tell him we found the murder weapon?
he never asked.
Ah, thanks, I was running on empty.
Oh, yuck!
they put nutmeg in it for the holidays.
what do you got, Abs?
um, the hair on the couch belonged to Mrs. Taylor.
I'm still working on the fibers.
as for the button Ziva found, it was made exclusively for a clothing manufacturer in Scranton, Pennsylvania, who specializes exclusively in military and police uniforms.
dusting the safe produced an unknown print.
mistletoe.
no.
I didn't say it was a fingerprint.
well, what was it, Abby?
it was a fabric print.
most likely made from a glove. Should've worn latex.
leather and fabric gloves have a distinct weave, grain, wear and stitching pattern.
in this case, an old leather one with U-shaped scuff and a frayed seam.
you bring me a glove, and I'll tell you if it left a print on the safe.
you might've redeemed yourself, Abs.
What'd I do?
called Quinn's daughter. McGee!
got it, Boss.
Taylors' home-security system interfaces with the company's central dispatch via the internet.
your hunch was right.
the alarm was deactivated at 2: 17 AM this morning.
between the time Kemp sealed the house and you...
broke in.
well, I was gonna say gained unauthorized access.
alarm was reactivated four and a half minutes later.
DiNozzo, call your ex-girlfriend's husband.
have him meet us at the Taylors'.
Ziva, get the car.
how about Ziva makes the call and I get the car?
or not. I'll do it.
you guys really don't have lives, do you?
what are we doing here?
arresting the murder.
he's in a holding cell, downtown, Gibbs.
what is it with you people?
first you declare him dead and now you're trying to help him beat a double-homicide rap?
this was a home invasion.
but not for the wife's jewelry or pocket change.
it was all about the safe.
DiNozzo, break in. - With great pleasure, sir.
what safe?
I guess you missed this.
okay. So, what? It was Quinn.
his bloody prints were all over the place.
Yeah, because he was trying to save the couple's lives.
he was in the garage at the time of the murders.
last night, while Quinn was in our custody, somebody deactivated the alarm and planted the murder weapon.
a hammer. in the garage.
trying to seal the case against Quinn.
wait, you had a murder weapon and didn't tell me?
who knew about the alarm code other than the Taylors?
we have company.
Hi, Harvey.
Hey, what's going on?
lose a button?
looks just like the ones on your shirt.
found it on the couch.
where you handcuffed Mrs. Taylor.
other thing you left behind was a print on the safe.
you didn't know that gloves could leave prints, did you, Harvey?
are those yours right there?
look at that. Frayed seams.
that's a TASER, Harvey. - You only have one shot.
non-fatal.
there's five of us.
don't move!
just breathe through it. - God!
he confessed?
he knew they kept cash and jewelry in their safe.
didn't know that Quinn was in the garage.
when the wife panicked, She went into cardiac arrest.
hmm, the husband freaked, attacked the security guard with the only weapon he could find.
Quinn's hammer.
the guard overpowered and killed him.
Oh, Abby,
hmm, a cotton-ball bouquet.
see what I got.
cufflinks, made out of-- - Spent nine-millimeter slugs.
friction makes us static
would you stop that? I'm still humming from the TASER.
ladies and gentlemen, tonight you're all going to share in a DiNozzo family tradition.
caramel popcorn, hot mulled cider and the greatest, greatest Christmas movie of all time.
it's a Wonderful Life!
Yay! - Wonderful.
we can't start until Gibbs gets here.
Oh, he said not to wait for him.
where is he?
where are we?
Melissa's house.
no, Gibbs. You don't know me.
I ruin lives; I am poison.
give yourself some credit.
you're not the same person that dropped out of her life when she was three years old.
you've changed.
I don't need this. I don't.
she does.
there's too much time that's passed.
if I had one wish for Christmas, it would be to hug my daughter.
that can never be. You have that chance.
thank you.
Hello?
merry Christmas, Dad.
merry Christmas, Son.
Los Angeles, OSP.
they have the lead.
NCIS's Office of Special Projects.
they specialize in undercover and surveillance.
Macy still agent in charge there?
how are you, Callen?
did you see Mace?
Yeah, I saw her.
let me do my job.
like you did the first time we met?
Kickoff's in 30.
guy on the right, Michael Rivkin.
when he called the other day, I thought he must have been here.
no. Sadly, Michael is not here.
go tight on Liam.
what do you see?
he's carrying.
Liam Coyle, former IRA arms dealer.
motel.
four blank passports.
four suitcases filled with weapons.
that means whoever Liam's supplying is probably coming back to collect this.
looks like you're going undercover as Liam.
been expecting you.
it's a pleasure to finally meet you, Liam.
you have everything I want?
times four.
passports?
everything.
and it's all here?
it's all here.
first the face, next the name.
you know, I met a man in Damascus who said you were dead.
well, let me know when he passes.
I'll come to his funeral.
too late.
who are you? - Abort, abort.
target center of the room, weapon drawn.
federal agents! Don't move!
put down your weapon. - Put it down!
come on, Mace, he wasn't gonna shoot me!
will you tell her you weren't gonna shoot me?
I wasn't going to shoot him.
no tension in the upper body, and the voice is all wrong.
probably wasn't gonna shoot him.
be embarrassing if he had.
there's no room for probably, Nate.
do we have a name?
well, we just started.
it's gonna take at least a...
we got a match here. - Put it on the screen.
millions of possibilities, we get a hit in six seconds?
his name's Michael Rivkin.
Ah, he's way too confident.
think we're about to go pear-shaped, Mace.
who are you?
Mossad.
you can prove that?
no, but I know someone who can.
her name is Ziva David.
setting up a link. Los Angeles. Yes...
morning. - Tony.
something up? - Gibbs.
he's back? - MTAC.
Oh, nice, three one-word answers. Wanna go for a fourth? - No!
all right, now I'm gonna ask you a question that's gonna demand more than a one-word answer.
are you ready for that, Ziva David?
no.
all right, here comes the question. Ready?
no beverages allowed in MTAC.
soy vanilla latte, no sugar added. Didn't blow back. It's all yours.
God, question was right on the tip of my tongue, and now I can't remember it.
how could I forget the question?
questions are of course, uh, well, they're relative.
and I don't mean that in a sense of, like... - OSP's on-line.
McGee, put it up.
you recognize him?
Yes, I know him. His name is Michael Rivkin.
he says he's Mossad.
Yes, he's with the Mossad.
anything else you can tell us about him, Officer David?
no. I have not worked with him in some time.
we will talk more about this later.
of course.
you did not think I would identify him.
that was not a question.
anything you want to tell me?
no.
one-word answer. I win.
his cover is an Israeli banker.
flew in three days ago.
that's all we got; still looking.
what the hell is he doing here?
same thing we are.
tracking down a terrorist cell.
we're hunting the same cell.
your search started here, mine in Yemen.
okay, well, if I'm Liam Coyle, arms supplier, who does that make you?
Nick Quaderi, jihadist.
the real Liam's in the morgue. Where exact ishe real Nick Quaderi?
in bed.
221 Pacific Avenue, Apartment 27, Venice Beach.
no need to be quiet.
you won't wake him.
Yeah, you should've called us.
would've spared you a long ride from Yemen.
needed to be sure.
what did Quaderi tell you?
weapons pickup here, a named Liam.
target? - No.
rest of the cell?
fell asleep before he told me.
I can tell you that one of the others is named Haziq.
address.
that's all I have.
give him your cell, Sam.
be polite.
good morning.
as I'm sure you're aware, foreign intelligence agencies are not authorized to act within U. S.territorial borders.
I would hate for your actions to cause an incident by staying here any longer, Mr. Rivkin.
we each have a job to do.
yours is done. Go home.
uh, GPS tracker on his rental.
Sam, let him go.
four passports, four suitcases.
Yeah, Rivkin's already put one of them to sleep.
one down, three to go.
Eric, give me outside surveillance.
on screen.
agent Renko, you got him?
I got him, Mace.
Callen, Sam, Venice Beach, Quaderi's apartment.
Kensi, shut it down.
you thinking what I'm thinking? - Mumbai.
they attack soft targets.
hotels, a railway station.
we need a breathing suspect, not a dead one.
that's not Rivkin's plan.
we have to stay ahead of him until I get approval to lock him up or send him home.
officer David was sent back to Israel last year.
are you asking me do I trust her?
because my answer is: yes, with my life.
you don't think I'm very good at this, do you?
the director must, or you wouldn't be doing this job.
you shouldn't judge me on past performance.
it was 18 years ago.
What'd you find?
okay, so Mossad gets a lead in Yemen about a terrorist cell operating out of Los Angeles, right?
sends Rivkin to eliminate them.
Rivkin finds one of the terrorists, Nick Quaderi, kills him, but not before Quaderi mentions that he's meeting with an arms dealer named Liam.
and the only problem is, we're hunting the same terrorist cell.
terrorist cells are like families.
I mean, close-knit, always checking on each other.
now, if they lost contact with one of their own, it may trigger them to step up the attack.
next move is to find the cell member Rivkin mentioned.
Haziq. - Before he panics.
you think that Rivkin knows the identities of the rest of the cell?
it was right there in his smug smile, McGee.
he knows.
you okay, Mace?
I already told you not to go there, Nate.
well... you know me too well.
no one knows you, Nate.
you, on the other hand, being the psychologist you are, know everyone.
not Gibbs.
so you go back 18 years, huh?
I wasn't listening.
odd word, occasional phrase.
Gibbs was a gunnery sergeant.
I was a green, young lieutenant in the Military Police determined to prove myself.
you worked a case together?
y-you could say that.
it was a JAG-MAN investigation, a murder I was the lead investigator.
and Gibbs?
Gibbs was the suspect.
guy's a ghost. - Definitely is now.
we got his name and his address.
paid his rent in cash, utilities paid by his landlord, so no photo I. D.there, and no credit cards.
you have any idea how many times your average law-abiding citizen is recorded every week, McGee?
Yeah, probably north of 3, 000 times.
Ooh, way north. Like northern Alaska north.
every phone call, credit card transaction, Internet search, all swallowed up and stored on hard drives so people can troll them for personal information.
you mean, like we're doing right now.
Yeah, that's okay 'cause we work for the government.
we've got a national security letter to prove it.
this guy really did not want to be found.
well, Rivkin found him, McGee.
are you still tracking Rivkin?
Yeah, boss, we got him right there.
marina Del Rey. We're pulling up the pictometry now.
his car's parked at a hotel.
special Agent Renko?
he's out of his car and he's got a visual.
let him know I'm coming. - I'm on it.
you got something else?
no, that about covers it.
I lived in a place like this when I was a kid.
I probably lived down the hall.
this is it. Apartment 27.
Nick Quaderi, if you're inclined to believe Rivkin.
what is it between Mace and Gibbs?
they've never told me.
think they'll work it out?
not without some help.
one-inch tear. Looks like a stab wound.
clean and quick under the sternum up into the heart.
there's a secret department in the Mossad called the Kidon.
I had dealings with them when I was a Seal.
highly trained, fearless.
they were formed after the war to track down Nazis.
now they come after all enemies who would harm Israel.
I think Rivkin could be one of them.
hebrew for "bayonet.
morning, Mike.
help yourself.
where is he?
hotel gazebo, having coffee at the middle table.
went inside, came back out a couple minutes later. He's been there ever since.
he's waiting for somebody.
that's my guess.
whose boat is this?
I have no idea.
sand with the grain of the wood, Renko.
you done this before? - Yeah.
download complete. Rest in peace.
if that's what you want, sure.
next week, then.
Yeah, ciao.
who are you? - My name's Liam.
I'm a friend of Nick's. Sort of. And you are?
Shakira, his girlfriend... sort of.
Nick, I'm here! - But Nick's not.
then how did you get in?
he's supposed to meet me here, but he's late.
I was just gonna leave him a note.
Liam. - You got a plan?
Hey, Nick. - Clever.
I'm in your apartment waiting. Where the hell are you?
I'm in the next room.
calm down, take it easy, all right?
Hey, Shakira just walked in. Do you want to talk with her?
not particularly.
okay, no problem. - What do you have in mind?
Haziq's place?
sure, if that's what you want, we'll come right over.
he didn't want to talk on the phone.
he wants us to come to his friend's place.
Haziq? Do you know him? - You don't?
no. - Lucky you.
I'll call a cab.
my car's out front. - Great.
is the bathroom through here?
Rivkin gives us Haziq's name. She leads us to him. Stay close.
how you gonna play this?
I gotta believe Haziq still wants what Liam's got.
and if he doesn't?
you come rescue me.
you think she's involved?
they're sleeping together.
she's involved whether she knows it or not. - Yeah.
okay. What kind of car do you drive? - A convertible.
convertible? Red?
yellow. - I like yellow.
Mace? - What's happening, Sam?
Callen's back in the gam.
mace, we're stopping at an auto shop downtown-- 13th and Bakers Lane.
this place creeps me out, or maybe it's just Haziq.
Nick bring you here often?
couple times.
Haziq was trying to recruit him.
for what?
Hey, who's this?
Nick's friend. He called. Told us to meet him out here.
he didn't call me.
Nick's friend, huh? - Liam.
what can Nick's friend do for us?
well, I can give you what you've been waiting for.
come in, Nick's friend.
he's just met a guy, probably Haziq.
I'm downloading photos. I need some more eyes down here.
Kensi's on her way. Eric, live feeds? - No coverage, Mace.
Kensi, you're gonna have to get a camera in there.
I'll come up with something.
you're tripping, homes.
dang, man!
you want to bang on something, baby, you found your man.
Hey, relax. We're cool, eh?
not today, boys.
have a nice day.
Shakira, bring our guest a cold drink.
are you armed? - Back.
cell phone?
she doesn't know? - Why should she? Shs just a woman.
Nick is not the one who's supposed to contact you.
he called me, told me to come to his apartment.
then he changed the meeting here. - Why?
you're just gonna have to ask him when he gets here.
thank you. - Come and sit down.
the cell phone you are trying to reach is switched off or out of range.
please try again later.
where is Rafi?
how would I know?
he's your brother. You should be more respectful.
sweet.
Eric, activate Callen's cell phone.
microphone and camera coming online.
phone cam's up at Haziq's auto shop.
cell phone.
trace it, and feed it through to Sam to translate.
I need you here, Nasim.
is Rafi with you?
what about Nick? Have you heard from him?
I'm not sure if there's something wrong.
just get down here as soon as you can.
he's anxious.
feeling pressured.
wants his men around him. - He's not the only one.
director Vance on the line for you, Mace.
Where's Kensi? Director?
um, a guy just backed into me.
do you think you could possibly help me out... - We're closed.
Oh, come on, man, I just need to know if it's safe to drive.
um, you have a bathroom?
no, we don't.
uh, this is not so bad. You are safe.
it's, uh, cosmetic damage. Just bring it ba next week.
okay.
um, is Wednesday okay?
wednesday's fine.
thank you.
camera inside thdoor.
pulling up the new camera feed.
I understand, Director. I will. Good-bye.
traced the call Haziq just received.
caller's name is Nasim Boutros.
home address is a long-stay hotel, room 1122, at 73 Promenade Way, Marina Del Rey.
mace, that's the hotel Rivkin is staking out.
where was Nasim when he made that call?
less than a half mile from the hotel.
on his way home.
and Rivkin is waiting for him. Get Gibbs.
Yeah. - Vance has cleared it with the Attorney General.
we have a FISA warrant. Get Rivkin.
go around back!
Gibbs! - Yeah. Clear.
any idea what they're arguing about?
cell phone coverage.
Haziq can't reach anyone on his phone.
and Jumah's telling him it's a piece of American junk.
how did Nick sound on the phone?
he sounded okay.
they're planng something, aren't they?
if they use what they're buying from me-- yeah.
do you have any idea what it is?
no. - Change of plans.
you are going to make the weapons delivery today.
here? - Yes, here.
call whoever you need to call.
you have an hour, and then our business is done.
he's calling Sam.
Hey, it's Liam.
look, bring the suitcases to the auto shop at 13th and Baker's Lane in one hour.
okay, let's make it happen. One hour.
McGee, anything on Rkin?
no. GPS marker says he didn't leave the hotel parking lot.
he must have found the GPS tracker and dumped it.
got a BOLO out on his rental. Nothing yet.
keep on it. - Yes, ma'am.
it's him. It's Tim. He knows I'm sitting at his desk.
tell him you're in your lab. He won't know.
Oh, he'll know. He knows everything.
Gibbs knows everything.
McGenius is smart, but he doesn't know everything.
Hi, Tim.
I'm not upstairs in the squad room. I'm in my lab. I'm working.
are you sitting at my desk?
no.
Abby, listen, last night you did a facial recognition search on Michael Rivkin. Why?
what makes you think that?
you logged the search.
I did? I did.
did Tony ask you to do it?
I'm not at liberty to say.
you are at my desk, aren't you? - Yeah.
and Tony is watching you? - Yeah.
can I talk to Tony, please? - Okay.
it's for you. It's McGoo... McGee-- Tim. Sorry, McGee.
ignore her, Probie. She's suffering Gibbs withdrawal.
transferring it onto you because of a deep-seated fear that Gibbs may withhold love and give her a first-time head slap if he came back and saw his desk festooned in balloons and decorated like some tacky tiki bar with messages of affection written possibly in blood.
she ain't missing you at all.
in fact, I can'think of a single person that's missing you.
well, I'll tell you who we're all missing-- and that's Michael Rivkin.
define "missing."
two members of the terrorist cell are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit, and now he's dropped out of sight.
do you think that there is any chance Ziva...
don't ask that question.
well, Tony, someone has to ask it.
Oh, I know, McGee. I know. Leave it to me.
here you go.
here's what we know. Nick Quaderi, dead.
almost certainly killed by Michael Rivkin.
nationality, unknown. Date of birth, unknown.
Quaderi has a girlfriend, Shakira.
who has a brother, Rafi Zayd.
no confirmed photo. Moved back to Yemen when he was seven.
no record of him returning to the U. S.Probably here illegally.
Nasim Boutros, stabbed by Rivkin at his hotel.
american citizen, born in Syria.
immigrated here when he was 14. Has a degree in engineering.
no criminal record.
first name-- Jumah. Last name-- unknown.
looks like he works at the auto shop, but he's not listed as an employee with the IRS.
possibly here illegally.
and finally, Haziq Khaleel.
born in Syria. Immigrated 12 years ago. Owns the auto shop.
pays his taxes, and has no criminal record.
five men, all born outside the United States.
very few personal details, no criminal activity.
not on anyone's watch list.
it's a classic sleeper cell.
Rivkin's making sure none of them wake up.
five people. Four passports, four suitcases. Something's missing.
then number five is the handler.
maybe Haziq?
no, Haziq's an alpha male.
a physical, take-charge kind of guy.
aggressive, angry.
handlers are more refined.
methodical planners, smooth talkers.
they know how to get under people's skin.
you know, make 'em feel things and do things, and...
you get the idea.
if it's not Haziq?
well, Shakira's brother Rafi's too young.
wouldn't have the respect of the others who all seem to be older.
then that leaves Nick Quaderi.
Yeah, but according to Rafi's sister,Nick Quaderi didn't know any of them till her brother introduced him to Haziq.
then we're missing something. - Yep. Or someone.
what did I miss?
Oh, Abby playing with crayons, possibly blood. McGee calling.
and I made a paper airplane that was so fantastic it broke the office gliding record.
but really all the fun's happening in another area code. Are we fighting?
if we were, you would be on the floor bleeding.
okay, I accept that as a likely outcome. So you're just annoyed with me?
angry?
you should not be surprised.
because of this morning?
you thought I would not identify Michael Rivkin as a Mossad operative.
I didn't say a word.
you did not have to.
so you think you did the right thing?
you think I didn't?
maybe you should have told them more.
like how well you know him.
how well do I know him, Tony?
you know him better than they think you do.
and you know that how?
well, you saw him when he was in D. C.three days ago.
you didn't tell them when you had the chance. And I'm just wondering why, that's all.
okay...
are you, by any chance, questioning my loyalty?
I'm questioning why you didn't tell them you saw him three days ago.
are you jealous?
no. I'm worried.
because you don't seem to understand that your secret friend is interfering with this agency's ability to shut down a terrorist cell.
interfering? How is he interfering?
he's already killed two suspects.
well, in my country that would be cause for celebration.
you're not in your country, and neither is he!
have you finished? - Yes.
good. - No.
another question. You know where we can find him?
no, I don't.
and if you did, would you tell me?
no.
but I would tell Gibbs.
I tried to stop my brother Rafi from getting involved with them.
now he's dragged Nick into it.
how long have you known him?
three months.
he travels a lot. I don't get to see him as much as I want.
at first Rafi didn't want me to see him at all, but Nick was patient.
now they're like brothers.
you know, I've never met Rafi.
you don't have any photos, do you?
of course.
Nick took it.
and you've probably got tons of photos of Nick in there, huh?
Nick's so camera shy, it's crazy.
hard to believe, but this is the only photo I have.
Eric, talk to me. Have we lost audio?
they're whispering, Mace. - Who's whispering?
everybody. - Why the hell are they whispering?
Sam? You ready?
on your command, Mace.
stand by. If you were Rivkin, where would you be?
I wouldn't be far; I'd want to finish the job.
at our expense.
if we're gonna find their target and their support team, we need at least one of them alive.
no, he doesn't think that way.
where the hell are you going?
let you know when I get there.
come on, G, speak up!
I need to contact Nick.
you heard Haziq--He's not answering.
well, I'm guessing he gave you another number, in case something bad happened.
something bad is going to happen.
you can't keep running away from this, who they are, what they're planning to do.
something bad's going to happen to Nick?
to your brother.
who are you?
I'm someone you need to trust right now.
okay, they've stopped whispering.
yeah? - I'm tired. I'm going home.
you can't keep me here.
no one leaves.
you can't stop me.
your friend better be on time.
promise me nothing will happen to Rafi.
promise me.
I promise you.
Nick Quaderi's real name is Michael Rivkin.
he can be contacted at 310-555-0130.
I already have his number, and I don't care what his real name is. Okay?
searching for the numb. - Rivkin's been playing us all along.
it's a cell phone.
I need a GPS location now.
Nick Quaderi's the name Michael Rivkin used.
he befriended Shakira so he could get to know her brother Rafi.
won over the brother to get invited into the cell.
that means that the body Rivkin told us was Quaderi is actually...
Rafi Zayd, her brother.
all right, we got Rivkin's location. He's almost on top of him.
pass it on to the nearest team.
I can't wait. Sam? Game's yours.
okay, Mace. Moving in.
go, go, go!
federal agents! Freeze! - NCIS!
Sam, I want him alive.
clear! - Clear!
all clear!
you'll live.
secured.
I got him, McGee.
you're Gibbs.
time for you to go home. Now.
I don't like leaving things unfinished.
you're done. I'm finishing it for you.
I leave, Washington and Tel Aviv look the other way.
that's not what I'd do.
we fight the same war.
only ours began in Auschwitz.
I have six million uniforms.
every one is different. - I got one.
she works for me.
shalom.
guess that drink's gonna have to wait.
well, my basement's always open.
it's good to see you, Jethro. - Yeah.
stay low.
red-eye, huh? - Yeah.
always worked for me.
sorry.
Thanks.
no problem.
long day, huh?
Ah, yeah, long... day.
just getting some, uh, some air.
right.
uh, Agent Gibbs?
good to meet you, Nate. - Likewise.
I, uh...
I took an oath not to betray confidences, but, um...
I can't see any harm in telling you a story.
18 years ago, there was this young lieutenant in the Military Police who investigated a murder.
a Marine gunnery sergeant had taken out this Mexican drug dealer who kied his family.
the young lieutenant interrogated the suspect, didn't hold back.
he just wanted closure, and she wouldn't leave his wife and daughter to rest in peace.
kind of thing that stays with you.
anyway, uh, she got all the evidence together, and then she buried it.
decided it was a... just killing.
my guess is that the guy never even knew that she'd been protecting him all these years.
well, I think I had enough fresh air.
are you gonna get out?
I think it's time to move.
again?
that's three times in the last 18 months.
it's four.
I don't know, I...
I just feel like someone's watching me.
it's probably that Russian girl you told me about.
you ever gonna settle down, G?
one day.
crazy son of a...
come on, G. Come on, G. Stay with me.
stay with me, G. Don't do this to me, come on!
Yeah, I need an ambulance.
ocean Front Road, Venice.
stay with me. Stay with me.
come on, buddy.
I missed McGee.
I would never have guessed that.
Hey, you and Ziva want to go get a drink?
uh, she is already gone.
did you do that secret thing I asked you to do?
Yep.
Rivkin flew out of Los Angeles today, unescorted.
destination?
Tel Aviv.
with a stopover in DC.
Ziva, you recognize him?
Yes, I know him-- his name is Michael Rivkin. He's with the Mossad.
anything you want to tell me?
two members of the terrorist cell are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit.
do you think there is any chance Ziva...
don't ask that question. Leave it to me.
interfering? How is he interfering?
he's already killed two suspects.
well, in my country, that would be cause for celebration.
you're not in your country, and neither is he!
michael Rivkin. Guy on the left? Director of Mossad.
Ziva's father. - Your father sends his love.
what else does my father send? - Me.
how well do I know him?
well, you saw him when he was in DC three days ago.
Ziva David. She works for me.
it's to you, Hutch.
director Hutchins.
did you hear that?
can't hear anything with you splashing the pot.
Len, who's your girl on point? Foster-Yates?
Yeah.
agent Foster-Yates come in.
Yes, sir-- is there a problem?
we just heard a noise on the patio.
Foster-Yates! - I'm on my way, sir.
get back inside! Stay inside, Director.
one through four, secure the perimeter. - What the hell's going on?
five through eight, converge on SecNav's residence.
we got an agent down! - Lock down the perimeter.
secure the doors.
get an ambulance... now!
immigration Customs Enforcement.
this is turning into a circus. - Here come the clowns.
FBI does have jurisdiction in the death of a federal agent.
well, I like our chances, with Gibbs in there waving a chair like Gunther Gebel-Williams.
lion tamer. He's my second favorite hero after Steve McQueen.
sure, because riding a motorcycle looks cool and all, but...
but no one messes with a man driving an elephant.
a game of cards between the agency chiefs at the Secretary of the Navy's house.
love to be a fly on that wall.
to buzz and irritate the big bosses?
no, to eavesdrop on their conversation.
that is an invasion of privacy, McGee.
mind your backs there, please.
ladies and gentlemen, the amazing Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard, the first and only M. E.under the big top.
not to slight your penchant for theatrics, Anthony, but, uh, where is our ringmaster?
duking it out for the job with Fornell and some girl from ICE.
excuse me.
a murder investigation?
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
agent Sherman could've had a heart attack, for all we know.
medical examiner is here.
great. NCIS takes the lead, supported by FBI, I. C.E.
CIA can go home.
my house, my rules. - Good luck.
all yours.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
agent Julia Foster-Yates. So...
cards on the table.
four high-profile targets in the same room.
we were tasked with protection.
for a poker game.
we take even the simplest assignments very seriously.
not seriously enough.
looks like someone dropped a cocktail wienie.
I have a riddle for you.
what is not food, but tastes very well?
I'll give you a hint.
and you should come up with the answer before Officer David, since it's right on the...
tip of your tongue.
he bit it off.
he was flailing, losing control of his limbs.
was he poisoned?
no, I don't think so.
he has this severe bruise on his neck.
no, this man was attacked.
are you certain?
are you the one that performed CPR?
unsuccessfully.
well, it was the right instinct. This man was oxygen-deprived.
see, he has petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes.
he was strangled.
that would suggest someone penetrated our security web unseen.
and why is that so unlikely?
because I designed it. It was airtight.
apparently not.
downloaded all the footage from the surveillance cams covering the grounds.
patio's a blind spot.
bosses get together couple times a year.
locations and responsibilities rotate.
SECNAV's place, ICE's people.
CIA brought the chips and dip.
the Bureau... - The booze.
little early for a drink, Jethro. - Yeah, I might need it.
to settle your gut?
something here bother you, boss?
no.
nothing here.
not here.
heads of the CIA, FBI, I. C.E.
that's a full bowl of alphabet soup, huh?
not all of them. Which letters you got on your badge, McGee?
oils from his face when he pressed against the glass.
powder is sticking. Might be adhesive.
agent DiNozzo, Officer David...
a fly.
bug.
on the wall.
boss, we found a listening device.
looks like it was stuck to the glass.
agent Sherman flails against the door.
it gets dislodged. Falls under his body.
whatever happened here...
is still happening. Is it functional?
damaged. Best not to take any chances.
No!
I mean, it's not like he left no trace behind.
he left exactly one trace. The bug.
but someone, in their infinite wisdom, decided to stomp it into a hundred pieces.
it might've still been transmitting.
it was not transmitting.
we could have tracked the signal, you know, maybe gotten a lead.
the bug stomps.
it's a classic movie move. Sounds like a Tony.
Nah, it was a Jules.
a Jules? What is a Jules?
I'm going to have to have a word with this Jules if we ever have the good fortune of meeting.
I'd like to be here for that.
what, you holding aces and eights there, McGee? Dead man's hand?
what? No, no, this is what was on the table when the game ended.
the pot's not right.
what do you mean?
well... at a quick glance, it looks like, uh, five-card draw, 50-buck ante.
ice starts the action with two bills, three callers.
SECNAV draws one to fill in an inside straight and misses-- figures.
CIA keeps the cowboys, mucks the rags, pulls a second pair.
hutch misses the flush but won't bow out.
ice is the clear leader, standing pat at the wheel.
I... I have no idea what you just said.
you got to be an idiot to still be in this hand.
are these guys not paying attention? They're not playing very well.
well, obviously not as well as you.
someone was spying on the card game.
dead agent got in the way.
in previous games, Davenport and his buddies have always threatened to play till someone dropped.
I guess we should have believed them.
you've played with them.
but not last night.
last time I played, I cleaned Hutch out. I cleaned them all out.
that's probably why they didn't invite you back.
got a hell of a poker face.
Ducky has the body.
McGee's processing the scene.
DiNozzo and David?
reviewing ICE's protection detail.
scouring the grounds with Agent Foster-Yates.
keep me updated. - Sir.
heavy footfalls on the lawn, directed towards the patio.
agents stationed at the perimeter converged on the house after Sherman went down.
they did not catch his attacker.
he did not get out this way.
unless he could cross a lawn without bending a blade of grass.
well, not impossible with the proper training.
she can also do that trick where you put your ear to a rail and you can hear a train coming.
you get this same training? - Me? No.
but I can eat a bucket of chicken in one sitting and, uh, I have X-ray vision.
complementary skill sets make for a stronger team dynamic.
I was always trying to explain that concept to Sherman.
bit of a maverick, huh?
he was a good agent.
I'm sure the two of you don't always agree on everything.
no, not everything.
healthy debate breeds, uh, creative solutions.
isn't that right, Ziva?
where did she go?
a few branches are missing up here.
a clear view of the property. He could study the patrol pattern.
they go in, he goes up, and then he goes out... that gate.
it's McGee.
Hey, Gibbs wants you guys to come back.
I'm up a tree. - Well, this might only confuse you further.
well, who said I was confused?
you said you're up a tree. - I am.
why is he calling you and not me? I'm the senior field agent.
I don't know why he's not calling you, Tony.
I did call Tony. - He's not making any sense.
and you're the one not making sense.
he said he called you.
I'm not getting a signal.
how come you're getting a sial and I'm not?
because I'm up a tree.
we solve cases all the time like this.
what did McGee have to say?
that it is time to go.
using his forearm and biceps, the attacker puts pressure on both sides of the neck, cutting off the blood supply through the carotid arteries.
here. Cradled in the crook of his arm...
the trachea and larynx remain unharmed.
Tobias, Tobi-- you, you push up on a rear choke, not down, - and you turn your chin into your shoulder. - Yeah.
after a few moments in the aptly named sleeper hold, and the victim loses consciousness.
failure to release the pressure causes a complete systematic shutdown.
the bladder and bowels release. - Hey, Duck?
Oh, continue the pressure and the result is inevitable.
death.
by asphyxiation.
Yeah, well, that's what I was anticipating but not what I discovered.
agent Sherman's medical records.
he had warning signs of atherosclerotic disease.
aggravated by the temporary deprivation of blood to the brain and...
he suffered a fatal stroke.
Yeah, but if the attacker's intent was to kill, he would have held the choke hold long enough until the lungs failed.
I'm good. - But he didn't.
attack wasn't meant to be lethal.
well, that's what I think.
so the intruder makes his way quickly through a secure perimeter, subdues the only guard he encounters silently, and leaves a listening device behind.
and vanishes.
we're dealing with a pro, which eliminates the neighbor kid retrieving a lost Frisbee.
I'll have the Bureau compile profiles.
using your X-ray vision?
black lace, matching set.
Really? On the job?
SECNAV usually has an NCIS agent tasked to guard him at all times, but ICE was assigned the detail.
ten men in total, huh?
for a poker game they were not even playing.
why don't you tell us what's really going on?
the game was just a cover. Wasn't it?
I was instructed not to reveal any details.
Oh, I think you should disregard that instruction.
four agencies filled with people who speclize in finding out information.
it was an intelligence summit.
what was the subject?
I wish I knew.
whatever it was, someone was willing to kill to find out.
intelligence summit?
seems like your classic contradiction in terms.
don't give me the look; I didn't know.
you had suspicions.
because you had suspicions. I'm riding shotgun here, Gibbs.
Yeah, can I borrow it? - Go easy, Hoss.
she was just doing what she was told.
you do not get to determine what is worth sharing and what is not.
I don't answer to you, Agent Gibbs. - Yes, you do.
yes... you... do.
what else have you left out?
perimeter!
uh, solid design, boss. Effective.
barring human error.
are you suggesting I'm incompetent or this was an inside job?
dealer's choice.
boss, you know, I could use the footage to build an animated model and recreate the movements of all the players, see if there was any possible path of entry.
all I would need is the position reports.
you got that. Help him out.
starting to doubt the invisible man theory, boss?
Backgrous.
every agent on the detail last night-- personal and professional histories.
possible suspects with the necessary skills, starting with known foreign operatives in the area.
FBI profiles.
really help narrow it down if we knew what the summit was about.
Yeah, it would. You got another one of those?
triplicate.
we need to know what they were discussing.
please come right in.
it's crucial to the investigation.
suppose it goes to motive.
Yes, it does, Mr. Secretary.
sit down, gentlemen.
first year of a new president's term, he's tested. Check your timeline.
june, July, eight years ago, Al-Qaeda showed themselves.
in flight schools where no one was interested in learning how to take off or land.
our opportunity was missed because agencies weren't in the habit of sharing information.
there've been far too many foreign nationals being far too comfortable on American soil
gun runners, terror cells, even Israeli Mossad.
you mean like Rivkin.
slipping through our borders like 9/11 never happened.
came to a head in L. A. with OSP.
Mossad's operative still hasn't been called home since then.
that's Director Eli David's not too subtle message that we're not doing a strong enough job of policing our own backyard.
the pretext of a poker game was meant to cut down on the chatter leading up to the summit, and the informal setting serves to loosen stubborn lips accustomed to secrecy.
NCIS wasn't represented. - I was there.
was one surviving member of the cell in California Haziq Khaleel?
he's in custody.
Macy and Hanna-- they conducted the interrogation.
did he spill?
Haziq gave up his handler Abin Tabal.
he gives up anything on Callen's shooter? - No.
how's Callen doing?
he's still critical.
he's hanging in there.
we got a guy on our watch list using the alias Abin Tabal
believed to be here in Washington.
chase him down.
Abin Tabal, aka Adolfo Ruiz, aka Hikmet Gillersoy, aka, like, nine other de-up names.
over the course of the last three years, he has hit the watch list with Spanish, Russian, Chechnyan, Greek, and Cypriot passports.
doesn't keep the same one very long.
the United States is the only common destination among all the passports.
under various identities, he's landed in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, and Niger.
so the guy's got a fondness for Northern Africa.
excuse me. Officer David.
shalom.
what do you think? Training center?
he's the handler.
goes back and forth between headquarters and activating sleeper cells in the States.
I'll catch Gibbs up. Find the guy.
Oh, o-okay. I like taking orders from just about anybody, I guess.
especially the guy who framed me for murder.
one minute he's framing me for murder, the next he's treating me like a perfectly capable agent.
the nerve.
I have to run out for a few minutes.
I'll be right back.
I will be right here.
full digitization would take all day.
Quick-scan the access road footage?
exactly what I was thinking, Jules.
thanks for coming to my rescue up there.
I appreciate it, Tim.
my pleasure.
are you often in the habit of destroying evidence, Jules?
beg your pardon?
you should, actually, because I'm the one responsible for reconnecting and reactivating all of those extremely delicate pieces of electronics.
you can do that? - Of course I can.
then what's the problem?
you probably know some kind of martial arts or something, huh?
when I was in high school, my mother was the ambassador to Bangkok.
I fell in love with Muay Thai.
so I tried to scratch your eyes out, you could probably break my fingers?
that would be a mistake.
you need your fingers to fix that bug.
and in my own lab.
rewind that security footage.
uh, it's the same car.
second time it's passed by.
casing the place. Can you I. D.the driver?
no, but I can pull the plate.
let's pull up the registration.
someone you know?
I got to get Gibbs.
uh, Jules, you should probably come with me.
a vehicle.
pulled off surveillance approaching SECNAV's house.
that doesn't belong to Abin Tabal.
come on, Leon, you should be able to recognize your own car.
what were you doing outside the house?
I wasn't invited inside.
I'm getting very tired of information being withheld.
I know what you mean.
curiosity can make you do some funny things.
like what?
cruise a secret meeting?
just to confirm it took place.
director Hutchins let it slip a week ago.
before he realized you were being excluded?
it's a tough town, Gibbs.
believe it or not, I'm still trying to get the hang of it.
relationships are delicate.
why weren't you invited?
because they were there to talk about me.
I wish I could stay for lunch, Michael.
that's okay. Join me for a drink.
another vodka, just a splash of soda this time, please.
uh, nothing for me, thanks.
I'm working on a case.
tell me.
this is what a relationship looks like.
how was your day, dear?
I'll tell you when it's over.
Tony, I thought I told you I would...
shut up. You gotta get back here right now.
okay. - Now!
okay.
you have to go already?
well, we're looking for a terrorist, and Tony says we just found him, so...
I'll see you later?
thank you. - You're welcome.
is this seat taken?
this is a little like that scene in Heat when Pacino and DeNiro finally meet.
I'm De Niro in this scene?
you think you're DeNiro in this scene. Okay.
you can call me Al.
I'll spare you the singing.
you've come to chase her away from me.
in the very tan flesh. Trip to L. A. did you good.
Ziva prefers darker skin.
how does she like being played?
cause I think we both know; this romance isn't kosher.
I can understand your suspicions, given what we have about you in your dossier...
agent Meatball.
there's an El Al flight tonight out of Ronald Reagan at 8: 25 p. m.
lands at Ben-Gurion tomorrow evening.
I'm not finished spending time with Ziva.
NCIS says you are.
Ziva's very lucky to have a man like you in her life.
like a... big brother.
I've got some work to do, and you clearly have some drinking to finish, and after that, I think you should start packing.
you can question my feelings for Ziva all you want.
unfortunately, you can't question her feelings for me. Can you?
say good-bye, Mikey. Get on the flight.
we've reconstructed everyone's movements from last night on this is a wire frame representation of the SecNav's residence.
these blue figures represent the agents on patrol.
the units moved in overlapping sweeping patterns on the outer layer.
the inner layer was stationary.
sophisticated.
even if someone managed to get through the outer ring unseen, their path would be limited.
they'd be funneled into plain sight.
so, what went wrong?
well, there's a hole in the net.
when Sherman leaves to take the position on the patio, leaves this avenue wide open.
Yes, it does.
well, you got an explanation?
it's an error.
nobody's perfect, Jules. Not you and not this guy. We'll find him.
Ziva, you got those backgrounds?
almost finished. These are what we have so far.
got to check in with my boss. - Sure.
Abby needs my help with the bug. - Go.
this idea of friendly relations between agencies, full disclosure...
flies in the face of history.
you vouch for the ICE princess?
she's cool on the outside, but when she opens up, she's...
she's full of beans, molten cheese, like a microwave burrito.
what? I'm hungry.
so when the bug is working properly, it emits a signal that can piggyback on any available internet connection, and then, it can upload the audio to a live stream on a private Web site.
Oh, so, basically, it's a fancy tin can.
we follow the string to the can on the other end.
what, you never camped out in the backyard as a kid?
are you crazy? There were alligators in my backyard.
you know, you don't really need my help with this.
second set of hands can't hurt.
you are feeling neglected?
neglected? More like nauseous.
having to watch you flirt with that Jules.
come on. I wasn't flirting.
your hands drifting across the keyboard.
pinkies accidentally grazing each other.
please. I know.
she's out of my league, anyway, Abs.
no, she's not.
we have not found Tabal yet.
we really should be working harder.
I came back here quickly because you said we had found Abin Tabal.
where were you?
where were you?
he was in L. A. on business just like he's in D. C. on business.
I cannot believe you. If you wanted to meet him, you could ask me to introduce you.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check on him.
Gibbs told him to clock out.
I told him to clock out.
perhaps it would carry some more weight if it came from you.
michael is here to see me. He is not working. He is on vacation.
well, he certainly is drinking like it.
conference room this way?
I'll show you.
cpb hasn't gotten a hit yet on any of Abin Tabal's known aliases.
likely he's still in the country.
the invisible man.
the results of interviews with every member of your team last night.
there were some bad feelings circulating.
inevitable with any team, I imagine.
performance reviews-- Agent Sherman's and yours.
he had four more years of service than you did, but you were promoted over him.
with good cause. You'll notice my evals and recs were consistently higher.
he openly objected to taking orders from a woman with less seniority.
you can't have appreciated that.
agent Sherman was very passionate about his duty.
he was a thorn in your side.
let's just stop right here, before you embarrass yourselves by actually accusing me of killing Agent Sherman!
I lost an agent last night.
maybe that gets easier with time, but for me, it's...
I've been trying not to kick dirt on a dead man's grave.
that's my mistake.
his death is not...
he wasn't supposed to be on the patio.
he was out of position.
he disregarded his assignment.
Why? - I don't know.
spite. Jealousy.
he was never concerned about making me look bad.
there was a hole in the net because he moved.
he's dead for the same reason he never got the promotion.
he didn't operate as part of a team.
and you do?
Yeah. Gibbs.
Yeah. All right.
Abby's got a link to Tabal.
you are coming?
schematics of SecNav's house.
looks like our guy. - So does this.
well, at least now we know he really existed.
potassium cyanide poisoning.
we found a residue of silica and polyisoprene between his first and second premolars.
he bit down on a suicide pill.
just a few hours ago. - Yeah.
no signs of forced entry at the motel.
no indication of any struggle.
Abin Tabal killed himself.
this guy's supposed to be invisible.
that's his primary asset as an operative.
he loses that when he accidentally kills an American agent.
his usefulness is gone.
we close off all exit routes.
so he decides to take the only other way out.
you back this psychology?
Yeah. If-If he was a true believer.
if he believed himself a threat to the cause, then exposure becomes his enemy.
if he removes himself, he removes the problem.
after he's passed on all the intel he's managed to accumulate.
he wiped his computer.
sifting through it.
but she already connected the laptop to the electronics and the listening device?
smoking gun.
case closed. Write it up.
I think you're already packed up, McGee.
he's delaying his departure to coincide with someone else.
it was nice working with you guys. Thank you for everything.
Yeah, you, too. - You, too.
I'll walk out with you.
so what did Gibbs and Fornell have to say?
they were just apologizing for implying I might be a murderer.
you're kidding. They were? - Yes.
the both of them? - That's so shocking?
well, uh...
you know, it might take a while to fully grasp the significance of that.
okay. Explain it to me. I've got no plans.
all right.
did Gibbs actually say the words, "I'm sorry"?
good night. - Night.
rule Number 11, DiNozzo.
I would never date a co-worker, boss. Trust me.
I mean, why would you even...
that's 12.
11. when the job is done, walk away.
the case is wrapped up, DiNozzo.
in a nice, little bow.
and, and that works for you, Fornell? Crazy terrorist kills himself.
can't really understand that mentality.
doesn't mean I can't accept it.
so what's on your mind?
Rivkin's been in town.
I know.
with Ziva.
guy doesn't listen.
does that bother you on a professional level or a personal one?
well, I tell you what-- I'm having a little trouble untangling the two.
so you are bothered.
Oh, yeah.
it bothers me. You stay on it.
Yep.
how'd you know what I like to drink, Gibbs?
my older brother gave me my first bourbon, before I was even a teenager.
he liked to mess with my head.
my grandfather had a still.
it blew up once...
and he ran back inside to rescue his sour mash.
it is a living thing.
it's safe to talk here?
safer than your house.
it was a point of pride with my brother, though.
I never hit you, he'd say.
preferred psychological warfare.
you're an only child, aren't you, Gibbs?
the Corps.
strangers... become brothers in a foxhole.
that why you've been digging dirt?
trying to get closer to Leon?
no.
I never asked for this.
never opened it.
well...
let's see what the CIA's got on Leon Vance.
I thought we shredded all these.
how does this thing keep finding its way into the open?
it's not even real.
lucky you didn't read this.
wouldn't give you the whole picture anyway.
and you will?
is that Tabal's laptop? - Yeah.
before Tabal killed himself, he wiped all the sensitive information.
Oh, so there's nothing useful on it, huh?
he did fail to erase the laptop's network location memory.
it's a log that records all previous network connections, so you can access them easily in the future.
all that's going to tell us is where he's used the Internet before.
bring that up.
I know that address. - Yeah. Me, too.
it's Ziva's.
lot of black bars covering Leon's career.
man was born for counterintelligence.
you didn't peg him for a lifelong bureaucrat...
Nah. Figured he'd worn a few hats.
heard a whisper or two.
there's not a second of his life I can't account for.
I might hit him with a stick every now and then, but, uh,
I did not leave him out of that poker game because I don't trust him.
you were discussing how to use him.
Yeah, I know.
since Director Shepard's death, you've been concerned with the danger in having the wrong person at the top.
well, you're not alone.
you're not the only one looking out for the integrity of NCIS.
leon's going to be point man in a major operation.
who's the enemy? - That's the problem. It's our friends.
the Israelis. Top priority.
ever since Shepard created that unorthodox position of "liaison officer.
you're talking about Ziva David.
father's the director of Mossad, half-brother was a rogue operative.
he died in this room, didn't he? At your hand.
and she works with you every day.
what a family.
Ziva, it's Tony.
you're here.
Ziva is not.
she'll be back soon.
you're welcome to come in and wait for her.
did you really expect me to leave her because you threaten me?
I had my hopes.
did they include you coming here late at night?
maybe finding Ziva in an emotional state?
you help her pick up the pieces?
I'm here about a case.
an American agent was killed last night.
all the evidence points to a terrorist named in Tabal.
I think you're familiar with him.
of course, he killed himself before we could catch up to him.
zealot. - That's the theory.
it's a little too clean for me.
does not sound clean at all.
sounds like the further you dig, the messier it gets.
well, what can I say?
the events of the past year have made me a little suspicious.
even to the people closest to you?
Oh, especially them.
we pulled information from Tabal's computer.
says that, at some point, the internet was connected here.
Ziva's account.
she is tied to this dead man?
who is obviously duplicitous.
practiced in the art of misinformation.
that appears to be the shape of things.
you're here to question Ziva?
all because a series of numbers on a terrorist's computer?
I was.
until you opened the door.
semper Fi.
you and Leon gotta play nice.
you are ordering me to trust him?
just to follow him.
we don't hit our brothers.
soon as you're done with your drink, Michael, you're under arrest for the murders of Abin Tabal and Federal Agent Tom Sherman.
good luck with that.
enough!
don't do it. - No.
don't!
please authenticate.
Mossad Officer, Ziva David. Authentication Code-- GIMEL, VAV, HET, SHIN.
shalom, Officer David.
we need a forced extraction, now.
target?
have you notified your father?
I'm notifying you. Who do we have in the area?
how bad? - Who do we have?
I will handle it. - He is at my apartment.
I will make sure he stays there. - Someone will be sent.
Oh, my God.
come on, Michael.
Ziva... I'm sorry.
now!
stay with me. Come on.
come on!
Tony. - I'm okay.
got a fractured radius and a couple of bruises, but...
I had new intel. I went to talk to Ziva.
question Ziva.
DiNozzo. - When I got there, Rivkin attacked me.
and I had no choice.
it was justified.
go, write it up.
there's gonna have a lot of people wanting answers.
Rivkin is dead. Tony killed him.
you saw it? - I saw enough.
Ziva, you have to tell me everything.
you'll have my I-A report on your desk before lunch.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I can't believe I'm finally going to get to see Ziva's new apartment.
well, obviously, I wish it was under better circumstances.
though it is Ziva's place.
and she's Ziva.
so McGee, Rivkin, Tony, Ziva
what do you know? - Nothing.
I saw Tony snooping around Ziva's desk.
it was the day before she went back to Tel Aviv. He answered the phone.
I think he talked to Rivkin.
I can't believe I'm telling you this. Tony's going to kill me.
not if Mossad gets to him first.
you don't think the director's going to just hand him over.
boss, Rivkin tried to kill him.
Tony's word against a dead guy's.
Yeah, but Ziva will back him, right?
Tony doesn't just murder people, you know.
obviously, the shooting was self-defense. All we've got to do...
got a problem, McGee?
you mean apart from Tony killing Ziva's friend and Ziva's apartment blowing up?
no, no problem at all. - Good. Then shoot.
Hey, boss.
laptop. Kind of.
floor underneath's barely been touched.
it must have been there when the fire started.
under a drawer-- a strange place to keep a laptop.
not if you're hiding it.
it gives a whole new meaning to "fried hard drive," huh?
you know, "fried hard drive," is a computer term. - Yeah, McGee, I got it.
three cuts in the gas line.
the fire chief said it must have been leaking for at least an hour.
no one smelled gas.
which is odd, considering most of the neighbors were home.
these look clean. Looks like a pro job.
boss could be the trigger.
bag it. - Yup.
would you like a moment? - Not necessary.
while you're here, perhaps you could shed some light on Officer Rivkin's beliefs.
I've already contacted a rabbi friend of mine and asked him to be present when I perform the autopsy.
also not necessary.
michael was Jewish by birth, not practice.
traditions can be a comfort.
ancient rites. Very appropriate today.
they not only show respect for the dead, but they also bring a sense of comfort to those who are left behind.
rituals only work for those who need them.
I need you to run a back-trace on a cell phone.
sure, I just need the... number.
boss, this is Ziva's cell.
you already knew that. Okay, back-trace on it.
internal
I know what you're going to say, Gibbs.
no, I don't think you do.
I know you think I lied to you about Rivkin, but I did not.
you asked me if I knew him. You asked me if he worked for Mossad.
not if I was seeing him, not... - Sit down.
your apartment's been destroyed.
gas fire-- earlier this morning.
perhaps the line was damaged during the fight.
I would talk to Tony.
no, this was no accident.
the gas lines were cut.
any idea... - No.
that was a quick answer. - Simple question.
that's your home.
no, it's not.
this is a thorough report.
you only left out a few little things.
like why you broke protocol, why you went alone and why the hell didn't you inform me.
my gut told me that it was Rivkin, not Ziva.
and sometimes my gut just sucks.
but if Ziva knew something, I wanted to give her the chance to explain it to me.
you wanted to protect her.
she needed it.
Tony's left radius was fractured during this brawl.
but he and Officer Rivkin suffered a whole assortment of other injuries.
all of them consistent with Tony's version of the story.
Tony told the truth.
this is good news, Jethro.
doesn't add up.
DiNozzo's more a brawler.
Ah, I thought you'd never ask.
putting the "why" aside, Agent DiNozzo, I am, curious how you got out of there alive.
well, I've always been a pretty decent fighter, if I do say so myself.
scrappy.
you telling you offed a Mossad assassin by being scrappy?
what do you want from me, Director?
honesty in detail.
well, that is what I'm trying to do here.
and maybe you're right. Maybe Rivkin should have won.
but he didn't.
he's dead and I'm not, and I don't have a concrete reason why.
what's this?
concrete. Rivkin was hammered.
he might have had a couple of cocktails, but, I mean, he was doing a pretty good job hamming me.
there's no way he was drunk.
blood alcohol level was. 16
twice the legal limit to drive.
maybe I should have called him a cab.
you went off grid.
you killed an officer of the Mossad.
and to make things worse, the entire crime scene has been blown to hell.
people are going to have some questions.
you'd better have some damn good answers, Agent DiNozzo.
understood.
think your boy can handle the meat grinder that's coming?
he'll manage.
good, because he's going to have to step up, take one for the team.
what's the end game? - Diplomacy.
Leon. - Eli. Shalom, my friend.
gives a whole new meaning to "fried hard drive," huh?
how many times have you told that joke today?
none. Maybe once or twice.
newsflash, Mickey. Now is not the time for ha-ha's, okay?
sorry. - Somebody just tried to kill Tony and Ziva.
Ziva's apartment was targeted.
doesn't mean she was a target.
she could have been. And what about Tony? He almost died.
he didn't. - He could have.
sorry. What have you got, McGee?
Rivkin's prints. All over this laptop.
at least what is left of it.
were you able to get any intel off the hard drive?
no, it's fried.
sorry. Dead.
we may be able to partially retrieve some of the lost data, but it's going to take a while.
couple days. - You got one.
boss, that's not even...
that's a very reasonable request.
major Mass Spec is still processing that.
I was thinking it's probably a salami roll wrapped in s'mores.
do you have a better idea? - I do.
I know I was told not to involve myself in the investigation.
yet here you are.
since it is my apartment, I thought I should at least take a look at the crime scene photographs.
no, not going to happen. - Not a chance.
perhaps I should have made myself clearer.
I have already scanned through the photos.
McGee left them running on his computer.
that being said, I feel obliged to tell you what I have found.
talk.
that is actually an activated charcoal filter which has been doused in ethanethiol.
we plant them on cut gas lines to mask the smell.
that way, fire can be triggered without warning.
we?
it is s technique used by many agencies.
including Mossad.
pack your bags.
you and DiNozzo, too. I've been asked a favor. I've just decided to grant it.
we're on the next flight to Tel Aviv.
director Vance.
director David will see you shortly.
he's anxious to speak with you.
as am I.
officer David. It's been far too long.
thank you for coming.
there's no reason to thank me.
my visit has nothing to do with you.
Ziva. Always fl of fire.
shall I introduce myself?
officer Amit Hadar, Special Agent Gibbs.
special Agent DiNozzo.
shalom. - Shalom.
agent DiNozzo, please, ride with me.
I insist.
it will allow us a chance to get to know one another.
I am going to see him again, right, Leon?
officer Hadar will not harm him.
only two people have the authority to do that.
your father is one. Second?
me.
when did you start wearing so much makeup?
nice to see you, too.
with traffic, I wasn't expecting you for another hour.
I drove. - Enough said.
sit.
sit.
so, tell me, how are you? - I have been better.
michael was a good man. Loyal.
loyal to whom?
to all of us.
I'm not certain that is true.
you're angry.
I am confused.
that is why I asked you here.
to find answers? - No, my dear. To find solace.
you leave finding the answers to me.
my daughter speaks very highly of you.
she's a good agent. - Liaison officer.
she's one of us.
so she tells me.
so's the guy in there.
agent DiNozzo...
my sincere apologies for your wait.
that okay.
I dig hanging out in concrete bunkers.
especially after 12-hour plane rides in cramped quarters.
your sarcasm is noted.
so's your shirt. Nice style. What is it? Zegna? Cavalli?
you got good taste.
I'm not certain how my apparel applies to your visit.
and I am not certain how you can classify my visit... as a visit.
all right.
just so we understand, this is what I do for a living.
I interrogate people all day long.
so I know all the tricks of the trade.
and nothing that you do is going to intimidate me.
interrogate?
this is an Assembly Room. It's a place for mutual discussion.
you have yet to see our Interrogation Room.
but if you continue with childish arrogance, I promise that you will.
son of a bitch.
how many times did I tell DiNozzo to leave his smart-ass attitude back in DC?
you should have checked his bags.
I thought you said your boy was up for this.
you're the one who threw him to the wolves, Leon.
let him fight his own way.
you call this a fight? He'd better start showing me something.
taking one for the team?
he already has.
no, Agent DiNozzo, what you need to understand is that I am very aware of who you are.
your achievements and your misjudgments.
okay. Stop right there.
if this is about my Twitter page, I just want to clarify.
I had a couple of cocktails, and, what can I say?
sometimes I get a little chatty.
do you know who I am?
you're the director of Mossad.
and Ziva's father. Although I'm not sure which one's asking the questions.
sometimes it is hard to separate.
and it appears that you have had difficulty separating your work from your emotions, as well.
you believed Officer Rivkin was bad?
he killed an American agent. - An accident.
unlike his death, which was intentional.
but what... was behind that intent?
retribution... for an agent you had never even met?
you knew that Officer Rivkin would be at Ziva's apartment.
you went there to confront him, to provoke him.
and once again, you blurred the lines, Agent DiNozzo, between your professional duty and your personal desires.
you wanted Rivkin out of my daughter's life, so you killed him.
isn't that the truth, Agent DiNozzo?
it's like I told your director.
I went to Officer David's apartment, at which time Officer Rivkin attacked me.
it was kill or be killed.
if that were true, my friend, you would be dead.
you wouldn't mind that, would you?
you send all your rogue agents to DC?
make it our mess?
I guess I shouldn't be surprised about Rivkin, considering you did the same thing with Ari, and he was your son.
speaking of family, what kind of a father would throw an out-of-control assassin at his own daughter?
what kind of business are you running here, huh?
everyone just runs around doing whatever the hell they want?
they do as I say.
Rivkin? - Always.
well, I'll be damned.
Yeah. Gibbs.
Hey, boss. How's Tel Aviv?
forget Tel Aviv. How's Tony? How's Ziva? Are they talking y?
they're fine, Abby.
I'll take that as a no. So, how is Israel?
what? He said they're fine. It's magical, right?
I mean, I've been wanting to go there for years-- it's, like, third on my list.
the Galapagos Islands and, of course, Dollywood. Gibbs?
the case, Abby.
McGee and I, we've been working on Rivkin's computer, and, um...
we're doing fairly well.
uh, with a little luck, I think we'll make our 24-hour deadline.
boss, I ran the back-trace on Ziva's cell.
most of the calls check out. - Most?
well, she did make one call from her car two nights ago to a highly encrypted phone, Israeli registered.
call was placed just after midnight.
six hours before the bombing.
which means either Ziva really upset someone or...
don't say it.
she was somehow involved. - What'd I just say?
I traced the Israeli phone. It's registered to...
officer Amit Hadar.
now talk. - Ziva, what is this?
I said talk. - You called me, remember?
to remove Rivkin from harm.
harm from whom? - Himself.
circumstances had changed.
and this was your answer?
I protect the Mossad.
there was nothing to protect!
I should have known not to trust you.
as if it was my decision. - You have my father's ear!
Rivkin was in chaos. You knew.
and yet you decided not to tell your father.
you tried to protect Rivkin, but in truth, you are the reason he's dead.
Rivkin killed that American agent. You knew this!
and still you did not report him!
I called you and I told you to remove him!
too late! By then, we could not get him out of the country.
all we could do was clean up after him.
and you.
there is no one left to blame. Stop looking.
Hadar set the fire.
covering for Rivkin.
I was betrayed-- by Mossad, by my father, by Tony.
who's next? You?
pardon me, Director.
your Agent Gibbs is making my people very nervous.
he slipped through security.
any idea where he might be going?
knowing Gibbs, a coffee run?
man practically mainlines caffeine.
thank you.
it's been a long time, my friend.
Amsterdam.
how did it get this far? - Simple.
one of your agents killed one of my agents.
now, we both know that's not where this started.
I notified you of the sleeper cell.
your guy was already knee-deep in it.
you don't trust we can police our own backyard.
the view from where I sit is quite different.
the threats are... immediate.
unfortunately, I not have the luxury of patience.
sometimes patience is a necessity.
otherwise you end up making an enemy out of your friend.
and then we end up with a dead American and a dead Israeli.
and I know that's the last thing either one of us wants.
Rivkin wasn't a rogue agent.
he was following your orders-- you said so yourself.
I underestimated Agent DiNozzo.
you sent him in there to rile me up.
I learned from the best.
there's a terrorist training camp somewhere in North Africa.
we have not been able to pinpoint...anything exact, but we managed to identify one of their sleeper cells in Los Angeles.
so you sent Rivkin to L. A?
he was on an end run.
find the leader of the cell, he gives up the handler;
find the handler, he gives up the location of the training camp.
and he kills them along the way.
including the handler.
you can hardly leave those people behind to come after you.
Oh, I understand, Eli. I don't judge you.
I never have.
unfortunately, I cannot trust everyone in your intelligence community to be as understanding as you.
so you had Rivkin spy on them. - Yeah.
the death of the American agent was an accident.
Rivkin never got the intel about the training camp, did he?
all this to find a camp that's probably already been moved.
it's not about the camp.
it's the man who runs it.
well, he must be very important to you.
he killed one of my people.
I had no choice. - That's a lie.
why would I lie to you, Ziva?
to save your worthless ass.
from who? Vance? Mossad?
you jeopardized your entire career, and for what?
for you.
he was playing you, Ziva.
for some reason, you felt it was your job to protect me?
I did what I had to do.
you killed him.
if I hadn't, you'd be having this conversation with him.
but maybe that's the way you'd prefer it.
perhaps I would!
okay, why don't you just get this out.
you want to take a punch, take a swing?
get it out of your system! Go ahead, do it!
be careful, Tony, because, much like Michael, I only need one.
and that's what you're really angry about, isn't it?
that's what's bothering you. It's not that he's dead.
it's that your Mossad boyfriend got his ass kicked by a chump like me.
you took advantage of him.
he attacked me. What was I supposed...
you saw a glass table, you pushed him back, you dropped him on it,
he was impaled in the side by a shard of glass...
bloody, gasping for air!
I guess you read my report. - I memorized it!
you could have left it at that, you could've walked away, but no, you let him up!
you put a bullet in his chest!
you weren't there.
you could've put one in his leg!
you... weren't... there.
but I should've been!
you loved him.
I guess I'll never know.
what do you get, Abbs? - Hey, Gibbs.
wow, it's my first trans-global "What do you got, Abbs?
think maybe I could get a trans-global Caf-POW delivery?
depends on what you have.
we did a postmortem Humpty Dumpty on Rivkin's laptop.
and we were able to reconstruct most of the data from his hard drive.
he used a specialized algorithm to generate a well-harbored short key for most of his files.
but we managed to crack both the algorithm and the ISP protocols.
what's the point, McGee?
basically, we-we put his hard drive back together, and as it turns out...
it's not Rivkin's laptop.
so we got nothing.
no, actually, boss, we have everything.
this laptop belonged to Abin Tabal.
our dead handler?
Yep, that's the one. Rivkin probably switched laptops after he killed him.
throws us off and gives Rivkin all the intel he needed.
we've got serial numbers, names and cell phone numbers, all linked to various locations in North Africa.
and that's not all, Gibbs.
um, we were able to decrypt Rivkin's e-mail accounts.
which was only half the battle, because it was in Hebrew and...
hebrew is hard.
apparently, Rivkin was in DC working with Mossad contacts to gather intel on a terrorist training camp.
who were his contacts?
well, we-we traced several mails to, um...
a restricted account.
a very... very restricted account.
restricted by who?
us, Gibbs.
Rivkin was e-mailing Ziva... - At NCIS.
boss, you know this means Ziva knew...
Yeah, I got it, McGee.
it means Ziva was withholding vital...
I said I got it, Abby!
you told Michael to stay with me in DC. Why?
that is none of your concern.
I have made it my concern.
do not question me, Ziva.
was any of it real?
does it matter? Michael is gone. You must move on.
it's no longer about him.
agent DiNozzo? - I need to know if he was right.
he was jealous.
even if that were true, that does not make him wrong. Now, answer me!
was it real? - I don't know. Perhaps.
why was I not told the details of his mission?
why was I excluded?
because, Ziva, I don't know who you answer to anymore.
NCIS? Or Mossad?
what is it you expect from me?
I expect your loyalty. To me and only me!
you want to know Michael's assignment?
make this your Aliyah.
you return to me, to us.
you finish what Michael started.
so, that's it, right? I'm done with Israel? We're not coming back here?
get on the plane, DiNozzo.
all right, you got it, boss. Take her easy.
our people pulled this off the laptop Rivkin was using.
should answer a lot of your questions.
thank you. And thank Miss Sciuto, as well.
is there anything you don't know?
not anymore.
happy hunting, Eli. - Shalom, my friend.
plane leaves in five minutes, Ziva.
not without us, it doesn't.
I think it is best if I simply speak from the heart.
well, yeah, it usually is.
it's Tony.
I am still not convinced that he has been entirely truthful about Michael's
Rivkin's shooting.
he gave you his word.
I am not sure we can work together.
perhaps it is best if one of us gets transferred to another team.
transferred?
I need to be able to trust the people that I work with.
I know you, more than anyone, understands that.
take care of yourself.
boss?
one short?
good to go.
are they here yet?
Abbs, I told you, I'll call you as soon as they show up. Scout's honor.
that's too late, McGee.
it's not an official "Welcome Back."
I mean, if I'm here and they walk in, I get to say, "Yay, welcome back!
if they're already here and I come in like Miss Tardy to the party, then technically it's like them welcoming me back.
tell him, Palmer.
uh, she... she makes a good point.
I saw that, Palmer!
okay, their flight's arrived. Where are they?
behind you.
Yay! Welcome back!
watch the... - We missed you!
sorry. - That's all right. Missed you too, Abbs.
Tony, I... - Jimmy.
so, Ziva's getting her stuff or... - No.
she parking her car? - No.
well, what is she doing?
well, considering the time difference, probably eating breakfast.
she's still in Tel Aviv? - Yep.
well, when is she coming back? - She's not.
No! This cannot happen! Vance cannot do this again!
wasn't Vance's call.
well, if it wasn't Vance, then who?
Jethro, forgive the intrusion.
how did you possibly manage to...
Aw, geez, Duck, you gonna ask me that every time?
how was your flight?
one short.
Yeah, I know this decision must not have come easily.
it wasn't my decision. - But Tony said...
no. Ziva's.
the moment she asked me to choose.
Ah, so this is not about loyalty, it's about an unreasonable demand.
she withheld information.
to protect Rivkin.
someone she obviously cared about.
Ziva has always remained an officer of Mossad.
I certainly don't envy the position that she just found herself in.
considering her less-than-conspicuous background, it's amazing she ever had your trust.
no, she earned it.
but you took to Ziva more quickly than any other agent before her.
Timothy, Caitlin, even DiNozzo.
I've always sensed that there's a strong bond between the two of you.
something shared, perhaps.
no. She proved herself.
whatever it was that Ziva did to prove her loyalty, well, it was not nearly as momentous as you believed.
or was it?
went over the personnel files, like you asked.
there's a couple that stood out.
both would be a good fit. - Take your pick.
I'll let you know in a few months.
Yeah, I knew it couldn't be that easy.
you think she might ask to come back?
I'm just giving her time. That's all.
time to what?
remember who she can trust.
let me make it easy for you, Gibbs.
you made the right call.
I wasn't asking for your opinion, Leon.
just who the hell you think you're talking to?
that's a good damn question. I've been wondering about that for a while.
you know, you spend half your time second-guessing me.
studying me, testing me.
I'm looking for answers.
it'd help if you'd ask the damn questions.
there's the rub. You don't have a clue what to ask.
you don't trust me, but you don't know why.
you want to talk about trust?
what about tearing apart my team last year?
there was no warning, there was no discussion.
is that what this is about? You want to sit in the big chair.
no, I don't. I want to trust whoever does sit there!
I want to protect my team.
like Ziva? Okay, fine.
you made the decision to leave in Tel Aviv. I supported you.
and now you might want to let her back. Why?
because whatever she might have done, I trust her for what I know she did.
four years ago... - She saved your life.
by shooting and killing her half-brother, Ari.
I told you the chair was big.
Ari was out of control.
so, Ziva's father sent her to eliminate him.
she kills Ari, earns your trust.
two birds, one bullet.
Eli played you.
but regardless, Gibbs, up until now, Ziva's always been loyal to this agency.
I know you don't want to hear this, Gibbs.
but now you have to trust me.
and if you're right about Ziva's allegiance to you, she'll serve us well at Mossad.
Yeah, and if you're right about her father...
we'll never see her again.
guess she'll call when she's ready.
tell me everything you know...
about NCIS.
there you are! It's about time.
what took so long?
you know I need my coffee in the morning.
well, next time, go yourself.
I was embarrassed ordering a non-fat, extra-foamy, added-shot hazelnut latte.
crew's going to be here in ten minutes.
this thing going to be running?
we're already two days behind. We don't need any more delays.
well, I don't understand. Was something wrong?
okay. Sure, Wednesday will be fine.
can we do it earlier than later?
great-- 9: 00. Thank you.
strange.
is that for our benefit, McGee?
we supposed to ask what's wrong?
that was Polygraph. I have to take another test.
you took your annual last week.
they want me to retake it.
you failed your polygraph? That's not good.
no, I didn't fail it. They said I have to take it again.
why would you have to take it again?
don't ask, don't tell.
you didn't make the mistake of coming out, did you?
I don't have anything to come out about.
stick to that story, McQueen.
it has to be some kind of mistake.
I'm sure it is nothing.
this could be a career-ender.
you better figure out what you did wrong; how you screwed up.
Hey, boss, you ever fail your polygraph? - Nope. Never took one.
come on, got a dead body.
marine? - Nope.
sailor? - Nope.
blogger. Matt Burns.
the pond scum who's been kicking our ass on the Internet?
what happened to him?
don't know, but we're going to find out.
Hey, Duck, you need me?
it looks as if you're busy. It can wait.
I'll check with you when I get back.
anything I can do from here?
you still haven't been cleared for field work?
I'm still waiting for my status to be clarified.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
that would really make me mad. Well, how about you?
are you asking as a friend or a forensic psychologist?
Yeah. After what you've been through, it must be really hard to readjust.
especially bound to that desk.
but if you feel like talking, you know where to find me.
Thanks, Duck.
get all of it.
got a print there, huh?
you're NCIS. - Yeah.
nice scarf.
really brings out the color of your eyes.
thank you.
you shouldn't be wearing it at a crime scene.
loose fibers contaminated the vehicle.
special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.
detective, uh... Megan Hanley.
it's your first crime scene?
Yeah, it's a rookie mistake. We all made them.
this is Special Agent Gibbs. This is Detective Hanley.
Matt Burns' death may be related to a case we're working on.
what can you tell us?
uh, not much, at this point.
we know that he fell over the bridge a little after 6: 00 a. m.
he almost landed on some city workers.
he jump or was he pushed?
they didn't see what happened, but we did find a shoe print that doesn't match the victim near the railing where he fell.
boss, this is Detective Sportelli, Metro Police. He's in charge.
special Agent Gibbs.
this is a little awkward.
detective Hanley? Do you know they're from NCIS?
Yeah. - What did you tell them?
I was just filling them in on what we know so far.
which doesn't sound like much, Detective.
you ran the I. D. on the vic.
what did you say he did for a living?
uh, he writes the blog. He's Beltway Burns.
he was trashing NCIS.
said they were involved in a cover-up of a naval officer's death.
I wouldn't believe everything I read on the 'net.
we're trying to tie up a case.
be nice to know if the deaths were connected.
I have to maintain the integrity of this crime scene, Gibbs.
I expect your cooperation.
that includes investigating the possibility of an NCIS cover-up.
lieutenant Rod Arnett was a poster boy for the Navy.
a scion of New England bluebloods and a star quarterback at Annapolis.
his tragic death at the age of 26, in a weekend car crash, on the Pax River Naval Air Station was investigated by Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which was quick...to declare the death an accident.
it was an accident. Jackass.
my source from within the Pentagon says NCIS is covering up the true story.
lieutenant Arnett was involved in insider trading from his position as a public affairs officer in the Pentagon.
I can't take any more of this whack job.
go over everything we did on the Arnett case.
think there's a link between Arnett and Burns' death?
you have to find out. You're not going to get any help on this from Metro.
why do get the feeling that Gibbs and Sportelli are going to come to blows?
who is Sportelli?
he's the police detective who made the mistake of tugging on Superman's cape.
take a look at Burns' last post.
I'm about to meet a source who's going to blow the story wide open.
who's the source? - I'm working on that.
back-trace Burn's IP address.
this was sent through a cell tower near the bridge at 5: 45 a. m.
it's right before his death.
do you think Burns was killed because he was getting to close to the truth?
maybe he was knocked off by someone else whose life he ruined.
there's a lot of 'em.
judge Thomas Victor-- this is the one that put Burns on the map.
because of Burns, the judge withdrew his Supreme Court nomination?
he destroyed the guy. Think I'll pay the judge a visit.
you be careful. We're investigating Lieutenant Arnett.
burns is outside the purview of our case.
Ooh,"purview.
did big, bad Sportelli scare you off, McGee?
press power, then reset.
excuse me, that's just what I did do.
got a new toy, Duck?
portable digital X-ray machine.
it's going to be very useful, if I can just get the darn thing to work.
you know, I'd like to have a chat with the people that write these instruction manuals, but I don't believe we have a language in common.
you wanted to see me.
I wanted to check up on Ziva.
she went through far more than we suspected.
I tried to draw her out, but she doesn't want to talk.
I was wondering-- has she said anything to you?
no.
she will when she's ready.
something else?
lieutenant Arnett. I need you to review your autopsy file.
pressure from the director?
Abby's reviewing the physical evidence.
got to make sure we're right.
so when'd you hear about Burns?
this morning. Haven't stopped smiling since.
Yeah, I can understand that.
before that rodent crawled into my life,
I was a respected Federal court judge, nominated to the Supreme Court.
now, I teach business law at community college.
these kids can barely read, let alone write-- look at this.
who spells justice J-U-S-T-I-S-S? - Yeah.
burns accused you of plagiarism.
was that charge true?
in preparing a speech, I borrowed some phrases from a book I read.
burns called it "plagiarism.
and he was right. What I did was stupid.
but the nomination could've survived it. - But...
burns was looking to make a name for himself.
he accused me of infidelity, taking kickbacks, even went so far as to say I cheated in law school.
they were fabricated charges from unnamed sources.
it became embarrassing to me.
and to the administration.
I withdrew my nomination.
I'm going to have to get back to you about that. See you.
aren't you going to ask me where I was this morning, when Burns died?
I'll leave that to the Metro detectives.
what's his name? - Agent DiNozzo.
Hey, DiNozzo! What are you doing here?
see ya! - Get outta here!
the minute I heard about Matt Burns taking the header, I knew you'd be calling us back in.
well, Secnav is all over us to clean this mess up.
you were Arnett's CO. You saw no hint of insider trading?
it doesn't make sense.
why would Rod Arnett take a chance at being caught?
he had family money, unlimited future.
he was young, drove his sports car like a madman.
it was a car accident.
we're going to have to dig deeper.
lieutenant Summers, you were his project officer.
did you ever ride with him?
Yes, sir. Once.
he did drive pretty fast.
what about Arnett's future? Was it Navy?
no. His tour was over in a few months.
he was fielding job offers that Harvard MBAs would envy.
how about his social life?
don't know. Never saw him outside the office.
lieutenant, you know who he was close with?
uh, not really. We talked in the office.
but I have no idea who his friends were or anything like that.
okay, explain to me why we're doing this again?
what exactly does Gibbs expect me to find?
you know Susan Grady in Polygraph, right? - Yeah.
I did, I did a metal stress test on the steering wheel and the suspension mechanism; negative.
the computer analysis of the ECU, it recorded the vehicle pushing 6, 500 RPMs at 110 miles-an-hour when it rolled.
listen, you know Grady well enough to call and find out why I'm retaking my test?
I already did a computer accident reconstruction.
I was truthful, I was completely relaxed ...
based on the skid marks, and the position of the car ... - I was honest. I have no reason to lie.
and the victim's body. - Why would I lie?
you're not listening to me.
this was an accident. - I guess we've determined that.
but because of that creepy dead blogger who was spreading dreadful lies about us, we have to keep going over everything that we've already done.
Abby, Abby, I'm really worried, okay?
I've got to find out what's going on with this polygraph.
McGee, I'm sure it's nothing.
have you ever heard of an agent having to retake their test?
special Agent Kirschner.
Kirschner? - Yeah.
he was gone before you got here.
he was, um, he was let go.
your hunch was right. Going over Arnett's phone records,
I tracked an unusual number of calls to and from Lieutenant Jessica Summers.
based on the volume and times of the calls, it suggests they were more than just coworkers.
fraternization in the workplace, never a good idea.
the calls stopped abruptly about month ago.
that's curious. Someone must have ended it.
why'd she lie? She said she hardly knew him.
I'll make the call. Bringing in Lieutenant Summers.
tonight, DiNozzo. - Aye, aye, Cap'n.
there's something else I want to show you. I had nothing else to do, so I started going through Beltway Burns' video archives.
a lot of the facts in the stories he has run are made up.
this is from July 23rd last year.
he was doing a piece on a congressman. - As a result of an exhaustive investigation, yesterday morning, I met in Atlanta with a member of the congressman's staff who told me of the assignation.
that is total salami. - Baloney.
at the time, Burns claimed to be in Atlanta, but his credit card records show that he was in DC, at the Willard Hotel bar having martinis.
Yeah, boss? - Lieutenant Arnett's finances...
well, his brokerage accounts only show transactions from family trusts, and his one bank account has the deposits from his Navy lieutenant's salary and nothing else.
if he had contact with any other financial institution, I can't find it.
you lied.
all right, so you know about Lieutenant Arnett and me.
what else do you want me to say?
who broke it off? - Me!
because he was seeing other women, and I found out.
can I go now? - Sit.
no way, honey bunny. He's not through with you.
she knows more than she's telling. - I agree with you.
so what do you think? the style?
he's leading with the Creepy Uncle, but I think he's gonna go with the Father Figure You Can Trust.
no, that doesn't feel right.
I am gonna go with the classic In Your Face Gibbs, The Intimidator.
I don't think so.
you should know that we're working very closely with Metro Police.
they have given us complete access to their files and anything that they have on Matt Burns.
the old You Lie to Me, I Lie To You.
didn't see that coming. I like it.
we found notes in Burns' office with your name on 'em.
are you his Pentagon source?
and now our little bunny rabbit doesn't know what to say.
he swore no one would ever find out.
Yeah, well, he lied.
why'd you go to Matt Burns?
I was hurt. Rod had dumped me.
wasn't returning my phone calls...
Arnett was trading on insider information?
I think so.
you "think"?
I re... I remember.
the day after the press release of the McAllister Industries contract,
rod came over with champagne.
and when I asked what was going on, he said that he had...
he had made a lot of money in the stock market.
I could read between the lines.
she just connected the two cases.
Arnett's death is looking less like an accident.
maybe Burns was onto something.
which means we blew the investigation.
I reviewed Lieutenant Arnett's autopsy as if I were an objective outsider.
first the photographs, then the X-rays;
I brought in a radiological consultant and had Abby redo the blood and tox tests.
what's more--- Duck, bottom line?
certainly.
lieutenant Arnett's death was accidental.
multiple traumas sustained in a car accident.
Oh, I think you're gonna want me to take this.
it's my counterpart, Tom Hubbard-- the District M. E.-- returning my call.
Hello, Tom. Well I'm in the middle of an autopsy.
I have to say that or he'll talk my ears off.
what's that?
metropolitan Police...
have classified Burns' death as a homicide?
Oh, thanks, I owe you one-- no, no, no, no, no, no, old boy, my lips are sealed.
you ever lie like that to me, Duck? - Never.
if the cases are connected, does that infer that Arnett was also murdered?
we got our hands full. Anything else you can do?
well, if I'd retained Arnett's brain, I could perform further toxicology tests.
why didn't you?
well, at the time, it wasn't warranted. It was a car accident.
look, for the tests, the tissue has to be prepared. It takes ten days.
the Arnett family was putting pressure on the Director.
they wanted the body for burial, and they wanted it intact.
unbury it. - Jethro...
Ducky, we need it now.
get the Director involved. Use the full extent of his office to get the consent of the family.
how you doing? Special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo.
sit down. - Thank you.
benjamin Franklin, Securities and Exchange Commission.
I know, I don't look like an SEC investigator.
is that really your name? - Yes.
and I've heard every imaginable joke, so spare me.
now, we've been receiving the same kind of heat you guys have since Beltway Burns broke the story.
I headed the investigation of Arnett.
if he was inside trading, we couldn't find any evidence of it.
how's it usually works?
well, when a company is awarded a multibillion-dollar defense contract, its stock spikes.
if anyone has advance knowledge, like Arnett did, they'd purchase an OTM;
that's an "out of the money" call.
that's taking a bet that the stock will rise, and it only costs pennies on a share.
a penny saved is a penny earned.
Yes. Now, we checked out all the defense contracts released by CUINFO in the past 12 months that Arnett was in the office.
there was only one OTM that showed any substantial profit.
you got a name? - Yes.
nice bifocals, Ben.
an individual named Will Sutton.
now, ma $million on McAllister Industries stock.
what do we know about him, Ben?
doesn't make any sense.
he owns a small sandwich shop in the Adams Morgan district.
we've had the guy under a microscope, but we can't find a connection between him, Arnett, the Navy or any other source of inside information.
Yeah. Gibbs. - Gibbs, I need you to come down here
okay, Abbs, slow down. I'll be right there.
get the information on Sutton.
Oh, dear.
I only take orders from one person: Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
unless he asks me to do it, it doesn't get done.
I think that's gonna change, honey.
Gibbs make this awful man go away!
what do you want, Sportelli?
all the physical evidence from the Arnett investigation, including the car.
we're denied access to your investigation, and you get all the evidence in ours?
since I have a court order... yes.
give it to him, Abbs.
you're gonna have to sign the chain-of-evidence, honey.
you know what? I'll take that.
I hope you can look your boss in the eye and tell him you didn't blow this investigation.
Hanley? - Coming. Here you go.
I can understand the SEC asking me questions. Why the Navy?
we're looking into the death of a Navy officer, Mr. Sutton.
what's that gotta do with me?
you made a killing on McAllister Industries' stock right after they were awarded a multibillion - dollar defense contract and the officer whose death we're investigating may have been involved in insider trading, so...
I get lucky on one legitimate investment, and everybody's all over me.
you know, if I lost money, nobody would give a damn.
I got a box full of losing lottery tickets-- would you like to take a look at it?
no. So you've never met or heard of Lieutenant Rod Arnett?
Nope. - Let me ask you a question.
if you made two million bucks in the market, what are you doing making sandwiches?
cause the SEC froze my funds until after they finish their investigation.
they haven't found anything; they never will.
I tell you, I catch one lucky break, it turns into a nightmare.
I've had to hire a lawyer-- the guy's costing me a fortune.
he's gonna see more money on this than I will.
that pastrami looks great.
you know how many connections I have found between Arnett and Sutton?
zero.
I've checked everything. I have checked e-mails, I have checked phone records...
is that pastrami?
can I have a bite?
this is my dinner. You can have the pickle.
I don't like pickles. - I know.
these two guys couldn't be more different.
one was a rich kid, the other dropped out of high school to support his invalid mother.
he makes a mean sandwich.
we got Arnett.
academy graduate, single playboy, jock, part of the DC social scene.
now, you've got Sutton: Married 15 years, three kids, two mortgages.
can't afford to live in the city, so he takes the train each day-- an hour.
come on, man, you know I didn't have lunch today.
these two live 60 miles apart.
there is no discernable way they have met or have anything in common.
I hope you choke on that.
you know, disinterment is considered a sacrilege or taboo by certain cultures, especially the ones who bury their dead.
Gibbs thinks this is a necessary exception.
in Southern China, for example, graves are opened after a period of one year.
the bones are removed, cleaned, dried, and put in a ceramic pot for re-burial.
the process is called Jiangu.
exhumations are... disturbing.
they are.
fortunately, Lieutenant Arnett has only been buried for two weeks.
who would want to steal Arnett's body?
I don't know but thank God Matt Burns isn't around to put it in his blog.
someone else'll fill the void.
this is really gonna give the conspiracy theorists a reason to believe we're covering up a murder.
it's gonna get worse after I tell Sportelli.
do you have to?
duck, when was the last time you saw Arnett's body?
the day after I did the autopsy.
we released it to the...
heavenly Glen Funeral Home in Falls Church.
they picked it up.
DiNozzo. McGee. - On it, boss.
boss, I'm scheduled to retake that polygraph at 9: 00 a. m.
I'll handle it. - Thanks.
treat this like a crime scene, Abbs. - Right.
I'm looking for Special Agent Timothy McGee.
he is out of the building on assignment.
tell him Agent Grady from Polygraph wants to see him.
he missed his scheduled appointment this morning.
I will make sure he gets the message.
we picked up Lieutenant Arnett's remains from NCIS at 11: 20 on the sixth of last month.
he was brought directly here, where our mortician did a reconstruction of the deceased's face, which...was severely damaged in the accident.
we know. We worked the scene.
well, that evening, Arnett's immediate family had a viewing.
I thought our mortician did a wonderful job.
but they decided to have the casket closed for the funeral.
it was sealed at 10: 00 p. m.
the mortuary closed at 11: 00 and did not open until 7: 00 the next morning.
how was the casket delivered to Arlington?
in our hearse-- first to the chapel, then to the graveside service.
any idea how the body could have been removed? - None.
who else has keys to the building?
myself, my brother, who is also my partner in the business, and... our mortician.
no one else?
uh, is there a security system?
of course. Excuse me for a second.
gunmetal metal. Nice.
the polygraph examiner's looking for me.
Ouch. I guess Gibbs forgot. He's got a lot on his mind.
Hey, come over here for a second.
come here. I got an idea.
what? - Hop in.
what are you talking about? - Just do it.
why would I do that?
I take your picture, we send it to Polygraph, they think you're dead, you don't have to retake the test.
Tony, that is not funny.
they already think you're ducking them. It's only gonna get worse.
I had totally forgotten about this, but early on the morning of the seventh, the security alarm went off.
I was notified at home and met the patrol here.
this is their report.
we searched the entire building but found nothing missing.
dismissed the incident as a faulty alarm.
went off at 2: 10 a. m. Security arrived on site at 2: 30 a. m.
there's a 20-minute window where someone could have removed Arnett's body.
this coffin looks expensive.
it is. It's top of the line.
but it's... it's new. You know, factory-made. It has no personality.
mine, on the other hand, is like a Stradivarius hand-crafted by a Bavarian artisan circa 1870.
it never made sense to me to spend a fortune on something that's gonna be viewed for a couple of hours and then stuck in the ground to rot.
mine has and will continue to provide me with hours of restful sleep and pleasure.
did you find anything? Prints? DNA?
nada. In fact, all four plates were meticulously cleaned with acetate.
how strange.
why would someone take such precautions if the coffin was gonna be buried for all eternity?
Ducky, this is cosmic.
two minds, one thought-- that is exactly what Gibbs said when I told him.
burns pushed for the Arnett case to remain open by saying we made a mistake.
he knew we would eventually be forced to exhume Arnett's body to prove his death was accidental.
and when it was found missing, his blog site would explode.
and Burns would become a celebrity, a regular on Anderson Cooper.
and after that, Burns could say anything he wanted to about Arnett.
dead man cannot defend himself. - You think Burns stole the body.
that is what makes the most sense.
I like it-- how do we prove it?
boss, I got an idea.
but I need to get a look at Burns's car in police impound.
like Sportelli's gonna let us do that.
there it is.
well, I could take care of the video surveillance-- it's the canine patrol I'm worried about.
Oh, chillax, bro.
all these budget cuts and economic problems, they can't afford dogs. Trust me.
are you sure that thing's gonna work? - Yeah.
it's my own personal concoction of oatmeal, mayonnaise, carpenter's glue.
perfectly simulates bird droppings.
us grown-ups use a different word for it.
used it very successfully in the Chesapeake team paintball finals last summer.
paintball? Cool.
all right, so that's the camera you want to hit with your bird poop, McSniper.
nice shot. I'm impressed.
all right, let's go.
what's the matter?
you sure there's no dogs in here?
I don't see any dogs. I don't hear any dogs.
so, no-- there are no dogs! Come on.
do your thing.
all right. - Sure, you're gonna fit in there?
there you go. Nice. That's like a yoga position.
this up here. - That's like a... upside-down manatee.
Yeah.
all right.
all right... Doin' it...
put this up here... All right, baby, come on.
this'd be a lot easier if I could pull the nav system and look at it in Abby's lab.
been a lot easier if Sportelli had just given us the car.
well... Okay. Downloading.
that sounds like a dog.
Oh, you're such an easy mark. - You're such a child.
all right, we got it.
get my tools... - Dogs, McGee. Dogs!
Yeah, right. - Real dogs! Get out of here, McGee!
big dogs! Big dogs!
you said there weren't any dogs!
come on! Oh, God! McGee!
get to high ground!
Heel! Heel!
it's like Turner and Hooch!
or K-9 with Jim Belushi!
run away, McGee!
Oh, God! - No, no, no...
down! Stay! - Come on, Tim!
I don't have the right shoes for this!
over here! Come to the fence!
come on! Come on!
Tony! - There you go! Come on up!
got it.
Freeze! Release!
Release! - So close.
I sent it to Abby.
well done.
Where'd you get those? - Off links.
poor little Timmy-- he looks so scared.
why aren't you downtown trying to bail them out?
I don't trust Sportelli. - They'll be fine, Abb.
they're probably crammed in some cell where they're being tormented by-by perverts, and-and addicts and murderers
did you analyze the data from Burns's car?
I did. It proves what Ziva suspected.
burns was parked outside the mortuary from 2: 05 a. m. until 2: 19 a. m.
Tony and McGee risked their lives trying to get this information and you're just going to let them rot in a jail cell?
where did Burns go after the mortuary?
Seneca Creek Park in Maryland.
thank you.
you're out! Did you know?
director handled it. Way above my pay grade.
don't get too comfortable, boys. We got a search team to organize.
I just got a call from Tony.
after searching all afternoon, they found Arnett's body.
great.
that's all you have to say? Your theory was right.
burns stole the body.
I would be doing cartwheels right now.
let's go celebrate. Let's get something to eat.
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.
my friend's band is playing at the Filibuster tonight in Georgetown.
come on. Girls' night out. It'll be fun.
I have something I have to do, Abby.
okay.
see ya.
I'm sorry I, uh, I missed our appointment yesterday.
I came in early just for you.
Thanks. I've been, um... on a... on a case, under pressure.
you got me in trouble. I'm a creature of habit
I take the same train every day and the regulars gave me a hard time this morning.
they were worried when they didn't see me yesterday.
I need to make an adjustment.
that got your blood pressure up.
all right. Um, let's begin.
I'm going to ask several questions.
some will be for control purposes and appear irrelevant.
uh, please answer all questions with a simple yes or no.
Yes, ma'am.
is your name Timothy McGee? - Yes.
were you born in Bethesda, Maryland? - Yes.
have you ever been arrested? - No.
uh, yes. Yesterday. It was on the case.
the Director... - Yes or no?
sorry. uh, yes.
do you live alone? - Yes.
are you in a committed relationship?
uh, no.
okay.
have you ever used-- - Hold on a second.
what?
you said that you take the same train every morning?
uh, you don't get to ask the questions.
you ride with the same people? - Yes.
what are you doing? Why-Why-Why are you taking...
um, you can't... Um, excuse me. We're in the middle of an exam.
I gotta reschedule.
so, the fibers on the uniform Arnett was buried in are consistent with the trunk-liner carpeting of the make and model of Burns' sedan.
now, if I could get a look at the actual car.
Abbs, I need to see the inventory of Arnett's personal effects. Hey, boss.
got to know if he had a rail pass. - Yes.
did you record the serial number?
all right.
Hey, McGee.
boss, we know that Lieutenant Arnett had inside information on McAllister Industries' stocks;
we also know that Will Sutton made $2 million the day after the contract was announced.
the SEC tried to connect both men, but they couldn't.
what if they took the same train to work every day?
thought they didn't live anywhere near each other. - They don't.
Sutton drives to the Shady Grove station every morning to take the Red Line into the city to his sandwich shop.
it's a 55-minute ride.
now, Arnett commutes to the Pentagon by train. Gets on the Red Line at Bethesda.
if they were regulars on the same train, they rode to work together every morning.
okay. I accessed the Metrorail data bank and I entered Arnett's rail pass number.
he boarded the Red Line at Bethesda at 7: 20 every morning.
we need to get a look at Will Sutton's rail pass.
you brought a friend. Must have liked the Pastrami.
it was delicious. He's not my friend.
you take the Metrorail to the city through Shady Grove, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. We need to see your rail pass.
Why? - You a Hitchcock fan?
you ever see the 1951 classic, Strangers on a Train?
they meet in a club car, plot to exchange murders.
you kill my father, I'll kill your wife.
they believed that no one be able to connect them to each other.
you and Arnett were regulars on the same train.
got friendly; you came up with the insider-trading scam.
you knew if the SEC investigated, they would never be able to connect you to each other.
after a respectable amount of time, you'd split the $2 million profit.
but you got lucky.
your partner died in a car accident and you got to keep all the money to yourself.
you guys got quite an imagination.
how about you let us see your rail pass?
how about I call my lawyer?
innocent guys always say that.
your mistake was believing Matt Burns' blog.
he was bluffing. He only had a tip on Arnett. He made the rest up.
but you bought it; you panicked; you thought Burns was on to you.
anonymously contacted him, said you had information, arranged to meet at the bridge.
they're making all this up. - Yeah?
our good friends at Metro PD are working very closely with us.
we've connected you to Arnett.
once we give them your name, they're going to connect you to Burns.
they're going to backtrack every communication you ever had: e-mails, phone calls, the lot.
we wrapped the case for you, Dan; show some appreciation.
I don't like the conditions. - Come on.
we're handing over the guy who murdered Burns.
least you could do is drop the charges against my team.
if this case doesn't hold up, deal's off.
you got it.
take him.
Hey, Hanley. I'll escort you down.
nice sweater. Where'd you get that? Stripes are nice.
boss... I better go down and reschedule this polygraph test.
don't bother, McGee. Nothing wrong with the first one.
what do you mean?
I think you made an impression on the examiner.
I think she made an excuse to see you again.
you want me to draw you a picture?
no. I'm going to handle her, boss.
being stuck at that desk has given me a lot of time to think.
being a visitor here is wrong.
what does that mean, Ziva?
I need your signature on this.
I want to be an NCIS agent.
I don't even know if that's possible.
you would have to resign from Mossad.
already have. Sent my father an e-mail.
what's he think about that?
does not matter.
Yeah.
if this goes any further tonight, we're going to have to go back to your place.
at least, when my mom passes, I inherit the house.
good to know.
Becky told me that you don't say much.
don't worry.
that's a quality I value in a woman.
would you excuse me?
I'm gonna freshen up.
sure. I'll be right here.
again.
you got it.
rough night?
blind date.
on a boat.
nowhere to go.
overboard.
should I call the coast guard?
no need.
I am the coast guard.
CGIS Special Agent Abigail Borin.
first Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.
agent Borin, if your date continues to get worse, will I see you back here?
safe bet.
good.
there you are.
thought I lost ya.
no chance of that.
what was that?!
get down!
2: 00 a. m. on a Friday night.
in a parallel universe, the Tony DiNozzo that didn't become a cop is walking out of a bar with a beautiful lady he doesn't know the name of ...yet.
how romantic.
as romantic as your... Cuban Casanova?
he's not Cuban.
must be tough.
make time for each other.
you're stuck here, finishing case reports, and he's frolicking in the Miami sun.
he travels... a lot.
which is why I'm using comp time to take three days off next week to go see him.
you can't do that.
why not? We're adults.
no, not that.
you can't use comp time for days off.
according to the OPM guidelines, I can.
Tony, how long have you been a senior field agent?
I just never thought there was anything very useful in those things.
even though NCIS employees "are salaried, any scheduled overtime hours "must be compensated monetarily or with... time off.
Yeah, I was actually told that they prefer us to take the time off.
well, no one told me!
they just send me the money.
then what are you complaining about?
I don't need more money.
I need more time.
just think of all the women I could've dated.
I would rather not.
respectfully dated.
but it's never too late.
what are you doing?!
tallying up my overtime.
Aw, you got more coming, Skippy.
grab your gear.
got another all-nighter?
you can sleep when you're dead.
I need this area kept clear of passengers, even if they claim to be my date.
agent Gibbs.
agent Borin.
we gotta stop meeting like this.
you mean when NCIS takes over one of my cases.
my call was a courtesy, not an invitation.
body trumps boat.
that's a nice dress.
are you cold?
tried to give him CPR. and no
the, uh, gift shop was all out of pantsuits.
unless you'd rather just go home.
and let you have all the fun?
don't think you're getting rid of me that easily, Gibbs.
I didn't.
not only was I on the boat at the time of the murder,
I was the last person to see the victim alive, so I'm here for the long haul.
glad to have you onboard.
our victim is Marine Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.
he was having dinner with his sister and uncle.
metro PD's got them up on the deck, along with the rest of the passengers.
you got a murder weapon?
it's likely at the bottom of the river.
but none of the passengers have been allowed to disembark.
which means that our killer could still be onboard.
navy looks good on you, Borin.
ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.
if I could have your attention.
thank you.
I know it's been a long night.
consider it your murder mystery dinner theater on the Potomac.
it was dinner. Now it's breakfast.
well, looks like Colonel Mustard was killed on the deck with a lead pipe, maybe lead bullets, and...
only by interrogating each and every one of you individually... "can we hope to see the light.
it's Albert Finney, doing, uh, Hercule Poirot - 1974's Murder on the Orient Express.
well, the murderer very well could be with us now, so, excuse me - can I please have you all take your seats;
we will get to you one by one.
thank you.
Jeremy just got back from Afghanistan.
this was meant to be a celebration to welcome him home.
Kimberly and I are Jeremy's only family.
and you're Lieutenant Nolan's uncle.
Yes. Wayne Grossman.
look, we already told all this to Metro Police.
it's just Jeremy survived 18 months overseas, only to be gunned down four days after he came home.
kimberly, were you with your brother the entire night?
Yes.
until he went to get a drink from the bar.
Oh, no.
the paparazzi already know about Jeremy.
they're outside the marina now.
Paparazzi?!
for a Marine lieutenant?
and me.
you didn't recognize our last name?
Oh, you're the Kimberly Nolan.
the Kimberly Nolan.
looks like he tried to crawl out of the line of fire.
well, it's too little, too late.
damage was already done.
well, he seemed like a nice guy.
guess it's true what they say - all the good ones are taken.
or dead.
well, that's what I meant, you know - taken.
he's not really my type, anyway.
what, rich and famous?
well, that never hurts. Why?
because the lieutenant was both.
Jeremy Nolan is the only son of the late Jack Nolan.
didn't know he was one of those Nolans.
BORIN: The family's worth millions.
and yet, our victim walked away from the family business to become a Marine.
guess he was one of the good ones.
McGee. You awake?
I'm sorry, boss. Yes. Never quite get used to these extra hours.
I don't know how you and Agent Borin stay so, uh...
peppy?
no, no, no. Uh, it's just that... you two have a lot in common.
like what?
coffee?
did you bring cream and sugar?
no. Stopped off at the office. Got some info on our dead Marine.
Yuck.
now, boss, victim is Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.
he was commissioned three years ago.
Nolan was being groomed to take over the family business.
kid chose the battlefield over the boardroom.
it's a choice his father took personally.
apparently, the two never spoke again.
his father cut him out of the will and his family fortune.
hell of a way to thank him for serving his country.
Jack Nolan died six months ago, from a heart attack.
he started the company in his backyard.
now Nolan Radar Systems is one of the country's biggest aviation suppliers, which makes them a very wealthy, very well-known family.
Yeah, then the sister went viral.
What'd she have?
uh, not "sick" viral, Internet viral.
Yeah. Leaked sex tape spread across the Internet.
do you want to see it?
no. - No.
enemies? - None.
Nolan outworked every lieutenant in his battalion; guy stacked up citations like it was cordwood.
probably trying to prove that he deserved to be there.
somebody wanted him dead.
dinner boat.
Yes, boss.
ran backgrounds on all of the passengers.
no connections to our victim or this family.
nice work, McGee.
Tony and Ziva are interviewing the last of them now.
it's Steve.
she hasn't mentioned me?
we were really hitting it off.
you and Agent Borin?
Oh, yeah.
is it all right if I hit the head now?
agent Borin's a lucky lady.
don't worry, Ziva, you'll find your Mehlman.
if you do, run.
I've been avoiding him since last night.
anything from the interviews?
there was no sign of the murder weapon anywhere onboard, and, uh, no positive GSR tests.
so our shooter wore gloves and changed clothes. Witnesses?
no one saw what happened on deck.
any good news?
Yeah.
but if you get anything else...
duck, call.
what the hell am I doing here? I told you I didn't kill anyone.
well, you are a waiter on the boat, Doug.
we got witnesses saying that, uh... you guys almost came to blows.
what happened, you take away his plate prematurely?
maybe he was planning on finishing that salmon paste.
don't talk down to me, man.
an ex-Marine like yourself should be used to that.
no such thing as an ex-Marine.
I beg to differ, Doug.
cause you got served the big chicken dinner, didn't ya?
bad-conduct discharge.
that's not good.
what did you do?
Oh, no!
striking a superior officer?
that's a numbskull move, Doug.
what was he like? I bet he talked down to you a lot.
doesn't mean I killed anyone.
I guess not.
but you do own a nine-millimeter, don't ya?
and you got a bad temper.
Nine-millimeter- that's the same caliber as the murder weapon.
Marines who actually complete a tour of duty, Doug, they get awfully thirsty - the desert and stuff.
what happened, did you forget to refill Lieutenant Nolan's water glass?
stop talking to me like that!
stop lying to me like that.
so I recognized the rich son of a bitch, and I called him out on being a glory hound.
that a crime?
he gave up a pretty cushy life to go and join the Marines, you know that?
we all give something up.
thousands of Marines deploy every year and put their lives on the line.
the hell makes him any different?
so you killed Lieutenant Nolan to prove what?
I told him his joining up was a stunt.
but I walked away.
out on deck.
I was on the opposite side of the boat.
I heard shots... but I didn't see anything.
say, listen, you don't mind if I run ballistics on your nine-millimeter, do you?
I didn't kill Nolan!
well, somebody on the boat did.
you're our prime suspect.
congratulations, Doug!
I hope he left you a big tip.
agent Abby! Welcome back.
here... my condolences.
sympathy card.
my condolences on the loss of Sonny Lee, the mascot for the Coast Guard station at Norfolk?
the cocker spaniel that died two weeks ago?
right. Thanks.
how did you even hear about that?
Oh, I'm on an e-mail list for military service animals.
Gibbs, did you know that the Coast Guard has a long tradition of having an animal mascot on the ship with them?
and the mascots are so beloved that they're enlisted.
they have their own service and medical records, sometimes even their own bunk.
it's cool, huh?
how come NCIS doesn't have a mascot?
we do, Abb.
you.
okay... So...
I have been trying to recreate the shooting on the boat deck.
using the information from Ducky, I built a 3-D model of our victim, with corresponding bullet trajectories.
Mm-hmm, and?
and... it makes no sense.
I can't figure out where the shooter was standing.
the angle of the bullets is too severe to allow the shots to come from more than 20 feet away.
there wasn't enough room on the boat deck.
right.
no matter how I line this up, there's no place on that boat that can explain the angle and the distance of the bullets' trajectory.
killer wasn't on the boat.
but using this trajectory, the shots would've had to come from the water itself.
the surface of the water.
our shooter wasn't on the dinner boat.
he was on a second boat.
you need something, Agent Borin?
coffee?
nutter Butter?
aspirin?
there's only one thing giving me a headache, McGee.
and I deserve it.
what's that?
the fact that I can't remember seeing a second boat last night.
I'm a trained CGIS investigator.
well, you were attending to a dying Marine.
never make excuses" is rule number one.
you should write that down.
I would, but rule number one's already been taken. Twice.
so who are these people?
friends?
Oh, I don't think he has any friends.
maybe Mike Franks or Fornell, but... - Butt out, McGee.
butt off my desk, Borin.
talked to the captain of the dinner boat.
he doesn't remember seeing any other craft in the area at the time of the shooting.
so, if our shooter was on a second boat, how would they know that Jeremy Nolan was going to be on deck at that exact time?
could have been at the wrong place at the wrong time.
you think maybe Nolan wasn't the target?
well, let's find the other boat and find out.
boss, got something here.
not about our mystery boat, but about our victim.
lieutenant Jeremy Nolan just showed up in the Metro Police system on an assault charge.
who assaulted him?
no one.
the charge was against Jeremy Nolan. It was filed three days ago.
so, just after he got back from Afghanistan.
according to the report, charges were dropped the next day.
well, that's fast.
who was the attorney?
the uncle - Wayne Grossman, lead counsel for Nolan Radar Systems.
I guess our Marine hadn't completed severed all ties with his family business or their influence.
send Tony. Send Ziva.
wonder how the private sector's benefit package compares to ours?
can we discuss your package another time, Tony?
Ah, Mr. Adams. Special Agents DiNozzo, David; NCIS.
please, sit down.
pretty fancy.
looks like business is booming.
it is.
it's hard to believe a company this big is still owned and operated by the Nolan family.
so, you're not a part of the family?
no, but... you might say adopted.
I started out in the warehouse when I was 15.
Mr. Nolan sort of took me under his wing.
and now you're the president?
CFO. I run the business side for the family.
kimberly, Jeremy's sister, is on the board, but it's more of a ceremonial position.
and Jeremy?
Jeremy wanted to serve his country.
joined the Marines a few years ago.
good kid - I'd do anything for him.
including dealing with his assault charge?
no. That would be my purview.
Hello, Mr. Grossman. - Sorry I'm late.
so what happened?
while Jeremy was in Afghanistan, a man named Devin Lodge started dating Kimberly.
lodge is a spoiled little punk.
Devin Lodge and Jeremy attended Princeton together.
they never liked each other very much. Not even back then.
why is that?
because the guy's a bully and Jeremy's the only one who ever s...
lodge slapped Kimberly around.
tabloid published some photos.
when Jeremy got home last week...
Jeremy had a little... chat with Devin.
a chat?
he threw a single punch.
the charges have been dropped.
do you think Lodge retaliated by killing Jeremy?
well, you'd have to talk to him about that.
agent Borin and I are going through all the photos that were taken with the confiscated cameras from the dinner boat cruise.
people take a lot of pictures of their food.
hoping to catch something on film.
and we did. There was an engagement party right next to a row of windows.
since everybody's got a camera-phone now, we got a photo taken right before Nolan was shot.
we can see out the window.
Yep.
that's how we found our mystery boat. Or part of it.
enough to identify the make and model.
she didn't even have to use a computer, Gibbs.
it was the fishing tower of a 20-foot TidalNav- a very fast sports fishing boat.
and popular. I already have my office pulling all TidalNav registrations in the DC area.
Abbs-es... that is good work.
hold on.
how did you two get in here?
we used these.
we're looking for Devin Lodge.
and don't say he's not here, or we'll have to card everybody.
back table. By the restroom.
thank you, sir. Thank you.
I don't want to talk about it.
well, I do, okay? - Let go, let go of me! It hurts!
stop being a bitch. Stop.
come on! Get off, ow!
that is not a nice word.
who the hell are you?
kimberly, want someone to help you out of here?
no, thank you. I'm fine.
ladies, could you give us a second?
I need a moment alone. With you.
do you have any idea who I am?
well, that is a penetrating philosophical question, Devin.
didn't take you for a thinker.
Yeah, well, is that your job here - the Thinker?
do you own a boat like this one?
like that?
no.
but a fabulously wealthy guy like you could get his hands on pretty much anything, right?
where were you last night at 12: 30?
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this about, uh, Jeremy's murder?
Hey, come on.
he did punch that pretty little puss of yours.
Yeah, well, the jarhead had a bad temper, all right?
heard the same thing about you.
well, I guess you heard that we hated each other.
Oh, okay.
and that he hated the fact that I was dating his sister even more.
I didn't kill the guy, all right?
so why don't you two leave, before I get my very expensive lawyers involved?
you get anyone you want involved.
I'm going to ask you one more time: Where were you last night at 12: 30?
buddy, I'm Devin Lodge.
you want an alibi for last night?
do your jobs.
go outside, find out from one of the camera monkeys where I was.
they follow me 24/7.
boss, uh, Coast Guard sent over all the registrations for the TidalNav boats in the area, all 394 of them.
start running 'em, Tim.
DiNozzo. - Checking into the paparazzi, boss.
for being everywhere, they're surprisingly difficult to track down.
kind of like termites or roaches.
find one with film on Devin Lodge.
Gibbs! I found something!
you okay?
Yeah. Ouch.
uh, blood. - Are you bleeding?
no. No, no. There's a blood anomaly from the crime scene.
okay, blood results.
on the left, this is from our victim, Lieutenant Nolan.
and the second one? - No idea.
turns out the swab used at the crime scene, it mixed two blood samples, contaminating them.
I didn't know, at first, until I started getting too many restrictive fragment length polymorphisms...
english, Abbs.
there was a second person wounded on the deck when Nolan was shot.
a second victim? - Maybe.
how long until you I. D. the second blood source?
well, it's tricky, you know? The traces were small, and the blood samples were commingled.
Abbs, go, get started.
I knew you were gonna say that.
where?
Thanks.
coast Guard patrol boat just pulled another body out of the Potomac.
I hope it's the body we're looking for.
swabbing for gunshot residue, Dr. Mallard?
Yes.
and the other Abby will let me have the result.
how long do you think he was in the water?
Oh, it's difficult to determine.
the tarp in which he was wrapped was nearly watertight.
the water was about 40 degrees.
he was basically refrigerated.
but if I had to approximate, I'd say this man was killed shortly after our lieutenant was shot on the dinner boat.
cause of death?
the bullet that I took from his brain is a good candidate.
that looks like a . 22.
bullet, back of the head, close range.
execution.
after he was shot, the killer wrapped his body in a plastic tarp and then weighed it down with barbell plates.
it didn't sink.
Yeah, well, the wrapping was nicely done, but the bow slipped.
body popped up, drifted downstream before it was fished out.
you got anything else, Doc?
when I was removing his clothing, I found these in one of his pockets.
nine mills.
I believe the expression is "policing one's brass.
that's the same caliber used to kill Lieutenant Nolan.
but tarp man here was shot with a . 22. So...
you thinking what I'm thinking?
I think tarp man was a pro, hired to kill Nolan, and that he got a bullet instead of a bonus.
that's crazy.
did you catch that in your sleep?
do you use sonar?
that is why it's called a "bat nap.
see? Completely refreshed.
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, cheer up, McDrowsy. Think of all the sweet overtime we're accruing.
at this rate, we might, uh, get to retire early.
I can arrange that, DiNozzo.
got an idea on the floater, boss.
Kyle Dansby, 34, hails from Wheeling, West Virginia.
Dansby has a rap sheet dating back to 2000, assault and battery, and the FBI has investigated him twice for possible murder-for-hire jobs.
he was their prime suspect.
well, I guess they don't have to worry about that now.
McGee? - Yeah.
Potomac. Body. - Yes, sir.
uh... well, based on where Dansby's body was found, we should be able to...
trace it back to where he was dumped.
I-I got this one, McGee.
okay, a patrol boat recovered Dansby's body here - the inlet at Potomac River Waterfront Park.
uh, the river runs towards the Chesapeake at a rate of two miles an hour, would have hit incoming tidal flow - uh, McGee, can you zoom in, please?
thank you.
now, the body would have stayed along the bank, means it had to have been dumped here - National Harbor.
McGee, you're up.
cross-referencing National Harbor with our list of TidalNavs.
well, we have three in that vicinity.
well, you're not gonna believe who one of them's registered to.
make me believe, McGee.
it's a holding company which is owned by Devin Lodge's family.
go back there. Get him.
according to his latest Twitter update, he is "still crunk at da club.
may be code for something.
Yeah. Hedonism.
knock, knock.
Oh, really?
are we gonna have a problem?
looks like it, Gossip Guy.
you look cute, doll.
the paparazzi's gonna love this.
how do I look, Ziva?
all right... ask your dumb questions.
go ahead, while you two still have a job.
we can't ask you any questions until you sober up.
Oh, I'm waiving my rights.
Yeah. Ask me anything you want.
I got nothing to hide - but I would love to see what you are hiding under that jacket, princess.
what is this, like, reverse Darwinism?
you rich guys,'cause you don't have to hunt or gather, your brain atrophies?
out of my way, jackass. You know, you're blocking my view.
excuse me.
so... what are you doing next week?
testifying at your preliminary hearing.
Oh, that doesn't sound fun.
true or false: you hired this guy to kill Nolan and then you shot him so that, uh, he couldn't talk.
gross. False.
come on, you guys can't be serious.
we did not find anyone to confirm your alibi.
in fact... you seem to have slipped under the paparazzi's radar for four hours during the night of the murder.
Where'd you go?
me? I,you know, I don't know. I don't remember.
got a bit of a problem.
there's a reason we couldn't find paparazzi footage of Devin Lodge from the night of the murder.
it's because the one guy that had it just sold it for $50, 000 to ZMZ Celebrity News.
Oh, she looks familiar.
that's 'cause she's Senator Baxley's 17-year-old daughter.
what does this prove?
the paparazzi guy that took this footage followed Lodge, then waited for them outside...
for four hours.
he's got an alibi for both murders.
whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought you just said I had an alibi.
why are you arresting me?
for having sex with a minor.
Ooh, she... told me she was 18?
that's what Fatty Arbuckle said.
Thanks, Tony. - Anytime.
no time like now. Let's go. What do we got?
time-stamp on Devin Lodge's paparazzi footage is too legit to quit, boss.
he did not shoot our dead hit man.
and we checked his phone, text and banking records - doesn't look like he hired Dansby either.
Yeah, it is unfortunate, but, uh, we got nada.
well, somebody get something!
boss, I got something.
my guys never do that.
get yourself some new guys.
probate closed at midnight on Jack Nolan's estate.
guess who just became the world's wealthiest Marine.
posthumously.
lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.
Yep, according to court records, the father changed his will just prior to his death.
guess Dad had a change of heart.
so now a dead guy owns the entire company.
not exactly. According to filings with the Registry of Commerce,
Jeremy Nolan was about to convert the entire company from a private corporation into a charitable foundation.
wonder who stood to lose if that happened.
is this a record?
no. We don't talk about the record.
it got ugly.
okay, here we go.
Nolan Radar Systems' in-house counsel, Wayne Grossman.
guess who he once defended?
Anyone?-Anyone?
Abbs, hit the key.
drum roll.
family lawyer defended our hit man?
Yep.
when he was just out of law school, and Dansby had just started getting into trouble.
that's thin.
I agree, but as his former lawyer, Grossman would have intimate knowledge about Dansby.
and who better to call if you want someone whacked, than a whacker?
circumstantial. - What else you got, Abb?
um, I have a print lifted off the boat Tarp Man used to shoot Nolan.
you can put Adams on the exact boat that was used for the murder?
Yeah, him and a slew of other friends and business associates.
Adams had been on that boat before?
many times. Those rich families - they all socialize together.
so Adams' prints on the boat means... - It means absolutely nothing.
but wait. There's more. And by more, I mean less.
lieutenant Nolan's sister Kimberly- She's out of a $300, 000-a-year job as a board member.
you're right. That's nothing.
what about the blood?
I'm running the last possible test I can to get a pure result, but Gibbs, if the blood is compromised, I won't get a reliable I. D. from the sample.
with no evidence, we're gonna need a confession.
Yeah.
the killer's not gonna confess.
no. - So what are we gonna do?
we're gonna break rule number one.
never make excuses?
never put suspects together.
you think you can get your hands on a key to a TidalNav, Agent Borin?
I do.
it's very late, Agent Gibbs.
I hope this has something to do with catching Jeremy's killer.
Yeah. Me, too.
what is that?
well, I'm glad you asked, Mr. Adams.
you should take a look.
pick it up.
it's a key.
it's a key to the boat that Dansby used to kill Lieutenant Nolan.
fingerprint belongs to you, blood belongs to Dansby.
that's impossible.
I didn't kill him.
key says you did.
where did you find it? - Where did you leave it?
don't say another word. Give me the key.
I'm legal counsel for these people.
you talk to me. You don't talk to them.
okay. Let's start with how you knew Dansby before Jeremy's murder.
how much did he charge you to kill Lieutenant Nolan?
this is absurd. We're leaving.
not yet.
how about you, Kimberly? You're being very quiet over there.
and we just accused these two men of killing your brother.
you have anything... you want to say?
want to have a look?
aren't you warm?
I'm fine. - Really?
that fire makes this room all toasty, and you still got your fur coat on.
I said I'm fine.
Really?
pick it up.
Why?
all right, that's enough.
what's the matter, Kimberly?
you afraid of a little water?
I just lost my brother.
his killer is out there.
you're right.
Oh... God...
I said, st-stop!
you're lucky the bullet only nicked you.
do something.
Jeremy was standing right next to you when he was shot.
you saw the bullet tear into his body.
must have been hard to watch your brother die.
I... I... I didn't want to do it.
they threatened me. They said if I, if I didn't get Jeremy out onto the deck, they were gonna kill me.
please... - Liar.
she's lying. It was all her idea.
but he's the one who arranged the hit man.
you're the one who put a bullet in Dansby's head.
prove it.
family.
fine.
all right.
I can't believe this.
we can't let him get away with it. I don't care if we have to kill him.
he's giving it all away!
I agree, but we'll have to do it before he converts the company.
you really think I was dumb enough not to record every conversation we had in this room?
I want to talk to the prosecutor right now.
Yeah, go ahead.
cut your deal. You know I'm the only one in Jeremy's will.
you're under arrest, all of you.
get up.
what's wrong?
it's 8: 00 in the morning, boss.
Yeah, man. Starting time.
boss, we haven't been to sleep yet.
well, hell, go home.
sleep - it's way, way overrated.
don't you think, Gibbs?
I think you're right.
boss, we got another event... - Slow down, Omagi.
where?
call Choi, and tell her to prep the lab.
I'll meet you there in 30.
dead body on a yacht in Baltimore.
so, same time next year, Gibbs?
we'll see.
thank you.
captain, can I help you?
I'm looking for the person in charge of Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan's murder investigation.
that'd be me - Special Agent Gibbs.
might want to know about this.
could be pertinent to your case.
Jeremy Nolan's will?
Revised... will.
he had me redraft it while we were serving together over in Kandahar.
you're a lawyer?
still have a successful firm in Chicago, sir.
but that doesn't mean I can't still serve my country as a reservist.
no, it doesn't.
Jeremy and I had a lot in common.
got to be good friends.
a good man.
good Marine.
he took his sister out of the will?
Yes.
and he had me draw up articles of corporate conversion turning the company into a nonprofit foundation.
left everything to charity?
I heard about what happened, I thought it might be... motive?
hope you catch his killer, sir.
Yeah. Thanks, Captain.
captain?
we did get him.
captain's sacrifice inspire you to give up your comp time, Tony?
no.
I just realized I have three weeks of comp time coming to me.
I can't take that much time off. - Why not?
because someone else would get temporarily assigned to my desk.
afraid your replacement will outshine you?
no.
but, you know, Bledsoe goes down, and all of a sudden, there's Tom Brady, and he's got Gisele Bndchen.
DiNozzo, the game's never over.
go on.
all of you.
get out of here.
you are one hot dog-walker.
do that again, and I'll kill you.
you love it and you know it.
seriously, it shows up on Facebook, we're done.
Ooh, so serious.
see, even they're annoyed.
Yeah, well, your dog-walking job's cutting into my breakfast time.
Oh, yeah, well, hold on one second. I just need to get Odie first.
hold this.
stay. Hey, boy.
how'd you get out?
Kyle, look. - That's blood.
maybe he's hurt.
Hey, you okay? What happened?
come on, let's follow him.
where is he going? - Come here, boy.
Odie, what is it?
Kyle, what's he doing?
I don't know.
Oh, my God. Mr. Wooten?
it's rude, Tony. I called you four times.
well, there's two things wrong with that statement.
one, we're not dating, and two, you know I don't take calls from anyone, especially you, after 7: 00 p. m.
you forget I have a life.
what's your point?
my point, McGee-Party-of-One, is that you were leaving me messages, evidently, about some kind of case file.
Yeah, one in which I needed you to sign.
which you could have waited until this morning for.
give it to me.
see that?
now all I have to do is sign it.
look at that.
signing John Hancock-- just kidding-- Anthony DiNozzo.
I do not like seeing you two fights.
it's not my fault he's sensitive today.
mariposa Luxuries.
I didn't order anything.
maybe somebody else did.
Timmy's got a secret admirer?
it's real funny, Tony.
you think I did this?
I would not put it past you.
guys come on, a little credit, please.
I have grown past this kind of sophomoric thing.
I mean, who would do something so... genius?
McGee with a plastic girlfriend.
congratulations, Tim. She's very sweet.
the receipt's got my credit card information on it.
there must be some mistake.
I would cancel your credit card.
right now all I need to do is figure out how to deflate this thing.
Oh, that's easy. There's always a button right here on the back of the neck.
there's no reason I should know that.
morning, boss.
this isn't what it looks like, boss.
then what is it, Tim?
um, a joke, I think, a really bad practical joke.
I'm not laughing.
lose your gal pal. Grab your gear.
got a dead marine in Springfield.
this is really awkward.
all right.
we're looking at Marine Sergeant Travis Wooten, - 35 years old, active reservist. - Family?
married with a six-year-old son.
wife's a marine-- Gunnery Sergeant Georgia Wooten. She's 32.
boss, according to the dog-walker, our victim was home with his wife and child last night.
she spoke to the wife just before 11: 00 p. m. to confirm picking up the dog.
does she know where they are now? - Nope.
greetings, everyone. Oh, isn't this a terrible sight?
victim's a marine sergeant, Duck.
pity about the evergreen. I doubt that it will survive such a drubbing.
I guess I'm not the only one who kills plants.
Yeah, back in college, my friends used to call me Black Thumb.
they still do, actually, but now it's 'cause I... I work with dead people.
so not important.
there is definite evidence of blunt force trauma.
some kind of heavy object to the back and sides of the skull.
you got time of death? - Uh... around 1: 00 a. m.
he went with a struggle.
there are wounds on the back and front of his hands.
here's something, Doctor.
looks like part of a twig. - Yeah.
that could be... any of several species in this garden.
Gibbs, I found three plates of food still on the table, and a bathtub full of water.
wife and child left in a hurry. - Or they were forced to leave.
I also found blood.
where? - In the master bedroom.
put out a BOLO. He might not be our only victim.
boss, police are canvassing the National Capitol region, but... so far nothing.
the family contacted? - Nobody's seen them.
I also talked to Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's C. O.
he stated she did not request leave or liberty.
background? - Well, I guess true love's not dead after all.
Travis and Georgia Wooten, they were high school sweethearts.
they joined the Marines in 2000 and got married two years later.
ZIVA: Sergeant Wooten served in Afghanistan, stationed at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province.
disciplinary action? - Nothing-- his service was without incident.
in more ways than one.
the C. O. S called him "proficient yet unremarkable.
maybe that's why he stayed a sergeant and she's a gunny.
well, apparently, the gunny's a real shooting star.
she was promoted to gunnery sergeant after only eight years.
qualified for the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Program.
did several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
awarded both the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement Medals for exemplary service.
that's enough to make any man feel like... less than a man.
marriage problems? - Not that we know of.
but the sergeant may have had some problems of his own.
we're still running, uh, credits cards, cell phones, e-mails, but we do know he recently lost his job at a Virginia auto parts plant, and been boozing it up at, uh, Feeney's Billiards ever since.
McGee's got the bank records.
found multiple charges. One as recently as last night.
Feeney's
that's an hour before his death.
I'll look for the owner.
I love the smell of fresh felt in the morning.
do not know what that means, and I do not think I want to.
uh, it's a little Duvall Apocalypse Now reference, but, never mind, I'm talking about pool tables.
traditionally, they're green. For some reason, these are red.
I did not know you were a pool dolphin, Tony?
pool shark. And yes, I was.
in fact, I was the champion of my Baltimore precinct in the late '90s.
late '90s"?
that makes you... sound so...
what, old? Don't say old.
I didn't say it. You did.
well, I bet Renaissance Ray wouldn't even know his way around a pool table.
you know, Tony, you do not wear jealousy very well.
makes your face look all pinchy. - Pinched.
Oh, I know a bickering couple when I hear one.
Len Feeney, owner and operator.
NCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
this is Probationary Agent Ziva David.
and we are not... a couple.
could've fooled me.
we need to ask you some questions. - Oh, sure. Here.
it's regarding one of your, um... customers... Sergeant Travis Wooten.
sure, I know Travis. One of my regulars. Is everything all right?
not exactly. He's dead.
well, I just saw him last night.
did anything happen out of the ordinary?
well, he came in at his usual time, sat in his usual spot...
practically his second home, huh?
well, it is for a lot of service people.
that's the way I want it. Place to feel comfortable.
I, uh, served in the first Iraq War.
I know the challenges our men and women face when they come home, - and Travis was no different. - Challenges were getting to him?
well, he never let it show.
he was always laughing, cracking jokes ... had a lot of friends around here.
did any of these friends have issues with Sergeant Wooten?
no, Travis' only issue was his lady.
his lady? You mean his wife?
well, as far as I know, he was divorced. He had a girlfriend, though.
she was a real piece of work. Loved to make a scene. Always yelling at him.
and she was here last night. - Clung to him like a wet rag.
Yeah. "Wet rag" have a name? - Oh, yeah, Jancey Gilroy.
Yeah, me and Travis were at the club together.
until what time?
I don't know; about 12: 30 or so. Then I went home and went to bed.
you have anyone that can verify that? - I don't understand.
he kissed me good night and told me he loved me.
said he'd see me later. He was fine. Everything was fine.
not according to the club owner. Said you were volatile together.
so what?
you think I had something to do with this?
I loved Travis. We were going to get married.
except he already was.
no, you're-you're wrong. He got a divorce. I helped him through it.
this is Georgia Wooten, and their six-year-old son, Jacob.
they may be in danger now, too.
I don't know anything about them.
I don't know anything about any of this.
looks painful.
Yeah, well, you try cutting nails all day long and see what happens.
to think William Penn was a pacifist.
was Travis Wooten, Doctor.
not him; those.
Gladwynensis Berberis, otherwise known as William Penn barberry.
Penn, of course, was also a devout Quaker.
Penn as in Pennsylvania Penn?
Yes, Mr. Palmer. Mr. Penn settled that great land... founded a government, and some of his statutes later became the basis of the American Constitution.
I wrote the Constitution, and all I got was this lousy plant.
this lousy plant, as you call it, sometimes emits a natural oil that wipes away everything around it.
lucky break for the killer. - Not so lucky for us.
Ah, Jethro, this, by the way, may take some time.
what I've found so far is troubling.
I counted 11 blows to the head, many more to the back and chest.
vicious attack. - And determined.
I mean, with that many, the attack must have taken several minutes.
enough for him to land a few punches himself, Duck?
and get a hand on the weapon. Mr. Palmer?
the wood taken from Sergeant Wooten's palm was snapped at a downward angle.
in a struggle, a splinter this size could have broken off as the weapon was yanked away.
did you get prints? - Not yet.
there is another unique marking.
maybe from a second weapon? - Possibly.
it's a peculiar design. Abby is working on it.
and then, there are these.
that from the fight? - No. The wounds are partially scabbed, and the color of the bruises tells me that they're days, if not weeks, old.
you know, Jethro, the nature of this attack suggests someone who's not afraid to get close to their victim and will stop at nothing to finish him off.
someone he knew. - Intimately.
state police found Gunnery Sergeant Wooten and her son near the Maryland border.
they're bringing them in now.
McGee contact Family Services. Request a grief counselor.
already made the call.
you might want to call them back. Now.
Hey, sweetie, I need to talk to these people for a moment, so I'm gonna leave you with these two guys, and I'll be right back, okay?
okay. - Okay.
you must be Agent Gibbs? - Gunny Wooten.
we've got a counselor standing by if you need one.
I don't need a counselor. I need to see my husband.
I'm asking you to take me to him. I want to see him for myself.
one heck of a grieving widow.
I'll call Ducky.
remove the sheet. Please?
take him.
gunny?
I can't pay for a funeral right now.
is this going to take long? I need to get back to my son.
he's in good hands.
I'd rather stand. Thank you.
you had a lot of people worried.
I promised Jacob we'd go to Kingsland Fun Park for his birthday.
what time did you leave? - Just before 11: 00.
fun park open that late? - We wanted to be first in line.
Ah. Get a hotel room? - Yes.
you tell anybody?
I told my husband. Told my C. O.
your C. O. says you didn't request leave or liberty.
he's wrong.
I thought you brought me in here to ask questions about my husband.
Yeah, I did. - Then fire away, Agent Gibbs.
sergeant Wooten have any enemies?
besides the ones we're fighting over in Afghanistan? No.
how about Jancey Gilroy? His girlfriend?
Travis told me that was over.
Yeah, well, he didn't tell her that.
you are having marriage problems?
well, Travis, uh, lost his job, so... money was tight.
we were... working through it. We were...
I can't believe he's gone.
I can't believe I get to raise my son alone.
get to? - Hmm?
you "get to"?
my mind's a little scrambled right now.
you look pretty steady to me.
I'm a United States Marine, Agent Gibbs. Steady is how I'm built.
steady is what my son needs right now.
steady... is all I've got.
you're a marine. You should understand that.
come on, baby.
get me all the e-mails and phone records on Georgia Wooten.
now. - Do it.
okay, well, just so you know, I'm about...
I plan on filing a complaint.
you want to join the party, McGee? - Since when did banks become so evil?
since about the 12th century.
McGee: I'm out almost $10, 000. They say there's nothing they can do.
what happened? - Well, somebody has accessed my accounts, my credit cards;
they even have my social security number.
and they have been racking up payments on just about everything.
everquest online games, Melissa's Erotic Entertainment.
club Med! That's new.
my kind of identity thief.
not a hacker, either. - Uh, how do you know?
my firewall hasn't been penetrated.
lubricant helps, but everybody has dry spells.
can't believe this is happening to me. What if I have to change my name?
where do I start? - Oh, no. Don't. Please, don't.
McClean, McFly, McQueen, McGeek,
McBankrupt, McMiserable, McRib, McGreek...
Hi, Gibbs! I've a lot to tell you. Well, n-not a lot, but enough, for now.
um, meet Steve, and Bill, and... Rupert; at least, that's what I like to call them.
they're replicas of Sergeant Wooten; specifically, his head.
you know, I thought it might be kind of creepy to name a fake head after a real dead guy, - and I thought this would be more respectful. - Abbs, what's the point?
okay. I re-created each blow using three different weapons, all made from a material similar in composition to the wood that was found in Sergeant Wooten's hand, and all heavy enough to inflict the same sort of damage.
my goal was to see which one best matched up with the head wounds.
And? - And... it's none of them.
look...
by measuring the depressions in the skull,
I deduced that the one that came the closest was the broom handle.
but here's the kicker: it's not close enough.
the markings aren't as deep.
which makes me think that the weapon is-is smaller, so...
voil! - It's a perfect match.
I know. So here... is the weapon of choice.
nightstick? - Yeah, or something very close to it.
also, it was... covered in some sort of stain or varnish, or something; and it's very rare.
I haven't been able to find a single U. S. manufacturer.
I'm still looking.
what about the neck wound? - Oh... I'm not sure about that yet, either.
my best guess is some sort of metal chain.
I can't believe the amount of force used.
our killer had a lot of rage, Abb.
Gibbs, we confirmed Gunnery Sergeant Wooten did, in fact, lie about requesting leave.
C. O. filed the U. A. paperwork today. - McGee, e-mails?
well, nothing unusual in her Navy correspondence.
still tracking down all her personal e-mail accounts.
but... I do have this.
gunnery Sergeant Wooten has led dozens of Marine Corps Martial Arts training programs in Quantico.
somebody needs a safe word. - When was this shot?
two months ago. After she got back from her last tour in Afghanistan.
a lot of anger there.
she's a strong, powerful woman, in a world dominated by men.
that's not anger: that is determination. - McGee, zoom in.
looks like she got banged up. - Poor little rookie never had a chance.
find out why.
man: Gunnery Sergeant Wooten became overly aggressive with a candidate.
her conduct was noted and addressed.
that's where the bruises came from?
they were consistent with the incident on that day and prior training sessions, yes.
she get overly aggressive a lot? - No. First time.
having any problems with this particular candidate?
not to my knowledge. Think the issue went deeper than that.
how deep?
gunnery Sergeant Wooten is an exceptional marine.
served as my liaison with Afghan women and children.
has great focus and skill.
but after her last tour of Afghanistan, that focus has been lacking.
signs of post-traumatic stress?
Marines are debriefed upon returning from duty.
physical and psychological evaluations are available to those who need counseling.
the gunnery sergeant need counseling?
her debriefing showed no need.
you believed that?
I agreed with the evaluations.
well, I'm not asking for your professional opinion, Major.
georgia's an incredible woman, great marine and loving mother.
but lately, something's got her all torn up inside, and it has nothing to do with her work here.
these were taken of Gunnery Sergeant Wooten by an emergency room doctor to document what he called "suspected domestic abuse.
any other E. R. visits? - Five in six years. All different hospitals.
were the police contacted? - She refused to press charges.
was her C. O. notified?
marine counselors questioned her, but she insisted that her injuries were the result of boxing training at an off-base gym.
she refused the military's help. - Yes.
the only reason she'd lie about that is because Georgia Wooten was an abused woman.
and the guy who was abusing her turns out to be our murder victim?
these bruises and lacerations could be consistent with somebody hitting a target repeatedly.
target was the wife, Duck.
I wouldn't blame her if she did this.
nobody would, but that doesn't make it any less of a crime.
she never reported it. - Well, I'm not surprised.
the last thing a woman like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten wants is to be seen as a victim.
no, she's too proud. - Too weak is more like it.
she's a classic case of emotional transference
strong and powerful on the job because she is completely without power at home.
she was a prisoner.
and perhaps killing her husband is her one chance at freedom.
I got to get her to open up.
Yeah, I agree, but I'm not sure that you're the one for the job.
agent David has been through things that you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.
I'm not sure I want to open up those wounds, Duck.
Yes, but she may be the only one who can connect with her.
I told Agent Gibbs all I know.
you did not tell him everything. I know what happened to you.
you have no right, none at all.
I did not come here to challenge you. - And you think this is helping me?
look, I'm not the enemy. I only want to find out the truth.
truth according to who-- you?
mom, I'm hungry.
okay, baby, I'll be in in a second and we'll fix you something.
you need to leave now. - Wait.
I know what it's like to be under the control of a man, to feel like you have no power and the only way to get that power back is to shut down.
you tell yourself you must shut down.
you tell yourself to never show any emotion to anybody.
I know what that's like.
it's the only way you can survive.
I also know what it's like to...
want to seek revenge.
I did not kill my husband, Agent David.
you stay away from me and you stay away from my son.
there is no getting through to her. - She's closed off.
even with family and friends, apparently.
I spoke to several of them, and they had no idea the abuse was going on.
blood from the bedroom matches Gunnery Sergeant Wooten's, boss.
he beat her one last time and then she snapped.
she claims she was at a hotel that night.
uh, credit card records show no hotel or motel charges, - but it looks like she made more than a few calls, boss. - To who?
one to her husband, one to voice mail, and one to... ...him.
well, hello there, Mr. Smooth.
got calls here dating back several weeks, boss.
Len Feeney told us he didn't even know Georgia Wooten.
imagine that. He lied.
I didn't tell you 'cause it's none of your business.
not our business to know you were friends with the dead man's wife?
look, Georgia called me a few months ago, looking for Travis.
I'd met her once or twice.
you know, she'd pick him up when he was too drunk to drive.
this time her voice was shaking. Something was wrong.
I told her to stay where she was, be with her boy.
I'd calm Travis down before he went home.
so you knew about the abuse? - We'd talk, I'd check in with her.
I mean, I would have reported it myself, but she told me not to.
said it would just make things worse.
but maybe she had other plans.
she ever talks about wanting her husband dead?
Oh, no. Said she would never kill the father of her child, and honestly, I didn't understand it.
somebody as strong as her?
well, I believe Gunnery Sergeant Wooten was too afraid to confront him.
his girlfriend sure wasn't.
Travis Wooten attacked her, too? - More like she attacked him.
happened that night. Got so bad I almost had to call the cops.
Thanks, Jen.
all right, boss, we got a history of drug and alcohol abuse.
girl's in and out of rehab. - Got a criminal record?
and does she.
DUI, possession, assault.
she got kicked out of high school for putting another girl in the hospital.
a real Girl Gone Wild kind of girl.
we'll check it out.
Gibbs, Ducky found a small chip of fingernail polish embedded deep in Travis Wooten's arm.
traced it to Ms. Gilroy's beauty salon.
McGee, got a location?
boss, she hasn't shown up for work in two days, and her bank just confirmed she cashed out all her accounts this morning.
you got someone looking for the car?
state police.
find her.
let me see your hands.
going somewhere, Ms. Gilroy?
I didn't kill Travis. I loved him.
love do that?
we were passionate. Sometimes we got physical. So what?
a lot of couples do. It's no big deal.
it is if one of them ends up dead.
so what happened? Find out he was married?
you snap? - No.
if the sergeant was married, what do you think that makes you?
we had something special, all right? - He tells you that?
n... I-I just knew.
or maybe it is what you wanted to believe.
I thought Travis was different than the other guys.
I thought he really wanted to be with me. - He used you.
he threw me away like a piece of trash.
I got things to offer. I'm not trash, you know.
made you angry.
I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me, make him suffer.
so you finished the job?
I'm pregnant.
as mad as I was, I would never kill him.
sergeant Wooten know that?
I told him that night. - And that is why you fought?
he lost it. Started telling me he already had a wife and a kid and calling me all kinds of names.
I ran out of the club, I got a cab, and I never looked back.
well, a D. C. cab service confirms Gilroy took one of their cabs that night.
I don't know whether it was before or after the murder.
still in communications with them. - I need times.
I've got a time for you, Gibbs.
well, not a time but something that keeps time
although I've never really understood that expression because it's not like you can get it back-- you know, time, I mean.
um, okay, so you know that little weird mark that was on the back of Sergeant Wooten's neck?
not from a chain at all.
a watch band?
a vintage Belle and Sloane 1959 special edition 14-karat gold- plated watch band, to be exact.
there was only 700 sold in the United States, and our killer is wearing one.
well, then Jancey Gilroy is not our killer.
cab service just sent over footage from inside the taxi.
look at this. Meter begins at 12: 37 a. m. at Feeney's Billiard Club
note no watch-- and the ride ends at 12: 55 at 6301 Kentwood Circle.
that's Gilroy's address-- 20 miles from Travis Wooten's home.
what now, boss?
McGee. - McGee, I'm in autopsy.
put up Georgia Wooten's training video.
right, on it.
fast-forward.
stop it. There, zoom in.
well, it looks like Gunnery Sergeant Wooten fought back after all.
Yeah, and this time she killed.
nice and tight. Tuck the chin, drive it through. Okay.
gunny tell your people to stand by.
sergeant, you've got it?
corporal McNeil, front and center.
you need to come with us.
I don't understand. - Do not make this more difficult for yourself.
no handcuffs, please, not in front of them.
you're in pain.
you don't know anything about me.
I know more than you think.
july 27, 2005.
admitted to Bethlehem Emergency for a fractured jaw.
september 4, 2008.
different hospital. Lacerations to the legs and arms.
march 17, 2010. Bruised rib, broken clavicle.
enough.
I am not a victim. - No.
no, you're not. You're a survivor.
you know, I, uh...
I could take the beatings.
I mean, they'd happened for so long, I didn't even feel the pain anymore.
even when he, uh...
...when he made sure to hit me in places that no one would see.
but Travis knew I was getting numb...
...so, he started looking for new ways to hurt me.
you know, to control me.
he was looking for my breaking point.
that night, he found it.
he found the... the one thing that could make me... break.
your child.
he... He threatened to take Jacob.
you know, he'd tell the courts that I was unfit, that I been written up for fighting on the job, that I was away on duty more than I was home.
he said, by the time he was done,
I would never see Jacob again.
you can hurt me all you want, but you don't touch my child.
I'd die for him.
would you kill?
I grabbed Jacob, and I ran.
I mean, I'd run before. I just always came back, but this time...
I knew we had to disappear.
I knew how to run from my husband.
I didn't know how to kill him.
it wasn't me, Agent Gibbs.
Tony, this is huge.
you realize the FBI says that I might be involved in this Russian identity theft ring?
calm down, McSpiracy.
before you go all global, let's take a look at this list of charges again. Come on.
I don't have time for this.
back in my Baltimore Homicide days, I'd do 20 of these a week.
you never did cybercrime.
no, but I did take a Saturday seminar once, and I excelled. Hit me.
meltdown Comics, Lola's Pleasure Chest,
gamestop and Relax the Back.
I've got it.
your identity thief is a 14-year-old pimpled-faced comic book fanatic with severe osteoporosis.
thank you so much for your help, Tony.
you know I'm here for you.
talk to me, Abbs. - Oh, I'm not the one who's talking, Gibbs. That is.
and it happens to have a really thick Irish brogue.
sorry. You lost me.
okay, you remember the varnish chips that I could not trace?
well, there was a reason for that.
and it comes all the way from the rolling hills of
wait for it, wait for it...
...County Donegal, Ireland.
the company's called McClendon's Fine Finishes.
they specialize in high-end varnishes that are used for one thing and one thing only.
you want to guess what that is?
okay. I'll show you.
break a pool cue in half, and you've got one killer weapon. So to speak.
you need to start calling first, Agent DiNozzo. I'm in a meeting.
it can wait. Excuse us?
well, at least let me offer you a drink first.
just got a nice imported single malt in, hmm?
that's not the only thing you've got imported.
it's a 1999 Scarpello limited edition.
african blackwood.
made a chess set out of this once.
it's incredibly dense. Top of the line.
like things how I like 'em.
people ever mess with the things you like, Mr. Feeney?
Oh, they're wise not to.
so, uh, Sergeant Wooten-- guess he wasn't too wise, huh?
that's insane. You think I'd risk all of this for Wooten?
no, not for him, but I think you would for his wife.
hearing your voice that night, how scared you were, I...
I had to confront Travis. I-I had to stop him.
he came at me, and once I hit him, I couldn't stop.
I kept pounding and pounding on him over and over again until I couldn't anymore.
I'd do anything for you.
take me home.
please?
tell me, you wouldn't have done the same thing?
so you haven't seen The Hunt for Red October?
Nope. - Yeah, it's when Alec Baldwin was skinny.
this your new best friend, Tony? - Oh, he's not here to see me.
tim McGee? Meet Tim McGee.
sup, dude? - Hello. I don't get it.
well, Tim, there are two kinds of identity thieves.
there's the kind you never know, and there's the kind that knows you so well, that they're aware you're not home from 7: 00 a. m. to 10: 00 p. m.
you're Mrs. Miller's kid, right? Nick? - Who is Mrs. Miller?
it's McGee's landlady, the holder of the keys.
she also has a bad back.
it was you?!
you stole my identity?
you sent me an inflatable girlfriend?
dude, it's fraud, and you're only liable for, like, 50 bucks.
Yeah, dude.
Why? Why did you do this to me?
you're always doing the same thing.
go to work, come home, go to work again.
you even order the same take-out food every single night.
not every night. - Dude, yes.
you got to start living. You're too young to act so old.
you're welcome.
can we go to GameStop now? - Yeah, man.
my little dude. You want to come?
Tony, I got all this paperwork. I got to...
all right, you know what? Let's go. I'd love to.
excellent.
smokin' hot chick. Can she come, too?
cool it, Nick.
you know you're still gonna owe me that 50 bucks.
talk to my mom, bro.
I got to stop.
great idea!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did we get you?
gee, you think? - Oh, here.
here you go.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
here, touch me - you'll make it even.
no, thank you.
I... That didn't come out right.
what a jerk!
all right, all right!
let go! - Man, sober up.
dude, you okay?
I'll drop you off back at base, man.
no, no, no, I'm just going to walk. Shake the stink off.
play with me.
please... play with me. Play with me.
Yes, they came in this morning.
in fact, I'm wearing them right now.
Oh, yes. They feel really, really good when I move.
I have to get to work.
Yeah, I'm going to have to call you back.
Yeah, I,uh... I miss you too, Ray.
Yeah. Okay, bye.
I do.
and I do not care who knows.
well, sounds like you're getting pretty serious.
I am happy. Ray is happy.
we are meeting in New York, next weekend.
he's taking me to the opera.
the opera?
does his boyfriend know about you?
no, but his mom does.
you've met the 'rents?
when are we going to get to meet him?
all in good time, McGee.
and how is your... special new someone?
I don't have a special anything. And it's none of your business.
huh! Well, someone's keeping secrets.
that's pretty classic, coming from the woman who's kept her boyfriend hidden from us for months.
I'm not hiding anything.
ray knows all about you.
again, why haven't we met him?
because Ray knows all about you.
I'm not the one you should be worried about, right?
I've seen men of steel melt from a mere glance from Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
that flinty, steel-eyed stare that makes those men turn into sniveling little girls.
it's just... Morning, boss.
grab your gear.
got a dead Naval officer in Virginia.
Hey, Duck. Think we could get a better look at this?
he's wrapped up tighter than a Thanksgiving turkey.
his ankles are bound. That's odd.
well, we'll move as fast as we can.
might want to move a little faster.
looks like the locals want to get back to work.
well, they probably didn't expect him to be part of their spring crop.
although human remains would make a... excellent fertilizer.
Oh, that is stinky.
Ooh, yeah. Just a little.
Yeah, throat's cut.
and a deep cut at that.
had a pet gerbil when I was a kid.
I, uh, buried him in my mother's vegetable garden after he died.
and that year, her plum tomatoes were better than ever.
I used to think of him every time I bit into one, and...
cause he-he was talking about the, uh, fertilizer...
so, uh... You're right. I'm sorry, sorry.
skin is dehydrated.
decomposition has set in.
how long ago?
uh, my guess - four to five days.
he's extremely clean.
there's no defensive wounds.
no obvious signs of a struggle.
no blood pooling.
I'd say he was killed somewhere else and left here.
Gibbs, the farm's owner says he has only seen his employees around this area the past week.
that's about half a mile from the road.
no street lamps.
easy to come and go without being seen.
police report someone found a wallet and a watch in a Dumpster near town.
no one claimed it.
you get an I. D?
uh, it was empty except for about 50 bucks.
whoever killed the captain wasn't after his cash.
uh, this is not a captain.
seaman Derek Balfour.
whoever killed him could have played dress-up.
something is in his lapel here, Doctor.
it's a Metro card.
based on the date stamp, purchased after his time of death.
Jethro, take a look at this.
this young man's gaze has been altered, postmortem.
Yeah, someone physically adjusted his eyeballs.
combine where they're looking now, with the Metro card and, uh...
what is he looking toward?
D. C.
it's a message.
seaman Derek Balfour.
22. Enlisted three years ago, stationed at Norfolk.
scheduled to ship out next week for a second tour to the Middle East.
service record?
C. O. says he's likeable, but a bit of a loose cannon.
not captain material, boss.
he was dedicated, though.
seaman Balfour lacks the skills necessary for promotion,"yet has great devotion to the Navy.
he works harder than anyone else.
and played even harder.
written up for a drunk-and-disorderly, six months ago- mandatory alcohol counseling.
passed with flying colors. Not a blemish on his record since.
did he have a family?
mom's in Rhode Island.
they've been estranged for years.
dad was never in the picture. No siblings.
left home when he was 15;
supported himself with odd jobs until he joined the Navy.
a friend of Seaman Balfour's says they were at a D. C. club together last Thursday night.
they had several beers, and left separately around 1: 00 a. m.
okay, phone records, e- mails, financials.- On it.
I thought you were in Miami.
I lied. I was in the parking lot.
you have been very creepy today.
sneaky. " And yes, I have.
but for a very good cause.
introductions, Ziva?
um, uh, right. Of course.
uh, Ray Cruz... this is everyone.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
pleasure, sir.
agent Timothy McGee. - How are you?
Tony DiNozzo. - Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. It's a pleasure.
special Agent. Heard good things.
Yeah. Likewise.
friend of Ziva's is a friend of ours.
of course, the last time she had an out-of-town visitor, our director ended up in the hospital.
well, I come in peace. Promise.
and despite the injuries your director sustained, the agency thinks that you navigated that situation very well.
you CIA?
just celebrated my 13th year, sir.
that's funny.
Ziva failed to mention your line of work.
well, that's what I do. It's-it's not who I am.
that's a very Zen, New-Agey kind of attitude for someone who installs puppet regimes for a living.
okay. Uh, Gibbs, can I give Ray a tour?
Yeah, sure.
don't lose him.
it's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
so it's not "Renaissance Ray" .
it's "CIA Ray. " He's "CI-Ray" .
you really should get that checked out. It's like a bad tick or something.
there's something about this guy, boss.
his smile is disturbing.
haven't seen a smile like that since Christian Bale's barely audible Batman in The Dark Knight.
DiNozzo. - Right. Back to work.
it's what I do, not who I am.
What's...?
it's just so weird.
so many Naval decorations for the "low man on the totem pole.
sorry. No offense.
actually, Mr. Palmer, if Seaman Balfour had been "totemized,
as it were, he would have been much closer to the top.
I don't follow.
native Americans designed their poles so that the lower you were on it, the higher they held you in esteem.
calling someone "low man on the totem pole" is, in fact, a compliment.
so all these years, Gibbs has been complimenting me.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far, Palmer.
how far are you getting, Duck?
as far as the evidence will allow - not very.
however, Seaman Balfour, here, died from loss of blood from a severed carotid artery.
a six-centimeter-deep cut.
they knew what they were doing.
and they knew not to leave anything behind.
the body was thoroughly cleansed.
I mean, I've been over it twice, Jethro.
there's nothing - no trace of blood, no fingerprints, no strand of hair.
Additionally... - Oh, the fingernails on both hands were just cut.
well, manicured is more like it.
and the skin is abraded in places where the person scrubbed so hard.
meticulous.
not to mention well-trained.
Oh, we did find traces of a rare, high-grade cleanser.
Abby is running tests.
medical background? - Perhaps.
but I wouldn't rule out someone from law enforcement, either.
someone who knows the value of a clean corpse.
greetings, Director.
what brings you to the nether regions of our building?
I am so sorry.
I had no idea that that was your parking spot.
I swear. - At ease, Palmer.
I'm just here to check on the case.
heard there were some unusual characteristics about it.
still putting it together.
I'm not here to disrupt that; just to get an update.
is that a problem?
no.
just don't see you down here much.
things change.
Dr. Mallard, tell me what you know so far.
right. Let me call you back.
Ah, Agent- sorry- Special Agent DiNozzo.
C. I. Ray.
need to get that?
it can wait. Just wrapping up an old case.
anything interesting?
can't talk about it.
C. I. Ray business?
Yep.
so, uh... How long you in town?
as long as Ziva will have me for.
Yeah, she's a tough nut to crack.
but, you know, once you navigate past that Mossad-influenced exterior and her inability to grasp cultural references, she's great.
I'm in love with her.
that's why I'm here.
to tell her? When are you going to do that?
I don't know.
tonight, tomorrow - soon.
you know, it feels good to finally get it out.
I'll bet.
you know, I want Ziva's friends to become my friends.
she's told me how close the two of you are.
I wouldn't say that.
well, she says you're like a brother to her.
meeting.
do me a favor - don't say anything to Ziva.
Hey, I gotta go.
where are you off to?
I have to see an old associate, but it shouldn't take too long, okay?
somebody sure left in a hurry.
he has work to do.
Yeah, so do we. Tell me what we got.
navy server showed nothing unusual in Seaman Balfour's e-mails.
but I did find this.
bank shows several charges on his debit card over the past four days.
various stores, various amounts.
dead guy on a shopping spree.
surveillance video?
Abby's still analyzing.
but so far, we've got no clear shot of the person taking Balfour's identity.
seaman Balfour's apartment manager says that someone has been staying in his apartment since last Friday.
day after he was murdered. - You got a description?
white male, unknown age.
is he there now?
manager saw him go into the unit this morning, but never come out.
DiNozzo, come on, let's go.
it's 203.
if you need, I got the key.
NCIS. Open up.
clear, boss.
tidy.
not a thing out of place.
except for this.
that is one empty refrigerator.
what the hell is that?
he likes leaving things behind.
what? You just happened to be in the neighborhood, Special Agent Barrett?
flower, huh?
that's a new one.
I'm going to take a look around, see what else I can find.
see what you can find?
I've been tracking the killer the past nine months.
three dead Navy men in three different ports.
what's your connection?
case started in Rota, Spain.
Rota. - Never been there. Hear it's nice.
seaman Balfour's murder fits the pattern, right down to the funny little ice cubes.
my killer, my case.
what I was thinking is we...
I'll have to call you back.
I take it Agent Barrett got settled in.
Yeah, for the second time.
you could have told me, Director.
it was need-to-know.
you didn't, so what's the problem?
you kept me in the dark... on purpose?
it just landed on our soil, Gibbs.
I'm telling you now.
called the "Port-to-Port Killer."
victims are all Navy enlisted.
bodies found near bases in Sasebo, Guam, Rota.
M. O.'s the same every time: throats cut, redressed, thoroughly cleaned and wrapped in plastic.
no physical evidence left behind.
but he does always leave some kind of object.
that's a signature. - Maybe.
bread crumbs.
left this near the last body in Guam.
a peanut?
boiled. Grown in southeastern Virginia.
suggests that the killer may be on his way to the States.
agent Barrett was brought in last month in anticipation of that move.
unfortunately, we were right.
Balfour was the latest victim.
but he won't be the last.
the SecNav wants the Port-to-Port Killer found and locked up fast.
I suggest you get past your issues with E. J.running the lead on this and find him.
you're quiet.
I'm pensive.
if this is some kind of game, I'm not playing.
no game.
Oh, I get it. You don't like it when I play boss lady.
would have been nice to know you'd be showing up out of the blue like this.
you just saw me last night.
Yes, in my apartment, wearing my Elvis Costello T-shirt which was extremely gratifying, but I didn't expect you at my crime scene - sifting through my evidence.
technically, it was my crime scene and my evidence.
well, technically, you could have mentioned it.
it wasn't something I could share.
maybe it was something you didn't want to share.
that thing is pissing me off.
just move this... And...
what?
the skylight and the computer screen - a way to avoid awkward moments.
intriguing.
a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma.
Joe Pesci, Oliver Stone's JFK - nice.
winston Churchill, Russia, 1939.
smarty-pants.
I don't think this is going to work out.
not with us on the same case. We should stop.
okay.
okay. Best we end it.
or not.
dinner my place?
I'll bring wine.
got anything, Abbs?
it's just that our crazed lunatic killer also happens to be a plant lover.
after comparing the flower that was found in Seaman Balfour's apartment to dozens of species that are indigenous to North America, I got a match.
behold the Pogonia ophioglossoides.
also known as the 'Snake-Mouth Orchid.
it's a rare species, Gibbs - so rare it's been put on the endangered list in several states.
Yeah, so?
so, if P2P- Port-to-Port Killer- I made that up myself- if P2P wants to grow one, he would have to do it himself, or find someone who could.
he knows his plants.
Oh, that's not all he knows.
seaman Balfour's wounds were clean - there were no ragged edges.
the angle and the bevel of the cut run in a straight line, so our weapon is...
surgical.
Yep, and it's a perfect match to this.
I also matched the cleanser that was found on the body.
it's an iodine-based scrub called Xeonphine.
it's made in Canada, and it's only sold to hospitals.
so... we're looking for someone in the medical field?
what, a doctor maybe?
Yeah, or a, a - a surgeon or a nurse maybe.
Abbs, do you need a doctor?
no, it's just... change, Gibbs.
change makes me itch.
it always has.
it's-it's Agent Barrett.
I'm not a fan. I mean, of change.
her - I don't mind.
she's feisty for someone so small.
um, and I like that.
not that I like her, because I don't really...
Abby. - Not like I like you.
Abbs.- I just- I like our family just the way it is.
nothing's going to change.
I do not trust her.
and I know that Gibbs does not trust her.
but she will be here running lead until we solve this case.
I mean throwing in someone new - it's never a good idea.
never.
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.
okay, so enough about my day.
how was the meeting with your associate?
can we talk about something other than work?
just - just for a while?
a very little while?
there's something that I want to tell you.
okay.
I... Ignore it.
wait.
okay. I'm sorry.
that was... that was McGee.
he had a question.
what did you need to tell me?
nothing.
it can wait.
the Port-to-Port Killer is a highly egotistical individual.
he's lethal and determined and... You're all welcome to join me.
I'm not really into yelling from way over here.
Yeah, we can hear you fine.
keep going.
suspect is a white male anywhere from 25 to 55, never married, no children.
born into money, he is charming, charismatic and very entitled.
are you sure we're not looking for Tony?
he's killed in Japan, Guam, Spain and now the U. S.
no connection between any of his victims besides the fact that they're all Navy or former Navy.
he is well-traveled, multilingual, adapts to other cultures easily.
and as you know, his M. O. suggests he has medical training of some kind.
doesn't tell us why he gives them a promotion before he dumps them.
or why he leaves things behind.
the flower from Balfour's apartment told us nothing.
could indicate where he's going next.
I think he's still here.
and he's not leaving anytime soon.
is that a hunch, Special Agent Barrett?
we're talking about a pathological individual!
he's smart, incredibly high-achieving...- Oh, I doubt it.
I think that these murders are his biggest achievement.
that a hunch, Agent Gibbs?
boss, I got something here you should see.
excuse me.
it's from Seaman Balfour's personal e-mail cache; most recent was the morning of his death.
you're crazy if you think "you're getting away with this, Balfour.
I'll kill you before that happens.
you got a name, McGee?
Yep. 24-year-old Bryce Leitner, heir to the Leitner timber fortune.
dropped out of med school two years ago, been traveling the world ever since.
and he has visited Japan, Guam and Spain in the past year.
do you have a location?
last known local address is a condo in Georgetown.
we can be done in ten minutes, or here all day. It's up to you.
I'm not saying anything.
let's talk about Sasebo, Japan.
why were you there?
starting without me, Special Agent Barrett?
we're just getting settled in.
you're in my chair.
need to know why you traveled so much the last year, Mr. Leitner.
you've been in D. C. two weeks? - Yeah.
and before you arrived here, you were in Europe and Southeast Asia.
we have e-mails you sent threatening Seaman Balfour's life.
yeah? So?
I hated the guy.
next time I see you, I'll take your head off.
it's a figure of speech.
Really? - Yeah.
I find that funny.
that's almost what the killer did.
you were in Japan, Guam, Spain - Where were you a week ago?
let him answer my question, Agent Gibbs.
why the threats to Balfour?
because that loser made a move on my girl.
can you believe that?
low-class piece of...
and just to spite me, she actually goes out with the jerk.
so I get screwed twice.
tell me, Bryce, what's it like to have it all?
the looks, the money, world travel... the women?
excuse us.
there are standards in there.
rules.
I can interrogate him however I want.
different strokes, Gibbs. You weren't getting anywhere with him and he's my suspect.
that's my room.
Vance put me in charge.
Vance isn't here.
I'm trying to establish that he was in all four cities at the same time of the murders.
focus on Balfour.
that's our body, that's our evidence, that's our case!
this is a multiple murder case!
start by pinning one murder on him, and then connect the others. That's how it's done.
maybe that's the old-school way.
it's my way.
I'm calling Vance.
I'll be talking to Leitner.
are you questioning whether I know what I'm doing, Agent Gibbs?
no, ma'am. I'm questioning the way you do it.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Abbs, I'll be right there.
where are you going?
wherever you are.
did you guys have a fight?
Yes. - No.
excuse me.
Abbs, what do you got?
okay, so I ran Bryce Leitner's name through every intelligence and law enforcement database - AFIS, Interpol, DIA, CIA.
point, Abby?
Abbs, come on.
okay, so Leitner's in the system because of a DUl charge in Virginia last year.
okay. And? - And he gave blood.
what does that have to do with it?
only everything.
that, my fearless leader, is the Spanish fishing village of Rosa Verde.
there was a viral outbreak there last July.
about a thousand people were infected.
Leitner's blood had traces of the pertussis virus.
exactly. Which means...
he was in Spain at the same time as the Rota murder.
and he was here in D. C. on the date that Balfour was killed.
looks like my suspect is panning out, Agent Gibbs.
do you want to talk about it?
I'm telling you, you mess with the Great White, you're gonna get eaten.
I'm not afraid of him.
that's your first mistake.
look, there's a pretty good chance I just caught the Port-to-Port Killer.
besides, Gibbs isn't exactly in Vance's good graces these days.
there's your second mistake.
I get the feeling they're not on the best of terms, and Vance outranks him.
okay... I've seen a few directors come and go.
there's only been one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
do the math.
Yeah, and there's only one Anthony DiNozzo.
actually, there are two.
you know, this case may take me more than a few weeks for me to wrap up.
And?
and I'm just saying, I could get used to this.
I like the city life and these offices, despite that ridiculous skylight.
well, you get used to that.
well, then maybe your coworkers could get used to the idea of me being here on a more...
permanent basis.
I look at you and how you've made this place work for yourself.
and it's your home.
it's all about the people around you.
Yeah.
I'm starting to get that.
agent David, C.I. Ray.
stop calling him that.
it's okay. I kinda like it.
agent Cruz.
wait - uh, do you two know each other?
well, yeah. Didn't he tell you?
tell me what?
ray's our CIA liaison with NCIS on the Port-to- Port Killer case.
he has been from the start.
look, I... - No.
okay, well, you lied to me, Ray. I mean, what does the CIA call it?
do the call it "disinformation"? A cover story?
I was protecting you, okay?
I do not need protection!
it was need-to-know information.
I was not allowed to tell you, period.
did you sleep with Agent Barrett?
no, no. And if I did, I would have told you about it.
I didn't come here for this case, Ziva.
I came here for you.
Oh, just stop it! Stop it!
was any of it real? - Yes.
were you just planning on using me to get information, just in case things with Barrett didn't pan out?
I mean, was that it?!
I mean, am I part of this back-up plan?
no, you're overreacting.
Oh, my gosh! You want to see me overreact, Ray?
why don't you tell me another lie?
why don't you tell me the sky is yellow?
why don't you tell me that water is not wet or that sand is not dry?
why don't you tell me that you love me?
I love you.
I love you, Ziva.
I don't believe you.
what about our time in Miami, huh?
the trips?
what about the romantic dinners? I mean, was...
was that all part of your plan?
it was real. - It is real.
we are real.
I wish I could believe you.
you have the wrong guy.
Leitner- he's not the Port-to-Port Killer.
he's a mule for the Syrian government.
we've been watching his every move for the last 16 months, and there's no way he could have killed any of them.
you didn't hear this from me.
Gibbs, I got to talk to you.
I need to tell you something.
I cannot tell you how I know this, and you cannot ask.
all right. Tell me what?
Bryce Leitner is not the Port-to-Port Killer.
how sure are you?
very.
okay.
turns out our chief suspect isn't the Port-to-Port Killer.
how can you be so sure?
reliable source.
how reliable? - Very.
well, what's that supposed to mean?
it means Leitner has alibis for all three international murders.
still leaves our local body.
McGee, Balfour: crime scene photos. Put'em up.
look, I've been on this case for nine months.
I've studied every piece of evidence; I've studied these photos a hundred times in the last 24 hours.
Yeah, well, we're going to study them again.
go close-up on his decorations.
what?
service Warfare Pin.
four Navy air medals.
distinguished Flying Cross.
there's no way a Black Shoe could have a Distinguished Flying Cross and four air medals.
boss, this guy should have pilot wings.
so the killer made a mistake when re-dressing the victim?
has he ever made a mistake before?
never. The guy's meticulous.
this is a message. He wanted us to see these.
McGee, put up a map of the murders.
all port cities. I've already been over this.
airports?
and I've already checked the flight manifests for all passengers...
not interested in passengers.
hubs. - Hubs?
hubs.
MTAC, now.
stay.
told you not to play with the Great White.
homeland just had FAA transfer all encrypted flight watch data.
do it.
airlines servicing all four cities where the Port-to-Port Killer struck.
well, there's four airlines that service Sasebo and Guam, but not Rota.
there's only one that services all three cities and D. C. - Espree Airlines.
they go to all four international hubs, as well as Reagan and Dulles.
cities are transfer points.
meaning stopover points for pilots, flight crew, stewards and maintenance workers.
checking the employee records for Espree Airlines.
all right.
now these are the names of the various flight personnel who had stopovers in the cities where the Port-to-Port murders occurred.
how many served in the U. S. Navy?
six.
how many were in all four cities at the times of all four murders?
one.
Nathan Finney, U.S. Navy, retired.
put him up.
f-18 jockey, top of his Top Gun class in San Diego.
served in Gulf Wars One and Two.
that explains the decorations.
80 bombing sorties in downtown Baghdad.
our killer's a war hero?
give me an address.
just outside Alexandria.
clear.
clear.
clear.
nothing here, boss.
out here!
Nathan Finney, with a bad case of freezer burn.
heat wave in Autopsy.
I guess there really is global warming.
Yeah, Autopsy is indeed topsy-turvy today, Mr. Palmer.
nice alliteration Doctor.
what do we got?
based on the depth, angle of penetration, and the keenness of the blade, I'd say it was...
same scalpel as the murders.
Yes. Carotid artery and windpipe severed with great precision.
you have a time of death?
I'd say he's been dead and frozen for at least six weeks.
so you've got one more dead body, but no Port-to-Port Killer, is that right?
we're confident we're closing in.
good, because SecNav tasked me to solve this case.
so, I'm to tell him what?
we got a bouquet of flowers, some more ice, and no suspects.
I put both of you on this case to double the chances of catching this lunatic.
now I'm wondering if I didn't double his chances of escaping.
look, I don't care how you do it- together, apart, mean, nice- just get it done.
so I guess we're still partners.
see you in the morning, Special Agent Barrett.
you sleeping with DiNozzo?
it's not against NCIS policy to date co-workers.
it's against my policy.
this team operates on respect.
you don't respect me... - No.
I don't trust you.
Really? - Really.
except to work the case, leave my team alone.
we clear?
shouldn't drink alone; it's too depressing.
it's a club soda, and I'm not depressed.
well... I wouldn't blame you. It's been a rough day.
maybe for you.
I'm fine.
if you were fine, you wouldn't be here.
okay, then. Let's go.
I would like a drink.
and it is depressing to drink alone.
Barkeep!
anything old and gold. I might be getting a cold.
sorry. Scotch on the rocks. Thank you.
comin' up!
he's CIA.
they have a sworn duty to protect what they know.
same as we do.
he was just doing his job.
he lied to me, Tony.
Yeah. Because...
he cares about you.
does not matter, because it's over.
scotch, sir.
what about you and EJ?
what about us?
what are you going to do when Gibbs finds out?
I understand this one, Ziva. I understand her.
that's why it's working.
this is for you.
I didn't order that.
guy in the booth did.
I wonder who?
you have entered United States territorial waters.
u. S. Coast Guard agents boarding for inspection.
respond.
clear.
smugglers.
come all this way just to run out of gas.
Yeah. Looks like they decided to swim the last stretch.
are we taking bets on the cargo?
what do you think, drugs? Weapons?
unmarked tramp D. I.W. off the coast of Norfolk?
eh... Probably a load of knock-off sunglasses.
united States Coast Guard!
they bailed.
Yeah.
radio to Skip.
have them scan the water for anyone who didn't realize it's ten miles to shore.
coop, you all right?! Cooper?!
shots fired on deck.
man down. Man down!
I know that smell.
it's not coming from here.
not over here either.
doesn't he know they do not take the trash out on weekends?
why does he order the same stinky take-out from the same stinky place?
because it's the only place open on Saturday at 2: 00 a. m.
he's working weekends. Did he call you guys over the weekend, too?
twice. - Twice.
about work that we could have done today.
Yeah. - Yes.
isn't 16 hours a day enough for him?
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love my work. I'm just not married to it, you know.
wait. I think I have a solution.
what? A pet for Gibbs? A new hobby?
a new woman.
that is the last thing he needs.
grab your gear.
agent Borin.
what are you doing here?
dead Coast Guard petty officer on a ship towed into Norfolk Navel Base.
joint jurisdiction. Let's go.
you heard her. Move it.
you kept that in your desk, boss?
Oh, yeah. You waste not, you want not.
that's one mystery solved.
maybe two.
what are you talking about?
a new playmate for Gibbs.
what, Borin and Gibbs?
uh, yeah, no, not so sure.
they're too similar.
just means they have a lot in common.
the running lights were on.
there wasn't much sign of anything else.
we boarded the ship at 0200.
coop called out, but got no response.
we thought the crew had jumped ship.
but then the muzzle flash came from across the deck.
you get a look at the shooter?
he's your man, Agent Borin.
you see the killer? - No, ma'am.
when backup arrived, and searched the ship, no one.
and nothing on board but bootleg cosmetics.
camouflaged drugs?
no, we checked. Just creams, moisturizers and soaps.
you put 'em in the right bottle, they can sell for more per ounce than cocaine.
perfume scent's giving the dogs hell.
ship's contents are being thoroughly cataloged.
and our missing crew?
no dust on the sea. No signs of drowning.
unfortunately.
thank you, Petty Officer.
Ma'am-- I hope you find them.
Coop's wife is going to ask me who did this.
I'd like to have an answer.
me, too.
I think Gibbs and Borin would make a great couple.
just think of all the fun they'd have giving each other head slaps.
well, head slaps are not very romantic, Tony.
they can be.
in the right context.
the lifeboat is missing.
I think that's how the crew got off the ship.
Ducky, what do you think?
Gibbs and Borin?
date mate material?
well, given their combined work ethics, they'd probably never see each other.
which could be a recipe for the world's shortest courtship, or extreme longevity.
so nobody's with me on team Bibbs?
no. - We can change the name.
why don't you change the subject, DiNozzo?
at least let him grill you a steak in his fireplace while watching black and white television.
it's more charming than you'd think.
I'll pass.
you know what, I do have a list of girlfriends that might make good candidates.
they can't just be good.
don't worry, they can be bad.
what do you got, McGee?
found three shells.
standard NATO rifle cartridges.
which correspond to the hits on the body.
one of them was stopped by the petty officer's armor.
and the other pene...
what is it, Dr. Mallard?
Morse code.
it's SOS.
it's coming from below.
McGee, stay here with the body.
you two, with us.
the sound's coming from here.
lock handle's been snapped off.
Americans?
looks like our missing crew's smuggling more than cosmetics.
we are from Lebanon.
my family and I wish asylum in the United States.
I am kind of busy, Leon.
I know. That's why I called.
update.
family wants asylum. We want a killer.
get the latter, forget the former.
there something you want to tell me?
Yes. Under no circumstances is anyone on that ship to set foot on U. S. soil.
Why?
because SecNav and the U. S. State Department says so.
lebanon's a key U. S. ally in a very unstable part of the world, Gibbs.
if this family claims political persecution, the next stop is a Credible Fear Screening.
okay, let me guess.
the SecNav doesn't want any more surprises.
he's had his fair share already?
I think he's looking for a reason to get more involved in this and I don't want to give him one.
find the killer.
nothing more.
where is my family?
why have you separated us?
standard procedure, Mr. Bawali.
is that part of the Immigration Department?
no. We're investigating the murder.
where were you when the Coast Guard officer was shot?
trapped.
the crew locked us away as we approached the coast.
so if you were hidden, and they were just carrying cosmetics, why'd they open fire?
you will have to ask them.
couldn't find them. I found you.
we came here to escape violence, Agent Gibbs.
I was protesting an oppressive regime.
they threatened to kill my family.
I realize Muslim refugees do not get a great deal of sympathy in your country.
that's not true.
we take everybody.
we just have rules about how they get here.
and then?
we heard the Coast Guard ship.
one more time. You heard the loudspeaker and then you heard the gunfire?
sorry. You know what, I just want to get the chronology of events right.
we were told Coast Guard would turn us back-- that only if we made land, could we seek asylum.
and after that you heard the gunfire?
that is what I said.
it's lucky none of you got hurt.
luck?
if my father had not put us at risk, we would still be in our home.
now we all must suffer in a country that hates us.
we are not lucky.
did you hear the crew use names?
no. But two were Lebanese. The third was Egyptian.
how do you know that?
their accents.
they're very distinctive.
I went to the University of Cairo.
Really? What was your major?
math and computer science.
your parents must be very proud.
my parents are very scared.
can you describe the crew members?
I need you to focus, Ms. Bawali.
Mariam. My name is Mariam.
the crew?
I think there were three.
I do not remember exactly.
we wish only freedom.
yet you do not allow us to go free.
Why?
do you have family, Agent David?
Yes.
then you must know it is a mother's duty to prote...
what is this?
fresh food and supplies for your family.
I know you have been living on rice and beans.
we don't need charity.
we need freedom.
lamb. Potatoes.
you need to feed your family, Mariam. Hmm?
you have a good maternal instinct.
your parents must be proud of their daughter.
do you have children, Agent David?
my name is Ziva.
and uh... no.
I...had, um...a sister, and, uh, a brother.
I also had a mother.
had"?
they were killed.
I, too, have lost people I cherished.
we come from troubled lands, you and I.
well, you...
are here now.
are we?
Borin wasn't kidding.
her list of female friends is longer than mine.
you having page envy, Tony?
let's not get into a measuring contest, McHunt-and-Peck.
next name: "Stacy DeGraff." Double "f.
all right, she's got a gym membership.
lives in a nice Georgetown condo.
dia analyst.
Ooh, member of Mensa.
let's get to the good stuff.
and that would be?
well, more photos, preferably something on the beach.
tall. Six- foot-six.
she come with her own beanstalk?
how's operation G-date going?
do you have any normal friends?
turn the page, DiNozzo. Plenty of babes in those woods.
just "detect.
she's right.
I've narrowed it down to three potential candidates.
you talking about our missing crew, McGee?
uh, of course, boss. - Borin.
Yeah, I'll be right down, Dr. Mallard.
gotta go sign for the body.
we've, uh, searched the entire ship. Found nothing to help ID our missing crew.
lifeboat?
they're still searching, boss.
coast Guard's got air and surface craft scouring the entire seaboard north of Back Bay.
all coastal law enforcement agencies have been put on alert.
if these guys made it ashore, we'll find them.
one life meets a tragic end.
others struggle for a new beginning.
our family of refugees?
there's an Albanian proverb: "Fire, water and governments know nothing of mercy.
well, their story of oppression in Lebanon is pretty hard to confirm.
Yes, those responsible for that oppression make sure of that.
it's what makes families like our stowaways take desperate measures.
or illegal measures.
you don't trust them?
you know, I spent three years on a cutter off Miami.
the ones who make it to shore are usually the ones you didn't want as neighbors.
and why is that?
because they were willing to do anything to survive.
Yeah.
gut tells me our Swiss Family Robinson knows more about our missing crew than they're saying.
I just can't prove it.
anything we can prove?
ballistics report from Abby.
the rounds from the body were fired from an American-made M16-A4 rifle.
a specially manufactured M16-A4, from a shipment of weapons we sold to the Lebanese government in '09.
how'd our crew end up with one?
I suspect that is a question which the SecNav and Director Vance would not want you to ask.
Yeah, Abbs?
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?
sure.
be right down.
welcome to the disenchanted forest, Gibbs.
what do you got, Abbs?
um, like, the grossest clue chain ever.
Yeah, which is?
poop.
our missing crew-- even if they took everything with them when they jumped ship, they still would have left behind their...waste products.
their human waste. - Yes.
so, it's usually protocol to empty a ship's septic tank into the ocean.
so, we had the main sewage line swabbed.
who did? The Coast Guard?
Yeah. They don't mess around, Gibbs.
stool samples can carry DNA, but your intestinal bacteria that helps you break down food, it has DNA of its own.
so, your feces are almost as unique as a fingerprint.
so you can ID the crew.
no. For that, I'd have to run, like, a hundred separate DNA tests.
but I can settle for visually determining the number of unique bacteria.
so you'll know how many crew members were on board.
I personally examined every sample.
you're welcome.
thank you. And...
only fresh samples from the last seven days contain viable bacteria.
and out of those, I found only four unique poop profiles.
our four family members are the only people to use the ship's facilities in the last week.
there was no crew.
which means not only is the family lying to us, but one of them is our shooter.
I want to speak to the family, Director Vance.
how do you even know they're here?
we have our sources in the State Department.
my organization aids Muslims trying to seek asylum.
we're trying to seek justice.
excuse me.
you have no right to restrict this family's wish to seek political asylum.
actually, we do.
they're stowaways, Ms...
and they made land when you towed them into port.
they're still on board the vessel. Therefore, legally still at sea.
being a Muslim woman, I know the discrimination they're facing.
while I share... - This has nothing to do with them being Muslim.
let's make that very clear.
do you always let your assistants interrupt you like this?
this happens to be the Secretary of the United States Navy.
ms. Hooper, a member of this family killed a U. S. serviceman.
prove it.
meanwhile, I'm filing for an injunction tomorrow, then going to the media.
it's a free country.
only if you're standing on it, right, Mr. Secretary?
right.
can I ask you a question, sir?
what am I doing here?
Yeah. - Helping.
you sure about that?
well, she's not military or law enforcement.
that's good.
Yeah. Maybe we've found our...
never mind. - What?
she's an ordained New Age High Priestess.
explains the timeshare in Sedona.
Yeah.
it's Gibbs.
boss, we've been digging deeper into our refugee family.
And?
mariam never mentioned they also had a daughter.
had? - Yes.
she was killed during a U. S. bombing raid on a Hezbollah safe house in the early 1980s.
action a lot of Lebanese people felt was the U. S.taking sides over the country's Muslim population.
does not mean Mariam feels that way.
ask her.
we gonna ask her what else she's lying about?
no. Ziva is.
why did you lie to me?
there was no crew, Mariam.
you and your family hid yourselves.
you want help?
you want freedom?
then stop lying to me.
let me help you.
fine. Good-bye.- Wait. Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere, but you and your family, you guys are going back to Lebanon.
wait! What do you want to know?
how you got here.
my husband paid the crew, using our life savings.
they took us out of the port in Beirut, set the course, then left the ship by lifeboats.
why did one of you shoot a Coast Guard officer?
I didn't mean to.
you shot him?
we had been followed by pirates before.
it was night.
I didn't hear the man on the speaker, what he was saying.
we had a weapon for protection.
I saw someone climbing aboard in darkness.
I fired.
how many shots did you fire? - Three.
how far away were you?
this far.
this far? - Yes.
according to the second officer, the shooter was about 60 feet away.
so, you weren't even there, were you?
I'm sorry.
you do not know who shot him.
no.
you are a good mother, Mariam, but a really bad liar.
you cannot control the truth about your family, no matter how much that truth may hurt.
well, boys, our evidence shows your mom pulled the trigger.
our mother did not shoot anyone!
that's not what she said.
if she confessed, then you forced it out of her!
doesn't matter how we got her to say it, point is, she said it.
how dare you intimidate our mother, you bitch!
you want to see intimidation, bitch?
my brother means no ill will.
he's got an odd way of showing it.
we must respect our mother.
whatever she told you is the truth.
you're willing to let your mother take the blame for a murder?
no.
you're never gonna find the perfect woman for Gibbs.
how do you know?
cause he's already found her.
his first wife. - Yeah.
well, doesn't mean we can't still try, right?
it's futile.
kind of like our background checks on the refugees.
if there was something to find, we would have found it.
Oh, found more, oh ye of little algorithmic faith.
duly chastised. Hit me, Timmy.
got a facial-recognition match on the father.
it's a photo in the Homeland Security database from 27 years ago.
he was going by a different name.
wanted in connection to a 1984 bombing in Lebanon.
coffee shop frequented by U. S. servicemen.
CIA could never find him. Call Gibbs.
it's going straight to voice mail.
same with Tony.
signal in the ship was wonky.
Hey, Abby.
Where's Farid? - Tony's with him below deck. Why?
he's not who he says he is. You need to get to him quickly.
since you let your wife do the shooting, you ought to think about letting her do the cooking, too.
smells like a Bath & Body Works in here.
this is our laundry water.
and I already told you, I know nothing about the murder.
stop, Farid! Stop!
Freeze!
sure you want to jump?
lead might weigh you down.
cannot run away from your past, Lateef.
it always catches up.
what has happened?
the truth happened.
what part of "keep everybody on the ship" did you not understand?
he's a wanted terrorist, Leon. I arrested him.
you could have called first.
but you knew I'd have you stand down, isn't that right?
Yeah, pretty much.
director, I think Special Agent Gibbs made a valid command decision that, while of questionable wisdom, was absent of malice.
isn't that right, Agent Gibbs? See?
all better.
I'll go call the State Department, explain to them why we chose to ignore their directive.
I'll do it.
you two get ready to break this guy.
unless you want me to referee that, too?
no, sir.
bump in the road, Leon.
it happens.
depends on who's driving, right?
who is driving, sir?
I cannot believeariam would lie to protect this man.
well, maybe she lied to protect herself.
speaking of liars, father Farid was in the Lebanese army.
meaning he knows how to handle a firearm.
I've got my guys pulling everything they can on him.
you find your Gibbs girl yet?
I think so.
Lisa's perfect.
I just saw her last week. She's a hiking partner, stamina of a horse.
she dyed. - What?
her hair.
in all the pictures online, she's blonde.
in yours, she's a redhead.
Yeah, but this is her natural hair color. So what?
eh, we were willing to risk it with you, but it's not a good idea generally.
Tony, don't take this the wrong way, but you smell like the hot cheerleader in my high school homeroom.
is that White Diamonds, DiNozzo?
Farid spilled his laundry detergent all over the place.
I got some on my pants. I must have, must have missed a spot.
is that it?
no, a little higher.
t-to your right.
you do it.
bend over, DiNozzo.
Oh, that's really on there.
can't get that off.
I'm gonna call Abby to see if she's got something to remove that.
special Agents Borin and DiNozzo.
please stop doing whatever it is you're doing.
we were just, uh...
reexamining that very special bond between the Navy and the Coast Guard, sir.
agent David, back to the ship. Make sure nobody else gets off.
agent Borin, have your people put together an escort team.
this cargo vessel is being refueled as we speak to take the family back to Lebanon.
what about the father?
he's not going anywhere.
do you recognize him?
your DNA was found at the crime scene.
testing has come a long way in 30 years.
do you know how many people died that day?
people die every day.
it doesn't mean I killed them.
smug son of a bitch.
space invader.
it's a nice move. I'm gonna use that.
I'm not your family.
so don't lie to me.
you're not protesting your government, you're protesting mine.
with bombs.
someone finally closing in on you?
forcing you to run here?
I'm a different man now.
are you sure about that?
you sure you're just not holding a grudge still?
about what? - Your daughter.
you blame us for killing her, right?
you did kill her.
so that's why you came here, then. Revenge, right?
I came here to protect my family.
when you killed that six-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother at that cafe, did you ever think about their family?
I want my family to be free.
I want whoever killed the United States Coast Guard petty officer.
and that's for starters.
why do you care so much about the death of one man?
just hold on a second.
I'll hold your coffee.
you have the wrong man, Ziva.
no, you have the wrong man.
this journey to freedom is nothing but a way for him to enter this country by using you and your sons.
I have lived with him for 30 years.
I love him.
nothing changes that.
this... - No.
this changes it. - No. I don't believe it.
then you are lying to yourself!
I mean, you have to know the truth, deep down!
I mean, you must!
yet you allow him to lie to you. To your children.
I'm protecting my children.
they will resent you for it, Mariam.
perhaps I had suspicions.
but have you never turned a blind eye onomeoneou led?
Yes.
Anit was a mista.
I do not intimide.
guess what.
Post-9/11, the Coast Guard works for Homeland Security.
which means we can yank your family off that boat right now.
but they're not going to America.
they're headed to Gitmo.
what are you proposing?
confess.
and your family can turn state's evidence against you.
I cannot confess. - Why?
because I did not shoot anyone!
it was my son.
Rafiq. He killed the Coast Guard officer.
he refuses to listen to me.
I do not know what he's capable of anymore.
that seem too easy to you?
only one way to find out.
interrogate the kid. On the ship.
are we clear?
Yes, sir.
that's not laundry detergent.
Tony, take your pants off.
what?
just take your pants off now.
all right. Easy, now.
let's keep it professional, people.
move along.
girl's always looking at me.
think you can get it out?
Yep.
maybe I should have been more specific.
I'll explain later. I hope.
Abby will explain later, she hopes.
Ziva's not answering. Must be below deck with our shooter.
call base security, McGee. Come on.
DiNozzo, put your pants on.
what will happen to us now that you have my husband?
depends if he cooperates.
stay!
it's locked, from the other side.
why would your people do that?
it was not my people.
what are you looking for?
another way out.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Gibbs, put me on speaker.
why, Abbs?
because you're all in danger. Everyone needs to hear this.
McGee, put it on speaker.
Yeah, Abbs, you're on.
it's a trap.
you're headed straight into a massive terrorist plot.
that residue on Tony's pants?
it was pure glycerin.
distilled from perfumed soap.
Glycerin? As in nitroglycerin?
of course. Fight Club. Fincher. Pitt.
soap. Stuff blows up.
Yes, combining glycerin plus small amounts of drain cleaner and rust remover also found on the ship.
which contain sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phenol.
you add those four together, and you get TNP.
it's an old-school gunpowder used in World War I artillery shells.
can't be a very big bomb.
that's just the detonator.
the bomb is the 30, 000 gallons of fuel that we just put in the ship's gas tank.
and that's not the bad part. - Get to the bad part.
our ship in Norfolk is docked near two destroyers, a carrier and three frigates.
and they're all loaded down with munitions for deployment to the Middle East.
this blast and its chain reaction could take out half the Norfolk Naval Base.
are you okay?
what's going on?
Gibbs, it's one of the sons.
Rafiq. - Impossible.
gets worse.
NCIS! Don't move!
Hey, the bomb.
where is the bomb?
a bomb? Hakim hit me. I woke up here.
okay, why would a father lie about which son is the bad one?
so we'd leave the good one alone on the ship.
No! No son of mine could do this!
mother, it was Hakim! He had a gun. I saw him attack one of the guards.
I tried to stop him, but he attacked me.
open your eyes!
topside's clear, boss. McGee's coordinating a full evac with Naval Security, but...
okay, it's coming from below and astern.
that's the engine room.
get them off the ship now.
come on, let's go. - Come on.
wait. I cannot turn a blind eye anymore.
mariam, it is too late.
no, there is still a chance for me to do right by my children.
put down the wires, Hakim.
Hey, slowly.
mother...
I can see it with my own eyes.
yet I cannot believe this is what you have become.
not my son.
go away!
do you want to be like your father?
he was the only one who ever made sense of the violence back home.
he told me who is responsible.
and taught me to fight back.
he taught you to kill? The officer?
father shot the American officer.
otherwise they would not have brought the ship into port.
kept it here.
but now Father is gone.
so I must finish what we started.
Why?
Saraya!
what they did to her!
hakim, that was so very long ago.
she was my sister!
she was my daughter!
a daughter who I'll never get to watch grow.
a daughter who will never experience her mother's love!
my love!
you and your father are not the only ones who hurt!
but despite my grief, I still tried to teach you understanding, forgiveness, Hakim, love.
love.
how can you forgive those who deserve to be punished?
because this punishment does not accomplish anything, Hakim.
it will just take away another child from another mother who loves him.
son, do not leave me.
mother!
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
the State Department and the Lebanese government have denied any claim to Farid.
they want him to pay for what he's done.
the family?
mariam and Rafiq will be granted temporary visas.
hakim's agreed to give us information about his father's contacts.
nicely handled, Director.
I'm not so sure it was, Clayton.
are we talking as friends now?
Yeah.
we've known each other for a long time.
is there anything I can do for you? - I don't follow.
to make this easier-- your transition into this job.
you and Gibbs think I'm in over my head? You think I'm overcompensating?
I think you're having trouble letting go of bad habits.
this isn't my first rodeo, Leon.
Gibbs isn't my first cowboy.
I'm fine. - Okay.
but if I wasn't...
you can always come to me as a friend, Clayton.
no need.
perfect.
she's even a Le Cordon Bleu chef.
is it possible we've done something right for Gibbs?
what if it upsets the space-time continuum and sends the Earth hurtling towards the sun?
what's she doing up there?
boss, we found the perfect woman for you.
and we would like you to ask her out.
who?
dusty?
nice lady.
great cook.
did you read that on the screen?
no. I dated her.
so, what was wrong with her, boss?
nothing. She's perfect.
perfect? What happened?
there's nothing more boring than perfect.
Go-go-go home.
keep your phones on.
your team thinks you're lonely.
so, you lonely, Gibbs?
Nope.
Borin.
I'll be right there.
duty calls.
but, Gibbs, it has been fun.
sometimes people do the wrong things for the right reasons.
people always think their own reasons are right.
especially parents.
they got perspective.
parents still make mistakes.
Yeah.
My...mother...never told me what kind of a...man my father was.
perhaps she thought I was not strong enough to handle it.
Nah, she was just being a mom.
how do you know?
perspective.
are you lonely, Gibbs?
you're never alone when you have kids.
night, kid.
you know what you got there, Barrett? - Nope.
each phantom operative was tagged with a microchip, giving them access worldwide to the Watcher database.
EJ, who told you to come here tonight?
I thought you did.
so, who'd you shoot, Agent DiNozzo?
I need your help.
I don't know. Can't remember any of it.
special Agent Gibbs? Agent Stratton, FBI.
gentlemen, I intend to find out who Casey Stratton really is.
bureau doesn't know.
we got stills from hospital security, but he hasn't turned up on any database.
your girl's still missing?
unfortunately.
find Agent Barrett.
child abuse is what it is.
no more junk food at my house.
no more video games at mine.
stupid New Year's resolutions.
they make them, and we suffer.
I swear, I can't wait to grow up and move out of this puny old town.
nothing ever happens here anyway.
what?
come on.
you okay, mister?
no.
ah...no...
morning!
I never thought I'd end up being known as the cheerful one at the office.
wait, what?
are you saying we're not cheerful?
last couple weeks, I'd say more... I don't know... surly.
Surly?
surly you're Mc-staken.
didn't seem that way at the Navy District New Year's party.
gotcha!
cause I didn't even go to the Naval District New Year's Eve party.
neither did I. - Then I rest my case.
since when do either of you ever miss a party?
also known as the holiday blues.
pre and post. Not at all uncommon.
that'll do, Dr. Phil.
I don't suppose you heard anything from C. I.Ray over the holidays, did you?
what about you?
weren't you supposed to visit your old flame in Baltimore?
Wendy. Yes.
something came up.
told you to stifle, Edith.
I don't have the blues, I just have the blahs, you know?
every time New Year's comes around, just kind of... whack.
I don't know.
well, only you can do something about that, Tony.
change, my dear, requires some action.
this coming from a woman who's been waiting eight weeks for a single, solitary phone call from one lousy dude.
seven.
and maybe I'm done waiting.
maybe it's finally time we both took some action.
maybe... - No time for maybes.
got a dead Naval officer.
there's nothing maybe about that. Let's go.
to be continued? - Maybe.
one gunshot wound to the neck, one to the chest that I can see.
given the angle of entry, both were fired from the commander's immediate right.
Ergo,"riding shotgun."
too easy?
too surly.
navy Commander James Barnsway, 35.
those kids were first on the scene.
said they heard a loud screech of tires and then the crash.
passenger door's open.
well, they didn't see any passenger.
there are no bullet casings in the truck.
lack of stippling on this wound would indicate a distance greater than the passenger seat.
passenger window's open.
what are you thinking, DiNozzo?
it's more like what I'm not seeing, boss.
there's no skid marks here for the pickup, which means he ran full steam into that car.
kids said they heard a tire screech; probably came from those skid marks right there. Hmm?
alongside.
making it possible the shots were fired from a second vehicle.
Yeah, that was kind of my point.
more than possible.
had to be riding high to get that angle.
hell of a shot.
the boys didn't hear any shots fired. Just the crash.
well, then a hell of a shot with a silencer.
on it, boss.
I'm the one who called the police.
but you have to understand, I'm not one for getting involved.
but you did see the crash?
no, heard it.
what exactly did you see?
well - Yes, yeah, go right there.
I got to the window just as that other car was speeding off.
what kind of car was that?
one of those SUVs.
blue.
Oh, no, wait.
uh, it was green.
or gold.
did you hear anything like gunshots?
Oh, Lord, no.
I can't imagine that girl would have got out of Jimmy's truck if there'd been gunshots.
there was a girl?
pretty blond.
ran off into the woods over there.
or maybe it was red.
Oh, the SUV, not her hair.
that was definitely blond.
ish.
well... So, you know the commander?
Jimmy, yes.
man is a war hero.
he didn't look too good.
is he gonna be all right?
what about the girl? You know her, too?
no, but I will tell you, it wasn't Mrs. Jimmy.
not that I'm one for getting involved.
so, the commander has a wife?
Oh, Cara, yes.
sings in our church choir.
poor Cara.
it'll pain me so to have to tell her.
I'm really not one for... - Getting involved. Yes, we know, we know.
we'll save you the trouble.
it's no trouble.
I can give Cara a call right now. Really, I can.
we'd rather you didn't, ma'am.
not until we know what color SUV she drives.
or how good a shot she is.
Really?
Jimmy's been defending this country his whole life.
for this to happen now, at home, in our little town...
I'm sorry to have to ask, Mrs. Barnsway, but we're gonna need to confirm your whereabouts this morning.
me?
you think I'd kill my husband?
we have reports that an SUV was observed leaving the scene.
so just because I drive an SUV?
also, that the commander did not die alone.
there may have been a woman with him.
Oh, my God.
of course.
is that what this is?
is-is she dead, too?
you know about her?
she called before breakfast.
Oh, God, what was her name?
um, she was an old friend of Jimmy's.
some Navy connection overseas from years ago.
did he say where she was calling from?
I don't know.
not far. He was going to bring her home.
she needed his help.
help with what?
I doubt Jimmy even asked.
he just... dropped everything and ran out.
one thing about my husband:
he would, he would do anything for a friend.
commander James Barnsway.
a 14-year veteran, recently assigned as a training officer at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.
previous deployments are all over the globe:
iraq, Bahrain, Gitmo, Sao Paolo, Naples.
Naples?
Yeah. As in Italy, Tony, not Florida.
navy has a base there, DiNozzo.
of course.
Yeah, no, I just, I, I thought I... misheard.
uh, call to the commander's cell this morning came from a burn phone.
no way to trace it, but I'm looking for...
I'm looking for where it was purchased.
enemies?
none that we know of, but the commander did have a reputation for being a hard-nosed commanding officer.
any complaints filed against him?
I'll find out.
Abbs. Yeah, you were my next stop, honest.
so, Naples, huh?
what about it?
I hear the pizza's great.
Tony. - It was nothing, guys. Really.
nothing.
nothing.
no telling markers, no striations.
they're both nine-millimeter.
a Glock, a Beretta maybe.
silencer fits both.
which explains the lack of a bang.
did you get any prints off the brass?
Nope.
we're dealing with a really careful killer here, Gibbs.
there were no prints, no residue, no nothing.
can't use nothing, Abbs.
well, then let's get to the something.
the memory on the pickup's GPS was damaged during the collision, so it's displaying this crazy spaghetti pattern at the moment.
Mmm, spaghetti, meatballs.
garlic bread. Mmm, garlic bread.
Abby. - Sorry.
I have to stop working through my lunch.
anyways, I was able to work backwards from where the pickup crashed, try to retrace its steps or its spins, or whatever tires do, and we get this.
it's sort of like a reverse Pac-Man or like working a maze from the end.
go to where it starts.
486 Overpass Lane.
also known as the Highway 12 Motor Lodge.
it's just a few miles out of town.
that's not nothing.
no, that's something.
just like you, Abbs.
whoever was in that room got out of there in a hurry.
sorry I did not see her leave.
I assure you I had no idea the lady was in any kind of trouble.
you have her credit card on file?
no, sir, she paid cash.
still, she must have shown you some form of I. D.
I'm embarrassed to say no.
uh, she was so terribly pleasant.
like one of those Star Wars Jedi people.
Uh,you do not need to see my I. D.
um... it was late, I was tired.
you too tired to even get her name?
Oh, no, no, no, I made sure she signed in.
it's always good to know the name of whatever serial killer you might be harboring.
she's a serial killer?
she is Belva Lockwood.
and all she needed for a room was cash, a name and a smile?
to be honest, it was double cash, three nights in advance.
times are hard.
Belva Lockwood, the first female to run for president.
1884.0
in what movie did you learn that?
I read a book once.
that mean something to you?
well, it just sounds like an alias.
you have a security camera around here somewhere?
these are beyond blurry, Gibbs.
there's not much enhancing I can do here, boss.
can you try streaming them again?
we are lucky to have streamed them the first time, McGee.
equipment over here is not exactly state of the art.
but we do keep the sheets clean.
ABBY: I might have software in my lab that can help us with this.
whatever you can do, Abbs.
if we saw this woman leave with the commander...
we should be able to see when she came back to the hotel.
hold it.
time code-- only half an hour ago.
then she leaves again... five minutes later.
which way?
well, if I was looking to get out of Dodge in a hurry with no car...
...I just might look to hitch the closest ride I could find.
not bad.
I know, right?
it's like a computer chemical peel.
let's buff out the blemishes and smooth out the skin.
it's like a regular digital face-lift.
how do I look?
uncomfortable.
got anything?
manager says a woman in a red jacket came in ten minutes ago looking for a ride.
and she just got one.
tanker truck.
there.
stop!
get out of the truck.
hands where we can see them!
don't shoot!
I just met the lady.
get out of the truck now!
um... maybe you should give Gibbs a call?
tell him we've got an I. D.
Hi, guys.
you're alive.
hungry, Barrett?
not anymore. Thanks.
so this has been it for you?
on the lam, running town to town?
since they killed Cade, yeah.
you left me lying on the ground in an alleyway.
I thought you were dead, too, Tony. - You thought?
it was days before I found out you were okay.
much to my relief. - Didn't stop you from running, did it?
I wasn't running, Tony.
I was on the run.
Oh, there's a distinction.I wasn't running. I...
I was on the run. - You were running.
enough.
you know that we were there for you, right?
I didn't know anything, Gibbs.
except that I needed answers and couldn't count on anyone else to give them to me.
not even us?
not without putting you in danger again.
so you were protecting us?!
and trying to find out who killed Cade before they killed me.
you were protecting yourself! - Yes!
Hey, will you stop it?!
you were wearing a vest that night, right?
same one I wore this morning.
and lucky I did, too.
not so lucky for Barnsway.
I never should have called him.
why did you?
I'd been up in Jersey a month or so before they got onto me.
I guess I'd been on my own so long... I don't know.
I needed a friend.
they? You keep saying "they," Barrett.
who's "they"?
who's this?
he's the guy who killed Cade.
posed as FBI. Name is Stratton.
this isn't who shot at me this morning.
this... This isn't who killed Jim. - You sure?
I saw the shooter up close, Tony.
I know his face, and that is not it.
take her down to Abby.
what for? - Go.
and there she goes.
we're running your shooter through every possible database we have access to.
not a bad rendering, Abby.
think we captured his essence?
we'll see if it captures him.
so, you're absolutely positive that's your shooter, huh?
if I imagine him pointing a gun in my face.
Yeah, Tony, close enough.
this might take a while.
nowhere else to be.
okey, okey, then.
I'm just gonna, um... I'll be...
in there... if you need me.
so?
so... I had the craziest feeling when I saw your buddy Barnsway had been stationed in Naples.
cause you always raved about Naples.
birthplace of the pizza.
wasn't until I saw that the first female presidential candidate- 1884
had been checked into a roadside motel, that I got a gut feeling.
you remembered Belva Lockwood?
how could I forget?
that was some night.
you going on and on about how cool you thought Belva was.
you know, I've noticed something about you, EJ.
you have a tendency to disappear.
consequently, I spent a lot of time looking for you.
a lot... of time.
so you didn't think you could reach out?
I was scared, Tony.
hell, I don't even know why he's after me.
it's not like I could identify him.
looks like you just did.
with all due respect for what she has been through, Tony, how could EJ think that living off the griddle is a better option than having us protect her?
that's living off the grid, Ziva.
and, uh, Tony, you got to admit, the whole thing is a little bit fishy.
spare me your conspiracy theories, all right?
you're preaching to the choir.
we simply do not want to see you get hurt.
again.
I can handle myself.
I'll be the judge of that.
go.
former Captain Marcellus Dane, 41 years old, 23 missions with the SEALs in Iraq before being dishonorably discharged at General Court-Martial in '05.
our records indicate that it had something to do with accepting bribes from private contractors.
which is no surprise, since he was then hired by the same contractors to be a weapons specialist.
he's an expert in handguns.
known to carry a Beretta M9, both on and off the battlefield.
same type of weapon used on Barnsway.
it is possible, given the commander's travels, that he and Dane crossed paths in Iraq at some point.
and not in a very good way.
maybe Dane had his own reason for going after the commander.
no offense, Ziva.
that is a plausible theory, but that man was shooting at me.
you have to take my word for it. - Why?
Dane have an address?
Yeah. Last known is in Seattle, but he does have a cell phone that just rebooted in downtown DC.
just pinged a signal from an industrial apartment loft at Gentry and 7th.
so much for our careful killer.
does seem a bit careless for a seasoned paramilitary operative.
Yeah, a little too careless.
let's be ready for anything.
let's? Barrett, let's?
like you and us?
well, I can't stay here, Gibbs.
Oh, sure you can. Watch this.
keep her here.
me?
but I'm the one he's after.
all the more reason not to take a target along.
boss, there's no way. I cannot...
DiNozzo, make that two targets.
if Stratton's behind that guy, then both of you need to sit tight.
okay, okay, move it on back, folks.
there's nothing to see.
NCIS. - Go on through.
people seem to die wherever Marcellus Dane goes.
I'll check the building.
don't bother.
he's right here.
cops say this happened just a few minutes ago.
stabbed and then tossed.
the phone signal.
whoever did this wanted us to see it.
I got a pretty good idea who.
all right.
Mr. Secretary.
special Agent Gibbs.
sorry to interrupt, sir.
you got a minute?
we're just finishing up. Can it wait?
or would you care to join us? - Neither, sir. Nothing personal.
excuse me, gentlemen.
give us a minute?
need a favor, Mr. Secretary.
Oh, guess I better listen then.
I need you to talk to Sean Latham.
Why?
because we may have a bead on Casey Stratton.
Gibbs, the FBI takes imposters very seriously.
they have a task force solely focused on... - Not about the FBI, sir.
phantom Eight. Ring a bell?
Yeah.
it came up in discussions when Agent DiNozzo was injured.
clandestine unit associated with the Watcher Fleet. Classified.
does that mean that Stratton is classified, too?
you're saying this is him?
Stratton killed Cade, sir.
he tried to kill DiNozzo and Barrett.
agent Barrett is M. I.A. - Not any longer.
she's in a safe house with DiNozzo on Old Rag Mountain.
that's good news.
you're the one who brought Latham into this, sir.
he saw the hospital surveillance.
he should have recognized Stratton.
maybe. Perhaps.
but we don't even know if they're in contact anymore.
with all due respect, sir, this son of a bitch had a locator chip in his arm.
Latham knows how to find him.
Latham needs to bring him in.
the game was great, Boss.
Yeah.
we won, of course.
how'd yours go?
Oh, it's not until tomorrow, huh?
forgot about that.
okay, well, we'll let you know how that goes.
we're just gonna do a little bit of tailgating.
and maybe crack a cold one.
good luck tomorrow.
heard a lot of code in my day.
that, my friend, ranks among some of the lamest.
what's lame about a couple guys talking sports?
besides, we don't know if these phones have been compromised.
at least now we know that Jarvis is on board.
when's the last time anyone tidied up around here?
well, it's called a safe house, not a tidy house.
I know it's a far cry from the luxurious truck stop motor lodge you've been staying in.
at least I can't do any more damage here.
not really where I was going with it, but okay.
can you blame me for feeling responsible?
I mean, first Levin, then Cade, then... Jimmy Barnsway.
God, his poor wife must be heartbroken.
well, if it helps, she said her husband would do anything for a friend.
doesn't help, but thanks anyway.
you should cut yourself some slack, EJ.
what's the saying?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger.
I think Nietzsche said that.
important thing to remember about Friedrich Nietzsche, of course, is that he died in an insane asylum.
this is probably not the best way to start a pep talk, huh?
listen, we all have regrets.
I've made mistakes.
a couple of doozies.
as for your mistakes...
sleep tight, Agent Barrett.
Mr. Secretary.
Sean, thanks for coming on such short notice.
I assumed we'd be meeting in Director Vance's office.
Yeah, there's more than one SCIF, sir.
why don't you have a seat?
agent Gibbs.
guess that leaves you in charge.
me? No. SECNAV can hold his own.
I don't doubt that.
I know everything there is to know about my team, sir.
do you?
blast from the past.
where the hell'd you get it?
I found it in a box.
Mr. Secretary, this is classified material.
you know this guy?
pretty obvious I used to.
you never thought to mention knowing him a few months ago?
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary, is there something I'm missing here?
you said nothing when Stratton came to the hospital looking to gun down my best agent.
hold on, you think this is him?
are you saying it's not?
gentlemen, this is Captain Jonathan Cole.
former Army Green Beret.
I recruited him into the Phantom program in '03.
afraid you've got the wrong man.
wrong name, maybe. Right man.
is it possible, Sean?
absolutely not.
Cole's a good man and a highly-trained operative.
trained to kill.
he gunned down an NCIS agent; now he's trying to get rid of everybody who saw him do it.
you know that for a fact?
agent DiNozzo made that ID under physical and mental duress.
you're not denying knowing him, right, Sean?
of course not. - Then let me talk to him.
contact Cole, tell him we'd like to arrange a meeting.
tell him the Secretary of the Navy would like a moment of his time.
look, if I could reach Cole, what's our timetable?
soon.
two of his targets are living in a safe house.
it's less safe the longer he's out there.
make it happen, Sean.
rise to the occasion.
I'll do what I can.
uh... Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!
room service.
easy, Lion.
tiger. Easy, Tiger.
you could have called.
my cell phone does not like these mountains, apparently.
why are you drooling?
is that what I hope it is?
coffee.
and muffins with jam.
you know, Ziva, everything Tony told me about you when we first met
absolutely not true.
what?
I never... said that she didn't like coffee.
how did everyone sleep last night?
I slept in the chair. She slept on the couch.
that's not what I was asking.
well, considering that I slept vertically,
I'm gonna see if a little hot water can loosen up my lower extremities.
excuse me, ladies.
if this goes on another night, I'll make sure he takes the couch.
Gibbs met with Latham, but don't plan on leaving here anytime soon.
I have something else for you.
after you went missing, Gibbs had me access your secure work e-mail for possible leaks.
should I prepare to be embarrassed?
not at all.
these are from your mother.
I was not sure if you... had reached out to her recently.
not in months.
I didn't want my parents to be in danger.
thank you for this.
nothing you would not do for me, I'm sure.
well, so much for my big plans, huh?
what about your plans, Ziva?
beyond NCIS?
a family?
maybe someday.
though that day seems increasingly distant at the moment.
to someday. - Hmm?
someday.
Hey, boy.
what's his name?
Mr. Christian.
not a very trustworthy name for man's best friend.
you realize the position you've put me in?
they've made the connection, Cole.
they want me to set you up.
so? - Do it.
it might actually expedite matters.
or blow up in our faces.
it's already blown up in mine.
I've got nothing to lose.
and therein lies the problem.
our business affiliation, selling the microchips, was very profitable.
it's all behind us now.
you know perfectly well I can't proceed beyond the assignment until it's complete.
