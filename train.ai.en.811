Dr. Jeffrey macdonald was convicted of murdering his family.
supposedly he left messages to convince authorities that hippies had done it.
uh, we spoke to the neighbors.
apparently cynthia was gone all evening.
no one knows where she was or when she came home.
seems she's quiet, kept to herself.
the unsub could have followed her home or been waiting for her here.
Hotch, take a look at this.
the cd player was left on.
you are about to embark on the greatest adventure known to man.
that adventure is your own life.
she was there before she was murdered.
so where is Mr. Flynn now?
you haven't told me what this is about yet.
check the vari-lights.
there was a weird shadow last night.
we need information about these people.
do you recognize them?
not him.
but her, yeah.
she was at the show last night.
she was one of the guests that got a one-on-one with barry afterwards.
and how would someone get that?
people who buy advance tickets fill out a questionnaire.
Barry randomly selects 5 and mentions them by name during the show.
it's pretty mind-blowing to the people who are picked.
we can imagine.
tell me, what goes on during one of these one-on-ones?
just mini life-coaching sessions.
it's only about 15 minutes, but people come out transformed.
and did cynthia look transformed?
probably.
but I didn't actually see her.
she was barry's last client.
he showed her out himself.
Flynn was probably the last person to see her alive.
Wait-she's dead?
she was murdered.
so let me ask you again, where's barry flynn?
I don't know.
he needs private time to rest and focus his mind.
it's part of his routine on show days.
but you're his manager.
you can't get ahold of him? - Sorry.
to make sure he's not interrupted, no one knows where he goes.
not me. Not his family. Not anyone.
it's always been like that.
well, if you had to take a guess, where do you think he'd be?
he books a hotel room or an apartment in every tour city.
he's probably there.
he's always back in time for the show.
what time did barry leave?
last night.
it was a little later than usual.
want some company?
sure.
I haven't seen you here before.
I'm just visiting.
lucky you.
nice weather for a change.
I was hoping for rain.
more romantic.
I'm ricky.
have you seen the sights?
space needle, pike's place market, the aquarium?
the first two, yes, the aquarium, no.
want a tour guide? - Why not?
we confirmed flynn's been mia since his private meeting with cynthia strobl, which officially makes him a suspect.
well, he's a point of convergence between the victims.
Lincoln bell had a program personally autographed by flynn in his apartment, so we know they met.
Yeah. Flynn was one of the last people, if not the last person to see cynthia strobl alive.
Hey, garcia.
you're on speaker. What do you got?
the 4-double-1 on barry flynn.
Hey, has anyone been listening to this "unlimited courage," 'cause it's pretty amazing.
I've just finished the first cd and I've already signed up for kickboxing class, and I painted a wall in my apartment white.
which is a risky color in my world.
Garcia. - Oh, sorry.
uh, well, barry flynn's is actually a stage name.
what's his real name?
his real name is harold kerwin.
although he never legally changed it, though.
he was raised in reno, nevada.
he went to a 2-year community college.
he got married right after.
he has a couple of assault charges for some bar fights.
and then he worked for 12 years as a car salesman before he left the rat race.
how so?
he checked out, like quit his job, got a divorce, ran off to live in the desert.
came back 3 years later and he was barry flynn.
he started talking at schools and local clubs, built up this following, became sort of an overnight sensation.
within 3 years he was selling out 1, 000-seat venues.
any idea what happened to him in those 3 years while he was in the desert?
well, according to flynn, he meditated a lot, until his true gift was revealed to him.
I hate to admit it, but it sounds pretty vague to me.
Thanks.
never would've guessed he had a prior assault conviction.
he could be our guy.
chen.
Flynn had the means and the opportunity.
I'm just not clear about the motive.
we all know that public figures like politicians can have psychopathic tendencies and the ability to hide it.
but it doesn't make any sense that he'd kill his own paying customers.
and why start here, in seattle?
why leave the bizarre message at the crime scenes?
well, flynn's obviously a native english speaker, so, if he is the unsub, then the message could be indicative of some sort of delusion or psychosis.
that is possible given the ceremonial knife that was used.
you know, no history of recent head trauma.
he's too old to have suffered a traditional schizophrenic break.
maybe a drug-induced psychosis?
no. Flynn's clean as a whistle.
doesn't even eat dairy according to his bio.
well, as a celebrity, he has a vested interest in a clean image.
but who was he, really?
Flynn's rental car was just located outside a bar in alki.
how did you end up where you are today.
was it a conscious choice?
or does it feel like you had no control in the matter?
you made me do this, barry flynn.
I guess we know how he was spending his "private time.
too bad he couldn't be open about it.
he's probably afraid it would hurt his public image.
it's the same blood type as flynn's.
we're running a dna test.
we also found this.
it's a 100-decibel personal alarm.
Flynn's manager said he always carried it with him, for protection.
Flynn's not the unsub, he's a victim.
he felt threatened enough to be holding the alarm, dropped it when the unsub clocked him and took him away in another vehicle.
no surveillance cameras.
guess the customers like their privacy.
so, what, did flynn meet the unsub in the bar?
probably.
no one inside noticed anything unusual, so they came out together voluntarily.
maybe flynn had a change of heart and the unsub got angry.
we talked to the staff.
none of them remember even seeing flynn.
well, he'd probably wear a disguise if he wanted to be anonymous in public.
so the unsub didn't know who he was?
maybe not. But the m. o.'s different here.
Flynn wasn't blitz attacked at home like the others.
what if flynn was the ultimate target and the others were used to get information on him?
or maybe the other victims got in the way.
we could be looking at an extreme fan.
Yeah, someone could have followed him here.
most of the workers and stagehands in flynn's company are volunteers.
so he'd be surrounded by fanatics.
he'd be watching his every move.
well, let's just hope it was one of them who nabbed him. - why?
because then there's a chance he's still alive.
the greatest gift is inside you already.
it's always been there, a constant companion.
when I heard that, I finally understood that I had to use my gift.
when I was a kid, I used to talk about it, until people said that I sounded weird.
and I hated it because it made me different.
and I tried to shut it off, but I didn't want to - What did you do to me?
you wouldn't come with me, and I had to do what I needed to do to get you to listen.
listen to what?
4 months ago, I was fired.
couldn't get another job.
I was an unemployed, middle-aged loser with no prospects.
I almost killed myself.
then I found you.
what's your name?
Carl, I can see that you're in pain.
I'm not. I feel alive.
like-like electricity is running through me.
can you take these off?
I won't try to escape.
I promise. I'm here for you.
you're lying. I don't blame you.
I just need you to hear me out until I know that you're convinced.
convinced of what?
that I'm your biggest success story.
while we initially thought barry flynn might be a suspect, it turns out we're looking for one of his followers.
an unsub who suffers from erotomania.
he's obsessed with flynn, his latest abductee, and he may believe that flynn's also in love with him.
erotomania has very little to do with sex.
it's a romantic or spiritual connection that erotomanics crave.
victims of the delusion tend to be from a higher social status and have done very little to stimulate or encourage such a belief.
in fact, it's likely the unsub and barry flynn have had no previous contact.
his infatuation probably began from afar, considering flynn's celebrity status.
the patience required to commit his crimes makes us believe he's a male in his late 30s to 40s who is single and socially immature.
he's a loner with poor social skills.
and although he is capable of holding down a job, he most likely neglects his duties to focus on his obsession.
this is a guy who spends much of his time living in his delusional fantasy world.
and he may have been tracking flynn for quite some time.
and with erotomania, the most likely recipient of violence is the person standing in the way of the desired object.
it's possible the unsub witnessed an interaction between his two first victims and flynn, killing them in a jealous rage.
another possibility is that the unsub killed them to prove his devotion.
the weapon used had a ceremonial quality to it.
which means the unsub probably views these victims as sacrifices, and the messages he is leaving may be meant for flynn.
in his head, he may believe that he's already involved in a personal relationship with flynn.
and now that flynn is under his control, this situation is especially precarious.
if the unsub is under the delusion that flynn also cares about him, then any misstep by flynn that contradicts that belief, could lead to more victims or even flynn's own murder, to prove they have a special bond.
with each passing hour, it's increasingly unlikely that flynn will be able to match the unsub's expectations for him.
so we must act quickly. Thank you.
I've ignored my gift for so long.
what is your gift?
I don't hear things the way most people do.
I see it.
what does that mean?
well, when people talk, I know the truth about them.
you know the truth.
like I knew you were lying when you said you wouldn't try to escape.
a doctor told my parents that there was a wire crossed in my brain.
it's harmless. Kind of like a birthmark.
but thanks to you, I know he was wrong.
how so?
because it's more than a birthmark.
I got this ability for a reason, and what I need to do is take action, and that's what you've been telling me.
what are you planning to do, carl?
let me show you.
we said that this unsub had poor social skills, so how did he lure flynn out of the bar?
good question.
maybe he had help from someone with more charisma.
well, we should amend the profile, let the media know that there may be a temporary partner involved.
all right, I'll call garcia and get her to narrow the list of seminar attendees.
Hey, baby girl.
if loving you is wrong, baby boy, I don't want to be right.
well, likewise, mama.
I need you to look into fans of barry flynn.
Oh, I already have those numbers for you.
he has over two million fans worldwide, and the kind that are crazy infatuated with him, I would say about 100, 000.
Hey, do you know that if you join barry's official circle of friends, you get the "unlimited courage" 12-cd set for 49. 99, plus a free "live or die, you choose" mug.
come on, don't tell me you joined.
no. Why would you say that?
I didn't-I didn't do that.
there's just things I need motivation for.
like I had that cupcake problem, and I really wanted to learn how to play the clarinet.
and barry flynn is a good guy who really helps people, and I want you to find him.
we're doing our best, girl.
by the way, totally different subject
I happened upon that invitation guest list for the british embassy thing.
did you know that madonna and stephen hawking are going?
not together, but they're going.
seriously, you're gonna miss a chance to meet stephen hawking?
Reid will kill you.
well, then I'm dead.
why don't you want to go?
it's personal. How about that?
Oh, it's per - Oh, my god, it's personal?
that never occurred to me that it would be personal.
I thought is was like stock market related or 'cause of the weather.
will you cut it out, already.
OK. Keep your super secrets to yourself, 007.
look, just do me a favor.
find out how many of flynn's uberfans live in seattle.
then I want you to narrow it down even more by cross-referencing with people with anger management issues.
Yeah, derek - thank you and goodbye, garcia.
Hello?
what are you doing here, carl?
uh, I was missing a personal photo. Thought maybe I left it here.
your cubicle was cleaned out when you were fired.
what do you really want?
you made a big mistake when you fired me.
I mean-I don't have a gun, it that's what you're worried about.
and I just wondered why you did it.
Oh, come on, you know why.
I was getting complaints about you.
customers are never happy.
you yelled at them.
and you scared your co-workers.
they thought you were seeing things half the time.
just like you are now.
what are you even looking at?
it's unsettling.
we were worried about you.
it's not that you're a bad person, but this just isn't the right place for you, carl.
I'm sure there's another job you'd be much happier doing.
you've always been envious of me, haven't you?
I threaten you in some way.
OK, whatever.
look, you're gonna have to go.
he came forward when he saw our statement to the media.
someone paid him 200 bucks to bring barry flynn out of the bar into the parking lot.
what happened in the parking lot?
I don't know.
I told flynn to wait for me, that I left my keys in the bar and that I'd be right back.
was that part of the plan?
Yeah. But I never came back outside again, so
now, you said the guy that paid you was a little weird.
how so?
he couldn't look at me when he talked, and he kept yapping about a magnificent light.
I got them.
transcripts of the calls I handled and the customers' addresses.
let me go.
you gotta let me go, carl.
Oh, no, no, no.
no, we're just getting started.
do you remember how I said how I felt alive, like electricity was coursing through me?
well, I felt this way once before when I was 10.
I had this dream that I was a superhero, and I had this partner, and together we killed evil people with this powerful knife.
well, I'm going to kill these evil people.
help! Somebody, help!
damn it!
why do you keep resisting me?!
you awoke this gift in me.
you of all people should understand that we have to do this mission together.
why was there so much overkill on the two victims?
they were threats to the unsub's imaginary relationship with flynn.
they hardly knew flynn.
I mean, at least 4 other people had private meetings with him.
he gave autographs to at least a dozen others.
why those two?
well, it's not reality based.
his delusional mind exaggerated the relationships they had with flynn.
maybe he's not driven by jealousy.
what if the overkill was to make doubly sure that they were dead and couldn't come back to life?
the way you'd want to kill a monster in a horror movie.
exactly. Maybe he saw them as evil
that could explain the messages on the wall.
where are we?
Janet dodd's house.
she's evil and we need to stop her.
Carl, you're making a big mistake.
I'm just doing what you told me to.
I'm taking action.
you misunderstood me.
now stop this before it's too late.
you do not want blood on your hands.
what's so funny?! - You are.
I've already killed two already.
it's been in the news.
OK, she's alone now.
tell the police if you think she's evil.
no, no, no.
the police won't do a damn thing.
no, I was in a bar once and I saw a guy who was the epitome of evil, and I called the police to tell them, and they hung up on me.
and then 6 hours later, a mother and her baby were killed when someone tried to carjack them.
and I know it was him.
I could have saved them.
don't worry.
you just watch.
ready?
No!
hear your red, see your red.
well, somehow it makes sense to him.
the unsub is clearly devolving.
Yeah, the letters are shakier.
this message is less controlled than the others.
I agree. The word "evil" was replaced by "red,
which means "red" could have been from his unconscious, a freudian slip, so to speak.
but what does it mean?
is it something specific to this victim?
got divorced two years ago, she lived here alone, worked as a paralegal.
any known enemies?
perhaps the ex-husband?
uh, not according to her sister.
the husband left janet.
any connection to flynn?
doesn't seem to be.
in fact her sister was trying to get her to move on with her life, but janet seemed completely unmotivated.
the unsub didn't pick her because of her connection to flynn, then.
then why did he choose her?
somehow their paths must have crossed.
well, she didn't get out much.
only went to work and then back home.
we're pulling her phone records, see who she talked to last.
she's got a lot of overdue bills.
uh, yeah, her sister said she was struggling financially.
she cut up a credit card that wasn't expired.
Why?
people often do when they're trying to rein in their spending.
psychologically it's harder to part with cash.
the phone logs.
a lot of calls recently to the same 800 number.
welcome to luxor bank cards.
Hey, watch it.
what's your problem, man?
you blind or something? huh?
you're lucky I'm busy today.
OK. There we go.
there. Take a sip.
come on. - no.
come on, you'll feel better. Come on.
what do you want with me, carl?
isn't it obvious?
we're partners.
we're destined to fight evil together.
we're not p...
when does the mission end? - Never.
this is only the beginning.
I don't think I realized how serious you were, carl.
you really want to change the world, don't you?
you have the conviction of a superhero.
I believe that now.
come on, uncuff me.
I won't run. I promise.
when we got to our next target.
I knew you'd come around.
go ahead, garcia.
OK, so I cross-referenced barry flynn fans with people who had anger management issues and luxor bank got one hit.
he worked as a customer service rep at the call center there.
he was fired 4 months ago.
what are the chances that he spoke to janet dodd on the phone?
Oh, the chances are 100%, because she called that center at least 20 times in the last year, and carl answered at least 3 of those calls.
what was the anger management issue?
Oh, apparently one of his co-workers filed a complaint after carl got super mad at her over god knows what and threatened her but good.
he was fired a month later.
I am sending you his address now.
OK, so getting fired was his stressor, and barry flynn's seminar was his trigger somehow.
if he's stalking credit card customers, we need to find out who he spoke to.
a good point.
take blake and reid and go to the workplace.
the rest of us will go to the house. Let's go.
some of his co-workers thought he was mentally ill.
when someone suggested he get help, he went off, practically threatened to kill her.
what did you think?
something wasn't right.
I mean, you'd be talking to him and he wouldn't even be looking at you.
he'd be looking around you.
was it like he was hallucinating?
Yeah. He started getting weird with the customers and going off script, and, you know, I had to fire him.
going off script in what ways?
we have a set algorithm of questions depending on what the customer's calling about.
we review transcripts regularly, and carl was perfectly fine with some customers.
but with others, he'd be verbally abusive for no reason.
clear.
it's clear!
there's nobody here.
Hey, you guys, look at this knife.
is this who carl finster thinks he is?
why does my card keep getting rejected?
I've been paying the minimum balance on time.
you were 5 days late in your april payment, so you're a liar.
what?
did you just call me a liar?
I know who you are, howard jephson.
I can see your words.
OK, you know what?
I want to talk to your supervisor.
you are rotten to the core!
you don't deserve any more credit!
see what I was dealing with?
Carl was attacking certain customers for no reason.
why did he come back last night?
well, at first I thought he came here to shoot up the place.
but now I think it was to steal the recordings of his calls.
we confirmed he downloaded a file.
wait a minute, guys. He told the caller he could see his words.
and you said he acted like he was hallucinating?
I think I might know what's wrong with him.
he has synesthesia.
it's a neurological phenomenon in which two or more senses are triggered simultaneously.
for instance, someone might associate specific numbers with colors or even be able to taste music.
I think carl has the form of synesthesia in which he can literally see the words that people are speaking.
hence the message he left - "hear your evil, see your evil.
it looks like he transcribed conversations he had with people in different colors of ink.
green, orange, red.
well, these are not happy conversations.
Reid, we can see here that each of the colors mean something different to him.
white words mean the speaker is good.
it looks like the orange ink means the speaker's a liar.
you know, maybe he sees people's word in different colors depending on what type of person he thinks they are.
what's the content of the red ones?
Oh, they're angry.
he accuses them of being evil.
and so he sees their words in red.
hear your red, see your red.
he might believe it's a super power.
it looks like he tried to stop the synesthesia by wearing tinted glasses.
the fact is, we know his latest victim was a customer he spoke to.
his old boss says he came in last night and stole a copy of the recordings.
the only reason is to compile a list of people he considers evil.
exactly. The hit list.
and he's got all their addresses and vital information.
get in the house, now.
Oh, my god.
you're the guy on the news.
do as he says.
get in the house!
shut up!
Howard jephson, I know who you really are.
I'm not howard jephson.
no games.
not if you want your family to live.
I'm telling you the truth.
we're just renting the house.
my name is stephen caldwell.
we never even met howard.
we just saw his name on the lease agreement.
we made a mistake.
let's go.
listen, if you leave now, we won't call the police.
Carl, what the hell!
he lied to us.
his words turned orange.
now, hand me the knife.
it's the wrong guy.
I said hand me the knife!
OK. Give me the gun.
wait. Say that again.
give me the gun.
he's got 150 names in the seattle area.
he could be going after any one of them.
Garcia, any way to narrow it down to callers in the city.
OK, that gives us 32.
was janet dodd the first name alphabetically of those 32?
no, she was the ninth.
so he's not going alphabetically.
how else would you organize a hit list?
maybe time a contact.
he started with the first person he spoke to.
no, because he talked to janet dodd the last day he was employed.
he's going in reverse order.
the ones he talked to most recently would be freshest in his mind.
Garcia, take the last callers and find out which ones live closest to janet dodd.
OK, I got two names that are about the same distance from her.
ranga patel and howard jephson.
all right, you two take blake and go to howard jephson.
the rest of us will go to the patel house.
how did you do that?
do what?
how did you hide your true nature for so long?
enough, carl.
listen to me.
listen to me carefully.
you are not a victim of circumstance.
you are a creature of free will.
take the right action.
let this family go.
no one goes anywhere.
I know that you don't feel in control right now.
you don't know how you ended up here, and it feels like there's no way out.
but there is a way out.
I can help you.
you think I'll believe anything you say anymore?
you and I have a special bond, carl.
I know this isn't you.
you don't know anything about me.
FBI! Drop it!
he's evil!
I can see it.
all right, come on, let's go.
we know what's going on, carl.
you've had a special talent your whole life, haven't you?
it's my gift.
Barry flynn here unleashed that, carl.
how can you hurt a man who's given you so much?
he changed!
I saw red.
what do you see when we speak?
we know that you called the police last year, and you warned them about a man.
they ignored me.
they ignored me and then he killed a mother and her baby.
it wasn't him.
the man you warned them about was questioned, but it wasn't him.
they found the real killer a week later and he confessed.
Carl, your gift is not reliable.
it's just a reflection on how you feel about other people, but, carl, it's not who they really are.
if you kill this man, you'll be destroying a magnificent light.
think about it.
put the weapons down.
the mystery of human existence "lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for." Fyodor dostoevsky.
I encourage you not to be mad at me.
I did a little research about jason ryder, and I found out that he was your father's old partner at the chicago p. d.
so I'm assuming that there was some sort of falling out?
no, garcia.
Jason moved to new york after my father died.
he was a hero on 9/11.
that's why he's being honored.
so what's the problem?
years ago, I was supposed to talk about my father at the fallen law enforcement memorial.
I got up to the podium, then I froze.
you had stage fright.
no. It wasn't that at all.
well, there's the obvious remedy, which is imagining the whole audience naked, but you could imagine a whole audience full of unsubs.
you're really good at talking down an unsub.
baby girl, it wasn't stage fright.
I wasn't ready to discuss my feelings about my father in public.
and you think talking about his partner is going to bring up those feelings?
how can I honor jason ryder when I couldn't honor my own father?
it's disrespectful.
OK, this is gonna start out sounding really harsh, but you need to get over it.
you need to let it go.
that is so far past.
you've gotta stop beating yourself up about this.
that's not gonna happen, is it?
OK. Well, then this, uh, this gift is totally pointless.
it's just some stuff from barry flynn.
I talked to him about your issue, and he gave you another incentive as a thank-you.
you only have it for 24 hours.
so...
a policeman pulled over a man, and he said to him,"sir, your eyes look bloodshot.
have you been drinking?
and that man replied,"officer, your eyes look glazed.
have you been eating doughnuts?
you see, that right there was the last joke that my father ever told me before he died.
a special gift in my life are the 11 years that I did have with him.
because as brief as they may have been, my dad gave me unconditional love.
he taught me a sense of duty.
and he gave me a reason to keep working hard.
because each and every day, I do all that I know how to do to make my father proud.
now, my dad was taken from this world way too soon.
but if he wasn't, I wouldn't be the man that I am today.
now, you may be wondering why I'm talking about him here.
it's because my father, the man that I admire the most...
looked up to Mr. Jason ryder, who we honor here tonight.
Jason was the most important person in my father's life outside of his family.
he was his partner and his best friend.
like my father, jason strived to be the best he could be.
he inspired me to be fearless and to go out into the world and find my inner light.
and for that, jason, I am eternally grateful to you.
no, please.
please don't. Please don't!
please!
no, no, no! No, please!
please don't!
please!
blessed are the leaves of the forest and the air that we breathe.
CITRONELLE, ALABAMA
each day help me realize the oneness that nurtures, strengthens, and invigorates.
allow me to honor you each morning as you honor all of your creatures.

it's been a long time, Patty.
I bet you didn't think I'd track you down.
my name isn't P -- what are you talking about?
no. No. Wait.
what are you doing?
lay down on your stomach.
please. I'm only
your stomach. Don't do this.
I'm just a humble servant.
what is it you call yourself now? Floressa?
no, you're making a mistake.
Yes, okay, I changed my name to Floressa when I came here.
but before then I wasn't Patty.
I was Nina. I was Nina Skinner from Joplin.
bite that. Bite down.
there.
I always wondered what Spencer Reid's grocery list looked like.
it's actually Rieman's hypothesis.
which is?
it's a mathematical conjecture from the 19th century that states that the Riemann zeta function zeroes all lie on the critical line.
Yeah, I get it.
I noodle it from time to time.
it sort of helps me unwind, you know?
well, since were on the subject of unwinding, how'd your date go?
uh, had to cancel at the last minute.
Oh? You did or she did?
um, sort of both did.
but...it's fine. I talked to her this morning and things are good.
round table's about to start. We should probably get going.
what have we got?
nothing good. Okay, anyone who's wandered through a museum in Italy knows that a chisel and a hammer in the right hands can be a beautiful thing.
but Michelangelo this is not, my friends.
okay, Floressa, aka Nina Skinner, was found yesterday, murdered on the grounds of Church of the First Dawn, in Alabama.
two days earlier, 100 miles away, Charlie Clayton was taken from his home in Gulfport, Mississippi, he was brought to the woods, he was also murdered.
chisels to the brain.
and a lot of creepy-crawlers.
forensics?
Mm-mmm. Neither crime scene yielded much results because of too many bugs and critters.
the choice and placement of the chisel is very specific.
maybe the unsub symbolically is destroying the thoughts and memories of the victims.
it looks like they were facedown when the chisel went in. Remorse?
could be the killer knew the victims, didn't want to see their faces when he was killing them.
was there a connection between Clayton and Floressa?
nothing's been found yet.
so right now, method of execution and regional proximity are the only two things linking them.
it could be a spree killer on the move.
a spree killer who's careful and meticulous and covers his tracks.
we've got a mobile unsub with a significant head start.
we can't afford to be playing catch-up.
wheels up in 30.
Pensacola, FLORIDA "I have never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of a ghost."
John Philpot Curran.
these first two victims couldn't be more different.
ethnicity, gender, age, social and economic background.
both were born and raised in the deep south. But that's it.
Garcia, you said that the last victim, Floressa, changed her name?
Yeah. Her name was Nina Skinner and she changed it when she joined Church of the First Dawn 6 years ago.
what do we know about this church?
is it a legitimate religion?
Ah, it's more like religious adjacent.
it appears to be a hodgepodge of a bunch of different religious beliefs plucked from here and there.
and Floressa lived on the grounds of the church?
Yes. She and 15 other women.
it sounds like a convent.
you know, it sort of is.
the residents had to take the same kinds of vows as nuns -- celibacy, poverty, days spent in quiet contemplation.
I would not be a good candidate for admission, in other words.
Garcia, did the compound allow outsiders?
not usually, but it appears that once or twice a year they do let in non-members for like a week-long retreat.
are these non-members men and women?
apparently so.
Garcia, compile a list of guests for these retreats for the last year, please.
will do.
it says here that the first victim, Charlie Clayton, was a Seventh Day Adventist.
could this be someone harboring a grudge against religion?
or the opposite.
both victims gravitated toward non-mainstream faiths.
this could be a zealot wanting to punish those who deviate from strict orthodox beliefs.
Blake, you and Reid go see the medical examiner.
morgan and Rossi, drive to Mississippi and see what you can find out about the first victim.
JJ and I will go to the compound and see where Floressa was killed.
how long have you been head of the church?
35 years.
I founded it.
and Floressa joined 6 years ago?
Yes.
how much contact would she have had with the outside world?
none. The women who are custodians of the faith turn themselves over to it completely.
and the people you allow for the week-long retreats, would Floressa have interacted with them?
no. Guests are housed in a separate area.
we provide them a quiet space for contemplation.
did this man ever go to any of your retreats?
no. I've never seen him before.
this is where it happened.
I still can't believe it.
is there any sort of screening process before you accept a resident studying the faith like Floressa?
I don't understand.
like a background check?
the killer may have known her before she came here.
and if she'd had a troubled past, she might have seen this as a refuge.
Floressa was a woman of deep and sincere faith.
there was no need for us to investigate her previous life.
if a holy sanctuary isn't immune from a horrible act like this, what is?
Gulfport, MISSISSIPPI
uh, let me guess.
she don't know nothin' about nothin'.
practically a direct quote.
how did you know that?
Oh, it's a busy enough street.
broad daylight.
house is fully exposed.
either this unsub is really, really good, or this is the worst neighborhood watch program.
I already told the regular police I didn't see anything.
well, that's a shame.
Oh, by the way, we couldn't help but notice all of these, uh, empty jars.
I find 'em in the garbage cans and turn 'em in for money.
sanitized?
my third wife, she always said I was part bloodhound.
all of those jars, they smell of... Disinfectant.
I can vouch for the bloodhound part.
he sniffed out your mailbox.
converted whiskey jars hold their scent.
as do converted moonshine jugs.
only thing is, making moonshine is against the law, so maybe my friend's nose here is wrong this time.
well, a weird guy came over when I was out front and started talking to me, that's all.
asked about Charlie.
asking what?
just wanted to make sure that is where he lived.
kept calling him Taylor, though.
so maybe Charlie wasn't who he was looking for.
Oh, it was. This guy described Charlie to a "T."
the guy you talked to, you remember what he looked like?
sure. Heh. You might have the nose, but I got the eyes.
in my line of work, you'd best not forget a face.
put on another shirt.
we're going for a ride.
chisel severed the brain stem.
clean, quick, right on the money.
death was instantaneous.
were there any drugs in her system?
Nope. Tox screen was clean.
yet she seemed totally compliant.
to control her, the unsub must have been armed.
any evidence of torture or sexual abuse?
none.
except for the chisel in her head, the victim was in tip-top shape.
did find some wood residue in the teeth, back molars, both sides of the mouth.
killer might have somehow used the stick as a gag?
it says here there was excessive insect infestation?
sure was.
and the wrong kind and in the wrong place.
what do you mean?
the victim was only dead a few hours.
there should have been adult flies and unhatched eggs, maybe.
certainly not third-instar larvae.
and the maggots were all over the place.
flies don't lay their eggs around the food source, they squirt 'em out right there in the blood and guts.
and icing on the cake
I found a composite of animal hair mixed in with the larvae
turns out to be skunk.
were these inconsistencies present in the first victim, the one from Mississippi?
don't know about the animal hair, but yeah.
Gulfport M. E. found the exact same thing at his crime scene
the mass insect infestation not consistent with the early stage of decomposition.
this unsub is bringing fly larvae to the crime scene with him.
our unsub is skilled at avoiding detection.
a man in this environment would have stood out.
have Garcia check for male maintenance workers, any city employees that might have access to this part of the compound.
what have you got, Morgan?
Hey, we found a neighbor who not only saw the unsub, but he spoke with him, too.
the day of the murder?
Yeah. Unsub was trying to make sure of Charlie Clayton's address, but kept referring to the victim as Taylor.
neighbor give enough of a description to get a sketch?
Yeah, I got it right here in my hands.
it's a damn good one, too.
I'll text it right over.
Pensacola, FLORIDA
top that off for you?
need a menu?
no. But thanks for asking, Carol.
you've got the wrong gal.
I'm Brianna.
I don't think so.
recognize me yet?
I made it easy for you.
so just coffee, then?
the sign up there says I get a free dessert if it's my birthday.
Uh-huh. And today happens to be your birthday?
Yes, ma'am.
well, I'm gonna need some I. D. to verify that.
I have no reason to lie to you, Carol.
especially about the day a person was born.
it's the most important day there is.
you of all people should realize that.
Molly's not gonna like that you did that.
it shut the guy up, didn't it?
seriously, how come all the weirdoes always sit in my section instead of yours?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe you have that special something.
Yeah, right?
next job I get is gonna be at a fire lookout station way up in the mountains.
no dealing with the public at all.
a dead skunk?
no. Why?
skunk hair was found in the larvae at Floressa's crime scene.
thought maybe there was one laying around nearby.
I would have sniffed it out had there been one.
here's the police sketch.
this guy's brazen.
chatting with the neighbor about the person he's on his way to murder.
he's too calm to be on a spree.
something else is motivating him.
okay, great. Thanks.
two for two. Gulfport M. E.
also found animal hair on the first victim's larvae
raccoon -- and Charlie Clayton had wood residue in his teeth just like Floressa.
Russell Smith. -- Who?
a serial killer who was active in this part of the country from 1967 to 1987.
I remember. Smith was a sexual sadist who murdered 8 prostitutes before being killed in a police shootout.
and he had his victims bite down on a block of wood before he killed them.
good night, Chris. -- Good night, Brianna.
Oh, my God.
bite down -- hard.
a chisel right in the skull.
20 years on the job, you think you've seen it all.
the rest of the team should be here within the hour.
sheriff Mitchell, Agent Rossi.
we're getting you folks set up over at the county sheriff's office.
thank you.
you the one that found her? -- Yes, sir.
I was making my rounds about 4: 00 in the morning.
I've never seen anything like it.
the blood. Bugs all over the place.
doors and windows open when you discovered the body?
no, sir. I checked.
found this in the car.
bite marks.
the co-worker's ready for you.
Yeah, that's him.
you know who he is?
no, not yet.
there was a cut on his jaw, though.
he had a bandage, but it was bloody.
fresh blood, like it had just happened.
when he left, did he get into a car or...
I didn't see him go.
I just thought he was like, you know, homeless guy or something, he wanted free food.
he asked for food?
Yeah. He said it was his birthday.
did YOU SAY IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?! THEN HAVE DESSERT ON US!
he got really weird and intense when Brianna asked him for his I. D.
how so?
well, he went on and on about how nobody would ever lie about the day they were born.
I mean, Brianna gave him the pie anyway.
did this man at any point refer to Brianna by another name?
Yeah. I completely forgot about that.
he called her Carol.
okay.
well, we appreciate all your help, Ms. Carson.
if you can remember anything else, please, give us a call.
so the unsub recognizes his victims, but he calls them by a different name.
what's that about?
the guy's schizophrenic, maybe.
no, the killings are too organized and methodical.
these people are probably surrogates.
Garcia can't find any late-blooming Russell Smith wannabes out there.
at least nobody on law enforcement radar.
you know, using a stick as a gag maybe have simply been a convenience at the first two crime scenes.
the unsub was in the forest and they were handy.
but he specifically brought a stick with him to the most recent crime scene.
it's a ritual that mirrors Russell Smith's very closely.
also, there's something strange about the fly larvae that was found in the car.
you mean besides the fact that there was fly larvae in the car.
well, that, and it was laid by Lucilia mexicana flies.
meaning what? It's a species unique to the southwestern United States and the dry desert climates of Latin America.
there's no way it would be found along the Gulf Coast unless it was brought here.
I think I know what's going on.
enlighten us.
DNA from the maggot stomach crop at both crime scenes revealed not only skunk and raccoon meat, but traces of engine oil.
I think this unsub is seeding his victims with aged maggots reared on animal remains.
road kill.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Ted.
sorry. You must have the wrong house.
are you okay?
you must be Ted's wife.
Oh, my God!
no. Stop right there.
so far, the unsub's not trying hard to hide anything from us.
what if December 11th actually is his birthday, like he told the waitress?
the unsub's in his mid- to late 20s.
it means he was born between 1987 and 1992.
Reid, get Garcia on it.
tell her to narrow the search to those with a criminal background who live in the southwestern United States, someone with a history of vandalizing churches or religious shrines and someone who's also worked with or is at least familiar with insects.
who are you?
how do you know Ted?
you mean your husband?
we've known each other for years and years.
and years.
how old are you?
where is he?
my husband is dead.
what?
he died of -- of cancer.
you're lying.
I'm not.
I live here alone now. I rent rooms to college students to help with expenses.
I'm going to give you one last chance to tell the truth.
and I mean it better be the truth.
when did he die?
uh -- um -- it was a long time ago.
I need to know exactly when.
it was May 12, 1999.
morning or night?
what?
morning or night?
night. It was night.
what difference does it make?
where? At home?
no, at the hospital.
which one?
tell me which hospital!
Escambia Memorial!
do you have any idea how many people are born on earth every day?
358, 197 approximately.
I did not like the answer to that question. My point
even if narrowed way, way down, none of these fit the profile of our unsub.
if December 11th really is his birthday, he's kept his nose clean so far.
the unsub told Brianna that there was no more important day in one's life than the day you were born.
it has to somehow be part of his methodology.
how about the birthdays of Russell Smith's earlier victims, the 8 prostitutes?
you could be right. Anniversary kills.
selecting victims who share the same birthdays as those who went before.
what is it, Hotch?
the new wound on the unsub's jaw
it wasn't there when he spoke to the neighbor in Gulfport, and there's no evidence that any of the victims put up resistance.
well, it could be an accident. Accidents do happen.
or it was an interim victim we don't know about yet who did fight back.
Garcia, can you find a file photo of Russell Smith?
Yeah.
I'm sending these pictures to your monitors right now.
our unsub's wound was self-inflicted.
he's not trying to emulate Russell Smith.
he's trying to turn himself into Russell Smith.
you've all been given copies of the sketch of the suspect.
they need to be distributed to all law enforcement officials in the tri-state area.
all of the unsub's kills so far have been in different cities and different states.
we don't have to worry about flushing him out.
he's operating in the open with confidence bordering on arrogance.
we don't know why, but he's been leaving large amounts of insects behind at his crime scenes.
normally, that would be a forensic countermeasure, artificially accelerating infestation of the corpse.
or symbolically to degrade and humiliate the victims.
but these larvae are serving some other purpose to the unsub.
it's like an obsession. They are an essential component to his kills.
we believe he's slowly turning himself into the image of Russell Smith, an Alabama serial killer who's been dead for nearly 25 years.
the unsub recently cut himself on the jaw to replicate a similar scar on Smith.
and he may continue to alter his appearance.
Russell Smith had several distinctive scorpion tattoos.
parlors in the region should be notified to be on the lookout for customers requesting these tattoos.
curiously, the unsub seems to know precisely who he's looking for, but he refers to his victims by a different name.
which means he's either delusional or he's using these victims as substitutes for someone else. Surrogates.
the larvae he's depositing at the crime scenes are indigenous to the southwestern United States.
so be on the lookout for suspicious vehicles with either Arizona, Nevada, or New Mexico license plates.
Russell Smith preyed exclusively on prostitutes and killed infrequently.
8 victims in a 20-year period.
but this unsub is killing at a rate of one victim every other day, and he's targeting ordinary citizens.
no one is safe.
through all the birthdays, no match between old and new victims.
it looks like we've been going down the wrong road.
it may have been the right road in the wrong direction.
Garcia, what do the initials T. L. stand for?
T. L. that would be
the unsub kept calling Clayton Taylor and Brianna Carol.
when did Smith kill Carol Hansen?
I need an exact date.
killed? That would be March 28, 1979.
that's it. The murder date of the original victim matches the birthdate of the new one.
I'm all over it. Okay.
Taylor Lynn Grover, killed February 5, 1985.
were any of Smith's original victims killed the day Floressa was born?
Yes. Patty Johnson.
she was Smith's first victim.
she was murdered on October 9, 1967.
what do you want to bet our killer thought Floressa was named Patty?
so this unsub thinks his new victims are Smith's old victims.
Garcia, what about locations?
where did Patty Johnson, Taylor Lynn Grover, and Carol Hansen die?
okay. Okay. Hold on. Give me a sec.
they were all murdered in Alabama. In order
mobile, Birmingham, Gadsden.
and where were Floressa, Clayton, and Brianna born?
also in order-- Mobile, Birmingham...
and, oh, my God, Gadsden.
exact same places, exact same dates.
that's it. Patty, Taylor, and Carol were all killed only to be born to live again.
this is about reincarnation.
what are you going to do to me?
so, this killer believes that Smith's victims didn't really die, but hopped into a newborn life and kept on living.
exactly. Reincarnated as Floressa, Charlie Clayton, and Brianna.
so what's he doing now, killing them all over again?
that's how it looks.
But...he believes in reincarnation, right?
who's to say that these new victims haven't just jumped into somebody else's body, the way he believes they did the first time?
well, maybe in his mind they already have.
see, a fundamental tenet of reincarnation is that you can come back in any life form, not just human.
that would explain the larvae.
this unsub is introducing a newly hatched life form next to the victims as he kills them.
it's a new life form waiting right there, ready to receive the spirit of the one that just died.
he thinks that the people he's killing get reincarnated as flies?
he's making sure they don't come back in human form again.
ensuring that this death ends the cycle.
if he believes it about the victims, he must believe it about himself.
Garcia, can you find out exactly where and when Russell Smith died, and then see who was born in the same place at the same time?
Russell Smith died January 19, 1988.
tuscaloosa. Shot.
taken to Hobson Regional Medical Center.
born exact same day, exact same hospital.
do you have an address for Kestler?
it is...it's not local.
uh, 3088 Lakehawk Street, Apartment 5, Chandler, Arizona.
you got a photo? I'm sending it to you now.
that's our guy.
does Kestler have a vehicle?
Mm-hmm. He's the registered owner of a Ford Bronco, 1989, green,
Arizona license plate MAQ3586.
sheriff, put out an APB to all law enforcement within a 200-mile radius.
I'm on it.
Thanks, Garcia.
how come you're doing this?
it's that voice in your head.
the one you can't figure out.
I don't have a voice in my head. --You do.
maybe it's not as loud for you as it was for me.
for a long time I didn't understand.
it was like...
there was me...
then there was another me.
then a few years ago, right before he died, my grandpa told me something that made it all clear.
it was about what happened to me the day I was born.
I was supposed to be born two weeks before.
but I wouldn't come.
and then when I did...
things got all... tangled up inside.
they had to rip my mama open to get me out.
but that was okay.
I had to wait to be born for a reason.
there was a man who got shot that very day.
a killer.
you can't explain things like this.
it just happens.
it happened to me.
it could happen to you.
my mama died when I was 5 years old and I had to go live with that bastard.
old man used to smack me around all the time.
no reason. Just mean.
my grandpa always said I had the devil inside me.
the soul of a killer.
that's crazy.
no.
it wasn't crazy at all.
after I heard that story, it all made sense.
the voice in my head.
the two mes.
there was only ever one real me all the time.
that's who I am.
that's who I've always been.
what have you got, Garcia?
Chandler P. D. says Kestler's apartment is empty, but they found stacks and stacks of books about reincarnation.
all right. Do the math with each of Smith's other 5 victims.
find out who was born the same place at the same time that each was murdered.
that's who Kestler will be going after next.
Yes, sir. But this is gonna take a while.
please put on your hat of patience.
hurry, Yeah. .
we need to take a ride now.
don't hurt me. Please.
it's not that I want to.
maybe I am Russell Smith.
but it didn't mean I had to be a killer again.
what are you talking about?
I mean, the whole point of reincarnation is that you're supposed to come back and be better than you were before.
work on your karma.
what I'm doing now, it's self-defense.
one of you found out where I was, and you tried to come and cut off my brakes and kill me.
so I had to find you.
all 8 of you.
and then I'll be done.
Oh, let me go.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
you're gonna scream your head off, aren't you?
as soon as we open the door, you're gonna make a run for it.
no.
I don't believe you.
no...
maybe we should just do this right here.
no. No, don't.
no...
bad, bad news.
what is it?
there are 22 possible people our unsub could be going after, and they are scattered everywhere.
I mean everywhere.
Nova Scotia to Hawaii to Pennsylvania
any in the Pensacola area?
no.
there's a Ted Sissler, who was born the same day in the same place as one of the older victims from Pensacola, but he died 13 years ago.
well, that's good, then, right?
one less person he's gonna want to hunt down and kill.
no, that's bad.
sheriff, check to see if any 13-year-olds went missing in the last 24 hours, and if Ted Sissler has any family in the area, put them into protective custody immediately.
so, Kestler has no criminal record, but he has been on the Chandler P. D. radar recently.
Why? 3 months ago he was injured in a solo car crash.
claims someone cut his brake lines and he wanted the police to figure out who did it.
And?
investigation turned up no evidence of foul play.
but the police said Kestler was obsessed over it.
he kept showing up for weeks saying someone was after him.
well, that must have been the trigger.
reincarnation cuts both ways.
Kestler thought Smith's old victims were coming back to get him.
he's a psychopath.
Aidan Donahue, 13 years old.
parents said he never came home from school today.
Kestler's car was spotted at a downtown motel.
let's go.
come here.
no. No, no...
Aidan, it's all right. We're the FBI.
we're the good guys. Are you okay?
the man that was here, where did he go?
I don't know.
he just...took off.
did he say where he was going?
no. Only that this wasn't over.
he was gonna come back.
here? He was gonna come back here to this room?
no. The guy was crazy.
he said he was coming back in 20 years.
he'd come back and get me in 20 years.
I think I know where he's going.
ESCAMBIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
can I help you?
Yes. I'm looking for the delivery rooms.
is your wife having a baby?
Yes.
patient's name?
just tell me where they are.
sir, only family members are allowed back in the delivery area. -- Now.
sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

it's gonna be okay.

Ohh! You can't be in here.

put the baby down and drop your weapon.
Willie Kestler, it's over.
there's nowhere to run.
Ohh! No!
agent down. Get a doctor in here.
no.
no.
no...
the doctrine of the immortality of the soul has more threat than comfort.
when did you get back? No one told me you got back and I've been worried like crazy.
because they said you were shot, with bullets.
I'm fine.
I can't believe you were shot with bu
I got shot in my bulletproof vest, baby girl.
it's just a couple bruises. I'm okay.
why don't they make better vests? That's not bulletproof.
it's like when you fall in the pool and your watch stops working.
that's water-resistant, not waterproof. They should
I'm just fine. See? It's just a couple bruises.
how -- how long do you have to be taped up like this?
I don't know. A couple days, maybe.
Oh. Okay.
are you relaxed now?
Yeah. I'm relaxed. Hey, if you need someone to help you, you know, put new bindings on, rewrap or wrap, unwrap
Hey, you guys--oh!
we... hey.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Hotch needs us at the round table.
Why? We just landed.
he said it's important.
it was nothing. I wasn't doing anything.
yesterday while we were in Florida, a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
and, as you know, last month a body was found in Dallas with its mouth sewn shut, like the silencer.
what looked then to be a possible one-time copycat now has to be examined in a different light.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we've solved.
that's how it looks.
this is now an active case, which we'll be investigating along with our other cases.
blessed are the leaves of the forest and the air that we breathe.
CITRONELLE, ALABAMA
each day help me realize the oneness that nurtures, strengthens, and invigorates.
allow me to honor you each morning as you honor all of your creatures.
accept these humble offerings and give me the strength to
who are you? Where did you come from?
it's been a long time, Patty.
I bet you didn't think I'd track you down.
my name isn't P -- what are you talking about?
no. No. Wait.
what are you doing?
lay down on your stomach.
please. I'm only
your stomach. Don't do this.
I'm just a humble servant.
what is it you call yourself now? Floressa?
no, you're making a mistake.
Yes, okay, I changed my name to Floressa when I came here.
but before then I wasn't Patty.
I was Nina. I was Nina Skinner from Joplin.
bite that. Bite down.
there.
I always wondered what Spencer Reid's grocery list looked like.
it's actually Rieman's hypothesis.
which is?
it's a mathematical conjecture from the 19th century that states that the Riemann zeta function zeroes all lie on the critical line.
Yeah, I get it.
I noodle it from time to time.
it sort of helps me unwind, you know?
well, since were on the subject of unwinding, how'd your date go?
uh, had to cancel at the last minute.
Oh? You did or she did?
um, sort of both did.
but...it's fine. I talked to her this morning and things are good.
round table's about to start. We should probably get going.
what have we got?
nothing good. Okay, anyone who's wandered through a museum in Italy knows that a chisel and a hammer in the right hands can be a beautiful thing.
but Michelangelo this is not, my friends.
okay, Floressa, aka Nina Skinner, was found yesterday, murdered on the grounds of Church of the First Dawn, in Alabama.
two days earlier, 100 miles away, Charlie Clayton was taken from his home in Gulfport, Mississippi, he was brought to the woods, he was also murdered.
chisels to the brain.
and a lot of creepy-crawlers.
forensics?
Mm-mmm. Neither crime scene yielded much results because of too many bugs and critters.
the choice and placement of the chisel is very specific.
maybe the unsub symbolically is destroying the thoughts and memories of the victims.
it looks like they were facedown when the chisel went in. Remorse?
could be the killer knew the victims, didn't want to see their faces when he was killing them.
was there a connection between Clayton and Floressa?
nothing's been found yet.
so right now, method of execution and regional proximity are the only two things linking them.
it could be a spree killer on the move.
a spree killer who's careful and meticulous and covers his tracks.
we've got a mobile unsub with a significant head start.
we can't afford to be playing catch-up.
wheels up in 30.
Pensacola, FLORIDA "I have never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of a ghost."
John Philpot Curran.
these first two victims couldn't be more different.
ethnicity, gender, age, social and economic background.
both were born and raised in the deep south. But that's it.
Garcia, you said that the last victim, Floressa, changed her name?
Yeah. Her name was Nina Skinner and she changed it when she joined Church of the First Dawn 6 years ago.
what do we know about this church?
is it a legitimate religion?
Ah, it's more like religious adjacent.
it appears to be a hodgepodge of a bunch of different religious beliefs plucked from here and there.
and Floressa lived on the grounds of the church?
Yes. She and 15 other women.
it sounds like a convent.
you know, it sort of is.
the residents had to take the same kinds of vows as nuns -- celibacy, poverty, days spent in quiet contemplation.
I would not be a good candidate for admission, in other words.
Garcia, did the compound allow outsiders?
not usually, but it appears that once or twice a year they do let in non-members for like a week-long retreat.
are these non-members men and women?
apparently so.
Garcia, compile a list of guests for these retreats for the last year, please.
will do.
it says here that the first victim, Charlie Clayton, was a Seventh Day Adventist.
could this be someone harboring a grudge against religion?
or the opposite.
both victims gravitated toward non-mainstream faiths.
this could be a zealot wanting to punish those who deviate from strict orthodox beliefs.
Blake, you and Reid go see the medical examiner.
morgan and Rossi, drive to Mississippi and see what you can find out about the first victim.
JJ and I will go to the compound and see where Floressa was killed.
how long have you been head of the church?
35 years.
I founded it.
and Floressa joined 6 years ago?
Yes.
how much contact would she have had with the outside world?
none. The women who are custodians of the faith turn themselves over to it completely.
and the people you allow for the week-long retreats, would Floressa have interacted with them?
no. Guests are housed in a separate area.
we provide them a quiet space for contemplation.
did this man ever go to any of your retreats?
no. I've never seen him before.
this is where it happened.
I still can't believe it.
is there any sort of screening process before you accept a resident studying the faith like Floressa?
I don't understand.
like a background check?
the killer may have known her before she came here.
and if she'd had a troubled past, she might have seen this as a refuge.
Floressa was a woman of deep and sincere faith.
there was no need for us to investigate her previous life.
if a holy sanctuary isn't immune from a horrible act like this, what is?
Gulfport, MISSISSIPPI
uh, let me guess.
she don't know nothin' about nothin'.
practically a direct quote.
how did you know that?
Oh, it's a busy enough street.
broad daylight.
house is fully exposed.
either this unsub is really, really good, or this is the worst neighborhood watch program.
I already told the regular police I didn't see anything.
well, that's a shame.
Oh, by the way, we couldn't help but notice all of these, uh, empty jars.
I find 'em in the garbage cans and turn 'em in for money.
sanitized?
my third wife, she always said I was part bloodhound.
all of those jars, they smell of... Disinfectant.
I can vouch for the bloodhound part.
he sniffed out your mailbox.
converted whiskey jars hold their scent.
as do converted moonshine jugs.
only thing is, making moonshine is against the law, so maybe my friend's nose here is wrong this time.
well, a weird guy came over when I was out front and started talking to me, that's all.
asked about Charlie.
asking what?
just wanted to make sure that is where he lived.
kept calling him Taylor, though.
so maybe Charlie wasn't who he was looking for.
Oh, it was. This guy described Charlie to a "T."
the guy you talked to, you remember what he looked like?
sure. Heh. You might have the nose, but I got the eyes.
in my line of work, you'd best not forget a face.
put on another shirt.
we're going for a ride.
chisel severed the brain stem.
clean, quick, right on the money.
death was instantaneous.
were there any drugs in her system?
Nope. Tox screen was clean.
yet she seemed totally compliant.
to control her, the unsub must have been armed.
any evidence of torture or sexual abuse?
none.
except for the chisel in her head, the victim was in tip-top shape.
did find some wood residue in the teeth, back molars, both sides of the mouth.
killer might have somehow used the stick as a gag?
it says here there was excessive insect infestation?
sure was.
and the wrong kind and in the wrong place.
what do you mean?
the victim was only dead a few hours.
there should have been adult flies and unhatched eggs, maybe.
certainly not third-instar larvae.
and the maggots were all over the place.
flies don't lay their eggs around the food source, they squirt 'em out right there in the blood and guts.
and icing on the cake
I found a composite of animal hair mixed in with the larvae
turns out to be skunk.
were these inconsistencies present in the first victim, the one from Mississippi?
don't know about the animal hair, but yeah.
Gulfport M. E. found the exact same thing at his crime scene
the mass insect infestation not consistent with the early stage of decomposition.
this unsub is bringing fly larvae to the crime scene with him.
our unsub is skilled at avoiding detection.
a man in this environment would have stood out.
have Garcia check for male maintenance workers, any city employees that might have access to this part of the compound.
what have you got, Morgan?
Hey, we found a neighbor who not only saw the unsub, but he spoke with him, too.
the day of the murder?
Yeah. Unsub was trying to make sure of Charlie Clayton's address, but kept referring to the victim as Taylor.
neighbor give enough of a description to get a sketch?
Yeah, I got it right here in my hands.
it's a damn good one, too.
I'll text it right over.
Pensacola, FLORIDA
top that off for you?
need a menu?
no. But thanks for asking, Carol.
you've got the wrong gal.
I'm Brianna.
I don't think so.
recognize me yet?
I made it easy for you.
so just coffee, then?
the sign up there says I get a free dessert if it's my birthday.
Uh-huh. And today happens to be your birthday?
Yes, ma'am.
well, I'm gonna need some I. D. to verify that.
I have no reason to lie to you, Carol.
especially about the day a person was born.
it's the most important day there is.
you of all people should realize that.
Molly's not gonna like that you did that.
it shut the guy up, didn't it?
seriously, how come all the weirdoes always sit in my section instead of yours?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe you have that special something.
Yeah, right?
next job I get is gonna be at a fire lookout station way up in the mountains.
no dealing with the public at all.
a dead skunk?
no. Why?
skunk hair was found in the larvae at Floressa's crime scene.
thought maybe there was one laying around nearby.
I would have sniffed it out had there been one.
here's the police sketch.
this guy's brazen.
chatting with the neighbor about the person he's on his way to murder.
he's too calm to be on a spree.
something else is motivating him.
okay, great. Thanks.
two for two. Gulfport M. E.
also found animal hair on the first victim's larvae
raccoon -- and Charlie Clayton had wood residue in his teeth just like Floressa.
Russell Smith. -- Who?
a serial killer who was active in this part of the country from 1967 to 1987.
I remember. Smith was a sexual sadist who murdered 8 prostitutes before being killed in a police shootout.
and he had his victims bite down on a block of wood before he killed them.
good night, Chris. -- Good night, Brianna.
Oh, my God.
bite down -- hard.
a chisel right in the skull.
20 years on the job, you think you've seen it all.
the rest of the team should be here within the hour.
sheriff Mitchell, Agent Rossi.
we're getting you folks set up over at the county sheriff's office.
thank you.
you the one that found her? -- Yes, sir.
I was making my rounds about 4: 00 in the morning.
I've never seen anything like it.
the blood. Bugs all over the place.
doors and windows open when you discovered the body?
no, sir. I checked.
found this in the car.
bite marks.
the co-worker's ready for you.
Yeah, that's him.
you know who he is?
no, not yet.
there was a cut on his jaw, though.
he had a bandage, but it was bloody.
fresh blood, like it had just happened.
when he left, did he get into a car or...
I didn't see him go.
I just thought he was like, you know, homeless guy or something, he wanted free food.
he asked for food?
Yeah. He said it was his birthday.
did YOU SAY IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?! THEN HAVE DESSERT ON US!
he got really weird and intense when Brianna asked him for his I. D.
how so?
well, he went on and on about how nobody would ever lie about the day they were born.
I mean, Brianna gave him the pie anyway.
did this man at any point refer to Brianna by another name?
Yeah. I completely forgot about that.
he called her Carol.
okay.
well, we appreciate all your help, Ms. Carson.
if you can remember anything else, please, give us a call.
so the unsub recognizes his victims, but he calls them by a different name.
what's that about?
the guy's schizophrenic, maybe.
no, the killings are too organized and methodical.
these people are probably surrogates.
Garcia can't find any late-blooming Russell Smith wannabes out there.
at least nobody on law enforcement radar.
you know, using a stick as a gag maybe have simply been a convenience at the first two crime scenes.
the unsub was in the forest and they were handy.
but he specifically brought a stick with him to the most recent crime scene.
it's a ritual that mirrors Russell Smith's very closely.
also, there's something strange about the fly larvae that was found in the car.
you mean besides the fact that there was fly larvae in the car.
well, that, and it was laid by Lucilia mexicana flies.
meaning what? It's a species unique to the southwestern United States and the dry desert climates of Latin America.
there's no way it would be found along the Gulf Coast unless it was brought here.
I think I know what's going on.
enlighten us.
DNA from the maggot stomach crop at both crime scenes revealed not only skunk and raccoon meat, but traces of engine oil.
I think this unsub is seeding his victims with aged maggots reared on animal remains.
road kill.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Ted.
sorry. You must have the wrong house.
are you okay?
you must be Ted's wife.
Oh, my God!
no. Stop right there.
so far, the unsub's not trying hard to hide anything from us.
what if December 11th actually is his birthday, like he told the waitress?
the unsub's in his mid- to late 20s.
it means he was born between 1987 and 1992.
Reid, get Garcia on it.
tell her to narrow the search to those with a criminal background who live in the southwestern United States, someone with a history of vandalizing churches or religious shrines and someone who's also worked with or is at least familiar with insects.
who are you?
how do you know Ted?
you mean your husband?
we've known each other for years and years.
and years.
how old are you?
where is he?
my husband is dead.
what?
he died of -- of cancer.
you're lying.
I'm not.
I live here alone now. I rent rooms to college students to help with expenses.
I'm going to give you one last chance to tell the truth.
and I mean it better be the truth.
when did he die?
uh -- um -- it was a long time ago.
I need to know exactly when.
it was May 12, 1999.
morning or night?
what?
morning or night?
night. It was night.
what difference does it make?
where? At home?
no, at the hospital.
which one?
tell me which hospital!
Escambia Memorial!
do you have any idea how many people are born on earth every day?
358, 197 approximately.
I did not like the answer to that question. My point
even if narrowed way, way down, none of these fit the profile of our unsub.
if December 11th really is his birthday, he's kept his nose clean so far.
the unsub told Brianna that there was no more important day in one's life than the day you were born.
it has to somehow be part of his methodology.
how about the birthdays of Russell Smith's earlier victims, the 8 prostitutes?
you could be right. Anniversary kills.
selecting victims who share the same birthdays as those who went before.
what is it, Hotch?
the new wound on the unsub's jaw
it wasn't there when he spoke to the neighbor in Gulfport, and there's no evidence that any of the victims put up resistance.
well, it could be an accident. Accidents do happen.
or it was an interim victim we don't know about yet who did fight back.
Garcia, can you find a file photo of Russell Smith?
Yeah.
I'm sending these pictures to your monitors right now.
our unsub's wound was self-inflicted.
he's not trying to emulate Russell Smith.
he's trying to turn himself into Russell Smith.
you've all been given copies of the sketch of the suspect.
they need to be distributed to all law enforcement officials in the tri-state area.
all of the unsub's kills so far have been in different cities and different states.
we don't have to worry about flushing him out.
he's operating in the open with confidence bordering on arrogance.
we don't know why, but he's been leaving large amounts of insects behind at his crime scenes.
normally, that would be a forensic countermeasure, artificially accelerating infestation of the corpse.
or symbolically to degrade and humiliate the victims.
but these larvae are serving some other purpose to the unsub.
it's like an obsession. They are an essential component to his kills.
we believe he's slowly turning himself into the image of Russell Smith, an Alabama serial killer who's been dead for nearly 25 years.
the unsub recently cut himself on the jaw to replicate a similar scar on Smith.
and he may continue to alter his appearance.
Russell Smith had several distinctive scorpion tattoos.
parlors in the region should be notified to be on the lookout for customers requesting these tattoos.
curiously, the unsub seems to know precisely who he's looking for, but he refers to his victims by a different name.
which means he's either delusional or he's using these victims as substitutes for someone else. Surrogates.
the larvae he's depositing at the crime scenes are indigenous to the southwestern United States.
so be on the lookout for suspicious vehicles with either Arizona, Nevada, or New Mexico license plates.
Russell Smith preyed exclusively on prostitutes and killed infrequently.
8 victims in a 20-year period.
but this unsub is killing at a rate of one victim every other day, and he's targeting ordinary citizens.
no one is safe.
through all the birthdays, no match between old and new victims.
it looks like we've been going down the wrong road.
it may have been the right road in the wrong direction.
Garcia, what do the initials T. L. stand for?
T. L. that would be
the unsub kept calling Clayton Taylor and Brianna Carol.
when did Smith kill Carol Hansen?
I need an exact date.
killed? That would be March 28, 1979.
that's it. The murder date of the original victim matches the birthdate of the new one.
I'm all over it. Okay.
Taylor Lynn Grover, killed February 5, 1985.
were any of Smith's original victims killed the day Floressa was born?
Yes. Patty Johnson.
she was Smith's first victim.
she was murdered on October 9, 1967.
what do you want to bet our killer thought Floressa was named Patty?
so this unsub thinks his new victims are Smith's old victims.
Garcia, what about locations?
where did Patty Johnson, Taylor Lynn Grover, and Carol Hansen die?
okay. Okay. Hold on. Give me a sec.
they were all murdered in Alabama. In order
mobile, Birmingham, Gadsden.
and where were Floressa, Clayton, and Brianna born?
also in order-- Mobile, Birmingham...
and, oh, my God, Gadsden.
exact same places, exact same dates.
that's it. Patty, Taylor, and Carol were all killed only to be born to live again.
this is about reincarnation.
what are you going to do to me?
so, this killer believes that Smith's victims didn't really die, but hopped into a newborn life and kept on living.
exactly. Reincarnated as Floressa, Charlie Clayton, and Brianna.
so what's he doing now, killing them all over again?
that's how it looks.
But...he believes in reincarnation, right?
who's to say that these new victims haven't just jumped into somebody else's body, the way he believes they did the first time?
well, maybe in his mind they already have.
see, a fundamental tenet of reincarnation is that you can come back in any life form, not just human.
that would explain the larvae.
this unsub is introducing a newly hatched life form next to the victims as he kills them.
it's a new life form waiting right there, ready to receive the spirit of the one that just died.
he thinks that the people he's killing get reincarnated as flies?
he's making sure they don't come back in human form again.
ensuring that this death ends the cycle.
if he believes it about the victims, he must believe it about himself.
Garcia, can you find out exactly where and when Russell Smith died, and then see who was born in the same place at the same time?
Russell Smith died January 19, 1988.
tuscaloosa. Shot.
taken to Hobson Regional Medical Center.
born exact same day, exact same hospital.
do you have an address for Kestler?
it is...it's not local.
uh, 3088 Lakehawk Street, Apartment 5, Chandler, Arizona.
you got a photo? I'm sending it to you now.
that's our guy.
does Kestler have a vehicle?
Mm-hmm. He's the registered owner of a Ford Bronco, 1989, green,
Arizona license plate MAQ3586.
sheriff, put out an APB to all law enforcement within a 200-mile radius.
I'm on it.
Thanks, Garcia.
how come you're doing this?
it's that voice in your head.
the one you can't figure out.
I don't have a voice in my head. --You do.
maybe it's not as loud for you as it was for me.
for a long time I didn't understand.
it was like...
there was me...
then there was another me.
then a few years ago, right before he died, my grandpa told me something that made it all clear.
it was about what happened to me the day I was born.
I was supposed to be born two weeks before.
but I wouldn't come.
and then when I did...
things got all... tangled up inside.
they had to rip my mama open to get me out.
but that was okay.
I had to wait to be born for a reason.
there was a man who got shot that very day.
a killer.
you can't explain things like this.
it just happens.
it happened to me.
it could happen to you.
my mama died when I was 5 years old and I had to go live with that bastard.
old man used to smack me around all the time.
no reason. Just mean.
my grandpa always said I had the devil inside me.
the soul of a killer.
that's crazy.
no.
it wasn't crazy at all.
after I heard that story, it all made sense.
the voice in my head.
the two mes.
there was only ever one real me all the time.
that's who I am.
that's who I've always been.
what have you got, Garcia?
Chandler P. D. says Kestler's apartment is empty, but they found stacks and stacks of books about reincarnation.
all right. Do the math with each of Smith's other 5 victims.
find out who was born the same place at the same time that each was murdered.
that's who Kestler will be going after next.
Yes, sir. But this is gonna take a while.
please put on your hat of patience.
hurry, Yeah. .
we need to take a ride now.
don't hurt me. Please.
it's not that I want to.
maybe I am Russell Smith.
but it didn't mean I had to be a killer again.
what are you talking about?
I mean, the whole point of reincarnation is that you're supposed to come back and be better than you were before.
work on your karma.
what I'm doing now, it's self-defense.
one of you found out where I was, and you tried to come and cut off my brakes and kill me.
so I had to find you.
all 8 of you.
and then I'll be done.
Oh, let me go.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
you're gonna scream your head off, aren't you?
as soon as we open the door, you're gonna make a run for it.
no.
I don't believe you.
no...
maybe we should just do this right here.
no. No, don't.
no...
bad, bad news.
what is it?
there are 22 possible people our unsub could be going after, and they are scattered everywhere.
I mean everywhere.
Nova Scotia to Hawaii to Pennsylvania
any in the Pensacola area?
no.
there's a Ted Sissler, who was born the same day in the same place as one of the older victims from Pensacola, but he died 13 years ago.
well, that's good, then, right?
one less person he's gonna want to hunt down and kill.
no, that's bad.
sheriff, check to see if any 13-year-olds went missing in the last 24 hours, and if Ted Sissler has any family in the area, put them into protective custody immediately.
so, Kestler has no criminal record, but he has been on the Chandler P. D. radar recently.
Why? 3 months ago he was injured in a solo car crash.
claims someone cut his brake lines and he wanted the police to figure out who did it.
And?
investigation turned up no evidence of foul play.
but the police said Kestler was obsessed over it.
he kept showing up for weeks saying someone was after him.
well, that must have been the trigger.
reincarnation cuts both ways.
Kestler thought Smith's old victims were coming back to get him.
he's a psychopath.
Aidan Donahue, 13 years old.
parents said he never came home from school today.
Kestler's car was spotted at a downtown motel.
let's go.
come here.
no. No, no...
Aidan, it's all right. We're the FBI.
we're the good guys. Are you okay?
the man that was here, where did he go?
I don't know.
he just...took off.
did he say where he was going?
no. Only that this wasn't over.
he was gonna come back.
here? He was gonna come back here to this room?
no. The guy was crazy.
he said he was coming back in 20 years.
he'd come back and get me in 20 years.
I think I know where he's going.
ESCAMBIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
can I help you?
Yes. I'm looking for the delivery rooms.
is your wife having a baby?
Yes.

the doctrine of the immortality of the soul has more threat than comfort.
when did you get back? No one told me you got back and I've been worried like crazy.
because they said you were shot, with bullets.
I'm fine.
I can't believe you were shot with bu
I got shot in my bulletproof vest, baby girl.
it's just a couple bruises. I'm okay.
why don't they make better vests? That's not bulletproof.
it's like when you fall in the pool and your watch stops working.
that's water-resistant, not waterproof. They should
I'm just fine. See? It's just a couple bruises.
how -- how long do you have to be taped up like this?
I don't know. A couple days, maybe.
Oh. Okay.
are you relaxed now?
Yeah. I'm relaxed. Hey, if you need someone to help you, you know, put new bindings on, rewrap or wrap, unwrap
Hey, you guys--oh!
we... hey.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Hotch needs us at the round table.
Why? We just landed.
he said it's important.
it was nothing. I wasn't doing anything.
yesterday while we were in Florida, a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
and, as you know, last month a body was found in Dallas with its mouth sewn shut, like the silencer.
what looked then to be a possible one-time copycat now has to be examined in a different light.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we've solved.
that's how it looks.
this is now an active case, which we'll be investigating along with our other cases.
look, a while back, I had some medical issues
headaches--and there was a geneticist that I reached out to.
I guess I just-- I think it's funny how we've been doing this for 6 months and we've never met.
do you--do you think he knows about us? As far as I can tell he doesn't.
well, guess I'll talk to you next Sunday. Bye. Love you.
but if you've got somebody new in your life to talk to... I'd just like to know who she is.
cause She's gotta be one hell of a woman to keep up with you.
I think the stalker's gone. The e-mails have stopped.
what about the phone calls? No, I haven't gotten any.
no more heavy breathing on the machine, no more hang-ups.
is this about... phone booth girl? She wants to meet.
wait. You guys have never met? Aren't you curious what she looks like?
Oh, it doesn't matter what she looks like.
I mean, she's already the most beautiful girl in the world to me.
hello. Maeve, it's me. Listen, don't come to the restaurant.
what are you talking about? I'm outside. Go home.
look, I think your stalker's here.
have you the ring?
place the ring on her finger. On whose finger?
I now pronounce you smart and smarter.
let's get to it, you two. Get to what?
kiss her, dummy.
hello. Hello. I have a collect call from...
do you accept the charges? Yes.
please deposit $2. 00 for the first two minutes.
thank you.
Hello, I'm still here.
I'm sorry, can you please repeat that? Zug... Zwang
I got here as quickly as I could. What's wrong?
I need to tell you something.
our correspondence started 10 months ago.
she wrote me a compliment on my "Journal of Behavioral Psych" article, and for 3 months, this is how we communicated because she was scared.
scared of whom? She didn't know, only that he was dangerous.
horribly threatening phone calls, letters, e-mails no matter where she moved.
it's why I never called her from the same phone booth twice.
you don't know what Maeve looks like? No.
or where she works? No, I know she's a geneticist.
do you even know her last name?
then I have to ask you, how do you know she's missing? Because we always addressed our letters to pseudonyms.
and you're Dr. Joseph Bell? The real life inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.
and that codename is how I know she's in trouble.
the voice on the phone identified himself as Adam Worth.
that was the American criminal that Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Moriarty on.
and what did he say to you? Zug Zwang.
it's a chess term, it describes the point in a game when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
he has to decide whether to resign or to play through to the bitter end.
if you're right about this, then you're part of his victiology, too.
I know.
he thinks he'll get away with this, and he might.
I have a wealth of knowledge I should be applying to this case.
behavioral patterns of violent stalkers. Tactical recovery strategies.
victim survival odds.
but right now I can't focus on anything more than 4 seconds at a time.
which makes me the dumbest person in the room.
so... please help me.
help me find her.
we don't know if we have a case. So we'll be working on personal time.
does anybody want to leave?
good. Let's get to work.
being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
lao Tsu.
based on Maeve's description of the unsub in her letters, he seems like a classically possessive stalker.
one who craves validation and recognition.
why won't you see me?" "Do you think you're better than me?
this comes up again and again. So does his suicidal ideation.
when I find you, I'm going to kill you, then myself.
murder-suicide is the ultimate "I love you" to these guys.
when does the unsub start targeting Maeve? Maeve said it started out of the blue.
my guess is it was some sort of accidental when she acted some
something she probably wasn't even aware of.
that's gonna make the unsub hard to find.
and Maeve, too, until we know more about her.
I found her. There are a lot many geneticists with that name, but Dr. Maeve Donovan took a sabbatical from Mendel University 10 months ago.
that fits the timeline. Oh, she's a smart cookie. She burned her credit history, but her parents rent a little loft at the warehouse five days ago.
did the parents sell their house recently? No.
they might be helping her hide. Morgan, you and JJ go to the loft.
Blake and Dave, go to the lab. How clear is your head?
not very clear-- - I want to talk to her parents, but I want you to observe the interview.
Reid. I have a picture of her.
do you want to see what she looks like? No.
so what are we, 10 miles outside of the city?
her parents wanted to put some distance between her and her stalker, but they may have just made her an easier target.
FBI. Anybody home?
it's clear. This is definitely a crime scene.
it must have been a hell of a fight. Smash...
then hit.
there is no sign of forced entry. Maeve was on high alert.
exactly.
then how did this unsub get her to let her guard down?
here you go. That's the personnel files of everyone in the lab.
not much there. Only 5 docs work here besides her.
and they're all men. Did any of them take a particular interest in her work?
we all did.
her last project on cyclic adenosine monophosphate-- revolutionary stuff.
quite frankly, she made connections before I could even see them.
we know the feeling. When was the last time that you spoke to Maeve?
6 days ago. 5, after we got her situated in the loft.
why didn't she leave the DC area? I have health issues.
cancer. And she wanted to stay close.
we were working on an oncology project together, and it was easier to share data if she was nearby.
you're a geneticist, too? Retired.
I got out when I heard there was a new Dr. Donovan in town.
I know this is difficult for both of you, but is there anyone that you suspect?
the police ruled him out early on, but we never liked him.
who is Bobby? Her fiance.
and there were issues? Bobby was her first serious relationship.
it was only till after they got engaged she realized...
he was a controlling bastard.
sorry. But it's true. Well, we need to talk to him.
fiance? Reid, slow down.
she had a fiance, Hotch. Let us handle it.
who? We're looking for Robert Putnam.
do you know where he is? He's in the back.
we need to talk to him. And who are you?
I'm Diane, his girlfriend. Hey, sweetheart, who is it?
robert Putnam, we'd like to...
I know you. Out.
out.
wait, I need to talk to him, Hotch. Why did he just recognize you?
a couple of weeks ago, Maeve and I were gonna meet. He was at the restaurant.
I caught him looking at me and something felt off about him.
and you're telling me this now?
I didn't know who he was and then a friend of his sat down, so I just assumed that I overreacted.
Reid, if he's the unsub, you're a material witness.
you can't be in there. You know that. Stay here.
look, what's going on? Where's Maeve?
we were hoping you knew. Why would I know?
the same way that you knew that she'd be at that restaurant two weeks ago.
care to explain?
when she went into hiding, she broke off the engagement.
I needed to see her, to make sure she was all right.
so I hired a private detective and he found her through her parents.
when she made the reservation, I showed up, too. Why did you bring a friend?
because there was a psychopath after her, that's why.
for someone madly in love, you sure moved on in a hurry.
Maeve told me to. And apparently she took her own advice.
did that make you mad? Mad enough to hurt her?
mad enough to stalk the man that she was meeting?
there's something over there on that table, I'm gonna go get.
don't shoot me.
he sent these to us. The last month of our engagement.
the fact is, I was being stalked, too.
excuse me, doctor.
agent Hotchner said you were down from upstairs, Can, can you tell me what's going on?
we'll be in touch, ma'am. Thank you.
all right, kid, talk to me. I can tell you're adding something up in your head.
what is it? 2, 412.
it's the number of hours we spent communicating, counting phone calls and letters.
that's about 100 days. 100. 5. What if that's all I get?
well, it's not. You can't say that.
Yes, I can.
cause when we find her alive, and you finally get to lay your eyes on her, what's the first thing you're gonna say to her?
a couple of months ago we were getting off the phone and she said, "Bye. Love you." Just like that.
Bye. Love you.
I know it was just a slip, but
but she said it, Reid. She said it.
you didn't say it back to her, did you?
I was waiting for when we finally met.
OK, I'm sharing something I haven't told anyone.
every time we have a stalking case, I think Rosanna Arquette.
the whole Arquette family to choose from and you go with Rosanna.
of course I go with Rosanna, because Rosanna Arquette was the inspiration for two seminal songs of my childhood.
Rosanna," by Toto...
obviously.
...and "In your eyes" by Peter Gabriel, which gives one pause to think of the myriad of ways a man can be obsessed by a woman, and what is she doing in bed to inspire that kind of obsession, and can she teach us?
because I want to know.
he want detona that one.
JJ, is that...
I don't get it. I mean, I see the message, "I'm obliterating you,
but we already knew that. No, see, it's not about the message.
it's about the medium, what he used to draw on her face.
it's black eyeliner.
stalker's a woman.
that's why she masked her voice on the phone. That's why Maeve let her in to her loft.
she thought what we thought, that her stalker was a man.
but the question is, how could this unsub have known about Maeve and you?
Hotch, did you ever identify me to Bobby Putnam's girlfriend?
what? - Did you say my name to her?
did you call me Dr. Reid or Agent Reid? I never mentioned you at all. Why?
excuse me, doctor. I think I know who the unsub is.
Hey, honey.
hey
you're still thinking about him, aren't you? Yes.
are you sure that he was the one at the restaurant?
Yes.
he's an FBI Agent. Interesting.
I'm sorry. I know I said I'd let this go.
it's OK, part of me want the answer just as much as you do.
is that new?
do you like it? I, um, I've never seen you dressed like that before.
no, you haven't, in fact.
I've been waiting for months for you to notice me, notice that I'm better, sexier, smarter than her.
it's not until I debase myself, then you notice. What are you talking about?
do you like this, Bobby? Because you have seen it before.
is that...
Diane, Where did you get Maeve's clothes?
from her closet.
right after I bashed her head in.
she finally saw me, just like you see me now.
take a look, Bobby.
take a good look.
what have we got?
well, she knew we were close, so she came back for the fiance.
looks like they had a normal conversation, then she got violent. Same thing that happened to Maeve.
Hey, dollface, what do you got? An identity that's pure vapor.
Diane Huntington is a fake name. So is her address.
and all the phone conversations she had with Bobby were from a burner phone.
all right, keep digging and keep us posted.
we need to rethink the profile, reset everything that we know about Maeve through the prism of one woman stalking another.
you know... I couldn't understand it, Bobby.
I really couldn't.
you could have had me.
instead you wanted that.
I'm so sorry.
why are you doing this? Why?
let's just say she took something from me that I can't get back.
so I decided if I can't have my life, I'm gonna take hers.
what is she talking about?
I don't know. I don't--I don't know who she is.
after hunting her for ten months, after stealing her man,
I had to stop and say, what is so freakin' special about her?
I couldn't see it. Until I saw... him.
him who? The night you followed her, I followed you.
and I saw him.
I want what they have.
I want him. That's why you're doing this?
because of that stupid FBI Agent?
that stupid FBI agent is the reason why you're still alive.
you're gonna get her to tell me about him. I don't want to hear what she has to say.
but that wasn't a request. Ok, we know numbers on female stalkers are minimal.
only 10% of all cases are female. All right, what tops the list of motivators?
prior sexual intimacy. Erotomania?
no. Go the other direction. Think female scorned.
we slept together. You broke up with me.
now I'll do anything to get back with you. Reid, could that have fit Maeve?
could she have possibly been in a relationship with this woman?
no. No.
Spence, this morning you didn't know that she was engaged. Yeah, but the answer is no.
and what's the second-most common motivation? Celebrity stalking.
that fits better. Well, how? She's not famous.
Maeve's a star in her field, though. That's a stretch.
celebrity stalkers are usually nonviolent. You want to tell that to John Lennon, Rossi?
what was it that Mark David Chapman said after he shot him?
it was like all of my nobody-ness and all of his somebody-ness collided.
Maeve is somebody, and this bitch is nobody!
I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from. Um, I can't be very helpful right now. I should leave.
Reid. Reid, yes, you can.
you have 100. 5 days of communication with the girl and your brain lets you recall every word verbatim.
she probably revealed details about the unsub to you and neither of you even noticed.
there's too much of it and I can't sort through it with any clarity.
and pick one of us, someone will go through with you.
Blake. Ok.
let's get out of here.
you wanna talk here? Yep.
you play?
Yeah, I know my way around a board, but... that's not the point.
I want you to focus here and not on my questions.
so, let's try this out.
when you think of Maeve, what's the first thing that comes to mind?
thomas Merton. What about him?
in her letters, she will always sign up with a quote from one of her favorite philosophers.
Camus, Voltaire, Plato.
when we had the near miss at the restaurant a couple of weeks ago,
she left me a book with a quote by Thomas Merton written inside.
he said "Love is our true destiny.
we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone. We find it with another.
then...
thomas Merton was her way of saying good-bye.
Yeah.
so, let's talk about this. Hmm?
because this I didn't expect.
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me catch you up.
I found these letters in Maeve's loft, and I guess she didn't get around to sending this one, and...it's really good.
about the blindfold today, I can't wait to use it.
blindfold. You know, I thought I knew your fiancee.
but I guess she's kinkier than we thought. It's not what you think.
it's not what you think" is girl code for "It's exactly what you think.
no, it's not what you think. Did you sleep with him?
I never even saw him. Why risk your life to meet him?
I've been alone for so long, I just wanted to be with somebody.
you could have been with Bobby. It was different with him.
different how? He was just...
he was just what, Maeve?
when we would talk, I would... It was effortless.
that is so interesting. Really.
so if you two had this deep connection where you're talking in your own code, why do you think the unsub would attack the fiance first?
I don't know, access, maybe.
no, something links the two of you in the unsub's mind.
she wants to destroy anyone Maeve had a romantic relationship with?
it could be jealousy or revenge.
maybe Maeve got in the way of one of her old relationships?
it's just not her.
you see, when men cheat, It's below the belt.
but when women cheat, It's above the neck.
no. We were broken up. I never cheated on you. But you didn't love me.
not like that.
now you know how I felt, to be ignored, cast aside.
it's not fun, is it? Just let us go, Diane.
what else do you want?
did you guys ever compare lists? The different people you dated?
I remembered 4th, 3: 40 p. m., I asked her if she dated a lot growing up.
no way.
do you know how many friday nights I had where it was just me and a microscope?
I thought that was just me. Oh, come on.
girls must have adored you at high school.
I was 12, it's kind of confusing once I got the note from this girl I had a crush on.
she thought I was cute but would only meet me if I wore a blindfold.
I did. And she took my shirt off.
that's when I heard the laughter.
most of the senior class was in there. Oh, it sounds awful.
Maeve thought so, too.
when we finally meet, I'm gonna make blindfolds fun again.
you had him eating out of the palm of your hand every Sunday and he never even saw your face.
I have to admit that takes skill.
that takes finesse.
how'd you do it?
Hello! Doctor, are you in there?
Seriously? OK. Fine.
just tell her.
there was a moment when you had him and you knew you had him.
what was it? Euclidean Geometry.
there's this thing called the Penrose Triangle.
he told me a story about how he tried to build one when he was 8.
this better get sexy quick. I'm getting bored.
you can't build it. It's an impossible physical structure.
it only exists in conceptual geometry.
but I said, every Penrose Triangle has its thorns.
and he laughed. It's just a stupid pun.
but he laughed.
that's it.
what about co-workers?
Maeve was the only female doctor at Mendel University. What was it like for her?
she once spoke about the awkwardness of being the only woman in the department.
when men are jealous of your success in the lab, they want it for themselves.
but women want it so you can't have it.
sometimes this institution turns us against each other.
what if the unsub wasn't a doctor.
what if she was a grad student maybe working on her Ph. D. there.
Yeah, but how could Maeve miss her? Each of the doctors has their own project.
each project has it's own team of research assistants.
they don't mingle, but they'd be the first applicants for an open position.
and if Maeve rejected her thesis, the unsub would take it personally.
and that rejection has become an obsession to possess.
I want to see what he sees. He sees you as his equal.
that's it, isn't it? I just--I have to let him see that I'm on your level.
great. You figured it out.
now, please, will you let us go?
no. No.
I have to show her that I can take everything that she has.
then she's going to remember me.
you, however, are superfluous.
I'm sorry, Bobby. You've always been the runner-up in this pageant.
wait. Wait.
please. Please... - Don't hurt him.
please! - Don't hurt him.
please! - Don't hurt him. Don't hurt him.
her name is Diane Turner.
she worked as a research assistant at Mendel University while Maeve was there.
did she apply a Ph. D. there?
Yeah. She was one of a bunch of internal applicants that got rejected.
looks like she left not long after Maeve. Correct. She now works at a local junior college.
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ take the residence. Blake and Morgan, take the campus.
what was her doctoral thesis about? It says here, "Spontaneous Cellular Death in Suicide Patients.
there's a suicidal ideation again. Except cells don't behave that way.
why is she so obsessed with it?
you still don't remember who I am, do you?
no.
I've tried and tried to remember and I can't.
but whatever it is I did to you, I'm sorry.
forgive me. Tell me what it is you want me to say to you and I will say it.
I just want this to be over. I can do that.
you just have to do something for me first.
get up there.
Why? Do it.
why don't you just kill me?
I want to see if you'll jump.
it's my theory that when you make a decision to give up that the cells in your body start to die.
can you feel it? Your whole body beginning to decay.
it makes it easier to want to kill yourself.
go. Go ahead, prove my theory.
I remember you.
clear!
clear.
is this a shrine to her dead parents?
her parents committed suicide. That explains her obsession.
guys, she is watching us.
Garcia. - What you got, mama grizzly?
there's a web cam in here. Can you hack the feed?
I read your thesis, didn't I?
you turned me down because you couldn't handle the competition.
no. I turned you down because your testing was flawed.
it was not flawed!
your sample was biased, you included your parents.
the science was sound. You didn't even read the whole thing, did you?
no, I did. I did. I did read it.
and do you know what I thought after I was finished?
I thought, whoever wrote this has suffer a tragedy.
and I felt sorry for your loss.
but you don't get a Ph. D. just because something bad happened to you.
no. You just couldn't see it?
you can't see that I'm a genius!
genius? Do you know what genius is?
I know that I am one. Maybe.
maybe you do have that gift.
maybe your theory could have had merit. But we don't know.
because genius isn't just one good idea or one successful experiment, Diane.
genius is work. Thousands of hours of work.
she's spoofing the IP address and she's encrypted the feed.
in other words, like layman's terms, this is gonna take a while.
what are you doing? Making a deal.
that's why you didn't make it. You didn't do the work.
but you could. Yeah, you could do the work.
I'll help you.
get on the ledge.
now! No. If you're gonna kill me, you kill me.
but I am not jumping.
because I want to live long enough to see Spencer arrest you.
Spencer has a different idea.
hello. It's me.
are you ok? She killed Bobby.
are you ok? Yeah.
I've got a concussion and some bruising, but I'm ok. Can I talk to her?
no. She's listening.
good. But I want to meet her. I need to see her face to face.
she has a message she wants me to give you. What is it?
the message is, she left you a present.
and if you want to find it, it's easy as pie.
what does that mean? I don't understand what that means.
neither do I. Spencer, it's a trap.
if you come here, she's gonna kill you! I need a map of D. C.
this is Diane Turner's apartment.
this is the nearest cell tower her phone call to me pinged off of, which means this is the circle that Maeve was telling me about.
what circle? It was a clue in Diane's message.
finding her would be as easy as pie.
only she wasn't referring to the food, she was referring to...
PI. Why would Diane give you a clue?
Maeve made a similar pun once.
now Diane wants me to see her the same way, but brilliant, the smartest girl in the room.
all right, assuming that Diane has a secondary location, where in the circle would she hold Maeve?
she'd need a building that would allow for privacy and control, a closed garage for prisoner transfer...
if she's copying Maeve's life, it might be someplace close to Maeve's apartment.
there's nothing in Diane's name. Well, what about Maeve's name, or even Bobby's?
maybe she forged his signature. Nope.
what about Diane's parents?
Yes. Yes. Diane rented a loft right next to Maeve's in her parents' name.
Reid. I can't let you be a part of this takedown.
we don't have a choice. If I don't go in there, Maeve is dead.
and if you do, you're dead.
Hotch, we've known from the beginning she's on a murder-suicide mission, but we never stopped to ask why she's on that mission.
we know now that it's because she wants recognition, the type of recognition she thinks Maeve gets, and I can give her that. How?
I'm gonna tell her that I love her.
hang on. I got a box on the steps. That's the gift.
what is that, a blindfold? Take your gun and vest off.
now come in alone. Reid.
put it on.
can I take the blindfold off? No.
hello.
hi
I was hoping you'd figure out my riddle. I mean, I knew you would.
the fun was just how fast you'd do it.
Oh, there's some brains, too. It took me a long time.
to be honest, i was distracted by your thesis.
you read my thesis?
I did. You know, I think your writing puts you on the same plane as Jonas Salk.
I've already sent it to the NIH. Flattery is not gonna get you out of this.
I know what's waiting for me outside. I've arranged for your freedom.
the federal government doesn't make deals with people like me.
not true. Nazi scientists were recruited for the Manhattan project.
Mafia bosses are regularly put into witness protection.
if what you have is valuable enough, the federal government will work with you.
and what you have is very valuable. And what do I have, doctor?
you have a brain that doesn't play by normal societal rules.
and I know that all your life the people you care about the most keep leaving.
there's a part of you that thinks it's because of that brain.
well, I'm here because I'm not going to leave you.
I'm here because...
I just... hope that I can get the chance.
chance of what? To be with you.
me for her. That was the deal, right?
you're choosing me over her?
Diane, how could it be anyone else? Prove it.
all right. How?
say it again. This time say it to her face.
I don't love you.
sorry.
I understand.
I don't need her anymore.
kill her and she won't have to live with the fact that you're smarter.
let her live with her irrelevancy.
I just want her to see one more thing.
liar.
liar!
shots fired! - Let's go!
stay back! Stay back! Stay back! ???
stay back, stay back!
Diane, Diane, there's still a way out of this.
you never wanted me. Never!
you lied! I didn't.
Diane, I offered you a deal and you can still take it.
me for her. Let me take her place.
you would do that? Yes.
you would kill yourself for her? Yes.
thomas Merton. Who's Thomas Merton?
he knows. He knows.
who's Thomas Merton? Who is he?
he's the one thing you can never take from us.
no.
wait.
do you think he knows about us?
as far as I can tell he doesn't.
well, guess I'll talk to you next Sunday.
Bye. Love you.
I need to tell you something.
Maeve is missing.
I think her stalker has her.
please help me.
help me find her.
see, it's not about the message. It's about the medium.
what he used to draw on her face.
it's black eyeliner. - The stalker's a woman.
excuse me, Doctor.
I think I know who the unsub is.
where did you get Maeve's clothes?
from her closet.
right after I bashed her head in.
get on the ledge.
if you're gonna kill me, you kill me, but I am not jumping.
Spencer has a different idea.
take your gun and vest off and come in alone.
let me take her place.
you would kill yourself for her?
Yes.
wait!
Danielle, it's Kelly--again.
where are you?
when I said let's go out dancing tonight,
I didn't expect it to involve you leaving me alone while you scam on some frat guy.
call me. You've got 10 minutes, then I'm out of here.
Hello?
hey baby - How was work?
it sucked. Tips were horrible.
thought I'd check on Spence on my way into work.
Yeah. Me, too.
are these all from you? - Maybe.
what's in that one?
mixed nuts and seeds.
I'm trying to think of something that will help him feel better.
so I went Reid-like and I did a bunch of research and it turns out that nuts and seeds have naturally occurring magnesium, and magnesium influences the production of serotonin, which is a happy happy joy joy chemical in the brain.
I don't know.
Spence, listen, if you're in there, we just want to know that you're all right.
knock twice if you're conscious.
is he ever gonna be okay?
eventually.
and he knows we're all here for him, no matter what.
Yeah. What she said.
come on.
okay.
hello. This is Spencer Reid. Please leave a message.
Hey, Reid, it's me. Again.
Hey, we're gathering.
all right, I'm coming.
now, listen, kid, uh, give me a call when you can.
was that him? - Voicemail.
it's been two weeks.
you okay? - Yeah.
well, no.
sometimes I wonder if I hadn't pushed him so hard to meet Maeve...
Blake, you can't blame yourself for encouraging him.
I know. I know. - It was bound to happen no matter what.
I miss Reid.
did he tell you how long?
no. I told him to take as much time as he needed.
at least I got a chance to say good-bye to Carolyn.
I can't imagine
Yeah.
ladies and gents, the Golden State awaits.
meet who was formerly Gary Porter.
he was found dead outside a San Francisco night club last night.
and Pamela Hurd-- she was found near a cable car stop in San Francisco's Mission District.
they were both found wrapped in clear plastic.
it says here they were dead only a few hours before they were found.
that's not long enough for the elements to have made them that pale.
cause that's where we enter the town of weirdville on the corner of eew and icky-icky.
both victims were almost completely drained of their blood.
less than a pint left.
he's exsanguinating them.
while they were still alive.
it might be utilitarian.
he needs them alive so they can pump out the blood themselves.
draining a body like that is extremely hard to do.
once the heart stops pumping, it's difficult to continue to extract the blood.
so the question is, how is he doing it?
Oh, I wish you wouldn't have asked that 'cause now I gotta show this picture.
there are large bore holes in the femoral artery of each victim.
our unsub could have medical knowledge.
it's possible.
we'll know more when we get there.
wheels up in 30.
my blood alone remains. Take it. But do not make me suffer long." Marie Antoinette.
why these two victims?
he's crossed socioeconomic, race, and gender lines.
one white males in his 40s, a wealthy hedge fund manager.
and an African American female, just started college at San Francisco State, worked several jobs just to get by.
Yeah, but why drain the blood?
is he doing it to torture the victims?
or is it about the blood?
might be a form of psychological torture.
while not necessarily painful, exsanguination does take time.
it could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting.
what about...
drinking it?
Fritz Haarmann, the vampire of Hanover, killed many of his victims by biting through their throats.
this unsub used some sort of tubing device to drain the blood from the femoral arteries.
there isn't any saliva on the wound.
just because there's no bite marks doesn't mean we should rule out vampirism.
bad news, crime-fighters.
police just found another body wrapped in plastic on a park bench, drained of blood.
I'm gonna assume there's not two creeps in the area doing the same thing?
Garcia, will you tell San Francisco P. D. We'll meet them at the crime scene?
consider them told.
Dave, you and Blake meet the detectives at the crime scene.
Morgan, go see the medical examiner, and JJ and I will set up at the police station.
we'll talk to the families, see if we can find a connection.
detective. SSA Rossi. This is SSA Blake.
detective Lenny Miles. It's great to have you guys here.
so the victim's name is Lynn Stevens.
she's drained, just like the last two, but there's something new.
new?
he's removed her eyelids.
I don't even want to take a guess as to why someone would do that.
there's excessive blood around the eyes.
he did this antemortem.
his sadism is evolving.
and his torture is definitely more than psychological at this point.
I just don't understand why someone would do this.
it's all still so hard to believe.
I just need to ask you a few questions about your husband.
Pammy was a great girl. You know?
really friendly.
she loved everyone, and everyone loved her.
and you two had worked together the night that she was abducted?
he called me.
he said he was on his way home from work.
he just needed to stop off and close up a deal.
he didn't have anything in his schedule for that night.
do you have any idea what that deal was?
after work, she said she always liked to go on long walks.
she was always going on about the architecture, how it's nothing like Oregon.
she had just moved to San Francisco?
are there any other friends of hers that you know who we should talk to?
she was paying her way through school.
when she wasn't there, she was always at another job.
just trying to stay afloat. You know?
if you think of anything else, please, don't hesitate to call.
if these victims are connected, I can't see it.
it's got to be about the blood.
Yeah, but even that's different.
Gary was A-positive, Pam was O-neg.
we just got the lab report back on the latest victim, Lynn Stevens.
she was AB-negative.
maybe these are just victims of opportunity.
well, it's possible the unsub abducted Pamela on one of her routine walks.
he could have lured Gary with the promise of a lucrative money deal.
I'm Aimee.
nice place.
okay, so it's going to be 75 for the hour.
anything more than that we can discuss.
all right?
someplace where I can get changed?
there.
I don't know which positions you want me in, but I'm very flexible.
what's up, baby girl?
I'm worried about Reid. - I am, too.
what do you think he's doing?
I think he's taking the time that Hotch gave him.
I get it. He's sad. He should be sad.
but I'm so worried.
and when someone I love is hurting, it's like I hurt, too, which I know is super codependent, but it's just how I roll, and I feel like I should be doing something, and I don't know what it is, but
all right, slow down, all right? Just slow down.
could you call him?
I have. He's just not ready to talk to anybody right now.
I need to hear his voice.
it's impairing my ability to work.
let me try something, all right? - Thanks.
hello. This is Spencer Reid. Please leave a message.
Hey, Reid, it's Derek. Listen, I got a work question for you.
the unsub's exsanguinating victims and removing their eyelids antemortem.
does that mean anything to you? Hit me back.
here's the information you called about.
thank you.
excuse me for a second.
what's up, Reid?
have the cornea or pupils been harmed in any way?
no, no. Blake said it looked like a very sharp instrument was used.
if he's taking care not to damage the eyes, then line of sight is probably what's important to him.
so this guy wants them to see what he's doing.
Hey, Reid. How are you?
I gotta go.
sorry about that. - Not a problem.
cause of death would definitely be exsanguination.
but the tox screen showed high levels of-- say this 5 times fast-- ethylene diamine tetra acetic.
EDTA. It's an anti-coagulant.
used mostly to treat heart conditions.
so the unsub probably used it to thin the blood.
the ketamine we found may have helped as well.
in humans, it tends to elevate blood pressure.
which is how he's sedating them.
if he knew that he was giving these drugs to these victims and he ingested the blood?
he'd be dosing himself as well.
well, that rules out vampirism.
is there any chance this guy works in the medical field?
I doubt it.
there are a few hesitation marks near the wound, and the hole in the artery shows a lot of bruising around it.
I'd say it's amateur at best.
all right, so we got an unsub who's picking his victims at random, sedates them, then bleeds them dry.
if he's not drinking the blood, what the hell is he doing with it?
wait... Wait...
be still.
What's--what-- what are you doing?
well, we got a hit off the prints.
the victim's name is Aimee Fortner.
it's only been a day since his last kill.
well, this guy doesn't have a cool-down period.
rigor hasn't set in yet.
I'd say she was put here maybe an hour ago, just after sunrise.
he's getting brazen.
it's his first daytime disposal.
well, this part of the park's not very well traveled.
the city's been trying to renovate every couple of years, but you know--politics.
so the unsub is familiar enough with the area to know nobody would disturb him.
Garcia, I need information on the latest victim, Aimee Fortner.
information is my favorite way to dazzle, sir.
so sparkly.
here we go Aimee Crystal Fortner.
originally from Santa Clara.
she was super pretty.
when she wasn't bartending, she supplemented her income by modeling.
a model? - Yes.
and she's got a website full of very artistic pictures of herself.
girl was not afraid to flaunt what God gave her at all.
Thanks, Garcia.
what are you thinking?
Reid told Morgan line of sight was important to the unsub.
we should take a look at the other crime scenes.
I might know what he's doing with the blood.
we believe that this unsub is a white male in his 20s or 30s, and he thinks of himself as a painter or an artist.
the placement of the victims tells us a lot about who he is.
Pamela Hurd was found near a painting done by little known San Francisco artist Henry Floyd.
Gary Porter was posed near a piece of graffiti art by a street artist named Cypher, who is currently wanted by the police.
and the third victim, Lynn Stevens, was found near a mural painted by inner city youths.
finally, Aimee Fortner was placed near the statue of Saint Luke, patron Saint of the artist.
this is a compulsion. It's not accidental.
he is obsessed with art.
all of the works of art are neglected, ignored, cast aside.
it's how he feels about himself.
we believe it's also the reason that he's evolved to removing the victims eyelids.
he's forcing them to see what he sees.
there's no sexual component with these murders, but that's because the blood and the use of the blood is his sexual release.
so, wait. What--what is he doing with the blood?
because he's so obsessed with art, we believe he's painting with it.
he has a quick kill pace.
more blood means more paint.
the more paintings he does, the greater the chance someone will recognize his work.
we think that because of his need for acceptance, he may be trying to sell the paintings.
so focus your canvassing on places that might sell this kind of fringe art.
what's up, kid?
if it is about the art, then it's clear the disposal sites are scattered around the Mission District area.
wait a minute. How did you know-- I had Anderson bring over some of the files.
all right.
all right, hold on a second. Let me patch in Garcia.
what have you heard? Is he okay?
slow down. Slow down.
Garcia, you should pull a list of all the art galleries in San Francisco.
Reid, I was just
how are you?
better. Thanks for asking.
and thanks for the baskets.
you know, nuts have magnesium, which helps produce-- Serotonin.
Yeah. I know.
okay, galleries. I got a lot.
focus on the Mission District.
I guess that's better than nothing.
it is. I will take it.
okay, there's still a few galleries, but it's more manageable. I am sending the addresses to your mobile.
I got it. Thanks, Garcia. - Yeah.
it's an original Hellman.
he painted it while literally on his deathbed.
10000
Madison. - Yeah?
he's back.
the museum is ready to make me an offer.
perfect.
if you want, I can tell him to leave.
no, it's okay.
Mrs. Riley. I think you'll be much more pleased with my piece this time.
Yeah, um, like I told you the last time, I'm not interested.
why not?
well, because this type of art is just not what we're looking for.
well, what is it you are looking for?
uh... Look, I can see that you're getting better.
all I can tell you is it's a little simplistic.
look, every good artist leaves a piece of himself on the canvas.
you have to find that one thing that's going to set you apart from the rest of the crowd.
I used blood.
an unusual medium is not what I'm talking about.
the world today doesn't make sense.
why should I paint pictures that do?
Picasso.
I'm impressed.
if I find my signature, you'll consider me for the gallery?
anything's possible.
Yeah. Thank you.
can I help you? - We're from the FBI.
you the owner? - Yeah. Name's Tre.
do you have any art on display where blood is used as a medium?
no. No, but there was a guy in here a couple days ago who tried to sell me a piece like that.
it wasn't exactly my taste, but a customer of mine happened to be in here, saw it, fell in love with it, bought it on sight.
you think that could that be your guy?
you wouldn't happen to have any security cameras in here, would you?
no. - We need the customer's name if you've got it.
Yeah.
I never quite understood these things.
it all looks like the guy had a seizure while painting it.
it's Emile Hartford.
it's early 20th century.
his daughter died when she was 8.
he said every time he painted, he'd be able to see her.
don't know how you see anything in there.
I guess that's why they say art is in the eye of the beholder.
Yeah. You know what else is in the eye of the beholder?
57 Chevy I told you about last week?
this morning, bam, it won't start.
now it's in the eye of my mechanic.
come on, man, are you gonna make me ask or are you gonna be a friend and offer me a ride home?
we're friends.
worked together for two years now.
I'd hope so.
you need a ride, Paul?
thought you'd never ask.
the unsub sold his painting to this place?
it reminds me of the eighties.
what? - Do I even want to know?
probably.
welcome. My name is Andre.
before we start, I'll need you to fill out a small waiver.
no, no, no. We're not a couple.
that's okay. We cater to all kinds of relationships.
well, uh, our relationship is with the FBI.
I run a clean establishment here.
clean, legal, adult fun.
calm down.
we're just looking for a painting you bought recently.
you're gonna have to be a bit more specific.
I'm a connoisseur of the dark and depraved arts.
I purchase a lot of paintings.
well, you bought this one a couple of days ago.
it's made with blood.
human blood.
like I said, I buy a lot of paintings.
I don't remember them all.
Oh, really? Because last I checked, withholding evidence would make you an accomplice.
we just want to see the painting.
just want to see if it's from the guy we're looking for.
remembering now?
possibly.
for that piece, you'll have to follow me to the spanking room.
I may have bought it, but I didn't realize it was evidence of any sort.
is that that you're looking for?
the tortured look in her eyes is what first drew me to it.
the guy was asking 1, 500 for it.
I got him to take 250, cash.
that's our first victim, Pamela Hurd.
it's definitely from our guy.
Yeah, we're gonna need to take this.
what are you doing?
what... What... What's going on?
it...
no, please don't. Why?
it's the only way.
sorry.
you're insane.
I guess every artist is a little crazy.
no, come on man, we're friends.
exactly. It's what I've been missing.
something personal.
I need you to hold still.
hold still. Hold still. Hold still!
help!
No! No! No...No!
well, we now have a piece of his art, but we still don't have anything to identify the unsub.
the lab's got a sample, but it's probably Pamela Hurd's blood.
master Andre said he was an average white guy in his late 20s to early 30s.
same thing the gallery owner said.
he signed it.
Yeah, it looks like a "B" something or something "B."
I'm going to have Garcia compile a list of artists with the letter "B" somewhere in their name.
it's not much, but it's something.
we got the report back from the lab.
they couldn't extract any DNA from the painting.
they said something about there only being red blood cells.
he removed the white blood cells.
plasma.
why would he take the plasma?
it would make it thicker.
easier to use as a paint.
what type of equipment would it take to do that?
you can easily buy a centrifuge online these days for a couple hundred bucks.
what other reasons would he have for separating the plasma from the blood?
it's a habit.
I didn't expect you back this soon.
you sure you're ready?
no, but I think I figured something out.
Where's Mrs. Riley?
you need to leave.
it's okay, Alan, I'll handle it.
I did what you said.
this is my friend, Paul.
I even used some of my own blood.
that's not what I meant.
but you said if I made it more personal, you'd use me in your gallery.
look, I've been trying to be nice and give you some encouragement, but I can see now that that's really not gonna help you.
so I think I just have to be blunt.
it's not good.
but... This is-- this is abstract.
I understand the concept, but splashing something onto a canvas, that doesn't make it art.
some people have it, some people don't.
you don't know what you're talking about.
maybe not, but that still doesn't mean that I'm gonna buy this.
but you said-- Look, I don't know how to explain this to you any better.
there is a difference between a dream and a talent.
look, I'm sorry.
if there's someone that you
he's a hemophiliac.
that would explain his obsession with blood.
he can't bleed without a fear of dying.
it's also why he would separate the plasma from the blood before painting with it.
it's an antiquated treatment, but some hemophiliacs can inject plasma into their wounds, kick-starting the clotting process that's ineffective in their own systems.
talk about it.
Hey, girlie, I need a list of hemophiliacs in San Francisco.
vague. So vague.
okay. - Garcia, for his obsession to be this profound, he most likely has the more severe version of the disease.
it's type B Christmas disease.
Reid, happy to hear you made it safe and sound.
thank you, Garcia.
okay, Christmas disease.
it does not sound very jolly.
it was named after the first known case, Stephen Christmas.
all right, I got 15 people who have trouble clotting.
he wouldn't stray too far from the art world.
most likely works in and around the art community, but not as an artist.
and he's a loner. So look for people with jobs where they don't interact with the public.
Yeah. Yeah. I got 3.
stock boy at a local supermarket, an art blogger, and a custodian.
the victims have different blood types.
if he's taking the plasma out of the blood, he must be a universal recipient.
any of them with AB-positive blood?
specificity. I dig it.
okay, if I factor in those "B" names I was working on...
and bingo is his name-o.
actually, his name is Bryan Hughes.
he is an AB-positive hemophiliac who works as a janitor at the Bay Area Museum of Art, and before you ask, yes, his address has been sent to your phones.
you're the best, baby girl.
Dave, you and Blake take the museum.
the rest of us will take the residence.
I'm okay.
Yeah. But it's good to see you.
you really don't need to be here if you're not ready.
this is going to take time.
how much time? - It's hard to say.
but we're all here for you.
thank you.
Hey, what you got, mama?
a compelling piece of information about this Bryan Hughes.
3 weeks before the first murder, he was involved in a car accident.
was he injured?
uh, no. And if you were looking at the pictures I am you would say that is a miracle.
it may have given him the impression he couldn't be hurt.
the other driver was hurt.
she bled to death.
Hughes called 911, failed to mention there was another driver involved.
by the time emergency crews got there, - She had already died. - thanks, Garcia.
watching the other woman bleed to death must have been the trigger.
Hey, what you got, pretty boy?
I think Hughes may have his next victim.
an Alan archer just came in and reported his boss missing.
Madison Riley owns an art gallery in the Mission District.
said there was blood, signs of a struggle.
Hughes even left a painting of his on the wall this time.
it's the same signature and it's definitely made of blood, which got me thinking about Maeve's stalker.
if this guy's a tortured artist searching for approval, in his mind there may be only one way to get it.
suicide. - Thanks, Reid.
I put my heart and my soul into those paintings.
you're going to get a first-hand look at what I'm capable of creating.
Bryan Hughes, FBI.
No! I have to make her see.
put down the knife.
Bryan, I understand. - No, you don't.
how could you possibly understand?
because I've seen your work.
and I know you may not be appreciated now, but I promise you, if you put down the knife, I will make sure that people see your art, and no one will be able to ignore it.
it's all I want.
I deserve that.
then put down the knife, and let's figure this out.
you know how many paintings van Gogh sold before he died?
Bryan, don't do it.
two. He sold two.
don't make us do this.
I gotta make you see me.
get the EMTs upstairs.
we've got another body over here.
well, I counted 5 baskets.
7, but I think Ms. Cavanaugh next door may have taken a couple.
I'm really sorry if I've been kind of...
you don't...
kid.
I didn't mean for you to come all the way out there.
I know.
listen, if you need anything at all, you just have to ask.
actually, if you guys don't mind, I could use some help with something.
name it.
sometimes the hardest part isn't letting go, but rather, learning to start over." Nicole Sobon.
come on!
I can't believe you did that. I got us free shots, didn't I?
Michelle, everyone was taking pictures. They better tag us, then.
that's the last thing I want. What if Adam saw?
he's at a bachelor party in Vegas.

what happened? I thought the girls were right behind us.
I think Amber Lee had to close out. You want me to go get them?
Yeah, right. I'll never see you again. You wait here. I'll go get them.
fine. Have another drink while you're at it.

I can't help it. You're so beautiful.
Uh...Houston, I think we have a problem.
must've had too much to drink. Of course you did.
get off of me.
Hey. Come on, just give me a damn second.
Uh...No. No. It's not working.
we're through. I'll say when we're through.
the theory of variation.
time to prove who did the reading.
it focuses on the universal properties common to a given language.
you're quoting the text. Give me an example.
French.
uh, spoken worldwide, but the same phrase in Paris might have a completely different inference in Montreal.
that's right. This theory looks at the cultural stages a particular language undergoes in order to understand its evolution.
who can tell me the first stage?
Anton. Pidgin.
pidgin is correct, Mr. Slavsky.
this is when non-native speakers use phrases from the mainstream language in a broken manner, often resulting in an overly literal translation of the meaning.
I thought cell phones weren't allowed in class, Dr. Blake.
it would appear that I'm a variation to my own rule.
last night Michelle Bradley went missing from a friend's bachelorette party in Austin, Texas.
Austin P. D. say that she is the third in a series of abductions in a week.
right. The first victim, Craig Pickett, he was a student at T. U.
he disappeared from a fraternity party.
he was discovered at the visitor parking lot just after sunrise.
he had been beaten with a blunt object.
and then Heather Wilson, she was a veterinarian living in the Old West district.
she disappeared from a speed-dating function thing and she was found in a nearby alley the next morning.
she had been stripped and she had been stabbed.
each of the victims was at a social gathering the night that they were abducted.
witness reports say that they were there one minute and gone the next.
OK, so this guy doesn't waste any time. He knows who he wants and how to get them.
that shows organization and sophistication.
he had Craig and Heather for less than 12 hours before he killed them.
we may already be out of time to save Michelle. No apparent link in victimology.
what troubles me is the variation in M. O. The speed and efficiency of the abduction suggests one unsub.
so is he using weapons of opportunity or specifically catering his murder ritual to each victim?
there's clear evidence of overkill on both.
Craig's face was caved in, and the damage to Heather's genitals was extensive.
he's angry, but about what?
well, the motive on Heather appears sexual.
she was stripped down to nothing more than a watch, while Craig was left fully clothed.
his wallet was missing. There might be some kind of financial motivation.
or it's plain old-fashioned jealousy.
he kills Craig in a rage and the beast is unleashed.
that's when he starts targeting women. His area of control appears to be quite large.
what's interesting is he dumps the bodies in the same district they're abducted from.
so he doesn't go far, yet he'd need privacy.
maybe he uses his vehicle for the assaults.
which means he could be anywhere.
the world breaks everyone, and afterward, many are stronger at the broken places.
ernest Hemingway.
gentlemen. Detective Sanchez.
agent Morgan. Agent Rossi.
appreciate the help. I haven't seen anything like this before.
consider yourself fortunate.
she was stabbed? It's a lot of blood.
it looks like Michelle was still bleeding out when the unsub dumped her here.
he was probably with her the whole night.
a large pickup truck or an SUV would go unnoticed in these parts.
give him room to work.
a bachelorette party and a speed-dating function.
both female victims were in situations that would have drawn the attention of the men around them.
so maybe the unsub was on the prowl.
the women could have enraged him by rejecting his advances.
well, they didn't reject him right away, though. He was able to lure both into isolation, which tells me he's got game.
well, what about Craig Pickett?
he disappeared from a frat party. Well, Pickett was the first victim.
and the unsub's use of a blunt object rather than a knife suggests that the kill was impulsive.
it's probable that Craig and the unsub are connected.
you should take a closer look at his classmates and professors.
excuse me for a minute.
what's up?
Michelle Bradley's crime scene photos just came in. Take a look.
he took off everything but the watch, just like with Heather Wilson.
no clothes, no earrings, not so much as a hair tie left.
but he leaves a watch. It's a compulsion.
it could be his signature.
Shanice, do you happen to remember if Michelle was wearing this watch last night?
I don't think so. I don't know.
do you happen to have any pictures on your phone I could take a look at?
Oh...yeah, we took a couple.
here you go. Thank you.
I counted 40 stab wounds of various depths of penetration.
he's targeting her femininity.
this type of anger stems from a deep-seated hatred of women.
or a woman.
so you think they're surrogates for someone who emasculated him?
the time and effort it takes to stab someone 40 times takes determination, the sort indicative of someone affected by a past trauma.
well, if his work here is any indication, he's unraveling quickly.
we should take a look at Craig. He triggered the unsub's violence.
he certainly put up the biggest fight. Here.
let me show you.
Craig was harder to control.
how did he get the bruising on his chest and back?
he was fully clothed when he was found.
there's no tear in his shirt.
he must not have been wearing it when he was attacked.
the unsub dressed him postmortem.
he's showing remorse.
Craig was closer to his attacker than we thought.
how long have you and Craig been roommates?
since freshman year. You two seem very close.
he was like my brother.
well, that's rare.
my freshman roommate and I didn't get along.
at all.
you told police you went to the game the night after Craig disappeared?
what happened after that? Uh, came back to the campus.
hit a couple of frat parties.
which ones? Uh--uh--I don't really remember.
I was drunk.
this must be tough, having to pack up all his things on your own.
didn't his family want to help?
well, we've been living together a long time.
I told them I'd sort through what was his and what was mine.
Yeah. That reminds me of another roommate I had at the Academy.
she used to make me promise her that if something ever happened to her,
I'd get rid of anything her parents shouldn't see.
what didn't Craig want his parents to see, Will?
was it this?
you may want to put that with the other things.
please, you can't tell them.
I've scoured the victims' social feeds, and I can confirm Michelle is the only one who turned up wearing a watch that didn't belong to her.
well, she's also the only one not wearing a watch when abducted.
time is somehow important to this unsub. But not the right time.
none of the watches were accurate. That has to mean something.
well, it's a message, but for whom? The watch he put on Michelle was broken.
could that be his way of saying her time was up?
maybe they were taunts, telling us that we're out of time.
could it be like time of death?
you know, like only the unsub understands it notification kind of thing?
you know, Garcia might be right. It happens.
not about the notifications. The times don't add up.
but what if it's a warning?
what if he's setting the watches to the time of the next abduction?
6:22.
I really hope you're wrong, Spence.
listen, I will take a shot if you'll ride the bull.
I'll ride the bull. I'll ride the bull. Let's go.
Ohh! Oh, come on. That was disgusting.
what is that? ???
Oh, come on, don't tell me you've reached the shot stage already?
you're late. Where you been? And you brought a stray. Who's your friend, Mitch?
this is Doug. He just transferred in from the Boston office, and he is in desperate need of friends and beverages.
and not necessarily in that order. Ah, you came to the right place.
sit down. Have a drink.
Yeah, you come sit by me, Doug. Ohh. After you.
you're stuck with me, I guess. You're stuck with me, pal.
how's it going? I'm Paige.
Doug. Nice to meet you.
I'm Paul. Hi.
you mind? Not if you share. Then we're cool.
thank you.
how was work? I need a drink.
Oh. Here. Have at it.
thank you so much.
so...
what kind of trouble are we getting into tonight? Oh, you like trouble.
who doesn't?
Michelle was a smoker.
if the unsub saw her on his own, he could have asked to bum a cigarette or offered her a light.
it's an easy in.
Yeah. But according to the M. E.'s report, neither Heather nor Craig were smokers.
they don't need to be. This guy's socially proficient.
he can adapt his ruse to whomever he targets.
well, does that include sexual orientation?
Craig Pickett was at a gay bar the night he went missing.
well, that fits with the other abductions. But why would the roommate lie?
Craig hadn't come out to his parents. Will was trying to protect his friend's secret.
or intentionally obstructing the investigation. No, I don't think so.
because of the physical brutality he suffered, Will assumed Craig was the victim of a hate crime and didn't want his death becoming a media spectacle.
so we're back to square one. Not necessarily.
Craig was the only victim that the unsub felt remorse for.
their connection could have been an intimate one.
you know, I gotta say that was one hell of a welcome to Austin.
I guess we got a little carried away.
need some help?
got it.
OK.
you all right?
what's wrong? We shouldn't have done that.
I thought you were into it. I wasn't.
I was. Just I...
you should go.
no, not until you talk to me.
here. Have a seat.
what is going through your head right now?
guys are not sup
guys are supposed to be with girls.
Oh, man. Someone really did a number on you, didn't they?
parent or pastor?
how do you do this? I mean, how are you ok with this?
I wasn't. Not for a real long time.
but there comes a point when you just gotta ask yourself how much longer are you willing to pretend to be someone that you aren't.
who says I'm pretending? Who says I'm...
Hey. This room, for one.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is a mess.
Yeah, it's...
I don't know what I'm doing.
then I guess it's a good thing you met me, then.
I'm a great teacher.
relax, baby.
I'm a great teacher.
get out. Just--don't touch me.
Paul, what the hell? Don't...
there's been another victim? Doug Warn.
an accountant from Boston. Hotch and Rossi are still at the crime scene.
body was dumped near a park. Was he wearing a watch?
6: 59. Was the watch still working?
if you mean by working, still ticking, yeah, but it was at least 2 1/2 hours off, though.
now that we have a few working watches, though, we might be able to see a pattern in how or why the unsub changes the times.
let's see.
2m) What time was the body discovered?
I don't know. An hour ago, maybe. Why?
you know the exact time? A jogger called it in at...9: 04. He was running laps, so the body couldn't have been laying there more than a few minutes.
I...
think I know what the messages say. Well, Reid, spit it out already.
0.0044212962963
OK, are you talking about Michelle's watch or Doug's watch? I'm talking about all the watches.
if you take the times the bodies were discovered, subtract the variance the corresponding watches are off by, you land within plus or minus 6 minutes of 6: 22 every single time.
which, taking into consideration the time between dump and discovery and all the public areas and the fact that the only broken watch we found was already stuck at 6: 22, it's reasonable to deduce the unsub sets the watches to the exact same time just before disposing of the bodies.
so stupid. It was literally staring me in the face the whole time. I don't know how I missed it.
come on, Reid, stop. You're the only person who can realize all of this.
so what does 6: 22 mean? I have no idea.
Reid All I know is what it says. I don't know what it means.
well, he used a blunt object again.
this kill was just as impulsive as the first.
were there any defensive wounds under his clothes?
no, but you should take a look.
that's combining murder rituals. Is he unraveling or evolving his M. O?
it could be both.
did he inflict the stab wounds pre- or postmortem?
it was all postmortem after the first blow. Back of his head. Killed him instantly.
next was the face?
actually, no. Based on the blood loss, I'd say the stabbing was first.
that doesn't add up. Why would he switch to a knife, then go back to the blunt object after?
well, he must be attacking the face for a specific reason.
it could be a manifestation of his guilt, like the re-dressing.
or of his self-worth.
maybe he didn't want the men to see him.
his self-esteem would have been at an all-time low.
but he only reached the low with the men, not the women.
Dr. Aylesworth, did the victim have sex before he died? I believe so.
I found traces of lubricant consistent with that used on latex condoms.
thank you.
we believe we're looking for a white homosexual male in his mid- to late 20s who is suffering from an identity crisis.
this man can't accept his same-sex desires, but he can't fight them either.
he's most likely been repressing all sexual urges for quite some time.
the first victim, Craig Pickett, represents a fall from the wagon, if you will.
intercourse between the two men was most likely the unsub's trigger.
immediately after copulation, the male's serotonin levels drop.
the high is achieved during sex.
that rapid change can manifest itself in extreme depression and low self-esteem.
combined with an apparent belief that acting on his attraction towards other men is wrong, this state causes the unsub to lash out violently at those he's with.
as his levels normalize, he begins to feel remorse for what he's done and he tries to correct his course.
this is where Heather and Michelle come in.
after killing Craig, the unsub sought out women that he was desperate to be attracted to.
but he's trapped in a scenario with an impossible outcome.
he can't force himself to like women, so when he's unable to get aroused, he becomes depressed again and lashes out in anger to the people he blames for his impotence.
the circular logic dictating his never-ending cycle was not formed overnight.
it most likely came about due to years of serious abuse, either emotional, physical, or both.
we're more than friends.
what are you talking about? I like him. Like like him.
the hell you do. Don't even think like that, son.
it's how I feel. No, it isn't.
it can't be. He's taken advantage of you somehow.
he hasn't. It's the truth.
truth?
the truth?
I'll show you the truth.
the most popular motive for trying to overcome same-sex attraction is the need to be accepted by the parent or loved one who has rejected the individual because of their homosexuality.
so focus on men who grew up in a broken home and suffered under the guardianship of a domineering parent, as well as those who fell victim to bigotry or bullying.
tell her she's beautiful.
I am, aren't I? You're an abomination!
I'm a great teacher. You're doing it wrong.
I'm gonna make you a real man.
an abomination!
the bottom line is this unsub will not stop killing.
with each failed attempt to become aroused by women or to avoid giving in to his same-sex urges, he becomes more desperate and more dangerous. Thank you.
Oh, thank God you're ok.
you haven't been answering your phone all day and I thought something had happened to you, too.
what are you talking about?
Doug was murdered last night.
what? Yeah, it must have happened after you dropped him off.
he didn't show up to work and so I
I went by his apartment and there were cops everywhere.
What'd you tell them?
nothing. I came straight here to make sure you were ok.
I'm fine.
fine, I promise.
getting the 4-1-1 on a 6-2-2 is not easy.
I am looking up that date, and June 22 is quite eventful in recent history.
it sounds like miss thing's got something good. Well, uh, let's see.
on this date in 1990, Florida banned the wearing of thong bikinis.
I said good, baby girl.
right, right. Ok.
let's see. June 22, 1992,
supreme Court ruled Minnesota hate crime laws violated free speech.
the defendant burned a cross on the front yard of an African-American family's house who lived next door.
nothing in the unsub's profile suggests racial motivation, though.
no, but the cross has me thinking.
many religions suggest that following through on homosexual desires invites condemnation.
what if the unsub is struggling with his faith?
Garcia, are there any 6: 22 Bible passages that are relevant?
Yeah, I thought of that, but the most popular one is Matthew 6: 22 and it has to do with lights and eyes.
I don't see how that fits. All right, well, let's look at this another way.
what are the passages that specifically relate to homosexuality?
that's it. He's not saying 6: 22. He's saying 18: 22.
as in Leviticus 18: 22.
thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind, for it is an abomination.
he converted 18: 22 to 6: 22 p. m.
like military time.
maybe the unsub suffered abuse at the hands of someone citing God's will that he should change.
it wouldn't be the first time someone took the good book and twisted it for their own agenda.
OK, but if you wanted to change someone's sexual orientation, how could you do it? I mean, you're not gonna guilt somebody into that.
uh, I'm seeing some stuff about an ex-gay movement.
uh, it looks like some kind of a 12-step program.
a 12-step program usually doesn't traumatize the participant.
but conversion therapy might.
several conversion camps have been shut down recently cause their methods border on torture.
Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children? None of them would.
even a religion that frowns on homosexuality. None of them would cross that line.
Garcia, are there conversion camps in the area?
I got a hit. Camp Willing operates just outside of Austin.
their motto is, "It's time to change."
and guess which biblical passage is on their home page.
what are you doing in here? I had to use the bathroom.
is this Doug's blood?
it's not my fault.
not your fault. Whose fault was it, Paul?
theirs. Theirs?
Yeah! How could it be their fault? They haven't laid a hand on you in years.
you know what they did to me?
of course I do. They did the same thing to me, too.
there we go. No forgetting what time it is now.
best hurry off. You don't want to be late for class, do you?
I can't let you leave yet, Mitch.
we have to work some things out first.
our main purpose is to promote positive changes for the conflicted individuals who come here.
there doesn't seem to be much room for self-expression.
we try to keep things as uniform as possible.
we're not trying to stifle them.
it's just that progressive behavior in many ways can unravel their recovery efforts.
such as colors?
earth tones like brown or tan are the go-to.
navy blue if the color doesn't fade or become too bright.
because bright blue would be considered too feminine? Exactly.
and the auto shop aids in conversion how?
we've found that immersing the boys in traditional male gender roles stimulates an appreciation of their own masculinity.
I know it seems extreme, but you have to remember, our participants are in a fragile state of mind.
they come here confused, looking for answers.
we show them that the path to redemption doesn't need to be walked alone.
you sound like you speak from experience.
I'm a graduate.
the camp taught me to reject societal influences that were steering me in the wrong direction.
and now I try to pass that knowledge on.
come. When a new participant arrives, we have to evaluate their personal property before it can be returned to them.
items like musical soundtracks or diaries are destroyed.
long hair is cut, dyed hair shaved, no earrings.
that sort of thing.
the watch is standard issue? Cell phones aren't permitted.
the watches are so that no one will be late to any of their lessons.
structure and timeliness become an important part of promoting change.
and what if someone breaks the rules? It's uncommon.
uncommon but not unheard of.
Oh, occasionally a student will act out or reject certain elements of the program.
what happens to those who act out?
advanced therapy under supervision of a senior counselor.
could you be more specific? I'm afraid I can't.
parents and staff sign confidentiality agreements to protect the parents' right to privacy.
and what about the children's rights?
was there anything else I can help you with, agents?
Yes. We'd like a list of program participants dating back the past 15 years.
all we want are names. That's quite impossible.
those records are confidential. Well, let's make them unconfidential.
or we'll be back here with a court order.
whoa, that's a lot of names.
cross the list with known associates of each victim and see if you get a hit.
and, Garcia, flag the participants who didn't finish the program.
they're most likely the ones who had to endure this so-called advanced therapy.
with Xs and Os I go. Thank you.
you should have seen it.
all sense of individuality was stripped away.
and these kids were young. You're sure it was the same watch?
the unsub went to that camp.
the watch he put on Michelle's wrist was the exact same model that all the kids were wearing.
what do you think was behind that padlocked door? Well, it could be anything.
I mean, come on, we've all read the stories.
a conversion camp was just shut down last year for using electric shock therapy on children.
another stripped the kids naked and screamed profanities at them.
we need to go back with a warrant. We're gonna need probable cause.
well, let's find some.
because there is more going on at that camp than they let on.
you gotta turn yourself in, Paul.
I can't turn myself in. They're gonna put me away.
what, are you gonna kill me, too?
no.
are you gonna turn me in?
no. No, Paul.
y-you just need some help.
I've already had help. You remember that?
no, I mean like real help, professional help. It worked for me.
did it?
Yeah. Me and Josh are coming up on like 6 months now.
Yeah.
it might throw a wrench in your happy union...
you are hanging out with a serial murderer and all.
Oh, my God.
those women. The ones who were stabbed.
that was you, wasn't it, Paul?
they reminded me of her.
what you got, mama? A man named Mitchell Ruiz went to Camp Willing in 2003.
he works at the same office as our dearly departed Doug Warn.
what's the catch? Well, Mitchell's office just reported him missing.
he went to go look for Doug, he never returned. So Mitchell either is our unsub or he fell victim to him.
I did a little research to see if he was one of the good kids or the bad kids.
it turns out that Mitchell's parents, 3 weeks into that conversion camp, they started making private payments to a dummy corp that was shut down two years ago for prostitution, as in one prostitute, Isabella Grant.
and from the amount of money they were paying her, you have to wonder what morals she wasn't willing to chew up and swallow.
miss Grant, my name's Aaron Hotchner. I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to talk to you about Camp Willing.
what are you offering? You don't seem surprised.
it was a matter of time.
and you've already got me in here for everything else.
so what are you gonna give me if I talk?
I don't make deals with child molesters. I didn't molest anyone.
I was hired to help those kids.
being paid to prey on your victims doesn't change anything.
I had parental consent.
is that what the camp told you to make you feel better?
they didn't have to.
Why? Because you didn't care?
or because you'd spoken to the parents directly?
you show absolutely no remorse for what you've done.
why should you?
the smaller the victim, the easier to control.
and that's what it's all about for you, isn't it? Control.
it's why you're showing me all this false confidence.
I'm done talking. You've said plenty.
a professional like yourself wouldn't trust the camp to protect you.
you had to get some sort of insurance directly from the parents, didn't you?
make sure that they were just as culpable for the crime.
your word against theirs wouldn't hold up in court, not with a child testifying to your abuse.
unless, of course, the abuse damned the parents as well.
they were in the room with you, weren't they?
you made them watch.
where are you going? What about my deal?
we never had a deal.
why didn't it work? Why didn't what work?
with the girls. Why couldn't I just
why couldn't I just do it? You killed them.
what more did you want to do? Not that.
it.
I could always get it up for her. Well, then we were teenagers.
we could practically get it up for tomato soup.
you ever wonder why we broke up? You ever wonder that?
I'm pretty sure that year of hell had something to do with it. Yeah, a year.
you were lucky.
I screwed up, Mitch. I...I thought that maybe those girls could fix me.
Paul, listen to me.
you don't need fixing.
you just need a little bit of help.
now, please, man, just give me the gun.
you know that this isn't the way.
relax. You got it.
you're so beautiful.
damn it, Paul.
that's not the way. Come here.
let me show you.
you know what? You're right?
I'm not the one that needs fixing.
Garcia, I need you to track who was at the conversion camp the same time as Mitchell Ruiz, and then narrow that to those whose parents made payments to Isabella Grant's dummy corporation.
Uh...Only one name matches. Paul Westin.
he went to the same school as Mitchell, and his mom was killed in action in Iraq when he was only a 'tween.
all right, find out everything you can about Paul and then send the address to JJ and Blake.
Yep. Sending it now.
clear. Clear.
clear. JJ?
get in the house right now.
what's going on? Are you in trouble, son?
don't you call me that! You don't get to call me that!
not after what you did to me. Paul, please.
what did I do?
what did you do? The camp? You remember, huh?
you remember that? Get your ass downstairs!
let's talk about this, son.
there's nothing to talk about!
what the hell? You gonna kill your dad?
I was trying to save you.
save me? Ha.
you mean fix me, don't you? Fix me.
all those years trying to prove to me that I was broken.
well, it worked, Dad.
it worked. I'm pretty damn broken now.
that's not what I wanted. What you wanted.
take his clothes off.
what? Take his clothes off.
what for?
well, they all thought that they could rape us straight.
I think it's time we see if it works the other way around.
we have to assume Mitchell is with him. The keys and wallet are in the living room.
could he be working with Paul? Everything points to Paul working alone, but that doesn't mean that Mitchell isn't sympathetic to the cause.
he experienced the same trauma. I think I know why.
they were in a relationship. They were abused for loving one another.
where would they go? With Mitchell helping him, they'd be focused on revenge.
Isabella's in prison, so he wouldn't have a lot of options.
you two head to the camp and I'll send the others to the father's house.
get to it already. I can't.
I want to go home, Paul, please.
he's the one that got us into that camp.
convinced your parents to let that woman do this to us.
do you want to make him pay? Of course I do, but not like this.
Mitchell, I'd do it if I could. But I can't. It's gotta be you.
and then what? It's not gonna solve anything. I'm not looking for solutions.
I'm just looking to cope. Right, Dad? This isn't coping.
this is crazy. You're starting to sound like one of them.
only one of us is suggesting rape.
it's Paul's truck.
son!
Hey, you're ok. Come here.
come here. Now you're all right.
don't you--don't you die on me.
don't do it! Don't do it, Paul.
there's nothing left for me here.
look at his wrist. Track marks.
what happened to you in that camp, Paul?
it doesn't matter anymore. Yes, it does.
you kill yourself, they get away with it.
if you testify, we can shut them down for good.
what good? I'm an abomination.
no, you're not.
if you want to live your life according to a single message, go ahead.
but try John 13: 34 instead.
a new command I give you.
love one another.
as I have loved you, you must love one another.
the best way for you to do that is to put that gun down.
Paul, you are a victim.
and there are others being victimized right now that you can help.
wouldn't Mitchell want you to do everything possible to make sure that nobody else suffered your same fate?
come on.
put it down.
...the standard evolution.
who can tell me the first stage? Anton.
pidgin.
pidgin is correct, Mr. Slavsky.
pidgin.
this is when non-native speakers use phrases from the mainstream language in a broken manner, usually resulting in a overly literal translation.
you scared me there.
can I hitch a ride?
look, I'm just trying to get out of the cold, you know?
uh...Yeah. I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wh-where did you say you were headed?
anywhere but here.
listen, my wife and I are staying at a motel up the street and there's a bus stop out front.
that's about as far as I can take you.
deal.
OK. Get in.
my name is Alan, by the way. Maya.
where you from?
California.
Oh. You're a long way from home.
how long you been back there?
a couple hours.
don't you have anybody you can call? No.
it's just me.
bus stop
well, here we are.
it's not much, but...
hope it helps.
thank you. Sure.
saw the lights pull up. I was hoping it was you.
I was starting to get worried. It took a little longer than expected.
who is this?
Maya. Gave her a lift from the gas station.
she's gonna catch the bus.
Oh, there's another storm coming who knows how long that'll take?
Oh, you poor thing. You're shivering.
you have to come inside.
we can't let her stay out here. She'll freeze to death.
how does a nice warm shower sound? It sounds amazing.
come on with me, sweetheart. Let me help you with this.
I've got it.
I am crazy about Sam. I like him, like him, like him, but I just--I wish he was more like out-of-the-box take charge kind of guy.
OK, well, what do you mean by "take charge"? Ok. Valentine's day.
I planned everything, from dinner to dessert, and by dessert, I mean me.
and I texted him to tell him about it and he wrote back, "sounds great.
octopus emoticon.
I'm not quite sure I know what that means, but I guess it's kind of sweet.
what's wrong with that? Not you, too.
OK, baby girl, did you tell him about this?
did I tell him... I wanted him to take charge?
not really. Not at all.
OK. Let me let you in on a little secret. Guys, we don't do well with subtle clues. Ok?
you gotta be direct, straight up. Just tell him exactly what you want.
I learn something from you every day.
OK, what about you? Spill it. What are you doing for Valentine's day?
I was thinking about a little candlelit dinner at Le Donkle's overlooking the Potomac.
Ohh...that is romantic.
look at us. We're all grown up. We're like... Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
and Savannah and Sam. Oh, can Sam be Jennifer Garner?
JJ? JJ.
JJ.
JJ! You're back.
and ready to get to work. How you feeling?
I'm--I'm fine.
don't get me wrong, I love my boys to death, but I was starting to get a little stir crazy.
well, let's do this. Yes.
do you want some tea?
welcome back. You sure two weeks is enough time?
Oh, I'm fine. And, yes, Will made sure I got clearance from two doctors.
glad you're ok. We should get started.
Yes, sir. Pittsburgh field office has reported two murders in the past 48 hours.
both of them were strangled, then stripped down to their underwear and then dumped off of a highway.
have we I. D.'d the victims? - No, not yet.
the guy has a lot of rage.
he's using some kind of ligature, maybe a strap?
it looks like he's choking them intermittently, allowing them to breathe only when he permits it.
but the M. E. report says neither was sexually assaulted.
that's odd given the fact that 80% of crimes against women involve some sort of sexual component.
well, it's the choking that gets him off.
some form of erotic asphyxiation filtered through a psychopath's need for power and control.
OK, what is this? Are they wrapped in shower curtains?
strangely, yes.
which is why I'm checking with a number of manufacturers to see where these were distributed from.
the M. O. says sexual sadist, but the curtain reads as remorse.
sexual sadists don't feel remorse.
maybe it's his shame? Or maybe he's impotent.
he doesn't rape because he can't.
and the embarrassment of not being able to perform manifests in him wrapping up his victims.
he doesn't want to look at them after he kills them.
which points to either symbolic or a literal emasculation.
we need to find out. Wheels up in 30.
OK, your homework was to dig deep and rediscover what sparks your passion.
how's that been going? Mm-hmm.
fine, once he... Finds the time.
Oh, here we go. I didn't say it was your fault, ok?
I'm just--this is what I'm talking about.
look, you two have already tried separation, so the next step is divorce.
but since you're here, I'm assuming you want to save this marriage.
so I'll ask again, how have the last couple of nights been?
fine. A start.
this is never going to work unless you start expressing your feelings.
Oh, right, right. The process.
OK. For the next couple of days I'd like to increase your sessions.
the focus should be about getting back to the basics of being a couple.
I want you guys to be more spontaneous. Go out and enjoy a night on the town.
last night we did something kind of spur of the moment.
and what was that? We checked into a motel.
Where's Alan?
sounds romantic.
there was a spark or two.
it was like our first time all over again.
I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it.
now we're finally getting somewhere. You gotta trust the process.
let's build on this. Any plans of doing it again?
definitely. Absolutely.
author Jennifer Smith wrote, "Marriage is a mosaic you build with your spouse, millions of tiny moments that create your love story.
this guy's definitely mobile. We might be looking at a long-distance trucker.
Garcia already checked into it.
she didn't find any major routes in or around the dump sites.
speaking of dump sites, our most recent victim was found 50 miles from where she was last seen.
it looks like security cameras picked her up at a gas station but never saw who she left with.
maybe that's where he found her. It's the perfect hunting ground.
it fits the witness' statements.
according to the cashier, the victim had been there for several hours asking customers for a ride.
well, she lived locally.
she could have made it home in time. Instead, she waited.
she must have been headed some distance. She could be from anywhere.
maybe that's why the unsub chose her. He doesn't just pick victims of opportunity.
he targets women who won't be missed.
good news, crime-fighters.
I tracked the shower curtains this creep has been using to burrito his victims.
turns out they're commercial grade, sold in bulk to a bunch of economy motels, a list of which I just sent you.
it makes sense. It's a secure secondary location.
either he doesn't want to draw attention to his home or someone is living with him.
Rossi, you and Morgan go to the M. E. JJ and Reid, go through Garcia's list of motels.
Blake and I will go to the field office and cover victimology with agent West.
pittsburgh, pennsylvania
local police are canvassing restaurants and gas stations urging female hitchhikers to be on high alert.
it won't completely deter the unsub, but hopefully it will limit his available victim pool.
where are we on identifying the victims? Nothing yet. You guys can work in here.
Thanks.
we should see if there are any unsolved murders that match this unsub's M. O.
the transient nature of the victimology suggests there may be bodies we haven't discovered yet.
I'll have my guys get right on it. Thank you.
these women were just looking for a ride. They never saw the attack coming.
25 an hour, 2-hour minimum.
Hi. Yeah, we'd just like to ask you a couple questions.
we've been canvassing several motels in the area.
it's possible a murder's been committed in one of the rooms.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
do you mind if we take a peek at your guest log or surveillance footage?
we don't have cameras.
we're a cash only, no questions asked type of establishment.
would you mind taking a look at these? Do you recognize anyone?
never seen them before.
this might sound strange, but are any of your rooms missing a shower curtain?
I noticed it wasn't there this morning. The room was totally trashed.
did a real number on the toilet. Got someone coming out to take a look later on today.
did you try plunging it? Do I look like a plumber?
you mind if we take a look? Knock yourself out.
come on, you gotta put your back into it, Spence. Where's Morgan when you need him?
look at this.
it doesn't make sense. The unsub doesn't have sex with his victims.
then why did he need the condom? Well, it takes impotence off the table.
he clearly had intercourse with someone after he committed the murder.
so, he doesn't rape her.
he has sex with someone else in the room. A lover?
who's also his partner in crime.
we're looking for a team.
C. O.D.'s pretty straightforward.
they died of asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation.
leather fibers in the cuts makes me think he used some sort of belt.
there's no defensive wounds. Her larynx was completely crushed.
Hey, Rossi, take a look at her fingernails.
for a woman who lives on the streets, she appears well-groomed.
Yeah, it was the same with both victims. I'd say they bathed shortly before the attacks occurred.
between this and the shower curtain, cleanliness is important to them.
that could be part of their ruse. They promise shelter and a warm shower.
which would be a perfect opportunity to carry out a sexual assault, but they don't.
instead, they allow their victims to get partially dressed in their underwear before they kill them.
Why? Because it's not about sex with the victims.
it's about sex with each other.
but if we're dealing with two men who are sadists, they would leave the woman naked to humiliate her.
a female partner might not.
so then we're looking at a male and a female who are most likely in some sort of romantic relationship.
and they're using murder as their foreplay.
you married? Actually divorced.
Why?
I just find it amusing we're paying you for advice on something you failed.
well, there's a lesson in everything.
my marriage taught me patience and understanding, which I try to pass on to my clients.
is that what you tell yourself when you go home to an empty bed at night?
sorry I'm late. Hey, sweetie.
Oh, traffic was a nightmare.
no problem.
here's a question for you. What's your favorite flower?
Uh...pink roses. And when was the last time he bought you some?
Oh, God, it's gotta be years ago. When did I become the bad guy here?
calm down. No, she's clearly picking sides.
see, there's that temper again.
I'm actually proposing that you take charge, starting with the pink roses.
think you can handle that?
for years you've been saying we don't dance enough.
come on.
and your love... If you were listening,
you'd know I was talking about the tango, not ballroom.
just tonight, for just one night, can we not do this?
just give it a chance.
I knew you wanted to smile. Where did you learn how to do that?
I'm gonna show you. I am a natural.
Ohh, I love that cologne on you.
why can't it always be like this?
I'm starting to realize that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.
are you serious? I'm listening.
I'm tired of following your script.
I want to take the lead tonight.
I'll pick a good one. All right.
were you serious?
sweetie, tonight, it's all about you.
it's all about you.
take a look at this. You guys were right.
I was able to match their M. O. to 10 other strangulation murders.
we were only able to identify 4. They've been at it since 1994.
looks like they stopped in 2010 and remained dormant up until now.
something had to prevent them from killing.
maybe one was incarcerated.
I'll start pulling prison records, see if I can't get a match.
these two have been in a relationship a lot longer than we thought.
but even if they broke up, to come back together and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.
love is strange. It'll make you do the craziest things.
guys, what if they're married?
let me help you with your coat.
your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.
Ah, she did, did she? Isn't he perfect, honey?
hmm. Sweetheart, like I said, tonight's all about you.
well, before we get started, you might want to clean up.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your husband? He stepped out for a sec.
I hope he doesn't mind us getting started without him.
actually, I do mind.
I told you I'd pick a good one.
this is a first for them.
aside from gender, the M. O. is the same.
something in their dynamic must have changed.
a male victim most likely caters to the female unsub's desires.
they haven't displayed that behavior before.
up until now, it appears it's been the male picking the victims.
which typically indicates a dominantsubmissive relationship.
it looks as though her psychopathology could be evolving.
OK, we need to look at this from a marriage perspective.
compromise is the key to any long-term relationship's success.
what if this murder was their way of sharing responsibility?
he let the woman choose the victim. That could be problematic.
now that she's been given control, she might not want to let it go.
dancing.
I'm impressed.
how did all that romance make you feel? Spoiled.
the roses, the dancing.
he gave up a lot to make last night very special.
Yeah, I guess I'm starting to realize that it can't always be about me.
compromise is important. I'm glad you're starting to understand that.
I gotta say, you both are making great progress.
I think I speak for both of us when I say we'd love to make this part of our regular routine again.
we believe we're looking for a married couple, to whom we can attribute at least 13 deaths since 1994.
he's a sexual sadist, and she's a scopophiliac, which is Greek for "love of looking,
meaning that she gets off on watching her husband kill.
like Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, who raped, tortured and killed at least 19 people, this couple's homicidal tendencies most likely surfaced once they met.
it's possible that the use of a shower curtain is a sign of remorse on the part of the female unsub.
up until now, all the victims were females, so it's possible that the change in victimology could be the husband's way of subjugating his own needs for his wife's happiness.
but a sexual sadist doesn't typically subjugate.
we think he could have committed crimes on the side that have gotten him arrested.
but wouldn't we have the bodies to prove that?
Yes. Which is why we need to take another look at all strangulations within the geographical profile that occurred during the gap years.
without his female partner's influence, the male's independent M. O. should present differently.
learning the nature of how that differs from their team dynamic will be the key to driving a wedge between their partnership.
in the meantime, all transients are at risk.
now that the wife has gotten a taste of control, she'll crave that feeling again.
Yeah!
and if the husband sublimated his needs with the last kill, his desire to fulfill his own will be what's driving him now.
thank you very much.
sweetheart! I'm home.
you're late. Ah. I had a few errands to run.
it took a little longer than expected. You couldn't bother to call?
no, I couldn't, because it would have ruined the surprise.
all that overtime
it finally paid off.
OK, turn around.
the minute I saw it, I knew you had to have it.
you like it? Mm-hmm.
good.
well, that's what I was thinking, Paul. It was 2010 the last time this happened.
boy, he just came out of nowhere this time.
I mean, he was way behind, and somehow he was able to pull it right off.
he's the guy that can do this-- Well, honey, I got a job.
but we're supposed to be going to the movies. The movie starts in an hour.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
please be on time. I don't want to miss the previews.
sweetie, we won't. I promise.
I have a 1989 strangulation victim dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found, only she was raped and stabbed.
his comfort zone. Could be our unsub.
well, I've got two more, '01 and '03, except these took place in Clifford, Delaware.
the M. O.'s an exact match.
I got another one here from 2013, Scottsdale, Maryland.
he was smart enough to cross state lines.
the Crestview rapist was operating during that time.
the male unsub never went dormant. Only the female did.
so when this guy kills without his wife, his signature changes to stabbing and sexual assault.
well, stabbing is indicative of rage, and it's most likely towards women.
and the sexual assault is his way of establishing dominance over them.
maybe their marriage isn't as solid as we think.
clearly he has issues that he's working out when the wife isn't around.
well, if she emasculates her husband at home, that could be the reason why she now needs to have control over the murders.
Hey, guys, we have a survivor.
Hannah Franklin, a 23-year-old waitress who was attacked on her way home from work back in 2008.
how long is this gonna take? I'm already late for work.
I know this is something you'd like to forget. You're damn right.
I still have nightmares. That guy left me for dead.
why would I want to relive that night?
because if you do, you can stop that night from happening to someone else.
it's not my problem. Ok.
unless that next victim's your daughter.
because it will be someone's daughter, I promise you.
it was...dark. I was on my way home from work.
and I had just cut through a parking lot...
it's ok. Take your time.
I was looking down at my phone. And that's when he pulled me into the alley.
OK, look at me. Look at me.
I need you to tell me what the alley smelled like.
I don't know. All I can smell is his cologne.
OK, then focus on that and let it guide you to the periphery.
Oh, no... What do you see in the alley?
uh, there's a dumpster. Ok, keep going. Keep going.
no, I can't. He's-- he's on top of me. Hannah, you're in a safe place. Ok?
I'm right here with you. No
what else do you see?
there's a couple on the other side of the fence.
they're getting into their car.
I'm trying to scream for help, but his hand is covering
can you make out the type of car?
no. Why not?
there's something in the way. What?
the--the hook.
a hook? What kind of hook?
a fishing hook? An ice hook?
no, larger than that. It's attached to something big.
like a vehicle? There's a large metal arm.
it's a--wait, it's a tow truck. Ok, great.
can you make out any identifying marks? Color? License plate number?
uh, tan, maybe white. I'm not sure.
OK, now focus on him. No...
what is he wearing? Some sort of work uniform.
it's greasy.
OK, now, Hannah-- Hannah, this is important.
does he have on a name patch? Oh, God, it's about to happen!
the patch. Look at the patch, ok?
No! No!
his name was Alan.
OK.
thank you.
it's Alan. Leave a message. Thanks.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
OK, I'm heading out the door. Bye.
Judith Anderson! FBI!
show us your hands!
drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
what's happening? You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
she hasn't even said a word. Hasn't even asked where her husband is.
because she knows the answer. She's hiding something.
DNA results. The condom found in the hotel room.
you're gonna want to take a look at that.
Hi, Judith. My name's Alex.
can I get you anything to drink? I'd like to make a phone call.
to who? Your husband?
you're coming up on your 20th anniversary.
Congratulations. That is a huge accomplishment.
we recovered a used condom with Alan's DNA in it.
nothing odd about that, except you've had a hysterectomy.
so, why use condoms if you can't conceive?
you seem to know a lot.
you tell me.
well, you just don't strike me as the unfaithful type.
I mean, Alan, on the other hand, he's a different story.
you know nothing about my husband. Well, actually, I know a lot.
I know your husband tested positive for an STD back in 2010.
you two were married in 1994, which tells me he isn't as committed to your marriage as you think.
there was a point in time when both of us were unfaithful in our marriage.
when I found out he had cheated
you thought if you retaliated it would make you feel better.
my husband and I no longer keep secrets.
I've know he's had an STD for years.
the reason we use condoms, to answer your question, is because he insists on protecting me.
that's how much he loves me.
so she's aware of Alan's indiscretions.
he contracted the STD in 2010.
that's around the same time they went dormant. The first body was found in 1989.
but Judith and Alan weren't married until '94.
which means Alan was doing this on his own 5 years before they met.
and once they were married, there was no conflict until he cheated on her.
that's probably when Judith decided she no longer wanted to participate in the murders.
she took away what he enjoyed doing most.
so she's probably not aware that he continued to kill without her.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages. Ok, I'm heading out the door.
Bye. Judith Anderson! FBI!
show us your hands! Drop it!
tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
what's happening? You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
I can't wait to see where this is headed.
when you discovered your husband was cheating, you took away the one thing that mattered most to him.
his partner in crime.
now, how do you think he dealt with that?
do you recognize any of these women?
how many times are we gonna go through this? No, I do not.
and these are only a few of the victims that he raped and murdered without you.
and which one do you think gave him the STD?
just take a look for yourself.
his DNA is all over each of these women.
it's the killing without you that's most painful.
it's the cheating that you can't forgive.
you're married. Where's your husband? At home.
and you're here.
what would happen if he were to slip up?
how would you know? A wife knows.
which is why you know I'm telling you the truth.
my husband and I aren't perfect. Look at these women.
look at the way he treated them.
we're rebuilding step by step, brick by brick-- He hates them because he hates you.
he loves me! I want to talk to a lawyer.
I've gotta hand it to her. Judith's not budging.
she's committed to protecting her husband. And their marriage.
we're rebuilding step by step"?
interesting choice of words.
Oh, I've heard those many times before.
marriage counseling.
that would explain how they were able to move through Alan's infidelity.
they were seeing a therapist. Maybe they still are.
green means go.
Garcia, can you check and see if Judith and Alan have a therapist?
checking now...
uh, ok. Looks like they sought help from a bunch of different people, but for the past couple of months, anyway, they've been seeing a Kathleen Benedict several times a week.
says here she specializes in something called insight therapy.
insight therapy is also known as psychodynamic therapy.
it helps patients rediscover what motivates them in an effort to resolve old conflicts.
and if the conflict stems from their marriage, then helping Judith and Alan rediscover what motivates them would reignite their compulsion to kill.
therapy was most likely Judith's idea.
alan doesn't seem like the type to take guidance from a woman.
maybe the emasculation we profiled didn't come from Judith.
maybe it came from the therapist.
Dr. Benedict! Dr. Benedict!
listen, sorry to call you at the last minute.
no, it's fine. Uh, what's going on? Your message sounded urgent.
Oh. Well, Judith and I, we might be going away for a while, so I just wanted to have one more session, get a few things off my chest.
I'm impressed.
I know how hard therapy has been for you.
this is definitely a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
you do something different with your hair?
no.
it looks nice.
here, let me get that for you.
is Judith here yet? Uh, no. She's not coming.
just you and me.
that was Hotch. No sign of Alan at the house.
he's probably aware that we have Judith in custody.
if that's the case, he knows it's only a matter of time before we get to him.
at this point, the guy's got nothing to lose, which makes him more dangerous than ever.
so where is everyone?
Oh, they all took off for the long weekend. You didn't have any plans?
figured I'd use this time to catch up on work.
well, I guess it's just me and you, then, huh?
excuse me. It's my personal line.
sure. This is Kathleen.
Kathleen, my name is Spencer Reid. I'm a federal agent.
right now you need to stay calm and not react. Ok.
is Alan Anderson there with you? Answer yes or no.
Yes, that's correct.
you need to understand that Alan is a dangerous man and he's wanted for several murders.
OK. I understand.
how can I help?
do you think you can get away from there without alerting him?
not at this time. I'm completely booked.
Hello? Do you think he knows?
I think you should step on the gas.
that's one thing I've learned in the 20 years I've been married, is to listen to how a woman speaks on the phone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you nervous? Alan, you're not being rational right now.
we can talk about whatever's on your mind. Or I can just show you.
No! Aah!
somebody...
somebody, please, please, somebody, please
somebody, please!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this!
Alan, don't do this-- Shh! Shh! Trust my process.
alan Anderson, FBI!
don't!
it's ok. Hey, you're ok.
the law.
we found Alan. Where is he? Is he ok?
he's fine, and so is Dr. Benedict, who he attempted to rape and kill.
Judith, your husband is going away for a long time, but you don't have to.
if you cooperate, I will move to get your sentence reduced.
this is the last time I'm going to say this.
I will never betray him or my marriage again.
you might want to reconsider that.
he certainly betrays you every chance he gets.
this is Gloria Walters, and the necklace she's wearing was given to her by her fiance.
she was raped and murdered last night by your husband, who we've also identified as the Crestview rapist.
can I see him?
Hey.
sweetheart.
you son of a bitch!
you're a liar. I hate you!
get him out.
I am so sorry. I totally could have made that recipe without cilantro.
it's my fault. I should have disclosed my food allergies.
but I could have asked. Take a breath. The swelling's gone down.
now what are we gonna do for our first Valentine's? Whatever you want to do.
I don't want it to always be up to me.
I thought you liked planning things.
Yeah. But if I'm always the one planning things, then I'm always the one planning things.
you're right.
so I'm gonna make the executive decision that we are spending our first Valentine's day at Patty's.
Patty's, the diner?
Yeah, Patty's the diner.
they have the best milkshakes in town.
come on.
I like milkshakes.
you, come here. Come here.
you know, that's why I blame you. What, me?
Yes. One more time turns into two more times, and now there's no way we're getting a table on such short notice.
girl, look at you. Can you blame me?
but as long as I'm with you, we can go anywhere you want.
Oh, wait a minute. Hello. What are you doing here?
Oh, my God. Penelope?
wow, it is so nice to finally meet you. You, too.
Hey, you must be Sam. Sam I am.
I've heard a lot about you.
Oh. Not guilty. Not guilty.
look at you guys. You're literally flawless.
you're the live-action Ken and Barbie. So where are you guys headed?
uh, well, we actually had a change of plans. Same here.
is what's happening right now what I think is happening right now?
why, I believe so. This is our first double date.
in that case, after you. All right.
and after you, sir.
each relationship nurtures a strength or weakness within you.
michael Murdock.
milwaukee, WISCONSIN
pardon me.
next stop, 27th and Leighton.
next stop, Greenfield and leighton.
next stop, Greenfield and Leighton.
good night.
excuse me.
excuse me, Miss.
uh, you--you forgot this.
thank you.
I'm Russell.
what's your name?
Gloria. That's pretty.
thanks again.
Bye.
Hi, Mom. How you feeling?
OK, mom, I'll see you first thing tomorrow.
no, I will not forget the orange juice. All right, I love you, too.
goodbye.
pain in the ass. Sit down.
don't mind him. He's hungry is all.
you, uh, you spare any change?
uh, no, I'm sorry, I don't have
would--would you like a banana?
banana? Yeah.
here you go.
no, no, no! Stop! Let me go!
8: 49. Good God, that's not even close.
why does it have to be such a fast mile?
have you ever even had to run a mile in the field?
no. I'm not even in the field.
I sit at a computer on my perfect posterior, like all day.
maybe we should ask Morgan for help. No.
but he has really good abs. Yes, he does.
but it's bad enough some bureaucrat is making us take this stupid test.
the last thing we need is Mr. Universe talking smack the whole time.
but he knows about all this stuff. He can probably, like.
teach us some tricks, help us train. Yes, but he takes it way too seriously.
I worked out with him once. You work out? That's cool.
Yeah. I don't.
in a non-traditional manner and never again with him.
he was all, "there you go, baby girl. Move it or lose it."
this ain't your high-tech room. My grandmama can move better than that.
he can be enthusiastic at times. That's a way of saying it.
but, no, me and you, we can do this.
me and you, we got it. A couple more laps.
OK? Here we go. We got this. We got it.
2. Let's do it.
incoming text????
Hallelujah. What?
we have a case? Yep.
thank God. Race you to the bleachers.
OK
we don't need him!
I'm just gonna have a heart attack really quick. Ok.
all right. Come on.
Oh, God. Ok.
you ok? Yeah, why?
cause you got a little gimp in your giddy-up.
uh, it's these shoes. Beauty knows no pain.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
what are you doing?
do I smell bengay?
maybe. I had an active evening with Sam.
I'm ready, sir. All right, let's get started.
Oh, great.
OK. So, this morning, a Wisconsin park ranger discovered 3 partially buried bodies in a forest preserve just outside Milwaukee.
two male and one female. He doesn't appear to have a gender preference.
decomposed. They weren't all killed at the same time.
and that is why I call you eagle eye.
preliminary M. E. reports they'd each been killed about a month apart.
the most recent victim, Susan Clark, has been dead approximately two weeks.
28-year-old exotic dancer and prostitute.
high-risk lifestyle. What about the other two?
I haven't I. D.'d them yet. 'Cause of death?
still working on that, too.
looks like they were all covered in bite marks.
from the unsub? Probably from critters out in the woods.
he murdered them months apart but buried them all in the exact same spot.
the disposal site's obviously important to him. Susan Clark was reported missing 6 weeks ago.
there were long-term ligature marks on her wrists and ankles.
he holds them captive before he kills them.
but what exactly is he holding them for? That's what we need to find out.
wheels up in 30.
No! No! No! No! Ok!
please! Stop!
please let me go.
drink. You don't want to get dehydrated yet.
what?
Hey, come back, please? Sir!
come back!
what are you doing?!
come back!
it is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.
hippocrates.
my friends in an airplane, don't say I'm not a giver. I have I. D.'d the first two victims.
coming to your tablets now. First up,
milwaukee resident Melvin Lewis 50-year-old divorce and truck driver.
next we have Rudy Hightower, a 32-year-old homeless Iraq war veteran.
two caucasians and an African-American.
this guy doesn't have a racial preference either.
there's still no connection between the victims.
maybe there is no connection. They could be targets of opportunity.
and that means it's not about who he kills, it's about how he kills them.
or what he does before or after he kills them.
Garcia, they determine the cause of death yet? Negative.
each one of them was single and lived alone.
maybe he keyed in on that knowing that they wouldn't be reported missing.
well, he'd have to stalk them long enough to know that.
Dave, you and Reid go to the coroner's office, Blake and I will coordinate with local P. D. and, JJ, I want you and Morgan at the disposal site.
it took us almost two hours to get out here. That's with you driving, too.
we passed another forest preserve and a whole lot of space on the way.
there's plenty of spots to dispose of bodies, so why put all 3 right here?
well, it's isolated. That's good for him.
Yeah, he may come out here to relive his handiwork.
well, there's no evidence to suggest that he killed the victims here.
so he does his thing someplace else and this is just the disposal site?
well, he obviously has a vehicle, most likely a truck or a van.
that's risky for him, transporting the bodies all that distance.
more chances for him to get caught.
and it's a lot of work, too. You can't drive to this spot.
it's gotta be, what, 300 yards from here to the road.
you know, we could be close to where's he's keeping them hostage.
either that or it's something about this place. But what?
well, if it is about the location, at least maybe we disrupted him.
now he can't come back here. Well, hopefully we can get to him before he tries to.
sorry about the wait.
we were collecting tissue and organ samples to send to the lab. Here's my report.
you able to determine the cause of death? Cardiac arrest, all 3 of them.
what caused their hearts to stop? That's why we're sending the organ samples.
tox reports? All negative.
any sign of sexual assault?
inconclusive. They're too decomposed.
what about the bite marks?
Yeah. About 90% of them are postmortem, from animals out in the woods
a coyote, fox, maybe, or a raccoon.
and the other 10%? That's where it gets weird.
they all had antemortem bites, too.
the first victim, Melvin Lewis, his were animal bites, but the others
they were bitten by a human. Pretty viciously, too.
some of the wounds are deep.
chunks of flesh are missing. We found several.
total of 11? You read fast.
were you able to obtain DNA samples from any of the bites? No.
it could be a form of torture, maybe a biting fetish.
didn't know there was such a thing. Oh, you'd be surprised.
we should also consider cannibalism.
when you get a moment, would you mind taking some bite molds for us?
maybe that's why he holds them captive first.
if he's feeding on them, I'd lay odds he's already got his next victim.
considering the specificity of the M. O. the body count, and the timeline,
I'd say those odds are actually pretty good.
Hey. Which one of you took it, huh?
Hello? Hey.
get me out of here. Please help me!
I'm can't. I'm locked in, too. How long have you been here?
Hello?!
I'll eat you. I'll eat your face off.
I'll eat you alive! Sir? Excuse me, sir.
shut up!
what are you-- Hey, hey, hey!
what are you doing?! I'll eat you alive!
get away from me!
no, no, no! Aah!
OK...
eat.
you'll need your strength.
Oh, yeah.
what's with you? You ok?
Yeah, I'm great. I'm just doing some stretching because it helps me keep my brain limber.
I've also been doing some geo-profiling.
the red markers indicate where the victims lived, except, of course, Rudy Hightower, who was homeless.
the blue markers indicate where they were last seen alive.
and this is the disposal site. So that's his hunting zone.
which means he probably lives close by. Ok, so something's not adding up for me here.
here you go. Thanks. If we are dealing with a cannibal, why does he dispose of the bodies? Why not keep them?
well, it's not easy to keep a body fresh. Maybe he doesn't have the resources.
maybe he doesn't require large portions of flesh to satiate his urges.
most ritual cannibalism involves the consumption of particular organs as a means to commune with the deceased.
but none of the victims were missing any organs.
which means it's probably not about the ritual but about the compulsion.
I don't know. He grabs them, he holds them captive, and then he buries them all in the exact same spot.
and how do we explain the first victim, Melvin Lewis? He didn't have any human bite marks.
sir, no, no, no! Hey!
no. Please--please listen. You don't even know me, ok?
OK. Ok, ok.
if you try to fight or run, you get the stick.
OK! Ok. Ok.
on your stomach! Ok. Ok.
don't move!
I'm not! I'm not.
Aah! That's too tight! It hurts.
it hurts. Please.
help! Help! Please!
please. Aah!
please...
please!
please, please...
OK, ok...
what are you--what are you-- what is this? Huh?
talk to me!
will you please just talk to me? Just tell me what's going on.
what are you doing?!
please!
is somebody there?
I can hear you breathing.
what you got, sweetness? Mama's hands are dirty 'cause she's been digging.
I got the 4-1-1 on our first victim, Melvin Lewis.
originally from the Malibu of the Midwest, Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
Melvin moved to Milwaukee 12 years ago when wife ran away with his best friend.
Ouch
Yeah. Luckily they had no kids.
no criminal record. Like super squeaky clean.
not even a parking ticket. He joined Facebook a year ago.
he has a whopping 6 friends, all from work.
he drives a truck, right? Yeah. A milk truck, to be exact.
but only did that for a month.
before, he worked for 10 years at an animal control center, but he was laid off due to budget cuts.
what exactly did he do, Garcia? He was a dogcatcher.
but like a S. W.A. T. team of dogcatchers.
he specialized in dangerous and trapped animals, including but not limited to skunks, a raccoon, and one time a giant python.
all right, thanks, babe. That could be it.
what, the python? No, bite marks. Of course.
that could be how he was doing it. That's why it was undetectable.
brain tissue, we need to look at brain tissue-- Ok, Reid-- Sorry.
I don't think this is a biting fetish or cannibalism.
I think it's a virus, and the biting is merely a means of transmission.
what kind of virus? There are several possibilities.
creutzfeldt-jakob disease, tick-borne encephalitis, but the most likely culprit is rabies, and that wouldn't show up in an autopsy except in brain tissue.
so since Lewis was the only victim not bitten by a human, the unsub must have used an animal to infect him first.
and after that, he somehow facilitated human to human transmission.
that would explain the random victimology.
it doesn't matter who he infects. All he needs is a host.
which also means the holding period isn't about torture, it's about incubation.
I was attacked by a rabid fox once. Shot the thing 3 times before it went down.
freakin' terrifying. It was like a horror movie.
Yikes. We need to have the M. E. test for rabies vectors in the brain samples.
and then we need to deliver the profile.
based on the demographics of the area, we believe that we're looking for a Caucasian male in his mid-20s to late 30s.
we just received confirmation from the coroner's office that each of the victims died from rabies.
two of the victims sustained significant human bite wounds, and dental records confirm that those bite wounds came from other victims.
which means that somehow or another, he's facilitating biting attacks.
we think he's a sadist who gets off on watching the attacks.
he may record them so he can relive the event over and over again.
rabies has been around since the beginning of documented history.
it has the highest case to mortality rate in existence and is arguably the deadliest disease known to man.
it's derived from a sanskrit word meaning "to do violence."
carriers literally go stark raving mad.
uh, I thought there's a vaccine for it.
there is, but the post-exposure prophylaxis is only effective if administered within 24 hours of infection.
once the symptoms appear, the prognosis is death.
get off! Get off! Aah!
it's also contagious, so it's at great risk to himself that he's chosen this method to kill.
which means it holds special significance to him.
he may have lost a pet or even a relative to the virus.
it is not easy to obtain a sample of the virus.
we think he most likely started with an animal.
so he may have worked at a veterinary clinic, maybe a pest control company.
what he's doing takes deliberation and patience and is rooted in a need-based desire, so he's not going to stop on his own.
thank you.
Chris Blythewood, 21-year-old college student, and Liz Foley, 42-year-old stay at home mom.
the only two people reported missing for the last month within a 10-mile radius of the hunting zone.
pretty good chance the unsub's holding at least one of them.
so I went through the list of vet offices and animal control employees, and nada. Everybody's clean.
guys, I've been doing some math.
based on the estimated time of death and when the victims were last seen alive, it appears as though the first victim, Melvin Lewis, was held for a couple of months.
the second victim, Rudy Hightower, for one month, the third victim,
Susan Clark, for only a couple of weeks.
so why is he taking progressively less time with these victims? He's getting more efficient?
he may have found a way to shorten the incubation period.
and how would he do that? Rabies attacks the nervous system.
it travels a few millimeters a day until it reaches the brain.
but if you were to infect the area around the head of the neck, the distance would be shortened.
he may be some kind of symphoraphiliac.
and instead of setting a fire or causing an accident and watching the ensuing mayhem, he just wants to watch them die. A rabies death is apparently quite the spectacle.
there are convulsions, spasms, then the madness sets in, along with uncontrollable salivation, which accounts for the foaming a the mouth we all associate with the disease.
that sounds terrible. It is.
and one of the cruelest ironies of all is the extreme dehydration caused by hydrophobia.
victims have a visceral fear response to liquid of any sort.
add to that confusion, hallucinations, and you can probably imagine the horror.
day 1
please let me go.
my kids...
we have money.
you know, if you call my husband, he'll do whatever you say.
we have a good--we're fine.
We--he'll do whatever you say!
he'll do whatever you say!
please!
day 6
get away!
get out!
get it away from me!
day 12
come here. Come here.
all right, now, come here.
out of the way. Get it off of me!
uh! Get off of me!
No! Aah!
give it to me, Dollface.
do you know that over 50, 000 people die of rabies every year in third-world countries?
thank God for monsieur Pasteur, otherwise we'd all be dead.
OK, so I looked into every known case of rabies exposure in the country over the last 20 years.
did you find anything? Cool your jets, hot chocolate.
I will let you know if I've got something.
so I've got something. 15 years ago, in a town called Two Rivers, Wisconsin, a 9-year-old, Hunter Cunningham, was admitted to the hospital with severe flu-like symptoms.
symptoms get worse, he develops hydrophobia.
turns out that 3 weeks prior, he was bitten by a bat when he was out camping with his family.
two Rivers is less than a 2-hour drive from here, and it's even closer to the disposal site.
a bat. That's odd.
actually, bats make up 12% of Wisconsin's mammalian population, and they're responsible for the majority of the infections in the U. S.
baby girl, what's so special about this Hunter Cunningham kid?
here's what's special.
a week after he was admitted to the hospital, he checked out of the hospital.
but I can't find a death certificate. It's like he disappeared.
what about his family? Uh, his father Patrick died 6 years ago of a massive heart attack.
and mom, Wanda, works as a bartender at the Tropicana hotel in Vegas.
any siblings? Yes, affirmative.
one older brother, David Wade Cunningham, 28-year-old resident of Hawaii.
and what's his deal? His deal is...
ay, chihuahua.
he works at Nassee Pest Control, which specializes in dangerous animal removal, and you don't even have to ask me, home and work address sent--bam!
how are you feeling?
why are you doing this?
you cold?
Yes. That's from the fever.
please just let me go. Please? Please just let me go?
I won't tell anyone anything.
I swear. Just let me go, please.
mom. My mom.
I have to talk to my mom.
to my mom, please.
she just had heart surgery.
I have to. Have to.
no, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...
just let me go. Just let me go.
no, no, please, don't go. Please come back.
please, just come back. Please!
No! No! No!
please don't hurt me. Please!
No!
you got to get out of here.
wait! Cut me loose! Cut me loose! Please!
no, come back!
it's clear here.
clear. Clear.
he's not here.
I think it's safe to say this guy's single and not in a relationship.
guys, look at this.
I don't know, you think we got the right guy?
all right, thanks, baby girl.
this Cunningham guy got fired from his last two pest control jobs.
probably for stealing equipment.
you know, I bet that's how he acquired his first sample of the rabies virus, on his job.
the acquisition of the virus may have been the trigger itself.
it's worth mentioning, the only known rabies survival story that didn't involve the vaccine happened right here in Milwaukee.
a 15-year-old girl survived the virus when doctors put her in a medically induced coma.
you think it's connected to this? Based on the sheer proximity, it's possible, but given the lengths to which the unsub goes to infect his victims,
I think it's unlikely. Hey, look what I found.
it was hidden really well in his closet.
he did not want anyone finding it and I think I know why.
please! Let me go! I feel sick.
I really gotta go to the bathroom!
I gotta go!
hunter, look at me. Buddy, it's gonna be ok.
David, what are you doing here? Get out of here!
turn that damn thing off.
1999--that was the year his brother Hunter got rabies.
by the time they got him to the hospital, there was nothing the doctors could do.
it's possible the parents brought him home to die instead.
and then his big brother David recorded the whole thing.
he was 12 at the time. That's an impressionable age for a single event imprint.
it clearly unlocked some sort of psychopathic fascination that he's still trying to satisfy.
I can't imagine watching my own son die, let alone from rabies.
it almost makes you consider euthanasia.
I'm not saying I would advocate euthanizing Henry or anything. I'm just
no, Spence, that's it.
that's why Garcia couldn't find a death certificate for Hunter Cunningham.
because his parents must have done it.
they couldn't bear to watch, so they put him out of his misery.
where is she? Gone.
when? When?!
I don't know.
but I hope she goes straight to the cops and they fry your ass.
she'll be dead soon.
and so will you.
well, why don't you go ahead and kill me, then, huh?
why don't you just do it! What are you waiting for?!
Yeah, do it, you sick son of a bitch!
kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
kill me! Never gonna happen.
Devon's got ballet at 3: 00 and I gotta pick Will up at sports camp.
what's she got goin' on? Small soy chai latte for Michelle.
that's me. Thank you.
I just--I don't know how we're gonna make it work.
unless Eydi can pick Will up. Where is she?!
ma'am, is everything ok?
where is she? Hmm? Tell me.
give it back.
now!
lady, you need to leave.
what do you want?! Nothing.
you want something, whore?
get off! Get her off me! Get off!
large cap, extra foam. You want something?
Thanks. I'm good.
you know that forest preserve he used as a dump site?
there's a campground. It's only a half hour from where David Cunningham grew up.
he probably went there all the time when he was a kid. We should probably search the area.
the body of the brother might be buried there, too. Were we able to reach their mother in Vegas?
she's on vacation in Thailand. We left a message on her cell.
go ahead, Garcia. Sir, another missing persons report just popped up.
25-year-old grad student Russell Holmes. You send us the info yet?
Yes, senor. Mom reported it.
she went in for heart surgery, he never showed up to visit.
all right, thanks. A 911 call just came in.
some woman who's apparently foaming at the mouth is attacking people in a coffee shop.
all units be advised, suspect is on foot and was last seen headed north at the intersection of Marshall and East Lyon.
I think Morgan's closer.
got it, Hotch. Marshall and East Lyon.
we're on our way.
hang on, guys.
where is she?! Where is she?! Aah!
Hey, come on! Jan, let's go!
where is she?! Give her back?!
give her back!
I'm gonna circle around the block.
wait. There.
I think that's Liz Foley from the missing persons report.
no, no, no.
there's too many people. Move everybody out while I get her attention.
FBI! Come on, we need to clear everyone out.
let's go! Let's go. Liz Foley! I need you to stop right there.
ma'am, I need you to stay back.
you don't tell me what to do, I tell you what to do!
ma'am, I said stop now!
you need to listen to me. Stop right now!
I tell you
her family's been notified. They're gonna meet her at the hospital.
there's nothing they can do for her, huh? Comfort measures, but that's about it.
Thanks, officer.
we can't be far from where he's holding them hostage. She was on foot.
but in her state, how in God's name did she escape? Reid, where are we in relation to his hunting ground?
right in the middle of it. At your service, sir.
Garcia, we're trying to figure out what kind of building or property the unsub might be using.
what do you see in a 5-mile radius of our current position?
a lot of stuff. What am I looking for?
anything relatively isolated or industrial.
uh, it's mostly residential, single-family homes, apartment buildings, stuff like that.
what about abandoned properties?
not per se, but people don't usually give notice when they do that.
let me see if there's any condemned. No, nothing.
what about properties for sale?
let's see, 1, 2, 6 homes for sale. All of them occupied.
an apartment building for sale, also occupied.
it looks like the city is selling some land. What's there?
uh, hold yourself. It is a...
hello. It's an animal shelter, but it's shut down due to budget cuts.
that's could be it, Garcia. Send the address.
done and done. Please be careful.
where are you? I know you're in here.
I can hear you.
no...
I'm sick! I need to go to the bathroom!
please! Please? Let me go! Let me go.
I feel sick.
I really gotta go to the bathroom.
please! Please! I gotta go! I gotta go!
remember what I told you before.
Yes.
repeat it.
if I run or fight, I get the stick.
go ahead.
all right. S. W.A. T.'s still 5 minutes out.
all right, we can't wait. We'll go in in two groups.
we'll go in this door, you guys take the west door down the alley.
let's go.
lay back down.
what are you doing? I said lay down!
OK.
david Wade Cunningham, FBI!
JJ, you got him? Go!
wait, ok. Please help me, please, please.
we have the entire place is surrounded. You might as well come out.
nice tackle, kid.
Thanks. I've been working out a little bit.
Thanks, man.
pretty boy.
I hope they didn't mess up that face too bad. You know that's your best asset.
luckily just some superficial nicks and bruises. How are you doing?
I just got a couple burns, but I'll be all right. Found another body at the disposal site.
hunter Cunningham? Well, we're still awaiting DNA confirmation, but they're the skeletal remains of a 9-year-old boy, So... It's gotta be him.
you guys ready to get out of here?
Yes, please. I can't stand hospitals.
it's something about the lighting. Who's Rossi talking to?
the Foley family.
she slipped into a coma.
it won't be long now.
excuse me, agents?
um, the doctors, they said that I'm gonna be ok.
and I...
I just--I don't know how to thank you guys. No, there's no need.
just get better. Ok.
you think they'll really terminate us if we can't run fast enough?
probably something worse. They'll probably make us take another fit test.
I'd rather be terminated. I just hope the P. T. instructor isn't a jerk.
those jock guys are always such jerks. Yeah, total jerks.
that's probably him right now. Oh, look. He's totally walking like a jerk.
Yeah, it's a total jerk walk. Total jerk walk.
wait a minute.
wait, I think it's Morgan. Yeah. Oh, my God, it is.
why are you here? It looks like I'm your new P. T. instructor.
Watkins got sick, so today's your lucky day.
I'm your guy. Awesome. That's awesome.
guys, guys, come on. Seriously, you should have just said something.
this whole fit test thing is just a formality. I could've got the whole thing waived.
but since you didn't, you ready to do this?
Yeah, let's do this!
Happy-go-Luckys, where are you going?
to run the mile. No, no, no. You didn't hear?
the fit test is more than just a mile.
get your little butts back over here.
come on, let's go, all the way down, all the way up.
come on! My grandmama can do way better than that.
let's go! This is not your high-tech room.
on our toes, right on your toes. There you go, baby girl, that's sweet.
go, girl, you know it. Turn around, right back down.
Hey, hey, hey. What are we doin'? What's all this huffin' and puffin'?
come on, we still got a 2-mile run to go. Let's go!
two miles? It's supposed to be one mile. No, no, no. Not on my watch.
this whole fit test is altogether different. Now suck it up!
Oh, my God. Let's go!
all right, all right, all right. Enough is enough.
I guess I gotta let the cat out of the bag.
I kind of already had your fit test waived.
what? Yeah. Baby girl, think about it.
you're not even in the field.
and pretty Ricky, you already got enough case hours to qualify.
this was just a good time for me. I'm gonna kill him.
if I can manage to lift my arms, I'll hold him down. I'm regaining my strength.
I told you you should have said something. I said--hey--uh, hey
Oh, oh! I'll kill you!
friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil.
Baltasar Gracian.
I'm gonna kill you, too! I'm gonna kill you!
you like that?
Oh, God!
present DAY
maynard GROVE MENTAL INSTITUTION
how's she doing?
she's was little agitated this morning, but I gave her a sedative.
does she know I'm coming? Yes, but it's been a year.
I'm sure she doesn't want to go back over this.
how long will it take?
3, 4 hours, tops.
because I have to prep her for trial. I didn't think profilers did that.
profiling is only one-tenth of what we do.
we also assist the prosecution once we find the killers.
agent Morgan. Hi. Ellen. How are you?
good. Daria is really improving.
it's amazing. If all goes well, they say I can take her home after the trial.
let's just get through this first. This way.
Daria. You got a friend here.
remember agent Morgan? I'll leave you two alone.
thank you.
how you doing? How do you think?
I'm sure it's been hard.
look, can we just get this over with?
today we're going to talk about what your testimony will be.
and I'm going to tell you how our investigation has progressed to prepare you for your cross-examination, all right?
all right, let's talk about the weekend that you escaped.
what do you remember?
I remember Ben.
when was the last time that you saw him?
I was over by the window when they took Ben out.
so you knew that they were gonna hurt him.
Carrie and I waited by the door for Ben, but when they came back, he wasn't with them.
do you know what happened to him?
Yes, I do.
straighten it out. Straighten it out. Hold it steady. Relax your arms.
you're holding on a little too tight. You're doing it.
relax. Enjoy the ride.
this is a lucky man's work.
dad, what the hell?
what? What--oh, stop, stop, stop.
I knew it would be bad.
every time I think about it, I just want to kill myself. I should have done something to stop them.
no, Daria. There's nothing you could have done.
that was our job.
3 victims have been found in upstate New York in a town called Hamilton over the past 10 days.
all of the bodies were discovered in a sort of public place, the first on a dead-end street, the second in a desolate alley, and this is the last one-- in a field.
Dorothy, we're not in Kansas anymore.
although each victim was abducted from a neighboring city, they all have something in common.
Yikes.
28 puncture wounds to the chest in groups of 4.
looks like it was made by a 4-pronged hay fork or some other kind of farming equipment.
only the latest victim was displayed like that. The first two were unceremoniously dumped.
the display method and the disposal suggests the unsub's evolving.
he wanted them to be found. Perhaps it's some kind of warning.
it could be a deity symbol. In a Japanese book from the year 712 called "Kojiki,
the scarecrow is seen as a symbol of someone who knew everything in the world.
I'm more concerned with the M. O. Is this piqueristic or flat-out sadistic?
it could be a combo platter, with a side order of psycho.
his pace and determination mean he's going to kill again soon.
let's go to New York. Wheels up in 30.
after they dumped Ben, how were they acting? They were drinking.
they always drank after they got rid of a body.
how many bodies were there?
I don't know. I stopped counting.
what did they do with you and Carrie after that? They put us in the shed.
that's when Carrie had the idea.
we gotta run.
are you crazy? They're probably passed out by now.
no. They're still up. Then we wait until they go to bed.
look...
I got this earlier. Carrie...
as soon as I get the door open, we have got to make a run for it.
Daria, Joe is evil. If we don't do this now, they're gonna kill us.
you know this.
we waited two hours, until we thought it was safe.
they must have heard a noise. That didn't stop us, though.
we ran and ran. Looky here.
we got runners.
Oh, no!
no, don't leave me! Don't leave me!
I'm sorry! Daria!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
no one is ever a victim, "although your conquerors would have you believe in your own victimhood.
how else could they conquer you?
Barbara Marciniak.
how far did you run?
I don't know. I just kept going.
then I got to the edge of the road.
do you have a girlfriend?
Yes, I do.
I used to have a boyfriend.
I miss him. Daria?
when you ran, weren't you afraid they might find you?
Yeah. But I was hoping someone else would find me first.
where were you? We were on our way.
these 3 victims vary in age and were last seen in various public locations on different days.
our unsub clearly employs an abduction method that works with both men and women.
the female victims had signs of sexual assault while the male did not. That means the rapes are situational.
he also knew where to stab the victims without killing them right away.
Piquerism is usually sexual in nature, and it's not often found in mixed gender victimology.
he's probably a sadist who's getting immense pleasure from his victims' suffering.
guys, I just found out that the second victim, Chloe Reynolds, she's Muslim.
the first victim, Marlene, is black.
maybe the most recent killing is a hate crime similar to Matthew Shepard.
Garcia, do we know Ben's sexual orientation? I'll start digging.
so after you escaped and started running, what were you thinking?
I wanted to go back for Carrie. I couldn't do that.
why not? What did you think was happening?
I knew she'd be punished for what we did.
you were gonna run?! Huh? Please!
he'd blame her for the escape.
please...
I--I told her not to.
Aah! No you didn't.
this was your idea. No, it wasn't.
all your idea! When Joe got mad, was he always out of control?
what did he do to you? I need the details, Daria.
he'd punch us so hard, we couldn't see for a week.
he'd tie us to the radiator.
God, I hated that radiator.
help me! Help me!
so you knew there was no way you could go back to help Carrie.
how could I? You saw what they did to Ben.
they would have done that to me.
so this is where Ben was hung.
I don't see any blood. Crime scene's incredibly neat.
the scarecrow looks like it was gently placed. It's quite a distance from the road, too.
there aren't any tire tracks to suggest he drove a vehicle out here.
how much do you think Ben weighed? A buck 75, maybe.
OK, so, our unsub parks his vehicle, carries a mutilated guy who's practically dead weight through a field, strings him up like a scarecrow, alone, and no one sees anything.
I'm not buying. You think he had help.
he couldn't have done it alone. He must've had a partner.
please Keep Out
hey there, Joe, you got everything you need? Could be snow, ice.
I got ropes, chains, ammonia to clean up, and ice picks.
you and your ice picks. You sure you don't want me to come?
you always take care of this stuff. I got this one.
you need me, I'll meet you up there in a couple days.
you're going on a road trip, Carrie.
were the markings similar on everyone?
2-millimeter holes, almost 1. 27 centimeters apart.
there are microscopic differences in the distances between the wounds.
this one's one millimeter shorter.
this is not the work of a hay fork or a farming implement.
the holes are too small. I think it's most likely an ice pick.
so the killers carefully jab the ice pick into the skin to set the pattern.
exactly. Then they replicated it on the other victims.
the unsubs would have had to stand over the body during the torture.
it's actually quite masterful. Whoever did this was extremely controlled.
add that to the neatness of the crime scene and I think we're looking for someone with OCD.
the precision is astounding. You guys were right.
Joe was messy. He made his friend keep things neat.
can you give me an example?
the table was always scrubbed.
the ice picks were scrubbed, too.
every drop of blood was cleaned from the floor.
every day they would tell us how they would kill us.
...chop his head off.
they had sick minds.
no.
we could try.
we could. Slice 'em up, scatter them around town.
no.
I want to do something freaky. You know?
really make a statement. Sick, hateful minds.
that's probably why we originally thought this was a hate crime.
I just talked to Ben's sister, and according to her, he wasn't gay.
we're not looking at another Matthew Shepard situation.
and the second victim's parents said that she was not a practicing Muslim.
Garcia, have you found any connection at all between the victims?
they have about as much in common as dinosaurs and goldfish.
the cracker kind. Then they might be victims of opportunity.
found another vic. She was badly abused.
where did they find the body? Oh, she's not dead.
she got hit by a car last night. She's been in the E. R.
a cop that had heard about the chest wounds and made the connection.
call you back, Garcia.
bp's 80 over 30. Give me two large-bore IVs, wide open.
I'm agent Jareau. What is your name? Please, help us.
us? Are there other girls? They're coming after us.
find Carrie.
Carrie. Who's Carrie?
who's Carrie?
we're losing blood. Sorry, guys.
give me etomidate. Let's move back to surgery.
there's another girl. And she said "they.
which confirms we were right about a team.
with one girl escaping, Carrie's probably in extreme danger.
or the unsubs are panicking and they're looking for someone else.
Joe liked bars. That's usually where he'd find girls.
where would he find guys? Anywhere he could.
but he had a way with women.
he'd charm us.
tell us we were smart, pretty, funny.
well, it was really fun talking to you.
where you goin'? Car's in the shop. I'm walkin' it.
you want a ride?
OK. Ok.
I'm the devil...
then when we woke up, we wouldn't know what had happened.
do you remember what happened the day we found you?
I remember doctors, nurses, nothing else.
our Jane Doe is stable.
she suffered severe trauma from the car accident as well as the torture.
there are also signs of long-term sexual assault.
and wounds on her wrists that have healed. So she'd been held for a while.
Yes. And she's experiencing retrograde amnesia.
she only remembers snippets about her past. Is this from the accident or the abuse?
probably a combination of both.
time may restore memory. Questions can jog it.
it's important that we talk to her. You can try.
all right. I'll head back in.
do you remember what happened when we came in that hospital room to talk to you again?
Nope. I just remember I was upset.
he hit me again! Carrie!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ok?
I promise I'll come back for you. I'm gonna send somebody!
I left you, but they're gonna find you! Carrie!
we just want to ask you a few questions, ok? Aah! Don't touch me!
we're not here to hurt you. It's ok.
look at me. Look at me.
you are ok.
listen, in order for us to help you or Carrie, we need to ask you some questions.
do you remember your name? Just find Carrie.
we will. We will. But right now we need to help you.
you want that, don't you?
we've got to get her picture out.
I'm just afraid no one's going to recognize her, she's so beat up.
we'll improvise. I'll call local P. D. And get a forensic artist.
do you think one of the unsubs is a woman? She freaked out on me, not you.
that didn't happen when she first met you.
but with improving memory, you may have reminded her of Carrie.
Yeah, she did look like Carrie. Same hair, same smile.
you know, they could have picked anyone, but they picked me.
I was going to be a doctor. Help people.
now I got doctors poking at me all day.
why did they go from dumping their victims to displaying them?
I don't know.
do you think it's because they wanted the public to see their work?
why are you asking me that? Because of how we found our next victim.
she was discovered hanging in a rest stop bathroom.
do we know her name? Still checking, but our unsubs are getting bolder.
their disposal sites have gone from remote and rural to high-traffic areas.
same signature, but the puncture wounds are bigger than the other ones, and they aren't the same distance apart. I think they used a different ice pick.
the wounds look deeper and more forceful, too.
they're continuing to display the bodies, which means they want everyone to see their handiwork.
yet the OCD's not present in the wound patterns or at the crime scene.
maybe they're losing control and devolving.
or they know we have Jane Doe and now their rage is already out of control.
there are also indicators of sexual assault. Let's get that photo to Morgan and JJ at the hospital.
this could be the Carrie that the Jane Doe's been going on about.
and that's when I showed you a picture of this woman. I've never met this woman.
that's not Carrie.
I know. But that's why we had to get our profile out fast.
we believe we're looking for a pair of sadistic killers who are trying to terrorize the community by torturing and displaying their victims.
one of the partners is dominant and fulfilling an emotional need.
the other is submissive and displays obsessive-compulsive tendencies.
we believe the stabbing in the chest is symbolic of unfulfilled sexual desire.
their M. O. is deteriorating, and this is evidenced by the fact that for the first time a victim successfully escaped.
so they're improvising now, breaking their own rules and becoming even more reckless.
this could cause a rift in the partnership, and it may result in changes or escalation to the torturous behavior.
now, we do have one hospitalized victim, but her abuse and length of captivity, along with the injuries sustained in the car accident, have left her in a dissociative state.
at this point, we believe she was held for at least 10 months, which is much longer than any of the other victims.
this means that she held a very special place in the dominant unsub's fantasies.
losing her will only increase his anger.
that's why he feels compelled to display his victims in a more public way.
he wants others to feel the full force of his outrage.
also, since another victim was found within the last two hours, we believe the kills are accelerating.
Oh. You liked him, huh?
huh?! Huh? Yes!
No! No! Watch.
watch! No, please!
I could have stopped them. I could have stopped this.
you did, Daria.
getting your I. D. led to a break in the case. Don't you remember that?
no. No.
Yes. Finding out who you were opened everything up.
this is the area where the bodies are being dropped. It's basically a 10-mile radius.
but the hunting zone extends another 20 miles. Probably lives somewhere in there.
the police captain just called from Brooklyn. Says she recognized our Jane Doe.
her name is Daria Samsen. They're sending a relative now.
what's their relationship? It's her sister. She's on the next train up.
about a year ago, Daria was a med student at Cornell.
she went to work one day and just vanished. We looked everywhere.
put up flyers, billboards. I thought she was murdered.
when was the last time you saw her?
the day she went missing.
I dropped her off at work. She had a part-time job at a diner.
she would...she would hook me up with coffee. Do you remember anything strange about that day?
what was the weather like?
it was cold. It was very cold.
when we headed to the door, we walked by a truck.
was there anyone inside of it?
there was this guy. A white guy.
did he say anything? He just looked at Daria and he said...
you're about as pretty as a stack of new 100s.
what did he look like? He was built. Good-looking.
probably mid-30s. Did your sister say anything to him?
she smiled back at him. He told her he was waiting for his mom who was in...
my mother's in physical therapy across the street. Physical therapy across the street.
was there anything identifiable on the truck? Bumper stickers. Decals.
uh, it was-- it was blue. Kind of dingy.
is that all you can see? Think back.
I can see part of his license plate.
but I hear a dispatcher. What is the dispatcher saying?
we got a broken furnace at Ridley and West.
there was a broken furnace. Yes.
Yes. There's a Joe Bachner of Conway Electric.
pulling up his records now.
Booyah, this is our guy. What's his background?
he is a member of the upright citizens brigade, she says with biting sarcasm.
in and out of jail, for battery, 15 years ago.
once accused of kidnapping a woman, but then she dropped the charges.
we were pretty sure that Joe was one of our guys, but we just needed you to I. D. him to be sure.
Hey, it's me.
listen, I need to show you another picture.
do you know who this is?
Daria, do you know this man? Get...
get him away from me.
get him away from me.
Daria... Daria, honey.
honey, I'm here.
you I. D.ing Joe helped us get his address and led us straight to his place.
yeah... But you got the story wrong.
how? That's exactly what you told me a year ago, Daria.
Yeah, but I remember more now.
Joe didn't abduct me in front of the diner.
I got into his truck willingly.
what are you saying? He seemed nice.
after work, Joe took me out for dinner.
the next thing I knew, I woke up...
in the shed and I was all--all tied up.
Joe used a ruse. He did that with everyone.
did they all fall in love with him?
no?
that's what I thought.
I liked being there.
I let him touch me and then I wouldn't get beat.
I kissed him.
I liked it.
it's my fault!
this is all my fault.
Daria just told me that she got into the car with Joe voluntarily.
that's all right. She'll still be a sympathetic witness. She said she fell in love with him, Hotch.
we'll explain that it's Stockholm syndrome, but I need to know if there are any more surprises.
all right, I'm about to go back in there. I just wanted to give her a break.
it's critical that we get all the details of her testimony. I know.
all right.
let's get back to where we were.
once we got Joe's I. D. we headed to the house.
Blake and Reid.
we went out to that house and we searched the place and it was empty.
clear!
clear! Clear!
and after we dug deeper into Joe's background, we still couldn't figure out who his partner was.
nothing out back. He's burned papers, clothes.
the shed's been completely ammonia'd down.
checked the basement. Clean as a whistle.
well, if he's not here, maybe he's with the partner.
Garcia, where else has Joe worked besides Conway Electric?
he's had random construction jobs over the last two years. And what do we know about his background?
raised in Pennsylvania. His parents died in a car accident.
Where'd he go after that? His juvie records are sealed with crazy glue.
but it looks like he was sent away to live with his alcoholic nurse aunt, who makes Mommy Dearest look like a Saint.
according to reports, she locked him in a shed, didn't feed him for days, siccing bees on him when she was mad.
get away!
please! Stop it!
that's how social services found him when he got to school.
hundreds of beestings on his chest.
so those torture wounds copied the stings.
it also explains the display method of his last two victims.
he wants to show the world the horrors of what he was forced to endure as a child.
and Daria was a medical student.
so we were right. She's a surrogate for Joe's aunt.
Where's the aunt now? Uh, she died February 2012.
a month before Daria was abducted. So the aunt's death was the trigger.
any known associates? We need to find the partner.
looks like he hangs out with local biker dudes and former cellmates.
compile a list. We'll run this by Daria at the hospital.
Yes. Yes. Bad people make bad people. Bye.
you said there was another man with Joe.
do you remember that? I'm not sure.
all right. You were hesitant back then, too.
Daria, this is important. Who else was in that shed?
no. No! No!
no, let me go!
no, please! Please!
hurry up, Coby!
we don't have all day.
his name's Coby.
Oh, God. It's ok, honey.
you're ok. I don't want to do this anymore.
I know. It was Coby.
I know. Shh.
I cross-checked the name Coby with the guys in the biker gang.
I'm coming up empty there.
try men released from prison with whom he might have done time.
OK...
Bada-bing bada-boom, the floodgates are opening.
there's a Coby Peters. He was released a year before Joe.
he lives about 3 miles away. He's a part-time electrician, full-time alcoholic.
that's our guy. Let's go. Thanks, Garcia.
clear! Clear!
look. He took all his guns. Look at this place.
this guy's the one with OCD. Go ahead, Garcia.
sir, I got a ping off Coby Peters' credit card.
he's around the corner at Mike & Sons.
Coby Peters, FBI!
don't move!
let's talk about Coby. Tell me about him.
he was evil.
you must have seen how mean Coby was.
he wasn't what we expected. I didn't kill anyone.
we have 4 bodies, Coby. You're part of a team.
what team? I'm an electrician.
who used to be a medical tech.
is that how you learned to torture like this?
what the hell is this? I thought you brought me in here for the guns.
we don't care about the guns. What about Daria?
you know her?
we're getting warmer, aren't we? Looks familiar, doesn't she?
except you didn't kill this one, because she's laying up in a hospital room with torture wounds all over her body.
that's my friend's girl. Who's your friend?
Joe Bachner. She come around when we were playing poker.
what happened to her? You tell us.
how should I know? What's your relationship with your friend?
he's my drinking buddy, and he works for me from time to time.
when was the last time you saw him?
I went to his house to give him the keys to my client's cabin.
water heater broke. He said he'd fix it.
how was he acting? Fine. He was packing up his car.
did he have anyone with him? Just some equipment and...
ice picks.
look, if Joe hurt these people, go talk to him.
he's still up at my client's cabin.
observation ROOM
he seems forthcoming.
it could be the behavior of an innocent or a psychopath.
you know, I know his house was clean, but did you see his shirt and shoes?
they were messy. There's no way this guy is OCD.
I find it interesting that Daria never asked Coby for help.
she was there when they played poker.
maybe she couldn't because she was still under Joe's control.
we searched Coby's home. Nothing connected to the crime.
let's head up to that cabin.
you kids ready to have some more fun?
huh? Huh? Please don't. No!
come on, just let us go.
let you go. Let you go?!
you think I brought you all the way up here just to let you go?
Joe Bachner, FBI!
we need medics.
you can't outrun a bullet, Joe!
tell us where your partner is, Joe. Who is he?
that's why I came back to the hospital to talk to you, because we were trying to find out who Joe's partner was.
your sister didn't want us to bother you again, but she knew we were desperate.
we're looking for a team and we have to find both of them.
they could have more girls right now. Every minute counts.
do you remember what you said?
Yeah. It's coming back.
it was Coby. Are you sure, Daria?
Yeah, it was him. I need you to think back.
we were in the shed. He had an ice pick.
OK. Ok. And what was he doing with it?
Joe and Coby were about to hurt Ben.
and you're sure it was Coby? Look at his face again.
it's too blurry. I can't see. Keep looking, Daria.
Yeah, it was Coby. I'm telling you.
he, uh, started poking holes in Ben.
he put the ice pick in a box.
where did they put this box?
on a shelf.
in the house.
Blake? Yeah, what's up?
I think I figured it out. Check every shelf in that house for a wooden box.
what's in the box? The answer to this case.
so I had Blake search that house for that ice pick in a box, and then I presented that box to you.
is that coming back to you?
Yeah. Yeah.
is that it?
Yes, it is.
we found it in Joe's bedroom. Was the ice pick in there?
Yes, Daria.
along with some of your things.
the reason Joe hung on to Carrie is because after you escaped, he needed another partner.
what? What are you talking about?
often when someone's held captive, they're forced to do the unthinkable.
your prints were found on that ice pick, Daria.
I wasn't Coby who put the holes in those victims. It was you.
what? You're--you're wrong. No, I'm not.
agent Morgan-- Ellen, just listen. these are facts.
Daria, you're the one with OCD.
you're the one who kept that place clean.
Joe forced you to participate.
and he made you clean up after his crimes.
it's how he controlled you, Daria.
and to deal with the pain, your mind had just snapped.
it let you think that it was someone else who was participating-- his friend Coby.
it's not true. It's not true.
I'm sorry, but it is. No.
it is. He made you do it.
do it now!
no.
do it or I'll kill her!
go on!
No! Daria, it's not your fault.
do you hear me? It's not your fault.
you had no choice. No! No!
it's not your fault.
Daria, baby...
No! No!
I loved him. That's why I did those things.
after a while, he didn't even have to ask me to do it.
I just...I just did it.
wait a minute.
did you torture people on your own?
that's what he wanted.
he loved me.
he kept me for a whole year.
the other ones he just had for a few weeks.
Daria, would you hurt someone again if Joe asked you to?
if he wanted.
he's my boyfriend.
I loved him.
I still love him.
excuse me, but it's time for Daria to take her medicine.
OK.
we're done.
I'm gonna step outside and speak with your sister.
how did it go?
unfortunately, there is no way that the government can call your sister as a witness.
wait, what?
that was the deal. If she doesn't testify, she goes to jail.
Daria admitted to me that at some point she became a willing participant in the murders, and she said she would do it again. I don't believe that.
your sister is mentally incapacitated, and I am protecting her by not letting her take that stand.
but then they will keep her in here forever. My sister is not crazy.
Ellen, I know you see flashes of the Daria that you remember, the strong woman, the woman who escaped, and the woman who wants to get better, but your sister is permanently damaged because of what he did to her.
this is where she needs to be.
I am truly sorry.
she just wanted to say good-bye.
it's time for therapy now. So, that's it?
was I helpful?
Yes, you were.
I have everything that I need.
you take care, Daria.
Hey. Do you think you'll ever catch Joe's partner?
I'm not sure.
but we're still looking.
well, good luck.
good-bye, Daria.
there are times when the mind is dealt such a blow, "it hides itself in insanity.
there are times when reality is nothing but pain.
and to escape that pain, the mind must leave reality behind.
Patrick Rothfuss.
this is such bull.
he's the one who ought to be arrested, not me.
I thought you girls were paid up front before the lap dance.
this guy looked good for it. - So he got his lap dance
Yeah, two of them. Good ones.
and then he paid you with postage stamps.
he said, "it's the same as money.
Really? Try paying rent with that.
that still doesn't mean you can kick a man in his private parts, Candy. That's assault.
Hey! Watch it!
you want to go? - I got an emergency. I got an emergency.
listen. Listen.
look, you gotta help me. Somebody's trying to kill me.
yeah? Who's trying to kill you?
OK. Hey
I got this.
there. Look at that.
right there.
look at it. See that?
you have less than a day to live. There is no way to prevent the inevitable.
I found that in my mailbox out of the blue. I'm not crazy.
how much have you had to drink tonight, sir? I can smell alcohol.
what are you talking about? It's not important.
look, um...I'm sorry. Just...
can I stay here, uh, tonight, just until the morning?
this isn't a motel.
just go back home, calm down, try to get some sleep.
mission accomplished, pal. You're in for the night.
heard some whacked-out helped empty the garbage last night.
you heard right. Word is this guy wanted to be arrested?
Yeah, now he's gotta go see the judge.
would've been cheaper if he'd just gone to a motel.
let's go. Rise and shine.
damn it!
get an ambulance!
as my dear mother used to say, a penny for your thoughts.
Jack asked me to speak to his class about being an FBI agent.
they're having career day. Sounds like fun.
come on. Every day you strap on the six-shooter and go after the bad guys. The kids'll love it.
Oh, I know. And I'm glad he asked.
it just, I'm a little worried about it because I don't want it to end up being difficult for him.
because of what happened to Hailey.
one of the bad guys killed his mom.
and he's doing fine. And we talk about it some, but I just don't want this to end up...hurting him.
you're a good dad, Aaron.
and I know you're doing everything you can to help him.
and I also know you'll make the right decision about this, whatever it is.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm interrupting. But we're ready.
thank you.
Wayne Campbell, 38 years old, found dying yesterday morning in his holding cell in Long Beach, California.
he claimed someone was trying to kill him, so he purposely got himself arrested to be protected.
a strategy that didn't work out so great.
what is the C. O.D? Arsenic poisoning.
Ah, an oldie but a goodie.
and you're tuned to the station where the hits keep coming.
when news spread of Campbell's death, an officer in a nearby precinct remembered Helen Mitchell.
6 days earlier, she showed up with this letter she had found in her mailbox a few days before.
was it investigated?
they started a file, but Helen wasn't especially concerned.
and in light of Campbell's death, they exhumed Helen Mitchell's body, and lethal amounts of arsenic were found in her system as well.
handwritten letters, poisoning by arsenic-- we could be looking at a female unsub.
who wants her victims to have foreknowledge of their deaths.
that's a new one.
actually, we've seen a version of this M. O. before.
6 years ago in Dallas, Max Pool warned his victims by putting their faces on missing posters before killing them.
in any event, there may be notes out there that we don't know about.
we've got a long flight. Let's get going.
you can exchange the muffler for equal or greater value.
come on. Can't I exchange it for something cheaper?
my car's got like 200, 000 miles on it.
Yeah, go ahead.
what's so important, man?
I'm on my way to pick up Izzy for school.
wait. You think I did this?
it was under my door when I came in to work this morning.
a death threat? I look like a psycho to you?
this conversation's done.
Hey, man, you ok?
Yeah. Yeah.
look, maybe we had a fight the other day, but you and me, we go back a long time.
close up and go home, huh? Take an aspirin.
quit accusing people of stuff.
Hello? Uh, anybody back here?
I found the muffler I want.
a proverb states, "he that is born to be hanged shall never be drowned.
Helen Mitchell was the socially prominent widow of an investment banker, philanthropist, patroness of the arts.
Wayne Campbell, on the other hand, was as blue collar as they come.
worked for a tree-trimming and removal company.
Garcia, was the M. E. able to estimate when Campbell might have ingested the arsenic.
somewhere between 6: 00 and 10 p. m. last evening.
do we know where Campbell was during those hours?
same place he is every Tuesday night while his wife plays bridge.
Erish grill. It's a neighborhood sports bar.
this isn't widely known, but Helen Mitchell had a drinking problem, and Wayne Campbell abused painkillers.
that could be the common thread, and unsub's punishing them for their vices?
poisoning those who poison themselves? The syntax of the note is interesting.
instead of a simple "stop it," you get "prevent the inevitable.
and in block lettering to disguise the handwriting.
Oh, no. Make room in your files, they're about to get thicker.
a third victim was just reported half an hour ago.
Carlos Ortega. Exact same note left on his body.
also poisoned? - Yeah, it looks that way.
well, this is weird.
there was a piece of twine on his chest.
no twine was reported on or near the first two victims.
less than a day between kills this time. He's accelerating.
Morgan, see who Helen Mitchell had contact with in the 24 hours before she died.
Dave, you and Blake check out the Carlos Ortega crime scene.
JJ and Reid to the sports bar, and I'll coordinate with local law enforcement.
are you the responding officer?
Yes, sir. Delivery driver discovered the body.
blood, vomit, evidence of hyper-salivation.
smelled garlic on the victim. Maybe somebody spiked his food?
garlic odor in the breath and body tissue is a common indicator of arsenic poisoning.
Yeah, I wonder how the unsub got him to ingest it.
is that the twine found on his chest? That's correct.
laid out real precise, in a straight line, pointing head to toe.
detective Tavez. SSA Hotchner.
glad you're here.
we have our share of homicides, but this is something new.
did you check with other precincts for similar cases?
Yes. Nothing so far.
thank you very much. Hey, Hotch.
Helen Mitchell's personal secretary.
she claims that Helen was home alone the day of her death.
the only thing out of the ordinary was a small box of chocolates delivered to the house.
do we know who sent them?
supposedly a local charity to thank her for hosting a fund-raiser.
except the charity claims they know nothing about it.
any chocolates missing from the box? - 3.
Campbell's personal belongings you asked for. Thank you.
do you remember what Mr. Campbell ate the night before last?
his usual. Chili dog, onion rings. Cast-iron stomach, that guy.
did he talk to anyone? Just the guy sitting next to him.
was this other guy also a regular?
no. I hadn't seen him before.
he kept buying Wayne drinks, though.
can you describe him? White guy, heavy-set, maybe 40 years old.
wore a hat, average-looking.
do you think you'd recognize him if you saw him again?
Yeah, I think so. Ok, well, thank you for your help.
we may be contacting you again. Anything I can do to help.
look, Wayne seemed a little preoccupied that night, but he was a good guy.
the unsub may have spiked his drink.
it wouldn't have been hard to do.
a busy bar, lots of noise and distraction. Get another double vodka.
he kept plying Campbell with booze to get him drunk.
I'm gonna go to the head. I appreciate it.
and since what goes in has to eventually come out, it'd be his way to ensure that he'd get up at some point to use the bathroom.
the victim left momentarily...
the unsub slipped in the arsenic...
and left the bar.
and when Campbell returned from the bathroom...
he took a drink.
he never had a clue.
Oh! Holy cow!
all right, Bill. Last chance, buddy.
you sure you want to leave all this splendor for some lousy island in the Mediterranean?
you know, Bill almost jumped the gun and went 20 years ago.
had his ticket bought for Greece and everything.
except, me and him went out and tied one on the night before, and Bill missed the shuttle van to the airport.
and I could never look a Mai Tai in the face again.
hurry it up, Wick. I don't like room temperature champagne.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But here's to your new life, Bill.
Yeah! Congratulations, bill.
just remember to keep an extra hammock strung up on the beach for your old buddy Wick, huh?
come on, speech. Come on.
speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...
um, I...
I was just thinking about how all of this was here before...
and then how it's all gonna be here after.
you know, 'cause...
when they're living like-- - You know, I think
I think Bill's given up on English already and is already talking Greek.
come on up, guys, get some cake.
same kind of twine found in Wayne Campbell's pocket.
a friend of the victim's, Benjie Ruiz, came by the shop around 9: 40
and saw a single customer milling around in the muffler section.
there was no surveillance camera, but a cash register receipt confirms somebody exchanged a muffler at 9: 36.
when Mr. Ruiz left 5 minutes later, the customer was still there.
at 9: 50, Carlos was found dead. No customer in sight.
do we have a description of him?
white male in his 40s, large build, and he wore a hat.
that's the same description the bartender gave to me and JJ.
it's gotta be our guy.
a green car was parked outside when Benjie Ruiz arrived and was still there when he left.
no make or model, but pretty old.
according to Mr. Ruiz, Carlos had no drug or alcohol issues.
he was a solid, hard-working family man.
well, that puts a dent in our theory of an unsub punishing people for their indiscretions.
unless Carlos had a vice we don't know about.
we just confirmed that the chocolates and the water cooler both tested positive for arsenic.
any twine found at Helen Mitchell's house? - A couple feet of it were tossed in the kitchen trash.
we're thinking the chocolates may have been wrapped in it.
guys, I did a geographic profile of the victims, and it turns out they all lived or worked in the same 2. 65 square-mile radius in the north part of the city.
well, that gives us his hunting ground, but not his victim selection criteria.
the bartender said the unsub may have struck up a conversation with Campbell there that night.
that's ballsy.
the same way he walked into Carlos' store to exchange the muffler.
and for some reason, he feels the need to interact with his victims in the hours before they die.
911. What's your emergency? It's not an emergency, really.
I just want to file a complaint against some kids in the neighborhood.
hold on, ma'am. I'm transferring you.
OK.
Uh-huh. These kids are how old?
and can you tell me the nature of the note? Can you read it to me?
ma'am, do not hang up. I'm getting someone from the FBI.
FBI? I don't need that. It's only some kids.
agent Rossi, we have another person with a note.
a Janice Cheswick.
ma'am, this is agent David Rossi.
are you alone in your house?
Yes. I mean, I-- I think so.
double check that all your doors and windows are secured.
stay calm, and do not hang up your phone.
my God.
everything is locked. Now what?
all right. Police have been dispatched to your home.
do not leave your house. I'm scared!
listen, Janice.
this is very important that you do not eat or drink anything.
I won't.
OK. Everything's gonna be ok.
help is on the way.
help! Janice!
we've got an APB out in the surrounding area for an older green car.
do we know how he got in? Garage door shows signs of forced entry.
probably spiked the wine. And when she called the police instead...
this time he used the twine to strangle her. Overkill.
the unsub was denied what he wanted most, the chance to engage with her before she died.
sharp knife, this level of frenzy.
hopefully this son of a bitch also did some damage to himself.
I'll notify local E. R.s to be on the lookout for hand lacerations.
you all right, Dave?
I told her she'd be ok, Aaron, that she'd be fine.
let's go find this guy.
Hey, kid. Our geo profile just go turned upside down.
our latest victims lives and works a good 10 miles from the unsub's hunting ground.
he's either branching out or we're missing something.
Hey, baby girl, I need you to work that magic of yours.
rub my lamp, release the genie. Our latest victim, Janice Cheswick
track her activities as far back as it takes to find a link between her and our other victims.
as far back as in days or weeks? Months, if necessary.
pushing it, Aladdin, but I'm a go. That's why I love you.
these pieces of twine are all different lengths. Are you just now figuring that out?
I think it's by design.
starting with the first victim, the lengths are 25, 15, 12, and 19 inches.
Yeah, so what? If you convert inches to centimeters, you'll have 64, 38, 31, and 48, the exact ages of all 4 victims.
I think I know what this is about.
the man we're looking for is a highly organized offender, but we don't yet know why or how he's choosing his victims.
these appear to be killings of opportunity, yet he's researched his targets as though they'd been selected carefully and with premeditation.
they run the gamut. Young and old, rich and poor, male and female.
but with all of them, he leaves behind a piece of twine.
why does he do that? What does the twine represent?
in Greek mythology, a person's destiny was in the hands of the 3 fates.
one to spin the thread of life, another to measure the thread, and finally atropos, the one who cut the thread with shears at the moment of death.
we think that's what the twine symbolizes.
he's decided the fate of his victims and then he observes them.
as if assuming the form of a mythological God himself.
we don't know what triggered the spree, but the unsub may have recently suffered a loss and is now lashing out.
if he can't control his own fate, he will control others.
this unsub is also quite meticulous.
he studies his victims in advance to the murders, follows them, learns their habits, even interacts with them.
his need to engage directly with his victims is a compulsion that overrides the risk of being caught.
this compulsion will likely be his downfall and lead to his eventual capture.
the time period between warning his victims and killing them is getting shorter with each murder.
he could be unraveling.
the public needs to be made aware that if they receive a note similar to the ones he's already sent, they need to contact 911 immediately. Thank you.
so sorry, my beautiful creatures, my DMV search yielded nuttin', but I did make progress on another front.
that Janice Cheswick, she lives clear across on the other side of town, right?
well, last week, at 4: 17 in the afternoon on the 23rd, to be precise, she charged a double soy latte at a coffee shop smack dab in the middle of the geo zone of the other 3 victims.
sending this now. It's next to the university.
the unsub may be a part of academia.
all right, Garcia, start with the schools of classics and humanities and work out from there.
check any students or faculty for red flags. A fighting bull like moi looks for nothing else.
I've got a sudden craving for a double soy latte.
let's take a ride.
do you recognize any of these people?
I don't. Sorry.
what's this about? We're investigating a series of murders, and we think the killer may have seen one or more of these victims at this coffee shop.
victims? You mean...
all these people got killed?
excuse me. Is that a pinhole camera?
you secretly videotape your employees?
not the employees, just the cash register area.
Yeah, well, I guess that means the employees. We've got a pilferage problem.
how long has this surveillance been going on?
Uh...5 weeks.
go to 4: 17 p. m. on the 23rd.
that's her.
that's all of them.
the unsub must be just out of camera range. This is the moment he selected all his victims.
it ties in with his idea of fate, that these 4 were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
let's bring in Benjie Ruiz and the bartender and see if they recognize anyone who came in that day as the man they saw.
there's another identification we need to make, and fast.
the next in line.
who is it? - It's me, Wick.
uh, ok, just a minute.
you forgot to turn in your keys.
Heh. Thought I'd swing by and get 'em, before you were on the other side of the world.
I haven't been here in a while. - Yeah.
Sheesh. I love what you've done with the place, though.
Thanks, man. Oh, wow, what did you do to your hand?
Oh, I cut it. Clumsy.
so what's the deal with you and Greece, anyway?
I don't know. Just always made sense to me.
Really?
this makes sense to you? - Yeah.
here.
Thanks.
well, man...
safe travels.
I should've gone.
20 years ago, I should have gone.
you were broke 20 years ago, Bill.
hell, I did you a favor that night.
a favor?
I...got you wasted on purpose.
come on.
you had to have figured that out by now.
like you were about to leave a primo job to go halfway across the world, with no money, no prospects.
then your mom got sick right after that, right?
well, if you'd have gone, you wouldn't have been here to look after her the way you did.
and now you're set, man. You got--you got your healthcare, you got your pension.
you worked hard for that.
you can go do Greece in style now. You've earned it.
how long have they been at it? 2 hours, 11 12 minutes.
Garcia's still combing through university records.
no luck.
the fifth customer paid in cash, so we can't track her.
but an enhanced VidCap of her is being distributed to everyone that worked at the coffee shop the last 6 months.
hopefully someone knows who she is.
at the coffee shop, a couple of guys came in wearing scrubs.
is there a hospital near campus?
Yeah, there's a medical center affiliated with the university.
what if that's why the killer was in the vicinity?
for the hospital, not the university.
we profiled the unsub may have experienced a loss.
what if someone he was close to died or was diagnosed with a serious illness?
except this doesn't feel like a guy who has close friends or a tight-knit family.
what if it's him?
the unsub himself got some bad news.
if they told him he had a terminal illness, it would explain the M. O.
you get thrown a curveball... You throw a curveball back.
do unto others what was done unto you.
let's get Garcia on it. Let's go, guys.
they couldn't identify any of the other customers as the man they saw at the auto shop or sports bar.
the killer is picking his victims in the moment, right? You, you, you, and you.
no advance planning. - That's how it looks.
yet he later stalks each one, learning their habits.
how does he manage to do that if they all scatter after they get their coffee?
parking lot.
he saw them through the window.
waited till they came out one by one and drove away.
took down their license plate numbers.
a little research at the DMV.
none of the coffee shop employees can identify the fifth woman in line.
detective, can you make the surveillance video go any faster?
it'll go any speed you want.
go back to the beginning. I need to watch all 5 weeks in the video.
but that's-- - 525 hours.
Yeah. We don't have time for that.
Reid, tell him what you did this morning for breakfast.
I read "War and Peace." Reread it, actually.
this time in the original Russian. Trust me, detective, there's enough time.
the university was a wash, but the med center may just pay off.
in the last 3 months, 485 patients were diagnosed with terminal illness.
34 of those were white males in their 40s.
8 of those have green cars over 15 years old.
like I said, I'm close. If there was only a way to research who wears hats.
did any of the 8 have reason to be at the hospital on April 23rd?
23rd...
Bingo! William Harding had an appointment with his oncologist, got the bad news.
an address, Garcia. Sending it now.
thank you.
how do you do that? By employing the same principles used in speed reading.
I minimize subvocalization of the images and reduce cognitive load by
wait, wait. Back up the feed.
there.
that's her.
can you push in on her name tag? - Yeah.
Hey. It's 12. 50.
hold on. Let me get my wallet.
there you go. Thank you very much.
Bye.
Bonnie Taylor isn't answering. ID this her home address?
Yeah, but today's her day off, so she's not at work.
detective, send squad cars to this address immediately. Right away.
so much for my diet.
and you're sure you've never seen this man?
uh...I'm positive.
this was in the mailbox outside.
Oh, my God. When was the last time you checked your mailbox?
uh, yesterday, I think. Wait, no, um, the day before.
I--I...
I skip sometimes.
excuse us. Ok.
they haven't found any arsenic yet. We must have gotten here first.
no, he had plenty of time. I don't think Bonnie's his target anymore.
the shift in the M. O. is too dramatic.
the time between leaving the note and the murders was contracting, not expanding, and he made no effort to interact with her.
he could be devolving. It's not a loss of focus, it's a shift in focus.
between the time that Harding left the note and now, a more important target's presented itself.
you must be a glutton for punishment. One day retired and you're back for more.
I thought we could have a drink. A drink.
Ah, I'm liking this new Bill Harding already.
what's the occasion?
I didn't realize until today how you'd gone out of your way for me 20 years ago.
Oh, Bill.
I thought I'd return the favor.
Skol.
Garcia, does Bill Harding have any family in the area? Parents deceased, no siblings.
what about his job? - Uh, worked the cargo bays in a shipyard.
yesterday was his last day, actually. - What type of cancer does he have?
mesothelioma. - Asbestos.
he got it working at the shipyard. His anger might be directed toward someone there.
send Morgan the work address. - Yes, sir.
file SENT
look at you, huh? Going off to live your dream.
and here I am.
I got the wife, kids, a two-damn-car garage.
probably be working on these docks for the rest of my life.
Cheers.
Oh, God, you know, if we ever run out of paint thinner around here, I know what to buy.
does he have any criminal history or mental health issues?
well, he's been on antidepressants most of his life.
but he's got a clean police record.
Oh, my. - What is it?
he was part of a massive police search and rescue when he was 6 years old.
when I was 6, before my folks moved here from Idaho, my best friend Randy and I got lost up in the mountains.
we were on a camping trip with... our parents.
it started snowing and got cold, so we decided to separate to try to find our way back and get help.
Randy never made it. I did.
when they found Randy, he was frozen.
I was in the hospital for a week.
damn, Bill.
why didn't you tell me this before?
people said it was my fault. We shouldn't have split up.
they think that's why Randy died. - Come on.
when I was in the hospital, my first-grade teacher came to visit me.
and she gave me this book.
a kids book on Greek mythology.
I opened it... And there it was.
there what was? - A picture of the Labyrinth.
it looked just like that forest that Randy and I got lost in.
but I escaped. Just like Theseus.
like Theseus.
you know, you're starting to talk a little crazy.
you know that, don't you? - Oh, it's not crazy.
it's fate.
I got out...
and he did not.
read this.
what, is this a joke? - Sorry.
not funny, Bill. - No.
I did more digging, Hotch, and I can tell you where he's gonna be a week from now
flight 906, seat 23A, LAX to Athens, Greece.
get this. Bill Harding also applied for an extended visa to Greece way back in 1994.
did he go?
negative. He reserved a spot with Higgins airport shuttle, didn't show up, plane left without him...
Oh, man, you are not gonna believe this.
I'm dying.
cancer.
the doctor says I have 3 to 6 months to live, but it doesn't matter, because most of me died when I missed that plane.
when I left the doctor's office,
I stopped at a coffee shop...
I couldn't get out.
because there were just all of these people all around, so happy, making plans. They were so damn sure that nothing bad was ever gonna happen to them.
it's fate.
some are chosen and some are not.
what are you gonna do, Bill? Are you gonna kill me with that thing?
no, not this. Poison.
FBI, don't move.
william Harding, you're under arrest for the murders of Helen Mitchell, Wayne Campbell,
Carlos Ortega, and Janice Cheswick.
drop the weapon--now.
I think he poisoned me. We'll get you to a hospital.
but right now you need to drop the weapon.
no. He took 20 years of my life from me.
you got that backwards.
that shuttle bus, it crashed on the way to the airport.
all 5 people were killed. You not getting in that van kept you alive.
now put it down.
a person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.
Jean de La Fontaine.
Thanks. Given any more thought to, um, career day?
Jack's third-grade class is descending on the BAU on Monday.
excellent. And is Jack happy about it?
ecstatic. He's very excited.
he's proud of you.
I know.
and I don't want to take that away from him.
the challenging part is coming up with a profiling presentation.
well, after 20 years of facing down killers, rapists, and psychopaths,
SSA Aaron Hotchner may have finally met his match.
I've observed each of you. I've interrogated you.
and none of you claims to have the stapler.
at first I thought it was you.
but then...
I profiled...
that it's really you.
what exactly did you profile? - Well, a few things.
first, Jesse, you wouldn't look at me in the eye.
but you were very fidgety with your hands.
and then when Ms. Garcia dropped her lucky quarter, all 3 of you noticed, but you didn't react at all.
you were too busy keeping a lie straight in your head.
well, this has been a very interesting demonstration, Mr. Hotchner.
thank you, Ms. Springer. Class, let's all give him a big thank-you.
thank you! You're welcome.
sir, may I show them my office?
Absolutely. Everybody go with Ms. Garcia.
come on, you guys. It's like the bat cave.
????
can I be a profiler when I grow up? Sure, honey.
if you get good grades and you work hard and you think you might be good at it, why not?
I'm good at it. Are you?
I did a profile on Ms. Springer. Me?
Yeah. You like Jack's dad.
I'm not sure-- when you talk about your cat, you talk real, real fast, because you really like your cat.
you talked real fast like that today, not like with the other dads.
thanks again, Mr. Hotchner. Thank you for the great time.
you're welcome.
probably had to go feed the cat.
so how did I do? It was cool.
it was cool. So what do you say we celebrate?
Yeah. Hot dogs or hamburgers?
both.
I'm a profiler. I should have seen that coming.
please...
please, I'll do-- I'll do whatever you want.
please, I won't tell anyone what you do.
please...
please let me go. I can
I can get--I can get home-- I can get home from here.
I'll do whatever you want.
dodge
please...
please...
no, please! No! No!
this again? You miss another flight to see James?
worse. He came here.
he's cooking and watching "House Hunters" without me.
you know, he'd better not try to make an offer again.
so, we get Henry to bed, and, you know, we're about to finally have some alone time with mommy and daddy, and...
you guys no the rest. Ah, trying to dust off the old cobwebs.
inappropriate. - What?
seriously, though, how long has it been? - Too long.
do we know what the case is?
not yet. Hotch just said to drop everything and get back here.
you you need some private adult time.
I'll watch Henry. No bad guys, no kids, in that order.
go to Mexico. Or the Maldives, maybe.
Yes! Exactly. A cruise would be perfect.
no, no, no. Matt Cruz.
let's get started. Thanks for taking this case, Aaron.
you guys are on quite a streak.
it had been so long since I'd heard from you, I wasn't sure if you were getting my reports.
I was putting out other fires in the Bureau. Domestic terrorism needs my full attention.
but when it comes to you guys, why mess with success?
how are those ribs?
it still hurts when I laugh. - You?
the scars impress the ladies.
I hope you don't mind, Ms. Garcia, if I took the liberty of having the much less talented version of you in my office load the case details.
Oh. Yeah. Sure, no problem.
a good friend of mine, sheriff Peter Coleman, down in Briscoe county, Texas, reached out to me about a possible case. He's a former Texas Ranger, he's a good guy.
he read about our work on the Silencer case two years ago.
he asked for a consult. - What do we have?
Abigail Jones. Prostitute.
she was found in a dumpster last night. - What's that on her wrists?
it's, uh... It's...
it's...
uh, would you mind?
thank you, Jesus, Buddha, and Allah.
I like to cover my bases. You have to squeeze it.
rope burns.
which goes hand in hand with lacerations on her back.
there's also a gunshot wound to the back of her head, execution style.
it's a conflict in M. O.
the cutting and restraining, point to a sexual sadism, but the gunshot wound ends the torture too quickly for a sadist.
is that the only victim?
there's Hannah Kelly, another prostitute, killed 6 months ago, dumped one jurisdiction over.
forensic countermeasure.
smart enough to separate the victims so we won't tie them together.
and practical, too. The body was left in hooker row, where they pick up their Johns, which brings us to our first victim, Lucas Wagner.
killed 11 months ago. Multiple arrests for soliciting a prostitute.
he was found outside of a crack house where some of them lived.
he takes a paying customer and drops them where the girls live.
that sends a message that nobody's safe.
tell sheriff Coleman we're on our way.
Texas
first they get Hannah and now they get Abigail? I don't want to go out tonight.
look, I'll come and look out for you. You'll be ok.
watching us get in a car isn't gonna help.
what if some man jams the doors and takes us out far and-- Wait, you think it's some serial killer?
honey, we ain't got serial killers around here.
Abigail did her own thing. You all know that.
who knows who she knew? - Well, I ain't goin' out there until this cools down.
no. No, mama's gotta eat, girl.
couldn't mama fast for one night?
are my ears hearing me right?
you want to tell that to the man upstairs, honey?
please, Dinah-- - let me tell you how this works.
you're gonna go out there and shake that moneymaker.
and if you come back here with less than 200...
it ain't the bogeyman you'll have to be worried about.
you hear me, Sugar?
you're working the day shift, too. Chop-chop.
Hi, Ben.
you ok, Tabitha? Why won't whoever's doing this just kill her?
don't say that, Tab. We'll be all right.
we always are.
did she pull your hair?
the name written on her forehead was a mystery:
Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.'
revelation 17: 5.
ballistics matched one gun to all 3 shootings.
so, the same unsub killed one John and two prostitutes.
at least he keeps it in the family.
maybe the John's a friend of the unsub, someone he picked up prostitutes with.
well, once he kills his friend, it makes it easier to kill the prostitutes.
that would explain why there's no sexual assault on the victims.
it's not about rape for this unsub, it's about torture.
I mean, that fits, kind of, but it just feels like we're missing something.
what we're missing is whether this guy's a sadist or not.
a gunshot to the back of the head throws everything off.
we're presuming he's using the gun to end things, but it could be part of the psychological torture.
I'm gonna cut you, and if you flinch, bang. Ok, so let's go with that for a second.
there were 5 cuts on Lucas Wagner, 9 on Hannah, 12 on Abigail.
he's escalating his torture. Sadists definitely do that.
and they get deeper with each victim.
that's right. The first cuts were experimental in nature, and the latter ones were about maximum infliction of pain.
what if this is vigilantism?
he's punishing these women and their johns to clean up the streets.
but why take so long to do it? 3 victims in 11 months?
that's a substantial cooling-off period.
Morgan, you and Reid talk to anyone working the streets last night and see if they saw something useful.
Dave and Blake, go to the coroner's office, see what you can learn there, and JJ and I will go to the station with the sheriff and start interviewing friends and family.
sheriff
how do you know Matt Cruz, Sheriff?
he and I worked a few cases when he was working out of the Dallas field office.
so which serial killers that you guys caught was the scariest? - Vicky.
it's ok. Cases involving kids are the toughest.
Oh. Oh, sure. Of course.
where would you like us to set up?
right here. And we got the boards right over here.
Oh, that's--that's full. Well, the whole force wanted to work on it.
we've had bad people down here, but we've never seen anything like this.
but we'll be following your lead on this one. You have our best men, agent Hotchner.
how can we help? Have any of the family members come in yet?
uh, Carrie Lawson, Abigail's sister. I told her to come at noon, but she got here at 8: 00.
hasn't budged for hours. Not even to go to the bathroom.
I'll talk to her.
Oh, can I sit in? I won't say a word.
um, you know, it might be more comfortable for her if it's just one on one.
let me show you to the interview room.
she's enthusiastic. But she means well.
they all do. Of course.
I've only been sheriff here a year, but it's the bigest case we've ever had.
let's get to work. - You bet.
not too many spots for working girls to go to, so this'll be your best shot.
and you turn a blind eye to what goes on in here? Agent, we only got one bar around here.
monday night's karaoke, Tuesday's line dancing, and the girls are discreet.
can't hardly tell the professionals from the locals who just want to get their drink on.
not to mention, we shut this place down, then what? The devil you know kind of thing.
exactly.
deputy. - Dinah, these two are agents from the FBI.
you mind answering some questions? - Don't know much, but sure.
we're trying to find out more about a woman named Abigail Jones.
did you know her? Why you all asking about Abby?
when was the last time you saw her?
last week. Same bat time, same bat station.
she's all right, ain't she? - No. She was killed a couple of nights ago.
killed? - God almighty.
how well did you know her? Used to flirt.
you know. She always said I couldn't handle her.
she was right.
so I'd buy her drinks. She liked when I buy her drinks.
was she that kind of girl? Party girl, maybe?
it was hard to tell when she was loaded or not.
I mean, she was always off.
like she had her own song goin' on in her head.
Mack the Knife.
let me ask you, did Abigail come in often? Was she a regular customer?
what was that?
Mack the Knife.
was that the song in her head?
no. It was the name of her last...date.
you know what I mean? - Yes, I do.
have you ever met this Mack the Knife?
no.
she told me about him, said he was a good tipper.
do you know where we could talk to him?
would you prefer to chat privately?
I can't.
OK.
why don't we just have a little chat, right here. You don't have to look at me.
don't move your head. Just keep looking down.
just doing my best to be charming, if you don't mind.
could you lean over and take this card from me?
see? I'm not so bad.
come on, we're just talkin' it up, havin' some fun, right?
why don't you flash me that pretty little smile of yours.
and then maybe slap me on the shoulder like maybe I'm trying to get fresh or something, huh?
no? Yeah? Yeah.
dirty boy. You wish.
all right, well, you can't blame a guy for trying. Nice to meet you.
one last question.
do either of these two people look familiar to you?
the boy looks familiar.
the girl I never seen. - Well, thank you for your time.
would you mind if we came back a little later?
Oh, anytime. Got nothin' to hide.
Thanks.
sorry I couldn't help you none.
you told the police you spoke to Abby the night before she died.
she called out of the blue, so I knew something was up.
you two didn't talk regularly? - We had...
different lives.
I went to church, married the guy I went to prom with, had a kid.
and she...
did what she did.
and what did she call about two nights ago?
it was hard to follow her. She was high.
and when she got high, she got paranoid. - About what?
cameras in the light sockets, black helicopters following her.
those are common drug-induced delusions.
I know. But...
she did something different on the last call.
she apologized.
for what? - Everything.
every mistake she ever made, every sleepless night that she put my parents through.
and she said she had to say these things because this was her last...
this was her last chance to set things right, because they were comin' to get her.
we got one of the names of her clients, Mack the Knife.
considering everything that happened to her, - did she mention-- - no.
it wasn't "he's" coming to get me, it's "they" were coming to get me.
could we be looking at a team doing this? - The signature of the cutting is too specific.
and nothing about the crime scene indicates a partner.
there is a fear plaguing this community, seeping into their souls, making them meek.
well, aren't the meek inheriting the earth, preacher? Yes, but not until their time.
agent Jareau, SSA Hotchner, I'd like you to meet preacher Mills.
he runs the local-- - Ministry.
if you're in town long, you should come hear his word. - Oh, thank you.
preacher has some information that he thinks might help the case.
it's about Lucas Wagner, the male victim.
my congregation started as a thought, or-- or rather a dream.
I imagined a place where everyone could come to hear the truth without being judged, and I--I didn't care whether you subscribed to the old testament or the new testament.
all that I required was that there was love in your heart. That's noble.
look, I neither judge nor devalue.
I embrace. And when I hug my flock...
they whisper. - What do they whisper?
secrets. They tell me about the things that are rotting their souls.
the affairs they've had, the money they've stolen, the lascivious thoughts that permeate their sick minds.
did Lucas Wagner have secrets? - Yes.
and it weighs heavily on my heart.
see, his daddy lost his job.
his mama took gravely ill.
so in order to help out, he took to the streets...
with the other girls, so to speak. - Lucas was a male prostitute.
and he didn't discriminate with his clientele.
then why was he arrested for solicitation? - The judge liked his parents.
he wanted to save them the embarrassment.
you see, we walk through life pretending to be one thing when we're really another.
and like the opposing sides, truth is a magnet and it sticks to you.
there's no steering clear of his law.
have you by any chance heard a whisper about Mack the Knife?
no, that name means nothing to me.
OK. Well, thank you. That info is very helpful.
you know, I had to counsel Lucas' mother.
she felt terrible guilt about his death, and she said his wounds ran very deep.
indeed, they did. - Can you tell me what they look like?
only that they were very deep.
if you hear anything that may pertain to the case, we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know.
of course.
if we can't find the answers, trust me...
he will.
look, if we get any breaks, I promise I will call you.
preacher. - Carrie.
I heard what happened.
if you need to talk, my door's always open.
God bless. God bless.
the cuts on the back run underneath the scapula.
what kind of knife did he use? - Sharp one.
well, we've ruled out rape, but you still needed to run a rape kit on her.
why didn't you?
she was a hooker. This was easy math.
well, how about this?
if this were torture, the victim would be flailing about.
you'd see a jagged cutting pattern as a result.
so?
the marks on Abigail Jones are clean.
how do you account for that? - Drugs.
well, did you find drugs in the autopsy or tox screen? - Oh, I didn't order any of that.
why not?
C. O.D. was a gunshot wound to the head. Hello.
doctor, where did you go to medical school?
Oh, I ain't a doctor. I was elected to this position.
democracy in action.
you know, I call up M. E.s when I need 'em.
well, then, uh, why don't you call up the bodies, then, of Hannah Kelly and Lucas Wagner for us.
you want to dig up those bodies?
Why? I'm gonna need a reason if I'm gonna submit the request.
we need to do the work you didn't do in the first place to confirm our theory.
now that we know that Lucas Wagner was a male prostitute, the unsub's M. O. makes more sense.
this probably wasn't torture. Then what was it?
it was consensual S&M that ended with a gunshot.
Yeah, I'm all good.
tired. You?
well, Dinah's been paid in full, which means the man upstairs is happy.
so...
all right, Belinda. We'll talk tomorrow, ok?
all right.
I am beautiful.
I am beautiful.
I am...
I am...
all right, guys,
I'll cut the binds and then we can let her down carefully.
on 3. 1...2...
what are you doing?! - Do not disturb the crime scene.
well, we took a bunch of pictures just like you ordered us to.
I ordered you not to touch a damn thing. - We need to look at this crime scene undisturbed.
do you mind not standing there? Thanks.
he's escalated his cuts. They're not only bigger
cutting was done postmortem. It was the gunshot that killed her.
how can you tell? - Based on the lack of blood flow and scar tissue.
if she were alive when this was done, there would be a lot more blood on her back.
which means this wasn't S&M. This was symbolic.
symbolic of what? - We're not sure.
can you smell that? - Lavender.
that doesn't grow in these parts. - It's mainly around her legs.
why would he do that? - Reid, can you look into it?
we can't trust the coroner to follow through. - Yeah.
we need to deliver the profile.
I just don't understand why this has happened. - You have to trust.
how can I trust? She was my sister and now she's dead.
Abigail is in a safe place now. - How do you know that?
if it's so safe, why aren't any of us in a hurry to get there?
I understand your doubts, but you must have faith.
I know that this is just a path that we're on, a spiritual journey in a physical form, and just because your sister isn't with us doesn't mean she isn't among us.
they're coming for me!
they're coming for me!
are you ok, dear? - No, I see them.
I saw someone watching me last night. - Who?
they. Them.
they tied her to a tree, and-- - Who? Who you talking about?
Tabitha. They killed her, and now all of the streets are blocked off.
is this armageddon? I don't want to die.
you're not gonna die. You're gonna stay in my office where you'll be safe from his evil wrath.
where are you going, preacher? Well, I'm going to go to the police.
they need to know this monster is still out there.
and we need to know what they're gonna do about it. Come with me, child.
we believe the unsub we're looking for is a white male in his early 30s.
while his M. O. is that of a sadist, we think there's an underlying pathology of what we call a wound collector.
what's that?
a wound collector is someone who uses a lifetime of sleights, grievances, and wrongs as justification for violence.
examples can be as large-scale as Hitler scapegoating the Jews for the holocaust.
or as common as an abusive husband blaming his wife as an excuse to beat her.
this unsub is low key, almost submissive in public. He has to be to attract the prostitutes.
but his real nature will be revealed in the safety of isolation.
this is the type of man who would anonymously express himself online by raging against how these women are filled with disease and filth, how they deserve what's coming to them, probably to cover for the rejection of a woman or spouse who's wronged him.
which means the unsub probably has a working-class or part-time job.
it gives him the time to plan and execute the murders.
he's strong and good with his hands and probably drives a work truck or large vehicle.
this allows him to move the bodies and carry to tools for posing his victims.
tabitha Ryerson tells us he's losing control.
he killed her in her home and then transported her body to the woods so he could mutilate her postmortem.
the public nature of the display was a message. - To who?
to us.
this is a small town and he knows the FBI is here investigating his crimes.
he thinks he showing us that he's smarter than we are. He's also showing us his wounds.
there's part of him that wants us to stop and punish him for his crimes.
thank you. Excuse me.
Yeah, Garcia. - Sir, I found something odd in Tabitha Ryerson's records.
it turns out she was quite the independent contractor. She accepted credit card payments.
there's one here for a new client she was going to see for the first time tomorrow.
it's labeled "Mack." I'm thinking Mack the Knife, maybe.
what's the name on the credit card?
I'm gonna ask you this one time.
did you write on that desk? - I don't know.
I asked you a yes or no question. "I don't know" is not an answer.
I don't know" is for children of poor character, who come face to face with their own failings as stewards of the community.
now, yes or no, did you write that disgusting message on the desk?!
principal McIntyre! - Who are you?
we're with the FBI, and you need to let that child go and come with us.
I'm the principal of this school. You can't just walk in here.
Yeah, well, we need to talk about Mack the Knife.
look, those women I had sessions with, ok, maybe some money changed hands, but that was just for their time.
Yeah, we read the disclaimers on those escort websites, too.
take us through the different prostitutes you hired. - Sado-masochism is not a crime.
it's legal, as long as I don't have sex with them.
And--and-- and you--and you can't tell anybody about this.
I'm entitled to my privacy on this. I have kids.
you're not here because of the S&M. You're here because of the murders.
what murders? - Tabitha Ryerson.
she's dead?
I was gonna meet with her for the first time tomorrow.
now it's your turn. You give us names.
Abigail's my favorite.
what about the men?
so you know about that, too?
Mm-hmm. Just assume we know everything.
that way, things will go a lot easier for all of us.
Lucas Wagner. Just him.
now, they all call you Mack the Knife.
do you still have the knife you used on them?
what do you mean? - Well, you cut them, didn't you?
no.
you--you don't understand. This is
no, I'm not being threatening, ok?
I just want to show you what I mean.
you see?
they cut me. How could it not be him?
he had S&M sessions with all the victims.
we profiled that this unsub would be submissive in public and dominant with the prostitutes, and McIntyre is the opposite.
he takes the submissive role in the S&M play most likely because he's so dominant as a principal at his parochial school.
so we're back to the starting point. Our best bet is still the prostitutes.
Tabitha's death might scare some of them into talking to us.
Mrs. Lawson? - Did preacher Mills talk to you?
not since yesterday. Why?
we were talking in his church, and one of the girls, Belinda, I think, came in begging for help.
the preacher said he was gonna tell you what she saw and get an update on the case, but he never game back.
when was this? - This morning.
no, we haven't seen him.
what do you mean? She said the same thing my sister did.
they" were coming to get her. What the hell's going on?
excuse me for just a moment.
guys, I think I know what the lavender on Tabitha Ryerson's legs is about.
have you ever heard of spikenard? - Uh, no. It's perfume.
it's mentioned in the gospel. It's derived from lavender.
it's what Mary Magdalene used to wash Jesus' feet, which tells us that this unsub's message is obviously religious in nature.
preacher Mills, maybe. He came forward to volunteer information.
well, yesterday he said he'd let us know if he had any more information, but apparently he's changed his mind.
he fits the profile. He's morally rigorous, submissive in public.
so we'll put an APB out for him.
Where's Dinah?! Check the back, padre.
I got 15 minutes, preach, if you're interested.
Dinah. - What's goin' on, preach?
the man upstairs wants answers.
if you can't make sure my bitches are safe, then what good are you?
I don't know who's hurtin' 'em. - Well, figure it out.
unless you want to join them.
love is spoken here
I haven't seen the preacher since this morning.
he was talking to one of those girls. - Do you know if she's still here?
I think she slipped out. Her name was Belinda.
do you mind if we check the back? - Oh, no.
well, I don't get it.
if the preacher had something to do with it, then why was he so helpful?
unsubs insert themselves into investigations all the time.
they enjoy the power and the feeling that they're smarter than us.
and to keep tabs on the case. He wanted to know how close we were to catching him.
go ahead, Garcia. Sir, I got the backhoe going into this not-so-clean preacher.
I haven't found his present whereabouts yet, but I'm looking at his bank account.
I can tell you he doesn't adhere to the "give all your money to the poor" model.
any idea where the money's coming from?
not yet. But it's mostly cash, and we're talking 6 figures big.
you know, maybe it's sex trafficking.
this unsub is able to get prostitutes to let their guard down.
they're somebody he knows. - I thought you said our killer was a john.
prostitutes would rat out a john or kill him themselves, but they would never go against their own pimp.
Garcia, take everything we know about Mills and run it up against pandering and procuring charges.
this isn't the first time he's done this. - You got it.
I swear to God, I don't know who's doing this.
all I ask is you keep my property clean. No diseases, no drugs, and you collect my money.
now, which John likes to beat them? Who likes to get rough?
I don't know!
who likes to tie them down? 'Cause that's who's doing this!
OK. Ok. Ok.
there's the guys over in Oakwood who can get a little freaky.
stop! Stop! Stop. Stop.
and then there's Mike, our mechanic. I mean, he had Tabitha bleeding once.
Mike's so fat, he gets winded hoisting a damn hot dog. He couldn't tie her to a tree!
and then there's Travis, the druggie.
Yeah. Yeah, he snitches to the cops for quick fixes.
Yeah, and he cut Belinda once.
I mean, he could've made the wounds on the girls. - You know what these wounds look like?
I heard from one of the girls at the station that they were kind of criss-cross.
I mean, Travis could have done that.
what else have you heard?
the Feds are looking for someone who wants to clean up the streets.
it is time to pay the butcher a visit.
well, Travis lives near Rodgers Park, but he does coke in that house on Dunbar.
did you know the charge of being a pimp, when gussied up, is "procuring and pandering"?
and Hotch was right.
preacher Mills is familiar with this charge.
because before he was Justin Mills, he was Gordon Borell, and he was arrested for cutting one of the ladies he employed.
where did he cut her?
on the back. When questioned, she said
Oh, I'm gonna have to look at kitten videos after this
he was marking his property.
you're kidding.
that's why he specifically asked me about the wounds on Lucas Wagner.
he knew we'd find out about his past. - Why didn't we turn this up before now?
because he changed his name when he crossed the border. The northern border to be exact.
Mr. Mills, nee Borell, is from Tees, Alberta.
I'll tell you what. Those Canadians, the seem so sweet and innocent, but when they go bad, they go Darth Vader bad.
so he came here to start over, took on the mantle of the collar as the perfect cover for the sex trade.
no one in this town would question a man of God. But now we got the smoking gun we need on this guy.
Garcia, was there an attempted murder charge?
no. In fact, she said he wanted her to go back out and start working when he was done cutting her.
he's not our unsub.
go, go.
no. No, no.
word is you're quite skilled with a knife, Travis. Huh?!
are you framin' me? - No, man.
you tell me the truth, you son of a bitch.
I--I didn't do-- I didn't do it.
then who is?! Someone's trying to make this look like my handiwork.
you tell them to make themselves known or I damn sure will.
OK.
what do you want me to do?
work a miracle.
this guy fits to a "T." How can we rule him out?
Criminally, pimps follow the same behavioral pattern as drug dealers.
prostitutes are his revenue stream. - He would only kill them as a last resort.
which is why the cutting in Canada was a punishment, not a religious punishment, but a punishment for not doing their jobs.
then he comes here to start over, set up a new shop.
and that's when somebody found out about his past, used it as a forensic countermeasure to throw us off track by framing him.
that's why the girls kept saying, "they're" after us.
there wasn't a team of unsubs, but one sadist copying the behavior of another.
it would also explain the change with Tabitha, the escalation, the perfume on the feet.
but you said the unsub wanted us to catch him and punish him.
what he really wanted was for us to catch the preacher.
so whoever this guy is, he's fooled all of us, and now we got nothin' when it comes to the profile.
no, that's not true. The unsub chose Mills for a reason, and Mills can still lead us to the unsub.
we'll have agent Morgan and the deputies start at his house.
What?! - I got the guy who did it.
good boy.
is it one of them? - Yeah.
and I even got the gun he used to kill them.
all right. Where can we meet.
regular place, two hours?
I did what you said. - Yes, you did.
that's a good job, too. I almost believed you.
come on, man, give me the stuff. - Oh, right. Here you go.
no, no!
we just went through the preacher's house. No one's in there.
but I did find cocaine in a hidden compartment. - How much?
a kilo. With that amount, he's not just using it, he's selling it, too.
if that's the case, then the suspect pool of whoever's framing him just got a lot bigger.
well, JJ's headed to the bar to see if Dinah's seen him.
Dinah left about an hour ago. - Was she with the preacher?
he was here earlier, Dinah and him were talking, and then he left all in a huff.
do you know where he was going? - Didn't ask. He was too pissed off.
all right. Thanks.
Hey, Hotch. - Any luck?
he's not here either.
I've got roadblocks on ever corner in an out of town. He won't get far.
JJ, help canvass the area. We'll dig deeper here and see if we can figure out where he's going.
all right.
yo, this is Travis. Leave it after the beep.
what
where are you? I don't see your car here.
we said 8: 00. Hurry up.
sheriff, be advised. I've got the suspect headed into el Lobito's diner.
repeat, I've got the suspect headed into el Lobito's diner.
copy, deputy. We're on our way.
we got him. All right, Blake, you and Reid go with the sheriff.
Dave and I will coordinate the response here.
the preacher's not answering.
keep trying. We need to tell him we know he didn't do this.
Yeah.
Oh, preacher, what have you gotten yourself into?
I didn't do any of this. You did this to me.
is that what you're gonna tell the feds? Who, incidentally, are on their way.
you think they're gonna believe a pimp like you?
sorry. A preacher like you?
we had a deal. Yes, we did, but the deal's changed.
I helped you! And I'm helping you.
I didn't leave you empty-handed. You got yourself a fighting chance.
Oh, you hear those sirens? Tick tock, preacher, tick tock.
I will destroy you. - In heaven or in hell?
which one are you gonna go to, huh?
you got anything you want to get off your chest, because the hour of reckoning is upon you, preacher man.
you son of a bitch.
next time you tell your whores to keep their mouths shut.
good luck.
he's been in there a good 5 minutes now. I haven't seen any movement yet.
what about patrons? - Uh, it's closed.
how many entrances? - Two, it looks like.
the question is, is he alone?
guys, I've got movement. We should move in now, sheriff.
actually, we're better off establishing the perimeter first.
then we can open up a line of communication.
all right, agreed. We need to get around
shots fired! Shots fired!
move!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
to BE CONTINUED...

OK. What would you like to say to Jessica?

"on highway. Car keys and tai chi." Ready to send it?
cancel. Cancel.

text Jessica.
OK. What would you like to say to Jessica?

No! No.

Hey, buddy!
Hey! Come on. Get out of the road!
Hey, get out of the street, man.
come on, there's-- come on, you gotta be careful, man.
there's cars comin'. Come on.
Hey. Get off me!
slow down, slow down! Get out of the road!
I know. There's a guy running across the street.
Hey, no, no, wait! Hey, come back.
come back, wait! Get them off me!
get them off me! Get them off me!
wait!
bone up on your manners and your vitamin C deficiencies, crime tigers, because we are going to the peachtree capital of America, Atlanta, Georgia.
what's in Atlanta?
local P. D. has invited us in for an equivocal death investigation.
this is Albert Stillman. He is an investigative journalist for a local paper.
3 days ago he disappeared on his way to talk to a source for a story, and last night he was killed wandering into traffic.
wait. Equivocal death means we help determine homicide versus suicide, right?
or death by misadventure.
my point. So what happened to Mr. Stillman was tragic, but what's to equivocate?
I mean, he had some sort of mental break, end of story.
except that he had no history of mental illness. Could this have been drug induced?
maybe. One of his most recent stories was an expose on an inner city drug ring, and he received death threats for that one. Dealers wouldn't let him loose in traffic, though.
if somebody wanted him killed, why not just shoot him?
we have to reconstruct his life to answer that question.
reporters like Stillman don't just snap. Something or someone drove him insane.
if you didn't put it there, who would, then?
somebody else did. You have the wrong guy.
if you didn't do it, who did it?! You have the wrong guy.
who did it, Albert? I don't know.
who did it? You want me to be...
why don't you let me go?
is that what you want? No, I don't. Come on
you see it. You see it. You know.
why don't you let me go. You know. You know.
you see it, don't you? I'm bleeding.
I'll go with you if I don't , ok?
it's right here. This is where it goes. See it?
answer the question. You see it. You see it.
no, I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see anything.
please, let me go.
Ohh! What is it? What is it?
dear God! It's
it's--it's-- I see it.
I see it! I see it! I see it!
I see it! I see it!
"what's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourself scabs?"

mob Organizations Have Their Hands Up the Skirts of Strip Clubs
you can see why Albert Stillman was nominated for awards.
he wrote pieces on homeless children, police corruption, bankrolling local strip clubs.
my kind of muckraker. Fights for the little guy.
those are also the kind of stories that put him in harm's way, though.
any one of them could have gotten him killed.
it doesn't fit this M. O. though.
we need to consider the likelihood that there is no unsub, that whatever happened to Stillman could have just been an accident.
what do we know about the source he was going to see the night he disappeared?
oy, I have an update on that, mademoiselle.
I have been talking and working with Atlanta P. D.'s perfectly lovely I. T. expert.
"perfectly lovely" is code for not as good as you, right, baby girl?
moi, throw shade? Never.
let's just say with a lot of my help, we've managed to narrow down the possibilities to a throwaway cell that called him hours before his disappearance.
so it's a dead end, then. Yeah, and not the only one.
Stillman's editor has dealt us an "Aw, come on" surprise by filing an injunction to halt the autopsy of the recently deceased body.
but we have jurisdiction here. That's pointless.
and suspicious. Thanks, Garcia.
all right, when we land, Kate and I will go talk to the editor, find out what he's hiding.
Dave, you and Morgan re-interview the witness who tried to save Stillman's life.
and Reid and JJ, let's move forward with the M. E.
we're not going to let an injunction stop the investigation.
atlanta POLICE DEPARTMENT
so... Thanks.
did he say anything else to you besides "get off me"?
no, he just--just kind of screamed it over and over and over.
what else was he doing? I don't know, man, the guy was a schizo.
OK, I hear you. But any details you can give us about what he was saying or how he was saying it might help us figure out what happened to him.
the whole time, he was... hitting the air.
like he was fighting someone?
Yeah. Except I don't think it was someone, I think it was something.
a lot of somethings, because right before he...
you know... He looked right at me and he said...
get them off me!
them.
you think he said "get them off me"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so. What do you think it was?
I don't know.
but it couldn't have been good.
agents, I appreciate you coming down here, but I have nothing to say to you about the injunction.
a newspaper editor telling the FBI "no comment."
that's ironic. I think we're done here.
no, sir, we're not. This is a pointless exercise.
tomorrow we'll be back with a warrant and we'll get the answers we came for.
unless that's the point. Waste our time and buy some more of your own.
time? To do what?
get ahead of the story. One of your own is dead. That reflects badly on you.
Albert Stillman deserves some privacy.
he was my friend. Then cooperate.
because if a friend of mine died the way yours did,
I wouldn't rest until I got to the bottom of it.
his behavior seemed like a psychosis from binge methamphetamine or cocaine use.
go the other direction.
benzos. Downers.
for his back. And when he couldn't get any more,
I tried to get it for him, but by then he wasn't interested.
cause he'd moved on to something cheaper, like street heroin.
that's why I filed the injunction.
I didn't want you or the police to look at a toxicology report and write him off as another junkie.
I think there's more to it than that. Yeah, so do we.
what do you know about the source he was going to meet?
not much. All he told me, he was writing a piece on, uh, vaccinations.
I'd like to see his notes. He kept it all up here.
said it was the one hard drive nobody could hack or subpoena.
so whatever that last story was, it died with him.
how we doing, beautiful? My perfectly coiffed eyebrows furrowed in concern.
do you know that throwaway cell phone that called Albert Stillman?
Yeah.
it made another call this morning to a Dr. William Suri.
he is a research scientist in entomology, of all things.
baby girl, hold on a second.
12th PRECINCT CASE# VICTIM LOCATION DIVISION ASSIGNED STATUS
this guy work at Barnett College? I know you guys are psychic, but how did you do that?
they've been dealing with some college incident all morning.
I'll call you back.
officer. The incident at the college-- what do we know?
all we got is there was a fight in the research lab, but nobody saw anything.
it's locked up now. Detectives are heading over. All right, we need that address.
crime SCENE DO NOT CROSS
no forced entry.
Dr. Suri let his attacker in.
this wasn't an assault, it was an abduction.
what do we know about this guy?
well, according to his assistant, he was published but controversial.
controversial. We're talking about bugs, right?
he had extreme theories on the impact humans have on insect mating habits.
this is probably the doctor's cell phone.
whoever did this made sure to leave it behind.
didn't want us tracing him through GPS because of the unsub's organization.
it also means this isn't an equivocal death investigation anymore.
this is serial.
Spence. The M. E. has something we need to see right away.
you. What are you doing to me?
what do you want? You said you wanted proof.
so you attack me? You bring me to this place?!
where are we? Do you see it?
please tell me that is not my blood.
no. No, it's mine.
don't you see anything strange about it?
I--I need to look at it under a slide, run some tests
what are you talking about? It's right there in front of you. It's black!
no, it's not. What are you talking about?
Ah! You've corrupted the sample.
how could I have corrupted the sample?!
look at me! Look what you're doing to me!
I'm tied to a chair!
now, I--I have listened to you.
I have entertained all of your theories.
but what you have described to me...
it is not possible.
it might be real to you, but that is...
that is because you are sick.
Yeah.
you're right.
let me show you what it feels like to be sick like I am!
No!
duct tape residue was found on his wrist, ankles, and neck.
so he was held against his will? Yeah.
it's the rest of it I can't explain.
the victim's own skin was found under his fingernails.
the fingernails were in turn gouged into different parts of his body.
he broke them off scratching himself?
Yeah. And kept scratching all the way down to his subcutaneous layer on his index and middle fingers.
are these track marks consistent with heroin abuse?
Oh, yeah. Tox screen came back positive, too.
when was the last time he shot up? Based on scar tissue, I'd say about a week ago.
OK, so he was kicking when the unsub held him.
one of the withdrawal symptoms of that is it feels like your skin is on fire.
you can't help but scratch. Think about this for a second.
Stillman was bound, but the unsub cut him loose.
he wanted him to scratch. That tells us this isn't torture.
if it were torture, he would have never taken the duct tape off.
what if it's an expression of his own pain?
maybe the unsub wants his victims to feel what's going on inside of him.
which is? Welts on the skin behind his ear.
some sort of external irritant the unsub introduced.
saw that, too. Lab's running tests.
I don't know, a bite, maybe?
wait--wait
wait! Wait.
what are you doing?
what are you doing, please?!
no, no, no! No, no, please don't-- please don't do this!
no, you're right! I hear you, I hear you.
please. Please. don't do this!
I beg you, please don't do this!
please think about this. You're right! Please stop it!
don't, don't, please! don't do this to me.
we can talk about this.
I want to talk about this. Please, please, don't do it!
No! Oh, no! No, stop it!
Oh, no, please!
no more, please! Please stop it!
no, no! You're right! No, stop it!
Oh, my god! No!
No! Please stop it! Please stop it!
Oh, stop it! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
Oh, please! Stop it!
so, we found William Suri.
Yeah. Garbage truck almost ran over him this morning.
our unsub didn't hold him as long.
then he shot him pointblank in the head. Big change in M. O.
not necessarily. He shows less signs of scratching, but the bite marks are definitely there.
so, the unsub wants this guy to itch, the good Doctor doesn't play along, bang, he ends the torture early.
I don't think this is torture for the unsub. I think it's a delusion.
can I have those tweezers? What kind of delusion?
bugs.
we need to deliver the profile.
we believe the unsub we're looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis, a condition in which the patient believes that he's being attacked or infested by bugs.
he takes his victims and covers them in insects, cockroaches specifically.
we think it's to convince his victims that they share in his condition.
is he trying to get them sick so he can kill them? Murder isn't his goal, attention is.
believe it or not, this unsub is crying out for help.
he kidnapped an investigative journalist because he wanted Albert Stillman to write a story about the bugs inside of him.
unfortunately, because Stillman was suddenly experiencing opiate withdrawal, he was already hallucinating insects, and this led to a psychotic break.
so the unsub changed tactics.
he kidnapped a controversial research scientist who he thought would be more willing to believe him.
but we think Dr. Suri recognized his condition for the mental illness that it is.
that's why he killed him so quickly.
it is important that we not label this unsub as crazy or insane to the media or press.
he's desperate to confirm his own self-diagnosis and he'll be violent towards those who don't.
and this kind of delusion goes hand in hand with conspiracy thinking.
he probably believes the bugs are part of a plot involving the government to keep him sick.
when he's alone, he'll be paranoid and disorganized.
his body will be mutilated from self-harm.
but his search for a fellow believer will give him focus and allow him to appear calm and rational.
we should be canvassing the entomology and infectious disease fields as well as reviewing hospital intake records.
this unsub has searched high and low for treatment for his condition, and we believe that he'll return to one of these locations for his next victim. Thank you.
I think that we have time for one more share.
anybody?
go ahead, Jane.
so, I went back to the dermatologist, and she again tried to tell me what my problem was.
you know, she said that it was maybe mold or static electricity.
I mean, can you think about that, that's what's going on inside my body could be
because of static electricity? Just...
and then she had the nerve to try and sell me a salve.
and when I looked to see what was inside the salve, it was St. John's wort.
I mean, really, do you think I haven't' already tried St. John's wort?
and I just... And I could see it really clearly now, you know?
it's not me. It's society.
you know? They want me to be sick.
because if I'm sick, if it's me, they can keep ignoring me.
but I won't be ignored anymore.
thank you for letting me share.
OK, why don't we stand up and join hands and end our meeting with our prayer.
Lord, grant me the wisdom to see the light...
Hi. I'm Leo.
the strength to believe the truth...
serenity with my body...
the courage to know how to...
there's an inherent contradiction in who this unsub is.
only one? All right, humor me.
this guy has a phobia of insects, right? So why subject his victims to the very thing he hates?
it's not a phobia. Well, maybe not, but the bugs disgust him.
labels are important here. The original name for this was entomophobia, which is, yes, the fear/ disgust at being bitten, being stung, or the fear of future infestation, but if you have delusional parasitosis, you believe you're already infested.
present tense, not future tense. So his worst fear has come true.
what he wants now is exposure.
he believes if society and the scientific community take him seriously, maybe he'll get relief.
Yeah, but that's impossible if it's all in his head.
the more people that tell him that, the more angry he's gonna get.
which is why he'll take solace in people who are as frustrated as he is.
guys, there's a suspect pool we've been missing all along.
I'm here for helping.
Garcia, I'm going to run through a series of debated and controversial diseases.
I want you to tell me if there are any support groups in the area.
hit me. - Fibromyalgia.
no. Chronic fatigue syndrome.
no. Recurrent Lyme disease.
negative. Morgellons?
there's a Magellan's astronomy club that meets on Tuesdays.
no, morgellons. M - o - r - g - e - l - l - o- n - s.
huh. Those vowels will get ya.
checking now.
I'll bite. What's morgellons?
it's a syndrome where sufferers believe they have disease-causing fibers under their skin.
they collect them only to later be told by dermatologists that all they've found is lint, dead skin, or their own picked scabs.
sounds like it's on the OCD spectrum.
there's a lot of overlap. There's also patients who insist the fibers are insect-like in nature.
Yeah, update. There's a morgellons group that gets together tonight, actually.
just missed then. Garcia, we need an address.
done.
JJ, you and Morgan go and see if they'll talk to us.
no, no, no, no. The drinking water.
drinking wa...
you think they put it in the drinking water?
Yeah, that's the easiest way to infect us.
that means everyone's sick. Everyone is sick.
see, but you and I, we react to it differently. Right?
we feel it differently. That's what makes us special.
so...
if it's this thing that I have... We have.
that we have...
is real-- Oh, it's very real.
how do I get people to believe us?
I was getting really close, and that's when they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill you?
when you worked at... Well, how do you live with that?
they could just come and get you anytime.
actually, I'm grateful. 'Cause whatever they did to me, it turned up the volume, ok?
it improved my intuition, my instincts.
when something's wrong, it comes out more.
while we've been sitting here, it hasn't come out once.
that tells me something. Yeah.
I haven't felt it either. See?
maybe that's the cure.
you and me.
maybe.
how bad does it get for you?
pretty bad.
do you want to see? Yeah, but...not here.
let's get out of here.
why am I not surprised that the FBI is showing up at my meetings?
look, we're just asking if you can think of anyone who might fit our profile.
Oh, I'll tell you what I think.
I think this is the same tactic that the FBI pulls over and over again.
occupy, WTO, anti-war groups, only this time, you people are really scraping the bottom of the barrel.
I'll bet that you even worked out a little shakedown speech on the way over.
Hey, weirdoes, we support your right for free assembly, but there might be a serial killer among you, so watch your back.
right? You want us scared.
you want us isolated.
that way it's easier for you to tell us morgellons is made up.
ms. Randall, we have no opinion about your condition one way or the other.
do you see this man?
his name is Albert Stillman.
and this man. Dr. William Suri.
do you see him?
this is not made up. This is real.
the man we're looking for thinks he has cockroaches inside of him.
he'd be quiet. Not demonstrative.
probably not comfortable sharing to the entire group, but very convincing one on one.
ms. Randall, do you know anyone like that?
no.
no one.
what makes you think that he would even show up here?
cause your group would listen to what he has to say, and you'd believe him.
but that doesn't mean we're like him. No, it doesn't.
but it could mean you're his next target.
you sure?
Yeah.
you ready?
OK.
I didn't want you to tense up.
no, it's ok. It's worse when you tense up.
Oh, it's perfect. Uh, can you hand me a slide?
Yeah.
OK.
all right. look.
they should be wiggling.
can you see them? Please see them.
Yeah. I see them.
thank you.
are they only in your blood?
no.
they're everywhere.
tell me again that it's real.
it's real.
can you heal me?
Yeah. I can.
where are we on the E. R. intake?
Garcia weeded out the mental health transfers.
no one fits. Our best bet is still the morgellons group.
when's their next meeting? - Next week.
it's too long to wait. We could take another shot at the leader.
there's definitely something that she was holding back.
you had thought she wouldn't rattle. She won't.
we're gonna have to find some other way in.
top of the morning, fellow leprechauns.
where did Lisa Randall go after she met with JJ and Morgan?
according to her credit card...
drugstores. 5 of them, to be precise.
and she bought a single item 5 times.
diaper rash cream. - All right, thanks. JJ, see if she'll come in and talk.
Reid, I need you to go to the drugstore.
you sleep?
I never really sleep.
Hi, Jane, honey, come on.
quick like a bunny. Oh, it's Lisa.
what the hell is she doing here? Well, she takes me to the meetings sometimes.
Hey, open this door! Open this door right now!
Hi, honey, it's me. Are you in there?
Jane, open this door!
get rid of her.
calm down. She's one of us, right?
are you in there?
don't.
I want to see who it is.
Hello? It's probably
be quiet. Yes, Agent Jareau.
Yes. Yes, I'll come down to the station.
She--she's talking to the police? Why would she talk to the police like that?
no, no, she called somebody an agent. That--that's not the police, it's the feds.
what do they want with us?
I'll take care of it. Just hold on.
ms. Randall, I'm Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.
I have already told the other agents everything that I have to say.
do you know why you itch?
well, my neurologist tried to explain it as simply as he could to me so I would stop coming to his office.
my amygdala, which is the emotional center of my brain, has hijacked my prefrontal cortex, which is the rational side.
so in times of stress, I itch.
but, look at me now.
I'm in the FBI office being questioned.
one would think that would be a very stressful thing for anyone and I'm not itching.
how old was she when she died?
excuse me? Did she make it to her third birthday?
I don't know who you talked to, but you have no right.
I haven't talked to anyone. I'm trained to see what's in front of me.
I notice that you don't wear a wedding ring under your gloves.
I think a condition like yours makes it difficult to build intimate relationships.
I know you looked everywhere for some sort of relief.
doctors' prescriptions, antihistamines. None of it worked.
nothing until you found this.
this works, doesn't it?
Yes.
someone who's not a mother doesn't stumble on a cure like that by accident.
what was her name?
she was a preemie.
so she was in and out of hospitals a lot.
her skin at the end...
I guess it was from the tests and everything.
I was a new parent.
do you know that feeling of, am I doing it right?
am I helping?
you know? You just don't know.
I'm also trained to listen to what people say, and that question, am I helping?
you ask yourself that every day, don't you?
I know you help the people who come to your meetings.
I know you want to help us.
I do?
Yes, you do. Because there's a man who comes to your meetings who puts you on edge, and your instincts of self-preservation are telling you not to trust him, and those instincts are always right. Who is he?
his name is Leo.
I don't have his number or anything, but I did see him talking to one of my friends last night--Jane.
I knocked on her door this morning.
she didn't answer, but there was someone inside because I heard them whispering.
I need Jane's information immediately.
Jane Posner, this is the FBI. Open up!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
open the door, Jane.
no. No. He was right.
we're not looking for you. We're looking for Leo.
he's not here.
he's gone. Clear.
and you're never gonna find him.
thank you so much.
have you ever heard of a folie a deux, Jane?
it's where two people suffer from the same delusional belief.
we're not delusional.
he gets me. All right.
then tell us where he is so we can understand what the two of you have.
you'll kill him. We're not killers.
we're his best hope for getting better. All we want to do is get him the help he needs.
why should I believe you? You already tried to kill him once.
when was that? don't play dumb. With the vaccinations.
what vaccinations?
I don't have to talk to you. So...
no, all you got to do is listen.
cause the closer we get to the truth, the more you're going to be compelled to itch.
the first victim who met Leo was going to write a story about vaccinations.
is that how this all started, because Leo got vaccinations?
hmm. That's a yes.
find out who gave him the vaccinations, we find Leo.
was it his doctor?
Nope, wasn't his doctor. Must have been work, then.
was it the military? Did Leo serve?
it's not military.
did he work in medicine?
is it the hospital? Is that where he worked?
or was it something more like infectious diseases?
cause you'd have to get vaccinated for that.
like the Centers for Disease Control, right here in Atlanta.
leave him alone. Let's go.
what did you tell them?
I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
no, I didn't. I didn't say anything.
let's go. Let's go.
Leo Jenkins. Haven't thought of him in a while.
our search told us he worked here 6 months ago, but his address isn't current.
Yeah, he asked me to send his last check to a different address.
he was pretty paranoid by the end.
because of the vaccinations? Which he didn't even need.
I mean, he was a low-level lab assistant, for god's sake. We were trying to help him.
why would you give him shots he didn't need?
Leo had a painful case of shingles in his left arm.
one of the docs around here gave him the antiviral acyclovir, which, uh, deadened the nerves in his arm...
altogether. Here's his address.
how did that lead to cockroaches?
your brain and nervous system work on a best-guess feedback loop.
the nerves might be dead, but your brain hasn't figured that out yet.
it's still sending stimuli to the dead nerves in an attempt to get them to react.
like an amputee who has feeling in his phantom limb.
exactly. Leo started scratching and he couldn't stop.
well, we told him the feelings will come back when the drugs wore off, but, uh, he insisted that we'd put cockroach larvae in his vaccine.
that it was a conspiracy, that we were all trying to kill him.
we tried almost everything to talk him out of it. Well, almost everything.
what didn't you try?
Leo, the FBI is looking for you.
Yeah, I know they are.
what I don't know is who you are.
I had to rethink everything I know about you.
at the meetings, when you shared about pulling the fibers from your body and you said they felt like spider legs...
you talked about how that made you feel crazy 'cause you're afraid of spider legs?
but is that true?
are you afraid of spiders, Lisa? Yes.
you are? Yes.
No...You don't have to do this.
no, I do have to. I do have to, because, see, I don't know what the truth is anymore.
no.
see, you and I are gonna have a little chat.
I'll just tell you anything that you want to know.
just tell me what you want to know.
it's simple. Who do you work for?
I don't--I don't work for anybody.
who do you work for? Who do you work for?
I don't work for anybody!
I just don't work for anybody.
you don't work for anybody? You're unemployed?
I don't know what you want me to say.
who do you work for? Ok?
we'll keep going. We'll keep going until you give me...
who do you work for? Ohh!
I don't work for anybody! No!
I don't work for anybody! Who do you work for?!
FBI! don't move!
Oh, God.
of course.
she works for you, doesn't she?
we're not here for her. We're here to talk to you.
how about you let her go and we'll do that.
you want to talk? Then how come these things in my arms are going crazy, huh?
I know how this goes, ok? I know how this goes.
you shoot me and then you cover up the whole thing. That's how it goes.
is it happening now? Of course it's happening now.
don't tell me you don't see it. Come on, you see it.
you see it!
I can make it go away.
now, is that your phone?
Yeah, that's my phone.
Don't--what are you doing?
now, look at the camera.
what? I've shot video footage of myself a million times.
you guys do something to it and the image is gone.
it's gone. You guys do something to it.
I'm not shooting video. This is a reflection.
now look at it. Go ahead, look.
look at your arm.
is it going away?
that's a trick. It's no trick.
how did you do that?
we can make them go away forever.
but you have to let her go, Leo.
what? Leo?
how the hell do you know my name?! Don't move, don't even flinch.
get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off!
see 'em, see 'em, see 'em, see 'em? Right there.
right there.
I got 'em. I got 'em. Ok.
I got 'em. I got 'em.
so that's it? You ruin my life, now I'm free to go?
you're not an accessory. You didn't know what Leo was doing.
so, yeah, you're free to go.
you killed him, didn't you? I told you, we're not killers.
I don't believe you. You used me.
you tricked me, so you could get him.
Jane, hey.
Jane. Hey, hey, would you just listen to me for a second, ok?
get away from me.
OK, yeah, I had a job to do and I'm not going to apologize for that.
but that doesn't mean that this is over. Leo, he still needs you.
how? He has a good chance of pleading insanity, and he is going to need someone on his side to explain his condition to the court.
Oh, yeah. 'Cause if he's insane, you could put him away forever.
of course you didn't kill him, 'cause that would make a martyr out of him.
but if he's crazy, no one will ever know what I know.
nobody. Which is that he's right!
OK? About the government and the drinking water and you.
all of it! He was going to kill Lisa.
he--he wouldn't do that. I was there.
he had a gun to her head.
Mm. Lies.
lies, lies, and more lies.
and you FBI jackbooted thugs will do anything to protect yourselves from him exposing you as the filthy liars that you are.
Rossi, that was a pretty gutsy move. How'd you know it was gonna work?
the doc at the CDC told us about something they wanted to try but never got around to.
it's called a mirror box. Oh, I read about that treatment.
what's this treatment? It's for amputees with searing pain in their phantom limbs.
basically, you take a patient, you put them in front of a mirror and you tell them to conduct a symphony, to wave, or just to relax.
when their brain sees what's not there, the pain goes away.
and since the unsub had dead nerves in his arm due to the shingles antiviral...
you could argue that his itch was the same thing as phantom limb pain,
I mean from a brain- nervous system feedback loop.
my hope was that the trick would make the itch go away, and it did, for a few seconds, anyway.
I can understand being driven crazy by something you can't scratch, but killing people over it, that's what surprises me.
there is one documented case about a woman who couldn't stop scratching, even when she was asleep.
she woke up one morning realizing she'd scratched through her own scalp, her skull, and directly into her brain tissue.
OK, on that note, my ride's here.
how did it go with Jane? She blames us for everything.
now she's gonna go back to the group and we'll be their new excuse for why they can't get better.
how do we help somebody like that?
well, one of them's feeling better already.
getting rid of a delusion makes us wiser than getting hold of the truth.
pumpkin patch welcome!
Hey, this one's good.
what do you think, honey?
Oh, my God.
my God!
don't ever do that. Ok? You can't just walk off.
you have to tell me where you're going.
look, mom. I found a guy taking a nap.
did you find him here like that?
you see any grownups?
hello.
hello. Are you ok?
Oh, my God.
Aah! Let me out!
let me out! Aah!
we need the details of the Cronenberg case uploaded to ViCAP asap, and Cruz is expecting our assessments for his presentation to JCS and DOJ.
consider it d-o-n-e. And, Garcia, I owe you another one.
no, you don't. Get out of here.
all right, call me if you need me.
I will. And have a happy Halloween.
happy Halloween.
eek. See ya.
we're closed!
I'm Aaron Hotchner. I'm a friend of Penelope's.
you're friends with Penelope? - We work together, yes.
honey, I thought you was a bill collector. Come on in and get out of that rain.
thank you.
Madame Bouvier, I presume?
the one and only.
I just put on some tea. You want a cup?
no, thank you.
suit yourself. Wait here.
I got what you came for.
Ooh! Penelope called just in time.
I've been looking for one for weeks. Where did you find it?
I suppose miss Garcia didn't tell you. Madame Bouvier never reveals her secrets.
no, she didn't mention that. I'm sorry.
child, I'm playin'. My cousin runs a prop house in Hollywood.
he FedEx'd it.
well, you and your cousin are gonna make one boy's Halloween very special.
how much do I owe you?
you know what? It's on the house.
any friend of Penelope is a friend of Madame Bouvier.
no, I insist.
no, no, no. I insist.
any man that will come out in this mess for his son deserves a break.
the world could use more good fathers.
thank you.
shall I return it Monday?
when you come back, you should let me read your palm.
now, that I'll charge you for.
thank you. Happy Halloween.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
G-man!
wait for it...
lord Vader...
you got it?! Yes!
Oh, my gosh, how did you find it the night before Halloween?
I never real my secrets. Check it out. Totally authentic.
Jack, I am your father.
and, look. Everything lights up.
get the belt out. Can I go try it on?
did you do your homework? - I'll go do it now.
did you have a good dinner?
Yeah! Thanks, Dad. Bye, aunt Jessica.
he's been talking about trick-or-treating nonstop.
Yes, Garcia.
all right.
I'll be right there.
don't worry. Go.
I can stay.
Thanks. I'll go tell Jack.
Oh, my fighters of crime, I hate to call us all in on this Eve of all Hallows Eves, but there are wicked things afoot.
last Halloween, 11-year-old Joshua Parker disappeared in San Diego.
generator should kick in. That was spooky. Joshua Parker.
that name isn't in any of our missing children case files.
what do we know about him? - Chronic runaway and disciplinary problems.
San Diego P. D. never classified it as an abduction.
this morning, Joshua turned up in a pumpkin patch 10 miles from where he was last seen.
I know this case. Same thing happened in L. A. last year.
Yeah, that would be Tommy Wilcox, 10 years old.
he was found at Venice Beach on October 30. He went missing the previous Halloween, too.
Yeah. And he died a few hours after they got him to the hospital.
I thought they caught that guy. He had a bunch of stalker pics of the boy, didn't he?
Yeah, he confessed and pled guilty.
yes and yes. That would be Rodney Tanner, pedophile sex offender, all-around icky person, currently residing at Chino state prison.
so what do we have, a copycat or a coincidence?
we also need to consider the possibility of there being a partner.
how's the Parker kid doing?
he's physically stable, but he's vacillating between catatonic and completely freaked out.
so I'm guessing he's not talking much.
if the pattern holds, another boy will go missing tomorrow night.
and we're headed to San Diego to prevent that from happening.
weather permitting, wheels up in 30.
there is nothing funny about Halloween.
this sarcastic festival reflects rather "an infernal demand for revenge" by children on the adult world.
Jean Baudrillard.
both victims were found exactly 364 days after their disappearance, which suggests they were actually released.
and someone wanted them found.
well, they were each Caucasian boys about the same age.
both grabbed on Halloween night.
so the victimology is consistent, and clearly Halloween is significant. But why?
reeks of a childhood tragedy.
the question is, what did he do with them for 364 days?
what are they doing with them?
can't rule out a partner until we talk to this Tanner creep.
there was no evidence of sexual assault. At least not the traditional kind.
the first victim Tommy Wilcox died from malnutrition, and his muscles were severely atrophied, which means his physical activity must have been extremely limited.
it's possible he spent the duration of his captivity restrained.
he also had puncture wounds, bruises, and was covered in splinters.
what did he do, restrain the boy for a year while he stabbed him and beat him with a two-by-four?
too bad we can't do the same thing to that unsub.
or unsubs. Whatever. I'm down.
JJ, I want you and Reid at the hospital with Joshua Parker, and, Dave, you're with me at San Diego P. D.
and Morgan and Kate, go to Chino state prison, find out of Rodney Tanner has a partner.
thank you for waiting.
well, his physical prognosis is actually quite good.
he's exhausted and slightly dehydrated, but somebody made sure he ate, maybe even gave him vitamin supplements.
were his muscles atrophied by any chance? - Yes. Badly.
he's going to need physical therapy, but in time he should make a full recovery.
what about splinters and puncture wounds? Any sign of those?
Yes. Both. - When do you think he might be able to talk to us?
uh, no time soon, I'm afraid.
it's his mental state that concerns me.
he's sedated now, but when he first came in, he was unable to communicate and extremely agitated.
how so?
he was violent, tried to escape several times, kept screaming, "let me out, let me out."
we restrained him and that only made things worse.
I can't even imagine what he's been through.
excuse me for a moment?
let me out.
what was he in?
a box.
a wooden one, and I'm guessing it wasn't very big.
makes sense. Splinters, no physical activity.
what about the puncture wounds?
nails. The box was probably homemade.
you know, Josh Parker may never be able to tell us what really happened to him.
solitary confinement makes grown men crazy.
imagine what those conditions would do to a child.
there's definitely an evolution between the two victims.
someone made sure that Joshua Parker was kept fed and alive, not like the first victim. Tommy Wilcox wasn't supposed to die either.
killing's not part of the plan. Holding them is all that matters.
here's everything. Digital copies were sent to your tech analyst.
thank you, Detective. Can I ask you guys a question?
shoot. - Honestly, what do you think?
this guy Tanner, he have a partner, or is this some sort of copycat?
well, there's another possibility. What if Tanner had nothing to do with it at all?
M. O. that specific, that usually belongs to a single unsub acting alone.
come on. They found pictures of the Wilcox kid in his apartment.
surveillance photos only. And there were pictures of other boys and they're all alive and well.
but he confessed.
what he's saying is that psychos say the darnedest things.
everything that comes out of their mouth has to be taken with a grain of salt, even if it's a confession. We'll know more after we talk to him.
and that was it.
I was done with him.
so I let him go.
you weren't concerned that he'd be able to identify you?
I knew he'd never live long enough.
I made sure of it.
all right, listen, Rodney, I'm gonna get right to it. I hate prisons.
I don't want to be here longer than I have to be. Ooh. Amen to that.
see, the truth us, we don't think you did it.
I guess it doesn't matter what you think, now, does it?
you know that boy?
maybe. Why?
we're gonna take that as a no, and you should consider decaf.
we're done here.
wait. What?
we also watched your taped confession, and that nervous knee thing you're doing.
you never stopped doing it then.
it's called a tell, Rodney, and the reason you were doing it is you were under stress and making up a lie.
but today you give the exact same confession, but that knee, it's not moving at all.
not until we showed you that picture.
no, I had pictures. I took pictures of him.
Yeah, well, that just makes you a garden variety whack job.
no way that you abducted anyone.
Rodney, we're gonna recommend that you be resentenced, but in the meantime, they're probably gonna take you out of protective custody and put you into general population.
you're gonna be a big out out there on that yard. Enjoy your day.
I did it. It was me.
wait!
just got off the phone with Morgan.
Tanner didn't take either of those boys and he doesn't have a partner. He was attention seeking.
so it's a single unsub.
Wow. A pedophile willing to go to prison just for some spotlight. Talk about desperate.
the glory of stolen thunder. The ego's a powerful motivator.
what's the status on Joshua Parker? - He's still sedated.
even if he weren't, he's in pretty bad shape mentally.
I doubt he'd be able to give us much. Excuse me, agents.
we got our street patrols doubled and the press is ready for a statement.
good. Time to get the word out. It's gonna be dark soon.
and stay tuned for an upcoming statement from local authorities and the FBI...
put the phone down, please. - I just have to send this one text.
Oh, just this one.
that was delicious. I'm gonna go return some emails before more trick-or-treaters come.
hunter, those green beans aren't gonna eat themselves.
why do you even make these things? I hate them.
because I'm your mother, and your suffering is very important to me.
mom, can I go to Katie's? - Homework done?
mostly. - Then I guess you mostly can't go.
walk Caesar, finish your homework, and then you can go.
babe, what's the Amazon password? It's my birthday.
shouldn't use your birthday as your password, you know.
it's easy to hack. It's not working!
finish up and load the dishwasher. - You said I could go meet my friends.
then you'd better hurry.
I'm coming! - Hon?
welcome back.
representatives from the FBI are warning parents to stay with their kids at all times and to trick-or-treat in groups.
extreme vigilance is the best weapon against these types of crimes.
we're advising all families with children, especially those with boys between the ages of 10 and 12, that if possible the children are out with their parents or at least an adult over the age of 18.
thank you.
home by 9: 00, young man. - Yes, ma'am!
Trick-or-treat!
sorry, guys.
what took you so long? - My stupid mom.
guys, let's just go.
let's go!
let's do some more, guys! Whoo! Let's go!
check this out, guys.
let's go! Last one! Let's do this!
ready? Ready? Last one.
let's get out of here! Let's go!
that's my house!
get over here!
damn kids.
no, no, Jess, let him have fun.
just tell him congratulations, I'm sorry I missed it, and, uh...
I'll see him as soon as I can.
OK, thanks. Bye.
Jack won best costume in school.
nice. What was he?
darth Vader. - Yes.
Henry?
Oh, all Spider-Man all day.
he told me we should be using web shooters at the FBI.
we absolutely should.
you know, all these years and I never missed a Halloween.
a couple of Easters and a Christmas and half of a birthday, but never a Halloween.
Yes, sir. Agent Hotchner.
a 12-year-old boy's gone missing.
you said on the news that one boy died?
Yes. Unfortunately the first victim didn't survive the ordeal.
but the boy who was found yesterday is expected to be all right.
all right? What happened to him?
we're not exactly sure.
but we do believe that his intention is to keep his victims alive.
those boys were missing for a year. What is he doing to them?
honey. No!
you go find my son! You get out and you find Hunter.
get out! Ann.
ma'am, I understand that this is a lot. Your son is missing as well?
what a coincidence.
do you even have kids?
mom. - Oh, baby.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here.
Mrs. Olson, Agent Callahan and I are both parents, and we understand how incredibly hard and terrifying this is.
rest assured we're doing everything we can to find Hunter.
I'm going to need your help. - What do you need us to do?
I need the names of the boys who Hunter was with tonight.
OK, uh, Jake McCauley, that's his best friend.
I'm gonna cut you loose.
but if you run, I'm gonna hit you again. Got it?
I'm gonna take this off.
and you're gonna stay quiet.
please. - I said quiet!
get in.
what? No, please.
get in.
now. - Please.
the bottle's for pee, the bucket's for poop.
spend some time down there and you might learn your lesson.
wait, no! Please, no!
please! Let me out!
please!
please, let me out!
please! Let me out!
let me out!
please, let me out!
please let me out!
I promise I won't tell anybody, ok?!
please... - Shut up.
somebody help me!
is all this really necessary?
I told you, I didn't see anything, except for those damn kids egging my house.
I gotta go to work in the morning.
well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, sir, but I'm sure the parents of the missing child don't really care, and frankly, neither do I.
you didn't see anybody else at all?
no. Just that guy.
OK.
we're canvassing the entire area. Hopefully he doesn't get far.
all right, keep us posted. - Nobody saw anything.
even if they did, it's Halloween. He could be in costume.
we could be looking for Sponge Bob for all we know.
hello over there. Share, please.
Hey, kid, speak your mind. - The transcripts.
sorry, the transcripts of the police interview with the first victim's mother, Charlotte Wilcox, I read them.
And?
Mrs. Wilcox, do you remember anything unusual about the night Tommy disappeared?
no, nothing. - Are you absolutely sure?
there's nothing. Anything might help.
I don't know. Toilet paper maybe.
sorry, ma'am? - I went to the store to buy toilet paper and when I got back I couldn't find it.
but what could that have to do with anything? Oh, god, I can't believe this is happening.
Tommy took the toilet paper. He was out TPing houses.
hunter Olson was egging houses. Joshua Parker had disciplinary problems.
bad boys all around. We should deliver the profile.
based on the details of the abduction, we believe we're looking for a white male in his mid-20s to early 30s.
he's fixated on Halloween, and we think it's probably related to a traumatic event from his childhood.
you really think he's doing all this just to punish these kids for egging houses?
it's his version of punishment, but yes.
apparently that aspect of Halloween agitates him.
we're classifying him as something called a fundamentalist vigilante.
because Halloween traditions are rooted in Christianity, there's a chance he may be some kind of religious zealot.
he releases his victims on a consistent timeline.
that says that he's mission oriented. - Let me out!
for him it's all about the punishment itself. Which is why he releases them.
what's the point of punishment if they're not gonna be around to learn their lesson?
he may be from a broken home, and we wouldn't be surprised if there were violence or abuse.
and we're fairly certain that his home life was exceedingly strict.
as a kid, it's a pretty good bet he had disciplinary issues.
and interpersonal relationships would still be a problem for him.
he's the kind of guy that would snap when rejected.
this guy needs space to do what he does. - But less than you might think.
ariel Castro held 3 women hostage in the middle of a residential area for years.
but he has to work to eat and to subsidize that space, so he most likely has a job. It would be a blue collar one he can do alone.
truck driver or night watchman, plumber, maybe even electrician.
if anyone you know fits this description, or if you have any information regarding the whereabouts of Hunter Olson, please call the FBI hotline number at the......
Hey. Garcia's going through the hotline calls. So far no leads.
agent Hotchner, there's a lady here who's insisting she talk to the FBI agent she saw on TV.
our guys tried to talk to her, but she's not taking no for an answer.
excuse me.
I'm Agent Hotchner. How can I help you?
I called the hotline, but I figured I should just come in.
I saw the news and...
I think the one who kidnapped those boys...
I'm pretty sure it's my brother.
are you and your brother close?
we're like 5 years apart, so not so much.
and plus he's always been kind of...
I don't know, a freak.
how so?
he used to lock me in closets.
or sometimes smother me.
once when I was 10, my mom smelled something out by the garbage.
and she found like 10 cats and dogs stuffed into boxes in the dumpster.
and you think your brother killed them? - He admitted it.
and laughed.
what makes you so sure that your brother is the one we should be looking for?
because the night my dad left, it was Halloween, and on the news you guys said that that was important.
what happened?
my mom was working.
but my dad, he wouldn't let us trick-or-treat.
he said all that candy would rot our teeth and make us fat.
he was kind of scary, my dad.
in what way?
he hit my mom.
us, too.
and he was super strict, yelled all the time.
and did that whole church-every-Sunday hypocrite thing.
we were always getting punished for something.
Johnny really caught it that night. You stay away from him.
you, you come here right now. - You, right now!
get over here!
you bring police to my door? I can't believe it!
Yeah, you're gonna be sorry. You stay right there.
I'll be good. I'm sorry! - Shut up!
you weren't so sorry when you were egging that house. You go to your room!
get in the trunk!
get down in that trunk!
he kept yelling he would keep him there till next Halloween to teach him a lesson.
my mom got home and lost it.
they had this huge fight.
I hid under my bed.
I woke up the next day and my dad was gone.
mom kicked him out.
Sandra, do you know where Johnny is now?
I haven't seen him in like 3 years.
my mom might.
go ahead, Garcia. - All right, John David Bidwell.
rebellious student, rebellious kid. Got picked up for vandalism.
got picked up for joyriding in a stolen car.
Wow. His mom called the cops on him a couple of times, even.
for what?
uh, police report says she wanted him removed from the premises.
but she dropped the charges both times. - Do we have a current address for him?
last one was a P. O. Box.
the IRS must be after him, too. He hasn't filed taxes in 3 years.
3 years. That's the last time he saw his sister.
so what happened 3 years ago?
Yeah, I'm looking. For the last year he's worked as a driver for a courier company.
nothing there. Hold yourself.
huh. He applied for a marriage license 3 years ago.
he was engaged to a one Charlene Taylor, who...
Oh, this is awkward. Her name's now Charlene Baker because she married someone else.
that could have been the trigger.
the rejection and rage that made him feel alone, worthless, same way as dad used to make him feel.
so why not punish father figures instead?
maybe he's trying to regain a sense of power and control by reenacting what his father did to him.
I guess we all become our parents at some point.
he's also making good on his dad's threat to keep him locked up till next Halloween.
that was 12 years ago. What was it about that night that made such a lasting imprint?
it was the night his parents split. - Garcia, have you found his dad yet?
Sam Bidwell? Negative.
they were never officially divorced, by the by. And he's completely off the grid.
all right. Keep looking. - Gotcha. On it.
Bye.
Mary Bidwell? - Yes?
I'm Agent Rossi. These are agents Hotchner and Jareau.
we're with the FBI.
we'd like to ask you a few questions about your son John David.
well, I haven't seen him.
we'd still like to ask you some questions, if you don't mind.
Yeah, come on in.
no, he couldn't have done those things.
he's a good boy. - That's not what Sandra told me.
well, she's dramatic. Always has been.
and she's no Saint, either, by the way.
when was the last time you saw him?
uh, well, it's been a few years. - How many years?
well, last time was his engagement party, so, I guess about 3.
so right before Charlene left him.
that little bitch broke his heart.
and her rich daddy thought they were too good for him.
he's a good boy.
I know my son.
he didn't do this. - Mrs. Bidwell, we know the truth about Johnny.
we know about the dead animals.
we know you had to call the police to get him out of your own house.
he's always been different, hasn't he?
isolated, not many friends.
and it got really bad when he hit puberty.
look, if it were my son, I would try to protect him, too.
I would.
but this isn't the way to keep him safe.
let me out of here!
let me out of here!
could you just keep your eyes closed?
it'll help put you in the moment.
OK. Now, do you remember anything particular about that drive home?
a lot of traffic? - No, nothing.
OK. So, you drive straight home.
then what?
then I--I go inside and I see that Sam has Johnny stuffed in a trunk.
and what did you do?
what do I do? I get him out!
this is ridiculous.
listen, Mary. It's of vital importance that we look at every detail from that night.
the key to saving Hunter Olson's life may be locked away in your memories.
but it only works if you allow it to.
well, I--I'm trying.
no, you're not. You're hiding something.
Mrs. Bidwell, we can't seem to find your ex-husband Sam anywhere.
you have any idea where he might be?
you need to tell us exactly what happened that night.
please.
just close your eyes for me again.
OK.
now, what's the first thing you remember happening that night?
I could hear the screaming before I even got in the door.
and I come in and Sam is yelling at this old trunk of his.
you're gonna stay in this trunk till next Halloween!
you hear me?! - Sam, what are you doing?
I'm talking to my son. Mom! Mom!
I'm talking to my son!
I tried to get him out, but Sam hit me.
but this time...
this time, I fought back.
what happened then, Mary?
he had his back to me.
and I picked up a fire poker...
I couldn't take it anymore.
mom! Mommy!
and then I got Johnny out of that damn trunk.
and he saw his dad lying on the floor.
you ok?
Ohh, my baby.
and then we dragged him out.
there was so much blood.
he helped me.
he's the way he is because of me.
what did you do with his body, Mary?
Mary? Mary, listen to me.
it was self-defense.
Yes, you were just protecting yourself and your kids.
but we need to know.
he's at Sam's dad's old place out by Harbison Canyon.
I buried him there.
I can hear you!
let me out of here!
I'm so, so sorry.
please! I'm sorry.
sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
shut up! - I'm sorry!
you weren't so sorry when you were egging that house.
get in there right now, you hear me? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
shut up! Shut...
let me out of here!
I want to go home!
I promise I won't tell anybody!
somebody help me!
someone!
somebody, help!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
you weren't so sorry when you were egging that house!
stop! Shut up!
show me your hands!
where is he?
you're not gonna find him.
tear this place apart.
you 3, on it.
all right...
you know we're gonna find him, don't you? - Maybe. Maybe not.
look, if you cooperate, we can put in a good word and the court may be lenient, but if you don't, we're going to do everything we can to make sure you go away for a very, very long time.
have you ever seen the inside of a prison cell, John?
it's a box.
probably not too different from the kind your dad put you in.
your father was right about you.
you don't know a damn thing about my father.
actually I do.
god-fearing, short-tempered, alcoholic.
you could never make him proud, could you?
everything you did was always wrong. Even this pathetic attempt.
he'd probably laugh at you. - Shut up.
because you're such a waste.
shut the hell up. - And obviously not very smart.
yeah? I'm smart enough to know where that kid is at.
he should have left you in that box.
you're not worth my time.
mom?
Hi, baby.
what are you doing here? - Baby, you need to tell them where that little boy is.
no.
you tell them.
you know this is wrong.
that little boy doesn't deserve this, any more than you did.
he's just like you were, Johnny.
innocent.
I'm so sorry I couldn't stop it.
I know I should have left him.
but I was too scared and I couldn't.
and I am so sorry.
what I did to your dad...
I wish I could take it back.
but I need you to be brave now and save this little boy.
I made it bad enough, Johnny.
don't make it any worse.
get a paramedic over here. Send the ambulance!
get a paramedic!
go! Find the car!
you guys, come to this side.
back up, Dave.
I got a pulse!
I got him.
Oh, my God!
Oh, buddy. - Oh, honey.
Oh...God.
can I say good-bye to him?
off course, JJ.
OK, Mary.
you can't blame yourself.
you can't.
will you stay Mom.
dad.
how'd it go?
uh, good. Where's Jack? He's not in his room.
you didn't see him on the couch? He tried waiting up for you and he fell asleep.
I just left him there because he wanted to make sure you saw him in his costume.
always kiss your children good night, even if they're already asleep.
H. Jackson Brown, Jr.

Lucille Wagner! - Pop?

did you practice your speech? - I almost have it.
Lucy, how's it gonna look if the valedictorian messes up her speech?
okay.
don't wrinkle your robe. Just ironed it for ya.
okay, big day! Come on! See ya on deck! Let's go!
toads do look like frogs.
it's just one's, you know, in the water and one's not.
it doesn't-- It could happen to anybody.
Hey, Mimi! I know you want me.
ho!
I'm gonna look drop-dead gorgeous.
you should see my dress.
Hello! Watch where you're going! - You ran into me, Kit.
what, you're too perfect to bump into anybody?
what? - Perfect.
sweet, proper...
nerdy and virginal.
I'm not-- - You're a virgin.
I told.
just get us in the picture, okay? Hold my purse.
no, don't push the button. Wait till I get over there. Honey!
mama, what are you doing? - One second. Stand up straight.
I am. I will. - Tuck your tummy in.
smile. - Mom, I'm smiling!
bigger, darling.
Lucy, your speech was wonderful. - Thank you.
I hope you're gonna continue studying music in college.
actually, Lucy wants to become a doctor.
voice classes would make nice electives.
no time. We're looking at a double major in biology and chemistry...
if she wants to get into the best med school, huh?
Henry, I'll show you how to start that truck for tonight.
all right. See you later.
Bye, Ms. J. - Good luck, Henry.
I'm all he's got, you know?
congratulations, Lucy.
thank you. Thanks.
here it is. Honey, what's wrong?
I'm fiine.
pop, I worked really hard to be the valedictorian.
course you did.
why didn't it feel like anything?
what do you mean, you didn't feel anything? It felt great!
pop, I never went to one football game.
you don't like football.
but you're supposed to go, and it's supposed to be fun.
and like all the parties at Hemmings Field and stuff...
I never went to any of'em.
I never stayed out late. I never just hung out.
'cause you had a head on your shoulders.
you stayed home, and you studied.
there's just a lot of things that I wanted to do that I didn't.
and I was up there getting my diploma, and I was like...
is this it?
come on now. Didn't we both work hard for this?
you're right.
I guess it's just the pressure of graduation. You're right.
girls, hi!
Lucy.
Mimi, not now. Okay?
are you coming or not? - Coming where?
it's graduation night!
Oh, God, Hemmings Field. I totally forgot.
so, are you coming or not?
I have plans. I'm sorry.
come on. You okay?
do you want something?
Yeah. Are you coming at midnight or what?
excuse me?
kit, we made a pact, remember?
Oh, you're not serious!
well, look, you can really go without me.
I have better things to do than dig up some old box.
standing here looking at all the world
the guitar guy is such a hottie.
that's Ben Kimble.
I heard he just got out of jail. Killed a guy.
I don't believe you.
Yeah! Everybody's talking about it.
Oh, too bad!
well, if anyone could have him, it'd be you.
but I'm off the market, remember?
Oh, please! Dylan's at UCLA doing...
God knows what with God knows who.
that's not true.
right.
whatever.
are you ready? - Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.
okay, hold on.
Henry, are you ready?
Henry, are you ready?
I'm ready.
that's okay. Go on.
why are you stopping?
this isn't how I hoped it would be.
that's weird, 'cause this is exactly how I hoped it would be...
or pretty accurate.
maybe if we get into bed. - That's a good idea.
these are nice sheets.
can I hear the list again? - Oh, Luce, come on.
please, please. Just one more time.
Thanks.
all right.
reason number one:
we've been lab partners for three years so we really trust each other.
that's really important. Okay. - Trust is very important.
reason number two: We are both 18 and have never done it.
very important!
reason number three:
we both want to do it.
reason number four
please, Lucy, come on. Please.
I'm, I'm begging you. Please, let's just do it.
okay, yeah, we can do it. - Yeah?
okay, so let's
I'll go this way. - Okay, I'm going this way.
let's do this.
please don't laugh. You're killing this.
your fiirst time should be special. - Yeah, this is special!
listen, do you want to spend the rest of your life...
knowing that you did it for the fiirst time with your lab partner?
Yes, yes, I do. And I'll tell you why.
because you know what it's like for a guy to go to college a virgin?
no, I'm telling you they, they
they're ostracized! They treat them like lepers!
I'm sorry.
what's up, Mimi? How's the fetus? - Drop dead.
is it mine or what? - I can't believe we went out.
I'm trying to do the right thing. - Yeah? What's the right thing?
ignoring me for the past fiive months?
letting your friends call me a ho? Spreading rumors?
I'm repeating what I heard, that you let some guy...
do you in his car over Christmas break.
jerk.
it's ten paces on the other side.
what are you doing here? - Where's Lucy?
she's not coming.
you have a flashlight? Good. - Gimme back my flashlight!
let's just get this over with, okay?
God, I don't even remember what we put in here.
me either.
here, hold this for a second, Lucy.
my Bridal Barbie!
she was my wish.
you're getting your wish. - I know.
Lucy, I think this is yours.
my locket. - What did you wish for?
I wanted to find my mom.
did you ever fiind her?
no, she lives in Arizona and my pop doesn't think it's a good idea, so
what did you wish for?
a key chain? - No, the world.
that I was gonna get out of this crappy town...
go all the way to California...
put my feet in the Pacifiic Ocean.
there's a wish that's not coming true for a while.
a lot you know, Kit. - What's that supposed to mean?
slide Records recording contest?
so? - So I'm going on Sunday.
you're going to California to audition for a record company?
Yeah. - You're pregnant.
so? I'll wear something slimming. - And what?
you think you're gonna become this big, fat, pregnant star?
I have a pretty good voice. - How are you gonna get there?
I found a ride with this guy. - What? No, that is crazy.
you can't go to Los Angeles by yourself with some guy.
so? Then come with me. I'll sing lead, and you can sing backups.
it's not something we should do. - It's stupid is what it is.
okay, fiine. You know what?
you can just forget all your past!
Oh, wow.
Oh, my goodness. Look at us! - Let me see.
I was so chubby. - Singing.
I have to go meet my friends. - Yeah, it's getting late.
Yeah.
Hey, you guys.
I'm leaving Sunday at 7: 00 a. m. if you all wanna come.
what do you mean you're not coming home for the summer?
Dylan, listen to me, you have to come home.
Because! I haven't seen you since Christmas.
don't you miss me?
excuse me. - Dad, customer!
Dylan, we have to plan the wedding.
all right.
I love you-- Dylan?
Hey, darling. - Hey, Pop.
Dr. Johnson called today. Good news.
got me a job at the hospital?
all those discounts I gave him finally paid off.
cool. - Yep.
can I ask you a question?
it's about Mother.
has she ever tried to see me? - No, she hasn't.
I was thinking, maybe she's afraid to visit me.
Luce, you do not have to feel any guilt about your mother leaving us.
this is not about us.
she was the one who walked out on a three-year-old.
she's the one that should feel guilty. All right?
all right.
nobody brings four suitcases on a road trip.
look, Dylan asked me to go see him in LA...
and I can't get there looking like a skank.
you better hope it all fiits.
it will, okay?
I'm not going to the audition. You can drop me off in Arizona.
fine. - Fine.
fine. Shotgun. - Yeah, right. I'm sitting up front.
you must be Lucy.
Yeah.
so you're taking us to L. A?
Yeah. I'll get your bag.

I saw a sign for a Hilton back there.

I can't believe you only brought $40.
I have expenses. I had to have my homecoming dress custom-made.
I was voted queen, you know.
Oh, my dream come true.

how far you'll drive each day? Which towns you'll stop in?
how much gas money you'll need?

it's gonna be tight.
Oh, my gosh.
it's a love room.
Oh, man!
look at the walls!
I'm not sleeping here! - This is what we can afford.
is this run by the hour? I'm not sleeping here.
where you gonna sleep? - I don't know.
this place is disgusting. I'll take this bed.
so how come you're going to L. A?
my uncle might have a job for me there...
so I'm gonna check it out and if I like it, I'll move there.
what about your band? Don't you have a band?
no, I was just filling in the other night. I don't have a band.
Mimi said that she didn't think you'd come with us on the trip.
neither did I.
you sorry you did?
not so far.
well, good night.
good night.
Hey! It's freaking cold!
we're in here. - I'm in here.
I just need to brush my teeth.
what are you doing? - You're so touchy.
Mimi, how do you know Ben?
just from around. - Gosh, don't you think he's cute?
he's all right. - I can't believe he was in jail.
what? - Yeah!
he like killed a guy. What? That's what I heard.
excuse me? He killed somebody?
no, he did not kill anybody-- I don't think.
okay, he had a car, he was coming to L. A. Don't be upset.
I'm on a road trip with a killer and you're telling me not to be upset?
he'll hear you. - Oh, my God.
what's up?
do you know him at all?
he used to hang out with some of the guys at the trailer park.
so he may have killed someone, okay?
so what? He did his time. He paid his debt to society.
Oh, my God.
ready to go?
Yeah.
Hey, you wanna ride up front with me today?
no, that's okay. The backseat's fiine. It's okay.
I'll check us out, okay? - Yeah.
I'll be back. - I'll come with ya.

will you please get me some chips? - No, Mimi.
open the door.
I'll get my own chips.
you all, wait for me!
so when he came home last Christmas, he proposed.
he's coming home as soon as he's done with school next spring.
you're seriously gonna marry that loser?
you don't even know him.
what's wrong? - Nothing. It just kicked, is all.
can I feel it? - If you want.
it kicked again.
what about Kurt? - What about Kurt?
he's the father, isn't he? - Yes, Kurt's the father.
but it wasn't working out, so I dumped him.
you're gonna raise this baby all by yourself?
I'm gonna go wait in the car with Ben, all right?
that's so typical of her.
she's not thinking about her future. How's she gonna get by with a baby?
well, she brought this upon herself.
what?
hello. - Hi, Pop.
sneaking away in the middle of the night?
l'm very upset with you. Dr. Johnson went to a great deal of trouble to get you that job.
I'm sorry, okay? - Sorry?
you are coming back now! And you will regard that as a command!
you're usually so levelheaded...
and you pull a stunt like this, l am so surprised at you.
you worked so hard. Are you gonna start slacking off now?
what are you writing there?
stuff.
are you mad at me or something?
why would I be mad at you? I don't even know you.
No! - Oh, no, it sounds bad.
look at all that smoke.
what's wrong with it, Ben?
it's the head gasket, I think.
give me your shirt. - Here.
Whoa! What are you doing?
nobody touches this except for specialists and myself.
because it's an antique and I don't want people to
it's your radiator. - No, it's the head gasket.
no, your radiator's cracked. What year it this? '73.
Oh, that's like 350, plus labor.
great! Great!
I'm hungry.
how long does it take to get a tow truck?
Ben's only been gone two hours. - I'm so hungry.
won't you stop saying that? We heard you. You're hungry.
so what?
we don't have $350. Even if he gets a tow truck...
we don't have enough money to get the car fiixed.
I'm gonna be stuck here in-- Where the hell am I? Where am I?
Louisiana.
stuck in some butt-hole town, Louisiana.
I am never gonna get to LA to see Dylan.
he's gonna be so upset.
whatever.
excuse me?
could you be more self-centered?
you're just jealous. - What?
I'm not blind. I know how girls like you looked at me in school.
you would've given anything to trade places with me.
girls like me?
I can't help it if I'm popular, so just lay off.
girls like me?
I didn't make the rules, Mimi. It's not my fault...
everyone thinks you're a trailer-trash skeeze.
stop it! - Don't touch me like that!
guys, don't! - You're pregnant!
you're a redneck!
girls! Mimi! Stop!
stop it! Stop! I'm so sick of the two of you...
bitching and fiighting every damn second of the day!
for once, would you just shut up?
I don't know why the hell I asked the two of you to come on this trip.
we don't belong together.
this was a mistake, okay?
I'm sorry, partner, that's the best I can do.
it's a cracked radiator.
he said he'd get it ready by tomorrow.
how will we get the money to pay for it?
I have an idea.
I'm gonna call my father and have him come get me.
you're leaving?
this trip's over.
wait, I have an idea!
you know what? I'm sick of your ideas, Mimi.
I should've known you'd make a mess of this trip.
fine, run home to your daddy, but don't try and blame this on me.
Lucy, I haven't asked you for anything in a really long time.
but I'm gonna ask you to stay.
please hang up the damn phone and just stay with us!
come on, Lucy.
Hello?
I do. I have a really good idea.
Yeah, it better be good.
okay, I have something to say.
I know we're not all getting along, but tonight's important.
we really need the money.
so could we just be civil and get through this? Okay?
okay.
all right! You all ready?
Yeah.
that's cute. - Thank you.
wait.
it's all the tips we can get, right?
Mm-hmm. - So?
if we wanna put on a show, we have to be sexy.
now you're talking.
whatcha got? - Let me wear those feathers.
all right, next contestant's a brand-new act.
and for all tourists that don't know how the rules go in my club...
here it is, plain and simple.
you're the judge. If you hate them, tell them.
if you like them, pay them.
we got baskets going around. Put the money in there.
be loud, be fair and be generous if you like what you hear.
so, come on, give them a warm welcome.
they look young. - It's past their bedtime.
l saw him dancing there by the record machine
get off the stage!
Mimi, come on! - I can't do it.
you can do it. - I thought so, but I can't.
please do it for me. - You just gotta go do it.
no, you do it. - I don't know if I can.
you've got the best voice. Come on, please for me.
okay, okay. - Thank you.
you okay? - No.
l saw him dancing there by the record machine l knew he must have been about 17
the beat was going strong

it's so amazing.
Lucy, come here.
how much is it? - Enough for the car and the trip.
perfect.
you wanna come dance with us?
no. We should get outta here before somebody realizes you're underage.
come on, just a little bit longer, please?
all right, you go ahead. - Thank you.
Hey, she with you? - What?
is she your girl?
no.
Yeah. Watch this.
move your hands, please.
we're gonna get a little freaky. Hey, what's up, baby? Come on.
what's wrong? - Will you stop it?
excuse me. Hey, I don't think she wants to dance.
I think she does. You should mind your own business.
will you leave me alone? - Excuse me. I'm talking to you.
my nose!
let's go.
Oh, damn!
is this living or what?
there's a mini-bar!
you all, you could swim in this bathtub!
listen, I'm
I'm not mad at you for what happened there. Okay?
there's bathrobes!
where are you going? -Just going out.
are any of you guys tired, 'cause it's 3: 00 a. m. and I'm wired!
who wants some of mama's punch? - Me, please.
Madame. - Madame.
go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!
what are you doing?
you go, girl!
I have seen one, you all.
Yeah, but have you touched one?
she has! Give us the details!
it's always the quiet ones.
say it loud. Say you touched one and you're proud!
Lucy touched one! She did!
okay, the best thing that ever happened to you.
that's easy. - What?
reaching my goal weight.
third year at fat camp, the summer before eighth grade.
wait, that camp you went to every summer was a fat camp?
Yes, and I loved it.
for two months...
my mama wasn't around to pick on me for being fat.
being fat is just unacceptable to her.
okay. The worst thing that ever happened to you.
that's even easier. Reaching my goal weight.
you said-- - It turns out that being prettier than my mama is even more unacceptable.
Oh, Jesus.
Yep.
one morning I woke up, and she was gone.
pop really wouldn't say anything about it.
I thought she was coming back, and Pop told me she wasn't.
they fought all the time.
you know, I think that she just got fed up...
and took off without even thinking.
and after a while, it was just too late to come back.
I know she wants to see me.
she's just scared, that's all.
I'm gonna be so sick later.
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant and you couldn't act stupid with us.
that's not why I don't drink. I just don't see the point in it.
so you never partied?
once.
over Christmas.
there was one of those parties at Hemmings Field.
and this guy was drinking this beer...
and I remember it was in a blue bottle.
and I was real mad at Kurt because...
he blew me off again to hang out with his friends.
so I had a few beers.
I had more than a few.
this guy, you know, he seemed-- He seemed real nice...
'cause when I couldn't walk, he offered to drive me home.
it's no big deal, Luce. It happens to girls all the time.
did you go to the police?
no.
I'm from a trailer park. I got drunk and got in his car.
so, Kurt's not the father?
I saw this ad in a magazine.
so I called up this lawyer in Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.
um, all these pictures and letters of all these people who want babies.
I was supposed to pick one. - The guy...
what was his name?
I don't know.
why did we stop being friends?
I don't know. People drift apart.
promise me we won't drift apart again.
come here.
and where have you been all night?
thank you.
for what you did last night, I mean.
Thanks.
scoot over.
I'm never drinking again. Honest.
this burrito is so good.
don't mention food.
what are you doing? - Chilling.
wake him up. - You all, he's been driving all day.
we can't just stay here. - We should just let him sleep.
Uh-uh. - We'll let him sleep.
Lucy, get his keys.
he told us we couldn't drive his car. I can't do that.
why not? It's not like we're gonna drive this over a cliff.
it's stupid to stay here. - I'll drive.
get his keys.
Yeah, get his keys. - Why do I have to get his keys?
because Kit and I voted and you lost.
get the keys.
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.
this is stealing. - It's not stealing if he's in the car.
no, it's kidnapping.
okay, stop.
Oh, I got it.
go, go.
you failed driver's ed, didn't you?
maybe.
move over. - Oh, God.
guys, smile for the camera.
go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.
let's go, girls l'm going out tonight and l'm feeling all right l'm gonna let it all hang out
wanna make some noise Really raise my voice
wanna make some noise Really raise my voice
Yeah, l'm gonna scream and shout
get a little outta line l ain't gonna act politically correct l only wanna have a good time
the best thing about being a woman ls the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh, oh, oh Go totally crazy - Hi! Did you have a good nap? - Yeah.
stop, stop the car.
don't be mad. You looked so sweet when you were sleeping.
we just didn't wanna wake you. - Stop the car.
it's against the law to park here. - It's my car.
we're almost at an exit. - Stop the damn car!
Mimi, go talk to him. - Uh-uh, you go talk to him.
nobody's gonna go talk to him. - I know, he's mad.
and he has killed before.
Mimi, you said he didn't kill anyone.
I said I thought he didn't. - Oh, my God.
it's okay, I'll go. - I'm sorry.
God!
be careful, Lucy.
we're sorry. - I've been in a car full of chicks.
do you have any idea what it's like being surrounded by girls?
being a girl yourself, I know, stupid question.
but I'm a guy, okay? I'm a guy. Just a guy.
and I have been listening to girl talk and watching you do your girl things for days.
I'm not complaining, 'cause, let's face it, I'm outnumbered.
but that's my car.
it's my car, and it's just
it's the one thing that hasn't been taken over by chicks.
okay? - Okay.
Ben? - Yeah?
were you really in jail?
Yeah, I was.
so you killed a guy? - What?
who said I killed a guy?
everybody back home.
Oh, man. No, I didn't kill a guy.
what did you do then?
I was in college, and I get this call from my stepsister.
she wants me to come get her 'cause my stepdad is beating her up.
my mom can't stop him, so...
I drive home in the middle of the night...
and she throws her things out the window and climbs out...
and then I drive her back to school in Ohio with me.
and you went to jail for that? - That's the thing.
there's this law against driving a child that's not a relative across state lines...
and my stepdad of course pressed charges.
but, you know, it's okay. I only got six months...
and I had to stay in Ohio for a year's probation.
my sister got to go live with her mom.
you all really thought I killed a guy?
Yeah.
what were you thinking getting into a car with a homicidal maniac?
why are we stopping? - You'll see.
Mimi, you okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm fiine.
look.
it's like you have to whisper.
Hello!
man. We gotta make time. The next hotel is still an hour away.
Ben, do you have enough sleeping bags for all of us?
you serious?
you really want to camp here?
Yeah.
it sounds like fun.
you gotta keep your thumb on the outside like this.
right. Now, the trick is...
you don't want to let him know that you're gonna hit him.
maybe like look away fiirst.
and then, when he least expects it, you throw your whole body into it.
what are you doing to her?
I'm teaching her how to fiight because every girl...
should know how to throw a decent punch.
that was decent.
I'm gonna go to bed.
I'm gonna go to the ladies room. Where is it again?
third bush after the rock over there.
this one? - That one, yeah.
what are you always writing in there?
poems, mostly.
can I hear one?
okay. One. But you can't laugh.
I used to think I had the answers to everything...
but now I know that life doesn't always go my way.
it feels like I'm caught in the middle, and that's when I realize...
that I'm not a girl, and not yet a woman.
all I need is time, just a moment that's mine.
and while I'm in between, I'm not a girl. "
I liked it.
Really?
Yeah, really, I like it.
what? - You got ash on your face.
where? - I'll get it.
there.
what's wrong? - What happened?
something bit my ass.
let me see. - It's a snake bite.
no, Mimi, that's a mosquito bite.
don't look!
how could I not? It's nothing. - But it could've been a snake.
all right! We are outta here at the crack of dawn.
nothing's biting my ass.
so we'll be in Tucson today?
around 4: 00, I think. - Are you nervous?
should I call and tell her I'm coming, or should I just show up?
I should just show up, right? - Surprise is always better.
she's gonna be real happy to see you.
l hope so.
you'll call and tell me everything about the audition, right?
you could still come with us. -We don't leave town until tomorrow.
I'll be fiine, okay?
you know where we're staying if you need us.
Bye.
Thanks. - Yeah.
I guess this is it.
I guess, yeah.
what?
good luck. - Thanks.
can I help you?
it's me, Mama-- Lucy.
come in.
you have a really nice house.
thank you, Lucy.
Tucson seems like a really nice city.
it is.
can I ask you why you're here, Lucy?
can I ask you why you're here, Lucy?
I wanted to see you.
and why was that, Lucy?
well, you're my mother.
why do you keep saying my name like that?
hold on a moment.
Hello?
sweetie, tell Joey's mommy I said you could swim for another hour...
if you put on more sunscreen.
I don't want you to burn.
daddy will pick you up at 5: 00. I love you.
I have brothers? - Well, yes.

Yeah, I saw her. - And what happened?

Thanks. - Yeah.
I'm fiine.
I'm okay.
I know.
really, I'm okay.
what happened?
she said...
that she never wanted me.
she said that my father made her have me...
and that I was just a mistake.
I look like her, you know?
I have her eyes and her hands.
it's her loss, Luce.
it's weird though, you know?
I don't have a mother.
well, you have us.
Yeah.
trying to call your dad?
I can't. I will in a minute.
you got that poem you read me?
Yeah. - Can I see it?
Yeah, sure.
it's right here.
what are you doing?
stop worrying so much. Come on. I made you something.
okay.
this is my surprise?
wouldn't it be sad if it was?
like if I just totally sucked at cheering people up.
I wrote some music for your poem.
will you play it for me?
will you sing?
just use this part as the chorus.
Yeah. - Like that?
go my way Like that?

Yeah. From school. Right, Mimi?

Oh. Well, aren't you gonna invite us in?
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I've got this friend here, and he's
you know, he's really upset, and we're supposed to, like...
you know, hang out or whatever.
do you need money for the pizza?
your friend sounds really upset. - Wait, Kit, hold on.
Oh, God. - Who's she?
we're supposed to be getting married.
we're supposed to be getting married.
I was-- I was gonna tell you, I just, you know...
didn't want to do it over the phone.
Dylan, you gave me a ring.
you proposed and gave me a ring!
kit, I mean, I'm sorry, you know?
Oh, my God.
it was Dylan, wasn't it?
it was you. You were the guy at Christmas.
wasn't it? It was him, huh? - What are you talking about?
that night when you came over, you had that rip in your shirt.
that was the night that he-- - Kit, what is your problem here?
kit, I have to go. - No, Mimi, come back here.
I want him to admit it. Admit it!
you're getting all worked up over nothing, Kitty-Kat.
my name is not Kitty-Kat. I am not your pet!
Hello?
excuse me, where's the phone? - It's right over there.
Yeah, can I make a collect call, please?
they said I lost the baby.
'lost it. "
like it was my keys or something.
isn't that the stupidest damn thing you've ever heard?
I'd decided to keep her.
I was standing on the beach...
and my toes were in the Pacifiic Ocean...
and she kicked.
it was like this sign.
don't touch me, Luce. I'm already crying.
okay.
I would have made a good mom.
just what were you thinking, running away...
with a pregnant girl!
Lucy, I'm waiting for an answer.
do you know what it took to come here?
I had to take cash out of savings for plane fare and hotel.
I worked hard to earn that money for your college education.
I'm sorry.
so you made a mistake. I understand.
everybody makes mistakes. You're forgiven.
I'm gonna take you girls back to where you belong...
and we'll forget about this whole crazy thing, all right?
okay.
who's that boy you were with?
how old is he anyway? Is he the one who put the crazy idea in your head?
he just gave us a ride.
that's all.
Hey, sorry it took me so long. We got a band.
what are you doing? - Packing.
my father says I have to move to his hotel, so
until the audition? How are we gonna rehearse?
I'm not going to the audition.
look, I have to go back with him, okay?
Ben, he's my father, okay?
I just can't
and with everything happening with Mimi, I just think I should go.
no, I get it. - Don't be like that.
I get it. It's okay.
it's fine.
did you see how fast he went down?
it's 'cause you threw your body into that punch, like I taught you.
you did really good.
Hey, come here.
thank you.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
it's not your fault.
got it?
I can't believe this trip is over.
I know. God, doesn't it feel like we left home a million years ago?
Yeah.
Hey, you all, thanks. - For what?
for coming on this trip with me. Thank you.
Mimi and I were talking...
and we were thinking
that you need to stay and go to the audition.
guys, I can't do that.
I can't. - You've got to.
kit and I voted, and you lost, so you've got to go.
all right, baby, ready to head home?
I'm coming. - Ladies...
let's roll.
come on, let's go.
we tried.
here you go, buddy.
thank you, sir. - I'll take that, sweetie.
good-bye, Lucy.
good-bye.
it's gonna feel good to get back home, won't it?
look, honey...
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I wasn't angry at you. I was angry at what you did.
okay? - Okay.
I don't want to be like her.
we'll just get back home, and everything'll be back to normal.
you just wait and see.
don't make me do what she did.
don't make me run. Just let me go, okay?
what are you
l used to think l had the answers to everything
but now l know
that life doesn't always
go my way
yeah
feels like l'm caught in the middle
that's when l realize l'm not a girl
not yet a woman
all l need is time
a moment that is mine
while l'm in between l'm not a girl
there is no need to protect me lt's time that l learned to face up to this
on my own l've seen so much more than you know now
so don't tell me to shut my eyes
but if you look at me closely
you will see it in my eyes
this girl will always find
her way l'm not a girl Don't tell me what to believe l'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
my baby!
this time, we didn't make any wishes for the future.
we said good-bye to our past.
now, none of us has any idea where life's gonna take us...
'cause what we have is now.
and right now, we have each other.
let's do this thing! - Action!
do it.
do it.
mommy?
I thought that you were sleeping at Lindsay's house?
what are you doing?
you're not supposed to be here right now, Rachel.
what should we do?
what should we do?
the time is now.
Hey, buddy, you all right? What's up?
need an ambulance, hey?
Hey, Gina, you know cpr, right?
got to get over here. The old man needs some help.
Yeah, I wouldn't turn my back on prophet, mick.
you should have called that ambulance. Looks like you're gonna need it.
why am I always the last to know who's hooking up around here?
good afternoon, Miss G.
I'm feeling the burn.
Yeah, well, I've spent the last two days in the head of a sadistic serial rapist for the milwaukee p. d.
in that case, don't forget to breathe.
I wouldn't go in there. - Why?
coop is on a private call.
with Fickler.
Ooh, the director.
california vs. Veronica day.
she's up for appeal again? - Worse.
her lawyer filed for a motion for a new trial based on my profiling work for the case.
your profile?
she influenced three separate teenage boys to slaughter their own parents.
the only person she ever actually hurt herself was her own mother, years earlier.
what's the mistrial issue?
there have been two other copycat crimes, boys killing their own parents and leaving the exact same message, during the ten years that she has been on death row "the time is now."
Yeah, but that came out at trial.
that's no secret. Everybody knows that.
everybody in the public knows that message.
well, I used the word "unique" in 2001 in reference to her signature.
her lawyer feels that these more recent crimes proves that she's anything but and requires a mistrial.
and he has finally found a judge who is willing to entertain his argument.
along with all the facts in the original prosecution, the court has requested general testimony on profiling from someone other than me, someone who can explain how it works and who has no skin in the game.
and you thought of me?
wouldn't Aaron Hotchner be a better choice for you?
look, sam, I know you lead a red cell, and you sometimes fly way under the radar, but you are a fine representative of profiling.
you have a commendable record.
there is no one I would rather have on the stand explaining what it is the b. a.u. Does.
I see. Hotch couldn't make it?
no. He's in central florida on a case.
look, you You only have to show that our current profiling methods would still uphold veronica's conviction.
I'll be on the plane in an hour.
Thanks, Sam.
I haven't done anything yet.
at least it's warm here, right?
warm where?
Los angeles.
when are we going?
you're not.
it's just me and the director this time.
what's happening?
you're the senior agent.
I'm leaving the team in your hands.
Oh, they're not gonna be comfortable with that.
you'll get used to it.
I don't know if I want to get used to them getting used to it. - Good luck.
okay.
is she the reason you're going to l. a?
Veronica day. Yeah.
later. - Be safe.
what should we do?
I can't remember the last time I saw you in a suit.
that's a good thing.
Andy? This is Sam Cooper, the agent I told you about.
you have quite a reputation, agent cooper.
please, call me sam. - Andy Armus.
Andy took over Veronica's case for the state five years ago, handled her endless appeals.
no one knows the case better than he.
well, I hope I can help. - I know you will.
what can you tell me about this judge Nunes, other than her clear disdain for profiling?
she's a bit of a wild card, likes to keep things interesting.
well, when it comes to the law, I don't like interesting.
none of us do, pal.
Mr. Lampl, what brings you back to court for Veronica day?
we're all here to redress an egregious miscarriage of justice.
that's leon lampl.
leon's been Veronica's lawyer since day one.
he's not cheap.
no, but as long as cameras show up, so will leon.
Hey, Gordon Ramirez. I don't believe it.
I heard you had retired.
Yeah. What am I gonna do, Fick, go fishing?
Sam Cooper.
nice to meet the man who convicted veronica day.
Oh, you know the case?
of course. Great work, great work.
can you believe that she's arguing for a new trial?
it's ludicrous.
how's the new guy doing?
well, he's been on the job for five years.
I wouldn't exactly call him a new guy anymore.
but if it were going well, you wouldn't be here now, would you?
she never looks nervous.
subjects like her never do.
everyone please be seated.
court is now in session.
the honorable judge Nunes presiding.
good morning.
I have here mr. Lampl's motion for a new trial on behalf of Miss Day.
the state moves to dismiss the motion.
or we wouldn't be here.
I see we have here the current fbi director, Mr. Fickler.
good morning, judge.
you testified in the original trial that the defendant had something your behavioral-analysis unit refers to as a "unique signature." Is that correct?
Yes, um, every crime scene had the exact same combination of m. o.
and ritual present.
except for when she allegedly murdered her mother.
a crime the state was never able to link to my client - through ballistics or forensics. - Leon.
director?
forensics and ballistics do not attract us to a crime scene.
we look to behavior. - Such as?
Veronica stalked her birth mother.
she insinuated herself into her mother's life.
she also hid her own identity so she couldn't be named after the murder.
now, this level of premeditation was also present in the murders she orchestrated in 2001.
so we asked ourselves, why Veronica would use other people to kill, why the unsub couldn't pull the trigger herself, why she needed to prey on these boys?
all of this painted a picture for the B. A.U.
of a disturbed, manipulative killer who fed on control.
now, your honor, I am entirely confident that my profile on Miss Day would still hold true now.
we also have one of the B. A.U.'s top profilers in the field here to back the director's testimony
agent Samuel Cooper.
Yes, we're familiar with agent cooper's rather interesting record.
what's available of it, anyway.
aside from several disciplinary actions, there seems to be a few years missing.
excuse me.
uh, that is a matter of national security, your honor.
your honor can see an expunged war record of a star witness raises some concerns.
all agent Cooper can provide us with is more of the B. A.U.'s faulty analysis.
the state sold Jack Fickler's guesses to the jury...
regarding the murders.
but, in fact, all they have is junk science.
junk science?
I have signed affidavits from two jurors that state that their decision to vote guilty was based almost solely on Mr. Fickler's testimony.
now, if that testimony is false, then my client does not deserve to be in prison at all, let alone on death row.
your honor, we see this time and again with death-row inmates.
the defense wants to seize on a single word to undo Jack Fickler's testimony.
believe me, your honor, one word is not enough.
while I greatly appreciate your instructions to this court on what is and isn't enough,
I think I'll go ahead and schedule a hearing and try to decide for myself.
I'll hear arguments this week.
what do you need for the hearing?
well, they're gonna want to know more about your testimony.
and they'll ask agent Cooper what process you used to arrive at your opinions.
if you need anything else, don't hesitate.
we are here until Veronica's firmly replanted on death row.
I need to get back to my office to prep.
justice never sleeps, right?
"justice never sleeps"? That sounds like a comic book.
what? What's wrong?
the defense attorney he seems extremely confident, don't you think?
guys like him make a living being overconfident.
it's not just that.
in court, he said...
if your testimony proves false, not "unsupported," not "inappropriate,"
false..." Like there was a lie.
well, I didn't lie, if that's what you're asking.
I've never perjured myself, ever.
so if that's what Lampl is counting on, this will be a very short trip.
what? What's up?
you don't have a desk.
what do you call this?
a table.
Yes, but it functions as a desk.
you put a computer on it. There's files.
Yeah, but there's no personalization
I mean, none of your stuff.
why do I need personal stuff?
you know, prophet's right.
I mean, what kind of person doesn't have any stuff?
are you profiling me?
I mean, you kind of are always ready to get out as quickly as possible.
you know what, Beth?
you profile just like a fugitive.
look, ready to abandon someplace at a moment's notice.
Yeah, I bet you she's got a suitcase at the ready too.
Yeah, look at her run. - Go on, beth.
see those people out there working out ?
they don't ask any questions.
in fact, they barely even acknowledge that I exist, and that's fantastic.
Hello, darling. No, I was just leaving.
Oh, listen, I have to cancel this weekend.
I got to work on the Veronica Day case.
no, you can still take him.
Ah, Ben won't care either way.
no. What?
Hello? Hello? I'm losing you. Oh, crap.
I can handle a court case or a threat analysis, but to handle both at the same time, I need my "A" team.
a team is right. - Here you go.
conflicted as I am to be compared to a marginally entertaining '80s TV show, what would you like us to do?
why are you asking me?
cause you're the boss.
I have a job to do here, Beth.
I need to study the Day case for the hearing tomorrow.
you are in charge of threat analysis here.
okay, I just thought that was while you were away.
it was while I was on this, and I still am.
understood. Got it.
Beth in charge. Way to go, boss.
you don't need to call me that.
it doesn't matter what I call you. You're pretty much the boss.
have you heard from Mick and Gina?
are you changing the subject? - I am.
nice. They're at the crime scene.
okay, get an update, please, and then we'll get set up in here.
Yes, ma'am.
vandalism is primarily a male act.
breaking a window takes aggression. There was no rock or anything heavy left behind.
so the unsub brought something with him.
and he brought a modified newspaper and paint for the hood.
that's a lot of preplanning.
so Armus walks towards the car from this direction.
he's facing the driver's side, and if this window had been smashed, he never would have got in.
he would have seen it, and he would have gone for help.
and he wouldn't have seen the hood from there.
the unsub wanted him to get as close as possible before seeing the threat.
aside from the courthouse elevator, the most obvious way in is by car.
but I did find a maintenance door on the second floor. The lock had been jimmied.
so he came by foot. He brought tools.
he could get in, and he could get out without being detected.
he's been here before.
we've had two other boys that have sat exactly where you're sitting.
you're not special to her.
Peter, you do not have to protect her.
Veronica didn't kill them.
I did.
couldn't break him. I couldn't break any of them.
so Veronica Day has a radar for damaged people.
well, that's a pretty good description, yeah.
but on the outside of that, these kids are model citizens.
they got good grades. They're well liked.
they're on their way to college.
Yeah, which is how Veronica fit in.
she was charming and kind and a pretty girl who could make parents trust her.
Yeah, but we know that was an illusion.
well, she's actually pretty fascinating.
given up at birth, she bounced around foster care until she was 14, arrested as a runaway at 17.
so when she was out on the street, that's where she tracked down her birth mother?
she took a bus to Sacramento. Her birth mother was a waitress.
she lied about her age, got hired as a dishwasher at the same diner.
a few weeks later, mom turned up dead.
shotgun to the head, just like all the other murders.
Yeah, only this time, she actually pulled the trigger
the only time.
I testified that mom's murder was the first step in Veronica developing her signature.
Oh, so the mom's murder was a cold case.
you were investigating Veronica, and her background brought that around.
the state decided that there was enough evidence to link the Oswalt, lidge, and Madison murders.
and Veronica was tried for all of them together.
how many times did you interview Veronica?
four...
no, um, five, five separate incidents.
was it four, or was it five? Six, seven?
five 46 hours total.
it's on tape and in the files, Sam.
why do I get the feeling i'm being challenged here?
I have to understand how you, uh, built this profile, see if there was something I would do differently.
by differently, you mean better?
I'm not saying that.
we have to be absolutely sure that we're right, because veronica's attorney is absolutely sure that we're wrong.
what's this unsub trying to gain?
Veronica Day's freedom?
why not wait till after the hearing?
is this really helping her?
as you know, threats are not actions.
they're designed to inflict fear and uncertainty in a victim.
from what I understand, this Armus guy is anything but scared, though.
that would make the unsub angry.
angry enough to try something else.
sure. Something personal.
I need Armus' phone number, please.
this is Armus. - Hello, Mr. Armus.
this is federal agent Beth Griffith.
yes?
my team and I have been asked by agent Cooper to investigate the threats made against you.
Oh, you mean the vandalism on my car?
Yes, sir. You don't consider that a threat?
some phrase a moron used that some other moron wrote on a crime scene wall ten years ago?
no, I don't consider that a threat.
well, we consider that there's at least a possibility of an escalation.
I categorically disagree.
we would like to place a security detail on your home.
absolutely not.
I'm not gonna drag my wife and my son into this and scare the hell out of them for nothing.
good-bye.
he hung up on me. - Why?
he doesn't think he's in any danger.
based on what?
apparently he gets threatened all the time and something about peeing in his pants.
as far as I can tell, you gave the same profile that I would have.
that's comforting.
it's clear.
she, uh, was recreating her mother's murder over and over and over. - Right.
so why do I get the feeling that you're not satisfied with this, Sam?
I was actually hoping that there was something wrong with this profile.
why don't you enlighten me?
uh, where are you going with this?
you seem to be getting lost in your own head.
there's something missing. I can feel it.
it's not about your work. - It is about my work.
my profile is being called into question here, and I need your support.
I thought you wanted me to review the files.
I didn't know you wanted me to come to some predetermined conclusion for you.
Oh, come on, sam. You know what I'm talking about.
I see the big picture.
I can see how it all fits.
I understand you got a lot at stake here. But there's something.
I can't quite touch it yet, but it's there, and it's waiting for me to find it.
the big picture that you need to focus on is that I am no longer a profiler.
it is your way of life that is at stake here.
so figure this out, or you may be looking for a new home.
Oh, my god! Oh, no.
I'm-I'm-I'm calm. Okay.
What-what's happened? Check Ben!
I'll call the fbi.
cut the lights. Keep circling the block.
if this guy's watching us, I don't want him to see us overreacting.
good. Got to keep him from feeding off the fear that he created here.
the unsub came in through the back door.
he raked the deadbolt.
pretty low tech, but you'd have to have the right tools.
I mean, it's nothing you couldn't find on the internet.
keep this place locked up. - You got it.
the time is now.
the techs confirm the blood isn't even human. It's animal.
so he's mutilating pets?
or he's a hunter or got it from a butcher shop.
so the unsub walks all the way in here to where his intended target is sleeping and does what?
he makes a threat.
why wouldn't he kill them when he had the chance, though?
perhaps he's not a killer, not yet, anyway.
what do I do?
I mean, do I back off the case?
another prosecutor would just take it over.
doesn't this guy realize that?
this guy-it doesn't matter about rationality.
he's so focused on scaring you that he doesn't know where he's gonna go next.
this makes it difficult for us to anticipate his next move.
may we now place your family in protective custody?
agent lasalle will remain here and confer with the l. a.p. d. Officers on patrol.
agent Rawson will coordinate your transportation to and from the courthouse.
wait. What about my school visit?
we'll just have to try to reschedule it.
they could give away my spot if I don't show up this weekend.
if they do, they didn't want you bad enough to start with, kid.
it's a lot to process.
I know that, and I'm sorry, but at this point, we can't take any risks.
anything we have to do to protect my family, let's do it.
Hello, Veronica.
they said you were an early riser.
apparently I'm not the only one.
I get up at 4: 00 a. m. Every morning. I like to feel the sunrise.
you look really nice.
you look like you don't usually wear a suit.
well, we all look different in court
the bad guys, the good guys.
it's like no crime was ever committed or an arrest ever made by anyone wearing jeans.
you mind if I talk to you?
I don't.
but my lawyer might.
he's a very confident man, your lawyer.
that about sums him up.
makes me a little nervous.
that's refreshingly honest.
no point in pretending.
you're probably a better profiler than I'll ever be.
you think so?
those boys, they all had these vulnerabilities that they were hiding from everyone, but you saw them.
I see a lot of things.
speaking of which, how are you and the director getting along?
I thought I noticed some vibes there.
that's funny, a girl like you always puts ripples in a family.
is that right?
that sounds dangerously close to something leon should be here for.
well, I'm not gonna talk to you about any of the murders at all.
so this is a social visit?
not exactly, no.
then what is it you do want, agent Cooper?
did you ever tell her?
tell who what?
when you were working at the diner...
did you ever tell your mother who you were?
you know nothing about my mother.
I mean, you traveled all that way on your own.
you were just this little girl. - Get out of here.
how did it feel? - Shut up.
how did it feel to meet the woman that just gave you away?
leave me alone!
get out of here!
okay, it's all right. It's all right.
this is my fault.
this is my fault. She'll be fine when I leave.
I'll see you in court.
samuel Cooper, how early is it on the west coast?
I just got in myself and have yet to even inject caffeine.
I need you to get into Veronica Day's case files.
I thought they already sent you everything you needed.
not the bureau files, the original files, the case reports, the trial prep...
all the things that we didn't see.
okay, what are you looking for?
Veronica got completely upset when I brought up her birth mother's murder.
she was cold about everything else, but when I brought that up, she got almost...
almost protective.
so you want me to focus on the original murder?
exclusively.
and, Penelope, we do not have a lot of time.
a hopeless case with no time
that's my specialty.
all right ， call me when you get something, okay?
you ever wear one of these?
you really think it's necessary?
I think it'll go better with that suit than a bullet hole.
excuse me. Director Fickler?
yes?
you don't remember me.
Oh, my god.
it's, uh, Peter Lidge's little sister, Rachel.
look at you. You're all grown up.
she won't actually get this new trial, right?
well, we will do everything in our power to make sure that that doesn't happen.
I need more than that.
I need to know that Veronica will finally pay for what she did to my family.
that's what we all want.
thank you.
Veronica day suffers from narcissistic personality disorder.
her lack of empathy and delusions of grandeur result in an inflated sense of self-importance.
this isn't a hearing about my client's mental state.
stick with the original b. a.u. Testimony, Mr. Armus.
that's what's being called into question here.
with all due respect, your honor, Jack Fickler's profiling of this case was...
and remains irrefutable.
I'm not convinced the actions were unique, agent Cooper.
they've been copycatted many times since.
the shootings, yes.
but the signature, no.
no other combination of m. o.
or ritual is identical to veronica's.
Veronica developed her signature as a way of keeping control...
of people, of situations, of time itself.
and this is all a reaction to the one time that she lost control.
you're referring to the murder of Veronica's birth mother?
objection.
if agent Cooper's going to talk about loss of control,
I think it's only fair to discuss his own.
how out of control were you when you were off the bureau's radar?
objection. Objection, your honor.
you can question all the things that I've done as an agent, but my life is not why we're here today, because
I have tried to make amends for the things that I've done, taken responsibility.
but, Veronica, have you?
have you taken responsibility for the death of your mother?
I didn't kill my mother. - That's enough, Miss Day!
you're a liar!
tell your client to pull herself together, Leon.
15-minute recess.
what do you get?
uh, Veronica Day was actually convicted of killing her mother, right?
it's the only time she killed by her own hands.
according to whom?
according to whom? According to the prosecution team.
it's the basis of our entire profile.
Yeah, there may be a problem with that.
you don't recall?
you don't recall a statement from a state trooper or you never saw it?
look, I had thousands of pages of case documents for the trial.
you think I'm gonna remember one line item on a single evidence list?
the only exculpatory evidence?
the one statement that may still exonerate Veronica of her mother's murder?
Yeah, I expect you should recall that one.
I just talked to the state trooper.
he said that he faxed that statement directly to you in '96.
but it never made its way into trial evidence.
neighbor heard a loud bang "and then spotted a dark-haired Caucasian male "fleeing the building on 8th street, "where Jennifer Conroy's body was then discovered in the stairwell.
look, what that report doesn't say is that the witness in question was halfway through a handle of beam.
now, maybe she saw a man. Maybe it was a woman.
maybe it was a horse on roller skates.
she was completely, drunkenly unreliable.
unreliable because the statement went against the case that you built, the case that you let me testify to.
I swore under oath that Veronica killed her birth mother.
come on, Jack.
you know how hard it is to convict someone of murder when they've never actually murdered anyone?
what? - My god.
Gordon, it is supposed to be difficult to put someone to death.
you suppressed evidence deliberately in a death-penalty case.
I'm duty bound to present this to the judge.
it was a worthless statement.
that's not your call.
it never was.
and here she comes.
Veronica, how does it feel to be free?
I want to take this opportunity to thank the fbi.
their tireless work and dedication are the reason I'm standing here now.
so, thank you, agents Cooper and director Fickler, for setting me free.
Veronica Day thanking the same people who put her behind bars nearly ten years ago.
a very dangerous woman has just walked out the door, and it's my fault.
you were lied to by Ramirez.
all right, how did I miss it?
I don't know. - What does that mean？
that you never would have made the same mistake?
she's free? - Rachel.
she can't be free. - I am very, very sorry.
how - how can this happen?
the only murder that she was actually convicted of was her mother's, and new evidence
her mother? What about my mother?
what about my father?
you know your brother wouldn't say that it was her.
all right? None of the boys would talk.
none of them would betray her.
I'll say she did it.
I'll say she told Peter to shoot them, that-that I heard her say it.
but you didn't.
I can say that I just remembered it, that-that there was post-traumatic stress.
put me on the stand. - Rachel.
she can't get away with this.
perjury is a crime. - I don't care.
look, we will find a way to get her back into custody, but not like this.
we are not risking you going to jail yourself.
how can you let this happen?
if Veronica hurts someone else, I'll never forgive myself.
where do you think she's going?
I don't know.
I don't understand. She's just free?
I can't believe this.
wait. You can figure out your strategy here, Andy.
please, just come home.
because there's a lunatic on the loose who's threatened our family, and I don't know-I thought you might choose your wife and son over your work just this once, but I guess that's just too much to ask.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
no, it's fine. We're here now.
and we're gonna keep you safe.
I'm gonna check on Ben.
you gonna call Cooper? - Yes. He's must be devastated.
Oh, my god, his backpack's missing, his shoes.
he's gone. Ben's gone.
we've got to figure out what Veronica's next move is.
wait. What is this?
it's a letter from Peter Lidge.
it says she wouldn't be in prison if he had killed his sister Rachel that night.
I think she's going after Rachel.
Hi, Rachel.
remember me?
Rachel, come here. - She confessed.
she confessed? - She told me everything
how she convinced my brother that my parents hated him.
she helped my brother get the gun.
she said it was all her idea.
is that enough to convict her?
I needed to tell Rachel that I was responsible.
Yeah, that's enough.
your parents were supposed to bring you here, right?
well, it is parents' orientation weekend.
I want to come here in the fall.
do you know what sound irks me more than any other sound in the whole world?
the beeping of a pager...
those old school pdas.
it was a little electronic box that was always beeping my father away from things that were far more important than me.
he was a doctor.
actually, he was a world-renowned neurosurgeon.
and the difficulty in that is, you can't complain that he's not there for you when what he's doing is operating on people's brains.
so what did you do?
I'm embarrassed to admit I had a bit of a bad-girl phase.
I would do anything to get him to notice me, just to focus.
and one time, he caught me in the garage smashing his pager into a thousand pieces.
needless to say, it never beeped again.
I never did write on the wall in pig's blood, though.
I'll give you that. It has a certain panache.
how'd you know?
you didn't hide the receipt from the butcher's.
you wanted us to know. You wanted him to know.
well, what happens now?
it depends upon whether your father wants to press charges or not.
do you think he would?
I think your mother's gonna intervene, but we have to talk about counseling.
and that's what you did? You went to counseling?
I did.
and when my father was pushing me to go to medical school,
I told him I wanted to be a civil servant.
I wanted to work for the government.
you really fought back. - Yes.
just like art school. - Sure, but without the color.
the fbi is seriously...
gray upon gray upon gray upon gray.
look at us.
in our natural habitats.
natural costumes, anyway.
I like you better in that.
thank you.
it'd be weird for you to say the same, but it's true.
this is the costume that fits.
is that why you confessed to Rachel...
cause you think you belong here?
I belong on death row for what I did.
I caused a lot of people to be hurt...
and families destroyed.
but not your mother.
I never hurt her.
I wouldn't.
I wanted to know her.
"the time is now..."
that's about...
not telling her when you had the chance, right?
I was going to.
I was working up to it.
someone took her away again from you.
so I guess I didn't want anyone else to have a happy family.
that's the profile, right?
that's part of it.
the other part takes into account who you are right now.
who's that?
a young woman who wants to get redemption for something she did when she was a little girl.
someone who needs to see that...
the one part of herself that's good is the part that's been seeking forgiveness all this time.
I'm gonna reopen the investigation to find your mother's killer.
we've got some strong leads...
really.
I will see you later,
see you.
what happened? - Nothing.
why do you look like you used my toothbrush to clean the toilet?
did you?
if you're gonna be the boss sometimes, you might as well have an actual desk.
this is the first time I've ever seen you not know what to say, Beth.
it's just
just -just say, "thank you, man."
thank you, man.
you gonna move some stuff in now?
what is it with you and stuff?
I don't know. You could have, like, a photograph or maybe, you know, a nice green plant.
how is a plant "stuff"?
Oh, just take the plant. - Okay. Thank you.
you clean your toilet with a toothbrush?
okay.
run.
go ahead, Penelope.
a few hours ago, two campers reported a monster stumbling onto their campsite.
first responders found a dead man with half of his face obliterated.
what do local cops think happened to him?
local cops would be us,'cause this is where it happened.
Quantico.
more specifically, Lunga lake.
it's a 1, 000-acre park open only to military personnel and d. o.d. Families.
the unsub reach the Quantico perimeter?
Quantico's 200 square miles.
it's not fenced in like camp David.
you got the national park...
he may not have even known he was even there.
okay, so Quantico is right here.
who's the victim?
a marine.
member of the family.
his name is sergeant David Clayford.
attacked while camping in a one-man tent.
alive for more than a day after the attack with the left side of his face hanging in pieces.
how could this happen in our house?
a brutal assault like this and no one has any idea what happened to him?
no. No other crime scene related. They think it could be an isolated incident.
but Coop, this happened a mile from where I park my car.
Mick and Prophet, we're going to the crime scene.
Beth, you're gonna go with Gina to the morgue.
she's at her sister's swearing-in ceremony.
judges, generals, the fbi-That family scares me.
all right, guys. Let's go.
look. Sergeant clayford's blood trail leads back here.
it looks like he was attacked in his tent.
master sergeant strathmore, Sam Cooper.
thanks for holding down the site for us.
no thanks needed, sir.
on base, we're taking this personally.
as am i.
I hear you were embedded with a marine corp unit in Afghanistan.
today I'm just here as special agent Sam Cooper of the fbi.
well, you're definitely the guy I want running point on this thing, sir.
sergeant Clayford was field camping.
traveling light.
not much to see.
you'd be surprised. He's a skilled camper.
set up a tent in a good position.
the ground would drain easily if it rained.
it's facing east. Sunrise would be his wake-up call.
so how does someone sneak up on a seasoned camper and trained marine?
Clayford did two tours, right? - Yes, sir.
maybe he had some form of post-traumatic stress disorder.
lot of guys come back, need to take something to be able to sleep.
it's common.
maybe he's medicated.
let's play this out.
he's asleep. Possibly unarmed.
makes sense. He's on friendly turf.
the unsub would approach from the east.
under the cover of darkness.
so he'd have a light source - A flashlight, maybe.
but he managed to get to the tent undetected.
then he blitz attacks.
why didn't clayford fight back?
cheap chloroform.
the unsub must've used the chloroform to subdue him.
then, once he's unconscious, he slices clayford's skin.
clayford's left half-dead. With half his face...
falling off the skull.
a hero's final battle.
this is sergeant clayford.
and I have to warn you- - It's all right.
thank you.
three ripping fissures, originating from behind the left jawline.
continuing on 30-degree tears of six inches to the mouth, eight inches across the bridge of the nose, and thoroughly evacuating the left eye socket.
just below the left ear is a puncture wound.
he lived a full day after this.
it's amazing he lived so long. I mean, it must've been excruciating.
well, he was a marine.
in the initial trauma, the carotid was nicked.
the force of the blunt instrument cracked the skull on both temples.
so he's bleeding out while his brain was hemorrhaging.
and what kind of instrument was used in the attack?
it must've been a hammer of some sort.
Non-metal. A mallet, maybe. Wooden or plastic.
his face has just been torn apart here on the side.
Yeah.
there's no burn or powder marks. It's like his face burst from within.
the skin can stretch six times its elasticity before it ruptures.
and these puncture wounds suggest an injection site.
can you take tissue samples?
see what and how it was injected. - Yes, ma'am.
so there was an earlier victim?
Yeah. I opened the crime scene radius per your request, and ten days ago...
some hikers found the body of Amy Sherigan.
she was a 17-year-old runaway.
her body was found in prince William park, adjacent to quantico.
she had been living in a makeshift campsite in the backcountry part of the park.
her body was super decomposed.
Ugh. I hate this part of my job.
the forensic report says her face was badly mutilated, her lips, ears, and eyes had been removed, and the mouth cavity emptied.
now that could be post-mortem scavenging.
I mean, buzzards, creatures - The woods are full.
and razor-sharp removal of the left post-auricular and supra-clavicular skin.
behind the left ear, jaw, and the neck areas
same area our unsub attacked david clayford.
are there any signs of sexual assault?
no. Bless her heart, she was alive for a few hours after the attack.
coroner report says the initial attack was with a hammer.
same hammer that was used with david clayford.
okay, so we've got a lot of rubber mallets in construction, especially wood-working and bending sheet metal.
stonemasons back home, they're always shoring up walls with wooden mallets so as not to break the rock.
all right, so our unsub was probably a man.
a tradesman of some sort.
he's handy with his tools.
and the knock-out cloth...
the knock-out cloth that he used was a worker's rag bought in bulk.
which was impossible for us to trace.
Beth and Gina said that David Clayford was injected with some kind of gas.
slaughterhouses.
hunters dressing their kill.
they take a compressed air gun, they stick a needle into the hide of a goat or a cow...
and it separates the skin from the muscle, making it easier to skin.
so our unsub, all he would have needed was a needle, a hose, and a portable tank of air.
that's a lot of equipment to lug around in the woods.
well, it shows that he was intent on skinning his victim, but he failed.
he literally butchered the first victim with a knife.
the air gun ruined the skin of the second attempt.
you know what's interesting?
all the victims died.
but it's not as if he set out to kill them.
it's as if
it's as if he's fixated on their living tissue.
to what end?
I mean, what is he gonna do with the skin? - I don't know.
I mean, cannibals, they usually can't resist sampling their prey at the kill site, but there's no evidence of that here.
I mean, despite the drastic mutilations, all the skin is accounted for.
he obliterated the faces of the first two victims.
we don't know why.
we know that if he's not getting the results that he wants that he's gonna keep doing it until he does.
we gotta dig deep.
I know this might be hard for you, but it could really help us find your brother's killer.
anything.
I gave him that jetboil stove for christmas.
boils a pint of water in less than a minute.
it's not a cheap unit.
what is it you want me to do?
we can get a better understanding of your brother through his belongings.
that's his bag.
his mat.
his tent.
does your brother have a hard time sleeping?
he taking any meds for it?
Yeah.
since he got back from his last tour, he had a hard time sleeping indoors.
he preferred to sleep outside on the ground.
that's not his cooler.
you sure? - Yeah.
he was proud of being a spartan camper.
take only pictures, leave only footprints.
he wouldn't have taken a cooler camping.
okay.
okay, so the cooler's clean.
he didn't use it.
plastic's hardened from the dry ice.
all right, so if we calculate how long it takes for this dry ice to melt, we'll get a time and a travel radius to and from that crime scene.
Why's he leave the cooler behind?
something spooked him.
there's confusion...
the unsub's attack, it went awry...
so he drops the cooler, making a run for it.
maybe he brought the cooler in the hopes that he could take the skin after he removed it.
it looks like David Clayford was a very unfortunate experiment in skin harvesting.
maybe he's making a suit of skin, like Ed Gein.
he's focusing on the left side of the face.
and the cooler, it's small.
he's trying to get small pieces, not use large sections of skin.
maybe he's trying to fix himself. I mean, he could be disfigured.
you know, trying to change his appearance.
Yeah, but then he'd be autografting sections from his skin onto his body.
Heterografts are from one person to another.
sometimes burn units use pig skin, but it's only temporary.
all right, so if he's taking skin for heterografts, he'll need somebody else involved.
I promised. Hold still.
Rangers found her staggering along the loop.
tasers in her back, left side of her face sheared off.
Cindy. I'm agent Cooper with the fbi
she doesn't remember much, and she's on the table in five minutes.
I understand, but I have to speak to her right now.
how bad is it?
you're gonna be all right, okay?
you're gonna be all right. - What do you remember?
I was running, and then pain in my back.
and a man...
in a sweatshirt. - Did he speak to you?
he said,"you have such pretty skin.
okay, this is gonna have to wait.
what else do you know about this guy?
she's been traumatized, Coop. She's barely conscious, okay?
I know, I know. Cindy, I'm sorry.
but could you just stay with me just a little bit longer?
when he was cutting, he said that he'd promised...
but it hurt, it hurt so much when he was cutting.
the unsub tells the victim that he promised...
which implies some sort of commitment to someone.
the motivation is emotional.
he's doing this for someone that he loves.
if he was practicing his harvesting techniques on clayford and he failed, then he was successful with cindy.
I mean, he sheared off a thin layer of her face and he took it with him.
high risk of taking another person in broad daylight.
it shows us that he's desperate towards his goal.
attacking this girl... I mean, it means he's collecting skin for a young woman.
a daughter or a wife.
a girlfriend? - Could be.
I have a question for the plastic surgeon.
honey, I know what I promised.
it's still two days until your birthday, I have time.
please don't cry.
no. You can't take this off! Not until I fix it.
daddy's gotta go to the garage. - Please don't go.
it's for you, honey. It's your surprise.
somebody's got a big birthday coming.
sweet 16.
you haven't messed with the window, have you? - No.
no one can see in...
or out.
there's nothing to see out there.
the world is an ugly place, Kristi.
believe me, I know.
zero.
even with an autograft?
whoever took this girl's face won't have graft able material.
it's extremely difficult to prepare skin for travel, even under the best conditions.
what about a heterograft?
could that be successful? Transferring the skin of strangers?
infection, graft rejection, et cetera, the chances are less than zero.
what do you mean less than zero? - Death.
sorry, ladies. - Thank you.
so if this unsub is attempting to transplant...
no matter what he tries, that skin is not going to travel.
okay, so he comes to this realization.
would he be deluded enough to kidnap a donor and attempt a person-to-person transfer?
he might.
uh, sir, just a simple "happy birthday" on the cake?
happy birthday, Kristi Anna.
a- n-n-a. We'll have it ready for you tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I was trying to make a call.
I pressed the wrong button. Yeah, anna, how you spelled it.
you have very pretty skin.
judging by the compression and bruising of the interior capillaries, the trauma happened quickly.
so I did some more extensive sampling of the tissue in the same area and found this.
tiny microns of debris inserted in the tissue during the delivery process.
refuse mixed in with the compressed air?
right. - What was the refuse?
particles of paint.
so when the unsub charged the air gun, the intake sucked in particles of wherever he was at the time.
exactly. - Where was he?
it's not the where, it's the what.
what kind of paint was used?
puce.
kind of brownish purple.
Industrial? Artist's?
I mean, you gotta give me more than just "paint.
was he painting houses? Was he painting pictures of houses?
was there something else in the tissue sample?
did you check for mold or metal filings?
I'll have it tested further. - Okay, great.
it's just we need to be very thorough.
Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.
so the unsub thinks he has the talent.
the ability to take skin and remake someone's face.
and judging by the age of the last victim, odds are it's a girl.
could be disfigured.
not necessarily.
if he is delusional, she just has to fall short of his standard of beauty.
she's whatever she's been told she is.
Yes, much like advertising. That's how they get you, isn't it?
undercutting your self-esteem.
you can never be too pretty or too thin.
you know, at my sister's swearing in, my father referred to her as the smart one.
I assume that makes you "the pretty one.
he doesn't even realize what he's saying.
he just always thought that was enough for me.
he's shocked when I achieve anything.
well, his thinking may be why you overachieve.
no. His type of thinking is that I don't have what it takes for this job and that he's expecting me to fail.
you need to call him and tell him he's wrong.
my father's never been wrong a day in his life, Beth.
delusions are as necessary to this man's motivation as reality.
so if he thinks that he can perform a transplant, then that's what he's gonna try to do.
if we're looking at the skin, we might well look at the means toward the end.
the stitchery skill that would be necessary to perform such an operation.
is it at all possible that the unsub could be a highly proficient tailor?
I don't know.
he's certainly confident on some level of his fine motor abilities.
taxidermist.
a taxidermist might use an air compression gun in filleting animals.
he'd be proficient in sewing skins and hides.
that's not bad.
Yeah.
can you run a check on local taxidermists?
taxidermists, huh?
we're taking some names in the radius of the crimes.
they tend to live in secluded areas, some of them hunt out-of-season, and supplement with illegal foreign animal skin trades.
any with propensity for violence?
uh, let me see...
what about this guy?
emory Boyd, he runs Todd's taxidermy.
it's just outside of dale city.
okay, let me see.
so that has gotta be...
that's five miles from the park.
man of the woods, prone to violence, he was suspected last year of attacking a game warden.
Oh, get this. A few months ago, he went up into the smoky mountains armed with only a knife to kill a bear.
he was seriously mauled, broke his arm, face is a wreck.
he recently put his shop up for sale and no one's seen him for weeks.
it's worth an interview. - Let's ride.
Oh, this is the place? Doesn't look like anyone's home.
eh, I've seen a taxidermy shop in the back of a beauty parlor back home.
Oh, great.
sounds like a lovely place you come from there, down south.
should we call for backup?
looks like it's just one guy with a shotgun.
let's take him then.
Where's Coop?
I got him.
okay, fire high into the top of the door.
when coop has the guy subdued, we storm the place.
he said all that? - Yeah.
he'll subdue the guy?
we've been in this spot before.
just watch and fire high.
now.
go, go!
watch the arm, damn it!
compound fracture. Early gangrene.
set it myself. - Good for you.
now get off it. - Look for the girl.
Hey, don't go in there.
go, go.
wait.
guess you don't have a lot of gray timber wolves back there in wales. Do you, brother?
Congratulations.
you just shot up a $3, 500 trophy-mounted gray timber wolf.
you just took a shot at the wrong people.
check the rest of the house.
sit down!
we're with the fbi. - Fbi?
thought you were a friend of mine, drives the same truck.
that's the way you treat your friends?
he tried to rip me off of some bear skins and gallbladders.
a lot of money in that.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say will- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
do you understand me? - Just take me to jail.
Oh, I would if I could.
I gotta take you to a hospital first.
place is clear. There's no one here, Coop.
of course not. I'm an army of one.
he ain't the guy, Coop.
all right.
let's call Carcia.
tell her we need some roadside assistance.
we're gonna have to wait here for a while.
Oh, my god.
what?
what is this?
Oh, my god.
look, if the unsub is attempting a facial transplant, the recipient has to know that somebody else's life is at stake.
maybe not. It could cost both their lives.
and to her, perhaps it's preferable to suffer physically rather than risk the loss of someone's affection.
that could explain the relationship between the unsub and the secondary victim or patient.
Husband-wife, brother-sister.- No, no, no, the unsub is a man.
it is way too easy to manipulate the emotions of a young girl.
believe me. It's father-daughter.
okay. I'll run it by Sam.
are you all right?
you know Cindy's in for a lifetime. A lifetime of painful skin grafts.
it isn't her arm, it isn't her leg, it is her face.
I just hope that she has the support and the strength to come back from something like that.
I can't believe what you did.
what do you mean, Kristi?
is that what you do? Kill things out there?
what things? Where?
that baby pig.
did you kill it?
you went into my workshop when I told you not to.
what did you do to my specimens?
I threw it all away.
you have no idea what you've done.
were you torturing those little animals? - no.
I'm learning things. I'm learning how things work.
it's hard to understand but I am trying to learn something that will make things better for us.
haven't I taken good care of you?
Yes. - What you saw scared you.
and I understand.
being in this house all alone while I'm at work.
but you've gotta remember, you got a big birthday coming!
the government has put way too many animals on the endangered list.
you got many takers for this skin stitchery class?
not many. Money's too tight for hobbies.
Yeah, well, anybody stick out in your mind, though?
a lady wanted to stuff her pet cat.
always get a couple of those. - Anybody else?
one guy wanted to barter painting a room of the place for a lesson.
Beth and Gina found paint in David Clayford's tissue samples.
what else you know about this guy?
he wanted to know where he could get some live pigs.
little ones. Piglets, you know?
makes perfect sense.
if he was thinking about experimenting, he'd do it with animals first.
desensitize himself to the cruelty, then he could practice his methods.
on pigs? - Their skin is similar to ours.
remember the guy's name?
Kevin, Melvin Something, I don't know.
car's here.
did this guy tell you why he wanted to use these pigs?
he wouldn't. Weird. - Weird?
you fought a bear, dude. Let's go.
uh, glad I caught you.
we're pretty closed. Everything's all put away.
the cake, it's for tonight. A surprise party. - I'm not allowed to reopen the register.
I could write you a check. Please?
my daughter's gonna be so disappointed. It's her 16th birthday.
well, I'm just on the inscription, I haven't put on any of the decorations.
that's fine.
Yeah. I kinda need it now.
I'll bring it out to you.
Kristi Anna, right? - Right.
let's not bruise that pretty, pretty skin.
what do you got, officer?
we think this girl may have been taken by the unsub.
dawn Taggert, 17. Didn't come home for supper.
father came down, found the back door open, called us.
the police found the same kind of taser wire used on the jogger. - Tasers again.
he's striking less aggressively now'cause he doesn't wanna damage the skin on their faces.
here's a photo of the kidnapped girl from the employees' wall.
unfortunately, that pristine complexion makes her an ideal donor candidate.
he solved the problem of transporting skin by kidnapping live tissue.
dawn must've been the perfect target-Same skin, same age, same tone.
is it safe to assume this is what the unsub's daughter looks like?
possibly. At some point.
but if he attempts the transplant, they could both end up disfigured.
they might not even survive.
ma'am?
I'm Gina lasalle with the fbi, this is agent Griffith. - Hi.
he didn't open the register. The only thing missing is dawn.
all right, I'd like you to check special orders against pickup and payment, if you don't mind.
there's a cake missing. A birthday cake.
do you know who ordered it? - A Mr. Smith.
there was a special inscription, though.
happy birthday to kristi anna." It's an odd spelling.
can I take a look?
four victims.
the first, he uses a knife and butchers the skin.
leaves empty-handed. - With the second victim, he switches to the compressed air gun. But he screws that up, too.
he even leaves the cooler behind. - Third victim, he goes back to some sort of knife.
gets a sample intact, but it's useless within the hour.
in all three cases, he leaves the victims to die.
the guy's indifferent to their suffering.
he's numb. He's desperate.
the logical next step is to kidnap living tissue.
no matter what the risk. No matter what the cost of life.
dawn Taggert, perfect skin, goes missing.
everybody all right?
Yeah, lucky for us, our guy was a bad shot.
Mick went all rambo on a stuffed animal, though.
okay, we think we're looking for a father harvesting skin for his disfigured daughter.
possible name is kristi anna.
twisted sense of parental love.
love poisoned by guilt.
you know what, we're looking at this all wrong.
maybe this is just a normal guy who is driven by guilt into a hell where he's trying to fix his daughter.
whoever the unsub is, and however she's been disfigured, he has done this to her himself.
Yes. - So whose hell is worse?
his or hers?
excuse me.
what's going on?
I mean, suppose he's using her disfigurement...
a disfigurement that he caused to keep her prisoner?
all right, so we'll find her, we'll free her, - and we'll bring him to justice. - That's just it.
okay, so we arrest him.
and his hell is over. We've put him out of his misery. But hers?
it's forever, Coop.
they're both under a cloak of darkness.
Gina, both of them. - Sam...
your amazing ability to have empathy for these guys is what makes you so good at catching them.
but I'm not like you. I- I-I don't...
I don't think everyone has a light. I think some people are born into darkness just as much as I believe in straight-up good and straight-up evil.
and who taught you that?
my parents. My mother. - Yeah?
fine, my father. - Exactly.
I've been having this argument with him for 20 years. I know it.
and now you sound just like him. There's something else.
your father is angry at me for offering you this job in the first place.
so don't make me wish I didn't.
that's great, so now I'm a disappointment for you too.
of course not.
and you won't be. I just need you to respect my methods.
I can be challenged as your mentor or your teacher, even as your friend.
but not as your father. We're clear on that?
Yeah, we're clear.
good. Let's get to work.
happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday, Kristi Anna. Happy birthday to you. Okay, Kristi. Make a wish.
but I know what it's gonna be.
I don't know about this.
what are you gonna do to her?
come on, now.
blow out your candles.
daddy, let her go. Please, dad.
the candles are burning down.
now I made a promise, and I keep my promise.
blow out your candles so that you can make a wish.
happy birthday, baby girl.
dad? I'm happy with the way I look.
I'll make you happier.
Kristi, believe me. I know.
please don't do this. Please don't hurt her.
the mask doesn't bother me at all. Really.
it bothers you. Trust me.
we're looking for a man who's got a daughter named Kristi Anna.
that's Kristi with a "k." K- r-i-s-t-i.
and the daughter's birthday is gonna fall within a 72-hour window of today.
also, Penelope, the daughter probably has a fair complexion, if that helps.
there's gonna be some history of abuse.
either spousal or with children.
I'm searching, i'm searching...
B. t.w.this girl's name is a great filter.
Yeah, unless they're using aliases. - Point well made, friend.
the father could be using a fictitious last name.
okay, up until four years ago, I have a Kelvin Sharpenburger.
42, series of abuse charges against him. He beat his wife one too many times, so she left him and took their daughter, Kristi Anna, with her.
that's our guy.
wait, wait, no, I'm sorry. What did you say?
did you say that the wife took the daughter?
Yeah, but then he kidnapped the daughter and disappeared, until he showed up drunk one night at a walk-in e. r. Clinic, saying the daughter had fallen into a fireplace.
then little girl tells the nurse what really happened was that the father held her face really close to a wood stove, saying she reminded him of his wife.
Ugh, hospital called the police, but he took the daughter before they got there.
you got a photo of this Kristi Anna?
uh... I've got a fifth grade school photo.
after that, she was in and out of a bunch of schools.
mostly truant. I'll send this to you, though.
how old is she now?
actually, she's 16 today.
all right, so he's gonna live in a rural setting, where the daughter not going to school won't attract any attention at all.
he's concerned with appearances and attention to detail.
what about one of those specialty painters?
you know, like, the guys who do the stenciling in the houses.
that's it. They use these custom knives to carve out their stencils
air compressor. Compressed air to airbrush the paint.
Penelope... Stencil painters.
I've got him. Kelvin Cornwell.
he's the only stencil painter in 30 miles. Custom interiors.
Highway 12, just outside of Dale city.
18 months ago rented a house, according to utility bills.
okay, Penelope, send that to our p. d.a. s.We're out the door.
daddy, no, please. I - I don't, I don't...I don't want this.
I promised you that I would fix things by your 16th birthday.
and I keep my promises.
didn't I say that I would never drink again after that night?
didn't I?
you can't hurt someone else, dad.
we're way too late for that, Kristi.
I have done nothing for the last four years but think about this moment, waiting for the time that I can make you beautiful again.
no. - Don't say no to me.
I'm sorry.
stop fighting me. You think I like doing this?
I do this all for you, and this is how you act?
you could show me a little gratitude and respect.
now, let's get this over with.
go! Go!
get your hands in the air.
give me your hands. - Beth, take care of the girl.
got it.
over here. On your knees. - You're gonna be all right.
you're safe now.
it's all right. Kristi anna.
we know all about it. - You're safe now, okay?
let us help you.
medic.
Kristi! - Just want to make sure that you're all right.
No!
don't.
it's too terrible for anyone to see.
whatever is hiding behind the mask, you need medical attention.
he was gonna operate on that girl and give me her face, wasn't he?
Yeah, but we got him, Kristi.
how could he do that to her? How could she live without her face?
because you're his daughter.
and some fathers will do anything for their children.
take my hand, okay?
Hey. You're okay. Okay?
and we're gonna let the medic look at your face, okay?
no.
everyone out.
you too, Coop.
I'm gonna leave you with the- - No.
I'm- - Please stay.
don't let go of my hand.
you are so brave. You can do this.
okay?
it's okay.
how bad is it?
there is nothing wrong with you.
you have a beautiful face.
no. I don't. - Yes, you do.
that's impossible.
dad gave me ointments and creams, I put them on my face every day.
your face healed.
Kristi, you are beautiful.
I don't believe you. - Do you have a mirror?
okay, I want you to take a look at your face, okay?
I can't. I
it's okay. Hey.
it's okay.
I know this is hard to understand. I know, I know.
how can this be?
he told me I was ugly.
that I was a monster, that I was disfigured.
that no one could stand to look at me.
why would he do this?
I wish I had that answer for you, Kristi.
your father loves you.
but you are the mirror that he looked into every day.
and what he saw of himself was ugly.
he stopped believing that anyone could love you, him-Even though you were the one that loved him the most.
and everything he said about you, he was saying about himself.
remember that.
okay?
good work.
I just learned right now that it's okay to push you harder.
because you didn't think I could handle this?
wisdom and knowledge comes with some degree of grief.
I guess there was a part of me that was trying to protect you from that, you know.
but as a parent protecting a child.
no.
as a fellow fbi agent protecting another fbi agent that I care deeply about.
as long as we're clear.
you know how they train elephants for the circus?
they tie these heavy chains around the baby's legs, and no matter how hard they pull...
can't move.
and then when they grow up, the handler starts to take the chains away but the elephant's given up.
all the handler has to do is use a little string to control it.
all they needed was someone to say...
you're strong.Your chains are weak.
and you can set yourself free anytime you want.
within the FBI's behavioral analysis unit are rapid response teams known as red cells.
these nontraditional teams operate outside the bureaucracy and report solely to the director of the FBI.
come on, sniper.
take your shot.
it's a lousy situation...
you and the unsub...
locked eye to eye.
who's gonna blink...
him...
or you?
guys, I saw the cutest thing on michigan this morning.
there was this man eating an ice cream cone, right?
this big double-scoop chocolate.
and standing right next to him is the saddest-looking little boy.
is this a true story? - Yes, carl, it's a true story.
an ice cream cone at 8: 00 in the morning? - Yes, carl.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, crap. - Good morning to you too.
20 bucks says he asks me to go a round.
somehow, he always knows when I've had a rough night.
Really? What was her name?
her name was lisa. No, it was, um, elise.
that's charming. He never grows up.
growing up is overrated, right?
why don't you guys just kiss, get it over with?
Hey, Mick. - Hey.
want to go a round? - Well, i,um...
morning, all.
Hey, man, how's it going? All right?
rough night, huh?
Yeah.
yeah?
I understand.
Thanks.
I'm gonna guess that was not good news.
you've all heard about the long-distance serial killer from chicago?
Yeah, three kills in the last nine days.
four... As of 20 minutes ago.
about time they called us in.
exactly. - Forensics finally came back, connecting the first three slugs.
of course they're connected.
three different people shot from tall buildings within nine days in the same city.
chicago's a great urban hide for the l. d.s. k.
there's thousands of windows for him to choose from.
any connection between the victims?
it appears random.
there's a white male jogger. There's a black female.
there's a retiree, there's a businessman.
so victimology's not gonna help us at all.
director wants us on the ground there asap.
he thought that mixed expertise in this might help us build this profile.
Yeah, Beth, in the sniper world kid here's a pretty big deal.
Yeah, I seem to excel at certain things.
we'll have to ask Lisa about that one.
I'm pretty sure it was elise.
I'm pretty sure it's irrelevant.
this guy really knows what he's doing.
Yeah, the attacks are very clean.
all one-shot kills, all from a high-rise, all over 300 yards away.
with four kills under his belt, you got to figure he's probably just warming up.
all right, the wheels are up in 40 minutes.
agent cooper.
detective hernandez. We spoke from the plane.
thanks for getting here so fast.
the city's on the verge of panic.
the press are barking at me to make a statement.
Oh, now, I'd really rather you didn't till we get a chance to go into media strategy.
long-distance serial killers are usually listening.
they're very intelligent and like to follow their cases very closely, - so... - Any luck with any witnesses?
the vic was standing there alive, then he was dead - Same as the others.
what about from the building where the shot was fired?
nobody saw anything suspicious.
some of these places get 5, 000 in-and-outs a day.
that was the shooter's last perch?
we estimated the bullet's trajectory based on the angle of entry and exit wounds.
that led us to an empty hotel hallway on the 12th floor.
that's got to be, what...
420 yards?
424.0
detective hernandez. - Excuse me a sec.
what do you see?
he had to compensate for arc.
there's glare refracting off opposing windows.
so it's not the easiest shot that he could've made.
so he's showing off. - Or he's challenging himself.
that's probably the one thing he's good at and just wants the rest of the world to know.
it's incredible. It's about a quarter of a mile away.
with a scope these days, you can make a head shot from a mile away.
he's skilled. He's focused.
he's patient.
patience is a lot of the job.
when we were training, we learned to sit for 24 hours, 48 hours at a stretch.
you know, slowing the breath, not moving a muscle.
he could be watching us right now.
and who are you?
no prints, no debris, and he picks up his shell casing.
so he comes in, decides on his perch, and then he calculates all the variables.
and then he waits.
the door lock was jimmied with an electronic lock pick.
handheld, easy to buy, same as the other hits.
and with a 15% vacancy rate on chicago office space, no shortage of perches for this guy to choose from.
how about ingress and egress?
I mean, how does he get in, and how does he get out?
does he dress like a businessman?
does he blend in with the crowd?
I'll get video surveillance from building security and shoot it over to garcia for a look.
Carl langstrom, according to his wallet, father of nine-year-old twins.
his wife's on her way to make the i. d.
it was nearly dead center...
424 yards- One-shot kill.
you sound impressed. - He's good at what he does.
okay, the other victims
first one, 305 yards, then 345.
next came 390.
gaining confidence every time he pulls that trigger.
this can't be easy for Mick, going up against another shooter.
you know how snipers are - Very competitive natures.
I'm just saying, sometimes these little ripples can become waves.
when I was in the seminary, there was this priest. His name was father juan.
always had this calm about him.
whenever one of us would go through some wrenching crisis of faith, he would say, "just breathe through it. It'll pass."
sometimes a ripple is a wave.
sometimes, beth, a ripple is just a ripple.
you were in the seminary?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize anyone was in here.
Oh, no. Please come in.
that's carl.
are you the police? - fbi.
we're sorry for your loss.
we'll give you a minute.
he was gonna take the girls camping this weekend.
they hate camping.
Carl was always so happy to be out in the woods, they didn't have the heart to say no.
why would anyone do this to carl?
it appears that your husband was a random victim.
random?
how are you gonna find a murderer who randomly shoots people for no reason at all?
cause there is a reason.
somewhere inside of him, there's a reason he does what he does.
we may not understand it yet, but when we do, the "why" is gonna lead us to the "who.
is this all right? - This will be fine.
Thanks. - Holler if you need anything.
so...
tell me what you know.
the unsub knows his way around a rifle.
he's definitely had training.
could be military, s.w. a.t.or a private contractor.
statistically, I would suggest a male-25, 35.
random targets suggests a displaced anger.
he's angry at someone, but not the people he's killing.
it's highly likely he's got a record, bar room fights, workplace aggression.
if he is military, he's easy to track.
we know a bit about the typical sniper psych profile.
special forces screen for certain attributes when they recruit.
snipers have a high i. q.They're patient, disciplined, focused.
they're also controlling. They have huge egos.
a god complex...
I mean, according to u. s. Army research.
okay, fair enough. We certainly don't lack for confidence.
I prefer to call it high self-esteem.
snipers feel invulnerable.
they choose to keep people at a safe emotional distance.
he doesn't see these hits as individuals, but as conquests.
you know, not all snipers are serial killers.
some are just serial daters, darling.
Conquests-exactly.
these people have no value to him.
they're just notches on his belt.
I'm talking about the unsub, not you, Mick.
Hello, windy city transplants.
Penelope. Thanks for joining us.
certainly. What you need?
let's start with police, private military contractors.
mid 20s, mid 30s.
anyone with extensive sniper training.
well, there are...
800, 000 vets in illinois.
but as we look at folks with serious long-range-rifle expertise, those numbers drop to the low hundreds.
tell you what, let me fly my magic keyboard.
I will get back at you with some shiny new developments, okay?
you're the best.
I'll do some geographic pattern analysis.
I have a new algorithmic geo-assessment app that is so good.
I'll get with detective hernandez and go over media strategy.
she's gonna have to face the cameras soon. - Good.
Mick, Gina...
I want you to get a first-hand look at the other crime scenes.
let me know if his m. o. Is consistent.
Beth, you're gonna take a ride with me over to 14th and forrester.
is that where we just came from?
everybody back here in 90.
I enjoy this.
you and me, quality time.
but what are we doing here?
we're seeing what he saw.
well, we were just at this crime scene a few hours ago - What have I missed?
exactly. It was a crime scene.
there was police over here. There's detectives over here.
there's yellow tape on the ground.
this is what he saw when he looked through the scope. - Okay.
so what is he thinking?
well, I'm gonna assume he's arrogant, and he's looking down on people, literally, figuratively.
he's objectifying.
so he's like zeus up on mount olympus casting down his thunderbolts, striking dead any man that he pleases.
he's careful. He's taking aim.
he's taking all the time he wants.
he's-he's challenging himself, 'cause each attack is at a greater distance than the one before, but where's that leading to?
how do you mean? - I mean, he's smart enough to know that this can't just go on forever.
I mean, each shot is more daring than the last one.
what is this building to?
an endgame, a final performance of sorts.
for who?
you just said something. You...
who is he trying to impress?
Mick Rawson, welcome to Chicago.
he's an expert shooter, 25 to 35, with serious anger issues.
he's-he's patient. He's focused, well-educated.
so why does he keep the shells from each of his crimes?
we all do it. They're like trophies. We call it kill brass.
and besides, he's sending us a message.
he's saying that he's in charge, that he's not running.
it's that massive ego at work.
Hey, the scenes all look similar.
we sent video surveillance from the buildings to garcia.
I know. I just got off the phone with her.
she's been crunching data for over an hour-Checking alibis, filtering through every possible person.
And?
and this guy...
he's a ghost.
there is not a sniper who has been trained by the government, by private contractors, within 1, 000 miles who fits our profile.
okay, so he's new in town, he's self-taught.
he has to have trained somewhere. There's no way you can learn to shoot like that from some book.
I have a delivery for a Mick Rawson.
a delivery from who?
if I could just get your signature right here.
a pager?
bang, bang.
yeah? We're on our way.
911 call just came in.
sniper fire at 91st and varna, two dead.
Ahdab Balli, 47.
Jennifer Conway, 22.
they were 20 feet apart and, according to witnesses, went down within one second of each other.
what about forensics on the pager?
I'll have my lab guys clone it and run tests overnight.
we're talking to the delivery service that sent it as well.
bang, bang...
two "bangs," two bodies.
he's upping his game.
Yes, he is.
so what does this pager tell us about our profile?
unsub knows mick is a high-ranking sniper, knows he's working this case, so he's throwing down a challenge.
but how does he knows that? I mean, that's eyes-only information.
he has access to military websites.
or he's a half-decent hacker. - He's a ghost.
no records, no training, but he shoots like a pro.
why is he focusing on Mick?
Mick's an authority surrogate.
he sees him as someone better than himself, so it angers him, pisses him off.
Yeah, but he was killing before ick even entered the picture.
motivation may not change, but the object of focus does.
previous kills are all motivated by anger towards an authority.
right, so he's transferring that rage onto mick.
okay, so he- He buys a pager, and he sends it to Mick, plans out his kill
all this in the service of sticking out his tongue at him?
he's intellectually advanced, but
emotionally, he could be ten years old.
coroner's down there. I'm gonna go and check it out.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm great.
two people just died so this creep could show off for my benefit. I'm just fine.
got to ask...
could this unsub be somebody that you know, - somebody you worked with? - I don't know, man. I don't know.
I want you to think, Mick.
no, I try not to work with psychopaths.
it's a possibility we have to consider here.
look, this guy-he's gonna try to rattle your cage.
don't let him. - I know.
I need you focused.
I need you present.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
just what I said.
stay in the present, not in the past.
are you sitting down? - Yeah.
I'm on a beach in Costa Rica.
okay, so I did some spelunking into cold cases, everything and anything sniper.
you found something. - 12 years ago, there's a long-distance gunshot murder in Chicago.
this kid, Ted Grunburg, 15 years old, shooting hoops, all of a sudden, out of the blue, bang, dead.
police investigate the hell out of it, don't come up with anything, chalk it up to a stray bullet.
and you think this is connected?
Oh, I don't think it's connected.
I know it's connected. I downloaded your forensics.
the slugs are a match. It's the same guy-or girl.
point being, it's the same rifle.
so our unsub makes one kill, then goes dormant for 12 years?
until ten days ago.
Penelope, you're a genius.
and I thrive when recognized as such, sir.
send us everything you can find on this, uh, cold case, this Ted Grunburg
police files, newspaper clippings, whatever you can find.
the answer's there. I know it.
there you are.
I feel like I haven't seen you for days.
I - I was gonna make some pasta later, if you're gonna be home by dinner.
no, I got a thing in town.
Oh, uh, well, you know, it's, um, dad's memorial tomorrow.
remember, at the v. a?
all of his old army buddies are gonna be there.
it starts at-at 2: 00, so we should...
well, we should probably leave here at 1: 30.
I want to get there...- I really need to go.
what will people think if his own son doesn't even show for his memorial?
I don't know.
maybe they'll think I hated his guts.
relax, Amy. I'll be there.
he kills this kid, Ted Grunburg, in a playground, then he just disappears for 12 years. I mean, where the hell did he go?
maybe he moves away. - And doesn't kill?
prison? - Garcia already looked into it.
she couldn't find anyone with this level of training who had been inside for the right dates.
the forensics on the pager tell us anything?
no, nothing, man.
this guy covered his tracks pretty well.
he even paid for the delivery service in cash.
this must be pretty tough on you, huh?
I mean, the whole sniper-versus-sniper thing.
Carlos Hathcock, the white feather.
that's the name on the package he sent.
the most revered sniper of the vietnam war.
93 confirmed kills.
he struck such fear into the heart of the enemy...
they sent in their best snipers to take him out.
one day... He's out on patrol.
he's hunkered down in the bush, and he sees the smallest reflection off in the jungle.
he swings his winchester, and he knows in a heartbeat, it's the reflection of a V.C. Sniper scope aiming directly at him.
two snipers...
both the best in their armies, aiming directly down each other's scopes.
he paged three "bangs."
that means he's going for three kills this time.
we've got to stop him. - Yeah, but where? Where is he going next?
or is he just toying with us.
jerking our chain just to see if we'll jump?
look at this. It's the sniper scan. I told you this geo app was fantastic.
and it is - It found a pattern.
it's a little bit off, but it's not a problem,
see, snipers are taught to scan their target area over and over in specific patterns.
it keeps us alert, and it keeps our eyes sensitive to any change in the environment.
the attacks roughly fit the corners of that pattern.
he's probably doing it subconsciously.
it's just a pattern he's comfortable with.
if I'm right, his next attack should be somewhere around here.
we need barricades- Ten-block perimeter.
and a fast, orderly evacuation.
let's concentrate on the pedestrians first.
all right, spread out, keep your eyes up.
let's go. Move it along. Move it along here.
this way. - Clear the area here.
come on. - It's the sniper, isn't it?
please, listen, we need everyone to clear the area as quickly as possible, all right?
just calm-leave the area.
thank you. - Help me.
I'm sorry, Miss. I need you to evacuate the area.
my son is in that building.
he's-he's in day care. - Get down!
come here! Sir, sir!
get down!
109 building, tenth floor.
this is Cooper. We got a 20 on the unsub.
109 building, tenth floor.
I'd like the whole floor cleared.
clear.
clear.
clear.
clear. - Clear!
FBI! Stop right there!
hands in the air!
blueprints?
I'm an architect.
mark Langford, member of the A.I.A.
why is an architect running from the FBI?
child support. There's a warrant for my arrest. What is - What is this?
just-just take Take...
can-can you at least put those back in my office?
Yeah, oh, sure. - It's for my lake house.
I got it. - It's my only copy.
ingress and egress...
he's slipping through our fingers somehow.
the lobby security is sending you a video feed right now.
Yes, I'm doing it in real time.
I'm cross-referencing from other buildings he's staged from.
he's either a businessman or a phone or a cable guy or a messenger or some sort of building maintenance.
just keep working those tapes.
he's there somewhere. - Okay.
we must've just missed him.
probably walked right by the guy.
he'll change his pattern now. My geo algorithms are a bust.
this isn't working. T - this isn't working.
this whole sniper-against-sniper game he's playing...
he's winning, and we're losing. - No, you're wrong.
we're getting closer. I can feel it.
do you see this pager? This only benefits him, not us.
he has all the power, and we have nothing.
Yeah, well, that's certainly what he wants you to believe, isn't it?
coop, he's killing people to impress me.
he's like a cat leaving dead birds at my feet.
none of this is your fault, okay?
listen to me. It's not your fault.
someone almost died today because they were standing next to me.
but nobody did die!
and this is the first time that he attempted an attack...
and he failed.
and the next time...
we're gonna get him.
it's a lousy situation.
but it's the situation that we're in.
you and the unsub, locked eye to eye.
who's gonna blink...
him...
or you?
I'm here to report on the sniper attack that occurred yesterday afternoon at approximately 3: 22 p. m.
one shot was fired.
and we're pleased to announce that no one was injured in this incident.
is that that sniper again?
what a horrible thing.
people are scared to leave their homes.
I hope it doesn't frighten people away from coming today.
shouldn't you be getting dressed?
the memorial?
I'll drive separately.
you are coming, aren't you?
50 of dad's closest friends, all of his old army buddies.
50 of his friends in one place
wouldn't miss it for the world.
I know you loved him...
somewhere in your heart.
you might not know it, but I do.
if there's a heaven...
or whatever, if dad is watching...
I know that you being there would mean so much to him. - Yeah.
I hope he is up there watching.
I'll see you there.
I love you.
I love you too.
almost 24 hours without an incident.
not even a page. - Pager's burnt.
he'd be crazy to contact us again after such a close call yesterday.
the frequency of attacks increases and increases and then nothing-why?
it's building up towards something.
it's all been practice. - It's leading up to an endgame.
he wants to go out in a blaze of glory.
so a suicide or a death by cop.
let's just work the profile again, people.
he's immature. He's a trained killing machine.
and he's got the emotional life of a child.
profile says he's 25 to 35, which means when he made that first kill, he might've been in his early 20s.
might've been 15. - Come on, where does a 15-year-old learn to shoot like that?
from his father. His father.
maybe we're going about this all wrong.
all this anger at authority, all this "I'm better than you."
maybe it's as simple as proving he's better than his father.
talk to me, handsome.
want to look at snipers, Chicago area.
wow, 432.
cross-check that with recent police reports.
family issues, domestic violence, that sort of thing.
brings it down to 18.
they're mostly divorce disputes, except...
hold up.
retired army sniper, master sergeant James Wheeler, 64.
he was murdered one month ago, blunt-force trauma to the head.
his adult son, Jason, was the prime suspect, except police didn't have enough evidence to charge.
cross-reference Jason with that first kill, the cold case from 12 years ago.
Yeah, Ted Grunburg, 15 years old.
Oh, there-Ted Grunburg and Jason Wheeler went to the same high school.
the father trains the son in long-distance riflery.
the son just keeps on improving, getting better and better.
wants to show him how much he's learned, so he goes to his school, and he kills someone.
and it looks like Jason applied to the army, the marines, and a bunch of independent military contractors.
but his dad wrote them letters advising they shouldn't take him, saying Jason was unstable and had rage issues.
well, there's your stressor. - Father creates a monster.
monster kills the creator. - He works as a messenger.
he currently lives with his sister out in Berwyn.
room clear.
we're right back here.
clear. Place is clear, sir.
all right, radio all units.
there's plenty of weapons. - But no sniper rifle.
here's something.
Amy...I'm sorry for who I am, for what I have to do.
sounds like a suicide note to me.
Hey, Coop, you might want to take a look at this.
I'd heard of the fine marksmanship of James wheeler long before we met.
in military circles, his skill and discipline with a rifle were well-known.
we first served together at Khe Sanh.
and when we returned from Southeast Asia in the fall of '72, we'd formed a bond I knew would never be broken.
and after all these years, I'm proud to say that master sergeant James Wheeler was a fine soldier, a fine man, and my very dear friend.
my name's Sam Cooper.
it's Jason, isn't it? - Yes, ma'am.
do you have any idea where your brother might be?
he said he'd be here.
I've called him three times, but it just goes straight to voice mail.
your brother said that he was coming here?
Yes.
what exactly did he say to you?
uh, that he wouldn't miss it...
and something about...
50 of dad's old army buddies together in one place.
excuse me.
all right, we need to lock the doors.
nobody leaves this place.
this is the endgame.
he's planning a massacre right here.
for your safety, no one will be allowed to leave this building until further notice.
this is a police, FBI lockdown.
and we're gonna need your patience and cooperation.
I want to remind you how important it is to stay away from these entrance windows.
we need it sooner. We need it now.
I understand, but he's not gonna wait for us to put
you know what? You just move as fast as you can, all right?
how many barricades?
there's 16 routes into this neighborhood.
securing the roads is gonna take another five to seven minutes.
what do we know?
if this is indeed his target, he's gonna be in one of these nine buildings right here.
across the street is the owens building.
429 spencer street, 22 floors, all vacant.
it used to be a chicago daily newspaper.
it went under about six months ago.
he's in that building.
get a team over there and start kicking in doors.
how's everyone holding up over here?
they're army. They don't complain.
Beth, I want you to go with Gina.
I want you to keep an eye on these civilians, all right?
sure. - Mick, take the stairs.
you find yourself a perch and get good sight lines across the street. - Yes, sir.
prophet, you're with me and s. w.a. t. - Got it.
be careful up there.
no worries. This guy's good.
but I'm better.
okay, I'm on the roof of the v. a. Building.
if I'm right, he's in one of 466 windows directly opposite me.
he's probably hunkered down, waiting for the memorial to end.
we locked the front door. Nobody's coming out.
I can't imagine what you people must think of me.
why do you say that?
first, dad is killed, and then jason is questioned by the police.
next thing I know, there's a sniper all over the news.
I know that dad trained jason to shoot...
but I just-I couldn't let myself believe that...
he was such a sweet little boy.
it's okay. Listen...
relax. Just keep him talking.
be calm.
Jason? - Hey.
look, sorry I couldn't make it.
how's the memorial? - Where are you?
I wanted to let you know not to wait for me.
Jason, don't do this.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
we've been made. He's onto us.
okay, we got a car Late arrivals to the memorial.
where the hell are the barricades?
get out of the street! Clear the area now!
Mick! Where is he?
I don't know. I didn't see a muzzle flash.
he must be back from the window. By angle of trajectory, he's on the 22nd floor, maybe the 23rd.
we need an armored vehicle down here now.
we have a civilian casualty in the street.
I have movement. He's alive.
no, Gina, don't. Stand down. It's a kill zone.
I can do this. - Gina!
Hey, I'm right here!
here I am! Hey, I'm right here!
you want me? I'm right here!
okay, I've got him - 22nd floor.
come on, sniper...
take your shot.
drop it.
or what?
drop the rifle now.
got him, Mick.
I've got him too, Cooper.
let me take the shot.
shoot!
I had him.
no doubt.
you owe me one.
Hey. Come on.
no, I don't want to fight you, man.
I said, I don't want to fight, okay?
just go with it.
okay. Let's go a round, then.
Mick's got this one.
Nope. Coop's been studying kali for ten years.
we'll see.
I would've had him, Cooper. - You did have him.
we won, Mick. Let it go.
nice work.
victory is sweet. Got to savor it, right?
Thanks, man. Thanks.
thanks for letting me win.
take it easy.
how am I gonna get home?
I'm gonna take you home.
you're so good to me.
what was that?
what?
a scream. Didn't you hear it?
wait here.
probably just someone partying.
no, it sounds like a woman in trouble.
please!
help me!
what the hell's going on?
help! Help!
somebody help, please!
please!
help!
Sam cooper, b.a.u.
Jim Brigman, Indianapolis p.d.
thanks for coming.
your intel was really confusing.
was there an abduction or not?
uh, we got a witness-22-year-old inebriated female out clubbing with her boyfriend last night.
she thinks he might have heard a scream in the parking lot.
she thinks?
she blew a .23.
that sounds like a pretty reliable witness.
Yeah, said her boyfriend acted like he saw some trouble, thought he heard a woman.
told his girl to stay put.
next thing she knows, he's lying in a pool of blood, throat slashed clear through.
car drove off - best she can tell me is it had four wheels.
so her boyfriend's dead?
no. Thank you.
he's in grave condition, probably won't last a day.
family is upstairs saying their good-byes.
so this scream, you think it was an abduction - why?
we've had two other women go missing in the past couple of weeks in the same area.
those trails have gone cold.
this may be a third.
I hate to ask the obvious, but has a third woman been reported missing?
no, but it's only been eight hours.
look, I know this is a long shot.
but I can't take any chances.
our department has run down every lead on the first two missing women.
God forbid we have a serial offender here.
you know, we don't need to be heroes on this one.
if we can bring in the big guns, we'll take all the help we can get.
female witness - she's here?
Yeah.
I...I didn't see anything.
I'm sorry.
the car was a few rows over, you know?
and, um. And I was drinking, and Mike was just taking me home.
was he drinking too?
no.
no, mike's really careful when he needs to drive.
he switched to pop.
I know you may have heard somebody cry out.
can you... I - I heard something, but it could've been anything.
Mike seemed convinced that a girl was in trouble, and he went to check it out, and...
he was only gone for a minute, at least I thought.
I...I went to find him, and...
Mike's a good guy.
he is.
he really is.
Yeah.
the car - do you remember if it was a newer model, perhaps, or maybe high-end or an older kind of car?
I I - I really don't know.
um, it was-it was black...
or-or brown, um...
or maybe dark blue or green.
I don't...I really don't know.
who could've done this?
excuse me.
I'm with the FBI.
we're sorry for your troubles today.
would you mind if I spoke with mike?
of course.
thank you.
I'm Sam Cooper.
I'm with the FBI.
I understand you can't talk.
don't even try to talk, all right?
if you understand me, you squeeze my hand, okay?
that's good.
Cindy's okay. I just talked to her.
she's fine.
the man who did this to you, was there anybody with him?
there was?
a woman?
what is it, mike?
was she being abducted?
you absolutely sure?
did she talk to you?
did she say something to you?
and...
she wanted you to help her, but, mike, you couldn't, because he hurt you first.
you're a hero, mike.
you're a good Samaritan.
and you did not deserve any of this.
I'm gonna take over for you right now, okay?
just relax, all right?
nurse!
I need a nurse in here!
let them do their job.
prepping BVM. I'll get the cart.
push in.
leave me alone!
two missing women that we know of for sure and a jane doe.
let's not call her that, please.
Why? - Because it's only been about 12 hours.
someone is bound to call on her behalf.
well, until they do, at least we have the information on the reported abductions.
Gina, victimology, please.
we have Lisha Vernon, 53, african-american.
she was abducted on the 15th.
works as a manager in an industrial laundry plant, servicing hotels, country clubs, hospitals, the like.
middle management, with a college education.
so she leads a low-risk lifestyle.
she ain't the type to just up and rabbit.
what were the circumstances the last time she was seen, detective?
uh, she worked late.
son was supposed to pick her up, but he was running late.
she was gonna grab a bus.
no one's heard from her since.
so she didn't make it onto the bus.
no driver i.d.'d her.
all right...
second woman.
second woman is Ami Hodgkins, 25, originally from Tennessee.
grad student, applied sociology at U Indy.
she went missing on the 23rd.
spent a late night at the library.
her car was found in the morning parked not 60 yards from the front door.
there's no witnesses, no ransom notes?
nothing.
so is there any reason that these women would want to disappear?
not from these reports.
all right.
I want you two to look at the latest crime scene with fresh eyes.
Mike interrupted an abduction.
it's possible that the unsub made a mistake when he was trying to escape.
and, you two, I want you to focus on Ami Hodgkins.
talk to her family, talk to her friends.
I'm gonna take Lisha Vernon's family, all right?
all that information's in the files.
Yeah, but what we're looking for is who they trusted, how careful they were, how they lived their lives.
their daily behavior's gonna tell us what kind of unsub could get close to them.
what about the girl from last night?
best way to find her is to dig into the other two abductions.
if it is the same unsub, their lives are gonna tell us about hers.
okay, our victim approaches from here.
he's not drunk.
he's cautious, responsible.
if the club was as crowded as the police say, his view was occluded.
and he's attacked here, right at the head of the row.
you got no cover from this direction.
you got no cover from here.
the unsub doesn't care if anybody sees him.
or he just took care of business as quickly as possible.
look, there's no tire marks.
looks like the unsub just calmly drove away.
he's experienced.
there's no way anyone can pull this off and remain calm first time out.
he might be a big guy.
or at the very least, he's got some muscle, enough to subdue a woman and take on her male defender simultaneously.
let's come back later tonight when this place is packed.
see what we can find out.
as long as you're buying, buddy.
I was supposed to pick her up.
I always pick her up.
the one time I... - Your mother fell victim to a crime.
the fault lies with the criminal, not with you.
why is the FBI involved?
we think another woman may have been taken last night.
Really?
it's too early to say.
could you tell me about your mom?
not what you told the other police
tell me what she was like as a person.
she's a saint.
I'm sure she is.
you know, when we were kids, she never ate until we all ate
always took the smallest portion, completely selfless.
the only thing she treats herself to is getting her nails done.
french manicures.
a mother-daughter thing, you know?
every other Saturday.
with my aunt, it was, um, her hair.
every Saturday at noon, we always knew where to find her.
why would anyone want to kidnap her?
"why" is often the most difficult question to answer.
sometimes I just can't.
she doesn't trust anybody.
she's street-smart.
she wouldn't be walking around not paying attention to what's around.
she carries pepper spray.
that's very important information.
that helps me, um, figure out who might've taken her.
so thank you for that.
do you think she's still alive?
I have to assume that she is.
I should've picked her up.
my boss says we can use his office.
thank you very much for speaking with us.
ami's my best friend. Whatever I can do.
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you.
do you have a good support group, friends to talk to?
I do, yes, thank you.
and we went over your statement to the police and the reports, but we were hoping that maybe there's something else you could remember?
I've been racking my brain, trying to think of who'd want to hurt Ami.
um, she only had one serious boyfriend in college.
but, uh, he's married now, and they're friends on Facebook.
he lives in Miami, correct?
and how about financially?
did she have any outstanding debts, any reason to want to disappear?
like, did she run away or...
no, absolutely not.
no, Ami is incredibly responsible.
She-she just adopted a rescue dog.
she was looking for a new apartment.
you know, she was establishing herself.
is she a pretty trusting person?
very.
she used to give homeless people rides to shelters.
I know.
just her alone in her little bug, picking men up off the street.
I always told her to stop it.
I said one day, she's gonna...
I asked her to be more careful.
look, um...
my uncle's a retired agent.
what unit are you from?
Behavioral... - Missing Persons.
okay, Missing Persons?
so then you guys - you do this kind of stuff all the time.
every day.
okay, this is my card.
please call us if you hear anything, okay?
thank you.
excuse me.
I've spoken with everyone.
no one remembers a woman arriving or leaving on their own.
all the cars in the parking lot were accounted for.
so she either came with someone, or she took a cab.
Gina's already run that down.
I mean, so far, she's come up with nothing.
the attack site was well-lit.
you were right. He must've acted pretty quick.
look around, man.
what do you see?
a lot of pretty girls.
you know who you don't see?
you don't see anyone over 30.
if he was older, he would've stood out.
it's not much, but it's something.
all right. Let's get out of here, man.
this place is giving me a headache.
all right, grandpa, let's get you home.
coming up on 24 hours, and still no report of a missing woman.
if mike hadn't been so sure, I might even question whether she was real or not.
how does somebody go unmissed?
this unsub's way too efficient just to be starting out.
you don't believe in prodigies?
Lisha Vernon was a savvy woman in her 50s.
according to her son, she was aware of her surroundings.
she would've fought back.
ami was squeaky clean - Very open, very trusting, not a lot of street smarts.
it's backwards, right?
grandmother with a family, then a trusting young woman all alone in the big city.
the victimology is all over the charts.
it's almost diametrically different.
he's not a very preferential offender.
so that club is pretty busy Crowd young.
no one remembers seeing anything out of the ordinary or any single women of any interest.
between that and the university, I'm guessing we're probably looking at an unsub anywhere from their mid 20s to their early 30s.
the progression of these abductions doesn't make any sense.
and without knowing anything about jane doe, we can't factor her into this.
these guys - they always start off with easy targets, and they work their way up.
so you think there are other victims?
no other low-risk women have been reported missing.
there's no other high-risk women either.
but they might not be - I mean, if they don't have anyone looking for them, like a prostitute.
drug addicts or runaways.
women in domestic-abuse shelters
they're always kept on the down-low.
undocumented immigrants.
our unsub may have been snatching women who fell through the cracks.
let's cast a wider net, see if we can find him.
I talked to a local pimp who says he had two girls gone missing
the first one on the 23rd of last month, the second on the 1st of this month.
both are repeat offenders, local girls.
so now we got at least five women who are missing.
which fits into the typical unsub progression.
first, prostitutes disappear.
no one seems to notice.
he gains confidence and goes after women who present a greater challenge.
our unsub snatches women on a Thursday or a Friday night.
grabs them while they're on the street, isolated.
he's a predator. He's trolling.
this guy knows how to blend in, so most likely we're dealing with a local.
he holds them somewhere private, possibly a basement, a warehouse, a farmhouse.
and if he is holding them over the weekend, it's safe to assume he doesn't have a family or children, a girlfriend
so get with your informants, your street criminals.
let them know what you're looking for.
they usually have a good idea of what's going on in their neighborhoods.
this guy-he may have attracted attention.
you just haven't asked the right person yet.
all right, let's get out there.
I'll shoot this over to Garcia, see if she can work her magic.
okay, so I-I-I start with prostitutes.
nobody even knows they're missing until you guys start asking questions, so why would I change my m.o.?
even if I'm looking for a greater challenge,
I mean, what went wrong that I would have to abduct Lisha?
we're missing something.
I need something.
I need something.
Hey, I'm Prophet, man.
so what can I do for you?
detective Brigman says you're the man to talk to.
Ah, that just means he doesn't know a thing about vice.
we got two streetwalkers gone missing.
we think they were abducted by that same guy who slit that kid's throat outside the club.
two streetwalkers missing.
without bodies, you know, it's hard to tell.
you know, these girls move on.
it's not like Indianapolis has a lot of opportunity.
you know, a lot of them head to Chicago, St. Louis, Nashville.
the guy who works this corner-Big tiny.
Yeah, that's fitting.
he swears these girls wouldn't leave him.
what, they love him too much? - I don't know.
he says they're dedicated.
Zandra Haymore - she went missing Thursday the 23rd.
Maria Sanchez disappeared somewhere around the 1st.
the following weekend?
next victim didn't disappear until two weeks later - Thursday.
you got anyone unaccounted for around the 7th or 8th?
not that weekend. We did a sweep.
a vice sweep?
Yeah.
when?
the 7th and another on the 15th.
that's why he moved on to other victims.
you guys had all the hookers in lockup.
so he snatched a grandmother.
you can't win, huh?
no.
thanks for your help, man.
no worries.
all right.
time to finish up.
we tracked down Zandra Haymore
one of the missing hookers. She's alive and well.
thank god, man.
went home to Houston to get clean, checked herself into rehab ten days ago.
at least one of these women has a happy ending.
Meaning?
it's unlikely that our unsub has kept the rest of these women alive this long.
he needs a disposal site.
I've got all state and local departments out searching for them.
are you suggesting I call it off? - No, not at all.
if his disposal site was close to his hunting ground, we would've found graves in these parks.
could've buried them in his home, like an animal in his den.
so it's highly probable that he's not in a residential area.
it has to be this industrial one.
Garcia, check out that area right there, see if there are any sexual offenders who are working in that area.
she's also running licenses and plates of all business personnel in the area.
I mean, those vice cops
they could've scooped him up in the raid without even realizing it.
what about here? It's a salvage yard.
when I was inside, these wise guys, they said that's how they used to get rid of bodies all the time
just stuff them in a trunk, crush it, melt it down, and ship it overseas.
all right, this is the third sweep. If nothing turns up, I'm gonna have to call it.
I understand that. It's just this place, or one like it
it fits our profile. I'm sure.
we're all looking for a needle in a haystack.
what do you got, Coop?
a discarded bag of cement with blood on it.
there's 30 bags total, only two with blood traces.
blood type does match Lisha Vernon.
slow down. Let's get a DNA sample from the son to confirm that, all right?
prophet says that the salvage yard owner checks out.
so we may be looking at a scrap dealer or a junk collector.
these bags are commercial-grade concrete. You don't buy that at Home Depot.
this guy's got to be a laborer, construction worker, professional contractor.
we're tracing the lot numbers now.
that'll get us a distributor, but this guy's... He's smart.
he paid cash.
he may be sealing these women in a building somewhere - a floor, a wall, a foundation.
what about a water burial?
but historically, that does indicate a female unsub.
no, Scott Peterson. - Fair point.
maybe he's put them in a container and filling it with cement.
he could be using the classic cement shoes.
that makes more sense for an ocean disposal.
so what do you think - disposal site in the White River?
I say fall creek is a better bet.
all right, so let's call Brigman, tell him we want a - a water search.
maybe we got another needle in the haystack.
so that's three more down there.
we pulled four drums, but you only recovered three bodies.
no, there's a fourth Caucasian, female, mid 20s.
all her parts were encased together.
it's jane.
it's-it's our jane doe from the club.
we'll have her excavated soon.
but we've recovered the first body - Or at least parts from the first drum.
no head there? - No.
and the, uh, limbs... They're Lisha Vernon's, right?
correct, but the torso's that of your missing student Ami Hodgkins.
they were killed roughly at the same time, most likely a few days apart... Lisha killed first.
and on first glance, it appears that the other remains are also mixed and matched.
we got a torso from one victim, limbs from another...
he dismembered these women while they were still alive.
the cement prevented water damage, so we got a pretty good picture of what happened, at least in this case.
the killer applied tourniquets, most likely steel bands.
top of the limbs, necrotic - Was deprived of oxygen for 12, maybe 14 hours.
but the tissue just below the injury was still alive.
there's no sign of gangrene.
so I think once the area where he intended to make his cut was dead, he severed it.
would he need a medical degree to be able to apply a tourniquet to keep these people alive?
no, you need a computer and a search engine.
you can determine what type of instrument he used to dismember the bodies?
Yeah, this is a clean cut, straight through the bone.
it's a high-powered electric saw.
if these limbs were dead, then the women wouldn't bleed out from the amputation.
they all survived.
he kept them alive a few more hours.
how does someone do that...
have that much hatred?
yeah?
we're ready.
I've got to stay professional here.
if this didn't get to you, I'd be worried about you.
no one has come forward for jane, not one person.
how is someone so young so alone in the world?
all right, guys...
he's clear off the psychopathy charts.
let's start with the dismemberment.
he does it while they're alive. why?
because he's sick. - We should look at hospitals, rehab facilities.
he could have a thing for amputees. - He tires of them fighting back.
or a past rape victim did fight back, and now he's punishing them all.
he's got a pretty specific start date.
if he was incarcerated before that, it's conceivable that his conviction rested on some woman who fought back.
could've scratched him, accumulated some DNA evidence.
could've planned the whole thing in prison.
let's run all sexual offenders who've been released in the midwest area in the last two - make it three years.
we still don't have an i. d. For jane.
fingerprints don't match, Quantico's running a DNA test, but it's a shot in the dark.
without a head, it ain't like we're doing any facial rec.
this is all about self-hatred.
our unsub is severing all human contact, all that which makes him human.
he's dehumanizing himself. He's - he's cutting himself off.
so where does that leave us?
we've run the records - nothing.
we've run the geo profile - nothing.
we've run the victims - nothing. We ran the cement - Nothing!
nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing!
what about the steel drums, the barrels? What about them?
it's typical construction fare. We're running a trace for the distributor now.
those things are heavy even if they're empty.
you put, uh, cement and body parts - It's got to weigh, what, 500 pounds?
we established that he's strong, that he's a laborer, but that's a lot of weight.
think he has an accomplice? - Maybe he's got a winch.
check those drums for striation marks. You find them, we need to look for...
flatbeds with winches, tow trucks, cranes. Let's go.
we can't leave this guy out there another minute.
Yes, I tried that too.
I'll call triple "a. " They don't take that long. Don't bother.
if they can jump it, I'll be home soon.
if they have to take it into a garage, I'll call a cab.
just make sure Callie does her homework. Don't let her play you.
Oh, I think someone's pulling over to help.
hello. Thanks for stopping.
we want to see our mother, now. - Excuse me. Hold on, please. What's going on?
I got this. - The news reported that you found the bodies.
have the police spoken to you?
no one's told us anything. - Is she here? Did you find her?
Yes. I have to confirm with DNA, but I'm pretty sure.
we need to see her.
that's not a good idea. - Why?
what did he do to her?
what did he do to her? Please, tell me.
not in front of the baby. Could you please?
I'm not gonna mince words.
it's bad.
how bad?
we found your mother's remains.
how do you know it's her?
I'm sorry.
please, I have to see her.
I... I just need to see her face, just one last time.
that - It's not possible. - Oh, my god!
Oh, god, why didn't I pick her up?
excuse me, Sam.
another woman was just reported missing. Her husband said she had car trouble.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to leave.
promise me one thing.
you'll give me five minutes alone with this guy.
I'll do the same thing to him he did to her.
that's what he deserves, not jail, and he has to pay for what he did to my mother.
he will.
you have my word.
this is a crime of opportunity. Victim's car breaks down, the unsub happens by, he says, "what the hell? Why not?"
agreed. It happened in broad daylight.
the victim's age matches more in line with Lisha Vernon, the last victim of opportunity.
the vic tells her husband someone was pulling up to help.
but our unsub is too meticulous, too cautious to have stopped on his first pass.
he would've done at least one drive-by.
I thought you guys forgot about me. - Never.
how can I help? How can I help?
want you to see if you can pull data from traffic cameras in the area.
I can. I'm already logged in.
search for white male, 20s, trolling through the area for, say, 20 minutes before the abduction.
start with tow trucks and pickups, please.
um, nothing like that. There's a muscle car three blocks over.
it's making loops eight minutes apart. It's a-a Trans-am, Charger
sorry. I don't know my cars. - Just send it to us.
doing so right now.
okay, there you go.
69 CamaroI had one of those. - Who owns that?
it is registered to Todd Logan, who's an electrician in the Indy area.
I'll have Brigman put out an a. p.b.
see, a little Garcia goes a long way.
happy to help. - Thank you, Penelope.
put your hands outside the vehicle now!
what are you doing? - Put your hands out!
get out of the car.
turn around.
put your hands on your head.
someone moved in the car!
my baby!
it's a kid.
Todd Logan? - Yes?
this vehicle was used in a crime today. Were you in this car all day?
I just got it back from the mechanic's.
what mechanic? - The shop over on 16th.
clear.
clear.
clear.
check the cars.
clear!
Oh, god! oh!
Sam, let him go.
underneath.
it's her.
it's okay.
you're safe now.
it's all right. You're gonna be all right.
we'll get you out of here, all right?
I need some wire cutters!
it's all right.
here we go.
you'll be all right.
we're gonna get you home, okay?
here you go.
it's all right. You're all right. You're fine.
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
I got you. Careful. One big step.
what is it?
the bodies in the drums. What was that?
you trying to build the perfect woman - your bride or something?
what are you talking about? - The torsos and limbs were mixed up.
they were from different victims.
who cares? It was done.
what, you guys think this all had some kind of meaning, some statue for the ages?
this is funny to you?
hysterical.
the girl from the club. Who was she?
the girl from the club?
the club... Right.
she had some spirit, you know, some fight.
she was cool.
what was her name?
how the hell should I know? Some broad with real bad luck.
you think you're special.
what?
you seem to feel that there's something special about you, like you're something that we've never seen before.
are you saying I'm not? - Unique?
hardly. In fact, it's pretty pathetic, really.
you're pathetic.
I think what you have is trouble maintaining inner cohesiveness.
that means that you have no ability to recognize the separateness of people.
your mother, your father, grocery clerk
you can't recognize the difference between any of them.
you have lived your entire life without enjoyment.
these murders - they didn't even give you any pleasure.
you don't even know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about the girl from the club.
you sit here, and you're acting like you're enjoying yourself, but the truth is...
you're not capable of enjoying anything.
this...
is all an act. - It is not!
see that, detective? He sounds like a kid.
you ever seen a toddler trying to put his toys away?
gets them all mixed up.
you're acting like you're a big man, but, really, you just carried into your adult life the emotional development of a child.
shut up.
these women that you murdered - they had lives. They had families.
they had people who will miss them. You took that away from them.
but at least they had it in the first place.
anyone heard from Prophet?
I'm fine, Coop.
you weren't worried about me, were you?
we all got sprayed in the academy, but I'm pretty sure you didn't turn up that day, mate.
gonna take more than pepper spray to take Prophet down.
Really? That's all it took?
cause you went down like a ton of bricks.
that's not my memory of it.
you lost your memory too?
Oh, don't worry. Prophet's gonna stay in the family.
Oh, yeah? - No.
don't worry. I've already texted everyone at b.a.u.
I sent them photos.
you guys done? - No.
you got something in your eye. - Here, go on ahead.
so we never did i. d. Jane.
no.
I'll add her to the unidentified persons database.
that's a good thing to do.
as you know, I've been transferred between departments about 800 times.
and that's a lot of forms to fill out.
I still don't have an "in case of emergency" contact.
put me down.
I appreciate that, but you're my boss.
and I'm not certain that anyone besides yourself would look for me.
that may be true before.
but that's not true now, Beth. It's not.
you're a kind man.
don't worry. I won't friend you on Facebook.
that's your loss.
I'll see you later.
all right, see you later.
we're gathered here today to bear witness to a fallen sparrow - A woman who was dragged through the horrible darkness on her way towards the light.
Jane, whoever you really are, thank you for your sacrifice.
this evil would have never been stopped if it weren't for the price you paid.
Boise National Forest Boise, Idaho - Hey, Paul, you hear that? - Yeah.
Hey, you gotta challenge yourself, Johnny.
that's the only way you're ever going to get better.
OK, so, you aim straight for the heart
try to avoid the shoulder blades, and uh, should be a quick, clean kill.
OK, so, don't over think it.
you know what to do, just-- just aim and shoot.
well, don't worry.
took me a long time to get my first big one.
you just need more practice.
Hey, hey, easy.
I think we've been here 5 minutes.
Yeah, but look at her, broke away from the group.
guy saw her alone, felt confident, and made his move.
it must be serious.
ladies, this is Brad, a real F. B. I. agent.
Really? - Really.
no way.
that's exciting. What's it like at Quantico?
it's, uh, quite impressive.
what department are you in? - That's classified.
Ooh, must be really tough keeping all those secrets.
you know, it's a skill like anything else.
carpenters are good at building stuff, measuring.
F. B. I. is good at keeping secrets and kicking criminal ass.
well, somebody has got to do it.
Oh, do you have to carry your gun and badge with you everywhere you go?
affirmative.
can we see it?
see what? - Your badge.
please. - I'm sorry, that's...
classified.
figures. Of course.
tell me, Brad, does it look anything like this?
or, uh, this?
or maybe this?
poor lass, it's a tough job.
agent Jareau.
lady, you are officially in my top 8, and I am so blogging about this later.
clink me.
sorry, ladies.
a year ago victims and their vehicles disappeared from Washington state.
they were found over 200 miles away in the remote woods of Idaho.
Courtney Jacobs, 24, and Shane Everett, 25.
autopsy revealed similar entry and exit wounds through the chest.
ballistics?
no bullets were found.
looks like they were out there for a long time before they were killed.
at least 6 or 7 days. - Then, what happened in that week?
I don't want to know.
look at the way they're dressed, they didn't voluntarily go into the woods like that.
Yeah, neither did this man.
found yesterday with similar wounds, there's still no I. D.
OK, so, I'm gonna look for missing persons in Washington.
look everywhere, we don't know where this victim came from.
we only know where he ended up.
kills both males and females.
victims were found with their clothes on, no degradation
no experimentation, doesn't look like he's interested in either.
a serial killer with no sexual preference?
that'd be a first.
broken nose and bark is embedded in his face, looks like he ran into a tree.
now, how do you miss a huge tree?
too busy looking behind you.
none of these are defensive wounds.
Courtney Jacobs' hands are torn up.
Shane Everett has only got one shoe on, it's like he ran out of the other one.
he sustained numerous injuries and just kept going.
only one thing you run that hard for-- your life.
one man's wilderness is another man's theme park.
author unknown.
transporting young, fit victims from Washington to Idaho poses huge risks.
must have a good reason to chance getting pulled over, or have the victims escape.
it says here that every year 100 or so people go missing in Idaho's wilderness.
with millions of acres to cover, 1/3 of them are never found.
sounds like the reason as to why this place.
well, it offers privacy and the possibility the body will never be recovered.
an area this remote and rugged suggests that the offender is more comfortable in the woods.
something like a second home.
my grandfather retired to the French alps.
he lived there until he died.
there was a good 10-year stretch where he didn't come down off the mountain.
he had no running water, no electricity.
and his food supplies, everything, all of it came from the land.
you spent a lot of time up there?
Yeah, whenever we were in France, which was a lot.
guess who's getting a gold star?
Oh, that'd be you, baby girl, if you got some good news for us.
well, I started my missing persons search in Spokane county.
and wouldn't you know, there's been 10 in the last 5 years, all in their early twenties.
and isn't this interesting?
it's always in the spring and their cars are never recovered.
and fret not, I'm looking for the cars, too.
anything else? - Mmm, oh, local P. D.
identified the latest victim through dental records.
his name's Alex Harrison, he's from Washington.
where was he last seen?
family statements say he was traveling to work in Spokane.
and both victims last year were traveling outside of Spokane, too.
all victims headed to the city.
and none of them reached their destination.
Garcia? - Already on it.
there are 4 major roadways into Spokane, highways 395, 195, and highway 2.
there's also interstate 90.
were there any police reports or roadside assistance calls from those highways?
you're going to know that as soon as I do.
OK, we've got 2 locations.
I'm happy to go to Idaho.
woods is like your second home, right, Prentiss?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Reid, why don't you go to Spokane?
I could use the fresh air.
we'll touch every couple of hours.
I'll call you when we get on the mountain.
we've got 2 male and 1 female victim, all about the same age,
but from different socio-economic backgrounds.
the only thing they seem to have in common is they were traveling to the same city.
and broken bones.
there's a hairline fracture in the wrist, a sprained ankle, and a broken nose.
also, early autopsy reports show soft, clean tissue damage
and deep puncture wounds through the major organs.
bullets flare out when they hit the body, it's gotta be something else.
whatever weapon was used cut completely through the front of the chest
and went right out of the back.
it's interesting, given the point of entry, that each victim has 2 wounds.
and it's always 2.
you must be Agent Jareau. - Nice to meet you.
this is special Agent Aaron Hotchner. Dr. Spencer Reid.
this is Sheriff Raymond Schaeffer.
well, I see you're getting settled.
thank you for the space. - Well, thank you for flying out.
um, has Alex Harrison's family been notified yet?
not yet.
uh, parents were divorced, he lived with his father.
I was waiting for your unit to arrive.
I could use the company. - I'm happy to come along.
Hotch, I'll let you know what I find. - Thanks.
is this your first notification, Sheriff?
uh, is it that obvious?
uh, I can give you a few tips.
I just got this promotion
and the sheriff I replaced retired after 30 years.
so, I got big shoes to fill.
I'm just happy deaths in our county are down.
well, believe me, it never gets easy.
this father's worst nightmare is about to come true.
Boise National Forest Boise, Idaho.
how was the drive up the mountain?
well, before or after the flat tire?
that good, huh?
I'm the head ranger, Lizzie Evans.
Hi, agent Prentiss, this is agent Morgan.
agent gideon's still in town.
you must be exhausted from the trip, but we need to keep moving.
we want to be out of here by nightfall.
then, by all means, after you.
yes? - Sir, are you Timothy Harrison?
is this about Alex?
politely ask them to sit, and, uh, be prepared for a physical reaction.
I once had a woman faint and hit her head
and I had to give her the news a second time at the hospital.
that wasn't fun.
Mr. Harrison, can we sit down?
if you don't mind, I'd like to stand.
sir, I wish I didn't have to tell you this
but we've found your son Alex in the boise national forest.
so, he's ok?
I'm so sorry, Mr. Harrison, but Alex wasn't alive when we found him.
denial is the first emotion so be prepared to explain to them how you know that this is their child.
this is a mistake.
Alex doesn't know anyone in idaho.
how do you even know it's him?
well, sir, when you file a missing persons report
you gave us access to his dental records.
you're lying.
be gentle, allow yourself to show emotion.
it'll validate what the family is feeling.
first rule on the police force, agent Jareau, no crying.
God, tell me this isn't true.
I'll do anything, please help me.
we can't imagine what you're going through, Mr. Harrison.
he's all I've got, my boy.
don't you understand?
I do.
sir, we're investigating Alex's death as a possible homicide.
murder?
we were hoping that maybe you could answer some questions.
Alex was the best wide out the huskies had seen in years.
he was physical, strong.
he had great instincts.
after graduation he wanted a career.
didn't want to be known as a jock. This can't be happening.
I need to call Alex's mother. - Of course.
we'll stay here until your family arrives.
how long have you been a ranger?
5 years now, but I've lived in these woods my whole life.
growing up out here help you do your job?
look around. Do you see or hear anything right now?
no. - No.
there's a black bear about 25 yards to your right.
how long before we're able to do that?
depends on how well you use your instincts.
well, this gives new meaning to the word remote.
Yeah, it'd be awfully hard to find this location if you weren't familiar with the area.
there must only be a handful of people who know the terrain well enough to survive.
boot tracks.
they're the same tread, but they're different sizes.
well, there's at least 2 people who know this terrain.
OK, so, this is where Alex Harrison's body was found.
Morgan, from this particular spot
there are areas of higher ground that look down to where the victim died.
Yeah, I got a perfect view of you through the trees right here.
those are basic tactics that hunters use.
they use vantage points to watch their prey.
if these are tactics that hunters use...
they were precise enough to cover each other and take out their prey at the same time.
if both victims have 2 wounds, could be one for each offender.
I think we know how Alex Harrison died.
you think this guy looks bad, you should see the driver.
he needed 10 stitches.
you better hurry, all the groups are filling up.
you like the challenge of a bear, don't you?
actually, I prefer picking up my meat at a grocery store.
Oh, you're one of those, huh?
better be careful out there
because in 3 days it's going to get busy as hell up on our mountain.
hunting season?
Yeah, ever since somebody wrote about us in some fancy travel magazine
we've got loads of tourists migrating up here.
if I was going to take out an animal anywhere from 100 to 200 pounds what type of weapon would I use?
a shotgun and compound bow are the tops but buckshot can be a bit messy.
I love arrows.
it can completely penetrate the body of a small animal.
it's the most effective kill.
arrows.
hold on a minute, I'll put you on speaker.
hunting season officially opens in 3 days.
does it look like the victim's wounds could be from an arrow?
whatever punctured the organs had to be long enough to penetrate the chest and mimic a 22 caliber bullet, so, yeah, it's possible.
I think these victims are being caught, taken to the woods and hunted like wild animals.
Oh, not again. Come on, Ruby.
come on, baby, a few more miles.
damn it.
Hi, hello?
Hi, I called before, my car's broken down for good.
Highway 2.
can you hear me? Never mind.
you need some help, miss?
so, I started pulling hunting licenses.
you should narrow down the suspect list before you dive in.
well, what else are we looking for?
you're about to find out.
we're looking for at least 2 offenders in good physical condition.
you'd have to be fit to make it through this terrain.
and nobody would go that deep into the woods without backup.
killing teams are like most partnerships, one weak, the other strong.
these men haven't exhibited any sexual interest in their victims
so they're either developmentally prepubescent -- Or they could be related.
immediate relatives wouldn't discuss sexual encounters
let alone perform them in front of each other.
if they are related, they could have an us-versus-them mentality.
their bond will be unbreakable because it's all they know.
most hunters put animals out of their misery.
the men we're looking for, they don't show any mercy.
these guys take pleasure in watching their casualties die a slow death.
every spring for the past 5 years, people have gone missing.
we think the killers wait for their prey to migrate through these woods.
Courtney Jacobs, shane everett, and Alex Harrison were all healthy.
smart adults who survived for days by following their instincts.
they found themselves in the middle of nowhere.
they were either approached in a way that wasn't threatening...
or the offenders waited for a moment of weakness.
the perfect time to attack.
these particular hunters are very seasoned, they're very efficient.
it's no surprise that they've chosen a weapon to be a compound bow.
it requires the utmost precision
and it provides them with a challenge every time.
like the trophy hunter, these men, they plan their killings with care.
they decide the type of victims they want,
how and where they want to kill them, and with what weapon.
hunting is their sport.
humans are their targets.
use every hunter's instinct in your bodies.
good luck.
if they were buying their weapons close to home
we need a list of hunting stores in Spokane county.
let me call you back.
you should hear this.
the newspaper said the F. B. I. was here investigating those homicides.
I didn't know where else to go.
when bobbi didn't show up or call - When was the last time you talked to her? - Yesterday.
she was going to stay with me before this big job interview in Spokane.
she was really excited about it.
so, when she didn't show up, I knew in my gut that something was wrong.
I was the one that convinced her to stay with me, and, now...
this isn't your fault.
OK.
should we get some fresh air?
she's only been missing since last night.
you sure it's related?
I'm not going to wait to find out, I'm going to fax this to gideon.
it's been 3 days since they killed Alex Harrison.
why'd they take another victim so soon?
this is their hunting season.
then they can't waste any time.
only 2 days before it gets crowded around here.
they won't have any more privacy.
if Bobbi Baird is their next victim, she could be on her way.
this is Evans, I need road blocks now.
you got that down good. Man, it reminds me of uncle Joe.
whoa, we got a live one.
get away from me!
get it out!
there you go. - Are--are you done?
what are you doing? - Nobody can hear you.
Yeah, you gotta save your strength.
what the hell do you want from me?
you want to have some fun?
go ahead, you-- you want to tell her?
run.
go!
Bobby Baird's last 2 cell phone connections were both to 911.
looks like each call only lasted a couple of seconds before they dropped out.
she was on highway 2.
it's a dead zone for cell phones.
any idea what the trouble was?
none, cruiser was dispatched to check it out.
but by the time he got there, there was no sign of her or her car.
and speaking of vanishing vehicles, I'm still looking for Alex Harrison'S.
we're standing in the middle of 3 million acres.
she could be anywhere.
we've only got 2 murder sites, miles apart.
there's no pattern yet.
both sites are low lying, they could be tracked from above.
maybe there are blinds built into the trees, or at least access to them.
with good vantage points they could see their prey for miles.
why'd we have to bring all this stuff? Anyone head of Beenie Weenie?
we're not 10 anymore.
help! Help me! Help me!
help, they're coming.
who? - There--there's 2 guys.
they're trying to kill me.
Oh, my god.
run!
she's really a lot faster than we thought.
Yeah, now it's going to get fun.
stop, I can't keep up.
you stay the hell away from her!
Hey, um, look...
I'm really sorry about what happened to your friends, ok?
our friends are dead, and those guys chasing you weren't after us.
well, it doesn't look like it mattered much to them, did it?
look, all I know is if she's around we could be next.
what are we supposed to do? Leave her for those maniacs?
we don't know who she is! What if she did something to them?
2 psychos abducted me. All right?
the next thing I know, I'm running for my life in the woods.
Yeah, that's your story.
all right, look, we're gonna lose daylight.
we got 2 choices, we can either stick together or, or we go our own way.
we should stick together. - What?
you just be sure to keep a good distance between us.
instead of referring to me as she and you, try using my first name.
look, I don't want to know your name.
if anything else happens, I don't want to feel like I ever knew you at all.
what have you got?
uh, there are 3 stores outside Spokane that sell the exact type of arrows you were looking for.
and before you ask, of course I've already sent the addresses to your handheld.
Garcia? You're the man.
Oh, no. You're the man.
do you keep records to document who buys hunting arrows?
after a week we only keep receipts if they pay by credit card.
you get a lot of repeat business up here, don't you?
every year people get their ammo and supplies here，before headin' up to the mountains.
uh, groups of men? Like, uh...
fathers and sons? - Sure.
can I ask you gentlemen, why is this a police matter?
we're looking for 2 men, possibly related.
you might remember them because one always does all the talking,
and the other one would become very uncomfortable if you spoke to him.
it'd be even worse if that person were a female.
well, there are these 2 brothers that have been coming here for years.
they got some supplies here a few days ago.
the younger one's so painfully shy, it's almost sweet.
and after all these years, he still hasn't warmed up to me.
their uncle was a quiet man, he passed away some time ago.
you find a receipt? - No, they paid in cash.
I'm pretty sure their name was Mulford.
I think their uncle's name was Joe.
thank you very much. - I'll call garcia.
Garcia, I need everything you have on a man named Joseph Mulford.
OK, it says here Joseph Mulford was convicted of multiple assault and batteries.
he owned a service station, but it changed hands when he passed away.
he gave it to his nephews, Paul and John Mulford.
I don't have to ask where it's located, do I?
no, you don't.
but since you did, gorgeous grey matter, I'll have you know, I'm pulling it up right now.
and the computer says...
what is it? -That service station...
it's located on highway 2.
let me guess, close to where our victims have gone missing?
bulls-eye.
still no sign of Bobbi Baird.
search teams are in until morning.
we're running out of time.
it's getting dark, I don't know what else we can do.
well, you never know how someone's going to react when they're forced into circumstances like these.
if bobbi's still alive, we just have to hope she's found a safe place for the night.
just, uh, stay close. It'll keep us warm.
did you hear that?
why don't you turn off the light, so they can't see us?
it's probably just an animal or something.
well, something's not good.
whatever that noise is, it's right behind us.
footsteps are too light to be them.
if they were that close, they--they'd just shoot us.
look at them, they look pretty scared.
we should take them now.
no, we wait till first light.
it's more fun when they're not expecting it.
all right.
we've got a missing person's report.
2 couples camping over the weekend didn't show up for work and they didn't check out with the rangers.
I'll organize a search and rescue.
where was their campsite?
several miles from where Alex Harrison's body was found.
do we think there's a connection?
well, if these hunters are looking for more challenges, absolutely.
let's go.
it's still not open, how convenient.
let's take a look around.
it's clear.
it's a mustang.
same make and model as Bobbi Baird.
these are definitely our guys.
no animal did this. That depends on your definition of animal.
looks like somebody shredded it with a knife.
all the supplies have been dumped, not eaten.
they wanted to make sure if anyone found their way back here everything would be worthless.
blood on the ground, 2 spots, here and there.
Hey, guys, we've got blood over here, too.
OK, if I'm standing right up there, this is wide open, and I've got a clear shot at these victims.
it would explain all the blood on the ground.
what about over here? - That's another clear shot.
so, what do we think happened?
2 pools of blood, I say 2 victims.
could be the campers.
uh, question is, where are they now?
what is that?
they've already got one victim in these woods, why'd they attack this couple?
well, maybe they had to.
bobbi Baird's their target if she ran towards voices, well, she had to come right through this camp.
these people were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
they weren't supposed to die.
no, just got in the way.
Hotch found Bobbi Baird's car at Mulford's service station.
hiding them in plain sight.
it run by 2 brothers - You heard of the Mulfords?
we go by first name basis around here.
but you tell me what they're driving, my people will find it.
Oh, my god.
Oh, did you see that? - Oh, ho ho ho!
Luke, look at me! Come on! Don't do this!
help me stop it!
there you go! Told you you'd get your first buck.
we gotta go! - I cannot leave him out here alone!
come on, Heather. Come on.
I can't just leave him.
go! - Come on!
go. Go. - We gotta go.
come on!
come on, it's too easy.
Oh, my god.
come on! Come on!
all right, let's go.
so, what'd they do?
just patrol the highway, looking for broken down cars?
we've got a 210 in progress.
picked up dispatches. - Hey, hotch!
you should see this.
Hey, what color was Alex Harrison's car? - It's blue, why?
I think we found it, along with some others.
if all these have cars...
we're looking at a lot more victims.
I got at least 3 sets of footprints here.
I lose them in the pine needles.
they pick back up over here.
OK, Evans, can we get your team to help us out?
Yeah, Bunting! Help these agents follow the tracks.
everybody in before sundown!
guys, look at this.
first one expired in 1980. - Boys weren't even born yet.
the uncle must have started the killing, the boys have continued the tradition.
what are you doing?
I don't know where we're going. - We can't just stop.
it's part of their game. They love the chase.
as long as we're running, we're just giving them what they want.
we don't get the hell out of here right now, we're both going to die.
not necessarily.
paul and John Mulford, 26 and 22, were orphaned as toddlers.
abandonment issues.
state kept them together by finding their only living relative, their uncle.
he raised his nephews completely off the grid. They never went to school
no socialization other than the patrons of the station.
he was drafted in 1968.
he was only 18 years old.
he was relieved from duty 2 years later, reports of hallucinations and delusions.
the boys were raised with no social compass by the only relative they ever knew.
psychotic possessed with bizarre beliefs, who taught them how to hunt and who to kill.
look at this.
they've been hunting in those woods their whole lives.
it's from her sweater.
No! Don't!
I'm sorry.
whoa, ok, ok. It's ok. It's ok.
you're ok. You're ok.
Johnny, Johnny! Look at me! Look at me!
it's ok. It's ok.
I found the I. D.s of Joel and taylor brause 2 of the missing campers.
married? - Yeah.
this is agent Morgan, go for gideon.
Gideon here, where are you?
we followed the tracks for several miles, and now we can see something in the distance.
can you get to higher ground?
you see it? - Smoke.
you're all right. It's gonna be all right.
I don't think so! - I know--I know so.
but you gotta be strong.
it's a lot of blood. It's just a lot of blood, it's all right.
Oh, god, please, no...
I'm gonna go take care of that friend of ours then I'm gonna come back, come back and we're gonna get you fixed up as good as new.
I promise, I promise. - Ok.
where are you, you son of a bitch?
I'm tired of running!
you're a coward, just like your brother.
I see the fire. It's right through those trees.
there's a man lying next to it.
could just be a couple campers.
let's be prepared if it isn't.
he's covered in blood.
we gotta get him out of here. - I'll call for an evacuation.
son, can you hear me?
my name's Jason Gideon, we're with the F. B. I.
we're gonna get you out of here. Ok?
can you hear me? Are you here alone?
over there.
she's gone.
it's a woman. - She was shot with an arrow.
there's a compound bow about 25 feet away from the body.
what? The other victims were shot in the chest area.
this boy has wounds in his lower abdomen.
you don't think he was shot with an arrow?
it looks like he was stabbed.
son...
are the men who did this to you still in the woods?
we have a team of F. B. I. Agents looking for them.
it's all right.
they've got an order to shoot if necessary.
No! No, no, no. - It's ok, it's ok!
you are safe-- you are safe here.
don't shoot him!
he's all I have.
is your brother out there?
what's your name? - Johnny.
Johnny, you need to tell us where paul is.
before it's too late. Just tell me where he is.
tell me where he is.
he said about half a mile due east. - Let's go.
put down your weapon!
No!
it's ok, it's ok. It's ok, it's ok.
he's clean.
it's ok, it's ok.
you got him? - Yeah.
I'm going to call gideon.
is he dead? - Soon.
how can these guys do something like this?
because they don't think like you and me.
how does it feel, you son of a bitch?
looks like I had all the fun.
awful people they surround you ain't they just like monsters they come to feed on us giant little animals for us.
the british historian James Anthony Froud once said wild animals never kill for sport.
man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself.
you ok?
I've never seen you look so, um-- - Quiet.
what's up?
bobbi Baird asked me a question that's sticking with me.
what was it?
she asked me how they could do it.
how those men could hunt and kill people in the woods.
what did you tell her?
that they don't think like we do.
but...the truth is...
that we do think like them.
Yeah, we do.
because it's our job.
we need to know how it feels.
we hunt these people every day.
the question is, how different are we?
us and them?
this is Richard Valeriani reporting live for CNN from the French aircraft carrier Foch somewhere in the Mediterranean.
six days ago, as the rebellion in Chechnya spread to the neighboring Caucas republics...
the Russian president ordered massive bombing strikes against rebel positions...
around Rutul and Belokany.
appalled at the loss of human life, the President of the United States...
joined by the French president and the British prime minister...
suspended all foreign aid to Russia.
ultranationalist leader Vladimir Radchenko...
denounced the U. S. Pressure as an act of war...
against the Russian Republic and Russian sovereignty.
denouncing his own president as a U. S. Puppet...
he called on the Russian people to join him in revolt.
he said,"This brutish and hypocritical American intervention...
will not go unanswered.
on Tuesday, at 10: 00 in the morning Moscow time...
the Russian parliament was suspended and martial law was declared.
with the government in crisis, the Russian Republic...
was entering into what can only be described as a state of civil war.
then yesterday at dawn, Radchenko and rebel forces...
seized the region around Vladivostok...
including a naval base and a nuclear missile base housing Russian ICBMs.
as regular Russian military forces move in to encircle Radchenko...
allied military forces are in a state ofhigh alert.
these French planes taking off behind me...
have been deployed near the Caucasus since the beginning of the crisis.
and the crisis which started in the Caucasus...
has now spread to the Far East...
and appears to be turning into the worst standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.
this is Richard Valeriani reporting live for CNN from the French aircraft carrier Foch, somewhere in the Mediterranean.
crimson Tide - Abracadabra! - I-I-I-I can't hear you.
Ooh! - Oh, he shot fire!
I need a volunteer... - Me! Me!
uh, uh, me, me, me, me, me! - Me! Me! Me!
a brave volunteer.
me! Me!
preferably... Preferably somebody who was born...
on October 18, Nineteen hundred and ninety - Me! Me! Me!
that's you, honey. That's you. - Me! Me!
me! - Over here? Over here?
ahh, you must be the birthday girl. What's your name? - Robin.
russian ultranationalist leader, backed by his rebel army...
threatened nuclear attack on the United States and Japan.
the threats come as a response to the United States' involvement in Chechnya...
and are not considered idle.
now, sit on the board and tell me, Robin, do you believe in magic? Good.
because if you believe in magic...
we can suspend you in the air... - Be right back.
without the help of a flying carpet. - Meeting in an emergency session...
come on. You'll miss your daughter's levitation. - While the President is sequestered...
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
that footage was taken yesterday, but half an hour ago...
surrounded by hostile forces, rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...
threatened to use nuclear arms... - Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.
on the United States and Japan...
should anyone, including the Russian Army, attempt to move in on him.
based on the history of this man, this cannot be viewed as an idle threat.
it is.
commander Hunter.
Annapolis. Five patrols on fast attacks.
two on boomers: One as X. O.
hmm. A year at...
excuse me. Harvard.
I talked to your former C. O. He tells me he tried to adopt you.
as you no doubt heard, my X. O. Has appendicitis.
he's the best I ever had.
I need a good man to fill his spot.
your name was at the top of the list. - Well, that's good to know, sir.
it was a short list.
your interests, Mr. Hunter. What do you like to do? Do you, uh...
do you paint, play ball, play an instrument, ride motorcycles? Wh-What?
ride horses. - Horses.
what's the best horse you ever rode? - Arabian, sir.
an Arabian? Now, that's a powerful animal.
Yes.
you ever ridden one? - Who, me? Are you kidding?
Nah, I couldn't handle an Arabian. Yeah, just give me an old paint.
Yeah, horses are fascinating animals.
dumb as fence posts but very intuitive.
in that way, they're not too different from high school girls.
they might not have a brain in their head, but they do know all the boys want to fuck 'em.
you don't have to be able to read Ulysses to know where they're coming from.
no, sir.
he approves of you.
Jack Russells. Smartest dogs alive.
name's Bear. Goes every place with me.
well, welcome aboard the Alabama, son.
do me proud. - I will, sir.
congratulations, Mr. Hunter. - Thank you.
if one Russian citizen is killed, and I am president...
then I will kill 900, 000 of the people who are responsible.
you'd use nuclear weapons? - Yes, I would hit them...
attention!
at ease. Be seated.
I take it you've seen enough?
gentlemen, after a nice little vacation, looks like we're back at it again.
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because as of now, we're back in business.
in the good old days of the Cold War, the Russians could always be depended on...
doing whatever was in their own best interest.
but this Radchenko's playing a whole new ball game...
with a whole new set of rules.
now, I've heard people talk, but I don't think this man's talking...
just to get his picture in the paper.
he seems to have a serious weed up his ass and a legitimate gripe.
always a dangerous combination.
and I think he's capable of doing every damn thing he says he's going to do.
that's why we have to go out there and give the man a moment of pause.
so ends theory. Thus, let us begin the facts.
we've been informed by the NSA that an entire rebel corps of the Russian Army is involved.
that's four armored divisions numbering 60, 000 men.
there seems to be massive defections.
vladimir appears to be winning the hearts and minds of the Russian soldiers.
Admiral?
thank you.
they've seized the region by the Chinese and North Korea borders.
that includes a submarine base...
from which they've surged four Akula-class attack subs.
they have acquired a nuclear base at Artem...
that houses 25 hardened silos for Russian ICBMs...
armed with up to ten warheads apiece.
now, the Russian government has assured us that talks are under way.
they claim that Radchenko forces...
do not possess the launch codes.
but if Radchenko were to crack them...
they could launch against our west coast direct...
or come in over the Pole, take out Washington and New York.
the Commander-in-Chief has directed U. S. Military forces...
to set DEFCON four.
we've been ordered to get under way at 0600 hours...
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific, the Far Eastern TVD target package.
please keep your men informed. Lieutenant Commander Hunter is our new X. O.
please bring him up to speed on ship's personnel and supplies. Admiral?
no, that's it. - On your feet.
holy shit. - Wow.
here we go again, Commander. - Thank you.
you bet. Hey, Bobby. This is Bobby Dougherty, Supplies.
pleasure to meet you. - Mr. Dougherty. - Billy Linkletter, TSO.
Hey. - Mr. Linkletter. - Commander.
and, uh, you know Darik. - Yes. Westergaurd.
Hey. - Long time no see. - Yeah. How's Julia? - She's excellent.
good. - And, uh, Roy Zimmer, Communications.
Mr. Zimmer. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you.
uh, we served together on the Baton Rouge. - Twice.
that's right. And, uh, we're lucky to have him.
I think his dog gave me the final seal of approval.
he's crazy about that dog. Takes him everywhere.
the Navy looks the other way 'cause he's Ramsey.
the Navy looks the other way 'cause he's one of the few skippers left...
who've actually seen some combat. - Hey, he took SEALS into Panama in '89.
tomahawks in the Gulf in '91. - Took out what? Eight or nine X. O. S in '94?
Ouch. - Last one caught... What was it? Appendicitis?
Yeah, right.
the Enemy Below.
robert Mitchum. - And?
and what? Robert Mitchum. - Incomplete answer.
what, the German guy with the white hair? - Yeah. What's his name?
who was it? - Curt Jurgens. - No.
right over there!
Bye-bye. I love you!
hardy Kruger. - No way.
robert Shaw in his Nazi period.
question is invalid. We're even.
how you doing? - Hi. I'm fine. Thanks. - Good.
address me as "sir" when you speak to me! Stand at attention, sailor!
is he gonna fit in the sub? - Doubtful.
who played the German sub commander in The Enemy Below with Robert Mitchum?
was it CurtJurgens or Hardy Kruger? - Sir?
wrong answer! Drop down and give me 20! Now!
move! Move!
run Silent, Run Deep. - Three.
the guy with the ears... And the little moustache.
Cary Grant.
I'm worried about T.
Why? - She doesn't know what's going on.
I think she thinks I'm going away forever.
I'll take care of her.
you will? - Yeah. - You promise?
I promise.
I love you, Dad. - I love you too, son.
okay. Um.
you know I don't know what to say. - Just say good-bye.
see you in my dreams.
give me a kiss.
Mmm.
Davis. - How you doing, sir?
crew present and accounted for, sir!
little ducks...
there's trouble in Russia.
so they called us.
and we're going over there...
and bringing the most lethal killing machine ever devised.
we're capable of launching more firepower...
than has ever been released in the history of war.
for one purpose alone:
to keep our country safe.
we constitute the front line...
and the last line of defense.
I expect and demand...
your very best.
anything less, you should have joined the Air Force.
this might be our Commander-in-Chief's Navy...
but this is my boat.
and all I ask is that you keep up with me.
and if you can't...
that strange sensation you'll be feeling in the seat of your pants...
will be my boot in your ass!
Mr. Cob? - Yes, sir!
you're aware of the name of this ship, aren't you, Mr. Cob?
very aware, sir!
it bears a proud name, doesn't it, Mr. Cob? - Very proud, sir!
it represents fine people. - Very fine people, sir!
who live in a fine, outstanding state. - Outstanding, sir!
in the greatest country in the entire world.
in the entire world, sir!
and what is that name, Mr. Cob? - Alabama, sir!
and what do we say? Go,'Bama! - Go,'Bama!
roll tide!
chief of the boat, dismiss the crew.
dismiss the crew. Aye, aye, sir!
crew! Department heads! Attend to your departments!
fall out!
here.
part of your qualification for command.
Ahh.
my last breath of polluted air for the next 65 days.
gonna miss it. I don't trust air I can't see.
this is my favorite part. Right here, right now.
Bravo, Hunter.
sir?
you knew to shut up and enjoy the view.
most eggheads want to talk it away.
your stock just went up a couple of points.
thank you, sir.
allow me to give you a tiny bit of advice.
if you want your own boat some day...
the very worst thing you can do is worry about yourself or try to impress me.
I can't stand save-asses, and I won't abide kiss-asses.
you keep your priorities straight: Your mission and your men.
how do you like that cigar?
it's good, sir. - It's your first. - Yeah.
don't like it too much. They're more expensive than drugs.
X. O.take her down. - Take her down. Aye, sir.
Control/Bridge: Sounding.
Bridge/Control: Sounding 130 fathoms.
lookouts, clear the bridge. - Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.
officer of the deck, prepare to dive.
captain's down. - Captain is down.
X. O. Down. - X. O. Is down.
submerge the ship. - Diving Officer, submerge the ship.
make your depth 150 feet. - Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.
chief of the watch, on the 1 MC, dive, dive!
make your depth 150 feet.
five degree down bubble.
I don't understand. - What don't you understand?
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay? He's a potential Hitler.
somebody should just step up and shoot him. - I have no problem with that.
good. - Well, it's fanatics who make history.
hell, Patton was a fanatic. - It's what made him great.
you think this guy is Patton?
he's a dangerous lunatic and he's threatening nuclear war, and he means it.
what's that make us, since we're the only nation to ever drop a nuclear bomb on anyone?
it makes us a prime target.
I mean, there's half a dozen other Third World countries with atom bombs...
who'd love to drop one on us.
that's right. That's why we should drop one on them.
what are you, a communist?
you have a problem with us dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?
shut up, Dougherty.
you think it was a mistake, Mr. Hunter? - Sir?
using the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
well, if I thought that, sir, I wouldn't be here.
interesting way you put that. - How'd I put it, sir?
very carefully.
you do qualify your remarks.
if somebody asked me if we should have bombed Japan...
a simple "Yes, by all means, sir, drop that fucker." Twice.
I don't mean to suggest that you're indecisive, Mr. Hunter.
not at all.
just, um, complicated.
of course, that's the way the Navy wants you.
me, they wanted simple.
well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
be careful there, Mr. Hunter.
it's all I got to rely on: Bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.
rickover gave me my command, a checklist...
a target and a button to push.
all I had to know is how to push it. They'd tell me when.
they seem to want you to know why.
I would hope they'd want us all to know why, sir.
at the Naval War College, it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors, not 19th-century philosophy.
war is a continuation of politics by other means.
von Clausewitz.
I think, uh, sir, that what he was actually trying to say was a little more...
complicated?
y-yes, the purpose of war is, is to serve a political end...
but the true nature of war is to serve itself. - I'm very impressed.
in other words, the sailor most likely to win the war...
is the one most willing to part company with the politicians...
and ignore everything except the destruction of the enemy.
uh, you'd agree with that? - Well...
I'd agree that, uh...
that's what Clausewitz was trying to say.
but you wouldn't agree with it? - No, sir, I do not.
no, l-I just think that in the nuclear world...
the true enemy can't be destroyed.
attention on deck. Von Clausewitz will now tell us exactly who the real enemy is.
von?
in my humble opinion...
in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.
fire in the galley! Fire in the galley! Chief of the watch, sound the general alarm!
forward damage control, bring additional fire extinguishers to the...
fire's out of control. He's hurtin'. - You hit the kill switch?
couldn't get to it. Too hot.
attention, all hands. The fire has been contained.
damage control party, assess damage and report to Control.
initiate weapons system readiness test. - Aye, sir.
all right, station a reflash watch. This thing could flare back up again.
Conn/Radio: We are receiving flash traffic emergency action message.
recommend alert one. Recommend alert one.
alert one, alert one. Man battle stations missile for weapons systems readiness test.
spin up all missiles. - What the hell is he running a missile drill now for?
you're in charge. - Aye, sir.
man battle stations missiles for weapons system readiness test.
spin up all missiles. This is an exercise.
captain's in Control!
I agree. The message is properly formatted.
sir, we have a properly formatted emergency action message...
for weapons system readiness test, sir.
I concur, sir. - Where's the X. O?
sir. - Good of you to make it, Mr. Hunter.
get the authenticator. - Get the authenticator.
let's go.
sir, request permission to authenticate.
permission granted. Authenticate.
captain, message is authentic. - I concur, sir.
I agree. - Message is authentic.
sir, your captain's missile key.
set condition 1 SQ for WSRT. This is the captain. This is an exercise.
set condition 1 SQ for WSRT. This is the X. O. This is an exercise.
captain, that fire in the galley could still flare... - Now is not the time.
make your depth 150 feet. All stop.
make my depth 150 feet. All stop. Aye, sir.
Weapons/Conn: Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.
Weapons/Conn: Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.

come on, guys. Let's go!
Weapons/Captain: Report approximate time for 1 SQ.
Captain/Weapons: Approximate time to weapons system 1 SQ:
fourteen minutes, sir.
ship is at launch depth. Ready to hover, sir.
very well. Commence hovering. - Commence hovering. Aye, sir.
Control/Sick Bay: Chief Petty Officer Marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.
we're beginning CPR. - Chief of the watch, on the 1 MC.
gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
we've received word that one of our shipmates is experiencing a medical problem.
we're terminating the drill. Mr. Mahoney, take the conn. I'm going below.
X. O. - Aye, sir. I have the conn.
clear.
clear.
it's okay, Chief.
thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.
so, Mr. Hunter, do you think I was wrong to run that drill?
not necessarily, sir. - Do you think I got that man killed?
no, sir. One thing had nothing to do with the other. It was an accident.
would you have run the drill? - No, sir, I wouldn't have.
why not?
the fire in the galley could have flared back up. I would have seen to it first, sir.
I'm sure you would have.
me, on the other hand, I tend to think that that's the best time to run a drill.
confusion on the ship is nothing to fear.
it should be taken advantage of.
lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are a ship of war, designed for battle.
you don't just fight battles when everything is hunky-dory.
What'd you think, son? I was just some crazy old coot...
putting everyone in harm's way as I yelled "yee-haw"?
that was not my first thought, sir.
but there's no excuse. At the time I was fighting the fire in the galley...
I did not agree with your call, sir.
take a seat.
just so we understand each other...
I don't have any problems with questions or doubts.
as I said to you before, I'm not seeking the company of kiss-asses.
when you got something to say to me, you say it in private.
and if privacy doesn't permit itself, then you bite your fucking tongue.
are we clear about that, Commander? - As a bell, sir.
those sailors out there are just boys...
boys who are training to do a terrible and unthinkable thing.
and if that ever occurs, the only reassurance they'll have...
that they're doing the proper thing...
is gonna derive from their unqualified belief in the unified chain of command.
that means we don't question each other's motives in front of the crew.
it means we don't undermine each other.
it means in a missile drill...
they hear your voice right after mine, without hesitation.
do you agree with that policy, sailor? - Absolutely, sir.
we're here to preserve democracy, not to practice it.
there'll be a memorial service in the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.
go see to it. - Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, Hunter.
short of the outbreak of World War III...
the ship sinking or being attacked by a giant octopus...
I'd like to be undisturbed for the next 30 minutes. - I'll see to it, sir.
by the way, it was Marichek's 300 pounds that killed him.
not the fire.
dismissed.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
does it make any sense to you to start a drill in the middle of a fire?
fire was out, wasn't it? - Yeah, and a man died too.
not 'cause of what the captain did. - What?
not 'cause of what the captain did. - Weps.
a fire is a serious threat to the ship. Now, where was he?
why didn't he check it out first, huh?
that's his style. He's a hard-ass.
so what? - So you wanna fight him, go ahead.
you wanna get along, you gotta get to understand him a little bit.
two schools of thought here.
to him, you're Annapolis, Harvard...
expert on theory, well-versed in world affairs. - Ha!
he's had his head up his ass drivin' ships for the last 25 years.
he's probably a little paranoid about that.
I mean, Navy's all he's got.
navy and that little rat-dog of his.
that's why his wife left him.
so what are you saying?
I'm just saying watch out, give him a little room.
let him get to know you.
you do pants too?
Conn/Radio: Receiving emergency action message.
recommend alert one. Recommend alert one.
alert one! Alert one! Incoming emergency action message!
alert one. Alert one. Incoming EAM.
captain.
captain has asked me to brief you on the emergency action message we just received.
as you know, before we got under way...
the Russian Army was in position and circling the rebel camps...
and Radchenko started making extravagant threats should anyone move in on him...
that he would launch his land-based nuclear weapons at the United States and at Japan.
the only safeguard was that the Russian government controlled the launch codes.
intel now indicates that those launch codes have been compromised.
and U. S. Military forces have been directed to set DEFCON three.
the last time we hit this state of emergency was 32-and-a-half years ago...
during the Cuban missile crisis.
so this is what it's all about, gentlemen. It's what we've trained for.
captain.
the NCA has determined that...
should our satellites detect rebel missiles being fueled...
which means they could be launched in just over one hour...
we'll be compelled to act.
now, given our patrol sector here in the Emperor Sea Mounts...
it seems clear that our friends in the Pentagon...
are setting us up for a potential preemptive strike.
it's important to remain focused.
keep your men informed.
any questions?
dismissed.
we lost that frying unit, and then, uh, we...
we can't get the same capacity in here any more.
I'm gonna fuck you up! - Get out! Get...
get out of here, man! Get him out! - Motherfucker!
fuckin' dirty piece of shit! - Bennefield, you crazy, man?
whoa. - All right.
Rivetti, what's up? - I'm sorry, sir.
it's just a difference of opinion that got out of hand. - What about?
it's really too silly to talk about, sir. I'd rather just forget about...
I don't give a damn about what you'd rather forget about. Why were you two fighting?
well, I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer was the only real Silver Surfer...
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer was shit.
and Bennefield's a big Moebius fan, and, uh...
things got out of hand. I pushed him: He pushed me.
I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry. - Rivetti, you're a supervisor.
you can get a commission like that.
I know it, sir. You're 100 percent right.
uh, it'll never happen again, all right? - It better not happen again.
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'm gonna write you up. You understand? Do you understand?
Yes, sir. - You have to set an example even in the face of stupidity.
everybody that reads comic books knows that Kirby's Silver Surfer is the only true Silver Surfer.
now, am I right or wrong? - Y... You're right, sir.
all right. Get out of here. - Yes, sir.
captain. - How can I help you?
test results from the missile drill.
this the best they can do? - No, sir, but that's what they did.
I want this down to five minutes. Train on it. - Yes, sir.
you tell your buddy Weps we're gonna do it again.
we're gonna keep on doing it until he gets it right. Damn.
feels like the whole crew needs a kick in the ass.
or a pat on the back, sir.
I just witnessed a fight down in crew's mess. No big deal, but...
I think the men are...
a little on edge with all we're going through.
morale seems to be a bit low.
well, you seem to have the pulse of the men.
thank you, sir.
may I have your attention, please? - Summer's here and the time is right - Mr. Hunter has brought it to my attention... - For dancin'in the streets that morale may be a bit low...
that you may be a bit...
on edge, sir. - On edge.
so I suggest this:
any crew member who feels he can't handle this situation...
can leave the ship right now.
gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three. War is imminent.
this is the captain.
that is all.
very inspiring, sir.
come on, Bear. Come on. Come on.
Supe? Come here.
you hear that?
I've got a broadband contact bearing 047.

best step for evasion, sir, is 831 feet...
to avoid that sub.
lieutenant Mahoney, this is the captain.
increase your speed to standard. Come left to course 270.
make your depth 831 feet, smartly.
you find out who that is. - Aye, sir.
who are you, sweetheart?

Conn/Radio: Sir, we're out of VLF radio range. Full message capacity is cut off.
Radio/Conn: Extend extremely low frequency antenna.
passing 600 feet. Coming to 831 feet, sir.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God, uh... Conn/Sonar: Uh, sir, we have his classification.
mark that tape. Get the classification on your monitor.
Rivetti, what the hell is going on? - Sir, the master 28...
is classified as a Russian Akula-class hunter-killer.
bearing 196, sir! He's close, but I don't think he's spotted us.
stay on him! - Aye, sir.
captain has the conn. - Passing 800 feet, sir.
continue to dive. Give me five degree down bubble.
continue rigging for ultra-quiet. - Aye, aye, sir.
five degree down bubble. Rigging for ultra-quiet, sir.
gentlemen, this is the captain.
we have an Akula-class submarine out there.
we know that Radchenko controls at least four submarines. This could be one of them.
russian rebels have threatened a launch against our country...
and are fueling right now.
they will have launch capability in 60 minutes.
we also have orders to launch our missiles, which is exactly what we're going to do.
we are rigging for ultra-quiet. All hands be ready.
this is as real as it gets.
we'll presume nothing, defend ourselves at all cost.
if that sub so much as comes around or opens up a tube door, we're gonna take her out.
passing 900 feet.
he's gone. - Like hell he is. He's up there.

Conn/Weapons: Missile systems ready to launch in 11 minutes.
Conn/Radio: Receiving transmission on extremely low frequency receiver, sir.
very well. Mr. Hunter, go to Radio, please.
okay, pull up the code. - What do you got?
X. O.incoming EAM on the broadcast...
but we're too deep to receive any radio communication, sir.
captain. - X. O.
we got a limited radio transmission indicating an incoming EAM.
we need to go shallow to reestablish communications.
with that sub still up there?
Mr. Hunter, it's my inten...
come up to the conn, Mr. Hunter. - Yes, sir.
zero bubble. - Zero bubble. Aye, sir. 1, 275 feet, sir.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems ready to launch in 10 minutes.
sir. - Attention, all hands.
ship has been rigged for ultra-quiet. - Captain?
when our missile system is ready, Mr. Hunter, it is my intention...
to rise to launch depth, launch our birds and then get the hell out of there.
not until then.
I can't jeopardize the safety of this ship. - Yes, sir.
may I suggest that we float the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.
that should give us enough reach to receive the EAM transmission, sir.
very well. Float the buoy.
chief of the watch, float the buoy. - Float the radio buoy. Aye, sir.
radio buoy deploying, sir. Tension 2, 000 pounds.
very well.
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time of 1 SQ: Eight minutes, 30 seconds, sir.
the winch! - Conn/Sonar: We have a sound short from the buoy winch!
stop the goddamn winch!
the winch is stopped, sir!
goddamn it.
Tso, is that sound still out there? - Sonar/TSO: Is that sound still out there?
sound's gone, sir.
I'm getting something.
supe, he's coming around! - Conn/Sonar: The Akula's turning toward, sir.
Conn/Sonar: Torpedo in the water bearing 241!
Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo in the water bearing 242!

300 yards and closing, sir!
first, the first torpedo's going after the countermeasures!
they missed! They missed!
Sonar/Conn, Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo incoming! It's gonna be close!
Conn/Sonar: The Akula's disappeared in the thermal, sir.

well, keep looking. He's out there looking for us. - Aye, sir.
Weapons/Conn: Estimated time to 1 SQ.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems ready to launch in six minutes.
very well. - Main seawater pump is out of commission.
Mr. Zimmer, where's that EAM?
you all right, son? - Yes, sir. - I got it.
that's it? - Uh, uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.
we lost it when the radio buoy cable got severed. - All right.
all right, gentlemen, let's get on with it. All ahead one-third.
steady as you go.
all ahead one-third. Steady. Aye, sir.
make your depth 150 feet.
zero bubble. Up slow and silent to launch depth.
up slow and silent to launch depth. Aye, aye, Captain.
captain? Got the EAM.
what do you think? - I think there's nothing on this.
Yes, sir. It, uh, it got cut off during the attack.
then it's meaningless.
sir, this is an EAM pertaining to nuclear missile launch. - No, Mr. Hunter.
that's a message fragment. - Because it got cut off during the attack, sir.
the message could mean anything. It could be a message to abort.
it could be a message that... - It could be a fake Russian transmission.
which is exactly why we need to confirm, sir.
all I'm asking for is the time we need to get back on line. - Calm down, Mr. Hunter.
I am calm. - You don't appear to be calm.
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems ready to launch in four minutes.
step aside, seaman. - Yes, sir.
we have orders in hand, and those orders are to make a preemptive launch.
every second that we lose increases the chances that by the time our missiles arrive...
their silos could be empty 'cause they've flown their birds and struck us first.
Yes, sir. - You know as well as I do that any launch order...
received without authentication is no order at all.
ye... Captain... - That's our number-one rule. - National Mili...
that rule is the basis for the scenario we've trained on time and time again.
Yes, sir. - It's a rule we follow without exception.
captain, National Military Command Center knows what sector we're in.
they have satellites looking down on us to see if our birds are aloft...
and if they're not then they give our orders to somebody else.
that's why we maintain more than one sub. It's what they call "redundancy.
I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter. - All I'm saying...
all I'm saying, Captain, is that we have backup.
now, it's our duty not to launch until we can confirm.
you're presuming that we have other submarines out there ready to launch.
well, as captain I must assume that our submarines could've been taken out by other Akulas.
we can play these games all night, Mr. Hunter, but I don't have the luxury of your presumptions.
sir... - Mr. Hunter, we have rules that are not open to interpretation...
personal intuition, gut feelings...
hairs on the back of your neck, little devils or angels sitting on your shoulders.
captain... - We're all very well aware of what our orders are...
and what those orders mean.
they come down from our Commander-in-Chief. They contain no ambiguity.
captain... - Mr. Hunter, I've made the decision.
I'm captain of this boat. Now shut the fuck up!
damn.
Weapons/Conn: Shift targeting to target package SLBM 64741/2.
this is the captain.
captain, I cannot concur. - Repeat my command.
sir, we don't know what this message means. Our target package could have changed.
you repeat this order or I'll find somebody who will!
hell, no, you won't, sir. - You're relieved of your position.
cob, remove Mr. Hunter from the control room. Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here right now! - No, sir. No, sir.
no, sir, I do not concur and I do not recognize your authority to relieve me on the command under Navy regulations.
cob, arrest this man and get him out of here! - Captain Ramsey...
under the operating procedures governing the release of nuclear weapons...
we cannot launch our missiles unless both you and I agree. - Cob!
what are you waiting for? - Now, this is not a formality, sir!
this is expressly why your command must be repeated.
it requires my assent. I do not give it.
and furthermore, you continue upon this course...
and insist upon this launch without confirming this message first... - Son of a bitch!
I will be forced... - Chief of the boat! - Backed by the rules of precedents...
as captain and commanding officer... - authority and command of the USS Alabama, I order you... - regulation 08150H6...
to place the X. O. Under arrest on the charge of mutiny! - Of the Navy regulations...
I say again, I order you to place the X. O. Under arrest... - to relieve you of command, Captain!
on the charge of mutiny!
Cob! - Captain, please. The X. O. Is right.
we can't launch unless he concurs.
to the USS Alabama:
rebel controlled missiles being fueled.
launch codes compromised. Dissidents threaten launch at continental United States.
set DEFCON 2.
immediately launch ten Trident missile sorties.
they're fueling their missiles! We don't have time to fuck around!
sir, I think you need time to think this over.
I don't have to think this over!
captain, I relieve you of your command of this ship.
cob, escort the captain to his stateroom.
I'm assuming command. - You're not assuming anything.
chief of the boat, Captain Ramsey's under arrest!
lock him in his stateroom. - Captain, please...
now, Cob! - Aye, sir.
Mitchell. Walker. Take the captain below.
you're way out of your league, Hunter.
you're not ready to make tough decisions yet.
what the hell are we waiting for?
anybody here disagrees with what I've done...
then you feel free to relieve yourself of duty now.
anybody?
all right.
all stations. - Aye, sir.
this is the executive officer.
I've assumed command of this ship under authority granted me by Navy regulations.
I have relieved Captain Ramsey of his duties...
for acting in contravention of the rules and regulations...
regarding nuclear weapons release.
it is my intention to delay the missile launch...
maintaining our current state of readiness...
pending confirmation of an emergency action message that was cut off during the attack.
remain at battle stations missile.
carry on.
what the hell are we doin', Fred? - I don't know about you, but I'm pissing my pants.
come on, boy.
Conn/Weapons: Russians will have missile launch capability in 39 minutes.
chief of the boat.
sir?
thank you, Cob. - "Thank you"?
fuck you. Get it straight, Mr. Hunter. I'm not on your side.
now, you could be wrong.
but wrong or right, the captain can't just replace you at will.
that was completely improper, and that's why I did what I did.
by the book. - I thank you anyway.
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, get those communications back on line now.
we're working on it, sir. Aye, aye, Captain.
are you ready? - Uh, ready. Go.
Jesus Christ. - Fuckin' thing. - Come on. This whole system is crashed.
radio buoy is severed. What the fuck does he want us to do? - Shit electrons?
Hey, Vossler, we need communications, not smart-ass remarks. - Aye, sir.
all stop, ten degrees up. - Ten up. Aye, sir.
all stop. Aye, sir. Enters all stop.
Conn/Sonar: Holy shit, sir! He's right on top of us! He's turning toward!
range. - 600 yards.
Conn/Sonar: Torpedoes in the water! Bearing 048, 050!
left full rudder! - Left full rudder! Aye, sir! - All ahead full, zero bubble.
sir, don't you want to fire back? Torpedoes are ready, sir.
no, we're in too close. Our weapons won't have time to arm. All ahead flank!
chief of the watch to Maneuvering, give me max speed now! - Maximum speed. Aye, sir!
Sonar/Conn: Let me know when our range to that Akula is open to 1, 000 yards!
Conn/Sonar: Aye, sir!
goddamn it, let's just shoot this fucker. What's 1, 000 yards for?
cause it takes 1, 000 yards for the torpedoes to arm.
Jesus, who'd you fuck to get on this ship?
Conn/Sonar: Torpedoes 150 yards and closing fast, sir!
bearing 070, 074!
launch port countermeasures!
countermeasures away, sir! - Rig ship for impact! - Rig ship for impact! Aye, sir!
they missed! They missed! - Yeah!
they passed astern! They were too close to arm, sir!
Conn/Sonar: Range to the Akula: 950 yards and opening fast!
go to manual on the arming mechanisms, tubes two and four.
snapshot, two and four. - Snapshot, two and four. Tubes fired electrically, sir.
Sonar/Conn: Give me exact ranging and speed on our weapons.
range: 300 yards at 50 knots, sir!
200 yards, 50 knots!
100 yards, 55 knots!
75 yards! Weapons ready for arming, sir!
steady course 231. - Aye, sir. 231.
arm torpedoes two and four...
now! - Torpedoes armed, sir!
we're locked on the Akula!
you got him, sir! You got him!
Yeah! - Whoo!
Conn/Sonar: Incoming torpedo. They must've got one off before they got hit, sir.
right full rudder. Launch starboard countermeasures.
countermeasures away, sir. - Dive!
make your depth 1, 200 feet! - Point it down now! Take her deep! Take her deep!
full dive on those planes! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
hang on, everybody!
is everybody okay? - Yeah!
open aft the main drain suction!
start the drain pump! Go, go, go!
all stations make damage report to Control.
Oh, shit! - Control, this is Bilge Bay!
we've got out-of-control flooding! Request damage control!
Mr. Mahoney, get a damage control party down there! - Aye, sir.
forward damage control party, get Lieutenant Hellerman!
flooding in the bilge bay! Get him down there now!
Conn/Maneuvering: We've lost propulsion, sir!
chief of the boat, how are we doing? - Sir, we are going down! I need propulsion!
forward ballast tanks are damaged, sir!
forward air pressure: Zero!
Maneuvering/Conn: Restore propulsion as soon as possible.
Conn/Maneuvering: Restoring propulsion as soon as possible. Aye, sir!
Control/Bilge Bay: Flooding has slowed!
I think we got it under control, sir! - Passing 1, 500 feet.
at 1, 850 it's all over.
passing 1, 600 feet.
Barnes, get over here! Help me with this loose valve!
passing 1, 650 feet.
what the fuck's going on? - Take it easy!
Conn/Bilge Bay: Flooding has recommenced!
it looks like three men are trapped!
bilge Bay/Conn: Try and get those men out of there as soon as you can and seal that bay.
sir, if we don't seal the bilge bay now, we'll lose the ship.
bilge Bay/Conn: Can you get the men out?
sir, there's no fucking way! If I go down there, I'll never get out!
Barnes, come on! You gotta come!
move! Move! Barnes, come on, come on! You can do it! Move it!
bilge Bay/Conn: Seal that bay.
Barnes, let's go! Come on! I gotta close the hatch!
what the fuck are we doing here?
bilge Bay/Conn: I say again, seal that bay!
sir, there are men down there and they're gonna drown!
lieutenant Hellerman, you have your orders.
now seal the goddamn bay before we all go down!
Barnes! Please get the fuck out!
Barnes!
come on! Barnes!
Conn/Bilge Bay:
seawater hatch is sealed, sir!
very well.
passing 1, 800 feet.

and rising.
propulsion limit. Ahead full, sir! - Full ahead steam.
take us up to periscope depth. - Aye, aye, sir.
give me five.
all right, we're living. We're livin', gentlemen.
step aside, Tommy. - I'm sorry, sir.
the X. O. Ordered us... - Fuck the X. O!
the ship has been hit, and I'm going in to see my captain.
now stand aside.
stand aside!
captain.
sir. - How bad is it, Mr. Dougherty?
it's bad, sir.
I've just been looking at Hunter's file here.
closest to combat he's been is a policy seminar.
give me an order, sir.
as quietly as you can, you get to Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Westergaurd.
how about Linkletter?
Nah, you won't be able to talk to the TSO. He's at the conn.
but you can get to Weps. We gotta have Weps. He's the key.
you get me those men, a small security force, then come back and get me.
aye, sir. - Don't get overzealous now and try to recruit the whole ship.
we'll lead from the top down. - Aye, sir. Right away.
can I talk to you in the passageway?
right now, Pete. Come on.
what's goin' on? - We're not gonna let this go down with the X. O. At the helm.
we're not? - No, we're not. - I been with the captain for years...
and this asshole Hunter shows up, and I'm supposed to follow him 'cause he says so?
you're not supposed to: You've been ordered to.
that's what this is about: Proper orders.
proper orders? He has proper orders. He won't act on them.
he's in command now!
if they order him to launch, we'll launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.
but I'd rather go down myself than get this one wrong.
look, our procedures are clear.
in the absence of a contravening order, in a situation like this, we follow the orders in hand.
exactly. You know how many checks we go through to make sure a launch order is authentic?
the X. O. Agreed with those orders.
now he just wants to throw them away? They don't count?
he's lost his nerve. - Bullshit!
I know this guy, Bobby! - You... - Weps, we've been ordered to launch.
now, why in the world would we do that if they weren't prepared to launch at us?
we don't know that for sure! That's the whole point!
that's why he wants time to confirm the message.
that's the whole fucking point is we don't have time!
Radchenko is fueling his birds. Now, why do you think he's doing that? Why?
you don't put on a condom unless you're gonna fuck.
go back to your station. - Excuse me. - Go back to your station and stay there.
come on, man.
Peter, think about your family, man.
I am. I am!
I mean, what do you... what do you plan to do?
nothing without you. You're senior officer department head.
the TSO's with Hunter. - And you have the keys to the small arms locker.
now, we wanna recruit a few more men, and then we're gonna open up that arsenal.
I just talked to the captain in his room.
he specifically asked for you. He says we cannot go without you.
I don't believe this.
this is a mutiny, Peter. There's only two sides to a mutiny.
now, your captain is asking for your help.
what are you gonna do?
what are you gonna do?
all right.
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will have launch capability in 24 minutes.
you're doing the right thing.
electrical power has been restored.
all stations prepare to reinitiate the system.
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, what's the status on that radio repair?
Conn/Radio: All systems are still down, sir. Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.
where is he? - I don't know, sir.
very well.
Mr. Mahoney has the conn.
aye, sir. I have the conn. - Cob. - Sir.
send a man to find Zimmer. - Aye, sir.
get a side arm. - Aye, aye, sir.
chief Young. - Aye, Chief.
turn around! Move it!
at ease, sailor.
sir. - Thank you, Mr. Ince.
Mr. Westergaurd. - Sir.
Mr. Zimmer. - Ready, sir.
let's get on with it.
stand guard.
all you people return to your stations!
Mr. Rivetti. - Sir?
follow me, please. - Yes, sir.
is there a problem, sir?
these are the keys to the entire submarine.
Conn/Weapons:
russian missiles will have launch capability in 21 minutes.
who's in charge here?
shit!
me, sir. Oh, fuck.
how long is it gonna take? - I don't know, sir.
do you know what's going on here? - Yes, sir.
no, I don't think you do. Let me explain it to you.
if we launch and we're wrong, what's left of Russia is gonna launch at us.
there will be a nuclear holocaust beyond imagination.
so it's all about knowing, Mr. Vossler.
we have to know whether or not our order to launch has been recalled or not.
the only way we're gonna know is if you fix that radio. You understand me?
Yes, sir.
you ever watch Star Trek?
Yeah, of course I seen Star Trek. - Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.
the USS Enterprise. - Yeah. - The whole... All right.
you remember when the Klingons were gonna blow up the Enterprise...
and Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty. He says,"Scotty, I gotta have more power."
he needs more, more warp speed. - Warp speed. Exactly. - Yeah.
well, I'm Captain Kirk, you're Scotty. I need more power.
I'm telling you, if you do not get this radio up, a billion people are gonna die.
now it's all up to you. I know that's a shitty deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?
Scotty.
aye, Captain.
you got anything? - No, Vossler. - Then get on it.
I have the conn. - X. O. Has the conn.
chief of the boat, make your depth 75 feet.
continue up the periscope depth. - Belay that order!
get up! - Jesus.
okay, okay.
any of you officers or chiefs feel you've been unjustly caught up in this thing...
you stand with me now.
sir, propulsion has been restored.
all flooding has been contained.
all communications are still down.
take them away. Lock them up in the officers' mess.
come on...
of all the people.
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr. Zimmer, you stay with me. - Aye, aye, sir.
the rest of you, return to your stations.
inform your men directly that the captain is in command.
I have the conn. - Captain has the conn.
diving Officer, make your depth 150 feet.
150 feet. Aye, sir.
1 MC. - Aye, sir.
may I have your attention, please?
crew of the USS Alabama...
an attempted mutiny has been put down.
we'll maintain security alert.
authorize movement only in two-man teams.
in the absence of further radio communication...
on orders from the National Command Center...
we'll achieve launch depth as quickly as we can for strategic missile launch.
we all know what this means.
it's not something one would wish for...
but we have the obligation under authenticated orders issued by our Commander-in-Chief...
to prevent the attack on our country.
russian missiles will have launch capability in 15 minutes.

for missiles 1-5 and 20-24.
aye, sir.
look, it's not a mutiny. I did everything by the book.
it's not about the book.
but if the Russians are gonna launch, and we sit here and do nothing, who's gonna stop them?
half of me's glad the captain came back.
he could be right, you know.
no orders are valid, Cob, if they're wrong.
we don't know if they're wrong. - That's true. We don't know.
that's why we have to find out first.
what if Radchenko surrendered and it's over? Hmm?
we launch. They see us. They launch.
our birds pass each other in the air. Boom!
what do you got? - Nuclear war.
nuclear holocaust.
what are you doing down here? - Jesus, I was just going to the bathroom.
Rivetti, nobody moves alone. Come on. You know the drill.
what, Bennefield, I need an escort to take a shit? - Shut up!
now I'm gonna call Control. You stay right there.
Aw, fuck that. - I mean it, man!
okay, Moebius, open the door. - You broke my nose, man.
shut up, fat boy.
Mr. Rivetti, I'm impressed. - I never liked him, sir.
Rivetti, go to the laundry, get four sets of coveralls.
and four caps. - Aye, sir.
good boy.
Davis. Can I talk to you a second?
come on.
everybody ready? - Yeah. - Let's do it.

Weps. - Weps, this is Hunter. Listen to me.
where are you? - Don't worry about where I am.
you cannot proceed. We got other ships out there that can handle this.
now, you can't be influenced by the captain or anybody else. You gotta make up your own mind.
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time to missile launch, three minutes and counting, sir.
Weps. Weps, listen. Don't do this.
don't do this. Once you launch, they cannot come back. They cannot come back, Weps.
and you know the repercussions if we're wrong, goddamn it!
Weps, if we fire now, we'll be firing while we're blind and crippled. Do you understand me?
where the fuck are you? - Do not remove that firing trigger!
do not open the safe. Weps, it's up to you.
you're the only one that knows the combination. It's up to you, Weps!
it's up to you.
mind your fucking panel!
you guys ready? - Just about, sir.
Radio/X. O: Vossler?
X. O. /Radio: Sir.
I don't know, sir. - Vossler, calm down. Just calm down.
take a deep breath. Are you calm? - Yeah, sort of.
get the radio fixed, Vossler.
I could have built one by now. How long is it gonna take you?
I don't know.
well, how much time do you need?
shit! Let's go.

Mr. Ince!
Mr. Ince, remove the tactical firing key.
sir, it is my duty to... - Son, don't talk to me about duty. Open the fucking safe!
I can't do that, sir.
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna blow your fucking head off. One.
shit!
it does me no good to kill you. You're the only one that knows the combination.
however...
petty Officer Hilaire...
doesn't know the combination!
millions of lives are at stake here, Peter! Don't make a dumb decision!
sir!
cob. - Yo.

all right, you and you, man the forward hatches.
aye, sir. - Aye, sir. - You, you, man the aft hatches.
aye, sir. - We're going up to periscope depth.
we're going to reestablish communications and get that radio message.
now, anybody got a problem with that? Chief of the boat, make your depth 78 feet.
aye, aye, sir. Make your depth 78 feet. Five degree up bubble.
Mr. Linkletter, man that periscope.
aye, aye, sir. Raising number two scope. - Radio/Conn: Mr. Vossler.
this is Captain Kirk. I need warp speed on that radio.
Yes, sir.
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will have launch capability in nine minutes.
Oh, shit! - What? What happened? - Reattach that lead!
seventy-eight feet. At periscope depth, sir!
Mr. Linkletter. - No close contact, sir.
very well. Chief of the watch, raise the VLF radio antenna.
raise the VLF antenna. Aye, sir.
VLF antenna coming up!
Conn/Radio: Sir. I think she's breathing. We're getting close.
halt, sir! - Shoot me. - Shit. Shit.
I got him.
I have the conn.
give me my missile key.
give me the missile key, Mr. Hunter.
I'm the commander of this fucking ship! Give me the goddamn key!
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will have launch capability in seven minutes.
Conn/Radio: Sir!
Radio/Conn! - Captain/Radio: Vossler, sir.
she's breathing again. We are really, really close.
you got three minutes, Vossler. Three minutes and counting. - Yes, sir.
you got three minutes.
come on.
come on, Vossler. Come on. Come on. Keep it going. Keep it going.
speaking of horses...
did you ever see those Lipizzaner stallions? - What?
from Portugal.
the Lipizzaner stallions.
the most highly trained horses in the world. They're all white.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir," you're aware they're all white or "yes, sir," you've seen them?
Yes, sir, I've seen them.
Yes, sir, I'm aware that they're all white.
they're not from Portugal. They're from Spain.
and at birth, they're not white, they're black.
sir.
I didn't know that.
but they are from Portugal.
come on, Vossler. Come on. - Yes! Yes!
come on. Come on. You got it.
some of the things they do, uh, defy belief.
their training program is simplicity itself.
you just stick a cattle prod up their ass, and you can get a horse to deal cards.
simple matter of voltage.
you're gonna get it. Come on.
I almost had it. You saw it. - Conn/Weapons:
russian missiles will have launch capability in four minutes.
there you go. There you go! Aw, shit!
look, look, look! Look at it, Vossler! There we go. There we go!
Yes!
Conn/Radio: We are receiving flash traffic. Emergency action message.
recommend alert one. Recommend alert one. Fuck, yeah!
alert one. Alert one. Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.
get that EAM. - Aye, aye, sir.
God help you if you're wrong.
if I'm wrong, then we're at war. God help us all.
sir, we have a properly formatted emergency action message...
from the National Command Authority, sir.
request permission to authenticate, sir. - Permission granted. Authenticate.
message is authentic, Captain. - I concur, sir.
I concur, sir. - Message is authentic.
1 MC.
crew of the Alabama, this is the captain.
set condition 2SQ.
terminate launch, all missiles.
all right! All right!
Mr. Hunter has the conn.
in the early hours of this morning, Russian Army forces moved in...
and met surprisingly little resistance.
there were some sporadic battles...
but, apparently, the specter of fighting their countrymen...
proved too much for these rebel troops, and they surrendered quickly.
and so a crisis that seemed to be escalating beyond the point of no return...
was ultimately resolved with fewer than a hundred soldiers dead.
and the nuclear base captured by Radchenko is now back in government hands.
reporting live from the French aircraft carrier Foch in the Mediterranean Sea...
this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.
all right, stand there, uh, Lieutenant Commander Hunter. This won't take long.
this panel has convened in order to investigate the events...
subsequent to the setting of condition 1 SQ for strategic missile launch...
on board the USS Alabama on 1 November.
now, based on the testimony from personnel on board the Alabama...
and, in no small measure, to that of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey...
I'm prepared to make my recommendations to SUBPAC.
without my testimony, sir? - You have a problem with that?
I might, sir. - I have known Captain Ramsey for almost 30 years.
we served together on more than a few occasions.
if he is lying, this will be the first I've heard of it.
Yes, sir.
my primary concern here is the breakdown in the system.
in this instance, the system failed...
because the two senior officers did not work to resolve their differences...
while preserving the chain of command.
now, you may have been proven right, Mr. Hunter...
but insofar as the letter of the law is concerned...
you were both right.
and you were also both wrong.
this is the dilemma that will occupy this panel, this Navy...
and this country's armed forces as a whole long after you leave this room.
off the record...
you've both created one hell of a mess.
a mutiny aboard a United States nuclear submarine...
violation of nuclear launch protocol.
for the record, it is the conclusion of this panel...
that your actions aboard the Alabama...
were consistent with the best traditions of the Navy...
and in the interests of the United States.
as such, the recommendations of this panel will be to accept in a manner reflective of his long and dedicated service to his country...
captain Ramsey's request for early retirement from active duty.
and based, in no small part, on Captain Ramsey's recommendation...
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter be given his next command at the earliest possible convenience.
unless, of course, you wish to challenge these recommendations.
no, sir.
captain Ramsey? - No, sir.
dismissed.
captain?
just wanted to say thank you.
you were right, and I was wrong.
about the horses, the Lipizzaners. They are from Spain, not Portugal.
Yes, sir.
has the sun turned you idle, robin?
I'm dreaming.
no.
how-- how are you here?
Oh, you're so beautiful!
what-- who brought you?
are the children safe? Are they with you?
I didn't bring them to see you.
no, no, of course not. Was it santana, the spaniard?
we saw the flag on the cliff on the other side of the island.
ha! Ha! I knew someone was coming.
we raised it only yesterday.
friday wanted to put the journey off to go hunting.
Friday?
you have to meet him! You won't believe your eyes!
he kept me sane.
we sailed right around until we saw the smoke from your fire.
wait.
the ship's on this side.
I knew it had to be you.
Yes, but they can't stay there.
the currents are dangerous.
they change at any moment.
come! Come!
they're gone.
what? Gone?
the captain was worried about the rocks and the currents.
they've gone back to the flag to await the next tide.
I bribed the boatswain to put me in the water.
alone?
I had to see you.
but no. But--but
the tides, if they change, they'll be driven on the rocks.
they'll be wrecked.
No!
Ah!
you dream something and then you make it happen.
Hey! Hey, how's it going?
this is dundee.
he's heard your name as much as he's heard his.
what would you think of england, dundee?
he'll retire and he'll bore the local dogs with his tales of wild beasts and gunpowder.
it's like the seeds from the maple on the walk to church!
does sophie still try catching them as they fall?
they both do.
this is for daniel.
it's for his birthday tomorrow.
you made the children presents?
Oh!
Daniel's getting strong.
he'll kill someone with that!
not if he has his father's skills.
come on, we should hurry.
did you say the ship was heading back to the flag?
Yes.
Friday! Come on.
he's probably hunting.
if he is, how long will he be?
an hour, a day.
no, we can't wait.
the tides will change in a few hours.
and the captain won't stay at anchor long.
Friday!
maybe he's up top.
it's not london, I know, but there's so much to talk about.
I was here before.
something happened that was
smoke!
did you fall?
hit your head?
you said you saw a fire.
there's no fire.
you said there was smoke in here.
that must be what we saw.
how long was I lying there?
for 6 long years, all I have ever hoped of and dreamed of and prayed for is to see you again, to hold you.
and I open my eyes and...
And?
am I dead?
then are you?
do you think that this is heaven?
our own paradise island?
no.
no, heaven would be the warehouse.
Mm -hmm?
the clumsy bed that I made.- Mm-hmm.
Daniel and sophie sleeping safely and you and I complaining about the endless rain.
then we're not dead.
not yet.
we have to go.
I need to make sure friday's ok.
what's the last thing you remember?
I made the flag.
I marked out a route to the south cliffs.
where your ship is now.
without markers on the side of the island, a ship could pass us.
but if they're seeking for us they will find us.
no, they can still pass us.
what if it isn't a rescue ship? What if a merchant ship passes?
what do you think?
I think we can hunt any day.
I think a ship may only pass once.
our supplies are nearly gone.
this is the ensign to the triton.
your ship.
my ship.
the story will have passed from captain to captain.
any ship that passes will know that there's a survivor here.
there'll not be any survivors here if we die from hunger.
then I'll go by myself.
but we made it there...
and back.
Yes!
Yes, we must've.
you saw the flag from the ship.
that's why you sailed around here!
Friday.
friday's spear's missing.
Why? He didn't take it with us.
so he's taken it since. What
then he's hunting?
I suppose this could've happened after we went.
why can't I remember?
Friday!
Friday!
are you ill?
no, it's just still some sea -sickness maybe.
stay here and rest.
I'll tell your captain to stay at anchor by the cliffs.
I'll come back for you and friday.
I'm coming with you.
the journey's dangerous.
if I have to spend another hour alone, fearing for you...
please.
you remember?
you will.
don't look so worried.
trust me.
we'll be right back. Good boy.
you talk.
I stay in all day, cook and play cribbage.
and in the evenings, I count the number of seeds in a pile.
she's following us.
she's beautiful.
I used to hate the birds.
every year, as winter would draw near, they'd gather in the trees with excitement and expectations, getting ready to fly off to
I always imagined england.
come.
wait, wait!
what?
I recognize this place.
we hid here.
from what?
on the way out or back?
back.
I wasn't carrying a flag.
it is following us.
what is?
what is? You said "it is following us.
I assume you know what "it" is, otherwise you would've said "something is following us.
you chose now to correct my english?
I told you we shouldn't have brought that.
we were being stalked.
friday had a small deer.
it was dead.
I thought it might be attracting the animal.
I asked him not to bring it.
I asked him to leave it here.
did you have it at the tree house?
friday was there when the smoke happened.
what if he hasn't gone hunting?
but his spear wasn't there when we left.
