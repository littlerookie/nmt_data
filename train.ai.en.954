he told stories of the 3-year winter...
...and how the dirty snow never stopped falling.
he saw the ocean, barren, poisoned, near death.
and how they watched the sky for 1 6 long years...
...Praying for the great lungs to start working again.
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief.
many commuters are abandoning their vehicles.
goddamn it, Bill!
you know I need to check it first.
I don't know.
better than turpentine, Bill.
tastes about the same.
what do you say?
your call.
you ain't picky, Bill.
I like that about you.
things I like about my ass...
...Number 1:
will settle for turpentine.
we got TV!
we got 1 4 7 channels, Bill.
we got everything from... Jesus to Jeopardy .
'Like...
...Sands through the hourglass, so are the days--. "
we'll watch that.
...Sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.
'Monday. "
monday night. "
Monday-night football!
I don't want any trouble.
I bet you don't either.
let's just call it a draw.
I'm rich!
I know the rule.
it's my rule.
'avoid civilization at all cost. "
we got to eat, don't we?
open your mouth.
it's true we haven't done this for a while but...
...for God sakes, it's like riding a bicycle, Bill.
what are you so worried about?
all you got to do is stand there.
I'm the one with all the lines.
open up.
awful.
just awful.
they said, " Fear not, Macbeth...
...Till Birnam Wood...
...Comes to Dunsinane. "
I said...
...Till Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane! "
thank you.
arm yourselves!
arm yourselves.
if the witch's words are true...
...There'll be no running, hiding here!
they'll fight...
...as if our last meal depended on it.
tomorrow...
and tomorrow...
tomorrow.
and the day after that.
out, brief candle!
life's but a walking shadow...
...a poor player who struts...
...and frets his hour upon a stage...
...and is heard no more.
it's a tale told by...
a moron...
...Full of sound and fury...
...Signifying...
...nothing.
but blow, wind!
come, wrack!
at least we'll die... ...with the harness off our back!
I want to talk to him.
the children have never seen Shakespeare before.
they still haven't.
thank you. You're very kind.
I'm clapping because you stink.
I don't think you know how it works.
when I was young, I tried to be an actor. I was awful.
but now I won't die thinking I was the worst one.
stop it! -That's all right.
how much did you pay to get in?
so bite me.
you were very good.
good enough to get something to eat? -Yes, we have some soup.
Holnists. Goddamn!
bastards hardly kill anyone lately.
we give them food and supplies.
all the towns do.
I'd just as soon not give them anything of mine, thanks.
what are you doing there?
what are you doing?
it's just a game, GeneraI Bethlehem.
it's something they saw in a play. No harm in it.
wait a minute!
a play?
show me.
it's all right, children. Show me.
arm yourselves.
no running from the witches.
Shakespeare, is it?
I'm sorry I missed it.
we haven't nearly stocked the game that we thought we would.
Really? But you had time for a play?
I'm taking 3 conscripts... ...from each town!
they will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army...
...until such time as I see fit!
3 men.
could you do that?
captain!
all men... between 1 5 and 50...
...and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now!
general.
no, but keep that.
acceptable.
sir?
acceptable, Captain.
need some meat on you, but I like an impressionable mind.
acceptable.
Mongoloid.
unacceptable.
I want pure blood.
don't wave. -People, you will look at me!
someone like...
like that man!
you don't understand.
you were required to show yourself.
I'm not with them. I'm just passing through.
take the mule.
let's go! Move!
Ten-hut!
I want a line right here.
welcome, gentlemen, to your new life.
you have been born again as soldiers in the United Army of Nathan Holn.
God rest his soul!
the strong have been sapped... by the whimpering propaganda of the weak.
men...
...Strong men, have been denied their destiny.
you men have been saved from that fate.
redemption...
...is within your grasp.
you.
what did you do before you were given this opportunity?
I had a shovel. I digged holes.
you digged holes.
now you'll fill them.
and you?
me?
is there any question in anyone's mind that I was speaking to you?
Yes, you.
I'm just a performer.
Shakespeare. Stuff like that.
Shakespeare?
he was a writer.
Yes, I know.
I know who Shakespeare was.
'cry 'Havoc!' ...
...and let slip... the dogs of war. "
me?
'to be or not to be:
that is the question. "
'we few...
...we happy few...
...we band of brothers! "
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer... by this sun of York. "
you're pretty good.
you're also a fighter. I can see it in your eyes.
you are a dangerous man.
don't you agree?
no disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off letting me go.
a fighter is about the last thing that I am.
don't you think I should be the judge of that, soldier?
get up.
I said, get up!
you're right. You're not a fighter.
but you will be.
I'm giving you a chance at a life...
...that means something.
a life worth living.
I'm glad to see you. -We missed you.
I missed you. Kurt, how are you? -Hungry.
Gretl, what happened to your finger? -It got caught.
caught in what? -Friedrich's teeth.
Thanks.
did I win?
I tried to tell him.
say it again.
say what?
words you said in town.
about the wind blowing and the rest. Say it again.
'Blow, wind. Come, wrack.
at least we'll die with the harness off our back. "
what's it mean?
live free or... ...die. "
I think.
you're going to watch a movie or you can sleep!
but tomorrow...
...you run in uniform...
...Full packs...
...20 miles!
everybody makes it...
...or nobody eats...
...for the third day in a row!
everybody up.
you got meat tonight.
why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind it is?
mule.
god-awful animal.
sterile offspring of horse and donkey.
can you imagine that?
there's no room in the New World for a bastard like that.
any man last in line ain't hungry enough to eat.
you show up last...
...you don't eat!
I'm going to die before I'm last in line again!
that's what they're hoping for.
shut up! At least you're eating!
you serious?
good.
this is good!
you want this?!
this is what you want?
babies!
the hills are alive with the sound of music
these were supposed to be the best years of my life.
the Laws of Eight, gentlemen.
that is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.
may he burn in hell.
these are the laws that we live by.
...is our symbol.
each man will bear it with pride.
only then will you be part of the clan.
sit down, gentlemen.
law One:
you will obey orders without question. I told you to sit.
there weren't enough chairs.
I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat on the ground.
you disobeyed a direct order. You broke... Law One.
law Two:
punishment shall be swift.
law Three:
mercy...
...is for the weak.
four:
terror...
...will defeat reason.
five:
your allegiance is to the clan.
six:
justice can be dictated.
seven:
any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan.
does anyone wish to challenge me?
on your feet.
law Eight:
there's only one penalty. Death.
please! l'm begging you!
you will get out of this army what you put into it.
work and you'll be fed.
fight and you'll be respected.
die and you'll be remembered.
you thinking of challenging for leadership?
no, sir.
I'm a follower...
...not a leader.
you got a smart mouth...
...Shakespeare.
you see Colonel Getty always following the General?
he was the last man ever to challenge.
fight lasted 6 seconds...
...but he didn't kill him.
cut off his tongue...
...then he cut off his balls.
and old Getty's been following him around like a dog ever since.
fall out!
the General don't see it...
...but I say you've got some nigger in you.
they're yours?
a solitary man, aren't you?
binoculars to watch life from a distance and Shakespeare...
...to read about it, instead of living it.
no offense, but you seem to have read Shakespeare... yourself.
lf he wishes to rise above mere thuggery...
...a military commander must be classically educated...
...Philosophy and history, even a sense of the dramatic.
what do you think that I did before the war?
do you think that l was in the army?
I sold copying machines.
I was a salesman...
...with the talent to lead men, devise and execute a battle plan... locked away inside.
if Nathan Holn hadn't come along, I'd still be selling copying machines.
can you imagine...
...the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of that?
but war...
...War gives men like me a chance.
'the prize is often left unclaimed.
we must have the courage to grasp it...
...for fortune always favors the bold. "
he always inspires me.
I have a design for the future. A master plan.
I will need able officers to help me carry it out.
you have the intelligence.
if your heart matches...
...you will go far.
we'll talk more in weeks to come.
dismissed.
captain!
we'll be moving out tomorrow.
issue those binoculars to a scout.
and the book, sir?
burn it.
quit moving!
what happened?
what happened? What'd he say? -Nothing.
did he say anything about me?
No!
I'm getting out of here. -What are you talking about?
escaping. -What?!
you ever hear of Saint Rose? It's on the coast.
it's a paradise. -We can't.
we could!
between the 3 of us we could.
I can't.
I like it here. I like being a part of something.
take a point!
some of the men shot a lion.
they crawled into the thicket.
one of you dogs earned a treat.
over there.
those men hunted a lion this morning.
must've been a goddamn zoo here before the war.
anyway, a third man went in after it.
we don't know if he's alive or dead.
I want a volunteer.
one of you is going in there after him.
I'll go.
I guess size ain't a measure of courage.
is it?
I don't think so, Captain!
come out alive, you get a lion steak!
maybe you'll find your Saint Rose over there.
what the hell are you waiting for, Christmas?
why are you stopping?
I found him.
he got him.
let's go.
hurry up!
you still got a lion to bag!
you men get back in line!
there he is! -Shoot him!
in the water. Come back without him...
...and you and another man will die in his place.
go! Go!
I'll get him!
go!
don't.
just let me go.
I don't want to be a part of your army.
my army?
I like the sound of that.
I got him!
I'm sorry.
how come... you wrecked it... for me?
it's me or you.
what?
it doesn't have to be.
we can go together. You and me.
good boy!
good boy.
get him.
finish it!
get him.
that's it.
get him, damn it!
bleeding?
well, bleeder...
...you want your Saint Rose?
I'll give you your Saint Rose.
how you doing?
you shouldn't have.
here's a piece of good news.
Jerry's decided to go to school...
...to get his contractor's license.
good, Jerry.
and little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know that he lost... a tooth.
thanks for being there for me.
Turn-on's:
men in uniform. "
greetings...
you just head back the way you came.
Pineview ain't buying and we ain't listening...
...and we don't give charity.
Really?
civilian, I'm on officiaI business.
I demand entry into the town of Pineview.
what the hell are you talking about?
I'm through talking to you, buddy-boy.
get someone with the authority to open this gate.
that's him.
I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you?
I'm a representative of the United States government.
authorized by... Order 4 1 7 of the Restored Congress to reestablish... communication route... lower Oregon.
what's that mean in English?
I'm your postman.

...Tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense...
...and the Bolin Act requires that you provide... all mail carriers with...
...Sanctuary and...
...Nutri-- Food.

you know Jerry the contractor?
wait a minute.
I'll get something out of my bag.

I'm lrene March.
I have a letter for you.
would you read it?
I'm sure it's personal.
please, someone has to. -I'll read it, Mom.
we're delivering old stockpiles...
...but I'll accept all new correspondence.
dear lrene: Sorry I haven't written.
everything's so crazy.
the strange weather, the food shortages...
...that farmer Nathan Holn causing all that trouble.
it's hard to understand.
David's home from the army.
the war was over before he even got there. Thank God for that.
we're going to miss you for Christmas...
...but maybe next year.
all our love, Donna. "
my sister...
...in Denver...
... 1 5 years ago.
thank you.
you're a godsend.
a savior.
I'm just...
...the postman.
I've been on the road awhile.
I could use a little something to eat.
Yes, absolutely.
is there anything else?
Yes, there is.
if there are dogs in this town...
...You'll have to leash them while I'm here.
Mr. Postman
Hey, Mr. Postman Look and see
if there's a letter for me
Thanks.
my name used to be John Stevens, but I changed it...
...on account of l want to drive cars.
this is where everybody meet and gather.
can you tell us about the government?
tell us everything. -Is there a President?
Yeah.
what's his name?
you know, I'm pretty hungry. -Come on.
please!
his name...
...Is...
from Maine.
he has a saying.
'Stuff's getting better.
stuff's getting better every day. "
is he a Democrat or a Republican?
parties are over with.
it's an individual that counts.
what about Europe?
Europe?
any word?
well, there's... good air in Iceland.
is Nathan Holn still alive?
he died.
skin cancer.
he may be dead...
...but what about the Holnists? What'll the government do about them?
the government's just getting started.
so you're going to be on your own for 6, 8 or 1 8 months.
how about the Marine Corps?
be quiet.
everyone be quiet.
can't we just let this man eat?
let us pray.
we give you thanks for this food...
...this day...
...this man and his good news...
...Evidence of your promise...
...that you will hold our country together.
Amen.
would you like to dance?
I don't know if I can.
I think I'm still on duty.
all you have to do is hold on.
it's been a long time.
something wrong?
how tall are you?
about six feet.
are you smart?
smarter than some, I guess. Why?
just wondering.
have you ever had the bad mumps?
never had the bad mumps.
no syphilis, nothing like that?
so as far as you know...
...you have good semen?
is that a trick question?
no, it's not.
I'm only asking...
...because I want you to make me pregnant.
all right...
...that's it.
wait.
wait, please.
it's got to be the uniform.
this is my husband, Michael. He hasn't said no.
I haven't said anything yet.
we've been trying to have a baby for 3 years.
we cannot on account of Michael. He had the bad mumps when he was I .
so we need a body father.
we could ask a man here, but it may cause problems.
we've seen it happen.
things go okay until the woman shows, then it can be difficult.
but you'll only be around once in a while with the mail.
you're the postman.
what do you say, mister?
you'd do us a favor.
I'm going to think about it.
excuse me.
my mother would like to give you something.
he's right here, Mom.
it's to my other daughter...
...Annie.
it doesn't say where.
we don't know where she is. She left 5 years ago.
the last we heard she was living up north.
look, Mrs. March, you should know that
I know what?
I have a feeling about you.
I know you'll do what's right.
I got to get out of here.
easy, boy.
it's right around the corner.
what is?
what you're looking for.
what I'm looking for?
crazy old coot.
I knew you'd come here.
you did?
so how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?
you have to be in the right place at the right time.
how can l do it?
I thought you wanted to drive cars. -Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.
this is real.
so where's the right place?
could be anywhere, you know. Anytime.
only another postman can make you a postman.
kind of like vampires, right?
Yeah, something like that.
you have to be sworn in, so...
the organization's kind of shaky right now. It might not last.
what does?
you'd meet people who don't believe in you.
I'll set them straight.
it's a lonely job.
I've been lonely all my life.
so have I, Ford.
so have I.
what the hell!
you repeat after me.
'Neither snow...
...Nor rain...
...Nor heat...
...Nor gloom of night...
...Stays these couriers...
...from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. "
okay, then.
okay, then.
no, I'm saying that. You just listen.
I'm sorry.
by my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail.
Congratulations.
you're a postman.
I'd die to get a letter through.
what did you say?
I said I'd die to get a letter through. -Johnny!
why don't you run along.
I need to speak to this man.
I'll see you around.
sure thing, Ford.
Johnny is impressed with you. Whole town is impressed with you.
I take it you're not.
you're smarter than you look. -What can I do for you?
you can either clear out or I can throw you out. Either way suits me.
you don't understand. l'm a government employee authorized by
you are not authorized by shit!
you were trying to sneak out of here. You are nothing... but a drifter who found a bag of mail. I want you out of town.
all right. This is going in my report.
these people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman.
they need something real. They need help with the Holnists.
are you going to bring them that?
didn't think so.
all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.
I aim to keep it that way.
you can stay here till morning...
...then I don't ever want to see you again.
what the hell these people
just leave it.
I said, leave it.
Hello, Abby.
you'll be leaving tomorrow?
I guess.
everybody's up late writing letters for you to take.
they're so excited.
and how about you? Do you have a letter?
I don't have anybody to write to.
I'll find you a pen pal.
someone with similar interests. You know?
like dancing and...
...Checking for mumps.
you're funny.
hardly anybody's funny around here.
have you decided yet?
been thinking about it.
sure.
I mean...
...why not?
God, you're so...
you're so...
...Beautiful.
I'm sorry, you probably want to keep things more clinical.
you don't even know my name.
I don't want to.
it would be easier for me... if you closed your eyes.
we took a vote, Mr. Postman.
we want you to have this.
so you can't say no.
I'll take it.
you got a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.
good.
thank you.
where will you go from here?
go?
west...
...then I'll work my way... back here, sort of a figure eight.
times seem hard right now.
but you got to believe things are getting better.
birds are migrating again.
the rains are back.
stuff's...
stuff's getting better.
shit!
you've got a hell of a nerve, whoever you are.
did you see Abby around this morning?
this is as far as I go.
you're on your own.
are you really who you say you are?
if I come back with some mail...
...You'll know.
goddamn it!
what are you looking at?
everything.
they don't usually look at me.
who is responsible... for that?
I said...
... " Who's responsible... for that " ?!
Holnists, Johnny. You got to stay
you got to stay out of sight. -I'm a postman!
and I'm not running from anybody!
stay out of this, or I will lock you up myself.
you'll be responsible.
now set that flag on fire.
throw it through the window of your post office.
do it, Michael.
it's all right, Michael. Throw it.
the United States...
...Doesn't exist!
that flag is an abomination!
there was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it...
I looked at it and it had a color to it.
good.
everything.
I was amazed. It was...
good Lord!
that, gentlemen...
...is a first-rate piece of ass.
tell the sheriff to introduce me. She doesn't belong in this mudhole.
excuse me.
you again!
that's my wife, General.
she's a married woman.
Really?
do you know what system of government we have here?
we have what is known as a feudal system, like in the Middle Ages.
that's lords and vassals. That's you and me.
now those lords...
...they had some ideas.
they believed that if a vassal got married...
...it was the lord's right...
...his right...
...to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.
me and Abby have been married 3 years.
I'm sorry, but I wasn't invited to the wedding.
you've already done me one favor, son.
don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.
we'll be civilized about this.
I want you to give me your blessing.
sir, I can't.
you can't?
you can't.
'Can't. "
we had a great nation once.
I know what made it great?
I can. "
till the weak came along.
the " I can'ts " destroyed us!
I'm going to make us strong again.
I'm going to be the father... of a new nation.
and do you know why...
...it will be me?
because I can.
stop it!
you're killing him!
let me go!
please, let me go!
help him, somebody! Please!
you didn't have to--!
didn't have to what?
you bastard!
you killed him!
your people seem seditious.
you seem seditious.
what am I seeing here?
I'm waiting!
a man came through with mail. Said he was a postman.
said that the government had been restored back east.
what government?
the United States government!
who said that?
which way did he go?
do not make me ask again.
east.
send a patrol east!
send 3 more...
...North, south and west!
they'd better find him east.
take that damn shirt off, Johnny!
I managed to save these.
do you want to die too?
I'm headed south with the mail.
don't be a fool.
what should I be?
G. D. died of flu last winter.
that's all there is.
that's all there is, folks.
for now.
but there'll be more, lots more, once there's a real system in place.
right?
what about New York City?
did they survive the plague?
survive?
they got Broadway up and running again.
there's a kid doing Andrew Floyd Webber, you wouldn't believe.
how much is it to mail a letter?
'Mail... "
they won't open the gates.
they say they got a representative of the Restored United States in there.
they say this army is illegal.
and they say-- -Drop dead!
and go to hell!
that's what they say.
what are you doing?! Open the gates.
What're you thinking?!
the Romans...
...Had an expression...
...they used to scare their children.
...is at the gates.
do you know who Hannibal was?
of course not.
a pretty girl like you wouldn't understand something like that.
let's fight them! -With what?
we've got 5 guns, maybe 0 rounds of ammo.
how we going to fight with that?
you don't.
negotiate a settlement.
give them extra supplies.
you're the government rep. Tell them.
right here.
make it quick. I've got an attack to coordinate.
it was on a side road outside of Los Angeles,
I was hitchhiking from San Francisco down to San Diego, I guess,
a half - hour earlier, I'd thumbed a ride,
thanks for the ride, the three cigarettes and for not laughing at my theories on life.
but you broke off in the middle.
why do you keep looking for new places, people, ideas?
well, I never liked any job I had. Maybe the next one is the one.
not worried about your future? - I got plenty of time for that. Besides...maybe my future starts right now. -Well, good luck.
maybe I'll see you again. - Thanks for the ride, mister.
who do you think you are?
he slipped you something, huh? - That's right, brother.
I stick my head in the window and say: Parking in the highway, who do you think you are?
he slipped me three little words. - Three words?
Yeah. He says, "The district attorney."
that's right, the old DA himself. He lives down the road here a piece.
good morning, my friend. I'll tell you about that job.
all you've got to do is, you know, help around the place.
right now I've got a certain trouble that keeps me from working.
you look healthy. - My feet.
they keep itching for me to go places.
but it's a nice place you've got. How's the food?
I'll make you a wonderful hamburger, free. -Yeah?
to show you the food that goes with the job. Do you know about automobiles?
Oh, I'm a born mechanic. - Swell.
sit down.
the job doesn't pay all the money in the world...but you've got no expenses.
you eat and sleep right here. A fine bed, box spring and mattress...fresh air, sunshine.
boy, you'll be living. - Suppose I try it for a couple of days?
Yeah.
a customer. - Go ahead. We're not making money here.
I'll look after the hamburger. - Thanks.
don't go away.
you drop this?
Thanks.
Thanks.
that's it, burn it up. I'll go tell my wife you're going to stay.
your wife?
Cora, I've got someone to help us now.
Oh, turn that off, Cora.
the electric light company is making enough money.
my, Cora, you look lovely tonight.
thank you, Nick.
Nick...that man you hired today...
Frank?
well, if that's his name.
why don't you give him a week's salary and let him go?
a week's pay for nothing? - Well, we can get along without him.
now, hold on, that's a bit too hasty. He's working pretty cheap.
that Los Angeles butcher has been cheating me.
Yes. He's been charging you U.S. Choice prices for U.S. Good.
Yeah. Well, we'll fix him.
my husband tells me your name is Frank.
that's right.
well, Frank, around here, you'll kindly do your reading on your own time.
your husband, Nick, told me I was through for the day...and I thought he was boss.
the best way to get my husband to fire you would be not doing what I tell you to do.
well, you haven't asked me to do anything. Yet.
I want all these chairs painted.
all right.
I'll look in the paper. Maybe I can find a sale on cheap paint.
you won't find anything cheap around here.
look in the cupboard under the counter.
as my friend Nick would say, that's wonderful.
next time anybody is in town they can pick up a paintbrush.
look on the bottom shelf.
well, what do you know about that?
why didn't you start this campaign of rehabilitation before I came?
or were you waiting for me? - Nick was saving that.
Nick saves a lot. - It's none of your business.
I didn't say it was. Only when I have something, I don't save it.
what do you want to paint these chairs for?
because I want to make something of this place. I want to make it - Well...aren't we ambitious?
we want to make a lot of money so we can buy lots of pretty clothes.
or maybe we want to put a little aside for our husband and us in our old age.
for a couple of weeks then she wouldn't look at me, or say a word to me if she could help it,
I began to feel like a cheap nobody making a play for a girl that had no use for me,
Oh, I disturbed her,
I knew she hated me for that worst of all,
a customer wants this wiped off. It needs hot water.
trying to figure a way to get that sign back.
well, don't bother. - No bother.
all I need is a stepladder. - I don't want the sign put back, busybody.
I've been trying to get a new sign for two years.
maybe there are things you don't know how to sell.
hello there. You know, Frank, I've been thinking, you must be in love.
you hardly eat any lunch. He doesn't get any letters.
I guess his girl's got another fella. -Too hot to eat.
funny climate around here. The harder the wind blows, the hotter it gets.
we call that wind the Santa Ana. It comes from the desert.
Nick, why don't you let me take your car, I'll run that sign into town and get it fixed.
take it to the electric company. They did it for free last time.
sure, why not? They make a fortune on it.
now you're talking like the neon - sign salesman.
a neon sign would burn a quarter as much juice...but, Nick, that's not the point.
it isn't? - What's the purpose of a sign around here?
to show people where they can eat. - Not for my money.
a sign should give people an appetite. Your sign doesn't make me hungry.
Yeah. Maybe you're right...but I'm too busy to talk about it now.
he's hooked.
I could sell anything to anybody.
that's what you think.
tell me one thing.
how did you ever come to marry a guy like that?
is that any of your business?
maybe.
maybe it's none of my business, but what's Nick sore about?
he's so crazy about the sign, he's afraid you'll claim it's your idea instead of his.
yeah?
watch.
I've seen many a sign, but that's the daddy of them all.
I gotta hand it to you. - Why, Frank?
I was trying to get the old one fixed, and you'd seen the neon salesman.
a new sign, prettier than a Christmas tree.
Thanks, Frank. Did it make you hungry?
thirsty. - Sure, celebrate.
Thanks.
no, thank you.
sing something, Nick. - Okay.
go on, Cora. Do a little dance for us. Cora's a wonderful dancer.
I feel silly dancing alone...but start the jukebox, Nick, and I'll dance with you.
listen to her, Frank. I'm always telling her I'm like a lot of smart men.
my brains are not in my feet.
how about me dancing with Mrs. Smith? -Okay, go ahead. Go ahead, Cora.
I prefer to watch dancing. - It's silly. You can't dance in here.
I've got an idea. Try in here. There's lots of room.
Nick, I've practically forgotten how to dance.
Oh, you're wonderful, and you know it.
Nick, I don't want to. -Go on, don't be silly. Enjoy yourself.
go ahead, Cora.
save your strength, Nick. It's too hot to dance.
Cora, you left the new sign burning.
Nick.
I'll drive to the beach and have a swim.
sure, that's a wonderful idea. You haven't been out of this place for 30 days.
won't you come with me? - No.
I'll just stay here and celebrate the new sign.
all right.
climb right in. It's okay.
Nick said it was all right with him if it's all right with you.
let's not stay too long, I'd like to do this again.
don't worry, you'll find this night air can get awfully cold in a very few minutes.
Hey!
Oh, do you like lemon meringue pie?
I don't know. I - I'll make you some tomorrow.
it's you, Cora.
I thought it was a customer wanting gas.
were you worried? - No.
only I didn't expect you back so soon.
good night, Frank.
please don't.
Cora?
Cora.
the next day we were so busy I hardly had a chance to look at her,
not until the middle of the morning, There was a lull about that time, and Nick had just left for L,A,
Nick had another brainstorm and drove into town.
this time it's the laundry service that's cheating him.
Frank, about that question. - What question?
why I married Nick.
my answer is that Nick came along at the right time and with a wedding ring.
the ring was the first thing he mentioned.
and you liked it for certain reasons.
you don't know the half of it.
Frank, I hate to say this...but I wasn't ever homely, so
you must have had to fight off a lot of guys.
a lot of guys?
all the guys.
I don't especially like the way I look sometimes...but I never met a man since I was 14 that didn't want to argue about it.
sure. By the time Nick came along...you were ready to marry anybody that owned a gold watch.
seemed the best thing to do from my angle.
and as for him, I told him...I told him I didn't love him. -He said that would come in time.
Yeah.
but it didn't. - But I meant to stick by him.
and that's why-- -That's why you married him and retired.
the undefeated champ.
not 100% undefeated.
not now.
what's that?
somebody trying to come in.
is the door locked?
I must have locked it.
whoever it was, they...They went away.
too bad Nick took the car. - Even if it were here...we couldn't take it. Not unless we want to spend the night in jail.
stealing a man's wife, that's nothing, but stealing his car, that's larceny.
get over!
say, you're not tired already, are you? - A little.
come on, let's sit down for a minute.
here.
don't worry, we'll get a lift in a minute.
Frank, look, if I divorce Nick, he'll never give me a nickel.
he'll keep the Twin Oaks and everything. -What do we care?
but where are we headed? - What's the difference? Anywhere.
anywhere. Do you know where that is? - Anywhere we choose.
no, it isn't. It's back to the hash house for me.
for you, some parking lot where you wear a smock with "super service" on it.
I would die if I saw you in a smock. - I wore one at the Twin Oaks.
but that was mine.
Oh, don't you see? You're smart. Others could be wearing the smocks...and you could be manager.
Yeah, I can hardly wait. - Oh, stop acting.
you're ashamed of being smart. I'm ashamed of begging for a ride...that'll take me back where I started. -Want to go back?
I want to be somebody. And if I walk out......I'll lose everything, and I'll never be anybody.
Oh, I love you, Frank, and I want you, but not this way.
not starting out like a couple of tramps.
I'm going back.
Frank! - What's the matter now?
the note I wrote for Nick. If he gets home...
where' d you leave it? - The cash register.
great. That's the first place he'll look too.
look, here comes a bus. Stop it.
all right.
Frank.
Frank, look, it's Nick.
look out!
that was close.
I'd like to see him get plastered like that some night and drive off a cliff.
you didn't mean that.
you were joking.
sure.
sure, l... I was joking.
of course you were.
of course.
well, I better change quick.
don't look now, but I'm a little high.
and did I fix those laundry people and make them like it.
Frank, I even made them pay for the beer.
why don't you jump in a cold shower? - Yeah, yeah. I'm going to.
because I'm not only a little high, I'm higher than a kite.
what's the idea...of your good clothes?
you're not going to quit on me, are you?
what's the matter, Frank? Don't you like the food?
maybe you and l can get together on a...
what's the big idea of the suitcases?
now, take it easy, Nick. -What were you stealing in those suitcases?
wait a minute! - I might have known.
I take in a hobo off the road, hungry.
the moment I've got my back turned, he tries to rob me.
I'm not a thief. - Prove that by opening up those suitcases.
come on, open up those suitcases.
well, what's all the argument about?
he's a thief, Cora. Look at those suitcases.
I just got back in time.
you're crazy, Nick. Why, Frank's not a thief.
this afternoon he got an attack of road fever.
he said his feet were itching for a new place.
so he came in to say goodbye with a suitcase.
with two suitcases, you mean. One of them full of our stuff.
you've had too much beer, Nick. The other one was our suitcase...but Frank's bought a lot of things since he's been here...and I told him he could have it in exchange for the pay he had coming.
that's a pretty good bargain, Cora.
I'm sorry, Frank.
my boy, that road fever is never going to get you anywhere.
but that's all settled, darling. Frank's road fever wasn't very serious.
he forgot about it as soon as I promised you'd pay him $3.00 more a week.
good girl.
now if I'm really smart, I'll keep my big mouth shut...and go and take that shower.
that's all right, Nick, I'll pick them up.
what's the difference if they do get dirty?
I got them washed for free.
right then, I should have walked out of that place, but I couldn't make myself do it,
she had me licked, and she knew it,
for a week she treated me as if I was only somebody working around the place,
I nearly went out of my mind,
I couldn't go, and I couldn't stay the way things were,
then one night, I decided I had to have a talk with her, to see if there wasn't some future, some way for the two of us,
no,
what are we going to do?
that's great, coming from you. After you've been high-hatting me the way you have.
what else could I do?
Oh, Frank.
Frank, if I'd only met you first.
well?
Frank, do you love me?
Yes.
do you love me so much that nothing else matters?
Yes.
there's...there's one thing we could do that would...fix everything for us.
what? Pray for something to happen to Nick?
something like that.
Cora! - Well, you suggested it yourself once.
didn't you? - I was only joking.
were you? - Yes, I was.
or had you started to think about it? - I didn't really mean it.
well, I say it again now, and I do mean it! - Cora!
listen, Frank, I'm not what you think I am.
I wanna keep this place and work hard and be something. That's all.
but you can't do it without love.
at least a woman can't.
I've made a big mistake in my life.
and I've got to be this way just once to fix it.
they hang you for that. - Not if we do it right.
you're smart, Frank. You'll think of a way.
plenty of men have.
he never did anything to me.
but, darling, can't you see how happy we would be together here?
without him?
do you love me, Cora?
that's why you've got to help me.
it's because I do love you.
I guess you do.
you couldn't get me to say yes to a thing like this if you didn't.
I guess I worked out the details, but the original plan was hers,
she got it from an article in a magazine saying most serious accidents, happen right in people's homes, mostly right in their own bathtubs,
will you be able to hear the bathtub water running from down here?
can't help hearing it.
he always starts to sing when he turns the water on.
we'll sink or swim on how that story's told. -Well, I won't miss.
Nick was taking a bath. You were outside wiping off the car. I was ironing in the kitchen.
all of a sudden I noticed some water dripping from the ceiling.
maybe we'd better say that---Don't change a word. I know it backwards!
all right, all right. Make sure he's in the tub when you go in.
just say you came in to get some clean towels.
and then...when he's not looking, you
then what do you do?
then I lock the door......and make sure the water is still running.
I step out the window, down the stepladder. Put the stepladder in the shed. If anybody sees it, we're sunk.
don't move away from that car in case anyone comes along.
don't worry. If I give you the signal on the horn, you call everything off.
nobody stops here when the lights are out in front.
Cora...Maybe it would be better if I did it.
we settled that a dozen times. If I go in there, he won't pay any attention to me.
that your car?
it belongs to the fellow I work for.
Oh, hello. Yeah, yeah. So it does. So it does.
okay, just checking up.
what's that? - What's what?
Well...Look at that. - What is it?
Oh, that doggone cat climbing up that stepladder.
I like cats. Always up to something.
Frank! - Shut up! Shut up!
are you crazy, screaming like that? Did you do it?
what happened? All the lights went out. - A fool cat jumped on a wire.
did you do it? - Yes, I did.
but before I could do anything else, the lights went out.
he's unconscious, but he's still breathing.
did he see you do it? - I don't know!
we got to bring him to. - No!
listen, there was a state cop outside and he saw the stepladder.
but he mustn't come to! - He's got to. If he dies, we're sunk.
the cop saw that stepladder. If he dies, they'll know and get us.
I'll get him. You phone a doctor. - Suppose he saw me. What will he say?
get on that phone and call a doctor!
operator. Operator, this is Twin Oaks.
I want a doctor.
any doctor. Quick. There's been an accident.
but I don't want an ambulance! I want a doctor!
Frank, will you please stop--?
Oh, so it's you. - Hello.
the boss, Mr.Smith, he had an accident. - So I heard.
this is Mrs.Smith, isn't it? - Yes.
this is the district attorney, Mrs. Smith. He lives near you.
my name's Sackett. - How do you do, Mr. Sackett?
what happened?
well, I went in there...to the bathroom, I mean, to get some towels.
he was in there?
Yes, just standing up in the tub.
suddenly there was a big flash of fire, a terrible noise...and the lights went out all over the house.
I heard him fall, but it was so dark, so l...
the doctor thinks you'd better come in. - Thank you.
he seems to be coming back into consciousness now.
doctor, is he going to...?
I'm afraid I can't make any promises. That's why I called you in.
Nick.
Nick.
Nick, it's me. Cora.
Nick, don't you even know your own wife?
and aren't you ashamed of yourself? Falling down in the bathtub like a little boy...just because the lights went out.
Nick, aren't you going to speak to me?
Everything...went dark.
what happened?
quick. What happened? - I stuck to my story.
same thing here.
what are we going to do? They know something's wrong. Suppose Nick dies.
that's what we've got to figure on right now.
I thought so. There's that cop. I'll lay you 10-to-1 it's the DA's car too.
watch your step now. Business as usual, and don't weaken.
Yeah.
it's me, laddie.
Hello, Mr. Sackett.
I'd better look at that fuse box just for the record.
I was just gonna try to find some new fuses.
right there at the top of the stepladder. - What's the ladder doing here?
I noticed some insulation worn off the feed wire, but I didn't get around to fixing it.
well, I'll be doggoned. Look at that!
Yeah, there's your cat.
deader than a doornail.
that's right. Remember? - Sure.
we were looking at her.
she must have walked off right onto the bare wire.
boy, those fuses blew out like a cannon!
cats are poor, dumb things. -Yeah.
they don't know a thing about electricity. - Killed her deader than a doornail.
Yes, the cat's dead, all right.
well, accidents can happen in the weirdest sort of ways.
so long, laddie.
I never saw a prettier cat.
killed her deader than a doornail.
Oh, Frank. - Easy, Cora. Easy.
lt was all my fault. -Mine too.
no, it was all my fault.
I was the one that thought it up, but you didn't want to.
but next time I'll listen to you. - Except there won't be any next time.
Oh, never. Never. - Listen, baby.
if Nick should die, they'll know.
they always find out. They guess it right just from habit.
I guess I'm not any braver than I thought I was...or else I wouldn't have been so scared.
I'm plenty scared too.
when all the lights went out...I was just a little girl again...afraid of the dark.
but from now on you'll be the brains of this outfit, and I'll work so hard for this place.
we can't make any plans until we find out about Nick.
Yeah, I know.
answer it.
Hello?
this is Nicholas. Mrs.Smith.
what?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, well...thank you so much for letting me know.
goodbye.
he's all right. They wanna keep him for a week, but he'll be okay.
now we can breathe again for a minute. - Just think.
a week. A whole week to work things out.
you give me a big kiss before I sock you.
you know, it's after 7: 00. We've got to get this place going for business.
that was the happiest week I'd ever spent in my life,
I wouldn't let myself think,
and Cora wouldn 't even discuss what was gonna happen when Nick came home,
all I cared about was her being happy,
and as for me, I felt as if I was riding on a cloud,
look at that, a battery and a whole set of plugs.
I'll say everything's fine around here. One sale.
will Mrs.Smith be tickled pink! Say, how about a nice cold drink on the house?
no. Nope, I've got to hurry.
so your boss is coming home? - Any day now.
today, you mean. Sure, I just passed the car coming from town.
that gorgeous blond was driving careful, and the old boy has a bandage on his head.
Oh, that poor little pussycat.
sure killed her. - Yep. Deader than a doornail, remember?
Yeah.
it was for her sake as well as mine that I knew I had to move on,
if I waited for them, I couldn't convince her to give up the place and go away with me,
and if I stayed there, I could see where she and I were headed,
but after a couple weeks in L,A, I sunk low enough to hang around a wholesale market, where they bought a lot of their stuff, hoping I'd run into her,
I just couldn't get her out of my mind, It kept nagging me all the time,
Hey, Frank!
I've been looking for you all over for weeks!
Hello, Nick. - Come on. Get in.
we're going back to Twin Oaks. - I can't.
something important' s happening tonight, and you're in on it.
besides, I wanna tell you about my accident.
that's the truth.
Yes, sir, I can show you the doctor's bill receipted.
that little business in the bathroom that night cost me $322, believe it or not.
that's a lot of hamburgers.
well, where did you come from?
I found him near the market.
Hello, Mrs. Smith. How have you been?
splendid, thank you. You're quite a stranger.
well, I've got work to do. Hope it was cooler in town.
it's a customer. Just a minute.
have you been thinking about me, Cora?
I couldn't forget you that quick.
how have you been? - All right.
have you got a little kiss for me?
we're going to have dinner in a few minutes, and you'd better get ready.
as a homecoming, this is the worst flop I ever saw in my life.
of course, they took a lot of x-ray pictures, but this is the one that makes it look worse.
what's this? A family album? -Sure.
there's my first license to sell food in Los Angeles County.
and that's a snapshot of Cora and me the day we were married.
wasn't she cute?
just a minute. I'll put the other light on.
which one of you two is working for the electric light company?
put on the lights again, Cora, please.
all right, waste your money.
the next time the electric light bill comes in, I'm not gonna be here to pay it.
you're not going to be here? - No.
Oh, now you've made me tell the big surprise before I was ready.
I'm selling the Twin Oaks.
well, that's not a very good joke.
it's not a joke. A fellow named Stanton said they're turning this road into a highway.
he's offering a big price for the place.
why sell now when it might turn out to be a gold mine?
somebody's bound to open up a better place and put us out of business.
but mainly, Cora, so as you can stop work and take it easy.
stop work? Where? Doing what?
we're going back to live with my sister. - Your sister?
Nick, you never even told me you had a sister.
well, I didn't want to worry you about her. You see...she hasn't been very well for a good many years.
where is she? - ln northern Canada. She's got a house.
of course, half of it belongs to me.
Nick, this is pretty sudden.
let me tell you what I think about it. - No, Cora.
this is best. -But, Nick, please.
let's talk this over. - No. There's nothing to talk over.
I've given it a good deal of thought. My mind's made up.
you thought it over and your mind's made up. Without even talking to me...your mind's made up. Well, mine isn't!
that's too bad.
you see, my sister recently became paralyzed.
she can't move at all.
Oh, she's going to live for a long time yet. I hope.
but she needs us to take care of her. Especially you, a woman.
Nick, you...You mean you want me to...?
Nick, don't sell the place! I'm telling you, don't sell it!
well, I'm...I'm going to sell it.
I'm superstitious. I...
never turn down a good offer. You always regret it.
I'm going to close the deal now before something happens to it.
excuse me. I'm gonna use the extension.
Hello, Mr.Stanton. This is Nicholas Smith.
Oh, Mr.Stanton, you've just bought a restaurant.
how soon can you have the papers ready to sign? And, of course, the check?
sure, I'll come to Santa Barbara on Wednesday. Oh, Mr.Stanton...I've located that fellow I said would be a wonderful manager.
Yeah. Sure, I'll bring him along.
Yeah. Goodbye, Mr.Stanton. Until Wednesday, 10 a.m. sharp.
now everybody's got something to celebrate.
my boy, you're gonna have a first - class job with a future!
Cora, my dear, in years to come, you'll thank me for this.
as for me, I'll have enough money to live out my days in the house where I was born.
what was good enough for my father is good enough for me.
come on. Let's get a good night's rest. We'll close up early tomorrow.
after a nice little supper party, we'll drive up to Santa Barbara.
wednesday at 10 a.m. sharp, we've all got ourselves set for life.
problem of the center?
well, My father been at his desk in The Tower at 7 am for the last thirty-five years.
two weeks in a row he has a no show. -That's weird.
thank god. You are Back, Daddy.
who the hell are you?
and Bridget is the new cleaner.
what am I, in the twilight zone?
we thought It would be a good idea to have Bridget provide assistance in the capture of Jarod.
all I know is that he is barking a lot of orders and all the smart people seem to be following them.
maybe he's part of the Triumvirate.
the Triumvirate?
what the hell would they be doing here?
seizing power?
their appearance certainly would explain your father's disappearance.
why would they make my father disappear?
because someone shot Raines.
they are not going to stop until they find out who did.
who is Mr. Lyle?
he's the boogeyman.
the money was removed from the Center offices on the home through electronicly
we're double checking the transfer records.
we're hoping its an accounting mistake.
Jarod stole fifteen million dollars of Centre funds and donated it to charity.
the only mistake is rubbing our noses in it.
"your welcome and surprisingly generous donation will help the organisation for years to come."
"the million dollars will bring much hope and joy to the children.
God Bless."
"Prayers be with you.
have a nice day."
I'll get him.
please do.
Jarod's a lot more dangerous than I thought.
I like ice cream.
I really like ice cream.
there you go Jarod. -Thank you Phil.
very interesting device.
it's a Wheelo.
and it's purpose is?
nothing. It just goes round and round and round.
so it chases itself in a circle?
Yep!
would you be interested in selling that for ten dollars.
sorry!
I couldn't. My grandpa gave it to me for my birthday.
sold!
thank you!
Wow!
hey Kiddo!
got you a burger, some fries.
gonna set you up nice here. Okay sir. Hey!
I'll be right back. Okay?
how are you doing Scooter?
Dewey! You, you shouldn't come around here.
how else are we supposed to get an ice cream cone.
freaky weather.
must be a hundred degrees in the shade.
you look good Scott.
what do you want Nick?
it's not what I want.
it's what I need . . . you.
Oh no. Not this time.
opportunity knocks.
Oh really?
because you know your last opportunity cost me seven years of my life.
Jeez! Come on.
ten months I've been out of prison.
I've just got my son back. Okay?
I'm not interested.
get interested.
dad?
Sean, go wait out front. I'll be right there.
go on Sean. You do as your daddy says now, okay?
but . . . -Just go, please.
I see your dilemma.
the deal is one job and you and I are history.
why don't you get Martinez?
dead. He said no.
crew?
the three of us plus one.
who opens the safe?
Trinnie's sending some guy in from Brooklyn.
one, um, R. H. Cross.
cross. I don't know him.
I don't know him either.
Trinnie swears by him even though he's only got one good arm.
a one armed safe cracker. That's . . .
I'm picking him up at three o'clock at the train station.
we start tonight.
Scottie, don't be late.
Hey! Okay. -What's that?
no. No. It's nothing.
these guys come back and give me a hard time.
hey nothing's wrong. Hey! Come here.
the train station.
leaving town?
business meeting.
yeah? What do you do?
I'm a one armed safe cracker.
yeah? Which arm?
it's a good question.
there are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be. In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
then one day, the pretender run away...
Jarod is at something.
I can feel it coming on like the flu."
after his recent brush with death perhaps he's just enjoying life for a bit.
maybe he decided to take a vacation.
did you eat the whole onion for breakfast?
Broots. -What?
sorry you missed the party in Omaha.
Jarod. What about Omaha?
Whoops! I guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time.
good thing they sent a replacement.
what are you talking about Jarod?
I'm talking about the blonde.
five - seven, hundred and twenty pounds, killer legs.
you're not giving up on me, are you Miss Parker?
you wish.
your attention please.
announcing the immediate arrival of the Brooklyn Express at platform sixteen. -That's my train. Gotta go.
what was that all about?
that's what I'd like to know.
R. H. Right hand.
don't look around. We're being watched.
cops?
listen up. I'm only going to say this once.
the location's changed. The new score is in Indianapolis.
I'm from Flatbush. I don't know anything about Iowa.
Indiana.
same thing.
I wrote down the locations, the security codes, the whole deal.
hey this ain't kosher.
I need to call Trinnie.
you do that and you lose this.
you get another package just like it when the job is finished.
target?
that's my business.
I'm gonna meet you in four days at the Hotel Argyle in New York.
I've reserved a room in your name.
what's to keep me from walking away with the whole thing?
you do that and I'm gonna hunt you down like I did Martinez.
then they'll be calling you "No Hands."
that's cold.
your attention please.
announcing the immediate departure of the Indiana Star. -That's your ride.
I want you to leave this at the job.
what is it?
it's a Hallmark card.
always send the very best.
leave it.
my tools are in there.
buy new ones.
because every cop along the line is looking for a man with a bum arm carrying a black leather bag.
I'll take the bag and the heat.
how are you going to do that?
see you in New York.
see you in New York. See you in New York.
your attention please.
will Mr Paul Johnson, please meet your party . . .
mr Cross.
call me R. H.
why wasn't I informed about Omaha?
no, no, no. Switch those masks, please.
with due respect Miss Parker, it's not my job to inform you of Jarod's whereabouts.
it's your job to inform me.
according to your file . . . -My file?
correct.
according to your file you've had Jarod trapped in Las Vegas, Chicago, Washington and Florida.
it seems you've had ample opportunity to bring him back.
how would you like me to feed you my file.
there's no reason to be defensive about your shortcomings Miss Parker.
moving in?
possession is nine-tenths.
now if you'll excuse us we have a meeting to attend.
Oh, any progress locating your missing father?
who says he's missing?
a man packs his belongings and vanishes it's a logical assumption.
you gave that paper weight to your father when you were a little girl.
I thought he threw it away.
I'm sure he's fine.
he would never just leave without saying goodbye, would he?
you're dead and the rest of us are in handcuffs.
twenty minutes.
that's all the time we got before security guard makes his run.
you're going to have to work faster to bypass that second alarm.
I'm working as fast as I can.
there was a day when you could have done it in your sleep.
remember those days Dewey?
scooter was the best I ever saw.
sixteen years old, picking combination locks down at the YMCA -
stealing wallets and jock straps.
what did you do with all those jock straps?
you know, it was a long time ago, Nick.
I took you off the streets.
I treated you like you were my own son.
Yeah! And when the heat was on you hang me out to spend seven years in a federal prison.
forgive me if I don't shed a tear about how things used to be.
I think we should cut him loose.
this job is going to be difficult enough in a perfect world.
I don't need a guy with his head half in the game.
I know him.
you on the other hand are a question mark.
should I call Trinnie and get another locksmith?
Nah!
let's try it again.
long night huh?
Yeah!
let's pick this up tomorrow night at my place.
you got a pen. I'll write down the address. -Yeah.
Oh thanks.
Oh here. Eight one six Highland.
eight one six Highland.
"to Dad, Love Sean." Is that your son?
my life.
he gave me this for father's day.
come along Jarod.
miss Parker just gave that man a present Sydney? Why?
it's father's day Jarod.
she gave her father a gift to show how much she loves him.
you want me to put this out on the net for you?
Oh yeah. I want to know who he is and where he comes from.
I bet my pension there's someone out there looking for this guy.
the part is still going to be the rent-a-cops
Oh I never thought I'd need this again.
what? Can't open a door you blow it off its hinges?
you never know what you might run into.
sometimes looking dangerous is enough.
Sean, what are you doing here?
I live here.
no. No. You know what I mean.
you're supposed to be at Mrs Albertson's.
I went to the shop.
they said that you didn't show up today.
no I didn't.
actually that was my fault.
I saw some of the furniture your father built and I suggested we meet right away.
my name is Cross. RH Cross.
rh stands for Right Hand.
what's that stuff?
Oh well you never mind that stuff.
if your probation officer catches you skipping work you're going to be in big trouble.
I don't want anything to happen to us.
who's . . . . who's the father here.
now I want you to go back to Mrs Albertson's house and you stay there 'til I pick you up.
but . . . -Just do what I say . . .
wait, wait, wait. Sean. Hey. Listen.
I just . . . I just need you to cut me a little slack here.
Hey! I love you.
I love you too.
see you Right Hand.
nice to meet you Sean.
so why are you doing this?
what?
why are you doing this job?
you don't want to be doing it.
which means that Avani is holding some sort of big hammer over your head.
Oh I never knew my parents.
Sean's mother passed away after he was born and I was sent up a year later, you know.
they passed Sean around from family to family like I was.
but you got him back.
and I intend to keep him.
Sean needs his father forever.
you need to finish the last simulation.
I made this for you Sydney.
for me?
do you like it?
no Jarod, I don't like it and I don't want to ever see anything like it again.
let's get to work.
we just received these from our satellite office in Indianapolis.
his name's RH Cross.
he's a safe cracker from New York.
and we should be interested because . . ?
according to the office Cross's take was nearly a quarter million dollars.
he also left this behind.
according to the red notebook
cross was going to rendezvous with Jarod at the Argyle Hotel in New York City.
Jarod would never leave such an obvious trail.
cross screwed up and left that behind.
that's quite a reach.
according to the security on the ground in Indianapolis
cross was nearly caught.
Bridget go to New York. Find Cross.
I still don't understand the significance of this.
Jarod's sending you two a message.
which is?
you're going nowhere fast.
we got eighteen minutes until the security guard makes his round.
I don't like this.
that van followed us ever since we left the warehouse.
the cop's have made us. -If they have...
...then they're still following Dewey all over the city.
I've got every contingency covered.
let's just do it.
how long?
five minutes.
you've got three.
what the hell is that?
he's early.
twenty minutes huh?
what is it?
the guard.
how long before you're in?
two minutes.
Oh. What are you going to do?
I'm covering contingencies.
I'm in.
you stole an electronic key card?
it opens the federal diamond depository in Wilmington.
what are you talking about?
he's saying there is no money.
just another job.
that's what this has been about since the very beginning. Right?
twenty million dollars in raw uncut diamonds.
my source says that the stones will spend thirty-six hours in the vault before distribution.
we move on Monday before the offices open up and anyone realises the access card is missing.
our deal was one job.
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that Scottie.
change your mind the door's always open.
best laid plans huh?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Dewey, this is Nick.
Hey! You okay?
Oh, I'm fine. Good.
I guess this sort of thing happens when you deal with a piece of work like Avani.
what's wrong?
this is too easy.
what is? -This.
Nick would never let me walk out with this much on the line, not unless . . .
you got a car?
Yeah, come on.
Sean. Answer me.
the house is empty.
I'm really sorry Scottie but there's no way I can let this opportunity slip away.
I need you.
your Sean is safe.
how safe he stays is up to you.
research five took it off the National Police Net.
why would Jarod's picture be on a law enforcement scan?
well according to the background data he's suspected of being part of a robbery group here in the North East.
what did you say?
the initial scan was sent by a detective Harold Evans of the Middletown PD
Middletown?
that's less than a hundred miles from here.
the question now is what is Jarod doing associating with a group of street criminals.
well actually this crew is slicker than that.
they have an MO of targeting high profile, high tech takedowns.
such as?
such as, um, payroll companies, security houses, mostly diamonds.
run profiles on all the potential targets within a five hundred mile radius of The Centre.
everything this crew might be interested in and I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans.
if he stole a Baby Ruth when he was six
I want to know how many nuts it had.
I've been going over the layout of the vault room.
I'm thinking we've got a better chance of blowing the inner doors.
sounds right.
what do you think Scottie?
I want him back.
I'm here right?
that's what you wanted.
now you give me back my boy.
focus, for the kid's sake.
these doors are only reinforced steel so we should. . .
where my son is. And I want to know right now.
you pull the trigger on me, you pull the trigger on Sean.
Scottie let him go.
Where's Sean? Where's my boy?
we finish this job you and Sean'll be back together again, I promise.
give me the gun.
give me the gun!
anything happens to my boy, you'll wish I'd killed you.
never underestimate the father-son relationship.
Jarod, I told you, I can't accept this.
but I made it for you.
I'm not your father.
this card is meant for someone else.
don't you love me Sydney?
we have work to do.
it smells like gin in here.
what the hell is this?
I don't have the time or inclination to banter with you detective so I will get right to the point.
you got a name?
let's just say that I'm the person who holds your pitiful little life in her hands.
is that so?
you tell me.
go ahead, open it.
Where'd you get these?
that's not important.
what is, is that multiple copies are in my possession.
good.
you put this picture out on the police net.
so?
I want him.
can't help you.
I want him!
I'm sorry for both our sakes.
I think I know where they're gonna hit next.
relax your prostate boys.
we've got Jarod nailed to the wall.
the blonde's gonna bust a G-String when she . . .
what?
please continue.
and while you're at it, maybe you can explain this.
I spoke to RH Cross in New York.
he was sent to rob the Centre's office in Indianapolis by a man matching Jarod's description.
we did try to warn you about that.
and how was Detective Evans?
you had me followed?
yes I did.
and I want to know everything you know and I want to know now.
Jarod's become part of a robbery crew.
evans thinks their next target will be the Federal Diamond Depository in Wilmington.
I think we should blanket the area and grab the whole bunch on the way in.
I disagree.
Oh what a surprise.
you have a better plan?
you've tried the open snare approach before.
Jarod's too smart to let us grab him on the outside.
you let him inside the vault, lull him into a false sense of security and get him . . . clean.
why don't we just mail him the diamonds and call it a day.
I know Jarod, the way he thinks.
yet you still can't catch him.
ladies! We follow Bridget's plan.
mr Broots you'll be given complete control of the security system at the diamond depository.
you can do that?
suggest you visit the building and begin implementing a total lockdown of the facility.
I don't believe this will work.
I think it's time to end this pursuit of Jarod once and for all.
you can do that?
Dewey got these photos of the Depository this morning and the keycard will allow us to penetrate the outside security system.
bodies on the ground?
minimal.
I made the lock system this morning.
it's hard wired infra-red.
can you beat it?
Yeah! I can beat it.
we have no problem then.
Oh no. Not now.
what did you say?
ah Nothing.
you look a little shook up.
no. No I'm fine.
we're all set then.
Oh no.
the coloured areas represent access points at the depository.
when the grid is red the building is locked down.
when it's green obviously it's not.
my guess is that Jarod and his crew will disarm the video monitoring system as soon as they gain entry but it won't matter though because I'm the only one with the password to the system.
very impressive Mr Broots.
I'm confident that Mr Broots has covered all contingencies.
are you confident Mr Broots?
here we go!
alright. They're inside.
let's end this.
not yet.
not yet?
he's sitting there waiting for us . . .
and knowing that gives us the upper hand.
the advantage of surprise.
your point?
we have him Mr Lyle.
let's not make another mistake.
what is that? What're are you doing?
I could stop and could explain it to you or I could just do it and get the hell out of here.
the choice is yours.
Jarod would never have walked in here without a plan to walk out.
we stay the course.
look, you want to sit on your collective thumbs, fine.
I'm going to do my job.
I won't allow you to compromise this situation.
you're going to shoot me?
done.
what happened?
drill bit cracked.
you got another one? -Yeah in my bag.
I'll get it. -No. No No. I'll get it.
I know where it is.
pull out the broken bit.
make it fast.
Scottie, give me a hand over here will you?
just one second. I'm nearly done.
now.
Yeah! Sure.
Hey!
you open these doors.
I want Scottie's son brought back to him.
open the doors.
what are you doing?
maybe you don't understand English.
I want Sean released.
I know Dewey's got him so you call him and you tell him to cut him loose.
you open the door or you die.
go ahead.
tell him Scottie.
Nick don't.
shoot.
you see, sometimes looking dangerous is enough and sometimes it's not.
now call him!
dial!
this is Nick.
let the kid go.
Yes! Right now!
the phone?
hm, hm, hm. You should have called Trinnie.
Scottie, you let me out of here.
you know, every night for ah, seven years
I thought about, you know, what you were doing.
and then when I get out, finally get my life back, you take my son?
Scottie that was business.
this is personal.
let's get out of here.
don't leave me here.
Scottie! Don't leave me here! Scottie!
Hey! I've got two on the move.
give me my gun.
if you want Jarod, give me my gun.
tell the sweeper teams to move.
wait. What the hell is this?
all the access points in the building are unlocking.
one area's still secured? What's that?
Oh! Oh! Oh my God!
like I was so scared, you know.
are you okay?
I'm okay.
you're fine? You're fine?
dad, don't make a big deal.
Oh! Oh!
look, I hate to break this up but don't you think you two should be hitting the road?
here, take this with you.
don't worry, it's money that was owed to me.
Ah, you know, I don't understand.
consider it an early father's day present.
good luck huh?
Thanks.
good luck.
hope your stay at the depository wasn't too unpleasant?
you made quite an impression on the new regime.
I hope this doesn't end up making things harder for you.
well, I appreciate your concern but that's not why I called.
I've been thinking, and I was wondering if you ever thought about
I tell you that all the weirdness around here is courtesy of Mr Skin Grafts himself.
the place has been different ever since... - Since Raines was shot.
I'm no marksman. - I didn't even want to take a gun, remember?
if I'd shot Sterno head he would be snoring through dirt right now instead of filling bed-pans in The Centre's burn unit.
the Centre cut you out of the loop this time.
good thing they sent a replacement.
what are you talking about Jarod? - I'm talking about the blonde.
any progress locating your missing father?
who says he's missing?
it's time to come home Jarod.
take my hand.
I can't reach you mum.
try. You can do it.
mum!
mum, don't go.
mum, mum
don't go.
this is where Jarod spent most of his time while he stayed with us.
in a tepee?
Yeah. But no, this is a sensory deprivation tank.
I'm surprised he'd get near one of these things again.
but Jarod enjoyed floating in the tank.
it gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved.
most people go in the tank for an hour at a time.
Jarod, Jarod would stay in for days at a time.
and then he'd come out and go around hugging everyone he saw.
I never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life.
maybe if you showered once in a while the experience wouldn't be quite so unique.
did Jarod leave anything behind?
he said to give you this.
thank you.
I have a gun and I'll use it.
cool!
let's go find the wonder boy.
living in a tepee, somebody help me.
help! Someone please help me.
help me, please.
Ah...I'm coming. Just hang on.
Jarod. Wait for the basket.
there's no time. This rope's not going to hold.
Roger, call the chopper now.
Ah...Just hang on. More line.
Jarod what the hell are you doing? I said wait for the basket.
sit tight. I've got you.
it's a great day to be alive.
there are pretends among us. Geniuses with the ability to become anyone they want to be. In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
then one day, the pretender ran away...
the word from the hospital is your victim is going to be fine.
well that's great news.
and the word around here is that you're a player.
you should have seen him.
instant legend, man.
you'd better watch out Bobby. Looks like there's a new Spider man in town.
yeah well we'll see who has the web.
spider man? - Yeah! Like in the comics.
Hey, guys. Look, interstate brochures from Denver. Looks like he's serious.
are you thinking of transferring out?
retiring. Denver is where my grandson is.
come on you guys. This is a good thing.
makes room for the young guys moving up.
okay. Pack and stack. We're due at the tower in thirty.
Oh man. This is the third drill this week.
get used to it. When Bobby makes captain he'll drill us 24/7.
you've got that right.
Jarod, everybody kicks in.
it's SOP.
it's sort of a ritual.
every time we come back safe from a run we drop in a fiver for Chris.
he's the guy who fell from the drill tower? - Just come out of coma.
I thought the department insurance plan covered accidents.
it does cover accidents. But, ah...Chris tried to kill himself.
where have you guys been?
we've been to our own little corner of heaven.
got you something.
Thanks.
you wouldn't believe what's going on around here.
I rarely do.
any word on my father?
no. No one knows where he is.
there's Princess Tryhard now.
we don't want to make accusations you can't prove.
Oh, Please. Sydney you know what do yourself a favour.
take some steroids.
ever since she and Mr Lyle showed up this whole place has gotten strange.
well it's just about to get stranger. There he is?
that's the guy.
Oh God! They're coming this way.
Oh, Miss Parker. Sydney. Mr.Broots.
this is Dr Curtis.
he's consulting for Mr Lyle and me.
nice to meet you.
I'm sure.
if he needs to speak with you, we'd appreciate it if you made yourself available.
certainly.
Cheers. Shall we?
doctor.
who is he? - That's what I've been trying tell you.
he's some kind of criminal behaviourist.
they brought him here to find who shot Mr Raines.
Oh God this is bad, this is really, really bad.
relax Broots.
they're looking for a shooter not a whiner.
yeah well they're going to pin the shooting on someone
and the way I figure we're the ones walking around with the biggest targets on our backs.
if you're innocent you have nothing to worry about.
sydney this is the Centre.
maybe no one will miss you but I have a little daughter who loves her daddy.
we don't even know if he will want to talk to us.
fat chance.
I hear Mr Raines is going to force everyone who was at the shooting to interview with this guy.
and I mean everyone.
move it! Come on Jarod! Your victim's had time to take in a double feature.
go, go, go, go...
move it! - Two minutes...
2'1," 2'2," 2'3," 2'4," 2'5," 2'6" - Move it, here now, hold the way 2'7," not bad.
not good either not for a simple up and over.
Hey, Keep it down over there.
I'm trying to think over here.
Oh God we woke up the monster.
who's that?
he likes to be called Spenser.
all he does is complain about the noise and write poetry.
don't get him going. You'll have to buy him something.
is this where Chris tried to kill himself?
Roger found him right here.
you know I thought Chris and I could tell each other everything.
I knew he was depressed but he never said anything about suicide.
maybe it wasn't?
he left a note on his computer.
you know I saw this happen in Chicago.
this guy, he got really depressed about the job
all the pressure.
Nah! It wasn't the job. Chris loved Rescue.
well if it wasn't the job maybe it was his family.
his mother left when he was really little. She just walked out.
after his dad died a couple of years ago Chris started looking for her.
he didn't find her? - No.
but he felt she was close by.
he ran personal ads in the paper, searched the net, did everything he could think of.
he probably thought he would never find her,
that he would always have that feeling of empty
I can't imagine what it would be like never knowing your mother.
usar Member Attempts Suicide at Training Facility
mom, Please call me, Chris 555-0154
grace Welman Where are you? Call Chris 555-0154
Chris, Chris, You need to be calm.
Chris, Chris, You need to calm down.
calm now. Please.
calm now, Please! Chris
I'm sorry
this is a really bad time for visitors.
Chris, No. Come on, it's okay.
Chris, Chris. Calm down.
please could you come back later? - It's not unusual for a post coma to lose sense of time and location.
he's afraid.
he needs human contact. He needs to know that he's loved.
are you a therapist?
I know what it's like to be isolated from people.
Jo - Ellen, come here.
hold him.
go ahead. He's still your friend. Hold him.
Chris, Chris, It's Jo - Ellen. Sh, Sh, it's alright.
it's okay, it's alright.
let's go over this again
because I want to get it straight.
he was a spider and a man.
no.
he was a high school student bitten by a radioactive spider.
that must hurt.
then he developed spider powers.
he could climb up walls, shoot webs
and he had spider sense.
which is?
I don't know. His head would tingle and stuff.
Oh well I wasn't aware that arachnids had heads that tingled.
I don't know from arachnids but Spider man's did.
this is fascinating.
I'll read them all.
grace WELMAN WHERE ARE YOU? CALL CHRIS 555-0154
Mrs Welman. My name is Jarod. I'm a friend of Chris.
Hi, You have the wrong person. My name's Carter.
I know it was before you were married.
what do you want? - It's not what I want but what Chris wants.
he's been trying to find you.
Mrs. Welman, your son needs you.
I didn't ask to be needed
and I sure as well didn't ask to be found.
mum. I love you.
I love you, mum.
mum, I love you.
don't leave me mum.
mum.
mum, don't go!
mum. mum, don't go!
did your mother ever hug you?
it's important that you get in the tank.
what was it like to be hugged by your mother?
how does it feel?
that's not relevant.
Jarod the tank relaxes you. You can focus on the simulation.
I want to know what it's like to be hugged.
I've forgotten what it feels like.
Jarod, listen to me. You will never have that experience.
your mother is . . .
it will be best if you just forgot about her.
dwelling on your family will only get in the way of your work.
finding my family is my work, Sydney.
we're only trying to find out who had the capacity to shoot Mr Raines.
and I'm only here to help.
look I realise this is a difficult position for you.
but it's just a waste of both of our times.
you never married did you?
you don't expect me to answer rhetorical questions?
no.
tell me about your relationship with Jarod.
why don't you tell me.
alright.
I think he's taken the role of the son you never had.
what are your feelings for him?
you're doing so well. Don't stop now.
I think you love Jarod very much
I think you would almost do anything to protect him.
but I'm curious, off the record. How do you live with yourself knowing that you abducted a child from his family?
I was not involved in Jarod's abduction.
but after it happened you did nothing about it.
you had no problem and no twinge of conscience about robbing him of a chance to live a normal life?
I didn't have a choice.
didn't you?
I had to do what I was told.
by whom?
the same person who tells you what to do.
exactly.
so we both know that you hold Mr Raines personally responsible for the destruction of Jarod's life
and we also know that killing Raines would give you a deep sense of satisfaction. It's only human nature.
I abhor violence.
well, but that doesn't mean given a strong enough motivation, that you wouldn't stoop to it.
I think we're done, Doctor.
don't look so sad.
it's a comic book, man.
you know, comic, fun?
this Spider man, he's a fascinating superhero.
yet beneath all these heroics he's lead a very sad life.
he never knew his parents, he feels responsible for his uncle's death people are always trying to kill him.
curse of the superhero. It's tragic really.
Peter Parker didn't have a real problem.
now She-Hawk her life was tragic.
I'm glad you guys are here.
check your speed scores.
the condemned move faster to the gallows.
looks like we're going to be in for more drilling.
you've got that right
now Jarod you work with Roger Saturday morning
Jo-Ellen you and Bobby hit the tower in the afternoon.
let me switch with Jarod. I have plans for Saturday.
change em. There's no one faster with the rope than Bobby that's where you need improvement.
and just think, you can sleep in on Saturday and get some extra beauty sleep not that you need it.
no I'm serious Captain. Let me switch.
I'm serious too. No.
now come on we've got more sunshine to spread.
see you later.
what's Chris working with?
a bungie cord. It helps strengthen his muscles.
very clever. A rubber band with hooks.
that's the concept.
what are his chances for recovery?
too soon to say. But I'm an optimist.
he could regain a good portion of his cognitive and motor skills.
has he been able to communicate anything about his fall?
no.
there has been some improvement with his pre- and post- traumatic amnesia but still, no indication that he has any memory of the accident.
there must have been some damage to his frontal lobe.
more than likely he never had time to encode the event into his long time memory.
you don't know about bungie cords
but you know about Deerling's theory on shock trauma.
I used to moonlight as a psychological re-constructionist.
and I read his file.
it says here that Chris landed on his back.
that's right.
the haematoma on his twelfth thoracic vertebrae would indicate that he fell on something.
paramedics didn't note it.
I would have expected his injuries to be more severe a fall from four stories. It's usually fatal.
were you a triage surgeon too?
only until I became a rodeo clown.
no.
no. No...
Hey. I wanna hear something that loud I'll stick a gun in my mouth.
hey I'm sorry. I just fell off a building.
Hey, wait, Wait up. I want to talk to you for a second.
don't you have anything better to do at 3 am?
it's 7 am. - Yup.
the noise pollution gets worse every day.
if you're so concerned about the noise why don't you move into a shelter?
Hey, hey, a poet needs freedom to create.
this is freedom. haha...
wow -Yeah
the only drawback is the noise.
it's forcing me toward Haiku.
were you here writing your poetry the day that the man fell from the building?
uh, Yeah. Yeah. You see I was flowing a rhyme when all of a sudden I heard somebody screaming "No No No Don't!"
kinda like you were doing. And then and then Boom.
after a little while all hell broke loose.
sirens, ambulances, cops.
I tell you my creativity was shot for the day.
I've seen the police report. There's no mention that you ever told the police what you heard.
no. No see, I didn't tell the cops. I told one of you rescue guys.
who? - I do not know.
I mean, this guy, he, he came up and he said sorry about the noise and gave me twenty bucks and told me to get a hot meal.
and that, my friend, it's poetic.
what did he look like?
golden, gear and helmets and everything all you guys look the same.
Hey, hey. You know what?
he had some sort of fancy money chip.
it had sort of like a, ah, a spider web design right in the middle.
water melon, right?
Yeah. That's what we call them here on earth. Tonight's dessert.
why are you banging them?
I'm not banging, I'm clumping.
how do you tell when watermelon's ripe?
I don't know. I've never eaten one.
well Starman, you're definitely in for a treat. We're all chipping in so you owe me five bucks.
five bucks huh?
actually I don't have any cash on me.
come on man. Hey! Nobody gets out of paying.
what's the matter? Mummy didn't give you any lunch money today?
something like that. Can you cover me? - Yeah.
you will pay me back, right? - Of course I will.
if we can't trust each other who can we trust?
right.
I got word that you ah ...
come in.
Sit!
cute kids.
I've been looking over your file.
there's a letter in here from a Mrs Mosely.
what, my fourth grade teacher?
how far back does that thing go? - The letter is addressed to your mother.
apparently Mrs Mosely was concerned for your safety at school.
why was that?
you know how kids are, you know. They like to pick on the egg head.
do you remember what it felt like to be picked on?
yes I guess so, when I think about it.
you're next.
so did you ever attempt to defend yourself against those bullies.
the bullies. No.
actually no, I learned how to outsmart them.
what about today?
how do you respond to people who pick on you today.
no one bullies me - Really
I was under the impression that Miss Parker often teased your task.
she likes to tease me. Friends do that.
Oh so you two are friends?
well, ah no, wait a minute, not, ah, not exactly.
let's go.
how does Mr Raines treat you?
Mr. Raines.
always Um has treated me fairly with great respect.
that's very interesting because it says in here that you have been overheard disparaging him on more than one occasion.
that's...that's a flat out lie.
who said that? I would like to know who said that.
that would be ah Mr Raines.
it must eat you up knowing that people have picked on you your whole life, and you've always had to take it, never getting to even the score.
how long will you let people demean and belittle you until you finally say "enough, it ends here"
how much humiliation can you take? - I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get inside my head stir it up a bit
well it's not going to work.
you, Let's go.
I want to stay here.
Hey, Hey you. Leave her alone!
what are they going to do with her.
what do you think they're going to do to her? Are they going to hurt her?
the way Mr Raines implied that he would do to your daughter.
do you want to know the truth.
I'll give you the truth. If anyone was ever to hurt my daughter, even tried to hurt my daughter I'd kill them.
I don't care who.
I'd kill them.
sydney - How's the book?
I'm not sure how Judge Teale is going to wrap this one up.
how did you know?
you always used to sit down at your desk at eight p.m. with a good book.
does it still relax you?? - You know me too well.
I can hear birds in the background. It must still be light where you are.
you're getting very good at this.
I can also hear sadness in your voice.
I guess you know me too well.
I've been thinking about my mother lately.
what it's going to be like when we finally meet.
go on.
how to say, It's just that we've been separated for so long.
will she ...
never mind.
everyone wants to believe that their mother's love is absolute.
sadly that's not always the case.
did your mother love you?
Yes, I believe she did, but know this. If the mother rejects her offspring rarely does the blame fall upon the child.
it is usually an indication that the woman does not love herself.
thank you, Sydney.
Hey! I told you to leave me alone.
this will help when the methadone doesn't.
you were at the free clinic getting your daily dose but methadone it doesn't stop the craving for heroin it only replaces it.
that's why you still keep getting the sweats. Your body is screaming for relief.
are you a junkie?
no but I was a congressional adviser on drug policy for a while.
Scout's honour.
this is arginine root. It's an organic herb. It has a great calming affect.
friends of mine, they harvest it in Oregon.
trust me it works.
Oh, Damn it.
is this Chris?
yes when he was eleven years old. His poppa sent it to me at a halfway house.
it's hard to be carrying around a picture of someone that you're trying to forget.
I'm not trying to forget. It would just be better if we don't see each other.
is that why you went to the hospital?
I checked the sign in sheet at intensive care.
you didn't think people would recognise your maiden name.
they told me that Chris was in a coma. They didn't know if he was going to live or not.
I did what any mother would do. I went to see my son.
I didn't have the strength to open the door.
this is my mother.
I only remember seeing her once.
I don't know much about her
but I do know that I would give anything to feel her arms around me.
listen if you're...If you're gonna tell me that Chris needs me and the past doesn't matter, save it.
I've always been a great addict but I'm worthless as a mother.
grace you're a person with a disease.
a disease that controlled your life.
it kept you from the people that you love but somewhere you found the courage to fight it.
maybe if you look there again you will find the way to make things right with your son.
Hey, Jo-Ellen.
where is everybody?
around somewhere.
really.
it's funny because I only saw your car out there in the parking lot.
Yeah.
please Bobby, I have work to do.
the Captain assigned that to you?
Yes! And he wants it done before he comes in.
I guess that means that when I make Captain you'll do exactly what I say.
don't.
I don't like games.
you'll never guess what I just found.
hey Jarod I didn't see your car outside.
I took the bus.
a seedless watermelon.
now, I wonder how they get them out.
Yeah.
I've got some work I got to do.
I'll talk to you later.
if I'm tired you must be exhausted.
Why? - Well not only do you have to work train all day like the rest of us but you have to put up with him.
what you mean?
looking over your shoulder. Constant wondering when he'll show up.
what he'll want.
the rage, the powerlessness.
I know that it would eat at me until I wanted to scream.
at first it seemed liked harmless flirting.
I thought I could handle it. Handle Bobby.
but he's so aggressive.
he scares me.
being the only woman you must have felt trapped.
well I knew that if I complained to the Commander I would get nothing but flak.
Bobby would only deny it and I would become the black sheep of the squad, if I wasn't fired.
believe me it's hard enough being one of the boys around here.
so I just kept my mouth shut.
and then Chris found out?
one night Bo...Bobby touched me and I was upset. Chris comforted me.
he was such a great guy, you know.
as if dealing with his own problems wasn't enough he wanted to take care of me too.
he was really angry with Bobby.
he even wrote up a report but, you know, I couldn't sign it.
well you should've.
you're not the first woman to feel this way.
Bobby's done this before, in Portland.
he almost lost his job.
his wife nearly left him but he intimidated the victim until she dropped the charges.
I don't know.
he's connected Jarod. Bobby's about to become Captain.
even if I take him on, he'll win.
don't be so sure.
thank you for coming, Miss Pakrer
I realise this interview is unpleasant.
just know that my intention is to eliminate people as possible suspects not incriminate them.
considering I'm on record as having threatened to shoot Raines, I'm would think that I'm your number one suspect.
and I suppose we're having this meeting in my father's former office because Raines thinks that it will unnerve me.
I'm not sure that I know what you mean.
my father has disappeared and some Ralph Reed clone has replaced him.
exactly what part of this is hard to grasp,
doctor?
let's move on.
now you've known Jarod since you were a little girl.
what is your relationship with him now?
my relationship...is to find him and bring him back...
preferably alive but dead is becoming more acceptable.
so wouldn't it have bothered you if Mr Raines had shot Jarod?
not at all.
mind if I smoke?
you make no effort at all to conceal your hostility towards Mr Raines.
is that because you felt protected by your father?
I don't need Daddy to protect me from Scar man.
would you care to expand on that?
I think he was involved in the death of my mother and knows what happened to my father.
what makes you think that?
woman's intuition.
so it is safe to say that it would give you great satisfaction to see him dead.
it would give me great satisfaction to perform his autopsy, before he was dead.
miss Parker. When you came in here I had no opinion one way or the other as to your involvement in the shooting of Mr Raines.
however, you must admit your excessive candour ...
if I'd shot you, you son of a bitch, you'd be dead.
are we clear?
hey Poet! Do you like watermelon?
yeah -911
we've got a bridge worker stuck on a scaffold.
when are these morons going to learn?
where is everybody?
just you and me. - Let's do it!
looks like a heart attack. I'm going over.
not this time Spider man. I'm in charge here.
I'm going over.
okay. More line.
nice and easy.
nice and easy.
more line.
what are you doing?
I need more ropes.
okay.
are you crazy?
just making sure that you're still high enough.
for what? - Your fall.
what the hell are you doing?
Yep. That' ll work.
see you Bobby.
Jarod, Jarod. Ah...What the hell are you doing?
what you did to Chris Welman when he threatened to expose your sexual harassment of Jo-Ellen.
hey what kind of sick joke is this?
Oh this is no joke Bobby.
at least I'm not laughing.
you don't know what you're talking about man.
you had to stop him. You had your promotion to lose.
no, man.
so you followed Chris Welman up to the training tower and you cut his rappelling rope.
and then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.
that's a lie man. The man left a note.
which you wrote on his computer.
now if it makes you feel any better I'll write one on yours.
no, please
look alright, alright. I cut his rope.
I did it. Right.
now please, pull me back up out of here man.
no way!
now that was poetic. Ha ha ha.
Wow!
it's about time Dr Curtis.
have you reached a conclusion? - Yes
and your determination?
any one of them could have done it.
not very satisfying doctor.
I'm very sorry Mr Raines.
that is the only conclusion I can come to based on my evaluations.
get out!
perhaps Mr Parker knows who pulled the trigger.
wherever he is.
I did what you wanted.
I told them it could have been any one of them.
this is who I believe actually shot him.
so, we're even.
for now.
usar Staffer Held In Attempted to Murder Of Crew Member
is there any progress?
it seems to vary with his mood.
if we could a way of keeping his spirits up
I understand the pressure that you're under, I do.
daddy, daddy. I know how patient you have been with my handling of Jarod, but,
no more excuses. I...wasn't finished.
what?
I thought you came here to kill me.
better to find the story.
who are you?
my name is Igor.
let me go, Frankenstein. - I'm going to...
beautiful, beautiful.
people think spontaneous combustion is a myth.
I don't. I wouldn't be caught dead because of combustion in my pocket. Hey, look at this.
focus.
there must be an connection between "ring a bell" and the Frankenstein movie.
do you remember any of the dialogue?
something like:
"who are you?"
"my name is Igor."
Hey, Son of Frankenstein!
basil Rathbone goes back to his dad's castle and meets lgor, Bela Lugosi.
and they bring the monster back to life.
it's not a Jesus James Whale's movie, but, it's definitely get a chatter.
Oh, you are a lonely man, aren't you?
look. It's an angel with the broken wing.
perhaps Jarod perceives himself as a fallen angel?
or he simply forgot to put the caution fragile tags on the box?
hey look!
igor knows the secret.
what's secret?
the Center throw a rock in you head one.
I am calling Bjorn to getting...Broots, why don't you watch Son of Frankenstein again, and see if Basil is a wonder boy.
we have half of our sweepers out there looking for him.
we are gonna find him.
and when we do, we'll have a little spontaneous combustion of my own in mind.
that's him! Get him!
I'll get him out!
mark, get in!
there are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
thirty-six hours, he's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
how many people died because what I thought up?
since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
he is a pretender.
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
the Center wants him alive. - Preferably.
he defends the weak and abused.
life is a gift.
the PRETENDER -=YTET PRESENTS=
you are a doctor?
I am today.
end, cut!
beautiful work, Jarod.
that is what I get paid for.
they said that you are the hottest new special ... in town that I realised that matter literally!
thank you for coming.
I just never doubt I get invited to alive at your resume.
it's a clever idea, really sense.
although I've been wondering why a special effects coordinator will actually do that fire stunt himself.
no one pulls the stunt design unless I try to first myself.
noble. - Smart, considering the accident on the Blaster Beer set last week.
I figured the FX coordinator was a little smart that's exactly what you mean.
producing a Super Sunday can pay a new beer, can make a break of an agency.
the accident put it on jeopardy.
which is what I have wanted you to see for yourself how my effects ... Say!
bit better. With commercial time in three million per thirty,
I need Pavarotti.
what? - And how is lgor?
he'd better not snore.
Oh, sounds the noisy makes keep you up,
so sharp toe nails.
it's all funny, Jarod.
will you tell me what it means? - Ask lgor.
right. "He knows the secret."
can we do the kwit dance another time?
sure, if you tell the secret of who I am.
you know I cann't help you with that one.
well, then I cann't help you with this one.
but I have a god's feeling.
you figure it all out.
what' re you looking at?
and now we've got Marianne Bosha live on the scene.
friendship and Fire. As tragedy struck at the filming of Blaster beer commercial.
stuntman Dave Dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma. who attending to drive this Cadillac through out an exploding billboard.
although a small explosion was planned witnesses describe the one occurred as massive.
well, our thoughts and prayers, at secure ...as well as Blaster brewery, that make us blaster beers all with Dave Dugger and Dugger family.
we all wish Dave Dugger's recovery.
in meantime, we want an internal investigation to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident.
adding irony a pain, this stunt was maximized by Dugger's long time FX coordinator, and childhood friend Mickey Clausen.
Dave and me have done some of the stunts a hundred times.
I ... I ... don't know what went wrong.
Dave is my best friend.
excuse me.
Dave Dugger's hospitalized in the intense care unit of Queen of Hope hospital.
his prognosis remains uncertain.
"tragedy on Blaster Beer Set"
we thought it's a lot of times expensive in this campaign, Jarod.
blaster brewery spend millions to launch this new beer.
that's why I hire Jarod, Mr. Connelly. He will make your beer blast through America's TV on Super Sunday.
I like ...Let me show you what we have in mind.
you remember Ray Slater. He's my assistant. - I was Mickey Clausen's assistant.
we redesigned the stunt, so that the Blast trajectory blows over the car, it'll be safer, yet larger blast.
Hey, Jarod, you have to show your brainstorm to the director.
LAN? Ian? - Yes.
LAN Tottenham, this is Jarod Lugosi, a new special effects coordinator.
Hello, Jaord.
we've all seen explosions, but we need the audience to feel the explosion, touch it, taste it, cry for it.
excuse me.
cry for it?
he's pump us and then secure, but he want a clear directing might... glue spot.
sounds revealing.
so you are up to speed on the campaign concept?
well, I've never actually seen any of the commercials.
show him spots.
the campaign concept involves around two young guys.
Sean and Joey.
who finds tickets to the big game - In a case of Blaster beer.
so now they are driving across America... - In Blaster mobile to make a time for gig-off. - the gig get them lost.
in our first spot, they winded in Louisiana and an old Cajun guy tells them to go west.
so they blast off... - And they end up here
wow, check it out, dude!
polar bears, penguins, Santa Clause.
dude, I don't think this is California!
no, man. This is Cream Day.
let's punk!
aren't they big talking frogs!
so who are these talking frogs?
last year's big commercial?
this year will be all Sean and Joey who in the last spot finally make it to California - But they ... - use too much Blaster power and they end up overshooting in San Diego when they are crashing a billboard on a beach in Tijuana.
isn't that great?
so let me get this straight.
there are people out there who will buy your beers based upon two guys who are not only two ... to read a map. But simple-minded enough to drive through an exploding billboard?
that's our target market.
Jarod, we've got three days to finish this spot make it on your date.
can you make a scene?
like Pavarotti.
I need some remote control to do whatever it does but I can't find it.
I'm sure it's where about its line with the clues he's given us.
come on, lgor, do something.
catch on fire, ring a bell...
help me!
Syd, give me your cell phone.
Audio-sense triggering mechanism.
just like spontaneous combustion that blew up that crate in my office.
Jarod is annoying, but he is clever.
...Brootsie.
it'll take my fingers off.
give it to me.
my name is lgor.
"ring a bell," lgor knows the secret.
igor knows the secret.
igor knows the...Igor knows the secret.
that's it?
another dead end.
you look just like her
you look just like her.
just like whom?
your mother.
lgor knows the secret about your mother.
cancel clever. Jarod is just annoying.
Broots, I want you to search the man from DSAs, anything else you can think of.
sydney, check your files. Any reference to lgor, a name, anagram or acronym, whatever.
OK, Jarod, you got my attention.
you think we're going to need stuntman for the shoe gag?
not if we caught the socks with ...
we can put rubbers mat on the shoes.
that toys came pretty sample? - It's a model kit.
didn't build models when you were a kid?
I built the Empire State Building once.
and I carved the design of what later became the AMC Pacer out of a bar of soap.
it wasn't my best work.
how long have you been on the program?
your ...chip.
I've been sober five years and unchanged.
that's great.
Dave Dugger sponsored me on the program.
he was the stuntman that was burned.
Dave is the reason I'm sober today.
and you know, he is the reason I'm alive.
sounds like a good friend to have.
so what I think it is?
she was built before the fire.
that's what happened when you go to have in the potassium chlorate.
is that what Brynne's investigation concluded?
they know Mickey Clausen screwed up. Case closed.
I just find it hard to understand how he can screw up so badly.
I mean every effects coordinator knows how reactive PC is.
at show base, you want to keep good rep, you get to produce the flash and FX.
so you think Mickey put his best friend in harms way to, enhance his reputation?
as much as I hate to say.
that's exactly I will say.
halitosis.
excuse me?
the creature from death breath.
now that is destined to become a classical among special effects ...
do I know you?
I am Jarod Lugosi.
I was wondering if I might pick your brain for a minute.
Yeah, this is the first.
guy who replaces me on the job comes to ask me for some point.
I always learn from the best.
those are your folks?
those are Dave Dugger's parents.
you and Dave are really close, ah?
Yeah, like brothers. His folks practically raised me.
but my days in Dugger's family are over.
because of the accident?
I must have miscalculated the amount of the oxidizer.
what's that you think happened?
well, cars don't blow up by themselves.
were you able to detect anything when you watch the dailies?
I cannot watch them.
here.
I want you to take them.
I can't see on tape what I see in my nightmares.
I just wish it were me in that car.
have you seen Dave or his parents since the accident?
I can't face him. I can't face his folks. Not after this.
if you don't go to the hospital, they will never know how you feel.
don't lose the people that you love.
guy, may you have a good ride. Let's go!
how this happened?
get him out of it.
help me, help me!
Oh, no!
how this happen? Get him out...
there wasn't one explosion.
there were two.
you look just like her. lgor knows the secret. My name is Igor. My name...my name is Igor.
what's wrong with the Igor, Broots? - I don't know. I don't know what it is.
forget lgor. What do you mean you didn't find anything?
I searched the main frame, checked all the DSA logs.
just no acronyms, no anagrams, nothing on Igor.
and I went through my files but I find anything pertaining to anyone but that name.
igor knows the secret. Figure it out. I've got to get feeling.
shut that thing up or I swear to God I'll shoot it.
it's out of function. That is automatic.
don't, Miss Parker.
... got to get feeling. Got feeling.
wait, wait, what are you doing?
how to get feeling?
Hi.
I am so sorry. I never meant...
now the gag would look something like this.
that's it's. I've seen bigger rubber burns.
those sneakers were supposed to step in rock of fuel.
maybe we should use some our rubber...Just make it big.
but not too big. We got millions of dollars invested in Joey and Sean.
you should ... on some ... stunt.
that's supposed to be cold supplement and petrol.
okay, first of all, lan, it's not called petrol. Maybe in your country they are called petrol. But over here in America, we call it gas!
and second of all, have you been snipping son ... - Okay, people.
he is right. The gasoline is way too volatile.
safety doesn't sell beer. Flash does.
I got a day and half left on the shoot. Jarod, work with me here.
I have an idea, Jarod.
napalm.
napalm?
where did you get it?
I made it.
you make your own napalm?
Mickey told me how.
with right balance, you can create massive explosion under control burn.
it's perfect for the shoe gag.
you might have a future in this business.
the tape from inside lgor is a security record of sub level twenty-seven.
so that's what it looked like before it burned.
april 12, 1970. The day before your mother died.
mom!
can you recognize him?
too damn dark.
did you find out where they're keeping Timmy?
he's in room 155.
I've got to get Jarod and Timmy out of here tonight.
I have got a feeling something's going to happen.
can't escape...special camera records us now.
I can't have to warn people finding out about these.
I'll take care of it.
the children' s lives depend on us.
who the hell is Timmy?
somebody Mr. lgor was trying to help my mother rescue.
one was Jarod.
Syd, do you remember Timmy?
I want more co-operation next time.
who is that?
when can I go home, Dr. Raines?
in good time, Timmy.
he's crying, Sydney.
he's scared.
I want to talk to him. - No, Jarod.
come on.
it was one of Raines's project.
and if this was going on on in SL twenty-seven...Timmy must have been...one of Raines's experiments.
run in Fenigor. I need to know who he is.
and Sydney, you go through your files again into searching for anything on Timmy.
we're going to find room 155.
what? You mean SL twenty-seven?
again?
my mother wasn't afraid to go down there. Are you?
Oh, Yeah!
that's Raines' secrets in sub level.
if he finds out we have been down there, He'll have us killed.
then make sure he doesn't find out.
with the smoke, it's fire.
you shut up?
I've been sober 5 years and unchanged.
there is actually nothing on Fenigor.
and the only sound of Timmy's stay in the Center is a simple discharge ...signed by then Dr. Raines, dated April 14,1970.
the day after my mother was killed. How coincidental!
Hey, look!
"Lindbergh Baby Kidnapped" - JES
how long has the Center been doing this stuff down here?
are you going to browse or you are going to help us find ...?
sydney, what else do Timmy's records reveal? - Very little.
no last name, no forwarding addresses. Common for a routine discharge.
well, if it was so common then why was my mother so intending to rescue him?
like the creature said: "lgor knows the secret."
the secret as to what got my mother killed maybe even who murdered her.
easy, Parker.
one stopped at the time.
the information you are talking about could get us all killed.
miss Parker.
what the hell...?
what is that?
it's a neuro - electric chair.
for a kid? I think I'm going to hurl!
I remember rumours about clandestine experiments involving brain-waves manipulation.
no wonder my mother was trying to save Timmy, save all the children. This is unbelievable.
Hey, guys
let's get out of here.
this place was trashed in a fire, we'll never know for sure what's happened to Timmy.
maybe, maybe not.
what are you thinking, Einstein?
let's bring in Angelo.
maybe he can empath what happened down here.
what are you doing?
you cannot sell off your business.
this is your life's work.
tell that to Dave Dugger and his parents.
Mickey, they are just trying to ... what happened.
Hollywood just ... what happened.
there is no stuntman in this town would work with me again.
I cannot believe that.
everybody in town knows how wonderful you are at your job.
you are only as good as your last project.
it is over, Jarod.
alright, I'll buy it all. - Excuse me.
I'll buy everything.
the lipstick camera you used to trail the Cyclops
the bust that you created all these wonderful grotesque figures.
this one is not for sale, alright?
this is Dave Dugger.
we made this bust when our first gig together here.
this is the face I'll always remember.
I do not know what I'm going to do, Jarod.
I just...
what am I going to do?
what's the matter with him? I've never seen him ...!
he is on empath perhaps he is confronting some negative associations as what he has for SL twenty-seven.
it could have meant both.
maybe this was not a good idea.
well if he can tell us something, it is a good idea.
get him in here.
come on, let's go, Angelo!
angelo, Angelo, tell me what happened here?
Angelo is frightened. - What happened here, Angelo? Tell me about...
miss Parker, please. - Tell me about Timmy.
no more Timmy.
Angelo. Angelo. - No more Timmy.
come back, Angelo.
no more Timmy.
Yeah. - Ray, It is Jarod.
you're working late.
I have got some good news.
I just came to the hospital, Dave Dugger regains consciousness and he's asking for you.
ray, are you there?
Yeah.
it's ... that's great news, Jarod.
I'm on my way.
is he ok? - Angelo.
can you hear me?
angelo, can you speak?
I am sorry, Angelo.
please, talk to me.
what you know may help me discover who killed my mother.
look, I know how much this information means to you.
but down here will you hit a dead end.
dead end is not our option, Sydney.
somewhere in this hell hole are the answers about Timmy and Igor, and the truth about what happened to my mother.
and it's time to take a look in the Raines's private deal and safe files.
Hey, Dave.
are you awake?
of course.
hard to talk.
how are you doing?
I am sorry.
don't get on soft on me, Ray.
now that have drawn Mickey left me...I need my real friends to be strong.
you are the only real friend that I have left.
what's up, buddy?
your hands are shaking.
I started to drink again, Dave.
Why?
it is the guilt.
about what?
the ... I did to you.
I don't understand.
Mickey didn't do this to you.
he was looking out for you.
but Brynne, she would take no for answer.
one day she talked to me about the explosions and I told her about my napalm and gave her a little demonstration.
when the explosion happened, I know she's stolen some and put it on the radiator.
I confronted her about it, and she threatened to off me if I talked.
with my background, nobody's going to believe me?
my career, my family my life would have been over sewed.
I sold you and Mickey out to save myself.
I am sorry, Dave. I am so sorry.
it's ok, Ray.
the first step towards forgiveness, is telling the truth.
Hello, Brynne?
it is Jarod.
I made an explosive break-through, and I would like you the first see it.
would you come to the set, before two o'clock tomorrow?
wonderful.
you should know I make it apart to never get intimate with any of the man I work with.
like it's for us. The job ends today.
but we still work here.
I get to tell you I put so much napalm on that billboard.
when this Cadillac hits it, it's going to explode like Baghdad during the Gulf War.
watch.
Hey, Brynne, why don't we take Cadillac for a little spin before we turn...?
okay.
thank you sir.
do you have something special in mind?
actually I thought of driving you into that billboard.
what? - Don't worry.
I've set it up to be very bit safe as you set up for Dave Dugger.
I even spill Ray's homemade napalm all over the radiator. Just like you did to Dave.
I am out of here.
Oh, there is no point of struggling.
you know how strong glue is.
you created the commercial for it.
are you insane?
people thought I was when I set myself on fire.
but I did remember to put on the suit and cover myself with helmet.
so I should be just fine.
I am sure Dave Dugger would take the same precautions.
but how was he supposed to know that you re-did another explosion for inside of his car?
I don't know what you're talking about.
well, maybe a little 3rd degree burn will help your memory.
Oh, come on, Brynne.
Jarod, please!
why would you put napalm on the radiator?
the bigger the explosion the better the commercial?
you tell me something.
what demographic says that the beer sales are more important than that man's life.
the commercial had been lost in account.
what about what Mickey Clausen lost?
what about Dave Dugger?
they lost everything. The only thing you could have lost was just a job.
just a job?
I work my...to get what I am.
it is a boys' club.
through glass ceilings I am not about to lose it all because a funky special effects guy was too soft to do the job we paid him for.
you know something, Brynne?
I don't think your agency is going to be giving your officer after all this.
look on the bright side, maybe you have a career ahead of you.
in stunt work.
no, Jarod.
did the camera record all that, Mickey? - We got we want.
that's rep.
I found Timmy.
in Raines archives.
run them.
Mrs Parker, what are you doing here?
I came by to visit Timmy.
I don't think that's a good idea.
well, Dr Raines, my husband thinks it's important my visit with hold the children.
wait here.
Hi.
Timmy, my name is Catherine. How are you doing?
I miss my mum and dad.
I know you do, honey.
come on, Timmy!
that's it?
well, there is another one dated on the following day.
no, no. Timmy.
you...to come in here!
my god.
what have you done to that little boy?
it was an experiment!
my husband was ... for this!
you don't know your husband as well as you think you do.
I advise you remain quiet about this.
you know what's best for you.
Raines, what you can do with Timmy now?
there is no Timmy any more.
from now on, he is being called...
is Timmy Angelo?
what, what Raines do to him?
somehow his emotions, his ability to relate to the physical world, were driven invert.
and gave Angelo his unique gift.
but took away his life.
were you involved in this?
if I had known about this, I would have done everything in my power to stop it.
and then you were dead.
just like my mother.
so you actually sold your effects stuff?
Yeah, I know, I know. I don't suppose you will be willing to sell it back.
for the right price.
then charge him double.
it's ... think he did this to me.
thanks a lot, Jarod.
Hi, Mickey.
Timmy is gone.
white choose the variation, to answer the blacks, in defence.
very good, Jarod.
who are you, Mr. lgor?
sydney, when do I get to meet that boy?
he is gone.
what do you mean "gone"?
I received a copy of paperwork today.
Dr. Raines released him.
did he do something wrong?
he wasn't special.
you were special, Timmy.
what?
how are you coming with my feeling?
you need to ask?
why the game, with the creature, why not just tell me?
sometimes the destination isn't as important as the journey.
well, where on your journey, did you find that... ?
in one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.
like her wedding ring and medical file.
Oh, you will be surprised what one could find in there.
you know the dance, Miss Parker.
you help me with one of my secrets,
I help you with one of yours.
we weren't able to find anything about lgor or Fenigor.
I don't know if he was my mother's...or betrayer.
keep searching.
lgor, he holds the secrets to both our pasts.
what makes you so sure?
call it, you got feeling.
==YTET PRESENTS==
getting out a little early today, Sydney.
my God, Jarod. They are going to see you.
something bad is happening, Sydney.
there is not much time left.
Jarod, let's get out of here.
I need answers.
answers? - Who I am? Where I came from? Who my parents are?
just give me something. Even if it's just a name.
but I need to know now.
so do I.
me too.
I don't understand.
he deserves answers, Sydney.
I don't understand, Jacob.
it is complicated.
please, Sydney.
I don't have much time.
good morning, Broots.
sorry to interrupt.
let me guess, Jarod? - Yeah.
just arrived this morning. He bought it from some place called the of Astro Arcade of lndianapolis.
he was working in a pin-ball parlor?
no, actually he was just hanging out.
the owner said he played this exact game for almost twenty-four hours straight on one single coin.
impressive!
Oh yeah!
and what Sydney is taking on, game boy?
Oh, Sydney.
he left this email.
"our suffocated friend is awake."
he is awake.
jacob is a threat to Center interest.
make sure Jacob never wakes up again.
I'll be away fishing.
find out where Sydney is.
thirty-one point four eight. This one is fast.
it's still more a few seconds of the track records.
it's five years you spent to attain this speed, R.J.
this guy isn't even on back just backed you.
what he says his last name was?
he drives like Parnelli. That's for...Let's go.
as the MCl car is coming in to the lane, tests are now open for the next hour.
that was incredible!
thank you!
you are a some driver!
excuse me.
wonder how the secrets.
you know I could get faster. My foot slipped off the gas pedal going turn four.
where did you learn to drive a race car?
lndianapolis.
Really? The brickyard?
the Astro Arcade.
there are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
how many people died because of what I thought up?
since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
he is a pretender.
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
the Center wants him alive. - Preferably.
he defends the weak and abused.
life is a gift.
you are a doctor?
I am today.
Jarod, this is Nigel Brinkman, our number one driver.
welcome to the big show, Jarod. - Nice to be here.
Jarod is going to be taking over the number three car for Jimmy.
he had an accident in Milwaukee, didn't he?
my son broke his leg.
doctor said it will be at least a year until he drives again.
but he will, you know why, he is a Roemer.
Jimmy got a little himself.
he took R. J.'s car and just cut the tyre and pulled it into a wall.
well I can understand why R.J. would be a little defensive.
my son's going to handle it.
that's racing.
come on, we take you to settle in.
I accept nothing but the best for my drivers, Jarod.
I can see that.
this one is an oldy.
guess you can see that knife was R.J.'s first trophy.
he gained this in the India Lights Championship.
there is winning the national ...
there is finished in second at Long Beach. I am not sure why that I haven't seen it up there.
I would have won that race if the car's been set up right.
Really?
I don't remember our chief mechanic driving the car that day.
Hawkes is a dinosaur.
R.J. the visiting hours of the hospital are over...
Oh, sorry. I don't realize that any... - It is okay, darling, come in.
I think I get to go check the telemetry readings on the practise.
you are not going to see Jimmy?
well, I'll try, okay?
Anna, this is Jarod Jones. He is taking over Jimmy's ride.
and this is my daughter-in-law.
Hi.
pleasure.
she will give you a race paperwork started then we turn a test at one.
well, this is uncomfortable.
it's racing.
I heard about your husband's accident.
I hope he'll be alright.
Thanks.
doctor says it's too soon to tell if it left damages on permanent.
you need to fill in a background information form.
background information?
so the media and sponsors know who you are.
I am not really interested in the publicity.
in this business you will answer more questions and eat more cocktail wines than you've thought possible.
I am sure that everything is going to work out.
it looks like your family is very close.
sounds that way, don't they?
Jimmy Roemer Wipes Out Brother's Car in Practice
Jimmy Roemer's Career in Doubt
anything yet?
well, I've gone over Sydney's messages dozen times. And the best I can come up with is gone to white cloud.
where?
sydney has a cabin up in the mounts in white cloud lake.
he goes there to fish sometimes.
sydney and trout.
boggles the mind.
do you know where it is?
Oh, yeah.
write down the directions.
I still don't get the part about "our suffocated friend is awake."
the directions, Broots.
the last word is "white cloud."
you don't have to draw me a map.
so you both drive for the same team, but you race against each other?
not exactly. R.J. here is what you might call my supporting.
I don't understand.
let's why we get ringroad here. It's little confused which my confrere smells my exhaust fume at most of the race.
I'm sorry.
it got away from me.
you didn't sign me this morning.
I was in your pit earlier.
Oh, yes. Are you a driver too?
Yeah.
now, when you talked about the life and death aspect of racing you come right to the heart of the drivers' very existence.
really!
did you want something?
Yes, I don't have a big car yet and I was wondering if you give me a lift.
I need to visit someone.
Yeah, alright.
it is the hospital Jimmy's in.
I thought I should meet the man I was serving for.
you wanna join me?
it must be difficult.
working so hard, never get a supporting you need to win.
I will win. I have to.
what was Jimmy doing in your car the day of crash?
he saw the pathetic data on the three car.
Jimmy wanted to know what's like to drive a competitor ride.
I feel sorry for him. And give him a shot. And the story.
according to the data after the crash, Jimmy had a throttle wide open when he hit the wall.
I love my brother, but, he didn't know his limits.
your brother has a very rare disease.
in Jacob's case he's stimulated the brain and seems like awaked areas injured years earlier.
is he aware of the surroundings?
on and off. His motor skills are very elementary and his speech appears to be limited to single word out of he says.
I would like to see him now.
well, before you do it, something else you should know about your brother's condition.
can you hear me?
this is Sydney.
may we...
care...
she's on phone...
he seems to be drifting from one thought to another.
I am not sure who this Greta woman is.
Greta was our mother's name.
listen to this carefully. Do you know what year it is?
1942
I'd like to take him with me.
Mr. Raines. We've gone playing the Sydney's telephone tape.
you're right. His brother is still alive.
but you will take care of that, won't you?
my pleasure.
sun too hot?
Nah, I am fine.
doctors say you can start Rehabilitation in another month.
I'd start today if it were on my way.
that's my little brother, getting no good when he's sitting on it.
where have you been, stranger?
I have better things to do than hanging out the bunch of gimps.
Yeah. What's your name?
guilty.
I thought you won't coming.
got to have faith in your family.
can you get my baseball cap in my room? I am getting a little toasted out here.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, here.
don't eat too many candy bars. You would be driving last car in next year.
Hi, Jimmy Roemer.
Jarod is driving number three car.
good for you.
win one for the whole team.
I'm just keeping your place warm until you get back.
how are you feeling?
like a runner with a flat tyre.
just take and slow.
it'll all come back to you.
I feel pretty stupid parking ride to the wall.
I mean, I know I blacked out, but I swear I was braking.
the engine just kept after I made contact.
Hey, accidents happen.
you remember my prom night?
dad was peeled out!
I rocked my car around a telephone pole.
of course he didn't cost a hundred grand to have it fixed.
fill me up, will you?
are you okay?
Yeah.
hard to believer I drive a race car, huh?
like you say, accidents happen.
I am taking you out of here, Jacob.
to the cabin of the white cloud.
you used to love going to white cloud, remember?
go that way. I will take the stairs.
okay, drop the mop.
he can't understand you.
Hey, Jarod. - Hey, Mario
nice run. I was watching you.
just a little tip. Going for turn one, just keep it down a bit, be lower. Stay below the bumps.
I think you gonna like it.
I love that tips. - Take care.
seventeen races, six months without podium finish! This, gentleman is unacceptable.
and that is why we are now going to be into race as eighteen.
Meaning?
meaning you gonna do whatever it takes to get the number one car out front and keep it there.
what about me?
me, me, me, there is no me.
it's a team sport now.
I want you and Jarod to let Nigel drive behind your cars, block out the leaders so he can gain track position, okay?
excuse me.
blocking is offence.
it's called racing. - Yeah, so basically Jarod and I are just traffic cops.
you have any idea how much money it takes to support three cars?
fine, dad, I just meant...Sponsors want to see their product in victory lane. otherwise they find another team.
and you go back to junk with monster trucks.
which means driving smart, not like that lose kind of brother of yours.
son of bitch.
Hey, hey, R.J.
cool down.
come on, Hawkes is right.
Jimmy had that business be in number two car, you know it.
Yeah, and check the race in last time, I should be top right.
Yeah, right.
come on, Hawkes, I'll show you some in the front of ...
someone should shot that son of bitch for good.
you see, that's the kind of Roemer spirit that I am looking for.
I just want to some of them on the track.
some much for the home team.
Oh, god. You scared the hell out of me.
you are expecting to find two corpses, Miss Parker?
what did Raines promise you?
what are you talking about?
the sweeper team that showed up at the hospital.
you called Raines up, didn't you?
admit it!
let go of me, Sydney.
you are the only one who knows my brother is still alive.
Raines thinks I murdered Jacob.
if he knew he was still alive, I would be in more danger than anyone.
I suggest you just check your home phone for bugs.
and let go of me.
has he said anything?
I need to reach him, Parker.
I need answers.
answers?
about what I've done.
you did brake, Jimmy. But your engine kept running.
Jimmy used to walk the stands for every race.
he said that felt like being in church.
thanks for getting R.J. to go to see Jimmy.
...his brother.
I thought I might help.
Yeah.
how is he doing?
he feels like he failed.
failed?
me, R.J. mostly his dad.
grant is pretty intense.
Yeah, he always encouraged them to compete against each other.
no wonder when Jimmy was seven, Grant took him and R.J. out to a cabin, made them each chop a quarter wood, told them the winner get a brand new Odekirk fishing knife and fishing attachments.
I saw the photograph in the trailer.
right, now there is no way a couple of kids can cut out that wood.
and Grant knew that.
but he left them out there alone in the cold.
what happened?
there is a lumber yard nearby.
so R.J. sits a tractor, rides up the hill, buys himself a fresh cut wood, and wins the knife.
sounds like the real prides was winning his father's approval.
and he would do anything to get it.
something's never changed.
you remember my mother?
you look just like her.
Yes.
but you remember her.
please Jacob, try to remember.
why can't you remember?
because he is dying.
the same virus that will awaken Jacob is also killing him.
he has less than twelve hours left.
I am sorry, Sydney.
what can we do?
Broots is bringing some my personal items. Photos or movies.
if only I can help Jacob remember, maybe he can tell us something about your mother. Or about Jarod.
or maybe he can simply die, knowing who he is.
it's okay.
now there Andretti is racing.
but stay low, avoid the bumps. You will be glad you did.
something about that voice sounds kind of familiar.
but thanks.
what's that? - I came across it a throttle cable from Jimmy's crashed engine.
well, you are a car inspector now? - I just want to know how things work.
I couldn't figure out what these scratches were.
Jimmy bent the cable plate.
and what happens when the cable plates bent?
you bent the cable plate, your throotle stick.
is that what happened to Jimmy?
look, I did a car inspection after the accident.
Jimmy's crash had nothing to do with a mechanic error.
well, then how do you explain these marks?
damage in the crash.
come on, I am not a mechanic. But these marks are looked they were made by set of pliers.
you are right. You are not a mechanic.
Oh, well, this place is really nice.
Hey.
here.
Hey, do you think maybe I can rent here for some weekend I can bring my daughter here?
that's it? - Yes, it's over.
you can leave now.
okay.
can, can I at least go to the bathroom first? Is it through here?
Broots, wait.
what's going on?
my Brother Jacob is quite ill.
got it?
Yeah.
go back to the Center, if you notice anything unusual, you call me. We need protection for at least for another ten hours.
understood?
Yeah, as good as it never gone out.
why would you want to kill your own brother, R.J?
Yeah, I just come back.
no, it's quiet. Everything seems to be really cool.
of course, I won't say anything.
miss Parker. Could you do me a favor?
could you wish Sydney good luck...
miss Parker?
Hello?
God, I hate her when she does that.
Mr. Raines.
damn it!
I am sorry about that, man.
Hey!
so didn't that eat you up, R.J?
now I have to make some major buddy work.
you wouldn't happen to have a small screwdriver or a set of pliers, would you?
someone broke the lock of garage and stole all the pliers last night.
Really? Can't trust anybody these days.
Hey, Jones, try this.
Odekirk.
it's very difficult to come by.
where did you get this?
I won it about a year ago.
from whom?
from me.
data hate the soon losers, right?
did R. J. threaten to take your number one car, Brinkman?
remember those tennis matches in Yale?
I still think you let me win so that I wouldn't feel so bad.
listen to me.
there are things you know, Jacob.
things that can help others.
remember Jarod?
you signed him into the Center, the night he was brought there.
Parker and I found files at SL twenty-seven.
your signature was on Jarod's entrance report.
think back. Where did he come from?
what was his real name?
his parents name?
that is the least I can do for him.
since your car accident, I've done things, Jacob, unspeakable things, to protect Jarod, to protect you.
I even tried to kill Dr. Raines.
but the bullet hit his oxygen tank and...
it's pretty, huh?
I rebuilt Jimmy's engine from the crash.
all by myself.
I did however have to replace this damaged throttle cable.
maybe I should be a car inspector.
what do you want?
do you remember these markings?
it turns out they were indeed made by a pair of pliers.
pliers from another Odekirk knife.
this Odekirk knife. Used to belong to R.J. but R.J. lost it in a bet to Nigel Brinkman.
what's this got to do with me?
I am glad you asked.
this is a videotape, from the surveillance cameras in the garages of Milwaukee.
it's dated the day before Jimmy's crash.
it shows you letting Nigel Brinkman into the number two car garage.
Brinkman was worring that R.J. was going to take over the number one car.
how was he supposed to know that Jimmy was going to be behind that wheel that day?
why would I want to hurt R.J?
because you wanted Nigel to replace this cruel boss.
I found resumes. Resumes of people applying for your job.
Oh, god.
I am fifty-six years old.
I can't start over again.
I never want to hurt Jimmy.
what the hell was that kid doing in that car anyway?
he was covering for me.
your hand.
Yeah.
I started having spasms about six months ago.
day of the race, I was so bad. I could barely hold the wheel.
that I asked Jimmy to cover for me.
I've seen cases like yours.
it's treatable.
Yeah, I will take care of it later.
it's time to think Jimmy.
I messed up, Jarod.
I let down my father and almost killed my little brother.
you didn't know that Brinkman messed with the engine.
I know now.
I am going to do everything I can to make it right.
we all will.
no, don't lie to me.
I tell you, I don't know anybody named Jacob.
six hours, Mr. Broots.
is all this discomfort worth for protecting someone like Sydney?
I don't know what you are talking about.
well then, maybe I can help drag your memory.
look, okay, I think I start to remember.
Hello, Anna. It is Jarod.
Jimmy would be able to come to the track tomorrow?
"Cart Headquarters"
Nigel, it's Jarod.
Hawkes thinks he made a break through on your set up.
can you do a little testing in the morning?
great. I'll see you then.
I tell you, I don't have enough courage in the bets.
Yeah.
excuse me, sir. - Yeah.
could you direct me the public address bead? - There is a rack in the back.
that's what the problem is.
you only got five cameras out there, and I need twice that many.
why don't you walk on the camera truck?
television! I'd be out of my mind.
can we at least get it on camera positions?
only one and a half seconds seperating the two cars in the front roads...
Nigel! Glad you made it here.
Hey, if you boys think you can get some more speed out this car, I am ready to go.
where is Grant?
considering what's on at last meeting, Hawkes thought it would be wise if we kept this between us until we save the fence up.
okay, let's go to run.
here you go.
alright, Nigel, have a good run!
ready?
go!
how did you feel?
so far so good.
I'm going to warm up then you'll see what you can do.
what the hell Brinkman is doing out there?
you should watch this.
and then we have to talk.
I'm going to roam up the next turn round.
how does it feel, Nigel?
Oh, man, there isn't any better than this.
come on, Nigel, you can go faster than that.
Jarod, what are you doing out there?
I am just trying to find out what really happened to Jimmy's car before the crash.
I don't know what you are talking about.
lies.
this is what I am talking about.
I don't know anything about Jimmy's accidental crash.
I am pulling in.
not so fast, Nigel.
game up. I have control on your car.
you are out of your mind.
think so?
what the hell I can't?
now you know how it feels.
careful, I really hate to see you crash.
what the hell is going on?
I want to know why you sabotage R.J's car.
why you nearly killed Jimmy Roemer?
you are not making sense, Jarod. Now stop this car!
stop it, Jarod.
give you a information that I had your filled tank on top.
so you should be good for at least seventy laps.
bad news is I put on four old tyres.
my guess is one of them will blow any time now.
you know what that means.
I can't hold this any more.
that's the idea.
Oh, right.
I broke R.J's car, but I didn't know that Jimmy's going to behind that wheel, I swear.
I cann't lose.
now you know how Jimmy felt.
I'm getting to the wall. Jarod, Jarod.
you said it yourself, Nigel.
that's racing.
Nigel Brinkman? Come with us, please.
please, Sydney.
I don't have much time.
I am here, Jacob.
I want you to know that no matter what you did, what we did, I never blame you.
I think that together we rob Jarod of his life.
and for that we will be judged.
but I'm not allowed to be angry, and to forgive.
and I only hope that, one day, Jarod can feel the same.
gene who?
here, try to write it down.
is it Jarod's real name? Or his father's?
who is Gene?
please Jacob, I need to know.
I am sorry, Sydney.
jacob love this song and this place.
he came to finally find his rest here.
where is he?
do you have any sevens? - Got fish.
check the bedroom.
give you five?
you got to be cheating.
no one.
I know Jacob was here.
you are mistaken.
my brother is dead.
it's dangerous to deceive the Center.
I wouldn't push him.
a man with a temper to match his marksmanship.
dangerous combo.
it's a beautiful place.
how did you know?
I called Broots.
he told me about Jacob.
he said you will be away from the Center for a few days, so I took a chance.
hard to be alone on the world, do we?
I hope Jacob's passing was easy.
I believe it was.
before he died, my brother gave me this.
what does it mean?
maybe your name, maybe your parents.
I wish I could be sure.
anyway, I hope it'll help you find your own peace on the world.
a Brother Missed
"Indy Show"
==YTET PRESENTS==
wait a minute, I didn't do anything.
wait! I didn't do anything.
what, what the hell is that? - Move it!
no.
I want to call my father!
do you hear me?
nice PJs!
they pulled me right out of bed.
I was in the shower.
Hmm! Thanks for painting that one for me.
what the hell is going on here?
trouble.
the worse kind.
I thought you were leaving town.
well, I came to say goodbye, Sharpton.
and I knew you'd be here.
like you are every night.
collecting your payoff.
same bat time, same bat channel.
I heard that on a re-run.
I don't know what you are talking about.
every night you head out alone, you make your run, collecting your drug money.
then one night you hit a little girl.
you couldn't stop because of all the contrabands you had on board, so you let her to bleed to death.
tell me, what you are going to do about it?
I'm going to make sure that this is your last run.
you got it all down pat , don't you?
well, you're right.
I do deliver drugs and I do love my money.
and I do head out alone.
but you left out a little something.
what's that?
the part where I stop and pick up my partner.
come on, we're going to be late.
he'll freeze to death out here.
Yeah. It's a rough world, ain't it?
there are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
thirty-six Hours, he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others.
how many people died because of what I thought up?
since I broke up, I spent every moment searching for my past.
he is a pretender.
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
the Center wants him alive. - Preferably.
he defends the weak and the abused.
life is a gift.
YTET PRESENTS
you are a doctor?
I am, today.
Hey, wait!

I'm, I'm sorry.
all your money's gone.
that's bad but your stuff is safe.
I saved your stuff.
that's good.
where am I?
where are you?
you my friend are in my little corner of paradise.
at least for now.
Hey, hey, ah, my name's Argyle by the way.
my name's Argyle.
and I'm called this on account of this birthmark that I got on the back of my thigh.
you want to see it?
you want to check it out?
no? Okay! That's cool.
most people don't.
no offence taken.
you got a lot of stuff in here, dude.
Hey, I hope my patch job keeps in the blood, okay, because look, the dog never complained about the doctoring.
but, hey, I think you'd be the better judge you being the real M. D. and all.
doctor? - Yeah.
you're a doctor, my friend.
this ID here says that your name is Jarod and you, my friend, are a thoracic surgeon.
give me a 3 cc syringe and a size A ET tube.
she's going into respiratory arrest.
prepare to ventilate.
give me the syringe. Remove the plunger.
air entry on both sides of the chest.
she's pinking out.
now that's a nice sound.
come on. Come on. Yes! Yeah， baby.
now that's a nice sound.
we're gonna have us some heat now.
Oh. Oh.
nothing ever works in this place.
including you.
Never!
that's all going to change.
that's all going to change. Real soon!
I'm thinking four years of college.
I'm thinking Medical School.
I'm thinking doctoring prescriptions.
you know, I've been riding a wooden pony for years now.
and I'm thinking, you might just be my brass ring.
brass Ring?
pot of gold, boy, ship that's come in.
the way out， man.
I'm thinking the hospital'll pay a healthy finders fee for one of it prize physicians.
not a doctor.
you're not a doctor?
come on. Who ，the hell, are you then?
I don't know.
what is this?
it's a T-board.
a what? What?
t standing for torture.
the Centre Tribunal.
they want answers and until they get them we're not going anywhere.
well, no. You're kidding ， right?
don't soil yourself, Broots.
they want us unbalanced.
that's why they yanked us in the dead of night.
they're trying to fracture us emotionally.
well, it's working. I'm shattering.
how do you know so much about this?
I've been on the other side of the glass.
so how does it turn out?
fine.
if you're on the other side of the glass.
Oh， great!
I knew Raines would be involved.
the question is who's behind it all.
the Triumvirate, cruskin.
under whose authority?
that bitch is like a bad cough.
who are those guys in the shadows?
I don't know.
I need to get word to my father.
here.
I'm not sure that he will be able to help.
hello lovey!
the last time I saw you, you were trying to blow my father's helicopter out of the sky.
how did you get back in the Centre?
well, before we get to that,
I promised some friends of mine I'd find out why after eighteen months, Jarod is still out there.
not possible.
they created him.
they know what he's capable of.
Yes, they do.
they think, the only way that he could still be eluding the Center is that one, or all of you, are working with him.
they think that?
or you made them think that?
either way, no one's leaving until we find out who.
we start with you, Tex.
whoever you are, you've got a tooth sweeter than mine, that's for sure.
sugar's a killer, you know that?
it will rot all the teeth out, right out of your head.
I'm lucky. I'm blessed. I've really good teeth.
they're all mine.
Hey, buddy?
what's wrong?
Oh， no.
you don't know who you are，and you're burning up.
that's what happens when you're left out in the elements.
that's what happens.
your problem was you weren't looking over your shoulder.
you always gotta look over your shoulder, man.
there's always somebody back there in the dark,
some mook, some punk back there gunning for you, I know.
you gotta look over your shoulder, man.
look over your shoulder.
or maybe you're running away from this cutie pie.
who's this?
Hey！
who's this pretty lady?
what did she do?
bust your rocks for not bringing home the green.
Hey, you didn't bring home the green.
maybe she's another doctor.
you know, you'd better think twice about that next time.
well, I'll be John Brown.
I will be John Browned.
you're not a doctor.
you're a park ranger.
no, you're a fireman.
no, you're a roach exterminator.
no, you're a federal investigator.
I'm, I'm sorry, mister.
could you help me out here for a second?
I'm kind of at a loss here.
who the hell are you?
mister?
mister?
I don't know who I am.
I didn't do anything.
Broots scared.
how do you think he will hold up?
before or after he wets his pants?
can I, Can I have a robe?
is Jarod smarter than you?
huh? - You've been chasing him for over a year.
has he alluded you because he is smarter?
no.
we try hard every day to find Jarod but the wheel of fortune just hasn't landed on our number yet.
spinning, spinning, spinning.
well, he is a Pretender.
he's a one-man Siegfried and Roy.
show me what you have.
Jarod interconnected 173 international calls.
but backtracking those calls was impossible because instead of a call forwarding device triggered by a single call all one hundred and seventy-three calls was individually initiated.
ingenious. - And very expensive.
I don't care what it cost.
Oh, that's good because Jarod charged them all to your calling card.
he's, he's clever and smart.
which makes tracking Jarod more fun.
fun?
No! I...
are you saying he's your hero?
no. I'm... No, I'm not saying that.
then what are you saying?
just... I'm just saying that Jarod's clever.
you can see it in his eyes.
you can tell.
according to your file， you've never laid eyes on Jarod.
you never have, have you?
no.
I, ah, I'm referring to pictures.
Hello, Mr Broots.
Oh, my God!
help me, please.
eighteen months, no results.
we find it hard to believe that someone could be this inept on purpose.
help me...
mr Broots!
if you're not helping Jarod， then who is?
can I have a robe please?
you're like you and me.
bunch of names. Travel light. Man on the run.
who are you running from anyway?
John Law.
the man with a smile on his face and the evil in his heart? Huh?
who you running from?
Hey.
maybe you got a bounty on your head?
your head's burning up.
you're burning up, man.
Oh， no. This is not good.
you've been out in the elements too long， man.
out in the elements too long.
I knew it. This is not good.
I knew it. This is bad.
I love you, Jarod.
don't leave me.
please don't leave me.
come on!
Hey! Hey! Are you okay, man?
are you okay?
No! No! No, don't you die on me, man.
don't you die on me! Don't you leave me!
you're my brass ring man!
come on! Don't you die on me, man!
don't you die on me, man!
I know the escape procedure.
the fire! It's too hot!
it comes into the airline.
I try not to breathe but it is too late.
I can't open the hatch.
I can't open the hatch!
no one can get to us.
we can't be saved.
I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning!
Hey! Your fever broke.
doubt left you with me for a while.
so, what's the Centre?
your your little freakish home movies are all labelled " For Centre Use Only. "
what's the Centre?
I don't know.
you don't know!
I...I'll tell you what I think, Jarod.
I think that you got a big brain.
and I think that these Centre guys, I think they're after you.
and I think that means you're worth something to them, which means you're worth a lot to me.
you see I got a big brain too.
Jarod, I got a big brain too.
why won't you work?
why won't you work?
why won't you work?
I'm just trying to fix things, Jarod.
I'm just trying to make them right.
not a big deal.
no big deal.
just trying to fix things.
who are you?
the proudest woman in the world.
who am I?
just trust your feelings.
always trust your feelings.
Jarod, I told you I can't accept this.
but I made it for you.
this card is meant for someone else.
don't you love me, Sydney?
we have work to do.
is Sydney your dad or something?
I'm so glad I left Debbie at her god mother's.
I can't believe how long they've had Sydney out there.
you wear a watch to bed?
Yeah.
Why?
in case I wake up and, you know, need to document something.
let us continue.
when are they going to leave him alone?
when they hear what they want to hear.
he's been out there for six hours already.
and they'll take another six if they want to.
what are they doing this for?
because they can.
Jarod is my life's work.
my interest in him is primarily scientific.
that interest demands that I remain objective which precludes the possibility of guilt.
don't you love me, Sydney?
forgive me father for I have sinned.
I have betrayed a friend.
have you prayed to the Lord?
not even he can forgive me for what I have done.
the bond between Jarod and me is as unique as Jarod is special.
unique enough for you to be fighting for his freedom.
I would never do that.
Jarod's a very complex case.
I've tried to keep him alive and to hold his psyche in check during this pursuit.
what are you? His wet nurse?
we must be patient.
your tactics are far too aggressive.
the day you really anger Jarod is the day that he will disappear forever.
I have tried to bring him back.
that is my objective.
as a scientist, I think The Centre is as good a place as he will find to maximise his tremendous potential.
you don't know who Jarod is.
you don't know who Jarod is...
you're not a doctor. You're a park ranger.
no, you're a fireman.
no, you're a roach exterminator.
no, a federal investigator.
I'm sorry, mister. Who the hell are you...
how are you? - I can be anything I want to be.
I can be a doctor, I can be an engineer, I can be an astronaut.
but I don't know who I am.
our father gave you this.
who the hell are you?
I'm your brother.
Jarod, go and find our parents.
I want to know what I look like.
I want to know who I am.
I want to know who I am...
I'm not really a plastic surgeon.
my name is Jarod.
I'm not really a doctor.
I'm not really in the Coast Guard.
who the hell are you?
well, I sure as hell aren't Florence Nightingale.
this is who you look like.
this is who you are...
you're my son.
you're my life.
I love you, Jarod.
then one night you hit a little girl.
Hi, Jarod.
Hello?
hello. My name is Argyle.
um? Is this the Centre?
maybe. Why?
I don't know.
maybe I've got something you want.
uh huh!
well, I'm all ears.
dog here, he's a hero.
see， I rescued him from the pond.
and he saved you.
he saved you, I saved him. It's ironic.
it's ironic. Yeah?
when did I go from patient to prisoner?
prisoner.
prisoner.
prisoner! That's cold， man.
that's cold.
what would you call it?
what would I call it? What would I call it?
I, I call it ironic.
I call it ironic. I call it ironic.
just slip into my skin for a second, would you?
just for a second, slip into my skin.
a wigged out stewardess, gets a hangnail.
kills the entire flight crew.
three hundred people drop out of the clouds. Boom!
a postman goes postal. Bang!
a Bus driver goes bustal. Crash!
and we, we all sit idly by and say "You are crazy， man. Crazy. That was so crazy. I'm glad it wasn't me."
the point is you've been sprouting crazy here a while now.
and I'm just making sure that's not me.
okay. Fair's fair.
and by the way, I'm not into hurting you either.
so you can rack easy on that bro.
Hey, I wish we had a deck of cards because I got this great trick I could show you.
is that my phone?
Yeah.
who'd you call?
Yeah! I just called the doctor.
I called your doctor to see if he made house calls.
you called Sydney?
no. No. No. He wasn't there but a lady answered.
miss Parker? - No. No. No. No. It's Bridget.
she sounded sexy. - Did you tell them where you are?
what? Do I look like a road sign?
listen to me. These people. This organisation. They will kill you. Trust me.
trust you? No, you listen to me.
trust. Trust. Great word. Right?
trust. It's on every coin, every bill, every buck, every bond in this country.
and yet it's still the one thing you still can't buy.
they are setting you up!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
Bridget said you'd have an answer for everything， and you do.
don't ruin everything.
it's good here. It's good. It's good.
three hours ago you didn't know whether you were park ranger or rodeo clown.
now you're cracking foxy about some secret organisation that wants to hurt me.
it's you they want, my friend.
it's you.
I just happen to hold the deed.
you listen to me.
I speak from experience.
you're dealing with the devil.
thank you for joining us, Miss Parker.
well, it was an invitation that I simply couldn't pass up.
lose the butt.
you don't have to worry about me blowing smoke.
put it out!
this is cruel.
even for a T-Board.
fire away, babe. I'm not going anywhere.
the Triumvirate is a bit murky concerning your motives in the pursuit of Jarod.
well. Maybe they should pull their heads out of their sand boxes.
I do my job. Period!
what we are looking for is the truth.
truth?
that is a very interesting word coming from you.
so you have no other agenda in doing your job.
no unresolved issues or conflicts with the Centre or Jarod.
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.
is that the truth?
I know the truth, Miss Parker.
and what truth is that, Jarod?
the truth about what makes you sad.
daddy, I want to know what really happened to my Mum.
I have no unresolved issues with the Centre.
you didn't answer about Jarod.
where did you find my mother's ring？
in one of your mother's safe deposit boxes.
like her medical file？
Oh, you'd be surprised what one can find in there.
you know the dance, Miss Parker.
you help me with one of my secrets, I help you with one of yours.
we weren't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor.
I don't know if he was my mother's allier or betrayer.
well, keep searching.
igor holds the secret to both our pasts.
what makes you so sure?
call it a gut feeling.
so you're saying that in your past year and a half pursuit he's not had any undue influence on you?
that's what I'm saying.
not of any kind?
no influence at all!
not even emotional?
they say it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
do you believe that's true?
you paint a pretty sad picture.
how do we end up like this?
like what?
alone.
searching.
it's ironic because we both want the same things.
someone to care about someone to care about us.
do you think we'll ever find that kind of love in our lifes?
how do we end up like this?...
miss Parker?
miss Parker?
Hi!
we're done here.
miss Parker.
you may have a cigarette now.
I just quit.
Mr. Argyle.
you know， Bridget.
if your body is half as good as your brain you and I might just find a way, you know？
coming from a man of your brilliance that's quite a compliment.
Hey, by the way you hit it right on the nail indeed about cashew boy here.
he's a nut, alright?
Yes. He's crazy.
but he's resourceful!
so have you come up with a price?
Bridget. If this is about Jarod...
Shhh. I'm on the phone.
you know, I was out scamming this softie suburbanite the other day out of his lunch money when I saw this dapper Dan in a Rolls Royce.
a Rolls Royce, Huh?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!
real, real shiny!
anyway, this guy right, he gets out of the car, and I find myself staring at his threads, right.
I'm staring at this cat's threads and I'm thinking to myself I don't know the dude from the president of England.
I don't know if he's a liar, if he kicks his dog, if he smacks his old lady, nothing.
and yet, I find myself having this instant, incredible respect for the guy on account of the suit he's wearing.
ah hah! Go On.
Yeah! His suit, his shirt, his watch, his loafers, the whole kit and caboodle.
one piece more expensive than the next.
silk on silk. Leather on leather.
and you know, I'm thinking to myself, Bridget,
I'm thinking to myself, to drape this guy it must have cost at least,I don't know, at least ten thousand dollars, Bridget.
is that the price of respect, Mr Argyle?
Hey! Hey, a man ain't squat without respect.
well, ten thousand dollars is a great deal of money but I think I can convince my people to approve it.
No!
No! Big brain.
don't do this.
Bridget? Write this down.
that's just three hours away.
I'm on the next plane.
if you've found, Jarod I am the only one who can bring him in.
Sorry， darling.
this time he comes in.
Hey! Hey! It's all for the best.
you're going back where you belong.
I'm getting out of here.
it'll all be fine.
trust me.
trust me!
this sucks!
why are they making us just sit here and wait？
so when wonder woman brings him in it will prove the point we didn't because one of us was helping him.
leaving us as good as dead, huh?
I never thought that I'd be rooting for Jarod.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that!
daddy!
angel.
Oh, I came as soon as I found out.
how dare they put my daughter through a T-Board.
are you alright? - For now.
you'll all be out of here after I lop off a few heads.
daddy, be careful.
right.
boy, I never thought I'd be glad to see your old man.
Yeah, I'm glad he's here too, Broots.
unfortunately, there's reason to believe he's been here the whole time.
I'm sorry, Parker.
he's done it again.
Mr. Argyle?
nice to see you. - Nice to see you!
get the case out of the trunk, Willie.
Yes. You've got something for me in the trunk, Willie?
I bring you respect in a bag.
Oh， wow.
ten thousand real ones.
Where's Jarod?
he's in the basement, in the boiler room. Hey!
Willie, when you see I've Jarod, put a bullet in his brain, if you can find it.
my pleasure.
what are you talking about "bullet in my brain " ?
that's not nice!
Hey, hey.
Damn!
well, if it isn't sleeping beauty.
and they said you were so hard to catch.
time to rise and shine.
wake up, my little love muffin.
come on, baby, wake Up!
wake up.
Hi. Time to go home.
sorry.
but I'm never going back there.
you're not so mean.
nice to see you again, Willie.
Hi!
your brass ring.
I knew you were the one to trust right from the start.
on second thought.
I think I'll donate it to the pond.
in dog's name.
like you said, he's the hero.
give me back my pez.
Nope! Sorry! It's just Jarod.
but you can come and pick up your blonde now.
sweet dreams, love.
she blew it, didn't she?
Jarod? - Alive, still free!
so are you.
thanks for the robe.
give ne a lift?
to where, daddy? Another dead end？
what are you talking about? - Don't you dare!
you set me up, for a T-Board?
I was wondering how long it would take you to figure that out.
come on. You really don't think I could fool you.
you're a Parker.
I'd be stupid to even try.
besides these damn shoes are killing me.
if this is true, then why would you ally with Bridget?
Bridget cut a deal with the Triumvirate.
your butt for hers.
I had to go along with her to get rid of her for good.
action, reaction.
give and take.
it's not about who knows what.
it's about who thinks they know what and what you want them to think.
I... - To keep the hungry dogs away you must toss them a bone now and then.
is that what I am? A bone?
you're my legacy, and you proved it again today.
never forget that.
it'll keep you alive.
trust me.
you should find something you can trust.
and you trust me.
trust me.
how can you still trust him? Trust him?
will you be alright, Miss Parker?
of course.
let's get out of here.
let's go. Let's go.
sydney, do you think that someone in the Centre is really helping Jarod?
in the Centre? Anything's possible.
we're still searching for him and we'll find the leak.
did you uncover something that can help us find Jarod, Angelo?
keep working.
keep working.
see you tomorrow, same bat time same bat channel.
you remember me?
you don't learn so easy, do you, pal?
maybe not.
but I never make the same mistake twice.
who the hell are you?
I'm many people.
but tonight I'm a truck driver.
"Amnesia "
= YTET Presents =
'ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience during the delay... "
"we'll now begin boarding our airflight 105 San Diego. " - Oh, man!
is there a problem?
I got bumped.
I'm sure it was an accident.
with this many people， it's bound to be on attendant physical contact.
no. I got bumped from the flight. They are overbooked.
Oh.
I may miss registration.
you know I became a freshman of Art in San Diego.
next flight is in five hours.
by then, all the class I need will be closed.
here, take my seat.
no, no.
look, I am not in a hurry.
it's not like anybody's chasing me, today.
take it.
Oh, man. Are you sure? - I'm positive.
Thanks.
that's been real pleasure talking to you these last few hours.
you have a bright future ahead of you, Daniel.
good luck.
Thanks， Jarod. I hope you'll find your family.
thank you.
Thanks, Jarod.
you really saved my life.
what happened to your finger?
broke in my wrestling.
what did you do last night?
sorry to ask. - Yeah.
everything alright?
Mr. Lyle's personal file? - My father wants a list of anyone who might be Lyle's ally.
ever since Lyle's death, my father has been lobbying the Triumvirate to take off his position.
but he is running into blue blocks.
the allies of Mr' Lyle know that your father opposed him.
the fact that you killed him only increases their resistance to his promotion.
even dead, Lyle is pinning the ass.
something was, excuse me, something was just delivered.
I think you want to see.
this one.
lockers? - Where the hell did these come from?
Jaord sent them.
class of 1983, Douglas High School.
Townsend, Nebraska.
why did Jarod send this yearbooks?
page two.
there is a name tag in my book.
who is Ricky Sanders?
professor Tom Greer.
Oh, god. - Who did you get?
Mrs. Ricky Sanders.
I always thought you'd make a nice couple. - Yeah, when monkeys fly.
Jarod is expecting us to attend this reunion, Mrs. Sanders.
brilliant inside, Syd.
but then it did make you the professor.
look at this.
"always stay the way you are, unless you want to survive. "
that's Jarod telling us for a danger.
Broots, I want you to check all the" idiots "in this book.
unless I have more information, or I'm not going to the "axillary place" in the Armpit Oklahoma.
it's Nebraska.
hell is hell, Broots.
what's going on?
flight 105 has crashed near San Diego.
what?
there were fatalities.
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.
there was a young man on board.
I gave him my seat. His name is Daniel Falk.
I am sorry, sir. I can't just give out... - please!
Daniel Falk's body was positively identified at the scene. I'm sorry.
Thanks, Jarod. You really saved my life.
there are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
Thitry-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
how many people died because of what I thought up?
since I broke up, I spent very moment searching for my past.
he is a pretender.
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
the Center wants him alive. - Preferably.
he defends the weak and abused.
life is a gift.
you are a doctor?
I am today.
thanks for Lady, fuselage stayed intact.
kept the body count down.
Jarod Lindsay, NTSB Washington.
I am here to help with the investigation.
I can't get paper close up our request, but an investigator I don't need that they send to me.
well, if you like you could get Washington on the phone.
you could tell them yourself what incompetent managers they are.
Diane Post. I prefer able buddies to paper clips, welcome.
we just got these surveillance photos from the crash scene.
any signs of mechanical problems?
no. The plane passed FA inspection last week.
we are focusing on pilot error.
both pilots survived?
they've been sent to Centennial Memorial.
flight recorder? - It'll come in a while.
I want to be there when it's opened.
do I look anything like this Ricky Sanders guy?
if you swallow the blimp.
how did Jarod expect me to fool anyone to believe that I am him?
just tell them you shut up with Jenny Craig before you married me.
that don't explain the hair.
it's a high school reunion, Broots.
the only thing more pervasive than love handles with smaller ...
what about" Miss pig"?
Oh, no photo.
you are not alumni.
apparently Ricky met his wife overseas.
they both work as missionaries at a catholic charity in Africa.
this amuses yo？
that Jarod wants people to believe that you are a missionary.
Broots, did you find anything about Professor Tom Greer?
he was only at the school for one semester in 83.
taught obscure languages.
he died in Hawaii two years ago.
rest of class's business is usual.
Oh, last page here there is a list of people under the words "camera shy " .
Oh, yeah. They didn't have their photo taken.
I tracked them down. There is nothing special.
except, well, two were dead.
a deader than Townsend, Nebraska.
call the hotel and book some rooms for the shindig.
Oh, Jarod already did.
there are non-smoking rooms.
perfect.
Mr. Larson, some questions!
do you have anything to say to the families of the victims?
my heart goes out to everyone involved.
as a father who almost lost his son, I certainly share their pains.
can you tell us what happened?
he is not allowed to issue a statement until he talks to the NTSB.
but I would like to offer my prayers to those who lost loved ones.
excuse us, please. I just want make sure my son gets little rest, okay?
thank you, thank you very much.
first thing first.
let us see what the pilot has to say.
she suffered blunt trauma to the temple lobe which affects memory acquisition.
the chances of recording details of the crash are extremely slim.
so ，there is really nothing you can tell us?
like I said, I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.
and I can remember the screams.
but besides that, I am sorry.
thank you for your time, Mrs. Wylie. We'll be in touch.
I'll be outside in a second.
you are going to be alright.
it's like somebody painted my mind black.
when I think about my passengers, maybe it's better that I can't remember.
I want to make a difference of my life.
I read this quote once.
"we have but a rich moment in time. "
it made me realise we aren't here for so long.
eleven people died.
but I lived.
what makes me so special?
I can remember being on the approach to San Diego.
and I can remember the screams.
eleven people died.
but I lived.
what makes me so special?
can you believe how friendly the Nebraskans are?
this isn't Nebraska, Broots. It's a halfway house for ...
Ricky, Ricky, is that you?
you have changed.
you lost a ton, son.
and this must be...
nobody you want to know.
well.
maybe we'll see you and the Mrs later at the hill ride.
Yeah, the hill ride, okay.
a way to blend in.
all set.
now this is mine. And 305 is for you two.
you two? - Small town, Mrs. Sanders.
the last thing we want is for people to wonder why you're not staying with your husband.
there'll better be booze in the courtesy bar, or someone is going to pay.
Hey.
I thought we've agreed that I would be here when we open these boxes.
we couldn't locate you and time isn't some we have a lot over around here.
evidence from the flight data recorder indicates the elevators were set at a wrong angle for landing.
giving the flight we do speed on descent, fail of the elevators to provide proper lift led directly to the crash.
who set the elevators? - We don't know.
the cockpit voice recorder is still in lock. - Malfunction. Never started recording on take off.
I've never heard of this happening before.
it is rare, but not without presence.
hell that happened on the flight I piloted once.
at least now, with no mechanical malfunction, we can focus on pilot error.
which leaves the question.
which pilot?
my dad tells me how to play.
you never play basketball with your dad?
I just want my parents proud.
you did, Daniel.
you did.
"Airista Crash Claims Eleven Lives "
"pilot Error Questioned "
"families Grieve "
I don't know if I'll ever be able to climb to the cockpit again.
you get no argument from me. You're gonna be far too busy in Airista.
Brandon is one day going to take over the organisation.
sooner I get him behind the desk, the better.
Mr. Larson, we need to question Brandon alone.
well, I am not here as the head of the airline, and here as Brandon's father.
we will appreciate that, sir, but this is standard procedure.
fine, if you need me, I'll be in the waiting room.
the voice recorder on your flight aren't function.
we have no record of what happened in the cockpit.
Mrs. wylie suffered a head trauma. Therefore your memory of the event is critical.
we'd like you to carefully take the memory of last few minutes before the crash.
we just received final approach instructions.
I was focused on my checklist.
everything seemd calm.
and all the sudden, we stalled.
angela was yelling about the mountain.
I looked down my window, just to see the wings slash into trees.
you seem to be very warm.
would you like some water?
no, no.
no, it's this pain killers.
made me a little fevers.
anyway, I can only guess some of our gauges are malfunctional.
according to the flight data recorder, all systems were working fine.
it indicated the elevators were set at 0 instead of 20 degrees.
that's why the plane stalled on its descend.
Oh, god.
what is it?
is there something on your mind? - This is really hard.
angela is a good friend. We've logged over half million miles together.
But?
when I called out "elevators 20 degrees " on the checklist, Angela gave me a positive.
I guess she just wasn't paying attention.
look, Jarod, it was pilot error.
and the pilot seems to be Angela Wylie. - Maybe.
the guy tells exactly what happened and what do you need.
he said he was on pain killers.
principal actions of those compounds are analgesics and sedation.
wouldn't cause a fever.
isn't that possible that guy's just nervous rack?
pilots are human.
if I've just been in the plane crash, and I detained my friend, I'll be sweating too.
is that what you really belive, Diane?
you know, Miss Parker, if you look at this like a mini vacation from the Center, you may actually enjoy yourself.
these people are dead from neck up and don't even know it.
Why?
because the couple in the lobby were married for 14 years and they go to church on sunday, and they coach little league?
I wish my exwife and I had been that lucky.
just how hard did you fall on your head when you fall from the turnip truck?
okay. What's so great about your life?
you're forced to stay at the Center until you catch a guy they stole from his parents.
you drown by the murder of your mother.
competing for your father's attention with a ball headed lunatic dragging with oxygen tank then you...
careful!
I am just saying, I'd take a sunday sermon and a little league game any day with all that.
Hey.
Jarod sent us another yearbook, "Not every picture tells a story " , what does that mean?
he wants us to focus on the "camera shy " .
coming?
dear?
the blood test on you and Brandon were negative.
so there will be felony charges but...
you will be charged with negligence.
I suggest you contact the pilot's union and arrange for legal council.
Oh, my god.
the voice recorder malfunctioned.
the only thing we have to go on is Brandon's testimony.
if there is anything at all that you can remember.
I can't remember anything.
the voice recorder did not function?
the imprints are already demagnetized.
Hi. How are you doing? Hey.
any look with the "camera shy " ?
I found two. Both are for village idiot of that year.
you? - I met one.
farmer's wife, seven kids, wallet full of pictures.
and guess whom he's married to?
Zena. What's your secret?
you gonna ask her.
I've never met a missionary before.
there is a shocker.
and Ricky! Who ever thought he became a man of God.
you know, he and I dated a few times.
has he ever mentioned me?
he often remind this about, playing tongues on hockey with you in the barn after the saturday night hoot nannie.
ladies and gentlemen, before we come to the end of this wonderful evening, I'd like to take a moment to remember a couple of students who no longer with us because the Lord has called them on home.
the first is, - Diana Hydra. - Oh, god. It's almost over.
and we're not close to knowing why Jarod sent us here.
and when we start.
if you may remember he died in the senior year.
so we don't have a graduation photo of Bobby Bowman.
but we were able to enlarge a picture from a group shot of the Farmers of Tomorrow club.
I'm out of here. - Miss Parker!
Oh, my god.
this resemblance is unmistakable.
Bobby Bowman is Mr. Lyle?
are you sure this is Brandon Larson's file?
this lab has zero tolerance for error. The stakes were too high.
something doesn't make sense.
Brandon Larson's last FAA physical macrostatic blood count was ten.
but in this test you took after the crash, the count is fifteen.
I thought macrostatic blood counts never vary.
they don't.
who brought in these blood samples?
your chief investigator, Clark Thomas.
don't let Jarod's wild speculations confuse you.
and what about Brandon's sweating?
he said pain killers wouldn't do that.
Diane, listen， that the evidence is very clear.
just have that report ready to go in the morning.
one guy tried to give me illegal payoff.
but my dad was telling me you can never go wrong doing the right thing.
I turned him down.
what did your dad teach you, Clark?
you saved my life...
Thanks, Jarod, you really saved my life.
a young man died because of me.
I gave my seat on airplane.
the plane crashed.
I am sorry.
Jarod, we all want to believe that we can control the events in life.
but it's only an illusion.
he had everything to live for.
family.
future.
now he is gone.
I am still here.
I am afraid you and I could spend the rest of this lifetime debating fate, Jarod.
lifetime?
is that how long this will hurt?
anything?
I found a police file on Bobby Bowman according to the Omaha's coroner's records ... - Up here, Broots.
Omaha's coroner reported Bobby Bowman was murdered sixteen years ago.
by his father.
Mr. Lyle, Bobby Bowman it is, faked his own murder, and framed his father?
and I thought my family was screwed up.
Bowman's body was found headless and in the bed of his father's pick-up truck.
but the body was so decomposed that they couldn't get the proper ID.
have lost sound trace of dental records and of course, decomposition would make fingerprint identification impossible.
so, if the body was not Mr. Lyle's, then, whose body was it?
Broots, go back to the Blue Cove, see if you can find out Lyle's early years in the Center.
and us? - You and I are gonna pay a visit to Mamie Elkem.
Bobby was adopted, you know.
Bobby was a good little boy for the most part.
and then when he was around fifteen years old, something just seemed to snap.
okay, boys, come and get it.
one day, he was sweet sugar.
the next, mean as a snake, violent too.
after a while, my husband just couldn't deal with him.
he felt Bobby need a discipline.
so he started to lock him in the shed out in the back.
I felt that was a little harsh.
but as my husband said, the roof didn't leek and there was no vermin in it.
you two dogs stop that barking and get in here.
this's a friend of Bobby's?
Oh, Jimmy Radloff. But he died.
that was a sad day for Bobby.
how did Jimmy die?
Bobby and Jimmy went hiking one day.
they got separated.
only Bobby came home.
Jimmy just disappeared without a trace.
well, they looked all over for him but they never found his body.
I've heard enough!
Hey! You don't stop your howling...
now we know whose body Lyle used to frame his dad.
personally, I felt that Jimmy ran off and away.
he came from a terrible family.
his father was a drunkard and his mother, well, Lyle and I always thought she was deaf ...
that's my husband's name.
although he insisted Bobby called him mister.
Angela? They told me the hospital you've been released that...
may I come in?
it's kind of dark in here, don't you think?
that's not the answer.
all that I've ever wanted to do is be a pilot.
they were preliminaries findings.
nothing has been decided.
no. They already told me to get an attorney.
that's standard procedure.
that will be civil sues.
I can't face those families.
listen to me.
I don't believe that the crash was your fault.
based on what?
those people who had their lives taken from them, they had no choice.
don't dishonour their memory by taking your own.
give me the chance to prove you are innocent.
once Jimmy Radloff disappeared, Bobby really got bad.
though there was no control of him except lock him in the shed.
he hit his father with a shovel once.
I'm pretty sure that that was this push Lyle to kill Bobby.
and cut off his head?
well, I did think that was a bit extreme.
where is your husband now?
solitary confinement, Topeka Penitentiary.
Lyle rubs people the wrong way.
I best get supper on...
the shed measures eight by ten.
same as a prison cell.
if my father had locked me at a hole like this, I wouldn't have framed him, I would've killed him.
clearly Mr. Lyle was driven to influence slower functioned.
unfortunately, he didn't confine his need to just his father.
I am sorry to bother you, sir.
but I've received the rather disturbing tip.
that your son was using prescription drugs, not on the FAA authorize list.
it is ridiculous. - Maybe so.
but accusation is so serious that going to require an investigation.
I assure you if my son've done anything that foolish, I would know about it.
you have any idea how many flight truckies are barking for a seat in the cockpit for their major career?
I know some who had no trouble lieing to get pilot grounded, open up a slot...
I am sure that's true.
why would he jeopardise his future by taking unauthorized drugs?
besides, I wouldn't allow him to.
I have no choice on this matter.
you always have the choice.
tell it to the victims of flight 105.
Clark Thomas. - Jarod Lindsay was just here.
he said he is going forward with an investigation to rumours that my son is using unauthorized prescription drugs.
where did he hear that? - I don't know. It doesn't matter. What does matter, is the fact that you promised to have this thing off, agree?
Yes, sir.
then get on it.
"Reconstructing Data, Demagnetizing Cylinder "
my gilr-friend gave me this.
she is afraid I'm gonna forget her.
it is nice known to have somebody care so much about you.
besides folks, you know I mean.
Yep.
"data Reconstruction Complete "
our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.
we're not gonna clear that way... - I'm sorry, Angela...
pull up, pull up. - I am sorry, Angela! Oh, My God!
I told you to put two notches. We're not gonna clear that way.
pull up, pull up.
our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches.
we're not gonna clear that way.
pull up, pull up. - I am sorry, Angela! I forgot. I'm sorry, Oh, My God!
our elevators are at zero degrees. I told you to put two notches. We're not...
this's your idea of sick joke?
no.
my idea of a sick joke is lying to protect your career while destroying Angela Wylie's.
you are crazy.
am I?
she didn't cause the crash.
you did.
it wasn't your blood that Clark Thomas took to the lab.
you were flying alright.
and what? Speed?
methamphetamines to sharpen your senses?
so why you're sweating so badly.
that's not true.
did you know that Angela was thinking of taking her own life, because she couldn't deal with the guilt of killing eleven people?
shall we let her?
rounded up to a nice even dozen?
all because of you.
I'll see you can take a position at Airista and make your father happy.
there is no room for error with my father.
you have to be perfect.
and if you're not, he just bribe Clark's tongue to fix it, right?
he found about my drug intake after the crash.
and it's routine he's been control like he controls everything else.
he picked my schools, my girlfriends, my career.
so how much works does he have to get before you say "no"?
you don't understand.
nobody says no to my father.
not me, not Clark Thomas, no one.
don't you think it's time that someone did?
so Mr. Bowman, tell us about your son, Bobby.
I hated that little bastard.
but I didn't kill him.
who did?
if I knew that, I wouldn't be in here, would I?
if I'd bet I'd say it was probably that counselor that started coming around when Bobby was fifteen years old.
from the adoption agency.
said he was checking up to see how Bobby was getting along.
but Bobby was getting along fine till he showed up.
they started spending time together.
too much time.
do you remember anything about this counselor?
Oh, my lawyer tried to find him ever after I was arrested.
but he never worked for the adoption agency.
Oh, I think no.
these padlock cutouts on the wall, what do they signify, Mr. Bowman?
somebody's idea of sick joke.
they've been showing up once a month ever since I got here.
I use them to keep track of time.
except for the last month when they stopped coming.
that's because Mr. Lyle is dead.
I want you to hear something.
Clark? It's Jarod.
there is something I want to see you about.
a jump plane? At least you can take me up a plane with a door.
what are you doing here?
Lindsay called, said he found something at the crash site you wanted me to see.
Oh, good.
everyone is here.
shall we?
I am sorry, Mr. Larson. There must be a misunderstanding.
Oh, there has been no misunderstanding.
I've uncovered some new evidence about what caused the crash.
what kind of new evidence?
the kind you have to see to believe.
gentlemen.
why are we so low? - Better to simulate the descent of flight 105.
Hey, will you take over for a minute?
I have to go in the back.
why don't you take my seat? It'll get a better view.
what new evidence could he have found?
there was nothing left on that mountain. The head has already been examined.
alright, what the hell is this all about?
he jumped!
what the hell is going on here?
pull up, get out of the tour.
I can't. It's jammed.
the hydraulic is ...
problem, boys?
well, now you know how Angela Wylie felt when she realised she was going to crash.
now there is a way for you to survive.
but it comes at a price.
what do you want?
truth.
about how you bribed Clark Thomas to cover for the fact that was really your son, that caused the crash of flight 105.
speechless, ah?
careful. The voice recorder is taking down everything you say.
only Clark won't be able to demagnetize the voice cylinder.
70 seconds to impact.
if they find what's left in the plane, they will do toxicology test on your bodies.
anything you got to hide, Mr. Larson?
Oh, it's too bad.
because Clark won't be around to temper with the blood tests.
50 seconds.
damn it, Jarod!
okay, I did it, I took the bribe.
now unlock the slabs.
what about you, Mr. Larson?
Larson, tell him, damn it.
is your reputation more important to you than your life?
we are going to crash, tell him.
alright, it's solved.
I bribed Clark Thomas to protect my son.
Clark, there is a toggle switch underneath your seat.
push it backward.
I was close. Just let you know, there is only enough gas in your tank to get you back San Diego.
Oh, by the way, there is a police car waiting for you when you get there.
I am not buying your theory about Mr. Lyle's, Syd.
please, Miss Parker, listen.
all I am saying is as if Lyle was able to fake his death as a teenager, well, perhaps he has done it again.
and that's what Jarod has been trying to tell us all this time, that Lyle is alive.
I shot the son of bitch myself, Sydney.
I saw him fall into the river, you and I were there together when they dragged his body from the water.
a headless body.
so?
exactly the way he faked his death the last time. - There is no last time, the man is dead.
there is nothing on Lyle.
except for date of employment and date of termination.
but I did find this under the name of Bobby Bowman.
it's a copy of adoption paper giving custody of Bobby, Mr. Lyle, to the Bowman's.
it's only one reason the Center would have records of Lyle's adoption.
they arranged it.
I'll get Lyle's body exhumed... - Oh, no, no, you can't.
the Center had Lyle's body cremated.
"Plane Crashed Cover-up Revealed "
thank you, Jarod.
you saved my life.
can I help you?
Oh, Daniel.
my name is Jarod.
I met Daniel while we were waiting for the plane.
it was overbooked and he was going to get bumped.
he was worried about missing his registration.
I don't understand.
I gave your son my seat on the flight.
I am so sorry.
I just thought you...
I should probably go.
wait.
please, would you, would you come inside?
tell us about your time with our son.
Thanks, Jarod.
you really saved my life.

daddy?
well, are you gonna invite me in?
Hello? -Of course.
Hello? Miss Parker?
come in.
I like what you've done with the place.

you'd just come home from your first piano recital.
what was the name of that piece you played? "For Elise."
Bach's Minuet in G.
daddy what are you... -Oh， she was so beautiful, like you.
I wish people would remember your mother the way she really was.
they always taint her memory with lies.
lies?
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.
the truth about Mum is in my heart.
nothing can change that.
daddy?
why are you here?
well, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
I just， ah...make sure you are alright.
Bach's Minuet in G?
I would love to hear you play that again.
you sure it was her father? -Yeah.
strange that Mr Parker would go back to that house after all these years.

miss Parker.
Oh, this came for you.
I hear your father came to visit.

I bet you do.
put the gun down and turn around.
I can't allow you to walk out of here.
we got ourselves a problem then, don't we?
shut up.
now I'm going to count to three.
you're going to lay that pistol down onto the floor.
one.
two.
get back.
now!
what the hell are you looking at? Check the front door.
get down.
now!
you have something to say, Sister?
nothing you want to hear.
keep that way.
Alright， everybody up, move over here. Come on!
it's not too late to stop this.
tell him that.
now shut up and move!
this is Lieutenant Roll.
I want SWAT snipers deployed to all buildings across the street and surrounding the bank.
I did that, Lieutenant.
sniper teams deployed and in position in three minutes.
okay, get me an open line into the bank!
get those people back!
come on! Let's go! Move! Come on!
everyone in!
everybody down behind the Manager's desk. Now!
move!
get down!
you move, you are dead.
we want your valuables. Watches, rings, wallets, whatever you've got, give it up.
your wallet.
inside.
hurry up.
that means you too, lady, come on.
he looks like he's just seen a ghost.
he has. And I intend to rattle some bones as soon as I can get to him.
how was it that this guy is still alive and I didn't know about it?
well, I guess that Daddy keeps some secrets from you.
did he tell you about those letters?
I'm sure he didn't know about them.
Oh， that would be a stretch considering I stole them from his strongbox.
I'm afraid I woke him up.
when?
last night.
why are you here?
well, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
Hey, you think a man with as much to lose as your father would have a better home security system.
you are lying.
ask him about that little gift I left for him.
are you sure it was Jarod?
he took some of Catherine's things and some of mine and left this behind.
Jarod is rubbing our noses in it.
whose phone is that?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Miss Parker?
Hello? - Give it.
miss Parker?
it's Broots.
it's Broots.
can you hear me? Hello? Hello?
watches and wallets, come on, give it up.
put it in the bag.
you weren't going to shoot my little brother, were you, lady?
I'll leave the executions to you.
throw something over him.
out of sight, out of mind, ah?
Hey!
leave her alone.
alright.
alright.
get up.
what? - Get up!
what are you doing, Clavell?
getting us out of here.
come on.
come on.
two armed robbers have entered the Dover Town Bank.
we do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken.
she never hung up the phone so I was able to triangulate the signal.
and called the Dover Police, they told me about the robbery.
then I called Mr Parker's office, but nobody's got back to me.
we need to go to Dover.
without a directive from upstairs? Sydney, forget it. - Miss Parker is not just a colleague, Broots.
she is a friend.
just a minute, a situation is developing.
one of the robbery suspects is emerging from the bank with a hostage at gunpoint.
sydney, is that who I think it is?
I want a helicopter to the airport and I want a plane waiting on the runway!
Oh, boy.
you got one hour to set it up or people start to die!
where is this?
Dover.
dover Town Bank?
round up your group.
"april 13th 2 AM. We failed to rescue Timmy. "
No!
"Raines had already destroyed that sweet little boy."
Raines, what are you going to do with Timmy now?
there is no Timmy any more.
they'll call him Angelo now.
"we plan to rescue Jarod tonight and tomorrow you and I will be on our way to a better place. "
"all my love, Mum. "
going somewhere?
apparently not.
there is no smoking here.
call a cop.
I need the key to the outer vault door.
dad, give it to him.
dad?
this your daughter, Frank?
you stay away from her.
okay, dad.
she sure is a peach though.
your mother should be shot for sending you here.
if you cared about me, she wouldn't have asked me to do this.
that's what she said? I don't care about you?
she is telling you lies.
lies.
Yeah, the kind Jarod perpetuates about her, about me.
the parents lying to their children.
now where have I heard that one before?
my father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me.
like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a suicide?
but if you really believe that why are you so hell bent on finding out what Mr Fenigor has to say?
combo to the vault cage?
only the senior manager has it. He's not in today.
how are you doing, sweetie?
why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
why don't I put a bullet through your brain?
I can open the vault.
what are you? Some kind of handyman?
just versatile.
you know there's another way out of here.
one with less bloodshed, specifically yours.
what are you talking about?
there is a vent that leads down to a main sewer line.
it leads right out of here.
then how do you know that?
I studied the blueprints before I came in here.
you're not the only one who's on the run.
so you're a handyman and a fugitive architect?
you are versatile.
now open it.
that's very good.
let's go.
tell the cops to bring us something to eat, I'm starving.
you are always starving.
get in there.
give me a bag.
come on.
keep an eye on.
Mr. Fenigor.
my name is Jarod.
do you remember me?
should I?
I was one of the children that you and Catherine Parker tried to rescue from the Centre.
you tried to help me once.
please.
help me now.
I, I don't knwo what you are talking about.
you are the only person who can help me find out who my parents are.
look you are being held against your will, you feel trapped and you feel terrified.
I lived my entire life that way, please, help me.
you and her together?
it's complicated.
you don't know what you're asking of me. - I am asking you to honour Catherine Parker's memory.
please tell me who my parents are.
help me find out who I am.
I can't.
please.
I can't. I'm sorry. I just can't. - Mr. Fenigor.
no.
no.
Hey.
I have to help him.
I didn't shoot him so he could be helped.
Clave. - Not now, Jude.
Hey, hey, hey!
it's one thing to defend yourself against an armed bank guard.
it's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back.
if this man dies, so do you.
in the electric chair.
the bullet punctured his lung.
he's drawing in air from the exit wound.
I need hand towels and I need some soap. - In the bathroom.
details at this time are sketchy, however another shot was just heard from inside the bank.
I'm going to make my way to the SWAT commander now for confirmation.
don't you die on me.
I need a plastic bag and I need some tape.
I've got a bag.
we have to seal the wound or he won't be able to breathe.
cut off strips about this long.
apply constant pressure to the wound like this.
I have to get him to a hospital. - Nobody goes anywhere!
maybe we should do it.
it's just one guy.
nobody goes anywhere!
find me something to elevate his legs.
he's diaphoretic.
his pulse is thready and he's bleeding internally.
I can stabilize him for a while but we need to get him to surgery.
what the hell am I doing here?
how does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator? - Well, you wouldn't be the prey if you get back to the Centre where you belong.
Oh, nice!
fitting.
you are so willing to ruin my life.
is your father's validation that important to you?
I'm standing here with Christy Isaac whose daughter Kaylee is a hostage inside the bank. Christy?
please don't hurt my daughter.
she's all I have.
mum.
Kaylee, Kaylee, I love you.
Frank, please take care of her.
it's difficult for little girls to figure out their fathers, isn't it?
what?
you give your loyalties to a man who fills your head with lies.
lies about those letters, lies about Fenigor. - And I suppose my loyalty should go out to you.
and what would you do if Fenigor confess that it was your father who killed your mother? - He did't. He loved her.
you are so sure of that, aren't you, Miss Parker?
it appears to me that the police seem to be mobilising for a possible assault on the bank.
everybody into the vault.
let's go.
how is he doing?
he is stable, for now.
how well do you know him?
comes in every Friday to pull cash out of his trust account.
does he ever come in to make deposits?
his account is funded by an outside source.
some company from Blue Cove.
so the Centre is paying Fenigor to keep quiet.
question is who?
and quiet about what?
over here, Broots.
anything?
no.
police, locals, no one I recognize.
maybe we are the only ones who know that Jarod is here.
think again.
it's Gar and another of Raines' guys.
they're not the only ones. That's Sam.
this place is crawling with Sweepers.
we need to figure out what Raines is up to.
I'll follow Sam.
you follow the others.
wait, wait, wait, Sydney.
Oh， God, what am I doing here?
I must be out of my mind.
what are they doing?
working on escape plan B.
"april 13th, 7AM. "
"I have a bad feeling about the people surrounding me. "
"if I can just get through this tonight， we'll be on our way to a better place. "
"all my love, Mum. "
I know it's not easy reading those letters.
look I broke into your father's house, trying to find something about my past, but instead I found out about yours.
your mother deserved a better fate than what she got.
you're damn right she did.
she used to send me letters on my birthday, holidays.
I never knew about these.
my father paid me a visit this morning.
talking about how you taint the memory of my mother with lies.
and you believed him.
daddy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
hold it. - I cannot.
these men are crazy. I'm not going to risk getting us both killed.
what are you doing?
your job.
the kid has to use the bathroom, so do I.
hold it. - Hey, give us a break, huh?
thanks for what you did back there.
when you got to go, you got to go.
my Dad says that he wants to take care of me, but, but then he lies to me.
daddy.
why are you here?
Ah, bad dream.
I was awake all night.
I don't know what to believe.
believe what's in your heart.
come on.
mr Fenigor, you've been shot. Don't try to move.
you saved my life.
I did what was needed to be done.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I took you from your family.
I do want to let you know how sorry I am. - Mr Fenigor， please.
tell me who my parents are.
is that the key to his safe deposit box?
there might be something about my mother in there. - If there is, you'll get it.
miss Parker, I brought you this far. I'm not going to shut you out now.
Fenigor, my mother called you her friend.
you owe her. You owe the both of us the truth.
who killed my mother?
who killed my mother?
miss Parker, please, he can barely breathe.
who's paying you off to keep it a secret?
what's happening to him? - There must be blood around his lungs.
I need some sort of tube to drain it out.
I have a sports bottle on Daddy's desk.
Jude, the old man can't breathe. We need the water bottle that's on the Manager's desk.
I don't know.
he's gonna die if we don't help him.
I know you couldn't do anything about that guard, but you can do something now.
just hang on, come on.
get back.
don't Move!
back off, or I drop little brother.
I've already shot two people. You think one more's gonna make a difference?
no, please. Please don't kill my father.
what's it gonna be?
Mr. Raines guy is in a SWAT uniform. He is right up there.
the target must be Jarod.
we have to take care of the sniper before he shoots Jarod.
well, don't look at me. I can't even squash a bug, Sydney.
then guard the alleyway.
don't let anyone follow.
are you up to this, Broots?
no, but it's never stopped me before.
sydney, Mr Raines would like to see you.
you won't be needing that.
what the hell were you doing in there?
she said the old guy needed help.
help?
I need help.
you pull something like that again, you're gonna end up just like the guard.
brother or not.
you okay?
I wanna go home.
me too.
get away from her.
what?
she tried to save us. - You could have got us all killed.
it's okay. - No, it's not.
you do as I say. I'm your father. - Oh yeah, since when?
you know, you can keep your money.
I cannot believe Mum thought it would make a difference if I came down here.
this is because of you.
I can't figure out if you're ignorant or just stupid.
you listen to me. - No, you listen to me!
you think that little girl came down here today for money?
there is something here a lot more important to her than cash.
and I feel real sorry for you if you're too blind to see what that is.
miss Parker reached out to help someone.
spare me.
your mother would be very proud of you.
you put on quite a show today.
sydney taught you well.
sydney taught me to believe that you can be anything you want to be.
you should have known better than to come here without a directive.
you should know better than to defy Tower policy by having Jarod assassinated.
you're in over your head, Sydney.
shoot him if he tries to leave.
I've made some mistakes.
I don't want to lose you.
Mr. Fenigor?
you were my mother's friend.
her confidant.
please tell me who killed her.
he is not gonna tell me.
maybe he already has.
could you really do it, Gar?
could you kill me if I stepped out of this car?
Yeah.
move the car, buddy.
thank you， kindly Gar.
now do as the officer says, move the car.
Fenigor's deposit records.
transfer from the Centre Bank in Vinemy.
ten thousand dollars a month.
every month for the last twenty-eight years.
do you recognise the account number?
no. - It's your father's.
how do you know?
you'd be surprised what I know about him.
that's it?
that's it.
what else does he know?
Apparently， everything.
mr Fenigor.
what secrets are in this envelope?
what is it?
it's about prodigy.
this is where you came from.
get me out of here and I'll tell you everything.
both of you.
what are you going to do with that dye pack egg?
well.
handyman was right.
there's an access entrance to the main sewer line.
we're gonna get out of here, little brother.
come on.
this is your lucky day, people.
thanks to Jarod's brilliant escape plan none of you will have to die today.
in spite of everything, it's been a real gas.
well, at least we won't starve.
give me that one.
what? - Give it.
come on, Jude.
Jude, what the hell are you doing?
hurry up! Help me with the old man!
be careful with him!
out, out.
hurry.
mind if I cut in?
I don't like being locked up in little rooms.
this is mine.
well, thank you, Jarod.
let's get out of here.
the crisis is over. The hostages are coming out of the bank now and the paramedics have gone in.
move, move, come on.
mr Fenigor.
mr Fenigor, why is my father paying you?
is it about who killed my mother?
answer me.
in the red files. - Red files?
prodigy red files. - Prodigy.
freeze.
all units, shooter second story 641 building across from the bank. Move.
please.
you were right. Fenigor was in there.
did we get him?
wounded. He is in an ambulance.
I'll take care of the details.
do you think he told her anything?
nothing that can't be denied.
are you alright?
perfect.
where is Jarod?
he got away.
another failure.
I'm fine, daddy.
well?
maybe you'll sleep better tonight.
"march 20th, 1970. "
"I am counting the days until our trip to Europe. "
"how excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world. "
"for now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us. "
"but I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th. "
"all my love, Mum. "
daddy?
am I still welcome here?
it's late.
thank God you're alright.
I'm sorry I didn't say that earlier.
you didn't have to come all the way out here to tell me that.
Oh， yes, Angel, I did.
see, I wasn't entirely forthcoming with you this morning.
Oh?
truth is, somebody broke into my house last night.
that's terrible.
I hope you didn't lose anything valuable.
Ah, nothing that can't be replaced.
I wish I'd known earlier. I could have asked Jarod if he had anything to do with it.
hmm, well, I wanted you to know.
can't have secrets between family now, can we?
daddy?
how come that Center sniper shot that old man outside the bank?
Oh, tragic accident.
any idea who he was?
not a clue.
get some rest, Angel.
you sure earned it.
what?
I never had a chance to say goodbye.
how did you get away?
escape plan B, remember?
the vent.
how was it down there?
let's just say that I'm hoping my next pretender isn't as a sewer worker.
did you talk to your father?
he just left.
he didn't say it was you who broke into his home, didn't say it wasn't either.
Fenigor?
I told him I didn't know who he was.
so you lied?
like father like daughter.
Jarod, we were so close to finding the truth.
you'll figure it out.
and so will I.
the question is, what becomes of us when we have all our answers?
that is the question.
this is where you came from.
you know what the hell is this?
well, it's like a medical bed, you know, for having babies.
with shackles?
property of The Center Blue Cove, Delaware 1077 4039 "
Mr. Fenigor, tell me who killed my mother.
the answer is in the red files.
red files?
prodigy red files.
what secrets are in this envelope?
this is where you came from.
prodigy. This is where you came from.
nugenesis Family Group Building the Future Together "
telegram To: XASF From: CIV2 PRODIGY THE BOY. 240 RTE 1, CHARLEVOIX, MICHIGAN "
as much as I'd like to make a sale, I have admitted it's kind of spooky.
tell me about the fire.
a family lived here at that time. A mother, a father and a young son.
the whole story was a tragedy.
rumour has it that boy was stolen and the parents disappeared the night the house burned.
do you know where they went?
they were renters.
property changed hands right after the fire.
it's now owned by a company out of Blue Cove, Delaware.
look, I am late for work.
I'll be glad to give them a call if you'd like to make an offer.
no, thank you.
I am late for work myself.
harvard, Med Johns Hopkins, from a medical stand point, I'll be foolish not to hire you as head of inseminology.
business stand point, having a doctor named Spock on staff could be worth million bucks.
I am glad to be a part of the Nugenesis Family.
family is what those fertility clinics all about.
you might say it's our job to make the future.
Dr. Haring, you have a moment?
there are pretenders among us.
I was taken from my family.
thirty-six hours, he is already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
how many people died because of what I thought up?
since I broke up, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
he is a pretender.
a genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
the Center wants him alive. - Preferably.
he defends the weak and abused.
life is a gift.
you are a doctor?
I am today.
Mr. Fenigor?
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
please tell me who killed my mother.
what did you mean by prodigy? What answers are in the red files?
please help me.
miss Parker.
you are not supposed to be here. No one is.
has he talked?
he hasn't spoken since they brought him in.
an opinion around here is that he never will.
well, we've tried in Vitro, Gift, Zift.
we've literally gone around the world trying to get pregnant.
but NuGenesis show us the only fertility clinic seems to get really care.
always will.
nugenesis prides himself being on the cutting edge of reproductive technology.
and I am proud to say that Jarod here, is on the cutting edge of all.
can you help us?
any couple with as much love to give as you two obviously have, deserve to have a child.
thank you.
Dr. Dewitt will be sharing duties as well.
anything you need, they're here for you.
a patient mental attitude is sometimes more important than his or her physical condition.
if her mind has faith, her body would follow.
Oh, it's up to us to make sure our patients keep that faith, so our science can do its job.
run these and get the results back to Dr. Spock, staff.
Spock? Funny.
for over thirty years, we helped couples like the Brewster realize the fruits of parenting.
thirty years?
long before you were born.
I like this guy.
my brother Boris would have liked him too.
my father. - And as he always said, " Get busy. "
well, I get to go.
I'll catch up with you later.
red files.
this is where you came from.
any word out of Fenigor?
he's still unconscious.
you look like you need to change your pamper.
Ah, something weird is going on with Mr. Raines.
everything going on with...
that half-burnt wheezing ghoul is weird.
no. He is packing up his office, to go.
well, find out where.
and while you will find out what prodigy means.
Oh, well, that's easy.
prodigy is someone extraordinary, very talented child.
I know what it means to webster's.
I want to know what it means to the Center. - Ok.
so you and Sydney find out everything you can about prodigy and something called " the red files " .
okay, I will do what I can, but Sydney's occupied.
doing what?
string soap adds grey matter?
I am putting him through an experimental neuro-stimulation therapy, that hopefully we'll unscramble Angelo's mind.
good luck pulling jello brains out of ...
let's go back to work, Angelo.
no Admittance "
patient Records Input Patient I. D.# 12-072463-01 "
what are you doing?
a new blood work on the Brewster's.
I want to cross check with the raw records.
I am afraid you are not allowed in here.
Jeremy is a pitbull for protocol.
hell, even I am not allowed back here.
uncle Nicholas's policy.
I'm sorry.
infertility is a sensitive personal issue.
one reason Nugenesis has been so successful is because of trust.
and confidentiality.
we don't even use patients' names.
only code numbers.
Jeremy will get anything you need. - Thank you.
good night, Jarod. - Good night.
only four more treatments left, my friend.
hope it works.
thank you.
good morning, ladies.
got to have a special pass to go up that way.
a pass? - That's Corridor Seven.
you are not allowed.
I am finding there's many places I am not allowed around here.
Mr. Raines Personal "
Oh, my god.
make sure all of these boxes are out of my office tonight. - Right.
I'll meet you later.
Hello, Jarod.
my name is Sydney.
I'll be taking care of you for a while.
Why?
where are my mum and dad?
here is a fresh bandage.
Why?
wherer are my mum and dad?
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.
if he starts sing " A rain in Spain " , I am gonna pass out.
Angelo's mind is working again.
we are restoring the neuro-pathways of his memory.
you know that serotonin isotope?
it seems to regenerate dead pathways.
however, if he doesn't get the entire dosage, he'll regress permanently.
I am impressed, Einstein.
but my gut tells me that Jarod has something to do with this.
Jarod wanted to know what could be discovered if Angelo's mind returned.
the potential is unlimited.
I believe he can even play the piano.
music.
what's going on?
cos then he woke up remembered he was Liberace.
Mr. Valentino played that as a child.
information of his mind has been absorbing for a lifetime.
it's starting to re-emerge.
this is the icying on a very freaky cake.
what are you bubbling about?
I found this in Raines' office. He had twenty more in file on his desk.
the desk just accidently I hid under for over an hour.
hiding is bad enough. But I had to watch what Raines did, you know, personal stuff.
what could have been so awful?
he changed his pants.
Oh, thanks for that.
why is Raines packing and moving?
and why this freak had twenty photos of the same school children?
red files.
he can't be doing it again.
not again. - Angelo, easy, Angelo.
he said red files.
then if he is getting his memory back, then he must know something about them.
if that's truth is somewhere in that demented mind, he might know who killed my mother.
miss Parker.
you have a mail.
this is where you came from. Red files.
rumour has it that the boy was stolen...
where are my mum and dad?
Oh, my god.
they're doing it again.
they're going to take another child.
the Center's going to make another pretender.
I thought the pretender program was discontinued years ago, Sydney.
calm down, Jarod, calm down.
they stole me from my parents.
and they are trying to steal another child, aren't they?
not sure. But the recent events make me feel you may be right at this.
and what are you going to this time? Are you just going to sit by and let it happen again?
Jarod, please. I think Angelo may hold some answers.
how the treatments working?
Yes.
he saw something that seemed to trigger the bad memory.
I know how he feels.
Dr. Jarod Spock "
he is over here.
what's wrong with him, Syd?
Angelo needs strip his treatment dotted with specifically time intervals.
come on, friend.
answers below.
what is prodigy, Angelo?
answers below.
he is pointing to the floor below us, sublevel 27.
inception " .
another birthing table.
it is a delivery room.
Oh, my god.
they're recreating this place.
what?
Oh, come on. Let's get out of here. - Broots.
answers here.
find the security cameras archives that belong to this room, anything and everything.
Yes, mam.
answers...
Syd, get Angelo his next treatment. Find out what else is in his head.
it may be the treasure chest I've been looking for.
my name is Sydney.
I'll be taking care of you for a while.
Why?
where are my mum and dad?
if you're looking for information, the way you're going about that you gonna get caught.
if you want help, I'll help you.
why should I trust you?
because your mother did.
I polished floors in this place for over thirty years.
I've seen a lot of people come and go.
the hearts in the hands, filled with love they want to share with the child.
your parents were like that.
how did you know them?
they were here over six months trying for a baby.
your mother treated me with respect.
I saw her a year so later.
I'll never forget the gleam she had in her eyes when she showed me her baby boy.
the same gleam that's in yours.
that's what hurt so much.
hurt?
I saw them a few years later.
she was scared, on the run.
somebody had stolen the boy.
my guess is that was you.
I've been searching for them.
part of your pain is because of me.
see I told Dr. Boris what she said.
there was a lot of weird stuff going on in Corridor Seven backed in, with kids.
testing and stuff.
Dr. Boris paid me to forget about it.
the weird stuff stopped.
Dr. Boris died and everything ran away.
until what?
a while back to start up again.
kids, testing, and then you showed up.
do you recognize any of these children?
it's a local elementary school.
one of these children is going to be taken, just like I was.
I may need your help to stop it.
I owe you that much.
and your mother.
thank you.
there is no Timmy.
from now on, his name be Angelo.
he is remembering what Raines told my mother after he fried his brain.
I am afraid he is remembering too quickly. - Well, cut his dosages or something.
I don't want him to pop before he can answer my questions.
can't be done.
the treatment is giving this specifically time stages that can't be interrupted.
any break in the schedule means the new pathways and the system will atrophy.
and if they do?
Angelo will regress to his previous self.
permanently.
Angelo. - There is no more Timmy.
from now on, he should be known as Angelo.
get me Mr. Raines.
I stored Dr. Boris's stuff down here, Jarod.
if you get red files anywhere, there is only one place it would be.
you ain't a safe cracker, are you?
maybe today,
I don't have to be.
you find something?
Yes.
me.
and the red files.
what is saying there about you?
it's personal... Blood type, blood scans, height, weight, it's all medical.
except for one thing.
destination.
destination?
it's blacked out.
I'd like you to solve a problem for me.
I was here.
pi times square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.
very good, Jarod. You are very special.
where are my mum and dad?
you won't believe what I've found.
what?
security videos logs in the mainframe, that correspond to the inception room.
And?
a visual record classified under Catherine Parker.
what?
it's the day you were born.
keep pushing.
miss Parker, it's your birth.
this is too weird.
Oh, well, it's just beginning.
here comes, here comes.
is that... - The Saint Dr. Raines.
Raines delivered me?
specks your bottom in a second.
I am going to puke.
it's a girl.
I can't believe he saw me nude.
okay, Catherine, the next one is coming. It's coming quick.
next one?
sydney, what's going on?
it appears you didn't arrive alone.
there is a trouble with the boy. Nurse.
what's wrong with him?
tell me what's wrong with him?
what else is on that?
the tape ends there. It cut off, or edited...
or erased.
so no one would find out the truth.
I had a brother.
I feel like I found a treasure chest, and inside it's only dust.
well, sometimes answers lead to more questions.
but for what it's worth, I do remember what your parents first names were.
Margaret and Charles.
Yeah.
which it still not to say they are your biological parents.
what do you mean?
back in those days, this was also a adoption agency not just a reproduction center.
Dr. Boris headed up the adoptions.
Dr. Nicholas ran conceptions.
another dead end.
maybe not.
Oakview 555-6507 "
the old Oakview Lodge, near Stone Mountain.
your parents used to stay there when they were here.
could be a treasure, could be dust.
Yes, just let me know when this's done, will you? I don't want any excuses. That...
angel.
that thing has a stop button?
Oh, yeah.
endows me my private pride, you do look exquisite sitting there.
some day you will, permanently.
parents always want what's best for their children, and...
of course, you look... - How dare you?
what?
why didn't you tell me I had a twin?
your mother and I, wanted to spare you unnecessary pain.
I was away when you both were born.
he died before he ever lived.
we buried him.
but not too pain.
pain or not, I have the right to know, I had a brother.
angel... - No, daddy.
parents make mistakes too.
he is in a small plot here on the Center grounds.
buried at 66. I can take you there. - No.
I'd, I'd rather find him myself.
you take one more step, I'm gonna blow your head off.
I will settle for " no vacancy " sign.
I'm so sorry.
it's just a awake head scared of burglary around here lately.
well, with the hour I know, I just didn't think anybody's gonna be checking in.
are you the owner?
Yeah.
Lewis King Road. And keep it to the stars.
well, you can name your pleasure.
I got mountain view, lake view.
I even got one room my old man used to tell people Jeff Davies slept in.
did you grow up here?
I grew old, never up.
do you recognize this woman?
Oh, my Lord.
you must be baby Jarod.
I'll never forget the winter I met your parents.
you know that the lake view I mentioned.
well, I think float's over.
and I went out on it, broke through.
your dad rushed in and saved my life.
what is it?
that's funny. You don't look like either one of your folks.
this cottage right here was theirs. Let's go and take a look.
Oh, here, this's it.
the light's working.
well, it's, it's not much.
but your dad loved the view.
major Charles.
that's what I called your dad on the kind of Air Force uniform.
air Force.
Yeah, he's a pilot.
he and your mummy used to sit out on this porch.
watched sun rise in the morning.
they really loved each other.
Lewis. - Yeah.
I would like to stay here for a little while if you don't mind.
make yourself at home.
you're sort of a family, " In finding Timmy, you set Angelo free. Thank you, Sydney "
good morning, class. My name is Jarod...
my name is Mr. Kotter.
and I will be your substitute teach for Miss Markam today.
well, the first of all business, is we'll divide up to small groups and we will...
Ah, yes, Ari.
we always start with Pledge of Allegiance.
Yes, I've heard of that.
why don't you to lead us off today?
I pledge our allegiance to the flag, of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
that's it?
that's it.
okay.
now we are going to divide up into groups.
as I call your name, please move to the table I assign you.
table number one: Albert Williams and Davy Simpkins.
table two...
tyrannosaurus Rex? Very good.
I would like you to solve this problem for me.
can we just cut out dinosaurs like the other kids?
class, work quietly for a moment.
I'll be right back.
where is Angelo?
he has escaped from the Center.
in finding Timmy, you set Angelo free. Thank you, Sydney "
that's, that's beautiful.
isn't it?
I hope you're proud of yourself, Syd.
great.
while Algernon is out there picking flowers,
and you two ponder your navels, I am left with buckets.
and you just wait till Raines finds out.
does Angelo have to take the serum? - I hope so.
he has three treatments left.
he misses one, and he'll regress to all the Angelo.
permanently.
and what he knows will be lost forever.
thank you, daddy.
Bye.
pi times the square root of 931 divided by the radius of the circle.
which one of you did this?
you did. - You're lying.
seven red files.
these were just found by a sweeper team in Angelo's space.
we're still searching.
you know the ramifications if this information's ever got out.
I want your blessing to accelerate prodigy, to ensure its success.
get the new one now.
go, bring us the child.
who is?
I got here as quick as I could.
it is so good to see you.
the real you.
it's good to be me.
thank you, Jarod.
it's a big world out here.
my parents stayed in this room a long time ago.
now I feel it's like it's me I am searching for.
I wonder if I ever know my parents.
you are in the red files too.
there are answers, Angelo.
you're just out to find them.
this is Timmy now.
what is it?
I heard that your brother died.
feel sad to know that.
Yes, it does.
it feels...
it feels sad.
these blocks, they were used by the child that the Center wants.
if you could just feel something that would tell us who it is.
Timmy feels nothing.
no.
Angelo did.
time for my treatment.
you are a very special little boy, Jarod.
red files. - Red files?
red files.
prodigy.
this is where you came from.
we are all special.
because of what's in our blood.
three color-coded samples as requested.
all three have blood samples on file.
how did you get pass Jeremy?
nothing as invisible as a man with a mop.
what are you going to do with them?
throw on waters.
wait until the sharks come.
I am sorry.
I don't know how much more disappointment she can take.
how are you holding up?
the first time we started talking about adoption.
the process takes forever.
we just want a chance to raise a child.
I am sure you'll get that chance.
morning, Jarod.
good morning, Dr. Haring.
I think Mrs. Brewster aren't pregnant?
no, not yet.
although I have found three excellent egg donor candidates.
those have been analyzed, did you? - Not yet.
but considering Mrs. Brewster's current cycle, I'd like to get on it right away.
I want a complete work up on these immediately.
so it shall be right now, so it shall be done.
let's hope we'll find what we are looking for.
Yes.
let's.
Dr. Dewitt, there is something you should see.
tell me you found Angelo.
no, but I found something else.
I think maybe Sydney should show it to you.
I just take a little break. - Broots.
last time I saw that little Bambi's mother was in my cross hairs.
well, I've been hitting dead ends on this birthing things, so this morning I helped myself to Raines's moving boxes where I found some personal surveillance files.
twice in three days?
Broots found something you need to see, Miss Parker.
sit down.
I'll stand.
uh, it's more of your birthing record.
what's wrong with him?
I'm sorry, Catherine. The second child is stillborn.
standard post-natal procedure for the baby girl and sedation for Catherine in the recovery.
Yes, doctor.
Oh, my god.
he was alive.
the male baby is ready for transportation to Nugenesis.
what's Nugenesis?
Yes.
I have a brother, out there.
is something wrong?
I found these in lab of on the doners' three blood samples.
I need to contact one of them right away.
did you find a perfect donor?
well, unfortunately not for the Brewsters.
but it is perfect match for a special project I am heading up.
Dr. Haring doesn't know, right?
anyway, the sooner you can get me the contact number on this subject, the better.
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
is this Davy's house?
well, it's the right address anyway.
Hello, I am sorry to bother you.
my name is Jarod Spock. And I am looking for Davy Simpkins.
you just missed him.
he doesn't live here? - He did.
we are Davy's foster parents.
Oh, we were. They found him a permanent home.
he just left.
they? - The man from child placement.
Davy called him the Snowman.
snowman?
because of his hair.
it is solid white.
Raines's cleaner, Gar.
is something wrong?
did he tell you where he was taking Davy?
I assume to the county airstrip.

93? - Yeah.

he wanted me to tell you,"he got away.
he said I had to find you.
no, please, uh, don't involve me in this.
involve you in what?
who is this guy and why was
why was he being chased by those
I don't know what they are, but they're after me now.
uh, he was just a drunk who used to come here and talk lots of crazy talk
if he's got himself into some kind of trouble, that's got nothing to do with me.
I have to go.
I can't let them see me with you.
why did he want me to find you?
he must've had a reason?
he got away.
Yes.
I didn't believe him.
I didn't believe.
go out through the back.

h-how can I get up?
how can I walk?
how long have I been here?
you know you are six.
please, I'm nobody.
I don't know anything, please!
but you do...
you are six...
you are village...
the truth is right inside you, six.
Look-look!
it's you.
and I thought you just wanted to dance with me.
h-how long have I been here?
well, you've been sleeping a while.
I thought I was dyin'.
help me.
what's happening to me?
I wish you didn't fight it.
fight what?
please, let me help you.
I don't want your help, lady--i want to get the hell outta here.
look, here's what's gonna happen
I'm gonna fetch you a cold drink and then, someone is gonna take you home.
you're a free man.
I'd like to speak to the American council, please.
look, see how the sun makes it all glow?
kind of day that makes you glad to be alive.
why are you keepin' me here?
I see no locked doors.
well, they were after me.
ooo, sounds terribly ominous.
why am i here?
it has nothing to do with me--any of this.
I've seen you before.
Really?
what were you doing in the mountains, six?
I was-I was, uh, lost.
I mean, I have no idea how I got here.
I
what did you call me?
This--look, something's wrong here.
Yes!
you are wrong, six.
do not call me that--I am not six.
show me your ID papers.
well, I don't have any papers...
well, you just put them there.
you were seen in the mountains.
what have you done with 93?
I don't know anything about 93.
where is the old man?
you can't do this to me!
I don't care who you are-- do you hear me!
now, I wanna get back to New York.
well, that's not possible
there is no New York
there's only the village.
look, we've been here before.
it all feels too familiar
I know that.
truly, we live for today.
this is my home?
we must be doing something right.
no, I mean...
you can't escape it.
my apartment in
done in your other life.
this is where you belong.
we interrupt this programming for the following public
will you just, uh, sign this to say that everything's in order?
I'm signin' nothin', pal.
the palais today identified the missing villager as 93, a man in his late 70's, last seen heading north into the desert two nights ago.
93 is well known to hospital staff following a history of stage seven mental unwellness.
he also suffers from shortness of breath, dizzy spells and a weak heart.
but we wish him well and hope to report his discovery eminently...
if not sooner.
what can i do you for?
I'd like to buy a map.
Hmm...Street or topographic?
biggest one you got.
that's the biggest?
pull her out.
that's it!
buy one, get one free.
what the hell would i want with two maps?
makes a perfect gift.
big enough for ya?
here we are...
you are here.
that's the palais two.
wow" being the appropriate word.
and that's the clinic and
Where's the road outta here?
Ohh--you crack me up, six.
you've not seen me before.
no, sir.
you, I would remember.
but you know my
welcome to the village.
everybody knows everybody!
be seein' ya!
six!
six, wait!
why are you calling me that?
well, I think that it suits you.
six...
hmm, i like it.
six, where do you think you're going?
goin' home.
you won't get far.
is there nothing can say that will make you wait?
you can tell me the truth.
what the hell is this place?
you're one of us.
that's the truth.
Wha--hey! Aw, man, not my car--come on!
do you think I could use your phone?
mine's just been stolen.
Yeah. Go ahead.
actually, I lied. I lost it.
I'm always losing my phone.
I hate leaving messages--don't you?
I noticed you,'cause you look like you're waiting for someone.
maybe, I am.
who you waitin' for?
don't answer that.
I'm late...Again.
traffic the same on the G. W. as the jersey turnpike.
it's hell on four wheels out there.
so, if you want my advice
get off your butt and walk!
total gridlock from some kind of gas explosion in the heart of brooklyn.
you got my phone.
um, I'd say,"sorry" but I promised myself I'd stop apologizing to men.
having a party?
Yeah, you wanna come?
can't make it tonight.
Oh...There's no party, anyway.
Ah, just what I thought..."drinking alone.
I'm celebrating.
Oh, yeah--what?
you were talking to someone.
you shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.
it's rude.
how come you're interested in my life back there, if it doesn't exist?
of course, I'm interested.
I want to help you with these delusions.
I can't leave here, can I?
why would you want to leave?
why would you even think such a thing?
all right, doctor.
my delusion is, I met a woman the other night...
and I invited her back to my apartment.
did she come back to your apartment?
I don't know.
I don't know.
what's that?
I haven't opened it, yet.
it's from the clinic.
what's it say?
we've been summoned, to the clinic.
what for?
an appointment, with two.
Oh, dear!
it says someone else here at the bottom.
so, this guy at the hospital.
he wants to know where 93's body is.
Why? That's not a delusion.
that's happening here, right now.
if you did see 93.
is that why they set me free, to let you loose on me?
the caring, sharing doctor, with the big beautiful eyes and the nice, girly smile.
soften me up--get me to talk?
of course, you doubt me.
you doubt everything, but that's not you speaking, six.
that's your condition.
my condition is that i'm being held here against my will.
cabins 29 to 63.
yellow district
cabins 309 to 357.
green district--apartments 51 to 299.
can you see, six, how I might wonder why you are here, if, as you claim,"you know nothing about 93?
I came here to find out who this man, 93, is.
now that you're here...
do you see what he was?
a drunk.
a fool.
maybe he drank, because he found the lie of this place unbearable.
he knew what I know.
the village is not all that there is.
what is it you're suggesting?
a hole in the sky, aliens landing secretly in the night, mysterious roads that lead beyond, beyond, beyond.
a magic gateway, perhaps? Some portal leading into "never-never land.
take a look outside, six.
people going about their lives, strolling in the sun, sitting together in the park, or anywhere where they might choose to sit together.
they take a scooter ride, go dancing, enjoy a beer in the cafe, while they gaze about the village.
contented.
hopeful.
every day above ground is a good day.
the problem is in your mind.
well...
I want out.
you've tried that! There is no "out.
there is only "in.
now, you can go on tormenting yourself, if that's what you want, or you can stop.
if 93 were no more than a drunk, a fool, as you say, then why were they chasing after him?
shooting at him?
because 93 found something, and if he can do it, I can.
I pity you, six.
you refuse to open your mind to the possibility that you're wrong.
if I open my mind, you'll take it away from me.
we might...
but we will always give it back.
did 93 show you this--I need to know.
did he talk to you about this?
are there other drawings?
554, please.
93 must've trusted you.
there has to be a reason he told me to come to you.
what is this--what does this do?
I'm going to meet my boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
please, help me.
please.
93 said,"the drawings were from his other life...
before the village.
that's all I know.
you have to leave me alone, now.
and you are here to receive a medal for services to the village, and you should keep the medal with you, at all times.
and when you met number six, what did you make of him?
he was a little strange.
A-a-actually
Nope.
number six has been dealt with, so he is no longer a worry to us.
and there was another thing, in the summons.
uh, yeah, it said, uh,"to bring cake, with cherries in it.
did you?
uh, yeah-- yeah.
Oh, no
leave it there.
my dear villagers, perhaps two could interrupt your day in the sun to relate the grave news that we have discovered number 93's body in the mountains.
sadly, the old man had succumbed to a weak heart.
he spoke briefly to emergency staff, before dying on route to the hospital.
his last words were to honor the village, and request the anthem be sung in his name.
if you tell me what you know, i promise you, i won't come back.
breathe in, breath out...
village life goes on.
do you want, uh, something to drink?
93 was convinced that his dreams meant that he had another life, before this one.
he started saying things that we're prisoners here.
prisoners?
I've said too much. I-I don't even know who you are.
it's okay
you can trust me.
I am not one of them.
I dream this, all the time. What is it?
this is more real, than anything out there.
this is the first bit of hope i've been given, since I got here.
if there are others like us, who dream, and they got to thinking that 93 escaped, then
do you think there are others?
do you?
are you for real?
I promise you
you're safe with me.
I'll see you at the cafe tomorrow.
what is it, 11-12?
why is six so convinced there is another place?
because for people like six, life is not enough.
the simple life...
they want to escape it.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I'm trying to find out what you're doin' here.
do something for me, will ya?
lie down beside me.
uh, you're supposed to be trying to convince me you're sane.
come on.
uh, okay.
right.
a hundred billion stars, over and over billions of galaxies, and that's just what we can see.
can you honestly tell me that the village is all that there is?
of course not.
has to be life out there somewhere.
perhaps, another village.
Oh, it's, um, 400 billion, by the way.
look at me.
isaac newton, galileo, plato, socrates, karl marx, groucho marx, darwin
surely, Darwin.
kennedy, bob dylan, david beckam.
who invented the telephone?
Oh, uh, uh...
alexander Graham bell--the light bulb?
512. - everyone says it was Thomas Edison.
it was Joseph Swan. Where do these names come from--these memories?
I was taught this stuff by a lady named Mrs. Radcliff, my teacher.
now, where does that come from? - Now, tell me about mrs. Radcliff.
you're humoring me.
tell me, anyway.
okay, she had a big blue nose, skin like a crocodile.
she actually looked more like a man in a dress.
not just a man, but a boxer.
I like her, already.
do you know what a crocodile is?
are you trying to trap me?
yes
no.
Yes.
are you trying to trap me? - yes yes No.
tell me about the woman.
I resigned today.
Oh, that's why you're celebrating.
alone.
too bad.
um, I go this way.
Really?
really.
uh, what's your name?
well, I'd like to get to know you, lucy.
well, maybe you can.
well, I'd like to get to know you, tonight.
well, maybe you can. Maybe, you can.
what's goin' on?
you know what it is, six.
93 deserves a decent burial.
you didn't find his body.
93 is gone
escaped.
found the way out.
if 93 found the way out, six can convince himself that there is an out.
six must try to escape, because six knows, there is nothing to escape from.
in his mind, in is soul, six knows that six is six.
Hey, man--need a cab?
why would I need a cab, if I'm going into a cafe?
well, you know, people who go into cafes, come outta cafes, and sometimes, they might need a cab.
well, I don't know, if I'll need a cab.
why you hassling me, anyway?- Hey, six...I like ya
you're a likable man.
and I like giving rides in my cab to people I like.
sometimes, being nice is, uh, well, it's just being nice.
I'll always be here, if you need me.
Thanks.
if you're crawling through traffic, hoping to escape for the weekend, think hard, my friends.
did you hear that? - It's the same on the G. W.
it's hell on four wheels out there.
Oh, gridlock, after some kind of gas explosion, in the heart of brooklyn.
put a pillow on his face.
snuffed him out like a
snuffed him out like a candle.
Now-now, he's dead.
need some help here!
Hey.
I'm glad I met you, six.
I'm glad I told you.
perhaps, we can escape together.
when you're better.
you can tell a lot about a person from their apartment.
if you know how to look.
here's to forgetting.
some things.
don't you recognize your brother?
six?
he's not my brother.
why would a man deny the existence of his own brother, when he's standing right in front of you?
because he's sick, demented.
isn't that what you want me to think?
let us concern ourselves only with evidence.
brought these from home.
remember that?
stuff could be fake.
and does your flesh also lie, six?
you fell out of a tree and cut your arm.
you could have done it, while i was sleeping.
buddy, we-we just want you back, the way you were.
you're not gonna catch anything. - Yes, I will-- I did last week.
perhaps therapy might work, yes?
what do you say, six?
give the talking cure a try.
Oh, you would like that, wouldn't you?
meddling with my mind.
what are you afraid of, six?
a glimpse into your psyche, discovering that you are the problem, after all?
I'm not afraid.
come on!
good-- the sessions are booked.
a man with nothing to hide, is a man with nothing to find.
harmony - Good to see you, six. - Home at last.
Hey, look who it is.
Hey, uncle six-- your not dead.
Hey, good evening. - Oh, it's good to see you.
Hey, dad-- - I've made your favorite for dinner.
barbeque pork wraps.
it's "wonkers!
Ah, see, we never miss "wonkers.
Yes.
Oops, here we go.
I don't like pork.
Oh, go on-- it's your favorite.
there is something.
okay, so, 765 is in love with 23-30, but 23-56 is pregnant to 46-5, and 913 had an affair with 23-30.
so, 765 is jealous of 23-30, and so she, like, took her revenge by sleeping with 46-5.
46-5-- - yes.
I'm leaving you. - No
Yes. - Oh, no! Why?
I love your brother.
you have a lovely family.
I know it...
and I'm proud of it.
but it's not real, is it?
and i'm not your brother.
my brother's dead, and I'm somebody else.
six, it kills me to see you like this
did you take anything? - What?
papers from my pocket?
no.
cause maybe you work for them.
I don't know.
I only know that none of this is real.
if you won't go to your therapy, then, I will.
I have to, because let me tell you, i just want my brother back.
and it just kills me to
why is it so dark in here?
why does it feel so dark to you?
well, my home is not my home.
my brother's not my brother.
nothing's real.
and what feels real to you, six?
why should I tell you?
because it bothers you...
doesn't it?
you can't cure your thinking with your thinking, six.
you have to hand it over.
there is something in you, which you feel the need to find.
you feel the need to resolve it.
am I right?
let me tell you something interesting.
numbers on a phone, how they work.
they have a logic, a purpose.
I get the feeling this is not merely information.
when you borrowed my phone, the number you dialed, it wasn't a number.
that's pretty observant.
what kind of a guy notices stuff like that?
just someone suspicious.
you didn't make a call.
there was something came into your head?
I saw a seagull this morning.
some kind of bird?
Yeah, that's right, some kind of bird.
and I got to thinking... "either you're a long way from home, "or we're a lot closer to the beach, then I realized.
and what is "the beach?
that's where you go on vacation.
tell us about youracation.
not much to tell.
me and my brother, we'd take the train to the sea.
we called it "the edge of the world.
giant salt water rod for him.
an old fishing net for me.
wait a minute
did you say "us?
who's "us?
he is me...
we are me.
I find it conducive to work in this way.
I can engage.
and I can reflect.
I think we're done here.
six, wait!
there's no requirement that you share your thoughts here with me-- us.
simply to have them.
six!
six, wait!
I met your brother. Seems like a sweet man.
he spies a lot.
I mean-I mean, I think he's a worrier, and I think he's worried about you, six
he's not my brother.
six, maybe you could just accept the possibility that he is
listen to me--I am not a number.
right.
there was something in my pockets.
did you take it?
no, there was nothing in your pockets, six.
six, there you are.
I was thinking,"what is the one thing "that helps a man not dwell on his troubles?
work-- huh? Come on
let's go see the guys.
Hey, 130.
look who's here.
he's lost some weight, don't you think, boys?
looks to me like a man who needs a beer or 12.
we'll take you out with the boys tonight, six.
put some flesh on them bones, huh?
how do you fancy getting behind the old wheel?
why do you think I can drive this thing?
you're the best there is, six.
but I've never driven a bus in my life.
listen to him, boys.
how 'bout you just get behind the wheel, and see if it all comes back to ya, huh?
fire her up.
Ah, as sweet as a honey nut wrap.
the village tour will depart in approximately one minute and 20 seconds.
see the sights!
if you've already seen them, see them again.
see ya-- bye.
your driver today, my buddy and my brother, number six.
coming up here, on your left, is the village museum of modern art, containing the famous painting of crying 38-30, by 794.
and then, coming up, one of the highlights of our tour, the clinic.
every day is a sunny day in the village.
moving on now, over to the corner, the newly rebuilt "solar cafe.
you were right, of course.
he is resistant to the possibility of revealing the six inside.
and why is that?
he feels alone.
Oh! Very good.
he dreams of escape.
he feels rootless.
and yet, his roots are right here, under our feet.
what ails the man?
he described...
a fishing trip.
fishing? We like six's fishing stories, don't we, 70?
some kind of fantasy.
perhaps you'd do better trying to find the two inside.
why not, since I'm here.
we can have a poke around.
see what makes two tick.
the inside two.
I'm curious.
I want to know what's going on inside of me.
let's start...
my wife...
I'm the reason she's the way she is.
perhaps we should stay with the matter of six.
I know I can trust you.
I love my son.
but, I have thoughts, if he knew me, if he truly know his father, he might not like me.
do you like me, 70?
you are two-- we all love you.
but, do you like me?
I don't really know you.
I-- what I do know is that you are a wonderful man.
of course.
you think I believe all of this therapy babble, do you?
my mother sat me sideways on the potty when I was a toddler, now I want to sleep with her?
Oh, grow up, man!
have you had sex with your mother, 70?
no-- never.
well, don't.
two, if i might ask, if you don't believe in the value of the talking cure
it's not necessary for me to believe.
it is necessary for six to believe.
the sight to delights just don't stop, folks.
actually, this is one of my favorite parts of the trip, the desert.
my kids, they always say to me,"dad, what's beyond the desert?
and I tell 'em,"more desert.
around every dune, there's another dune, right?
in a few moments, we're gonna be pulling up for some light refreshments.
91 will be coming around with, uh, some delicious wraps.
and remember, take out your cameras.
this is one of the best views of the towers.
where are you going?
there's something i wanna see.
Ah, a very slight detour
no cause for alarm.
okay, everyone, this is an unscheduled stop.
can you see it on the map?
who can tell me what it is?
some kind of bus that broke down?
Ah, not even close.
what are you doing?
it's an anchor.
which means, somewhere around here is a boat, yeah, or a ship.
a ship means water, and water means ocean, right?
what does ocean say to you
uh, this is what's known as a desert folly, which means it's a nothing.
no, it's not-- it means escape.
yeah?
come on.
something I wanna show you.
what is this place?
it's the ruins.
were there ever trains?
I don't get you, six.
it's the ruins
it's the same as it's always been.
we came here every day, when we were kids.
we played soldiers, and hide-and-seek.
we used to call it the "edge of the world," remember?
how can you forget that?
guess I do feel something, being here.
I can't-I can't deny it.
but, why?
why should I feel belonging, when I've never been here before?
try to ask yourself, do you really think that whole family, those kids, are living their lives just to deceive you?
maybe.
if you're right, there's no way out of here, then.
can't we have life here?
isn't that something?
two people, like your brother, his family
no-no-no-no-no.
that's what they want us to think.
313, you ever been on a boat?
why would I?
you don't know what you're missing.
I noticed you, sitting on your own.
I decided that if I spoke to you, you might wanna get to know me.
is that so bad?
why tonight?
why choose the day that i resign?
well, maybe, it's a coincidence.
do you know the way?
every day is a sunny day.
it's "wonkers!
life is short.
it's the same thing, over and over, day in and day out.
it's like we can never escape.
I'm 16, your guide.
you driver today, my buddy and brother, number six.
coming up here, on your left, is the village philharmonic hall.
and then, coming up, one of the highlights of the tour...
the clinic.
and next, today, especially for you, the home of our great patron.
the one, the only, home of you know who, palais two.
wow," being the operative word here.
wouldn't it be amazing if two came out right now?
Oh, he
much bigger than on TV.
he's coming.
it's good to see you looking so much better, six.
driving your bus around, spending time with your brother.
family is the greatest gift the village can give us.
isn't that right? Hmm.
perhaps one day, you will have a son, six.
I recommend it.
it's only when you have family, that you learn the meaning of love.
Oh, do sit down.
are we enjoying our little sight seeing trip?
wonderful. - Good.
and what do you think of your driver?
there, good news.
one family, here on this bus, has won a holiday, to the escape resort.
I have the ticket here.
and the lucky family is 16. - yes!
I've always wanted to go to escape resort.
can't wait to tell the kids.
Fantastic-- thank you.
and that wraps up our tour for today.
I bet you're all ready for a beer, or 12.
escape resort.
you're gonna come with us, aren't you, six?
this resort, is it by the sea?
a sea?
Yeah, you know, the sea, the ocean, water, waves.
what do you mean, the pool?
you gotta come, six.
come away with me.
life is short.
so come away.
you'd never escape the guilt.
913 wouldn't care.
you would break 46-5's heart.
his wife and his own brother.
I can't let you go.
you took them.
no, I found them in your pocket.
you fool around with me like everything's a joke.
what do you-you report on me?
tell 'em what i say to you?
why'd you take them?
I like them.
I like the idea of another place.
I'm sorry, I-I don't wanna lose you...
lose our friendship.
I was being stupid, and look, it won't happen again.
I lied to you.
you really are suspicious of people, aren't you?
you would be too if you worked there.
you haven't told me where you work.
I am
I was an analyst for a company called "semicorp.
we collect c. C. Tv footage from around the world.
I watch people, I see things.
I collect data and statistics.
my job is to look for patterns, how we live.
trying to find out what is going on, and finding out what is going on is not good news.
is that why you resigned?
why do you ask?
well, why shouldn't i be interested in you?
sorry, it's what that place does to you.
what you need is a distraction.
you know, i watch people like us, doing things like this, and i write about them in my reports.
so, if you were watching us now, what would you see?
two people, a man and a woman in a room, for one night, 'cause that's all they're capable of anymore.
please, tell me that is not true.
it's only a report
it's what you believe.
it's what i see.
it's ridiculous, I know, but...
I've been lying awake, thinking, "maybe if i came down, they wouldn't be here.
you loved that thing.
you always say that.
I don't remember it at all.
memory is fickle.
six says that everything here is fake, unreal.
it's not possible.
I mean, why would the world be like that?
it is like that, in six's mind.
look at me, 11-12.
is this real?
do I love you like no father ever loved a son before?
when I was your age, I questioned everything.
young men always doubt, challenge, but never doubt your family.
never.
Steven, come back.
something happened, in you...
a memory.
your fishing trip, perhaps.
your brother?
do you think it would help me to tell you?
I know it would.
765 is in love with 23-30.
23-56 is pregnant to 46-59.
913 had an affair with 23-30, so 765 is jealous of 23-30, so she
he's running rings around us!
I see your fear, 70.
I've been watching you.
you know you're a prisoner-- you're just like me.
but you don't wanna know.
well, I refuse to become you.
I do remember something about this place.
like something happened here.
doesn't that make it true?
they do it to me somehow.
they do it to all of us.
one, two...
three, four, five...
six.
hello to you, who-whoever you are.
I'm six.
I'm eight years old.
you sound like such a clever, little six.
it's a trick.
you knew where it was
you went straight to it.
it has to be a trick.
has to be.
tell me why you resigned, please?
I worked on a floor called "analysis.
we don't know who works on the next floor.
we never see them.
I started to notice something, and like a good boy, I reported up.
and what was it?
people changing.
too many people.
so I sent in the report, got a three-word reply.
cease and desist.
but if you could find out why "solutions" wanted you to stop.
who are you?
you work in "semicorp," you said "solutions.
I didn't say,"solutions.
no more bullshit-- who are you?
Yes, I-I work there.
you sit there, you look at me, and you tell me why you're here?
you think you resigned
maybe you did, but it's not over.
they still control you.
I'm, uh, going on vacation with my brother tomorrow.
you called him your brother.
do you see?
I see I need to get out of here, before I become a part of this place.
I, uh, be seeing ya.
there's a reason I go on those bus trips.
I heard the ocean once.
they stopped the bus.
I kind of wandered off away.
I heard waves crashing.
I heard the ocean.
you know, I'm all for a wild goose chase.
I'm an affirmative kind of guy, generally speaking, but,"i can hear big water?
somewhere, there's a sound of splashing? " please.
you mind if we just shut up and drive, please?
sounds good.
it's non-stop to the escape resort, departing in approximately four and half minutes.
where is he? - I don't know.
she's a crazy, six.
man, we are right where we were, and we were here, even before that
and we are right here, again.
maybe it was an illusion.
maybe I never heard it.
listen to me, you did hear something.
you have to keep believing that you heard it.
I wish I could.
I wish I could hear it now.
try. Listen.
follow the towers.
two put you up to this, didn't he?
what?
all this talk of the ocean-- yes, he did.
he wants to throw me off track.
we're going on a trip - no-no-no, it's today!
where you going, man?
my family!
I knew you wouldn't let us down.
I told them-- didn't I tell ya?
six never missed a vacation in his life.
come on, what are we waiting for?
all right, everyone, we're all gonna have a nice, normal vacation.
you can't get to the towers
it's not possible.
you know that, six.
do you know the way?
you hear me?
you gotta cut this out!
you gotta stop this!
I found something the monster wants.
something of mine from when I was a boy.
I keep trying to prove I'm right, find a way out.
but what if I am wrong?
what if I am your brother?
all you've given me is love and kindness.
I've repaid you with cruel accusations.
maybe I am insane.
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you.
you're a good man.
I do trust you.
hey...
I'm glad I have a brother.
six...
I'm not your brother.
I'm sorry!
please, you've gotta help me, now!
you've gotta help me.
I'm sorry.
I try to be a good father.
you know, give them mething good to look back on.
this place, it's what you dream of.
for a guy like me, it's out of reach.
I'm scared of them, six.
they're watching us all the time.
look at me, I'm shaking like a leaf.
look, I need a beer.
what is it they want from me?
they must have told you something.
my head is so confused with confusion.
I-I don't even know if what i just told you is true or not.
the other place.
something about you talking about some other place.
are they really your family?
I don't even know anymore.
I know it sounds stupid, but, I sort of do think of you as my brother.
me, too.
six, is there another place?
there is.
you gotta help me get out there.
they will get me
they're gonna get me.
no, we'll get out first.
it isn't there, is it?
two will know we were out here.
he'll know that i betrayed him.
I promise you, we'll find it.
Steven, come back.
16, come back.
I'm only just getting started
come on!
come back here!
I have to tell you something.
shh, uncle six-- "wonkers" is on.
your father
your father's dead!
he drowned.
Yeah, well, 11-12, none of us can choose our family.
he swam in the ocean.
taste the saltwater in his mouth.
felt the power of the waves.
there is a way out of this place.
no matter how loudly you shout that there isn't!
you're the one who's shouting, six.
the louder a man shouts, the more profoundly he's wrong.
I'm not wrong.
I'm telling you the truth.
my brother is dead.
six.
saying these things about his brother
it hurts.
only a family can heal.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean "my brother.
six-- oh, six.
I am not a number
I am not a number.
I am- I am
Yes, six.
my name is-- damn it!
my name is
I am six he's six.
I am six!
that's right.
I am six
I am six, you bastard!

you will get the worst reviews You ever read
good luck.
on the opening night They are scared "Bonne chance, mes amis" No one says - The only word you'll ever hear is - Merde
good luck, good luck, good luck.
it's verboten Wishing luck on opening night
Tak e advice Don't think twice
or your show will surely end up In the Scheiss
at the famous La Scala in Milan
on opening night it's a rule
and just for luck they all shout - "Vaffanculo" - I got it
now I'll never say "good luck" On opening night
that's the rule I'm no fool
what do I say, I beg?
what you say is "break a leg
break a leg? - Yeah.
break a leg. - Break a leg.
if you're clever
good luck.
you'll endeavour
to never, never, never, never Ever, ever, ever say
on opening night
five minutes to curtain. Curtain going up in five minutes.
I'm late. I must run!
break a leg! - Break a leg!
franz, what happened?
I broke my leg.
now we'll have to cancel the show and give everyone their money back.
money back?
money back?
money back.
don't ever say that again. Money back?
never. We gotta think of something else.
but Franz plays Hitler, Max, and he has no understudy.
you're right. What are we gonna do? There must be a way out.
if I could only think of something. Some way. Some...
hold it. I got it. Roger, you. You could play Hitler.
you know every line in the show.
I've seen you at rehearsal, always moving your lips along with the actors.
it's an embarrassing habit. I'm trying to break myself of it.
but me play Hitler? No! There's no way I could go on tonight.
I don't have the strength. I don't have the courage.
I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it!
wow, that hurt. - Roger.
listen to me.
you can do it.
you know you can do it, and I know you can do it.
you've been waiting all your lifetime for this chance.
and I'm not gonna let you pass it up.
you're going out there a silly, hysterical, screaming queen.
but you're coming back a great big...
...passing-for-straight Broadway star.
all right. You're right.
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!
I've got to get into makeup. Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.
and, oh! My lucky Gloria Swanson mole.
got it!
Leo, the overture.
let's go.
Max. - What?
this is it!
good luck, Leo. - Good luck, Max.

Roger!
a satiric masterpiece.
no way out.
a surprise smash.
no way out.
it was shocking, outrageous, insulting...
...and I loved every minute of it.
no way out!
how could this happen?
we picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast.
where did we go right?
Congratulations.
what are you doing? - I'm taking these books...
...and I'm leaving.
don't try and stop me. I've made up my mind.
wait. Where do you think you're going?
I'm turning myself in. It's the only way.
I'm going to play ball with the IRS.
I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.
they'll reduce my sentence, there's time off for good behaviour.
maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.
please keep in touch. It's been very nice working with you.
Leo. Leo. Leo.
frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.
take it easy, all right?
you're overwrought. You don't know what you're doing.
you're acting out of panic.
give me those frigging books! Give me!
give me! Give me! Give me! - I never should've listened to you.
I was an honest man before I met you.
an honest man? You were an honest mouse!
give me. Give me. - How I hate you!
double! Double! Double!
fat! Fat!
I'm not that fat.
fat!
fat!
fatty!
fatso! You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.
give me the fat books!
never, never! - Fat, fat, fatty, fat!
Oh, Jesus! - Give them to me!
give me the books!
Congratulations! - Congratulations!
give it to me! Give it to me! - No! No!
give it to me! Give it to me! - No! No!
now, that's what I call celebrating.
you. You lousy fruit.
you ruined me. - You ungrateful breeder.
after he stepped in and saved your little show, I cannot... My chains!
leave him alone! - My Italian chains! My chains!
you have broken the Siegfried Oath.
you must die. You all must die!
what are you doing, you neo- Nazi nitwit?
your show's a hit. - Who cares?
you made a fool out of Hitler.
he didn't need our help. - He didn't need our help.
stand still! How can I shoot you if you keep moving?
get back here!
under the desk! Under the desk!
darling, quick, back in the closet. - Okay.
this is no good.
I'm not killing anybody.
you must cooperate!
all right, Bialystock und Bloom.
now I got you.
say your prayers!
remember I'd tell you when we're in too deep?
yeah? - We're in too deep.
franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!
Oh, no, no.
you snivelling cowards!
cringing under a desk?
clinging to life like baby butterflies.
franz Liebkind will show you how to die like a man!
jammed. Boy, when things go wrong...
that's it. Next time, no author.
what are you shooting at us for anyway?
you Teutonic twit!
wait. Wait a minute.
I just got an idea.
a way to close the show.
franz, l...
there, there. - Where? Where?
franz, listen to me.
why don't you use this where it'll do some good.
why don't you shoot the actors. - The actors?
Yes, the actors.
because of the actors. The actors were making fun of him.
Yeah, you're right, the actors!
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.
kill. Kill all the actors. - I must kill all the actors.
wait a minute!
what are you talking about?
what do you mean, " kill the actors"? You can't kill the actors.
actors are not animals. They're human beings.
they are? Have you ever eaten with one?
here. Listen... - Open up, it's the police!
the police! - The police!
come on, boys.
I was never a member of the Nazi Party. I had nothing...
you, drop that gun.
Ociffers! - What's going on here?
this crazy Kraut is crackers!
he crashed in here and crassly tried to kill us.
Oh, Roger, what alliteration. - Thank you, darling.
okay, youse two can go.
thank you. - Thank you.
tried to kill him, eh?
officer O'Rourke, take this man in.
next stop, Sing Sing.
sing Sing? You'll never take me alive!
what happened? - I broke my other leg.
all right, who are you, and why was he trying to shoot you?
I haven't the slightest idea, Sergeant O'Toole.
the name is O'Bialystock.
I was just passing by on my way to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...
...and I ducked in to see what the hell was going on.
and now I'll be on my way, before me voice gets any higher.
as we say in the old country, "Taxi!
hold it!
Hey, sarge, look at this.
what? - I found these two accounting books.
this one says, "Show to the IRS." - And what's the other one say?
never show to the IRS.
I think the three of you better come downtown with me.
three? - Yeah, you and them two books.
Mr. Bialystock?
Mr. Bloom?
where are you?
everyone is waiting for you at the opening-night party.
Ulla, help me.
what happened to you?
I know.
you hung up your coat while you were still in it.
thank you for helping me down.
what were you doing up there?
hiding.
I was hiding.
from who? From what?
from the police.
they were just here. They've arrested Max.
they found the books? - I don't know what to do.
poor Max.
maybe I should turn myself in and go to jail with him.
well, my sweet cupcake, I know we both love Max...
...but it seems to me you have two choices.
number one, you can go to jail with Mr. Bialystock...
...for years and years and years.
or number two...
...you can take that 2 million dollars and Ulla, and go to Rio.
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.
Oh, what should I do?
should I go to jail or go to Rio?
mail call.
Hey, fatso.
I'm not that fat!
says you.
you got a postcard.
a postcard? From where?
brazil.
brazil.
who do I know in Brazil?
why am I asking you?
dear Max, Rio is everything you said it was and more.
Ulla and I think of you every chance we get.
in the morning, when we have breakfast on our terrace...
... many different herrings.
and then, in the evening, when we samba together in the moonlight.
you'll find your happiness in Rio
the beaches there Are strewn with pearls
the tropic breezes Always blow there
and so, we hear do the girls "Sorry, must run. Ulla's waiting.
it's almost 11.
wish you were here.
your pal, Leo.
just like Cain and Abel
you pulled a sneak attack
I thought that we were brothers
then you stabbed me in the back
betrayed
Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed
lik e Samson and Delilah Your love began to fade
I'm crying in the hoosegow You're in Rio getting laid
betrayed
let's face it, I'm betrayed
boy, have I been tak en
oy, I'm so forsaken
I should have seen What came to pass
I should have known To watch my ass
I feel like Othello Everything is lost
Leo is lago
Max is double-crossed
I'm so dismayed
did I mention I'm betrayed?
now I'm about to go to jail There's no one who will pay my bail
I have no one who I can cry to No one I can say goodbye to
I'm drowning!
I'm drowning!
I'm drowning here!
I'm going down for the last time.
I can see my whole life flashing before my eyes.
I see a weathered old farmhouse with a white picket fence.
I'm running through fields of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.
no, Rex, not on the alfalfa.
and I see my mother.
I see Mama standing on the back porch...
...in a worn but clean gingham gown.
and I hear my mama calling out to me.
Alvin!
don't forget your chores.
the wood needs a-cording and the cows need a-milking.
Alvin! Alvin!
wait a minute.
my name's not Alvin.
that's not my life.
somebody else's life is flashing before my eyes.
what the hell is that about?
I'm not a hillbilly. I grew up in the Bronx.
Leo's taken everything, even my past.
my past's a dying ember
but wait, now I remember
how did it begin? He walked into my office
with his cockamamie scheme
you can mak e more money with a flop than with a hit
we can do it We can do it
I can't do it We can do it
I can't do it Goodbye, Max
Lord, I want that money I'm back, Max
come on, Leo, we can do it
step one, find the play
see it, smell it, touch it, kiss it Hello, Mr. Liebkind
Guten Tag hop hop Guten Tag clop clop
Adolf Elizabeth Hitler?
Guten Tag hop hop Guten Tag clop clop
step two, hire the director Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it...
two, three, kick, Turn, turn, turn, kick, turn
Ulla
step three, raise the money
along came Bialy
step four, hire all the actors
a wandering minstrel I A thing of shreds and...
next The little wooden boy
next That's our Hitler
break a leg I broke my leg
springtime for Hitler and Germany
a surprise smash Springtime for Hitler and Germany
it'll run for years! Where did we go right?
where did we go right?
give me those books Fat, fat, fatty
give me those books Fat, fat, fatty
books, fat, books, fat Books, fat, books, fat
lousy fruit Kill the actors
you ever eat with one?
then you ran to Rio And you're safely out of reach
I'm behind these bars
you're banging Ulla on the beach
just like Julius Caesar
was betrayed by Brutus
who'd think an accountant Would turn out to be my Judas
I'm so dismayed
is this how I'm repaid?
betrayed
gentlemen of the jury, have you reached your verdict?
Yes, Your Honour, we have.
we find the defendant incredibly guilty.
hold me, touch me.
I'm a little busy.
does the defendant have anything to say on his own behalf?
Yes, Your Honour, I do.
but I had no choice.
I was a Broadway producer.
a man without a conscience...
...and with no one who gave a damn about him.
and that, Your Honour, is what hurts the most.
I thought I'd at last found a loyal partner.
a man I cared about...
...and who I thought cared about me.
what breaks my heart is now...
...when I need him most, he's deserted me.
I will probably never see or hear from him ever again.
that's not true!
order! Order in the court!
and stop that samba!
who are you? - I am Leopold Bloom...
...Max Bialystock's partner.
and who are you, my dear?
my name is Ulla Inga Hansen Benson...
...Yonsen Tallen- Hallen Svaden Svanson Bloom.
Bloom?
you're his wife? - Ja, Your Honour.
he wouldn't do it unless we got married.
what a schmuck.
now, Mr. Bloom, why in the world would you...
...want to come back here and give yourself up?
Why? To speak on his behalf.
we all know that Max Bialystock is a lying, double- crossing...
...two-faced, slimy, manipulative, underhanded...
please...
...don't help me.
your Honour... Your honour, if I may address the court.
the law was created to protect people from being wronged.
so whom has Max Bialystock wronged?
well, not these dear ladies. - No.
and not me, not...
not me.
I was this nobody.
no one ever called me " Leo" before.
I mean, Your Honour, I know it isn't a big legal point...
...but even when I was in kindergarten everybody always called me " Bloom.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that even when I was in Rio...
...and had everything I'd ever dreamed of...
...I suddenly realized that...
that this man...
this man...
no one ever made me feel like someone
till him
life was really nothing But a glum one
till him
my existence bordered on the tragic
always timid Never took a chance
then I felt his magic
and my heart began to dance
I was always frightened Fraught with worry
till him
I was going nowhere in a hurry
till him
he filled up my empty life
filled it to the brim
there could never ever be another one
like him
Leo...
Leo...
...I never realized.
you're a good singer. - Thank you.
no, really, like a professional. - Well, I sang it for you, Max.
I sang it because I'm your friend.
you are?
I've had a lot of relationships...
...but you couldn't call any of them "friend.
but come to think of it...
...no one ever, ever really knew me.
till him
everyone was always out to screw me
till him
never met a man I ever trusted
always dealt with shysters In the past
now I'm well-adjusted 'Cause I've got a friend at last
don't help me.
always playing singles Never doubles
till him
never had a pal To share my troubles
till him
he filled up my empty life - Filled it to the brim - Filled it to the brim
there could never ever be
another one
like him
gentlemen, it breaks my heart...
...to break up such a beautiful friendship.
so I won't.
five years in the state penitentiary at Sing Sing.
gotta sing, sing
gotta sing, sing
Oh, you can lock us up
and lose the key

Leo and Max
up off our backs
back on the Great White Way
Leo and Max
back on our tracks
we're back on top to stay
so when we take your money Never fear
we'll knock Broadway Right on its ear
the cast is great The script is swell
but this we're telling you, sirs
it's just no go You've got no show
without the producers
we'll never quit
hit after hit
the producers Leo and Max
the overture is over
the curtain starts to rise
you're suddenly in clover
you can't believe your eyes
you're sitting on the aisle
you break into a smile
why this magic feeling?
and then you realize
that there is
nothing lik e a show on Broadway
nothing lik e a Broadway show
hearts will skip a beat on Broadway
if you're feeling blue I'm telling you
that's the place to go
movies drag Their endings sag
TV's just a bore
so hit the street And move your feet
to the place we all adore
because there's nothing Lik e a show on Broadway
there's nothing Lik e a Broadway show
it's often been said The theatre is dead
the critics repeat it en masse
but the theatre's alive It's gonna survive
although it's a pain in the ass
you waited forever And finally got tickets
to get to your seat You gotta cross pickets
the guy to your right Is frightfully tight
the guy to your left appears to have rickets
the music's yuck The lyrics suck
the casting is all wrong
and when you reach the bathroom
the line is five miles long
but still there's nothing Lik e a show on Broadway
there's nothing Lik e a Broadway show
you swear you'll never go again
it's simply not worthwhile
you make that vow And then somehow - You're back there on the aisle - You're back there on the aisle
that's why there's
nothing lik e a show On Broadway
there's nothing Lik e a Broadway show
till you're in movies
there's nothing Lik e a Broadway show
and though it is expensive at a hundred bucks a throw
there's nothing
lik e a Broadway show!
thanks for coming to see our show
sad to tell you we got to go
grab your hat and head for the door
the victim -- Colleen Emily Watkins. 32.
how many times was she stabbed? Four or five.
there's some defensive cuts on her hands and arms.
neighbor saw the door ajar this morning, called 911.
her skin color, dried blood -- I'm figuring she died sometime last night, and I didn't see any pry marks on the door, so no forced entry.
Yeah, we add that to the little robe, she probably knew the killer, huh? Crime of passion.
do we know where she worked?
she was a college advisor at a place called Benford Academy.
Oh. Fancy.
heard of it?
Yeah, you know, it's that big place up on Mulholland. The tuition's like half our salary.
fools and their money.
Oh, it's home. Uh... Go, go, go.
Hello? Hello. Hello, hello?
Hey, mom. What you doing?
Hi, sweetie. I'm working. What are you doing?
okay, well, I think I finally got it. I've been practicing with Uncle Davey.
let me hear it.
it's better, right? Yeah, that's -- that's really good, sweetie.
you know what? You just got to
you just got to really lean into that yodel, you know?
it's more like...
you know, like that. You know?
tell you what -- why don't you practice it some more, and I will listen to you when I get home tonight, okay?
I got to get back to work.
I love you, Nick. All right, bye.
sorry.
you know, you would think that someone who worked at a school like Benford would live in a swankier place.
Yeah, well, you know what?
her bedroom closet is packed with designer clothes and shoes.
I don't know.
maybe she was living beneath her means so she could dress to impress at the school.
that makes sense.
uh, bed looks like she had company.
they're gonna do a rape kit, see if she had sex, and swab for DNA.
we'll know more soon. We find the phone yet?
not yet, but I'll get a data dump from the phone company.
might take a few days.
here -- her online calendar shows the victim booked from 10: 00 to 4: 00 yesterday, all first names. Yeah, it's probably students.
we can check them against the school roster. Did you find anything on her e-mails?
eh, it's password-protected.
Hey, can you see what you can get off this?
Thanks. Oh!
is it Halloween? 'Cause there's some dude in here dressed like a TV detective.
did you lose a bet, officer? - Yeah, in a way.
I got a call from Lieutenant Valdez last night to report to R. H.D. this morning.
I'm on loan as a detective.
detective Rush. That sounds pretty good.
Yeah. So, why are you acting like you just got kicked down to traffic?
I like to make my own decisions.
I busted my butt for 10 years to break into R. H.D.
they're power-shooting you in, and you're complaining?
look, it might be all right. I'll give it some time.
got to see how much I like all this standing around and chatting.
well, you better hope that's all you have to do 'cause you're not chasing anyone down in those Jimmy Choo's.
as I told this handsome man, um, Colleen's door was ajar when I got my paper.
that's not like her.
so I knocked and looked in and, uh, saw her on the floor, called 911.
were you close to Miss Watkins?
neighborly. She was a sweet girl.
looked after my cats when I went away.
her boyfriend's nice, too.
do you know the boyfriend's name? No, but he's around all the time.
he works for that delivery company
you know, the one with the shorts.
I know it well.
well, thanks very much for your help.
detective, what do you say you track down the boyfriend, see if you can bring him in? You got it.
you and I will head over to the school. Mm-hmm.
you know, we pride ourselves on preparing the kids to go out into the real world, as if it's something beyond this campus.
alas, today's a harsh reminder that it's everywhere.
headmaster O'Dell, it's our understanding that Colleen Watkins was the college adviser here? Uh, yeah, that's right.
applying to colleges is different than it was when we were kids.
it's a full-time job. And it's Alex.
everyone here just calls me Alex.
and Colleen directed students to the right schools?
Oh, yes, and she was excellent at it.
Benford parents expect their children to attend very selective colleges.
well, since Colleen's been with us, acceptance rates at the Ivys have skyrocketed.
her death is a terrible loss for the school.
alas...
did you know if she was seeing anyone?
Oh, I try to keep things professional with my staff. It just simplifies things.
some of her colleagues may know.
I can arrange for you to meet with them, if you like. Thank you.
we also have a list of students she met with yesterday.
we're trying to understand her state of mind before she died.
sure.
have you ever met any of her family or friends who didn't work here? I know she had a boyfriend, but I never met him.
I think he travels a lot.
I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but Colleen usually had a salad for lunch.
she found me this great internship reading to blind people.
colleges love that kind of stuff. Makes you seem really charitable.
Colleen played tennis as an undergrad, and so do I.
Texas State something.
she also helped me get my S. A.T. s into shape.
she was...
I think she came from money.
she spent a fortune on clothes.
everybody knew bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem like she had any close friends.
no one had ever been to her apartment, and none of them had ever met her truck-driving boyfriend.
well, it makes sense if she was trying to move up in the world.
neither her boyfriend nor her apartment come off as Benford material.
Oh, excuse me.
Yeah. Okay, great. Great.
Romeo picked up the boyfriend.
guy named Timothy Kane. He's taking him downtown.
they wouldn't tell me how she was killed.
I just want to know what happened.
well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
how long had you and Colleen been dating?
we weren't.
we broke up about three weeks ago.
but before that, we'd been together for about six months.
why'd you break up? Different priorities.
I make pretty good money, but I wear shorts to work, you know?
that was never gonna be enough for Colleen.
when's the last time you saw her?
about three weeks ago, the night we broke up.
detective Rush told me that you...
transferred to a different delivery route.
Yeah, I got to know Colleen because she orders so much stuff online.
Um...last thing I wanted after we broke up was to see her name on my delivery list every day.
so you still had feelings for her.
I didn't kill her, if -- if that's what you're asking.
no, that's not what I'm asking.
but I'm glad to hear you say that, so I can assume that you won't mind if we swab for DNA?
where were you last night? My shift ended around 10: 00, and I went out for a beer with some of the guys.
okay.
now, if you wouldn't mind checking out his alibi...
Hey, Romeo, this is the job.
it's connect the dots. It's chasing down a thousand little details that might bust open a case. I know.
I get it.
Colleen Watkins has a sister way out in Apple Valley.
local P. D. is driving out to give her the bad news.
is this the new guy?
Ah. Ramon, this is Ted Buerge.
I'm sure you guys have lots to talk about.
they call you Romeo, right?
uh, Ramon Rush, patrol.
I'm on loan to you guys as a detective.
Ah. I love new guys.
I got to be in court today with Van Stone.
pick up my shirts for me, okay, handsome?
it's just a game.
do we like the ex-boyfriend as the doer?
he has motive, but we're checking out his alibi.
s. I.D. got into Colleen Watkins' e-mail account.
she's been receiving steamy messages for the last month or so. Well, that would fit the timeline.
she broke up with her boyfriend about -- what? -- Three weeks ago.
you got a name? Yeah, I do.
and if either of you recognize it, let me know.
his name is smoothloverx.
now, it's a hotmail account, so we don't have a name, but I can read you one of his e-mails.
Oh, whoa. That's not necessary.
dearest Colleen, your touch has unleashed the lion in me.
okay, I think we -- "My days are spent in reverie, imagining the next time your mouth, your tongue"
okay, you know, I get it.
uh, wait a minute. "Your breath is on my skin."
that we must be discreet, "that I can't shout your name from the rooftop, tears my soul asunder."
"Alas --" Okay, who says "asunder"?
the same guy who says "alas."
O'Dell, the headmaster.
so Colleen Watkins was sleeping with her boss.
Yes.
and her boss calls himself smoothloverx.
EW! Ew!
so, you lied to us. You were having an affair with Colleen Watkins.
smoothloverx. Those are personal.
do you write notes like that to the missus?
look, I-I liked Colleen, I had fun with her, but I never had any intention of leaving my wife.
did she know that? Yes, Colleen was aware of my situation.
well let's see if I can understand your situation.
you knew how important it was for Colleen to be at Benford, so you used your power and your position to seduce her.
and then when you got tired of the arrangement, you
I didn't kill her.
where were you last night? I was in my office, at school, writing a speech for alumni weekend. I was there till 11: 00.
and did anyone see you there?
no.
hmm. Where was your wife?
um, she -- she was at a board meeting.
she got home after I did. And when we talk to her, she'll be able to tell us the same thing. I didn't kill Colleen.
we'll need to take some prints and collect some DNA.
is there, uh, any way of keeping this quiet?
Benford can't really afford any more bad publicity.
what do you mean "any more"? A family sued the school after their son was rejected from Dartmouth.
th-the lawsuit named Colleen as a defendant.
the case was dismissed, but the school's still recovering.
alas...
alas, a lawsuit and an affair.
any other grenades you'd like to throw into the fire?
does the school get sued a lot? - No.
no, b-but families like the Delgados expect us to work miracles.
if you're looking for someone with an ax to grind against Colleen, I'd look at them.
hang on. Sheppard.
Yes, this is she.
Oh, well, what did he do?
Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Bye-bye.
Nick's principal wants to see me. She say why?
no, she just said she wants to see me.
today.
Patrick's an amazing kid, and we spent every dime that we have to send him to Benford.
Yeah, then he was rejected from Dartmouth -- early decision.
another boy from his class got in, a boy with lower grades.
but his parents gave money to Benford for a new gym.
so you think that Colleen was giving this rich kid preferential treatment.
they talk a good game about scholarship and diversity.
but at the end of the day, we were never accepted.
so, where were you two last night? Here, with Patrick. We had a late shipment.
and we didn't get home until midnight.
check the security tapes, if you want. It's all there.
tell me you're not saying anything crazy. - Patrick!
no, for the zillionth time, I told you it wasn't Colleen's fault that Dartmouth didn't want me. She did everything she could to help.
I just didn't have what it takes.
I don't see them doing this.
Hey, 'Chelle, did their son, Patrick
did he seem kind of anxious to you?
he seemed embarrassed by the whole thing.
no, it was more than that. It was like he was agitated.
I'll have a uniform come back for all the security tapes.
hopefully, Patrick is in them with his parents.
you know, they -- they spent everything to send their kid to this school, and they just looked miserable.
Yeah, well, you know, it's tough.
you always want the best for your kids.
Yeah, well, we didn't go to Ivy League schools.
state colleges worked pretty good for you and me.
good job, good money, solid benefits. Oh, yeah.
I'd die without the dental.
I got this genetic plaque thing, and it's like it takes, like, an ice pick to get that stuff out of there.
Yeah, not that I don't love your dental horror stories...
excuse me.
okay, thanks. Thanks.
coroner's report just came in.
they confirmed Colleen Watkins died around 9: 00 last night from her knife wounds.
they also said that she had intercourse, but her partner used a condom, so DNA is a long shot.
Hey, Nick, how was school today? You know, school.
anything special happen? Nope.
all right, Nick, why is the principal calling me, huh?
I don't know. What do you mean you don't know?
look, let me talk to Uncle Davey. Uncle Davey's in the shower.
mom, I really can't talk right now.
Leo and I are doing a science project.
for school? For fun.
Bye.
he must have done something really bad.
are you ready?
start the timer.
what about the family with the nursery?
well, they were upset but not insanely so.
their son seemed jumpy, so we're checking out his alibi, as well as theirs.
this was a crime of passion, and there's plenty of passion to go around.
the ex, Tim Kane, was kicked to the curb because Colleen was embarrassed of him, and Alex O'Dell was cheating on his wife.
and how are the alibis on those two?
well, Rush is tracking the ex's delivery schedule, and O'Dell didn't have one.
we're bringing his wife in to see if she knew about the affair.
curious to see just how passionate she was about her marriage.
any physical evidence?
the knife was wiped clean, and whoever she had sex with used a condom, so...?
did you get anything else off the victim's computer?
just that the girl loved to shop.
I mean, there are a few third-party web addresses that S. I.D. is still trying to crack.
uh, Mrs. O'Dell is here.
nice shoes, detective.
it's good to see someone take a little pride in their appearance around here.
thank you, sir. You're welcome.
I'm gonna head out.
Mrs. O'Dell, how long had you known that your husband was having an affair with Colleen Watkins?
almost from the get-go.
Alexander's not really capable of keeping a secret from me.
and you never felt that the affair would threaten your marriage?
my husband and I connect on many levels, but romance isn't one of them.
we each have our own special friends for that, and we're fine with it.
you know, I noticed at the school that a number of the girls were quite taken with him.
do you think that your husband would ever become involved with one of his students?
he's always getting poems and flowers and cards, but he'd never risk crossing that line. He enjoys his job too much.
why have the devotion of just one when he can be adored by them all?
I just spoke with the victim's sister.
she said Tim Kane went all stalker on Colleen after she broke up with him
waiting for her at apartment, following her to school, begging for a second chance.
this all fits with what Romeo found out.
Yeah, something wasn't making sense when I tracked the ex-boyfriend's delivery schedule, so I talked to the guy who took over his old route.
the guy was supposed to deliver a package to Colleen.
the ex took it and told him he was going over to her house anyway.
the victim signed for the package at 8: 14.
the ex returned the truck at 10: 06.
but Colleen's apartment is only a 20-minute drive.
so that puts an angry ex-boyfriend in her apartment delivering a package less than an hour before the murder.
Colleen signed for a package that you delivered at 8: 14, an hour before she was dead.
okay, you've been stalking her all hours of the night, and you expect us to believe that you were not involved?
I never touched her. So you didn't have sex with her.
I didn't kill her.
she was upset.
I-I-I could tell as soon as she opened the door that she'd been crying.
did she explain why? - No, no.
she just...hugged me.
and then you had sex with her.
Yeah.
I mean no. No, not right away, no.
it wasn't -- it wasn't like that.
Colleen initiated, not me.
well, that must have been very confusing for you, what with all the feelings you still had for her.
is that the first time that you'd been intimate with Colleen since the breakup?
so you must have thought that you had a chance at getting back together with her, huh?
Yeah.
I thought I had a shot.
but she told you you didn't.
no, I'm just another embarrassing thing in her rearview mirror, like her family's farm or the little state college she went to in Texas.
God forbid anybody at Benford ever hear anything about me.
I couldn't get her where she wanted to go.
maybe that's why she had an affair with somebody at Benford.
you didn't know about that.
no, but it explains a lot.
so, then, that's -- that's why she was crying when I dropped off the package, right?
some other dude.
Hey, this package -- do you happen to know where it was in the apartment?
the kitchen counter, maybe. Any idea what was in it?
shoes, clothes, shampoo
Colleen ordered her whole life online.
all right.
sit tight. You're not going anywhere.
well, he's big enough and hurt enough.
Plus, he got double-dumped.
for 17 minutes, he thought that they were back together.
17? With an ex, you're lucky to get 12.
well, somebody has a digital clock in their bedroom.
Hey, I get sex with an ex.
there's no instruction manuals, there's no surprises, and it definitely does not raise the number.
Yeah, but it's still tricky, you know?
one person's always more invested than the other, you know?
Hey, I don't remember seeing a package at Colleen's apartment.
you?
no, and I stood right next to the counter. I wonder what happened to it.
Hey, you know what? I got to go.
I got to get to Nick's school for that meeting with the principal.
okay, and I'll put the ex on ice for the night. There's enough to hold him.
on the way home, I'll stop by Colleen's apartment, see if I can find that package.
all right. Wish me luck.
what you doing? Going over these delivery records for Dulcett on the Colleen Watkins' case.
ain't cop work a hoot? Uh, lieutenant has a task for you.
Yeah, as soon as I'm finished with this
l. T. needs it asap. He takes priority.
need you to dig up a file -- last name Maines, first name Myra.
it's personal. On the D. L.
don't just leave it on his desk.
make sure you put it in his hand.
Hey, I've got a file for the lieutenant. Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, I'm supposed to put it directly in his hands. Uh, any idea where he went?
he headed toward reception.
Hey, have you seen the L. T?
no. Okay.
Hey, lieutenant heard you were looking for Myra Maines.
"my remains"?
Buerge, right?
Yeah.
that file's been suckering rookies for a hundred years.
you know how I'd get even?
pizzas. Like 20 of them in his name.
why don't you put that back for the next guy?
welcome aboard, detective.
Hey, Buerge. Hey.
Hey, I gave the lieutenant the file. He thought it was a riot.
don't even think about getting me back.
I've heard it all. Yeah?
Uh-huh. Just so you know, women throw themselves at me everywhere I go.
at the car wash, the supermarket, even the dry-cleaners.
it's insane how much tail I get.
damn it. You win.
how's it going?
damn it!
Nick's always had a ton of energy. You know, he probably gets that from me.
I'm always saying, you know, "Nick, use your powers for good, not evil," you know?
not -- not that he's evil, you know what I mean?
not, like, stuff that I've seen, of course.
Mrs. Sheppard, Nick's not in trouble.
um, your son received the highest scores in this school's history on the G. S.E. My Nick?
you should be very proud.
but he's always saying that school is so boring.
no offense. None taken.
that's not uncommon with really bright children.
the work doesn't challenge them, so they tune out.
Wow. It's just, um...
it's amazing.
well, is there some extra stuff that he should be doing, like... Spelling words or
that's why I wanted you to come in.
as much as we would love to keep Nick here at our school,
I'm not sure we have the resources he needs.
you just lost me. What?
Nick needs to be surrounded by peers of his intelligence level.
if I were you, I would check into some of the more academic private schools.
I mean, how is this even possible, you know?
I mean, I'm his mom and a detective.
how could I have missed this?
genius.
Really? It's just...
he's pretty diabolical in D&D.
Yeah, but, you know, I expect Nick to be that kind of genius, okay?
that kind of genius I can handle.
but what am I supposed to do with this one, you know?
the real kind -- you know, the kind that has to go to private schools and have tutors and cellos and -- Cellos?
well, for instance, you know?
look, I mean, part of the reason you guys came out here was because the schools were better.
maybe you sensed his need. Maybe.
I don't know, though, Davey. You know what?
I was at a private school today, and, I mean, the grounds were just gorgeous, right? The campus was beautiful.
they had all the resources money could buy.
but the kids there, they just -- they didn't seem like kids, you know?
and I don't know.
I mean, is that what we want for Nick?
do we want to put him into that kind of an environment and...
I don't know.
Nick tends to roll with the program.
you sure you're not worried about how you'd fit in?
well, I wouldn't. I mean, I already know that.
but, then again, it's not like I'm a perfect fit in the school he's at now, you know?
I mean, there aren't too many other parents carrying firearms or showing up at parent-teacher conferences with a tranny hooker cuffed in the backseat.
sad but true.
you know what?
the bottom line is that I am just gonna have to do the very best that I can for Nick...
the genius.
you know, you and your ex are both very smart people.
it's entirely possible that your kids are even smarter.
Ooh. Well, maybe. I don't know. Let me clean this up.
Hey, 'Chelle. Hey.
so, I went back to Colleen's apartment and I double-checked with S. I.D.
there was no package at the apartment or in the trash.
you know what? Maybe we're asking the wrong question.
maybe we should be trying to figure out what was in the package, and then we can figure out who took it.
okay, I'll have S. I.D. track the sender's I. S.P.
through the delivery company in the morning.
you know what? I'm gonna head by Benford in the morning.
there was this girl that I talked to this morning, and -- and she knew about Colleen's days as an undergrad in Texas.
now, if Colleen was embarrassed of her past, why is she telling this kid anything? Hey, hey, give me a kiss.
that's a good question. Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, I know. Okay.
all right, see you then. Bye.
Hey, how was your first day of school? - Hey.
well, I, uh... Picked up Buerge's dry-cleaning.
I tracked down a delivery truck, and chased about a dozen stupid little details that are probably gonna go nowhere.
Yeah. That sounds about right.
not for me.
Why? 'Cause every day on the streets is a shoot-'em-up rodeo?
no, of course not, but
you know what?
I don't know what this is really all about, but you are messing it up.
I don't remember asking your opinion.
you are looking at a chance to work in one of the best detective divisions in the world.
I waited 10 years for my shot, and for whatever reason,
valdez is reaching out and offering you a shortcut
you're not hearing what I'm saying.
no, no, no. I caught every word.
if you can't recognize an opportunity...
then maybe you should go back to patrol.
I told you to go to bed. No, you did not.
good night, Nick! He's going up right now.
Yeah, show me the computer. It's nothing. It's just a little thing that we were...
it's like math. What do you mean it's like math?
you'll overreact. No, I won't.
give me the computer. Mom, I won 50 bucks, right? 50 bucks.
that's great. What? Give me the computer.
give it to me.
what do you mean you won fif-- Blackjack?
Davey? Really?
uh, am I in trouble? No.
can I keep the money?
no way. Go to bed. Go to bed. What?
are you kidding me, man? Online gambling?
what are you doing? He's 11.
I'm sorry.
how good is he? - Really good.
Really? Yeah.
he split a pair of aces, and he caught two Queens.
what is that?
50 bucks.
I was looking at private schools today.
we're gonna need a whole lot more than 50 bucks.
Nick! Stop it. That's not funny.
you're such a
excuse me. It's Madison, isn't it?
Yeah. You have a good memory. Oh. Well, thank you.
sure.
Madison, how did you know that Colleen did her undergrad in Texas?
Oh, she told me.
we talked about all kinds of things when we worked together.
that happens a lot. People confide in me.
Oh. Well, that's wonderful.
I also noticed that you were very close to headmaster O'Dell the other day.
it's great that you have such a strong support network.
still, it's got to be a lot for you, you know, losing your college adviser in the middle of the year.
it's not easy, but I try not to let it slow me down.
Yeah, well, still, you wouldn't be normal if it didn't set you back a bit. Not my favorite word.
"normal" might be okay for your job, but it's not going to get me into Yale.
that's what Colleen was helping me with -- focus.
when I mentioned headmaster O'Dell, you seemed uncomfortable.
not really.
when I saw the two of you talking back there, he seemed upset with you.
Madison, if this has anything to do with Colleen, you should really tell me.
I couldn't tell you anything yesterday, not with Alex there.
after my appointment with Colleen the other day,
I went to the gym to get my tennis bag.
I don't know if this is hearsay or admissible, and I don't want to be a tattling bitch.
no one thinks that. I saw Colleen arguing with Alex.
she was begging him to leave his wife.
he said that there was no way, but she was hysterical, and he was really, really angry.
well, thank you for telling me.
let's, uh, get you to class.
what do you have on the Colleen Watkins case? We got a lot.
there's this girl, a student at Benford
she's got a serious crush on the headmaster.
anyway, she said that she saw him and Colleen arguing the day of the murder.
how is his alibi? Nonexistent.
his wife's alibi does check out, though. They both lawyered up.
we're still holding the ex because we've established that he was with Colleen around the time of the murder.
that is a lot. Yeah.
any word on the missing package?
Chelle's having S. I.D. track the online shipping company.
we're trying to figure out what was inside.
you think the contents will clarify things?
maybe, yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
sure.
your kids, they go to private schools, right?
Yeah. It was my ex's idea.
which one? First and second.
Why?
well, Nick, my eldest, he aced this test, and his principal thinks that we should send him to a better school.
so, anyway, I started looking online, and
they all cost a fortune.
Yeah, I just don't see how I can afford it, unless I start knocking over liquor stores on the side.
I try not to think about the boat
I could have bought with all that money -- Catalina 47.
you could sail it around the world if you want.
but most days, my kids love their school, and they're doing real well, so it's worth it.
Yeah, well...
found what was in the package.
adderall. Lots of Adderall.
Colleen had prescriptions from three different online pharmacies.
she was getting almost 100 pills a month.
there's no way in hell this is for A. D.D.
Hey, what if she was pushing it on the kids?
I mean, at the Delgados' yesterday, their son said that Colleen did everything that she could to help him.
what if that included selling him Adderall?
Yeah, well, it would explain why he was so agitated.
you know, a lot of these kids abuse this drug because they think it's gonna raise their I. Q.
Yeah, they're morons for thinking that.
only thing it will raise is their blood pressure, cause a stroke.
let's go talk to Patrick Delgado. Yep.
you were on Colleen's calendar twice in the last month.
now, don't you think that's a little odd given that your parents sued her?
I guess. Maybe.
we checked with your teachers.
the dates you saw her were right before you had big exams.
was Colleen selling Adderall to you to help you study?
no. Patrick, look -- you're 18 years old.
we don't need your parents' permission to take you downtown.
she wasn't selling it.
what, she gave it to you out of the kindness of her heart?
Colleen was more like a trainer for a sports team
always careful about how she dosed us.
only gave us the pills before a big exam to help us focus.
but that wasn't enough for you, was it?
you wanted to take it more often.
thought it would make you smarter.
I told Colleen I'd even buy them from her.
she wouldn't do it.
so what'd you do? Found another source.
total bitch but fewer rules. Are you talking about Madison?
maybe.
I know my rights. They need a warrant to search my locker.
Alex, please tell them they can't do this.
look, I'm sorry, detectives, but Madison's right.
there is no way I can allow you to do this on school property without a search warrant.
we really need a warrant? Well, I have to protect my students.
well, we can get a warrant, can't we, 'Chelle?
Yeah, a couple hours, yeah. Just know that, when we do come back, we'll bring about a dozen black-and-whites, sirens blaring, and we may even call in a helicopter so none of the neighbors miss out on any of the action.
unless, of course, you think that might bring more bad publicity to the school.
okay.
Yeah. That's what I thought.
Hey, my father's gonna sue you both. How could you?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, none of you can look in there without my permission!
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you.
do you understand the rights as I have said them to you?
I'm going to take Madison down to R. H.D.
your parents know that we're going there and that we're charging you with possessing and selling narcotics.
my dad's a lawyer.
Yeah, you've said that already.
I'm sure he's gonna be really happy with your new career move.
didn't know they could arrest somebody for being a bitch.
that kid was out of line.
he didn't think I was a bitch when he needed something.
you mean drugs?
you can't trick me into talking.
and even if you could, it wouldn't matter.
you're not allowed to interrogate me without my parents or a lawyer present.
I see. Well, get in the car.
I know my rights.
I can say anything to you, and it's inadmissible in court.
sounds like you know the rules.
it's, like, the only advantage to being a minor.
I understand.
doubt it.
you have no idea what it's like to be me.
perfect S. A.T. s, captain of the tennis team, and yet there's still no guarantee I'll get into Yale.
I couldn't have handled that when I was your age.
most people can't.
but you're so smart.
why deal drugs? You don't need the money.
you're not listening.
my dad's a really good lawyer.
God, you sound just like Colleen.
Colleen knew you were dealing?
most of her advisees started buying from me because I didn't have any stupid rules.
she just couldn't handle that I was more popular, so she tried to stop me.
she even threatened to tell Alex, as if she could ever turn him against me.
Really?
did she try to talk to you about that? Of course.
but the problem with Colleen was she never really understood her place.
is that why you went to her apartment? To remind her?
because from what I've heard, you were not the only person who felt that Colleen didn't understand her place at Benford.
she's not one of us.
she works for us.
it's crazy.
it's almost as if she was trying to destroy everything that you've worked for.
Oh, I warned her that.
I mean, I tried to reason with her.
I'm usually really good at that, okay?
but she just wouldn't back down.
she slapped me, so I hit her back.
I've never hit anyone before.
I've never used a knife like that.
I just kept thinking, "she's gonna ruin everything!"
and there was no way I could let that happen
not from someone like her.
I couldn't stop.
then she was quiet.
too bad you can't use any of that.
well, actually, I can use all of it.
what don't you understand?
I'm a minor.
no, it's what you don't understand.
now, I didn't go to Yale, but I'm pretty sure you just confessed to murder, and I'm a little disappointed that you didn't know this.
but, by law, there is no assumption of privacy in a police car, not even for a minor.
so I just, uh -- I tape-recorded everything you said.
let's see your daddy get you out of that.
Thanks. Peace offering.
Hey. Didn't know we were at war.
a couple of weeks ago, Lieutenant Valdez asked me if there was some patrol cops that I thought were real up-and-comers.
Oh, so it's your fault I got promoted.
Yeah, you have a very funny way of phrasing that, but, yeah.
Yeah, I thought I was doing you a solid.
um, you can always go back to patrol, you know.
Mm. Not without chatting the L. T.
well, maybe someday you will explain to me what's so terrible about getting a bump.
but just so you know,
I really like seeing you around the office.
and...
uh, I think you have the goods to be a really great detective.
happy first solved murder, rookie!
hear, hear.
Oh, I don't know what you guys are toasting me for.
I did nothing to solve this case.
that's not true. You picked up my laundry, got my car washed.
Hey, in honor of your first case...
you want to grow up and be a real detective like me, you got to learn to dress the part.
Hey, hon, another round for the team.
and, uh, give this slick-lookin' dude the bill.
Hey. Hey, newbies buy. It's tradition.
that's right! That's right! All right.
Hey, uh, next weekend, we're gonna take a test for a different school.
okay. It's no big deal, you know.
you don't need to worry about it or anything.
we're just gonna...
we're just gonna explore our options, okay?
do what's best for you. Sure.
honey, you're a smart boy, you know?
you need to be challenged at school.
you shouldn't be bored.
so this may mean that you stay at your school or, you know, you may go to a different school, so...
okay.
the most important thing to me is that you're happy.
I am.
good.
the standardized tests? They're totally easy.
well, for you, maybe.
for anyone. You just need a strategy.
a strategy.
mom, you know the bubbles you fill in? Mm-hmm.
as you go down the page, you just have to make them go back and forth.
sort of like a Christmas tree.
a Christmas tree.
of course.
Nick, you're a genius.
Yep.
Hey, look what I found.
what, it's a T-shirt?
no, it's like my favorite T-shirt...
the one that I used to wear to sleep all the time. I hadn't seen it for like months.
and it was in the bottom of Leo's costume bin.
you have a night with no kids, and you're cleaning closets?
well, I'm doing it to music.
I'm gonna go to a movie, okay? - All right.
I'm assuming that you don't want to come.
uh, no, I'm good. Thanks.
Bye. - Have fun.
Hey, Stace. - Hey, Billy.
get you a Margarita?
Yes, please. That'd be great.
how we doing tonight? - Pretty good. Yourself?
outstanding. - Great.
enjoy. -Thank you.
Oh. Well, hello, gentlemen.
hello. -How are you?
good to see you, Stace.
Mm. You look very pretty tonight.
for real. - Thanks, Frankie. Thank you.
and I like that shirt. It's a good color on you.
two drinks on the way for you, too.
so we can get your mind in a very good place.
my mind? Really? - Get it off of work.
how about that? -Oh, that's better.
Uh-huh. -Thank you.
thank you so much. Yes.
and I got tickets to Saturday's Dodgers game.
really good seats, too. -Yeah?
what do you say? -"Go blue."
Frankie, man!
Hey! What up, baby? -How you doing, man?
man, never better. Really good.
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Michelle Dulcett.
Roger Jones. Jonsie works with me in Major Crimes.
uh, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
and the other guy says, "Quit"?
and give up show business?
uh... I got to bounce.
hot date? -Maybe.
Frankie here has been bragging about you forever.
come on. Will you?
Hey, Buerge. You lead on this one?
Yeah. Good morning, detectives.
the victim is a 30-year-old white female named Stacey Brown.
cause of death appears to be blunt-force trauma to the head.
we think she was heading into her house. There's a lot of blood over there.
based on the spray, she never made it inside.
the killer put her inside a trash can?
Yeah. Used the container to wheel her to the curb.
a sanitation worker found her around 7: 00
when he hopped out of his truck to stand the container back up.
it was on its side?
Yeah, lucky for us.
coroner puts the time of death around midnight.
looks like she was beaten even after she was dead.
I saw her last night. She was at Parker's.
you know her? -No, but she was sitting with a bunch of cops, -so somebody around here might. -Hey, what do you think she weighs?
about, what, 120? -Yeah, that sounds about right.
she have a purse or anything, Buerge?
no. If she had a bag, it's gone.
but we've got uniforms checking every container down the block, and we've suspended trash service in the area.
what the hell is she doing?
if I knew, I'd tell you. -You know what?
these things are built to take a hit, all right?
so why is that one on its side?
a lot of them down the block are turned over. Yeah, but those are all empty.
killer could have panicked.
it could have been clipped by a car.
maybe. - Hey, this is Stacey.
Dulcett recognized her, too. Said she was at Parker's last night.
how well do you know her? -Mostly from the bar.
we have some of the same friends. We'd hang out, have drinks.
anything else?
she liked cops. Really liked cops.
you saying she was a badge bunny?
you guys still use that term? -With affection.
all right, so we've got a brutally beaten dead woman who likes to sleep with cops who's about, what, like four blocks away from Parker's, which means that the killer could have followed her after she left the bar last night.
you're saying the killer could have been a cop?
I'm saying we have to be extra careful as we move forward.
looks like she owns a jewelry business with another woman named Holly Marks.
that explains these photos.
looks like high-end stuff.
maybe the killer thought she brought her work home with her.
something kind of weird happened at Parker's last night.
Frankie introduced me as his girlfriend.
are you seeing other guys? - No.
do you have Frankie's number programmed into your phone?
of course.
how do you feel about him sleeping with other women?
out of the question. Sounds like a girlfriend to me.
what do you say we start with the partner, okay?
did you hear about this morning...
young lady stuffed in a trash can. I guess she spent a lot of time at Parker's.
Yeah. Word's out. Stacey Brown.
you knew her?
from the bar. Sweet kid. Terrible thing.
well, anything I can do, let me know.
Yeah.
Yeah. I know her.
but Billy was on last night.
you should talk to him.
any security cameras in here? In a cop bar?
what about the parking lot out back?
we only got a few spaces for our employees.
most people park on the street or behind the Chinese restaurant.
you kind of underplayed it at the crime scene.
underplayed what? -The whole badge-bunny thing.
well, Stacey was a nice girl.
shouldn't be judged because she digs cops.
of course. You ever date a bunny?
I wouldn't exactly call it dating.
Hey, as long as you got two consenting adults, why the hell not?
why the hell not, right? Bunnies respect the job.
they don't give you grief if you get stuck at work. -Oh, that's huge.
my girlfriend, Angie...
she knows I can't control when somebody drops dead.
but she still sort of acts like I should be able to.
you ever hook up with Stacey? -No. No.
but there was this other bunny, Rachel...
hoo, we have fun. Or did.
you know, lately, I've been thinking that, um...
I don't know. You got somebody in mind?
Stacey and I have worked together for four years.
I design our jewelry, and she took care of the business end.
bought the diamonds.
is there any way that you think this could have been a robbery?
I...Doubt it.
we rarely carry them, and I checked the safe this morning...
we're not short. -Was Stacey in a relationship?
she was taking a break from all that, but, um, she usually dated cops.
the way that she died...
obviously, the person had a lot of rage.
and I'm just wondering if you knew anybody in her life that she had trouble with?
someone that...
we had this assistant...
we were convinced he stole about 5 grand worth of diamonds, but we could never prove it.
Stacey fired him.
how did he take being fired?
I wasn't there, but Stacey said he got pretty scary.
told her she'd regret it.
when was this? -Three weeks ago.
do you have a photo of him?
this is from my fourth of July party.
we'd just given him a bonus.
bastard.
DMV has an address for Alexander Callahan on Magnolia.
the photo matches the one we got from Holly Marks.
you still owe me the paperwork on the Mancini bust.
Oh, hey, there's this new thing called e-mail.
I sent it to you yesterday.
Hey, Buerge, we got a possible suspect from Stacey's business partner.
not now, Dulcett.
what was that all about?
I'm guessing it's not good.
this is from the parking lot behind the Chinese restaurant.
talk about security conscious... six cameras.
this one caught the most action.
that's Stacey Brown.
I double-checked with her DMV photo.
well, he's pissed off about something.
that's Van Stone.
Joe Van Stone is one of us. And we take care of our own.
we keep this quiet and away from Internal Affairs until we have hard facts.
I want to work this on my own terms, not theirs.
Buerge, I need you to step down. Sheppard, take the lead from here on out.
boss, I-I can do this.
Yeah, I know you can, Ted.
you and Van Stone were partners for seven years.
even if I thought you could be unbiased,
I. A. is never gonna see it that way.
that's the end of the discussion. Coroner's report in yet?
confirmed the victim died of head trauma.
seven or eight blows to the skull... half of them after she was dead.
her blood alcohol level was low... . 04...
no intercourse on the day, -and there was a cut on her left earlobe from a recent injury. -Murder weapon?
something like a thick pipe or a bat.
uniforms are still going through the containers on the block, but nothing that fits the description so far.
I keep trying to figure out why she was dumped into that trash can.
it was a way to move the body.
no, I know, but it feels like it could be a message.
and why was the can turned over?
what was that about? -Okay, listen, before we head back out,
I want to be clear.
this surveillance video of Van Stone could mean nothing.
they could have been arguing about shoe size.
there are lots of other people who could be good for this murder.
and don't talk about this on your radios. Anybody could be listening.
all right? That's it.
let me tell him. All right?
Yeah. -Okay.
van Stone: You wanted to see Lieutenant?
Yeah, close the door.
this morning, you and I talked about Stacey Brown, and you acted like you hardly knew the girl.
I didn't kill her.
but you had an affair with her, didn't you?
after all this time, I can't believe you don't trust me, that you don't know I always have your back. I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
Joe, we got you on tape arguing in a parking lot less than an hour before she was murdered.
I can explain that. - And you will, but not to me.
I made Sheppard lead on the case.
you know, one of these days -you're gonna realize she doesn't walk on water. -She's a good cop.
I understand the politics about putting a woman on this, but Sheppard... she hates me.
can't you cut me a break?
that's exactly what I'm doing.
you gonna put me on probation?
I'm gonna keep I. A. away from this for as long as possible.
in the meantime, you are riding a desk for the foreseeable future.
now get the hell out of here.
Sheppard. Hey, Sheppard.
van Stone is one of us... he's family.
if we don't go to the mat for each other, who will?
Buerge, are you asking me to go the extra mile, -or are you asking me to look the other way? -No, I'm asking you to keep an open mind.
do I think that Van Stone is capable of murder? I don't know.
we both know that, given the right circumstances, anybody is capable of anything.
but do I think that he put that girl in the trash can?
no. I don't.
I think that Van Stone's sloppy but not that sloppy.
well, you've got a weird way of saying it, but it sounds like you're gonna do the right thing.
look, I'm gonna follow every lead I can, okay?
a guy engages in high-risk behavior, there's bound to be blowback.
Yeah, but murder? That's a big leap.
Romeo and I are gonna go pay a visit to Xander Callahan, that assistant Stacey fired.
good luck with Van Stone. -Yeah, thanks.
you must love this, Sheppard.
me in the hot seat, you with the power to hang me out to dry.
I'm just trying to understand what happened, okay?
so, why don't you explain it to me?
I've heard you say that to a lot of guys sitting in my chair.
never leads to a happy ending.
here we go. - Give her a chance.
why didn't you tell the Lieutenant that you'd been dating Stacey Brown when you found out that she was dead?
it ended over a year ago.
I'd only seen her a few times before last night.
didn't seem so over. -She wanted my advice as a friend.
your advice on what?
she'd been dating this guy. It wasn't going well.
he was calling her a lot... Following her.
she wanted me to step in, make it stop. -Who was the guy?
name's Pete Barbanna, works patrol in North Hollywood.
was Stacey the one who ended it between you two?
Yeah.
how'd you feel about that? It was for the best.
I needed to straighten things out at home.
you two looked like you were arguing on the tape.
you want to tell me what the argument was about?
she'd been calling a lot.
I didn't want Jeana to get suspicious.
so I told her, you know, she's got to stop.
well, did Jeana know about the affair last year?
Yeah.
but she didn't know that Stacey had been calling again.
and you're not gonna tell her.
where did you go after you left Stacey last night?
home. Got in before midnight.
all right, look, I'm gonna need your cellphone.
come on.
you know we're gonna get the evidence off of it one way or the other.
now, give me the phone.
and the day just keeps getting better.
what brings you to our neck of the woods, Detective?
internal Affairs wants in on the Stacey Brown murder.
you mean the case we just started investigating, the one in which there are no obvious suspects.
word's out that Stacey Brown was a badge bunny.
and your point is?
where bunnies hop, cops tend to follow.
odds are there's at least one uniform in the mix.
okay, well, when I know there's a cop involved, you'll be my first call.
guys like Van Stone don't think that women belong on the job.
it's fine if we're answering phones or giving out parking tickets, but it pretty much ends there. Well, some guys are afraid of strong women.
don't see the upside. -There's a lot of upside.
you don't have to convince me.
so, I haven't seen you at Parker's in a while.
Yeah. Tired of the scene. Same faces.
thinking it's time for a change. Oh, so you're saying, now that we're working together, you're tired of seeing me?
good afternoon, sir.
detective Dulcett and Rush. Do you live here?
um, yeah?
we're looking for an Alexander Callahan. -Xander doesn't live here anymore.
he, uh, moved to Sedona a couple weeks ago.
he leave a forwarding address? -Yeah. Hang on.
any idea why he moved? -Uh, his sister's there.
he said Sedona has cosmic energy or something.
I'd put money on "something."
thank you very much, sir. Appreciate your help.
so, Officer Barbanna, how long had you been dating Stacey Brown?
I saw her on and off for about six months.
it wasn't anything serious. - Really?
because we heard that you were very upset when she broke it off with you, that you wouldn't take no for an answer.
I disagree with that assessment. -You do?
well, apparently, she was so concerned about your behavior that she asked another officer to intervene on the night of her murder.
Hey, I may have drunk-dialed her a couple of times...
Mr. Barbanna, I think she was afraid of you.
and I'm telling you it was no big deal!
where were you last night?
on the job. -Who do you work with?
no one. Partner had the flu.
I obtained, uh, your work log, and it seems like, yeah, you had a...
a gap...
from 11: 00 to 1: 00.
Yeah, it was quiet last night. No radio calls.
I went through your file.
and I noticed that you have three citations for use of excessive force.
now, would you characterize yourself as someone who has anger issues, Officer Barbanna?
no more than anyone else doing a difficult job.
what are the chances that Peter Barbanna was actually driving around between 11: 00 and 1: 00?
more likely he was napping or making a Booty call.
or he was at Parker's stalking the victim.
Romeo and I looked into Xander Callahan.
I'll follow up in the morning. -With Romeo or with Callahan?
I'll just see you at Parker's around 10: 00.
all right.
off the diving board?
Oh, Leo, that's great. No, you know what?
next time we go swimming, you'll show me.
all right. Yeah. Tell your dad "hi."
I'll see you and Nick in a couple days, okay?
I love you, too, sweetie. Okay. Bye-bye.
I've been gone like 15 minutes.
Oh, well, I-I was trying to straighten out the silverware drawer, and then, I don't know, one thing led to another.
this cobbler is outrageous.
Betsy Wickham made it. -Who's Betsy Wickham?
yellow house, they keep the icicle lights up all year.
Oh, right, right, right, right. -I set up her e-mail today.
word's out I'm doing the Mr. fix-it thing.
and they're paying you back in food? -Yeah, well, I didn't know what to charge.
I'll figure it out.
what's that? -Pork chops.
her husband wanted to give me a bottle of wine as a thank you, but I explained the whole "I don't drink anymore" thing, so... you hungry?
Yeah, I could eat some pork chops, sure.
here we go.
Stacey was a nice girl. I hope you get whoever did this to her.
we're trying to get a sense of who she'd been dating lately.
does this guy look familiar to you?
light beer. Big hit with the ladies.
have you seen him with Stacey?
not in a while. They used to be hot and heavy. But things kind of cooled down.
what about him? -Mm.
gin and tonic. Great storyteller. Lousy tipper.
you know, I haven't seen him in a long time, though.
but it gets busy in here. You might want to ask Rachel.
Oh! Winner! Take it and like it!
I think Rachel just won.
Ramon Rush is working in robbery homicide now, right?
Yeah, he's on loan to us for a little while.
cool. I hope that works out. He is so much fun.
tell him Rach said hi when you see him, kay?
Kay.
anyway, uh, were you and Stacey close?
kind of. I guess. -Well, were you here last night?
no, I was visiting my family in Fresno. I just got back this afternoon.
I haven't seen Stacey since the fight.
the fight?
she threw down with this lady out front about a week ago... got her earring ripped out.
classy.
well, do you know what the fight was about?
last year, she had been sleeping with Jeana's husband.
I guess Jeana found out she was after him again.
Jeana went ballistic, threatened to kill Stacey if she ever went near him.
because you're only putting non-cop suspects up in case I. A. wanders in.
Yep.
Hey, you know what? Maybe the trash can was tipped over on its side because once the killer got the body into the trash can, it was too heavy for them to stand it upright.
you and that trash can.
that would mean that it was a small man or a woman.
like Jeana Van Stone? I've been to barbecues at their house, both kids' christenings. Do you really think she could have killed Stacey?
well, she has the motive, and it sounds like she has the rage.
what about Pete Barbanna? -Barbanna is another angry suspect.
he has no alibi, and there's a gap in his work log which gives him enough time to get back to Stacey's house and kill her.
and on the non-cop front, we have Xander Callahan.
Michelle's still trying to track him down. He's the guy from the jewelry business.
God, I hope he did it. -Yeah, well...
I just put Jeana Van Stone in interrogation two.
Yep.
sure, I got into it with that girl.
she was calling Joe all the time, harassing him. -How'd you know that?
I check his phone bill every month. Talk about a short leash.
well, no one ever accused Jeana of being meek. -These girls are like groupies.
they pick a decent guy and then move in for the kill.
we have two kids. Didn't matter to her.
witnesses heard you threaten to kill Stacey if she didn't leave Joe alone.
I'll do what I have to to protect my family.
where were you Monday at midnight?
uh, in bed, with Joe. You can ask him if you want.
what time did he get home from work? -Around 11: 30.
I'd just finished watching the news.
okay, well, I think that's all I need for now.
s. I.D. is gonna come over to your house, take a look around.
do I have any say in that?
no. Unfortunately, this is a murder investigation.
I-I'm sorry.
you can always call an attorney if you like.
thank you, Jeana.
I was up half the night last night, trying to think if we're missing something with this Van Stone thing.
I don't know if it's relevant, but someone broke into his house last month.
Thanks, Buerge.
Buerge just told me that your house got broken into last month.
did you report that? -All that does is jack up your rates.
and they didn't take much. Probably kids. Why?
I thought it might help. I don't know.
if you wanted to help, you wouldn't have brought my wife in.
your wife threatened to kill Stacey. So obviously Jeana knew that you and Stacey had been in contact with each other again.
so? -So you failed to mention that to me.
all right, look, is there anyone that you can think of who has it out for you?
I mean, somebody you busted, someone you put away? -No more than any other cop.
you sure about that? -Positive.
okay.
this came in for you. -Thanks.
Oh, and I'm supposed to say hi to you from someone named Rachel?
she seems nice.
like I said earlier,
I don't really hang out there anymore.
how's it going?
I heard about Stacey Brown. You got any suspects?
no, not yet. We're still running leads, so...
so, am I gonna see you tonight?
probably. Yeah.
depends on where we are with the case.
can I buzz you later?
of course. You know where to find me.
van Stone is hiding something.
what do you think it is?
I don't know, but I know when I'm being lied to.
I just asked him if there was anybody who he put away who might hold a grudge against him, and he said no.
well, I can think of three who'd kill me if they had the chance.
we all can. Makes me want to look at him harder.
you think this murder's linked to one of his old cases?
it's possible. Tell you what... why don't I go through his old case files?
go.
phone records for Stacey Brown.
I need you to go through it.
give Dulcett anything relevant.
Hey, is she seeing anyone?
Dulcett? -Yeah.
she's a D2.
you really want to date someone above your pay grade?
it's not that big a deal. -Right. Sorry.
forgot I was talking to "Romeo" rush.
no. No, I'm not trying to be a player.
I just don't care about the pay grade.
she just seems so...
uh, I don't know.
as a rule, I'm against dating anyone in the same zip code, let alone the same building. Angie works on the other side of town.
that feels like a pretty good distance to me.
Hi, Gloria. It's Carla Stevens.
I live down the street? - Oh! Sure, hi.
uh, did Davey give you my number? -No, I used the school roster.
I hope you don't mind. I have a quick question.
sure.
your brother set up our new flat screen, and I was wondering what kind of pie he likes.
banana cream. Definitely banana cream.
great!
I just wanted to give him a little thank you for helping me out.
well, that's really nice of you.
Hey, Glo.
Hey, uh, Carla Stevens just called me, asking me what kind of pie you like?
did you tell her berry or apple? -Banana cream.
I hate banana cream.
I know, but she called me, and I love it.
I mean, this whole neighborhood bake-off you got going on over there is sort of strange, but these women can really cook.
it's just... you know what? Let me call you back, okay?
Glo, I've done a lot more digging.
guess who didn't move to Sedona.
uniforms just picked him up downtown, trying to unload a handful of diamonds.
what happened to Sedona, Mr. Callahan? -My roommate got confused.
I was talking about visiting my sister.
she lives there. It's true.
this is all just a big misunderstanding.
that happens to you a lot, doesn't it?
you're not moving to Sedona, you didn't take those diamonds.
those ladies aren't very organized. Stuff's all over the place.
it's not my fault they misplace stuff.
we caught you red-handed, trying to sell stolen diamonds.
stolen diamonds from a dead woman.
what dead woman? -Your former boss.
the one who threatened to press charges against you.
that dead woman.
I swear, I haven't seen Stacey since she fired me.
where were you Monday night at midnight? -Home, playing video games.
can anyone back that up?
Uh...No.
no, my roommate was at his girlfriend's.
which leaves you with no alibi at the time of Stacey's murder.
Hey, we're booking Xander Callahan in connection with the diamonds on grand theft.
do you like him for the murder? -Ah, the rage doesn't track.
I mean, don't get me wrong... he's a sketchy guy.
I could see him talking somebody to death. But bludgeoning them? No. I don't buy it.
I ran into Internal Affairs in the elevator.
I let him think that Callahan was the guy, though, so that we could get him out of our hair.
nice.
look, I have S. I.D. Over at Van Stone's house.
they're looking for evidence right now. I keep coming back to that tipped-over trash can, though.
you know, it's driving me crazy.
just run this through with me.
let's say that this is Stacey, right? And her body's in the trash can.
now, the trash can was on its side so that the garbage man had to get out of his truck so he can put the trash can up so he can do his job. It's obvious, isn't it?
I mean, the killer wanted the body to be found.
because if it were upright, the truck would have taken it away and nobody would be the wiser.
exactly. Yeah.
anyway, I was going through Van Stone's old cases, and I came up with seven names.
now, most of them are back in the system or they're dead but there are a couple of possibilities.
we've got Anthony Stergen and Deshawn Williams.
both are bad guys, and both claim that Van Stone set them up.
ring any bells?
I actually do remember these guys. Both robberies, right?
Yeah, Deshawn Williams drove a getaway car for a home invasion in San Marino, and Anthony Stergen did a number of armed robberies in West L. A.
well, as far as I remember, they're both good collars.
all right, well, Michelle and I are gonna talk to Deshawn Williams, and Rush and Buerge are trying to track down Stergen.
okay. Oh. Sorry about that. -I got it.
Yeah, okay, great. -Well, all right. See ya.
Heather! How did you know I like enchiladas?
Oh, you mentioned you like Mexican food.
I pay attention.
is something wrong? That red bowl...
did Betsy make you something?
Yeah, cobbler. Do you want some?
Oh, she uses cinnamon like a weapon.
if you like cobbler, I can make you one that'll take your breath away.
your buddy, Van Stone, said he saw me driving a getaway car when I wasn't even in the damn state at the time.
sounds like you're still pretty angry about that.
look, the man sent me to prison for a crime
I did not commit.
you'd probably be a little angry, too.
you're right. I probably would.
so, have you seen Detective Van Stone since you've been out, maybe, you know, given him a little piece of your mind?
come on, are you kidding me?
with my luck, he'll probably find some other bull reason to jack my life up.
where were you Monday night at midnight?
my girl's place, over in Compton.
jasmine Lyons.
all right. We'll be in touch, Mr. Williams.
is that your boyfriend, Frankie? What?
why are you freaking out over the word "boyfriend"?
I mean, it's just a word.
it's not the word, okay?
it's just... being in a relationship is like shutting down all your other options.
there's no more flirting, no more possibility of somebody else getting in the mix.
were you looking to mix it up with a certain on-loan Detective with whom you have pretty good chemistry?
his nickname is Romeo, okay? The boy has chemistry with everybody.
you heard that woman from Parker's last night.
I don't know what to think anymore. It's not even about Frankie, you know?
it's like, I like knowing the door is open, that's all.
look, I think you're getting ahead of yourself, okay?
I mean, Frankie called you his girlfriend, not his wife.
true.
it's S. I.D. Sheppard.
Uh-huh. Yeah. We'll be right there.
okay. Thanks.
LAPD.
Hey, guys.
where were you Monday at midnight?
sleeping? -Got anyone who can alibi you?
Nope. I live alone. -That's convenient.
uh, car wash opens at 7: 00.
I'm here most days about 6: 30 to set things up.
doesn't make for a lot of late nights.
look, you guys, I'm just trying to keep my head down, stay out of trouble.
cause you're such a good, honest citizen now?
look, I made mistakes, okay?
but Pelican Bay... that place was hell.
you're scared straight. I'm never going back.
and you don't blame Detective Van Stone for sending you there?
look, the guy's a jerk.
but what am I gonna do about that?
lieutenant?
the murder weapon.
s. I.D. found it in the back of Jeana Van Stone's minivan.
great.
you might be right about this being a grudge killing.
I just never thought Jeana had it in her. I'm not sure that she does.
this whole thing seems too easy.
I mean, you have the tipped-over trash can, the bat in the back of the minivan...
and I still feel like Van Stone is hiding something.
well, unless you can get him to give it up,
I'm gonna have to turn him and this whole mess over to I. A.
I have upheld my end of the deal.
I have done absolutely everything I can to figure out who killed Stacey Brown.
and you have been no help at all.
actually, that's not true.
you've thrown up interference.
I know that you're hiding something, and I don't know what it is, but this is your last chance.
because when I walk out that door, Valdez has to call Internal Affairs.
and whatever it is, I can assure you, they will find it.
s. I.D. Found a baseball bat in the back of your wife's minivan.
it had Stacey Brown's blood all over it.
now, a cop is way too smart to hide evidence in his own car, but Jeana... well, she's a different story, isn't she?
she's a very determined woman.
maybe she's determined to keep her family together no matter what the cost.
maybe she would kill the woman who came between her and her husband.
there's another possibility. Even though you deny it...
there is a world where you and Jeana have been set up...
by... I don't know... Deshawn Williams or some other guy that you put away that thinks you've done him wrong.
I'm a good cop.
and nobody here wants to see you go down.
but you better show me that piece of the puzzle that you're holding on to.
or you're taking Jeana down with you.
she's here right now, in the interrogation room.
all right.
Stergen shot into a crowd at an armed robbery.
killed two people.
I had him... the weapon, eyewitnesses.
asshole walked on a technicality.
two years later,
I was investigating another armed robbery.
I couldn't prove that Stergen did it.
it had his signature all over it.
so when I went to court... -You lied on the stand.
only time in my life I ever did that.
told myself I put a bad man away for almost 10 years.
you think he would kill Stacey...
just to set me up? I don't know.
Hey, Stergen!
you haven't had much luck since you went to prison, have you?
I see that your wife died, and your only child... your daughter... O. D.dD.
I'm very sorry about that.
I should have been around to watch out for her.
but thanks to Van Stone...
Mr. Stergen, your life fell apart because you committed three armed robberies and you killed two people.
all Detective Van Stone did was bust you for it.
he made up a bull story in court, blaming me for a crime I didn't commit.
I'm not here to debate the merits of your case.
no, I am more interested in what you've done since you've gotten out of prison.
I told you. I work at a car wash.
you started following him, didn't you?
you were gonna kill him.
but you changed your mind.
death's too good for a guy like that.
I wanted him to feel every inch of pain that I felt, day in and day out.
so you decided to frame him.
you saw him meeting with Stacey Brown.
you broke into his house. You took that bat and you...
took out all of your rage you felt for Van Stone on that poor girl, didn't you?
maybe you can prove that, but maybe you can't.
but Van Stone spends the rest of his life knowing that girl died because of him.
her death's on him, not me.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
I'd rather give this to you than to I. A.
Hey, Romeo. How you doing?
I'm good. I'm good. It was a long day.
well, you flew through that car wash like you were superman, so...
Hey, can I buy you a beer?
Um...Thanks.
this is, um...
my boyfriend, Frankie Benson.
Hey. Ramon Rush. Frankie Benson, Major Crimes.
Ramon is on loan to R. H.D. As a detective.
Oh, congratulations, man. Thank you.
I hope Michelle's taking good care of you. She's the best.
tell me about it.
Hey, why don't you join us? Have a seat. -Oh, no, no, thanks.
I'm actually waiting for somebody. So... nice meeting you.
all right.
do whatever this Jennifer woman says, because this chili is to die for.
enjoy it... all of it... while you can.
okay. Starting tomorrow, I'm in business.
Oh. -Officially.
Mr. Multi-Task.
see? Prices.
wait a minute. Does this mean we're not gonna get paid -in casseroles and cobblers anymore? -Way too complicated.
well, it was kind of sweet having everything catered the last couple days.
well, you'll get over it. -Mm.
well... I am gonna go upstairs and clean up the boy's closet.
before they get back in the morning which means I'm gonna call dibs on that lemon bar.
Oh, no you don't. Well you know don't I worked hard for this. Hey, come on, gimme...
no. - You already had one.
revenge
Where's my dinner? Not even soup yet!
must I wait with an empty stomach?
no, I can't delay my plans any longer.
what do you wish? Why are you so sad?
doesn't the love of your Klara - dismiss those grim thoughts? - I see you for a while, then I spend hours without hearing your sweet voice.
how can I be happy? - Love me, I said.
you took my hand and asked if I loved you, even while you read the answer in my eyes.
I didn't know what I was saying.
I fear I have ignored our future.
the endless discord between your uncle and my father is not a good omen for our love.
we may face cruel separation. Unless...
unless? Think, find a solution!
everything is up to you. - I'm listening.
we love each other and we wish to live together in peace, free of fear that old feuds might force us apart.
what shall we do then? - Get married.
you're crazy! How? - It's up to you.
rather up the will of my uncle, and of your father.
if there's a will, there's a way.
I understand, but I don't agree.
I want to be with you, - but not this way. - I meant marriage.
who'll believe that nothing happened between us?
I hear someone coming, you must go.
one word... - I've said.
change it or I'll die. - Then we'll die.
Klara, I beg you... - Go, quickly.
God be with you. I got here as fast as I could.
I wore out several horses and came in such haste that my new carriage was left in splinters.
and I am sure, Papkin, that you came on foot, after gambling away in some tavern the money I sent for the journey.
look at my pistol then.
what about it? - I was shooting.
at crows, no doubt.
whom I shot and where, I cannot divulge, but cards are not the reason for my delay.
you know that men drop like flies when I start shooting.
men?
who else? - Moths or mosquitoes?
you'll never believe it anyway. - I'm not a fool, my dear, dear sir.
that a breakfast?! - Yes, breakfast.
my dear Cupbearer, I haven't eaten for six days and nights.
then eat and listen. - Yes, sir!
everyone knows I never miss a shot.
and everyone knows I could toss you in the dungeon for your past deeds.
in the dungeon? What for?
just for fun. - Can't you think of better one?
Silence!
let me remind you where you stand with me.
I am at your service.
I will jump into the saddle this moment if you order it.
I am a born horseman. The wildest of the wild are tame in my hands.
I am a born horseman. - Come on!
as I was about to put my foot in the stirrups, - I was interrupted by a big scuffle. - Listen to me!
just a moment. Here I was walking along, my head up, my hair all curly, a proud look...
any woman would've fallen for me.
listen! - Wait. So there I was, and suddenly a Greek princess approached in her coach, took one look at me, and fell in love.
you know, one thing led to another... when it comes to love I'm like a tiger.
quiet!
you seem a bit upset. - Enough of your chattering tongue!
you are upset. If I had your temper, the blade of my trusty Artemis would...
I'm listening. - Klara's father bought this old castle along with the village.
my father owned ten like it.
we live here like owls, and to make matters worse, the owner of the other half of the castle is the devil incarnate.
that's right - the Notary.
he appears to be sweet and humble, - but the devil's in his soul. - Still, neighbors should get along.
if I don't drive him out, nobody will.
not a day passes without a fight. We have to negotiate, but how?
I won't write that scoundrel! Go to see him?
he's too crafty, my dear, dear sir.
he might secretly poison me, and I value my life.
that is why I chose you to be my emissary.
it is a great honor indeed, but I fear I am too hot-blooded.
instead of making peace I might start a war, for I was born to perform heroic deeds.
what's more, as an infant I swore never to be a diplomat.
Papkin will be, who I tell him to be.
and you obey.
but I am a bad-tempered man.
what if I strangle him, shoot him right in the head, or cut him into pieces?
who'll take the responsibility? - Me and my conscience.
think it over. - I just have.
now, I've got more news.
my dear sir, I am getting married.
well, well! - Well, well what?
well, I'm so happy!
what can I do to speed the matter along?
persuade her, if timid?
force her, if unwilling? And if she is married, should I slit the throat - of her tyrant? - You're crazy!
you know of my courage, Cupbearer. - Listen...
I mean no insult, but I'm a thousand times smarter than you.
but when it comes to conversing with ladies, it's beyond me, I can't do it. So, my dear, dear sir, with your charm.
you can count on it. She's as good as yours.
already married to you. I have an unusual way with women.
just one look, and they are mine.
so I will just go have a look... - At whom, then?
you're right, I do not know. - At the Widow Hanna.
I see. - Wait for her here.
say no more. It will be settled within the hour.
you know how grateful I can be. - I hope I'm about to find out.
he's a madman. Very volatile.
if I didn't have him on a tight leash, I don't know what would happen.
there is no time to spare.
I'll get the Widow for him. She's not my type, anyway.
but Klara... oh, lovely Klara will be mine.
I know she is dreaming about me...
we'll populate the world with lots of little Papkins!
but the Cupbearer stands like a wall between us.
I will give her a sign.
I'll sing a sweet song in her little ear...
with my angelic voice.
Oh my dear daughter, what are those whispers in your room?
mother, it was the cat, lapping its milk.
it was the cat making noises in my room.
Oh my dear daughter, what are those knocks in your room?
mother, it was the cat, hunting for mice.
it was the cat making noises in my room.
Oh my dear daughter, does your cat have legs?
mother, he does, and silver spurs too.
it was this cat making noises in my room.
I told you, it's either a bunch of cats, or Papkin has showed up.
madam, you are an angel!
a colossal embodiment of earthly virtue, draped in grace and charm.
allow my lips to leave their delicate impress on your snowy white hands.
I am your humble servant, and at your service.
what brings you to us? - A wonderful event!
what is this? - Your marriage.
mine?
I have just hosted Lord Pembroke, several princes, a dozen chamberlains, and a few elegant ladies at a supper.
what do they say? - Of course you, fair lady.
everyone has been whispering that the Widow Hanna has a suitor.
but who is it?
everyone compliments you on your choice.
now I understand... - He is wealthy, and well bred.
the Cupbearer has sent him.
what irony. This is exactly what I've been waiting for!
for God's sake, she's fallen in love!
look how she sighs and glances at me. Is she mad?
I'm irresistible, I know. Like all women, she must fall in love with me.
it's my curse. But this is no laughing matter.
the Cupbearer will have my head.
no, I can't let it go on any longer.
may I then congratulate the Cupbearer on the good news?
so he's the one?
why do you doubt me? Have I ever lied to you?
Yes, you have. - But this time...
I'm telling the truth. - Why such curiosity?
what if the Cupbearer, madly in love, charmed with your beauty, fell down on his knees and begged for your hand?
he would be happy with the answer.
how can you be so calm when the Notary has just declared war on us?
he'll see for himself who he's tangling with!
go stop them!
what's up? - He's repairing the border wall!
he's hired 3 masons.
how dare he! I will beat them up and knock down the wall.
down to the ground!
to the ground... - I swear!
take the servants and go! If the masons don't obey, use force. You're trembling.
I'm so eager to fight. But first would you listen to my new ode?
what?
it's an ode to peace. Perhaps the Muse will calm your ire...
stop it. Stay there.
...or I'll end up all black and blue.
my dear mason,
I respectfully request that you stop building this wall, or you might get hurt.
though I have much respect for the artistry of your craft, I humbly advise you masons here present to go to hell.
nothing gets through to them!
are they deaf, or what?
grab them by the neck and pull them from the wall!
quietly and nicely, with no trouble.
don't worry, I'm right behind you.
get out!
get lost!
wait!
what's going on?
my master doesn't want the wall finished.
that's right. I ordered it, and I have the right.
stop the work!
what right do you have? - The wall should remain as it was.
dear neighbor don't be so unreasonable. The wall must be finished.
over my dead body!
finish your job, my friends. Pay no attention - to what he says. - Is it war you want?
my dear neighbor! Stop acting like a bandit.
what did you say?
beat them up! - I am with you,
master mason. Do not be afraid!
let them interfere!
let them strike you!
it's not the end of the world!
I will take the case to court and the Cupbearer will rot in jail!
get me my gun!
I'll shoot the louse. Hurry!
that does it.
pay them for their efforts. But disarm them.
that's it for today.
you, get out of my way, or I'll beat you to a pulp!
I'm anxious to do it. How many of you are hiding there?
come out here!
out the hole, you scoundrels.
cowards! I will tear the whole castle down!
why should I go back there if you're going to tear it down tomorrow? Take me captive and keep me here.
you surrender? - I do, sir.
you heard of my courage? - Naturally.
afraid of me? - Terribly.
you'll do as I say? - Yes, sir.
who are you? - I'm right here.
what are you then? - I'm... I'm...
what do you mean? - I am my master's emissary.
the Notary's? - Indeed.
how very interesting. Any old nobleman as soon as he pays his debts, feels he must hire an emissary.
no wonder so many noble owners end up servants to their own clever emissaries.
this prisoner will make the Cupbearer very glad.
maybe when he sees him and hears of my bravery,
Klara will finally be mine.
let's go, prisoner. - Coming, sir.
well, foreman darling, speak up. Everything must be documented.
in such hard times such beating is a gift from God.
we'll profit from every punch.
all know you got mugged. - Not that bad.
you've been beaten. - Not really.
what? They were obviously beating you.
just some elbows... - Nothing to complain about.
an elbowing doesn't tickle. - Well, true.
it wasn't a caress. - Well, true.
so it's a beating, then. - Certainly.
if somebody takes a stick to your back, you're being beaten.
and if you're being beaten, you'll end up beaten up.
you're right. Being beaten is beaten up.
so you were beaten, that is obvious.
it seems so.
injured? - Not at all!
not at all, my friend? - Oh, no.
not a scratch? A bruise?
we might have one or two. - And a scratch, obviously, is a small wound.
well, yes.
small or large, a wound is a wound.
and where do wounds come from? From an injury.
so if somebody has a wound, his body is injured.
a scratch is an obvious wound.
so you are wounded, deprived of bread and work.
Oh, come on!
deprived, my darling. You won't get any work from me.
injured, deprived of bread and work, - a wife, 4 children... - No children.
no wife. - You're young. You can have them.
true enough. - The complaint is finished.
you will testify that Cupbearer tried to kill me. He went mad - and shoot at me. - I didn't see.
he called for a gun, but to shoot a louse.
shoot a louse... Enough!
I'll find witnesses elsewhere.
come here...
closer.
put down your mark.
michal Kafar. Down a bit.
Yes, yes! Maciej Mietus.
lovely! There's money in it for you.
Cupbearer will have a fit.
I humbly request...
what about our money? - Cupbearer will pay for everything.
that's not right.
you won't lose out. - But we worked here...
go with God, or I'll throw you out!
but our pay... - Anyone would say!
out, or I'll smash you!
God be with you, my good men.
I will get rid of the Cupbearer even if I have to pawn my clothes.
he'll try to sue me...
but my plan to steal the Widow Hanna for my son will hurt him more than any court sentence.
I'm exhausted, I can hardly walk.
what a workout! I fought like the devil!
I'm barely alive!
order some wine, good wine.
my mouth is dry and I'm all sweaty.
who could ever appreciate that? - I saw what you did.
you did?
wasn't I amazing? - Amazing at hiding.
a good warrior can fight anywhere.
what nerve!
it took a lot of nerve to fight so fiercely.
you're lying, dear, dear sir.
you've got to hear this. Trying to take the scaffold,
I leapt so nimbly I landed on the other side.
surrounded by thousands of masons, servants, soldiers.
I grabbed two of them by the hair, spun them around in the air and mowed down dozens with each sweep until there was a hill of corpses around me.
when it reached the top of the wall, I marched back to our side.
and then...
Oh, enough!
and on top of it all, I took a prisoner.
now, I await my reward.
say what?
I've captured the Notary's emissary.
what do I need him for?
brave men like me take prisoners.
may God be with you, and tell your master that if he dares provoke me again he won't know what hit him.
now get lost.
quickly!
you try to help, you fight like Achilles, think like Cato, they just get jealous, and you're left with nothing.
may I dare say a few words?
you're angry cause your neighbor occasionally...
occasionally? Always!
the Notary... - Not a word about him!
both sides should give a little. Forgive, and there will be peace again.
me?
peace with him?
my dear, dear sir. The sun will stand still and the seas will dry up before there'll be peace between us.
you're upset now, and making hasty judgments.
may God protect us from wind, fire, war and men who bow too low.
better low than not at all. - Nonsense.
but... - No buts!
don't deprive me of hope, sir.
but I do a hundred times. I want to hear nothing from him, or his preacher, else they get what they deserve.
the Devil burns in his soul. - No way to reconcile them.
little profit - too much trouble. - They're like fire and water.
what will happen to us, young Master?
I'll have to remain your prisoner.
it puzzles me what made Widow Hanna fall for a reptile like that. But she may be willing to change her mind.
though an older man may be vigorous, youth has its privileges.
but if the Cupbearer finds out that he has been fooled...
Oh my goodness... he may fly into a rage.
well, may God's will be done. One must always accept fate.
the devil take you, and go with God.
I won't go. I'm staying.
what a stubborn pest you are!
see here, friend, do you know what that is?
shake it a bit.
gold?
gold.
it might be yours... - Please, have a seat.
...but there's nothing for free.
how true.
what should I do?
I haven't seen any profit from my recent efforts.
my pockets are empty.
I love Klara.
more unsettling news. - I want to be near her.
that's bad. - Why bad?
not necessarily bad, but the Cupbearer...
...won't approve. - He wouldn't know.
but if? - Let him accept me.
it's hard. - That's for a start, - the rest is up to you. - And if he catches me?
don't worry. - Easier said than done.
is a mere emissary such as you worthy of Klara?
I am Waclaw.
the Notary's son!
good God! In this house!
we are both in trouble.
that sounds beautiful.
consider it yours, if I remain in service here.
well, I'll try... - You'll get this later.
remember, if you betray me, you'll be an easy target from my tower.
one bang and Papkin is stretched out flat.
out of respect for me, put your threat aside, - and I shall act as you wish. - Don't waste time.
I'm going, I'm going...
it's a devilish bind. Poverty beckons and my captive is also my rival.
any way you look, it's dreadful.
one would lock me up, the other shoot me. The hell with them!
and the purse? - It must stay.
are you sure? - Yes.
Oh dear God, what are you doing here?
I should despair, if I only had the time!
what is going on? - Don't act stupid.
I know everything. I was listening.
you want to stay here? - What's wrong with that?
be sensible. - Why should I?
we've already seen that being sensible will only keep us apart.
why stay sensible?
we have to think of something that will bring us together.
let's take a bold step forward and reach for our goal despite the obstacles.
if we we'll be persistent we can accomplish anything.
Yes, let's be bold. You've convinced me.
this is better than running off together.
what if someone recognizes you, or Papkin betrays you?
don't look into the abyss, rather drown your worries in the depth of our love.
stay here then, in God's name. You have my consent.
your permission helps us little.
we may yet convince my uncle. Widow Hanna can help us, since they just declared their love.
she is so modest, yet she promised him her hand.
it should be easy for you to flatter her.
praise her wisdom, virtue, beauty and you can have any position in our house.
from emissary to servant, isn't that suspicious?
but it's an honor, to be in the Cupbearer's service.
I'll tell Widow Hanna.
an hour ago she fainted from fear and now she's fearless.
she saw no chance for success, now she has hope for two.
o fair sex, beautiful and dear, your joys and sorrows are like gentle wavelets on a lake, always chasing one another. As one bows down, other rises.
but in the light of the golden sun they are pure and endlessly one.
and we men?
we, proud rulers of the world, are chasing this disappearing shadow, and live our lives, from each moment to the next, like flitting butterflies.
congratulate me. I've just gotten engaged.
the Widow Hanna has given me her promise.
I know how difficult it was. It was my hard work!
your work? Really? I'll tell you how it was.
it was the perfect moment.
she received me sweetly, winking, eyeing me flirtatiously.
straightaway I began to woo her.
what a fuss she made not this, not that, this way, that way.
and I kept on. 'Midst the giggle, 'midst the chatter, closer, ever closer... then smack!
I planted a kiss. It caused her to blush, and I was confused. I wanted to run away.
and then, my dear, dear sir, she called to me:
wait, Matthew - your will be done,
I humbly accept. Take this ring, and may God grant us luck.
devil take it! Great performance!
show respect, damn it! Or else... - You are so quick to anger.
it's a good thing I'm even-tempered...
we have more important things. - I think so.
this young man from the Notary wants to know if he can stay in your service.
true, he is fit and faithful but...
everyone says he likes the bottle.
whether he likes it or not, there is no place for him here, as I won't pick up Notary's garbage.
have hope, the happy moment is near...
where is this petitioner - and what does he want? - Your humble servant.
Yes, young man? - Allow me be so bold as to raise my gaze to you.
it's you! - Hanna?
Waclaw! - I'm speechless...
what a coincidence! - So, you are the Widow!
didn't you know? - What to say, what to do?
didn't you know that my third husband, may he rest in peace, married me in spring but died in the autumn?
I remember now.
he drew his last breath on my lap. - Did he? Yes, you must have...
I cried at first, but even sorrow drowns with time.
so he drowned? - Who told you that?
that's not what happened? So, I have to go.
Why? You can't leave.
you must be crazy! - That is possible.
I will tie you up. You'll be my prisoner, dear Prince!
don't call me Prince.
I'm so ashamed of my youthful misdeeds.
the name and princely title I gave you were...
what? - Made up.
all made up? - To the last.
you're not a Prince? - Not a bit.
why did you make it up? - For adventure.
I was young and restless.
but you still love me, Waclaw? - I'm caught in her trap!
why are you blushing?
I waited for you, looked for you, but nobody had ever heard of my Prince.
I was young.
young, but very talented at seduction!
I wouldn't say that. - But there is proof.
what kind of proof? - You were unfaithful to me.
one cannot always love constantly, but you should not scold me for that, for you didn't wait so long either.
your husband passed away you received the Cupbearer, and if he died you would seek out the next bachelor.
I'll make no accusations, and I wish you all the best.
we learned from each other, and in truth there can be no deceit where there is no love.
but I am a widow now! - And I'm almost married.
tell me who you really are.
waclaw Milczek. - The Notary's son!
here, in this house! - I got lost.
I cannot believe this! My heart is pounding.
the Cupbearer will find you here, and see you as his rival.
he won't.
don't deny you begged to see me.
what is it that you want? - I don't know myself. Farewell!
you haven't changed. Stay, do not go away.
Oh, Papkin, I didn't know where my captivity would lead.
you are the only one I loved.
I prefer you to a hundred princes!
come secretly into my room. It will be safe there,
I will protect you with my life...
...and I will expect my reward.
and so? - This is...
no one at all! - What does he want then?
what shall I say? - It all goes well, she is on his side.
you can tell me. - Oh, why bother?
his matter is rather serious and we need to deliberate alone.
don't mention his presence here. I will explain it all later.
I'd better go. - I forbid you.
please follow me, Sir.
your case is difficult. I have to refer to the documents.
please, dear Klara, not to mention this - to anyone. - No one will know.
or there may be trouble.
I'll tell you everything later.
nothing looks more funny than to watch the deceived deceiving.
how he begged for help.
I could hardly keep from laughing.
but I must be patient, this game has only started, and is not yet won.
you are the morning dew that restores life to the withering desert lily as it lifts its fertile face to the shimmering azure sky.
Oh my gracious, honey-lipped Klara.
I was close to fading, until your gaze revived me.
may the gods allow me to bow at the altar of your passion before time wields her lonely scythe.
it's an honor to have a master of rhyme and military art for a husband.
but these days young men flatter to seduce us.
I'm not that gullible.
good Heavens, do I have to take an oath to prove I love one so beautiful as you?
even an oath cannot guarantee your constancy.
may the flower of your love send its delicate roots - deep into my fertile heart. - In the old days, a true knight won his wreath of glory before declaring his love.
he fought for the honor of his beloved and only when he won, would he beg his beloved to open her heart, assuring her he was ready to live and die for her.
from this costume and armor you can see I am a warrior.
would that my trusty blade Artemis, swollen with blood like a sponge, were able to speak she'd convince you!
where there was a fortress on a cliff, a wall beset with cannons, sharp waves of bayonets, vaults of sabers - there stood Papkin, lion undaunted, noble swordsman!
please forgive the jealous thunder of my exaltation, but I have sufficient fame.
all I lack is the permission to be among Klara's suitors.
I permit you.
please take my vows.
easy!
now it's time for proofs of obedience, endurance and courage.
queen of eternal beauty, Ornament of Mankind, order me to jump into the fire, and I will perish in flames.
I am not that severe!
you, the jewel of knights, shall not burn.
but let me just repeat:
I demand three tests.
each is cause for glory.
to show you are obedient you mustn't speak for six months.
not a word?
that's it.
and to prove your endurance you must live on bread and water...
but not too long. - A year and 6 days.
I am already dead, but always at your service.
and now to the test for courage. Listen.
in a distant land a monster threatens even the bravest.
it is called a crocodile. Capture it for my amusement.
I am curious to see it alive! This is my unshakeable will.
he who accomplishes these tasks will lead me to the altar.
that one I'll marry.
crocodile! That's all she wants!
Oh yes, thrill and excitement are in fashion now, so young girls dream of crocodiles!
now they want something deadly or ugly.
in the past a small canary would suffice.
now if you don't want me to die fetch me dear a crocodile.
fasting, silence - that's easy.
she won't guard me all along. But a crocodile's a serious matter.
for the devil, not for me!
what? - Nothing.
here - keep silent.
you know? - I know.
I know? I know nothing. Is he staying, is he leaving?
all I do know is that this is gold, but I may get a very different kind of payment from Cupbearer's sword.
and if I cheat Waclaw he will blow my head off but the Cupbearer might do the same anyway.
so I know and I know nothing - a true Devil's bargain:
a bullet here, and a saber there.
as a wise man once said: "Happy who has."
you're right on time my dear son.
let's talk.
your favors, though rare, are a precious gift.
I have been pleading with his Majesty in your favor to assure a bright future for my child.
you are my only hope, and my enemies are jealous of us.
they seek to divide us and would take pleasure in my pain, - as in your fall. - I don't get it...
don't you? This girl, Klara.
she is precious and I adore her.
but in secret.
I have kept it secret 'cause I wanted to make peace - between neighbors. - Me and the Cupbearer?
my God! Who could desire this more than I, a righteous man?
so let Klara and me... - No, this can never be.
the Cupbearer looks for trouble, I am a peaceful type.
don't blame her for her crazy uncle.
you need a different wife, and you'll get one, darling!
a harsh judgment, dear father.
I will not be swayed.
but my happiness is your only goal.
as God is my witness.
but I love her. - You just think so.
I won't survive. - Don't threaten me.
I swear. - Be quiet!
may God's will be done.
but tell me darling, if you are so constant, what about your past adventures?
nothing to say?
hard to believe, but the old man knows it all.
I was young. Maybe... - Well, the Widow, once your true and only love, is staying with the Cupbearer.
she's engaged to him. - I'll believe it if she tells me.
will she?
I have spoken to her about this, and, God willing, she will accept the hand of my son.
but I will not accept hers.
God be thanked for an obedient son.
I have prepared a marriage contract, wherein I state that the first party to break the agreement, pays the other 100, 000 gold coins.
my happiness is priceless.
she can make you happy. - I'll die first.
in any event the Cupbearer will kill us even before.
no, the Cupbearer will hang first.
may God's will be done. You must accept it.
father! - Son!
don't plunge a knife into my heart. - Every cloud has a silver lining.
change your decree! - Impossible.
have pity! - Oh, you have it.
look, I am crying.
can I have hope then? - No, no, dear, impossible.
this grief will drive me insane. - Look I am crying.
say no more! Virtue is the strongest foundation.
virtue is a seed which sows...
but you are too young to know.
because of my actions, and for a hole in the wall, the Notary wants to sue me.
you will go, my dear, dear sir, and summon him to the three hills in Blackwood.
he'll run if I cut him.
better write him. - God forbid!
I have not the skill for all those explanations.
I must admit that lately I haven't been myself.
I can see that.
so... - Don't try to get out of this.
have mercy, please. Don't send me there.
I'll be dead before you slice off his ear.
didn't you say the Notary might go as far as to poison me?
why on earth... - It's not so farfetched...
stick with me and nothing will happen.
the devil never sleeps! - Nonsense!
and if he...?
let him try. I would tear him apart!
so what? I'll be dead!
listen, Papkin...
do it, and your pockets will never be empty again.
may I? - Please come in.
it is an inconceivably great honor to visit you, Notary, master of such...
a worthy house. - Yes.
I am at your humble service.
may I ask whom I'm honored to receive?
this little nobleman downplays his title so,
I won't have to flatter him so much.
I am Papkin.
I'll be able to handle this myself.
I am Papkin, the lion of the North, famous captain and chevalier, and so on and so forth.
wise in counsel, brave in battle, war spirit and peace enemy.
the Swedes, Muslims, Saxons, Italians and Spaniards all know my famous blade and the arm that wields her.
in short, the globe knows Papkin! Now, give me some wine.
I'll bide my time.
this nobleman is a coward.
let's see what's he got.
weak stuff!
hog wash. - He's quite bold.
real swill. Got anything better?
please forgive me sir, there's nothing else.
typical nobleman! They sit in their villages, plow and sow, grumble and mumble, and haven't got any good wine!
when they get you a bottle, the very label frightens you.
stop this! Just bring me something better.
but sir...
dull and sour beyond belief.
real swill, my dear Notary. - I must be patient.
may God's will be done.
visit my cellars.
I've drinks from half the world, hundreds of kegs in a row.
find such bad wine there, and you'll get a horse.
if I may ask, my dear sir, what brings such a warrior into my humble abode?
you want to know? - Gladly.
I am here, you scoundrel, because his Excellency the Cupbearer was attacked in his castle by a horde of your servants worthy of their master, I now see.
quietly, please, your lordship, I hear you well.
I will speak as I please. - But I have a headache.
a herald can't turn his voice into a nightingale's just because you've got a headache.
mind you, I could have you thrown out the window.
and it's a long way down. - There is no need.
is someone there? - Please, don't bother.
you'll fly out of here like a little feather. You four, - wait behind the door! - There's no need, my good neighbor.
now I am listening.
tell me...
why are you here?
you're upset. I didn't know you had such tender hearing.
let me know if I speak too loudly.
will you finally tell me?
right, right... The Cupbearer politely requests...
louder?
so, the Cupbearer asks...
or rather informs you...
that this unpleasant controversy should be immediately ended.
Yes, I am putting this right... the unpleasant controversy...
that is... well, this is...
a devil in his eyes twists my tongue so.
I cannot understand a word, sir. Speak plainly.
it's because... I mean...
forgive me sir. The wine was strong and I am not the best speaker...
those four still behind the door? - So what does he want, my good neighbor?
the envoy is somewhat... - Afraid?
darling, you don't have to be.
the Cupbearer requests, sir, that you meet him at the three hills in Blackwood...
with your sword to end this dispute.
my old Cupbearer is still spirited!
all know that his blows always hit the mark.
he's nicked the noses of all the squires around...
softer, please... - Of course.
softly then, I am requesting you on his behalf, asking you for a short and clear answer.
I'll write to him. But is there time, since he's getting married - tomorrow? - Those are different things.
the ring in the morning, at midday the sword, in the evening a tankard, and at night...
softly.
Yes, softly. Risky business, this.
how did I get mixed up in this?
does his future wife dote on him?
she faints daily for love of him.
and he burns for her like a candle!
they will be a perfect couple and upon my life she will be faithful and true.
Perelka!
see to it things go smoothly tomorrow.
or you'll regret!
show the world what you can do! Spare neither cinnamon nor nutmeg. Everything must be perfect!
you have saffron for the fish, plenty of sweetmeats - prepare us a feast!
what initials shall I put on the centerpiece?
m and H...
for Matthew and Hanna; hearts on top, and VIVAT beneath.
be sure it's well done.
sir, all will be as you wish.
I am here as you requested, to prove that I have changed my mind.
I have wasted no time in thought, for I prefer to act fast. So without even saying:
goodbye, my dear old, I prefer your neighbors to you
I have decided to sign your contract.
I am giving you one copy, and one stays with me.
now that we have our guarantees,
I greet you as your son's wife.
this is a great honor, my gracious lady.
fortune's golden vessel unfurled her sails for me when you took my proposal into your heart.
my fair lady, it's a great kindness to me and my heirs that you will share, from your great kindness, my son's bed.
allow me to invite you, offer all the services required and fall at your dainty feet as your servant...
and footstool.
what's this I hear? What the devil!
he's snapped up his wife and is matching her with his son.
surely the Cupbearer will gut him like a fish!
don't think that I've changed my mind just for the sake of change.
I've known your son Waclaw for years, indeed,
I shall no longer conceal the fact
I have loved him, and he has loved me truly.
this way! - What's this? Papkin here?
Yes, I wait humbly for you to see me.
do you tolerate him? Out of my sight!
Bye. - Wait...
I am waiting. - Your copy.
he fooled me. His lies made the promises I now regret.
me?
if you hadn't interceded I'd be in the hands of a tyrant.
bad luck! - May God's will be done.
one must always accept fate.
one more thing - as the Cupbearer knows nothing of this change,
Papkin will deliver this confirmation and tell him what's in the letter.
he'll ruin me!
give him your message, and I'll add a few words.
is this all true? What are you thinking?
have you no conscience? - Softly.
Yes, softly...
this devil even hears through the walls!
what are you doing! You'll get us all killed!
you know the Cupbearer he won't tolerate this insult.
he'll hurl death at your walls and lay this house to waste.
for God's sake, let's get out of here!
Oh, you have no idea what a fearful trap awaits...
were it not for Artemis' awful might...
hush! May God preserve us! Through the door and down the stairs.
the way is clear. - Not quite.
four men on guard.
take this message to the Cupbearer. Be polite and tell him
I painfully regret that I must part with him this way.
nonsense!
I won't tell him. - Softer, please.
Yes, yes, softer.
here is the letter for my neighbor.
a most hazardous mission.
goodbye, sir. - Papkin thanks you - for receiving him. - Not at all.
and he salutes you. - At your humble service.
I know the way. - That's not proper.
but sir... - You first.
I implore you. - Are you there?
no need for ceremony. - Show this gentleman the way.
please, I can manage.
take him by the arms, but be gentle. The stairs are dark.
you are too kind...
may God's will be done. One must always accept fate.
Papkin has been gone for quite a while.
the Notary is hiding like a fox.
if he wants it that way I'll reach in and drag him out.
Yes, sir. The one who gets in your way does not soon forget it.
even the most clever bureaucrat can't keep up with me. How true.
lady Barska, noble blade!
remember Slonim, and Podhajce?
remember Berdyczow, and Lomazy?
how well you served me in those places.
but on the other hand it has sturdy handle, my dear, dear sir.
Tho' I prefer the damascene.
this sword has finished off more than one deputy.
many more will remember it.
when it's raised it barely flashes, when it sings, go greet your Maker."
time is running out.
quickly, get on your horse and spread the word.
tell everyone clearly that the Bridegroom is inviting them to the wedding feast.
understood? On your way!
so there you are!
I'm parched. Let me have a drink first.
what a task!
first I stuffed his nose with pepper 'til it grew 3 times its size...
now we'll hear a story.
but this Notary is a very lively man and a real devil to boot.
I nearly drew Artemis from her scabbard but was afraid he might hex me.
what a lying hound!
when will I learn about the Notary?
well, he received me politely...
and gave me some wine. - Probably poisoned.
what did you say? - Nothing...
but... - So what then?
poisoned, you say? - That scoundrel is no joke.
something's burning me... - How did he react to my summons?
well?
Hey! Are you deaf and dumb?
we'll find out from the letter then.
what? What? What!
that, that, that...
the Widow... ...has deceived us.
to the Notary... ...she has gone.
to the Notary?
to him? And she wants to marry...
waclaw.
and you said nothing, you cursed creature!
but the whole affair won't last long.
o treacherous sex, unworthy of respect.
if you were here right now this is what I'd do...
she'll want to hear about this!
I'd grind you into powder. But no time now.
I'll hire a fiddler for their wedding!
he'll scratch until their ears burst and the Notary is twisted in knots.
I'll teach him not to meddle in my affairs.
let's go, my dear, dear sir!
something hurts right here. Oh, it's burning.
that dull wine is an awful poison.
you traitor!
such a lovely rose you are destroying.
is it possible, Dyndalski?
is what possible?
that this devilish Notary is killing me with his poison?
come on now.
you don't believe it?
who would bother to poison you?
nothing bad will happen to me? - No.
but the Cupbearer said...
well, that's different.
if he said so, then it must be true.
our master knows everything.
poisoned, you say? What mischief!
what's your advice? What shall I do?
you should send for a priest.
what a scoundrel!
dying... dying.
Oh good Lord!
had I lost my head?
I abused him, so he fixed up a treat for me.
he took the bottle, poured the whole glass, and yes, I drank it. I am poisoned!
I will not make it. It is time to write my will.
I shall pay for my coffin and funeral.
and then... rest in pace.
I won't do it that way.
it's too easy.
mine will be a better revenge, with some new tactics.
if only I could trap his son.
there'll be plenty of time for the father.
let me in... - I am writing my will.
stop that or I'll send you to the madhouse.
you mean it? Now I'll seal it.
sit down.
dip your pen, and write what I dictate.
I'm not so quick with a pen.
we need a woman's hand now. Ransom a life - to hook the suitor. It will work! - Thanks God!
write exactly as Klara would write to Waclaw.
Oh! Oh! - What does "Oh! Oh!" mean?
sir, this will be offensive to her...
don't ask questions. Dip your pen and write. That's it!
it takes talent, my dear, dear sir to render this well.
it must have all that nonsense, all that lovers' babbling.
how to start this, my dear, dear sir?
truly beloved...
too wifely.
we need something more subtle.
half a word here, half a word there.
now you know. But you're not learned in that.
just write. Wait a moment...
be so kind...
what is that?
that? - Capital "B."
a capital letter, sir.
that's a straight line, but where are loops?
one down here, other up.
what the devil?
that's capital "B"?
out!
capital "B..."
I guess if you look hard.
write, sir, very carefully.
be so kind...
my dear, dear sir...
my dear, dear sir my petition...
my dear, dear sir to consider...
my dear, dear sir to consider...
as proof of trust...
my dear, dear sir, or your Lordship...
who although little known to you...
who although little known..." What's this!
oops! An ink spot, sir, but I'll turn it into a letter.
one more spot, and I'll rap your knuckles!
read now...
what have you got there?
be so kind... my dear, dear sir...
my dear, dear sir... my petition...
dear, dear sir... to consider...
go to the devil, you empty-headed cretin!
dear, dear sir" the idiot writes!
your very words, sir.
shut up!
write it again, without "my dear, dear sir" everywhere.
there won't be much left. - Write again, I said.
you've got no brains. Sit down.
sit, I said! - I am.
repeat after me.
be so kind, dea...
DEA...
what!
what does "dea" mean?
I cannot work with this dunce!
I must think of something else.
perhaps I should send a messenger instead.
get lost - no, wait...
no one knows what the Notary's son looks like.
everybody knows him, he was here this very morning.
who? The emissary?
that's the one.
so he came into my house and you never mentioned it to me!
this gold shut me up. - Dear God! You scoundrel!
with one foot in the grave I'm no longer afraid of you.
what good is money to me now?
shut up!
who needs it? What would I do with it?
keeps my pockets full.
be quiet. No time now.
you will still account to me for your actions.
call Rozia and send the old witch to sneak into the Notary's house and tell Waclaw that Klara asks him to come to her secretly.
she'll tell him that I'm not at home.
do you understand?
to the letter. - And you, take some people and hide near the break in the wall.
grab him when he comes.
tie him up if he resists.
such treatment is an insult.
you were and still are an idiot.
just do as I say.
cupbearer. - What?
as a witness...
go to hell!
go to hell..." there's gratitude!
as usual, everyone thinks only of himself.
fine when things go right, then "go to hell!
he's stubborn as a mule!
in all my life I haven't seen such things.
he is truly a knave today.
why does he treat me like a schoolboy?
what does he think? What is wrong with my "B"?
what does it lack?
wrong shape or maybe the size?
God, this is the cross I have to bear!
o my dear, merciful Klara!
my body is poisoned, but my heart loves you still!
what happened?
I'm a dead man.
I would fetch you crocodile and win your hand, but it's time for me...
to end this knightly suffering.
he's lost his senses!
I entrust my will to you. Please listen like a mother, and weep on my grave.
I, Joseph Papkin, the son of Jan Papkin...
Yes, his name was Jan...
being of sound body and mind, but unable to predict when I'll die because I have been poisoned by the Notary's wine...
a little wine...
I am writing this to dispose my real and other property.
of the real I cannot dispose, because I have none.
the other goes:
to the one I have always loved and honored - fair Klara Raptusiewicz the lady of Zakroczym
I leave my English guitar and a rare collection of butterflies, presently in pawn.
my Artemis, previously pledged to the Cupbearer, to the most valiant knight in Europe if he erects a monument on my grave.
the rest of my things bury with me.
the executors of this will are his Excellency the Cupbearer and Klara, but they should not pay my debts as I desire to leave them as mementoes to my brothers of different rank and faith.
Jozef Papkin
just Jozef Papkin, incognito, no place here for titles.
take it and let it stay in your memory forever.
Klara! What is going on?
fate conspires against us. We may lose everything.
careful. - He's been bribed.
the Widow is in my house. Father wants me - to marry her. - God forbid!
his influence upon her - is shameless. - I have no advice to give.
my uncle is so impetuous!
he thinks I'm an emissary.
not any more. - You've betrayed me?
well, I told him.
scoundrel! - My dear, - you're upsetting me. - Let me punish him!
you'll be the death of me yet. - I am not frightened, - I'm as good as dead. - What is he saying?
nonsense! Go on, don't lose a moment.
Yes, run away. The Cupbearer's men are waiting to grab and tie you.
he'll imprison you. - Isn't that enough for you?
what about us? - I'll write.
this evening. - I hear a noise...
what I meant... - Later!
I go now, but I'll be back...
my dear, dear sir,
I've trapped you like a bear.
what could you possibly do to me?
there're lots of you, but I'm not afraid.
if you are a brigand then you have me, but if you are a man of honor let's duel. I will not die!
I like your spirit, but we've other business.
listen to me.
the Notary stole my fiance and wants her to marry you, but I'll not let him triumph.
I have my plans. You can either go to prison...
where they won't find you or give your hand to Klara.
so for you, a lovely young bride, for the widow an old maid's dream, for the Notary a thumping - and revenge for me.
all will be settled.
but... - There are no buts.
just a moment... - Now or never!
shall I believe him? - We should.
shall we marry today? - Sure!
so we'll marry.
then give her your hand.
the priest is waiting in the chapel.
Hurry! The Notary is finished!
Oh, good evening. Has the plague struck?
nobody to tell me if the master's home.
I am at your service.
interesting.
he summoned me to a duel and I agreed.
may God's will be done. One must always accept fate.
so, I waited there, ready to pick up the sabre, but my challenger did not appear.
please, dear Notary. Don't duel with him, he'll cut you to shreds. True as God in heaven.
Hooray! Long live the bride and groom!
who is getting married? - Your son.
impossible!
hurry up, Smigalski!
saddle my horse! It's already after four!
dear God, do not lead me into temptation.
he came into my house, so I cannot harm him.
what do you want? - My son!
gladly.
you'll be happy. But with or without his wife?
this is too much...
what is too much? You stole my fiance to make her your daughter-in-law.
in turn I took your son and married him off.
there you go: Tit for tat.
Oh, my father!
Oh, uncle.
let's end all this confusion. - Please forgive us father...
and bless our love.
get up darling, and come with me.
am I to believe what is happening?
waclaw and Klara? - I'm going crazy.
since it has happened, I must believe it.
let me explain everything to you.
I wanted to get married to escape the life of a beggar.
the fortune I had was never for me. Today it falls to Klara forever.
two fortunes - quite a nest-egg!
yet her uncle looks chagrined.
you can't always win.
but I still don't lose, with 100, 000 from the Notary.
no...
I will pay.
please do not resist any longer.
leave your anger behind and give us your blessings.
may God's will be done. One must always accept fate.
can I trust you?
will they hurt me?
I call upon your lordship to strike up the music and fill the goblets! We'll drink to the newlyweds.
may our houses join just as these couples have done.
my dear, dear sir...
peace between us?
peace!
Yes, peace and may God bless us.
Oh fortune, this is too much for me.
a poisoning and a wedding, all in one day!
the sun will stand still and the seas will dry up before there'll be peace between us.
may God's will be done. One must always accept fate.
I have wasted no time in thought, for I prefer to act fast.
what is wrong with my "B"? What does it lack?
he who accomplishes these tasks will lead me to the altar.
that one I'll marry.
both sides should give a little. Forgive, and there will be peace again.
you know, my buddies up in New York, they still don't think you people exist.
we're gonna have ourselves a wedding
our boy and your girl.
I am the new boss. He is the old boss
get over it.
so where are we gonna go?
life's a river, kid.
you gotta go where it takes you.
come on!
you're in the wrong lane!
Mick, look out!
shit!
Oh, my god!
I'm sorry.
the American dream -- we're gonna steal it.
Dougy was lookin' for work...
as a lawyer.
ever done in-house?
Hi. Doug rich.
Panco team, meet your new legal chief.
dahlia, what are you doing here? I brought you lunch.
isn't that what every good little housewife's supposed to do?
I'm guessin' you're good at a lot of things.
you know, I could use someone like that around here.
I bet you could.
been there, done that.
so how do I find you?
I'll pick you up.
8: 00 tonight.
my being here means you're a dead man, Wayne Malloy.
I think Dale would be mighty interested in your address.
what do you want, Ginny Dannegan?
well, look who it is.
Hi, everybody.
who is that? This would be Ken.
Didi's fiance.
What?!
what is he doing?
Oh, he's watching an animal show with Sam.
you see, apparently, retards really like animals.
he's not a retard. He's just kind of slow.
you know what, Cal? This is all your fault that he's even here in the first place.
I'm not the one who signed off on your bride price.
I hereby offer my daughter, Delilah, in marriage to Kenneth Dannegan in exchange for a bride price of zero dollars.
you're on clearance.
shut up, Cal. This is not a joke.
they could really hold us to this. - Ginny didn't give me much choice, okay?
you had a choice. You could've told 'em to go to hell.
no, sweetheart.
then Ginny would rat us out and Dale would find us. We had no choice.
I will figure this out. Just give me a couple of days.
you can watch now. That zebra's down for the count.
it ain't the lion's fault.
he just needs to kill.
why does he have to stay with us?
well, 'cause, you know, the fiance always stays with the in-laws in the run-up to the wedding.
it's tradition. - I'm not gonna marry him.
well, it's tradition. That's all I'm saying.
it goes all the way back to the middle ages in Ireland, you know.
it's your heritage.
you should never have signed that bride price, Wayne.
you shoulda just killed Ginny.
look, if you just let me get through the arbitration tomorrow, I will deal with this.
Arbo what?
it's a legal term, Ken.
well, I better learn it up if I'm gonna apprentice with you.
Oh, the son-in-law always apprentices with the father.
it's tradition.
I can blacktop real good.
look, Ken, this is a major corporation.
these are educated people. They have law degrees, they got MBAs.
an MBA is a master's degree in business administration.
you following me?
a degree is a level of-- just forget it, all right?
I guess I could tarpaper the roof.
no, Ken, you nitwit.
this is a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.
nobody is tarpapering anything. Are you clear?
you're not coming to work with me tomorrow. That's not what Ginny said.
she said if she gets mad, she was gonna tell the cops about Mrs. Malloy violatin' her parole.
the word's "arbitration," Ken.
arbitration.
it means a polite argument.
you sure are pretty, Delilah.
Ken, he's gonna eat a warthog.
Oh, cool.
we can't let this thing go to trial.
this woman had her arm eaten by an alligator in her backyard.
if she waves her stump at a jury, she'll get 10 million bucks.
what's the look?
I'm going to Panco tomorrow, I told you.
Oh, Jesus, Dahlia, not tomorrow.
I got enough problems trying to get in there with Ken.
no, I just mean, I really want to try and handle this.
settle it.
you know, arbitrate like a real lawyer.
I'm actually kind of good at this
negotiating, working the numbers, working the angles.
but I can help you.
I got Aubrey for that.
I mean she's a paralegal.
she's got a legal education.
I know what paralegal means!
except, I didn't go to school, Wayne.
I don't have a law degree or an MBA.
did you hear yourself before, by the way?
what am I supposed to do while you are so busy working the numbers and the angles?
sit at home and clip coupons?
you know, as it turns out,
I do not know what a paralegal is, Wayne.
and I don't care!
screw you!
you are turning into such an asshole, Wayne.
like you never been in a street fight or two?
you got traveler blood in you.
you can't just walk away from that.
you can't just wake up in the morning and pretend to be somebody else, like all your traditions don't matter to you no more.
you are spittin' in the face of our people, and there will be consequences.
that is superstitious bullshit.
Oh, no, baby, it's real.
cause let me tell you, sooner or later, someone's gonna figure out who we are.
and when this ride ends, it's gonna crash and burn so hard, it'll destroy us.
so you wanna go for a ride?
okay, but I'm goin' with you.
cause if it ends, ain't none of us ever gonna see each other again.
I have somethin' for you.
holy shit.
read the inscription.
to Esther, love, Frank.
Ginny and I stole it off an old lady in Jacksonville.
Ginny dressed up like a nurse and pretended to take her blood pressure.
meantime, I snuck into her bedroom and picked her clean.
money, jewelry...
I even stole her false teeth.
that's really touching, Ken.
I'd do anything for you, Delilah.
thank you, Ken.
if anybody was ever gonna hurt you...
I'd kill them.
Thanks, Ken.
I really have a lot of homework to do.
remember the night at Ginny's weddin'?
we were all dancin'.
you were in a nightgown, dancin' by the fire.
the light just lit up your hair.
you must've been almost nine, 10 years old.
that was the night I fell in love with you.
Yeah, Ken...
around here, we call that pedophilia.
you have such a big vocabulary.
good night, Ken.
sweet dreams.
you been talkin' to my daddy?
he don't talk.
he's been gettin' better, and you know it.
I heard he's been askin' for you.
I heard Ken and Didi are engaged.
is that true?
how did he find her?
who says he did?
I heard that daddy wants him to lead the family until he can bring Wayne back.
why would I care about that?
cause until Wayne comes back, you'd have all the power, and it should be mine.
did you ever really think your daddy was gonna pick you, Dale?
you know what he thinks you are?
a sociopath.
you ever hear that word?
I heard it on a John Wayne Gacy special.
means you got no conscience.
it means there's something wrong with your soul.
now, earl feels real bad about it, blames himself.
but it ain't his fault. As far as I can remember, you always been evil.
you used to rip the legs off frogs when you was a kid, and then you'd burn 'em.
go ahead, Dale.
slit my throat.
wouldn't that be just like a sociopath?
Ken, once again, you're my nephew, my name is Doug, Dahlia's name is Cherien, what you are is an intern
I thought an intern was like a doctor, except real good-lookin' and on TV.
don't say anything, honey.
okay? You just keep nice and quiet.
school bus is here.
so I should call you uncle Dan.
just keep it zipped, for Christ's sake.
say nothing. Nada. Silence.
God damn it. Such bullshit.
so, you're Doug's nephewfrom Jacksonville?
look, I went over the underwood files last night, and I want to talk numbers with you 'cause I think you got a problem
good, great, yes. Cherien.
Hi.
you look like a million bucks.
welcome to team Hugh.
let me show you the ropes.
Hugh, we gotta settle this before it goes to trial, right?
it's import
Ken, get up.
I want you to staple some things together.
sure thing, Mr. Malloy -- Dan.
shit.
wanna know a secret?
I never had a personal assistant before.
my shrink said I should get one.
she said I can't take care of myself.
you want me to take care of you?
well, my secretary couldn't.
that's why I fired her ass.
anyway, that's why you came here, isn't it?
or did you come here so I could squeeze your tits again?
Oh, no.
I want the 40 grand plus benefits.
bullshit, Cherien.
your husband pulls down 200k a year. You don't need money.
I think you want to blow me.
you're right.
I do.
I wanna blow you so bad.
come on, drop your pants.
come on, drop your pants.
don't be shy.
cause I wanna take a picture of your little ding-dong for my sexual harassment suit.
that way, I'm never gonna have to work again.
Jesus, you're a bitch.
you wanna tell me about that job now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
pick up my dry cleaning, fill out my insurance forms, and find out how the hell ducaine med gets off chargin' $1, 500 for a damn colonoscopy.
well, I don't wanna doany of that, either.
all right.
what do you wanna do, Cherien?
Mmm, I wanna "Fengshui" your office.
no wonder you're sucha miserable bastard, man. You got no flow.
what's that supposed to mean? Your chiis all out of whack.
I bet you got insomnia, nightmares, too. How do you, uh...
how do you know about this Fengshui?
had some time on my hands the past couple of years.
I read a lot of Oprah magazines.
Mm-hmm.
all right.
you break anything, I'll wring your god damn neck.
Hugh, I gotta talk to you about Underwood. They're gonna be herein 10 minutes.
Yeah. Make her go away.
I think we should offer two million, take it or leave it. - What the hell are you talking about?
well, that's one million less than the old lady got from Mcdonald's when she was scalded by the coffee.
and two million more than I'm gonna pay.
Hugh, this woman was gardening in her backyard.
an alligator grabbed her arm, dragged her into a reservoir.
she barely got out with her life.
so?
Mmm!
Agh!
God!
I didn't create alligators.
I'm not god.
no, but you got eight fishand wildlife citations warning you not to buildon an alligator habitat.
so maybe she should've thought of that before she went outside and started all that reckless gardenin'.
some peopleare morons, Doug.
don't ever underestimate that.
Hartley Underwoodis a conniving slut who got exactly what she deserves.
well, that'sa very good point, Hugh, but I really don't think a jury is gonna see it that way.
I know, so tank the bitch.
she got her arm ripped off.
how much more tanked do want her?
what do you want me to do, rip the other arm off?
you see, that's exactly what Stewart said, and Stewartis collecting unemployment.
I am not giving herone thin dime.
and if you can't make her go away, you can kiss your job goodbye.
kimmy, latte, now!
so we got no dirton hartley Underwood?
no, we did a complete background check. Not even a speeding ticket.
but if there was dirt on her, she could'vechanged her name.
get down to city hall, get her marriage license, check for a maiden name, aliases, anything.
there's got to be something.
let me just start by saying how truly, deeply, profoundly sorry we are for this really terrible, unforeseen, devastating
Doug, I don't have time to shovel bullshit.
Absolutely. Neither do I.
in fact, I am keenly aware that time is the only thing that separates us from the wilderness.
I mean, hell, Ann, we are the wilderness.
you know, when you think about it, because manversus nature, that really is a false dichotomy.
Oh, dichotomy my ass. I nearly died.
look at my hospital file.
Jesus, god.
now, I don't think any of us wants this to come to trial, do we?
no, no. No, we don't.
so, really, it's just a question of the amount of money we're gonna settle on.
I'm sure you got a figure in mind.
well, Ann, you can't put a price on suffering.
no, but you can try.
let's just each of us write down a number on a piece of paper and compare.
I think you'll find that our numbers are very close together.
size or distance?
what the hell is this?
that'd be a zero, Ann.
what possible justification can you have for offering my client nothin'?
I stapled my pants.
would you excuse me for a moment?
would you get the hell out of here?
but I wanna apprentice.
go to my house.
apprentice there.
Mr. Rich.
she changed her name from Mary Louise Blodgett.
the old Mary Louisegot busted shoplifting, 1993, $2, 000 worth of items, mostly clothing.
you see how brilliant you are?
socio what?
it means a person who ain't got a conscience.
I didn't mean -- It's okay, honey.
don't you tire yourself out.
maybe you was one of them socio things.
you were tough.
even when you were a baby, I swear, you once bit me so hard on the arm, the tears came.
you had such sharp teeth.
that's what your daddy was tryin' to say to you, ain't it, hon?
you're a survivor, Dale, and that's a good thing.
is that whatyou think of me, daddy?
you think I'm a sociopath?
you can't trust me to run the family?
can't help...
now, the doctor said for you not to stress your vocal cords.
he was just trying to say he worries about you, that's all.
daddy, all I wanna know is, is did you talk to Ginny Dannegan about who's gonna be the next leader?
all right.
that's enough.
he's gonna get overexcited.
now, who told you?
so he did choose Wayne.
it was just they've always had this special connection.
it wasn't personal.
don't take it the wrong way, baby.
it's a real big burden, being responsible for a whole family.
don't feel bad with your daddy for not picking you.
your special connection has always been with me.
Oh, shit.
cops are out.
it turns out Mr. Griswold really was a coke dealer.
the cops busted him right in the college counseling office.
now they're doing a sweep of the entire school.
now how are we gonna flush the weed, huh?
forgot your lunch.
Thanks, Ken.
I seen you at Delilah's.
I'm Ken.
I'm Didi's - uncle.
uncle Ken is my uncle.
right...
and Doug is my uncle, and Doug is her dad...
so we're also brothers.
I guess our daddy married our--his half-sister.
I'm also her fiance.
okay. Uncle Ken, can I talk to you for a second?
I think that boy think she is your boyfriend.
Ken, this is all part of our cover, okay?
aren't you supposed to be with my dad today?
he got a hair'cross his fanny 'cause I messed up his stapler.
you know that this is all some big test, right?
to see what you're made of?
is that so? Absolutely.
well, I can passany test he can set.
you should do that.
see you at home, Didi. Okay.
your uncle gave you this? He got it from a vending machine at the halfway house.
what?
shit.
Ken, I realized that I forgot to thank you for bringing me my lunch.
it was very nice of you.
okay.
that's all.
well, I hope the sandwich didn't get too smushed.
I think it'll be fine.
well, bye.
see you, Didi. Bye.
Uh-uh.
not so fast.
let's see that purse, little lady.
I'm short 800 bucks.
in my office, now.
I wanna know why you're really here, and don't give me any of that cockamamie shit about Fengshui.
What'd you really come here for?
I wanna screw you.
I wanna see your arm. No, no, no, no, you don't.
no, you wanna get it on over there by the moose.
come on!
kimmie, get me the ducaine police. I want to report a robbery.
no, no. That's all right, kimmie. I'll handle it.
what do you want?
pills?
went me to hook you up with some oxy, a little meth?
wanna shoot up? Hmm?
hard to ask, isn't it?
sometimes that's the worst part, how degraded you can get.
I want to knowhow you did it, how you got clean.
cause you did, didn't you?
tell me how you stopped usin'.
Oh, my god.
I get it. I get it.
Oh, god.
you want-- you wanna quit for Doug, and you want me to help you.
Oh, ain't that romantic.
don't you dare laugh at me!
okay, okay, okay. Jesus.
was it A. A?
get your fingernails out of my balls.
huh? You tell me how you got off pills!
I don't know. I don't know.
you're a lyin'son of a bitch!
God is my judge, I do not know.
it was the nineties. My dealer O.D.'D.
I just -- I stopped. I don't know.
Oh, god!
you're the craziest bitchI ever met.
what does that mean, we've all done things we regret?
I just mean that everyone has things in their past that they wish were different.
for Panco, this could be some of our locations.
for Mary Louise Blodgett, that could be felony grand theft.
what? Oh, you know.
one Gucci dress, one leopard print belt, three bras, five pairsof ladies' underwear, hmm...
and $627 worthof assorted sex toys.
does that ring a bellor a buzzer, Ms.Blodgett?
you asshole.
give me that.
no, that would be stealing.
I assume you are aware of your client's felony conviction in 1993 under the name of Mary Louise Blodgett.
that was 15 years ago.
so my client was a little light-fingered when she was younger.
how is this relevant?
well, just from my experience, it really affects how the jury sees you, you know, uh, the peers in the community.
I was going through a really hard time, and it was my first divorce.
and you must tell that to the judge.
and when we go to the trial, you gonna wear that suit?
nice suit. Looks good.
is that a thousand bucks or so?
got the receipt?
Oh, I win a cookie.
you stole that jacket?
old habits die hard.
I lost my arm!
an alligator dragged me into a swamp!
I am under a great deal of stress.
it is terrible when a client violates your trust, isn't it, Ann?
you god damn lawyers are all alike.
this is a despicable tactic.
you will not intimidate my client.
Oh, just make it go away! I don't care what it takes!
now, honey, you don't mean that. You're gettin' overemotional.
but I must say, we are prepared to discuss how to make it go away.
we'll be in touch when my client is feeling a little more rational.
it's all right, DI.
it's okay.
you are a genius.
who knew the gimp was a shoplifter?
well, yeah, don't get excited.
she'll want something. She'll be back.
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
well, you do. You said you weren't gonna give her one thin dime.
Oh, what are you, nuts? I was just shittin' you, pal.
I got a paper trail comin' out of my asson this thing.
I knew I was gonna be out a million easy.
it's just that I got a little cash flow problem right now.
I thought you were worth 150 million?
on paper. Real money?
housing market's in the toilet. I'm mortgaged to my eyeballs.
I was shittin' a brick I was gonna have to file chapter 11.
but now I got time to raise some funds.
look at me.
look in my eyes.
you are the best god damn lawyer I ever met.
Hey, hey.
where the hell you think you're goin', little lady?
Oh, this place ain't right for my employment needs.
whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on a minute.
Doug, Doug, if you don't mind, gonna have a little tete-a-tete.
sure.
who the hell took my gold pen?
my grandmama gave me that pen when I graduated high school.
I can help you.
just so you know, I'd never dream of mentioning that little incident to Doug.
it's just between you and me.
see, 'cause I'm guessing that, uh... that, uh...
Doug don't know you're still poppin' pills, does he?
you're a real bastard.
no wonder you have nightmares.
see there? You see, nothing a little raise couldn't cure.
give me a minute.
you have a good meeting?
knocked them down over a million.
she cried. She did?
Oh, baby. You'rea real good lawyer, huh?
you got her good.
Oh, sorry.
interrupt the romance.
a little petty cash.
for? Expenses.
come on.
I hear Johnny Walker callin' our name.
so where shall we go?
club.
Oh, hi, Dan.
Hey, I'll come with you.
and you might be?
your name is also Doug.
there can be more than one Doug.
gulf war.
he was captured and shot.
can we take separate cars?
no problem. I got a coloniclater anyway.
I'll meet you at the club.
God bless America, Doug.
can I ask you a question, Mr.Malloy?
sure, Ken.
were you a virgin when you married Mrs. Malloy?
Jesus.
well, I take ityou're still a virgin.
if you don't countself-pleasurin'.
I want to ask your professional opinion about something.
can we get a body in here?
sure.
look.
you're right.
Hey!
should I just wait in here?
I'm gonna take this one, too.
you were right about it.
sure do make your titties look nice.
I guess I'll have to take all this, too.
would you give me one of them shirts? I'll take one in every color.
Oh, hell, I'll wear that.
uh, you want me to put this on your credit card?
Oh, my boss is payin'.
I got me, uh, one of them expense accounts.
Wow!
I should really change jobs.
these people don't give me jack shit.
Oh, um, you lost your pills.
you want 'em?
there you go.
official membership form.
once the paperwork clears, you're a member of edenfalls country club.
welcome to the world of social cachet and influence.
you're gonna make so many connections, you won't even mind paying 175, 000.
175, 000... dollars?
take a second on the house. That's what I did.
welcome to the inside.
wanna know a secret?
I'm gonna tell you my secret. The secret of my success
trust no one.
you gonna make it in this world, you gotta make it alone.
I don't havea lot of friends. You got a lot of friends?
no, not really. Yeah, me, neither.
I don't have any friends.
I'm a lonely mother.
why do youthink that is, Doug?
probably 'cause you're an asshole.
Mm.
how come you don't have any friends, Doug?
I--I don't know.
moved around a lot when I was kid and never got in the habit.
I feel you.
you trust anyone? No.
you trust Cherien?
Yes.
Yes, I trust Cherien.
lucky bastard.
I trusted my ex-wife.
the bitch poisoned my kids' minds against me.
what's your secret, Doug?
how do you keep a marriage from falling apart?
twelve of us, Doug.
so poor, I swear to god, we only have one light bulb.
you'd had to unscrew it and take it with you when you went into the next room.
shit.
I would lie awake at night, my whole family asleep in the bunk beds, and I'd have a vision of a day I'd be so rich, I wouldn't ever have to see any one of those filthy dickwads again.
I never told anybody that.
everybody thinks I grew up rich.
my mother left me when I was four after my dad died.
let it out, man. Let it all out.
I've never told anyone that.
let it all out. Come on.
I tell everyone she's dead. Well, she is dead to you.
I was brought up by Jesuits, and then bandits, a pack of bandits.
never think about your mama?
I don't know. Maybe she's here.
maybe she's right here in edenfalls.
ever think about that? No.
daddy, Didi got arrested.
after the first hour, I started to see colors, and then I saw the face of a lion.
I said I was sorry.
dad, hey. Where have you been?
I've been calling you for hours.
I just think you could give me back the pen.
I think you owe me that.
just go over there and sit down.
okay, where is she?
they locked her in a cell, and they won't let us see her.
see the woman behind the desk?
okay, she took Di's fingerprints.
they're gonna give her a permanent record, okay?
shit.
if they run her record through the database, they're gonna come up with the real Doug Rich's license.
okay, Doug Richis all over the internet.
you know how much time you can do for identity theft?
vehicular manslaughter?
okay, Cal.
she will not geta permanent record.
parole violation, practicing law without a license.
I said I will deal with this.
I don't want to go to a foster home.
you will not go to foster care, okay, sammy? I promise.
nothing bad'sgonna happen to you.
I'll never let them take you away.
nobody is gonna split up this family.
okay?
are you--are you drunk?
a little bit.
shit, dad.
I'll take care of this.
are you the one that booked my daughter, ma'am?
because I'm sure you're familiar with Malloy Versus the state of Louisiana.
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
the prohibition of marijuana use -- hi, what do you want, baby?
what?
are you all right?
mom's on her way.
excuse me.
when you were out there, did you see my husband?
What'd you do?
seven unpaid parking tickets.
No! Dad.
God forbid, Richard should have to interrupt his conference call to bail his wifeout of jail.
what a colossal dick.
dad.
I didn't know you smoked pot.
it wasn't mine. It was Ken
some kid hid it on ken, and I had to take it from him, because there's no way he could've done this without blowin' us all to hell.
so you threw yourself on the grenade?
Aw, baby girl, I'm so sorry.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
I love you so much.
I know that, dad.
I love you more than all the world.
all I want is for you to be able to do anything you want to do.
for the love of god, dad, go find the bathroom and splash some water on your face.
okay, honey.
I love you.
I know.
Richard's never in his life told our girls he loves them.
right in here, ma'am.
he was a tall man.
who was? My assailant.
the fella who stole my purse.
Oh.
he was a tall, thin man.
dark hair, bushy eyebrows-- ah, eyebrows.
small eyes.
small -- crooked teeth.
okay, hang on, hang on.
gotta get these in.
you know, you want this to be good?
was it sunny?
mom!
Oh, hey, baby.
so dad's here.
he's fillin' out some paperwork.
Oh, shit.
Mrs. Rich?
Hello, officer.
I can't tell you how sorry I am about all this.
I--I have the 800 cash for your clean and sober program, and there is also a little something there for your police retirement fund.
um, I'll take you to her.
I think she's learned her lesson.
and it seemed like he was kind of retarded.
retarded? Why didn't you say he was retarded?
it happened outside the station just 15 minutes ago.
Hey!
Oh, um, the eyesare a bit weird.
you have a go.
I got started.
his wife is here. She posted bail.
time passes slowin there, don't it?
it's like it stands still.
my friend Kay, she used to sing to me to make the time go.
you know what she'd sing? What?
Jesus loves me, this I know for the Bible tells me so little things to him belong they are weak, but he is strong
we'd look up, and what do you know?
five minutes'd be gone.
that's how you break the day up, in little pieces like that.
well, I ain't heard that song since I was a little girl.
paperwork's done, free as a bird.
not you.
tell Richard I won't forget this.
it's okay, baby.
dad!
where were you? Where's Ken?
he walked home about 15 minutes ago.
you'll be glad to know we feel no need to put this on her permanent record.
you know, with you all being so willing to enroll her in our program, there's plenty of hope for her to be rehabilitated.
well, thank you so much.
Mr. Rich seems a little stressed, if you don't mind my saying.
thank you.
baby, you were magnificent in there.
totally smooth, calm.
above it all, like a queen.
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this anymore.
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
honey, stop humming.
Oh, that was wonderful.
lars Mortensenand the Alpine Cloggers.
you know we certainly can't get enough of the folk dances here.
next up, the Kriek sisters.
please don't go away.
Hey, daddy, the nurse called.
says she's gonna be a little late.
what the hell are you watch in'?
day nurse put this on?
lame-ass polka shit.
you must be sick as hell of bein' cooped up in here all day.
you must be dyin' for some fresh air.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't tire yourself out.
I got you.
it's cold tonight.
look at them stars, daddy.
how come you can see the stars better when it's cold?
when I was a kid, I used to think that stars were made of ice.
do you remember that?
we'd go camping, and you'd let me pretend we were Indians.
you gave us Indian names.
you were big elk. Remember what you used to call me?
that's right.
I was little bear.
we'd set up our tent, and you'd tell me stories about the ridge runner.
crazy Indian who lost his tribe and he would haunt these woods, scalping little boys.
and after you went to sleep...
I would lie there so scared.
I never made a sound 'cause I wanted you to think that I was so brave.
all I ever wanted to do was to make you proud, daddy.
I'll always be your brave little Indian.
I love you, daddy.
and I will carry you in my heart till the day that I die.
good-bye.
last season on "the riches..."
now, who buys a house on the internet?
a rich man.
what about his job?
what about it?
someone's gonna come looking for him.
you gonna tell me no one's coming through them doors tomorrow?
I don't know who's coming through those doors tomorrow.
okay, I'm confused. I don't get it.
what's the angle here?
how are we bleeding them?
we're not bleeding anyone!
Oh, we're not?
then what are we doing here, dad?
the American dream.
what?
we're gonna steal it.
Hi, I'm Doug. I'm Doug. I'm Doug.
Doug.
meet your new team.
Panco team, meet your new legal chief.
come and meet our new neighbors.
I'm Jim. This is my wife, Nina.
andrea said we should introduce ourselves.
how do you do?
I'm Mrs.Doug Rich.
haven't you read Calder V. Bull? - Yeah.
Yeah, have you read Hester V. Strapeling?
Ratson V. Catson?
you are the best goddamn lawyer I ever met.
dad, we have to do something. Dale came here for us.
he's not going anywhere.
Dale seems to have been here for a while now.
he could have blown our cover at any point. He didn't.
why is that?
he's Dale. He's working an angle. I don't know.
we have a lot to talk about, my friend.
Doug is a republican. His best friend is Pete.
Pete's a mortgage broker from Dallas.
he's e-mailed twice about a golf trip.
hello.
I-is, uh, Doug here?
Doug who?
guess you're probably surprised to see me here, Wayne.
you and I both know though everyone here who are you?
and where the hellis my best friend, Doug Rich?
I don't like wild berry.
Yeah, you do. You do. - I do?
you like it. Okay.
okay.
got about an hour.
it's Hugh.
we don't have time for Hugh.
Hey, man. Can we talk? - What?
Hugh, it is 4: 00 in the morning.
she locked the doors on me.
we got to go!
we had this fight.
I said some stuff.
I called her names.
Pete is not dead! He is asleep!
we do not have all day!
she said I was the saddest person she ever met.
she didn't mean that.
she was upset.
we are heading out!
I'm sitting here telling you I need you.
I'm on my way.
Oh, dear lord.
what happened to you?
I won't ask.
Oh, Nina.
I won't tell.
I know.
I just wish...
wish I could come with you.
I just wish I had the guts.
Mr. Rich?
Mrs. Rich?
everything okay up there?
please, help me!
you're...
that guy in the truck.
Yeah. I'm a handyman.
where are we gonna go -- Mexico?
I vote Canada.
it's too far, Di. Come on.
what do you say, baby?
wherever we go, we got to go right now.
mexico it is.
sorry, Didi, I could do with a Margarita.
so, this, uh, Doug and Cherien, the Riches?
you've known them for years?
they're real?
or they were.
and these people, wherever they are, they took over their lives.
information like that you could really hold over somebody's head.
you could use that to get some serious green.
you mean blackmail them?
are you out of your mind?
I don't want money! I want my friends!
we got to go to the police, have those two arrested.
I have to find out what they've done with my friends.
Oh, my god! What am I doing here?
what's wrong with me?
they're getting away as we speak.
no, they're not going anywhere.
distributor cap's gone.
shit!
great, what the hell are we gonna do, you guys?
that's got to be Dale.
that guy's probably awake by now.
no. It's okay. It's okay.
it's okay 'cause, um...
cause your dad has a plan.
are you coming?
Oh, god.
Yeah, Pete, I'm coming.
let's go for a little stroll.
you don't have a plan.
well, not at the moment. - Aw, shit.
we got to get out of here. Come on.
how much money we got? - 7 grand.
7 grand?
your dad fakes it as a lawyer for three months and all we got to show for it is 7 grand?
calm down. There's nowhere to run to.
Wayne, we got to get out of here.
if Pete wakes up, calls the cops, we're gonna get busted for killing the riches.
okay, this is what we'll do --I'll go back to the house.
I'll get the Mercedes, come back and pick everyone up.
no, the house could be crawling with cops.
I'll take that risk.
Wayne, Dale could be waiting for you anywhere.
Yeah, well, I'll take that risk.
Sam's gone.
Sam? - Wait, wait, wait!
baby, what the hell? - I have a plan.
okay, what's your plan, sweetheart?
where did you get this?
in the woods where you buried it.
I want to give it to Pete.
you're gonna bribe Pete?
you had this all along without telling us?
I was saving it for a rainy day.
Oh, my god.
when uncle Earl died and your dad had to break into Hugh's office so that Dale wouldn't kill him, that wasn't rainy enough for you?
not as rainy as this.
you're gonna bribe Pete?
no, you can't bribe Pete, sweetheart.
you can't bribe men like Pete.
not with this.
why not with this?
money makes the world go 'round.
every man has his price.
okay, good try.
go wait for us in the RV.
all right. Get in the car.
what's wrong? Get in the car.
I want you to grab the kids, get the hell out of here.
I will meet you in Galveston.
Wayne, get in the goddamn car.
I'm not going, baby.
got the 40 grand and the 7 grand we saved up.
I'm gonna talk to him.
like Sammy said, money makes the world go 'round.
Wayne, he's a little boy.
you're a grown man.
there's things you want, and there's things that are.
you got to know the difference.
I have to try.
baby, you can't bribe Pete.
don't you get it? He's honest.
baby, then I will buy you a little time and get you closer to Mexico.
Wayne, get in the goddamn car.
if anyone's going to prison, this time it's me.
no, Wayne.
baby.
where are you, Pete?
Pete, you okay?
rough night, huh? - Go shit yourself!
Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete, you okay?
where is he?
I love this part.
mm, I spilled a little bit on your bed.
really nice bed. It's very soft, pillowy. - Pete?
Pete. Where are you, Pete?
what did you do with Pete?
woman: The mailbox of the subscriber you are trying to reach...
Pete who?
I'm just pulling your leg.
you're talking about your buddy, right?
you're talking about your buddy Pete.
where are you, Pete? Pete!
you're really gonna want to -- you're really gonna want to see this one.
Yes, sirree.
is that, uh, you, Doug?
is that you and your lovely wife?
what do you want?
what do I want?
I want to sit down and formulate a little plan.
blow it out your ass.
so what did you do? Did you kill them, Wayne?
kill them, move into their house, start living their lives?
Pete? - Is that what you did?
you stole their names?
did I kill anyone. - No.
Where's Doug and Cherien, huh?
where the hell are Doug and Cherien Rich?
I got all the cards, Wayne.
I'm holding all the cards, and you're holding none.
so...
what do you want to do?
where is he?
screw you.
it's just a little blood. Calm down.
right now. Where is he?
put that thing away. - Where is he?
look, Pete's alive.
he's just a little hurt, but he's fine.
bullshit.
he was gonna go to the cops.
I had to stop him.
I did you a favor.
I did you a favor!
Wayne, wait. I did you a goddamn favor, Wayne!
where are you go -- I did you a favor!
what are you doing?
none of your damn business.
do you think I'm stupid?
do you think I'm a moron?
well - - look, you ain't gonna find him.
he is safe and sound, tucked away. - Yeah?
the mailbox of the subscriber you are trying to reach is full.
shit.
Hey, man.
man, wake up.
come on, come on! Wake up! Wake up!
you -- you killed him.
I just -- I hit him, and then -- but he fought back. He
you murdered him!
no, I did -- I did you a favor.
you murdered him!
you were in a shit storm, and I swept up all the shit.
back up, Dale.
you owe me a big goddamn favor, Doug Rich! - Oh, yeah?
just back up. - What are you doing?
getting the hell away from you!
I will call the cops.
I will call the cops on you. - I don't care!
they will think that you did it because people saw you with Pete.
well, call them, then! Go on, call them!
I will tell them
I will tell them that you killed the Riches.
just go ahead and do it, goddamn it!
Oh, shit.
Jesus.
Hugh. - Shit.
help me get him in the house.
come on.
all right, mama. Mind your head.
get your foot in. Here's your blanket.
what are you doing?
it's my stuff. - Take that back.
come on, mom. I actually bought this shit.
well, you should have robbed it 'cause we're only taking necessities. Go on, Di.
if you ask me, you never should have let him go back.
well, I'm not asking you.
Yeah, mom, it's bad luck.
don't say that!
mom, it's bad luck.
we work when we're together. You know that.
well, we're not together, okay?
your dad is a stubborn ass.
we have to wait for him, mom. - We have to go back for him.
don't you think I tried?
okay, look, I know you're scared.
this is what we do.
we can do this, all right?
we split apart, we come back together, we go on the road
this is how we live our lives.
have you forgotten that?
go on. Go close up the RV. Let's go.
you can't take all those books, sweetheart.
how many can I take?
well, none of them. I mean, we're fully loaded up.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
we don't need these damn ffer clothes anyhow.
go on. Don't tell your brother or sister.
easy there, speedy. Man.
you got to keep your eyes on the road, mom.
eyes on -- eyes on the road, mom.
watch it!
shit. Sorry.
what the hell is that?
mom, what is that?
Oh, shit. Nina?
I changed my mind.
as it happens, I do have 'em.
have what?
the guts.
Nina, sweetheart, you can't come with us.
my life's in shambles, Dahlia.
my future's bleak.
my marriage is bust.
I mean, look at me.
do I look like a woman with something to lose?
I guess not.
mom, we can't.
Cal, get in the back.
come on.
get in, gypsy rose Lee.
sorry, grandma. Come on, Sammy.
you don't need all that space for your little butt.
what's wrong with Justin?
don't move. Just keep -- Hugh?
keep this against your head, okay?
Oh, Justin's blessing.
who are you?
I'm Doug Rich.
your friend.
then why did you try to kill me?
I didn't know you were there, Hugh!
bullshit.
no, I was just back-- I was coming to see you!
that's really bullshit.
you never even asked where I wa-- Jesus!
who the hell is that?
Hey, there, Mr. Panetta.
Doug, what the hell's going on?
Hugh, this is Dale.
he is a local handyman.
he's just helping me around the house.
at 4: 00 in the morning.
we had a spillage.
okay.
okay, just stay here.
man!
we have been acquainted, Mr. Panetta, at your wedding.
that's a sweet ride you have out there, the Denali.
Yeah.
Vortec, 6.2-liter.
I'm gonna have one of those one day
if I work hard.
that's what I tell myself.
whatever floats your boat.
help you out.
whoa, easy. Easy. - What?
your hands. - What?
they're kind of dirty.
so?
so, I don't like it.
germs. - Little germ never hurt nobody.
no, I said don't to -- Geez!
tell him not to touch me!
get away! Get away from me!
Oh, man!
morning, officer.
is this your vehicle, sir?
it is. I am so sorry.
well, you realize that it's illegally parked up here on your lawn.
I know. I know.
I needed the bathroom so bad, I just...
well, I'm sorry to bother you at this time of night, sir, but we just can't have this.
I-I understand.
this is no bother at all, officer...
Delroy. - Del Roy.
I'm, uh, the new co-head of edenfalls security.
well, it is very good to meet you, officer Del Roy.
I am Doug Rich.
so you will re-park the vehicle?
Absolutely. I will.
the key's inside. I'll just
when?
it'll be done. I will do it right away.
Cal: Car sounds awful.
mom, it's getting worse.
you got to pull over.
we can't stop.
cops may have an ABP out on us.
the car is bleeding antifreeze, ma.
okay, would you just stay with me, please, children?
we're gonna pull to the next town.
we're gonna dump this piece of shit, and Cal's gonna steal us a new car 'cause that's what he does, and that's what we do.
mom, I really don't want to go to Mexico.
you're gonna have to goto Mexico, sweetheart, because it's either that or prison.
so, adios, amoeba.
let's freaking cucaracha.
so, Doug is not a lawyer.
he isn't even Doug.
his name's Wayne.
and you're Dahlia Malloy?
that's right.
and the kids?
kids are Malloys, too.
then who are the Riches?
I don't know.
you mean you never met 'em?
Didi: We just stole their credit cards, Nina.
we're not their best friends.
so you're con artists.
that's right.
some kind of identity thieves.
uh, yeah.
we're drifters, Nina.
we are grifters and drifters and nomads.
we are the scourge of the goddamned earth.
we are travelers! Right?
Oh, don't make mama sing! Come on.
would you please sing with me? We're living large, man.
we're on the road. Come on, goddamn it. Sing.
shit.
and there she goes.
nice. That's good, mom.
Oh, shit.
I should have stopped earlier.
Bobby Mcgee what the hell's going on?
just -- just be calm.
keep that ice bag against your head.
don't you tell me what to do.
you keep your dirty hands away from me.
shut up, Hugh!
don't you tell me to shut up!
you shut up.
car keys. - What?
give me your car keys right now.
hold on. I...
shit.
you lost your car keys? - Oh, no.
shit. Shit. It's...
no, it's - - you looking for this?
Yeah.
fell out of your coat while you was unconscious.
thought I'd keep it for safekeeping.
Thanks.
Tussey custom-molded grip.
matter of fact it is.
fact it is. Sweet.
okay, car keys now.
quickly!
so, Dale...
know your Tussey, huh?
Yeah, I know my guns.
I can't find the keys.
I'll move it first thing in the morning.
is that your vehicle, too?
Yes, that is.
you got a busted taillight there.
Yes. Fender bender.
with the Denali? - No.
well, you can't drive around like that.
I know.
you want some help with it?
no, no, I'll be fine.
they probably got some replacement bulbs in the trunk there.
I believe they do.
but I'll -- I'll be fine.
well, you sure? - Yeah.
it'll only take a second.
I like to do those things myself, you know.
it shows you're the man about the house.
what's that?
what was that?
well, that sound.
was that an owl?
sounds like a cellphone.
Oh, that's --that's my cellphone.
in the trunk? - Yeah.
well, aren't yougonna answer it? - No.
well, it's 5: 00 in the morning.
it could be important.
not at 5: 00 in the morning.
my kids, they did this.
that's where they hid it.
well, okay, it's none of my business. - I've been looking for it all day.
the kids, they just -- my eldest
I just can't deal with him. He just does this.
well, it's none of my business, sir.
you have a good evening.
thank you very much, officer.
that was a gunshot.
that sounded like a loud cough.
I have to investigate this, Mr. Rich. - I don't even have a gun, actually.
I know who it is.
it's my friend, and he has
look, I have to do my job, Mr. Rich. Step away from the path, sir.
I can't do that 'cause I pay your wages, and I know my rights here.
step away from the path now, sir!
I will not do that.
step away from the path, sir!
I cannot do that.
that
I tried to tell you, Dale.
Tussey's got a hairline trigger.
sure does!
who the hell are you?
sir, I have reason to believe there was a gunshot.
Nope, there no gunshot.
sir, I heard a gunshot.
now, are you the owner of the - - who the hell are you?
Hugh, calm down.
this is officer Moody -- officer Delroy Moody.
security. He's not even a cop.
sir, I'm gonna ask you again.
where is the gun?
shut up.
don't give it to him, Dale.
I think your friend here is a little drunk.
he's trespassing!
you tell him,go home.
shut up, Hugh.
sir, let's just try to be responsible here.
Hugh: He's got no power.
he's a rent-a-cop.
he is bullshit!
now, be a man and tell him to go home!
sir, please.
you heard the man.
go home.
Jesus, Dale!
I didn't say pull the gun on him.
Dale, give the officerthe gun, please.
I said, go home.
sir, I can't go home.
I am on duty.
this is my job.
if I see alcohol and there is a gun involved,
I'm required by law to confiscate the gun.
well, come get it.
no, I said -- I said come and get it, bullshit man.
put the gun down, Dale.
you make me.
just how do you want this to end?
do you want to take him out, too?
do you want to go to prison, or...
do you want to be my partner?
just how much blood do you want on your hands?
50-50.
okay.
okay.
blunt, huh?
I don't like the smell of this town.
all right, Blunt's what we got.
we're gonna get a car, and we're gonna get the hell out of here.
mom, I'm starving.
I could use a shower!
honey, you got a bug in your hair, okay?
come on, girl.
a normal breakfast is all we're asking for.
I'd just like to point out that if you hadn't have got rid of the toolbox, we wouldn't be in this mess.
I had to take it out for Sammy's books.
you should have spoke up.
grandma looks tired.
I think we need to get her something to eat.
God, when did you kids become so soft?
mama, y'all want some pancakes?
mama?
mama, talk to me.
is she dead?
mama? Mama.
Cal, put her over thereon that bench now, honey. Be careful.
mama.
okay. Here we go.
you're all right. - Mind her head.
Oh, mama, please don't die.
is she breathing?
I can hear her heart.
di, you hear her heart?
Yeah. It's just faint.
we got to take her to the hospital.
hospital.
Delroy: Mr. Rich, I have to report this to the police.
a law was broken.
officer Delroy, please call me Doug, okay?
I just want to sayone thing.
you know who that man is over there?
well, like I said, I'm new here.
well, he is Hugh Panetta.
I mean, he made all this.
Doug, with all due respect, god made all this.
no, no, no, no. All -- all this.
this. The edenfalls.
hugh Panetta -- his company carved out and created this community of edenfalls.
I mean, you got him to thank for your job.
well, I suppose, technically, I did trespass on your property.
well, that is --that's a legal situation you got yourself in there
I know. I'm a lawyer.
but I still have to turn in this gun.
well, then you turn the gun in.
you keep it in the bag. It's safe there.
well, Doug, for your information, I am not bullshit.
it is my job to keep this place safe. - I know.
and I'm gonna do it.
thank you. Thank you.
thank you so much.
screw him.
I got another one.
wayne: Okay.
we got to get you back home.
I can't go home!
my heart's broken, Doug. I lost my wife.
what did you do?
tried to give her this ring.
and I was all excited about it, too.
I wrapped it up. I stuck it under her pillow.
she didn't like it?
she liked it.
God! What's your problem then?
she didn't love it.
that's what the problem is.
how do you know she didn't love it?
the eyes. I could tell.
something in the eyes, you know, when a girl's lying to you, she's trying to be polite.
I said,"baby, you don't love it."
why are you lying to me?
and she's all, "dreamsare complicated, Hugh."
perhaps she was telling the truth about the ring. - She's lying, Doug.
I know what lying is.
so I asked her, politely, notto lie to me and to be happy!
I mean, she Jiggy danced in Vegas for a living.
now she's living in a house on a hill.
I'm making her dreams come true.
least she could do is be happy about it.
so she cried a little, said she was happy.
and I guess I sort of took the ring and just stuck it on her finger.
the ring didn't fit. It's too small. I drew some blood.
she called me a monster, saddest man she ever met.
so I pulled it off and threw it in the toilet.
I think it broke.
the toilet?
the finger. Anyway...
she's in pretty bad pain. I tried to call 911.
she kicks me out on the street.
how'd you get the ring back? - What?
from the toilet.
what's she mean -- "dreams are complicated," Doug?
Oh, god. I don't know.
maybe she meant, you know, now that she's got the house on the hill, she doesn't want the house on the hill.
then why'd she marry me, then?
maybe she married you for who you are.
who I am is a guy with a house on the hill!
look, you busted her finger!
you want to apologize, get down on your hands and knees.
you crawl and you ask for forgiveness.
then you get some time off and you take a vacation.
mm, no. No, I can't.
you can't crawl on your hands and knees?
no. I can't take a vacation right now.
Hugh, just take a vacation, okay?
can't. I can't. Come here. Come here.
take a look at this.
bayou hills, Doug.
we can't pass it up.
Hugh, there will always be another deal.
no. There's not gonna be another bayou hills as long as we live.
that's why I came over here to talk to you tonight.
no, you came over here to talk to me about your wife.
her too. Here. Look at this.
Christ.
right. Sweet. Excellent.
sweet?
it's the deal of a lifetime, Doug.
the state took our bid.
we're all-in.
we're not calling. We're not raising.
we're all-in!
five days to raise the money.
this goes through, panco makes $150 million.
I make 1/3 of that, and you cash in on a baker's dozen -- $13 million, Doug.
$13 million?
well, um...
your mother's heartbeat is very faint.
what's wrong with her?
calm down, ma'am.
she, uh, has arrhythmia.
now, that's either from heart disease or she's dehydrated and drunk.
has she been drinking?
No! Of course not!
you're sure of this?
not that I know of.
cause she reeks of alcohol.
no go?
can I see your I.D. please?
Yeah. Hold on.
well, there we are.
can you hear me, sweetheart? Mrs.Uh
Morgenstern... - Morgenstern?
Mrs. Morgenstern, could you try to sit up for me?
it's Dr.Morgenstern.
Oh, is she a doctor?
I want a large Cadillac.
everyone does, dear.
does she have dementia?
we think.
you think?
uh, we're sure.
how was she diagnosed?
Alzheimer's. - Dementia.
well, they're...
Yeah, there was a big debate going on among the doctors who treated her.
so many... things in here.
there we go. Yeah.
thank you, Miss Prestwich. - Of course.
just never know who's spending your money these days.
don't I know it.
how old is your mother, Mrs. Prestwich?
she's 78.
let me see. Yes, uh...
your daughter says she's 91.
well, that's incorrect.
all right, then.
I'm gonna need to admit your mother to Blunt presbyterian.
what? She's just drunk!
ma'am, you don't know much about your mother's health.
you gave her alcohol.
you barely know how old she is.
now, if anything, that's elder abuse.
you saying I abuse my mother?
do you know how old your mother is?
I beg your pardon?
do you know how old your mother or wife is?
do you know about their health affairs?
when was the last time your wife had a pap smear?
well, as a matter of fact -- I don't want to know that.
that's not the point. I love her.
how dare you accuse me of elder abuse! I'm outraged!
you just calm down, ma'am.
your mother is coming with me, and she's coming to Blunt presbyterian.
you just wait here a moment, and I'll be right back.
son of a bitch. White coat.
say I don't love my mama and take care of her. I'm a good daughter.
have you -- have you used that card recently?
um, you know, I don't know. Maybe not recently.
Yeah. That must be the problem then.
I bet they froze it for security.
ma'am, please.
I really just want to get my grandmother treated.
that's why you should give those visa folks a call.
the card's dead.
Oh, shit. Shit!
if they froze Prestwich, they froze them all, huh?
I guess. Probably.
Hey, you got any cards?
uh, I-I-I left them.
I left all my credit cards and cash.
you ran away without a penny? - Yeah.
Why?
I thought it would be more fun.
you know, kind of live off the earth.
okay.
you got to get cash. Okay.
all right. Pay with that.
find out exactly what medications they need for her. - Okay.
screw Blunt presbyterian.
she just got to get rehydrated. Okay.
y'all want to live off the earth, now's your chance.
I can't believe grandma was drunk.
she wouldn't even let me have a sip.
she drank that whole thing of whiskey. - I know.
that's, like, amazing.
what's going on here? - Football night.
Oh, that figures.
everything all right here, folks? - Great. Thank you.
you ordered too much.
so what? We'll just take some of it with us.
we don't have the cash, Didi.
we just had to pay for mama. We're going on the road.
we got to pay for gas and drugs for her.
whatever you haven't started, we're sending back.
I need my steak and eggs.
Cal. - Ma.
Cal. - Ma.
I'm gonna get up. I'm getting up. - Don't you
don't you -- I'm warning you!
I'm going to the bathroom.
he's sucha little bastard.
can I eat my steak and eggs?
that's nice. That's real nice.
you robbing old ladies now, hmm?
feel good? Do you feel good?
that was a shitty thing to do.
let that be your "comeupponce."
mama, I think the word is comeuppance.
what are you, the word police?
you shut your pie hole.
wrap that steak in a napkin. Go steal me a car.
don't you look at me like that.
can I come?
no, sweetheart.
Starsky don't need no Hutch.
you all right there, ma'am?
are you sure?
I thought I had $40.
Oh, sweetheart. I know how that is.
here you go. Don't you mind that.
Jesus!
you scared me to death.
I just want to see how it's done.
which way, Doug?
which way to the light?
just through these doors.
I can't talk.
I'm with him now.
this goddamn town is giving me the creeps.
let's get mama and get out of here.
Wayne? - Partner.
we said 50-50.
I love you.
I love you.
well, okay. I love you. Where are you?
I'm at the house.
Where's Pete?
we are in this together.
did you really think that spiking my scotch would lick me?
Pete's fine. Everything's all right.
everything's all right.
well, everything's all right.
man: Just where do you think you're going?
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
this is my van.
Hey, hey, the gang's all here.
get out of the car.
I am talking about a certain dead body festering in the trunk.
I know what you're talking about, and I am dealing with it.
so why don't you get out of the goddamn car now?
this ain't your car, and that ain't your house.
and I don't know Doug Rich, but I'm assuming he, too, is in a festering condition. Am I right?
so, you rat me out, I rat you out, vice versa and so on.
mutually insured destruction.
we're in this together -- two peas in a pod.
mutually assured destruction, you asshole.
that's right.
mutually assured.
mutually insured to the bitter end.
so, Douglas, what's the plan?
I'm sorry. - You wanna pretend to be the dead guy?
you want to wear his suits, and you want me to be to his dead wife?
do you really think dad has a plan?
he stole the money, ma lost the money, and now we're here in a dead guy's house.
how'd y'all get in the front gate?
we live here.
why are we gettin' a bill from Mountain View Nursing Home for $4, 700 a month?
must be where Cherien's mother is. - Come on, ma, - we're getting out of here. - It's Cherien's mom.
does it matter?
if my husband's gay?
it doesn't matter to me.
well, you're not his wife.
school bus is here!
Oh, him?
Aw, got yourself a buffer boyfriend.
Aw, Jesus Christ, chunky! - What's wrong with you idiots?
shut the goddamn door!
I wanted to be a partner, but there is my partner lying on the ground.
something about it makes me sick to my stomach.
I'm not lying, Wayne. I told you, I'm off that shit.
I was gonna flush it!
how big a supply is this?
a month? A week? - No, Wayne! No! No!
are you tryin' to blow this whole thing to hell?
how do you like it, watching someone you love self-destruct?
I've messed up your whole life.
all I ever wanted was a messed-up life with you.
baby, you gotta get up.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby. You gotta get up, go to work.
what?
Yeah, let me see.
meth hangovers are the worst. Just the worst.
you know, you gotta drink a lot of water. Come on.
you still got your job at Panco, baby. - Don't want it.
Hugh's an asshole. - Yup, he is.
now,
I was up all night, and I've been thinkin'...
I've really been screwin' things up since we got here, you know?
and, after yesterday, Jesus,
I can't do this anymore to you and the kids.
this life we got here is a good thing.
I think we just gotta take it on, you know? Make it our own.
Really? Sure.
now, you know what else I've been thinkin', Wayne?
we need to get us some Ishka.
we need to clear all the shit out, do a cleansing, all of us together.
remember? Like that time in Kentucky, when we went in the river with all snow on the rocks?
now?
I'm sure there's a cold river around here somewhere.
no. - Yeah. Cleansing baby, cleansing.
now?
come on. Let's just do it.
the school bus is gonna be here any minute.
mom, you know, I got a math quiz today. I can't just go jumpin' in a river.
sorry. - It's library day.
I gotta return my books, otherwise, I can't get new ones.
banana. - With a bit of vanilla yogurt.
okay, let's just do it later then, all right? We'll do it after school.
OK, ok.
look, we got to deal with the whole Dr. Morganstern situation, 'cause you really miss all your friends at the home, don't you, mama?
she doesn't miss her friends. She likes it here.
can we talk about this later? - We're gonna have to talk about it eventually because, you know, we can't keep her.
Hey! Give me that, you jerk!
give it.
it's Eric. He wants to know if you're wearin' the shirt.
what's "the shirt"?
Eric bought them both matching shirts. It's very cute.
they are not matching, Cal. They're similar.
you're such an idiot.
I thought we had to get to work.
what's wrong with you?
he's such a dick, mom.
don't mind him. I think it's nice you got a friend.
you do? - Yeah. It means you're - gettin' adjusted to this place. - I guess.
Hey, I want to show you somethin'.
I'm through with it, see? I'm through with it, all of it.
wow, that's great, mom. - No, no, I mean it.
I'm... I mean it. - Okay.
cause I don't want you to feel like you got to protect me no more.
it's not fair, and, you know, I'm gonna do it myself.
whatever you say, mom. - School bus is here, Di.
gotta go. Bye. - Okay.
Hugh's not back yet.
what do you mean, he's not back yet? Where is he? What's he doing?
he told Kimmie he was at the mortgage brokers convention in Reno, but when she called the hotel, he wasn't registered.
shit.
he just called and fired Larry in legal.
called him a sniveling dickhead. He cancelled his company credit card.
you know what? He did the same thing to Sabrina in accounting.
you're kidding. - And now he won't even answer his phone.
does he do this often? - Not since I've been here.
it's kind of freakin' everybody out. - Did you hear about Hugh?
I just did. - Maybe he's having a nervous breakdown.
I had a professor who did that once, he ended up naked on the Golden Gate Bridge.
what if he's under investigation by the FBI or something?
let me tell you something, if anything goes down,
I ain't taking the rap for Hugh's shit.
is Panco going under? - No, of course, it isn't.
I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. Now, everyone, just go back to work.
I'll go...
make some calls.
you know what's going on here.
Hugh's on a meth bender. - Wayne, the man is an animal stone-cold sober.
God knows what kind of mess he's gonna make for himself.
I know, we gotta do something. - Well, these people are panicked.
they need leadership.
you want to be a partner?
that white one.
well, this is what you want, ain't it?
is it what you want?
long as we're here, if we're gonna stay, might as well commit, right?
so there it is.
as of this moment, I am in control here.
what are you, General Haig?
I'm the chief financial officer. I've been here seven years.
you, what, seven minutes?
what, uh, makes you the boss?
well, Mason, these partnership papers that I have signed with Hugh.
may I? - Absolutely.
so this is the situation. Hugh, at the moment, is in a clinic, where he is undergoing intensive gestalt therapy, designed to purge himself of all of his abusive behavior, which we all know about.
this is a good thing, and he'll be back very soon, hopefully better.
thank you, I welcome your question.
I welcome all your questions.
in fact, my first act as a partner is to institute an open-door policy.
come to me with your questions.
just come on in, let's have a chat.
things are gonna go a little differently around Panco from now on.
I talked to Hugh last week about taking tomorrow off. I've got finals.
no problem, Aubrey. Your dreams are my command.
great. I've got crim pro and real property, and you know what a killer that's gonna be.
what? - Oh, now that Larry's been fired, you're gonna have to take over his cases until we hire someone new.
anything pressing?
nothing much. A few contracts, pending settlements.
Oh, you are going to have to go to court tomorrow on the Oxenberg case.
court? - It's a hearing. It's not a trial or anything.
a nuisance suit against Panco, a little discrimination thing.
how little?
hugh intentionally blew the sale on a house in the Paradise Grove development.
the couple is claiming discrimination.
on the basis of what? - They're gay.
Larry filed a motion for summary judgment.
Aubrey, quick snap test.
summary judgment, which means we are going to try to...
get the suit dismissed.
you will. That is, I'll be gone, remember? Finals?
Hey, I got an idea.
call Larry. Tell him new boss in town. He's got his job back.
Larry is too pissed to go for that.
in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's filing termination suit as we speak.
well, I am excited by this, but, uh it's not my specialty, you know?
I'm a securities lawyer.
don't worry.
Larry's done all the work. All you have to do is show up.
with your experience, it should be a piece of cake.
piece of cake.
I don't get many guests over for dinner.
I used to be real popular in high school, but, lately...
I don't know, must be the arm.
I bet you were a cheerleader in high school.
I was. How'd you guess?
well, now, what about you? What were you in your teenage years?
I used to start a lot of fires.
I'm kiddin' you. I was football, quarterback.
now, see, I knew it. You got that look.
I'm sorry to keep you out here. He just...
he doesn't allow anybody in the house while he's watching "Jeopardy!"
I think you're pretty. - Excuse me?
I said, I think you're pretty, Hartley.
be careful now.
know what I'm gonna do for you? Gonna do all your landscapin' for free.
I'm gonna cut them shrubs over there.
Oh, God. - Is your cake done?
no, that's him. I can't hire you, Dale.
you need to go.
he can't keep you in a gilded cage. - Oh, you wanna bet?
I got the prenup from hell.
Hugh's had it out for me since the day I was hired.
well, that must be difficult, but let's look forward.
he threw a cell phone at my head once because he spilled a glass of water on his own desk.
that's not good. Um...
what can we do to make Panco better for you, Greg?
I'd like my own office. - Right.
and an assistant would be nice.
all right. Well - we'll see what we can do. - Really?
Panco does not have to be run by fear.
we can do better than that.
smile, grandma.
this'll help bring some glow to your face.
you seem like a winter.
let's try some pink.
you have very pretty eyes, grandma.
see, when you accentuate your best features, you feel better about yourself.
I sure do.
banana.
I won't let them take you away in a van.
if they do, I'll hotwire a car and come and get you.
I'll take a large Cadillac.
no, Marcy. I know it was a bad divorce, I do.
hugh always spoke very fondly of you.
what can we at Panco do for you?
a parking space with my name on it.
better "hold" music.
healthier snacks in the vending machine.
other companies give their employees parking spaces all the time.
Really?
a longer lunch break 'cause I barely have time to eat my yogurt.
that seems reasonable.
I know he's an asshole.
no, I'm not sayin' he's not an asshole.
he's just an asshole who I've got to find right now, so I was wondering if you could...
no.
just with my name. It doesn't have to be too big, just little.
staff meetings, 'cause we're supposed to have weekly staff meetings.
I mean, what happened to them?
and...?
a damn parking space.
well... That was pointless.
all right! Oh, Jesus!
well... What's pointless?
talking to these people.
whatever happened to hopes and dreams?
they have no vision.
their lives have become so narrow.
they're just working to work.
Wayne, it's pretty hard to have hopes and dreams when you're just tryin' to survive, you know?
OK.
okay, let's see the timeline. Death of Louis XV.
may, 1774.
all right, King Louis XVI crowned.
june, 1774.
Hey, there.
nice shirt.
Thanks, dude.
okay, Eric, let's, uh... Let's keep going.
king Louis XVI tried for treason and monarchy was abolished.
1792, and that is when Marie Antoinette lost her head.
you know, it's close, but, actually, it's in 1793.
Hi, Di. Hi, Eric.
hello. - Hey, mom.
you want to stay for dinner?
I would, but I gotta go.
I told my mom I'd be back at 5: 30.
wait, I thought you're gonna help me with the reign of Terror, baby.
you know, it's my weakest thing. You were gonna quiz me.
I can't. I got my dad's car.
well, I can quiz you. I love history.
that's okay, mom. It's fine.
no, no, it'll be good. Here.
what was the initial impact of the death of "Lewis X-V-I"?
"lewis X-V-I" that's a good one.
what?
no, never mind, mom. It's no big deal.
it's cool.
Why? What's funny?
well, it's "Louis the sixteenth,"
but, I mean, don't worry about it.
come on, Eric, I'll, uh, walk you out.
see you later, Mrs. Rich.
Bye, Eric. - Shut up, Cal.
well, Lewis, Louis, who gives a shit?
he's a buffer prick, ma.
gay money, straight money, what difference does it make?
well, let me try to clarify that, Doug.
five families decide to buy houses in a cul-de-sac in Paradise Grove.
five churchgoing families, who want to create a family-value-oriented community in which to raise their kids.
so...? - So, they're in escrow, okay?
one day, they look over, and they see two women.
two women in khakis and penny loafers, shakin' hands with the realtor in front of the sixth house of their little cul-de-sac.
khakis and penny loafers?
it's not that they don't like gay people, mind you.
they just don't want them living next door.
so, let the churchgoers move somewhere else.
well, the problem is, is... Greg, please.
the problem is we've been just as much a victim of the downturn in the housing market as anybody.
the houses in Paradise Grove just aren't selling that well.
we've used some bullshit collateral to get our last loan from the bank, and the only real source of money to repay those loans is from those five homes in escrow.
and while you're thinking about it, put this in your hat and smoke it...
all our loans are cross-collateralized.
if one loan fails, the whole house of cards folds.
meaning, Panco.
that's right, my friend.
so, you ask me what the difference is between gay money and straight money?
in this part of the country, Christian money begets Christian money, and gay money puts you out of business.
Hi, Nina. - Hi, there. Come on in.
I didn't know you did pottery.
Yeah, um, started as a hobby. Now it's sort of taken over my life.
Oh.
Oh, hi, Cherien. Uh, this is Wes. Wes, our neighbor, Cherien.
Oh, so she's the one... - Yes.
we're on our way to the market. Need anything, Nina?
no, thanks.
well, we'll see you later.
nice to meet you.
they're making a bouillabaisse for dinner.
he seems all right.
Wes? Oh, he is.
real nice.
good cook.
so, - he and Jim are... - Friends, yeah.
for some time now, it seems.
and you're all just hangin' out together?
Jim and I have been doing a lot of talking since your dinner party, Dahlia.
I guess you could say we've come to an understanding.
neither of us wants to downscale at this stage of our lives, and there's Zinny to think about, so we're sharin' the house.
that's about all we're sharing.
well, I do not know how you are doing it.
no.
I got a problem, Nina.
with this? - No.
with Didi.
I don't know how to talk to her anymore.
I don't understand. It's weird.
when they're little, they just kind of look up to you.
they just want to dress like you, be like you.
I mean, people used to call her my little twin.
and now she doesn't want to have nothin' to do with you.
well, I'll tell you one thing.
I sure as hell don't have any answers.
Zinny hasn't been out of her room except to go to school since she turned 13.
she is a real bitch.
most days, I just leave her alone.
it's either that or kill her.
Oh, god.
I got a big stack of books if you want to read 'em.
maybe you'll have better luck than I have.
is that...
it's a lighthouse.
nice job, Di.
what, Cal? - What?
you've turned into a total buffer asshole. That's what.
Why? Because I actually study?
I don't give a shit if you study.
well, what do you think we're supposed to be doing here, - Cal? Robbing houses? - No, Di, I think we're supposed to be wearing matching shirts under our uniforms and thinkin' we're better than everyone else.
I do not think that I am better than anyone else, Cal.
I'm just trying to get along here. Maybe you should try that.
maybe.
well, I may not know so much of law, Mr. Feller, but I know what's right and what's wrong, and I know what you're asking is wrong.
thank god.
where are you? - I don't know.
somewhere in the desert, I'm guessin'.
right. Well, are you okay? I mean, everybody's worried.
Doug, did you know that Muslims fast for the entire month of Ramadan?
get this...
no, I didn't know that.
look, I gotta talk to you about the Oxenberg case, okay?
get this: it's not just food they give up.
they give up all sensual pleasures and...
Oh, thank you, Tarquin.
sex and, you know?
so... - Carnal stuff.
so let me get this straight...
you are in the desert with some Muslims?
no, but I am fasting... I think.
and it's brought me a shitload of clarity, too.
here, listen to this...
the candle is not there to illuminate itself.
is that heavy or what?
extraordinarily heavy. Okay, look, Hugh.
Doug, buddy. - No.
you're my only friend.
you're the only one that gets this sickness we call life.
okay, listen to... Listen to me, Hugh...
I'm feelin' a little... I gotta go.
Doug, I'm getting a little dizzy here. - No. Hugh.
Hugh, Hugh, stay with me!
God damn it!
Hey, how is it goin'?
fine.
good. That's good.
what are you doin'?
well, Di, I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
if you want to talk about anything, if you feel like sharing.
sharing what?
just talking, lettin' me know what's goin' on in your life.
I don't feel like it.
well, you know, what I'm hearing now is that you're not in the mood to talk about it right now.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
okay, well, you know what? That's too damn bad because I have somethin' to say to you Delilah Malloy! I don't like the person you're becomin'. You're turning into a mean, nasty little bitch.
and that is not the person I raised!
the person that you raised?
you were in prison.
I was in prison for two years. I never stopped being your Ma.
I took care of everybody...
dad, Sam, Cal.
and now you, what? You want to come back, and you want to be the mom.
I think it's a little bit late for that.
you know what your problem is?
it's that you're just scared.
you're just scared that I'm gonna be better than you, that I'm gonna go to college, mom, and I'm gonna be somebody.
I gonna be somebody that you could never be.
bullshit.
you know what scares me?
how quickly you've become one of them buffers.
it's "those" buffers, mom.
you have completely lost touch with what's important.
look at that guy you picked.
he is nothin' more than a haircut and a shit-eating grin.
I love him.
Oh, you love him?
what does that mean to you? - I'm sleeping with him.
without a blessing?
you're a real little buffer now.
Congratulations.
since its inception nearly 15 years ago, Panco Properties has had a history of community-building and family values.
we sell to families...
it's what we do.
we sell to all kinds of families: red, yellow, black, white.
are you really gonna say that?
well, I was thinking of.
that sounds like some kind of bullshit to me, Wayne.
what's that got to do with anything anyway?
well, what am I supposed to say?
this is about discrimination. We do not discriminate under the law.
a gay couple has complained that Hugh and Panco have refused to sell them their house because they are gay.
now, here is the thing:
gay people are not specifically protected under the Fair Housing Act.
hugh can absolutely refuse to sell to them and not be breaking any laws.
are you gonna stand there and tell me that that's okay?
Absolutely. It's completely legal.
but, no, no, I mean, it's not okay, but in this state and in the whole country, as it is, gay couples are not protected under the constitution.
well, they should be. - Well, that's not the point.
the law is on Hugh's side. I can win this.
so you're gonna walk into court tomorrow, and you're gonna defend Hugh's right to be a total flamin' asshole?
Yeah. That is what is so great about the law.
well, that makes you an asshole, too, Wayne.
excluding people? Oh, my god, are you kidding me?
what if that was your child, huh? What if that was your son?
you are no better than Hugh.
well, if I don't do it and Panco collapses, what are we gonna live on?
air?
so this is it, huh?
the American dream.
what happened?
this morning, you were all gung-ho about me stepping up for Hugh, making a commitment, showing leadership.
well, maybe I changed my mind.
maybe I thought you were gonna be better than Hugh.
I am better than Hugh. I have already made a difference.
honey, I'm just doing my job here.
and, you know, we should all be pretty damn glad that I can do it because it is not easy.
I gotta go into a real courtroom tomorrow, argue in front of a real live judge.
you know what?
I think I'm gonna do okay.
what is the point if all you're doing is buying into their buffer bullshit?
it is not all black and white.
not all buffers are bad.
Oh, really?
well, I'm real glad you think so 'cause your daughter's sleepin' with one.
so, Di...
here you go, mom.
you're not Doug.
and you're not my mom, but we're having fun with pancakes, aren't we?
so, baby?
Yeah, dad?
got enough money for lunch? - Yeah.
Yeah, you gave me $10 yesterday, remember?
right, right, right.
okay. I gotta go get ready. Thank you for breakfast.
okay. Di?
dad, we only did it once. We used protection. I don't know how I feel about it, okay?
okay, okay, great.
good talk.
that wasn't so hard.
don't know what I was worried about.
I made some calls.
anyone I know?
well, I had a chat with Didi.
it seems she and Eric had sex once, and she used, uh, you know, birth control.
it made me feel better.
we had sex when you were 15.
we were married, Wayne.
we were in love.
she didn't even talk to us.
she didn't get no blessing.
I have no idea who that girl has become.
well, she's living here now.
if we were living back there, she'd probably be married to that idiot and pregnant.
is that what we want?
baby, you're taking this too hard.
Didi is still Didi.
no matter what she says or doesn't say, she still needs you, and I need you, too.
I got the whole of Panco in my hands. I can't do this without you.
well, I'm still here, ain't I?
Where's Aubrey? I need Aubrey. - Finals.
right. Damn.
anyone hear from Hugh?
no, but there are some people waiting in your office.
who is waiting in my office?
I think they said their name was "mockingbird."
Doug, Doug, I know you promised Greg his own office, but I actually have more seniority than he does.
all right. Well, you get an office, too.
we don't have the space.
all right, well, no one gets an office. - What?! That's bullshit!
I'm Liz Oxenberg.
Yes, that Oxenberg.
hello. - This is Max.
Hi, Max. - Hi.
Gwen doesn't know I'm here.
she'd kill me if she did.
I just wanted to see the face behind Panco.
well, I'm hardly the face behind...
you know, I didn't even want that piece of shit house originally.
it's too small. The construction is crap.
it doesn't have much of a backyard.
so, why...
because it's all we could afford on both our salaries, and it's in the best public school system in Ducaine.
we wanted that for Max, even if it meant we had to live next door to a bunch of homophobic bigots.
they didn't even give us a chance.
we're not worthy of their cul-de-sac.
guys like you are lucky.
you will never experience what that feels like.
see you in court, Mr. Rich.
come on, Max.
can I talk to you, Doug?
now is not a good time.
I sit next to Tony, as you know, and, lately, I've noticed he's been making a lot of personal calls.
long distance personal calls. I just...
write it up, and we will talk about it later.
well, I just know Hugh wouldn't like it.
Ashleigh, try Hugh's cell number again, and keep trying until he answers.
and then?
and then I'll talk to him, sweetheart.
What?!
was Greg just in here ratting me out, just because he's pissed about the whole office thing?
what a friggin' wuss. You know what you need to do, Doug...
what I need to do is work!
so what I need you to do is to get out of the goddamn office, Tony!
all of you, stay out of my office!
I am working!
Hugh, I have to be in court today! Do you have to be in court today?!
thank you!
just stay out...
well, didn't take you long to turn into one of them screamers?
they won't leave me alone.
I'm just sayin', Wayne.
you're scarin' me.
I got him.
he's on line one. - Thank you.
what do you want, Doug? Tryin' to relax here.
Hugh, you still with the Muslims?
what the hell are you talkin' about?
I've gotta talk to you about the Oxenberg hearing today, okay?
Yeah, you know, the Paradise Grove thing?
Oh, the carpet munchers.
what's the problem?
pretty clear-cut case, ain't it?
well, yeah, legally, absolutely.
clear-cut case, but...
Jesus christ, don't start with the morals crap.
you're a lawyer. You don't have morals.
Oh, not my face, too, darlin'. This stuff smells like shit.
no, hang on. - Here's the point on this Oxenberg thing, it's just business. It ain't personal.
I don't have a problem with gays, but... Here, look at it this way.
you paid a shitload for your house, right?
Yeah. - Right, right?
well, you want to look out the window and see a bunch of guys french kissin'
or havin' some kind of naked pool party with your kids around?
shit, no. I pay that kind of money for a house, I don't want to live next to somebody I don't want to live next to!
it's my right as an American citizen.
but I have met the Oxenbergs.
they have a kid, you know? They're harmless.
Doug, I sell that house to them, I lose millions of dollars. End of story.
I gotta go. This nice girl's gonna finish wrappin' me up here.
Hugh, just...
you don't have to do this, Wayne.
dahlia, you don't understand.
Hey. What's up?
Hey, Di. - Hey.
gettin' some gum.
eighty-one cents.
out of ten.
there you go.
I really don't want all this change, man. I'm sorry.
I mean, you can probably use it more than I can.
you mind if I give you 10 ones for a 10?
whatever. - Yeah?
Thanks. I really don't want to carry around a lot of bills, you know what I mean?
you know what? Um, I'm not thirsty. Let's just...
let's go. - What? I am.
let's get back. - Wait. Hold on. What's...
what is the rush?
you gave me too much, dude.
Oh, shit.
I'm an idiot, man. I'm sorry.
is that witchblade? I love witchblade.
I'm more of aspawnguy myself.
Spawn's for freaks, man.
I'm sorry. I'm holdin' up the line. I'm talkin' too much.
here, why don't I just give you this for the 20?
is he doin' what I think he's doin'?
you know what? I don't care. I'm not gonna stick around to watch this.
come on. - Thanks.
Thanks, man. - All right now.
next.
where are you?!
there was a man.
what man?
I made some calls.
what's wrong with you?
with what?
why did you short count the sales guy? You don't need the kale.
just keepin' up my skills, Di.
you could have been arrested.
you did it in front of Eric.
I did it in front of Eric?
Eric is clueless.
he knew exactly what you were doing, Cal.
luckily, he just thinks you're a total asshole.
good. This is who I am. I'm all right with that.
fine.
you know what? Be whoever you want to be, Cal, but don't screw this up for me.
these people...
your boyfriend, the teachers, the neighbors, I don't get it. Why do you give a shit what they think of you?
because I like them, Cal.
OK.
how many of them will be there for you in the end?
when it really counts, Di, when all this goes to shit?
not one.
you know, I used to look up to you, and now I don't even know who you are anymore.
you don't know who I am anymore?
I'm not the one who's changed, Di.
I'm not the one who's turned my back on my family 'cause I'm ashamed of who I am.
all rise. Honorable judge Pearline now presiding.
OK.
in the case of Oxenberg, Thomas v. Panco inc.
your honor, Douglas Rich for the accused... For the defendant.
may it please the court.
your honor, state and federal laws prohibit discrimination on the base of race, religion, and gender.
however... - Let me stop you right there, Mr. Rich.
your honor?
I have read your arguments, Mr. Rich, and you are right. They don't have a case.
your summary judgment is granted.
case is dismissed. Bailiff, what's next?
that's it?
you won your argument, Mr. Rich. Do you want a medal?
case number 0-2-7-0-5-9-5, Atkinson v. Layton.
what are you doin'?
don't you know I fired you?
I don't need to get paid.
well, you can't just put plants in my yard.
I told you, Everett doesn't like me having friends.
then we won't be friends.
Dale, you need to go.
I think you're a treasure.
I'm gonna call the police on you. - Go ahead.
I'll call my husband.
God, you are beautiful.
I am gonna paint your house from top to bottom.
please go.
you want me to go?
or do you want me to move in?
Everett hears everything that goes on in that house.
I think he's got cameras.
I think he's got me bugged. - Then I'll move into the pool house!
I'll be discreet.
Dale, you are really cute, but I think you might be crazy.
I'm gonna be your handyman.
I'm gonna come in real handy.
his back is broken. - Broken?
but, apparently, only enough to put pressure on the spinal cord.
the only way to remove that is to operate.
then why haven't you? - I thought you understood.
he may not be strong enough to survive it, and, under the circumstances, I couldn't assume the responsibility without your consent.
what are we gonna do with you, ma?
there was a man. - There's always a man.
one of life's tragedies.
we fall in love, then we have to deal with all the shit that comes with it.
now, wait a minute.
I'm not going to be held responsible if that boy dies.
why do you think Cherien turned out such a bitch?
was it 'cause of you?
was it somethin' you did or didn't do?
I feel like a crap mother most of the time.
I was two years in the slammer, did a lot of drugs, did a lot of bad things.
I ain't gonna win no good parent award, you know?
I love my kids more than the world...
but no one told me how to do it.
boy, I wish you could tell me how.
I've been clean two days.
I guess that's somethin'.
I'm lockin' up now, sir.
right, officer.
what's this?
it's a cup of tea.
I thought it might help if you were gonna be up late studying.
Thanks, mom.
trust don't come easy, Didi.
I know that better than anyone.
I can wait.
mom?
I never slept with Eric.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't know how to be myself here, Wayne.
sometimes I think I do, then it all gets messed up.
I mess it up, and I end up blamin' everyone.
in camp, there are rules, traditions.
it just kind of makes sense.
but now that we're here...
I don't know what the rules are.
neither do I, baby.
neither do I.
I guess we're making them up as we go.
I was thinking...
you still want to find a cold river somewhere?
cause I do.
it's not exactly a river.
those rocks aren't even real.
it's all we got.
how'd it go in court today?
I won.
I'm sorry.
what I mean is that I sympathize with you, Master In-ho.
a young man at his prime years has found his first love, but it turns out that it can never be.
poor So-oak.
she's only a young girl.
who'd want to become a concubine without ever falling in love?
thinking about what I was like at her age.
I truly feel for her.
madam.
your heart certainly has no bounds.
I'm moved at your compassion for a mere concubine.
all women long to be happy.
a woman knows what a woman feels.
I'd been thinking about whether it is right to let innocent So-oak live as a concubine for the rest of her life.
let us think of a way to save two young people from getting hurt.
but Madam,
I think I must leave this carriage now.
it is very painful for me.
painful?
well, you see...
Oh dear!
when did this get so big?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
what shall we do?
the porters will be back any minute.
master, we have a problem.
lady Jung packed her things at dawn, and left for her home in Kanghwa.
I will write a letter and deliver it to her at once.
madam, you could order me hanged and I'd have nothing to say.
keep this a secret between us.
I, too, loved someone before I married my husband.
it was a puppy love and my first, but I couldn't even let it show.
he was someone I wasn't supposed to love.
so I ended up in a marriage I did not want.
I tried to forget about him, thinking it wasn't fate.
but to this day I regret it.
so how could I not know how you feel?
madam...
I deeply sympathize with you, coming here so young to live forever in this confinement.
so if you wish to continue exchanging letters with Master Kwon,
I will keep it a secret.
do you really mean it, ma'am?
let us keep it between us women.
Yes, of course.
she didn't accept the letter, let alone read it.
servants say she meets no one, and only comes out for walks.
in her free time, she embroiders and reads books.
but I've discovered some new information.
a while ago, a woman visited Lady Jung, and spoke very badly of you, calling you a woman-chaser, and warned her to be careful.
who the hell was that woman?
lady So-oak's mother.
well, it seems I'm going on an unexpected foxhunt.
do not be alarmed.
you know who I am?
Yes, sir.
you are Lady Cho's cousin.
my cousin has spoken very highly of you.
but why are you here with such a sad look on your face?
it's nothing, sir.
shall I guess what it is?
let me see your palm.
give it.
goodness, how did you know?
I heard from my cousin.
she told me to give you some help.
lady Cho...
and I too am on your side.
our evil custom of women forced to be concubines must end.
to clear any misunderstanding,
I will help you write a letter.
Oh, will you really, sir?
Yes, of course.
come quietly to my room tonight.
there may be watchful eyes, so bring your shoes inside.
promise.
did anyone see you?
of course not, sir.
well, shall we begin?
I have written something on my own.
would you like to see it?
this won't do.
how can I put it?
you're too apologetic.
but it was my fault.
a woman must not apologize even if the fault was her own.
men don't like that.
then, how should I...
I will dictate to you what to write.
but, sir...
what?
is there a problem?
I have a bad habit from childhood, and must lie on my belly to write.
that's no problem.
it doesn't matter to me, so write however you'd like.
now, first let's make your predicament a bit more dramatic.
say you'd rather die than become a concubine, but your parents forced you.
men his age are naturally rebellious to their parents, so he will easily side with you.
let's see.
start from this line.
and then,
I took your first image into my heart.
I knew it must not be, but as falling rain fills the lake, so was my heart filled.
I really like this part.
falling rain fills the lake...
do you?
continue.
we mustn't let the flow stop.
though I should have emptied my heart,
I could not help myself.
you see, you blamed everything on this poor guy, but you don't apologize for it.
if for this incident...
uh, sir...
keep writing.
if for this incident, I cannot see you ever,
I will bear no resentment.
because in my heart Master Kwon will always be the way he was at our first meeting.
why are you doing this?
I will scream if you don't stop.
look over there.
who will blame me when they see those?
whether you scream or not, do whatever you'd like.
master, you amaze me.
whether it's great or small, if a man has set a goal, he must take equal care in order to fulfill it.
it surely is tough to enter the Gate of Chastity.
So-oak.
what is the matter this morning?
did you have a bad dream?
Oh, no, ma'am.
I just feel a bit ill.
is it because of Master Kwon?
no, ma'am.
look here.
what is there that you and I cannot share between us?
nothing's really the matter, ma'am.
but, you look so uncomfortable the way you're sitting.
my cousin wished to see you yesterday, so did you?
of course not.
I mean, yes, I have, but nothing happened.
did something happen between you two?
he said he'd help with my letter, and told me to come to his room.
to his room?
then...
then he...
Oh no.
so he did more than just help you with the letter.
what shall I do, my lady?
Oh goodness.
why didn't you fight back?
I didn't know what was happening.
and it was my decision to go there.
this is a catastrophe.
your heart is with Master Kwon, your body with Cho Won, but you'll be marrying Lord Yu.
madam.
servants will hear us.
will I now be banished?
banished? Why?
someone has to know to banish you.
but I'm the only one who does.
my lady.
since you are to be a concubine anyway, and you already have a man to love, then why not another man to sleep with?
is it really all right?
you are so helpless, my dear.
no one knows, so who's going to blame you?
had I not met you, madam,
I don't know how I'd ever live in this world.
common people do not know this, but all the ladies of nobility have a secret lover or two of their own.
is that true?
then what about women's duties told from the books?
books are books, but reality is different.
just as a woman's reality is to wed a man she doesn't love.
everyone does it, and everyone knows it, but no one speaks of it.
Oh my.
do you have a lover, madam?
shush! What nonsense!
and from now on, call me Sister.
can I really?
Oh, how will I ever repay your generous love?
I searched the whole mountain for these.
thank you so much.
but you've never tinted your nails before.
and summer is almost over.
I just want to look pretty.
Oh, my lady.
it's done.
I hope it lasts until the first snow and brings me love.
sir Cho Won.
Ah, yes, you are...
lady So-oak has told me in her letter that you will be our strong supporter.
it is really nothing.
I don't know how I can repay you.
I look forward to your guidance, sir.
come to me any time you need help.
I will, sir, and...
may I ask you to give this letter to Lady So-oak?
surely.
you are quite a fast learner.
Really?
am I doing that well?
I'm sure Lord Yu will be very happy.
that you are so well trained.
it's all because of you, sir.
indeed.
practice is always important.
by the way, just how old is Lord Yu?
I suppose he must be nearly forty.
then he's an old man.
he's older than my father.
so you must learn well, and make him happy.
isn't it far better than to live with your mother's nagging?
well, it is, but...
since my cute little bird seems a bit sad, shall I tell her a fun story?
what story?
what is it?
your mother once had a lover.
Really?
it was when your father was in China.
she was so taken with her lover that when your father returned, she still clung on to him.
but her lover eventually left her.
it's all over when a woman starts clinging to a man.
never do such a thing.
understand?
but how do you know this story, sir?
because that lover was me.
Oh my!
my goodness.
I don't believe it.
what a coincidence this is!
you're quite right.
I guess this is what you'd call a strange karma.
I got it!
I've caught it, but what can you say about today's fortune?
yellow means good luck, and white means bad luck, am I right?
then, this means that we'll have both good and bad luck today?
so that's Gangway.
raindrops are falling, sir.
let's hurry. Yes, sir.
madam.
you have a guest.
I do not know what his business may be, but since I'm alone here, bid the gentleman away.
but, the master has traveled so long in the rain, and he is drenched all over.
so...
you are dismissed.
Yes, ma'am.
madam.
why are you so thoughtless?
you come here knowing my parents-in-law are away to avoid the plague.
what can I do to make you stop?
I will stop.
I've come only to say good-bye.
though I'm the eldest in a wealthy family,
I am nothing but a scoundrel.
I have done nothing meaningful to this day.
and it is an outrage that a low-life such as me should seek your love.
you know that is not the point.
I know I do not deserve your heart, but thinking you are my last love,
I've committed such disgrace.
I will leave tomorrow.
in the vast lands of China,
I will lay down my loneliness and pain.
and you will from now on never suffer on my account.
if by any chance, you do have any last words for me,
I will be staying at a temple nearby.
No! No!
is there a man as weak as I?
I mustn't.
master, why don't we leave now?
I'm telling you, Lady Jung will not come.
be patient!
she will come.
you are here!
you have come!
I have come to tell you something.
I have come because...
let's go over there.
where are you taking me?
where people can't see us.
madam!
please do not get me wrong.
I have come here because on account of a mere woman, you will jeopardize your...
my boy, come here!
escort Lady Jung to her home.
we're going back to Seoul.
has something happened to you?
he let me...
he just let me go and left.
it shows that he did not think of me merely for fun.
I knew all along that I'd feel this way.
why did I not take better precautions?
why was I so confident that I could control such feelings?
even if you do succumb to them, do not lose pride in yourself.
you did try with all your might to keep your chastity.
never forget that.
I'm a fool.
I knew so little about love.
I can't...
I can't erase him from my heart.
what should I do?
this night I am sleepless thinking about you.
no, sounds too desperate.
what took you so long?
master Cho is here, madam.
go to your room.
Yes, ma'am.
haven't you gone too far for your revenge?
that girl is so exhausted all the time.
I'm only doing my best as always.
she should easily conceive a child at her age.
I think I should visit Kanghwa again.
victory is within my reach.
Congratulations.
a trapped tiger is bound to be fierce, so be careful.
just prepare a fitting reward for me.
I prefer a lot of perfume.
madam, So-oak's mother is here.
don't be so surprised.
it is only my cousin.
I've heard so much about you, madam.
so you will become in-laws now.
pleased to meet you.
I shall get going.
Ah, by the way.
your daughter is very clever.
she must take after her mother.
how have you been, my lady?
madam, I am very sorry.
I tried to stop him, but he just barged in.
leave us alone for a while.
are you still not glad to see me?
I've rushed all the way here hoping to see you again.
the proud woman, who believed she could resist me, has finally been conquered.
she gave me all that she has.
that gate that was so firmly shut opened at my fine touch.
she was like ice on the outside, but inside she felt so good.
with other women I used many techniques to maximize pleasure.
but with her, I felt like I was flying through the clouds.
it was a strange experience even for myself.
I reached the peak so many times. I felt true ecstasy time and time again.
what I experienced was a complete oneness.
the joy of lovemaking outlasted the sensual pleasure.
it was for me the first time.
and so I concluded for now by vowing eternal love to her.
in fact, for a while, I even felt I was sincere.
can such irresistible pleasure like this be possible?
but there is one sad piece of news.
although I should be hurrying to you to receive my reward,
I shall be a few days late.
I don't think the pleasure with this women will last very long, but as you yourself well know, pleasure is most precious when we are immersed in it, and for now I can't help myself.
sincerely, with everlasting longing for my cousin,
Cho Won
she just never had a man before.
chastity, please.
have you been to Beijing?
why do you ask?
I've read Yonam's My Journal to China.
it says Beijing's biggest market spans 27, 000 units of land.
I wish I could go there some day.
there, we could say we're married, and no one will say anything.
how can a delicate woman travel such a long distance?
there are two kinds of meeting in the world.
one is that of the king and his men.
the other is that of a man and a woman.
now that I have that precious experience of meeting you what is there that I cannot do?
why do you look at me so?
alright, we shall go.
master, you have stayed so long this time.
have I? How long has it been?
you even forgot the days going by.
it's already been ten days.
so aren't you going to paint your affair this time?
I don't want to for some unknown reason.
no doubt, you've finally met your woman.
a match made in heaven.
what?
do I look like such a fool?
Nah, you're a different kind.
watch it!
the poet Sudongpo said he is sad with the end of each Spring, but that Spring pays no attention and leaves.
many autumns have passed me by, but never have I had an autumn I might dearly miss.
but this fall, being with you has taught me what it is to miss fall.
is your lady in?
tell her that I have come to collect my debt.
Hurry!
sir.
my lady is with a very important guest, and asks you come another day.
she has given me this letter instead.
in your letter, it seems you've fallen in love, whether or not you refuse to acknowledge it.
scrambling desperately in that swamp doesn't quite become you, does it?
people don't change.
but once a philanderer does, he can never return.
I had waited for our rendezvous, but have grown exhausted.
I also am now enjoying myself with a new lover, so I shall see you later.
by the way, I am not quite certain that the bloodstain you have sent me is indeed her own.
might as well be the blood of a pig or a rabbit.
I guess you haven't heard after being here for days now.
did a goat give birth to a giraffe this time?
there are Royal Inspectors in the next room.
I heard them say that they will crack down on Catholics upsetting the custom.
upsetting the custom...
did they sleep with each other or something?
goodness, how did you know?
they say that the Catholics treat people of all status equal, don't separate men from the women, and all are allowed to have sex at will.
I heard even a noble lady in the group had an affair with some man.
a noble lady?
who did they say she was?
you know, that Lady Jung who lives in Kanghwa.
madam, Sir Cho Won wishes to see you.
show him in.
you have stooped too low this time.
your brother-in-law will be back soon.
and good news, So-oak is pregnant.
slandering Lady Jung was not part of our game.
satisfied with the wedding gift you've prepared with So-oak?
I want you to leave her out of this.
still talking about that pathetic woman?
nothing will happen to you, so don't worry.
just what are you up to?
you've fallen deep indeed!
forget that one person who lived in your heart all your life?
is the faithfulness of a nobleman so weak?
who are you to speak of faithfulness?
it was quite fun to see you last night.
you can play around all you want, but you're saying that I can't?
I have never been unfaithful to you.
go on and try me, and behead Kwon In-ho.
do you think I'd bat an eye?
we are going to Beijing.
we?
did you say 'we'?
you mean, you and I?
how unfortunate?
I have no wish to go.
what if I say you can't?
I won't just sit and do nothing.
what can you do?
think anyone would believe what you say?
you know full well you are nothing but a notorious womanizer.
all right.
let Lady Jung go to China.
Yes, but you must remain here.
it'll prove that you're uninvolved with those people.
I don't suppose you have fallen in love with her, have you?
no, of course not.
that's what I thought.
of course, you shouldn't.
now go.
I know my clever cousin knows very well what to tell that woman and how to do it.
farewell, my cousin.
in Seoul, rumors say that Catholics will be investigated.
so be careful and stay out of sight.
though I should accompany you, you'd better leave for Beijing first.
I will explain to you my reasons later.
madam, he does not wish to see anyone just now.
