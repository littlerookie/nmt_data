Popper dispenses with inductive logic and relies instead on testing.
Popper emphasizes the central role that testing plays in scientific method and establishes a strong case for critical thinking by asserting that scientific laws are only provisionally valid and remain open to reexamination.
Popper held that historical irregularity led to unpredictability in history, that the "oedipus effect" destroyed accuracy and objectivity of historical prediction, and that the "hypothetical deduction" expounded the impossibility of the prediction.
Popper is a contemporary famous scientific philosopher and liberalism political philosopher in western. He constructed an encyclopedic philosophy system.
Popper not only first named the problem of the relation between the possibility and the objectivity of cognition which is involved in bacon's "doctrine of four idolas" as "bacon's problem," also he put forward a falsificationist resolution which was different from bacon's resolution.
