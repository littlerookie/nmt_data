what?
don't they have hookers where you come from?
where are you from?
somewhere with lions, I bet.
I like lions.
right... Oh, yeah.
you might want to send someone to check on the room.
there is a problem? - How should I know?
I don't exist, do I?
see you tomorrow.
what's that? You're stealing stuff already, huh?
guy before you used to take whole pigs from the freezer.
but you'd better hide it. If Sneaky sees that...
speak of the fucking devil!
Where's the greeter here?
this fucking place!
Hey! Instead of smoking, you clean this place up!
Okwe! Everything is all right?
what's this? Lunch?
it was blocking the lavatory in room 510.
it is a heart.
a human heart. - What?
what the fuck do you know about hearts, Okwe?
perhaps you should telephone the police.
police? You think I should call the police?
senor Juan, someone is dead.
OK. You speak to them.
you found it. You do the talking.
I will introduce you.
what's your full name, Okwe?
and you never told me where you are from.
or even how come you are here in this beautiful country.
Hello? Police?
Yeah, I've got somebody who wants to talk to you.
Hello? Hello?
you will learn, Okwe.
the hotel business is about strangers.
and strangers will always surprise you, you know.
they come to hotels in the night to do dirty things.
and in the morning, it's our job to make things look pretty again.
for your trouble.
you think if you don't take the money, you are innocent?
take it. Do something nice with it.
no.
it came to me last night in a flash of inspiration.
I can see.
that's a good move. - Ah!
guo Yi, there's something I need.
Amoxycillin? You got the clap?
no. My boss.
which one? - They're all the same.
in this country, the health service is free.
you still driving cabs in the day?
you're going to kill yourself.
I do not care to sleep.
when you go quiet, it means you've won already.
go on, Okwe. Don't be nice.
it makes it worse.
well, shit.
you want Chinese or English tea?
chinese.
don't know how you drink that stuff.
I found it on a body. It's blown my head wide open.
you should read it.
medicine for your soul, Okwe,
guo Yi, today I also found something.
in a lavatory, in one of the hotel rooms. Someone's heart.
a heart. A human heart.
I'm only telling you because you are a rational man.
maybe there's an explanation.
maybe some guy with one of the girls had a heart attack.
rooms are down as empty, so the Spanish guy had to get rid of the body.
hotels hate dead people. - It was a healthy heart.
so your boss was right. Somebody brought it with them.
who carries human organs? - Lots of people.
name someone. - Me, OK? Me.
I do it all the time.
I take my work home.
what I'm saying is, I could, if I was weird.
and this is a weird city.
why would anyone do that to a human heart?
these sound to me like questions.
I don't ask questions after eleven years here, and I'm a certified refugee.
you're an illegal, Okwe. You don't have a position here.
you have nothing. You are nothing.
you wait outside. I'll go get you those pills.
stick to helping people who can be helped.
fresh stuff.
thank you.
having only one key is making this impossible.
I do not want you coming in when I am there.
at the hotel we are friends. I am no different here.
how would it look, Okwe?
so it is better I always chase you down the street?
wait five minutes, then knock the door.
knock very, very quietly.
yes?
did you clean on the fifth floor yesterday morning?
nothing works!
Senay, did you clean room 510 yesterday?
what the hell are you talking about the hotel for?
water, water, water!
I was wondering if there was a problem in 510 yesterday.
you can fix these things?
Okwe, you can fix...?
they were not clean.
glasses need very hot water. - So do women.
everything here is connected to everything else.
Okwe, in Africa it is the men who cook and clean?
this came for you.
why did you not tell me? - I just told you.
you have friends in New York?
your postcard.
I have a cousin.
ever since I was small, she has written to me.
I sometimes wish London was more like New York.
it would be easy to drive a cab there.
you have been to New York?
and you came back? - I lived there for a time.
in the winter, they put lights in the trees.
is that true?
and you can skate in the parks.
and some of the policemen ride white horses.
not all of them, but some.
what did you do there? - I worked in a hospital.
you were a cleaner? - I was there to study.
so, why are you working in a hotel?
it is an African story.
I've noticed you never answer yes or no.
you are very strange.
you drink wine, Senay?
do you want to know why I left Turkey?
because you wanted to live like your cousin?
no, because I do not want to live like my mother.
Yes. - Yes, what?
I do drink wine.
this is a recipe from Nigeria.
in Nigeria they do many interesting things with pork.
but of course, I used lamb.
take one three times a day.
avoid alcohol.
in here. Come.
it's all right.
so she's a popular lady.
my warriors cannot work with rotten balls.
my friend is just a porter in the hospital crematorium.
hello. Front Desk.
no, I'm afraid the kitchen is closed from midnight.
Tssk!
Hello?
Yeah, Room Service.
sneaky doesn't know about this?
sneaky knows about everything.
and you? You know everything that goes on in the hotel?
no, no, not so much butter, hey.
you guard the door, lvan. You see who comes and goes.
you would know if somebody came into the hotel, and did not leave again?
why would someone not leave, Okwe?
I don't know.
you should remove the crusts, like in the Ritz.
everyone leaves, Okwe.
some leave quickly.
some stay for a long time.
if you want to stay, don't concern yourself with who comes and who goes.
it's the little touches that make the difference.
that's capitalism.
now go. Don't forget, you accept only cash.
room Service.
Thanks.
OK, you just make yourself comfortable, and er...
I'll go and freshen up. All right?
fucking arsehole!
come on, babe. Hurry up.
OK, OK.
calm yourself, sweetheart.
what are you doing? - Have a drink first.
you look fine. Just get out here.
stop!
enough. No more.
where the fuck did you come from?
you, leave now.
you don't have concussion. - How the fuck do you know?
Christ, you must be bored, getting your kicks spying on me.
I was making sure the blockage had not returned.
perhaps...
it's Juliette. - You should go home and rest.
rest? Got three more before morning.
so...
have you ever seen a lion?
Oh, yes.
on TV.
I had it cut. It is yours.
you were right. This way is more sensible.
Okwe, you must not tell them at the hotel that you have a key.
I tell them only the truth. - Even so.
show them that your back hurts, so they know you sleep on the floor.
but that is not true. I sleep on the couch.
the couch is not as real as the floor, Okwe.
believe me, I am a woman.
and some of those bitches won't know what is a couch.
but they know floor. They clean floors.
for you?
immigration Enforcement directive!
open the door.
miss Gelik?
Senay Gelik? Turkish national?
do you have your SAL handy?
standard Acknowledgement Letter. Your ID.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I carry it always.
neighbours, Senay. They see things.
in the last few days they've seen someone come and go.
a man.
sometimes a woman in your position can be exploited.
there are people living in London without any papers.
they prey on people like you. - Pray?
there is someone here. - There is no-one here.
you are aware your ELR status means you are unable to accept rent.
you are seeking asylum.
or engage in employment of any kind for at least six months.
you're not working, are you? - Mind if I use your bathroom?
your case is under review.
thank you.
thank you.
is that all you want?
no, no, no.
you know this stuff will not only keep you awake.
it'll blow your brains out. You know that, don't you?
Hey, Okwe! - Boy, your licence.
keys, there you are.
Hey, Okwe, what happen, man?
Hey, somebody's husband come home early, right?
anyway, take this.
we don't want the doctor getting sick, right?
I played them one of these fellas' songs, and, actually, they were very helpful.
it's bound to happen.
you stay here too long.
you start dressing like an Englishman.
where is he, then? - Who?
I've a date. Every pay-day, 4: 45.
Hey!
come on, lover boy!
Okwe, will you help me?
Hey, guy before you took $5, huh?
no, no, no, no. - But you watch the door, huh?
come, my little princess.
come, come, come, Lille princesso!
security room is out of bounds for half an hour.
five minutes, max!
immigration Enforcement directive.
can I help you?
what time do the maids clock in?
wakey wakey! - Five o'clock.
do you mind if we wait?
no.
excuse me, sir. This is a non-smoking area.
if you wish to smoke, you can wait in the designated area.
it's for you.
Hello? Okwe?
but I am almost there.
Senay will be here in two minutes.
you must stop her.
I have a medical condition!
lightning doesn't strike twice!
is that the last of them? - Yes.
this is an interesting place.
would you like to see a rate card?
I have a friend.
in her factory, they always need people.
it's a sweatshop.
is it any worse than cleaning up after whores?
it's better money.
Oh, you are so sad for me.
I do not wish to cause harm to anyone.
that is all it is?
I will collect my things and go.
go? - How can I stay?
Okwe, who will cook for me?
if it's OK, I will call on you if I have the time.
but I'm owed three days' money by the hotel.
I will see Senor Juan tomorrow morning.
I have no money for food.
I will see him today. Meet me at the cafe at four.
you are here to see Senor Juan?
looking for work?
vous travaillez?
Francais? - No, no, no.
M'aidez.
Yoruba? You speak Yoruba?
Bantu?
what the fuck are you doing here, Okwe?
Senay has decided to leave.
she asked me to collect what she's owed.
Oh, yeah? What, are you marrying her or something?
I'll get her money.
no, no. It's ok, it's OK. I'm a doctor.
I'm a doctor, it's OK.
no, please, please...
please.
you must get this man to hospital now. Right now!
he must go straight away. - No, no.
if you are a doctor, you can help this guy.
this is the wound of an operation.
where? Where did he have this operation? Which country?
you must get this man to hospital.
they won't go to hospital. - No, no, no, no hospital.
guo Yi is here?
shit.
it's my first day. I was told to collect my green overall.
which shift are you on? - Which shift?
come on. Either you're late or you're really late.
you couldn't do the bins in the kitchen, could you?
OK...
you see these blue tablets?
he must take two every two hours. You understand?
he must take two blue tablets every two hours.
you speak English?
and Somali? - A bit.
he says to say thank you. God is great.
tell him he must take two blue tablets every two hours.
and one white tablet every six hours.
it is very important that you get this exactly right.
ask him which hospital they went to to have the kidney removed.
he says they didn't go to a hospital.
ask him where they did this.
in a room.
he had his kidney removed in the hotel, yes?
how much did he get for risking his life?
he is English now.
he swapped his insides for a passport?
the man at the hotel said it would be like taking out a tooth.
can I get you something?
I've been here one hour. - An hour and a half.
there.
I will go and collect my things.
why won't you sit down?
Okwe, where have you been? - Africa.
I thought you weren't coming.
I would have got you the money somehow.
the money?
do you feel that? Do you feel anything?
I counted. I've seen you laugh three times.
four.
you think I'm so innocent.
in my village, they chew those leaves to forget how hard their lives are.
I use it to keep awake.
you know it makes you look...
you should keep away from me.
you lost your job.
because of me, you are in a sweatshop.
and now you are going again.
be sure you make it to New York.
I will make it to New York, Okwe, thank you.
best if you don't show up until after five.
most porters are gone by then. Only ghosts left.
showers are here. Water's not too hot, but it runs.
couch in my office is pretty soft.
Oh, I forgot.
you don't sleep, do you?
my friend, welcome to my hotel.
beautiful, isn't it?
and the other residents are very... very quiet.
it would only be until... - Until the world improves.
ca va?
best truffles I've ever seen in England.
dug up fifteen hours ago in Provence.
came through on the night train.
shall we say 1000?
I'm in the wrong fucking hotel.
1000, Senor Juan. What do you say?
OK. 1000.
but if I give you that price, I need a favour.
there is a night porter. African.
he came from you so I guess he came through Amsterdam.
Yes. What about him?
he is some kind of doctor. What kind of doctor?
I need to know what there is to know.
police! Police!
can I help you, gentlemen?
we're looking for someone called Senay Gelik.
she might be working here. - Do you see anybody here?
if you see her, give us a call.
you have been here for two days, and already, because of you, I'm in trouble.
maybe I should call lmmigration.
should I call them?
you wouldn't do that.
I need a good reason. What can you give me?
if they find out you've been working, what will they do?
they will put you in prison.
and here, they mix the men and women.
so, every night you will be raped.
if you want to be like a western girl, that's what happens to Western girls.
if you want to go to jail, fine.
if you can't give me a good reason,
I will call the lmmigration.
I'm a good man, Senay.
I know where to draw the line.
I don't want to take your virginity, Senay.
I just want you to help me to relax.
you have such a beautiful mouth, Senay.
Achtung! Achtung!
my ladies and gentlemen, your coach awaits!
bitte. Bitteschon.
but you must take your own luggage to the coach.
I will help only those who cannot carry their own bags.
Okwe, get up here.
this man is a doctor. - I'm OK, I'm OK.
she's OK. She only needs to rest a minute.
he qualified in Lagos.
he worked for the Nigerian government.
his name is Dr Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe.
we must hurry or we'll miss the coach.
in the end, I find out all about everyone in this place.
here, take a look at this.
French. It's a work of art.
lebanese guys I use, who are the best in London.
all you do is give them a photograph.
I have no idea what you are talking about, Senor Juan.
if you were just some African, the deal would be simple.
you give me your kidney, I give you a new identity.
I sell the kidney for ten grand, so I'm happy.
the person who needs the kidney gets cured.
so, he's happy.
the person who sold his kidney gets to stay in this beautiful country, so he's happy.
my whole business is based on happiness.
but for you, Dr Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe,
I've a better idea.
I do not want to get involved, Senor Juan.
each time you operate, you get three thousand.
a passport for you, and one for Senay.
take her on honeymoon.
I do not want to get involved.
you could even go back to Africa.
and no-one would know who the fuck you are.
your choice. No rush.
I just wanted to put a little wasp in your head.
unusual.
chinese guy with no family.
maybe he's from the back of a truck.
I cut off his buttons so his spirit can escape.
I'm sewing up his pockets so he can't take his bad luck with him to the spirit world.
if he's an atheist,
I'm ruining a suit no-one will ever see.
if he's a Buddhist, I'm giving him eternal happiness, for the price of a piece of thread.
I have found out why the heart was at the room.
they are removing kidneys.
one of their patients died at their hands.
another I treated for a staphylococcal infection.
you're treating people? I hope you charge.
did you hear what I said?
there is nothing so dangerous as a virtuous man.
Okwe, if you're so concerned, you should go to the police.
get yourself deported.
you think if it were just for deportation I would not do it?
I'm a wanted man, Guo Yi.
wanted for what?
Okwe, you didn't know people sold their organs?
not here. - What do you mean, "here"?
here in London, you think it doesn't happen because the Queen doesn't approve?
I heard in London it's ten grand for a kidney.
for that, people take risks.
if I had the courage, I'd sell my kidney.
just to get out of here.
just to save my brain.
the problem with always being on time is that you can always be tracked down.
what do you think of the girl?
she's my next customer.
eight years old. She's called Rima.
her family brought her over from Saudi, hoping for a miracle.
if she doesn't get a new kidney in the next few weeks, she's going to die.
the doctor we use is no good.
if he fucks up again, there'll be another heart down the lavatory.
Okwe, you still there?
so, I'm an evil man, right?
but I'm trying to save her life.
that's weird, huh?
kind of thing that keeps you awake at night.
tonight, London is colder than Moscow.
I heard it on the radio.
Okwe... it is a crazy idea.
but we really can do it.
you said you liked New York.
but if not New York, then maybe Boston.
or Los Angeles.
I'm going there, Okwe. What do you think?
and Okwe, you could go there, too.
are you OK? Senay, where are you?
what has happened?
I knocked but you did not hear me.
are you OK? What has happened?
the factory does not suit me.
my hands are too soft. I cut my fingers.
so...
I have decided to go to America.
for America you would need a visa, Senay.
or maybe a European passport.
keep away from Senor Juan! - It's like taking out a tooth.
he's lying!
because you are poor, you will be gutted like an animal.
they will cut you here, or they will cut you here!
they will leave you to rot.
one of the laundry girls did it, and now she's free.
others are dead, Senay.
so, they are free, too.
what would your God say?
my God does not speak to me any more.
don't break. Save money.
keep New York in your head and work hard.
you know what kind of work I do?
lunch!
Aargh!
Okwe, somebody in the back room looking for you.
she look like a film star, boy.
look, Okwe, I know for sure that this coat costs L300.
this dress... - Tell me what has happened.
we can sell the coat for 200.
Senay, where did you get these?
I bit, Okwe.
at the factory.
he said he would report me to Immigration, and he made me suck.
but today, I bit.
I bit.
I bit!
senor Juan sometimes has rooms in the hotel.
no, Senay. - Just for tonight.
no.
through there is hot water and a shower.
hurry, Senay.
what is this place, Okwe?
it is a place where you can stay for tonight.
so cold.
if anyone comes, you are a friend of Guo Yi.
tomorrow we will find you somewhere to live.
so... it is in there.
I can hear it.
your heart.
hello. Room Service.
buenos dias... Negro.
come on. Come on.
she's nil by mouth the whole day.
please.
sister.
help me, brother.
stop acting like you've got a choice.
please!
put on your clothes. - Please, no!
you came here in the back of a truck, but you are going home in chains!
they'll deliver you like meat!
the whole world is wrong, except you, Okwe?
what?
you are going to cut me up, and flush me away?
I really, really don't know you at all, do I?
this is Senay. A friend. - I am not your friend.
she has been out all night. - I'd rather freeze to death, than go into that building again.
there are mornings I feel the same.
come, Senay, it's cold. - It is the house of the dead.
they are all dead.
maybe this will help.
my cousin has a room, in Chinatown.
I guess there's space for two.
you know, Okwe, good at chess usually means bad at life.
you do realise that she's in love with you, don't you?
I've been with her twenty minutes, and I know it.
but then, I'm bad at chess.
there is something I must tell you.
this is your religion? - I have no religion.
you have stopped chewing the leaf.
I can see from your eyes.
do you know, Okwe, your eyes are quite pretty?
you are not bad looking. - Listen to me.
I come to this churchyard often.
I come here to be alone, and to think about my wife.
so now you see.
what do I see?
you should not see me any more.
do you love her? Do you love her?
there is a room above a restaurant.
the lmmigration police do not dare go into Chinatown.
here is some money for the rent I owe you.
there is more for the trouble I have caused you.
Okwe, do you love her? - Love?
for you and I, there is only survival.
it is time you woke up from your stupid dream.
yes?
are you going on holiday or something?
senor Juan...
senor Juan... - America, maybe?
come on, you cleaned up their shit so long.
now, you can be one of them.
who is it?
it's me. I got some paperwork.
OK. How old are you?
Twenty-two.
how old do you want to be?
Twenty-two.
Hey, come on, relax. I can make you whatever you want.
you want to be Spanish or Greek?
Italian.
you need a new name. - Isabella Encarico.
you're sure that's Italian? - She owns a cafe in New York.
OK, you are at New York lmmigration. What's your name?
Isabella Fontanna Encarico.
how old are you? - Twenty-two.
where were you born? - Napoli.
where in Napoli? - Aranella.
right.
the trick, Senay, is to believe you are the new person.
if you believe it inside, the lmmigration will believe it.
drink?
what are you afraid of? Okwe's gone.
got scared and go away.
go to hell!
this is hell.
I'm helping you to get away.
take off you robe. Come on, come on.
Hey, hey, stop that!
stop that!
I can't believe it.
I'm arguing like you are my fucking wife.
let me explain something.
your robe now is what the Americans call a "deal breaker."
so...
no.
you are this close to New York and you said no.
wait.
I want the whole thing. That's the deal.
take it or leave it.
you do not see me.
you just do.
take it or leave it.
so it wasn't so bad, huh?
nothing to cry about.
I'm not crying.
if you'd told me it was the first time,
I'd have cut a ribbon.
I can't believe Okwe never fucked you.
you kind of love him, huh?
women love men most who don't love them back.
well, you had a lucky escape.
you know why he ran away?
because I found out that in Africa, he murdered his own wife.
you don't eat or drink for 24 hours, OK?
doctor's orders.
Senay is here?
I will need a pill.
there is a pill you can take the morning after.
you are a doctor.
at least you can get me a pill.
I won't allow you to butcher her.
you won't allow?
I will operate on her myself.
you'll do what? - I will do it.
it is the only way I can be sure she will not die.
in return, I want a passport. A new identity.
well, holy shit!
so you are human?
I will bring you our photographs tomorrow morning.
Hi. I'm Juliette. I'm a friend of Okwe's.
he said that you needed these.
so, he did not care enough to bring them himself.
Oh, Okwe's an angel.
there. Never happened.
so... What did happen?
before, I was a virgin.
Jesus!
Mohammed.
what a pair!
the virgin and the whore.
the doctor needs a good car.
take it. Last time you were lucky.
black is black.
wash these again, please.
boil, boil, eh?
hot, hot!
Jose!
so, this is how you do it right?
there can be no guarantee against E Coli.
Mmm!
wonderful!
no, no, no, no.
passports. It's something I do right.
no parking.
Okwe wants me to wait here.
I gave her a sedative an hour ago.
she's only in a deep sleep.
but now you are here,
I can administer the anaesthetic.
now I'm here?
you are going to be my assistant, Senor Juan.
what the fuck is this?
I have noticed that if you do not drink, your hands shake.
when you pass the scalpel,
I do not want you to cut off my fingers.
when will they come to collect?
if you faint during the operation,
I have half an hour before the kidney begins to deteriorate.
they come to the laundry bay. Back of the kitchen.
you'd better start. - Go and scrub your hands.
Yes. Professional!
it's decided. It's fucking decided!
you and me are going into business.
you know washing dishes?
you know, when you forget on Friday and come in Monday, and there is a pan with sauce?
white... green... shit.
that... is...
Jesus! Was I speaking English then?
what you say?
...don't understand it, how the ice will help.
it'll make you last longer, babe.
I don't want to last longer. It's not even pay-day.
all right, make you harder.
think what happens to water when it freezes, eh?
there.
get a bucket. - Bucket?
come on!
you have removed kidneys before?
many times.
in pathology.
what is pathology?
it means the patient is already dead.
did he tell you things about me, Senay?
no.
let me wipe your brow, doctor.
Juliette, put the ice on the bed and put on the gown.
take the bag.
squeeze. Gently.
we must go and scrub up.
cold tonight, huh?
on a night like this, who would want so much ice?
you are Pylades.
Pylades was the boatman who ferried the souls to the land of the dead.
if you didn't put a coin under the tongue of your dead relative,
Pylades wouldn't take them to Hades.
no matter how good you had been in your life.
knife.
Jesus! - You are not allowed to faint.
pass me the ice.
is that it, then? - No, I must sew him up.
Why?
fetch me stitches.
will you go and check there is no-one else waiting?
Yeah.
Where's Senor Juan?
he's drunk.
how come I've never seen you people before?
because we are the people you do not see.
we are the ones who drive your cabs.
we clean your rooms, and suck your cocks.
in one hour, call an ambulance.
send them up to room 510.
Juliette?
thank you. - Sssh! It's OK.
one hour, OK?
Handa? Handa, it's me, Senay.
you hear how good my English is?
I'm coming to New York. I'm coming to New York!
my hands are shaking.
so are mine. I don't have a driver's licence.
it's dead.
it's the tunnel.
I must tell her what time we land.
Senay, what Sneaky told you was true.
he did not tell me anything.
I did not kill my wife myself, but still it was my fault.
I was a pathologist in Lagos. - And now you are someone new.
an official was shot. I was told to destroy the evidence.
I don't want to know.
when I refused, my house was fire bombed.
my wife was still inside.
the police charged me with her murder.
I had to run.
but my daughter stayed Valerie.
she's with my sister in Lagos.
how old is she?
seven.
I must go to her.
tell me about Lagos.
do they have hotels that need maids?
when you arrive at the airport, you will see a whole line of yellow cabs.
the car will take you across a bridge.
when you cross the river, you will see lights in the trees.
policemen on white horses.
no.
I know it won't be like that.
goodbye, Okwe.
hold me.
you must go... Isabella.
always we must hide.
this is the cafe where my cousin works.
I love you.
I love you.
Hello?
Valerie?
Yes, it's me.
at last,
I'm coming home.
my father worked as a lawyer for the richest family in new york until his plane went down in long island sound.
he left me his biggest client, the Darlings
Tripp, the empire builder, Letitia, the sophisticated socialite,
I want to marry Nick.
let me help you.
Brian, the man of god...
what about Brian jr?
I'm taking him back to Brazil.
you can't just uproot him.
he has a life here now.
Patrick, the principled politician...
the three of us are gonna sit down together and set some ground rules.
you, me and who?
and Jeremy and Juliet, the well-behaved twins.
I want a job.
what can you do?
gracias.
you will not believe the girl whose car I'm parking.
darling Plaza? was our first home in manhattan.
convince Tripp to throw Darling Plaza? into the pot.
it is simon elder.
he has stolen my son.
I want to destroy him.
good morning.
Hey.
you ready to paint the living room?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I love painting.
I love the mess, I love the smell.
okay, which one?
all right, let me see.
Yeah, it's a custard theme.
are you sure you're going to be able to finish this before thanksgiving at my parents'?
it's only two days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have very little to do today.
I just have to meet with Tripp briefly and help Brian with his custody hearing, and then I am free for the entire holiday weekend.
five days without Nick George...
won't the Darling dynasty crumble into dust without you?
it just might.
but it would be very expensive dust.
anything going on with Darling Plaza??
not yet.
we transferred the deed over to simon elder two weeks ago.
he's given me no indication of his plans.
is that it, then?
he just wanted to steal my soul, rob me of...
the building where my kids were raised, rob me of my son?
my son, Nick.
have you heard from Patrick lately?
not since the wedding.
he hasn't returned any of my calls.
you can't imagine what it's like, Nicky.
you come tthe end of your life so many years of work, so many years of achievement and then right in front of your face, it's all being spirited away by this capricious man.
Patrick is still your son, Tripp.
no matter what kind of political alliance he forms with simon elder for whatever reason, he's still your son.
Yeah.
arrange a sit-down with Patrick and simon elder for me, will you?
a sit-down? Okay.
the sooner, the better.
tomorrow evening, up at valhalla.
wait, Tripp.
you expect him to leave the city the day before thanksgiving and go 60 miles up the hudson river valley for a sit-down?
you handed him the deed to Darling Plaza? to gain influence with him, right?
Yeah.
so use your influence.
cash it in.
all right. I'm on it.
you'll be there at my side, okay?
Tripp, it's-- it's thanksgiving weekend.
I made plans with the family.
I'll get you out really early thursday morning.
promise.
what do you want me to tell Patrick to just tell him simon elder will be there.
that'll make him feel safe.
you leave the rest up to his vanity.
how much longer are we gonna be staying at this hotel?
living out of a suitcase, eating room service all the time, it's a little tiresome.
thank you for being so patient.
have you set up the meeting with Carmelita yet?
I'm not sure this is the best time for her.
uh, she's got finals coming up.
Oh, she's in school.
what school?
uh, cosmetology.
well, it's always something, isn't it?
when would be a good time...
for her?
uh, wh-what is it you want to talk about?
just make it happen.
if you want to stay married to me, quit stalling and make it happen.
I-I understand -- today.
okay.
thank you for coming on such short notice, giorgio.
anytime you get divorced, karen, I'm here for you.
but, you know, we don't have to do this only after you get divorced.
Yeah, actually, we kinda do.
was that giorgio?
what a trooper, always being there for you like that.
it's really, like, inspiring.
mm, it takes a village.
something was off last night, though.
it wasn't the same.
do tell.
well, usually when giorgio and I have...
meaningless post-divorce sex, it feels a little less meaningless, like we're somehow...
planets whose orbits intersect every ten years?
no.
just...
hornier.
Oh, well.
you gonna eat those?
no.
replenish.
what's the matter with you?
I miss my son.
Brian jr. Left? Where'd he go?
his mother came and took him away a week ago, karen.
I'm fighting for custody.
Brian, hey, look, you-- you know how the justice system works.
whoever has the most money wins, right?
you've got nothing to worry about.
well, thanks for the advice.
thanks for the pancakes.
was Brian wearing clive christian number 1?
Nah, that's me.
and it's number 2, unreleased to the public.
why are you wearing cologne?
there's this girl who parks at the garage.
she won't go out with me.
she thinks I'm, like, just a valet.
Oh, so you're gonna knock her unconscious with your cologne, and then, what, shanghai her?
just tell her you're Jeremy Darling.
no.
Natalie pretended to be pregnant just to get my money.
I want this girl to like me for me.
honey, that's not gonna happen.
you're a Darling.
as soon as she finds that out, things are never gonna be the same, trust me.
I guess she can never find out then.
that is a good plan.
good plan, my friend.
he's not asking you to move back in.
he's not asking you to do anything except sit down with him and simon and talk.
well, Nick, that's the last thing on earth I would ever consider doing.
I know, but, Patrick, he is your father.
it's taken me over 30 years to--to muster the courage to break free from him.
I'm not about to go ruing back into shooting range.
okay.
but I'll do it.
I'll do it, okay?
I just need one...
little favor.
she just wants to talk.
I can't do it.
I can't face her.
I'm sorry.
tell Patrick no.
Carmelita, just put yourself in Ellen's shoes, just for a second.
she's not asking Patrick to end the affair.
she's not asking you to vanish.
she just wants to talk.
you know, who knows?
maybe the three of you can somehow, I don't know, complete each other.
you really think that's possible?
well, I think that life is very creative and surprising, and sometimes we find solutions where we thought there weren't any.
Patrick is so lucky to have someone like you in his life.
I'll do it.
good.
a sit-down?
that's what he called it.
wait.
and--and what are the terms?
Ah, no terms.
well, because it sounds so old-world, I figured there must be terms.
Nope, just the three of you sitting down to talk, and me.
okay, does this have anything to do with Darling Plaza??
I don't think so I think it has to do with the fact he feels he's lost his son to you.
that's what he's troubled about right now.
okay, so you're being straight with me about this little...
sit-down?
you promise me that I'm not gonna be walking into some sort of classic Tripp Darling ambush?
uh, yeah, I promise.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll go.
actually, I think it could be beneficial.
good.
it's not every day two men like us sit down and break bread together.
it should be interesting.
done.
the Country House
I think we can all agree it's in everyone's best interest to settle this without going to the judge tomorrow.
what you think, Mr. George, is aside the point.
my client's settling for nothing less than sole physical and legal custody.
are you out of your freaking mind?
I know what's best for my child.
says the tramp who slept with me last week to get him back.
Brian, let me handle this.
then handle it!
given Brian jr.'s feelings for his father, do you think that moving to brazil is really what's best for him?
these two have bonded since you first deposited your son with Brian and then subsequently disappeared.
was this before or after he deposited the child with you?
beat it, you prissy little creep.
Brian, let's just cool it. Okay?
let's just stop.
I think I have come up with what is a very fair proposal for joint custody.
you will be wellompensated provided you stay in the city, and it puts your son's best interests first.
I'll give you $1 million to get up and walk out of here right now.
excuse me?
Hey, that's not what we're here to do, Brian.
let me finish.
$2 million.
are you trying to buy my son?
I'm trying to buy our son.
nobody is buying anybody.
this is ridiculous.
we're leaving.
$3 million.
we both know it's all about the money with you anyway.
now I remember why it didn't work with us.
you are not a human being.
don't look at me like that.
$3 million was more than fair.
Hey.
Hey.
how you doing, baby?
this better not be your way of saying you're missing thanksgiving.
I am not missing thanksgiving.
good.
I just have to postpone the painting until the weekend.
and I'm gonna catch up with you and Kiki at your parents'.
I have to go up to the Darlings' country house tomorrow.
Tripp is having a sit-down with Patrick and simon elder.
he wants me there.
I'm sorry.
you know what? It's okay.
okay.
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't get to it, so maybe I'll start painting, cause I'd like it done before the holidays.
because, you know, I actually care.
Hey, lisa, you know what?
why don't you come with me.
we'll--we'll drop Kiki off at your folks' first, and then this weekend, we'll all paint together.
I am not going to stay in the same house as the Darlings.
italy was bad enough.
Oh, come on, Lisa.
I am not gonna stay the night at the same place you and Karen Darling spent a dozen magical summers together.
you know what?
how about you go, you enjoy a nice, long weekend with her, and I will stay here and I will paint?
Lisa, I don't particularly want to go, but I have to.
and since I have to, I would like you to come with me.
coming right up.
actually...
is it possible to leave my car here overnight?
I think I drank a little too much wine atinner.
I'm so on board with that.
you know, both myself and the garage encourage responsible, yet heavy drinking.
okay, wonderful.
thank you.
I'll just go and take a catnap.
let me...
let me help you out there.
what do you got going on in there?
french fries with truffle oil.
you know, I-I could just drive you home.
that way--that way you have your car in the morning.
I don't think so.
come on.
I'll cab it home.
no muss, no fuss.
in and out.
boom.
that's so sweet of you.
it would help me out a lot.
well, I will--I will-- I will go fetch your chariot.
why do I have to come to Valhalla for thanksgiving?
Brian's not gonna be there.
your brother Brian has a custody hearing.
he's presiding over two funerals this weekend.
the holiday season die-off has commenced.
uh, I-I told you I'd help you with Nick.
so trust me.
just come.
what if daddy sends me and Nick to India-- or, no, wait, Bali-- to set up an orphanage for the really starving children?
and we'd have to live alone in a grass hut on the beach.
well, as wonderful as that sounds, coming to Valhalla is all you really need to do.
but she'll be there.
won't she?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Oh, she will.
of course she will.
she's his wife.
it's so her to come along, isn't it?
just relax, my dear.
everything is gonna work itself out.
door-to-door service with a smile.
thank you for this.
boy, Brooklyn is, uh, far away.
I mean--I mean, I-I forgot how far it is.
it's like...
it's like a whole other world.
are you gonna be all right getting home?
Yeah, yeah, like I said, I'll--I'll call a cab.
maybe I'll hobo and hop a boxcar.
the subway is two blocks away.
right, yeah.
the--the subway.
there you go.
listen, Sofia...
the answer is yes.
to what?
I will go out with you.
but I don't even know your last name.
well--well, I-I don't-- I don't even know your last name.
I'm Sofia Montoya, and you're Jeremy...
I'm cool with just Jeremy, babe.
Yeah, well, you know, it's a-- it's a common american last name.
it's right on all those lists beside Smith Wong and White.
well, thank you and I'll see you tomorrow, Jeremy...
Yes.
Yes, you will.
Hey, hey, Clark, um, do you mind coming to get me?
I am, uh, I am...
somewhere in Brooklyn.
you're sure about this, right?
what are you gonna do, not answer the door?
well...
isn't this something?
I've heard a lot about you.
I wish I could say the same.
unfortunately, I've been kept completely in the dark.
I have, too, in a sense.
come in.
please.
you can have one saturday night a month, but the rest of the weekends are ours.
you can have one tuesday or wednesday night every other week to do whatever it is that the two of you do as long as he is home in time to put the kids to bed before he does it.
this's less than I get him now, so why exactly would I do this?
because it's more than you'll ever have otherwise.
trust me.
starting now, this is the new normal.
Sweetheart...are you sure you want to please, Pat, stay out of it.
don't you think I should participate in this conversation?
Patrick, maybe you should take a walk.
okay.
okay.
he'll spend holidays with us, family birthdays and obviously all campaign-related events are completely off-limits.
the only way that this is gonna work is if I get him two nights every week.
or Patrick's gonna end up sneaking out, and neither one of us wants that, do we?
family is the only thing that matters to me.
and as the arbitrator in this case, I'm sure you can appreciate that.
and that's why I believe, as a father and a minister, that I should share custody with Brian jr.
and she should not be able to whisk him away to frigging Brazil.
thank you, reverend Darling, for your forthrightness.
Mr. Mitchell?
Reverend Darling, who is Gustav?
go ahead, tell him.
Gustav is my, uh, pet name for Brian jr.
it's a Nickname, kind of.
nickname, really?
Yeah.
it's a rather unremarkable occurrence between a father and son.
is it true you forced Brian jr.
to lie to your wife and pretend he was a swedish orphan whose parents died in a car accident?
no.
no?
it was a bullet train accident, not a car.
get your facts straight.
but you did make him lie.
no.
I offered him an opportunity to work with me to smooth the way towards building a new family structure by soft-pedaling, as it were, the nature of his involvement with me, and by making it a fun game.
isn't it also true, reverend Darling, that you kept Brian jr. On a diet of swedish foods, including fermented milk and reindeer?
it was once.
it was a 1-day thing.
and didn't you forbid him to tell the truth to your wife until he was so paralyzed by fear and guilt of hellfire and damnation that he had to confess the truth himself?
I need help.
I've got this little romantic rendezvous tonight, and, uh, I -- I was wondering if you could hook me up with a place to eat.
a restaurant?
this girl I like, she doesn't know who I am.
you know, she thinks I'm this normal parking attendant, and, uh, you know, I just-- I-I wanna keep it that way.
so...
W-where--where do people like you go out?
people like me?
Yeah, you know, like poor--poor people.
Where--where do you eat when you go out?
you know, Jeremy, I actually make a pretty decent living working for your family.
I've--I've seen you eating your bag lunch, and, you know, I don't know what's going on with the whole silent-movie-star moustache, but it seems pretty...poverty-related.
you're right, Jeremy.
I...
can't actually afford a beard.
that's a good one.
in the interest of full poor disclosure, uh, maureen and I do enjoy, occasionally, going out for pizza or a walk down the Brooklyn promenade.
that--that's sweet and simple.
I like it.
sometimes, after, we'll take a bottle of wine up on the roof and...
if the stars are out and the mood hits us, well...
you know us poor people.
you do the deed alfresco?
Yep.
Clarksdale!
you're like the--the fountain of middle class romance-formation.
I been called that before.
you should prepare yourself, Brian.
we may lose.
do you think?
you're the worst.
did you even go to law school?
what did you want me to do?
you've lied about this kid from day one, Brian, and everybody knows it.
I'm sorry I can't change reality.
well, then you suck.
I had a plan, and you sabotaged me every step of the way.
just go out there and--and get them back in here and get a retrial or a mistrial or something.
this isn't a trial.
the arbitrator makes her recommendation to the judge based on testimony, and your little performance in here didn't help.
the fact is, Andrea raised Brian for seven years, and you had him for two months.
and you made him pretend to be swedish.
so why don't you let me worry about the law?
go see Andrea alone, reason with her, make her understand how you feel about Brian.
she's his mother.
she wants him to be happy.
good luck.
Hey. What are you doing?
Hey.
I don't think there is an article of clothing kiki owns that she is not taking with her.
taking where?
to my parents'.
we'll drop her off.
I'm going with you to the country house.
you decided to come with me?
Mm-hmm.
you sure?
Yes.
I am not going to let the Darling drama rob me of a chance to breathe some clean air with my husband.
good.
Yeah, and they only use it, like, four times a year.
buon giorno, cari.
Oh, leave those.
Albert will get them.
told you she'd come.
it'll be fine.
told you she'd come.
it'll be fine.
Hi, dear.
Hi, Lisa.
lovely to have you here.
would you look at that?
here we go.
Oh, hello.
well, you must be Simon.
it is a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, mother.
great to see you.
Simon, how are you? This is my wife Lisa.
and this is Karen Darling.
Hi.
the Karen?
Yes.
I'm sure everybody could use a little drinky-poo.
Hey, you're just in time.
so what are we hunting?
quail.
might get a pheasant or two.
this late in the season?
sure.
you're not planning on shooting him, are you?
come on, Nick.
you know me better than that.
everything's just terrific, mother.
thank you.
you're not liking that qua?
I'm all for sport hunting and responsible wildlife management, but actually...
I don't eat meat.
Oh, but that's all the yummy stuff.
do you eat anything yummy?
down, girl.
shut up.
well, we can have them cook you something else.
there's trout.
no, no, no, the salad is enough.
everything's wonderful.
thank you.
Lisa, you must come with me after dinner to the east wing.
I've been meaning to show you something.
a little art collection.
okay.
sounds great.
it's an hour-and-a-half wait.
should we just go?
Nah, let me see what I can do.
Jeremy, it's okay.
no, no, hold on.
I can be charming.
excuse me.
could you please double-check about a table for two?
actually, it looks like I might have a table, Mr. Darling.
one more thing.
should just be a few.
Really?
Babeson, party of two?
you got us a table.
I told a teeny lie.
happy birthday to you that was so embarrassing.
my birthday is in march.
it was the only way I could get a table.
just, you know, pretend.
I'm having a great time tonight.
me, too.
you know, it's, uh, kinda nice going out on a normal date.
and how does this normal date ends?
how about a walk on the promenade?
how about we go back to your place?
uh, that--that is-- that is a much better idea.
except I can't.
I-I got a friend crashing at my place for thanksgiving tomorrow.
you know, he--he's, uh, he's a little down on his luck, kinda poor, so...
too bad.
there is another option.
isn't there some way that we can...
work something out, just between us?
Brian, it's too late for that.
when that arbitrator delivers her recommendation to the judge, it's all over, and I'll abide by that.
well, of course you will, cause it's all gonna go your way.
not his and not mine, yours.
Brian, that first day that I met you at church, you sat and talked with me for hours about faith and solace.
Yeah, so what about it?
so you are the one who taught me to bring my problems in life to god.
have you thought about doing that?
I-I know this whole get-together may seem a little old-fashioned, but...
I thought it was time to cut through the haze of go-betweens and talk in person.
Hey, I couldn't agree more.
I'm glad you came.
thank you.
as long as everything's moving forward, dad, I'm happy.
no hard feelings.
so...
what are you doing with my son?
doing?
what?
no, what is the nature of your alliance?
h-hold on a second.
are you kidding?
this is none of your business anymore, dad.
you don't have to answer that.
no, no, no, I'm happy to.
I'm ecstatic.
I've--I've simply offered myself to Patrick as an advisor and a--and a friend during this time of transition.
so you're not using him as a pawn to enact revenge against me, huh?
um, I think...
that Patrick's pedree combined with his passion for social justice is going to make him a very effective senator.
I'm excited to be on his team, that's all.
dad, try not to make a fool of yourself, okay?
what's this all about, Tripp?
it's about the chilling heartlessness of a man determined to tear asunder the long-standing family ties in the course of his vendetta.
do you want to tell them why you want to destroy my family, or shall I?
you know, Lisa, I,um...
I've been meaning to apologize to you, but I-I keep putting it off.
you know, for the wedding, for Karen's...behavior.
she can be so rash and thoughtless sometimes.
and I-I know how proud she is, and she'd never come to you herself.
what are you talking about?
you present yourself as a-- some sort of modern-day saint.
but that's not who you are at all.
you're not motivated by benevolence.
you're driven from your very core by an obsessive malevolence against me and my family
I-I've gotta get going.
paddy, hear this out.
Tripp, none of this is personal.
it's business.
so...
your family's history with my family has nothing to do with it?
what are you--what are you talking about, Tripp?
I didn't know what his real name was before.
but as soon as I found out, everything fell into place.
his parents used to work for our family, for a long time.
do you want to continue, or shall I?
what happened?
Oh, it--it was nothing, really.
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
well, I-I assumed you knew.
you and Karen have been so chilly that -- wh-what happened?
I would love to hear what you think you know.
your father was my mother's lover.
well, that was the rumor, and my father couldn't live with those rumors, true or false, so he dismissed his parents, and they fled to the soviet union with the belief that communism spoke more clearly to the plight of african-americans.
but it wasn't so rosy over there, was it?
his family ended up in a siberian work camp, and they died there, leaving you an orphan.
is that true?
it touches on the truth.
well...
you know, Karen was in a bit of a depression, you know, post-divorce, and a little intoxicated, and she...
well, she apparently kissed Nick and declared her undying love for him.
she can be so impulsive.
no, it is the truth.
and it's the truth that you hold me personally responsible for the death of your parents.
see, I don't need some desiccated old man to tell me my history.
Siccated?
especially one who gets it all wrong.
my parents didn't go to Russia by choice.
your family forced them there.
Oh, no. You've got it all wrong.
I'm not dried meat, and your parents were not deported from this country, and you know it.
no, no.
but once their names had been handed over to the state department, they were, for all intents and purposes, hounded out of this country, so, yeah, their deaths lie at the feet of your family, completely.
all right, I've heard enough.
look, I don't know who's telling the truth here, okay?
but the fact that you lured all of us up here for this little performance of yours and then get everyone else involved with your game, that arrogance is precisely why I stopped trusting you years ago, and why I will never trust you again.
do you understand?
if you see Ellen, tell her I've gone out.
I'll head home as well.
I wish this had ended differently.
well, it ended exactly as I expected it to end, with a crafty denial.
night, Tripp.
good night.
well, at least it's out there for everyone to know.
excuse me.
it's so sick.
you told me this wasn't an ambush.
I didn't know anything about it.
you need to stop lying to me.
I will not be played.
no one is playing you.
if that fossil wants a war, that's exactly what he'll get.
that's what you'll both get.
Simon, this was all Tripp.
I had nothing too with it.
that's the truth.
the tru--oh, the truth.
Oh, the truth is pretty malleable around here.
all right, all right.
all right.
just...
listen, if we're gonna go any further, I need to know one last time whether you're with me or not.
well, if all you're doing is exacting revenge, then no, I'm not.
Nick, I'm not exacting revenge.
but Tripp Darling owning half the city is not good for the people of new york.
he is a dangerous man.
look, I know that Tripp has made some shady business deals, but dangerous?
Yes.
do you remember Kenneth Darling, Tripp's brother?
Simon, come on.
the only people who think that Tripp had anything to do with Kenneth Darling's assassination are crackpot conspiracy theorists on the internet and two people who are actually suspects in the killing, both of whom have since been completely discredited.
Yeah, you're-- you're probably right.
because bad things don't really happen.
it's all just a story.
right?
Where's Nick?
I'm not sure.
scotch?
Uh-oh.
it's empty.
sorry.
were you this drunk when you kissed my husband and told him that you loved him at your wedding?
actually, no.
I was sober, and so was he.
Hey, there you are.
be careful.
she just found out about our kiss at the wedding.
it was not "our kiss," Karen.
unbelievable.
you are unbelievable.
why do you do that?
I didn't tell her, Nick.
I thought it was gonna be our little secret.
how did you think to come up to this place?
Oh, my dad works for them.
uh, he told me they're all out of town, so...
so what does Mr. Babeson do?
who?
your dad, silly. Mr. Babeson.
Oh, right.
um, he-- he's the limo driver for this family, the Darlings.
you've never heard of them?
no, should I have?
no, no.
you-- no, you absolutely shouldn't have.
you know what's so amazing about you?
what?
being with you...
I-I feel like it doesn't matter how much money I have or don't have.
it's like it's just ycoou and me, you know?
dear god...
I don't ask you for much.
Well,'cause I know I don't deserve much.
but please help the arbitrator to understand that I love my son.
I'm so sorry.
and please give her the good sense...
I think this is yours.
no, it fell out of your-- from reverend Darling.
to accept my generous donation.
thank you.
Amen.
so you're just gonna leave right now?
I'm going to my parents' house.
I need some time to regroup.
Lisa, the only reason that I didn't tell you was that I didn't want to waste our time arguing over nothing.
it was basically a-- a peck on the cheek-- her lips, my cheek.
how many times does she have to kiss you before you put a stop to it?
I can't control what Karen does.
is that going to be your excuse when you two sleep together?
she's delusional, Lisa.
I've told her over and over there will never be anything between us.
but she lives in this world where she thinks she can have anything she wants.
Yeah, well, there is a pattern here, Nick.
and for the first time, I feel like you are taking part in it, whether you believe it or not.
you know what? I have been pissed offt karen, but I have never worried about you.
now I am.
Hey, baby.
what are you working on?
you went to see her, didn't you?
wheris she?
I-in a motel...
a few miles from here.
could you at least take a shower?
w-we didn't...
do anything.
it just--I...
look, it's been a rough night, and I-I needed to talk to someone.
I...
I can...
I can tell her things.
What--I...
Simon left so abruptly.
how was the meeting?
ultimately?
Wearying.
sometimes I think I'm almost ready to leave, you know...
this life.
I'm glad I married you.
I'm glad I married you.
what theell was that?
so this was not an assassination attempt on Patrick Darling?
no, this was a simple, run-of-the-mill hunting accident.
where are the wounds?
Mr. Darling sustained injuries-- minor injuries--to his leg, and he is expected to make a full and speedy recovery.
who shot him?
nobody shot him, per se.
this was an accident.
fine.
who pulled the trigger?
Charlie mickelson--a longtime Darling family friend.
he is devastated the incident, and we obviously request that you respect his privacy.
where is Ellen Darling?
why hasn't she been here to see him?
Ellen is resting at the imperial, and she's also quite devastated.
and we all hope that we can just put this unfortunate episode behind us and enjoy the holiday as best we can.
why was the attorney general hunting at night?
no further questions.
looking forward to the turkey festivities this evening?
I am, I am.
I, uh, don't know how festive it's gonna be with Patrick's leg in a sling, but I finally have something to be thankful for.
let's go, clark.
I didn't--I didn't know you were gonna be here today.
you know, the-- thanksgiving and all.
what's all this?
uh, th-this? This is oh, of course. That's your father.
how sweet of him to pick you up from your work.
Yeah, he is-- he is the sweetest.
you--you are--you-- thank you.
thank you, pops.
what the hell's going on here?
be cool, Clark.
just know you're my father and our last name is babeson.
got it.
this is my dad.
Ah, Babesons don't shake.
Babesons hug.
okay.
how are you?
I'm good.
thank you for doing this, Charlie.
happy to help out, Tripp.
what did I shoot him with again?
double-barreled shotgun.
purdy, 20-gauge, birdshot-- both barrels.
right.
happy thanksgiving.
you, too.
tell Helen we'd love to see you sometime.
will do.
thank you.
you bet.
how's Patrick doing?
doped up on sedatives.
Ellen?
also doped up on sedatives.
you know, this could be...
well, you know...
I mean, it's not going to get out, s it?
I'm just thinking of Patrick's campaign.
shouldn't be a problem.
he's my son.
you okay?
I said I'd never lie for the family, and all of a sudden I'm making up stories for the press about hunting accidents.
doesn't seem like a step in the right direction.
hey...
you told dutch you were too busy to see him, and you weren't.
come on.
come on, Nick.
life's messy.
why didn't you tell me that elder's parents worked for the family?
the whole point of this is for him to trust me.
I didn't want to put you in a position where you would have to lie.
and I could not take a chance that his faith in you would be in any way diminished.
so all that was true, about elder's parents?
Yeah.
I-I mean, he got it wrong about my parents reporting his parentto the authorities.
that wasn't them.
it was my father.
Yeah.
that was dutch my dad, he was-- he was fit to be tied.
if he'd had his way...
I mean, you know, it was the 50s.
they were different times.
dutch got into it, got them safely put on a boat to russia.
you know...
if you're looking for a motive for...
who killed your dad, I mean, if Simon Elder knew that it was dutch who did that...
what?
isn't that Darling Plaza??
Oh, god.
that's the third time I've seen it today.
it doesn't get any easier.
darling Plaza? was demolished today as part of billionaire Simon Elder's redevelopment plan for a new, greener manhattan.
according to the demolition team, the 15-story building...
there is nothing that that man is not capable of doing...
caused minor delays in the morning commute.
I was hoping it'd be you.
happy thanksgiving.
such as it is.
I'm sorry I left, Nick, but sometimes it is really hard to deal with this whole situation.
well, I'll quit.
why don't I-- why don't I quit?
I don't want you to quit.
I feel like you're slipping away, like things are just spiraling out of control, for--for both of us.
why don't I drive up there right now?
no.
we're just about to sit down and eat.
just take the night, relax.
we'll still be here tomorrow.
all right.
well, I'll drive up in the morning.
I love you, Nick.
and I'm...
I'm really--I'm trying.
you know that, right?
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying, too, lise.
we'll get through this.
I know we will.
all right.
I love you.
I love you, too.
my Father Worked As A Lawyer For The Richest Family In New York

I Can't Wait For You To Paint Me.
it's Been Two Weeks.
you Can't Rush The Master, Sofia.
I Know. You Have Your Process.
no, It's Not A Process. It's A Way Of Life.
unlike My Desire,
which I Can Expend On You Four Times A Day...
five.
my Inspiration Can't Just Be Turned On.
it Needs Time To Build,
to Gather.
and Then It Explodes Onto The Canvas.
does That Inspire You?
I' Start Tomorrow.
Oh! Oh.
it's Been A While Since We Did That In The Morning.
I'll Say.
since We Did That Period.
everything Old Is New Again.
was It Okay For You? You Seemed...
are You Kidding Me? That Was Sensational.
it's Just, You Know, My Leg Is A Little Sore, That's All.
Oh. You're Still Mad I Shot You.

I Wrote You Ten E-Mails Last Night.
you Never Responded.
well, What's The Matter? I Think I'm Being Followed.
what Exactly Makes You Think That? It's Just A Feeling.
I Got Home From Class Last Night,
and Things Were Just Out Of Place.
I Can't Explain It. I Think Someone Had Been Here.
okay. I'll Be Over As Soon As I Can. Bye.
who The Hell Is That?
robert Russell. The Painter?
Mm-hmm. Well, Tell Him To Go Away.
I Can't. He's Having Second Thoughts
about The Jeremy Darling Project.
Oh, It's A Project Now?
Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Jeremy Is Actually Coming By The Gallery This Morning
to Learn From Robert How To Draw
and To Collect His Five Works In Progress Of Sofia
so He Can Fake Being A Painter In Real Time,
and Robert's Starting To Feel Like The Whole Thing Is Putting His Integrity At Stake.
it's Pretty Bad. Welcome To Life With The Darlings.
hello.
Nick, It's Simon Elder.
Hey, Simon. What's Up?
can You Come Over To My Office?
this Morning?
Yeah. Say, 10: 00?
Yeah, Sure. Is Everything All Right?
I'll Tell You When You Get Here.
it's, Um, It's A Delicate Matter.
I'll See You Then.
Bye, Nick.
what's So Delicate?
you.
Hey. How About Some Cherry Lemonade?
Oh, Yeah. I'd Love Some.
so What Are You Doing Tonight?
it's The Annual "Nutcracker" Evening With The Darlings.
it's A Family Tradition. Oh, Oh.
Why? Well, I Have Someone Important
coming In From Out Of Town I'd Like You To Meet.
all Right. Then I'll Be There. Done.
Mmm. That's Perfection.
you Really Know How To Treat A Girl.
most Peopl Want The Same Things
Suga.
salt...
attention.
you...
are The Best Kser.
what Are You Doing Here?
I Came To Tell You
what, That Nothing's Changed?
that's A Lie.
that I'm Still Your Son? Lie.
that You Still Love Me?
that Was Never True.
so Maybe That's The One Thing That Won't Change.
no. Everything Has Changed. Everything.
you're Not My Son.
I Spent Most Of Your Life Trying To Find Me In You,
and I Never Could.
now We Know Why.
I Loved Your Dad.
and I Came To Tell You That I...
look Forward To Having This Relationship With You.
I've Got A Meeting To Get To.
Reverend Darling,
we've Known Each Other A While, Yes?
ten Long Years.
and I Watched You Proudly As You Foundour Own Special Way.
unique.
you Always Did Things Differently, Brian.
that Has Been Your Blessing.
thank You.
but This Independent Spirit Of Yours Is Also Your Downfall.
it Pains Me To Have This Conversation With You.
not As Much As It Pains Me.
in The Same Period Of Time
when You Were Righteously Ministering To Your Flock,
you Initiated A Sexual Relationship With A Parishioner,
fathered A Child Out Of Wedlock
and Most Recently...
bribed Judge.
itas An Arbitrator, Actually.
Oh, Brian. I Wanted To Get My Son Back,
and His Mother Was Gonna Whisk Him Away To Stupid Brazil,
and Just--Ju When I Started To Connect To Him.
and You Felt You Had
but To Commit A Felony?
I'm Sorry, Brian.
the State Board Has Decided To Suspe You For Six Months,
during Which Time,
you Are Expected To Undergo Counseling For Sexual Addiction
and Attend A Series Of Workshops.
who Esn't Love Workshops?
you Have A Lot Of Work To Do.
and You Have A Lot Of Questions To Ask Yourself.
about What?
whether You Still Feel Called To Serve The Lord.
so What's This All About?
before I Tell You, I Want To Make Sure That We're Still Cool.
we're Okay. I Have Some Concerns.
about? Tell Me.
let's Get It All Out.
that Night Up At Valhalla, When Tripp Told His Story
about Your Parents Working For The Darling Family, Immigrating To Russia. Yeah?
it Did Leave Me With Some Questions About You
and Your Intentions Regarding The Family.
I Assure You,
the Only Connection They Have To My Vision For New York
now, Today Is That They're In The Way.
but It's Nothing Personal. It's Not.
I'm Listening.
I Need You To--Well...
I Would Like For You To Get Me Copies Of Darling Enterprises' Profit And Loss Statements For The Last Five Years
and A List Of All Their Holdings.
Simon, The Only People Who Have Access To That Information Are Members Of The Fily.
you're Part Of The Family, Right?
that's Pretty Sizeable Betrayal You're Asking Me To Perpetrate.
no. Don't Think Of It As A Betrayal.
it's Synthesis.
is That It?
uh, No. No. There Is One More Thing.
I Have Started Seeing Someone Romantically,
and I Wanted To Tell You.
so That I Could Congratulate You?
it's Karen Dling.
Really?
okay.
I Know You Two Have A History.
we Do, But It's Pretty Far Back, Really.
I'm More Concerned
that This Might Be Some Sort Of Plan Of Yours To Tear Karen Away From Tripp
the Way Thatou Did With Patrick.
Patrick Followed His Heart. It Had Nothing To Do With Me.
as For Karen... Listen, I Genuinely Like Her.
I Think She's A Very Dynamic Woman.
but I Won't Pursue Her
if It's Gonna Be A Probl For Me And You.
our Relationship Is Too Important.
is It Gonna Be A Problem?
why Should It Be?
look, You're Both Adults. It's Fine.
okay.
is Everybody Excited About "The Nutcracker"?
I Don't Think I'm Gonna Be Able To Make It. Why?
because... I'm Gonna Be Out And About.
it's "The Nutcracker."
I'm Sorry, Mom, But I'm Nna Be Busy.
if She's Busy,
she's Busy.
I Think You're Freaked Out About Attending A Family Event Without A Lover To Protect You From The Intimacy Of Your Tribe.
you've Been Spending So Much Time Living From Your Swadhisthana,
you Need To Get Up Into Your Anahata
and Start Feeling It.
I Learned That In The Seychelles.
honey, I'm Reay Starting To Regret
giving You My Honeymoon.
you Know Who Really Needs A Honeymoon? Oh, Brian.
poor Guy.
I Know. Mom, What Are We Gonna Do About That?
if I Woke Up Tomorrow And Knew That
I Didn't Really Belong Here... I Would Kill Myself.
hang On. Hang On. Just Because Brian Is Not My Biological Son
does Not Mean That He Does Not Belong. He's Still Your Brother.
stop It.
Hello, Dear.
are You All Talking About Me? No.
I Know. We're Not All Related.
I'm Sorry. Not My Fault.
there's Somebody Downstairs For You, Some Guy.
ha Ha. Okay.
Oh, Well, I-I Don't Know What May Have Happened To Her On Those Distant Green Islands,
but It Was Certainly Salutary.
Kai! You're Here! You Made It.
I Made It. It Was Quite A Journey.
how Was Your Flight? Did You Fly First Class?
I Told 'Em To Make Sure That You Flew First Class.
Yes, I Did, And It Was... Wild.
I-I Don't Think I've Ever Been Treated This Well On Land Or In Midair.
uh, Sir, May I Take That Bag Upstairs For You?
I'm Okay, Man. Thank You Very Much.
I Missed You So Much.
I Missed You, Too.
everything's Falling Apart
I've Lost My Wife, My Daughters,
my Onetime Mistress, My Son.
I Found Out My Father's Not My Father,
and--and Now I've Lost My Job.
I Mean, What's Next, Leprosy?
Yeah, It Sounds To Me Like You Need To Be Patient.
the Bishop Has Outlined A Program Where Eventually You Can Regain Your Post.
but I'm Not Sure I Want To.
y-you're So Good At It.
the Sermon That You Gave... At Karen's Wedding
it Was Fine. I Whipped Itogether.
and Those Baptismal Prayers
you Wrote For Patrick And Ellen's Children,
those--those Were Published. Because I'm A Darling. Was.
Oh, Brian-- You Know What I Mean.
well, You Can't Deny You Have A Way Of Articulating The Questions That People Have About God And Faith
because They're The Questions I've Got, In Spades.
the Truth Is,
I've Never Really Felt The Presence Of The Lord
the Way Other People Say That They Do.
never? I Find That Hard To Believe.
sure, I Get Weepy At Christmas,
the Crucifixion Kind Of Gets To Me,
but That's Not The Same As Actually Having Faith.
do You Think This Is All Coming Up
because Of Recent Revelations?
well, My So-Called Brothers And Sisters Are Treating Me
the Way They Always Have, Mom, Like An Alien.
but This Is About Faith.
and I'm Not Sure I Ever Really Had Any.
well, Maybe You Should Talk To Your Father, Then.
he's Not My Father.
he Raised You, Brian.
go To Him.
there.
didn't That Settle You Down A Little?
Yeah, It Did.
Thanks, Mom.
Hey, Where's Picasso?
he'll Be Here In A Minute.
his Name Is Robert Russell, And You Better Be Nice To Him 'Cause He's Doing You A Big Favor, All Right?
okay.
that Is One Big Sponge.
Yeah, It Just Arrived From Berlin.
what Do You Clean With It? Like, Big Art?
it Is Art, Jeremy. It Just Sold For $150, 000.
I Don't Think I'vever Said This,
but That Seems Overpriced.
maybe, Maybe Not. Depends On Who's Buying It.
the Way I See It, Is When You Buy Art,
you're Buying A Window.
when You Look At The Art, Whether It's A Painting
or A Sculpture Or Whatever, And You See Through It Into Something New, It's Worth It.
I See A Sponge.
me, Too.
I Wish You Could Stay Forever.
but My Uncle Is Counting On Me To Come Back.
Oh, It's Just That...
everything Feels So Different With You Here.
well, Then We'll Just Make Sure
we Make These Two Weeks Last.
okay.
financial Statements And A List Of All Our Holdings?
so What Do You Want Me To Do?
I Think We Should Give 'Em To Him.
okay.
this Is What We've Been Waiting For.
isn't This Mr. Elder Showing Us His Hand?
are You Gonna Have Somebody Doctor The Numbers?
cause If You Are, I Don't Want To Take Any Part In That.
Nick, Come On.
you Know, We're Just Gonna Show Him What We Want Him To See.
I'll Have The Accountant Put Together Some Papers.
Karen Will Bring Them Over To Your Office, Okay?
we Have Mr. Elder Exactly Where We Want Him.
all Right.
I'll See You Later.
Simon Elder Just Asked For Our Financial Reports.
find Out What He's Up To, Okay
here You Go.
profit And Loss Statements R Darling Enterpris
going Five Years Back.
whatcha Gonna Do With Them?
nothing. I'm Just Making Sure Everything Is In Order.
Nick, Seriously, What Are You And Daddy Up To?
there's Something You're Not Telling Me.
you're Right, Karen. There Is, And I'm Not.
how's Simon Elder?
you Heard About That?
Yes, I Have, And It's Only A Matter Of Time
before Your Father Hears About It As Well.
not From Me. I Won't Tell Him, I Wouldn't Want To See His Face.
Nick, All Simon And I Do Is Talk, Okay?
we Talk About Different Ways To Make The World A Better Place.
you Could Join Us Sometime On One Of Our Talks. Might Be Fun.
thank You, No.
your Loss. Promise Me Something? What?
don't Tell Daddy. I Promise, I Won't.
okay.
you Gonna "Nutcracker" With The Fam Tonight? Yeah, I Am.
you?
no. No. I, Uh, I'm Kinda Over It.
but You Kids Have Fun.
Bye.
it's All Right.
it's Okay.
I'm Here, Baby.
everything's Gonna Be Justine.
it's Not, Though.
when I Got Home Last Night,
I Could Tell Little Things Had Been Moved.
those Drawers Were Open.
that Light Was On. I Know I Turned It Off.
what Are You Looking For?
bugs.
bugs?
surveillance Devices.
detective Darling.
well, I Want You To Be Safe, Right?
you Do Believe Me, Don't You, Paddy?
I Believe You. Of Course I Do.
in Fact, I'm Gonna Put Somebody Right Outside That Door, 24/7.
the Police?
unfortunately, I Can't Involve The Police With This
because I'm The Attorney General,
and You're Not My Wife.
but Don't Worry. I'm Not Gonna Let Anything Happen To You.
trust Me?
so You Have Some Doubts Out God.
you Think That Means You Have To Vacate Your Post?
I Mean, There Are Lots Of Beneficial Values Transmitted By Religion.
I Guess I Just Thought That It Would Be
a Good Time To Become Authentic.
did You Ever Believe?
Really?
I Don't Know.
the Idea Of It Always Interested Me.
the Idea?
the Idea That There's Something That Gives Its Life Up
to Make Room For More Life.
that I Find Fascinating.
no, Don't. No, Seriously.
I've Always Envied You...
your... Life Of The Mind.
Yeah.
I Mean, Me, I'm--I've Been Stuck
I Mean, I've Seen Myself Referred To As An "Empire Builder.
that's Not Me.
that Was My Grandfather.
me, I'm An Empire Maintainer.
do You Really Want To Leave Behind The World Of Ideas?
what Could Be Better?
I Don't Know.
I Really Don't Know What To Do.
I Can't Tell You What To Do.
that--that's For You To Decide.
sorry. Not Gonna Happen.
he's Not Coming?
robert Said He's Really Interested In Helping You Out,
but He Started Painting This Morning,
he's On A Roll And He Doesn't Want To Stop Working On It, - So He's--He's Really Sorry. - Is That Really What He Said?
no.
he Said He Feels Like A Whore.
so What Am I Gonna Do?
if Sofia Finds Out I'm Not An Artist,
she'll Just Think I'm Poor For No Good Reason, And Then...
wait A Minute. Look At You.
what?
you're Not So Different From Her--Your Height,
your Hips, Your Clothes. - What's Your Point, Jeremy?
let Me Just Draw You. It Could Be Practice.
if It Turns Out Any Good, I Could Use It For Sofia.
it's Kind Of A Great Idea.
it's Kind Of Not. You Can't Draw,
and I Can't Just Sit Here And Have You Look At Me.
I Wouldn't Want You Sitting. I Want You...
standing,
right Where You Are.
I'm Very Uncomfortable With This.
I Have Just The Thing That Could Make You Feel Much Less Uncomfortable.
how About A Little Smoky?
no.
this Is My Workplace.
which Is Closed,
and We Need To Chillax--
me To Draw,
you To Pose.
you're Bad.
and This Is A Bad Idea.
I Know.
Hey.
Hi.
this Is Who You Wanted Me To Meet?
I'd Like You To Meet Princess Ama, From Ghana.
pleasure.
hello.
okay. Well...
she's My Ex-Wife.
we Met In The Middle Of The Ocean.
how'd You Guys Wrangle That?
my Father And I Took A Trip To Jeffreys Bay In South Africa To Scatter My Mother's Ashes.
but After We Had Scattered Her Ashes,
I Could Not Sleep.
I Walked Out Past The Hotel Pool,
onto The Beach And Into The Ocean.
I Swam And Swam, Weeping.
I Missed Her So Much.
？？
it Lit The Sky.
and Just When I Realized I Had Gone So Far,
I Probably Could Not Get Back...
what Happened?
I Hit My Head On The Side Of A Little Boat.
and He Was In It.
he Helped Me Into The Boat,
and We Have Been Together Ever Since.
you, Um...
you Guys Aren't Still Married, Right?
no, No, No, No.
we're Divorced.
Yes, Marriage For Us Was A-A Way Of Keeping Our Distance.
not Good.
no...
what?
what Did She Say?
she Approves.
lucky Me.
just Doing My Job, Ma'am.
I Know Patrick And Mr. Darling Are On The Outs,
but When He Called And Asked Me To Look In On You,
well, What Can I Say?
your Family, As Much As I Am, Anyway.
thanks For Heating That Up For Me.
I'm Just Sorry I Don't Have Anything To Feed You.
I Haven't Been Able To Get Out.
I Could Make You Some Cookies.
Oh, That's Sweet, Ma'am, But Sugar And Stakeouts,
that's Where Those Cops Go Wrong.
steamed Rice And Hard-Boiled Eggs
it's Good For The Brain, Keeps Me Sharp.
I Can Actually See In The Dark. - You've Done This Kind Of Thing Before?
because This Is The First Time I've Ever...
I've Never Played The Damsel In Distress.
I've Been With The Family For 17 Years, Ma'am.
I've Seen Plenty,
and We've Gotten Through All Of It.
so...
don't Worry.
also, I Put A Plant In The Plant.
a Plant In The Plant?
a Camera.
there's A Live Feed Right Into My Car.
I'm Just A Few Yards Away, So Relax
thank You, Clark.
sleep Tight, Ma'am.
you Know What's Funny?
if You Told Me Six Months Ago
that I, Jeremy Darling,
would Be Working In A Parking Garage
and Would Be Pretending To Be A Painter,
I Would Not Believe You.
life Is Full Of Surprises, Isn't It?
it Is. - Mm-Hmm.
I'm A Sucky Artist.
Aww.
I Am.
look. But...
you Know, I'm Getting Better.
I'm Quite Surprised.
that's My Point. That Is My Point. - Yeah.
you Know What?
you Should Try Being Yourlf With Sofia.
you Need To Be Honest,
and Letting Things Unfold Naturally, Organically.
you Think So?
I Do.
lying Will Slowly Kill Your Insides, Jeremy.
once She Sees Who You Are
she'll Be Able To Love You For What You Are.
tell Her The Truth.
it May Surprise You.
and It Might Just Disappoint Everybody Supremely.
what Just Happened?
I'm Losing My Husband.
what, To Karen?
give Me A Break.
to All Of You.
you're Stoned.
no, No.
ever Since He Took This Job, He's Just Been Slipping Away.
he's Never Around, You Know?
he Comes Home Late, He Leaves Early,
he's Always So Busy.
and Kiki And I Are Just...
there, You Know?
We--We...
we Feel Like We Have To Compete.
we're...
we' There.
we're...
we're There. We're...
we're There Missing Him
and Loving Him,
and He's Off Doing God Knows What For All Of You. And...
he Doesn't Have To.
we Had A Good Life Before He Took This Job.
he Doesn't Need To Do This. He Doesn't.
I Don't Get It. I Don't.
and I'm Sorry, Because I'm Stoned.
I'm Being Stupid. I'm Rambling. I'm Sorry.
I Don't Get It Either.
if You Were Mine...
I'd Be A Couch Potato.
hmm?
you're Sitting On My Lap.
I Know.
it Feels Nice.
don't Do That Again, Okay?
okay.
damn It.
God.
is That You?
Hey, Dad, Where's Mom?
she Couldn't Make It. She Got Hung Up At The Gallery.
Really?
Yep.
I Have To Marry Into This Family.
well, Kiki, I'm Not Sure That's The Right Attitude To Be Cultivating.
you Don't Hate Ballets, Do You?
this Isn't Gonna Drive You Away?
no, No. This Is Interesting.
we Definitely Don't Have Anything Like This Where I Come From.
good. I Can't Wait To See You See It.
Hey. What Are You Doing Here?
nothing.
sit Down.
Karen, You Okay?
I'm Fine.
something Happen Between You And Simon?
I Don't Want To Talk About It.
Karen, You Can Tell Me. - Nothing Happened.
all Right.
that Has To Be The Prettiest Dress On Earth.
thank You.
good Evening, Everybody.
shall We Start The Show?
Mrs. Gla, You Here To See Your Big Blue Sponge?
I Am.
it's Really Big.
may I Touch It?
of Course. It's Yours, Most.
Oh, My God.
it Reeks.
Oh, No, No. That's The Thai Food We Had Last Night.
we?
me. A Wee Bit Of Thai Food. - Sorry.
it's Marijuana.
I Would Know That Smell Anywhere.
I Had A Stoner Husband For Four Years,
and This Is What Everything Smelled Like, All The Time.
this And Patchouli.
God, It...
it Is. It's Pot, Isn't It?
I'm Sure If Someone Did Smoke Pot Near The Sponge,
the Smell Wouldn't Be Absorbed Permanently, Ma'am.
it's A Sponge.
absorbing Is What They Do.
um, Alex, Please, Wait. - Mrs. Glass, I'm Sure There's Something We Can Do.
I Don't Want That Thing.
it Smells And It Reminds Me Of Hugh.
well, You Just Killed A $150, 000 Sale.
I'm Sorry.
no, You're Not. You're Fired.
you Sleep Okay?
mm, In And Out.
had Espresso At 10: 00 Last Night.
made My Brain A Little Jumpy.
silly Thing To Do.
are You Okay?
are You Settling In To Us?
Oh, Sure I Am. Yeah.
I Am Grateful For All Of This,
all Of You That You're Still Willing To Give Me.
it's Clarky. - Mm.
he's Calling.
uh, Hey, Clarky, What's Cooking?
sir,
you Need To Come Over Here.
uh, What's The Matter?
it's Carmelita, Sir.
I Don't Know How It Happened, But...
she's Gone.
okay. Well, Um,
thanks For Calling, Clark.
I'll Get Right On It.
right.
it's Fingernail Polish, Sir.
it Seems He Or She Came In Through The Bathroom Window,
went Straight Into The Bedroom
and Waited There To Seize Carmelita.
they Managed To Elude The Ficus.
how Could This Happen?
I'm Sorry, Sir. I...
I Am.
me, Too.
she's Gone.
well, Look At You.
what A Beautiful Suit.
Yeah, It Was In My Closet.
how's It Feel?
like A Uniform.
well, I'll Give You Some Suspenders.
it'll Take The Edge Off.
so...
speak.
well, Last Night I Did Some Thinking.
And?
I Wasn't Able To Come To Any Conclusion.
every Time I Imagined Leaving The Church,
I Got So Anxious, I Realized I Had To Go Back.
and Every Time I Imagined Staying,
I...
felt So Trapped, I Realized I Had To Leave.
well, That Sounds Like A Hard Way To Spend An Evening.
it's A Hard Way To Spend A Life.
Yeah, But That's Over Now, Right?
Yeah.
and After I Thought About It For A Long Time,
I Stopped Thinking,
and I Prayed.
and Did You Get Your Answer?
Yeah, I Did.
from God?
I Think So.
what Did...
he-she Have To Say?
I'd Like To Come Work For You.
I Think It's Best For Me
and For Darling Enterprises.
this Is God Talking, Right,
not Your Mother?
she Doesn't Even Know I'm Here.
well.
far Be It From Me To Ignore The...
still Small Voice Of The Lord.
welcome To The Company, Son.
thank You.
did We Have A Meeting?
I Just Need A Minute.
it's Okay.
what's Going On? You Seem Like Something
I Don't Know What Happened Between You And Karen Last Night.
and I Don't Want To Know,
but I Am Telling You To Stay Away From Her.
Why?
I Mean, I Knew She Was Upset About--- I Said I Don't Want To Know.
there Is A City Full Of Women, A World Full Of Women, Out There For You, Son-- Why Her?
you Can Have Any Woman You Want.
now If You Care About Our Business Relationship At All,
if You've Been Sincere With Me About Your Intentis, Your Vision For The City,
and If You're Not Just In This To Destroy The Darlings, - Let Her Go. - Did Tripp Send You To Say This?
no.
this Is Between You And Me
you Are A Married Man.
Simon, That Is Not What This Is About.
let Her Go.
all Right. I'll Let Her Go.
thank You.
five Years
financial Statements.
this Is Incredible.
no, It's Not.
it's Business.
well, It Kind Of Look Like Me...
mm, Maybe If I-- If I Squint.
okay, All Right, Sofia,
I-I Need To Tell You Something Right Now,
because I...
I Don't--I Don't Want My Insides To Die Any More Than They Already Have.
what, You're--You're Sick?
Oh, No, No, No. I'm--I'm Sick-- I'm Sick Of Lying.
cause, Sofia, I Am-- I Am--I Am Not A Painter.
I Didn't--I Didn't Paint Any Of These.
I Mean, I Did Do This Sketch, Which Is Why It...
really Sucks, But...
what Are You Talking About?
I Lied To You...
about Everything.
I--All These Paintings And, Um...
by Pretending That They Were Mine So That You'd Think I Was A-A Poor Artist
and Not Some Rich, Lazy Ass, Which Is Actually What I Am.
because, Sofia, My Last Name Isn't Babeson.
it's Darling.
my Family Is Worth $35 Billion.
am I Supposed To Believe This?
I Know. It's Crazy.
but You See, I Wanted To Make Sure That You Liked Me
before You Knew The Truth Because I Have Suffered Too Much At The Hands Of These Love Pirates.
Sofia, Now That You Know Who I Am,
you Can Love Me For What I Am, Right?
I Trusted You, You...
I Know, I Know. I'm So Sorry.
no, I'm Sorry.
you Think Because You Tell Me The Truth,
it's Gonna Be Okay?
that's Not The Way To Treat People.
I Don't Care Who You Are,
how Much Money You Have.
Bye, Jeremy Babeson Or...
whatever.
I Have Something To Tell You.
last Night, I Was Sitting With You And Your Family,
and I Realized Something.
I Want To Stay Here.
you Are Staying Here.
no, I Mean Indefinitely.
what About Your Uncle?
Oh, I E-Mail Him Last Night. It's Okay. He's Cool.
he Has, Like, Nine Other Nephews.
Oh, This Is The Best Day Ever!
okay, Well, We Have To Go Shopping
before We Do Anything Else.
for What? - Warm Clothes. It's Cold Outside,
and You're Not Totally Acclimated Yet.
Juliet. - What?
I Didn't Come Here From The Seychelles For You To Take Care Of Me Like Some Kind Of Poodle, Okay?
I Know.
I Came Because...
I Came For You. Okay?
Yes.
can I Give You One Gift?
no. I Just Said No Gifts.
I Want...
I Want You To Be My First.
your First?
you Know...
my First.
tonight?
whenever.
but I Want It To Be You.
hmm?
you're Amazing.
I'll Take One Of Those.
Hey.
you Okay?
Yeah. I'm All Right.
I Got Fired Today.
what?
Yeah.
Cheers.
uh, Cheers.
well, You Want To Tell Me What Happened?
I Was Stupid.
when Jeremy Came To The Gallery Yesterday,
he Smoked Pot,
and The Smoke Permeated This Giant Blue German Sponge,
and This Lady Was Gonna Buy It,
and She Freaked Out And Changed Her Mind.
okay.
and Did You Do It, Too, Get High?
Yeah.
I Did.
I See.
maybe I Wanted Something Bad To Happen
to Just... Shake Things Up.
well, Inviting The Darlings Into Any Situation Is Definitely Increases The Chances Of Things Getting Shaken Up.
now You Know How I Feel.
do I?
Yeah.
Yeah, You Do.
I'm Sorry I'm Unemployed.
it's Okay. We Got Plenty Of Money.
you Want To Have Another Kid?
are You--Really?
Yeah.
I Love You.
I Love You, Too.
you All Right?
Yeah.
Hey. I'm Fine.
okay.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Darling.
you Wanted To Talk To Me?
Yeah.
we're Not In Over Our Heads With This Thing, Are We?
what Thing?
you And Simon Elder.
you Okay?
Yeah, I'm--I'm Fine.
what--you Don't-- Don't Worry About That.
you Promise Me You're Not Getting Emotionally Involved.
I'm Not.
I Promise.
because You Told Me That Was Absolutely Not Part Of The Plan.
I Know.
I really like your shower.
well, to be honest with you, baby,
it's better with you in it.
all these nozzles-- they're very useful.
I am never getting out of here.
Karen's phone.
uh, yeah. Is karen there?
she's busy, nick. Can i take a message?
no, that's a right. Thanks.
no, thank you.
who was that?
Oh, it was a... Wrong number.
are you ready to help me with that little thingy i need help with?
Oh, yeah.
I'm coming right up.
look, i know this isn't easy,
so anytime you want to talk about it,
we can talk about it, okay?
do you still love mom?
Yes, but-- 0but what?
you said we could talk about it.
right, but there are some questions which
I mean, it seems like there's a direct answer to
or a relatively direct answ -too many words, dad.
what do you want from me?
mom! -hi.
Hey.
Hey. Listen, everything's in the bag
the pajamas, toothbrush-- there's also
a permission slip for a field trip you have to sign.
Thanks.
I will see you in 48 hours.
well, unless you want to talk before that.
about?
I don't know. Us?
ki, can i have a minute?
thank you.
it's certainly been enough for ki.
I'm not going to get together with you just to be judged.
Lisa, i want to make this work, okay?
so let's have your mom watch ki tonight,
and we'll have dinner, just to talk.
say yes, mom.
are you sure you're all right, mrs. Darling?
you seem a little... Giddy.
of course i am, clark.
I'm a free woman,
giddy to drink in the colors of the fall
before they fade.
Mrs. Darling, i could... I could drive if you want.
I'm fine.
I barely touched my mimosa at breakfast.
good day.
so, simon, what exactly brings you here?
I heard you had opened a gallery,
so i just wanted to stop in and take a look,
and then i saw this.
though he's a little too obvious with his derivations
without being really clear about his intentions,
I- i just-- i keep coming back to it.
best kind of art is the kind you can't make up your mind about.
ambivalence. -exactly.
we both know a lot ab out that, hmm?
I'm sorry?
I mean, we're both with people who can'make up their minds.
I thought you said you came here for the art.
I did. I did. I'll take the painting.
and while i'm here, lisa, i'll also give you this.
it's a conversation between my karen and your nick
captured by my security cameras.
it's worth watching,
even if...
just to clear up a few ambiguities.
yeah?
well, let me clear up some of yours.
I'm not sure what kind of thing gets you off,
but i'm not the kind of woman who spies on my husband.
will that be cash or charge?
well, let me spell it out for you.
everyone you recommended, dad, to be my chief of staff
every one of them-- in one way or another,
belongs to you,
she prosecuted your mother.
exactly.
what better way to demonstrate that i don't hold a grudge
and that i'm someone who's willing
to reach across the aisle and
Oh, paddy.
Mr. Darling, perhaps your hearing
isn't what it used to be.
I beg your pardon.
your son has already given me the job.
now let's get down to business.
what do you suggest, nola?
committee assignments.
we hear you folks have thoughts.
I fish in hampshire in england...
he can get you a seat. -that's great, dad, -except we were thinking-- -you're not listening, patrick.
foreign affairs.
it positions you perfectly for a first-term run at the white house.
we've got a different idea.
Oh, but of course you do.
well, let's-- let's hear them out, tripp.
with all the recent controversy
you know, the death, the fire, the transsexuality of it all
we think avoiding the spotlight would be best.
show we're sious. We're thinking agriculture.
agriculture?
you heard it right, dad. Agriculture.
Patrick wants tonotexploit his family connections
too avidly right out of the gate.
all right. Okay.
you've obviously come here with your minds made up.
it was really nothing.
I couldn't agree more.
your father doesn't like strong women, does he?
he likes mom.
I said strong, not murderous.
Hey! What are you doing here?
what the hell? What is she doing here?
she's my chief of staff.
we've got a meeting in the mayor's office in ten minutes, senator.
sorry, jerms. Gotta run.
Oh, my.
it wasn't my fault.
you were intoxicated and you were driving the coupe.
poor girl.
well, the doctor said she's gonna be fine, tripp.
he meant the coupe.
you should thank your lucky stars, tish.
the young woman agreeing to be treated here
saves us the possibility of this turning into tabloid fodder.
she rode up on that bicycle out of nowhere,
only blocks from our house.
I mean, this is obviously some sort of a scam.
well, it happened to my friend lucy tennbrook only last year.
Oh, she lost millions.
I say we go back to that intersection -and talk to witnesses. -absolutely not.
we are two weeks removed from your having been on trial for murder.
the last thing we need is another scandal.
he's right, i'm afraid.
she'll be better taken care of here than in any hospital.
lovely.
speak with the young woman, nick.
Ah, you're awake.
mind if i come in?
um, who are you?
Nick george, family lawyer.
Oh, of course. Um, wrenn darcy.
nice to officially meet you.
don't worry. I'm not planning on suing anyone.
well, whether you decide to sue or not is entirely up to you.
I'm just here to make sure you have everything you need.
well, then you're good at your job.
I have an on-call nurse and a maid
and this person who just keeps fluffing my pillow.
welcome to life with the darlings.
is there anyone i should call,
let 'em know you're okay?
no. My family is all up in maine.
besides, they don't really worry about me.
believe it or not, working the fragrance counter at bendel's
I should probably go.
no, wait. The doctor wants us to watch you for a while
and make sure you don't have a concussion.
trust me, i'm-- i'm completely sound
so please thank the darlings for their hospitality.
tell them if they ever need a house sitter...
just...
you a little dizzy? -a little.
all right. Well, just, uh, just rest, okay?
what?
uh, you're just not my idea of a family lawyer.
get some rest.
okay, counselor.
it's worse than i thought.
at this stage, unfortunately,
the only treatment with any real odds of success
and so what are those odds?
optimistically, about 10% chance of surving 12 months.
in bed...
sick, in never-ending pain?
so what, are you just gonna give up?
I want to spend the time that i have left
teaching our son how to live, brian,
not how to die.
I can't say that i would recommend your choice,
but i certainly understand it.
so what about the good stuff?
the good stuff?
the n. I.h. trial i read about at this hospital, quackenbush.
the waiting list to get into the next run of that trial
is over a year long.
I'm sorry.
Hey, grim reaper,
I know how this works, so...
how much is it gonna take to get her into that trial?
I'm gonna pretend we're not having this conversation.
good. I'm gonna pretend i'm talking to a human being.
there's a woman in there with an 8-year-old son.
the sad truth, mr. Darling,
is that there are thousands of women with equally life-threatening cases
who actually want the treatment.
you want to play rough? Let's play rough.
you know that building you're about to break ground on,
the $100-million children's cancer wing,
the one bearing your stupid name?
what if i prevent my family
from signing the check they promised?
it's andrea's decision, mr. Darling.
my family's putting up half the jing for that wing.
you make it happen. I'll take care of andrea.
she's gonna be okay.
and she's not looking to make any trouble.
thank god.
but i think for her sake and for the sake of avoiding a scandal,
you're going to have a houseguest for a while.
Nicky, do you honestly think it's safe having her here?
as long as you don't take her for a dve.
Letitia...whatever the girl needs, she shall have.
she's the injured party. That's how it should be.
shades of lucy tennbrook.
you're kidding me, right?
you say you want me out of your life,
and then you get a job working for my brother?
I fell on hard times.
or should i say i was pushed?
or maybe it's neither one.
maybe you are just obsessed with all things darling.
I mean, if you're not prosecuting a darling,
you're sleeping with one.
if you're not sleeping with a darling...
what exactly are you doing for my brother?
Patrick, unlike some people to whom he's related, has guts.
he was generous enough to give me a second chance
when my career fell into the crapper thanks to you.
Oh, so this is your way of getting back at me, right,
by cozying up to patrick?
get over yourself, jeremy. I have.
you should, too, pronto.
you look pretty. -thank you.
ki and i spent an hour and a half picking out this outfit.
can you imagine? Being nervous for a date with my husband.
not to say this is a date, because i...
how are you doing?
honestly?
it's weird
after all these years to wake up alone every day.
I guess i'd feel pretty weird, too,
if i was actually sleeping.
you know, you could move back in?
I want to make this work, lise.
I do, too,
completely, but i...
But?
Simon elder stopped by the gallery today.
what the hell did he want?
he bought a painting, a very expensive one,
and he mentioned something about karen,
about a conversationou had
I did speak with karen recently.
I told her not to marry simon.
okay.
the only reason that simon wants to marry her
I had to tell her not to do it. I was doing my job.
I want us to work, -we can't. -she's not.
promise me.
Karen darling will no longer be a part of your life
or ours-- anymore.
I promise you, karen darling and i are done.
Nick george is here to see you.
okay, send him in.
that's all for now, gentlemen. Thank you.
well...
Hello, nick.
you don't seem too happy. What's the problem?
the problem is that you need to stay away from my wife.
okay, i can't speak for you,
but usually, when i'm this angry,
it's from a lack of perspective.
so...
so let me help you out.
...save the company. -i don't care about the company.
at least, it's not my first concern.
well, then what is?
you...
and me.
now it's not on youtube yet but what do you think?
it's good for a few hits, hmm?
...his company are insane.
you can't just show up here
whenever you want and screw with my head, nick!
I know!
I'm sorry, okay? You're right.
Karen, i don't want to see you make a huge mistake.
then step up.
see?
you mess with my lady, you mess with my stuff,
I mess with yours.
just consider it a life lesson.
I mean, you can't learn everything you know from tripp darling.
I'show you out, but i have a feeling, by now,
you know the way.
so... What do you think?
I think i'm a lucky man, able to look at someone i love
and know she feels exactly the same way for me.
that's the most precious thing in the world.
let me take you out tonight.
Oh, i'm sorry. I can't. I have a family dinner.
with the same family that disowned you?
well, yeah, mommy made me promise i'd come
so that's what goes on at these darling family dinners?
Yeah.
page six" would be very disappointed.
but i will see you after, though, okay?
you bet. -okay.
all right. -oh, come on. Up you go.
caught you lookin'. -yes, you did.
what?
there's a dinner tonight at the imperial.
do what you have to,
just make sure you're there.
relax. I told you, patrick's ready to go with agriculture.
Tripp gave in. -okay, don't be fooled.
one thing tripp darling doesn't do is give in.
I can't launchmy biofuel next quarter without some high-profile political support.
I need patrick on that committee.
I'm not interested in spending any more time with these people than i have to.
then let me be the first to remind you... You have to.
Hey, swami, big news. You're in.
in what?
the trial.
the experimental cancer drug-- i pulled some strings.
I told you i didn't want treatment,
experimental or otherwise.
do you know what it took me to get you into this?
let me guess, brian.
money?
you amaze me.
because i have values? -because you're so selfish!
you know, whatever you think you're proving
when you should be taking medicine
I am proving that there is mo to life than avoiding death.
listen to me, you willful bitch.
you're gonna take the meds and thank me.
you are such an idiot.
why do you get to me so?
I'm not bothering you, am i?
not in the least.
in fact, it's a pleasure to hear.
please... Keep playing.
okay.
don't be fooled. This...
this is the only song i can play.
I'm what my piano teacher called... Unmotivated.
I'm glad you're up and about.
it's a good sign.
and truth be told,
it's been refreshing to have you in the house,
though i regret the circumstances that brought you to us.
my wife...
she keeps life interesting.
Yeah. I read the papers.
well, you must love her very much.
I do... Actually.
it's admirable,
standing so faithfully beside someone
everyone i know thinks you must be a saint.
a saint?
uh, no, hardly.
simply a man who... 40-some years ago...
found the girl of his dreams.
and... I don't want to let go.
I hope that wasn't out of line, -bringing that up. -no.
I just...on the contrary,
I... I appreciate it.
I have friends.
I see them every day at the club.
and they have yet to mention it.
can i tell you something?
of course you can.
it's nice to meet someone who...
but you still hold on to the first one.
thank you for that.
anytime.
Hey. What's cookin'?
you said you wanted an answer, and i have one.
Oh, neat.
so...
what's it gonna be?
not like i'm impatient after waiting on you for 15 years.
if it wasn't for simon, i might even wait forever.
Nick george's office.
is he in?
he's in a closed-door meeting.
with whom?
I'm not sure.
Daisy, it's me. You can tell me.
I can't do it.
is it karen darling?
Yes. Do you want to leave a message?
is that your final answer?
no.
There'lle no message.
final answer.
I wish i could say i'm surprised.
look, i have to make things work with lisa.
I owe it to her. I owe it to ki.
and what about you?
I want to do the right thing.
of course you do.
and i love lisa.
I love you, too.
I always have, and you know that.
but i just-- she's my wife,
and look, i can't apologize for doing the right thing.
I want to see what's on that disc.
everybody.
everybody.
we are gathered together tonight
to celebrate our perseverance
to letitia's freedom.
I'll drink to that.
and to my princess karen...
with a fifth and, it is hoped, not final...
Tripp. -wedding forthcoming.
Thanks, daddy.
and to patrick,
and has found himself in the united states senate.
you're one step closer to pennsylvania avenue,
and you're gonna get there if you play your cards right.
my cards are my business, dad,
but thanks for the vote of confidence.
to family. -to family. -to family.
to family.
Nicky. -yeah.
Where's lisa? I thought you two were making a go of it.
we are. She's moving back in on monday.
but she and ki are...
well, they're having a girls' night.
I can't tell you how pleased i am to hear that.
I wish my husband had your same willingness to forgive and forget.
unfortunately, he's just a little too enchanted
little con artist to realize what he could lose,
financially... And otherwise.
Hello, boris, natasha.
say hello to gabby and portia.
back-up singers for the new song j. T. And i just wrote.
it's called "moving on.
you should get the ringtone.
Hey, uncle jeremy. -hey, muchacho.
what do you think you're doing?
there's no alcohol for you.
excuse me? -sorry. Not my rules.
but the medical trial has very strict requirements.
you think because i had sex with you,
that means i changed my mind?
you may find this hard to believe, brian,
but thx wasn't thatmind-altering.
well, then you tell our son that you have the big "c
and that you're doing nothing about it.
and then afterwards, you two can go coffin shopping.
and here she is, ms. Chief of staff.
I wish patrick had given me more notice.
I wasn't expecting that you'd attend a family dinner.
professional hazard.
despite what you think, ms. Lyons,
I harbor no ill will towards you,
and i hope you perform your tasks for patrick with the same...
single-mindedness with which you prosecuted me.
that's very gracious of you.
and i...
I just hope that there are no hard feelings
about your... Doomed relationship with my son...
yeah that was my mistake.
Oh, no, dear.
that was nomistake, not at all.
agriculture? It'll seyou back years.
I c-- i can't believe you're even considering it.
I'm doing more than considering, dad.
I've made up my mind.
it's that woman.
that woman's influence is destroying you.
it has nothing to do with her.
have you asked yourself
exactly what it is she wants from you?
maybe she's the only one
ever consider that?
now i like what you just said in there
why don't you take your own advice
and support me for a change?
hey there.
look at you. -hey.
how's the boarder?
far from bored.
Karen lent me this dress. I think it goes for 10 grand.
nice.
it must be strange for you.
how so?
just being around this all the time.
Yeah, yeah. Definitely strange.
you're married, right?
I am, yeah.
so where's your wife?
she's right here.
Lisa, what are you doing here?
Simon showed me the disc.
look, lisa, i can't do this right now.
you can and you will.
Lisa. Just, i was. -you lied to me.
you said you were working when you went to see karen?
you went out there to see
if she was still pathetically waiting for you.
was she? Are you two finally on?
calm down. -because if that's what you want
she's waiting for you. She is wide-open.
Hi, lisa. I smell trouble. Or is that your perfume?
walk away.
sweetie, if i do that, he's just gonna look at my ass.
you can't resist.
you will not be happy until you see our relationship die, will you?
well, he certainly won't.
you stupid, slutty bitch.
Lisa, what the hell?!
Oh, no, no, no. You and i have never been in the same class,
but i'm not afraid to fight above my weight.
Oh, honey, i'll kick your ass if i can find it.
bring it.
now it's family night.
I've always wanted to do this.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Lisa. -oh, hell, no!
whatever you think happened, it was not her fault!
I know what i saw, nick!
why don't you back off and listen to her for once?!
Hey, why don't you back off, fauntleroy?
this is none of your business. -you know what? I think it is!
Lisa's been pretty cool with all your little head games,
but even an art chick has got limits.
who the hell are you to talk to me that way?
I'm your worst nightmare. -shut the hell up, both of you!
just let the bitch be.
when we first moved back to new york,
and your father, he offered to help us out, you said no.
no. We were gonna make it on our own.
is this what you had in mind?
because i think...
this is... Where you were meant to be,
who you were meant to be all along,
and now i am just a reminder of
I'm done.
it's over.
I know.
talk about your setups.
so your mother was behind our entire relationship?
no, i'm telling you,
she found out we were seeing each other,
and she told me to keep it going.
Yeah, and you just went along with it?
you were trying to send her to the electric chair.
she used you.
that's part of being a darling,
which you seem to have pretty down yourself.
what? What are you talking about?
you're using patrick.
for what?
to get close to me because you still love me.
okay, you know, whatever you need to tell yourself.
tell me you don't think about me...
when you take your dress off at the end of a long, boring day
or when you're in the shower with no one to soap your back
or in the early morning when you're all sleepy and you roll over.
ready to go?
Yes. I am ready.
night.
you picked out your soft p. J.s, huh?
Yeah.
so you have fun tonight?
uncle jeremy's funny.
Yeah.
you know i love you... So very much?
you're my sweet angel.
sweet dreams, baby.
I thought you were gonna tell him
I changed my mind, brian. I'm gonna do the trial.
since when? -since tonight.
after that dinner, i realized there is no way
I actually have to live.
Hey.
Hey.
you all right?
believe it or not,
this is pretty much par for the course,
except it's usually a darling that throws the first punch,
not my wife.
well, you probably don't feel this way right now,
but you're lucky.
to have not one but two women to fight for you?
I don't know.
I've been in new york for almost three years now,
and i don't have anyone like that.
not that i haven't dated,
it's just... The guys in this city...
I mean, even the ones whoseemnice, like you...
lost your faith in men, huh? -yeah, almost.
not quite.
I'm sorry i had to bother you,
but thanks for the ride, jeremy.
after your craptacular cage match with my sister,
it's the least i can do.
you really gonna sleep here tonight?
beats explaining to my mother that my marriage is over.
thanks for sticking up for me.
you think i was just gonna stand there
and let karen wail on you?
Nick did.
I... Fought for so long to hold on to my marriage
because i thought i had to.
I... I had no idea who i'd be without nick.
maybe it's just time to let go, you know?
I'm just, um...
not sure i'm ready to let go...
all alone.
this isn't about forever, jeremy.
it's just about tonight.
at 6 years old, you were in love with karen darling?
completely.
I grew up just assuming we'd be together.
till what went wrong?
life, i guess.
Karen broke off our engagement,
and i went back to college, where i met lisa.
and i have spent the rest of my life caught between them
Lisa, karen, karen and lisa-- and now...
you think you've lost both of them.
Yeah.
well, i doubt that.
you're not the kind of guy women get over easily.
even just knowing you two days, i can see that.
I think i'm gonna go to bed.
it's, uh, probably my last night on 1, 000-count sheets, so...
Yeah, you gotta take advantage. -yeah.
did it ever occur to you that neither karen nor lisa
were the right person for you?
the crazy truth is, no.
I have never thought that.
well, that's too bad.
cause there might be other options.
I feel like i can breathe for the first time in years.
must be nice.
you have no idea what it's like to be under someone's thumb.
look, i'm, uh, i'm grateful to you for wanting to be my chief of staff,
even though...
I know why you're doing this.
you want to be close to jeremy.
it's okay.
neither of us can be with the person we really want.
that's one thing we have in common.
this is me.
good night. -good night. And thank you.
for what?
for being you.
that's a surprise.
little paddy stuck up for himself.
Yep.
and he's taking the open seat on the agricultural committee.
nicely done.
I can't go through with this.
it's just that i'm getting... Too involved
Oh, don't tell me you're having regrets about your little boyfriend.
look, patrick is already completely dependent on me,
Letia is evil, and your girlfriend karen is,
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I-I had something i had to show you.
what?
come here. Nola, come here.
don't.
come here! -don't!
now!
Hi, simon.
they tell me...
that when he wakes up in the morning,
there's still only one person he asks for.
isn't that something?
Simon, they're fishes.
tell my sister i made them for her
and give her my kisses. Bye!
just tell me. Where's my brother?
he's fine. He's well taken care of.
when is this done? When is this gonna be done?
Hey.
who's my little soldier?
don't touch me.
you're leaving without saying good-bye.
Hey, tripp.
quite a night, huh?
Oh, yeah, always.
how's karen? -oh, well...
she's licked her wounds, and she's resting comfortably.
my ferocious little girl.
and-- and wrenn, how's wrenn?
well, i don't think she's gonna tell anybody about the accident.
as soon as she's feeli better, we'll send her on her way.
probably tomorrow.
she's a lovely girl, isn't she?
she is.
you know, my whole life...
I thought of letitia
as the only woman that i could ever be happy with.
perhaps i was mistaken.
good night, tripp.
good night, nick.
thank you.
so what can i do for you now?
are you here to see karen... Again?
I'm here for you.
you recording this in case you want to watch it later?
I know that's your thing.
what's up, nick? It's late.
when i first started working for tripp,
he told me you were the enemy.
and i thought, no, he's not such a bad guy.
he just does things dierently, you know, old money, new money.
but after seeing what you're willing to do
to get what you want, i've learned something.
no one has to pay me to destroy you.
I'm more than happy to do it for free.
Wow. Did you rehearse that?
I mean, 'cause i like it.
I like this new nick 'cause he's waking up.
he's starting to think for himself.
soon you'll start to realize,
we're not that different, you and me.
Oh, yes, we are.
and i just want you to know, nick, if this is about karen,
don't worry. You can have her back when i'm done.
you son of a bitch!
I've got no problem with you.
you didn't.
but you do now.
I really like your shower.
well, to be honest with you, baby, it's better with you in it.
all these nozzles-- they're very useful.
I am never getting out of here.
Karen's phone.
uh, yeah. Is Karen there?
she's busy, Nick.
can I take a message?
no, that's alright. Thanks.
no, thank you.
who s that?
Oh, it was a... wrong number.
are you ready to help me with that little thing I need help with?
Oh, yeah. I'm coming right up.
look, I know this isn't easy, so anytime you want to talk about it, we can talk about it, okay?
do you still love mom?
Yes, but- But what?
you said we could talk about it.
right, but there are some questions which- I mean, it seems like there's a direct answer to
or a relatively direct answer - Too many words, dad.
what do you want from me?
Kiki! - Mom!
listen, everything's in the bag-- the pajamas, toothbrush
there's also a permission slip for a field trip you have to sign.
Thanks.
um, I will see you in 48 hours.
well, unless you want to talk before that.
about?
I don't know. Us?
Kiki, can I have a minute? Thank you.
all right, listen, we've tried the separation.
it's been two weeks. It's enough.
it's certainly been enough for Kiki.
I'm not going to get together with you just to be judged.
Lisa, I want to make this work, okay?
so let's have your mom watch Kiki tonight, and we'll have dinner, just to talk.
say yes, mom.
are you sure you're all right, Mrs. Darling?
you seem a little... giddy.
of course I am, Clark.
I'm a free woman, giddy to drink in the colors of the fall before they fade.
Mrs. Darling, I could... I could drive if you want.
I'm fine.
I barely touched my mimosa at breakfast. Have a good day.
so, Simon, what exactly brings you here?
I heard you had opened a gallery, so I just wanted to stop in and take a look, and then I saw this.
though he's a little too obvious with his derivations without being really clear about his intentions,
I just--I keep coming back to it.
best kind of art is the kind you can't make up your mind about.
ambivalence. - Exactly.
we both know a lot about that, hmm?
I'm sorry?
I mean, we're both with people who can'make up their minds.
I thought you said you came here for the art.
I did. I did. I'll take the painting.
and while I'm here, Lisa, I'll also give you this.
it's a conversation between my Karen and your Nick captured by my security cameras.
it's worth watching, even if...
just to clear up a few ambiguities.
yeah? Well, let me clear up some of yours.
I'm not sure what kind of thing gets you off, but I'm not the kind of woman who spies on my husband.
will that be cash or charge?
well, let me spell it out for you.
everyone you recommended, dad, to be my chief of staff- every one of them
in one way or another, belongs to you, and I need someone who will be working for me, Nola.
she prosecuted your mother.
exactly.
what better way to demonstrate that I don't hold a grudge and that I'm someone who's willing to reach across the aisle and
Oh, Paddy.
Mr. Darling, perhaps your hearing isn't what it used to be.
I beg your pardon.
your son has already given me the job.
now let's get down to business.
what do you suggest, Nola?
committee assignments. We hear you folks have thoughts.
I fish in Hampshire in England every year with the chairman of Foreign Affairs.
he can get you a seat.
that's great, dad, except we were thinking
you're not listening, Patrick.
foreign Affairs.
it positions you perfectly for a first-term run at the white house.
we've got a different idea.
Oh, but of course you do.
well, let's-- let's hear them out, Tripp.
with all the recent controversy-- you know, the death, the fire, the transsexuality of it all-- we think avoiding the spotlight would be best.
show we're serious.
we're thinking agriculture.
agriculture?
you heard it right, dad. Agriculture.
Patrick wants to not exploit his family connections too avidly right out of the gate.
all right. Okay.
you've obviously come here with your minds made up.
I profoundly regret that pretending to respect me has taken up so much of your precious time.
it was really nothing.
I couldn't agree more.
your father doesn't like strong women, does he?
he likes mom.
I said strong, not murderous.
what are you doing here? What the hell?
what is she doing here?
she's my chief of staff.
we've got a meeting in the mayor's office in ten minutes, senator.
sorry, Jerms. Gotta run.
Oh, my.
it wasn't my fault.
you were inticated and you were driving the coupe.
poor girl.
well, the doctor said she's gonna be fine, Tripp.
he meant the coupe.
you should thank your lucky stars, Tish.
the young woman agreed to be treated here saves us the possibility of this turning into tabloid fodder.
she rode up on that bicycle out of nowhere, only blocks from our house.
I mean, this is obviously some sort of a scam.
well, it happened to my friend Lucy Tennbrook only last year.
Oh, she lost millions.
I say we go back to that intersection and talk to witnesses.
absolutely not.
we are two weeks removed from your having been on trial for murder.
the last thing we need is another scandal.
he's right, I'm afraid.
she'll be better taken care of here than in any hospital.
lovely.
speak with the young woman, Nick.
Ah, you're awake. Mind if I come in?
um, who are you?
Nick George, family lawyer.
Oh, of course.
um, Wrenn Darcy.
nice to officially meet you.
don't worry. I'm not planning on suing anyone.
well, whether you decide to sue or not is entirely up to you.
I'm just here to make sure you have everything you need.
well, then you're good at your job.
I have an on-call nurse and a maid and this person who just keeps fluffing my pillow.
welcome to life with the Darlings.
is there anyone I should call, let 'em know you're okay?
um, no.
my family is all up in Maine.
besides, they don't really worry about me.
believe it or not, working the fragrance counter at Bendel's makes me the success of the family.
I should probably go.
no, wait. The doctor wants us to watch you for a while and make sure you don't have a concussion.
trust me, I'm-- I'm completely sound so please thank the Darlings for their hospitality.
tell them if they ever need a house sitter... just...
you a little dizzy?
a little.
all right. Well, just, uh, just rest, okay?
what?
uh, you're just not my idea of a family lawyer.
get some rest.
okay, counselor.
it's worse than I thought.
at this stage, unfortunately, the only treatment with any real odds of success would be coutinus rounds of high-dose chemotherapy.
and so what are those odds?
Optimisticly, about 10% chance of surviving 12 months.
in bed...
sick, in never-ending pain?
so what, are you just gonna give up?
I want to spend the time that I have left teaching our son how to live, Brian, not how to die.
I can't say that I would recommend your choice, but I certainly understand it.
so what about the good stuff?
the good stuff?
the N. I.H. Trial I read about at this hospital, Quackenbush.
the waiting list to get into the next run of that trial is over a year long.
I'm sorry.
Hey, grim reaper, I know how this works, so how much is it gonna take to get her into that trial?
I'm gonna pretend we're not having this conversation.
good. I'm gonna pretend I'm talking to a human being.
there's a woman in there with an 8-year-old son.
the sad truth, Mr. Darling, is that there are thousands of women with equally life-threatening cases who actually want the treatment.
you want to play rough? Let's play rough.
you know that building you're about to break ground on, the $100-million children's cancer wing, the one bearing your stupid name?
what if I prevent my family from signing the check they promised?
it's Andrea's decision, Mr. Darling.
my family's putting up half the jing for that wing.
you make it happen.
I'll take care of Andrea.
she's gonna be okay.
and she's not looking to make any trouble.
thank god.
but I think for her sake and for the sake of avoiding a scandal, you're going to have a houseguest for a while.
Nicky, do you honestly think it's safe living her here?
as long as you don't take her for a drive.
whatever the girl needs, she shall have.
she's the injured party.
that's how it should be.
shades of Lucy Tennbrook.
you're kidding me, right?
you say you want me out of your life, and then you get a job working for my brother?
I fell on hard times.
or should I say I was pushed?
or maybe it's neither one.
maybe you are just obsessed with all things Darling.
I mean, if you're not prosecuting a Darling, you're sleeping with one.
if you're not sleeping with a Darling...
what exactly are you doing for my brother?
Patrick, unlike some people to whom he's related, has guts.
he was generous enough to give me a second chance when my career fell into the crapper thanks to you.
Oh, so this is your way of getting back at me, right, by cozying up to Patrick?
get over yourself, Jeremy.
I have.
you should, too, pronto.
you look pretty.
thank you.
Kiki and I spent an hour and a half picking out this outfit.
can you imagine? Being nervous for a date with my husband.
not to say this is a date, because I...
how are you doing?
honestly?
it's weird after all these years to wake up alone every day.
I guess I'd feel pretty weird, too, if I was actually sleeping.
you know, you could move back in?
I want to make this work, Lise.
I do, too, completely, but I...
But?
Simon Elde stopped by the gallery today.
what the hell did he want?
he bought a painting, a very expensive one, and he mentioned something about Karen, about a conversationou had
I did speak with Karen recently.
I told her not to marry Simon. - Okay.
the only reason that Simon wants to marry her is to get control of Darling enterprises stock.
I had to tell her not to do it. I was doing my job.
I want us to work, but we--we can't if Karen is always going to be lingering on the edge of our lives.
we can't. - She's not.
promise me.
Karen Darling will no longer be a part of your life-- or ours--anymore.
I promise you, Karen Darling and I are done.
Nick George is here to see you.
okay, send him in.
that's all for now, gentlemen. Thank you.
well... hello, Nick.
you don't seem too happy. What's the problem?
the problem is that you need to stay away from my wife.
okay, I can't speak for you, but usually, when I'm this angry, it's from a lack of perspective.
so...
so let me help you out.
save the company.
I don't care about the company.
at least, it's not my first concern.
well, then what is?
you...
and me.
now it not on Youtube ye but what do you think?
it's good for a few hits, hmm?
his company are insane.
you can't just show up here whenever you want and screw with my head, Nick!
I know!
I'm sorry, okay? You're right.
Karen, I don't want to see you make a huge mistake.
then step up.
see?
you mess with my lady, you mess with my stuff, I mess with yours.
just consider it a life lesson.
I mean, you can't learn everything you know from Tripp Darling.
I'll show you out, but I have a feeling, by now, you know the way.
so...
what do you think?
I think I'm a lucky man, able to look at someone I love and know she feels exactly the same way for me.
that's the most precious thing in the world.
let me take you out tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't. I have a family dinner.
with the same family that disowned you?
well, yeah, mommy made me promise I'd come so she'd have somebody to gossip with while daddy and Patrick argue over what senate committee he's gonna be on.
so that's what goes at these Darling family dinners?
Yeah.
page six would be very disappointed.
but I will see you after, though, okay?
you bet. - Okay.
all right.
Oh, come on. Up you go.
caught you lookin'. - Yes, you did.
what?
there's a dinner tonight at the Imperial.
do what you have to, just make sure you're there.
relax. I told you, Patrick's ready to go with agriculture.
Tripp gave in.
okay, don't be fooled.
one thing Tripp Darling doesn't do is give in.
I can't launch my biofuel next quarter without some high-profile political support.
I need Patrick on that committee.
I'm not interested in spending any more time with these people than I have to.
then let me be the first to remind you...
you have to.
Hey, swami, big news. You're in.
in what?
the trial.
the experimental cancer drug-- I pulled some strings.
I told you I didn't want treatment, experimental or otherwise.
do you know what it took me to get you into this?
let me guess, Brian. Money?
you amaze me.
because I have values?
because you're so selfish!
you know, whatever you think you're proving by doing yoga and burning incense when you should be taking medicine
I am proving that there is more to life than avoiding death.
listen to me, you willful bitch.
you're gonna take the meds and thank me.
you are such an idiot.
why do you get to me so?
I'm not bothering you, am I?
not in the least.
in fact, it's a pleasure to hear. Please... keep playing.
okay.
don't be fooled. This...
this is the only song I can play.
I'm what my piano teacher called... unmotivated.
I'm glad you're up and about.
it's a good sign.
and truth be told, it's been refreshing to have you in the house, though I regret the circumstances that brought you to us.
my wife...
she keeps life interesting.
Yeah. I read the papers.
well, you must love her very much.
I do... actually.
it's admirable, standing so faithfully beside someone who's been less than faithful to you.
everyone I know thinks you must be a saint.
a saint?
uh, no, hardly.
simply a man who...
40-some years ago...
found the girl of his dreams.
and... I don't want to let go.
I hope that wasn't out of line, bringing that up. - No.
I just-- - on the contrary, I...
I appreciate it.
I have friends.
I see them every day at the club.
and they have yet to mention it.
well, can I tell you something?
of course you can.
it's nice to meet someone who can afford to take a million second chances, but you still hold on to the first one.
thank you for that.
anytime.
what's cookin'?
you said you wanted an answer, and I have one.
Oh, neat.
so... what's it gonna be?
not like I'm impatient after waiting on you for 15 years.
if it wasn't for Simon, I might even wait forever.
Nick George's office.
is he in?
he's in a closed-door meeting.
with whom?
I'm not sure.
Daisy, it's me. You can tell me.
I can't do it.
is it Karen Darling?
Yes. Do you want to leave a message?
is that your final answer?
no. There'll be no message.
final answer.
I wish I could say I'm surprised.
look, I have to make things work with Lisa.
I owe it to her. I owe it to Kiki.
and what about you?
I want to do the right thing.
of course you do.
and I love Lisa.
I love you, too. I always have, and you know that.
but I just--she's my wife, and look, I can't apologize for doing the right thing.
Hi, Simon? Lisa George.
I want to see what's on that disc.
everybody.
everybody.
we are gathered together tonight to celebrate our perseverance and to remind ourselves that we must never take for granted our hard-earned second chances.
to Letitia's freedom.
I'll drink to that.
and to my princess Karen...
with a fifth and, it is hoped, not final...
wedding forthcoming.
Thanks, daddy.
and to Patrick, who has weathered this exceedingly difficult year and has found himself in the United States Senate.
you're one step closer to Pennsylvania Avenue, and you're gonna get there if you play your cards right.
my cards are my business, dad, but thanks for the vote of confidence.
to family.
to family. - To family.
to family.
Nicky. - yeah.
Where's Lisa? I thought you two were making a go of it.
we are. She's moving back in on Monday.
but she and Kiki are...
well, they're having a girls' night.
I can't tell you how pleased I am to hear that.
I wish my husband had your same willingness to forgive and forget.
unfortunately, he's just a little too enchanted by our little con artist to realize what he could lo, financially and otherwise.
Oh, hello, Boris, Natasha.
say hello to Gabby and Portia.
back-up singers for the new song J. T. and I just wrote.
it's called "moving on."
you should get the ringtone.
Hey, uncle Jeremy. - Hey.
what do you think you're doing?
there's no alcohol for you.
excuse me?
sorry. Not my rules.
but the medical trial has very strict requirements.
you think because I had sex with you, that means I changed my mind?
you may find this hard to believe, Brian, but the sex wasn't that mind-altering.
well, then you tell our son that you have the big "c" and that you're doing nothing about it.
and then afterwards, you two can go coffin shopping.
and here she is, Ms. Chief of staff.
I wish Patrick had given me more notice.
I wasn't expecting that you'd attend a family dinner.
professional hazard.
despite what you think, Ms. Lyons, I harbor no ill will towards you, and I hope you perform your tasks for Patrick with the same...
single-mindedness with which you prosecuted me.
that's very gracious of you.
Oh, and I...
I just hope that there are no hard feelings about your doomed relationship with my son...
Yeah. That was my mistake. Oh, no, dear.
that was no mistake, not at all.
agriculture? It'll send you back years.
I can't believe you're even considering it.
I'm doing more than considering, dad.
I've made up my mind.
it's that woman.
that woman's influence is destroying you.
it has nothing to do with her.
have you asked yourself exactly what it is she wants from you?
maybe she's the only one that doesn't want something from me, dad.
ever consider that?
now I like what you just said it here about second chances.
why don't you take your own advice and support me for a change?
hey there. Look at you.
how's the boarder?
far from bored.
Karen lent me this dress. I think it goes for 10 grand.
nice.
it must be strange for you.
how so?
just being around this all the time.
Yeah, Yeah. Definitely strange.
you're married, right?
I am, yeah.
so where's your wife?
she's right here.
Lisa, what are you doing here?
Simon showed me the disc.
look, Lisa, I can't do this right now.
you can and you will.
Lisa. Just--I was--I was-- - you lied to me.
keep it down. - You said you were working when you went to see Karen?
you went out there to see if she was still pathetically waiting for you. Was she?
are you two finally on? Because if that's what you want-- - Calm down.
that slut, that rich, disgusting string bean made of money, then have her.
she's waiting for you. She is wide-open.
Hi, Lisa. I smell trouble. Or is that your perfume?
Karen. Walk away.
sweetie, if I do that, he's just gonna look at my ass.
you can't resist.
you will not be happy until you see our relationship die, will you?
well, he certainly won't.
you stupid, slutty bitch.
Lisa, what the hell?
Oh, no, no, no. You and I have never been in the same class, but I'm not afraid to fight above my weight.
Oh, honey, I'll kick your ass if I can find it.
Oh, bring it.
now it's family night.
I've always wanted to do this.
Oh, hell, no!
whatever you think happened, it was not her fault!
I know what I saw, Nick!
why don't you back off and listen to her for once?
Hey, why don't you back off?
this is none of your business.
you know what? I think it is!
Lisa's been pretty cool with all your little games, but even an art chick has got limits.
who the hell are you to talk to me that way?
I'm your worst nightmare.
shut the hell up, both of you!
just let the bitch be.
when we first moved back to New York, and your father, he offered to help us out, you said no.
now. We were gonna make it on our own.
is this what you had in mind?
because I think... this is...
where you were meant to be, who you were meant to be l along, and now I am just a reminder of that time you spent pretending to be something else.
I'm done. It's over.
I know.
talk about your setups.
so your mother was behind our entire relationship?
no, I'm telling you, she found out we were seeing each other, and she told me to keep it going.
Yeah, and you just went along with it?
you were trying to send her to the electric chair.
she used you.
that's part of being a Darling, which you seem to have pretty down yourself.
what? What are you talking about?
you're using Patrick.
for what?
to get close to me because you still love me.
okay, you know, whatever you need to tell yourself.
tell me you don't think about me...
when you take your dress off at the end of a long, boring day or when you're in the shower with no one to soap your back or in the early morning when you're all sleepy and you roll over.
ready to go? - Yes.
I am ready.
night.
you picked out your soft P. J.S, huh?
Yeah.
so you have fun tonight?
uncle Jeremy's funny.
Yeah.
you know I love you... so very much?
you're my sweet angel.
sweet dreams, baby.
I thought you we gonna tell him instead of just talking about my brother's comedic chops.
I changed my mind, Brian.
I'm gonna do the trial.
since when?
since tonight.
after that dinner, I realized there is no way I can leave my son alone with you and your family.
I actually have to live.
you all right?
believe it or not, this is pretty much part for the course, except it's usually a Darling that throws the first punch, not my wife.
well, you probablly don't feel this way right now, but you're lucky.
to have not one but two women who care enough to fight for you?
well, that's one way of lookin' at it.
I don't know. I've been in New York for almost three years now, and I don't have anyone like that.
not that I haven't dated, it's just...
the guys in this city...
I mean, even the ones who seem nice, like you...
lost your faith in men, huh?
Yeah, almost.
not quite.
I'm sorry I had to bother you, but thanks for the ride, Jeremy.
after your craptacular cage match with my sister, it's the least I can do.
you really gonna sleep here tonight?
beats explaining to my mother that my marriage is over.
thanks for sticking up for me.
you think I was just gonna stand there and let Karen wail on you?
Nick did.
I...fought for so long to hold on to my marriage because
I thought I had to. I...
I had no idea who I'd be without Nick.
maybe it's just time to let go, you know?
I'm just, um... not sure I'm ready to let go...
all alone.
this isn't about forever, Jeremy.
it's just about tonight.
at 6 years old, you were in love with Karen Darling?
completely.
I grew up just assuming we'd be together.
till what went wrong?
life, I guess.
Karen broke off our engagement, and I went back to college, where I met Lisa.
and I have spent the rest of my life caught between them
Lisa, Karen, Karen and Lisa-- and now...
you think you've lost both of them.
Yeah.
well, I doubt that.
you're not the kind of guy women get over easily.
even just knowing you two days, I can see that.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.
it's, uh, probably my last night on 1, 000-count sheets, so...
Yeah, you gotta take advantage. - Yeah.
did it ever occur to you that neither Karen nor Lisa were the right person for you?
the crazy truth is, no.
I have never thought that.
well, that's too bad.
cause there might be other options.
I feel like I can breathe for the first time in years.
must be nice.
Oh, yeah.
you have no idea what it's like to be under someone's thumb.
look, I'm, uh, I'm grateful to you for wanting to be my chief of staff, even though...
I know why you're doing this.
you want to be close to Jeremy.
it's okay.
neither of us can be with the person we really want.
that's one thing have in common.
uh, this is me.
good night. Good night. - And thank you.
for what?
for being you.
that's a surprise.
little Paddy stuck up for himself.
Yep.
and he's taking the open seat on the agricultural committee.
nicely done.
I can't go through with this.
it's just that I'm getting too involved
Oh, don't tell me you're having regrets about your little boyfriend.
look, Patrick is already completely dependent on me, Letitia is evil, and your girlfriend Karen is, you know, part psychopath, and if they find out
Oh, you know, I...I'm sorry. I forgot.
I had something I had to show you.
what? - Come here. Nola, come here.
don't. - Come here!
don't! - Now!
Hi, Simon.
they tell me that when he wakes up in the morning, there's still only one person he asks for.
isn't that something?
Simon, they're fishes.
tell my sister I made them for her and give her my kisses. Bye!
just tell me. Where's my brother?
he's fine.
he's well taken care of.
when is this done? When is this gonna be done?
listen, don't you ever forget all the things I've done for you, Nola Lyons.
who's my little soldier? - Don't touch me.
you're leaving without saying good-bye.
Hey, Tripp.
quite a night, huh?
Oh, yeah, always.
how's Karen?
Oh, well... she's licked her wounds, and she's resting comfortably.
my ferocious little girl.
and Wrenn, how's Wrenn?
well, I don't think she's gonna tell anybody about the accident.
as soon as she's feeling better, we'll send her on her way. Probably tomorrow.
she's a lovely girl, isn't she?
she is.
you know, my whole life...
I thought of Letitia as the only woman that I could ever be happy with.
perhaps I was mistaken.
good night, Tripp.
good night, Nick. Thank you.
so what can I do for you now?
are you here to see Karen... again?
I'm here for you.
you recording this in case you want to watch it later?
I know that's your thing.
what's up, Nick? It's late.
when I first started working for Tripp, he told me you were the enemy.
and I thought, no, he's not such a bad guy.
he just does things differently, you know, old money, new money.
but after seeing what you're willing to do to get what you want,
I've learned something.
no one has to pay me to destroy you.
I'm more than happy to do it for free.
did you rehearse that?
I mean, 'cause I like it.
I like this new Nick 'cause he's waking up.
he's starting to think for himself.
soon you'll start to realize, we're not that different, you and me.
Oh, yes, we are.
and I just want you to know, Nick, if this is about Karen, don't worry.
you can have her back when I'm done.
you son of a bitch!
Nick... I've got no problem with you.
you didn't.
but you do now.
Henri insisted I show it to you first before it's in any stores.
naughty.
pass.
go.
from Salon de Gorgeous...
thrilling.
pass.
are you gonna say no to everything I like? - Ding, ding, ding.
no one wants to buy lingerie their mother approves of.
I'm sorry, Adrian. I'm just--I'm not feeling it.
what's the matter with you? - Nothing.
I guess...
I guess when I -- when I buy underwear, I just need to have someone in mind.
and well, mom, let's face it, after four failed marriages -- four!
and oh, oh, and a failed wedding where I was traded for stock.
nonsense. You're--you're momentarily unhappy.
and why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I can't tell you the number of times I've been disappointed by men.
but do you know what never lets me down, not ever?
Oh, oh, oh, well, if it has batteries, mom, I'd really rather not.
I'm talking about you, dear.
you and my other wonderful children-- you are the great joys of my life.
someday you'll know what I mean.
children! Children, line up. Come on, everybody.
let's go. Shake a leg.
Mr. George. - Here it is.
I made it.
uh, Mr. George?
Yeah, I forgot Kiki's permission slip when I dropped her off yesterday, for the field trip.
your wife called and said Kiki wouldn't coming to school today.
what? - Hi, Mr. George.
Hey, Molly.
Where's Kiki? - Uh, I'm trying to figure that out right now.
uh, when--when did my wife call and say this? - This morning.
she said they were gone for the weekend.
is there a problem?
the problem? The problem is that you didn't tell me you were taking her.
it was a last-minute thing, nick.
this client called out of the blue.
it's a beautiful house right on the beach. I'm going to select some art pieces.
look, I don't care if you're painting them yourself with finger paints, Lisa, you can't kidnap our daughter.
I am not having this conversation. You are obviously insane.
I will have her back to you on Monday.
on Monday? This is my weekend, Lisa. We made an agreement.
it feels pretty homey.
I mean, I've only been here a day, but I'm already getting the sense that, um, this is where I belong.
that's so wonderful, son.
so what can I do for you, dad?
a few years ago, we put the kibosh on Simon Elder's biofuel project.
and now he's your partner, so his profits are your profits.
precisely. The key to the whole business was the chairman of the committee.
a fellow named Charles Watley.
now if he could be persuaded...to reverse his position, that would be very beneficial to everybody.
I'll talk to him, dad, but that's it. I'm not gonna push.
no, no, no, no. Just feel him out, see where he stands, you know?
Yes, but I'm not going to be unethical. I'll see what I can do.
Thanks. Bye.
you okay? Yeah.
look, I need to borrow a jet.
Lisa took kiki out of state for the weekend without my permission, without even notifying me.
so I had the gps company track the location of the car, and they're somewhere near the maryland shore.
you want to go there and retrieve kiki.
take the plane. Go.
all right. Thanks.
Oh, yeah.
that's what it takes.
the memories are flooding back.
how long do you think you can keep this up? - All morning.
I mean the amnesia act.
as long as it takes to convince Simon that I remember absolutely nothing about how he's got your little brother tucked away somewhere.
then I'll move in, gain Simon's trust, get close enough to figure out where he stashed the kid.
baby...
you're not really spy material, not to mention that Simon is a paranoid sociopath...
and that's on a good day.
you're never gonna get close to him.
unless he thinks it's his idea.
so let's make him think it's his idea.
here's a crazy idea...
Hello, Mr. George.
since it's just you and me on this trip, Clark, how about you switch the sateite radio to something a little less operatic?
Oh, it's not just you and me, Mr. George.
what are you talking about?
I'm stowing away. What do you want to do, listen to N.P.R?
it's not gonna happen.
yeah? Well, I'm taking the jet to D. C., Brian.
Oh, yeah? So am I.
Yeah, for what?
it's classified. I could tell you, but...
that might lead to an actual conversation.
God forbid. - Hey, Clark.
let's blow this popsicle stand.
uh, as soon as the last passenger boards the aircraft, Mr. Darling, the stand will be blown.
what last passenger? - Hello, sailors.
going my way? Sorry.
that depends -- Where you going? - And the answer is no.
uh, little place outside of D. C.
it's, um, a boutique of sorts, very exclusive.
yeah? What are you shopping for, jewelry?
Nope.
so...
what are you going for?
sperm.
sperm? - Yeah, you heard me.
buckle up, boys. Karen Darling...is gonna have a baby.
I mean, baby poo and holding...
things? But once I got a physical and started doing research on sperm and their banks, what can I say?
you got sucked in? - I did.
what a lovely thought, Karen. - Don'T.
do not--do not try and talk me out of this.
you stopped me from marrying Simon.
don't stop me from having Coco.
Coco? - That's gonna be its name.
I'm gonna pick out a donor and I'm gonna schedule a squirt or whatever it is they call it.
support me, people. Come on.
well, I want to, Karen. I do. I just think that...
you have a kid?
Oh, yeah, like you have anything to teach anyone about parenting?
don't start with me, Brian.
the minute you and Lisa broke up, you should've gone to the authorities and accused her of child abuse and loose living.
it's true. - Well, that wouldn't have been true.
you know, so what? At least you wouldn't be on this mission, going to kidnap your own kid back.
when it comes to kids, Nick, you gotta play dirty.
well, thanks for the advice, padre.
Hey, what are you going to D. C. for anyway?
well...
you know, if you two need to know...
I'm giving a benediction for a state dinner that Patrick's hosting.
sorry about that, folks.
we're heading into a little bit of chop.
it should even out in no time.
wait, Tripp isn't going to Paddy's dinner? That seems kind of odd for him.
well, I guess Paddy wants everyone to stay the hell out of it and maybe mind their own business maybe.
that can't be good, can it?
Hey, Brian, my guess is that god feels the same way about you that everyone else does.
but just in case he's, like, a big-picture kinda guy, maybe you could just toss out a prayer.
no, I am not gonna pray to god for protection from a world that he made dangerous.
just tough it out.
okay, I'm gonna put a word in, all right? So just bow your friggin' heads.
anxious? No, not at all.
because there's no reason to be.
everything's going as planned.
it's not overconfidence. It's just-- hey, hey, hey.
do not threaten me. When have I ever given you reason to doubt my loyalty? When have I ever？
okay. All right. I'm sorry.
I promise, I'll get it done.
listen, Nola just arrived. I gotta go.
sorry I'm late.
what's this?
the minutes to Patrick Darling's first session with the senate agricultural committee.
how'd he do? - He held his own. You'll see. It's all in there.
wait.
what is that? - What?
you have a hickey.
I do.
and welcome to eighth grade.
who gave it to you? Who are you seeing?
Jeremy? Jeremy Darling has amnesia.
I thought he didn't remember you.
he didn't. He doesn't.
it just so happens you two have fallen into bed together...again?
I guess we just have chemistry.
Yeah.
let's hope that's true.
because if I were to ever find out that his amnesia was anything less than genuine.
he doesn't remember anything. Trust me.
so...
what can I do for you, senator?
well, I came to speak to you about Simon Elder's biodiesel project.
which is now a joint venture with darling enterprises, if I'm not mistaken.
that's correct, yes.
and your father would like me to reverse my negative position now that there's money to be made in it for him.
That's...I'm not sure that's how he would put it.
well, of course not, but then again, your father never says exactly what he means, does he?
look, I'll tell you what -- why don't you tell your father, please, for me, senator, that the position that he...pressured me into taking all those many years ago is one I've actually come to agree with?
I will not reverse my position.
congressman, I've looked at the data, and you should...
this meeting is over, senator.
Oh, and, uh, why don't you tell your father for me, next time you see him.
I hope he rots in hell.
okay, we've got a problem.
I'm gonna pull back on the ol' joystick, see if we can get up above it.
Brian? Oh, my god!
What?! What?!
he's really praying!
what's that? Nick, what's that sound?
Clark? - Can't chat, Mr. George.
sorry. Little busy here.
but, uh, you should go ahead and buckle those seat belts.
Sweetie...Nick, Nick -- hey, Karen!
I know I said this before, but if there was ever a time to say it again, it's now.
what, Karen?
I don't know if you've ever really believed me, but I love you, Nick.
I really do.
you gotta be kidding me.
I don't know what in life or just everything that has kept us and made it impossible for us to be together, but I do know in my heart...
you're the one. You always have been.
Oh, god. Oh, god!
this is it. Sorry about that.
got a little hairy there, but, uh, we're fine.
why don't you just, uh, sit back, relax, enjoy the flight, and, uh, just--just go back to doing whatever you were doing?
here you go.
okay.
so...
what?
you were saying?
where the hell are we?
we are just outside of Wilkes-Barre.
Pennsylvania? Yeah.
Hey, get back in that cockpit and fly us outta here.
no can do, sir. The F.A.A. has grounded all flights into dulles due to heavy winds.
wind? You're afraid of a little wind?!
just man up you big...sissy!
Hey, it's not his fault, Brian.
Hey, what are you in such a rush for anyway?
because I made a commitment.
people are counting on me.
I care.
Yeah, I have an appointment, too, but you don't see me throwing a hissy fit.
well, I'd be calm, too, if I had a river of vodka running through me.
you know what? Let's just drive.
I don't see why you get to drive.
because you drive like grandma Darling.
Yeah, and you drive like Bo Duke.
Hey, come on, Brian. You're going 90. Slow down.
Hey, I've got places to go.
so do we. - Yeah, and we'd like to get there alive.
what? - I gotta pee.
don't worry. I'm not gonna bring it up...the thing you said on the plane...
good. - About me being the one.
I'm glad you're not gonna bring it up.
I don't need to.
I've heard enough declarations of love in my life to know the real ones from the knockoffs, and you meant it.
look, Karen, I-I thought the plane was going down.
I know, and you spoke the truth from your innermost heart.
it was very romantic.
but the question is, what are you gonna do with all those feelings?
Oh, tell him I said hi.
Hey, Patrick. What's up?
what do you know about congressman Charles Watley? He voted against Simon's biofuel a few years back.
that was before my time, Pat.
he really, really hates dad.
well, that doesn't sound unlikely. Your dad's made his fair share of enemies.
in this particular case, I have no idea why.
listen, we're running a little late, but we got the last rental car and we have your minister.
what are you talking about?
Brian. We've got Brian for your dinner.
what dinner?
I thought there was supposed to be some big state dinner tonight that he's praying at.
that's news to me.
well, I guess I misunderstood. I'm sorry.
no problem. - All right. I'll see you later, Pat.
Oh, no. No way.
you got five seconds to get in the back of the car. One...two...three, our, five.
Hey, Jeremy.
Hey.
you, uh, you wanted to see me?
Yeah, yeah. Have a seat.
I just wanted to talk over a little rumor I've heard about.
a rumor?
well, uh, when it comes to gossip, I'm a bitch. Let's dish.
who's it about?
you.
you know, your father and I are partrs now, so I hear things.
he mentioned in passing that you and Nola Lyons are...having a romantic relationship.
I-is she your girlfriend, dude? 'Cause if I had known, I would not...
no, no, no, no, no, no.
she's not my girlfriend, Jeremy, and she never would be.
that's what I need to talk to you about.
I need to give you a warning.
a-about Nola? - Yeah.
hit me.
Jeremy, she's a dangerous woman.
how so?
well, see, now you--you don't remember any of this, but...
she's done a lot of harm to your family, Jeremy, and I think she intends to do more.
well, I'm--I'm listening.
she got sexually involved with you the first time in order to gain inside information about your mother during her trial.
and now she's insinuated herself into Patrick's life in order to gain political leverage against your father.
she's out to destroy you and your entire family.
I just thought you should know.
well, here we are-- man-seed central.
this doesn't look like the most exclusive sperm bank in the world.
trust me. I did my homework. It's the crème de la crème...
so to speak.
wish me luck. - Good luck.
Yeah, good luck, and make it snappy.
in and out...
so to speak.
well, maybe next week we'll try again.
what the hell is going on?
Patrick called during your little potty break, and there's no state dinner tonight.
so why are you in such a rush to get to D.C.?
my ex called.
mei ling hwa.
about what, child support? - No.
she wants to sleep with me.
it's a little last tango in georgetown.
we broke up, she vamoosed to Hong Kong, and--and she just wants a little...closure.
and you're gonna do it?
why the hell wouldn't I?
you just got married to Andrea.
Andrea's got nothing to do with this.
unbelievable.
Oh, come on, Nick. You know what it's like to be married.
the soul-crushing monotony, the routine.
you've been married for four weeks.
what's up?
I just poked my head inside the bank, and it's a little, uh...
spermy? - Clinical.
it's called ambiance.
I need you guys to come...with me...inside--in the clinic.
Oh, come on. - Inside the...
come on, you, too, pokey.
come on.
I want someone super special.
I can't bring just anyone's chromosomes into this family.
of course, Ms. Darling, but as you must know, we cater to only the most discerning clientele.
Yeah, yeah, and I don't want any of these nobel prize people either, because the--the peace yeah, the peace, peace, blah, blah, blah stuff, I don't want.
and no one too smart.
I don't want to breast-feed a nerd.
you, um, want someone well-rounded.
exactly. Well-rounded and cute.
cute?
what's taking so friggin' long?
Hey, back off, Brian. She's not buying a pair of shoes here.
do you have any particular physical attributes in mind, Ms. Darling?
Yes.
I want someone who looks good in the French designers, but who can pull off the Italians, someone versatile.
think you're gonna need to be a little more specific.
height, weight, eye color...
Oh, god.
6'2"-ish, between 170 and 175, dirty blond leaning towards sandy auburn and ixnay on the ack-bay air-hay, because I keep a clean house.
what?
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help noticing, you fit her description perfectly.
he does, doesn't he?
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I just threw up in my mouth a little.
if you'll excuse me, I'll just go and pull some more profiles.
excellent idea - what? - I think you need to face the facts.
what facts are those? - That you should be my baby daddy.
me? - Yeah.
no. - You.
I told you, Karen, I am just not ready to be a father again, not yet.
but the baby would be mine, Nick.
you wouldn't even have to do anything...except sleep with me.
you could make that one little sacrifice, couldn't you?
like so many others before you have done.
shut up, Brian.
look, what I would really like right now is to concentrate on getting my own kid back.
Hey, why don't you just say it? - What?
you think I'd make a lousy mother.
because I don't believe that? - Yes, you do.
I can see it in your eyes, Nick.
you know what you're doing? You're comparing me to your precious little Lisa.
no, no, no. - You are.
well, I got news for you, pal.
your precious little Lisa stole your daughter away from you and didn't tell you, which is something that I would never do to you.
look, I...
I just want to have one pure simple relationship in my life about me being my best for someone else.
and if that means it's with someone who wears a diaper and doesn't talk English, then so be it.
damn it.
what's wrong now?
Karen's sincerity killed the car.
sorry.
I am tired.
my toe hurts.
it's dead in the water, dad.
I went to see Watley, and quite frankly, he still hates your guts.
what do you mean, still?
you tell me. He gives me the impression you squeezed him pretty hard.
squeezed? I never squeezed anybody, ever--anyone.
I don't want to go back to Watley and push him on this.
this is your problem. You caused it. You fix it.
Patrick, I very rarely ask you to do anything.
this is for the family, for the company.
you go back to Mr. Watley...
and you get it done.
right, dad.
you've never squeezed anybody.
I don't know what I was thinking.
our worries are over, princess.
that doesn't seem quite likely.
it is. I've got Simon totally snowed.
he is so convinced I have amnesia, he told me about you.
what about me? - Your checkered past.
Hey, it's nothing I don't already know.
Jeremy, it's a test.
for what?
don't you see? He's fed you information, and now he's gonna sit back and see what you're gonna do with it.
so what am I supposed to do with it?
well, how bad were the things he said?
pretty bad.
then you're gonna have to do something pretty bad.
to who?
me.
Lisa, it's me. - What, Nick?
I'm at a motel just outside of D.C.
and I will be there in the morning to pick up Kiki.
I told you...
I told you I would get her back to you on Monday. Why did you come down here?
because that wasn't our agreement. It's my weekend.
so you have to spoil hers? She is having a great time, Nick.
we went horseback riding today. We have plans for tomorrow.
Oh, I thought you were working.
I am, and then we have plans. Why are you making this about you?
I'm not. Wh-- - aren't you?
aren't you feeling guilty because you have been an absentee father all these years, and you are trying to make up for it with this grand gesture? Hard as it is for you to hear, Nick, she is fine without you.
she is having a great time, so please don't ruin her weekend trying to prove to yourself that you are a good father.
what happened now?
has your wife retreated into the caves near the border of Pakistan?
Yeah.
what happened?
L-lisa...accused me of coming down here because I feel guilty for not being a better father from before the break-up.
you know, she said Kiki's fine without me.
whatever.
no, not "whatever.
what did you say to her?
nothing. What am I supposed to say?
you're a lying, cheating bitch.
you care more about having your own art gallery than you do about the integrity of our relationship.
I mean, there are things you could say.
she's not all wrong, though, Brian.
ever since I started working for the family...I've been distracted, absent.
you know, just like Dutch wasn't really there for me when I was a kid.
I'm not there for Kiki, and...you know, maybe she's right.
maybe I am doing this all for myself.
Kiki is fine without me. Better off, even.
you know what? Get out.
are you serious? Why? -I'm totally serious.
because for one, I'm your half brother and I'm not doing you any favors listening to this self-pitying crap.
relationships are a two-way street, Nick, and you are a much better father than most.
and two...
I'm sex texting with Mei Linghwa and...
I think we're ready to take it to the next level.
so just take a hike.
you can sleep on the floor.
Oh, but not anywhere near the bed because, you know, god forbid you think an impure thought and accidentally impregnate me with your super sperm.
I just had my ass handed to me by Lisa and Brian.
for what, being superior? Come on.
move over.
being a bad father and just...
generally sucking at everything.
you know, I don't want to talk about it. Cut me a break, would you?
okay, but just this once.
what are you watching?
you're not a bad father. You must know that, right?
I don't know what I know anymore.
God, Nick, if the proof is in the pudding and Kiki's the pudding, you're a great dad. Lisa didn't do that all by herself.
if you're trying to talk me into getting you pregnant tonight...
I'm not.
I'm not.
but we could try for a practice run.
Karen. - What? We could.
if you and I are gonna be together...in a good, constructive way...
I'm pretty sure it doesn't start tonight in a motel...in a room that smells like curry.
well, then why don't you just sleep with me?
did you not listen to a word I said?! - I said--Nick, I said "sleep with me, like hold me, like actually sleep with me."
Yeah.
I'd like that.
this is nice. It's like junior high.
Yeah, if we'd grown up in Bombay.
thanks for meeting me halfway.
no problem.
nice place.
not exactly my idea of a love nest.
well, you know, man plans, god laughs.
it's a long story.
you look good.
so do you.
you gonna keep the collar on?
you want me to? - No.
I don't know.
I've never done this before.
well, neither have I.
I mean, technically. I've only cheated on you...not with you.
you're such a bastard.
why isn't Brian coming along?
I don't know.
I am not my half brother's keeper.
hello.
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Thank you. All right. Bye.
who was that?
um, my doctor in New York. The physical.
just calling to confirm that all of my lady parts are good to go.
senator.
another potcheen, please, and one for my esteemed colleague from across the aisle.
to what do I owe the pleasure, senator?
your father running low on whipping boys?
the opposite.
I've come to apologize for my complete ignorance earlier.
I think I understand now why you were so frustrated with me.
you do? Really?
of course.
I've been subjected to a lifetime of bullying from my father.
it stands to reason I haven't been the only one.
listen, I know my father will never give you the apology you deserve, but, uh, I hope you will accept mine.
whatever he did to pressure you...
I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
great.
terrific.
well, I hope this means we can...move forward.
Oh, I hope so, too.
excuse me? - What?
what the hell was that?
I thought you understood what your father had on me.
You...have a wife and children.
and you have a thing for transsexuals.
Yeah, with...female parts.
I'm, uh...I'm not gay.
I'm sorry...for the confusion, senator.
and I'm sorry...
but you won't be getting my vote.
that went well.
don't wander off.
dad!
how are you? Are you having fun?
now that you're here, though, it's even better.
well, thank you.
your mom's here.
why are you doing this?
well, like I said, this is my weekend withKiki, so I thought I'd come and pick her up.
you drove all the way here for me? - Of course I did.
you can't just show up here unannounced, Nick.
we--we talked about this.
no, we didn't talk about anything. That's why I had to drive down here.
ten minutes to dinnertime, baby doll.
baby doll? - Edward, this is Nick.
I've heard a lot about you.
Hi.
Hey, hey, Kiki, would you mind staying here for a second with Edward?
I just want to talk to your mom.
be right back.
what the hell is going on here? - He's my client.
well, unless you're a prostitute, he's obviously much more than just a client.
funny.
edward invited me here to update his art collection.
we're getting along. - Oh, well, obviously. Baby doll?
you and I have been separated for two months, Nick.
I am allowed to date.
Lisa, you didn't inform me you were taking our daughter, and you took her across state lines.
Oh, don't talk to me like we're in court.
I'm not on the stand, Nick, and you are not the judge.
what, you want to tell me that you've been so pure?
I never said I was pure.
talk about getting in bed with your clients.
Hey, whatever I am, I'm still Kiki's father.
and for our daughter's sake...
I'm not gonna cause a scene. I'm gonna get outta here.
but you know and I know that after this little stunt you'll never get full custody now.
50-50 is the best you can hope for, which is what I've been offering all along.
now you make sure that Kiki's back by Monday.
Hey, Kiki.
man, I had no idea you were having such a good time, and I gotta get back to the city.
so is it okay if we see each other when you get back into tn?
all right, hug.
Bye.
dad.
I love you.
I love you, too.
you ready for dinner? Come on.
what did you say to Jeremy?
about what? - Me.
triton, go start the car.
tell me what happened.
he came screaming at me saying that you told him everything about how I was plotting against the family, trying to tear them apart.
I told him he didn't understand, and then he hit me.
I assure you, I didn't tell him to do that.
not at all. - Simon. Simon
look, I am under a lot of pressure right now.
pressure you know nothing about.
if you want to make it easy for yourself, stay away from Jeremy Darling.
that was meant for you.
looks like smooth sailing tonight, folks.
so, uh, we should be home in no time.
you've been quiet.
mei ling lightened your mood?
She...changed it.
was it everything you expected it to be?
you want to hear all the dirty details?
she came to the motel.
I invited her in.
she took off her coat.
we sat on the bed for 20 minutes, 17 of which...
I talked about Andrea.
and that was it.
so you didn't go through with it?
no, I didn't.
I couldn't.
those last three minutes...
I tried.
the monster wouldn't come to life.
well, maybe it's for the best, Brian.
you're actually one step closer to committing to something, to someone you really love.
yeah? What about you?
wh-wh-what do you mean, me and...me and karen?
Yeah.
the two of you having a kid would be weird, sure, but it wouldn't be the worst thing that ever happened.
Oh, it's so good to be home.
that was exhausting.
thanks for the lift. I owe you 4 bucks for the tolls.
see ya.
Hey, Karen. - Here.
I know what it's like to want to have a child. I do.
and I don't know if I ever told you this, but Lisa and I had to try for six months before we got pregnant with Kiki.
and I remember what it was like...
laying in bed thinking about this little person I wanted so badly to meet.
she just wouldn't show up, and it drove me crazy.
you know how I feel. That's a--that's a real consolation, Nick. Thanks.
Hey, no. Karen, Karen, I guess what I'm -- what I'm trying to tell you is...
I love you.
I do.
and I am open to being your baby daddy.
what -- you're -- you're open -- you're open to -- you're open to it?
I can't do it yet, and I'm--and I'm sorry.
but I-I can't. I can't do it yet.
Ok-okay.
but if we were to take things slow, like...with us...
like--like going out?
Yeah, going out.
maybe it wouldn't be such a long way away.
we might get there sooner than either one of us thinks.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
Karen, I-- -That was just -- that was...
that was really...
that was really sweet, what you just said.
get some sleep.
dear? I thought that was you.
what's wrong? - I'm pregnant.
already? My, those sperm banks are very efficient.
no, no, no, no. No, no, mom, mom, it isn't...
it doesn't have anything to do with sperm banks.
It's--the doctor that gave me the physical, he called this morning. I'm pregnant.
with Simon's baby? -With Simon's baby.
Oh, no. - I know.
Oh, my god. Oh, baby.
Jeremy, I'm sorry I had to call you over so late, thanks for coming.
thanks for having me...
I think.
I'm sure you heard about the Maybach...and triton.
well, I've -- I've got a vague memory.
vague? You got a lot more than a vague memory.
let's cut to the chase, Jeremy.
I know you don't have amnesia.
if--if I remember correctly, I do.
do not waste my time. See, I got this gut stinct that says you're not the kind of guy who's gonna punch a woman in the face.
that sounds a lot more like Nola's idea.
it's okay. Jeremy, it's okay.
because, see, you failed at fooling me about the status of your memory, but you succeeded in communicating to me how much you care for her and her little brother.
brother? Uh, I didn't know she had a brother.
Yeah, yeah, you did. Now this is what we're gonna do.
see, I'm gonna let you be the big hero.
I'll arrange things so you can rescue Nola's brother.
but I'll need something from you.
what?
I'm gonna need you to kill someone.
who?
me.
legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain.
there was once a king so cruel, and so evil, that even the gods feared him.
since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.
there his demonic spirit was captured in the form of a great black cauldron.
for uncounted centuries.
the Black Cauldron lay hidden, waiting while evil men searched for it.
knowing whoever possessed it, would have the power to resurrect an army of deathless warriors.
and with them.
rule the world.
the Black Cauldron
there's something wrong!
I can feel it in my bones.
hmm, the Fairfolk know it too.
the Horned King!
that black hearted devil!
what's he waiting for?
Yes, yes, Cat,
I KNOW you want your breakfast!
but just now THINKING is more important!
Oh, Taran!
the pot is boiling over, Taran!
Oh, Dallben,
I was just thinking.
what if the war's over, and I never had a chance to fight!
hmm, and a good thing too.
war isn't a game, people get hurt!
but I'm not afraid!...
Ouch!
Ah, ha! There you are!
if the Horned King ever returned you'll have a great deal more to worry about than a burned finger.
no, no, no, no. Cat that is not for you it's for Hen Wen.
hen Wen, Hen Wen, it's ALWAYS Hen Wen!
and one day, my boy, you may learn why.
now, no more dreaming, you have chores to do.
Yes, sir.
he's so anxious, and so blind to the dangers ahead.
look, look Cat you're in luck! Just enough left for you!
hmmm?
Dallben wouldn't understand.
I'm not a little boy anymore.
I should be doing heroic deeds for Prydain!
not waiting hand and foot on a spoiled...
Hey!
Oh, alright Hen, I didn't mean it.
you'd better eat it, Dallben made it especially for you.
is this to be my life?
pampering a pig!
I'm a warrior, not an Pig-Keeper.
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid, but I wouldn't.
all I need is, is, is a chance!
and I could be a famous warrior!
look at me Hen! I can do it!
ha!
ha, ha, ha, ha. Even you're afraid!
you challenge me? Run you cowards!
there you are! His majesty the Horned King!
so, we meet at last!
ha!
even the Horned King shakes with fear! See Hen?
everybody runs from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben!
Prydain's finest warrior, draws his last...breath!
Hmmm. Not quite the blade for a hero!
I was... It's just we were...
uh, Hen Wen got dirty!
so I see. Another dream, Taran?
but, Dalben!
won't I ever be anything but an Assistant Pig-Keeper?
she's a SPECIAL pig, Taran!
now give her a nice bath!
well Hen, it looks like I'll still be an Assistant Pig-Keeper, even when I'm as old as Dallben.
you like that, don't you.
now for the part you like best.
Hey, c'mon Hen,
I haven't finished scrubbing your bac-...
hen what's the matter?
calm down, Hen! Stop it!
please what's the matter?!?! Hen Wen!!
Taran! Whats going on?!
I-I don't know!
there's something wrong with Hen Wen!
WHAT?!?! Oh, quickly lad, bring her inside!
what's that for?
put Hen Wen down.
I never use her powers unless I have to. But now I must!
powers?
Taran, what you are about to see, you must never reveal to ANYONE!
hen Wen, from you I do beseech...
knowledge that lies beyond my reach...
troubled thoughts weigh on your heart...
pray you now those thoughts impart...
the Horned King...
SSHH. Don't interfere!
he's searching...
the Black Cauldron.!
so that's it!
the Black Cauldron?
an awsome weapon, Taran!
it's been hidden for centuries,
but if the Horned King should find it, and unlease It's power.
nothing could stand against him.
it's Hen Wen!
he knows...
stop! Enough!
you must leave here at once!
take Hen Wen to the hidden cottage at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
hide there, never bring her out, until I come for you!
hide? But why?
only I knew the secret of Hen Wen's power!
but now the Horned King has discovered it!
you must make sure he never uses it to find the Black Cauldron!
Humph! I'm not afraid of the Horned King!
then you are a very foolish lad!
untried courage is no match for his evil.
just remember that!
now, now off you go my boy and take care of yourself!
goodbye Dallben! I won't fail you!
so much. So soon. To rest upon his young sholders!
Oh, yes! Yes, my soldiers.
soon the Black Cauldron will be mine.
it's evil power will cost through my vains, and I, shall make you. CAULDRON-BORN!
Yes! YES! Oh, yes! Then you will worship ME! Me.
Oh, my soldiers, how long I have thirsted to be the God, among mortal men!
gosh Hen Wen!
I never knew you could create visions and things like that!
I thought you were just an ordinary pig.
I had no idea you so. SPECIAL.
Dallben's going to be glad he put his trust in me!
just you wait and see!
now, don't go wandering about!
and don't you worry!
keep close to me and no one will do you any harm.
not while I'm around.
and I won't let the Horned King get close to you Hen.
I'll protect you!
Taran of Caer Dallben, the greatest warrior in all Prydain! A true hero!
thank you, thank you, thank you all!
but without the help of my pig, Hen Wen here, I...
hen Wen? Where are you?
hen Wen? Oh no!
is that you Hen?
look what I've got.
C'mon out here's a lovely juicy...

Uhah, Nope. Gurgi has not seen piggy! Nope!
Oh, never mind!

Oh, master, master! Now Gurgi remembers! Yes! Yes!
clever sharp-eyed Gurgi saw the piggy run, right through the forest!
Uhuh! Uhuh! I saw it! Uhuh! I saw it!

Oh! Never mind!

Oh! No, no! It's a terrible place!

I won't fail you, Dallben.
look at me Hen, I can do it!
I can do it! I can do it.
um, I thought I heard a noise here.
Oh, was that you?
Yes, yes! I...
you're being held a prisoner, aren't you?
Yes!
I've been held against my will, too.
it lights up!
why of course, it's magic!
Oh, I hate this place!
I do hope there aren't any rats in here.
Oh, not that I really mind them you know, but they do jump out at one so!
I'm Princess Eilonwy.
are you a lord...or a warrior?
er, no, I'm, uh, an assistant pig-keeper.
Oh, what a PITY.
I was so hoping for someone who could help me escape!
Oh well, if you want to come with me you may.
can I?
why yes! I just said you could.
Oh, that wicked, wicked king!
you know, he stole me.
he thought my bauble could tell him where some old cauldron was.
that's what he wanted my pig for.
Oh, yes! Your PIG!
but my pig can tell the future!
oooooo! How interesting!
well, you better stay close to me or you'll get lost.
your bauble!
Oh, it's always chasing those rats!
a burial chamber!
this could be the tomb of the great king who built this castle!
before the Horned King took it over .
Ahh!
are you all right?
well, c'mon then! Help me have a look around.
he must have been a great warrior!
a sword!
this will please him!
piece of good luck this time!
Hurry! In with it!
finally he'll reward me for this!
don't stop you weakling!
put your back into it!
let's get out of here before they come back!
where did you get that sword?
uh, back there.
you mean...
well, he's not going to use it!
you're making a horrendous mistake! I'm not a spy!
I'm a bard! I sing! Uh, I entertain!
Oh, careful sir, these are the hands of an artist!
this'll hold you!
now, look, you seem an intelligent sort of chap to me!
I assure you I had no idea who owned this castle!
I just happened to be passing!
Oh, he's nice! What's his name?

you don't realize who I am!
I shall sing of your dastardly deed!
I'm Fflewddur Fflam!

hmm, its not too good, but it'll hold for a while.
Yes, I shall sing of your deed!
it would be better to sing of our heroic escape!
weren't you a bit frightened Fflwewddur?
a Fflam frightened?
ho, ho! The word is not in my vocablurary!
but in this case well chosen, my dear.
I wasn't afraid!
Auh! Not afraid?!
why, we were running for our lives!
well, I got us out of the castle, didn't I?
you?! I'd say it was the sword's magic.
but it takes a great warrior to handle a sword like this!
huh. But, still, it is a magic sword!
Humph! What does a GIRL know about swords anyway?!
girl? GIRL?!?!
if it weren't for this, GIRL, you would still be in the Horned King's dungeon!
here now, now. Princess Eilonwy, Taran...
well at least I don't keep talking about it FOREVER!
Oh, you're so, so BORED!
princess Eilonwy!!
how dare you take his side!!!
well I really didn't mean to-to-to...interfere, heh, heh!
silly girl! Even if she is a princess!
but we are going to have to...
to to... Oh, dear.
hello.
hello. Fflewddur is right, you know.
we are going to have to work together.
and we'll find your pig.
I'm sure it's important.
thank you for getting me out of the dungeon.
Oh, we couldn't have done it without you.
but a least we're all safe.
Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!! Great Belin!!
help! Murder! Hurry!
ha, ha! Gurgi's lucky day!
Wow!
Yes! Keep it! It's a gift!
Oh, this! Gurgi want this!

Gurgi, uh, want!!!
master! Uh, uh, old man...FALL DOWN!

he's no friend of mine.
he's just a coward, and a thief.
Humph! Too big anyway!
you're charming!

Yes. Yes exactly! Toddle off! Toddle off!
Humph! Gurgi go!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Follow Gurgi! Follow Gurgi!
you'd better be telling the truth!
Gurgi not lie.
not this time.
see master? Piggy's footsteps! No lie.
Oh, good. They look fresh.
Oh, master! Master!!!
hold on!
Oh, Taran! Give me your hand!
we're doomed!
uhoh!
how did they get in here?
ha! Old Doli's whirlpool broke again!
I think they wake up soon.
we'd better tell King Eidilleg.
no, silly! You know we're not supposed to be up here!
Uhoh, we are going to be in trouble!
not me!
me either!
uhoh!
Oh , yes, I see you fixed that.
Yyeeuppp! When I get... this pole... up here.
I'll be finished!
good! Yes, that SHOULD work.
it's PERFECT!!!
grab that pole!
Ugh! I've got it!
Ohh, aren't you all darling!
Oh, uh, hello. I'm King Eidilleg of the Fair Folk and this...
I thought I told you to fix the whirlpool!
I fixed it! I did fix it! It was perfect!
evidently not completely perfect!
its supposed to keep them OUT!
uh, can I be of any service?
is everything that happens around here MY fault?!
are you here on a friendly visit?
and I suppose it's my fault that the pig's here, too!
Oh, she's your pig!
Oh, GOOD!
one less thing for old Doli to worry about!
Oh, Doli !!!
what now?!?!
would you hurry up and fetch the pig?
PIG?!?!
Hey, YOU KIDS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!
Oh, oh, Mr. Doli. I just want to see the pretty lady.
alright, but you watch yourself, ya hear?
I cannot believe my eyes, your Majesty!
watch it! Watch it!
Oh, Hen !
thank goodness you're safe!
tell me, is the burning and killing, STILL going on up there?
you refer to, that, that, that joke on humanity, the Horned King!
well no one ever stands UP to him!
we've seen him. And if he finds the cauldron.
he'll kill us all!
Oh, no, no! He'll never find it! No, no!
it's safely hidden, in Morva.
well, at least I think it is.
Oh, Doli ! is it?!
Yeeeep! Is that my new job?!
remembering where the cauldron was last seen!
Oh, he'll know right where it is! You'll see!
if we could get to the cauldron first...
and destroy it!
Oh, it isn't right, Taran.
don't you see?
if we destroy the cauldron, it would stop the Horned King!
please, come with me?
well, I never thought of Morva!
that's a hard place to get to!
Yeeeuuuppp!
why, you can take them!
What?!?!
you mean, trusting our lives to, a, to him?
and what, is wrong, with ME!?!?
Oh! Ah, nothing! Splendid choice in fact! Heh, heh.
shall we then ?
Oooooooohhhhhh!!
Oh, wait!!! Hen Wen.
don't worry! We'll get her home safely!
thank you, sir! Be good Hen!
well, if it's the Marshes of Morva you wanted, here ya are!
Oh, such a dreary place!
let's see what it looks like from up here.
I think we're lost.
are you sure this is the right place, Doli?
Yes, I'm sure!
well, if you ask me...
Aaahhhhh!
are you all right?
Hey! Look out you big clumsy oaf! Look where...
uhoh!
welcome to Morva.
well, someone must live here.
Gurgi not like this place! Uh-uh! Nnooooooo!
it seems empty. Maybe we should have a look.
if I could just...get this... door open!
how will we ever find the Black Cauldron in a place like this?
it must be here somewhere!
they're only frogs, Eilonwy.
those were people!!
you mean they were turned into frogs!
Oh, master! Come quickly!
Gurgi finds the wicked Cauldron!
quick! Quick! Follow Gurgi!
behold master!
the whole room is full of cauldrons!
I don't understand!
why would, why would anyone want so many...
Ah! Thieves! Thieves!
someone stole all our frogs!
you evil, nasty people!
you shall all be turned into frogs and eaten!
nice and tender!
stop that! You. ... .
so nice to meet you ladies. Uh, goodbye!
wait! My, aren't you the handsome one!
who? Who? M-m-m-m-m, ME?!?!
Oh, honestly now! Don't you find me irrestiable?
Yes. Quite so!
Sush! Stop that!
I hope you don't mind if I move your heart.
you handsome...
Humph! Enough of this lovesick nonsense!
great Belin!
we're going to have toad stew!
you're not going to eat this one!
come here love!
can anyone here preform marriages?
Marriages?!?!
you love struck witch!
where is he? Where'd he go? Yoohoo!
where are you? Don't go!
now look what you've done! He's gone!
I'll never forgive you for this, Orgoch! Never!
Oh, there you are!
enough! We've come for the Black Cauldron!
did you hear that, sisters?
why, no one has asked for the Black Cauldron in over two thousand years!
it's a trick! We not going to let them have it, are we?
don't worry. Leave it to me.
perhaps I might interest you in something else.
a kettle, a cookpot, a skillet, a teapot, a bucket, a jar, a platter!
see anything you like?
I don't believe it!
I've never seen a sword like that!
I've got to have that sword!
listen carefully, we'll trade the Cauldron for the sword!
but what can they DO with the Cauldron, Orddu.
nothing! That's the point. Don't you see?
we'll end up with both! The sword and the Cauldron!
it's decided then, you shall have the Black Cauldron.
you mean, you'll give it to us?
ha, ha! That's not what I said. You weren't listening.
we never give anything away!
what we do is bargain, trade!
well you'll not have my sword!
may I ask you ladies to perhaps consider this magnificent harp.
a harp?!?
when we want music we send for the birds. What would we do with a simple harp?
wait! Gurgi will trade his munchings and crunchings.
who would want...?!
hold it sister! Not so fast!
alright! I know what you want!
Yyyeeessss?
no, Taran! No!
it's our only chance!
here is my sword. Take it!
this is your own choice, duckling.
remember, with this sword you could be the greatist of warriors!
Yes. I offer you my dearest possesion, in exchange for the Black Cauldron.
agreed! We have made a bargain.
look out!
Help!!
Taran! Watch out!
Ah! Great Belin!!
duck!
look!
the Black Cauldron! It's ours!
I say, what funny little ducklings!
don't they know the Black Cauldron is indestructible!
now listen carefully, the Black Cauldron can never be destroyed.
only its evil powers can be stopped!
then there is a way! But how?
a living being must climb into it on his own free will!
Gurgi is bold and brave!
he will climb into the evil cauldron!
however, the poor duckling, will never climb out ALIVE!
Yikes!
now look here madam, don't forget we have an agreement!
Yes! You said we could have the Cauldron!
of course we said you could have the Cauldron.
it's not our fault you can't do anything with it!
goodbye goslings!
and remember we always keep our bargain!
what a bunch of blundering misfits!
things never work out when you're dealing with people!
you can go back to feeding pigs!
I've had it! Goodbye!
Doli's right. It's my fault! I let you down!
without my sword I'm nothing!
I'm just an just, an Assistant Pig-Keeper!
look you are somebody!
you must believe in yourself!
I believe in you.
you, you do! And I think that you're...
uh, I mean... That is...
Yes, Taran?
I mean...
what I mean is that I'm grateful to all of you.
you've been true friends. Now it's up to me...
look!
uhoh! Trouble! Goodbye!
quick! We can't let them find it!
pig boy!!!!
ha! There you are! Pig-boy!
get the move on! Careful now!
you! Tie them up over there and get that cart out of here!
Oh, I'm sorry. I've ignored you.
you did come for the Black Cauldron, didn't you?
good, then climb right in! It'll only cost you your life!
Oh!!
everything is ready, sire!
my, such a brave and handsome crew!
a pig-boy, a scullery maid, and broken-down minstrel!
perhaps it may interest you to see what fate has in store for you! Ha, ha, ha, ha.
now I call upon the army of the dead! The Cauldron Born!
arise my messangers of death! Our hour has arrived！
Oh! It's horrible！
my phantom warriors have come to life！
all dead from centuries past!
never has anyone created an army like this!
go forth my deathless warriors! Destroy all in your path!
come, sire! We can get a better view from above!
Oh, Taran! I'm afraid it'll soon be over for us.
I-I hadn't planned it to end like this, Eilonwy.
Oh, I wish I'd stayed a toad!
only moments away from victory! My greatest triumph!
we did it sire! I-I mean YOU!
Yes, yes! Of course! You did it, Sire!
Yikes!
Gurgi? Gurgi, is that you?
master!
Gurgi, what are you doing here?
Gurgi sorry he always runs away when there's trouble.
he untie everybody! Then we leave this evil place!
well get on with it!!
good boy, Gurgi!
Eilonwy, you go with Fflewddur and Gurgi.
I must stop the Cauldron.
Oh, but Taran that's impossible! Why you'd be......
I'm sorry, Eilonwy.
please Taran!!!! NO!!! You can't!!!!
my mind is made up!
wait master! Gurgi not let you jump into Cauldron!
Gurgi, get out of my way!
Whoa!
please master! Not go into evil Cauldron.
if I don't we're all lost! Out of my way!
No! Gurgi not let his friend die!
Taran has many friends
Gurgi has no friends.
Gurgi, No! Don't jump! Wait!
Nnnnoooooooooooo! Oh, no!
sire! Sire look! Something's wrong!
what is it sire? They're- they're DIEING!
it can't be! This had better not be your fault!
perhaps it needs another body, Sire!
Yes! YOURS!!!
get Eilonwy out of here. Hurry!
Taran, I, please, I...
go on! Go with Fflewddur!
maybe there's still a chance, for Gurgi.
no, Sire!!! Please!!
get up!! Come alive!!
maybe they're only resting, Sire!!
do SOMETHING!!!! My life is at stake!!!!
get up you fools!!! KILL!!!!!!!
look!! Sire, look!!
it's the PIG BOY!! It's HIS fault!!
Yes! HE'S the cause of it!!
you've interfered for the last time. . . .
ha, ha!! Go for his throat, Sire!!!
now, Pig Keeper. You shall die!!
No! DON'T!!!
what's this?!
no, you'll not escape!
you will satsify the Cauldron's hunger!
Oh no!
No! You'll not have me! My power cannot die!
curse you! No!
Nnnoooooooo
Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!!!
Oh no! H-how horrible! Poor sire! H-he's gone!
he's gone! Ha! He's gone! Ha, ha, ha, ha! HE'S Gone!
over here! Hurry!
thank goodness you're safe! C'mon Fflewddur! Hurry!
for sakes alive!
C'mon Fflewdduer! Jump!
Taran. Look!
good! Get in. Let's go
here! Your job, Fflewddur!
uhoh! Trouble!
Oh! We can't get through!
I-I'll try to open the gate.
Taran! Be careful , please
Hurry! Move on through!
C'mon Fflewddur! Hurry!
good work lad!
look oooooouuuuuuttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!
look!
why is the poor duckling so sad?
Yes, he got what they wanted and he's still not satisfied!
just what do you think you're up to, ladies?
Oh, we have business with your little hero.
hero? Gurgi was the hero!
the only thing that mattered to you was the Cauldron.
but now it's of no use to you.
so we'll just take it, and be on our way!
wait! Uh, stay your hands, uh, ladies!
we never give anything away!
we bargain. We trade. Remember?
ha, ha ! did these old ears hear the word bargain? Hmmm?
yes madam! Those old ears heard right!
Ohhhhh! I adore a voiceful man!
Oh! Pull yourself together madam! Now C'mon!
out with it! What is your offer?
No! Not the
then I'll do it!
a magnificant sword for a warrior!
I'm not a warroir. I'm a pig-boy.
what can I do with a sword?
absolutely nothing!
but I will trade!
YES????
the Cauldron for Gurgi!
Oh dear!
it's not possible!
just as I thought ladies!
you've got no real power! Admit it! Admit it!
we have made a bargain! Ha, ha, ha, HA!
Oh, Taran!
Muchings and crunchings in here somewhere!
Gurgi! You-You're alive!
he's alive!
great Belin! He IS alive!
Fflewddur! Fflewddur! He's alive!
I'm alive! Ha ha ha! Gurgi's alive!
look! Look! Look! Touch me! Oh! Ho, ho!
Oh, Gurgi! You clever little thing!
C'mon Gurgi! Let's go home!
Oh! Gurgi's Happy day!
great Belin! Ha!
you did well my boy!
Yeeeuuuupppp! Ha, ha, ha!
the End
whoa.
who's that stumblin' around in the dark?
state your business or prepare to get winged!
calm yourselves, gentlemen.
I mean you no harm.
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler. Whoa, boy.
good cold evening, gentlemen.
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
might that be you?
who wants to know? - Well, I do.
I'm Dr. King Schultz. This is my horse, Fritz.
what kinda doctor? - Dentist.
now, are you the Speck Brothers?
and did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?
so what? - So I wish to parley with you.
speak English. - Oh, I'm sorry.
please forgive me. It is a second language.
now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
Hello, you poor devils!
is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident of the Carrucan plantation?
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
who said that?
what's your name?
Django.
then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.
do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?
who are they?
big John.
Ellis.
Roger. Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
they was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.
not anymore.
tell me...
if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again, - would you recognize them? - Hey.
stop talkin' to him like that. - Like What?
like that.
my good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain...
speak English, goddamn it.
everybody calm down.
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.
I don't care. No sale. Now, off with ya.
don't be ridiculous. Of course they're for sale.
move it.
my good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?
last chance, fancy pants.
Oh, very well.
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast, but I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses.
you goddamn son of a bitch!
you shot Roscoe! ─ Well...
and you killed Ace! -No. No. No.
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.
and I do believe I have... one, two, three, four...
five witnesses who can attest to that fact.
damn leg's busted! ─ No doubt.
now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,
I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
God-fuckin'-damn it! - As I was saying...
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
Yeah.
sold American!
so, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck? How much for young Django here?
that iron is nasty business.
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
thank you. Django?
get up on that horse.
also, if I were you,
I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
nigger! Don't you touch my brother's coat.
goddamn it! Oh!
one hundred... ten... 20...
and five...
for young Django here.
and since he won't be needing it anymore,
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.
do you have one?
you go to hell, dentist.
I thought not.
no worries. I come prepared.
thank you.
this will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
whoa.
now, as to you poor devils.
so, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices.
one: Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town.
which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.
or two: You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.
choice is yours.
Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one.
Ta-ta.
now wait a minute, fellas. Let's talk about this!
you gotta be reasonable in a situation like this!
I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doin' my job!
blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?
tell you what, boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso,
I'll get you your freedom.
no. No, please...
all right, now.
I'd like you to take two of these tonight...
and then in the morning...
that's a nigger on a horse.
what's everybody staring at?
they ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.
whoa.
good morning, innkeeper!
two beers for two weary travelers.
it's still a bit early.
we won't be open for another hour.
by then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what the hell you think you're doing, boy?
get that nigger outta here!
help! Help! - Innkeeper!
remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal.
sheriff! Help!
alas.
now we must act as our own bartender.
sit down, my boy.
what kind of dentist are you?
despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.
but these days, I practice a new profession...
bounty hunter.
do you know what a bounty hunter is?
no.
well...
the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
hat.
prost.
the state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man.
after I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities.
sometimes that's easier said than done.
I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed,
I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.
so, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business.
what's a bounty?
it's like a reward.
you kill people? And they give you a reward?
certain people, yeah.
bad people?
Ah! Badder they are, bigger the reward.
which brings me to you.
and I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.
on one hand, I despise slavery.
on the other hand, I need your help.
if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.
so, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.
still, having said that, I feel guilty.
so, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
however, at this endeavor, I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like.
but you do. Don't ya?
I know what they look like all right.
good. So here's my agreement.
you travel with me until we find them. - Where we goin'?
I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
that means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
and when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them.
you do that, I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.
and, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.
all right, folks, calm down.
go about your business.
these jokers will be gone soon.
now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?
and scare all these nice people.
you ain't got nothing better to do than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?
What'd you just do to our sheriff?
now you can get the marshal.
Marshal! Marshal!
should we wait inside? - Can we just leave?
after you.
move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.
I want six men, six rifles behind it.
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof.
two men, two rifles on that roof.
all the barrels aimed at that front door.
somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.
you in the saloon!
we got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'.
you got one chance to get out of this alive.
you and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean right now.
is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?
Yes, it is.
this is U. S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
na wunderbar, marshal.
I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed,
I am ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,
I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies before I've had my day in court.
you mean like you did our sheriff.
shot him down like a dog in the street.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?
well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.
fair enough, marshal. Here we come.
they're a little tense out there.
so don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.
come ahead.
you unarmed?
Yes, indeed we are.
marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?
go on. - Thank you.
my name is Dr. King Schultz.
like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court.
the man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of $200.
now that's $200, dead or alive.
the hell, you say!
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.
but I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?
Yeah.
I know this because three years ago, he was rustling cattle from the B. C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.
now, this is a warrant made out by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
you're encouraged to wire him.
he'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was.
in other words, marshal, you owe me $200.
I'll be damned.
after this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket...
what's your plan after that?
find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
do most slaves believe in marriage?
Oh, me and my wife do.
old Man Carrucan didn't. That's why we, uh... we run off.
Django.
Django, Django.
you got sand, Django.
boy's got sand.
I got no use for a nigger with sand.
I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek.
and the girl, too.
and I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
both of 'em.
separately.
and this one...
you will sell him cheap.
in Greenville...
there should be some sort of a records office.
you know when she was sold...
you know where she came from, and you know her name.
what is her name?
Broomhilda.
what? - Broom-hilda.
broomhilda? - Hm-mm.
were her owners German? - Yeah, how you know?
she wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation.
she was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts.
she speak a little German, too.
your wife? - Hm-mm.
when she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to speak German with.
well, let me get this straight.
your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
Yep.
they call me Hildi.
when we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
you'll be playing a character.
Hm?
during the act, you can never break character.
do you understand?
Yeah. Don't break character.
and your character is that of The Valet.
what that is?
that's a fancy word for servant.
valet? - Hm-mm.
and now, Django, you may choose your character's costume.
youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?
but of course.
whoa.
it's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.
this is my valet. My valet does not walk.
I said niggers on horses... - His name is Django.
he's a free man. He can ride what he pleases.
not on my property. Not around my niggers, he can't.
my good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
allow me to unring this bell.
my name is Dr. King Schultz. This is my valet, Django.
and these are our horses, Tony and Fritz.
Mr. Bennett?
I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman.
and it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to parley with you now.
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.
you and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee to buy one of my nigger gals?
no appointment, no nothin'?
Oh, I'm afraid so.
well, what if I was to say I don't like you?
or your fancy-pants nigger?
and I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
now what you got to say about that?
Mr. Bennett.
if you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be,
I have 5, 000 things I might say that could change your mind.
well, come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.
Hm-mm.
Oh, maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.
Oh, well, absolutely! Uh, Betina.
Yessir, Big Daddy? - Uh...
what's your Jimmie's name again?
Django. - Django.
BETINA, sugar, could you take Django there and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff.
as you please, Big Daddy.
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man.
he cannot be treated like a slave. He... within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.
understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar? - Yes'm?
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man, you understand?
you can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here, 'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here. You got it?
you want I should treat him like white folks?
no. That's not what I said.
then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy.
Yes, I can see that. Uh...
what's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass?
his mama work over at the lumberyard.
Oh, you mean Jerry. - That's the boy's name. Jerry!
you know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
Yes'm, Big Daddy. - Well, that's it, then.
you just treat him like you would Jerry.
that house we just left from is The Big House.
big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
that there is the pantry.
that's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat.
po' little squirrels.
what you do for your massa?
didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave?
so you really free? - Yes, I's free.
you mean you wanna dress like that?
BETINA, I need to ask you somethin'. - What you want?
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three brothers. Overseers.
their name is Brittle. You know 'em?
brittle? - Yes, Brittle.
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
I don't know them.
they could be usin' a different name.
they woulda come to the plantation this past year.
you mean the Shaffers? - Maybe.
three brothers? - Uh-huh.
they here? - Uh-huh.
could you point one of 'em out to me?
well, one's over in that field.
old Man Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this, now.
she work in the house, John.
you could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess her up and she ain't gonna be worth... she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.
now, your Bible say...
look, I told you that I was one that made her do it.
you ready?
she didn't wanna run off with me. If anybody should be gettin' whupped now, it should be me. It should be me, John.
now, I been here long enough, you know me, you know me a long time, now.
you know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this.
she's a... she's a house slave.
she a house slave, she can't be...
on my knees. I'm asking you this, please. Ain't this what you want?
I'm keeping it funny for you. Now, John, please.
l's on my knees, John.
I like the way you beg, boy.
is that who you was lookin' for?
Yep.
where the other two at?
they by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.
they whippin' Little Jody?
point me in that direction.
you go to that tree and keep goin' that-a way.
go get that white man I came here with.
come on, now. - No, no, please!
come on, girlie. - Please!
come on. Get you set up now.
and the Lord said, The fear of ye...
and the dread of ye shall be on every beast of the earth.
come here now, woman!
you'd better give me that arm!
OK, she's ready!
and after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.
John Brittle!
you remember me?
I like the way you die, boy.
goddamn son of a bitch!
keep it funny!
y'all wanna see somethin'?
No!
who were they?
that's Big John, and that's Lil Raj.
Where's Ellis?
he's the one high tailin' it across that field right now.
you sure that's him? - Yeah.
positive? - I don't know.
you don't know if you're positive? - I don't know what "positive" mean.
it means you're sure. - Yes.
Yes, what? - Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
I'm positive he dead.
Django!
everybody calm down.
we mean no one else any harm.
who are you two jokers?
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America.
the man to my left is Django Freeman. He's my deputy.
in my pocket is a warrant, signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
they were goin' by the name Shaffer.
you know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
these are wanted men.
the law wants 'em for murder.
now, I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive, so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal boundaries.
I realize passions are high, but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead.
now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?
gimme.
satisfied?
may I have that back, please?
get off my land. - Posthaste.
load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here.
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
come on, men!
we're coming for you, nigger! - Hee-haw!
now, unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em.
that's way too simple for these jokers.
we're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.
and I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.
damn.
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.
we ready or what?
Aw, hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
Oh... Oh, shit.
I just made it worse.
who made this goddamn shit?
Willard's wife. - Well, make your own goddamn masks!
look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,
I coulda cut it better than this!
what about you, Robert? Can you see?
not too good.
I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less.
but when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
shit. - Yeah.
I just made mine worse.
Oh, God.
anybody bring any extra bags?
no, nobody brought an extra bag!
I'm just askin'.
do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
Oh, well, shitfire!
if you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose!
well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing!
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!
now, I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches, and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize!
from now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
now, look, let's not forget why we're here.
we got a killer nigger over that hill there!
and we gotta make a lesson out of him.
OK, I'm confused. Are the bags on or off?
I think we all think the bag was a nice idea.
Yeah.
but, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better.
so how 'bout no bags this time, but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia.
I like that idea a lot. - You get my vote, Robert.
wait a minute! I didn't say no bags.
but nobody can see.
so?
so it'd be nice to see.
goddamn it! This is a raid! I can't see, you can't see!
so what? All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!
I can't see shit!
there he is! Get that nigger out from under that wagon!
and get that nigger-lover outta the wagon!
that nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!
what? - They tricked us!
well, where are they?
auf Wiedersehen.
Oh!
bull's-eye.
look at 'em run.
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
goddamn it!
goddamn it!
would you care to?
can't see shit outta this!
he's getting away. - I got him.
big Daddy's getting away.
I got him.
got him.
the kid's a natural.
how you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?
Broomhilda is a German name.
if they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?
Broomhilda is the name of a character in the most popular of all the German legends.
there's a story about Broomhilda?
Oh, yes, there is.
do you know it? - Oh, every German knows that story.
would you like me to tell you?
well, Broomhilda was a princess.
she was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods.
anyway, her father is really mad at her.
what she do?
I can't exactly remember.
she disobeys him in some way.
so he puts her on top of the mountain.
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
it's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.
and he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
and he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.
and there, Broomhilda shall remain.
unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.
does a fella arise?
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.
a fella named Siegfried.
does Siegfried save her?
quite spectacularly so.
he scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.
he slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.
and he walks through hellfire...
because Broomhilda's worth it.
I know how he feel.
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
now, look, Django...
I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...
but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.
a slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit.
free or not, it's just too dangerous.
but let me ask you a question.
how do you like the bounty hunting business?
kill white folks and they pay you for it?
what's not to like?
now, I have to admit, we make a good team.
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous, but normally, that's a good thing.
how'd you like to partner up for the winter?
what you mean "partner up"?
you work with me through the winter till the snow melts...
I give you a third of my bounties.
so we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself and we'll find where they sent your wife.
why you care what happen to me?
why you care if I find my wife?
frankly...
I've never given anybody their freedom before.
and now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.
Plus, when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
as a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
you got her.
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"?
his son's with him. - Well, good.
he'll have a loved one with him.
maybe even share a last word.
that's better than most of them get.
damn sight better than he deserves.
put down the rifle.
don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
read it aloud.
consider that today's lesson.
wanted. Dead or alive.
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall - Gang. - Gang.
for murder and stagecoach... robbery.
Seven-zero-zero-zero... - Seven thousand.
thousand.
$7, 000 for Smitty Bacall.
$1, 500 for each of his...
gang...
Mem... - Members.
known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas:
follows. - Follows.
dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and...
crazy Craig Koons.
that is who Smitty Bacall is.
if Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22, they would never have printed that.
but Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
do you want to save your wife by doing what I do?
this is what I do.
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.
this corpse is worth $7, 000.
now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.
pa?
pa!
here.
you need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.
Why? - It's good luck.
you always keep the handbill of your first bounty.
that's accurate.
doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?
who the hell-a you got there?
the Wilson-Lowe Gang.
who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
huh. Well, just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere.
why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow and get yourselves some coffee.
we had a birthday yesterday. Got some cake.
pretty good.
move along!
move it, boy!
keep movin'.
get on up on that auction block.
don't let that mud slow you down. Keep going.
keep goin'!
Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27, 'r' on right cheek.
Calvin Candie.
he owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.
Candyland?
Oh, so you've heard of it.
ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
well, apparently, that's where your wife is...
and that's the repellant gentleman who owns her. Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field.
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
she... she pretty.
and she talk good, too.
but when they tore her back up and then they...
burned that runaway "r" on her cheek...
they goddamned her.
she ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough for the house no more either.
they gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
what's a comfort...? Oh.
not while I got freedom.
not while I got my gun.
so do we offer to buy her?
so...
say...
a man wants to buy a horse.
needs to buy a horse.
he walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
and do you know what the farmer says?
the farmer says no.
well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealin' that horse.
fair enough. But now you're a horse thief, and they hang horse thieves.
not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner because the horse is still his property.
we need her and we need a bill of sale.
well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her?
may I offer an alternative plan of action?
go ahead.
so... the man walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door...
and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm.
and makes an offer so ridiculous, the farmer is forced to say yes.
we gonna offer to buy Candyland? - No, it's far too big.
but apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.
how much do you know about Mandingo fighting?
what?
can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
Why?
because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.
and your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
they call that "One-Eyed Charley."
Bonjour.
we're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.
Entraz.
thank you. - Hm-mm.
you want me to play a black slaver?
ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.
a black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...
and, buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.
then play him that way.
give me your black slaver.
along came the 219 Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!
Dr. Schultz!
good to see you again! - Mr. Moguy.
thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity - for this appointment. - Nonsense, it's my job.
so this is the One-Eyed Charley I've heard so much about.
Yes, this is Django Freeman.
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.
just call me Leo.
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room. You all wanna follow me?
how long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about 11
when we went to boarding school together.
Calvin's father's father put me through law school.
one could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
one could almost say youse a nigger.
what did you say?
I said... - Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
uh, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
what civilized people aren't?
and he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.
he doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.
get back on top, now! Turn around!
there you go.
there you go.
why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?
you don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?
quit stalling, now.
answer the question.
the awful truth? I'm bored.
this seems like a good bit of fun.
well, come on over.
we got us a fight goin' on that's a good bit of fun.
won't you accompany me to the bar?
you don't wear a hat in the house, white man. Even I know that.
Dr. Schultz. - What a rare pleasure.
keep fighting, niggers.
and I might add, an honor. - Honor to meet you.
please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine.
get free man Django here whatever he wants.
and I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
use your weight, boy, use your weight! There you go.
he's much bigger and stronger!
come on, now!
he's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes.
come on, now, boy! It's a fight to the death!
you either hit him or are you ain't?
big Fred, come on!
turn him around! Now...
use your strength, boy! Come on, now! Use your strength!
there you go!
there you go! Look at that.
see, I told you to put some more power in there.
do what I told you, boy!
there you go!
No! - Do what I told ya!
blind him black, boy! Blind him black!
Oh, no, Luigi.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh...
finish him.
go on, boy, finish him!
that's why they call him Big Fred.
worth every penny. - Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
come on up, now, boy. Get yourself a rest.
you did a fine job. A real fine job.
Mercedes.
tequila.
what's your name?
Django.
can you spell it?
D-J-A-N-G-O.
the D is silent.
I know.
Mr. Moguy, want you to take care of my new boy here.
you find him a room with a soft bed, then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole.
but you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
you enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.
Yessir.
what's your name, boy? - His name is Django Freeman.
Where'd you dig him up?
a fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.
I've heard tell about you.
I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'.
I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert?
I'm curious what makes you so curious.
what did you say, boy? - Calm down, Butch.
no offense given...
none taken.
Monsieur Candie...
I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.
one...
you do not have anything to drink. Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
Yes! I'll have a beer. - Wunderbar.
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard, and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.
do not spare the rum.
doc... I am a seasoned slaver.
you are, well, you are a neophyte.
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
with all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
I didn't seek you out for your advice.
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top-dollar market price.
now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business.
well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
we were discussin' my curiosity.
thank you.
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.
Sheba... you stay right there.
I know you didn't mean me.
Prost! - German.
now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you,
I'm doing business with both y'all.
he does the eyeballin', you the billfold? Is that it?
well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
hm.
so...
bright Boy...
Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh and you was none too impressed, huh?
not for top dollar.
well, then, we got nothin' more to talk about.
you see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me, those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so...
he don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.
he wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.
well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.
well, you won't sell your best.
you won't even sell your second best.
but your third best...? You don't want to sell him either.
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...
who knows what could happen?
and what do you consider ridiculous?
for a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?
how much would you say, Django?
twelve thousand dollars.
well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.
Willie. Willie. Hold up! Hold up. Ah!
good morning, gentlemen. - Good Dr. Schultz.
beautiful morning, isn't it? - You couldn't have picked a better one.
please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria.
Oh, thank you very much.
you can tie your horse up back there.
Django.
where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented, above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
say, one nigger that just pops up in 10, 000.
the exceptional nigger.
bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
sun is up.
shining on all of us.
have a seat, doc. - Thank you.
quite an honor.
the honor is all ours. - Thank you.
but I do believe that, given time, exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...
become if not frequent...
more frequent.
bright Boy, you are that one in 10, 000.
the name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.
Whoa!
touch your guns, you die. - Everybody, calm down!
now I saw the whole thing. No harm done.
are you kidding me?
this nigger just... - I said no harm done!
now take your hand off your pistol!
butch, that means you too.
everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
hoot! Get back up on your horse.
he broke my collarbone!
for God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
Yessir, boss. - Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
you better listen to your boss, white boy.
Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you.
you wanna hold my hand?
Willie, take us home.
start moving!
head 'em out!
you got a problem with your eyeball, boy?
no, sir.
you want a boot heel in it?
no, sir.
then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
you flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me.
now move, nigger!
you niggers are gonna understand something about me.
I'm worse than any of these white men here.
you get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
he is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?
indeed.
may we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?
you know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland, so before that moment, it would be good if I could have a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant.
you mind telling me what the hell you doing?
I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.
you're sure it's her? - He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German.
now, while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.
point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution.
you lose sight of why we're here.
you think I lost sight of that? - Yes, I do.
stop antagonizing Candie.
you're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed.
and I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
I'm not antagonizing him. I'm intriguing him.
you're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son and he didn't bat a eye.
you remember that?
Yeah, of course I remember.
what you said was that this is my world, and in my world you gotta get dirty.
so that's what I'm doing. I'm getting dirty.
well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
that was the general gist.
see you at Candyland.
all right, niggers, back at it.
that means you too, Moonlight.
I'll be. D'Artagnan!
now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
Yes, you can.
you might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up?
I cannot hear myself think! - Quiet down, Marsha!
marsha, hush up! Marsha!
hush up! Hey!
get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!
come on now, boy... get on out that tree.
Yes, sir.
how long was he loose?
a night. Day.
half the other night.
how far he get off the property?
about 20 miles off the prop.
pretty far considering that limp he got.
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?
one of this new lot.
well, way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him.
please, Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.
now, now, now, now, now. - I can't...
now, no begging.
no playing on my soft heart.
you in trouble now, son. - Yes, sir.
I done paid $500 for you.
when I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger - before he roll over and play dead. - Sir.
you got to understand that I'm running a business here.
you fought three fights. - But I won every one.
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
but that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing.
Yes, sir.
still, the fact remains:
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
so what about my $500, huh?
what about my $500?
you gonna reimburse me?
you even know what "reimburse" means?
I'll reimburse you!
you will?
Yep.
you'll pay $500
for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?
no, he won't.
he just tired of you toying with him is all.
matter of fact, so am I.
but we ain't paying a penny for that pickaninny.
ain't got no use for him. Ain't that right, doc?
you heard him.
you're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
he ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.
ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
that right.
for that matter, nor have I.
now...
seeing as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here, you won't mind me handling this nigger any way I see fit?
he's your nigger.
Mr. Stonesipher?
let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
get him, get him!
your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
Nah, he just ain't used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
you are used to it?
I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.
now, Monsieur Candie...
whenever you're ready.
we rode five hours so you could show off your stock.
let's get to it.
cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
follow me.
line them up to the left here now, boy.
stand up straight, now!
get up there.
get up there, boy. Come on.
give me a line! Give me a line!
get in line there! Straighten up!
Hello! Stephen, my boy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass.
who this nigger up on that nag?
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast? What's the matter? Why you so ornery?
you miss me, huh? - Oh, yes, sir.
I miss you like a hog miss slop!
like a baby miss mammy's titty.
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.
now, I axed you: Who this nigger on that nag?
Hey, Snowball.
wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.
just who the hell you calling "Snowball," horse boy?
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there and in the mud so fast...
make your head spin. - Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
let's keep it funny. Django here's a free man.
this nigger here? - That nigger there.
let me at least introduce the two of you.
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this here's Django. You two oughta hate each other.
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?
Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers.
and they are our guests, Stephen.
and you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality.
you understand that? - Yes, sir. Him I understand.
but I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.
you don't have to know why. Do you understand?
Yes, sir. I understand.
well, good. They're spending the night.
go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
he gonna stay in The Big House?
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
in The Big House? - Well, you got a problem with that?
Oh, no. I ain't got no problem with it, if you ain't got no problem with burning the bed, the sheets, the pillowcases, everything else when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
that is my problem! They are mine to burn!
now your problem right now is making a good impression!
and I want you to start solving that problem right now and get them goddamn rooms ready!
Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.
go on, now.
can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House.
your daddy rolling over in his goddamned grave.
man, the lip on him. Whoo! He's getting worse and worse.
now...
where is my beautiful sister? !
there she is!
Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister.
darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.
may I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly. Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
come on, Charly. Come on, now! - Let's go.
you know where it is.
like you on a rope!
niggers don't walk around here, niggers run!
Monsieur Candie?
Yeah. About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?
nigger girl?
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German.
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?
do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?
you little dickens, you. I don't see why not.
Stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up and smelling real nice, and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here.
actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there's something I ain't told you about yet.
what? - Uh, Hildi in the hot box.
what's she doing there?
what you think she doing there in the hot box?
she's being punished.
what she do? - She run off again.
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone?
two. - When did she go?
last night. They brung her back this morning.
how bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
lucky for her, they was out chasing D'Artagnan's ass.
bill and Cody went looking for her, found her, brung her back.
now, she a little beat-up. But she done that to her own damn self running through them damn bushes and shit.
how long she been in the box?
how long you think she been in there? All damn day.
and the little bitch got ten more days to be in there.
still, take her out. - Take her out? Why?
because I said so, that's why. Dr. Schultz is my guest.
Hildi is my nigger.
southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.
but, Monsieur Candie, she run off. - Jesus Christ, Stephen.
what is the point of having a nigger that speaks German if you can't wheel them out when you have a German guest?
now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out.
Yes, sir.
Lara Lee! Will you and Cora be responsible for getting Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
of course, darling.
now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words.
it is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
y'all done heard the man! Get her ass up outta there!
Cora! Come here!
get over there and get her cleaned up, bring her back over here to Dr...
what he say your name is? Shoots? - Schultz.
Schultz. Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl.
Yes, sir.
come on, girl. Stand up.
is you coming with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?
Hello, ladies.
Dr. Schultz. May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
I've heard a lot of good things about you.
well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know.
as I look at you now, Broomhilda,
I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified.
the doctor here speaks German.
and I've been informed you do as well?
go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.
astonishing.
and I shall bring you... - Much obliged.
ja.
don't be afraid.
hm. Pardon.
Danke.
Hey, little trouble maker.
you silver-tongued devil, you.
hurry up, girl. - These ready, Miss Cora.
no, no, no, they drinking tonight.
go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
get your big pretty ass out the way. - You know you like it.
that's because you knows what I like.
Ooh! Come on with these biscuits, girl.
look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
but the best three by far were Samson...
what's that other one's name? - Goldie.
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
by the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
you never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
his name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold. Who knows?
well, regardless, Samson's your best. We all know that.
you will never sell him, and I can see why. He's a champion.
Hm-hm. All three are champions.
Samson's the champion.
them other two pretty good.
Calvin, now what's this nigger you let...
it's all right.
you have to understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,
I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.
is that right?
hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more than just a big nigger.
Yeah, he needs to have panache.
need to have what? What? - Panache. Uh...
a sense of Showmanship. - Showmanship, yes.
I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules.
the Black Hercules, isn't that clever?
more like Nigger-les.
I said, and I quote: "I would pay top dollar for 'the right nigger'."
now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se.
but is he right as rain?
Oh, Dr. Schultz,
I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here.
nobody.
but one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.
and that is a nigger that can win fights.
now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern.
now, after you have that, and you know you have that, then you can start to implement a grand design.
in other words, first thing is first.
first thing's first.
Ooh! I see you two getting on.
famously.
Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear your native tongue in four years.
well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
two weeks in Boston!
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
two weeks in Boston!
I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.
and Hildi is a charming conversation companion.
well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.
you might caught yourself a little dose of nigger love.
nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.
it's like a pool of black tar.
once it catches your ass, you're caught.
Yes, sir, you stuck.
I don't know, doctor.
you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.
well, naturally.
it is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention, not the plucked chicken.
Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself.
you are quite the dapper European gentleman.
you got to clean these dishes, you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?
you know that nigger, don't you?
who? - "Who"?
don't "who" me, bitch. You know who I'm talking about.
at the table?
I don't know him.
you don't know him. - No.
no, what? - No, sir.
you wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
OK.
Yeah. If you say so.
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.
but if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12, 000 for him.
what would your price be?
well, if I was inclined to be generous, and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...
9, 000. Maybe.
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.
you see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger.
sure wasn't.
it was you who approached me to buy one.
sure was. - Now, that $9, 000 figure Bright Boy's been bandyin' about, that ain't too far off from right.
and if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, - I could do so any day of the week. - Any day.
but, like you said in Greenville, doctor... I don't want to sell him.
it was only your ridiculous offer of $12, 000
that made me even consider it. - Hm-mm.
you know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.
why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
Eskimo Joe, $12, 000. - Hooray, doctor.
hooray. And a wise decision that is.
however, that is a tremendous amount of money.
and the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
persnickety man named Tuttle.
and I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
Hm-mm.
not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing. - Naturally.
so, say I return in about five days time. - Five days?
with my Mr. Tuttle.
and then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy can hash out the finer details between themselves.
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
gentlemen...
may I propose a toast.
to Eskimo Joe. Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
to The Black Hercules.
the Black Hercules.
to The Black Hercules.
you was right, doctor. That name do have pan-ass.
hm.
hildi, top my drink off.
so, Hildi, how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House, huh?
when Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers.
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie. - Hm-mm.
it's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.
but maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos, - huh, sugar bear? - Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.
sure do. - Like Samson? Huh?
no, sir.
you know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back, seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from.
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here, did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off?
no, we just talked and...
Oh, so you haven't seen her back?
I haven't... - No, no, no, no.
Stephen's right, you might find this interesting.
hildi, go on, take off your dress. Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
go on. - Uh, Calvin.
I just got her all dressed up and lookin' nice.
but, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.
they don't got niggers there. He is a man of medicine.
I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain.
these niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.
Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind.
sure would. - Look at that, doctor.
it's like a paintin'. Look at that. - Calvin!
we are eating. Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back.
fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
after dinner, then, Stephen. After dinner.
during the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
Cora, come get this girl!
she a mess. - Yes, ma'am. Oh!
why are you all undone? I just got you done up.
come on in here.
baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side.
you say you ain't know him.
huh?
I said, you said you ain't know him.
I don't. - Yes, you do.
Mr. Stephen...
I don't.
why is you lying to me?
I ain't.
then why is you crying?
you scarin' me.
why is I'm scaring you? - Because you scary.
to speak German this afternoon with Hildi was positively soul-enriching.
doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.
you stay right here.
you indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
why, yes. Yes, I did.
in that case, allow me to propose another proposition.
I'm all ears.
hurry up, goddamn it!
Monsieur Candie... - Stephen!
you just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
my ears ain't worth a damn these days.
excuse him.
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?
you mean get up out of my chair?
if you could manage it. - Why?
it's about dessert. - What about dessert?
I'd rather discuss that in private.
we're having white cake!
what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?
you right, Monsieur Candie. You right. I'll handle it myself.
meet me in the library.
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.
shit get fucked up around here, you blame me.
fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily.
Yes, sir.
well, gentlemen, as you can see, talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required.
if you'll excuse me a moment.
you may clear the dinner service.
you heard him. Go on! Get! Hurry up, girl.
so, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus.
the circus?
what is the matter?
them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
they wants that girl.
Stephen, what the hell are you talking about? Hm?
they playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about.
they ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie.
they here for that girl.
Wh... what girl? Hildi?
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django, them niggers know each other.
he just bought Eskimo Joe.
did he give you any money? - No! Not yet. But...
then he ain't bought diddly. Not yet, nohow.
but he's just about to buy who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.
thank you, Stephen. You're welcome, Calvin.
where you gettin' all this?
why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300?
they doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.
she probably his wife.
now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.
if she's who they want...
why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then?
you wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.
but that 12, 000? That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
his wife, huh?
if it had been a snake, it would have bit me.
those lying...
goddamn time-wastin' sons of bitches.
sons of bitches!
out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types.
Oh, there you are.
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.
that'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window.
Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver trying to sell a passel of ponies.
would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?
of course, brother. - Thank you, darling.
Yeah. Business never sleeps. - Hm-mm.
apropos, before your exit, we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
and we will again. In a moment.
who's your little friend?
this is Ben.
he's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.
and I do mean a long damn time.
old Ben here took care of my daddy...
and my daddy's daddy.
till he up and keeled over one day...
old Ben took care of me.
growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces.
I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland...
surrounded by black faces.
now, seeing them every day, day in, day out,
I only had one question:
why don't they kill us?
now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years,
old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor.
now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither.
but he never did.
why not?
you see, the science of phrenology is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species.
in the skull of the African here, the area associated with submissiveness is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth.
if you examine...
this piece of skull here...
you will notice three distinct dimples.
here, here and here.
now...
if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo, these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull most associated with... creativity.
but this is the skull of Old Ben.
and in the skull of Old Ben, unburdened by genius, these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...
servility.
now, Bright Boy...
I will admit you are pretty clever.
but if I took this hammer here...
and I bashed in your skull with it...
you would have the same three dimples in the same place as Old Ben.
Hey! Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
if you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.
there have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight, but that you can believe!
Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol hanging off these boys' hips here?
thank you ever so much. - Doctor.
where were we?
jackass.
Ah, yes.
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
am I right?
right.
bring out Hildi!
get over there yonder.
sit your ass in that goddamn...
lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
now shut your mouth!
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville, you yourself said that for the right nigger you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.
to which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?
to which you said, "$12, 000."
now, considering y'all have ridden a whole lot of miles, went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull to purchase this lovely lady right here, it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact... the right nigger.
and if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is $12, 000.
and I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation?
Yes, I do, doctor.
you see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda here is my property.
and I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire!
and if y'all think my price for this nigger here is too steep...
what I'm gonna desire to do is...
take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!
right in front of both y'all! - Easy, big fella.
then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!
now, what's it gonna be, doc? Huh?
what's it gonna be?
may I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?
Yes, you may.
that 12.
sold!
to the man with the exceptional beard and his unexceptional nigger.
Mr. Moguy. - Yes, Calvin?
will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12, 000, please?
12000
it was a pleasure doing business with y'all.
now, gentlemen...
if you care to join me in the parlor...
we will be serving white cake.
well done, Calvin.
excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am?
could you please stop playing Beethoven? Take your hands off the harp!
doctor!
doctor, you can't go in there! - Stephen, Stephen.
he ain't got no business going in there.
let it be.
he's just a little upset, that's all.
I'll handle this.
white cake?
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
hm.
you brooding about me getting the best of you, huh?
actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
D'Artagnan.
and I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.
come again?
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote The Three Musketeers.
Yes, of course, doctor.
I figured you must be an admirer.
you named your slave after his novel's lead character.
now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,
I wonder what he would have made of it.
you doubt he'd approve, huh?
Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
soft-hearted Frenchie.
Alexandre Dumas is black.
are these Broomhilda's papers? - Yes, they are.
may I? - Of course.
thank you.
that is her bill of sale, her ownership history, and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor.
would you have ink and pen for me?
right over there on that little table. - Thank you.
thank you.
Broomhilda Von Shaft...
consider yourself a free woman.
Mr. Candie...
normally, I would say auf wiedersehen.
but since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again
and since I never wish to see you again, to you, sir... I say, "goodbye.
let's go.
come on.
one more moment, doctor!
what?
it's a custom here in the South...
once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.
it implies good faith.
I'm not from the South. - But you are...
in my house, doctor.
so I'm afraid I must insist. - Insist?
on what? That I shake your hand?
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.
you know what I think you are? - What you think I am?
no, I don't.
I think you are a bad loser. - And I think you're an abysmal winner.
nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done until the two parties have shook hands.
even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit...
you don't shake my hand.
if I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12, 000?
I don't think so.
Mr. Pooch?
if she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand, you cut her ass down.
you really want me to shake your hand?
I insist.
if you insist.
No! Calvin!
Calvin!
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
nigger's gone crazy! Help!
help, he's killing everyone!
Ah!
Holy...!
shit! Son of a bitch!
damn it! Fuckin'...!
get the...!
damn it, son of a bitch!
What...? Fucking...
goddamn it!
what the fuck is going on?
you shot me!
you stupid son of a bitch! - Sorry, Jessie!
who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?
aim low!
nigger! Gonna kill...!
God! Oh, my God!
motherfucker!
shit!
shit.
hold your fire!
hold your fire!
stop shootin', goddamn it!
Django!
what?
we got your woman!
Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head.
you don't stop all that carrying on, he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
and that ain't no threat, horse boy. That there is a promise.
or...
you can give up, throw your gun out...
we won't kill Hildi. - Horseshit!
honest lnjun, Django. I swear 'fore God.
you give up, ain't no harm gonna come to her.
and I'm supposed to believe your black ass?
personally, I don't give a good goddamn what you believe or don't believe!
I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds, we gonna blow this bitch's brains out! Believe that!
don't do it. You give me up.
six! - Just let me go.
seven! - They got too much.
Django. - Eight!
I love you. - Nine!
hold it! - No.
I give up.
I can't hear you, nigger.
I said I give up!
No!
No!
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
so y'all bounty hunters, huh?
I knew there was something fishy about y'all.
we found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddlebags.
I got to say...
I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.
black boy paid to kill white men? How'd you like that line of work?
probably pretty good while it lasted, huh?
time to say good night to them nuts, blackie.
on three. One...
I got you. Two...
calm down, now, here it comes.
captain?
miss Lara want to see you.
something to do with the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snipping Django.
she gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people.
well, she didn't waste a minute telling me.
how disappointing.
you leavin'.
this here what you take with you.
your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at The Big House could talk about for the last few hours.
seem like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in they life was coming up with all kinds of ways to kill your ass.
now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is...
when you snip a nigger's nuts, most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm... seven minutes.
most of 'em.
well, more than most.
then I says: "Shitfire."
the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
and they still sayin', Let's whip him to death.
or "Throw him to the Mandingos." "Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
and I said, "What's so special about that?"
we do that shit all the time.
hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
lo and behold, out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
and as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, henceforth, till the day you die, all day, every day, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, turning big rocks into little rocks.
now, when you get there, they gonna take away your name, give you a number and a sledgehammer, and say, "Get to work!"
one word of sass, they cuts out your tongue.
and they good at it too. You won't bleed out.
Oh... they does that real good.
they gonna work ya.
all day, every day, till your back give out.
then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer, throw your ass down the nigger hole.
and that will be the story of you, Django.
and what's the golden rule, Frankie, eh?
you don't root abos.
Hey, white boy.
I said, hey, white boy.
shut up, black. You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear.
how'd you like to make $11, 000?
do what, now?
I said how'd you like to make $11, 000? 11, 500, actually.
what the fuck are you talking about?
back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11, 500 fortune, just sittin' there. And y'all rode right past it.
you be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.
I ain't saying that. Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
you can't steal it.
you got to earn it, white boy.
you got something to say, mate, you say it.
the $11, 500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland is in the form of a "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang.
there's a $7, 000 "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him, $1, 500 for each of his three accomplices: Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
now, all four of them gentlemen, they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off.
you know why? 'Cause they just got away with murder.
but it ain't got to be that way.
you and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money.
What'd these jokers do again?
these sons of bitches, they killed innocent people.
stagecoach robbery. Innocent white people.
I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it.
get it out.
wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
but you're a slave. -For murder...
I ain't no goddamn slave. - ...and stagecoach robbery.
do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
$7, 000 for Smitty Bacall. - Hm?
that's a shitload. - I'm a bounty hunter.
yesterday, as a free man,
I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner,Dr. King Schultz.
we tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County.
we finally found their ass layin' low in Candyland.
we went in there to get 'em, things went sour, my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot, then everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.
but y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
and all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
but them four men is still back there, they're still wanted, and that 11, 500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it.
what's the deal?
you tell us who they are and we turn you loose?
no, no, no, no. I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
but, you give me a pistol, one of them horses, and $500 of that 11, 500, and I'll point 'em out to you.
this is a real handbill.
now just 'cause it's a real handbill doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?
did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?
all right, I'm gonna ask you again.
I want you to remember, I don't like liars.
is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville auction, and he rode in on a horse with a white man.
now this white man, was the black his slave?
he weren't no slave.
you fuckin' sure about that? - Damn sure.
what happened over in Candyland? - Bunch-a shootin'.
mass got shot.
who shot him? - The German.
why'd he do that?
nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't.
well, what were they? - Bounty hunters.
fuck me, Roy. I mean, this could be big, mate.
well, smoke, you got a deal.
I got one more condition. - What's that?
when we get there, when time come...
you let me help you kill 'em. - Hey...
you're a funny bugger.
cut him loose. - Yeah, yeah.
you got yourself a deal, blackie.
you got yourself a deal, mate.
Hey!
you're all right for a black fella.
Oh, yeah.
there we go. There you go, mate.
Yeah.
we're gonna give you that packhorse over there.
what them saddlebags got in 'em?
dynamite. - No. I ain't ridin' no horse with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
I can understand that.
Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse and stick 'em in the nigger cage.
a little dynamite for you black fellas to play with.
now, Floyd, you got that rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?
Yeah, right.
why don't you give him your gun and gun belt?
Righto.
now, don't drop the fuckin' thing, all right?
I've just had the sights fixed and they're perfect.
Oh, that's good to know.
throw me up that dynamite.
Jake! - Yeah?
get out there and see what's wrong with them goddamn dogs!
D'artagnan, motherfuckers!
Hey!
auf Wiedersehen.
it's me, baby.
Cora, would you prepare us some coffee?
sheba, you help her.
come on.
Oh, y'all gonna be together with Calvin in the by-and-by, all right.
just a bit sooner than y'all was expectin'.
Billy Crash.
now, where were we?
Oh, that's right.
last time I seen you, you had your hands on my...
Django! You black son of a bitch!
the D is silent, hillbilly.
Oh, no!
now, all you black folks,
I suggest you get away from all these white folks.
not you, Stephen.
you right where you belong.
Cora, before you go, will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?
do what now? - I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."
Bye, Miss Lara.
y'all two run along now.
Stephen, how you like my new duds?
you know, before now I didn't know that burgundy was my color.
I count six shots, nigger.
I count two guns, nigger.
you said in 76 years on this plantation, you seen all manner-a shit done to niggers.
but I notice, you didn't mention kneecappin'.
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!
seventy-six years, Stephen.
how many niggers you think you see come and go, huh?
seven thousand?
eight thousand?
nine thousand?
nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine?
every single word that came out of Calvin Candie's mouth was nothin' but horseshit.
but he was right about one thing: I am that one nigger in 10, 000.
you son of a bitch!
you motherfucker!
Oh, sweet Jesus, let me kill this nigger!
you ain't gonna get away with this, Django!
they gonna catch your black ass.
you gonna be on the wanted posters now, nigger.
the bounty hunters gonna be lookin' for you.
you can run, nigger, but they gonna find your ass!
and when they do, oh, Lord, what they gonna do to your ass!
they ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!
you done fucked up!
this Candyland, nigger!
you can't destroy Candyland!
we been here! There's always gonna be a Candyland!
can't no nigger gunfighter kill all the white folks in the world!
they gonna find your black ass!
Django!
you uppity son of a...
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.
you know what they are going to call you? "The fastest gun in the South.
let's get outta here.
who was that nigger?
its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
the bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
coming!
hang on a second.
Hello?
can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.
looking sharp.
use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
sorry. I'm excited.
here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.
a perfect report card, all B's.
very proud.
ma! I got a thing going here.
you got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!
wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.
is that fuzz gel? - A little. SpeciaI day, graduation.
never thought I'd make it.
three days grade school, three days high school.
those were awkward.
three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
you did come back different.
Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
hear about Frankie? - Yeah.
you going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.
everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
that's why we don't need vacations.
boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!
Bee-men. - Amen!
Hallelujah!
students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...
...9: 15.
that concludes our ceremonies.
and begins your career at Honex Industries!
will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
heads up! Here we go.
keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.
welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
this is it!
we know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
honey!
that girI was hot. - She's my cousin!
she is? - Yes, we're all cousins.
right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
these bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
what do you think he makes? - Not enough.
here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
what does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
can anyone work on the Krelman?
of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
but choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
the same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
what's the difference?
you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
so you'll just work us to death?
we'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"what's the difference?" How can you say that?
one job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
but, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
why would you question anything? We're bees.
we're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
you ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
please clear the gate. RoyaI Nectar Force on approach.
wait a second. Oheck it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
they know what it's like outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!
you guys did great!
you're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were. - I don't know.
their day's not planned.
outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
you can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
right.
look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
it's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
distant. Distant.
look at these two.
couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.
it must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
he had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.
what were you doing during this?
trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
a little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
we're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
six miles, huh? - Barry!
a puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
maybe I am. - You are not!
we're going 0900 at J-Gate.
what do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
dad, you surprised me.
you decide what you're interested in?
well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.
do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
son, let me tell you about stirring.
you grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
you get yourseIf into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.
you know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
you were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
that's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.
you're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
you're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!
wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
let's open some honey and celebrate!
maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.
shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
we're starting work today! - Today's the day.
come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!
one of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side.
What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!
couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
make your choice.
you want to go first? - No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
wax monkey's always open.
the Krelman opened up again.
what happened?
a bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
all right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
what happened to you? Where are you?
I'm going out. - Out? Out where?
out there. - Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
you're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
another call coming in.
if anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean delivery on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
it's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
sign here, here. Just initial that.
thank you. - OK.
you got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
so be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
aIso, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
that's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
all right, launch positions!
buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
black and yellow!
Hello!
you ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
wind, check.
antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.
wings, check. - Stinger, check.
scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies, let's move it out!
pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
all of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
so blue.
I feel so fast and free!
box kite!
flowers!
this is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.
bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.
that is one nectar collector!
ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.
that's amazing. Why do we do that?
that's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those?
copy that visual.
wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
affirmative.
this is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
it smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
my sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
problem!
guys! - This could be bad.
affirmative.
very close.
gonna hurt.
mama's little boy.
you are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
should we tell him? - I think he knows.
what is this?!
match point!
you can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
gross.
there's a bee in the car!
do something! - I'm driving!
Hi, bee. - He's back here!
he's going to sting me!
nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
he blinked!
spray him, Granny!
what are you doing?!
wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
can't fly in rain.
can't fly in rain.
can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
check out my new résumé. I made it into a fold-out brochure.
you see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
what was that?
maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...
drapes!
that is diabolical.
it's fantastic. It's got all my speciaI skilIs, even my top-ten favorite movies.
what's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that...
...kind of stuff.
no wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
when I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
there's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feeI it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
wait! Stop! Bee!
stand back. These are winter boots.
wait!
don't kill him!
you know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
why does his life have less value than yours?
why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
my brochure!
there you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.
put that on your résumé brochure.
my whole face could puff up.
make it one of your special skilIs.
knocking someone out is aIso a speciaI skill.
right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
you could put carob chips on there. - Bye.
supposed to be less calories. - Bye.
I gotta say something.
she saved my life. I gotta say something.
all right, here it goes.
what would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
it's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
no. Yes. No.
do it. I can't.
how should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
you're talking. - Yes, I know.
you're talking!
I'm so sorry.
no, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.
but I don't recall going to bed.
well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
this is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
and if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
that was a little weird.
I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.
wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?
the talking thing.
same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
that's very funny. - Yeah.
bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
anyway...
can I...
...get you something? - Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
it's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
it's just coffee. - I hate to impose.
don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't. - Have some.
no, I can't. - Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
where? - These stripes don't help.
you look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
are you all right?
no.
he's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
he finally gets there.
he runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.
and he says, "Watermelon?" I thought you said Guatemalan.
"why would I marry a watermelon?"
is that a bee joke?
that's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
so, what are you gonna do, Barry?
about work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
you do? - Sure.
my parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really? - My only interest is flowers.
our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
anyway, if you look...
there's my hive right there. See it?
you're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
no way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
why do girIs put rings on their toes? - Why not?
it's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.
you all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.
just having two cups of coffee!
anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
are you...?
can I take a piece of this with me?
sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks! - Yeah.
all right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.
or not.
OK, Barry.
and thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
this can't possibly work.
he's all set to go. We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
sounds amazing. - It was amazing!
it was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
giant, scary humans! What were they like?
huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
they eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.
do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.
how'd you get back? - Poodle.
you did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
you had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
well... - Well?
well, I met someone.
you did? Was she Bee-ish?
a wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.
spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
so who is she?
she's... human.
no, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.
she's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
we're not dating.
you're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
she saved my life! And she understands me.
this is over!
eat this.
this is not over! What was that?
they call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!
and that's not what they eat. That's what falIs off what they eat!
you know what a Cinnabon is? - No.
it's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
sit down!
...really hot! - Listen to me!
we are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
there's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
you have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
thinking bee. - Thinking bee.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
there he is. He's in the pool.
you know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
how much longer will this go on?
it's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
what life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!
would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
you coming?
got everything?
all set!
go ahead. I'll catch up.
don't be too long.
watch this!
we're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.
he doesn't respond to yelling!
then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
sorry, I've gotta go.
where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.
a girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
they have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
to be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
a tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
no. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?
it's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
you don't have that?
we have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
dumb bees!
you must want to sting all those jerks.
we try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
so you have to watch your temper.
very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:
anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
what is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.
he's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!
what was that? A Pic 'N' save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
it felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
you've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.
what in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
how did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
ray Liotta Private Select?
is he that actor? - I never heard of him.
why is this here? - For people. We eat it.
you don't have enough food of your own?
well, yes. - How do you get it?
bees make it. - I know who makes it!
and it's hard to make it!
there's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
it's organic. - It's our-ganic!
it's just honey, Barry.
just what?!
bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
you've taken our homes, schooIs, hospitaIs! This is all we have!
and it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
you almost done? - Almost.
he is here. I sense it.
well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
you're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something. So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
I don't understand. I thought we were friends.
the last thing we want to do is upset bees!
you're too late! It's ours now!
you, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
you, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, lgnacio!
where is the honey coming from?
tell me where!
honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
crazy person!
what horrible thing has happened here?
these faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere!
just keep still.
what? You're not dead?
do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
to Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
and you? - He really is dead.
all right.
what is that?! - Oh, no!
a wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?
jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!
how much do you people need to see?!
open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
from NPR News in Washington, I'm OarI Kasell.
but don't kill no more bugs!
bee! - Moose blood guy!!
you hear something? - Like what?
like tiny screaming.
turn off the radio.
what's up, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.
I mean, that honey's ours.
bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.
it's a close community.
not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
what if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.
nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
at least you're out in the world. You must meet girIs.
mosquito girIs try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.
mosquito girI don't want no mosquito.
you got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch you all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?
we throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
what is this place?
a bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
they are pinheads!
pinhead.
Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
the Thomas 3000!
smoker?
ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
a couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
they make the honey, and we make the money.
"they make the honey, and we make the money?"
Oh, my!
what's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walIs?
our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
this is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!
that's a drag queen!
what is this?
Oh, no!
there's hundreds of them!
bee honey.
our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
this is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
do these look like rumors?
that's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.
how did you get mixed up in this?
he's been talking to humans.
what? - Talking to humans?!
he has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
make out? Barry!
we do not.
you wish you could. - Whose side are you on?
the bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
what right do they have to our honey?
we live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
even if it's true, what can one bee do?
sting them where it really hurts.
in the face! The eye!
that would hurt. - No.
up the nose? That's a killer.
there's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.
with Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
weather with Storm Stinger.
sports with Buzz Larvi.
and Jeanette Ohung.
good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
a tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?
bees have never been afraid to change the world.
what about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
we were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
how old are you?
the bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
you know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
it's a common name. Next week...
he looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
next week...
glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
in tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81 .
honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
quiet, please. ActuaI work going on here.
is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
hello. - Hello, bee.
this is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a haIf. Vibram sole, I believe.
why does he talk again?
listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
but it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
why is yogurt night so difficult?!
you poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
Frosting... - How many sugars?
just one. I try not to use the competition.
so why are you helping me?
bees have good qualities.
and it takes my mind off the shop.
instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
those are great, if you're three.
and artificiaI flowers.
Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.
bent stingers, pointless pollination.
bees must hate those fake things!
nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
this lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.
you sure you want to go through with it?
am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty!
it's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
what have we gotten into here, Barry?
it's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
you think billion-dollar multinationaI food companies have good lawyers?
everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
what's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.
well, if it isn't the bee team.
you boys work on this?
all rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
all right. Oase number 4475,
superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
a privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman.
born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
if we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
talking bee!
how do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
they could be using laser beams!
robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.
it's important to all bees. We invented it!
we make it. And we protect it with our lives.
unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
call your first witness.
so, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you aIso own Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
no. - I couldn't hear you.
no. - No.
because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
they're very lovable creatures.
yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
you mean like this?
bears kill bees!
how'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!
biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
so, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.
where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.
but you've never been a police officer, have you?
no, I haven't.
no, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee cuIture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.
or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
that's not his reaI name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
thank you. Thank you.
I see from your résumé that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?
exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
this isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!
why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
order in this court! - You're all thinking it!
order! Order, I say!
say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
right. Well, here's to a great team.
to a great team!
well, hello.
Ken! - Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
no, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
there's a little left. I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
so I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myseIf. The ball's a little grabby.
that's where I usually sit. Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a speciaI skill.
you think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
do we?
bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
that's just what I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
look at that.
you know, I've just about had it with your little mind games.
what's that? - Italian Vogue.
mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
a lot of ads.
remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
how do you like the smell of flames?!
not as much.
water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Chopstick hat! This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
well, well, well, a royal flush!
you're bluffing. - Am l?
surf's up, dude!
poo water!
that bowI is gnarly.
except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
you know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
we need to talk!
he's just a little bee!
and he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
no, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
my nerves are fried from riding on this emotionaI roller coaster!
goodbye, Ken.
and for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificiaI sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.
are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
we would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
you got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?
only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
what exactly is your relationship to that woman?
we're friends.
good friends? - Yes.
how good? Do you live together?
wait a minute...
are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!
Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!
hold me back!
you're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
he's denouncing bees!
don't you all date your cousins?
Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
order! Order!
the venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!
you see? You can't treat them like equaIs! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.
what angeI of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
order, please!
the case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
Hey, buddy. - Hey.
is there much pain? - Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
it doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
they got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
look, there's a little celery still on it.
what was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
all adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!
all right.
you think it was all a trap?
of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.
what were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
what will the humans do to us if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in moteIs. That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
could you get a nurse to close that window?
Why? - The smoke.
bees don't smoke.
right. Bees don't smoke.
bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.
that's it! That's our case!
it is? It's not over?
get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.
and assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
yes? Yes, Your Honor!
where is the rest of your team?
well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a resuIt, we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time?
how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
they have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissaI of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.
but you can't! We have a terrific case.
where is your proof? Where is the evidence?
show me the smoking gun!
hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?
here is your smoking gun.
what is that?
it's a bee smoker!
what, this? This harmless little contraption?
this couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?"
is this what nature intended for us?
to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?
living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?
what are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.
ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!
free the bees! Free the bees!
free the bees!
free the bees! Free the bees!
the court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
all the honey will finally belong to the bees.
now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.
you'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
all right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.
what if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?
we've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
first, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.
then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.
we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a fiIthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.
we're all aware of what they do in the woods.
wait for my signal.
take him out.
he'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
and we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...
but it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus heaIth products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.
can't breathe.
bring it in, boys!
hold it right there! Good.
tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!
I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.
shut down honey production!
stop making honey!
turn your key, sir!
what do we do now?
cannonball!
we're shutting honey production!
mission abort.
aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
what's going on? Where is everybody?
are they out celebrating? - They're home.
they don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle OarI was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
at least we got our honey back.
sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
it's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.
this was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.
and now...
now I can't.
I don't understand why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
they're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.
you don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
what did you want to show me? - This.
what happened here?
that is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
they're all wilting.
doesn't look very good, does it?
no.
and whose fault do you think that is?
you know, I'm gonna guess bees.
bees?
specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.
it's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
that's our whole SAT test right there.
take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.
and then, of course...
the human species?
so if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?
I know this is aIso partly my fault.
how about a suicide pact?
how do we do it?
I'll sting you, you step on me. - That just kills you twice.
right, right.
listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?
to the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
they've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
it's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.
wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
roses!
roses?!
roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.
flowers, bees, pollen!
I know. That's why this is the last parade.
maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?
could you slow down?
OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a totaI disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.
actually, it's completely closed down.
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
but I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
all right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.
all we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
bees. - Park.
pollen! - Flowers.
Repollination! - Across the nation!
tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.
they've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
official floral business. It's real.
sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
thank you. It was a gift.
once inside, we just pick the right float.
how about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
where should I sit? - What are you?
I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?
it goes under the mattresses.
not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.
you do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
then all we do is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
once at the airport, there's no stopping us.
stop! Security.
you and your insect pack your float? - Yes.
has it been in your possession the entire time?
would you remove your shoes?
remove your stinger. - It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.
then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.
can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
it's got to work.
attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.
we have a bit of bad weather in New York.
it looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there and talk to them.
be careful.
can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
captain, I'm in a real situation.
What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.
bee!
don't freak out! My entire species...
what are you doing?
wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?
don't move.
Oh, Barry.
good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.
would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?
and please hurry!
what happened here?
there was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.
one's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!
is that another bee joke? - No!
no one's flying the plane!
this is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?
this is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
he's unconscious, and so is the copilot.
not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?
as a matter of fact, there is.
who's that? - Barry Benson.
from the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metaI bee.
it's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
why not? Isn't John TravoIta a pilot? - Yes.
how hard could it be?
wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.
this is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.
Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...
that's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
we have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.
just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.
they've done enough damage.
but isn't he your only hope?
technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.
their wings are too small...
haven't we heard this a million times?
the surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.
get this on the air! - Got it.
stand by. - We're going live.
the way we work may be a mystery to you.
making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
but let me tell you about a small job.
if you do it well, it makes a big difference.
more than we realized. To us, to everyone.
that's why I want to get bees back to working together.
that's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.
we get behind a fellow.
black and yellow! - Hello!
left, right, down, hover.
HOVER? - Forget hover.
this isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
that may have been helping me. - And now we're not!
so it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
all of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!
move out!
our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!
don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.
it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
it's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourseIf together. You have to snap out of it!
you snap out of it.
you snap out of it.
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
hold it! - Why? Come on, it's my turn.
how is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?
the Pollen Jocks!
they do get behind a fellow.
black and yellow. - Hello.
all right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.
where? I can't see anything. Can you?
no, nothing. It's all cloudy.
come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
thinking bee. - Thinking bee.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.
what? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
bring the nose down.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
what in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.
out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
land on that flower!
ready? Full reverse!
spin it around!
not that flower! The other one! - Which one?
that flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!
that's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant puIsating flower made of millions of bees!
pull forward. Nose down. TaiI up.
rotate around it.
this is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.
am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?
get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!
just drop it. Be a part of it.
aim for the center!
now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
come on, already.
Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!
Yes. No high-five! - Right.
Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?
what giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!
thank you. - But we're not done yet.
listen, everyone!
this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.
that means this is our last chance.
we're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.
if we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?
are we going to be bees, or just Museum of NaturaI History keychains?
we're bees!
keychain!
then follow me! Except Keychain.
hold on, Barry. Here.
you've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
that's our Barry.
mom! The bees are back!
if anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!
here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?
would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!
sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?
would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.
sorry I'm late.
he's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.
have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.
no problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.
you're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?
all right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.
thank you, Barry!
that bee is living my life!
let it go, Kenny.
when will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.
beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.
between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.
you have got to start thinking bee, my friend.
thinking bee! - Me?
hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!
you've got spunk, Wolfhouse. I'll give you that.
I don't got room in my pocket for more of your money.
I got a little spunk for you.
you couldn't hit your own ball bag with your own wrinkled cock.
chance.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. You play rim rules?
doesn't everybody?
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.
hold on there, girlfriend.
you're gonna chance...
...you're gonna have to earn it.
Oh, no. No way.
forget about it. I'm out of here. Where's my...?
Hey. You said you wanted to chance, now take a chance.
all right, all right.
son of a bitch!
up yours, Johnny Cash.
okay. Grab him, boys.
you weren't trying to play me for a fool, were you, wolfhouse?
beginner's luck.
you don't come into my place of business and take my money like that.
now, what I should do is beat seven shades of shit out of you.
but I'll teach you something somebody... - Hey!
what's going on down here?
Todd, welcome home!
I'm just having some fun with your younger, dumber brother.
might not be the best time. Everyone's waiting.
Oh, of course.
Padre?
I'll come back for the rest.
great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.
my friends...
...as we gather today to mourn the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...
...what can I say that Johan can't say for himself?
Hello, all.
if you are watching this, then I have croaked.
now I will never know what happens on The Young and the Restless.
he loved that show. - But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...
...for what you have added to my long and happy life.
most of all, my mother.
mother, I always knew you would outlive me.
I loved you.
Prosit.
Todd, Jan, my smart and talented grandsons...
...Take good care of the restaurant.
it is the last piece of your heritage.
and don't worry, someone will be watching over you.
Popo!
Hey. It's Popo. - Popo was given to me...by my father on his deathbed.
prosit!
and finally, to me.
looking good down there.
say good night, Popo.
good night, Popo.
for hundreds of years, it has been a wolfhouse tradition...to spread the ashes of our loved ones in Munich.
I am too old. I want you boys to go to Germany...and carry out this tradition for your grandfather.
sure, it would be an honor for us, Great Gam Gam. When?
well, you must leave immediately.
the tradition is to spread the ashes...during the festival on the Theresienwiese.
there you will meet a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
he will take you to the family resting place.
the festival begins this week.
the festival of the what-what?
Oh, boys, you know this festival as oktoberfest.
we're in.
we really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen and spread Grandpa's ashes.
he's supposed to meet us here.
so there's nothing we can do but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?
come on, guys.
are you making fun of us, mate?
what? No.
we're singing the beloved drinking songs of our country...and you sing us that bloody jingo jango?
I reckon you're taking the piss out of oktoberfest.
we're just singing.
what do you think, mate?
I think we should fucking brain them.
Hey, we love oktober...
hot cheese soup!
hot cheese so...!
come on. This is the Frauleins Gone Wild!
just kiss each other, ja?
helmut, my God, are you okay?
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!
let's get the bastards!
so this is oktoberfest.
wolfhouse?
Yeah.
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
Hi! - Let's go.
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here. There's some crazy...
gotcha. - Hey!
he's got me! - He's gone crazy dingo.
make fast! Make very fast!
split! Split!
where are we going, Mr. Spiedelspackel?
Schniedelwichsen. Come.
halt. See, we're here.
Johan?
the ashes. We left them back at that tent.
we gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.
come. Come now.
we in the right neighborhood?
Oh, hello, blondie.
you care for a dance?
Jan? Jan?
leave my brother alone.
I miss you!
the password!
drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
they're playing Quarters!
Hey, Beer Pong!
upside-down chugs!
come! Come in here.
I'd bugger her for a game of soldiers, huh?
hello. Pim Scutney. This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.
team England.
I am Jan Wolfhouse and this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.
and what is this?
Beerfest, innit!
is this part of oktoberfest?
oktoberfest is for tossers and sheep-shaggers.
Beerfest is our lives.
the ultimate test of a beer-gamer's mettle!
Where's the American team? - Yeah.
that's worth a squirt, innit? - What?
excuse me, guys.
please vomit in proper receptacles!
wait a second. Look at those urns over there.
they look just like Grandpa's.
that's why Schniedelwasher brought us here.
we're supposed to put Grandpa's urn up there with those.
we gotta go back and get it.
you go. I'm never leaving this place.
das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!
Hello, governor!
we got ourselves a tie.
you see them blokes in the knickers?
that's the German team, the champs.
their family owns the oldest brewery in Bavaria.
they're regular diamond geezers, they are, right?
why does the last guy chug out of a shoe?
that's no shoe!
that's Das Boot!
and she's a cruel old mistress, she is.
drink up, Hansel!
wow, they're fast!
das Boot!
das Boot! Das Boot!
Schniedelspanker!
von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.
your last name's Von Wolfhausen?
get the fuck out of here. So is ours! Wolfhouse.
we're cousins? Oh, this just gets better and better!
we must be related through our grandfather, Johan von wolfhausen.
why are you taking him? Where's he going?
we kind of need to stick close.
he is of no concern to you. - But he was just walking us through. He...
you do not speak of Beerfest outside of Beerfest!
you do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.
but our grandfather was Johan Von Wolf...
your grandfather was no Von Wolfhausen.
your grandfather was a thieving bastard stable boy.
what did you say? - Baron Ludwig Von Wolfhausen...
...our great-grandfather, the most legendary brewmeister in all Deutschland.
he perfected the Von Wolfhausen beer recipe.
it was the greatest beer in all the world.
when Ludwig died, your grandfather stole the only copy of the recipe created.
hold on a second. Our grandfather didn't brew beer.
he had this little sausage house in colorado. He couldn't...
he could and he did.
he stole our recipe and fled Germany with his mother...
...a common Bavarian...
what's the English word I'm looking for?
whore.
Gam Gam a whore?
obviously there's a translation problem here.
hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.
now you're crossing the line. - No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!
and now, instead of having Deutschland's greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.
ja, we are not your cousins.
you are the offspring of the bastard son of some whore!
don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not! - Punch me! Do it!
ja, you big tough guy. Kill me, come on.
do it now! Kill me. What are you waiting for?
typical Americans. This is why we don't allow you in our Beerfest.
you get a few drinks in you and you become the Dirty Harry.
you should go back to your strip malls and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.
and then you can punch each other silly.
okay. Okay.
okay. Sounds like you guys fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?
ja, maybe a little. I think we just beat the Irish, so...
Oh, that's good. The champions. What? - Well, I'll tell you what.
why don't you pick your best two? Because you just opened up a can of corn.
corn.
we are laughing. We are laughing at you.
our best two? You want our best two? - The corn.
how about our worst two, right? Hammacher! Schlemmer!
you take the big guy. I'll get the little one.
you ready, du kleiner Hosenscheiber?
everyone at once. First team to finish wins. On my word.
let's do this. - Ja, do it.
Hey, boys, why don't you let us put a nipple on that for you?
I remember my first beer.
Prosit.
allow me to introduce our grandfather:
wolfgang Von Wolfhausen.
take a good look...
...for this is a real Von Wolfhausen.
grandpapa.
Oh, shit.
so you are the progeny of Johan.
I am guessing that he is the one who taught you how to drink beer.
now...
...where is our recipe?
what fucking recipe?
friends...
...this is all that remains of a thieving stable boy......who ran away to America with his whore mother!
I'm a sucker for family reunions.
here are a couple of euros.
go back and get a BJ from your great-grandma, on me.
now get out of here.
BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!
they called Grandpa a thief and Gam Gam a whore!
we gotta go back. We gotta go back and beat those guys.
Oh, come on, man, that's crazy. - Is it? We can do this.
we can do what?
great Gam Gam.
my boys. Oh, welcome.
honey, what happened to your eye?
I accidentally walked into a wall. Yeah, the Berlin wall.
I'll tell Tippy to get some cold pig stomach.
we put that on Janny's eye.
so tell me, was the ceremony beautiful?
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.
was it a peaceful resting place?
have you ever been to the family resting place?
no, but I've been told it is wonderful.
quiet, lovely. - Yeah.
and how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?
Oh, he's fine. Great guy. - Yeah. Good.
he says hi.
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.
now your grandpapa can rest in peace.
she couldn't be more not a whore.
we're gonna defend her honor.
we're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!
we're gonna put together our own team! - Yes.
we'll get the biggest drinkers, the best beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.
then we're gonna go back and kick the tar out of those Krauts!
that's my brother! God, I missed you.
Beerfest it is.
they want a war?
we'll give them a war they won't believe.
so how'd you find him?
some dude, used to work with him at the brewery.
haven't seen him since Hands Across America.
Oh, that's right.
I heard that when the brewery gave him his pink slip, he killed a guy.
I heard that too.
there he is.
you got nothing, baby. I got everything!
you got nothing! You got nothing!
we're gonna win this thing.
can I have your autograph?
Oh, no autographs, kids.
no, no, no. Thanks anyway. Get you next time.
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
I haven't seen you guys since... Hands Across America?
we were just saying that.
we almost made it. Couple breaks in the chain, right?
what's going on? You disappeared for a while.
we heard you got fired from the brewery.
goddamn brewery!
they brew 10, 000 bottles of beer a day.
I drink 45 off the assembly line, and I'm the asshole.
Jim Tobleson's a fucking chatty cathy.
I did my three years up at the county pen.
made some friends, went Muslim. Now I'm out, praise Allah.
I heard that someone died that day.
Yeah, somebody did die that day.
me.
I had the greatest job in the world, brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.
not to mention all the beer you could drink, right?
they took it away from me.
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get that feeling back again.
what?
there he is.
Nathan cornwell has discovered......pneumono-ultra-microscopic- silico-volcano-canaisis.
big round of applause, people.
you want that geek?
what's he gonna do, check my urine?
I met Finkelstein back in college.
he was a real brainiac, that nerd.
studied everything about everything. Including beer.
so shut the fuck up.
what are you doing? Put the frog on the table.
clean out the floxinator or something, all right?
people, listen up. Use your thumbs.
locate the seminal vesicle here, the ejaculatory ducts here.
then stroke it. Stroke it. Stroke it hard.
cup the gonads. If you don't cup the gonads...
Finky!
Jan? Todd? What are you guys doing here?
Hey, smart coat. - Oh, thank you. It's rayon.
what are you doing?
we're extracting frog gamete for cloning trials.
you're jerking him off.
who's the hippo? - Phil Krundel.
the name's Landfill.
listen, Fink. We're putting together a drinking team.
there's a competition and we want you to be part of it.
come on. I'm really busy. - We're serious.
you don't understand. I'm a respected member of the scientific community.
sorry.
we can't do it without you, Fink. - No chance. I have a job.
I've got a house with a pool and a two-car garage. I got three Ph. D.s.
Hey! Don't do that!
I'm published in four journals. - What?
toad Load Weekly?
we need you, Fink. America needs you.
that sounds a little dramatic.
that's the part we haven't told you. We're competing against the Germans.
Germans?
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.
you got 15 minutes to tell me more.
can you move over, please? - I like to sit in the middle.
what am I supposed to do?
you have room. You're little.
you wanna sit on this side? - Fuck you.
Jan, who are we meeting out here?
Jan, who are we meeting out here? - Barry Badrinath.
what? No. - Who's Barry Badrinath?
I'm putting a team together. - Turn around.
who's Barry? - Don't worry.
who's Barry Badrinath? Who's Barry Badrinath?
will you shut the hell up? Shut up.
Barry Badrinath was the best beer-gamer ever.
best at Quarters, at Pong, best at everything.
we should put him on our team.
see, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend. - Yahtzee.
zip it, Fink. - Sorry.
just think about Gam Gam for a minute, all right?
is this guy really that good? - Yeah.
he's the best.
we should put him on our team, then.
there he is. - Where?
right there.
Oh, my God.
what happened to him?
all right. It's a regular hot-dog cart in here, huh?
all right, here's how it works.
one dollar to look at it. Two dollars to touch it.
three dollars to watch me touch it.
that's lots of nice-looking manhood.
back the fuck up, Antonio!
my dick!
my apologies.
five to touch it while I touch my toes.
six dollars to touch it while I touch your toe...
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?
Todd. And Fink.
Hey, looking good, Finky. - You too, Barry.
I wish I could give you a deal here, but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?
so it's $ 10 for a BJ, $ 12 for an HJ, $ 15 for a ZJ.
what's a ZJ?
if you have to ask, big man, you can't afford it.
I got $4.
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.
move along, then. I got a mouth to feed.
Barry, wait.
Jan, hold on. That's not such a good idea.
Barry!
there's this big beer-games competition.
we're putting a team together.
we want you. - Twenty-five bucks.
no, no, no. You'd be training with us over the next year.
thirty bucks? - Jan, forget it.
no, just show us some of the old coin tricks. Come on.
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.
no. Wait. - No?
clearly, you've fallen on hard times.
this would be a chance to get back to the glory days.
it's a chance to show you still got it. You still got it, right?
you bet your ass I do.
show them.
watch and learn, baby diapers.
just like college.
it's nothing to worry about. He's shaking the cobwebs off.
I got it. I got it.
all right, here we go.
this guy blows. - Come on. You can do it.
glasses, maybe. I...
what are you looking at?
Barry, what happened to you?
get out of here! Get out of here!
get out of here! - Barry, Barry...
get out of here! - Help! Help!
so, what about Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?
he'd down a beer ball with every meal.
he's no good. He had that Al Roker surgery.
he went black?
don't be a moron. He got his stomach stapled.
most he can fit are two Triscuits and a glass of water.
Really?
Oh, boy.
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.
forget about it. You're done. You don't have any more, Badrinath.
Oh, yeah?
he's got a gun!
unbelievable!
that's incredible.
I'm better when I'm drunk.
I'll say. - Of course. So is everybody.
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!
get them in there. - All right!
well, boys, if we're gonna train...
...we're gonna need a training facility!
it's perfect!
it's amazing!
look at the size of this graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!
a direct-draw beer dispenser.
Half-barrel capacity, with an anti-foaming mechanism.
these are really the coins?
Hey. I think I found us a creepy new mascot.
Yeah, fuck it. Yeah, give it a rim job.
don't. That belonged to our grandpa.
sorry.
listen up, fellas.
the next 11 months are gonna be tough.
as tough as anything you've ever done.
we're gonna drink beer. And a lot of it.
if anybody here isn't up to it...l'm gonna give you one last chance to walk out that door.
that's a good one, Todd. - Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
because in this silver slice of heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.
golden, delicious beer.
and no one leaves here until we finish every single last drop.
all right, let's have the keys.
all you guys. You too, big boy. - Don't lose these.
all right, Fink, hit me.
sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.
Hey, Barry, how about a little warm-up match?
good one. But I'll leave the practicing to the amateurs.
all right, guys, let's focus, huh? Huddle up.
all right!
guys, those Germans are incredible drinkers.
better than anything I've ever seen.
now, Fink, they've got this thing called The Boot.
there's a secret way to drink it. I don't know what it is.
you'll have to figure that out for us. - You got it, Hot Toddy.
one more thing, I cannot stress this enough, people.
this is a super-secret competition. You cannot tell anybody about this.
or else what?
the guy that brought us there, they killed him.
but let's not worry about that now.
let's drink some beer! - Yeah!
all right! - Yeah, cheers!
ice cold.
anyone else's cold? - Really cold.
drinking and dancing at the same time. That's what's making it tough.
thought there might be a bug in there.
my teeth hurt, it's so cold. That's what makes me have to stop a bit.
how many beers in this thing? - About 125 beers, yeah.
a hundred and twenty-five?
might have a cavity here.
you're dead, bitch. - Oh, yeah?
remember we made Fudgsicles out of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?
eight points.
these big ones have a different flight pattern.
nobody said it was gonna be easy.
that shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.
it's great motivation. A reminder of the humiliation.
I wouldn't mind having it while training.
okay.
you are a good friend.
all right, here we go.
Oh, yeah.
I know you love it, Muscle Lips. Let's go.
lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.
sorry.
get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.
don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke, you goyim schmendrik miskayt.
I don't know why you're here. You can't drink beer.
I'll show you how to drink a beer, motherfucker.
fucking man cow.
Hey, I think somebody's trying to chug in my face!
look out, Germans!
you got chutzpah, Fuckelstein.
that's great. - Hey, Todd.
about the old girlfriend thing. Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?
I don't know. - It was just a one-night stand, right?
wasn't even that good-looking. Real dead fish, right?
I mean, she just laid there, taking it like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?
I happen to have married that plastic fuck doll!
Todd, no!
Hey! Get off him!
someone's chewing my leg!
I hate you, Badrinath!
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.
Oh, my God.
Hello? Yes.
we need an ambulance immediately at 622 Francis Drive.
come on, Phil. Stay with me, honey.
Oh, my God, what is that?
ham.
Phil?
not again.
how'd we do?
not good.
if we're gonna drink like the Germans, I think we're gonna need a little help.
you don't have to yell.
don't say anything to Great Gam Gam about the competition.
don't talk about her being a whore.
she's a whore? - No, she's not a whore.
so what if she was a whore? - She's not.
I'm just saying, some of my best friends are whores.
Yeah, we know.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.
can I help you? - Who are you?
my name's cherry.
is everything okay? - Everything is fine.
great Gam Gam.
cherry is here to help me now that my Johan is gone.
my darling great-grandboys...
...and their delicious-looking friends.
come in.
and summer sausage.
just came out of the refrigerator.
here, try this. Oh, no, wait. Here, let me warm it up for you.
no, that's fine. We're okay.
when we were at oktoberfest, we noticed that the Germans were excellent drinkers.
Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing. - How do they get good?
well, from the time that they are little kids...
...Germans are raised to be excellent beer drinkers.
how? - Well, for one thing...
...they train high up in the Alps.
interesting. High-altitude training. Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.
they are also taught to relax the muscles of the throat.
Germans can pretty much stick anything down there.
I myself can probably fit in at least... oh, at least nine inches.
here, let me show you. - No. You don't have to demonstrate.
what else do the Germans do?
they also practice by drinking the urine of a ram.
the what? - They drink ram's piss.
because of the pH balance? - No.
because if you can drink ram's piss, fuck, you can drink almost anything.
she said "fuck." - Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?
no, I was saying it was a tradition back in the old country.
damn, that's nasty. The old country must have been fucked up.
now, come on, baby, it's time for your nap.
come on. - Okay. Well...
see you boys later.
I always sleep better when I have a little sausage in me.
look, if you ask me...
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing is a real possibility.
bavarians have been warming sausages like that for hundreds of years.
would you say it's their oldest profession?
shut up, Landfill.
all right, but more importantly, where are we gonna find a ram?
I'm gonna fucking puke.
that's the most disgusting thing I've ever drank.
I doubt that, playboy.
Oh, God, is there anything better?
not right now.
you know, fellas, maybe training alone on a rooftop...
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.
maybe we should get out there and mix it up with some randoms, you know?
smart idea, college boy. - Go test our mettle.
Yeah, challenge somebody. Challenge ourselves.
let's get bombed!
Yeah!
Hey. Who ordered the Queer Eye makeover?
we're the party brigade.
we're here to play some drinking games.
drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.
you've gotta drink.
I've got one.
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.
my turn. I never fooled around with coach Gerber.
this one's called the Strikeout.
what you're gonna do is take a hit...
...chug your beer, do a shot, then blow out the smoke.
here goes nothing.
careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.
that's not bad at all.
Strikeout," right?
that's nothing.
don't...
...really, however, see what...
...all the...
...fuss is about.
Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein. - Do I know you?
Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy. - Hey, Jerry.
while I have you here, you forgot my Sunday supplement last week.
wake up, Finky. Wake up.
cops, cops, cops!
dude, aren't you like 40?
I'm 33.
Hey, what the hell?
help!
what a great morning.
night, ladies.
night, Todd. - Bye, Todd.
say hi to the missus.
all right, guys, come on.
one, two, three. - Go.
my glasses!
two, three, go.
maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.
he's so strict.
Hey, Finky...
...how you doing with The Boot? - Not there yet.
I have figured out the problem, I just don't know the solution yet.
check this out.
Hey, fellas, gather up.
here's the thing.
when you drink, the shape of the boot causes an air bubble to form in the toe.
the bubble.
this air bubble shoots around the heel...and explodes towards your face while drinking.
in your face, it explodes.
it's impossible to handle. - It's impossible to handle.
it's unavoidable. The Germans know how.
I find the whole thing frustrating because I can't figure it out.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating. It's frustrat...
can you get the puppet off of me?!
Hey, it's Popo. - Sorry.
you knocked his head off.
wait, wait. There's something in there.
Hey, what is that?
looks like it's German. - Aren't you guys German?
Yeah, so? - Give me that.
I used to work on a German cruise ship.
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.
Really? - What recipe?
must be the old German beer recipe.
those Germans said our grandfather stole their family recipe.
if he had it, why didn't he brew it? - He brew?
maybe he didn't know it was in here. - It supposed to be good?
if this is the recipe, this used to be Germany's greatest beer.
okay, we want three cups.
that's right. Good.
pour it on in, pour it on in.
okay, good. Let's have a little...
how is it, Jan? - Tell us.
it's...
it's beautiful.
it's magical. - It's laughing at me.
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.
I wanna put my dick in it. - I want it to put its dick in me.
I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice and skate on it.
then melt it in the springtime and drink it.
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?
this means Gam Gam really was a whore.
it is good, it is good.
I can't serve it fast enough.
Hey, buddy. - Go with God.
Hey, wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.
nice bottle. - Hey, Landfill.
look at this guy! He's getting better.
dude, you want a Schnitz?
do you want a tip with that?
Yeah.
good one.
give me six Schnitzes. - What the doctor ordered.
drink, drink, drink!
good, good, good.
special delivery!
I have this special delivery for Herr Baron.
can't you see we are training?
I am so sorry, but this package comes all the way from America, ja...
...and look, it is marked: "Most urgent."
what is it, Grandpapa?
they have the recipe.
who else knows of this package? - Absolutely no one.
only me. It's just me.
dispose of him. - Wait!
no, no, no! What about "Don't shoot the messenger," right?
we're not going to shoot you.
boys, prepare your things.
we are going to America.
to get our recipe!
hasta la vista, messenger boy.
up your nose mit the rubber hose!
I don't really have a move except this one.
are you out?
finish your beer, asshole.
asshole!
asshole! Asshole! Asshole!
eat that tomato in one bite, asshole.
asshole! Asshole! Asshole!
good job, asshole. - Oh, no.
where you going? - Get out of here.
I don't got room in my pocket for more of your money.
I got a little spunk for you.
you couldn't hit your own ball bag with your own wrinkled cock.
chance.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. You play rim rules?
doesn't everybody?
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.
hold on there, girlfriend.
you're gonna chance...
...you're gonna have to earn it.
Oh, no. No way.
forget about it. I'm out of here. Where's my...?
Hey. You said you wanted to chance, now take a chance.
all right, all right.
son of a bitch!
up yours, Johnny Cash.
okay. Grab him, boys.
you weren't trying to play me for a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?
beginner's luck.
you don't come into my place of business and take my money like that.
now, what I should do is beat seven shades of shit out of you.
but I'll teach you something somebody... - Hey!
what's going on down here?
Todd, welcome home!
I'm just having some fun with your younger, dumber brother.
might not be the best time. Everyone's waiting.
Oh, of course.
Padre?
I'll come back for the rest.
great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.
my friends...
...as we gather today to mourn the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...
...what can I say that Johan can't say for himself?
Hello, all.
if you are watching this, then I have croaked.
now I will never know what happens on The Young and the Restless.
he loved that show. - But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...
... for what you have added to my long and happy life.
most of all, my mother.
mother, I always knew you would outlive me.
I loved you.
Prosit.
Todd Jan, my smart and talented grandsons...
... take good care of the restaurant.
it is the last piece of your heritage.
and don't worry, someone will be watching over you.
Hey. It's Popo. - Popo was given to me...
prosit!
and finally, to me.
looking good down there.
say good night, Popo.
good night, Popo.
for hundreds of years, it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...
...to spread the ashes of our loved ones in Munich.
I am too old. I want you boys to go to Germany...
...and carry out this tradition for your grandfather.
sure, it would be an honor for us, Great Gam Gam. When?
well, you must leave immediately.
the tradition is to spread the ashes...
...during the festival on the Theresienwiese.
there you will meet a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
he will take you to the family resting place.
the festival begins this week.
the festival of the what-what?
Oh, boys, you know this festival as Oktoberfest.
we're in.
we really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen and spread Grandpa's ashes.
he's supposed to meet us here.
so there's nothing we can do but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?
come on, guys.
are you making fun of us, mate?
what? No.
we're singing the beloved drinking songs of our country...
...and you sing us that bloody Jingo Jango?
I reckon you're taking the piss out of Oktoberfest.
we're just singing.
what do you think, mate?
I think we should fucking brain them.
Hey, we love Oktober...
hot cheese soup!
hot cheese so...!
come on. This is the Fr? Uleins Gone Wild!
just kiss each other, ja?
helmut, my God, are you okay?
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!
let's get the bastards!
so this is Oktoberfest.
Yeah.
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
Hi! - Let's go.
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here. There's some crazy...
gotcha. - Hey!
he's got me! - He's gone crazy dingo.
make fast! Make very fast!
split! Split!
where are we going, Mr. Spiedelspackel?
Schniedelwichsen. Come.
halt. See, we're here.
the ashes. We left them back at that tent.
we gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.
come. Come now.
we in the right neighborhood?
Oh, hello, blondie.
you care for a dance?
leave my brother alone.
I miss you!
the password!
drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
they're playing Quarters!
Hey, Beer Pong!
upside-down Chugs!
come! Come in here.
I'd bugger her for a game of soldiers, huh?
hello. Pim Scutney. This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.
team England.
I am Jan Wolfhouse and this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.
and what is this?
Beerfest, innit!
is this part of Oktoberfest?
oktoberfest is for tossers and sheep-shaggers.
Beerfest is our lives.
the ultimate test of a beer-gamer's mettle!
Where's the American team? - Yeah.
that's worth a squirt, innit? - What?
excuse me, guys.
please vomit in proper receptacles!
wait a second. Look at those urns over there.
they look just like Grandpa's.
that's why Schniedelwasher brought us here.
we're supposed to put Grandpa's urn up there with those.
we gotta go back and get it.
you go. I'm never leaving this place.
das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!
Hello, guvnor!
we got ourselves a tie.
you see them blokes in the knickers?
that's the German team, the champs.
their family owns the oldest brewery in Bavaria.
they're regular diamond geezers, they are, right?
why does the last guy chug out of a shoe?
that's no shoe!
that's Das Boot!
and she's a cruel old mistress, she is.
drink up, Hansel!
wow, they're fast!
das Boot!
das Boot! Das Boot!
von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.
your last name's Von Wolfhausen?
get the fuck out of here. So is ours! Wolfhouse.
we're cousins? Oh, this just gets better and better!
we must be related through our grandfather, Johan Von Wolfhausen.
why are you taking him? Where's he going?
we kind of need to stick close.
he is of no concern to you. - But he was just walking us through. He...
you do not speak of Beerfest outside of Beerfest!
you do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.
but our grandfather was Johan Von Wolf...
your grandfather was no Von Wolfhausen.
your grandfather was a thieving bastard stable boy.
what did you say? - Baron Ludwig Von Wolfhausen...
...our great-grandfather, the most legendary brewmeister in all Deutschland.
he perfected the Von Wolfhausen beer recipe.
it was the greatest beer in all the world.
when Ludwig died, your grandfather stole the only copy of the recipe created.
hold on a second. Our grandfather didn't brew beer.
he had this little sausage house in Colorado. He couldn't...
he could und he did.
he stole our recipe und fled Germany with his mother...
...a common Bavarian...
what's the English word I'm looking for?
whore.
Gam Gam a whore?
obviously there's a translation problem here.
hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.
now you're crossing the line. - No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!
und now, instead of having Deutschland's greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.
ja, we are not your cousins.
you are the offspring of the bastard son of some whore!
don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not! - Punch me! Do it!
ja, you big tough guy. Kill me, come on.
do it now! Kill me. What are you waiting for?
typical Americans. This is why we don't allow you in our Beerfest.
you get a few drinks in you und you become the Dirty Harry.
you should go back to your strip malls and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.
und then you can punch each other silly.
okay. Okay.
okay. Sounds like you guys fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?
ja, maybe a little. I think we just beat the Irish, so...
Oh, that's good. The champions. What? - Well, I'll tell you what.
why don't you pick your best two? Because you just opened up a can of corn.
corn.
we are laughing. We are laughing at you.
our best two? You want our best two? - The corn.
how about our worst two, right? Hammacher! Schlemmer!
you take the big guy. I'll get the little one.
you ready, du kleiner Hosenschei? Er?
everyone at once. First team to finish wins. On my word.
let's do this. - Ja, do it.
Hey, boys, why don't you let us put a nipple on that for you?
I remember my first beer.
Prosit.
allow me to introduce our grandfather:
take a good look...
...for this is a real Von Wolfhausen.
grandpapa.
Oh, shit.
so you are the progeny of Johan.
I am guessing that he is the one who taught you how to drink beer.
now...
...where is our recipe?
what fucking recipe?
friends...
...this is all that remains of a thieving stable boy...
...who ran away to America with his whore mother!
I'm a sucker for family reunions.
here are a couple of euros.
go back and get a BJ from your great-grandma, on me.
now get out of here.
BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!
they called Grandpa a thief and Gam Gam a whore!
we gotta go back. We gotta go back and beat those guys.
Oh, come on, man, that's crazy. - Is it? We can do this.
we can do what?
great Gam Gam.
mein boys. Oh, willkommen.
honey, what happened to your eye?
I accidentally walked into a wall. Yeah, the Berlin Wall.
I'll tell Tippy to get some cold pig stomach.
we put that on Janny's eye.
so tell me, was the ceremony beautiful?
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.
was it a peaceful resting place?
have you ever been to the family resting place?
no, but I've been told it is wonderful.
quiet, lovely. - Yeah.
and how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?
Oh, he's fine. Great guy. - Yeah. Good.
he says hi.
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.
now your grandpapa can rest in peace.
she couldn't be more not a whore.
we're gonna defend her honor.
we're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!
we're gonna put together our own team! - Yes.
we'll get the biggest drinkers, the best beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.
then we're gonna go back and kick the tar out of those Krauts!
that's my brother! God, I missed you.
Beerfest it is.
they want a war?
we'll give them a war they won't believe.
so how'd you find him?
some dude, used to work with him at the brewery.
haven't seen him since Hands Across America.
Oh, that's right.
I heard that when the brewery gave him his pink slip, he killed a guy.
I heard that too.
there he is.
you got nothing, baby. I got everything!
you got nothing! You got nothing!
we're gonna win this thing.
can I have your autograph?
Oh, no autographs, kids.
no, no, no. Thanks anyway. Get you next time.
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
I haven't seen you guys since... Hands Across America?
we were just saying that.
we almost made it. Couple breaks in the chain, right?
what's going on? You disappeared for a while.
we heard you got fired from the brewery.
goddamn brewery!
they brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.
I drink 45 off the assembly line, and I'm the asshole.
Jim Tobleson said they called in a hostage negotiator.
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.
I did my three years up at the county pen.
made some friends, went Muslim. Now I'm out, praise Allah.
I heard that someone died that day.
Yeah, somebody did die that day.
me.
I had the greatest job in the world, brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.
not to mention all the beer you could drink, right?
they took it away from me.
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get that feeling back again.
what?
there he is.
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...
big round of applause, people.
you want that geek?
what's he gonna do, check my urine?
I met Finkelstein back in college.
he was a real brainiac, that nerd.
studied everything about everything. Including beer.
so shut the fuck up.
what are you doing? Put the frog on the table.
clean out the floxinator or something, all right?
people, listen up. Use your thumbs.
locate the seminal vesicle here, the ejaculatory ducts here.
then stroke it. Stroke it. Stroke it hard.
cup the gonads. If you don't cup the gonads...
Jan? Todd? What are you guys doing here?
Hey, smart coat. - Oh, thank you. It's rayon.
what are you doing?
we're extracting frog gamete for cloning trials.
you're jerking him off.
who's the hippo? - Phil Krundel.
the name's Landfill.
listen, Fink. We're putting together a drinking team.
there's a competition and we want you to be part of it.
come on. I'm really busy. - We're serious.
you don't understand. I'm a respected member of the scientific community.
sorry.
we can't do it without you, Fink. - No chance. I have a job.
I've got a house with a pool and a two-car garage. I got three Ph. D.s.
Hey! Don't do that!
I'm published in four journals. - What?
toad Load Weekly?
we need you, Fink. America needs you.
that sounds a little dramatic.
that's the part we haven't told you. We're competing against the Germans.
Germans?
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.
you got 15 minutes to tell me more.
can you move over, please? - I like to sit in the middle.
what am I supposed to do?
you have room. You're little.
you wanna sit on this side? - Fuck you.
Jan, who are we meeting out here?
Jan, who are we meeting out here? - Barry Badrinath.
what? No. - Who's Barry Badrinath?
I'm putting a team together. - Turn around.
who's Barry? - Don't worry.
who's Barry Badrinath? Who's Barry Badrinath?
will you shut the hell up? Shut up.
Barry Badrinath was the best beer-gamer ever.
best at Quarters, at Pong, best at everything.
we should put him on our team.
well, actually, Barry and Todd had a falling-out.
see, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend. - Yahtzee.
zip it, Fink. - Sorry.
just think about Gam Gam for a minute, all right?
is this guy really that good? - Yeah.
he's the best.
we should put him on our team, then.
there he is. - Where?
right there.
Oh, my God.
what happened to him?
all right. It's a regular hot-dog cart in here, huh?
all right, here's how it works.
one dollar to look at it. Two dollars to touch it.
three dollars to watch me touch it.
that's lots of nice-looking manhood.
back the fuck up, Antonio!
my dick!
my apologies.
five to touch it while I touch my toes.
six dollars to touch it while I touch your toe...
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?
Todd. And Fink.
Hey, looking good, Finky. - You too, Barry.
I wish I could give you a deal here, but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?
so it's $10 for a BJ, $ 12for an HJ, $15 for a ZJ.
what's a ZJ?
if you have to ask, big man, you can't afford it.
I got $4.
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.
move along, then. I got a mouth to feed.
Barry, wait.
Jan, hold on. That's not such a good idea.
there's this big beer-games competition.
we're putting a team together.
we want you. - Twenty-five bucks.
no, no, no. You'd be training with us over the next year.
thirty bucks? - Jan, forget it.
no, just show us some of the old coin tricks. Come on.
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.
no. Wait. - No?
clearly, you've fallen on hard times.
this would be a chance to get back to the glory days.
it's a chance to show you still got it. You still got it, right?
you bet your ass I do.
show them.
watch and learn, baby diapers.
just like college.
it's nothing to worry about. He's shaking the cobwebs off.
I got it. I got it.
all right, here we go.
a little sticky on the - Yeah.
this guy blows. - Come on. You can do it.
glasses, maybe. I...
what are you looking at?
Barry, what happened to you?
get out of here! Get out of here!
get out of here! - Barry, Barry...
get out of here! - Help! Help!
so, what about Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?
he'd down a beer ball with every meal.
he's no good. He had that Al Roker surgery.
he went black?
don't be a moron. He got his stomach stapled.
most he can fit are two Triscuits and a glass of water.
Really?
Oh, boy.
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.
forget about it. You're done. You don't have any more, Badrinath.
Oh, yeah?
he's got a gun!
unbelievable!
that's incredible.
I'm better when I'm drunk.
I'll say. - Of course. So is everybody.
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!
get them in there. - All right!
well, boys, if we're gonna train...
...we're gonna need a training facility!
it's perfect!
it's amazing!
look at the size of this graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!
a direct-draw beer dispenser.
Half-barrel capacity, with an anti-foaming mechanism.
these are really the coins?
Hey. I think I found us a creepy new mascot.
Yeah, fuck it. Yeah, give it a rim job.
don't. That belonged to our grandpa.
sorry.
listen up, fellas.
the next 11 months are gonna be tough.
as tough as anything you've ever done.
we're gonna drink beer. And a lot of it.
if anybody here isn't up to it...
...I'm gonna give you one last chance to walk out that door.
that's a good one, Todd. - Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
because in this silver slice of heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.
golden, delicious beer.
and no one leaves here until we finish every single last drop.
all right, let's have the keys.
all you guys. You too, big boy. - Don't lose these.
all right, Fink, hit me.
sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.
Hey, Barry, how about a little warm-up match?
good one. But I'll leave the practicing to the amateurs.
all right, guys, let's focus, huh? Huddle up.
all right!
guys, those Germans are incredible drinkers.
better than anything I've ever seen.
now, Fink, they've got this thing called The Boot.
there's a secret way to drink it. I don't know what it is.
you'll have to figure that out for us. - You got it, Hot Toddy.
one more thing, I cannot stress this enough, people.
this is a super-secret competition. You cannot tell anybody about this.
or else what?
the guy that brought us there, they killed him.
but let's not worry about that now.
let's drink some beer! - Yeah!
all right! - Yeah, cheers!
ice cold.
anyone else's cold? - Really cold.
drinking and dancing at the same time. That's what's making it tough.
thought there might be a bug in there.
my teeth hurt, it's so cold. That's what makes me have to stop a bit.
how many beers in this thing? - About 125 beers, yeah.
a hundred and twenty-five?
might have a cavity here.
you're dead, bitch. - Oh, yeah?
remember we made Fudgsicles out of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?
eight points.
these big ones have a different flight pattern.
nobody said it was gonna be easy.
that shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.
it's great motivation. A reminder of the humiliation.
I wouldn't mind having it while training.
okay.
you are a good friend.
all right, here we go.
Oh, yeah.
I know you love it, Muscle Lips. Let's go.
lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.
sorry.
get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.
don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke, you goyim schmendrik miskayt.
I don't know why you're here. You can't drink beer.
I'll show you how to drink a beer, motherfucker.
Hey, I think somebody's trying to chug in my face!
look out, Germans!
you got chutzpah, Fuckelstein.
that's great. - Hey, Todd.
about the old girlfriend thing. Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?
I don't know. - It was just a one-night stand, right?
wasn't even that good-looking. Real dead fish, right?
I mean, she just laid there, taking it like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?
I happen to have married that plastic fuck doll!
Todd, no!
Hey! Get off him!
someone's chewing my leg!
I hate you, Badrinath!
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.
Oh, my God.
Hello? Yes.
we need an ambulance immediately at 622 Francis Drive.
come on, Phil. Stay with me, honey.
Oh, my God, what is that?
ham.
not again.
how'd we do?
not good.
if we're gonna drink like the Germans, I think we're gonna need a little help.
you don't have to yell.
don't say anything to Great Gam Gam about the competition.
don't talk about her being a whore.
she's a whore? - No, she's not a whore.
so what if she was a whore? - She's not.
I'm just saying, some of my best friends are whores.
Yeah, we know.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.
can I help you? - Who are you?
my name's Cherry.
is everything okay? - Everything is fine.
great Gam Gam.
cherry is here to help me now that my Johan is gone.
mein darling great-grandboys...
...and their delicious-looking friends.
come in.
and summer sausage.
just came out of the refrigerator.
here, try this. Oh, no, wait. Here, let me warm it up for you.
no, that's fine. We're okay.
when we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed that the Germans were excellent drinkers.
Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing. - How do they get good?
well, from the time that they are little kids...
...Germans are raised to be excellent beer drinkers.
how? - Well, for one thing...
...they train high up in the Alps.
interesting. High-altitude training. Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.
they are also taught to relax the muscles of the throat.
Germans can pretty much stick anything down there.
I myself can probably fit in at least... Oh, at least nine inches.
here, let me show you. - No. You don't have to demonstrate.
what else do the Germans do?
they also practice by drinking the urine of a ram.
the what? - They drink ram's piss.
because of the pH balance? - No.
because if you can drink ram's piss, fuck, you can drink almost anything.
she said "fuck." - Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?
no, I was saying it was a tradition back in the old country.
damn, that's nasty. The old country must have been fucked up.
now, come on, baby, it's time for your nap.
come on. - Okay. Well...
see you boys later.
I always sleep better when I have a little sausage in me.
look, if you ask me...
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing is a real possibility.
bavarians have been warming sausages like that for hundreds of years.
would you say it's their oldest profession?
shut up, Landfill.
all right, but more importantly, where are we gonna find a ram?
I'm gonna fucking puke.
that's the most disgusting thing I've ever drank.
I doubt that, playboy.
Oh, God, is there anything better?
not right now.
you know, fellas, maybe training alone on a rooftop...
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.
maybe we should get out there and mix it up with some randoms, you know?
smart idea, college boy. - Go test our mettle.
Yeah, challenge somebody. Challenge ourselves.
let's get bombed!
Yeah!
Hey. Who ordered the Queer Eye makeover?
we're the party brigade.
we're here to play some drinking games.
drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.
you've gotta drink.
I've got one.
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.
my turn. I never fooled around with Coach Gerber.
this one's called the Strikeout.
what you're gonna do is take a hit...
...chug your beer, do a shot, then blow out the smoke.
here goes nothing.
careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.
that's not bad at all.
"Strikeout," right?
that's nothing.
don't...
...really, however, see what...
...all the...
...fuss is about.
Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein. - Do I know you?
Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy. - Hey, Jerry.
while I have you here, you forgot my Sunday supplement last week.
wake up, Finky. Wake up.
cops, cops, cops!
dude, aren't you like 40?
I'm 33.
Hey, what the hell?
help!
what a great morning.
night, ladies.
night, Todd. - Bye, Todd.
say hi to the missus.
all right, guys, come on.
one, two, three. - Go.
my glasses!
two, three, go.
maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.
he's so strict.
Hey, Finky...
...how you doing with The Boot? - Not there yet.
I have figured out the problem, I just don't know the solution yet.
check this out.
Hey, fellas, gather up.
here's the thing.
when you drink, the shape of the boot causes an air bubble to form in the toe.
the bubble.
this air bubble shoots around the heel...
...and explodes towards your face while drinking.
in your face, it explodes.
it's impossible to handle. - It's impossible to handle.
it's unavoidable. The Germans know how.
I find the whole thing frustrating because I can't figure it out.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating. It's frustrat...
can you get the puppet off of me?!
Hey, it's Popo. - Sorry.
you knocked his head off.
wait, wait. There's something in there.
Hey, what is that?
looks like it's German. - Aren't you guys German?
Yeah, so? - Give me that.
I used to work on a German cruise ship.
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.
Really? - What recipe?
must be the old German beer recipe.
those Germans said our grandfather stole their family recipe.
lf he had it, why didn't he brew it? - Hebrew?
maybe he didn't know it was in here. - It supposed to be good?
if this is the recipe, this used to be Germany's greatest beer.
okay, we want three cups.
that's right. Good.
pour it on in, pour it on in.
okay, good. Let's have a little...
how is it, Jan? - Tell us.
it's...
it's beautiful.
it's magical. - It's laughing at me.
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.
I wanna put my dick in it. - I want it to put its dick in me.
I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice and skate on it.
then melt it in the springtime and drink it.
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?
this means Gam Gam really was a whore.
it is good, it is good.
I can't serve it fast enough.
Hey, buddy. - Go with God.
Hey, Wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.
nice bottle. - Hey, Landfill.
look at this guy! He's getting better.
dude, you want a Schnitz?
do you want a tip with that?
Yeah.
good one.
give me six Schnitzes. - What the doctor ordered.
drink, drink, drink!
good, good, good.
special delivery!
I have this special delivery for Herr Baron.
can't you see we are training?
I am so sorry, but this package comes all the way from America, ja...
...and look, it is marked: "Most urgent."
what is it, Grandpapa?
they have the recipe.
who else knows of this package? - Absolutely no one.
only me. It's just me.
dispose of him. - Wait!
no, no, no! What about "Don't shoot the messenger," right?
we're not going to shoot you.
boys, prepare your things.
we are going to America.
to get our recipe!
hasta la vista, messenger boy.
up your nose mit the rubber hose!
I don't really have a move except this one.
are you out?
finish your beer, asshole.
you've got spunk, Wolfhouse. I'll give you that.
I don't got room in my pocket for more of your money.
I got a little spunk for you.
you couldn't hit your own ball bag with your own wrinkled cock.
chance.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. You play rim rules?
doesn't everybody?
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.
hold on there, girlfriend.
you're gonna chance...
...you're gonna have to earn it.
Oh, no. No way.
forget about it. I'm out of here. Where's my...?
Hey. You said you wanted to chance, now take a chance.
all right, all right.
son of a bitch!
up yours, Johnny Cash.
okay. Grab him, boys.
you weren't trying to play me for a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?
beginner's luck.
you don't come into my place of business and take my money like that.
now, what I should do is beat seven shades of shit out of you.
but I'll teach you something somebody... - Hey!
what's going on down here?
Todd, welcome home!
I'm just having some fun with your younger, dumber brother.
might not be the best time. Everyone's waiting.
Oh, of course.
Padre?
I'll come back for the rest.
great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.
my friends...
...as we gather today to mourn the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...
...what can I say that Johan can't say for himself?
Hello, all.
if you are watching this, then I have croaked.
now I will never know what happens on The Young and the Restless.
he loved that show. - But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...
... for what you have added to my long and happy life.
most of all, my mother.
mother, I always knew you would outlive me.
I loved you.
Prosit.
Todd, Jan, my smart and talented grandsons...
... take good care of the restaurant.
it is the last piece of your heritage.
and don't worry, someone will be watching over you.
Hey. It's Popo. - Popo was given to me...
prosit!
and finally, to me.
looking good down there.
say good night, Popo.
good night, Popo.
for hundreds of years, it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...
...to spread the ashes of our loved ones in Munich.
I am too old. I want you boys to go to Germany...
...and carry out this tradition for your grandfather.
sure, it would be an honor for us, Great Gam Gam. When?
well, you must leave immediately.
the tradition is to spread the ashes...
...during the festival on the Theresienwiese.
there you will meet a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
he will take you to the family resting place.
the festival begins this week.
the festival of the what-what?
Oh, boys, you know this festival as Oktoberfest.
we're in.
we really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen and spread Grandpa's ashes.
he's supposed to meet us here.
so there's nothing we can do but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?
come on, guys.
are you making fun of us, mate?
what? No.
we're singing the beloved drinking songs of our country...
...and you sing us that bloody jingo jango?
I reckon you're taking the piss out of Oktoberfest.
we're just singing.
what do you think, mate?
I think we should fucking brain them.
Hey, we love Oktober...
hot cheese soup!
hot cheese so...!
come on. This is the Fr? Uleins Gone Wild!
just kiss each other, ja?
helmut, my God, are you okay?
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!
let's get the bastards!
so this is Oktoberfest.
Yeah.
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
Hi! - Let's go.
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here. There's some crazy...
gotcha. - Hey!
he's got me! - He's gone crazy dingo.
make fast! Make very fast!
split! Split!
where are we going, Mr. Spiedelspackel?
Schniedelwichsen. Come.
halt. See, we're here.
the ashes. We left them back at that tent.
we gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.
come. Come now.
we in the right neighborhood?
Oh, hello, blondie.
you care for a dance?
leave my brother alone.
I miss you!
the password!
drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
they're playing Quarters!
Hey, Beer Pong!
upside-down Chugs!
come! Come in here.
I'd bugger her for a game of soldiers, huh?
hello. Pim Scutney. This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.
team England.
I am Jan Wolfhouse and this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.
and what is this?
Beerfest, innit!
is this part of Oktoberfest?
oktoberfest is for tossers and sheep-shaggers.
Beerfest is our lives.
the ultimate test of a beer-gamer's mettle!
Where's the American team? - Yeah.
that's worth a squirt, innit? - What?
excuse me, guys.
please vomit in proper receptacles!
wait a second. Look at those urns over there.
they look just like Grandpa's.
that's why Schniedelwasher brought us here.
we're supposed to put Grandpa's urn up there with those.
we gotta go back and get it.
you go. I'm never leaving this place.
das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!
Hello, guvnor!
we got ourselves a tie.
you see them blokes in the knickers?
that's the German team, the champs.
their family owns the oldest brewery in Bavaria.
they're regular diamond geezers, they are, right?
why does the last guy chug out of a shoe?
that's no shoe!
that's Das Boot!
and she's a cruel old mistress, she is.
drink up, Hansel!
wow, they're fast!
das Boot!
das Boot! Das Boot!
von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.
your last name's Von Wolfhausen?
get the fuck out of here. So is ours! Wolfhouse.
we're cousins? Oh, this just gets better and better!
we must be related through our grandfather, Johan Von Wolfhausen.
why are you taking him? Where's he going?
we kind of need to stick close.
he is of no concern to you. - But he was just walking us through. He...
you do not speak of Beerfest outside of Beerfest!
you do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.
but our grandfather was Johan Von Wolf...
your grandfather was no Von Wolfhausen.
your grandfather was a thieving bastard stable boy.
what did you say? - Baron Ludwig Von Wolfhausen...
...our great-grandfather, the most legendary brewmeister in all Deutschland.
he perfected the Von Wolfhausen beer recipe.
it was the greatest beer in all the world.
when Ludwig died, your grandfather stole the only copy of the recipe created.
hold on a second. Our grandfather didn't brew beer.
he had this little sausage house in Colorado. He couldn't...
he could und he did.
he stole our recipe und fled Germany with his mother...
...a common Bavarian...
what's the English word I'm looking for?
whore.
Gam Gam a whore?
obviously there's a translation problem here.
hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.
now you're crossing the line. - No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!
und now, instead of having Deutschland's greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.
ja, we are not your cousins.
you are the offspring of the bastard son of some whore!
don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not! - Punch me! Do it!
ja, you big tough guy. Kill me, come on.
do it now! Kill me. What are you waiting for?
typical Americans. This is why we don't allow you in our Beerfest.
you get a few drinks in you und you become the Dirty Harry.
you should go back to your strip malls and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.
und then you can punch each other silly.
okay. Okay.
okay. Sounds like you guys fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?
ja, maybe a little. I think we just beat the Irish, so...
Oh, that's good. The champions. What? - Well, I'll tell you what.
why don't you pick your best two? Because you just opened up a can of corn.
corn.
we are laughing. We are laughing at you.
our best two? You want our best two? - The corn.
how about our worst two, right? Hammacher! Schlemmer!
you take the big guy. I'll get the little one.
you ready, du kleiner Hosenschei? Er?
everyone at once. First team to finish wins. On my word.
let's do this. - Ja, do it.
Hey, boys, why don't you let us put a nipple on that for you?
I remember my first beer.
Prosit.
allow me to introduce our grandfather:
take a good look...
...for this is a real Von Wolfhausen.
grandpapa.
Oh, shit.
so you are the progeny of Johan.
I am guessing that he is the one who taught you how to drink beer.
now...
...where is our recipe?
what fucking recipe?
friends...
...this is all that remains of a thieving stable boy...
...who ran away to America with his whore mother!
I'm a sucker for family reunions.
here are a couple of euros.
go back and get a BJ from your great-grandma, on me.
now get out of here.
BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!
they called Grandpa a thief and Gam Gam a whore!
we gotta go back. We gotta go back and beat those guys.
Oh, come on, man, that's crazy. - Is it? We can do this.
we can do what?
great Gam Gam.
mein boys. Oh, willkommen.
honey, what happened to your eye?
I accidentally walked into a wall. Yeah, the Berlin Wall.
I'll tell Tippy to get some cold pig stomach.
we put that on Janny's eye.
so tell me, was the ceremony beautiful?
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.
was it a peaceful resting place?
have you ever been to the family resting place?
no, but I've been told it is wonderful.
quiet, lovely. - Yeah.
and how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?
Oh, he's fine. Great guy. - Yeah. Good.
he says hi.
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.
now your grandpapa can rest in peace.
she couldn't be more not a whore.
we're gonna defend her honor.
we're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!
we're gonna put together our own team! - Yes.
we'll get the biggest drinkers, the best beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.
then we're gonna go back and kick the tar out of those Krauts!
that's my brother! God, I missed you.
Beerfest it is.
they want a war?
we'll give them a war they won't believe.
so how'd you find him?
some dude, used to work with him at the brewery.
haven't seen him since Hands Across America.
Oh, that's right.
I heard that when the brewery gave him his pink slip, he killed a guy.
I heard that too.
there he is.
you got nothing, baby. I got everything!
you got nothing! You got nothing!
we're gonna win this thing.
can I have your autograph?
Oh, no autographs, kids.
no, no, no. Thanks anyway. Get you next time.
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
I haven't seen you guys since... Hands Across America?
we were just saying that.
we almost made it. Couple breaks in the chain, right?
what's going on? You disappeared for a while.
we heard you got fired from the brewery.
goddamn brewery!
they brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.
I drink 45 off the assembly line, and I'm the asshole.
Jim Tobleson said they called in a hostage negotiator.
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.
I did my three years up at the county pen.
made some friends, went Muslim. Now I'm out, praise Allah.
I heard that someone died that day.
Yeah, somebody did die that day.
me.
I had the greatest job in the world, brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.
not to mention all the beer you could drink, right?
they took it away from me.
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get that feeling back again.
what?
there he is.
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...
big round of applause, people.
you want that geek?
what's he gonna do, check my urine?
I met Finkelstein back in college.
he was a real brainiac, that nerd.
studied everything about everything. Including beer.
so shut the fuck up.
what are you doing? Put the frog on the table.
clean out the floxinator or something, all right?
people, listen up. Use your thumbs.
locate the seminal vesicle here, the ejaculatory ducts here.
then stroke it. Stroke it. Stroke it hard.
cup the gonads. If you don't cup the gonads...
Jan? Todd? What are you guys doing here?
Hey, smart coat. - Oh, thank you. It's rayon.
what are you doing?
we're extracting frog gamete for cloning trials.
you're jerking him off.
who's the hippo? - Phil Krundel.
the name's Landfill.
listen, Fink. We're putting together a drinking team.
there's a competition and we want you to be part of it.
come on. I'm really busy. - We're serious.
you don't understand. I'm a respected member of the scientific community.
sorry.
we can't do it without you, Fink. - No chance. I have a job.
I've got a house with a pool and a two-car garage. I got three Ph. D.s.
Hey! Don't do that!
I'm published in four journals. - What?
toad Load Weekly?
we need you, Fink. America needs you.
that sounds a little dramatic.
that's the part we haven't told you. We're competing against the Germans.
Germans?
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.
you got 15 minutes to tell me more.
can you move over, please? - I like to sit in the middle.
what am I supposed to do?
you have room. You're little.
you wanna sit on this side? - Fuck you.
Jan, who are we meeting out here?
Jan, who are we meeting out here? - Barry Badrinath.
what? No. - Who's Barry Badrinath?
I'm putting a team together. - Turn around.
who's Barry? - Don't worry.
who's Barry Badrinath? Who's Barry Badrinath?
will you shut the hell up? Shut up.
Barry Badrinath was the best beer-gamer ever.
best at Quarters, at Pong, best at everything.
we should put him on our team.
well, actually, Barry and Todd had a falling-out.
see, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend. - Yahtzee.
zip it, Fink. - Sorry.
just think about Gam Gam for a minute, all right?
is this guy really that good? - Yeah.
he's the best.
we should put him on our team, then.
there he is. - Where?
right there.
Oh, my God.
what happened to him?
all right. It's a regular hot-dog cart in here, huh?
all right, here's how it works.
one dollar to look at it. Two dollars to touch it.
three dollars to watch me touch it.
that's lots of nice-looking manhood.
back the fuck up, Antonio!
my dick!
my apologies.
five to touch it while I touch my toes.
six dollars to touch it while I touch your toe...
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?
Todd. And Fink.
Hey, looking good, Finky. - You too, Barry.
I wish I could give you a deal here, but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?
so it's $ 10 for a BJ, $ 12 for an HJ, $ 15 for a ZJ.
what's a ZJ?
if you have to ask, big man, you can't afford it.
I got $4.
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.
move along, then. I got a mouth to feed.
Barry, wait.
Jan, hold on. That's not such a good idea.
there's this big beer-games competition.
we're putting a team together.
we want you. - Twenty-five bucks.
no, no, no. You'd be training with us over the next year.
thirty bucks? - Jan, forget it.
no, just show us some of the old coin tricks. Come on.
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.
no. Wait. - No?
clearly, you've fallen on hard times.
this would be a chance to get back to the glory days.
it's a chance to show you still got it. You still got it, right?
you bet your ass I do.
show them.
watch and learn, baby diapers.
just like college.
it's nothing to worry about. He's shaking the cobwebs off.
I got it. I got it.
all right, here we go.
a little sticky on the - Yeah.
this guy blows. - Come on. You can do it.
glasses, maybe. I...
what are you looking at?
Barry, what happened to you?
get out of here! Get out of here!
get out of here! - Barry, Barry...
get out of here! - Help! Help!
so, what about Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?
he'd down a beer ball with every meal.
he's no good. He had that Al Roker surgery.
he went black?
don't be a moron. He got his stomach stapled.
most he can fit are two Triscuits and a glass of water.
Really?
Oh, boy.
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.
forget about it. You're done. You don't have any more, Badrinath.
Oh, yeah?
he's got a gun!
unbelievable!
that's incredible.
I'm better when I'm drunk.
I'll say. - Of course. So is everybody.
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!
get them in there. - All right!
well, boys, if we're gonna train...
...we're gonna need a training facility!
it's perfect!
it's amazing!
look at the size of this graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!
a direct-draw beer dispenser.
Half-barrel capacity, with an anti-foaming mechanism.
these are really the coins?
Hey. I think I found us a creepy new mascot.
Yeah, fuck it. Yeah, give it a rim job.
don't. That belonged to our grandpa.
sorry.
listen up, fellas.
the next 11 months are gonna be tough.
as tough as anything you've ever done.
we're gonna drink beer. And a lot of it.
if anybody here isn't up to it...
...I'm gonna give you one last chance to walk out that door.
that's a good one, Todd. - Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
because in this silver slice of heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.
golden, delicious beer.
and no one leaves here until we finish every single last drop.
all right, let's have the keys.
all you guys. You too, big boy. - Don't lose these.
all right, Fink, hit me.
sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.
Hey, Barry, how about a little warm-up match?
good one. But I'll leave the practicing to the amateurs.
all right, guys, let's focus, huh? Huddle up.
all right!
guys, those Germans are incredible drinkers.
better than anything I've ever seen.
now, Fink, they've got this thing called The Boot.
there's a secret way to drink it. I don't know what it is.
you'll have to figure that out for us. - You got it, Hot Toddy.
one more thing, I cannot stress this enough, people.
this is a super-secret competition. You cannot tell anybody about this.
or else what?
the guy that brought us there, they killed him.
but let's not worry about that now.
let's drink some beer! - Yeah!
all right! - Yeah, cheers!
ice cold.
anyone else's cold? - Really cold.
drinking and dancing at the same time. That's what's making it tough.
thought there might be a bug in there.
my teeth hurt, it's so cold. That's what makes me have to stop a bit.
how many beers in this thing? - About 125 beers, yeah.
a hundred and twenty-five?
might have a cavity here.
you're dead, bitch. - Oh, yeah?
remember we made Fudgsicles out of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?
eight points.
these big ones have a different flight pattern.
nobody said it was gonna be easy.
that shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.
it's great motivation. A reminder of the humiliation.
I wouldn't mind having it while training.
okay.
you are a good friend.
all right, here we go.
Oh, yeah.
I know you love it, Muscle Lips. Let's go.
lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.
sorry.
get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.
don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke, you goyim schmendrik miskayt.
I don't know why you're here. You can't drink beer.
I'll show you how to drink a beer, motherfucker.
Hey, I think somebody's trying to chug in my face!
look out, Germans!
you got chutzpah, Fuckelstein.
that's great. - Hey, Todd.
about the old girlfriend thing. Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?
I don't know. - It was just a one-night stand, right?
wasn't even that good-looking. Real dead fish, right?
I mean, she just laid there, taking it like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?
I happen to have married that plastic fuck doll!
Todd, no!
Hey! Get off him!
someone's chewing my leg!
I hate you, Badrinath!
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.
Oh, my God.
Hello? Yes.
we need an ambulance immediately at 622 Francis Drive.
come on, Phil. Stay with me, honey.
Oh, my God, what is that?
ham.
not again.
how'd we do?
not good.
if we're gonna drink like the Germans, I think we're gonna need a little help.
you don't have to yell.
don't say anything to Great Gam Gam about the competition.
don't talk about her being a whore.
she's a whore? - No, she's not a whore.
so what if she was a whore? - She's not.
I'm just saying, some of my best friends are whores.
Yeah, we know.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.
can I help you? - Who are you?
my name's Cherry.
is everything okay? - Everything is fine.
great Gam Gam.
cherry is here to help me now that my Johan is gone.
mein darling great-grandboys...
...and their delicious-looking friends.
come in.
and summer sausage.
just came out of the refrigerator.
here, try this. Oh, no, wait. Here, let me warm it up for you.
no, that's fine. We're okay.
when we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed that the Germans were excellent drinkers.
Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing. - How do they get good?
well, from the time that they are little kids...
...Germans are raised to be excellent beer drinkers.
how? - Well, for one thing...
...they train high up in the Alps.
interesting. High-altitude training. Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.
they are also taught to relax the muscles of the throat.
Germans can pretty much stick anything down there.
I myself can probably fit in at least... Oh, at least nine inches.
here, let me show you. - No. You don't have to demonstrate.
what else do the Germans do?
they also practice by drinking the urine of a ram.
the what? - They drink ram's piss.
because of the pH balance? - No.
because if you can drink ram's piss, fuck, you can drink almost anything.
she said "fuck." - Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?
no, I was saying it was a tradition back in the old country.
damn, that's nasty. The old country must have been fucked up.
now, come on, baby, it's time for your nap.
come on. - Okay. Well...
see you boys later.
I always sleep better when I have a little sausage in me.
look, if you ask me...
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing is a real possibility.
bavarians have been warming sausages like that for hundreds of years.
would you say it's their oldest profession?
shut up, Landfill.
all right, but more importantly, where are we gonna find a ram?
I'm gonna fucking puke.
that's the most disgusting thing I've ever drank.
I doubt that, playboy.
Oh, God, is there anything better?
not right now.
you know, fellas, maybe training alone on a rooftop...
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.
maybe we should get out there and mix it up with some randoms, you know?
smart idea, college boy. - Go test our mettle.
Yeah, challenge somebody. Challenge ourselves.
let's get bombed!
Yeah!
Hey. Who ordered the Queer Eye makeover?
we're the party brigade.
we're here to play some drinking games.
drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.
you've gotta drink.
I've got one.
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.
my turn. I never fooled around with Coach Gerber.
this one's called the Strikeout.
what you're gonna do is take a hit...
...chug your beer, do a shot, then blow out the smoke.
here goes nothing.
careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.
that's not bad at all.
"Strikeout," right?
that's nothing.
don't...
...really, however, see what...
...all the...
...fuss is about.
Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein. - Do I know you?
Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy. - Hey, Jerry.
while I have you here, you forgot my Sunday supplement last week.
wake up, Finky. Wake up.
cops, cops, cops!
dude, aren't you like 40?
I'm 33.
Hey, what the hell?
help!
what a great morning.
night, ladies.
night, Todd. - Bye, Todd.
say hi to the missus.
all right, guys, come on.
one, two, three. - Go.
my glasses!
two, three, go.
maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.
he's so strict.
Hey, Finky...
...how you doing with The Boot? - Not there yet.
I have figured out the problem, I just don't know the solution yet.
check this out.
Hey, fellas, gather up.
here's the thing.
when you drink, the shape of the boot causes an air bubble to form in the toe.
the bubble.
this air bubble shoots around the heel...
...and explodes towards your face while drinking.
in your face, it explodes.
it's impossible to handle. - It's impossible to handle.
it's unavoidable. The Germans know how.
I find the whole thing frustrating because I can't figure it out.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating.
it's frustrating. It's frustrat...
can you get the puppet off of me?!
Hey, it's Popo. - Sorry.
you knocked his head off.
wait, wait. There's something in there.
Hey, what is that?
looks like it's German. - Aren't you guys German?
Yeah, so? - Give me that.
I used to work on a German cruise ship.
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.
Really? - What recipe?
must be the old German beer recipe.
those Germans said our grandfather stole their family recipe.
lf he had it, why didn't he brew it? - Hebrew?
maybe he didn't know it was in here. - It supposed to be good?
if this is the recipe, this used to be Germany's greatest beer.
okay, we want three cups.
that's right. Good.
pour it on in, pour it on in.
okay, good. Let's have a little...
how is it, Jan? - Tell us.
it's...
it's beautiful.
it's magical. - It's laughing at me.
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.
I wanna put my dick in it. - I want it to put its dick in me.
I wish it were winter, we could make it into ice and skate on it.
then melt it in the springtime and drink it.
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?
this means Gam Gam really was a whore.
it is good, it is good.
I can't serve it fast enough.
Hey, buddy. - Go with God.
Hey, Wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.
nice bottle. - Hey, Landfill.
look at this guy! He's getting better.
dude, you want a Schnitz?
do you want a tip with that?
Yeah.
good one.
give me six Schnitzes. - What the doctor ordered.
drink, drink, drink!
good, good, good.
special delivery!
I have this special delivery for Herr Baron.
can't you see we are training?
I am so sorry, but this package comes all the way from America, ja...
...and look, it is marked: "Most urgent.
what is it, Grandpapa?
they have the recipe.
who else knows of this package? - Absolutely no one.
only me. It's just me.
dispose of him. - Wait!
no, no, no! What about "Don't shoot the messenger," right?
we're not going to shoot you.
boys, prepare your things.
we are going to America.
to get our recipe!
hasta la vista, messenger boy.
up your nose mit the rubber hose!
I don't really have a move except this one.
are you out?
finish your beer, asshole.
I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies.
I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all that I can.
crowd: Hel I, no, we won't go! Hell, no, we won't go!
mario SAVIO: There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious...
lyndon JOHNSON: I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
kennedy: Some very sad news for all of you, and, I think, uh, sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that, uh, - - Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.
Bobby SEALE: We're gonna say to the whole damn government: "Stick 'em up, mother .
man: Bobby Kennedy's the only white man in America I trust.
sheriff GALYEN: If I have reason to believe that there's gonna be a riot started, and somebody tells me that there's gonna be trouble if you don 't stop them, then it's my duty to stop them.
kennedy: Then you go out and arrest them?
Oh, absolutely.
how can you go arrest somebody if they haven't violated the law?
they're ready to violate the law.
in other words...
kennedy: Could I suggest in the luncheon period of time that the sheriff and the district attorney read the Constitution of the United States?
I don 't want to be part of the United States,
I don 't want to be part of the American people, and have them write of us as they wrote of Rome: "They made a desert, and they called it peace.
your generation, this generation, cannot afford to waste its substance and its hope in the struggles of the past.
for beyond these walls is a world to be helped and improved and made safe for the welfare of mankind.
do we know anything yet?
we got men on the sixth floor going from room to room. You the manager?
paul Ebbers. And the bungalows?
we're checking them now.
Roger that.
it's a false alarm. - False alarm.
I wouldn't want to be you today.
occupational hazard. We'll open the cafe.
you or your men want coffee, a hot breakfast, - it's on the house. - Thanks.
it'll take us a little while to wrap this up, but I'll let the boys know.
officer: We're gonna need to open a lane here for traffic.
false alarm.
Yeah. I didn't know you were in this early.
are you kidding?
have you seen my schedule for today?
man: Hey, Paul.
what the heck's going on here?
there's a hook and ladder keeping me from my first cup of coffee and crosswords.
don't you have a home, John?
well, this is my home, you know that.
retirement doesn't suit you, does it?
no, sir.
this is not the muscle tone of a retired man.
if it were up to me, John, you'd still be in uniform, still at that door.
Oh, that's great. Hold it.
okay, one more.
everybody smile.
woman: Thank you.
thank you.
you guys can put out my fire anytime.
and how are you, my baby?
we're gonna go back up to bed, aren't we?
man: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.
we are very sorry.
this has been a false alarm.
you are free to return to your rooms at this time or join us in one of our cafes for a complimentary breakfast.
and once again, on behalf of the...
Jack?
welcome to Los Angeles.
- Sir.
the polls are open in South Dakota, fellas.
let's go.
how long has it been since you've slept?
how long has it been since you've slept?
we bring home California, we'll all sleep a hell of a lot better.
Timmons.
: damn it. Damn it.
good morning, my brown brother. - Hey.
you know you're working a double, right?
how come everybody knows but me?
and that's the third time this week.
for once, I'd like to be asked, "Hey, Jose, would you mind working a double shift today? "
that'll never happen. - Why not?
because you're Mexican, that's why.
I'm Latino.
Latino?
jose, you're a fuckin' Mexican, okay?
call yourself what you will;
you're no different than the rest of us.
if you don't like the double shift, there's a hundred guys out there on the other side of that door that'll take your place like this.
and if it makes you feel any better...
I'm working a double shift, too, so...
we'll both be here until midnight.
I got tickets to see Drysdale pitch against Pittsburgh tonight.
is that right? - He's on a streak.
you know?
field level.
these are good tickets.
I was gonna take my dad.
he's never been to a game.
well, he ain't going to one tonight.
so, if I were you, I'd sell those tickets.
I can help you with that.
son of a bitch.
timmons, he doesn't show me the decency of the respect.
Yeah, you know why? - Why?
because you're Mexican.
and a busboy.
Hey, we're the new niggers, brother.
get used to it.
shit.
Latino.
well...
I missed all the excitement, I see.
Oh, it's not much to speak of.
well, it's the Ambassador Hotel.
people coming, people going.
nothing ever happens.
grand Hotel.
what about it?
it's a line from the old Greta Garbo movie, Grand Hotel.
okay, John.
ever seen Grand Hotel, Henry?
no, I haven't, Mr. Casey. - No, of course you didn't.
I have seen Bonnie and Clyde, though.
Ah, that's a good film.
have you seen Bonnie and Clyde, Nelson?
I saw it with you.
thank you, Henry. Have a good day.
thank you, Mr. Casey.
you know, I stood at that door from the first day the Ambassador opened back in 1921, and I greeted everyone: FDR, Truman, Eisenhower,
Jack Kennedy, Johnson, Premier Khrushchev, the Shah of Iran, King of Sweden, all of them.
Madame Chiang Kai-Shek... she rented the entire fifth floor.
I personally delivered the Oriental furniture to her suite.
it was antiques, mostly.
Oh, yes, and one night, I, uh,
I caught Will Rogers having a pee.
he was taking a piss in the greenhouse.
he tried to convince me it was good for the plants.
he said, "Good for the shrubbery, boy."
I said, "Don't do it again, sir."
and I also danced at the Grove when I was off duty with, uh, Barbara Stanwyck, believe it or not, and Dolores del Rio and Rita Hayworth.
I was quite a dancer.
she was a beautiful woman, mind you.
and I heard Bing Crosby sing at the Grove, too.
Yeah, and Sinatra, too, of course, and Rudy Vallee.
Sophie Tucker, Ruby Keeler.
Yeah, and Cab Calloway, I think.
Yes, sir. All good things in this hotel.
Yeah.
can I see the sports section?
man: Her boobs. I read about it somewhere.
man 2: Anne Bancroft is not gonna show her breasts in a film.
man: She's a good-looking lady, Coop.
coop: I'm not saying she's not a good-looking lady.
man: Oh, like you wouldn't, if you had the chance?
Anne Bancroft has too much class to show her breasts in a film.
that's it. That's the facts.
it's not just a film, Coop.
it's The Graduate.
woman: Mm, I love that movie.
more coffee? - Yes, please.
okay, so I have a question for you.
what do you think, Bancroft or body double?
the nude scenes? - Mm-hmm.
flashes. They're not even scenes.
body double. For sure.
wait. You know this for a fact?
well, no, but it's what I would do.
that is, if I ever actually got hired - for a movie I auditioned for. - You will. You will.
Plus, you're my favorite ingenue.
and you got a great smile, and you're nice to us, and you know how to pour coffee so well.
you know what? He actually thinks he knows what he's doing with that thing.
I do know what I'm doing with this thing.
no, you don't. - You look like a movie star.
Really? Who put it on 13 frames?
there you go. - Well, say a prayer for me, 'cause tomorrow I'm interviewing for Schwab's.
Oh, wow, good for you.
Schwabs, is that a director or producer or something?
no, moron, Schwab's on Sunset.
Lana Turner was discovered there.
Oh, Schwab's.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, every out-of-work actress in Hollywood is trying to get a gig there waiting the lunch counter.
well, good luck. - Thank you.
Hey, I guarantee you, if Hitchcock asked her to show her tits in a film, she'd do it in a heartbeat.
Daryl.
I'll call you back.
I do everything I can to make sure that the employees of this hotel are treated equally and fairly.
I'm getting complaints that you're not allowing the kitchen staff off work to vote today.
we're understaffed this week.
I've got six workers with the flu.
I've had to deny sick leave, too.
did you tell them they couldn't leave?
this is no small thing we're doing tonight.
I need every staffer with a pulse on duty.
did you tell them that they couldn't leave to vote?
: they're not gonna vote.
half of them are illegal; they can't vote.
why give them the time off for something they can't do anyway?
you'll post a memo informing all employees of their right to vote.
they can't put two words of English together.
put up a memo in English and in Spanish informing all employees of their right to vote and allowing them the privilege to do so.
additionally, you will inform them that they will be paid for their time off for this privilege.
and...
because I'm an equal-opportunity kind of guy, you've got till the end of the week to clear out your desk and leave.
you're fired, Daryl.
good morning. Ambassador Hotel. How may I direct your call?
please hold.
good morning. Ambassador Hotel.
how may I connect your call?
please hold.
one moment, please.
good morning. Ambassador Hotel.
good morning. Ambassador Hotel.
how may I direct your call?
I'm sorry, but I can't give out that information.
please hold for the reservation desk.
it's the policy of the hotel.
Yes, it is.
well, if you are his wife, then you should have his room number, now, shouldn't you?
what a bitch.
husband's playing around, and she wants to take it out on me.
no, no, no. Not today.
no, thank you.
speaking of... - Don't start.
ambassador Hotel. How may I direct your call?
it's gonna bring you nothing but trouble,
Angela, you don't end that.
Hey, do you have plans tonight?
Yeah. I got a hot date with my Magnavox.
do you want to go to the party with me?
for Kennedy?
I didn't think employees were allowed at hotel functions.
well, screwing the boss does have its advantages.
: Oh, God.
look, I know it ain't easy.
I know it's damn near impossible to find a good man out there.
seems like all the good ones are taken.
but a married one?
I'm not good at being alone.
you stay with a married man who ain't gonna leave his wife, and you're looking at a lifetime of being alone.
honey, don't kid yourself.
ambassador Hotel. How may I connect you?
kennedy: America was a great force in the world with immense prestige long before we became a great military power.
and that power has come to us, and we cannot renounce it.
but neither can we afford to forget that the real constructive force in this world comes not from tanks or not from bombs but from the imaginative ideas, the warm sympathies and the generous spirit of a people.
kennedy: One thing is clear in this year of 1968,
I believe, in this country as I've traveled across, and that is that the American people want no more Vietnam.
announcer: California can make the difference.
test one, two. Test one, two.
miss, uh, Jan... Jana...
: Janacek.
Yes. Perhaps I need to remind you, Miss, uh?
Janacek. - Exactly.
that there is a law against loitering.
I've been in this lobby for the past two days waiting for my interview with Senator Kennedy.
miss...
there are no rooms available at the hotel, and no records of your credentials with regards to the senator's press corps.
what does this look like?
I write for an international publication.
rude Pravo.
well, it's not exactly the Washington Post, now, is it?
~ Suzy was in pigtails... ~ - WOMAN: Excuse me.
Hi, um, I have an appointment for a manicure-pedicure.
Oh.
Yup. And you are...
our lovely bride-to-be.
Yes, ma'am.
well, let me see 'em.
excuse me?
Oh.
Oh...
you know he's gonna break it tonight, man.
what?
drysdale, consecutive shutouts, it's gonna happen tonight.
Yeah, maybe.
you don't know how important this is, Miguel.
jose, it's one baseball game.
you can buy tickets to another night.
What?!
no, no, no, no. It's not just a game, okay?
don Drysdale has pitched five consecutive shutouts.
that's a record that has stood since 1904
by Doc White of the Chicago White Sox.
he's gonna break it tonight, man.
I know he is.
DARYL: Who, Drysdale?
Yeah.
you got money on the game, Jose?
no, I'm-I'm just a fan.
well, then, go Dodgers.
Yeah.
I need to see you in my office.
I'm supposed to tell the staff to go to their polling place today and vote.
I'm not old enough to vote.
I'm a felon.
you're a felon?
Nah, I'm just kidding, brother.
course I'm gonna vote today.
now, listen, a lot of people, a lot of people are gonna be intimidated by this thing because it's new, all right?
so I'm counting on all of you to reassure them that it's perfectly legitimate, it's easy...
just-just for one minute, please.
it's easy, and it makes voting simpler and quicker, all right?
all you have to do is turn the plastic pages.
names and offices appear on the left.
simply make your choice and push down firmly in the proper place with the steel stylus attached to the vote recorder.
all right? Now, when you're finished with that, take out the paper ballot.
and I want you all to check, check the back of it, all right, to make sure that there are no stray bits of punched-out paper called "card-hole-aggregate debris.
or what the, uh, what the folks down at IBM like to call "chads" .
if I'd have worked this hard in school,
I'd be on the honor roll.
Hey, you think your brother will loan us his car again?
Ah, I don't know.
he was cool with it the first couple times, but now, I don't know.
I can't do another day on this awful bus, Coop.
me neither. - I hate it.
maybe if I was stoned.
well, yeah, stoned would be good whether we're on the bus or not.
fellas. - Wade. - Wade.
you guys are on the Glendale-Pasadena bus today.
well, no, uh, we were actually gonna come over here to tell you, we got a car today, Wade.
uh, Coop's brother comes through again.
Really?
um, just think of the number of elderly we can help get to the polls with a car.
I think we're much more valuable on our own.
cooper: Yeah.
well, that's great.
maybe you can persuade them to go along with you.
every little bit counts, right?
uh, what precincts are you guys covering?
actually, Dwayne and I won't be in the field today.
we're gonna stay here at campaign headquarters.
that way, we can take care of any problems that come up.
Yeah, we already received a call about stolen voting machines down in Precinct 180.
I'm not familiar with that area.
it's a black neighborhood.
Oh, is it?
Yeah, I guess busing doesn't really agree with you fellas, huh?
I guess we got more in common than you think.
good luck.
wade: Ladies and gentlemen, if we could get...
now all we have to do is actually get a car.
well, first things first.
first things first.
LENKA: Mr. Buckley.
please, Mr. Buckley.
Mr. Buckley, please.
Yes, Miss?
Janacek. - Yes, Miss Janacek.
you told me on Sunday that I would have my interview with Senator Kennedy, but no interview.
then you said Monday. Monday, no interview.
five minutes, Mr. Buckley, that's all I'm asking...
miss Janacek, I believe I also told you that you have to call his press secretary.
I left 20 messages for Mr. Mankiewicz.
well, perhaps you'd like to join the volunteers today, hop on one of the buses.
the only thing I want is five minutes with Senator Kennedy.
does he have any idea what's happening in Czechoslovakia right now?
the censorship law has been repealed.
the people are energized.
Bobby Kennedy is an inspiration to the Czech people.
miss Janacek, you are a Communist writer for a Communist paper in a country that is an ally of the Soviet Union.
I mean... do you have any idea how that would look for the senator?
be informed.
it's almost like you just add an "E
to the end of every English word. Huh.
almost.
all right, let's keep going here.
employees must be informed of their right to vote.
I might need some help spelling that.
love or money?
pardon me?
the reason you' re getting married.
love or money?
I'm saving a life, marrying a boy from my school.
there's a lot of that going on these days.
the government sends a check to the spouse for $135 a month.
it's definitely not for money.
well, I married for love.
the most handsome man I had ever seen.
he looked like a movie star.
he could have had any woman he wanted, and he picked me.
you picked him, too.
Yeah.
suppose I did.
what color is your dress?
: lavender.
maybe a bit lighter.
we have polish to match that, if you like.
sure.
yeah?
big wedding?
no.
no, my father refuses to go.
he calls the shots.
my father's a veteran.
uh, he thinks William, my groom, should take whatever tour they give him.
you see, if he's married, he goes to Germany.
if not, then, um, he's more likely to go straight to the front lines.
my father thinks he's a coward.
what do you think?
you know, more and more young men keep coming back in body bags.
two last week from my graduating class.
and if I could've married them and kept them from getting killed, then I would've.
so, until someone in charge tells me why it is that we're over there, then...
I don't know.
you are gonna be the prettiest...
june bride in this hotel today, dear.
english and Spanish.
great.
I've given six years of my life to this place.
it means everything to me.
I'll give you a fine recommendation.
you're not gonna have any problems finding another job.
I don't want another goddamn job, Paul.
Jack: Hello.
I don't know if I have that portfolio with me.
you know, we're three hours behind you.
say again.
no, I'm saying we're three hours in time behind New York.
I can't say for sure.
Oh, damn.
what is it?
it's nothing.
what is? - It's stupid.
no, no, I'm listening.
you know those black shoes?
what?
I told you it was stupid.
let me call you back.
I bought this dress to go with the black shoes I forgot to pack.
I did pack six other pair, none of them black.
and I have two pair of tennis shoes, so if you're up for a little game later...
you see, women have to pack for every occasion, making it virtually impossible to travel light.
like tonight, it's a formal event, so I brought formalwear.
but... God has a sense of humor.
so I... I bring backup.
however, I'm doubly screwed.
two dresses, both black, and no black shoes.
I know you're probably thinking, "Who the hell cares what color shoes she's wearing? "
believe me, Jack, women notice.
so, basically, you're saying you need to go shopping.
for shoes.
black shoes.
Nelson: At least I don't have to get up three times a night to go have a pee.
well, at least I get out of bed to have one.
checkmate.
see, when you make a move out of frustration or anger, it always ends in catastrophe.
Ah, to beat you just once, Casey.
I'd like to die knowing that I've beaten you just once.
it's all I pray for, Lord.
John: Keep praying.
Hey, Paul.
gentlemen.
would you like to replace an elderly gentleman while he goes off to take his afternoon nap?
Nelson, if I may...
you could have held your rook in reserve, given up one of your pawns and turned this game back around in your favor.
now you tell me.
Hey, Mr. Fallon.
Hey, puppy, come here.
beautiful girl.
come here.
she's a beautiful little thing. Oh, yeah.
how's your wife?
she's perfect.
we're a sold-out show tonight. - Yeah?
you and Mrs. Fallon getting everything you need from my staff?
we are, Paul, thank you.
Jefferson once said about the United States that we were the last best hope for mankind.
that's what I want the United States to be.
this is a generous and compassionate country.
that's what I want this country to stand for.
not violence, not lawlessness, not disorder, but compassion and love and peace.
that's what this country should stand for.
and that's what I intend to do, if I'm elected president.
and that's what I intend to do if I'm elected president.
Hey. - Hey.
yes?
we were here yesterday.
yes?
we...
we purchased some, uh...
goods.
: ...goods from you yesterday.
floor?
um... four.
Mm. That's where I'm going.
I know you, right?
you, uh, you work here, don't you?
uh, switchboard.
and you?
kitchen. Food and beverage.
huh. That's got to beat the pants off of sitting at the switchboard all day.
not that I'm complaining.
it's just got to be more stimulating than:
good morning. Ambassador Hotel.
how may I direct your call?
grass is always greener.
your job certainly sounds more exciting than mine.
well, be my guest.
today, our brilliant general manager wants me to let all the wetbacks know they can have time off to go vote.
after you.
see you around.
sure.
anybody see you?
no.
what are you fellas looking for?
we just wanted to get another joint from you. Um...
well, what are you... looking for?
uh...
Oh, that's my camera.
uh...
just what I said, just another joint.
no, no, no.
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, okay. - No.
no. - Maybe we should split, man...
we could come back tomorrow...
what are you looking for?
um...
I don't...
I don't understand.
you don't understand because you're not listening to the words.
you're not listening to the words in the question, my friend.
well... if we could just get our, uh, the joint...
okay, why, why? - Then we could I...
Why?
Why?
why do you want a joint?
why do I want a joint?
to-to get stoned, man. - To get stoned.
what's with all your questions?
um... - Okay, okay, okay.
now...
why do you want to get stoned?
we want to get stoned because it feels good, man.
because it feels good?
Bingo! Because it feels good.
right.
fisher: You want to get stoned because it feels good!
right?! Right! - Right.
right. - Wrong!
w-what?
Wh... Wr... Why is that wrong?
because it's a cop-out, man.
okay, then can you explain to us why, for what other reason than the fact that it feels good do we want to get stoned, man?
because...
it's our way...
of getting closer...
to God.
and that is what you're looking for.
except for you didn't know it...
Yeah.
...until this moment.
I had no idea.
well, I knew.
thank God for me, huh?
Jimmy: Absolutely.
Jimmy: So, if we could just get the joint and...
are you fellas familiar with lysergic acid diethylamide?
Hey.
William.
I couldn't sleep last night and I had to get out of the house.
my folks are driving me nuts.
you gonna invite me in?
of course.
that dress looks great on you.
you know it's bad luck.
what is?
well, for the groom to see the bride in her dress before the wedding.
you silly.
any chance of getting this in earlier?
seems late for a wedding.
chapel sure is busy for a Tuesday.
it's summertime... June brides.
you didn't have to get me this room, by the way.
my brother...
my family really appreciates what you're doing, Diane.
it means a lot to all of us.
to me.
you know, I always thought my wedding would be the most exciting day of my life.
every little girl's fantasy.
a white dress, cake taller than me, hundreds of guests.
it's just a certificate, Diane.
you can still have all of that.
Yeah.
if marrying you tonight keeps you from going to Vietnam, then it's worth it.
Yeah.
chef's Special, Edward?
Miguel, you know if I could, I would.
bullshit, man.
I see you serving the brothers the good stuff.
white folks, too.
you don't see them eating this dog food.
Lord, today.
do we have to do this every day, Miguel?
every day you keep putting the brown man down, Edward.
- Keeping the brown man down.
edward: I'm putting the brown man down.
that's right. Let's keep the brown man down.
let's send the brown man back across the border to his sweet senoritas and his refried beans.
first of all, we didn't cross the border.
the border crossed us.
and our senoritas are better than your fried-chicken-eating mama with the big backyard.
edward: Hey, you smell that?
look at that... my very own special berry cobbler, fresh out of the oven.
but since you had to put my mama in it, excuse me.
here you go, Jose, enjoy.
come on, man.
come on, man.
you Mexican boys can't play the dozens.
I don't know why you keep on, Miguel.
Yeah, man.
man, what do you know about the dozens?
I know that I got some cobbler and you don't.
you're a sellout, man.
you know. - Hey.
it's good, ain't it, Jose?
that recipe was handed down by my great-grandmother.
Hey, let me have some of that. Come on, brother.
we ain't brothers, amigo.
and we ain't amigos, bruh-thuh.
go ahead.
you, um... - Mm...
you working a double shift like the rest of us?
I most certainly am not.
you must be the only one.
Yeah, and you know why.
Why?
too good-looking for that mess.
you ain't working a double 'cause whitey's afraid of your black ass, man.
they're afraid you're gonna go all Huey Newton on them, all violent.
see, they ain't afraid of us yet, Jose.
not yet, man, but one day, one day they will be, man.
we're gonna get the respect that we deserve.
we're gonna take back California, take back our land, man.
I want you to park that anger in my kitchen, young man.
I want you to get your hand off my shoulder, Negro.
all right, keep it up.
see, the first few times, I tried to make this dessert, couldn't get it right.
too much sugar one time, not enough sugar the next time, couldn't find the balance.
I realized I was forcing it.
you know, trying to make it taste like my mama's or her mama's.
mine didn't have any poetry, didn't have any light.
and then I realized I was trying to force it to taste like my mother's, taste like her mother's.
see, it had to be Edward's creation.
it had to come from me.
now, you, Miguel, you've got... shit to offer.
you've got no poetry. You've got no light.
you've got no one looking at you and saying, "Damn."
look at that Miguel.
I want some of what he's got.
all you got is your anger.
I ain't angry.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
come on. Speak up... - I said I'm not angry!
all right.
you know, I used to be just like you.
I had anger.
and then, after Dr. King was killed...
...well, anger like you can't even imagine.
white folks ain't trying to keep you down, Miguel.
white folks just don't like to be pushed into a corner.
they'll come around.
you just got to make it look like it was their idea, like they're the ones that thought of it.
they need to feel like they're the great emancipators.
like it was theirs to give in the first place.
let 'em have it.
I mean, if that's all it takes, let them have it.
can you dig it?
I know my man Jose can dig it, can't you?
Yeah.
DARYL: Edward.
is that your famous cobbler I'm smelling down in my office?
Yes, sir, Mr. Timmons.
I just pulled a fresh batch out of the oven.
I'll make sure some gets to your office directly, sir.
: "I'll get some sent to your office directly, sir.
Step-and-fetch-it motherfucker.
I'm not working a double shift today, though, am I... amigo?
fisher: LSD was first discovered in 1938.
she can be beautiful.
she can be terrifying.
the difference between a good trip and a bad trip is completely contingent upon your willingness to let go.
turn yourself over to her completely.
: are you ready to have a personal relationship with God?
very well. Open.
under the tongue.
you figure out what to do with those Dodger tickets?
I know a few guys might like to buy them.
I'm not selling them, Miguel.
how many times I got to tell you that?
Hey, what's the face value?
I don't know... $4. 50 apiece.
$4. 50? I can get you ten bucks easy.
I'm not selling them.
I want this whole place filled with balloons.
I want people having to fight their way through the balloons just to get in here.
balloons don't translate into more votes, Wade.
but they look better on TV.
McCarthy's not going to want to give a concession speech after the big win in Oregon.
they're gonna turn those cameras on before the polls close, so we got to look like we got the thing already won.
it sends a stronger message.
why are we still standing here? Let's go!
Dwayne, we need you upstairs right away.
socialist.
what's that?
you said I write for a Communist paper in a Communist country.
it's a Socialist paper in a Socialist country.
red is red, Miss Janacek.
the reforms in my country are working to put a human face on Socialism.
see the room we're standing in right now?
in a few hours, it's going to be filled with hundreds of people who are here either to celebrate a victory or lament a defeat because of something that we have in America called the democratic process.
now, if you can tell me the last time that happened in your country, I'll give you your five minutes with the senator.
DWAYNE: Damn right I'm threatening you!
we're not just talking about a few stolen voting machines this time!
do we understand each other?!
damn it.
what is it?
there's a police checkpoint outside of a polling place in Watts.
the system's not working for us... again.
I was watching the local news yesterday...
...and what-what I saw happen on that motorcade just gave me hope.
I mean, it's Negroes and Mexicans by the tens of thousands just leaping in front of his car, tearing at his clothes, ripping at his shoes.
they loved him.
now that Dr. King is gone... no one left but Bobby.
no one.
reporter: And how did it seem to you when the senator came through Prestonsburg?
man: Oh, it, uh, it's one of the greatest days we've ever had in this town...
especially the young people.
they' re all crazy about him.
reporter: Do you feel any differently after seeing him?
man: I feel a little prouder being an American.
reporter: Did you get to see the senator?
woman: Yes, sir, I did.
how did you feel about it?
Whew. I was very pleased.
I'd just loved to have got to laid my hand on him.
reporter: Senator, you've just about completed the second day now.
is there anything significant that you've learned on this trip?
well, people, uh, are still having a very, very difficult time.
there is hunger, considerable hunger in this part of the country.
there's no real hope for the future amongst many of these people who, uh, worked hard in the coal mines, and now that the coal mines shut down, uh, they have no place to go.
there's no hope for the future.
there's no industry moving in.
the men are trained in government programs and there's no jobs at the end of the training program because of the cutback, because of the demands on our federal budget in Washington and the war in Vietnam there...
even these training programs are being cut back, and so people are being cut off and they have no place to turn, and so they're, uh, desperate and...
and filled with despair.
it seems to me that, uh, this country, as wealthy as we are, that this is an intolerable condition that reflects on all of us.
we can do things all over the rest of the world, but I think we should do something for our people here in our own country.
it's over.
you okay?
you want to talk about it?
not really.
sometimes it helps.
not right now, not this time.
good afternoon. Ambassador Hotel.
how may I direct your call?
connecting to his room, sir.
have a nice day.
good afternoon. Ambassador Hotel.
how may I direct your call?
please hold.
come on, girl. Come on.
it's our summer clearance sale.
everything must go! Everything!
that shit, this shit for... this shit, for sure.
Jimmy: Hey, man, it's okay.
: I want you to look at me.
I am.
through my eyes.
no.
this is painful.
- Shut up.
you shut up.
no, you shut up.
Jimmy: See, it comes and it goes.
I can't see.
okay.
okay.
what were you saying?
: Hi.
Hi.
I realized I hadn't prayed in a long time.
thought it might be a good idea, you know?
well, what are we praying for?
I suppose, whatever you like:
world peace, sick grandparent, better job.
do you really believe that our prayers get answered?
some do.
I prayed for my brother to come back from Vietnam in one piece, and he did.
I guess when a prayer is answered, it's called a miracle.
well, in that case, I'm going to pray that my mother and father show up tonight.
now, that would be a miracle.
TIM: I remember you saying something something about a friendly game, John.
Yeah, well, I think that, uh, chess is a little bit like life.
it scares people, intimidates them, and that's why they invented checkers.
you're still in check.
story of my life.
what exactly is that story, sir?
well, it's not what you read in the gossip mags, that's for sure.
Mm. Well, I'm glad of that, then.
I mean, we have our moments, like any married couple, but, you know...
but you stay, huh?
real men stay.
they-they fight the good fight. They don't leave.
Yeah. - Yeah.
your wife?
Oh, she's gone.
she died last year.
any regrets?
well, I suppose I could've spent more time with my kids.
I've got three of them and eight grandchildren, and, um...
I suppose I missed out quite a bit, being here all the time, working here,
I mean.
you know, it has to be said, in those days, your job was your life because your-your life depended on it.
I remember my wife said to me once, she said, "You know, John, I think you-you love that hotel more than you love me."
: perhaps she was right.
and you're still in check.
Oh, hi.
~ Tonight ~ - I think, after five years, the entire staff knows we're married, Paul.
~ Of lovers in love ~ - I guess.
so it would probably be safe to steal a little kiss now and then.
and you have to eat lunch more than once every two weeks.
salad?
is that all I get?
Yes.
well, you had a heck of a morning.
which you slept through.
Hey! My name tag does not say "manager" on it.
Hey, I'll switch with you.
I'll be the stylist of the stars.
Oh!
and you can start with Virginia Fallon.
~ It isn't a dream ~ - Okay.
so sad... - ~ The only sound ~
that woman. - ~ That you will hear ~
tonight's her last show. - ~ I love you... ~
she's not booked here at the Grove until next fall.
can we go on vacation that week?
Hey, did you vote?
I tried, but the line was too long.
I've got some, um...
it's "yes" on Proposition 1.
that's the Veterans' Bond Act.
" no" on 2.
mills for supervisor, not Hahn.
Cranston, Sheinbaum.
of course Bobby.
also, on the, um...
what?
what? What is it?
your hair, your suit...
you know, it might say 1968, but your attitude is pure 1920.
Phil: Well, look, if they don't close the deal by the end of the day, then we're out...
uh, he just came in.
virginia: Aw, you're the best.
MARIO: Thank you.
good afternoon, Mr. Fallon.
afternoon, Mario.
Tim, did you know that Mario's family's from Portofino?
we spent two weeks there last summer.
tim simply adores it.
he adores...
I had to drag him off the beaches to go to work.
can I get you anything else, Mrs. Fallon?
no, we're fine, Mario. Thank you.
Oh, Tim, can you give Mario?
very well. Have a nice night and a wonderful show, Mrs. Fallon.
thank you, Mario.
Hello, Tim.
Phil.
virginia woke up, couldn't find you.
we were nervous.
we were, huh?
Phil has lots to tell you about Vegas next month, baby.
that's right. - Oh, yeah?
has it changed since the last time we were there?
lots of hotels and casinos in the middle of the desert, as I remember it.
what, they get rid of gambling?
we booked the Flamingo, Tim.
four weeks in July!
: I booked the Flamingo.
guys, four weeks in Vegas in the middle of summer?
that's not a booking. That's a sentence, Phil.
Phil: Tim, come on.
no, no, no, you come on.
who the hell wants to spend four weeks in Vegas in July?
I'll tell you who: Nobody.
what happened to that picture that you promised us?
things are slow at the studios, Tim.
the Vegas deal is a good deal.
good for who?
virginia: Tim, give it a rest.
it's not like you have to perform.
what the hell is this, Virginia?
well, from the looks of it, a very fine single malt Scotch, Tim.
thought we had an agreement.
I haven't had a drink all day.
you've been sleeping all day.
Tim, there is a time and a place...
Hey, you know, believe it or not, Virginia, people do eat food every now and again.
take your fucking judgment and check it at the door.
I don't need you to babysit.
you don't want to go to Vegas?
it's too hot?
well, then, get out.
I'm the reason we have all this, not you.
nobody's saying that you... - Phil, shut the fuck up!
people come to see me.
people love me.
: they love me.
so if I want to have one fucking drink,
I'm going to have one fucking drink, because I deserve it.
that's the new agreement, sweetheart.
you have a 5: 00 hair appointment.
you're on stage at 9: 00 sharp.
you'll have a 45-minute break, then you're introducing Senator Kennedy in the Embassy Ballroom.
try and stay sober enough to not embarrass us in front of the next president.
I've heard a rumor that someone's trying to unload tickets for tonight's Dodgers game.
it's Drysdale's night.
tell me about it.
six consecutive.
he's gonna do it tonight.
not since 1904... 64 years.
Yeah, I know.
they're yours, man.
but we haven't discussed a price.
there is no price.
enjoy the game.
you could've just gone, Jose.
and tomorrow... then what?
I would've been out on the street looking for another job.
that's you.
little man...
that's you.
the story of King Arthur.
knights of the Round Table, Merlin the magician.
you have heard of it, of course.
Yeah.
we read the stories in school.
then you know that Arthur wasn't always a king.
he was a young man once, like you.
you, Jose, are a young king.
kind, caring, humble.
eager for adventure.
and so... I thank you, humbly, for these tickets, my young brother, my young king.
a chivalrous act.
chivalrous act, indeed.
Hey, Edward.
Hey, save a... save a ticket stub for me, okay?
you bet I will.
go, Dodgers.
Yeah.
go, Dodgers.
: nice shot.
it's 40-love.
all right.
how come we only play tennis when we come to Los Angeles?
cooper: That was... that was...
I'm... Bring it in. We-We gotta discuss.
let's talk. Okay. - We gotta talk.
how long does this stuff last?
I don't know, man.
I am freakin' out right now.
me, too.
let's go. - Okay.
Jimmy: Play-Play tennis.
14-love.
what's wrong?
good.
what's the matter, Nelson?
I don't know if it's because of my age or that I simply can't remember.
I, uh... I keep losing track of things...
my keys, my cane, my socks.
I don't even know in what drawer I put my underwear.
I got lost on the way home today.
that's never happened to me before.
no.
well...
you know, perhaps it's just a phase.
no.
this is no phase, Casey.
it's about growing old.
old bones, old face, old man.
I hate it.
I hate retirement.
Yeah.
makes me... feel useless.
Yeah.
Hey, how 'bout a nice cup of tea?
tea?
Yeah.
tea is a drink for old white folks.
how 'bout a Scotch?
well, a Scotch.
I don't know; could be arranged.
make it a double.
on the rocks.
...and I'II teII you what, the storm system's stiII moving west.
what are you looking at, Caroline?
the wind, Mom.
they say the hurricane is coming.
l'm on a boat.
l'm drifting.
can l do anything for you, Mom?
make anything easier?
Oh, sugar...
there's nothing left to do.
ls what it is.
finding it harder to keep my eyes open.
my mouth's full of cotton.
there, there, Miss Daisy.
you gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.
do you want any more medication, Mother?
doctor said you could have as much as you want.
no need for anybody to suffer.
a friend told me that she never had the chance to say goodbye to her mother.
l wanted to... -lt's okay.
l wanted to tell you how much l'm gonna miss you so...
mom.
Oh, Caroline.
are you afraid?
l'm curious.
what comes next?
they built the train station in 1918.
my father was there the day it opened.
he said they had a tuba band playing.
they had the finest clockmaker in all of the South to build that glorious clock.
his name was...
Mr. Gateau.
he was married to a CreoIe of EvangeIine Parish and they had a son.
Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absoIuteIy bIind.
when their son was oId enough, he joined the army.
and they prayed God wouId keep him out of harm's way.
for months, he did nothing but work on that cIock.
one day, a Ietter came.
and Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up, aIone, to bed.
and their son came home.
they buried him in the famiIy pIot, where he wouId be with them when their time came.
Mr. Cake worked on his cIock, laboring to finish.
it was a morning to remember.
Papa said there were peopIe everywhere.
even Teddy RooseveIt came.
lt's running backwards!
l made it that way so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war might stand and come home again.
home to farm, work, have chiIdren.
to Iive Iong, fuII Iives.
perhaps my own son might come home again.
l'm sorry if l've offended anybody.
l hope you enjoy my clock.
Mr. Cake was never seen again.
some say he died of a broken heart.
some say he went to sea.
excuse me.
do you mind if l make a call? Somebody's watching my little boy.
sure.
l hope l haven't disappointed you.
you couldn't disappoint me.
well, l know l don't have much to show for myself.
find my dark suitcase.
there's a diary.
this?
could you read it to me?
ls this what you want to do?
l tried to read it a hundred different times.
mom, it's not exactly...
lt's just the sound of your voice, darling.
okay.
lt's dated April 4th, 1985.
and it says New Orleans.
'this is my last will and testament.
'l don't have much to leave, few possessions, no money, really.
'l will go out of this world the same way l came in, alone and with nothing.
'all l have is my story, " and l'm writing it now while l still remember it.
'my name is Benjamin. Benjamin Button. "
and I was born under unusuaI circumstances.
the First WorId War had ended, and I've been toId it was an especiaIIy good night to be born.
thank God it's over!
we won the war!
the Great War is over!
what are you doing here?
l'm afraid she's going to die.
what?
that's enough. All of you, get away from her.
l came as quickly as l could. The streets are filled with people.
promise me he has a place.
Yeah.
she gave her Iife for me.
and for that, I am forever gratefuI.
Mr. Button.
Thomas? Where are you going?
Hey! What are you doing there?
what do you have there?
come on, Queenie. -Now, Mr. Weathers!
come on, now, you know l ain't got nothing but work to do around here.
come on. Just take some time. -Stop all this foolishness.
the air is sweet.
you look very handsome tonight, Miss Queenie.
handsome as l've ever seen.
the brown matches your eyes.
Oh, hush!
let's see here. You ain't no slouch yourself.
Hambert's back in town.
he came home legless, but he's home.
l know you were sweet on him one time.
sweeter than l should've been.
miss Simone messed herself.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
she got to stop doing that or it's diapers for her.
l'll be right there, Miss Jameson! -Now, Queenie, now come on.
okay, Queenie'll be right there.
lt's awful nice out here.
come on out back for a moment. Take your mind off things.
you're so bad.
what in God's name? -What's this?
Oh, the Lord done something here.
hope l didn't hurt it none stepping on it like that.
we best leave that for the police.
poor baby.
l'll go.
lt's for sure nobody wanted to keep it. Come on, baby.
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?
hold your water! You go deal with it.
okay. No, go, l'll be back.
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed herself all over again!
Jane Childress, start her a bath!
and mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey.
you'll be messing yourself soon enough.
somebody stole my necklace.
okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister, l'll be right with you, okay?
go on back upstairs, hear?
you are as ugly as an old pot but you're still a child of God.
Queenie, Apple, she won't take a bath without you!
mercy.
l'll be right there!
okay. You just wait right here for me now, okay?
my sister gave me those pearls. l can't find them anywhere.
somebody's been stealing my jewelry. -They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?
right around your pretty white neck. Now, come on. Hush all that noise.
ls Dr. Rose still here? -l don't know.
your heart is strong.
you just want to avoid any undue stimulation.
l trust you ladies will help me out with that?
l have something. Could you come downstairs?
never seen anything like it. Nearly blind from cataracts.
l'm not sure if he can hear. His bones indicate severe arthritis.
his skin has lost all elasticity, and his hands and feet are ossified.
he shows all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his 80s on his way to the grave.
he's dying?
his body is failing him before his life's begun.
Where'd he come from?
my sister's child. From Lafayette. She had an unfortunate adventure.
the poor child, he got the worst of it. Come out white.
there are places for unwanted babies like these, Queenie.
no room for another mouth to feed here.
the Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is.
a baby... -You said he don't have long.
Queenie, some creatures aren't meant to survive.
no, this baby, he is a miracle. That's for certain.
just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see.
y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.
we're gonna have us a visitor that's gonna be staying with us for a little while.
my sister had a child and she couldn't see right by it, so...
he's known as...
he's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him.
l had 10 children.
there's not a baby l can't care for. Let me see him.
God in Heaven. He looks just like my ex-husband.
look, he's prematurely old.
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more time on this earth.
join the club.
he's smiling!
Hambert sends his remembrances to you.
are you right out of your mind?
l know you ain't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own, but this ain't yours to keep.
lt may not even be humankind.
Mr. Weathers, come back here.
please.
you never know what's coming for you.
it seemed I had found a home.
ls any of this true?
you have such a lovely voice.
mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.
that clock just kept going, year after year after year.
but I didn't know I was a chiId.
same old crap every day.
I thought I was Iike everyone eIse there.
an oId man in the twiIight of his Iife.
could you make him stop that?
stop banging that fork. lt's used for eating, not for playing with.
and use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin.
Hey, boy.
aIways had a heaIthy curiosity.
what was up the street? Or around the next corner?
go get him!
Benjamin! That is dangerous. Come back over here.
stay put, child.
I Ioved her very much.
she was my mother.
mama.
mama.
some days l feel different than the day before.
everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another.
but we're all going the same way.
just taking different roads to get there, that's all.
you're on your own road, Benjamin.
mama? How much longer l got?
just be thankful for what you're given, hear?
you're already here longer than you're supposed to.
some nights, I'd have to sIeep aIone.
I didn't mind.
I wouId Iisten to the house breathing.
aII those peopIe sIeeping.
I feIt safe.
it was a pIace of great routine.
every morning at 5: 30, no matter the weather,
GeneraI WinsIow, U. S. Army, Retired, wouId raise the fIag.
Mrs. SybiI Wagner, once an opera singer of some note, weII, she sang Wagner.
all right, baby, come on.
we got to put some life into these old sticks for you.
get you walking so you can help me out around here. Come on now, hear?
no matter the season, supper was served promptIy at 5: 30.
molasses.
l learned to read when l was five.
my grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor.
he brung home every play for me to read.
'kind keepers of my weak decaying age, " Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
'even like a man new haled from the rack, " So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
'and these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, " Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. "
you thought l was plain ignorant, didn't you?
the actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth.
he killed Abraham Lincoln.
you never know what's coming for you.
on Saturday nights, Mama wouId make me go to church.
Amen! Amen! -Amen! Amen!
what can l do for you, sister?
her parts are all twisted up inside and she can't have little children.
Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb.
out, damnable affliction!
praise God! -Praise God!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! -Hallelujah!
and what's this old man's irrediction?
he's got the Devil on his back, trying to ride him into the grave before his time.
out, Zebuchar! -Yes!
out, Beelzebub! -Yes!
how old are you?
seven. But l look a lot older.
God bless you.
he's seven.
now, this is a man with optimism in his heart.

Yes! -Yes!
we are all children in the eyes of God!
Yes! -Hallelujah!

and we're gonna have you walk. -Amen.

come on with it, son. Come on. -Come on.
now God is gonna see you the rest of the way.
he's gonna see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane.
he's gonna see that you walk from faith...
Hallelujah! -...and divine inspiration alone!
Yes. -Hey, Ben!
go, son! -Now walk.
Yes. -Come on.
don't touch him.
rise up, old man.
rise up like Lazarus.
l said, rise up!
Hallelujah!
Yes.
come on.
say hallelujah.
Hallelujah! -Hallelujah!

walk on. Yes.
that's right, Benjamin.
now when I Iook back on it, it was miracuIous.
but you know the saying, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
glory in the highest!
sweet Jesus!
No! -No!
there were so many birthdays.
for he's a joIIy good feIIow For he's a joIIy good feIIow...
so we wouIdn't run out, we wouId spare the candIes.
Queenie, you know l don't like birthdays and l don't like cake.
and death was a common visitor. PeopIe came and went.
you aIways knew when someone Ieft us.
there was a siIence in the house.
it was a wonderfuI pIace to grow up.
I was with peopIe who had shed aII the inconsequences of earIier Iife.
left wondering about the weather, the temperature of a bath, the Iight at the end of a day.
for everyone that died, someone wouId come to take their pIace.
l've been married five times.
my fifth wife and l are captured by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.
Oh, goodness gracious.
we escaped across the river.
my wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten.
Oh, my God.
my second wife steps on cobra and dies.
lt was very bad luck to be married to me.
that's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine.
he's a Pygmy... -The next summer l'm captured...with three others by the Baschiele tribe.
they trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer to a very strange American man.
l hear you're not so old as you're looking.
you just fooling everybody.
what's the matter? Did you get Madjembe?
what's Madjembe?
worms.
l don't think l have worms.
this is just how l am.
did you take your pills today? -No, ma'am.
come. Let's get a cold root beer.
l found the medication under your pillow.
l'm not supposed to. lt's dangerous.
who said that? Come on, little man.
Hello, children.
hold, please.
then l'm in the monkey house at Philadelphia Zoological Park.
three thousand people show up my first day.
look.
what's it like living in a cage?
lt stinks.
but the monkeys.
they do some tricks there.
l throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.
she is orangutan.
when l'm not playing with the monkeys, they want me to run to the bars in my cage, with my teeth.
so then what'd you do?
then l leave zoo, go here, go there. Wandered most of the time.
you were all alone?
plenty of time you'll be alone.
when you're different like us, it's gonna be that way.
but l'll tell you a little secret.
fat people, skinny people, tall people, white people, they're just as alone as we are.
but they're scared shitless.
l think about the river l grew up on.
lt would be nice to sit by my river again.
come, l have an appointment.
there's my little man. You ready, sugar?
always ready. Always ready.
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.
lt's a pleasure to meet you, sir. -My pleasure, ma'am.
you can find your own way home, can't you?
take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.
Hey! Hey!
where in God's name have you been? Get in here.
l mean, you take my breath away, you know that?
Oh, Lord, l was so worried about you.
it had been the best day of my Iife.
how's her breathing? -lt's shallow.
they say it'll reach us in a few hours, so l gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's.
they say there's nothing to worry about here in the hospital.
Nurses'll be right here if you need them. Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm okay reading. -l shouldn't be more than an hour.
was there just company?
lt was just Dorothy leaving.
go on, Caroline.
'on Sundays, the families would come and visit. "
it was Thanksgiving, 1930.
I met the person who changed my Iife forever.
well, Benjamin.
might l say you are looking strikingly youthful.
good day, Mrs. Fuller.
a single cane, back straight as an arrow.
what elixir have you been drinking?
thank you, ma'am. -Grandma! Look at me!
that was really something.
come on over here, you.
now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.
this is Mr...
l'm afraid, Benjamin, l don't rightly know your last name.
Benjamin's fine.
I never forgot her bIue eyes.
good people, supper is served.
health and food, for love and friends. For everything thy goodness sends.
Amen.
Amen! -Amen!
did you know turkeys aren't really birds?
why do you say that?
they're in the pheasant family, can't hardly fly.
lt's sad, don't you think? Birds that can't fly?
l love birds that can't fly.
they are so delicious.
that's terrible. -l have something to tell y'all while we're giving thanks for God's blessings.
l had a miracle happen.
the Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.
what does she mean, answered her prayers?
Thanks. Thank you.
she's gonna have a baby, silly.
that's what my mama said when l was gonna have a baby brother, but he didn't live long, 'cause he didn't breathe right.
'ln the afternoon, when he had got his beautiful hind legs " just as Big God Nqong had promised.
'you can see that it is 5: 00, " because Big God Nqong's clock says so. "
lsn't that something?
again, read it again.
Oh, read it again, please.
all right. But afterwards, you must go to bed.
l promise.
'old Man Kangaroo. "
are you sleeping?
who's that?
lt's me, Daisy.
Oh, hi!
Kay, come on.
where are we going?
come on. Under here.
here, you light it.
l'm not supposed to play with matches.
don't be a chicken. Light it.
l'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.
okay.
l saw my mama kissing another man.
her face was red from it.
your turn.
l'm not as old as l look.
l thought so.
you don't seem like an old person.
like my grandma. -l'm not.
are you sick?
well, l heard Mama and Tizzy whispering.
they said l was gonna die soon, but maybe not.
you're odd.
you're different than anybody l've ever met.
may l? -Okay.
what are you doing under there?
you come right out here and get back up to bed!
lt's after midnight!
you are not to be playing together.
Yes, ma'am.
now you get back to bed, little lady.
you're too young to be wandering around in the night on your own.
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
you are a different child.
a man-child.
and, baby, people aren't gonna understand just how different you are.
what's wrong with me, Mama?
come here.
God hasn't said yet, baby.
now go on to bed, hear? And behave yourself.
go on. Say your prayers, hear?
did l ever tell you l've been struck by lightning seven times?
once when l was repairing a leak on the roof.
once l was just crossing the road to get the mail.
I never forgot her...
'...blue eyes. "
mom?
did you get that this Benjamin loved you from the first time that he saw you?
not many people experience that.
want me to go on?
he crosses something out.
when that baby came, things were different.
your mama gone away. And your daddy gonna stay.
didn't Ieave nobody but the baby.
babies were born, peopIe died.
a Iot of foIks been through that oId house.
l've come to say goodbye. l'm going away.
going?
where?
l haven't figured that out yet, but l'll send you a postcard when l get there.
what about your friend, the tall lady?
we are not friends anymore.
that's what happens with tall people sometimes.
well, goodbye.
spent a Iot of time by myseIf that year.
Hello?
Hi. -l'm moving in today.
welcome. We've been expecting you.
can you please show her up to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?
l'm sorry, but we usually don't allow dogs in the house.
well, she's old as the hills. She's almost blind.
she won't be a bother much longer.
well, all right, long as she stays from up underfoot.
right this way, ma'am.
as hard as I try, I can't remember her name.
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.
maybe it was MapIe.
it's funny how sometimes the peopIe we remember the Ieast make the greatest impression on us.
I do remember she wore diamonds.
and she aIways dressed in fine cIothing, as if she was going out.
aithough she never did and nobody ever came to visit her.
she taught me to pIay the piano.
lt's not about how well you play.
lt's how you feel about what you're playing.
try this.
you can't help putting yourself in the music.
there were many changes.
some you couId see, some you couIdn't.
hair had started growing in aII sorts of pIaces, aIong with other things.
I feIt pretty good, considering.
darling, the pain.
all right, Mom, l'll get the nurse.
look at this eye. This is a major hurricane, a sIow hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of...
not doing too good?
nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave.
l'm gonna ride it out.
there. That should make things much easier.
have you had a chance to say your goodbyes?
my father waited four hours for my brother to get here from Boger City.
couldn't go without him.
she seems like a sweet woman. -Yeah.
l haven't had as much time with her as l would've...
you busy? l could use your help. -Excuse me.
sure.
Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws......to Poverty Point to watch the boats go up and down the river.
these were hard times.
did l ever tell you l was struck by lightning seven times?
once when l was in the field, just tending to my cows.
my fourth hand didn't show up.
anybody want to make $2 for a day's work 'round here?
what's the matter?
nobody wants to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay?
he never pays.
nobody wants a job? -l do.
you got your sea legs about you, old man?
l think.
well, that's good enough for me.
get your ass on board. We'll sure as hell find out.
I was as happy as I couId be.
l need a volunteer!
I wouId do anything.
Yes, Captain!
scrape off all this bird shit!
right away, sir.
and I was actuaIIy gonna be paid for something I wouId've done for free.
his name was Captain Mike CIark.
he'd been on a tugboat since he was seven.
get moving, then.
come here.
can you still get it up?
l do every morning.
the old pole, huh? The high, hard one?
l guess.
when was the last time you had a woman?
never. -Never?
not that l know of, sir.
wait a minute, now.
you mean to say you've been on this earth however many years and you've never had a woman?
damn, that's the saddest thing l've ever heard in my life.
never?
no.
well, then, by Jesus, you are coming with me.
what did your father do?
l never met my father.
you lucky bastard.
all fathers want to do is hold you down.
out on my father's boat, workin' the two-a-day, this little, fat bastard.
'Tug lrish, " they called him.
anyway, l finally work up the nerve and tell him, " l don't want to spend the rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat. "
you know what l'm saying?
you don't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat.
Absolutely! Damn right!
so you know what my father says to me?
he says, " Who the hell do you think you are?
'what the hell do you think you can do? "
so l tell him.
'well, if you're asking, " l want to be an artist. "
he laughs.
'an artist? God meant for you to work a tugboat, just like me.
'and that's exactly what you're gonna do. "
well, l turned myself into an artist.
a tattoo artist!
l put on every one of these myself.
you have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now.
when l'm dead, l'm gonna send him my arm.
that one.
don't let anyone tell you different.
you gotta do what you're meant to do.
and l happen to be a goddamned artist.
but you're a tugboat captain.
captain Mike?
we're ready for you and your friend.
let's go, old timer, eh? Break your cherry.
Hello, my lovelies! -Hey, Captain.
Hi, Captain. -Hi.
Hi. -Hi.
he gives me the willies. That is not for me.
how are you tonight, grandpa?
it was a night to remember.
what are you, Dick Tracy or something? l've got to rest.
again.
thank you. -No, thank you. You have a nice night.
will you be here tomorrow? -Every night but Sunday.
it sure made me understand the vaIue of earning a Iiving.
good night, sweetie. Come back now.
things money can buy you.
lt's nasty out.
can l offer you a ride somewhere?
well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.
my name is Thomas, Thomas Button.
l'm Benjamin. -Benjamin.
lt's a pleasure to know you.
would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink?
all right.
evening, Mr. Button.
what'll it be, sir?
l'll have whatever he's having. -Sazerac for the both of us.
with whiskey, not brandy.
you don't drink, do you?
lt's a night for firsts. -How's that?
l've never been to a brothel, either.
well, it's an experience.
lt certainly is. There's a time for everything.
true enough. -Your drinks.
l don't mean to be rude, but your hands. ls that painful?
well, l was born with some form of disease.
what kind of disease?
l was born old.
l'm sorry. -No need to be.
there's nothing wrong with old age.
my wife passed away many years ago.
l'm so, so sorry.
she died in childbirth.
to children. -To mothers.
what line of work you in, Mr. Button?
buttons. Button's Buttons. There isn't a button that we don't make.
our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich and his infernal zippers.
would you gentlemen like anything else?
one for the road, Benjamin?
only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.
so, what line of work do you do?
l'm a tugboat man.
l enjoyed talking to you.
l enjoyed drinking with you.
would you mind if, time to time, l stopped by and said hello?
anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.
good night, Benjamin.
drive on.
where have you been?
nothing. l met some people and listened to some music.
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!
growing up's a funny thing. Sneaks up on you.
one person is there, then suddenIy somebody eIse has taken her pIace.
she wasn't aII eIbows and knees anymore.
Benjamin! Come on!
okay.
I Ioved those weekends when she'd come and spend the night with her grandmother.
you want to see something?
you gotta keep it a secret, so get dressed. l'll meet you out back.
come on.
can you swim? -l can do anything you can do.
here, put this on. We gotta hurry.
ls he okay?
captain?
captain Mike?
morning, Captain. Can you take us out?
do you know what day it is?
Sunday?
do you know what that means?
means l was very drunk last night.
well, you're drunk every night.
ls that a girl? -Close friend.
l want to show her the river.
you're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians.
l could lose my license.
what are you waiting for?
pulled in for repair a wounded duck.
she's flying now, huh?
ahoy, sailor!
l wish we could go with them.
did you say something, Mom?
lt's getting really bad.
can you hear me, Mom?
time just seeped out of me.
'things were changing quickly. "
l don't know how it's possible, but you seem to have more hair.
what if l told you that l wasn't getting older, but l was getting younger than everybody else?
well, l'd feel sorry for you, to have to see everybody you love die before you do.
lt's an awful responsibility.
I'd never thought about Iife or death that way before.
Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love.
how else would we know how important they are to us?
and one faII day, a famiIiar visitor came knocking on our door.
you want to go with me to the drugstore?
she taught me how to pIay the piano.
Amen. -Amen.
and she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.
let's go.
I had gone to a brotheI.
I'd had my first drink.
said goodbye to one friend and buried another.
in 1936, when I was coming to the end of the 1 7th year of my Iife,
I packed my bag, said goodbye.
Bye, Benjamin. -Goodbye.
I knew, Iife being what it was, I'd probabIy never see them again.
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.
good luck to you, son. -Thank you.
l love you, Mama. -l love you, too, baby.
l want you to say your prayers every night, hear?
be safe, hear?
where you going? -To sea.
l'll send you a postcard.
from everywhere.
write me a postcard from everywhere.
can you imagine?
he sent me a postcard from everywhere he went.
every place he worked.
newfoundland. Baffin Bay.
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.
he had gone with that Captain Mike.
captain Mike had contracted for three years with Moran Brothers Tug and SaIvage.
the oId ship had been refitted with a dieseI engine and a new sea winch.
we went around FIorida and up the AtIantic seaboard.
we were a crew of seven now. Captain Mike and me.
cookie, Prentiss Mayes from WiImington, DeIaware.
the Brody twins, Rick and Vic, who got aIong fine at sea but, for some reason, once they were on dry Iand couIdn't stand the sight of each other.
you know, one in every eight boats never returns.
there was John Grimm, who sure fit his name.
all hands lost at sea.
from BeIvedere, South Dakota.
and PIeasant Curtis from AsheviIIe, Notch.
never said a word to anyone, except himseIf.
l wrote him constantly.
l wrote him constantly.
I toId him I had been invited to audition in New York City for the SchooI of American BaIIet.
please stay.
thank you. Thank you.
you can stay.
but I was reIegated to the corps.
another dancing gypsy.
how is it when you showed up you were no bigger than a bollard with one foot in the grave, but now, either l drink a hell of a lot more than l think l do, or you sprouted?
what's your secret?
well, Captain, you do drink a lot.
we stayed in a smaII hoteI with a grand name, The Winter PaIace.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
the hummingbird is not just another bird.
lts heart rate's 1200 beats per minute.
lts wings beat 80 times a second.
lf you was to stop their wings from beating, it would be dead in less than 10 seconds.
this is no ordinary bird.
this is a frickin' miracle.
they slowed down their wings with moving pictures, and you know what they saw?
their wingtips are doing that.
you know what the figure eight is the mathematical symbol for?
lnfinity.
lnfinity!
everybody, no matter what differences they had, the Ianguages, the coIor of their skin, had one thing in common.
they were drunk every singIe night.
three, please.
could you hold, dear, for us, please?
thank you very much. Good evening.
her name was EIizabeth Abbott.
she was not beautifuI. She was pIain as paper.
but she was pretty as any picture to me.
what are you looking at?
lf you must know, we have a longstanding agreement never to go to bed sober.
lsn't that right, darling? -Whatever you say, darling.
her husband was WaIter Abbott.
he was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk, and he was a spy.
darling. -Oh, thank you, my darling.
key, darling. -Oh, yes.
l broke my heel off one of my shoes.
l'm not in the habit of walking about in my stocking feet.
they were Iong days there.
and even Ionger nights.
one particuIar night, I was having troubIe sIeeping.
l'm sorry.
l couldn't sleep.
l was gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
Oh, no. Thank you.
milk? Honey?
a bit of honey, please.
l hope you like flies in your honey.
Oh, perhaps not.
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.
steep?
soak.
l don't know, l mean, there's a proper way of making tea.
well, where l'm from, people just want it to be hot.
well, quite right.
now, you're a seaman. -A sailor.
l hope you won't think me impolite, but l have to ask, aren't you a little old to be working on a boat?
there's no age limit, as long as you can do the work.
and you have trouble sleeping? Thank you.
l didn't think l did. l usually sleep like a baby.
something's been keeping me up.
my father, in his 80s, he was so convinced he was gonna die in his sleep, he limited himself to having afternoon naps.
he was so determined he was gonna cheat death.
did he? -Did he what?
die in his sleep?
he died sitting in his favorite chair listening to his favorite program on the wireless.
he must have known something.
my husband's the British Trade Minister, and we've been here for 14 months.
good God. -We were supposed to go to Peking but it never seemed to work out.
have you been in the Far East?
no. l've never been anywhere, really.
l mean, outside of harbors.
and where is it that you're from?
new Orleans. Louisiana.
l didn't know there was another.
and she toId me about aII the pIaces she had been, and what she had seen.
and we taIked tiII just before the dawn.
l'm just a lush, myself.
and we went back to our rooms, to our separate Iives.
but every night, we'd meet again in that Iobby.
a hoteI in the middIe of the night can be a magicaI pIace.
a mouse running, and stopping.
a radiator hissing.
a curtain bIowing.
there's something peacefuI, even comforting knowing that the peopIe you Iove are asIeep in their beds where nothing can harm them.
EIizabeth and I wouId Iose track of the night untiI just before daybreak.
l think l may have given you the wrong impression.
beg pardon?
well, married women don't customarily sit around in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels.
l wouldn't know what a married woman does or doesn't do.
good night.
Murmansk.
'l've met somebody, and l've fallen in love. "
mom?
that was over 60 years ago.
did you love him, Mother?
what does a girl know about love?
well...
l'm not dressed. -Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.
don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk, 'cause they're really completely ordinary, but the caviar and the vodka are sublime and plentiful.
so.
savor it.
and don't eat it all at once, because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy.
and now, take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth.
you haven't been with many women, have you?
not on Sundays.
and you've never had caviar before, have you?
no, ma'am.
when l was 19, l attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel.
Really?
but the current that day was so strong that, for every stroke l took, l was pushed back two.
I was in the water for 32 hours.
and when l was two miles from Calais, it started to rain.
that's it! Steady on!
when I couIdn't go any further, l stopped.
I just stopped.
and everybody asked me, would l try again?
for why wouIdn't I?
but l never did.
as a matter of fact, l've never done anything with my life after that.
your hands are so coarse.
l can feel the wind in your cheek.
l'm afraid it's the witching hour.
it was the first time a woman had ever kissed me.
it's something you never forget.
l think you make me feel younger.
you make me feel years younger, too.
l wish l was.
so many things l'd change.
l'd undo all my mistakes.
what mistakes?
l kept waiting, you know?
thinking that l'd do something to change my circumstances.
do something.
such an awful waste. You never get it back.
wasted time.
lf we're going to have an affair, you're never to look at me during the day.
and we're always to part before sunrise.
and we will never say " l love you. "
those are the rules.
are you cold? -l'm freezing.
Oh, you! You're frozen.
what an idiot, l'm standing here in this fur. How thoughtless of me.
she was the first woman that ever Ioved me.
you want me to skip some?
no, l'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm.
'l couldn't wait to see her again. "
we saw each other every night.
we aIways used the same room.
but each time seemed new and different.
come here.
good night.
untiI one night.
yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which wiII Iive in infamy...
lt's a meeting, a policy meeting regarding your future, possibly beyond.
there's been a change of plan, lads.
as you may or may not know, the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday.
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked each of us to do our part.
the CheIsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy.
to repair, to salvage, and to rescue.
anybody doesn't want to go to war, now is the time to say so.
once you set foot on that boat, you're in the Navy, friend.
Yeah, l've been meaning to talk with you, Mike.
my wife's doing poorly.
l'd like to maybe see her one more time.
you're free to make your way home any way you can, Mr. Mayes.
well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?
food poisoning's one of the leading causes of death at sea.
right after inadequate safety equipment.
l can cook, Captain. Been doing it all my life.
l don't know. You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.
what the hell?
l'll take any man wants to kick the shite out of the Japs and the Huns.
that's it, pack your gear. We're going to war, gentlemen!
she had Ieft a note.
she wrote, "It was nice to have met you.
and that was it.
it wasn't the war any of us expected.
we wouId just tow crippIed ships, scraps of metaI, reaIIy.
if there was a war, we didn't see it.
there was a man assigned to us. The Chief Gunner Ioved the Navy.
but most of aII, he Ioved America.
there is no other country in the world.
when you spell America...
his name was Dennis Smith, and he was a fuII-bIooded Cherokee.

and it's already a good day.
Beth.
rob, what are you doing? Nothing.
well, then stop. Nothing.
that's... Stop it.
she's shy.
I could just see this ending up on the lnternet.
well, fine, cover up. See if I care.
I'm interested in other things. Like what?
like you.
Oh, man. That was close.
do it really... I'm scared of it.
it's only 30 minutes out. Shut up. I've never been.
you've never been to Coney Island?
Oh, how have you never been to Coney Island?
I don't know, I just... I've never been.
Oh, that's... It's so much fun. I'm taking you. We're going.
Oh, my God. You're so excited about this.
Yeah, I can't wait to... Give me this.
what are you doing? What?
Oh, all right. Well, then from the neck up, okay?
that's the only way I consent to this.
Oh, please, Rob, nobody's paying for that online.
you've never been to Twelve Chest Hairs. com, have you?
okay. What else? What else, what?
other than cotton candy and TiItawhirls?
what do you want to do today? lf I answer that...
all right, is this thing on? Look out!
babe, it's not my camera.
I don't know if it's the on button or the zoom button.
all right. Here, here, here. I think l got it. Is this on?
Oh, perfect. And now we can have a nice record of you getting run over.
is that funny?
what time is everybody starting to show up?
it's getting late here. A couple hours.
that's why we have to hurry. Where are we going?
we're going... We're just going around the corner to the store!
I want you to go around with your brother's camera and get testimonials from everyone.
Why? I mean, it's not like this is a wedding.
I know it's not a wedding. I said like a wedding.
I can't get this.
I don't get... I mean, I don't understand why I have to do it.
cause, I mean, I don't... I don't even know how to work this...
that's what I think is gonna happen. No, I'm not!
you totally are. You... You have no clue!
okay, well, let me ask you a question.
can you see me through the viewfinder?
Yeah. Got you.
good. Now can you see me trying to carry these bags all by myself?
you're doing a great job.
here, practice doing two things at once.
that's good! That was good. Thank you.
I'm not lugging this thing around all night long. He is your brother.
this is important. Stop freaking out.
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!
no, it isn't. Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!
Jason, I have been planning this for two weeks!
all I want you to do is help me. Okay, babe, babe.
okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.
I really pissed her off.
babe, come on. I was just kidding! Come on!
Hud? Hud, listen to me. I got a job for you.
I already have got a job.
I'm doing the sign, so... Yeah, no. I see that, but this is more important than the sign. You know how, like, at weddings, people give testimonials to the camera, right?
no.
all right. You're gonna take the camera and just, you know, go around the party and film people wishing Rob good luck.
I don't know, man.
that's a lot of responsibility. This is important.
and then you have to do it the whole night...
and Marlena's gonna be here.
she is? Oh, yeah. She is.
so you're gonna take that. Oh, hold on.
and you're gonna talk to her... I didn't...
for Rob. I didn't say I would do it.
just try it out. All right, I'll do a few.
you can, just do mine...
are you ready? Yeah, go.
all right.
rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.
best of luck in Japan. I love you so much, and I'm proud of you.
that's it. That's it?
Yeah. Easy enough. Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.
you enjoy it, Hud. Thanks, man.
Yeah, I'm doing...
Hey, what's up, man?
Hey, guys? Hey.
what do we say? Anything.
bon voyage, Rob. Or however you say that in Japanese.
Yeah, good. Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...
Hud, what are you doing? I'm documenting the night.
but I thought I asked Jason to do that.
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it, so I've been doing it.
I've been doing it really well.
well, are you gonna take it seriously, though?
because it's really important.
no, of course. I've been taking it really, really seriously.
very seriously. You promise?
Yeah, you wanna do your testimonial now?
okay. Yeah, do it right now.
okay.
okay, just open up to him, 'cause this is gonna be the last thing he sees you...
okay, Hud, I got it.
robert Hawkins,
I can't believe you're leaving me to look after your brother by myself.
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean I'm obviously standing right here...
and I know we're not officially family, yet, but...
not fair, 'cause I'm gonna... Dude.
okay. I'll cut him out later.
but I think of you as my brother, and I hope you think of me as a sister.
so, you better call us.
now that you have this job, you can afford to call us, so...
Hud? Yeah.
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good. You're good. You're good.
that was good! That's it?
I thought that was really, really good.
Yeah, but you weren't even paying attention for...
okay. Okay, you can do this.
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.
what's up, man? Hey, what's up, dude?
what's up?
excuse me! Hey, Marlena?
Hey, what's up? Hi. Hi.
Hey, did you know that I'm going around the party and I'm... Do you know Rob's leaving?
like it's his going away party. Yeah. Yeah.
cool. Hey, so we're taping, I think, people talking about him.
Oh, no, thank you. I barely even know Rob.
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily, so it's a little weird, if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.
okay, cool, except I'm supposed to get everybody.
so have you ever been to a wedding?
no, I get what you're doing. I just... I don't want to do it, but thank you.
okay, cool. We'll just do a short one real quick.
okay.
Hey, Rob, Marlena.
I think we've met, like, probably three times before, total, and every one of those times I was really drunk, so I don't really even know what to say.
but you have a cool job! That's something!
like you're president of something! Vice president!
also really cool.
so good luck with that and we're gonna be here keeping New York really safe and fun for you when you come back.
cool, that was a really good one. Yeah?
Yeah, we can do another one if you want.
do you actually have, like a card or something?
well, my agency... We're leaving.
we're going on this stupid retreat and they like all this video, like, bonding crap. Oh, yeah. I'm actually...
I'm not a professional. What?
I'm not a professional. I'm Hud. Hug?
no, no, no, Hud. I'm Rob and Lily's friend.
we met, like, several times before. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you have the camera in front of your face, it's probably why I didn't... Okay, here. If l move it?
Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally. Yeah.
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.
really good to see you. Really good. So what have you been up to?
I actually... I'm gonna just go grab some food, but good luck with the...
I could still do your agency's retreat if you wanted...
he's coming up the stairs right now. Everybody get ready. Get ready.
can someone turn down the music, please?
surprise! Surprise!
no, no, no, no, no, no!
how did you guys plan all this?
easy, you're naive. Let's go.
Hey. How are you? Take this. Take this.
I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you. What's up?
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.
what's up, man? Speech!
Yeah, speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Oh, this is very surprising... I hope so.
obviously. It's a surprise party.
Yeah.
but it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?
it was everyone. It was everyone.
no, thank you, everyone. Thank you. It's...
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it. That's all l got. I don't know.
have a good time! Yeah, party!
Yeah!
Hey, man. Were you surprised? Yo. l was, like, not even surprised.
no? Can you describe your current emotions right now?
I don't know. I would say blase. Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.
no, you're not. Well, congrats.
no, man, that was awesome, dude.
what are you doing with the video camera by the way? I'm documenting the night so that you can take it to Japan with you.
Oh, can I watch it every night when I get there? Jason asked if I...
Yeah, you could. Oh, good.
all right, thank you. Cool.
Hey, Hud, do you know if Beth's coming tonight?
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her. Why wouldn't she be here?
so how are you gonna survive without Rob?
he's like your main dude. Yeah, I know.
Hey, how am I gonna survive without you?
I don't know. I'm like your main dude. Straight up.
as I make my... I'm not here. Hi, Hud.
I'm just documenting. Not here.
that was my biggest problem is that she picked him...
you know what. No, but when he said My Fair Lady
I love My Fair Lady I was like, " Really? "
that was wonderful. But, I mean, it worked out, right?
Beth, hey! You made it.
it doesn't matter, dude, you're here. All is well.
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.
enjoy it. Have fun. Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...
who is that guy? I don't know. He's random.
here, I'm gonna go check it out. Look out, documenting.
Oh, thanks.
I missed your surprise. Oh, that's okay.
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems. I'm really sorry.
that's fine. Decorating's mine.
no, that's fantastic. Rob, this is Travis.
Hi. Hi. Oh, pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you.
congratulations, by the way. Thank you.
vice President. That's fantastic. I love your dress.
thank you. I love yours. Yeah, thank you.
that's really amazing.

Hey, I'm documenting the night. I'm Hud.
okay. So, there's tons of sake.
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.
enjoy, everybody. It's good to meet you.

I think he just said I was cute. Are they dating?
Yeah.
Hey, is everything cool, man? Yeah, everything's cool.
okay, because... I don't know, because you been over here kind of...
is that my camera?
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.
did you switch the tape? Because I had a tape in there.
I don't know. Was...
rollercoasters are fun, but, like, any kind of teacuppy thing...
tape was in here when I got it. Why?
rob, why? No, it doesn't matter.
it doesn't... It's stupid.
okay, are you sure you're cool? Because you're really weirding me out.
like, we haven't been hanging out or anything.
here. Here, man. Come on. All right, cool. That's more like it.
excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
what's wrong with you? Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob. Do you want to say something?
Oh, Hud, I don't know. It's not a really good time right now.
come on, he's leaving.
I mean, can we... I know.
you're not gonna be able to talk to him for a while.
isn't there something you wanna say?
you know what? Travis, can you get me a drink?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Is that... Okay.
cool, thanks.
okay, let's... Right here? I don't...
no, we can do it in the kitchen. Okay, perfect.
okay.
okay.
rob,
I didn't want to do this on camera.
but, I just... I just want you to know how happy I am for you, because I know how hard you've worked for this job and I know how much it means to you and...
and I'm really gonna miss you.
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
Jason? There's something totally weird going on with Rob and Beth.
what are you talking about? I'm serious. They're right outside.
Hud! Not now. Okay. I'll check it out.
you never even called me, Rob!
you go and bring some guy to my party?
hold on! You haven't talked to me in weeks!
Hud, man! Come on! Sorry!
what? What? I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.
but I'm documenting! Not this.
Lily, do you know what they were fighting about?
Lily, if you know, you have to tell me. Lily.
I'm not telling you.
I really should know, as the guy documenting this.
she was the one who brought me back inside.
okay, fine. We'll go find out. I'm positive. l promise.
we'll ask her. We'll go find out. She's in the kitchen.
what? Lil!
Lil, do you have something to tell us?
no. You do, don't you?
what? No. Hud, you're a genius.
you're dodging the question right now. There is nothing to tell you.
nothing. Liar.
Lily, if you know something, you have to tell us.
no. Look at me.
Lily. I know you. Babe.
okay, fine, but not on camera. I'm not telling you on camera.
okay, that's not a problem. All right, no problem.
why would we say anything?
we won't say anything. Rob and Beth slept together.
are you serious? It happened a few weeks ago.
Beth made me promise not to say anything.
are you kidding me, Lily?
rob and Beth sleep together, you're not gonna tell me?
why wouldn't you tell me? Why wouldn't l tell you?
okay, you guys, don't ask me where l heard this.
rob and Beth totally had sex together.
I knew it. Are you kidding me?
no, I'm not kidding. This is extremely serious.
Hey, Marlena.
it's me, Hud, from before. Hi. Right.
did you know that Rob and Beth had sex?
no. Yeah, isn't that crazy?
they've been friends forever. Crazy.
I mean, Rob's been in love with her since college.
well, maybe it was like a going away present, you know?
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed to get presents?
they did. They had sexual intercourse. What?
Lily told me. No way.
no, you are so... No, I promise.
why do you make up stuff like that?
no, I do not. I have a nice car. You make shit up.
I didn't say what kind...
Hey.
good luck in Japan, Rob.
good luck tonight, Travis.
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude. Are you all right, man?
Hey. Come on. This is not the time, Hud.
what is it, man? Let him go.
we should talk to him. We're not talking to him.
I could talk to him now.
dude, you already talked to the whole party!
...have to do something. No. Everyone needs to just calm down and give him space. He's just gonna stay locked in his room all night? Lily, look at you.
it's fine, trust me. It is not fine.
it is fine. You are his brother.
you are his best friend. Go and make him happy.
so, how do you wanna do this? Do you wanna do most of the talking, or do you want me to do most of the talking?
you're not doing any talking. Okay, cool.
we got to talk.
you don't know what you're talking about, all right? Okay, well, then tell me.
it was just a spur of the moment thing.
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori that after you guys got together, you totally blew her off. I didn't blow her off!
she said you never called her.
look, I'm leaving, all right? So what am I supposed to do?
I don't know, man. She was heartbroken.
look, there's no " together. " It's just her and me, two separate things.
it's better if we just stay friends.
...not that I feel like I'm not good enough for her!
no, stop, stop! I didn't say " feel, " Rob.
you're not good enough for her.
that's it. That's fact. That's science.
Beth Mclntyre is, like, from a whole 'nother planet, man.
she's beautiful. She's charming. And you... I love you, but let's face it, you're kind of a douchebag.
and going to Japan is not gonna fix that. She's crazy about you, bro.
like, right now, as you are. And you're in love with her.
but you got to go after her. It's not that simple.
no, it is that simple, Rob. Come on, man. Don't be scared.
it's about moments, man. That's all that...
you got to learn to say, " Forget the world, "
and hang on to the people that you care about the most.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. What the hell was that?
that scared the shit out of me.
Lil! Lil!
did you feel that? It was like an earthquake.
you guys... Lil, where are you?
what was that? What was that?
Hey. Are you all right? Oh, my God.
Yeah, that was really scary. Did you see anything?
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?
guys, look out!
okay. It was like a bomb.
all right, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?
but now, just approximately Shut up, shut up.
15 minutes after word guys! Come on.
of a possible earthquake in lower Manhattan
nearby, in New York Harbor, we're getting word of an oil tanker capsizing in the middle of the harbor near the Statue of Liberty
once again dude, that's really close.
there's no way to know if any that's really, really close.
that's true. Do you think we could see something from the roof?
I don't know. Maybe. J, wanna go to the roof?
let's go see if we can see something on the roof.
come on, Jason. We're not going up to the roof.
Yeah, let's go up there. I don't think we should.
No! That was really...
what do you think? Think it's another terrorist attack?
it's insane, man. Watch your step.
it was shaking everywhere, man. Just like tremors.
Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
is this the only lights that went out?
I think they blew up the trains. No, a couple did.
some stayed on. Oh, man. What is going on?
maybe you should've left town a little bit earlier, right?
shut up.
Oh, my God!
no, no, no.
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hud. Move. Hud!
Oh, God.
rob, you got a set of keys? Get out of here!
right, did you look back? Did anybody get hurt?
did anybody see Jason or not? I don't know.
did anybody see Jason? Has anybody seen Jason?
did anybody see Jason? Is he inside?
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
you gotta take your stuff and we gotta get out of here, man!
I'm telling you!
I'm so sorry. Where were you?
Hey, did you guys see that? Did you guys just see that?
go! Let's go!
Hey, get down! Get down! You all right? You all right?
Yeah, did you guys see that?

Lily, just wait here!
Hey, Rob! Rob! Where's he going, dude?
Jason! Rob. Rob!
Oh, my God. Marlena? Oh, God.

what? That's the sound it's making.
you said you saw something, right? So what did you see?
you said it was alive? What was it?

Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!
well, then rewind it. Rewind it. Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...
it's gonna be a great opportunity for you.
Yeah, but I don't even speak the language.
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

it'll be fine. Do you really think I should go?
Oh, my God. That makes no sense.
that makes no sense. Did you see it?
I don't know what it was, of course! It was giant.

I'm not yelling at you, all right? Yes, you are!
Hey, guys, guys, come on! Everybody just calm down!

all right? We don't know what we saw! The point is it's still here!
all right? So we need to get the hell out of Manhattan!
now. Yeah, yeah.
and out to the Brooklyn Bridge. I think it's the best plan.
it's a straight shot to Delancey. Just take the Williamsburg.
no. Do you know how far that is? Brooklyn is right there.
no, no, no, dude. It's so much closer. It's right here.

well, Bob, the military will not let us get too close, but from what we can see, there's clearly a sizable mobilization of troops and equipment, and they're trying to get everyone to leave the area.
to be honest, Tom, your guess is as good as mine at this point.
there appears to be something coming off of it
and the ground seems to be covered in debris.
it looks like there's something falling of it, doesn't it?
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.
there are pieces falling all over the street
Oh, my God. Whatever they are, they are moving
Oh, my God! They're Donna!
they're right there! Oh, shit.
Donna, can you hear us? Hey!
what are you doing? We got to get out of here! Where is he?
I know, that's what I've been telling him.
Rob! Rob! I've been trying to do that!
rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?
the military's evacuating everyone. Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?
we gotta get out of here.
it's time to leave the electronics store. Rob, come on. We got to go.
just come on. Let's go... Just stop it!
okay? Stop, wait!
to listen to your messages...
Rob! Rob! I can't. Oh, God! I can't move...
it fell my apartment. The whole wall fell on me!
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding I can't move
Oh, my God
help me, Rob
to delete this message...
rob, wait up! Rob!
I got your message, and I'm on my way there, okay?
Hey, Rob, listen. You got to think this through, man.
okay? Beth lives in Midtown. Midtown is that way.
guess what else is that way? Will you wait up?
some horrific shit is in Midtown! This is insane, okay?
we're not gonna go near that thing, okay?
we're not gonna go to the middle of the city!
no, we're not. You're not coming with me.
look. Fall in with the military. Fall in with the crowd.
let them escort you out of here.
okay?
Rob! I'm sorry. I got to go.
Rob!
Rob! Listen! Rob, wait a minute!
one of us is gonna have to tackle you, and that's gonna be very uncomfortable for everybody involved!
listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?
look at me. This is not me crazy. All right? I know what I'm doing.
and you can't talk me out of it.
so turn around, go... I'm coming.
I'm coming with you.
Lily, you don't have to do that.
no, I want to. I'm coming.
guys, did you not hear her message?
I mean, even if we get to Beth's, there's a chance that she's already... Shut up.
guys, this is insane.
Rob! You know what I'm talking about, right?
you can't possibly think that this is a good idea.
Rob! Rob!
Rob! Hey... Hold...
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
Yeah, but I don't understand you. Rob, hold up!
look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.
Hud! I'm so sorry.
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911 , see if somebody else can get there? Yeah, I tried!
okay, well. I mean, what about police? Fire department?
I couldn't get through! l tried, I... Okay, it just seems a little...
Oh, shit. Oh, my God!
Oh! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!
Hud! We're gonna go this way! I can't hear you!
subway! What? What?
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Come on! Come on!
this shit is crazy, dude!
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...
Hud! Hud!
are you okay, man? You all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. Come on.
okay. Okay. Oh, God damn. Oh, shit.
what the hell was that?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Did you see that?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Did you see that?
okay.
Hey, look. We can just cross... We can just cross to the other platform, then go up the stairs and see if the other side of the street...
rob, the other side of the street looks the same as this side!
we can wait for there to be a lull, and then make a break for it!
rob, the air caught on fire! Okay?
there's not gonna be a lull!
but if we wait on the other...
listen to me, man, I am with you, okay? I really, really am.
I'm just saying, you gotta listen to what's going on up there.
we can't... Rob, he's right, okay?
we have to wait. We have to wait.
this is insane.
shit!
Oh, God. What? Rob, what?
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.
we're being evacuated right now. The army's here.
we're being evacuated, so don't worry. Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.
we tried to get out of the city, and we took the Brooklyn Bridge, and we were right there when it hit.
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.
I don't know what to say to him.
you know?
like, I feel like I should say something, but I don't know what to say.
I'm not even supposed to be here.
you didn't have to be. I mean, you had your chance in the alley.
you could've left us.
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up with some friends or something, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
this isn't a bad idea. Just walk.
wait, so then... What's going on?
I don't know.
...just go across here. That's good.
Yeah. This is the six.
rob, I don't think the trains are running right now, man.
no, we can just walk the track, see? Yeah.
look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.
we can just walk down the six to Lexington and then walk down
central Park South. You want us to walk in the tunnels?
it's either that or stay here.
I'll walk the tunnels.
I can't see.
it's kind of freaking me out, you know? I think there's a light on the camera.
let me see. There is?
Yeah, right here. See?
okay.
ocean is big, dude.
all I'm saying is a couple of years ago, they found a fish in Madagascar that they thought had been extinct for centuries.
so what? It's been down there this whole time, and nobody noticed?
sure. Maybe it erupted from an ocean trench, you know?
or a crevasse. Crevice. It's just a theory.
