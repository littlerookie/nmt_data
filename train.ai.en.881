come on.
I love you all.
take this.
I'm going back to Ukraine.
I miss Odessa.
I miss you.
I miss you.
be careful, Yuri. Those things you sell kill.
inside.
you're high.
that's true.
Hello, Christian.
Odessa, Ukraine - 1992
during the Cold War, the Red Army stationed nearly one million troops in Ukraine because of its strategic military importance.
the day after The Wall came down...
the paychecks stopped coming.
your papers.
there's nothing better for an arms dealer combination of disgruntled soldiers and warehouses full of weapons.
welcome.
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff would open a lot of armory doors in a lot of military bases.
for a start, he was family.
he was a highly decorated hero of the Red Army, and he was almost permanently shit-faced
I can't just sell you government property, Yuri.
I have to report.
report to who? Moscow?
as of last week
moscow's in a foreign country.
new flag, new boss.
there is no new boss yet.
they're all too busy squabbling over who's gonna get the presidential holiday home at the Black Sea.
it's beautiful.
the ones who know don't care any more and the ones who care don't know.
show me your inventory.
those 45 years of mutual hatred between the East and the West...
had generated the highest weapons buildup in history.
the Soviets had guns coming out of the demon hole.
huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.
how many Kalashnikovs do you have?
forty thousand.
is that a four?
it doesn't look like a four to me.
it's more like a one.
no, it's a four.
it's whatever we say it is.
because no one else will know the difference?
ten thousand Kalashnikovs for a Your stocks are battalion.
your stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.
you should order more from the factory.
someone will work it out.
what happens then?
we'll cut them in.
the end of the Cold War was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing.
the arms bazaar was open.
guided missiles, unguided missiles.
mortars, mines, armored personnel carriers.
whole tank divisions.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
buy six, you get one free.
I even landed a squadron of helicopter gunships.
the most sophisticated fighting machines...
built for a war with America that never happened.
son, get off there before you get hurt.
I can take it apart with my eyes closed.
thanks to me, they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly what Comrade Lenin had in mind when he advocated the redistribution of wealth.
but I wasn't the only one offering a crash course in capitalism.
I had rivals.
inform your commanding officer that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.
you don't know who I am, do you?
I don't give a fuck who you are.
you're late.
so it appears.
thank you.
my pleasure.
you sell guns?
maybe you'd like to come to my room and I'll show you my... cannon.
you look a little lost, Simeon.
is the world changing too fast?
I'm here, aren't I?
not all of you, I think.
you've gotten so rich selling for the CIA you can't seem to get that ideology completely out of your head.
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.
kept the tensions frozen.
now it's harder to determine which side one's on.
things have become more complicated.
no, it's gotten simpler.
there's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore,
I sell to leftists and rightists.
I sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular of customers.
of course, you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen.
this current state of chaos won't last forever.
there'll have to be order.
instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be beneficial if we work together.
what do you think?
what do I think?
I think you are the amateur now, and I think you should go with your instincts.
with your first instinct.
I'm the same man who was not good enough for you before...
and I'm just not good enough for you now.
the problem with gunrunners going to war is that there's no shortage of ammunition.
this was the chaos that the Old Guard had always feared.
as far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.
but they could hardly report me to the Better Business Bureau.
and Ukraine wasn't the only former state...
with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns.
there was Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus...
all there for the taking.
of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal...
nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947, more commonly known as the AK-47... or kalashnikov.
it's the world's most popular assault rifle a weapon all fighters love.
an elegantly simple nine-pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood.
it doesn't break, jam, or overheat.
it will shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand.
it's so easy, even a child can use it and they do.
the Soviets put the gun on a coin.
mozambique put it on their flag.
since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the...
...Russian people's greatest export.
after that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists.
one thing's for sure no one was lining up to buy their cars.
what fucking documents?
you listen to me, Lieutenant.
you keep them there. For as long as you can!
fight You listen to me, Lieutenant.
to the death! Moscow is behind us!
it's an order!
I thought you supposed watching out for these people.
how can I?
you keep selling my helicopters.
you are too greedy, Yuri!
I can't hold him forever.
I've got paperwork.
not for the gunships.
you know the penalty for sanction-busting.
selling the military helicopter is a major violation.
military helicopter.
it's not a military helicopter.
it's a rescue helicopter.
get to work, son.
no problem.
the law's on our side.
all right, let me see your papers.
no-no-no, put that away.
see your papers.
Yuri Orlov.
Mr. Orlov, always In the wrong place at the right time.
what the fuck is this?
we've met before.
off the coast Colombia.
what was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember, was it the Kono or the Kristol?
the crew called that vessel a lot of names.
none repeatable in polite company.
answer the question.
the new MP-5.
would you like a silencer for that?
I need to see your papers.
get the fuck off me.
Dmitri!
the end-user certificate for this aircraft...
states "Burkina Faso.
nice, very nice.
did you type this up yourself?
the helicopter is to be used on humanitarian missions.
Oh, so you're a humanitarian?
Oh, absolutely.
this is a military aircraft.
not anymore. Listen to the nephew!
what can they do with military hardware but convert it to civilian use?
the only way you could die from this baby now is if a food drop hits you.
and this stuff over here, huh?
is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah, but to a different client at a different address.
that's just a coincidence is that it?
do you take me for a complete fucking fool?
not complete, sir.
and while I hesitate to tell your job.
I must point out that when shipped separately, the weapons and the aircraft both comply with current Interpol trade standards and practices.
we both know, that is an obscene bureaucratic loophole that's gonna be closed any goddamn day.
but it's not closed.
and while certain people might interpret this cargo as suspicious, thank God we live in a world, where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.
and men like you respect the rule of law.
I was as guilty as sin, but Valentine couldn't prove it.
and he was the rarest breed of law enforcement officer, the type who knew I was breaking the law, but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.
two DAYS LATER
Valentine wasn't the only one trying to put me out of business.
my uncle had turned down a half dozen rival arms dealers, sometimes with offers better than mine.
but to Dmitri, you couldn't put a price on loyalty.
what was he doing here?
he is hoping to beat your offer.
I told him to go have intercourse with himself.
but Yuri
you need to make more payoffs.
too many know. Don't worry.
there are more VCRs and cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.
even your enemy was admiring that car.
I'm the luckiest man alive.
you are.
hello.
Ava?
Hi, baby.
you forgot what time it is?
sorry, I...
how was that your audition?
they're going in another direction.
direction with someone who can act.
they don't deserve you.
where are you?
is everything okay?
it was a rough day at the office.
come home.
soon. How's Nicki?
he misses you. We both do.
it's lonely without you here.
you know I don't like nights.
ever since my parents...
Yuri, what's that?
a party.
I'd better go.
just wanted to call and hear your voice.
kiss Nicki for me.
I love you.
the pillaging didn't die with my uncle.
after The Wall came down $32 billion billion dollars worth of arms were stolen and resold from Ukraine alone, one of the greatest heists of the 20th Century.
monrovia, Liberia - 1995
the primary market was Africa.
eleven major conflicts involving thirty-two countries in less than a decade...
a gunrunner's wet dream.
at the time, the West couldn't care less.
they had a white war in what was left of Yugoslavia.
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia...
land of the Free. Originally established as a homeland for freed American slaves, it's been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since.
the latest was American-educated, self declared president, Andre Baptiste.
Mr. Yuri!
I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.
my father would like to meet you.
what an honor.
thank him.
but unfortunately I have other business.
it's a shame, it's a very busy schedule.
it is not, as they say, optional.
my father is easily offended.
my schedule just freed up.
president Baptiste was my best customer but I was in no hurry to meet him.
he'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him.
his seven-year civil war has been described...
as a relentless campaign of sadistic wanton violence.
that kind of sums up Andy for me.
the Glock is interesting.
it's made of a polymer composite.
many of my clients feel they can get through airport security without setting off a lot of bells and whistles.
personally I do not recommend that.
on the other hand, if you are looking for a traditional wheel gun, there is no substitute for the six inches of muzzle energy of a. 357 magnum.
and of course, it will never jam.
why did you do that?
what did you say?
now you'll have to buy it.
it's a used gun.
how can I sell a used gun?
a used gun.
a used gun.
that's a good one.
you know there is no discipline with the youth today.
I try to set an example but it is difficult, eh?
personally, I blame MTV.
a used gun.
I think you and I, we can do business.
if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior,
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.
like father, like son.
the guava doesn't fall too far from the tree.
he was also a cannibal.
they say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength.
Monrovia itself was like being on another planet.
planet Monrovia.
from the temperature, it was obviously a planet close to the sun.
I rarely saw another white man, and I never left town alone.
outside town was the edge of hell.
I didn't want to even gaze into it.
this is your hotel. Two stars.
can you bring me the gun of Rambo?
would you like the armor-piercing bullets?
please.
my father left a welcoming present in your room.
enjoy.
my God, she nearly got her head cut off.
when I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.
second floor.
in the most AIDS-infested region of the globe...
where one in four is infected...
Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young lman and a young Naomi in my bed.
and no condom within 100 miles.
Hello, Mr. Yuri.
Hi.
we'd be happy to make you happy.
uh, I can't. I'd love to.
but I can't.
don't worry.
we don't have anything.
how do you know?
do we look like it?
what if I have AIDS?
don't you worry?
you worry too much.
why do you worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?
now...
...how can we make you happy?
by leaving.
these are my Kalashnikov Kids.
my Boy Brigades.
I can see what you are thinking, but we need every man we can get.
even if they're not men?
a bullet from a fourteen-year-old...
...is just as effective as one from a forty-year-old.
often more effective.
no one can stop this bath of blood.
it's not bath of blood.
it's bloodbath.
thank you.
but I prefer it my way.
I am not going to pay your asking price.
we are not a rich people. And besides, the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs.
do you realize in some parts of my country you can get one for the price of a chicken?
but you can't just consider unit price.
you forget ancillary costs.
end-user certificates need to be forged and notarized,
shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired.
not to mention bribes.
you can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.
there's one bribe for the nut, another for the bolt.
Andy... Andy, listen to me.
this is an expensive proposition.
Andy?
I am going to pay you in timber or stones.
I'll take the stones.
it's kind of hard to get a tree trunk into my hand luggage.
I know you're planning a new offensive.
if you can delay a week,
I can get you armored personnel carriers.
they'd greatly reduce your casualties...
...and give you a significant strategic advantage.
you know, they call me the Lord Of War.
but perhaps it is you.
it's not "Lord Of War," it's "Warlord."
thank you, but I prefer it my way.
conflict diamonds are a common currency in West Africa, also referred to as "blood diamonds"
since bloodshed is what they generally finance.
by the late '90s, my wealth had caught up to my lies about my welth.
even surpassed my lies.
I could even afford to become a patron of the arts.
it's just that I can't believe it.
well, of... of course, it's wonderful.
I just...
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.
Yes. Well, that wou-that would be great, too yeah.
it's wonderful. Thank you so much.
it's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.
Aah! That's fantastic.
uh, who bought it?
it's someone important.
they want to remain anonymous.
this is so wonderful! How was your trip?
you know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?
Oh, in bed, I'm sorry. He couldn't stay up.
that's best.
my first painting!
I'm officially an artist!
this calls for a drink. What doesn't?
Hi.
Yuri, this is uh...
candy.
candy. Of course.
any friend of my brother's is a...
friend of my brother's.
you have a beautiful... everything.
Yes, he does.
Yes, I do.
I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight.
okay.
how are you, brother?
well, you know, still the resident family fuckup.
Yeah. Well, I guess someone has to do it.
well.
Hey, Ava knows, right?
I never want to say anything,
she doesn't have to know.
she understands.
she's a survivor, like me.
she may be a survivor, but she's not like you.
really She doesn't know how you pay for all this
we don't talk about it.
how many car salesman talk about their work? Huh?
how many cigarette salesmen?
both their products kill more people every year than mine.
at least mine has a safety switch.
if those guys can leave their work at the office, so can I.
God damn, you are good!
you really are.
you almost had me convinced.
could you...
could you help me out with...
Why?
Why?
Why?
why what?
Why?
Why? I don't know.
why... I don't know.
why what?
Why're you so fucked up all the time?
because I am. I don't know.
I didn't know how much Ava really knew...
and how much she ignored.
she never questioned how a guy in the transport business...
could afford to give her 18 carat diamond earrings.
I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.
mostly, She seemed content that I was a good provider...
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.
despite the other women...
I always made love to Ava as if she was the only one.
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.
it's not called gunrunning for nothing.
you gotta be fast on your feet.
some revolutions blow over the guns even get there.
there's nothing's more expensive for an arms dealer than peace.
truce? What do you mean, truce?
the guns are already on their way.
peace talks.
all right, forget it.
I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.
when they talk about war, they keep their word.
of course, a new breed of gunrunner requires a new breed of cop.
Henry, take Park Avenue.
take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.
Yuri, there are men going through our garbage cans.
well, it's probably just some reporters looking for somebody else.
I have a feeling they don't work for the tabloids.
Yuri...
is there anything I should be worried about?
no, nothing.
nothing?
I love you.
I love you, too.
sir.
I was now the best merchant of death alive.
I didn't own my own plane, I owned a fleet.
running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone, or the lvory Coast at least once a week.
most trips I had phony paperwork.
the deadline was tight and I had to cut corners,
I had no paperwork at all.
but I wasn't overly concerned.
there was hardly any radar over most of Africa and even fewer people to watch it.
...Re-route to Kabala airport...
...on heading zero-two nine.
comply immediately.
Yuri, what the fuck is going on?
Hello, Southern? It's Yuri.
I Sorry to call you on this number.
but I've got Interpol's all over my ass.
I can't know you right now.
it's uh, not a good time.
not a good time?
motherfucker!
Charlie, Echo, India, comply immediately.
this is your last warning.
where was the first fucking warning?
rock your wings if you intend to comply
I'm putting us down.
if you land, we're going away.
I don't have paperwork.
we're in a flying fucking bomb!
they're firing bullets at our bullets.
I'm putting us down.
okay, okay. Fuck!
this is Charlie, Echo, India.
request re-route to Kabala airport, bearing zero-two-nine.
no, not the airport. There the highway.
it's our only hope.
are you fucking mad?
a pothole will set us off.
you underestimate yourself, Alexei.
you're the best.
you're the shit, Alexei, you're the shit!
you're the shit! You're the shit!
of course Alexei wasn't the best.
he'd come forty-second out of forty three at the Moscow Flight School.
Oh, God, what's he doing?
is this guy nuts?
I can't land there, sir.
Kabala's fifteen minutes away.
he can't get far.
I want a truck on the tarmac.
we gonna be okay.
where are you going?
as far from the evidence as we can get.
wait, there's not going to be any evidence!
come here. Come here.
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look.
free sample help yourself, okay? Free sample.
tell yourt friend.
gun for you.
happy times. Come on.
help yourselves. No charge.
everything goes.
guns, guns, guns, yes, come on up!
here! You're having fun now, huh?
come on! Guns, guns, guns! Yes!
bullets, guns, grenades!
take 'em all.
take the whole crate. Go ahead.
gun, grenades, hooray!
bullets! Guns! Grenades!
Yeah.
that one's got your name on it.
you want one, too? Come on.
don't forget the bullets.
don't forget the bullets.
how can you shoot a gun if you don't have bullets?
everything goes for free!
guns, grenades! All you see. Bullets, guns, grenades.
Hooray, hooray!
have the bullets.
what a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport does in a day took a bunch of malnourished Sierra Leonean locals ten minutes.
by the time Agent Valentine got there, you could find more guns on a plane full of Quakers.
Yuri Orlov.
Ow! Fuck!
you run from us?
no, Mbizi. No!
can you run with no legs?
let me make him disappear, Mr Valentine
around here, people disappear all the time.
I can't do that.
look where we are. Who will know?
we will.
he's gonna get what's coming to him.
I'm not as certain.
all right, get up.
what's the charge?
what are you doing in Sierra Leone...
I'm on safari.
yeah? You're hunting wildebeests with a submachine gun?
do you also work with the Park Service?
hunting without a license, is that the charge?
why are we playing games?
you traffic arms.
trade.
trade.
traffic.
you get rich by giving the poorest people on the planet the means to continue killing each other.
do you know why I do what I do?
I mean, there are more prestigious assignments.
keeping track of nuclear arsenals,
you'd think that's more critical to world security, but it's not.
no, nine out of ten war victims today are killed with assault rifles and small like yours.
those nuclear missiles?
they sit in their silos. Your AK-47?
that is the real weapon of mass destruction.
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.
I don't put a gun to anybody's head and make them shoot.
I admit, but shooting war is better for business, but I prefer people to fire my guns and miss.
just as long as they're firing.
can I go now?
you've got nothing on me. Except cuffs.
since you're so concerned with the law, you must know that I'm legally permitted to hold you for twenty- four hours without charging you.
you might ask why I would do that and I can assure you.
it's not because I enjoy your company, because I don't.
no, the reason why
I'll delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours
is I'm delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims.
I don't think of it as taking a day from you...
...but giving a day to them.
some innocent man, woman, or child is going to have an extra day on this earth because you're not free.
so, I will see you in twenty-three hours and fifty-five minutes, hm?
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.
there was nowhere to go.
or maybe he was hoping the locals would tear me apart.
but they were too busy with the plane.
it's like parking your car in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.
you just don't do it.
the way I looked at it it's the way of Africa, maybe life.
everything that comes from the earth eventually returns.
even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo plane.
a gift. For you.
you know, you've arrived just in time.
I was afraid that he might die before you got your chance to kill him.
this man came here hoping to take your place.
is that not so?
no, I'm not here to supply Mr. Baptiste.
I am here to supply his enemies.
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.
he killed your blood... Your uncle...
when he tried to kill you.
no.
no?
you want that I should let him go?
no. I...
you do want him dead.
you just... don't want to have to do it yourself.
so.
we will do this together.
this will be a bonding experience.
you know you can stop this any time that you want.
but I don't think that you do.
just say the word.
say it. Stop.
stop.
I will get you another room, my friend.
with a much nicer view.
he ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.
what?
Brown-brown.
what is it?
a mixture of cocaine and gunpowder.
they give it to the young boys before they do battle.
they'll do anything!
some other time.
I suggest you try it, at least once, Mr. Yuri.
Why?
cause it's your gunpowder.
even before that night,
I'd started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa.
I'd never tried brown-brown before, but then I'd never killed a man, either.
Oh.
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?
I didn't do anything, did I?
you didn't do much.
wait. Are you sick?
Sida? AIDS?
ask the white man. He will know.
sir, will my hand grow back?
Simeon.
remember, Yuri, take sides.
Simeon!
don't! He's Andre's. Fuck Andre!
fuck Andre!
I'm sorry they don't usually do that.
let me look it. Maybe I can fix it.
let me see it. It's the magazine.
give it to me.
fuck you!
I started to feel I'd been cursed.
...the curse of invincibility.
Nicki, please, go to your room.
I don't believe you.
can you prove any of this?
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble to make his business look legitimate.
even to you.
perhaps especially to you.
I don't expect we'll find anything here today.
so what do you want?
I was hoping that you would help me.
I understand that uh...
your parents died tragically?
the illegal firearms used to murder your mother and father were procured from men exactly like your husband.
I'd like you to leave.
okay. Gentlemen.
Ava?
Ava, what's wrong?
I can't wear the clothes.
can't wear the jewelry.
can't drive the car.
can't live in this house.
everything's got blood on it.
blood on it?
what's the matter with you?
don't be so melodramatic.
I'm melodramatic.
I'm a failed actress, remember?
I told you, these people, it's political.
they lie. They're liars.
look at me. They lie to make themselves look good, okay?
you can't trust them.
it's not just them.
don't worry. Your family didn't say anything.
they didn't have to.
I sell people a means to defend themselves. Ava.
that's all.
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.
the guns are bigger than the boys!
there is nothing illegal about what I do!
I don't care if it's legal!
it's wrong!
please, stop.
it makes no difference if I stop.
someone will take my place the next day.
so let them. We have enough.
it's not about the money.
then what is it?
I'm good at it.
I feel like all I've done my whole life is be pretty.
I mean all I've done is be born.
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.
I'm not much good as a mother.
I'm not even that pretty anymore.
I have failed at everything, Yuri.
but I won't fail as a human being.
my enemies had finally found a weapon that could hurt me.
for the next six months,
I stopped running guns.
I went legitimate.
this is an untapped market.
I'm talking over five million cubic meters of timber in the first year alone.
over 100 exploitable species.
the oil?
between you and me, this...
ten thousand barrels a month?
he must be lying. He's talking!
listen, there are gas reserves off the lvory Coast that OPEC doesn't even know about.
the phone numbers all check out.
it's all on the level.
no wonder Valentine was confused.
thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries.
the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make.
the margins are too low.
too many people are doing it.
still, I'd promised Ava.
Yuri, the President of Liberia is on his way up.
he's early.
I'll be back in a minute.
what the fuck are you doing here, Andre?
we are here for peace talks at the United Nations.
so at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?
well, I was beginning to wonder whether that was still your profession.
you know, you're a hard man to get a hold of all of Sudden.
that is a shame.
my son and I were hoping to do a little shopping while in New York.
you know they're watching you.
Yes, I know they blame me.
they blame me for everything, those hypocrites.
there're hunt for a witch.
witch hunt.
hostilities have escalated.
and they are making it very difficult for me to re-supply.
that requires a man of your rare ingenuity.
I can't help you, I'm sorry.
I understand.
but you should know this:
due to our present situation we are compelled to be unusually generous.
so, see you soon, Lord of War.
you still haven't brought me the gun of Rambo.
at four and a half months old...
a human fetus has a reptile's tail...
a remnant of our evolution.
maybe that's what I couldn't escape.
you can fight a lot of enemies and survive, but if you fight your biology, you always lose.
you guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for another ten minutes.
sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
you know, I'm kind of glad you're going.
you've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves.
this oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday.
I'll be back for the weekend.
we'll go somewhere.
the sea.
that would be fun.
come on.
Hey. You trust me, right?
she looked me directly in the eye...
the way I've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials...
government bureaucrats and law enforcement agents.
Yes, I trust you.
and she lied without flinching.
I'll see you, big guy.
bye Papa.
she learned from the best.
have a good trip.
that's him.
where are we going, Mama?
it's a game, honey.
like hide and seek?
Yes.
like hide and seek.
I can always sense when I'm being tailed.
I know what to look for.
but then I'd never been tailed by the woman I love.
I can put myself in Ava's place.
she might've understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social security number...
my birth date, even her birth date, but not Nicolai's.
my son's birthday unlocked what the government would later describe...
...as "a catalogue of carnage.
Nicki, stay right there.
come on, Nicki.
come to see how the other half lives?
I miss your borscht.
mom and Dad say you're clean.
Yeah, you, too.
you went legit, huh?
that's hard to believe.
that's because it's not true.
only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job
I want you to come.
I can't. I've got a girlfriend.
I think she might be the one.
Plus, I'm thinking of opening my own place.
maybe this trip will help.
it's good money.
Yuri, I've given my word.
no one has to know.
tell them we going for a little R and R.
what do you need me for, all of sudden?
west Africa's fucked up.
more than usual.
I can't trust anybody.
I need you to watch my back.
brothers in arms.
monrovia, Liberia - 2001
Yuri! Welcome back.
welcome both of you.
welcome to democracy.
democracy?
what have you been drinking, Andy?
huh, you have not seen the news.
you know they accuse me of rigging elections.
but after this, with your Florida and you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,
now, the U. S. Must shut up forever.
how do you do this, Yuri?
how do you do this, when they are watching all of my airspace?
where there's a will, there's a weapon.
come on, where's my fucking money?
when it is delivered.
it is delivered.
this is not for me.
this is for my neighbors to the west.
the west?
we're going to Sierra Leone.
Oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior will go with you to make the proper introductions.
we have no trucks.
you will.
as soon as we get the food out of them.
gun of Rambo.
Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.
so where are we going?
ruf - the Freedom Fighters.
every faction in Africa calls themselves by the noble names.
liberation-this Patriotic-that,
democratic Republic of-something-or-other.
I guess they can't own up to what they usually are
federation of Worse Oppressors than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.
often, the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves "freedom fighters.
right, I've got 500 units, brand new right out of the box, all as clean as this. What have you got?
God! Oh, Jesus.
God! Oh, Jesus.
Yuri, I need to talk to you.
not now.
now.
excuse me.
what?
we can't do this deal. The fuck we can't!
what's the matter with you?
look, over there.
as soon as we hand over the guns those people are going to die!
it's not our business.
they killed a boy just now as young as Nicki.
what is the holdup?
there is no holdup.
I'll be right there.
vitaly, it's what we always know:
we can't control what they do.
no, no, today we can. Today we can.
Yuri, they're right there!
what do you think they'll do to us if we back out? They'll kill us.
and if we go ahead, what do you think they'll do to them?
we've got to do something.
please, for fuck's sake.
it's not our fight.
please. Brothers in arms.
what is he saying?
it's the deal.
my brother's not happy with the terms.
we'll work it out. It's nothing.
right? It's nothing.
Yeah. Nothing.
you're right. Yuri, you're right.
God, I've got to get my shit together.
this is not our fight.
right.
okay. What's the deal?
300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades.
I thought it was 1200 grenades.
I was so caught up in the deal...
I never realized what was going on in Vitaly's head.
I thought it was 1200 grenades.
confused.
come to think about it, maybe I never understood what was going on in his head.
I beg your pardon.
may I see another stone?
one thing I do understand for certain...
...is that Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning.
never pick up a gun and join the customers.
what are you doing?
something for Yuri.
step away. Slow.
no, Vit!
No! Vit!
only half the guns were gone...
so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.
if I took them, I was lost.
if I left them, I was lost.
the massacre played out exactly how Vitaly predicted.
but then, a half-dozen other massacres happened in Sierra Leone that week.
you can't stop them all.
in my experience, you can't stop any of them.
they say evil prevails when good men fail to act.
what they ought to say is, evil prevails.
I now shared even more in common with the leader of that country God seemed to have forsaken.
we saw something in each other that neither of us liked.
or maybe we were just looking in the mirror.
I paid a Monrovian doctor twenty dollars to remove the lead from Vitaly's body and write a bogus death certificate.
I should've paid more.
I've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition, and the bullet that lands me in jail...
is found under my dead brother's rib.
Yuri Orlov.
we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
let me guess.
this is not about the alcohol or the tobacco.
crimean Restaurant.
Papa?
both my sons are dead.
there are only two tragedies in life.
one is not getting what you want.
the other is getting it.
is this one of yours?
Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.
curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure.
falsifying a death certificate?
that's not gonna hold me.
you're right. As usual, you are right.
have you seen today's paper? Huh?
fake end-user certificates.
cut-out companies, meticulously catalogued.
there is hardly a warlord, dictator, despot anywhere in the world that you're a first-name basis with.
it was your wife your trophy wife that led us to the prize.
it's not her fault.
she's just easier to follow than you are.
may I?
Yeah, go ahead.
enjoy it.
what? This.
tell me I'm everything you despise.
that I'm the personification of evil.
what?
responsible for the breakdown of the fabric of society and world order.
I'm a one-man genocide.
say everything you want to say to me now.
because you don't have long.
are you paying attention?
or are you delusional?
you have broken every arms embargo written.
there is enough here to put you away for consecutive life sentences.
you are going to spend the next ten years of your life going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start serving your time.
I don't think you fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation.
my family has disowned me.
my wife and son have left me.
my brother's dead.
trust me.
I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.
but I promise you,
I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.
you are delusional.
I like you, Jack.
well, maybe not, but I understand you.
let me tell you what's gonna happen.
this way, you can prepare yourself.
okay.
soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside.
in the hall there will be a man who outranks you.
first, he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done that you're making the world a safer place that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion.
and then he'll tell you that I am to be released.
you're gonna protest.
you'll probably threaten to resign.
but in the end, I will be released.
the reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted.
I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.
but some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
and while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss...
...the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day I do in a year...
sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns.
sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So... you call me evil, but unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil.
I would tell you to go to hell.
but I think you're already there.
pleasure doing business with you.
most people are happy just to get out of jail.
I expect to be paid to leave.
I'm not a fool.
I know that just because they needed me that day didn't mean they wouldn't make me a scapegoat the next.
but I was back, doing what I do best.
umbrellas to the Sahara?
sun umbrellas.
you know who's going to inherit the Earth?
arms dealers.
because everyone else is too busy killing each other.
that's the secret to survival.
never go to war.
especially with yourself.
you remember that bamboo field you woke up in when you first got here?
beyond that field, across a ridge, is the heart of the island.
that's where the light is.
that's where he's trying to go, and that's what you have to protect.
how long am i gonna have to do this job?
as long as you can.
drink this.
now you're like me.
this is the well i threw desmond hume into.
looks like someone helped him out.
no, ben, someone helpedmeout. I'm gonna find desmond.
and when i do, i'm gonna destroy the island.
there was a hit-and-run a few days ago at washington tustin high school.
yeah?
I'm the suspect.
good afternoon.
and how are you doing today?
terrific.
I think it's time to leave.
you're with him, and you're with me.
we are going to a concert.
let's go.
do you need somebody to sign for that?
you work here?
I do indeed, brother.
you a priest or somethin'?
or something.
do you mind taking it around the back there?
Yeah, sure. You got it.
just around there. Thank you.
who died?
a man named christian shephard.
christian shephard"? Seriously?
seriously.
friend of yours?
not exactly.
H-hang on a second.
you bust me out of jail and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert, and you won't even tell me why we're here?
no one can tell why you're here, kate.
certainly not me.
you're the one who brought me here.
I'm not talking about the church.
I'm talking abouthere.
Whoareyou?
what do you want?
my name is desmond hume.
and even though you don't realize it, i'm your friend.
and as for what i want...
I want to leave.
leave and gowhere?
let me show you.
you okay?
Yeah.
U?
well, to be honest, doc, i'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.
that makes two of us.
so you're the new jacob, huh?
feel any different?
not really.
well, doc, how about you come down ofe mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?
jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp.
just past it, well, he said i'd find the place that we need to protect.
this place--whats it?
he called it the heart of the island.
all he said was that it's... It's a light.
and that locke smoke thing wants to put it out?
something like that, yeah.
so what if he does?
then that's it for all of us.
but... But if locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
cause he ain't got what he needs.
I'm guessing that'd be desmond.
that's where we were headed before your inauguration.
Sayid said locke tossed him in a well.
jacob didn't say anything to me about desm doesn't sound like he said anything aboutanything.
that's kinda true, dude. He's worse than yoda.
all right, y'all head to your heart of the island, and i'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.
if we leave a trail, can you catch up with us?
hell, yeah, i can.
then be safe.
I'd ask you along, but that'd take all the fun out of me telling you you can't come.
uh, i guess i'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.
I got a bad feeling about this.
I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are, but you understand i can't be held responsible for
Yeah, yeah, whatever, dude.
none of this is ringing a bell, is it?
you, me... Tranquir gun?
you are insane.
okay. Fine. I'm insane.
just wait here.
what if i don't?
then that's your choice.
but if you stick with me... You'll be happy you did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
do no disturb" sign.
who are you?
why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?
uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and i'm re to pick you up.
didn't i make it clear to widmore's other monkey?
I don't care about a sodding concert.
Charlie... Charlie, what if i told you that...
playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do?
would you come then?
SOD off.
okay, dude.
sorry about this.
what was that?
that was charlie.
why did you take the job, jack?
because i was supposed to.
Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?
I took it because the island's all i've got left.
it's the only thing in my life i haven't managed to ruin.
you haven't ruined anything.
nothing is irreversible.
this would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
as long as you're watching, why don't you join us?
what are you dng here, james?
I heard desmond fell in the well, so i came to help him get out.
looks like somebody beat us both to the punch.
Oh, well.
do you know why i'm here?
I'm guessing you need desmond to destroy the island.
that's absolutely right.
then what, smokey? You going down with the ship?
suicide doesn't seem like your style.
I'm not going down with anything.
Butyouand the rest of jacob's little "candidates" absolutely are.
we're not candidates anymore.
I'll be seein' ya.
you're not gonna go after him?
I don't need to.
when you said you were gonna destroy the island, i thought you were speaking figuratively.
because i said i'd leave you in charge once i was gone?
I'm sorry if i left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean.
that being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat.
because once we get desmond to do what we need him to do, i'm gonna sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink.
I think there was a dog here.
morning.
morning. Sleep okay?
Aye.
your camp'lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
I think i'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.
are you gonna talk his ear off, or you gonna get the man some breakfast?
guess i'll go check the traps for fish.
come on. Vincent. Let's go.
so, rose, tell me... How long have the two of you been living here?
well, we built this place in '75, and...
lived here a couple of years, and then the sky lit up again.
so god only knows when in the hell we are now.
so... Desmond... I don't mean to be rude, after you eat, i'm gonna ask you to move on.
we broke our rule with you.
what rule is that?
we don't get involved.
whatever got you tossed inside a well
that's the kind of drama bernard and i don't want to have anything to do with.
fair enough.
looks like you caught something.
I'm sorry.
Hello, rose.
I'll make this simple.
come with menow or i'll kill them both right in front of you.
you don't have to go anywhere with him.
I'll make it hurt.
I want your word you won't touch them.
ever.
done.
then i'll do what you want.
Yes, desmond.
Youwill.
no.
what was that?
what was what?
Linus, can you hear me? Come in.
I found alpert.
damn it.
you okay?
what... What--what happened?
you thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke.
it responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
l-- is he still here?
no. Here.
I've been trying to get linus on the walkie. He won't pick up.
come on. Let's get you some help.
help? Help? Lp from where?
you still have the explosives? The--the c-4?
Yeah. Why?
because we need to go to the other island and finish what we started.
we need to blow up that plane.
detective ford.
Jim, it's me. I think i just saw that jarrah guy.
you at county lockup?
no, i'm at my dad's muse concert benefit thing.
well, it can't be jarrah. I just put him in a van to county an houago.
Really? Because i just called, and they said it never showed up.
what? - Help me out here, jim.
jarrah popped four people in cold blood.
only one witness left the scene alive, right?
some korean woman.
can you make sure she's okay?
Yeah, yeah. Sun paik. Gunshot wound.
she's still over at the hospital.
enjoy your concerttenos.
I'll keep her safe.
am interrupting?
ms. Paik, i'm juliet carlson.
I'm here to make sure your baby's okay.
you must be the daddy.
I'm sorry. You don't speak english.
I'm... I'll try not to talk too much.
okay, you lift up your gown a little bit.
it's a little cold.
okay. Let's take a look.
okay?
there it is.
there's your baby.
do you see that little flutter? Right there?
that's the baby's heartbeat.
perfectly perfect in every way.
I have your amnio results. Everything checked out.
would you lie to know if it's a boy or a girl?
it's a girl.
Yeah.
her name is ji yeon.
that's a lovely name.
and for the record, y-you two speak english just fine.
Congratulations.
easy, bigfoot. It's just me.
I found locke.
son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the islan you had it right, doc.
good news is, desmond got out of that well, so if we can find him before smokey can
it doesn't matter if we find desmond or he does, james.
we're all going to the same place anyway.
then what?
then it ends.
Hello, mr. Locke. - Dr. Shephard.
Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me john.
okay, john.
I thought i'd stop by and say hi before we started e anesthesia.
you nervous?
are you sure this is gonna work?
Yes. I'm very confident that it will.
Really?
well, there's always the chance that i could kill you...
but i'm trying to make you feel better.
okay. Okay, let's do it.
all right.
I'll see you on the other side.
Hey, doctor, back at l. A.X. when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up?
as a matter of fact, i got a phone call this morning.
they, uh, they found the coffin.
Oh, good.
actually, it might be here already.
well, i hope that brings you some peace.
if i can fixyou, mr. Locke, that's all the peace i'll need.
t's gonna be a hell of a storm.
welcome to the club.
what?
you mind?
looks like you got your first gray hair.
what are you smiling about?
I think i just realized that i want to live.
it's good timing.
what was that?
help!
miles, up ahead!
get him some water.
what are you guys doing out here?
we're going to hydra island to blow up a plane.
what do you want to do that for?
because the black smoke wants to get off the island, and we have to stop that thing from leaving.
well, ifweleave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that?
in case you haven't noticed, i'm a pilot.
well, this is gonna be interesting.
you killed them!
that's it. That's it.
you might wanna save your bullets.
so it's you.
Yeah, it's me.
jacob being who he is, i expected to be a little more surprised.
you're sort of the obvious choice, don't you think?
he didn't choose me.
I volunteered.
I assume you're here to stop me.
I can't stop you.
in fact, i,uh, i wanna go with you.
I'm sorry, jack. I think yo a little confused about what i came here to do.
no, i'm not.
no, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest
to the place that i've sworn that i'll protect.
and then youthink you're gonna destroy the island.
I "think"? - That's right.
because that's not what's gonna happen.
then what's gonna happen, jack?
I'm gonna kill you.
how do you plan to do that?
it's a surprise.
okay. Then let's get on with it.
doctor. - Doctor.
I didn't know you were working today.
I just finished.
did you get the tickets for the concert?
Yeah. Right here.
Hey, dad, did you remember the tickets?
I just gave them to your mom.
uh, who's gonna take yours?
well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt claire.
I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
Oh, yeah. It's fine with me.
in fact, i'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married.
well, i'm sure you're gonna love her.
she's extremely pregnant.
good luck on your surgery, doctor.
thank you.
did you pick out a tie?
I did. - Nice.
I'm detective ford, l.A. P.D.
I'm looking for a patient's room--sun paik.
something you wanna share with the rest of us, doc?
what's that?
you said you were gonna kill locke.
what's your surprise?
and how'sthatgonna work?
I'm not sure yet.
I can't believe jacob would've brought him all e way back to this island just so locke could make him destroy it.
so what? Desmond's bait?
no. I think he's a weapon.
that's a hell of a long con, doc.
Jack, desmond... It should just be the three of us from here on.
I believe in you, dude.
it's gonna be a bad one.
We'rre.
this doesn't matter, you know.
excuse me?
him destroying the island, you destroying him... It doesn't matter.
I mean, you're gonna lower me into that light, and i'm gonna go somewhere else
a place where we can be with the ones that we love and not have to ever think about this damn island again.
and you know the best part, jack?
what?
you're in this place.
you know, we sat next to each other on oceanic 815.
it never crashed.
we spoke to each other.
you seemed happy.
you know, maybe i can find a way to bring you there, too.
Desmond, i tried that once.
there are no shortcuts, no do-overs.
what happened, happened.
trust me, i know.
allof this matters.
shall we?
what are we doing here?
I'm not allowed to tell you.
what do you mean, you're "not allowed"?
there are rules, dude.
whose rules?
don't worry about it.
just trust me, okay?
Itrustyou.
and what, may i ask, have i done to deserve your trust?
I think you're a good guy, sayid.
I know a lot of people have told you that you're not.
maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it.
but you can't let other people tell you what you are, dude.
you have to decide that for yourself.
I'm sorry.
you clearly don't knowanythingabout me.
I knowa lotabout you, dude.
looks like a gnarly fight.
Hey, leave my brother alone!
Hey, it's all right.
I just gotpounded, man.
thanks for taking your sweet time.
it takes as long as it takes.
it was a pain in the ass getting her here from australia.
Yeah. But, dude? It was worth it.
should i go get 'em?
let's give 'em a minute.
Linus, are you there?
what the hell's that?
miles, where are you?
we just got to hydra island.
we're on our way to the plane.
miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane!
we're not gonna blow it up. We're gonna fly it the hell off the island.
just get over here now!
what in the hell?
miles, it's kate.
did you say "claire"?
is she okay?
put the gun down.
don't come any closer!
miles, what happened?
miles, are you there?
he sent you to kill me, didn't he?
no, listen. We're not with locke.
why should i believe you?
because we have a real chance to get far, far away from him.
we can be free of everything he ever did to us and never look back.
we can go home.
will you come with us, claire?
no.
all right, we... We lower him down nice and easy.
you know what to do once you get down there?
Aye.
I'll go where the light's brightest.
don't get yourself killed.
this remind you of anything, jack?
what?
Desmond... Going down into a hole in the ground.
if there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it.
it'd be just like old times.
you're not john locke.
you disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him.
turns out he was right about most everything.
I just wish i could've told him that while he was still alive.
he wasn't right aboutanything, jack.
and when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that.
well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.
it's the hospital.
go ahead. I'm sure it's important.
I am so sorry. I will be back as soon as i can.
I know. It's cool. Go.
we'll get to know each other better, i hope?
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
well, i,uh, i guess it's just you and me, kid.
wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up.
what are you doin'?
I'm just following the instructions.
you're in the band, aren't you?
how doyouknow that?
I was shot by a fat man.
it's all right.
excuse me.
Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is?
I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?
I-I think he's in the band.
Yes, yes. Of course.
he's the bass player from drive shaft.
they're accompanying me tonight.
I play piano.
I'm daniel.
I'm charlotte.
it's a great pleasure to meet you, charlotte.
you, too.
well, lead the way.
excuse me. Is this table 23?
Aye.
indeed it is.
you two know each other?
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
may i have your attention, please?
welcome to this very special benefit concert for the golden state natural history museum.
I'm dr. Pierre chang.

I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us.
so let's get to it, shall we?
it is my pleasure to introduce you to mr. Daniel widmore, accompanied by drive shaft.

Yeah. Yeah.
I'm just-- i'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll--i'll be right back.
No! No!
it looks like... You were wrong.
good-bye, jack.
looks like you were wrong, too.
um, hello?
Hello?
uh, do you know where the bathroom is?
uh, can you please get a doctor?
small world, huh?
Yeah, well, what are you doing--mm!
okay. Okay. Okay.
it's okay.
come on. Sit down.
um, i-i think he's coming.
I thought i made it clear that you were to stop this.
perfectly clear.
I chose to ignore you.
ance they know... What then?
then?
we're leaving.
are you going to take my son?
not with me. No.
just breathe, okay?
just breathe, breathe, breathe.
help is on the way.
it's hap--it's happening, like--like, right now.
right now?
um... Okay.
um... I'm gonna get you comfortable.
I want you to relax and breathe, all right?
just relax and breathe.
who are you?
I'm with the band.
listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please?
water and blankets?
all right.
uh... Claire... This is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing.
no, i'm not ready. I'm--i'm really scared.
I'm scared, too, all right?
Reallyscared.
but i'm gonna need you to push because i can't do it withoutyou.
okay?
okay. One, two, three. Push!
good. That's good.
okay, we're gonna try again.
you're doing good.
push!
okay. Push--push again. Push!
it's aaron.
I brought a blanket.
thank you.
it's just a blanket.
then go ahead and bring it to her.
couldn't find any water.
Hi, aaron.
Hey, aaron.
do you understand?
so now what?
get out of the way!
we're gonna get you out of here, all right?
it's too damn heavy! There's no way we're gettin' it off of him!
we have to try!
what is happening?!
I'll tell you what's happening!
locke was right!
Charlie, just give me the baby.
who the hell are you, John?!
aaron's not your responsibility!
where were you when he was born?!
where were you when he was taken?!
you're not his father. You're not his family!
neither are you, Charlie.
I'm sorry!
this is not your island. This is our island.
and the only reason you're living on it is 'cause we let you live on it.
right here, there's a line.
you cross that line.
we go from a misunderstanding to something else.
it's your call, Jack.
Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
I was a cop.
can I ask you something?
sure.
how long do you think it would take to train an army?
is that all of them?
all six of them. Just, uh...
one box of ammo.
at least we don't have to worry about running out anytime, shall we?
Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place.
Oh, I had to take them from Charlie... his hero in stash.
well, I figured it might have the rapeutic value, if it ever came to that.
you're just gonna leave it all in the statues?
you want to breaks even virgin marys?
be my guest. I'm superstitious.
John...The combination.
I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room rather than this being an issue of trust.
well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.
all right, but I think we should agree, Jack, if either of us need to open this door we consult each other first.
Absolutely.
right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down?
Nope. I got it.
all right.
and, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too.
why would I need to do that?
now look who had to relocate to the suburbs.
ain't that just like a woman?
she keeps the house. You get the cheap-ass apartment.
man, I thought these people hated me but I got a hand to you
stealin' a baby, tryin' to drown it?
now that's a new low.
even made Locke take a swing at ya.
hell, that's like getting gandhi to beat his kids.
shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now?
what?
what the hell do you think you're doin'?
you stole these from the hatch.
you stole them from me.
what?
they were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine.
these belong to all of us, Sawyer to the group.
you don't have a stash anymore. - Seriously, doc, you don't wanna do this.
just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened.
are you threatening me?
last chance, doc.
what do you want right now?
just you.
Oh, damn it. - What is it?
uh...I gonna be late for that meeting I told you about.
a meeting, huh? - Yeah.
you got another date, you can just say so.
I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time.
but I appreciate the permission.
back in a flash, Gorgeous.
you weren't exactly supposed to see that.
are you serious?
what? - You're not serious.
you just happen to have a suitcase full of cash, and you go to pick it up and then the lock just happens to break?
give me that. - It's not even real.
newspaper?
are you trying to con me?
what, I ask you what all the money's for, and you do some song and dance about an investment or something and then and then I say "hey, yo, I've got some money.
look, you got me.
good for you.
no harm, no foul.
you should have done your homework.
I didn't take anything from him in the divorce.
I'm not even worth your trouble.
well, shame on me.
I want you to show me what you do.
show me what you do, what you really do.
and what do I do?
show me how to con people, Sawyer.
I like what you've done with the place.
the maid's day off.
you want to move?
I heard jack took your painkillers.
Yeah, well. guess me and the doc are on the outs.
one less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.
maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the hatch.
I know you're hard up for new reading material.
well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair.
I lost my damn glasses on the raft.
you want to read it to me?
what? you got an appointment or something?
all right. "Ten ways to tell if he's a sensitive man.
this oughta be good. - Mornin'.
Hey, John.
now there's a sensitive man.
Claire asked him to sleep down here.
come on. Locke's got himself needs...
just like anyone else.
not everyone is like you, Sawyer.
guess that's why el Jacko and Ana lulu ain't asked me to join their revolution.
what, you didn't hear about their little army?
guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the doc.
you gonna "put the lime inthe coconut drink 'em both up"?
lime in the coconut"?
the song?
what do you want, Hurley?
so I'm over at roseand bernard's tent.
did you know he's a dentist?
well, that's not all he's been holding out on us.
the guy picked up boone's signal from the norwegian plane...
Nigerian.
right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this.
that is a shortwave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie.
Yeah, but can't you switch the blue wire with the red wire, make it stronger?
we tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver, and all we got was the French woman's messageon a loop.
why would I bother?
come on, man, I mean, it's worth...
it's worth nothing. It's a waste of time.
just trying to cheer you up, dude.
I don't need cheering up.
okay, man, sorry. No problem.
hey...
Hey. - Hey.
you get the combo? Nice.
didn't thinkit'd be that easy convincing your palto give it up.
that's the nice thing about you people.
you're not scared enough.
not scared enough?
the same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army.
everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.
trust me, Ana, no one thinks we're safe.
so, Jack...What's the combo?
I was just kidding.
what are you doing out here?
Oh, man! It's really comin' down!
get under here, freckles! - I like the rain!
Yeah, me, too. From under here.
what the hell? - That's sun.
she all right? - She's breathing.
go get Jack. Go get Jack! - Okay.
what happened? - Where's Jack?
was she conscious at all?
did she say anything? - Nothing, not a word.
she's okay. She's okay. She's gonna be all right.
you need to let me take care of her. All right? Please.
how did you find her? - I heard her scream, found her out in the jungle about a half a klick from here.
she was out cold and her hands were tied.
what do you mean, her hands were tied?
they're back.
they told us they would leave us alone.
well, John, it looks like they broke their promise.
we don't even know what happened.
do we need to know?
Where'd you find her?
just outside her garden.
we should take a look around with guns.
no.
no"?
we arm up, we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.
okay.
we'll wait for sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened.
then we're gonna do something about it.
sounds like a plan.
they usually don't leave any trail.
it's worth a look.
let me ask you something.
this whole scenaro make sense to you?
what do you mean?
think about it.
first off, how'd she get away?
woman doesn't weigh a hundred pounds soakin' wet.
she was fightin' for her life. People are capable of almost...
you couldn't get away...
and you versus sun, hot-oil death match, my money's on you, sheena.
thanks for your vote of confidence.
it's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.
no, it's not.
this one's black, different weave.
it's all in the details and they're wrong.
well, if it wasn't them, then who?
what are you saying, one of us did it?
who the hell would want to go after sun?
not much upside in scaring the crap out of 46 people...
unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.
those necklaces are junk, Sawyer.
a 5-year-old could tell that.
they ain't gonna be looking at the necklaces, they gonna be lookin'at the price tags.
it's all in the details, dimples.
what if we get caught?
we ain't gonna get caught.
anybody goes to the cops, only thing they're gonna remember is a guy who looks like he's been in a bar fight.
you're scared, huh?
a little bit.
well, here's the good news, baby. Everybody's scared.
and the thing they're scared of most is missin' an opportunity.
this is all they had. 25 bucks. - Let's try the one down the street.
Hey. You guys want to buy some necklaces?
Where'd you get 'em? - Where do you think?
you want to buy 'em or not?
hell, forget it.
Hey, how much?
hundred a piece. - For any of 'em?
Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.
I'll take the $1, 200 one and the $1, 300 one.
Thanks.
Hey, wait, wait. - Hang on, man.
I'll buy some of those. - Yeah, me, too.
it's dana's birthdaynext week.
they love their jewelry. - This is perfect.
pulse is good. Strong.
you just need to...to watch her.
she's gonna be okay, man.
that bump on her head. Do you think she fellor that someone hit her?
I don't know.
Jack, how well do you know ana Lucia?
Just...the others... I was out there with you.
I heard that man say that if we stayed away they'd leave us alone.
and we've left them alone.
so why would they attack us a few days later?
if it wasn't them, then who was it?
like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia?
I got a couple more people interested in joining up.
yeah? Who?
the big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott.
you mean Steve. Scott's dead.
the point is, after what happened, people are finally willing to do something.
where were you this morning?
lots of places.
during the rainstorm?
you think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed?
now where would you get an idea like that?
sun's awake.
Ohh...
Hey.
how's your head? Any pain, dizziness?
just a little bit.
do you remember anything?
I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up, then it started raining.
then there was a bag over my head, and I was being dragged.
how many were there? - I don't...
I didn't see anything.
I kicked and I fought, and I just ran as fast as I could and then I fell...
gun. Gun.
gun.
relax, okay? You gotta be patient. Patient, okay?
Hey, what's going on?
looks like the good folks of island town are about to form a posse, get themselves armed up.
hell, I wouldn't be surprised if jack didn't findthat horse of yours, start leadin' the charge in a big white hat.
the guns.
this is all her play to get her hands on the guns.
Locke...you need to go and tell him that they're coming.
I need to tell him?
Sawyer, please.
so what's next?
next?
the next play?
I'll show you the pigeon drop.
we already did that...twice.
and the tulsa bag scam and the looky loo.
I want to do a big one.
you want to do a big what?
a big con.
it's called a long con.
okay, a long con.
how does it work?
it works by gettin' somebody to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea.
it's your idea.
but none of that matters, 'cause the one thing we need for the long con we ain't got...
money.
I have money.
sorry, Cassie, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.
remember when I told you that I didn't get anything from the divorce?
Mm-hmm.
I kinda lied.
kinda lied how much?
600 grand.
well, baby, with that kind of money, let's go find an island somewhere sit on a beach, drinkin' mojitos, till we go toes up.
Sawyer, for the first time in my life, I'm actually happy, and it's not really about the action or the money.
it's about doing this with you.
come on. One long con?
and then the mojitos.
I'll think about it.
why don't you think about it in here?
hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doin'.
what are you doin'?
I'm alphabetizing.
sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle.
you figure it's a good time to start the damn dewey decimal system.
good thinkin'.
how can I help you, James?
well, actually, John,
I'm here to help you, give you the heads up.
heads up?
seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs.
you should know he's not alone.
whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo rose.
I'm guessin' everybody's gonna wanna play Cowboys and Indians, and once those gunsare out and about, something tells me they ain't never goin' back in.
why are you telling me this?
cause it'll piss off Jack.
if I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto.
but that won't work. The door will just slow him down.
if Jack wants to get in, he'll get in.
will you help me?
help you what?
move the guns.
move 'em where?
fine. You don't want to trust me? Lots of luck.
but I can't leave the hatch unmanned.
Oh, sure.
you move the guns, and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.
how long till they get here?
well, that ain't my problem, hoss. It's yours.
steak sandwich...two beers.
thank you. - Aw, Shucks, you got a beer for me?
you want one? Ask the lady.
well, hell, I do want one, and, um, could I get a plate of chicken salad, white meat only, and please, god, no celery, OK, sweetheart?
that's how we make it here, darlin'.
so...
tell me you got her.
Yeah, I got her. - All 600 grand?
all 6.
you fell for her.
Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding me.
look, it's got nothin' to do - Hey, I found that bitch.
her name is Cassidy.
well, I waited six months while you and Cassidy played house.
now if you think - I ain't doin' it.
you know what's makin' you stupid right now?
it's your damn hormones.
you think you're in love, but you're not.
you know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James.
you're a con man, just like me, and it's not what you do, it's what you are.
do I make myself clear?
I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.
no, you're gonna do it.
because that girl... she doesn't know you one bit.
but when she finds out who you are who you really are, she's gonna hate your guts.
enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.
wait a minute. You don't walk away now.
you owe me.
you don't want to pay me?
I'll put one in your ear, James...
you and your little friend Cassidy.
what are you doing here?
one second. I'm, like, this close to the high score on "donkey kong.
now... what can I do you for?
Where's Locke?
I don't know.
I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.
Uh-oh, looks like we got ourselves a theft.
who's gonna call the cops? - Where are they?
don't look at me. I was just pushin' a button.
Oh, yeah. I believe these are yours.
no. Sawyer...
John...where are they?
you moved the guns. Where are they?
we had an agreement!
an agreement that you were about to violate, Jack.
Yes, I moved the guns.
where?
where?
where, John? - Are you gonna start handin' 'em out?
how many? Who gets 'em?
how much time before there's an accident...another accident!
I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot. Now he's...
he could be dead for all I know, and that...
that...that was my fault. I take responsibility for that, and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns.
I want two guns, John! - I'm sorry, Jack.
that's the way it's gonna be, Jack. - Two guns.
tell me where they are right now!
you gave him the guns?
no. I hid them.
that's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are.
you two were so busy worryin' about each other.
you never even saw me comin', did ya?
so how 'bout you listen up?
cause I'm only gonna say this once.
you took my stuff.
while I was off tryin' to get us help, get us rescued, you found my stash, and you took it, divvied it up...
my shaving cream, my batteries... even my beer.
and then somethin' else happened.
you decided these two boys here were gonna tell you what to do and when to do it.
well, I'm done taking orders.
and I don't want my stuff back.
shaving cream don't matter.
batteries don't matter.
only thing that matters now...
are guns...
and if you want one, you're gonna have to come to me to get it!
Oh, you want to torture me, don't ya?
show everybody how civilized you are.
go ahead.
but I'll die before I give 'em back.
and then you'll really be screwed, won't you?
a new sheriff in town, boys.
you'd all best get used to it.
what's goin' on? Where were you?
Sawyer, what happened?
you see that black car? - Who is it?
his name's Gordy...my partner.
what partner?
if I don't walk out the frontdoor with that briefcase in the next two minutes, we're both dead.
what happened? That's the guy from the mercado deal?
there is no mercado deal!
I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the Get-go.
you were the long con.
son of A...Go to hell! Go to hell!
you gotta understand - No!
everything that's happened between us in the past six months, all of it...it was real.
get out. You get out!
listen, you can hate me all you want later, but right now you gotta listen to me.
he's gonna kill us, 'cause I told him I wasn't gonna take your money.
Oh, my god.
look, let's just...Okay.
this is what we're gonna do...
I want you to go out back through Evan's yard.
there's a rental car parked out front.
go to Sioux City.
I want you to check in the Sage Flower Motel.
it's off Highway 29.
watch TV, have a drink.
wait for me. I'll be there in the A. M. and it'll all be over.
let me just pack a few - There's no time.
Hey, remember when you said I was all you ever wanted?
well, now you know better.
I love you.
I love you, too.
go. Go.
how'd you do it?
how'd I do what?
locke said they left you in the hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn.
so how'd you get them?
a magician never tells his secrets.
you played us.
you played me.
all that stuff you said about Ana Lucia...
you knew I would go to Jack, and you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.
now how in the world would I know all that?
did you have anything to do with Sun?
what kind of a person you think I am?
what kind of a person do I think you are?
I don't think this has anything to do with guns or with getting your stash back.
I think you want people to hate you.
good thing you don't hate me, freckles.
why do you have to do this?
you run, I con.
a tiger don't change his stripes.
Hey, check this out...
I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases.
it's like a mystery book.
I want to show you something.
cool! You fixed it! - We'll see.
hold on to this. Don't expect anything.
the chances of getting a signal are slim at best.
Static's good, right?
no. Reception is good.
wait, what's that?!
it's Rousseau's signal. - Ah, crap.
but this radiohas a wider bandwidth.
hold it! Stop! Do you hear that?!
that was the...
just a-settin'...
Duke ellington orchestra
featuring cootie... trumpet.
up next on wx...
the glenn miller orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade.
whoa.
you hear how clear that is? It's gotta be close, right?
radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere.
they can travel thousands of miles.
it could be coming from anywhere.
or any time.
just kiddin', dude.
he never saw you, huh?
no. He was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.
hmm.
figured you'd want your friends back.
if I wanted them, I would have taken them before I told you where they were.
that's not why I did it.
it's not, huh?
I wanted him to look like a fool, to feel like a fool.
well, well.
looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.
sun can never find out what I did to her. Never.
don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now.
this idea...all of this, what we did...
what made you...How does someone think of something like that?
now go.
one Mississippi...
two Mississippi...
three Mississippi...
four Mississippi...
five Mississippi...
I'm not a good person, Charlie.
never did a good thing in my life.
you got this thing running yet, buddy?
Nah, but I got your tools all set.
see if we can get this thing started, okay?
I thought we needed a new carburetor.
well, maybe we don'T.
come on. Slide behind the wheel.
we'll fire this up.
what's the matter? Go ahead.
this is stupid.
without a new carburetor, it's not gonna work.
having hope is never stupid.
you gotta believe good things will happen, and then they will.
understand what I'm saying?
in this world, son, you gotta make your own luck.
all right?
come on.
well, what do you want to fix today?
we're gonna have to put that on hold for a little while, 'cause, uh, I gotta go to vegas.
you know, I got some work out there.
W-what about the road trip?
well, the grand canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude.
Hey, I got something for you.
I'm...not supposed to. Mom says.
live a little, hugo.
it's just a cay bar, okay?
all right.
I'll be back before you know it, all right?
all right.- Hold down the fort?
you're my man? All right.
so then the others take the bags f our heads, and we're, like, n the other side of the island...
and they take jack, kate and sawyer someplace, and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away...
which I did...and now everyone's freaked out.
with them gone, and what happened to eko, they're all scared...and I'm scared.
but then I've...been scared most of my time here, anyway...
except when I'm with you.
I miss you, libby.
bloody hell.
dude, you okay?
peachy.
Really?
cause you've kinda been moping the last
look, it's not worth talking about, hurley, okay?
dude, you can tell me anything.
said I was gonna die.
HE--HE--HE told me he has these flashes...
visions, whatever...
and in them, I always die.
so this is the part where you tell me, "it's ridiculous.
don't be daft.
he's a nutter.
I think he might be right...
and I think it might be my fault.
your fault?
I'M...kinda cursed.
death finds me, dude.
is that an arm?
here, vincent.
come here, vincent.
I think we need to get that.
Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle.
you be my guest.
uh, okay.
if I'm not back in three hours, tell somebody.
Vincent, come here!
awesome.
it's everyone's fantasy--winning the lottery
untold millions falling into your lap overnight.
what would you do with all that money?
well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack.
I'm tricia tanaka with hugo reyes, winner of a record $114 million, outside mr. Cluck's chicken shack in diamond bar, which will be having its grand reopening tomorrow.
so, hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is why did you buy mr. Cluck's?
uh...I like chicken.
um, also with us is, uh, hugo's former boss and now employee, randy nations.
that's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, mr. Reyes?
um, okay, so, hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak.
actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too.
my, uh, grandpa tito died of a heart attack, and the first house I bought my mom burnt down.
my friend johnny ran off with my girlfriend starla...
Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
cut.
what the hell was that?
it's a puff piece, mr. Reyes.
do you know what that is?
Yeah.
sorry, tricia tanaka.
um, uh, do you mind if we go inside and, uh, shoot some b-roll?
Oh, I don't know...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can.
Oh, he's just superstitious.
you know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
okay, let's go.
Ugh! God, I hate this.
I always get the stupid stories.
Hey, you sure it's okay?
Yeah, relax.
the safety guards are on the fryers?
dude, those fryers are stone-cold. All right?
we don't even start cooking till tomorrow.
you hear something?
and then pan through the
well, we are out of dharma oat bars.
already? Yep.
did you check behind the powdered milk?
will you pass me the box of cereal?
then I guess we're out of them.
will you...pass me...the cereal?
from now on, I will only speak to you in english.
it's how you will learn.
it will be hard at first...
everyone, hey!
hurley, what is it?
is it the others?
are you okay?
what's going on, man?
car. I found a car...
tipped over in the jungle.
you found A...car.
and we can totally fix it and get it going again.
it's not far. Come on.
why do we need to start a car?
because it'll be fun.
Oh. We could all use some fun.
I mean, after everything that's happened, we need it.
especially you, dude.
so who's with me?
well, I...gotta get some bananas. Sorry.
I don't think so, hurley.
sorry, hurley.
come on! Anyone? We're gonna drive it!
who's coming?
Thanks, dude.
you have no idea what you volunteered for, do you?
come on.
are we there yet?
if we are where I think we are, then our beach should be just through those trees.
we'll be home in about five minutes.
try to contain your excitement, freckles.
forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, james.
well, maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us.
in fact, I'd be surprised if loc-- ow!
Aah! What happened?
stepped on something. Son of a bitch!
looks like A...dart.
how the hell did it get out here?
all right, just relax your foot for a second, okay?
I'm gonna pull it out. on the count of three. You ready?
One...ow!
I thought you said three.
Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part.
I thought I would spare you.
you know, all you have to do is say sorry.
we could start again, give each other a clean slate.
Slate...like on "little house"?
what?
little house on the prairie"?
Laura ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school?
you call it "little house"?
I had mono when I was a kid.
I missed two months of school.
we only got one channel in my trailer.
what are we even talking about?
Ah, we ain't talking about nothing.
and I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
so that's how it's gonna be?
welcome home, sawyer.
welcome home, kate.
Hugo, Is that you, hugo?
Oh, my god.
what happened?
Tricia tanaka's dead. - What?
Mr. Cluck'S...it got hit by a meteor...or an asteroid...
I don't know the difference, but it's gone.
that's crazy.
it's not crazy.
it's the lottery money.
the numbers--I'm cursed.
and now tricia tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault.
Ow! It was an accident.
it's not an accident.
it is a curse.
there's only one way to stop it.
I have to go to australia.
Agaiwith australia?
that's where the numbers came from.
Lenny in the institution-- he told me.
Hugo, hugo, wait.
I can prove to you you're not cursed.
you can? Yes.
come here with me.
I-I have to show you something.
Hey, hugo!
after 17 years, your father has returned.
Hey, wow.
your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars.
just kidding.
Poor...roger.
sorry about your arm, dude.
in. In.
totally.
let's check it out.
dude, roger was on a beer run.
Oh, man, I suck at charades. You want to what?
Oh, you wanna take roger out...
then and turn it over?
cool. I understand!
okay, on three.
we'll get that later.
so when's it gonna happen?
when's what gonna happen?
don't play stupid with me...
brother.
I was drunk.
you know, if I said anything
I have a right to know when I'm gonna die.
it doesn't work like that.
what doesn't work like that?
Hey, oliver twist.
where the hell's my stuff?
what stuff?
Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff.
I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
you drank it?!
well, to be fair, there was, uh...
there was three of us.
Yeah, there was.
you, the munchkin and who else?
Oh, I got it.
we're gonna tip it up.
crafty.
crafty?
Yeah, crafty.
it's like...when you're good at...crafts.
never mind.
Hey, where the hell's my stuff?
what are y'all doing?
dude! You're alive!
alive!
Yeah, yeah, snuffy.
it's good to see you, too.
I'll be damn. Y'all found yourselves a hippie car.
pretty cool, huh?
Sawyer. Jin-bo.
how you doing?
Good...see you.
well, look at that.
somebody's hooked on phonics.
what about jack and kate?
they with you? They all right?
Kate's with me...
but the doc...
they still got him.
okay, it's okay.
it's gonna be all right.
Jack's gonna be all right. We all are.
well, what a relief.
Nah, see, things are getting better.
the car, you coming back safely--it's a sign.
Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.
you're gonna help us fix this thing.
and why in the hell would I do that?
cause there's beer.
why did he say, "don't come back"?
he sacrificed himself so we could escape.
probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
hurley told us they released michael and walt.
Yep. They gave michael a boat.
they took off and never looked back.
did you see any other boats?
no, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
so they can leave the island?
I don't know, john.
this "zoo" where they held you-- is that where they live?
we escaped with one of them-- a kid named karl.
he said that they live on this island.
he could've taken us there, but sawyer let him go.
Why?
you're gonna have to ask sawyer.
Kate, where are you going?
I don't care what jack said.
they've got him, and we have to get him back.
I owe him that...so I'm going to get help.
help from who?
now that's a hell of a jesus.
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.
he knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
wow, that smells like great lasagna.
the trons made it themselves.
hugo found them in bennigan'S.
now they are our butlers.
something wrong, hugo?
your father asked you a question, hugo.
my father?
you're acting like he never left us, like he hasn't been gone for 17 years.
and all of a sudden he shows up?
aren't you at least a little suspicious?
I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
What?!
all these numbers and curs.
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore.
I thought you needed a manly influence, a father to get you to stop this nonsense.
I'm not crazy!
and the only reason he's back is 'cause he wants the money.
Oh, now that hurts.
well, guess what?
there isn't gonna be any money.
ha! Mr. Tron, lady tron.
your services will no longer be needed.
severance.
trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor.
it's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you...die, or worse.
Hugo, what are you doing?
getting rid of it, all of it--the money, the houses, the livestock-- and I'm starting with him.
no, hugo.
your father is staying with us.
staying with us? Where?
it's been 17 years, hugo.
what's been 17 years?
I have needs.
no, no, no!
this can't be happening!
he has to go! He has to! I want him gone!
no, you don'T.
Yeah, I do.
why don't you show your father what you have in the garage, hugo?
I can't believe it.
you saved it. you saved it.
me first now. Come on.
what's up with all this recycling?
you got me, dude.
looks like those dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road.
Whoo! Ha ha! Now we're talkin'.
looks good to me.
engine's fine, right?
son of-- what's a head doing back here?
Oh, that's just roger.
I'm gonna start the car now!
dude, even if you were speaking english,
I wouldn't understand a word you're saying.
just relax. We're good. This'll work.
I have hope.
this will work.
damn it.
it's flat, and it stinks.
can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
chill out. Let the man do his thing.
dude, that beer's been sitting there since before "rocky iii, " maybe even "ii." It's probably poison by now.
skeletor seems to like it.
bottoms up.
that's not cool, dude.
that guy had a mom, a family and friends.
Oh, and a name.
not skeletor-- it's roger workman.
it's work man, you blockhead.
that's his job.
he was a dharma janitor.
Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can you fix it?
no. No fix.
but you have to.
I mean, can't you try, dude?
I mean, we gotta get this running.
Hey, leave the man alone. He's right."No fix.
take a look at that mess.
there's no way it's gonna get running.
how thick are you?
what's your problem, man?
Why--why don't you want this to work?
I don't care if it works.
why is it so important to you?
because we could all use a little hope.
if it's hope you're looking for, ese, you're on the wrong damn islan.
cause there sure as hell ain't no hope here.
come on, hugo, time to get up.
come on! Rise and shine. Hit the deck.
come on, we're burning daylight. Let's go.
what's with the earphones?
it's for the noise.
Oh, well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
that is disgusting.
come on. We're going on an adventure. Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
look, just do this one thing with me.
if it doesn't work, you can go to australia.
I won't stop you. Okay?
what one thing?
we're gonna break the curse.
this is stupid.
just give her a chance, man.
cut the deck, please.
you've recently come into a great deal of money.
could've seen that on the news.
but it hasn't brought you happiness.
no, it's brought you great misfortune.
she didn't see that on the news.
I'm seeing numbers.
what numbers?
there's darkness around these numbers...
great tragedy.
I'm...I'm sorry.
what? What is it?
Death...surrounds you...
and more is coming.
your hands, please.
there's a curse on you...
but it can be removed.
now, hugo, I need you to remove your clothes.
my clothes?
a curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you, and it must be exorcised.
did my dad put you up to this?
what?
Hugo, please.
I'll give you $1, 000 right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
the mystic arts are not subject to bribes.
how dare you-- $10, 000.
your dad put me up to it.
I was just trying to help.
help who?
beer. beer.
bingo. Beautiful.
car. Car.
okay international house of pancakes.
what are you doing over there?
I'm praying.
praying for what?
help.
well, hell, I got you a little help right here.
du! Hey, dude.
stop moping. Come on.
I'm not moping. I'm thinking.
when people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like, they're moping.
so get up and come with me.
that car I found-- we're getting it running.
what's the point?
Ow! What did you do that for?
snap out of it.
stop feeling sorry for yourself 'cause someone said you're gonna die.
I got an idea that's gonna help us both.
Now...it is dangerous, and there's a very good chance that you will die.
this is supposed to convince me to come with you?
it is, 'cause if you don't die, then we win.
win?
look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately, and I could really use a victory.
so let's get one, dude.
let's get this car started.
let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man.
let's make our own luck.
what do you y?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
okay, nice. Keep it coming.
Uh...you...were...right.
okay. That's two. Hit me.
those pants don't make you look fat.
now you got it-- the only three things a woman needs to hear.
come on, get up. We got work to do.
what's your problem, jumbotron?
shut up, red...neck...man.
Touche.
what's jimy cricket doing here?
we need another man.
another man for what?
to push this car, dude.
push it? Push it where?
go, go, go, go.
Oh, this is gonna be real good.
so you're going to australia, huh?
long way to go 'cause some stupid numbers
I'd really like you to leave.
when your mom called me about the lottery,
I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up.
I'm getting old.
Yeah, I-I saw my retirement.
you're right.
I'm here for the money.
well, you're not getting any of it.
well, that's not why I'm here talking to you now.
I'm here talking to you now because going to australia's not gonna break any curse.
you don't need to leave.
you just...you need a little hope.
we make our own luck, hugo.
you know what I think you should do?
what?
I think you should give away the money
all of it, every penny.
just save enough for A...a carburetor.
work on the camaro, you kn, just you and me.
take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the grand canyon.
never too late for a fresh start.
I'll send you a postcard from sydney.
Hey...I'll be here when you get back.
are you nuts?
you're not gonna drive down that.
we're gonna jump-start it.
you guys are gonna push it, and then on the way down,
I'm gonna pop the clutch and get it started.
you see those rocks?
all you're gonna do is crash into those real fast, if you don't roll over first.
hurley, no.
dudes, I know how to drive.
now come on. Just push me. This will work. I know it.
and what are you out here for
watch him crash and burn?
I came to ride shotgun.
well, it's your funeral.
come on. Let's give 'em their ride.
are you sure you want to do this?
victory or death.
push!
Whoa! Whoa, jeez! Careful now.
here we go.
now would be a good time, hurley.
like right now!
there is no curse.
you make your own luck.
you make your own luck.
there is no curse!
son of a bitch.
Kate, if you were looking for help to find jack, why didn't you ask us?
two reasons-- you don't know where to look, and you're not motivated.
and I don't blame you.
why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get jack back?
you're wrong.
Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after
not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look.
we got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it, it'll lead us right to him.
how?
because of theay the sunlight hit mr. Eko's stick when john was burying him.
so now you know our secret.
how about you tell us yours?
No! Don't shoot!...
it's all right! It's safe!
we're just here to talk!
you can come out!
what are you doing here?
I came to ask for your help to do what?
m heading to the others' camp, and if I'm gonna find it,
I need someone who knows the island.
what makes you think I have an interest in helping you?
because they had me, and they would have never let me go.
they probably would've killed me if I hadn't escaped.
and the girl who helped me escape...
she was about 16 years old.
and her name was alex.
I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
it is a truth generally acknowledged that we are all longing to escape.
I escape always to my favourite book, Pride And Prejudice.
I've read it so many times now the words just say themselves in my head and it's like a window opening.
it's like I'm actually there.
it's become a place I know so... intimately.
I can see that world, I can... touch it.
I can see Darcy.
whoa, Amanda!
now, where was I?
I have no right to complain about my life.
I want this account... de-jointed, yeah? I want her name gone.
I mean, it's the same for everybody.
and I... I do what we all do. - Did you get a suck?
do you want a slap?
I take it on the chin, and patch myself up with Jane Austen.
I know I sound like this... terrible loser.
I mean, I do actually have a boyfriend.
it's just... sometimes I'd rather stay in with Elizabeth Bennet.
piranha! I thought you weren't here. - I'm not. Michael coming round?
no.
why isn't he coming round? - Boys' night.
he'll be round after that. - No, he won't. I've told him not to.
I have plans that involve nobody except me. IE, not you either. So go away.
how do I look? - You put your lipstick on by eating it.
this is as good as it gets.
you are mistaken, Mr Darcy, "if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way "than as it spared me the concern "which I might have felt in refusing you...
. had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.
I just want to read my book.
what are you doing?
is this you proposing to me?
you're drunk.
marry me, babes.
make an honest woman of me.
you have no idea, do you, quite how unromantic that is?
this is most extraordinary.
but I beg you, Miss Spencer, to entertain my explanation of it, for it will be truthful, if a little intractable to believe.
there is a door, Miss Spencer, in the attic portion of my father's house, which is a place unvisited except by servants and myself.
were this door to open, it would give upon the empty air four storeys high, for there is no room beyond.
it is a door entirely without sense.
one may not pass through it, try as one might, until this day, for you, Miss Spencer, have opened this door for me.
you are the key.
what makes you think my name is Spencer?
it is tailored in your underthings.
my name is Price, Amanda Price.
how do you do, Miss Price? I am Elizabeth...
Bennet. - Bennet. Yes, I know.
mands? - Just a minute!
OK, Elizabeth Bennet in my bathroom.
clearly I'm hallucinating.
Why? Too much Austen?
my mother would say not enough boyfriend.
he doesn't take drugs, he doesn't knock you about.
this place is a mess.
it's called redecorating. It's what women my age do when they get divorced.
it's like sex, only you can stop for a cup of tea and a biscuit.
give me a cigarette. - Mm-mm, no.
you're telling me who I have to marry.
I'm reminding you, Amanda, that you are what you are.
if you waste your life pretending to be something else, you'll regret it.
I don't trust him, Mum. - He had it off with a waitress...
two nights running. -. but he's a man.
he has appetites.
I have this conversation with Piranha on a regular basis, and she never gets it.
I'm not hung up about Darcy.
I do not sit at home with the pause button and Colin Firth in clingy pants.
I love...
the love story.
I love Elizabeth.
I love... the manners and the language...
and the courtesy.
it's become part of who I am and what I want.
I'm saying, Mum, that I have standards.
well, you have standards, pet.
I hope they help you on with your coat when you're 70.
l, who have valued myself on my abilities...
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister...
..and we are engaged.
lt is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.
is this not astonishing?
were such a thing at my disposal,
I should do little else but toy with it all day.
miss Bennet. I think I may be having a nervous breakdown.
you see,
I am a real person and you are a pretend person.
you are the creation of Jane Austen. - I am not acquainted with this person.
you are a character in a book.
this one, written by her 200 years ago.
it grieves me, Miss Price, that I must presume to dispute with you.
I have my fleshy envelope, as you yours.
tell me something I couldn't possibly know. Please.
a piece of information that simply doesn't exist in my brain. Just do it.
Netherfield Park is let. - No, no, I know that.
the news was fetched only this morning. I have told no one but Lady Ambrosia.
I know about Mr Darcy, everything.
but you don't. You haven't met him yet.
OK, something else. Please.
the part of Russian America that most intrudes into the Arctic Sea is called Point Barrow.
I have never heard of Russian America.
it occupies the northernmost territory in the west of the Americas.
but that's Alaska. - I've never heard of Alaska.
show me the door, Miss Bennet.
that's not a door. I mean, it could have been a door but it's part of the wall.
it's got all the pipey stuff behind there, the plumbing.
yet it is the way I entered.
I don't understand.
nor I, Miss Price.
but this is assuredly my house.
sorry, Miss, but are you dining tonight?
mr Bennet likes to know what number to expect at table.
please advise Mr Bennet that I will be down... directly.
I was just, um... Iooking for him.
Yes, ma'am.
whom shall I say has given the master this message, ma'am?
a friend of Miss Elizabeth.
OK, this is seriously weird and I want to go home.
Oh, Lydia.
I have said if I am to be received at Netherfield,
I shall dress in silk, so I shall!
Lydia, as your father has civilly declined to call on Mr Bingley, the notion of such an excursion is entirely reprehensible.
split my windpipe! I mean, god heavens.
forgive me.
but the noise in this... palace of lunacy is more than a reading man can bear.
so you are...
..Elizabeth's friend.
Yes. Amanda Price.
sir.
how marvellous to have the society of ladies who are not promiscuous with speech.
allow me to introduce myself across the wasteland of the servants' stairs.
I am Elizabeth's father, Claude Bennet.
Claude? You're kidding.
it exposed me to some comments, but it was the name my parents chose.
so you are not a local person, Miss Price?
I rent in Hammersmith. It's an area of London.
I have driven through a pleasant place that bears the name, - but it was some miles from London. - It would have been.
and you are acquainted with Lizzy how?
known Elizabeth for years.
until yesterday I had not heard of you.
it is possible she made many speeches on the subject and I had merely forgot.
old age, Miss Price. I find I cannot recommend it.
my wife.
Lizzy has told you about our thrilling new neighbour?
mr Bingley? - Pleasant enough. Not strong on brains.
I called on Bingley this forenoon. I haven't told my wife that.
but she enjoys the suspense.
we really are right at the beginning, aren't we?
you do make the most refreshingly elliptical conversation, Miss Price.
so Lizzy has gone to Hammersmith to see you, but you have come to Longbourn to see her.
you will forgive me for observing that the arrangement seems to have a flaw.
Oh, dear, are you quite well? - I do feel a bit... unusual.
might I go back upstairs? - Of course.
we can dissect this matter further on the morrow.
take Lizzy's bed. She claims it is tolerable soft.
sleep well in it. - Thank you.
well, I call it perverse.
mr Bingham's here... - Bingley, Mama.
..and your father, what kind of...
I said Bingley. You said Bingham.
if you contradict me, you will go to your room.
I'm as likely to meet a husband there as anywhere in this house.
Oh, Lydia, sit down at once! Mr Bennet!
Oh, am I here?
miss Price. - Oh!
I did not mean to startle you. - No, no, no, it's, um...
Papa sent us to see that you knew Lizzy's room, but clearly you're...
Yes! Thank you.
you're... Kitty, aren't you?
and you're... Mary. I've read so much about you, I feel I know you.
read? - Heard.
talking to Elizabeth, who is my...
..friend.
is there anything we can get you, Miss Price? A dish of faggots?
all right for faggots, thank you.
I think I'll just, um...
..go to sleep.
right.
Oh! Mr Bennet!
lend me your handkerchief, Lizzy.
you're Miss Price of Hammersmith. - Yes.
I thought you felt funny. I often get into bed with Lizzy in the night.
she strokes my back when it's time to wake.
Oh, I'm Lydia, by the way.
I know.
what preparation do you use for your hair? It's most pungent.
OK, look, I've had enough of this.
what's the deal here? Are we live on cable or something?
is this like the Jim Carrey thing, but period? Where are the cameras?
well, come on! What are you after, guys?
a bit of girl-on-girl action under the covers?
what do I have to do to get out of here? Snog her?
show you my pubes?
what have you done to yourself?
that's called a landing strip, Lydia.
standard... pubic topiary.
the fit of her britches is extraordinary.
the britches are as nothing, but an hour...
good morning. - Good morning, Miss Price.
did you sleep? - I did. Thank you.
please, sit here next to me.
I'm Jane. My sisters I think you've already met.
there is chocolate and green tea and marmalade, for which hill makes exceptional toast.
I'm sorry we cannot offer you anything more amusing.
it all sounds... heavenly.
your tunic, Miss Price, it is what is worn in town this season?
I think it very fine. - Kitty, you are importunate.
I am starved of fashion, is all.
this is... otter-hunting kit.
goodness! Are otters routinely hunted in Hammersmith?
Oh, yes.
the belt therefore is for the attachment of knives?
Absolutely. My proper clothes are... you know, coming.
I shouldn't bother. In this house, we may as well take the veil.
all Papa has to do, Jane, is call on Mr Bingley. It's not arduous.
yet to punish us being flibbertigibbets, he will not.
I think you'll find that...
um... - Oh, Mr Bennet!
my mother, Miss Price, is a little indisposed this morning.
I'm sorry to hear that.
she suffers from her nerves. - Yes.
have you met my mother? - I've, um...
yet to have that pleasure.
who's that? - He sits his horse well.
I'll tell you exactly who that is.
Oh, Mr Bingley.
it is unutterably kind of you to call.
common courtesy, madam, neighbours... so forth.
Ah, Bingley. welcome, sir, to the asylum.
what, finished already? You have devoured Rousseau apace.
I found him eminently digestible.
you gentlemen are acquainted? - we've known each other hours.
we lend each other books. It is practically a marriage.
that's Mrs Bennet!
you did not say, Mr Bennet. - I lacked the opportunity.
mr Bingley, and, yes, he's looking at Jane.
if you've words to say in this house, speak 'em up sharp.
now let us sort the sheep from the goats.
my daughters Jane, Mary, Kitty, Lydia.
Elizabeth, the very goatiest, is not here.
in her stead we have Miss Amanda Price.
Oh. Charmed.
charmed.
miss Price is of Hammersmith. - Really?
excellent fox-hunting country, I hear. - well furnished with otters.
shush. - Undoubtedly.
Elizabeth is presently to be found disporting in the otter-strewn thoroughfares of Hammersmith.
miss Price will explain.
Lizzy's gone to my place.
she's, um...
as it were...
trying to write a book.
mm, a novel.
she's tried to write it here, but she finds the life of the house distracting.
my place, it seemed logical that she should dig in there for a day or two.
get something down on paper.
she intimated to me she would be gone for weeks.
did she? well...
anyway, we've...
done a sort of swap.
she's there and I'm, um... here.
but why, Mr Bennet, at such a time like this with...
Lizzy begs your forgiveness for not explaining these plans more thoroughly.
I... I think she wanted it to be a...
you know, surprise.
I call it a marvellous idea, writing. All in favour of that.
are you at all disposed to join the dancing tomorrow night at the assembly rooms?
royally disposed, Mrs Bennet.
I've summoned hordes of friends from London. Quite a party.
he means Darcy. - Did you hear this?
one that could only be enhanced should you consent to join it.
all of you.
too kind, sir, but I must beg to be excused.
large gatherings of society bring me out in hives...
Oh. -..as do small gatherings.
stop looking at me, Bingley. Look at Jane.
it is a pity that Miss Price's portmanteau has failed to appear.
we must endeavour to furnish her with clothes that are a little less provoking of attention.
it's all so exciting.
Lizzy made this for herself.
it's lovely.
what are you thinking, Miss Bennet?
I'm thinking how pretty you shall be for Mr Bingley tomorrow.
never mind the Bingley, bring on the Darcy.
he's the one we want to see.
you know this gentleman to be part of Mr Bingley's party?
I'm guessing out loud. Terrible habit.
I must say, Mr Bingley seemed a very nice man.
he'd be a good person to marry. - Mm.
I'd quite like to clean my teeth. Is that possible?
of course.
the instruments are all ready before you.
see, I've brought birch twigs, powdered salt and a fresh block of chalk.
right. Thank you. Mm.
splendid.
are we going to church?
does it have architectural merit?
probably not. But I doubt that's the point of attendance.
what is to be done with my brother, Mr Darcy? He has doubts.
a gentleman knows God believes in him.
it is his duty to return the compliment.
well, I, however, desire the compliment of your sitting down with me.
you would rather stand in church and have all of the local womanhood fall in love with you.
how we look forward to meeting these fascinating Bennets and Prices at tomorrow's ball.
Caroline. - You must play cards with your sister.
poor Charles.
do you have a Psalter, Miss Price?
er... is that like a picnic thing for seasoning sandwiches?
more for the recitation of Psalms.
not on me.
how kind. Huh!
Mm.
look, you have to tell me.
has there been anyone else like me turning up here?
like you, Miss Price?
bit odd, talks funny, doesn't know how things operate.
not really.
I thought for a minute you were wearing contact lenses.
how do you get those... ringlets?
by the application of hot irons.
I'd be delighted to arrange yours if you'd let me.
no. I may be losing grip on reality, but I'm still in control of my hair.
Ow! - Sorry. Just checking.
what's a sandwich?
mr Collins is a parson. - Our father's cousin. He owns us.
longbourn is entailed to him.
were Papa to die, Mr Collins could put us out like that.
therefore must we marry to be forearmed against the worst.
I should have thought Lizzy might have told you about Mr Collins.
she talks of little else to that fat old sow Ambrosia.
Oh... - We've never met him, of course.
he might be tremendously handsome.
I wouldn't get your hopes up.
do you expect to receive an offer of marriage, Miss Price?
matter of fact, I just had one. - No!
what reply did you make? - I turned him down.
well, I didn't believe he loved me.
Kitty, pass me your kneeler. - why?
you must forgive my accosting you thus but we have not been presented.
you're Charlotte Lucas. - You see you've utterly beguiled me.
Kitty here tells me, "That lady is Lizzy's friend Miss Price,
and I'm at once consumed with jealousy for Lizzy has never told me of you yet you know my name before it is said.
wherefore did Lizzy neglect to tell me about this book?
I never knew her start it.
well, she didn't confide in me either. Originally.
I myself got it from somebody else.
worse and worse.
wicked Lizzy offends us both.
who told you of the book?
er... Lady Ambrosia.
how... characteristically eccentric of our friend to have confided in her, but odder still for Ambrosia to have discussed it with you.
lady Ambrosia is, after all, a corpulent female pig.
what sort of trick is this, Miss Lucas?
what sort of trick are you, Miss Price?
it vexes me exceptionally that Elizabeth should choose to be abroad at such a time as this.
and Hammersmith, Mr Bennet.
is... is Hammersmith a likely sort of place?
I was not aware it was abroad, but I salute your superior command of geography.
Ah.
we are arrived, Miss Price, at a particularly fine prospect.
according to disposition one can marvel at the delicate masonry of the windows or thrill to the wealth of the tenant.
I learned in church from Mrs Lucas that chiefest among Mr Bingley's guests is Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, of Pemberley.
with the reverence befitting all your utterances, my dear.
now kindly explain it to me.
Pemberley! why, 10, 000 a year! - 10, 000!
my joy, accordingly, is unconfined.
Jane, it appears you must now marry Mr Darcy instead of Mr Bingley.
it is not presently my plan, sir, to marry either gentleman.
no, but it is your mother's so choose your hymns.
what say you, Miss Price? Shall Jane be wedded to this Mr Darcy?
Oh, Kitty, you are overstimulated!
but Miss Price is quite Delphic, Mother. She prefigures all.
I have no idea. Perhaps it is Elizabeth who shall be married.
Elizabeth's not here.
I am not... you.
you should be here.
Oh!
there's going to be a ball.
at the ball you meet Darcy.
you have to meet Darcy. Do you understand?
you have to meet him, Elizabeth. It's what happens.
Oh, I'm so looking forward to the prospect of Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.
I hate a man with too much money. - Mary!
that's very modern, and I daresay very clever, but you will oblige me.
last-minute lippy, for luck.
it's all the rage in Hammersmith.
this evening, Miss Bennet, make sure you dance with Mr Bingley.
it's important.
miss Price, you... you really are alarming. Explain your meaning.
I can't. I don't know what will happen if I do.
I'm just saying tonight is supposed to be fun.
so have a lovely time, with Bingley.
let's get to work.
girls!
Oh, it's a post.
ladies! How very splendid you all look.
I'm so pleased you've come.
will you excuse me, Mr Bingley?
I think we all feel it would have been preferable had Miss Price remained in Hammersmith rather than perplexing us here with her radical manners.
I disagree cordially, Mrs Bennet.
I find your guest... refreshing.
thank you. What is this, wine? - Punch, madam.
Oh, no, don't go away.
bit thirsty. Hm!
miss Price, allow me to introduce Miss Bingley.
how do you do?
I am not choking, which must be counted in one's favour.
you're Charles's sister.
one cannot deny the accusation, however unused to being defined in terms of one's brother.
no accusation, Caroline. Your brother's a gentleman.
miss, um... - Lucas.
Lucas tells me you're come up from town, Miss Price.
Hammersmith. - Oh.
miss Price, you are quite flushed.
another refreshing glass, perhaps?
Ooh. - We're both in a dream, Miss Price.
more than you know, Mr Bingley.
now we have collided so fortuitously, may I beg the honour of the next excursion?
you want to dance? Oh, er... I'm afraid that's, um... not possible.
you cannot dance a quadrille? - I cannot dance a quadrille.
then it shall be my happy duty to educate you.
alas, that unrewarding task has been claimed by another.
another? - Mm-hm.
I fear there may have to be a duel. who is to be your dancing master?
name the dog. - Don't say it.
Darcy? -You said it.
are you certain you have that aright, Miss Price?
a most grievous slur has been cast upon your character.
miss Price says she won't dance with me because you've already asked her.
Yes. - Yes? what fresh lunacy is this, sir?
you've never lifted a hoof to dance in your life.
until this evening, I'd not had the honour of being acquainted with Miss Price.
this is an event of some significance, Miss Price. Quite unprecedented.
he regards forms of sudden locomotion as emblematic of ill breeding.
hunting, tennis, rising precipitately from a chair.
when Miss Price and I dance, there shall be nothing sudden.
I can't dance... this sort of dance.
nor I. Together we shall make a shambles.
but we shall do it with such authority they will stare at us to learn the step.
madam?
Oh, um... - Oh.
I don't know what to say.
fortunately, we are obliged only to dance.
look at Miss Price dancing.
why did you say yes?
to spare my friend the humiliation you contrived for him.
I didn't seek to humiliate Mr Bingley.
then your refusal to dance with him was most ill-adapted to its purpose.
I'm drunk. I need a fag.
I've got one fag.
everything I do is wrong. Everything.
please, God, I want to go home.
you even breathe fire.
Oh, gosh!
miss Price, I... - Mr Bingley...
how can I begin?
you and I, we come from... very different worlds, more different than you could possibly imagine.
in my world, Mr Bingley, all I ever do is dream about the loveliness of your world...
. the stately, elegant rituals and pace of courtship, of lovemaking, as you call it, under the gaze of chaperones, of happiness against all odds, and... and marriage.
here I am,
I talk to you for two minutes,
I kiss you and you... you...
so I'm a little...
disappointed in myself, Mr Bingley.
I feel like those guys who discovered that Stone Age tribe, then gave them the common cold, wiped them out.
miss Price, I...
no doubt, Miss Bingley, you and your brother find these young provincial gentlemen lacking in metropolitan refinement?
Oh, the young gentlemen we find the acme of particularity and taste.
it is the ladies of the country whose crassness is unparalleled.
as the mother of many daughters you must find it wearying to have to lead by example.
I do, Miss Bingley. I do!
miss Price, a word.
according to the laws of Christian hospitality, Miss Price,
I may not turn you out of my house.
instead, I shall favour you with a warning.
I do not know how a person like you comes to be so friend-like with Lizzy.
I fear your influence on her.
but as to my other daughters who remain in my care, hear this.
do not obstruct them. - I promise you...
it is not necessary for you to speak. Just listen.
do not obstruct any one of them in her quest for a propitious marriage.
if you do and my estate is lost because of it, something may come over you, Miss Price, like a thief in the night, which may not be quite so agreeable.
well, you're a real ball-breaker. Sorry, you don't know what that...
I understand the sense of your speech well enough, Miss Price.
do you understand mine?
I would dance but it's impossible.
the carriage fills with freezing air. - Shh!
it's all going...
completely... tits-up.
Bingley couldn't even see Jane under his...
Oh! Elizabeth!
open this door!
my dear father, "l pray you, sir, not to trouble your mind about your most headstrong daughter.
l quite flourish in Hammersmith.
l am minded to sojourn here alone a while.
Er..."alone" is underlined.
if I might be so presumptuous as to offer advice to my own father, then I would admonish him to pay particular attention... to Miss Price.
she is intimately acquainted with the doings of our family, and I cordially believe her to be its most devoted and formidable ally.
trust her. Your affectionate daughter, Elizabeth.
when Lizzy was ten years old, I taught her to fly a kite.
she soon mastered it.
she stood between my arms...
in front of me, and took the strain.
I believe she has taken it ever since.
but as for my trust, you have it.
a rare thing, Miss Price, but Kitty is quite right.
you are oracular. - Hm-hm!
you prophesied Mr Darcy would attend the ball and he duly came.
did he prove equal to your expectations?
Yes. And no.
I mean, he's not Colin Firth.
but even Colin Firth isn't Colin Firth.
they had to change the shape of his head with make-up.
but, no, Mr Darcy was pretty spectacularly unfriendly but that's what one would expect.
physically, he fills his britches pretty well, but he doesn't, you know, float my boat.
all that... aristocratic languor.
I know he can't help it, but it's really not very attractive. To me.
he does not... float your boat?
an expression current in Hammersmith, never to be used in front of Lydia.
without Lizzy, the equilibrium of this house is... fragile.
it is fruitless to pretend otherwise.
however, your presence among us affords a certain...
reassurance.
at least to my father.
and to me.
it's very good to have you here.
thank you.
I'm... glad I can be of service to you, while I'm here.
it is not service, Miss Price, it is friendship.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
OK, I have no idea how to fix this book, and I cannot sew this bloody pew thing without stabbing myself in the hand.
Ah, Miss Lucas, how convenient you are.
how glad I am of that, Mrs Bennet.
this is all most industrious.
miss Price, alas, is a stranger to handiwork for the church.
I'm sure she would bless you, were you to take charge of her kneeler.
I may need to unpick all this and start again, Miss Price.
Elizabeth sends news? - She writes to her father, not to me.
she clearly intends to stay in Hammersmith indefinitely.
and how long do you plan to stay here, Miss Price?
I intend to trespass on the hospitality of this household for, er...
for not much more...
time.
I hope you stay forever.
church has had enough from me for today.
let us have tea.
do you show me your finger because it is injured?
I wish to know, Mr Bennet, how long Miss Price is to remain our guest.
she does not materially contribute to the running of this household.
she is unkempt and indelicate... and not at all couth!
she is upsetting the servants with all manner of improper remarks!
in the book, your mother sends Jane to Netherfield on a horse in the rain.
she gets a cold and has to stay the night and that's how Bingley falls in love with her.
but it's not happening.
nothing's happening the way it should.
right. I will do my best.
OK?
for Jane.
mr Bingley instructed you to invite me to visit him?
some men find it hard to speak their love, except through an intermediary.
it's not uncommon.
you must go.
if I set off for Netherfield, Miss Price, it will surely pour with rain.
look at the sky.
the rain will be torrential, and you will get very wet.
this is all how it should be.
trust me.
where has my sister gone? Netherfield.
but there is to be heavy rain. She'll be soaked and catch the grippe.
but this is terrible. The infection goes straight to her chest.
the last time she contracted it...
Oh, foolish girl! She does not know.
doesn't know what? - How close she was to death! Mama!
mama!
Jane has gone to Netherfield Park in this weather and Miss Price pursues her!
are you so obtuse, Mr Bennet, that you do not see what is the matter here?
she has gone to queer Jane's pitch!
it is exciting when you bring the language of the theatre into this house but might this room be returned to the purpose for which it was created?
for me to sleep in undisturbed.
the weather today is uncongenial.
is it?
one tends not to notice
tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon.
no ring cause you're single or because you don't like wearing one?
you asking me if I'm married?
are you married?
no, not anymore.
so tell me, Ana Lucia, why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon?
I hate flying, and they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane.
so where are you sitting?
wanna trade?
I can't do this, ma!
he's not supposed to be mine!
it was never part of the plan.
excuse me, would you mind watching my bag for a moment?
I'll be right back.
sure, whatever.
thank you.
what's going on?
my flight to L. A. Leaves in a couple of hours, so...
you want to do one more bump for the road?
uh...
fate or coincidence?
ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats...
my husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
well, he sounds like a very smart man.
you be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
a plane breaks apart somewhere over the south pacific.
she's not breathing.
watch out.
good. Let it out.
you okay?
Where's my mom?
two groups of passengers survive...
separated on different sides of the same island.
somebody help!
come on! Come on!
big, deep breaths! Big breaths!
move! Move!
get her up!
lost Revelation， excuse me.
would you look after the children?
there is something I have to do.
uh, okay.
stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
recovery...
help! Hey! I need some help!
someone in the jungle is alive!
please help me!
and rescue.
help!
what's your name?
you're gonna be all right, Bernard.
we need to find a safer place.
well, what about the signal fire?
how are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?
they have satellites, the black box.
we don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
before the crash, we were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
they don't know where to look.
you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water?
Yes.
were any of them African-American?
no.
it's my wife.
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
desperation...
and hope...
your husband was in the tail section of the plane?
Yes, he was, but he'll be back.
you think he's still alive?
I know he is.
how?
I just do.
we must have been at about 40, 000 feet when it happened.
hit an air pocket, dropped and blacked out.
I saw the whole thing.
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...
couldn't bring myself to look back...
and then the front end of the plane broke off.
well, it's not here on the beach, neither is the tail.
what are you doing in here? What's in the bag?
booze, smokes, couple "playboys.
what's in yours? - Medicine.
just about sums it up, don't it?
you do this back home, too, steal from the dead?
just not looking' at the big picture, doc.
you're still back in civilization.
and where are you?
I'm in the wild.
do you play checkers with your pop?
no.
I live in Australia with my mom.
she got sick.
she died a couple of weeks ago.
you're having a bad month.
I guess.
just want to know. - Well, you're not gonna know.
what's the big deal?
it's not a big deal.
it's just that you and your tattoos...
don't add up.
so what is it about that guy that makes you all weak in the loins?
do you try to be a pig or it just come naturally?
so he's a doctor, right?
hell, give me a couple of band-aids, a bottle of peroxide,
I could run this island, too.
you're actually comparing yourself to Jack?
the difference between us isn't that big, sweetheart.
are you all right?
no, I'm okay.
it just can't happen.
what?
can't grow up in this place.
what are we looking for again?
any long piece of metal or plastic tubing, anything that looks like it would work as a frame.
am I being punished?
what, you think working with your old man is punishment?
feels like punishment.
this is us taking control of our destiny.
while some prepare to leave...
I think we should go back, man.
suit yourself.
others uncover reasons to stay.
Boone, you need this more than I do.
what is that?
that's what we're gonna find out.
the crash was only the beginning.
this group must now fight to survive attacks by mysterious island inhabitants.
the kids!
they took the kids!
they're gone.
what is that?
it's a list.
a list of what?
of us.
nothing?
they dragged nine people into the jungle, the kids, and there's no sign of them?
now's not a good time to talk?
what needs to happen to make you say something?!
Hey, calm down. Let's figure this out.
here are the names of every single person they took, what they were wearing, what they look like.
one of them had a list of us.
maybe they're watching us.
you were gone for two hours yesterday.
what? - Where were you?
I was going to the bathroom. - Hey, stop.
let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything.
why would they try to infiltrate us? That's crazy.
well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
we need to leave this beach.
five minutes.
we've been walking for three days straight, Ana.
and you're still here.
you want to keep walking, go ahead.
fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees.
right here looks pretty good to me.
Hey.
Hey.
do you really think it's possible that one of us is...
one of them?
why do you think I'm digging this hole?
suspicion turns to paranoia...
Oh, hey, Ana.
but has the real threat been discovered?
what are you doing?
let me out of here right now.
you let me out.
you let me out!
I didn't do anything, Ana!
he wasn't on the plane.
what?
we were in the air for two hours.
I didn't see him once, not once.
it's a big plane, Ana.
just because you didn't-- - no, I didn't see him, either.
Oh, you're not all serious.
he never talks about himself, Nathan.
every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
we should let him go.
we're not savages.
if I were a savage, I would've cut off his finger already.
that's tomorrow.
I'll pull you up.
grab the rope.
ana Lucia's...
I think we all think that she's gonna hurt you.
now you need to get away from here.
there's some fruit in there. Now just go.
what?
he's gone. Nathan's gone.
all right, what are you gonna do?
they found us. It's time to move.
amid violence and deception...
how does a man find redemption?
why aren't you talking?
what is it?
I don't know.
looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
it's a radio.
hello. Can anybody hear me?
the hills are blocking it.
if we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
why do you think they're doing this?
why do I think who's doing what?
them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
no real harm done.
can I ask you something?
sure, Ana.
the day of the crash...
you ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
you weren't wet, you were never even in the ocean.
Nathan, did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
that's why he wasn't on the list.
what about the kids?
did you kill them, too?
the children are fine.
they're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
we're safe here now.
silence and suffering.
how long must they last?
it's going to be okay.
what, you're talking now?
it's been 40 days.
you've been waiting 40 days to talk?
you waited 40 days to cry.
John, people are talking about what we're doing out here every day, especially since we never come back with anything.
what we're doing here is far more important.
right now, this is our priority.
purpose, faith, determination.
where does it all lead?
I had a dream last night.
I asked for a sign, and then I saw a plane crash, a Beechcraft, right out there.
it was a dream, but it was the most real thing I've ever experienced.
I know where to go now.
go for what?
to find what we need to open this bastard up.
Hello? Hello?
can anybody hear me?
where do you think it came from?
he was a priest.
gold teeth, obviously well-off.
what kind of money is that?
nigerian naira.
what is a Nigerian priest doing on an island in the south pacific?
I'm not so sure he's a priest.
is that the plane you saw?
as best I can tell.
what's important is what's inside it.
I'm fine!
do you want to know what's in your damn plane, Locke?
they're drug smugglers, Locke.
heroin. That's all that's in here!
why are you wasting your time with that thing?
there's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
anybody out there?
Mayday, mayday!
is there someone there?
Hello! Hello!
who is that?
can you hear me?
repeat your transmission.
we're survivors of the crash of oceanic flight 815.
please copy!
we're the survivors of flight 815.
no, wait a minute. What are you doing?
it's them.
they're trying to draw us out.
this is our life now.
get used to it.
where did it come from?
based on the maps inside, Nigeria.
the plane was loaded with heroin.
we set sail tomorrow.
I got some packing to do.
why is it so insistence for you to be on that raft?
cause there aren't anything on this island worth staying for.
be safe, Sawyer.
Yeah.
stay with Jack. he'll keep you safe who will keep you safe?
go, go, go, go! - Bye, Vincent!
that's it!
a search for help...
and a search for answers.
how long have you known about this?
three weeks, give or take.
3 weeks.
you've been out here for three weeks digging this thing and you never told me about it?
all due respect, Jack, but since when d do I report to you?
all due respect, John, but you lied.
I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John.
I think that's why you and I don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack, because you're a man of science.
what does that make you?
me?
well, I'm a man of faith.
do you really think all this is an accident?
do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence, especially this place?
we were brought here for a purpose.
and who brought us here, John?
the island.
it's destiny.
I don't believe in destiny.
Yes, you do.
you just don't know it yet.
something's out there.
Hey! Yo!
we're getting saved!
Oh, man, are we glad to see you!
what are you folks doing this far out here?
the plane crashed! We've been on an island for a month, man!
Hey, it's a good thing we found you.
only, the thing is we gonna have to take the boy.
what? What'd you say?
just give us the boy.
I'm not giving you anybody.
well, all right, then.
dad! Dad!
No! Walt! No! - Dad!
help me!
help me
dad, help me!
dad! Help me, dad!
please!
Walt! No!
on this island, the greatest of all mysteries lies beneath the surface...
soon to be revealed.
Kate, you run the fuse.
Jack and I will rig the charges.
how does one look for answers?
how many do we need to blow the hatch?
two should take care of the hinge, three to be safe.
can destiny be found?
or is it better left alone?
one discovery...
I'm not putting down anything.
leads to more questions.
do not move!
Oh, what did you do?
I have to fix it.
what the hell is he talking about?
listen, if you don't let me up, we are gonna die.
stop moving, or I swear to god!
look at the wall!
you see that?!
that's a timer, and it's counting down!
I've gotta push the button!
or what?
what's gonna happen?
another discovery...
get Ana Lucia, quick!
begins to provide answers.
who are you?
how about that?
we're home.
he doesn't even speak English.
that doesn't mean anything.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
he's running!
hold it!
you're gonna tell me what's going on.
just let me-- - look, you want to get it to work, you're gonna tell me how you got here.
it was three years ago.
I was in a solo race around the world, and my boat crashed into the reef and then kelvin came.
Kelvin. He comes running out of the jungle.
hurry, hurry, come with me!
he brings me down here.
first thing he does, cause it's beeping already, he types in the code, he pushes the button, and it stops.
"what was all that about? "I say.
"just saving the world, "he says.
saving the world?
then kelvin died, and now here I am all alone.
the end.
Where's my boy?
you think that makes sense, pushing button?
you're gonna take his word for it?
his word is all we have, Jack.
you don't have to take my word for it.
watch the film.
what?
the bookcase, top shelf, behind "Turn of the Screw."
what do you know?
what did they do to you?
who the hell are they?
grab the rope.
please.
you understand at what he's saying is
it's insane, it's impossible.
why is it insane?
because the last time I saw the computer that was gonna save the world, it didn't look like that.
welcome.
I'm Dr. Marvin candle, and this is the orientation film for station three...
of the dharma initiative.
every 108 minutes, the button must be pushed.
from the moment the alarm sounds, you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor.
now do not attempt to use the computer for anything.
Congratulations.
until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands.
we had a talk, and they believe we were on the plane, too.
Well， Guess we can all sue oceanic together.
he pushed that button every 108 minutes?
he did, indeed.
and after all that time, he just up and left?
I guess he figured he found his replacements.
meaning us.
meaning us.
and what happens if we don't push it?
we're not gonna find out.
Hi. Back where you guys, uh, where you came from, is there a woman named Rose there?
black chick, in her 50s?
She--she... she okay?
Yeah, man, she's okay.
Oh, thank you.
Charlie read me the riot act last night for waking him.
you know, it's like we're playing mom and dad to this baby yet I don't remember marrying him.
no, seriously.
I mean, we're practically strangers, him and me.
for all I know, Charlie could be some religious freak.
Oh, I seriously doubt that.
then why does he carry around a virgin Mary statue?
he says he found it in the jungle.
all right, all of you, get up.
we're moving out.
moving out where?
back to where you came from.
Hey.
Hey.
you, um, you took a shower.
had to see if it worked.
how was it?
smelled a little bit like sulfur, but it was a shower.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
you could use one.
maybe a little later.
I'll leave the shampoo for you.
so what's your name, anyway?
Mr. Eko.
Mr. Eko.
so what's that like, Mr. Ed?
Michael--he just left.
let's go. We're leaving now.
what do you mean, we're leaving?
your buddy ran off into the jungle.
Michael--he just left.
he aren't coming' back without his kid.
he aren't coming back without Walt.
wait.
a search begins.
what are you doing?
I'm going to help him find his friend.
where are you going?
to get some water.
let me.
I'll be right back.
well, that was quick.
I am telling you, I saw Walt.
it was a dream, Shannon. - He was here.
I saw him. He went into the tent.
I was only gone for a few moments.
you must have fallen asleep.
this was not a dream!
the search continues for the father desperate to find his son.
keep slowing us down, we're gonna leave you behind.
go ahead, leave me behind.
all right.
see you.
got a question for you.
now that your tracker's gone, how you gonna find our camp without me?
walk across the island, follow the beaches, and Eko's coming back.
you married?
no.
too bad.
you seem suited for it.
funny.
what about you?
no, madam.
you gay?
funny.
let's go.
what are we waiting' for?
go away! I'm not going back without him.
shouting is not a good idea.
you need to come back with us now.
I'm not leaving him out here.
I know they took your son...
but you have no idea what these people are capable of.
they will not be found if they don't want to be.
they took him right out of my hand.
right out of my hand.
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea, seeing me with the baby.
you and Claire are close and you spend a lot of time with Aaron.
I just wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
she's got a bit to learn about being a mom, responsibility and all.
now that's an interesting thing to say for a heroin addict.
recovering addict.
recovering.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Sawyer, hey.
Mr. Eko, can you help me make a stretcher?
didn't ask you to follow me.
I don't need your help, said.
Walt is not out here.
I saw Walt.
what was that?!
let's go back.
I need you to believe in me.
I do believe in you.
you don't.
I love you.
you hooked it.
try keeping your left arm straight.
so you think you could do better?
anyone can hit a ball.
that's not golf.
and what's golf?
golf is accuracy.
why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate?
two worlds...
about to collide.
what are you doing?
I'm taking him back to his camp.
don't leave.
please. If that were you, he'd let you die.
I'm not doing it for him.
I'm doing it for me.
got it.
you may want to move.
what?
where is the doctor?
I got him. Bathroom.
he's burning up.
gotta get him in the shower and bring his fever down.
hello.
hello.
swallow it, swallow it, swallow it.
damn it.
I'll do it.
no, no, I got it.
I can do it.
it's Kate.
you have to listen to me, okay?
it's the only way that you are going to get better, so you take this pill.
now swallow. Swallow.
good, good.
nice job.
I never learned the whole "whisper in the ear "thing in med school.
confusion...
I'm sorry.
are you?
fear...
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I am not as perfect as you.
what's going on with you?
just forget it.
no, don't walk away from me. - Let go of me.
no. Kate...
it's okay.
it's okay. It's all right.
it's all right.
all right?
what do you do when you want to hold on...
but your instincts tell you to run?
reunion...
but at what price?
remember how to get out there, right?
what do you want?
excuse me?
peace? Revenge? Justice?
and you are going out with all these guns.
what do you want?
I want all of our people back here safely.
your friend murdered-- - Ana Lucia made a mistake.
what did you say?
ana Lucia made a mistake.
two groups separated...
at last reunited.
hello again.
hello.
I have something I think you should see.
on the other side of the island, we found a place much like this.
we found a book.
I believe what's inside there will be of great value to you.
tequila and tonic-- that's your drink, right?
Where's the tonic?
we're running a little low on mixers.
sure you want to waste that on me?
figured you could use a drink.
I know I could.
are you gonna try to convince me that everyone here doesn't hate me?
only if you're gonna try to convince me that every woman in the world's not crazy.
what are the odds?
the odds?
Yeah.
we crash, two halves of the same plane fall on different parts of the island.
you're over there, I'm over here, and now here's the missing piece right back where it belongs.
don't mistake coincidence for fate.
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts.
in this manner, you will both stay as fresh and alert...
...of utmost importance.
here it comes.
now do not attempt to use the computer for anything else other than the entering of the code.
this is its only function.
the isolation that attends the duties associated with station three may tempt you to try and utilize the computer for communication with the outside world.
this is strictly forbidden.
I repeat, do not use the computer for anything other than entering the code.
Congratulations.
until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands.
who is this?
this is Micheal， who is this?
dad?

another KATE WILL POSITION IN THE JUNGLE,
roughly 2 KILOMETERS IN.
and THE THIRD I'LL TAKE TO HIGH GROUND.
where ARE YOU?
Boone: MAYDAY, MAYDAY. ANYBODY OUT THERE?
Hello? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
we're SURVIVORS OF THE CRASH
Boone, GET OUT! OF OCEANIC FLIGHT 815! PLEASE COPY!
John, TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
it FELL
the PLANE.
locke SAID YOU FELL FROM THE CLIFF.
it's CAUSE OF THE HATCH.
what HATCH?
John SAID NOT TO TELL.
what DID LOCKE DO?
Where's SHANNON? - - I DON'T KNOW.
she's HIS SISTER. YOU DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS!
where ARE YOU GOING?
to FIND JOHN LOCKE.
is THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?
sun SAID HE WOULDN'T LET JACK TAKE HIS LEG.
he DIDN'T WANT HIM USING UP THE ANTIBIOTICS.
she SAID HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM,
and HE WAS BRAVE.
man over P. A. THIS IS A SPECIAL SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT.
heathrow AIRPORT AUTHORITY REMINDS TRAVELING PASSENGERS...
okay, SAYID.
18 HOURS IN A HOLDING CELL SHOULD BE ENOUGH.
let's GET TO IT, SHALL WE?
I'm MELISSA COLE FROM CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE.
this IS ROBERT HEWITT FROM THE S. I.S.
we're HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO DO US A FAVOR.
a FAVOR?
last WEEK 300 POUNDS OF C-4 EXPLOSIVES
were STOLEN FROM AN ARMY BASE OUTSIDE OF MELBOURNE.
the MEN RESPONSIBLE ARE MEMBERS OF A TERRORIST.
intent ON DISRUPTING THE COALITION PRESENCE IN IRAQ.
300 POUNDS OF C-4.
I WANT IT BACK.
you're THE CIA. PLANT A FEW BUGS.
Oh, WE HAVE. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET INSIDE FOR US.
I AM IRAQI.
I AM NOT A TERRORIST.
we DIDN'T SNATCH YOU UP BECAUSE YOU WERE A TERRORIST, SAYID.
we SNATCHED YOU UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE.
your ROOMMATE AT KARA UNIVERSITY.
he's A MEMBER OF THE CELL.
and WHY SHOULD I CARE? - - YOU'D BE SAVING LIVES.
I REPEAT, WHY SHOULD I CARE?
because WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
seven YEARS SINCE YOU LEFT IRAQ.
six MONTHS HERE, THREE MONTHS THERE.
always MOVING.
there's ONLY TWO REASONS WHY A MAN WOULD DO THAT, SAYID.
either HE'S RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMETHING
or LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
nobody CALLS HER NOOR.
you WANT TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS?
then WE'RE GOING TO SYDNEY.
Kate, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
looking FOR YOU.
well...you FOUND ME.
you're WALKING IN CIRCLES. YOU NEED TO COME BACK.
not WITHOUT LOCKE.
you HAVEN'T SLEPT. YOU GAVE BOONE OUR OWN BLOOD.
locke LIED. WELL, N
he LIED, KATE.
Boone DID NOT FALL OFF ANY CLIFF.
his LEG WAS CRUSHED.
and I BASED MY MEDICAL TREATMENT ON HIS LIE!
people ARE SCARED AND UPSET.
they DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
we NEED YOU TO COME BACK, JACK.
please?
do YOU WANT TO...
you WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?
no.
Sayid: I DIDN'T KNOW BOONE VERY WELL,
and FOR THAT I'M SORRY.
on OUR SIXTH DAY HERE,
a WOMAN NAMED JOANNA DIED.
she DROWNED.
and BOONE WAS THE FIRST ONE INTO THE WATER.
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM,
but I'LL REMEMBER HIS COURAGE,
and I KNOW HE WILL BE MISSED.
Locke: IT WAS MY FAULT.
we FOUND A PLANE
a BEACHCRAFT
in THE JUNGLE.
it WAS LODGED IN THE CANOPY, SO...
I-I WOULD HAVE GONE UP,
but I
my LEG WAS HURT, SO HE...
there WAS A RADIO INSIDE,
and HE THOUGHT HE COULD...
look...
his WEIGHT MUST HAVE MADE THE PLANE SHIFT,
and THEN IT FELL, AND...
happened BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO HELP US.
he WAS A HERO.
Jack: WHERE WERE YOU?
where WERE YOU?
where THE HELL WERE YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH?!
what DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
what DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
Jack! WHERE WERE YOU? YOU JUST LEFT HIM TO DIE!
where WERE YOU?!
where WERE YOU?!
where WERE YOU?!
Kate: JACK! JACK! JACK... JACK, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
are YOU OKAY? ARE YOU OKAY?
breathe, BREATHE.
breathe. HE'S OKAY.
just BREATHE, JACK.
he's LYING.
you're SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE.
locke TOLD BOONE NOT TO TELL.
not TO TELL ABOUT WHAT?
something ABOUT A HATCH.
locke's HIDING SOMETHING.
Jack, LISTEN
the MAN IS HIDING SOMETHING. JACK, LISTEN TO ME.
what WE NEED IS FOR THE ONE DOCTOR ON THIS ISLAND
to GET SOME SLEEP.
I'm FINE. I DON'T NEED IT.
you NEED SOME REST.
come ON.
it IS YOU.
so YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ME.
hardly.
what ARE YOU DOING IN SYDNEY?
I've BEEN TRAVELING. AND YOU?
I LIVE HERE. ALMOST A YEAR NOW.
I'm A TREE CUTTER.
I CUT TREES.
sounds LIKE GOOD, HONEST WORK.
so MUCH FOR MY PHILOSOPHY DEGREE, HUH?
whatever PUTS FOOD ON YOUR TABLE.
how IS ZARA?
she DIED.
stray BOMB WHILE SHE WAS SHOPPING FOR A DRESS.
I'm SO SORRY.
listen, LISTEN, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
why DON'T YOU COME OVER?
I'd LOVE TO.
damn IT. I'M OUT OF AMMO.
use THE CROWBAR.
that ONLY WORKS ON THE ZOMBIES,
not THE BIG BUGS. INDEED.
the THREE OF YOU LIVE HERE?
Sydney's VERY EXPENSIVE. IT'S THE BEST WE CAN AFFORD.
and WHAT IS IT YOU DO, SAYID?
at THE MOMENT, I'M AT LIBERTY.
he's ON HOLIDAY.
you'll LOVE THE BEACHES HERE. THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.
I've HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING LANDLOCKED
for SEVERAL YEARS.
the LAST BEACH I WAS ALWAYS SHARM
with YOU, ESSAM, REMEMBER?
before OUR ENGLISH EXAMS.
I HEAR THE BEACHES HERE ARE VERY NICE
especially THE WOMEN. PERHAPS WE CAN GO.
so TELL ME
exactly WHAT KIND OF TREES DO YOU CUT?
who ARE YOU?
I WAS A COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.
Sayid WAS REPUBLICAN GUARD. HE KNOWS THINGS.
perhaps IT'S NOT HAPPENSTANCE THAT YOU AND ESSAM MET AT THE MOSQUE.
perhaps IT IS FATE.
it's OKAY.
look, I'M FINE, REALLY, OKAY?
you NEED REST, CLAIRE. SUN, TELL HER.
in A HOSPITAL, THEY WOULD HAVE YOU SLEEP.
the NURSES WOULD TAKE YOUR BABY.
Yeah, BUT I'M NOT IN THE HOSPITAL.
well, ALL THE MORE REASON TO TAKE EXTRA CARE, CLAIRE.
look, IT'S OKAY. I CAN TAKE CARE OF TURNIP HEAD FOR A WHILE.
turnip HEAD?
it's JUST WHAT I'M CALLING HIM TILL YOU GIVE HIM A NAME, CAUSE HIS HEAD... LOOKS LIKE A TURNIP.
look, WHAT IF HE NEEDS SOMETHING, OKAY?
you'll BE THERE FOR HIM AFTER YOU SLEEP.
no, OKAY? NO.
Claire, NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE THIS BABY AWAY FROM YOU.
no ONE.
you DON'T KNOW THAT, OKAY? YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
just BE REALLY CAREFUL, OKAY?
make SURE IF HE GETS HOT, THAT YOU TAKE HIS BLANKET OFF.
his NECK, OKAY? HOLD HIS NECK.
this WAS HIS.
I DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT.
thank YOU.
welcome.
storm COMING.
I SHOULD HAVE SAID NO.
first TIME HE OFFERED TO HUNT WITH ME,
I SHOULD HAVE SAID NO.
he WOULD HAVE GONE ANYWAY.
Yeah, I SUPPOSE HE WOULD HAVE.
I KNOW HOW CONFUSED AND ANGRY YOU MUST BE RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T SAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU LOSE FAMILY.
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.
I'm SORRY.
Shannon: YOU ASKED IF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME.
anything.
John LOCKE KILLED MY BROTHER.
will YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?
a LITTLE MORE.
no. YOU NEED TO GET YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL UP.
all RIGHT, LOOK, ENOUGH ALREADY. I'VE RESTED.
Jack -- I'M FINE.
where ARE YOU GOING?
I'm GONNA GO TALK TO LOCKE.
no, YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN.
no, I DON'T.
I STRONGLY ADVISE IT.
advise.
advice. WHAT
all RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?
lie DOWN, OKAY?
I CRUSHED UP SOME SLEEPING PILLS.
put THEM IN YOUR JUICE.
why WOULD YOU
you DRUGGED ME?
Yeah.
Oh...
okay.
good NIGHT.
Sayid: HOW DID YOU GET THAT?
war WOUND.
looks MORE LIKE A SURGICAL SCAR.
like I SAID, WAR WOUND.
the PLANE'S RADIO
was BOONE ABLE TO PICK UP A SIGNAL?
I WAS ON THE GROUND. ALL I COULD HEAR WAS STATIC.
so IT WAS WORKING?
Yeah, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE IT SURVIVED THE FALL.
some OF ITS PARTS MIGHT WORK
in THE TRANSMITTER I'M BUILDING FOR THE RAFT.
if YOU'D BE WILLING TO TAKE ME.
of COURSE.
Sayid: HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLANE?
luck.
you AND BOONE WERE HUNTING?
is THAT A QUESTION?
Yes.
boar GOT SCARCE A COUPLE WEEKS BACK.
we WEREN'T HUNTING. WE WERE EXPLORING.
so YOU JUST HAPPENED UPON A BEACHCRAFT
perched IN THE TREES?
Yep.
at THE FUNERAL,
you SAID YOUR LEG WAS INJURED.
it WAS JUST A CHARLEY HORSE.
cramp.
I KNOW WHAT A CHARLEY HORSE IS, JOHN.
back IN IRAQ, YOU WERE AN INTERROGATOR.
is THAT A QUESTION?
Yeah.
a LONG TIME AGO I WAS.
well, YOU HAVEN'T LOST YOUR TOUCH.
why WOULD I INTERROGATE YOU, JOHN?
Jack CALLED ME A LIAR
in FRONT OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD I'VE COME TO KNOW OVER THE PAST MONTH.
and MAYBE THERE'S A PART OF YOU THAT THINKS
maybe THERE ISN'T A PLANE OUT HERE AT ALL.
I KNOW WHEN I'M BEING LIED TO.
there's A PLANE.
like I SAID
you HAVEN'T LOST YOUR TOUCH.
you've LOST YOUR EDGE, OLD MAN.
I NEVER HAD ONE WHEN I PLAYED YOU.
were YOU ALWAYS THIS SLOW?
come ON, COME ON, LET'S KEEP PLAYING.
you HAVE TO GET OUT OF THAT DEPARTMENT,
practice MORE.
haddad WOULD LIKE THAT.
more BLENDING IN WITH THE COMMUNITY.
I THINK HE'S GOT HIS EYE ON A TARGET.
what MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
for THE PAST TWO WEEKS, HE'S BEEN ASKING ME ABOUT EXPLOSIVES.
blast RADIUS. TRANSPORT.
haddad's VERY THOROUGH.
do YOU KNOW IF HE'S GOTTEN HOLD OF ANY YET?
explosives? I DON'T KNOW.
all I KNOW IS THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OPERATION,
and THERE IS GOING TO BE A MARTYR.
you.
haddad TOLD ME THIS MORNING.
come ON. LET'S KEEP PLAYING.
come ON, SAYID. COME ON.
Sayid: WHAT IS IT, HUH?
what IS IT?
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.
you're KIDDING ME, RIGHT?
listen TO ME. I CAN GET ESSAM TO TURN HIMSELF IN.
he WANTS OUT. DOES HE KNOW WHERE THE C-4 IS?
the OTHER TWO ARE THE ONES YOU WANT.
does HE KNOW WHERE IT IS?
no.
then HE'S USELESS.
these CELLS RUN TOP DOWN. IT'S ALL NEED-TO-KNOW.
the RECRUIT'S HANDED A BOMB AND A TARGET AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT.
the ONLY WAY TO FIND THAT C-4 IS TO WAIT FOR ESSAM
to WALK OUT THAT DOOR WITH A TARGET TO HIT.
he's IN OVER HIS HEAD.
he DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHY HE'S DOING IT.
that's WHY YOU'RE GONNA CONVINCE HIM TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.
no.
no, I WILL NOT.
excuse ME?
I'm DONE. IT'S OVER.
no, NO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING DONE, MY FRIEND.
we'll ARREST HER.
your GIRLFRIEND'S AN IRAQI LIVING ABROAD
with A RECORD OF INSURGENCY.
wouldn't IT BE TERRIBLE IF SHE GOT PICKED UP AS AN ENEMY COMBATANT, SAYID?
so IF YOU WANT ANY CHANCE OF EVER SEEING HER AGAIN,
you're GONNA GO AND TALK YOUR FRIEND ESSAM
into BLOWING HIMSELF UP.
dude, IT'S "WASHED.
unless THERE'S SOME KIND OF BRITISH VERSION.
Oh, OKAY.
bollocks. SHH. WHAT'S THE MATTER, MAN?
well, I CAN'T GET THE BLOODY THING TO STOP CRYING.
maybe HE'S HUNGRY.
no. I NURSED HIM FIVE TIMES.
made ANY DEPOSITS?
you KNOW, DIAPER-WISE?
all RIGHT.
it's TIME TO BREAK OUT THE BIG GUNS.
Ow!
dude, THAT'S ALL I GOT.
heroin.
the CARGO HOLD'S FULL OF IT.
best I CAN FIGURE, THEY WERE SMUGGLERS.
the PLANE WAS PERCHED ON THE CANOPY?
right UP THERE.
and BOONE CLIMBED UP BY HIMSELF
because OF YOUR CHARLEY HORSE?
Yes, THAT'S RIGHT.
why DID YOU LIE?
I MADE A MISTAKE.
I'm GOING TO SALVAGE WHAT I CAN OF THE RADIO.
if WE LEAVE NOW, WE SHOULD BEAT THE STORM BACK.
why DON'T YOU TRUST ME, SAYID?
for ONE THING,
you've BEEN CARRYING A GUN YOU'VE TOLD NO ONE ABOUT.
we FOUND ONE OF THE SMUGGLERS
about A HALF A KLICK WEST OF HERE
dressed AS A PRIEST,
nigerian CURRENCY IN HIS POCKETS,
and THIS.
now YOU'RE ARMED AND I'M NOT.
does THAT EARN ME ANY TRUST?
you GAVE THIS TO ME
because I CAUGHT YOU CONCEALING IT.
that EARNS YOU ADAPTABILITY.
okay, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.
please DO.
the FIRST WEEK AFTER THE CRASH,
there WAS A CAVE-IN.
Jack WAS TRAPPED. YOU REMEMBER THAT?
of COURSE.
you, KATE, AND SAWYER WENT OUT INTO THE JUNGLE
to TRIANGULATE A SIGNAL.
Yes.
you WERE HIT FROM BEHIND, KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS.
when YOU WOKE UP, THE TRANSCEIVER,
your EQUIPMENT WAS DESTROYED.
that WAS ME.
this IS ONE TIME
you'd BETTER NOT BE TELLING THE TRUTH!
I DID WHAT WAS IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST.
you RUINED MY CHANCE TO FIND THE SOURCE!
the SOURCE OF A DISTRESS CALL THAT KEPT SAYING THEY'RE DEAD,
it KILLED THEM ALL OVER AND OVER?
is THAT A PLACE YOU REALLY WANT TO LEAD PEOPLE TO?
why WAIT ALL THIS TIME? WHY NOT TELL ME THEN?
because BACK THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ENGAGED IN REASONABLE DEBATE.
and NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE.
you WERE ALL SO FOCUSED ON GETTING OFF THE ISLAND
that YOU WEREN'T SEEING THINGS CLEARLY.
it's LIKE THAT'S HAPPENING NOW WITH THE RAFT.
did YOU BURN THE RAFT, JOHN?
no, SAYID, I DIDN'T.
what IS THE HATCH?
the HATCH?
Boone MENTIONED IT BEFORE HE DIED.
a HATCH?
two HATCHES ON A PLANE, SAYID.
could BE FORWARD OR AFT.
I'm NOT SURE IF I CAN DO THIS.
you WOULD NOT BE A MARTYR
if YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OVERCOME FAR, ESSAM.
I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE.
it's ALL THE INNOCENT LIVES.
all THOSE PEOPLE.
the IMAM PREACHES PEACE, SAYID.
that EVERY HUMAN LIFE IS SACRED.
it's TRUE, INNOCENT LIVES WILL BE LOST
in SERVICE OF A GREATER GOOD.
what IF I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M ANGRY?
what IF I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY KILLED HER?
what IF YOU ARE?
should WE JUST ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED TO ZARA?
what ABOUT ALL THE OTHERS LIKE HER?
do WE JUST ACCEPT THEIR DEATHS?
because IF WE DO, IT MEANS ULTIMATELY WE CARE NOTHING ABOUT THEM.
I LOST SOMEONE, TOO, ESSAM.
I WILL NEVER BE WHOLE AGAIN.
there NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE.
that's MY DUTY.
that IS HOW I WILL HONOR HER.
haddad WAS RIGHT.
it WAS FATE THAT BROUGHT US BACK TOGETHER.
will YOU DO THIS WITH ME?
I WILL.
how ARE YOU?
do YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK?
sure.
I SPOKE TO LOCKE.
what DID HE SAY?
he TOOK ME TO THE PLANE.
I BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED WAS AN ACCIDENT.
then WHY DID HE LIE?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
but I DON'T BELIEVE HE MEANT TO HARM BOONE.
so THAT'S IT?
I KNOW HOW STRONG THE NEED CAN BE TO FIND SOMEONE TO BLAME.
you DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?
just FORGET ABOUT IT, OKAY?
how MUCH WEIGHT CAN THIS HOLD?
I DON'T KNOW. A LOT.
enough.
Yeah, YEAH. TIGHTER. GOT IT.
what IF IT TIPS OVER?
it WON'T. THAT'S WHY WE MADE IT THIS WIDE.
there. THAT SHOULD DO IT.
right? GOOD?
good.
all RIGHT.
what IF A SHARK ATTACKS?
sharks AREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR US, MAN.
what IF WE DIE?
we ARE NOT GONNA DIE.
Boone DIED.
Hey, MICHAEL, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BABIES?
I CAN'T GET THIS LITTLE GUY BE QUIET.
uh, WALK WITH HIM. HE'LL CALM DOWN.
Yeah, I TRIED THAT.
Jin, HAVE YOU SEEN SUN?
sun. I NEED SOME HELP WITH THIS BABY.
no.
okay.
Hey, CHUCKY,
wanna KEEP THAT KID QUIET?
baby HUEY'S LIKE NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.
Oh, THERE YOU GO.
you HAPPY NOW?
I WAS.
if YOU'RE GONNA PLAY NURSEMAID, AT LEAST DO THE DAMN JOB.
hey -- HEY, SAY SOMETHING ELSE.
just SAY SOMETHING. SAY ANYTHING.
okay, FINE. I LIKED THAT THING A LOT BETTER INSIDE
than I LIKE IT OUTSIDE.
what?
Hey.
brought YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.
what's IN IT, CHLOROFORM?
soup.
Thanks, BUT I THINK I'LL
who WAS IN HERE?
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
was ANYBODY IN HERE?
no. WHY ARE YOU
the KEY TO THE GUN CASE.
it's GONE.
maybe IT FELL OFF THIS MORNING.
it DIDN'T FALL OFF.
what's GOING ON?
locke TOOK THE KEY. HE'S AFTER THE GUNS.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY. YOU DON'T KNOW
no? THEN WHO WAS IT?
it WASN'T LOCKE.
get IN.
it's TIME.
stay RELAXED AND FOCUSED.
drive WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN.
the FRESH AIR WILL KEEP YOU ALERT.
you WILL NEED TO WEAR THESE.
if YOU RUN INTO ANY PROBLEMS...
use THIS.
you ARE HEROES.
good LUCK.
ESSAM, STOP.
don't BE NERVOUS, BROTHER.
we'll BE OKAY.
I'm WORKING WITH THE CIA.
what?
I'm GOING TO GIVE YOU 10 MINUTES TO GET AWAY
before I CALL THEM.
you SET ME UP? ESSAM, JUST GO.
why WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? YOU'RE WASTING TIME.
you SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS TOGETHER.
you SAID YOU LOST SOMEONE.
her NAME IS NADIA.
we WERE SEPARATED YEARS AGO.
they KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HER.
you USED ME TO FIND A WOMAN?
you TALKED ME INTO THIS.
ESSAM, DON'T.
you SAID IT WAS FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
I'm BEGGING YOU TO GO.
you SAID YOU WERE MY BROTHER.
you WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BROTHER, MY FRIEND.
I AM YOUR FRIEND.
a FRIEND WHO TOLD ME TO DO THIS FOR ZARA
just SO YOU COULD FIND SOME WOMAN THAT YOU LOVE?!
well, SAYID,
I HOPE SHE MAKES YOU WHOLE AGAIN.
go! GO!
she DOESN'T BELIEVE ME, SAYID.
please LISTEN TO ME.
he DID IT.
I KNOW IT.
you' NOT THINKING RATIONALLY.
you've NEVER FIRED A GUN BEFORE.
Shannon, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
Yes, I DO.
if YOU DO IT, YOU CAN NEVER TAKE IT BACK.
stay BACK!
what DID YOU DO TO HIM?!
I TOLD YOU IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
Jack, YOU TOLD ME HE WAS A LIAR.
Shannon: AHH! NO!
Sayid: GIVE ME
No!
I'm SORRY.
don't.
get AWAY.

beach camp's right over there.
can you get me some clothes?
what happened to yours?
I woke up in the jungle like this.
F. Y.I. The whole island vibrated, and kate and jack and sawyer saw it, too, right before they had bags pulled over their heads.
don't worry.
locke's gonna go after them.
he said so in his speech.
what speech?
I'm gonna find our friends.
we're gonna find 'em-- all of them.
I don't know how yet, but I will.
you've, um...you've got a problem with your roof.
the roof?
dude, I don't know about this.
see, you're looking at this all wrong.
he would want us to do this.
he'd want us to ransack his tent and take his stash?
Yeah, that sounds exactly like sawyer.
Yeah, well, he stole all this in the first place.
I mean, people need food.
they need medical supplies.
they need...
shocking amounts of pornography.
Oh. Desmondo.
I need you to come with me.
you guys find eko?
both of you.
what happened?
eko is dead.
we found his body in the jungle...
buried him yesterday.
how did he die?
the island killed him.
what do you mean, the island killed him?
what do you mean, the island killed him?
you know what it means.
with the doctor gone, the camp's on edge enough without people having to worry about what's out here in the jungle.
they're gonna look to you two to see how to react.
so when I tell everyone what happened, I need you to help keep things calm.
dude, you okay?
Hey, guys, what's wrong with desmond?
what is he doing?
there's someone else out there.
Where's claire?
she just went for a walk.
I offered to watch the baby.
I've got her. - Is she okay?
I've got her.
what happened?!
look, stand back. Just give me some room.
get back, charlie. I know what I'm doing.
is she breathing?
she's not breathing?
come on.
do you want me to help you?
come on. Claire?
come on. Claire...
Oh, claire! Cough it up.

is she okay?
let me help.
I've got her, charlie. - I'll take her.
where are you going?
Hey, how did you know?
how did you know she was drowning?
I'll tell you how he knew.
that guy...
sees the future, dude.
she's beautiful.
Aye.
Thanks.
what's her name?
Penny--uh, penelop how are you feeling?
still a little shaken up.
I mean, I go swimming almost every day, and...
the undertow just grabbed me.
I mean, if...
you know, if you hadn'T...
I thought you were only gonna be five minutes. Aaron's starving.
Yeah, um...sorry.
anyway, I just really wanted to say...
thank you.
thank you so much...
for being there.
it was my pleasure.
locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing.
there's nothing to know.
I don't buy this precognitive insanity rubbish.
look, if the bearded wonder could predict the future, he wouldn't have ended up here, would he?
well, whatever happened to him, we're gonna have to find out what it is.
you do realize he's gonna know your plan before you even come up with it, dude.
in that case...
we're gonna have to get him really bloody drunk.
beautiful evening.
Aye. - Say it, dude.
this morning...
I'm sorry I wasn't more...grateful.
thank you for helping claire not drown.
no harm done.
excellent.
brought a peace offering.
you know, make the truce official.
Thanks, but no.
I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late.
too good for us, brother?
all right, that's fine.
we'll take our drink and go somewhere else.
what kind of whiskey is that?
it's, uh...just says "maccutcheon.
all right, then.
let's have it.
no, the bottle, brother.
I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink.
Hey, let's drink.
Cheers. - Cheers.
she swore like a docker with a crackin' set of knockers she was only the farmer's daughter yahoo!
dezzie? - Cheers.
Hey, are all your songs about drinking and fighting and girls with one leg?
Well...girls with one leg and a heart of gold.
so, dezzie...
let me ask you something.
anything, pal.
how'd you know claire was drowning?
well, I could hear her calling for help.
uh, no, you didn'T.
you were, like, a mile away.
well, I suppose I...I've got good hearing.
you, uh, hear the lightning as well?
excuse me?
the lightning.
just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside claire's tent, and two hours later, lightning strikes.
thanks for the drink, pal.
Hey, I don't know what you're doing.
you'd best tell us. Oy!
you thinkbecause you turned some key, that makes you a hero?
you're no hero, brother.
I don't know how you're doingwhat it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one.
yeah
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me when I turned that key!
you don't want to know- -dude!
get off! - You don't want to know!
wait! Desmond!
I'll see youin another life, brother.
I love you, penny.
Oh, my god...
des, are you all right?
stay there. Hang on.
I'm just getting ice.
Oh, god.
are you all right?
sweetie, you okay?
what's happening?
well, what's happeningis the result of combining ladders, paintingthe ceiling and alcohol.
are you okay? Are you nauseous?
this is my flat. - Mm-hmm.
although if you want meto feel at home here, you might startcalling it our flat.
how many fingers, des?
luv, look at me.
what's wrong?
absolutely nothing.
here. Let me.
Thanks. - Hang on.
you've got painton your neck.
have I?
how's that concussion?
well, my severe head injuryis a small price to pay for the pleasure of having...
you move into my humble...
is "rat trap" accurate?
voil.
you know don't really nea job from my father, des.
it's not about the job.
I want him to respect me.
then respect you he shall.
but if for some reasonhe's too daft to see how brilliantyou are, it's notthe end of the world.
what did you say?
here you go, luv.
you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
uh, good afternoon.
I'm hereto see mr. Widmore.
and you are?
Hume...uh, mr. Desmond hume.
Hello, luv.
got a parcel here for 815.
excuse me.
what did you say?
I said, "delivery for 815.
Mr. Hume. Mr. Widmoreis ready for you.
thank you.
penny didn't tell meyou were an actor, desmond.
uh, no. It's actually set design for the royalshakespeare company.
impressive.
you didn't graduatefrom university.
no, sir.
I had to look after my threebrothers after my father
any military experience?
no, sir.
she's beautiful...
your boat.
my foundation is sponsoringa solo race around the world.
something wrong?
no. No, sir.
well, desmond, I'm going to see to it that you have a position inour administrative department.
not the most glamorous duty, but...it's a start.
I'll speakto human resources uh, with alldue respect, sir...
I haven't come here to interview fora position in your company.
you haven't?
no, sir.
I came here to ask for yourdaughter's hand in marriage.
we've been togethertwo years now, and...
pen's moving in...
and...I love her.
your permissionwould mean everything to me.
I'm impressed, hume.
very noble gesture.
you know anythingabout whiskey?
uh, no, I'm afraid not, sir.
this is a 60-year maccutcheon, named afteranderson maccutcheon, esteemed admiralfrom the royal navy.
he retiredwith more medals an any manbefore or since, moved to the highlandsto see out his remaining years.
Admiral maccutcheonwas a great man, hume.
this washis crowning achievement.
this swallow is worth more than you could makein a month.
and to share it with youwould be a waste and a disgrace to the great man who made it, because you, hume, will never be a great man.
Mr. Widmore...I know I'm not
what you're not is worthyof drinking my whiskey.
how could you ever beworthy of my daughter?
thank you very much. A fiver!
thank you very much.
I know you. - That's fine. See you later.
how do I know you? - Thank you.
you can leaveyour number if you want.
how do I know you?
I don'T...uh... - where do I know you from?
look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.
Hey, can I get some help?
you're charlie.
Yeah, name's on the sign.
system failure.
no...
thanks a lot.
The--the--it was in the hatch.
I remember seeing you.
there was A...there was a computer.
there was a--there was a button. We...
we were on an island.
we are on an island, mate. This is england.
no, it was real, man I remember!
Hey, all right.
let's just-- this is whywe don't do drugs.
no, this--I remember this.
this all happened before.
To-today...this happened today. This...
this--I rememberthat he said I wasn't worthy, and then I--and then I came downand I-I-I took off my tie, and--and then--I lost my tie, and penny said, "where was it?
and then--and thenit started to rain,
bit neat.
the wild card, partridge, is unpredictability.
run the same test ten times, you'll get ten different outcomes.
that's what makes life so wonderfully
Donovan! Case in point.
who could have knownthat a drenched scotsman would appearin this rotunda?
you've looked better, des. Not much, but
I need to ask you something.
by all means, do.
what do you knowabout time travel?
are you bloody insane?
just tell meif it's possible.
which part?
the islandfull of mysterious hatches, or the computer which keepsthe world from ending?
no.
forget you'remy best mate, all right?
as a physicist, is it possiblethat I've somehow managed to go back in time and am now living my lifeover again?
it's not funny, donovan.
penny's father berates youfor t being a great man, and voil, you've dreamed a future where you push a buttonto save the world.
these things are notin my head, brother.
I remember things.
all right, then.
what happens next?
it doesn't work like that.
I don't remember everything, just...
just bits and pieces.
how wonderfully convenient.
I remember this.
I know this song.
the jukebox...
des, you're worrying me now.
I remember this night.
graybridge comes backfrom two goals down in the final two minutesto win this game.
it's a bloody miracle!
and right after they win, jimmy lennon's gonna comethrough that door and hit the bartender rightin the head with a cricket bat, 'cause he owes him money.
seriously, des- - watch, please.
just watch.
He'llscore the first goal right now.
Oh! Brilliant save by...
no, no, they--they came back.
they--they won.
Jimmy lennon, cricket bat.
there's no such thingas time travel, des.
and from what I understand, true love can bejust as unlikely.
so if you love penny, stop messing aboutand marry her.
you smell like the pub.
that's becauseI was at the pub.
you didn't get the job.
no.
what did my father say?
your father...was lovely.
we just both agreedthat I wasn'T...exactly qualified.
I say we celebrate.
I say we celebrate that fate has spared youa miserable existence under the employof widmore industries.
let me take you outtomorrow.
let's go for lobsterson the pier, my treat.
I don't think my failureto impress your father is any occasionto celebrate.
well, the occasion isI love you.
Why?
why do you love me?
cause you're a good man.
in my experience, they're pretty hard to come by.
Hey. Des?
where are you?
I'm right here.
never done this before, have you?
is it that obvious?
I can always tellthe first-timers.
now then, may I askyour price range?
I'm not a man of means.
I hope to, you know, one day...
I have just the thing.
this won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still, it hasthe sparkle of life.
I'll take it.
I'M...sorry?
it's perfect. I'll take it.
no, you won'T.
give me the ring. Give it here.
I don't understand.
this is wrong.
you don't buy the ring.
you--you have second thoughts.
you walk right out that door.
so come on. Let's have it.
I don't knowwhat you're on about.
you don't buy the ring, desmond.
how do you know my name?
well, I know your nameas well as I know that you don't ask pennyto marry you.
in fact, you break her heart.
well, breaking her heart, of course, is what drives youin a few short years from now to enter that sailing raceto prove her father wrong, which brings youto the island where you spend the nextthree years of your life entering numbersinto the computer, until you are forcedto turn that fail-safe key.
and if you don't dothose things, desmond david hume, every single one of usis dead.
so give methat sodding ring.
Ah, you're going to be difficultabout this, I can see.
Wh.who are you?
do you like chestnuts?
what?
thank you.
that man over thereis wearing red shoes.
so? What, then?
just thought it was a boldfashion choice worth noting.
this isn't really happening, is it?
sorry?
I've had a concussion.
you're my subconscious.
am I?
you're here to...
to talk me outof marrying penny.
well, it won't bloody work.
Oh, yes, it will.
no.
there is no island.
there is no button.
it's madness.
I love her. She loves me.
I'm gonna spend the restof my life with her.
no, desmond...
you're not.
Oh, my god.
you knew that was gonna happen, didn't you?
then why didn't youstop it?
why didn't you do anything?
because it wouldn't matter.
had I warned himabout the scaffolding, tomorrow he'd be hitby a taxi.
if I warned himabout the taxi, he'd fall in the showerand break his neck.
the universe, unfortunately, has a y of...
course-correcting.
that man was supposed to die.
that was his path.
just as it's your path to go to the island.
you don't do itbecause you choose to, desmond, you do itbecause you're supposed to.
I'm gonna meetennyin an hour.
I've got the ring.
she'll say yes.
I can choosewhatever I want.
you may not like your path, desmond, but pushing that button is the only truly great thingthat you will ever do.
how much for the ring?
Hi. - Hey.
am I late? - Right on time.
Oy. Take your photo, lovebirds?
no, thanks, mate.
come on, somethingto show the grandkids.
Oh, come on, des, let's do itfor all those grandkids.
yeah? You'll do it?
all righty.
let's see whatwe got for you here, eh?
Ah, a beautiful desert scene. - Nah.
no, not the desert? All right.
Ah, I know. The alps.
Ah, I love the alps.
Oh, I hate the alps.
Yeah, not the alps.
Ah, here we go. Beautiful marina scene.
Yeah, let's do that. - It's the one, isn't it?
all right.
take your coat off. - You guys get in position.
it's boiling. There's palm trees.
all right. Here we go.
Oh, an instant classic.
only 5 quid. - Here we go, luv.
here you go, mate.
out of 20.
small price to payfor the memories, right?
I couldn'tgo through with it.
what was that?
I can't do this.
you can't do what?
us.
this...
this relationship.
what are you talking about?
how can I? I...
I can't look after you. I haven't got a job.
I don't have any...
I can't even afford 5 quidfor a bloody photograph.
you deserve someone better.
I know what I deserve. I choseto be with you. I love you.
love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough.
what's this about, des? Where's this coming from?
it's all happening too soon--you moving in, you--you're painting rooms, you're changing things.
I don't even like red.
and why would you leave your flat--your expensive flat
don't do that.
don't you pretendyou don't care, and don't you darerewrite history.
I left my expensive flat 'cause you were too proudto live there, remember?
if you want me to go, if you want me to leave, then don't make this about what I door don't deserve...
and have the decency to admitthat you're doing this because you're a coward.
I'm sorry, pen, but this...
we're notsupposed to be together.
what'll it be?
uh...
uh, just--just give mea pint of your cheapest.
I'm celebratin'.
Oh? What's the occasion?
I think I've madethe biggest mistake of my life, and the worst part is...
I'm pretty sureI've made it before.
do they now?
I had the wrong night.
I was right.
I was off by a night. I heard the song, and then...
I remember this.
I'm not crazy!
I can still change things.
I can still change it.
where the hell's my money?
Hey, duck, brother!
no.
Oh, no.
no.
please...
let me go back.
let me go backone more time.
I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time.
I'm sorry, penny.
I'll change it.
I'll change it.
how'd you knowclaire was drowning?
well, I could hear hercalling for help.
you, uh, hear the lightning as well?
just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside claire's tent, and two hours later, lightning strikes.
I don't know how you're doingwhat it is you're doing, but I know a cowardwhen I see one.
Yeah, a coward-- aah!
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me when I turned that key!
get off!
you don't want to know! - Dude!
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me.
you don't want to know!
you don't want to know!
it doesn't matter what you do.
what the hell are you doing?
you can't change it.
you can't change it.
no matter what you try to do, you just can't change it.
he's wankered. Let's get him to his tent.
all right, des, come on. Give me your arm.
come on. Stand up. Stand up!
okay. Okay.
you're a good man, charlie.
listen, I'm sorry I triedto strangle you, all rig?
Oh, fair play, mate. Here we go.
sorry I called you a coward.
Ah, you're all right, pal.
you are gonna tell mewhat happened to you.
when I turned that key...
my life...
flashed before my eyes, and then I was backin the jungle , still onthis bloody island.
but those flashes, charlie...
those flashes--they didn't stop.
so...
you're telling me you saw a flash of clairedrowning this morning?
that's how you knewhow to save her?
I wasn't saving claire, charlie.
I was saving you.
this morning, you dove in after claire.
you tried to save her, but...
you--you drowned.
what are you talking about?
I didn't drown.
when I saw the lightninghit the roof, you were electrocuted.
and when you heardclaire was in the water, you...
you drownedtrying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.
I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but...
the universe hasa way of course-correcting, and...and I can'tstop it forever.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry because...
no matter what I try to do...
you're gonna die, charlie.

Thanks. - Hang on.
you've got painton your neck.
have I?
how's that concussion?
well, my severe head injuryis a small price to pay for the pleasure of having...
you move into my humble...
is "rat trap" accurate?
voil.
you know don't really nea job from my father, des.
it's not about the job.
I want him to respect me.
then respect you he shall.
but if for some reasonhe's too daft to see how brilliantyou are, it's notthe end of the world.
what did you say?
here you go, luv.
you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
uh, good afternoon.
I'm hereto see mr. Widmore.
and you are?
Hume...uh, mr. Desmond hume.
Hello, luv.
got a parcel here for 815.
excuse me.
what did you say?
I said, "delivery for 815.
Mr. Hume. Mr. Widmoreis ready for you.
thank you.
penny didn't tell meyou were an actor, desmond.
uh, no. It's actually set design for the royalshakespeare company.
impressive.
you didn't graduatefrom university.
no, sir.
I had to look after my threebrothers after my father
any military experience?
no, sir.
she's beautiful...
your boat.
my foundation is sponsoringa solo race around the world.
something wrong?
no. No, sir.
well, desmond, I'm going to see to it that you have a position inour administrative department.
not the most glamorous duty, but...it's a start.
I'll speakto human resources uh, with alldue respect, sir...
I haven't come here to interview fora position in your company.
you haven't?
no, sir.
I came here to ask for yourdaughter's hand in marriage.
we've been togethertwo years now, and...
pen's moving in...
and...I love her.
your permissionwould mean everything to me.
I'm impressed, hume.
very noble gesture.
you know anythingabout whiskey?
uh, no, I'm afraid not, sir.
this is a 60-year maccutcheon, named afteranderson maccutcheon, esteemed admiralfrom the royal navy.
he retiredwith more medals an any manbefore or since, moved to the highlandsto see out his remaining years.
Admiral maccutcheonwas a great man, hume.
this washis crowning achievement.
this swallow is worth more than you could makein a month.
and to share it with youwould be a waste and a disgrace to the great man who made it, because you, hume, will never be a great man.
Mr. Widmore...I know I'm not
what you're not is worthyof drinking my whiskey.
how could you ever beworthy of my daughter?
thank you very much. A fiver!
thank you very much.
I know you. - That's fine. See you later.
how do I know you? - Thank you.
you can leaveyour number if you want.
how do I know you?
I don'T...uh... - where do I know you from?
look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.
Hey, can I get some help?
you're charlie.
Yeah, name's on the sign.
system failure.
no...
thanks a lot.
The--the--it was in the hatch.
I remember seeing you.
there was A...there was a computer.
there was a--there was a button. We...
we were on an island.
we are on an island, mate. This is england.
no, it was real, man I remember!
Hey, all right.
let's just-- this is whywe don't do drugs.
no, this--I remember this.
this all happened before.
To-today...this happened today. This...
this--I rememberthat he said I wasn't worthy, and then I--and then I came downand I-I-I took off my tie, and--and then--I lost my tie, and penny said, "where was it?
and then--and thenit started to rain,
bit neat.
the wild card, partridge, is unpredictability.
run the same test ten times, you'll get ten different outcomes.
that's what makes life so wonderfully
Donovan! Case in point.
who could have knownthat a drenched scotsman would appearin this rotunda?
you've looked better, des. Not much, but
I need to ask you something.
by all means, do.
what do you knowabout time travel?
are you bloody insane?
just tell meif it's possible.
which part?
the islandfull of mysterious hatches, or the computer which keepsthe world from ending?
no.
forget you'remy best mate, all right?
as a physicist, is it possiblethat I've somehow managed to go back in time and am now living my lifeover again?
it's not funny, donovan.
penny's father berates youfor t being a great man, and voil, you've dreamed a future where you push a buttonto save the world.
these things are notin my head, brother.
I remember things.
all right, then.
what happens next?
it doesn't work like that.
I don't remember everything, just...
just bits and pieces.
how wonderfully convenient.
I remember this.
I know this song.
the jukebox...
des, you're worrying me now.
I remember this night.
graybridge comes backfrom two goals down in the final two minutesto win this game.
it's a bloody miracle!
and right after they win, jimmy lennon's gonna comethrough that door and hit the bartender rightin the head with a cricket bat, 'cause he owes him money.
seriously, des- - watch, please.
just watch.
He'llscore the first goal right now.
Oh! Brilliant save by...
no, no, they--they came back.
they--they won.
Jimmy lennon, cricket bat.
there's no such thingas time travel, des.
and from what I understand, true love can bejust as unlikely.
so if you love penny, stop messing aboutand marry her.
you smell like the pub.
that's becauseI was at the pub.
you didn't get the job.
no.
what did my father say?
your father...was lovely.
we just both agreedthat I wasn'T...exactly qualified.
I say we celebrate.
I say we celebrate that fate has spared youa miserable existence under the employof widmore industries.
let me take you outtomorrow.
let's go for lobsterson the pier, my treat.
I don't think my failureto impress your father is any occasionto celebrate.
well, the occasion isI love you.
Why?
why do you love me?
cause you're a good man.
in my experience, they're pretty hard to come by.
Hey. Des?
where are you?
I'm right here.
never done this before, have you?
is it that obvious?
I can always tellthe first-timers.
now then, may I askyour price range?
I'm not a man of means.
I hope to, you know, one day...
I have just the thing.
this won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still, it hasthe sparkle of life.
I'll take it.
I'M...sorry?
it's perfect. I'll take it.
no, you won'T.
give me the ring. Give it here.
I don't understand.
this is wrong.
you don't buy the ring.
you--you have second thoughts.
you walk right out that door.
so come on. Let's have it.
I don't knowwhat you're on about.
you don't buy the ring, desmond.
how do you know my name?
well, I know your nameas well as I know that you don't ask pennyto marry you.
in fact, you break her heart.
well, breaking her heart, of course, is what drives youin a few short years from now to enter that sailing raceto prove her father wrong, which brings youto the island where you spend the nextthree years of your life entering numbersinto the computer, until you are forcedto turn that fail-safe key.
and if you don't dothose things, desmond david hume, every single one of usis dead.
so give methat sodding ring.
Ah, you're going to be difficultabout this, I can see.
Wh.who are you?
do you like chestnuts?
what?
thank you.
that man over thereis wearing red shoes.
so? What, then?
just thought it was a boldfashion choice worth noting.
this isn't really happening, is it?
sorry?
I've had a concussion.
you're my subconscious.
am I?
you're here to...
to talk me outof marrying penny.
well, it won't bloody work.
Oh, yes, it will.
no.
there is no island.
there is no button.
it's madness.
I love her. She loves me.
I'm gonna spend the restof my life with her.
no, desmond...
you're not.
Oh, my god.
you knew that was gonna happen, didn't you?
then why didn't youstop it?
why didn't you do anything?
because it wouldn't matter.
had I warned himabout the scaffolding, tomorrow he'd be hitby a taxi.
if I warned himabout the taxi, he'd fall in the showerand break his neck.
the universe, unfortunately, has a y of...
course-correcting.
that man was supposed to die.
that was his path.
just as it's your path to go to the island.
you don't do itbecause you choose to, desmond, you do itbecause you're supposed to.
I'm gonna meetennyin an hour.
I've got the ring.
she'll say yes.
I can choosewhatever I want.
you may not like your path, desmond, but pushing that button is the only truly great thingthat you will ever do.
how much for the ring?
Hi. - Hey.
am I late? - Right on time.
Oy. Take your photo, lovebirds?
no, thanks, mate.
come on, somethingto show the grandkids.
Oh, come on, des, let's do itfor all those grandkids.
yeah? You'll do it?
all righty.
let's see whatwe got for you here, eh?
Ah, a beautiful desert scene. - Nah.
no, not the desert? All right.
Ah, I know. The alps.
Ah, I love the alps.
Oh, I hate the alps.
Yeah, not the alps.
Ah, here we go. Beautiful marina scene.
Yeah, let's do that. - It's the one, isn't it?
all right.
take your coat off. - You guys get in position.
it's boiling. There's palm trees.
all right. Here we go.
Oh, an instant classic.
only 5 quid. - Here we go, luv.
here you go, mate.
out of 20.
small price to payfor the memories, right?
I couldn'tgo through with it.
what was that?
I can't do this.
you can't do what?
us.
this...
this relationship.
what are you talking about?
how can I? I...
I can't look after you. I haven't got a job.
I don't have any...
I can't even afford 5 quidfor a bloody photograph.
you deserve someone better.
I know what I deserve. I choseto be with you. I love you.
love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough.
what's this about, des? Where's this coming from?
it's all happening too soon--you moving in, you--you're painting rooms, you're changing things.
I don't even like red.
and why would you leave your flat--your expensive flat
don't do that.
don't you pretendyou don't care, and don't you darerewrite history.
I left my expensive flat 'cause you were too proudto live there, remember?
if you want me to go, if you want me to leave, then don't make this about what I door don't deserve...
and have the decency to admitthat you're doing this because you're a coward.
I'm sorry, pen, but this...
we're notsupposed to be together.
what'll it be?
uh...
uh, just--just give mea pint of your cheapest.
I'm celebratin'.
Oh? What's the occasion?
I think I've madethe biggest mistake of my life, and the worst part is...
I'm pretty sureI've made it before.
do they now?
I had the wrong night.
I was right.
I was off by a night. I heard the song, and then...
I remember this.
I'm not crazy!
I can still change things.
I can still change it.
where the hell's my money?
Hey, duck, brother!
no.
Oh, no.
no.
please...
let me go back.
let me go backone more time.
I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time.
I'm sorry, penny.
I'll change it.
I'll change it.
how'd you knowclaire was drowning?
well, I could hear hercalling for help.
you, uh, hear the lightning as well?
just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside claire's tent, and two hours later, lightning strikes.
I don't know how you're doingwhat it is you're doing, but I know a cowardwhen I see one.
Yeah, a coward-- aah!
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me when I turned that key!
get off!
you don't want to know! - Dude!
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me.
you don't want to know!
you don't want to know!
it doesn't matter what you do.
what the hell are you doing?
you can't change it.
you can't change it.
no matter what you try to do, you just can't change it.
he's wankered. Let's get him to his tent.
all right, des, come on. Give me your arm.
come on. Stand up. Stand up!
okay. Okay.
you're a good man, charlie.
listen, I'm sorry I triedto strangle you, all rig?
Oh, fair play, mate. Here we go.
sorry I called you a coward.
Ah, you're all right, pal.
you are gonna tell mewhat happened to you.
when I turned that key...
my life...
flashed before my eyes, and then I was backin the jungle , still onthis bloody island.
but those flashes, charlie...
those flashes--they didn't stop.
so...
you're telling me you saw a flash of clairedrowning this morning?
that's how you knewhow to save her?
I wasn't saving claire, charlie.
I was saving you.
this morning, you dove in after claire.
you tried to save her, but...
you--you drowned.
what are you talking about?
I didn't drown.
when I saw the lightninghit the roof, you were electrocuted.
and when you heardclaire was in the water, you...
you drownedtrying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.
I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but...
the universe hasa way of course-correcting, and...and I can'tstop it forever.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry because...
no matter what I try to do...
you're gonna die, charlie.
and now dancing on stage three, the pride of st. Paul-- corvette!
no. That's the moneyfor the orphanage.
that means, mr. Lashade, you're the cobra.
sorry, baby, it's just business.
all this time it was you.
pretty and smart--what a shame.
razzle dazzle!
autumn, crystal, bad news.
corvette was workingfor the cobra.
but fear not...he will pay.
and...cut!
check the gate! checking.
here, let me give you a hand.
Oh, thank you.
Billy dee, it wasso great working with you.
Oh, no, the pleasure's l mine. Thank you so much.
you're sweet. You, too. - take care.
all right. That's a series wrapfor corvette.
let's hear it for nikki!
well done, nikki!
thank you. Thanks.
brilliant, nikki, as always.
you know, you don't need to die.
we can bring you backnext season.
how?
well, we could say that, uh, corvette was wearinga bulletproof ve.
bulletproof breast.
look, I'm just a guest star, and we all knowwhat happens to guest stars.
now that your work'sdone here,
I suppose you'll be leavingsydney and heading back to L. A.
no, I'm not leaving sydney.
I love you.
and I love you, too.
son of a bitch.
all right. Come on. Let's go one more.
you said best out of five.
well, now we're goin'best of seven.
uh, you okay?
what happened?
what the hell did she say? - I don't know.
let's get her some water. Get help.
what are you doin'? Get movin'!
Dude...nikki's dead.
who the hell's nikki?
84 days ago.
Howie, the frittata is amazing.
it's my new chef.
he's fantastic.
paulo, come in here.
Yes, sir?
paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.
I'd like you to meet nikki.
the food is amazing.
you're too kind.
the secret is the, um, shaved truffles.
luckily for you, they are in season.
you know, you should ask for a raise.
excuse me.
he just came to sydney.
heard I was hiring and showed up at my office every day until I gave him the job.
apparently, back home, he's the, um, wolfgang puck of brazil.
here. Try one of his homemade rolls.
please, please do.
Oh, it'S...beautiful.
Howie, you shouldn't have.
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.
not yet, but, uh, when my wife
he's gone.
I would have loved it if you could've figured out a way whe I didn't have to eat the same food as him.
so nobody else knows about this thing?
everything in here is way off the books.
what?- Ashes are evidence, paulo.
we poisoned him. Let's not poison ourselves.
razzle frickin' dazzle.
what happened?
we don't know.
she's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite--nothing.
maybe it was something she ate.
maybe she was poisoned.
we should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
she's got gunk under her fingernails.
Where'd you find her?
right here.
she stumbled out of the jungle, face planted.
she said something like "plywood" and...sayonara.
actually, I think she said "power lines.
well, who the hell knows what she said?
she was five seconds from dying.
she was probably seein' the light at the end of the tunnel.
paulo lies!
that's what she said."Paulo lies," not "power lines." Paulo lies.
who the hell's paulo?
paulo's her...husband or--or...boyfriend or...her whatever.
they lived down the beach.
well, where the hell is he?
cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
80 days ago.
english expat, howard L. Zuckerman, "the creative force behind such hit shows as 'expos?
strike team alpha' and 'dr. Kincaid, esquire', "was found dead in his palatial sydney estate from heart failure.
are you chewing gum?
nicotine gum.
I quit.
a toast...to our new life together.
Cheers.
there's nowhere to sit.
no tables, no chairs, nothing.
Goodall, boone.
you want me to just grab a chair from the restaurant?
Oh, forget it. Let's just leave.
you already screwed us out of seats in first class.
why would you be able to find them here?
Hey, can I have this chair, please?
Yeah. Be my guest.
Boone, let's just go!
thanks anyway.
I'm coming, shannon.
if you quit flirtingwith random guys, maybe we could actuallyget on the plane.
promise me we'll neverend up like them.
I promise.
paging captain stewart.
please pick up the courtesy phone.
captain stewart...
help me!
please help!
Hey! Get away from there!
Hey! Get back! Get down! Get away from there!
are we alive? Did we survive?
look at me. Am I okay? Am I okay?
Hey! Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen?
pen?
Hey! Does anybodyhave a pen?!
paulo! Paulo, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
baby, look at me. Look at me.
Where's the bag? - Wh?
the bag. Paulo, where is it?
I'm telling you, this is the trail.
what do you knowabout tracking?
well, I knowwhat a footprint is.
over here.
I'm guessin' that's paulo.
he's just like nikki. No wound, nothing.
Yeah, I know.
why are his pants undone?
and why is his shoein that tree?
maybe he steppedon something.
you see something? Sawyer?
nothing.
No! Don'T.
dude, what are you doing?
two people are dead. You ever thinkthey might have been poisoned?
that's evidence.
you're messing up the crime scene.
crime scene?
is there a forensics hatchI don't know about?
stop!
monster.
75 days ago.
how many times do I have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters?
maybe it was a dinosaur.
it's not "jurassic park," paulo. It's the south pacific.
then what was it?
you saw the trees move.
would you start focusing?
We'vebeen here for six days, okay?
the coast guardis gonna get here any second, and I really don't thinkthat they're gonna take, "hey, you know what?
I'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
okay, okay, okay.
Hey, did you guys loseyour luggage?
Yeah, I lost mine, too.
I foundsome other stuff, though, so if you need anything--pants or sweatshirt
I can help youfind some that fit.
I'm ethan, by the way.
Hi. I'm nikki...
and this is paulo.
Hi. Paulo.
and you are so sweet, ethan, but actually, we're not looking for clothes.
Yeah, see, paulo herelost his nicotine gum.
Ouch. You might have more lucklooking inland.
in the jungle?
the plane split apartwhen it was over the island, so some of the stuff might haverained down in there.
Boone. Boone took the water.
it got out of hand. No one would have understood.
what is going on?
someone had to takeresponsibility for it.
it would have never lasted.
shut up! - leave him alone!
it's been six days, and we're all still waitingfor someone to come.
we have to stop waiting.
we need to startfiguring things out.
now I found water-- fresh water--up in the valley.
I'm taking a groupat first light.
if y don't want to come, then find another wayto contribute, because very man for himself"is not gonna work.
but if we can't live together...
we're gonna die alone.
I'm with jin.
it's the monster.
Yeah, because that makesthe most sense.
it does.
locke said when eko died, his last words were,"you're next,
and nikki and paulowere with them.
he was talking about them.
he wasn't saying"you're next" about them.
he was saying "you're next"as in you're all next.
Yeah, that's not really better.
all right, so here's how I see it.
we wanna know what happened?
we gotta find out whateverwe can about these jabonies.
Nina and pablo.
dude, show some respect.
you know their names. It's nikki and paulo.
whatever, hugo.
Where's their tent?
and we betterget some shovels.
57 days ago.
Hey, dr. Arzt.
Oh, hi.
you're a scientist, right?
and--and an educator, yes.
what are you doingwith all this stuff?
Oh, um, well, since we got here, I've discovered 20 new species.
I'm gonna bethe next charles darwin.
Ah, ah, um...that is, uh, latrodectus regina.
very dangerous.
they call herthe medusa spider.
her pheromonesare very strong--one whiff, and every male of the specieswould be here in seconds.
not unlike you, I guess.
so you're probably too busyto help me, then.
no, no, not--not--not at all.
I'm fine. Uh, I can help you.
What--what can I do you for?
well, I'm tryingto find my luggage, and since the planebroke apart over the jungle,
I was wondering if you knewabout trajectories and stuff.
do I?
do I knowabout trajectories?
allow me to draw you a map, madam.
are you surewe should be listening to a high schoolscience teacher?
Juniorhigh, and yes.
what's your problemwith leslie, anyway?
you're jealous.
of him? Never.
Yeah, his spidersturned me on so much, I had to sleep with himto get the map.
I wouldn't be surprised.
you slept with zuckerman.
I did that for us.
okay, I'm sorry. I just--I don't trust that guy.
we should've gone to ethan. He would'vhelped.
paulo, look.
another plane.
looks likeit's been here a while.
go up there. Maybe there's a radio or some
are you insane? If I go up there, that thing's gonna fall.
you're not gonna fall.
what? You want me to die?
come on. Let's keep going.
what is that?
okay. Let's do it.
let's check it out.
so our carry-on bagfell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doorsbehind itself?
you don't wanna climbup to a plane...
but now you want to climb downa ladder into a dark tunnel?
I don't think so.
Hey, man, be careful.
Why? They don'tlive here anymore.
so sun checked the food.
they're eating the same as us, and no one else is sick.
could be a virus.
Dude...monster.
creepy. They collected bugs?
Oh, I think these were arzt'S.
he collected all kindsof different creepy crawlies before he...exploded.
they must'vebeen friends.
Eos?
did u just say "expos??
Yeah.
what the hell's "expos??
only the most awesome hourof television ever.
it was like "baywatch,"only better.
you've got autumn and crystal--two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave, smooth-talking club owner, mr. Lashade.
how'd I miss that one?
check it out. Look atthe cast list. Nikki fernandez.
that's gotta be whyshe was in australia.
this must've been her big break.
Ah, certainly sounds like it.
no way.
Mr. Lashade was the cobra?
is that supposedto mean something?
dude, the cobra'sthe big bad guy.
his identity's been shroudedin mystery for four seasons.
they had a walkie-talkie?
every damn one of those bastardson the other side of the island had one exactly like thishanging from their belts.
so how did nikki and pauloget one?
I'll tell you how.
they were workingwith the others.
what gives you the right?
you have to understand. We thought it was best for everybody.
I'm sorry. Are you my mother?
because she knows what's best for me.
other than that, i decide.
Hey. What's going on?
Kate and her two boyfriends found a case of gunsthat fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
look, the case is locked.
the key is aroundjack's neck, all right?
I promise you, they're safe.
you're all out of control.
the pigs are walkin'. Huh?
the pigs are walking!
So...where did you sayyou found that case?
it's just water, paulo.
stop being such a wussand dive in.
why me?
well, as you hadno trouble reminding me, I slept with howie zuckerman, so the least you could dois go for a swim, and kate said they found the case on the bottom.
let me ask you something.
what?
if you didn't need meto find that bag, would we still be together?
that bagis worth $8 million.
just dive in, paulo.
well?
nothing.
there's nothing down there?
just dead bodies.
okay, so they hada walkie-talkie.
you think they were workingwith the others? Like, how?
like michael.
if that's the case, then why'dthey kill nikki and paulo?
who knows whythose people do anything?
what matters isthey could be out there right now waiting to get us.
I don't know, dude.
I was with the others, like, two weeks ago.
they're on the totalother side of the island.
then who dragged meinto the jungle?
the otherscame into our camp.
they grabbed me, put a bag over my ad.
and if I hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
look, y'all stay here.
let me seeif I can see any sign of 'em.
I'll do a perimeter sweep.
Where'd you get the gun?
got it off one of them.
and when were yougonna let us know?
I guess right now.
what exactly isa perimeter sweep?
Hey, shouldn'twe cover them up?
Yes, of course.
32 days ago.
nice night.
whatcha doing?
nothing.
it looks likeyou're digging a hole.
every man's entitledto his secrets, paulo, but can I give youa piece of advice?
please, john.
you should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
why is that?
things don't stay buriedon this island.
the beach is eroding.
winter's coming--high tide.
whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spotthat won't wash away.
see you back at camp.
who left this open?
Tom was down herea couple of days ago.
well, have him cover it upwith the plane.
that him--shephard?
Yes.
he's cute.
why are we doing this?
Shephard will never agreeto do the surgery.
no. I can convince him to do it.
how?
same way I get anybodyto do anything
I find out whathe's emotionally iested in, and I exploit it.
so what, we just grab all three of them--ford and austen, too?
no, they need to come to us.
and how do wemake that happen?
Michael, of course.
are we done here?
this place gives me the creeps.
Hey! Desmond.
you hear about what happenedto nikki and paulo?
Aye. Tragic.
So...do you know anything?
how do you mean?
can you...you know, use your psychic powers?
doesn't work like that.
I only see flashes.
no offense, de, but...as far as superpowers go...yours is kinda lame.
thanks anyway.
I do know she waswith your mate this mornin'.
my mate?
I saw her with your--your boy sawyer...
the dead girl--nikki.
he said he didn't know her.
then why was she yelling at him?
yelling?
Aye.
at sawyer, this morning?
right before she died.
Vincent! Dude!
so he sawsawyer and nikki fightin'.
that doesn't prove athing.
look at the factsand ask yourself, why is sawyer so gung hoabout investigating this?
what's in it for him?
he pretendedhe didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with nikki.
Sawyer's not a murderer.
he went all the way acrossthe island to help michael.
it is the others. I know what they can do.
okay, you know what?
I'll go get desmond. He'll tell youexactly what he saw.
it was me.
what?
it was me who took you, not the others.
I wasn't myself.
after locke hit me...after he humiliated me...
sawyer told me I could get enby helping him steal the guns.
we just made it...look like...the others.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
sorry.
9 days ago.
Hey, everybody. We're heading out to the pearl station.
there's a computer there thatmight help us find our people.
anybody wanna come along?
I'll go. Great.
what?
anybody else wanna come, meet usat the tree line in ten minutes, and bring water.
you're not serious.
what? You always whineabout not being included.
now's our chance.
Hey, guys, what arethese other tvs for?
sorry?
all these tvs.
this guy saysthat there's six stations...
so maybe some of these tvs are connectedto the other hatches.
well, I'm suddenlyfeeling very stupid.
perhaps I could patch inone of the other feeds, see if we canget another picture.
the toilet still works.
give me the gun.
what the hellyou talking about?
give it to me.
it ain't even loaded.
then how are yousweeping the perimeter?
quit lying, dude.
Desmond saw you fightingwith nikki this morning.
Oh, I see what this is.
the villagers have gotthemselves some torches.
did you kill them?
no. No, I didn't kill them.
Yeah, me and nikkiwent at it this morning...
cause she wanted a gun.
why didn't youtell us this before?
cause ofthe dirt under her nails. - What?
she was digging, and when we found him, I saw a fresh mound of dirt.
she was burying somethin', and if you take the time to dig a holeright before you die, then what you're hiding'sprobably pretty damn good.
so what was it?
what did she hide?
go ahead. Take 'em.
cause whateverhappened to those two, I had nothingto do with it.
12 hours ago.
did you know thanksgivingwas two weeks ago?
we missed it, paulo, just like we're gonnamiss everything.
they're going to find us.
we'll get rescued. You'll see.
okay, ere did this suddenburst of optimism come from?
I don't know. I guess...
it's how you lookat things...like the bag.
I mean, maybe not finding itwas good for us.
how do you figure that?
look what it did.
it might have...torn us apart.
Yeah.
wait here.
I'm gonna get ussome breakfast.
okay.
okay, I know you have them.
give me a gun.
I don't have the guns.
a-team took 'em all.
right, except for the onesyou kept for yourself.
even if I had a gun, I wouldn't give it to you.
judging by the fireyou're breathin', I got a feelingno good would come of it.
Sawyer, give me a gun.
I got a better idea, sister.
how about you go stickyour head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
thanks for nothin'.
and who the hell are you?
thanks for nothin'.
Charlie told meit was your idea...to kidnap me.
you gonna tell jin?
no.
why not?
because then we'dhave to dig another grave.
why are yougiving me these?
becausethey're worthless here.
see, I thought I was gonnaget out of this without a
Nikki and paulo...
I guess we didn'treally know you very well, and it appears you killedeach other for diamonds.
but I know there aregood parts to you, too.
you were always nice to me, and you werea member of the camp.
and...I really loved "expos?
okay, then. Good-bye.
wait.
rest in peace, nikki and paulo.
8 hours ago.
come on, nikki, just tell me.
it's a surprise.
we're almost there.
okay, ready?
Yeah.
I found the diamonds, paulo.
what? Where?
right here.
give them to me.
what are youtalking about?
what am I talking about?
what's this?
your nicotine gum?
you wanted to stoplooking for the bag because you'dalready found it.
I know you have them, paulo, so where are they?!
okay, calm down, okay?
what the hell is that?
Ow! are you out of your mind?
you rememberdr. Arzt's friend.
did it bite you? Does it hurt?
he told me why they call it"the medusa spider.
wanna know why?
what...what did you do?
because one look from medusawould turn anyone to stone
just like one bite fromthe spider will paralyze you...for...
Oh, about eight hours.
it won't kill you.
it'll just...slow your heart rate down to the point where even a doctor would have a hard time...
hearing it beat.
you won't be ableto move a muscle, so I'll be able to do all sortsof nasty things to you.
and since it bit youon your neck, I'd say paralysiswill happen fast.
I'm guessing thatyou have the diamonds on you. Huh?
in a shoe, maybe?
I think I know where.
son of a bitch.
I'm sorry.
you're only sorry'cause you got caught.
I was...afraid...of losing you.
if you foundthe diamonds...you wouldn'tneed me anymore.
Ow! Damn it!
uh, you okay?
Hey. Hey, what happened?
I'm paralyzed.
may I ask you something?
anything, pal.
how did you know Claire was Drowning?
I could hear her calling for help.
you, uh...
hear the lightning as well?
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.
I was saving you.
when I saw the lightning hit the roof, you were electrocuted, and when you heard Claire was in the water, you... you drowned trying to save her.
I've tried, brother, I've tried twice to save you, but no matter what I try to do...
you're gonna die, Charlie.
you're insane, mate.
Superman can fly round the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
dude, if we're going by a pure foot race,
supes would get dusted by the flash.
but why would the man of steel agree to a sodding foot race?
uh, for charity?
and flash would totally win, 'Cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
Ooh, vibration.
whatever would superman do if he came up against a wall?
well... No smashing allowed.
no flying, no smashing.
any other restrictions I need to know about?
perhaps we should fit superman with a pair of kryptonite...
what the hell?
Charlie! No, don't! Don't touch it.
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!
just breathe. Just breathe, huh?
looks like it's homemade. We've got to get back.
No! You help! I can't help!
I'm sorry, mate.
here it is. Here it is.
Superman can fly around the entire planet...
Hey.
Where's the wire?
did you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
listen to me.
there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand.
do you know what I'm talking about?
this is future crap, isn't it?
the cable-- Do you know where it is?
this is important. Why?
Superman...
because someone's coming.
God tests our faith in many ways.
so, as you well know, we have our own test here
a vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit.
this challenges both one's patience...
and his faith.
for some, it may last a week.
those we're less sure about, a month.
personally, Desmond,
I never thought you'd last...
and so now I stand corrected.
for whatever reason, your path has led you here.
and now you're one of us.
welcome, brother.
thank you...
brother.
good Morning, Jack.
must be nice to wake up in your own bed.
Yeah. Home, sweet home.
so I was wondering if I could borrow your first aid kit.
I've, uh. Twisted my ankle.
you want me to take a look at it?
no, you're all right.
I've taped my share of ankles.
right.
Thanks.
something wrong, Hurley?
no, unh-unh.
just... keeping Desmond here company...
cause we're friends.
bring that back when you're done with it, okay?
Absolutely.
what the hell was that?
do you want him to get suspicious?
suspicious of what?
Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it?
that's why you got the first aid kit.
someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me? No. It's just a precaution.
look, dude, you want me to take you to the wire?
I want an explanation.
I saw a sequence of events
things that are gonna happen.
What'd you see?
it was...
it was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle,
only I didn't have the picture on the box, so I don't know how the pieces fit exactly.
but... but one of the pieces-- the first one...
it was you, pulling the cable out of the sand.
so what are the other pieces?
if I tell you that, it'll change the picture on the box.
so what?
isn't that the point-- preventing something bad?
not this time.
so you're not trying to stop something from happening.
you actually want it to happen.
more than anything.
Hey, freckles, you home?
thought you weren'tallowed to use nicknames.
well, you weren't around when I lost the bet,
so you're...
exempt.
what's up?
I... wanted to ask you something.
yeah?
I'm up here.
uh...
so did you tell him?
did I tell who what?
you know.
did you tell the doc...
about you and me?
no...
but he knows.
he saw us on one of their surveillance monitors.
I thought you said the camera was broken.
well, they had another camera.
those perverts.
anyway, he knows.
well, now that that's outta the way...
how about a little afternoon delight?
that means sex.
come on, freckles, wait. Now
do you need me to make you a mix tape?
Yeah, why don't you do that?
dude, you're gonna have to tell me again.
what do we need Jin for? Because he was there with us.
on the beach, when I find the cable?
this way. Here it is.
that's right.
in one of your puzzle flashes?
Aye.
so... if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about?
that'd be the long and short of it, but I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
watch the master.
camping?
Yeah, you know, like, sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach, marshmallows.
camping.
Yes.
everybody likes marshmallows.
good man.
get food, water.
where are you going?
we need one more.
how daft do you think I am?
this isn't a camping trip.
you've had another one of your visions, haven't you?
what was it this time?
someone's coming to the island.
coming?
as in someone who's not already here?
how the hell is that gonna happen?
I can't tell you.
it's got nothing to do with me?
well, you' a part of it, yeah, as are Jin and Hurley.
right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told
jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.
well, that's not gonna happen, not this time.
can I bring my guitar?
Absolutely.
all right, I'm in.
you had me worried the for a second.
this is it.
well, how can you tell?
cause that's exactly where
I followed the wire into the jungle.
where is it, then?
way to go, dude.
here it is.
here it is. Here it is.
the beacon fell this side of the rise.
just one thing-- last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabbed by one of Rousseau's spiky death trap things.
cut her down.
we're not going in the jungle-- Well, not yet.
it's getting late, so, we'll, uh, we'll camp here the night.
camp.
so when do they get here
your mysterious someone?
soon.
you do realize you are free to talk again, brother Desmond?
used to being quiet, I suppose.
Moriah.
I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here... interesting.
and why is that, brother?
well, Moriah is the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.
it's not exactly the most...
festive locale, is it?
and yet god spared Isaac.
well, one might argue that god need not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place.
well, then it wouldn't have been much of a test,
would it, brother?
perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice.
brother Desmond, brother Desmond.
I met this man waiting at the gates.
he says he needs to have a word with you.
sorry, sir.
forgive me, brother.
Hey.
Hey.
the oatmeal's awesome.
it is, huh?
it's strange, huh?
what's that?
being back,
not looking for a way out of a cage,
not finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again.
I almost don't know what to do with myself.
well, enjoy it.
I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough.
well, my big, dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes in the ocean.
well, be careful.
I'll try.
um, can I borrow that spoon?
Yeah.
Thanks.
good night.
Yeah, good night.
what, my doorbell busted again?
the hell are you doing?
shut up and don't talk.
hey...
you crying?
I said shut up.
you got it.
dude, I love the part about the bird.
it was a bird, right?
you.
me? Okay, um, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra? Chupa? - Chupacabra? - Chupa?
Yeah, it's like a bear with spines, but Mexican...
Thanks.
who's that?
her name's Penny.
that's not bad, Des,
not bad at all.
so how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?
because I'm a coward.
sorry.
you and me both, pal.
you know, I tried to run away from she, and she... she tracked me down.
with enough money and determination, you can find anyone," she said.
you know, I used to get through my nights thinking that she actually meant it, that she never gave up...
that maybe she spent the last three years...
looking for me.
what's that?
is that a helicopter?
rescue.
uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?
no.
we gotta go out there.
out there? Well, yeah.
in what? Well, we gotta do something.
look.
look!
Oh, my god.
pallet?
Nah, dude, it's not a food drop. You saw the beacon thing.
someone, like, ejected. Yeah, but that was a helicopter.
you can't eject from a helicopter. Well, maybe they jumped.
all that matters is that they're here.
they"? How do we even know it's a person?
because he said "someone" was coming.
where are you going?
out to where it fell. Come on. Let's go.
no, whoa, slow down.
we're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night. Yes, we are.
were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap?
now it's gonna be light in two hours.
we'll wait until-- She can't wait.
she?
they. Whoever it is... could be hurt.
we have to go-- all four of us--now.
Why?
because that's the way it's supposed to happen.
right. Well, I guess it's supposed to happen without me.
Superman...
we'll leave at first light, then...
together.
terrific.
is your sister in?
leave... now.
let him be, Derek.
Hello, Ruth.
so you're a monk now, are you?
well, technically I'm still what they call a novice, till the Abbott says
why are you here, Desmond?
well, now that my initiation is done, uh...
I felt like I owed you an explanation.
you can never begin to explain what you did.
you left one week before the wedding.
everything was planned, bought and paid for.
you just disappeared completely.
I had a calling.
we dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup.
look... yes, I was scared about the wedding,
so I had a few pints too many, maybe. I...
I raised my eyes, and I asked, "Am I doing the right thing?
and that's the last thing I remember.
and when I woke up,
I was lying on my back in the street, and I don't know how I got there.
and there was this man standing over me, Ruth...
and he reached out his hand and he said to me, "Can I help you, brother?
and the first thing I noticed was the rope tied around his waist, and I looked at him and... I knew.
I knew I was supposed to go with him.
I was supposed to leave...
everything that mattered behind.
sacrifice all of it...
for a greater calling.
well, it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep, wouldn't you?
next time you want to break up with someone, Des, don't join a monastery.
just tell the girl you're too bloody scared.
you a doctor or a carpenter?
what, your dad never taught you to use a hammer?
no, my dad taught me how to drink.
well, at least it's something.
hope I'm not interrupting.
you two arguing over who's your favorite other?
what do you want, Sawyer?
Oh, what I wanted, doc, was to inform you there's been some developments since you were A. W.O. L.
so tell me...
how's your backhand?
Where'd you get the table?
don't you recognize it?
it fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo.
if we don't play every 108 minutes, the island's gonna explode.
finally, something I can beat you at.
you know, considering I haven't played since I was 12,
I wouldn't be too proud.
what is that, 18-point?
Yeah.
it's kinda strange, huh...
being back?
somethin' funny?
uh, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night.
she did, huh? She did.
19-point.
so you guys ate together, huh?
no, Juliet and I had dinner together last night.
huh.
best two out of three?
you got it.
so what's next?
next?
Yeah, you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky.
now what? Maybe I can help you find
that's it. There is no next.
we find the beacon.
why are you lying to me, mate?
look, mate,
I've saved your life three times now.
if that hasn't bought me your trust,
I don't know what will. Let's move.
dude...
seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.
actually, you're not, and if you don't get a move on,
we're not gonna make it before nightfall-- Hey.
look at this.
it can't be Rousseau's.
if it was Rousseau's, a massive rock
would be flying at my head right now.
don't move.
what are you doing? Ow! Don't move.
Ow! Aah!
Aah!
did that come down with the flashi red light thingy?
walkie-talkie.
no, dude, that's a satellite phone.
crap, it's dead.
shocker.
Oh, my god.
is that you?
then who's she
that would be Penny.
what's this?
your mix tape.
well, you gonna take it, or ain't ya?
the best of Phil Collins," huh?
don't get picky.
and if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it.
Thanks, James.
so why'd you jump me last night?
what?
was it 'cause you saw the doc hanging out with Juliet?
it is not like that.
it's not?
you ain't gotta use me, freckles.
all you gotta do is ask.
you think it's her, don't you?
who?
your girl--Penny.
you think it's actually her who bailed out of the helicopter.
earlier I hoped it.
now I know it.
why didn't you tell us?
would you come if I had?
of course. Why wouldn't I?
I didn't wanna tell you because...
I didn't want anything to change.
fair enough.
look, if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued,
why would we want to change anything? Right?
right.
right.
thanks for the heads-up about bringing an umbrella, dude.
it's a grand old team to play for and it's a grand old team to see and if you know your history
brother Desmond?
what are you doing?
well, I believe I'm getting pissed on our lovely wine.
that bottle of our lovely wine fetches over 100 quid.
we've only bottled 108 cases this year.
well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it?
we've also taken a vow of charity.
right.
something tells me, Desmond, that you're not cut out to be a monk.
well, you know, I've had-- I've had a tough week.
I'm sorry for the wine.
I'll take the penance.
I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond.
brother Desmond.
not anymore.
are--are you firing me?
I am indeed.
you can't do that.
I heard the call.
I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you are meant to end up.
I have little doubt that god has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond--bigger plans.
Oh, aye, sure he does.
he does. You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward.
Hey.
what am I supposed to do now?
whatever comes next.
who's Penny?
she's a chick Desmond used to date, and now he thinks she fell from the sky.
so we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued.
dude, even if I spoke korean, it wouldn't make any sense.
Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking.
she might be hurt.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
in case you haven't noticed, dude, I'm not exactly the flash.
the flash is pathetic.
you got something against the fastest man alive?
you're insane, mate!
Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
dude, if we're going by a pure foot race,
supes would get dusted by the flash.
but why would the man of steel agree to a sodding foot race?
uh, for charity? The flash would totally win, 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
Ooh, vibration.
and what would superman do if he came up against a wall?
well, no smashing allowed.
no flying, no smashing.
any other restrictions I need to know about?
perhaps we should fit superman with a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers...
the hell?
Oh, Charlie, duck!
dude.
this way.
no, the beacon fell this side of the rise. No, there.
how about we split up? Me and Charlie'll go that way.
you and Jin go around, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there.
uh, you and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.
you said "duck.
sorry?
you shouted, "duck.
you knew, even before we set off.
you knew all this time, didn't you? Aye.
well, then, why didn't you say anything?
because if I told you the truth, you wouldn't have come.
Oh, you needed me to come 'cause I was part of your vision.
you thought the only way you could get your girl back was if took an arrow in the head.
you were gonna sacrifice me.
if the flashes don't happen exactly as I saw them,
the picture changes.
I was suppos to let you die, Charlie.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means it's bloody pointless.
I keep saving your life, and what good has it done?
it's just gonna keep happening again and again.
maybe that's the point, yeah? Maybe it's a test. A test?
like god testing Abraham,
except I failed...
because I changed what I saw.
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?
Hello!
dude, she's not moving.
I'm sorry, Penny.
I'm sorry.
I was afraid you'd left without saying good-bye.
no.
I nearly took this with me.
if you're not in a hurry, brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours.
that is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting.
all ten cases are ready to go.
Desmond there is just getting the last one.
thank you, and my father sent the check in advance?
and please thank him for his generous donation.
always a pleasure to see you.
good-bye, Desmond.
I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not, we'll put the rest in the front.
is that all right?
Absolutely.
you'd better drive safe, miss.
this vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year. Is that so?
Aye. It's because the monks are lazy.
you know, it's easier making grape jelly than wine.
and how do you know so much about monks?
I'm an ex-monk.
Really?
as of last night.
I was fired.
well, it wasn't that funny. I'm sorry. I've never-- I've
I didn't know monks could be fired.
Oh, they can.
you know, I was told in no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up,
just a... step along the path.
you know, god allegedly has bigger plans for me.
something tells me you don't entirely believe that. I suspect that's because I don't.
well, maybe they're right. I mean, just think, if you hadn't gotten fired, we wouldn't have met, and then how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle?
did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
not yet.
I mean, of course, if an ex-monk already has plans...
you know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers.
well, in that case, I'm Penelope.
very nice to meet you, Penny.
she's alive.
stand back!
get away from her!
I'm here.
I'm here, Penny. Be careful.
just get off, Charlie.
sorry, Penny. Sorry.
we'll get you back here asap. - I'm sorry, george.
just tell my sister that I love her.
you killed naomi!
she wants her people to come here.
and trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here.
if you want to live, you need to come with me.
no one's going anywhere with you, john.
what are you doing?
same thing I've always done, kate-- survivin'.
soy, ron.
drone's got nothing but seafood at 5, 000 mers below.
you picking anything up with yours?
zip.
I'm trying to get her a peek over this ridge as soon as I can.
sonar's pinging up something now.
Hey, you wanna switch feeds?
Roger that.
I'm headed on a bearing of about 1-3-7 from the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map.
but don't hold your breath.
magnetometer is picking up a hell of a lot of anolies down here.
a chest full of doubloons?
keep dreaming, ron.
let's swing around on the next bridge and recalibrate.
are you getting this?
what? What's up?
it's...
it's an airplane.
Oh, my god.
it's oceanic 815.
this hnting footage comes to us from thehristiane I, a salvage vehicle in the indian ocean.
for re than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the sunda trench off bali in search of the remains of sunken trading ships.
late last night, the"christiane" deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or R. O.V. S.
that verified what the national transportation safety board had long feared,
essex, Massachusetts - that the commercial aircraft... - how you want your eggs, dan?
disappeared after departing sydney, australia, on september 22nd, 2004...
so what happened? They found that missing plane?
this footage confirms that oceanic flight 815... - dan?
did in fact crash at sea. - Dan?
even with this tragic discovery...
Dan, why are you so upset? - Victims families say that they're left without any sense of closure.
I don't know.
I can't find my vest!
check under your seat! - I already did!
get ready! Re, just take mine!
everybody out! Now!
Hey, genius!
no, no! - Go!
hey there.
are you jack?
Yeah, I'm jack.
who are you?
I'm daniel faraday.
I'm here to rescue you.
Hey, dan the chopper-- how many of you were on it?
uh, four, including me.
so what happened to the rest of them?
Yeah, yeah, I,uh, have no idea.
I don't know how many of 'em were able to get out before it went down.
I just-- I jumped, and I lost my, uh, what do you call it? My--my pack.
my phone was in my pack. If I had my phone, I would just, uh...
we have a phone.
you--you have a phone.
thank you. Thanks.
he george.
it's daniel.
Dan? - Yeah.
the chopper com went dead. What the hell happened up there?
Yeah, I don't know. George, there was-- there was an electrical storm.
all the instruments, they just-- I think they went down.
but listen, I made-- I made contact with some of the survivors, - and, uh, we were just, uh- - dan, am I on speaker?
would you give me just--just one second?
don't worrY. - I don't know...
Naomi covered for us.
they don't know what locke did to her.
you sure about that?
okay, okay.
so the boat hasn't heard from anybody else yet, but, uh, these are G. P.S. Transponders, and my team and i are all wearing these.
the transponrs will send the locations back to the ship, and then the ship will send all the locations back into the phones.
Oh, there is my signal right there, and hopefully, we'll get the signals from the rest of the team soon.
will you help me find 'em?
Absolutely.
okay. Thank you.
Hey, where are the rest of your people?
most of them are back at the beach.
most of them?
dude what's wrong with you?
you're gonna get struck by lightning.
storm's about to pass, hugo.
it's a freakin' monsoon. We gotta...
let's go.
why you going east?
I thought you said the barracks were due south.
because, james, we have to make a little detour first.
detour to what?
there's a cabin I have to go to.
but the cabin was back that way.
what did you say, hugo?
I, uh, thought your were talking about the airplane cabin.
why are we wasting our time going to some shack anyway?
because we're supposed to.
right, like you were supposed to throw a knife into that naomi chick's back?
you mind telling us who you're getting your orders from, colonel kurtz?
I got 'em from walt.
anything?
no, but it's a big island.
the freighter could be approaching from the other sidE.
that's the spiriT.
Juliet, you lived amongst the others.
why would ben say the people coming here intend to do us harm?
because he's a liar and he's trying to scare us. That's what ben does.
or because the people coming here inte to do us harm.
how many guns do you have left?
is that from your chopper?
Yeah, yeah. That, uh, yeah, they...
reduced the weight load when we started going down.
I guess that's why they pushed me out.
what's this for?
I'm not in charge of, uh, packing, so...
you're not, huh?
we should, uh...
Hey, daniel, why did you bring the gun? - you wanna keep moving?
yeah... as a precaution.
precaution against what?
uh, okay, see, um...
rescuing you and your people...
can't really say its our primary objective.
then what is?
it's miles. It's miles. Come on.
what the hell do you mean you saw walt?
in a dream?
no dream. It was walt.
only... taller.
taller?
what, like a giant?
okay, what exactly did walt tell you?
he said I had work to do, that I had to stop is woman, naomi, from bringing the rest of her people here.
what, you didn't ask any follow-up questions?
Ben had shot me and left me for dead.
Walt saved my life, so I pretty much took him at his word.
he shot you, yet here you are, fit as a fiddle, trompin' through the jgle.
the bullet went in one side, came out the other.
I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there.
anything else?
it's down there.
Hey, miles!
is he dead?
back up, handsome.
miles! Take it easy. It's okay.
they're here to help us.
it's okay, miles. They're just trying to help.
back away from him!
hands where I can see 'em!
Kate, it's all right.
it's okay.
you're kate!
you wanna tell me where naomi is?
what?
naomi-- the woman you killed!
where is she?
inglewood, California for friends and families of the passengers of oceanic 815, this can only be described as the worst-case scenario.
with the plane accounted for and a salvage mission unlikely, authorities are confirming all 324 passengers dead.
ms. Gardner?
I'm miles straume.
we spoke on the phone earlier.
Oh, please come in.
which room is it?
it's upstairs at the end of the hall.
I get paid in advance.
$200, cash only.
you told me $100 on the phone.
that was before my buddy at the police station told me your grandson was murdered.
it's gonna be $200.
fine.
no matter what you hear, don't come up.
you're not doing your grandmother any good staying here, man.
you're causing her a lot of pai I...
I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone.
but the only way I'm gonna be able to do that is if you tell me where it is.
so where is it?
you can go now.
did it work?
Yeah.
he's at peace now.
here.
you get a refund, half off.
wasn't as tricky as I thought.
thank you.
thank you.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
these are good people.
they why'd naomi use the damn code?
Yeah, you remember when she said,"tell my sister I love her"?
well, she doesn't have a sister.
that's what we're supposed to say if we get captured and have a gun to our heads.
like right now jack here would say,"tell my sister I love her.
you get it?
we didn't kill your friend.
then take me to her body.
miles, what about charlotte?
what about frank?
take me to naomi! - Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us.
it was--it was a man by the name of john locke.
he's not with us anymore.
Kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again
look, even if I took you to her body, - you wouldn't know what happened. - I'll know!
now take me to her body.
Alex, hey.
what?
something I need to tell you.
keep your mouth shut, mr. Linus.
now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me ben.
easy kid.
guy's just trying to get in youread.
go take a walk or somethin'.
mind if I ask you a question, james?
Yeah, I do.
why'd you leave kate behind?
you're wasting your time, yoda.
I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it.
you really don't stand a chance now.
chance at what?
James, look at yourself.
Yes, on this island, you're brave, daring, handsome.
you're someone.
but if you left with them...
back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you could never compete with a first-class surgeon.
I think kate was really upset when you made your choice to come with us.
thank god she has jack there to comfort her
don't. - Don't what?
anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?
we're keeping him alive because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us, because he has information we need, and because apart from his mouth, he's completely harmless.
his mouth put that hole in your gut?
okay, james, let's--let's execute him right here, right now, in front of his daughter.
it's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny.
and I'll bet he's already figured out how he's gonna do it.
so you walk him.
what is he doing?
the light...
is strange out here, isn't it? It'S...
it's kind like it doesn't-- it doesn't scatter quite right.
your name's dan, right?
listen, dan, I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right?
so why don't you just put that away?
because, um, miles... would kill me?
but we're just trying to help
Kate, you're wasting your breath.
let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay?
they didn't kill her.
it happened like they said it did.
it's charlotte.
she's only 3 kilometers from here.
all right, then.
let's go get her.
I said let's gO.
you need to put the guns down.
what?
put the guns down.
now why would I do that?
because our friends are out in the jungle right now holding a gun at your head and his head.
so I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding.
just put the guns down.
come on. How stupid do you think I
I don't know, miles.
how stupid are you?
815: RETROUVE!
how many different languages do you have to read that in before you believe it's true?
how many different languages are there?
Excusez-moi.
he wants to know if we're lost.
remind him that people in our line of work are terrible at keeping secrets.
I know about the dig.
he says the site is closed.
then tell him to open it.
dinosaur?
not by a few million years.
it's an ursus maritimus.
Wait,"ursus" as in bear?
as in polar bear.
Charlotte, we're in the desert.
this is a hoax, right?
he wants to know what you're doing with the hammer.
excavating.
is that a collar?
hi yourself.
we were worried when you didn't get back, so we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.
thanks for that, for what it's worth.
don't mention it.
somebody could've told me that the calvary were here.
I gave you that... wink.
what are your names?
uh, I'm daniel faraday, and this is miles
don't tell him my last name.
I guess this is just miles.
what do you do for a living, daniel?
I'm a physicist.
I mean, I guess you could call me a physicist.
I don't really like being pigeonholed into one
Dan, I swear to god, you say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.
and what do you do, miles?
I collect soil samples.
well, that's nice.
well, maybe you can help me.
you say you're not here on a rescue mission, and the world at large believes us to be dead.
but here we are, alive and well, and you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.
Oh, my god.
you guys were on oceanic flight 815.
is that better?
I can't believe you're alive.
how many of you are there?
why do you wanna know?
why wouldn't I want to know?
48 of us survived the crash.
that's not counting the tail section.
they're pretty much all dead now- - hugo.
so you've all been living here this entire time?
is that your baby?
Yeah. This is aaron.
did you have him here on the island?
that's amazing.
well, I've got about a million more questions I want to ask you, but they can wait until we get you back to the freighter.
we've all got one of these transponders, so if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay?
this team of yours-- how many of you are there?
fo, cluding me.
and what happened to your helicopter?
I don't know. The pilot was trying to put it down.
where?
I don't know.
I had to jump.
it was chaos.
I'm lucky to be alive.
get up. You're coming with us.
what? What?
we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.
see, there's your problem.
we don't want to be found.
I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you.
it can't hurt to try and call someone else.
Oh, it can hurt.
What'd you do?
I didn't do anything.
your friend--charlotte.
she's moving.
and she's moving fast.
she's running from something.
according to this, she's right here.
over there. Over there.
locke's got her.
we want to caution our viewers that the images they are about to see are graphic in nature.
viewer discretion is advised.
authorities have released dramatic footage of the sunken remains of oceanic flight 815.
the national transportation safety board has set up a hotline for family members of the oceanic victims.
the N. T.S. B.Has begun the victim identification process.
we have confirmation thathis is the pilot-- captain seth norris.
in a statement, the N. T.S. B.Said that,"due to the sheer depth of the...
recovery of the bodies would be next to impossible.
we can only hope "that identification will provide closure to the families of the victims.
national transportation safety board, oceanic hotline.
Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor.
Yes, sir.
are you a family member of the deceased?
no, I'm not, but I got some information on the crash.
may I please speak to your supervisor?
sir, if you could just tell me
look, I'm staring at the television right now.
you're broadcasting footage of the wreckage and saying that that's the pilot, seth norris.
Yes, sir?
well, that's not him.
please hold.
who am I speaking with?
doesn't matter who i am.
you're showing footage of seth norris, and that's not him.
listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at 19.
he always wore his wedding ring.
and I'm telling you, there's no ring on that body.
sir, it's likely the ring fell off when
I'm telling ya, that is not him.
and how actly is it that you know all about captain norris?
because I was supposed to be flying oceanic 815 on that day.
that's them.
that's somebody from my team.
what's wrong with you people?
we're here because of you.
I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter because you called us for help.
mae we should go see who launched that flair.
Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, hn.
she's lying.
and whatever ty came for, it isn't us.
we keep moving forward as planned. - sure.
who are we to argue with taller ghost walt?
you know what?
you people do whatever you want.
I want you to come with us.
I'm not asking for permission.
and if you think you're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my
what did you do, you soof a bitch?
vest.
what?
vest. Vest.
is he alive?
he's got a pulse.
are you okay?
what happened?
we got struck by lightning.
Frank, where's charlotte?
she bailed out just b-before we went down.
I n't know where she is.
Where's the chopper?
I saw a cow.
Lapidus, where's the chopper?
where did it crash? - Crash?
the hell kind of pilot you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound right over there.
so this is the team?
you've familiarized yourself with their profiles?
unfortunately, yes.
with respect, these are the wrong people for a mission like this.
none of them have field experience, military training.
you can't just drop them in unprotected.
it'll be a disaster.
they're not unprotected. They have you.
there's only so much I can do.
your modesty is positively charming.
this is a high-risk covert op in unstable territory.
it's dodgy enough without having to babysit a head case, ghostbuster, anthropologist and a drunk.
to be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot.
it's madness.
what if we find survivors from 815?
there were no survivors.
Yes, I know.
but what if there are survivors?
there were nosurvivors of oceanic 815.
don't ask questions.
just do what you were hirefor.
every member of this team was selected for a specific purpose.
everything relies on you getting them in, getting them out and preventing anyone from getting killed.
think you can do that?
sure.
why not?
well?
there's some minor damage, but the mechanical systems are intact.
so it'll fly, then?
Absolutely.
can I have the phone now?
tell you what.
I'll give you the phone if you tell me what you people are doing here.
I'll tell you what we're doing here if you give me the phone.
don'n't say anything about your sister.
Hello?
Regina, it's miles.
I need to talk to minkowski.
minkowski can't come to the phone right now.
it's important. Go get him.
miles, he can't come to the phone right now.
all right, have him call me when he can.
I gotta go.
what are you doing with her?
we're taking her with us.
what's the point?
that's--that's not naomi.
it's just meat.
miles, we can't just leave her here.
miles is right.
we burned up most of the damn fuel flying around in that storm.
we barely got enough to get back to the freighter.
we're not gonna carry any unnecessary weight.
I'll take her on the next run.
I promise, dan.
the's a blanket er there by my backpack.
would you grab it? - Yeah.
look as bad as it feels?
how bad does it feel?
what's your name again? - Juliet.
Juliet what?
you weren't on that plane, were ya?
yeah?
this is juliet, and she was not on the plane.
what?
you sure?
you know how many times I studied that damn manifest?
believe me, there's no "juliet burke" on that plane.
she's a native.
Really?
where is he?
back off!
Where's who?
you wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here.
we're here for benjamin linus.
now wheris he?
James, listen to me. Please
keep your mouth shut.
you okay?
I feel like I've got a cinder bck on my chest, but I'll survive.
I'm sorry you got shot.
I didn't intend for that to happen.
Really?
cause it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself.
what good would you be to me dead?
well, I feel much more comfortable now.
Thanks.
I guess this is the part where I'm supposed to say,"I told ya so.
James, I stand correct.
you want me to do it?
no, it's my mess.
I'll clean it up.
no, wait!
Danielle, you should escort alex away from here.
No! No! - Alex, come on, let's go.
come on. Alex. - She's right. Let's go.
anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now.
John, we should talk about this!
Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby?
John, listen.
I have information that you neeD.
I have answers.
what is the monster?
what?
the black smoke, the monster.
what is it?
I don't know.
good-bye, benjamin.
her name is charlotte lewis.
born july 2nd, 1979, essex, england.
Parents--david and jeanette.

she was raised in bromsgrove, did her undergraduate studies at kent, took her phd in cultural anthropology at oxford.
she's here with two other team members and a pilot.
their names--daniel faraday, miles straume, frank lapidus.
your instinct was right, john.
these people are a threat, and if you shoot me, you'll never know how great a threat they were, because I know what they're doing here.
I know what they want.
what do they want?
me, james. They want me.
how do you know all this?
we'll get you back here asap. - I'm sorry, george.
just tell my sister that I love her.
you killed naomi!
she wants her people to come here.
and trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here.
if you want to live, you need to come with me.
no one's going anywhere with you, john.
what are you doing?
same thing I've always done, kate-- survivin'.
soy, ron.
drone's got nothing but seafood at 5, 000 mers below.
you picking anything up with yours?

I'm trying to get her a peek over this ridge as soon as I can.
sonar's pinging up something now.
Hey, you wanna switch feeds?
Roger that.
I'm headed on a bearing of about 1-3-7 from the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map.
but don't hold your breath.
magnetometer is picking up a hell of a lot of anolies down here.
a chest full of doubloons?
keep dreaming, ron.

he's at peace now.
here.
you get a refund, half off.
wasn't as tricky as I thought.
thank you.
thank you.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
these are good people.
they why'd naomi use the damn code?
Yeah, you remember when she said,"tell my sister I love her"?
well, she doesn't have a sister.
that's what we're supposed to say if we get captured and have a gun to our heads.
like right now jack here would say,"tell my sister I love her.
you get it?
we didn't kill your friend.
then take me to her body.
miles, what about charlotte?
what about frank?
take me to naomi! - Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us.
it was--it was a man by the name of john locke.
he's not with us anymore.
Kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again
look, even if I took you to her body, - you wouldn't know what happened. - I'll know!
now take me to her body.
Alex, hey.
what?
something I need to tell you.
keep your mouth shut, mr. Linus.
now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me ben.
easy kid.
guy's just trying to get in youread.
go take a walk or somethin'.
mind if I ask you a question, james?
Yeah, I do.
why'd you leave kate behind?
you're wasting your time, yoda.
I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it.
you really don't stand a chance now.
chance at what?
James, look at yourself.
Yes, on this island, you're brave, daring, handsome.
you're someone.
but if you left with them...
back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you could never compete with a first-class surgeon.
I think kate was really upset when you made your choice to come with us.
thank god she has jack there to comfort her
don't. - Don't what?
anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?
we're keeping him alive because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us, because he has information we need, and because apart from his mouth, he's completely harmless.
his mouth put that hole in your gut?
okay, james, let's--let's execute him right here, right now, in front of his daughter.
it's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny.
and I'll bet he's already figured out how he's gonna do it.
so you walk him.
what is he doing?
the light...
is strange out here, isn't it? It'S...
it's kind like it doesn't-- it doesn't scatter quite right.
your name's dan, right?
listen, dan, I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right?
so why don't you just put that away?
because, um, miles... would kill me?
but we're just trying to help
Kate, you're wasting your breath.
let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay?
they didn't kill her.
it happened like they said it did.
it's charlotte.
she's only 3 kilometers from here.
all right, then.
let's go get her.
I said let's gO.
you need to put the guns down.
what?
put the guns down.
now why would I do that?
because our friends are out in the jungle right now holding a gun at your head and his head.
so I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding.
just put the guns down.
come on. How stupid do you think I
I don't know, miles.
how stupid are you?
815: RETROUVE!
how many different languages do you have to read that in before you believe it's true?
how many different languages are there?
Excusez-moi.
he wants to know if we're lost.
remind him that people in our line of work are terrible at keeping secrets.
I know about the dig.
he says the site is closed.
then tell him to open it.
dinosaur?
not by a few million years.
it's an ursus maritimus.
Wait,"ursus" as in bear?
as in polar bear.
Charlotte, we're in the desert.
this is a hoax, right?
he wants to know what you're doing with the hammer.
excavating.
is that a collar?
hi yourself.
we were worried when you didn't get back, so we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.
thanks for that, for what it's worth.
don't mention it.
somebody could've told me that the calvary were here.
I gave you that... wink.
what are your names?
uh, I'm daniel faraday, and this is miles
don't tell him my last name.
I guess this is just miles.
what do you do for a living, daniel?
I'm a physicist.
I mean, I guess you could call me a physicist.
I don't really like being pigeonholed into one
Dan, I swear to god, you say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.
and what do you do, miles?
I collect soil samples.
well, that's nice.
well, maybe you can help me.
you say you're not here on a rescue mission, and the world at large believes us to be dead.
but here we are, alive and well, and you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.
Oh, my god.
you guys were on oceanic flight 815.
is that better?
I can't believe you're alive.
how many of you are there?
why do you wanna know?
why wouldn't I want to know?
48 of us survived the crash.
that's not counting the tail section.
they're pretty much all dead now- - hugo.
so you've all been living here this entire time?
is that your baby?
Yeah. This is aaron.
did you have him here on the island?
that's amazing.
well, I've got about a million more questions I want to ask you, but they can wait until we get you back to the freighter.
we've all got one of these transponders, so if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay?
this team of yours-- how many of you are there?
fo, cluding me.
and what happened to your helicopter?
I don't know. The pilot was trying to put it down.
where?
I don't know.
I had to jump.
it was chaos.
I'm lucky to be alive.
get up. You're coming with us.
what? What?
we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.
see, there's your problem.
we don't want to be found.
I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you.
it can't hurt to try and call someone else.
Oh, it can hurt.
What'd you do?
I didn't do anything.
your friend--charlotte.
she's moving.
and she's moving fast.
she's running from something.
according to this, she's right here.
over there. Over there.
locke's got her.
we want to caution our viewers that the images they are about to see are graphic in nature.
viewer discretion is advised.
authorities have released dramatic footage of the sunken remains of oceanic flight 815.
the national transportation safety board has set up a hotline for family members of the oceanic victims.
the N. T.S. B.Has begun the victim identification process.
we have confirmation thathis is the pilot-- captain seth norris.
in a statement, the N. T.S. B.Said that,"due to the sheer depth of the...
recovery of the bodies would be next to impossible.
we can only hope "that identification will provide closure to the families of the victims.
national transportation safety board, oceanic hotline.
Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor.
Yes, sir.
are you a family member of the deceased?
no, I'm not, but I got some information on the crash.
may I please speak to your supervisor?
sir, if you could just tell me
look, I'm staring at the television right now.
you're broadcasting footage of the wreckage and saying that that's the pilot, seth norris.
Yes, sir?
well, that's not him.
please hold.
who am I speaking with?
doesn't matter who i am.
you're showing footage of seth norris, and that's not him.
listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at 19.
he always wore his wedding ring.
and I'm telling you, there's no ring on that body.
sir, it's likely the ring fell off when
I'm telling ya, that is not him.
and how actly is it that you know all about captain norris?
because I was supposed to be flying oceanic 815 on that day.
that's them.
that's somebody from my team.
what's wrong with you people?
we're here because of you.
I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter because you called us for help.
mae we should go see who launched that flair.
Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, hn.
she's lying.
and whatever ty came for, it isn't us.
we keep moving forward as planned. - sure.
who are we to argue with taller ghost walt?
you know what?
you people do whatever you want.
I want you to come with us.
I'm not asking for permission.
and if you think you're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my
what did you do, you soof a bitch?
vest.
what?
vest. Vest.
is he alive?
he's got a pulse.
are you okay?
what happened?
we got struck by lightning.
Frank, where's charlotte?
she bailed out just b-before we went down.
I n't know where she is.
Where's the chopper?
I saw a cow.
Lapidus, where's the chopper?
where did it crash? - Crash?
the hell kind of pilot you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound right over there.
so this is the team?
you've familiarized yourself with their profiles?
unfortunately, yes.
with respect, these are the wrong people for a mission like this.
none of them have field experience, military training.
you can't just drop them in unprotected.
it'll be a disaster.
they're not unprotected. They have you.
there's only so much I can do.
your modesty is positively charming.
this is a high-risk covert op in unstable territory.
it's dodgy enough without having to babysit a head case, ghostbuster, anthropologist and a drunk.
to be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot.
it's madness.
what if we find survivors from 815?
there were no survivors.
Yes, I know.
but what if there are survivors?
there were nosurvivors of oceanic 815.
don't ask questions.
just do what you were hirefor.
every member of this team was selected for a specific purpose.
everything relies on you getting them in, getting them out and preventing anyone from getting killed.
think you can do that?
sure.
why not?
well?
there's some minor damage, but the mechanical systems are intact.
so it'll fly, then?
Absolutely.
can I have the phone now?
tell you what.
I'll give you the phone if you tell me what you people are doing here.
I'll tell you what we're doing here if you give me the phone.
don'n't say anything about your sister.
Hello?
Regina, it's miles.
I need to talk to minkowski.
minkowski can't come to the phone right now.
it's important. Go get him.
miles, he can't come to the phone right now.
all right, have him call me when he can.
I gotta go.
what are you doing with her?
we're taking her with us.
what's the point?
that's--that's not naomi.
it's just meat.
miles, we can't just leave her here.
miles is right.
we burned up most of the damn fuel flying around in that storm.
we barely got enough to get back to the freighter.
we're not gonna carry any unnecessary weight.
I'll take her on the next run.
I promise, dan.
the's a blanket er there by my backpack.
would you grab it? - Yeah.
look as bad as it feels?
how bad does it feel?
what's your name again? - Juliet.
Juliet what?
you weren't on that plane, were ya?
yeah?
this is juliet, and she was not on the plane.
what?
you sure?
you know how many times I studied that damn manifest?
believe me, there's no "juliet burke" on that plane.
she's a native.
Really?
where is he?
back off!
Where's who?
you wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here.
we're here for benjamin linus.
now wheris he?
James, listen to me. Please
keep your mouth shut.
you okay?
I feel like I've got a cinder bck on my chest, but I'll survive.
I'm sorry you got shot.
I didn't intend for that to happen.
Really?
cause it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself.
what good would you be to me dead?
well, I feel much more comfortable now.
Thanks.
I guess this is the part where I'm supposed to say,"I told ya so.
James, I stand correct.
you want me to do it?
no, it's my mess.
I'll clean it up.
no, wait!
Danielle, you should escort alex away from here.
No! No! - Alex, come on, let's go.
come on. Alex. - She's right. Let's go.
anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now.
John, we should talk about this!
Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby?
John, listen.
I have information that you neeD.
I have answers.
what is the monster?
what?
the black smoke, the monster.
what is it?
I don't know.
good-bye, benjamin.
her name is charlotte lewis.
born july 2nd, 1979, essex, england.
Parents--david and jeanette.
eldest of three, all girls.
she was raised in bromsgrove, did her undergraduate studies at kent, took her phd in cultural anthropology at oxford.
she's here with two other team members and a pilot.
their names--daniel faraday, miles straume, frank lapidus.
your instinct was right, john.
these people are a threat, and if you shoot me, you'll never know how great a threat they were, because I know what they're doing here.
I know what they want.
what do they want?
me, james. They want me.
how do you know all this?
because I have a man on their boat.
you killed naomi!
she wants her people to come here.
and trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here.
if you want to live, you need to come with me.
who are you?
I'm here trescue you.
so this is the team?
these are the wrong people for a mission like this.
none of them have field experience, military training.
you can't just drop them in unprotected.
there's only so much I can do.
Where's the chopper? Where did it crash?
crash? The hell kind of pilot you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound right over there.
get up. You're coming with us.
well, we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.
see, there's your problem.
we don't want to be found.
you wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here.
we're here for benjamin linus.
now where is he?
did ben ever mention anything about knowing anyone off the island?
you're sure of that? - No.
look, this is real simple.
do you know where he is or don't you?
what do you want with him?
I wanna locate him.
the people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus.
they gave me this picture, and that's all they told me.
they said,"find him.
and for what they're paying me, I don't need to know anything else. Do you?
you want ben?
okay, he's with locke and your friend...
locke's got her, too, and we know where he's heading.
locke's the guy that killed naomi?
give me back my gun, shephard.
you want your gun back.
I want answers.
you don't trust me.
N. I'll always be with you. R.G. I don't trust you.
in fact, you're supposed to be dead.
but am I asking a billion questions? No.
we both have the same problem-- this locke guy.
even if locke has your friend, you can't just waltz in there and grab her.
they're armed.
well, how about that? So are we.
so why don't we move out and- - you're not going anywhere.
will that helicopter fly?
it's what she does.
then you can take me to your ship.
sayid, wait a second.
we did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we?
well?
I burned a lot of fuel cong in. I can't carry much weight.
I'll take three of ya.
in case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner.
I can bring her back safely.
and if I do...
will you take me to the ship?
Absolutely.
you bring charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island.
good morning.
good morning.
it's a long walk to the next hole.
do you need a ride?
thank you, but no. My ball is right here.
you know, you are the first person I've seen out here all morning.
I believe we're paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy.
indeed we are.
is this your first time in the seychelles?
I'd use the 5-iron.
I think I'll stick with the 7.
tell you what.
50 euros ss mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.
let's make it 100.
Eccellente.
amazing, huh, how a wager makes just about anything more fun?
not bad.
not bad.
so...
what do you do for a living, my friend?
I do nothing.
nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here.
I was the recipient of a large settlement.
corporate merger?
actually, a plane crash.
oceanic airlines flight 8-1-5.
I'm sayid jarrah.
one of the oceanic six.
Ah, that'S...
that's--that's amazing.
I remember reading all about it.
take your shot, my friend.
it appears you were right about the 5-iron.
well, uh...
enjoy your round, and, uh, don't worry about the wager.
all in good fun.
no, you won. Low me to pay you.
it's fine, thank you. It'S...
I insist, mr. Avellino.
is this seat free?
where would you like to go?
is it free?" Was the full extent of my german.
what are you looking for?
I love europe. Everyone speaks english.
I'm looking for potsdamer platz.
well, you don't need aap.
it's one block down, right across the street.
thank you.
I'm elsa.
Sayid.
could I have an espresso, please?
what sort of business brings you to berlin?
I'm a headhunter.
a corporate recruiter.
and what do you do?
my employer an economist.
he works in emerging markets.
actually, I-I don't really understand what he does, which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him.
and if this goes off, I'm at his side instantly, which is wonderful since he's only in berlin once or twice a year.
which is why you're enjoying a luxuriously long miay coffee.
Yes.
thank you.
do I...
know you from somewhere?
I'll tell you exactly where you know me from...
if you let me take you to dinner.
this is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight.
18991231 0: 08: 00
well... if you can find it.
Hello?
I made contact. - Good.
take a look at this.
Naomi had it with her.
she was looking fodesmond.
whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it.
maybe desmond can shed some light on this.
how long would it take to get to the beach and back?
couple of hours.
you mind?
anything i can do to help.
so how we gonna do this?
you're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.
well, and what kind of mission is that?
I'm going to make locke release charlotte, and I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.
as opposed to the way I'd do it?
the last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
that's not good diplomacy.
you think you're going after charlotte without me?
of course not.
well, good.
is tre anything else?
Yeah. Givee my gun back.
we leave in ten minutes.
ready to give us a name, gizmo?
he's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat, james.
yeah? Why not?
because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.
well, here's an idea.
why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe and send that little piggy to market?
and if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef.
now why don't we do that?
because then we'd have to carry him.
Hey, john, how much further is it?
I-I need to feed aaron.
it should be here... the cabin.
maybe we got turned around.
it could be anywhere.
no, it was here.
well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
I guess I was mistaken. It doesn'T...
doesn't matter.
pl the same. We keep movin'.
the barracks aren't far.
if her team is with jack's group, they know we're going to the barracks.
Yeah, and red here was wearing a vest.
which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gunfight.
if all they want is her, maybe we should just let hero.
I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide.
why do we need to take prisoners?
we're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable.
how is she gonna be valuable?
he means as a hostage, luv.
no, this is notwhat I signed up for.
what did you sign up for hugo?
look, I'm just saying I think we
if we let her go, they'll look at it as a sign of good faith.
they'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be.
I'm just trying to come up with some sort of comprose
we're beyond compromise.
and right now, hugo, I'm making the decision.
is that gonna be a problem for you?
kinda sucks, huh?
what's that?
being told not to come along.
now you know what it feels like to be me.
does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway?
touch?
you should go with them, kate.
you're serious? - Yeah.
what, don't you trust sayid?
I don't trust locke.
so what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to naomi?
sawyer won't let him.
got room for one more?
Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.
the gun's a last resort, kate you give locke that same speech?
let move out.
this guy sayid-- where's he from?
iraq.
Iraq?
so he's just gonna go and work everything out?
what was he, a diplomat?
no.
no, he was a torturer.
naomi-- were you close to her?
Nope.
met her on the boat.
you don't seem particularly affected by her death.
sure I'm affected.
she was hot, and I dug her accent.
nice.
and this woman--charlotte.
you don't really care about her, do you?
define "care
so much for camaraderie.
Ah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns?
actually, I do care about locke.
maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half.
there was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us or kill us.
and which side did you land on?
I'll let you know when I decide.
you look fantastic.
this is why I wanted to take you to the opera.
if a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother?
you know what?
I'm not bringing it.
if tonight's the night he calls, so be it.
I'll carry iT.
if he does call, I don't want you fired over me.
you should tell your employer that there is newer technology.
well, I've tried.
he's very old-fashioned.
you know how bosses can be.
do you have a boss?
everyone has a boss, lsa.
come on. We don't want to be late.
why are you still here?
I mean, when we met, you said you would only be in berlin for one week.
the job I'm ons proving harder to accomplish than I thought.
right.
I was hoping it was because of me.
let's go.
Strauss awaits.
what's his story?
Ah, couldn't tell you.
half the stuff he says is way over my head.
the other half goes way, way over.
Hey, uh, frank?
can I, uh-- ooh.
sorry to interrupt.
may I please use the phone just for a second? - For what?
I just wanna call regina on the boat,'cause I figure since we're waiting, maybe I could just, you know, try to
what is it, daniel?
I'd just like to do an experiment.
just--just a- - okay.
you just keep it to at science stuff, all right?
Yeah.
if minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away.
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello?
Regina? Hey--hi, it's dan. Hang on.
can you hear me?
Yeah.
yeah? Okay. Hang on.
I'm, uh, all... yes.
I am all set here. I have a fix.
are you locked in?
getting your signal pretty clear.
okay, great. Then...okay.
fire the pload.
payload away!
don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.
40 kilometers to beacon.
35 kilometers to beacon.
30 kilometers to beacon.
25 kilometers to beacon.
20 kilometers to beacon.
15 kilometers to beacon.
10 kilometers to beacon.
Regina? - 5 kilometers to beacon.
I don't have it.
that's... weird.
that is far more than weird.
what's with the swing set? These people have day care?
you think they're here yet?
let's find out.
it'soming from in there.
hurley, what happened?
they left me.
locke's gone off the reservation, man.
I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said walt was the one who told him to kill this other chick, - and--and--and he- - walt?
dude, don't ask.
I was, like, just trying to argue with him so he would just, like, you know, chill, but, uh
how about you stop babbling, just tell us what happened to them?
where are they?
who are you?
where the hell did they go, tubby?
Oh, awesome.
the ship sent us another sawyer.
hurley, where did they go?
look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know.
and so they all left, all together?
Yeah, they were freaked.
locke said that the peop on the ship were here to rescue charlotte and then kill us.
so... are you?
not yet.
did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?
uh, locke said they were gonna go by ben's house before they took off.
why would he go there?
for all I know, they could've locked ben up in the closet, too.
Where's ben's house?
mind if I ask you a question?
shoot.
the red sox really win the series?
Hey, don't get me started on that, all right?
my dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue.
I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.
it's the payload!
it's finally here.
what is that?
it's a rocket.
Oh, no.
31 minutes.
Oh, no.
this is not good.
your friends are back.
well...
look at that.
look for anything that might show where they've gone.
I'll start in here.
don't worry. Kate's fine.
good job, hugo.
sorry, dude.
I'm sorry, sayid.
nothing personal.
Where's locke?
he's talking to that angry chinese guy.
I'm not going to hurt you, hurley.
I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break-dancing thing you do with your legs.
I think I'll hang back here.
well...
I guess they're running out of jail space.
I lost a dollar, you know.
how'd you manage that?
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
what do you know about friendship?
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
so, what, I'm your prisoner?
if that sorta thing turns you on.
what are you doing here with locke?
I'm not with him.
Yeah, you are, james.
then what are you doing with jack?
I went with jack because I believe he can get us off this island.
then I guess that's the difference between us.
I ain't lookin' to leave.
why not?
cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me.
and what's here that's so much better?
why do you wanna go back, kate?
seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here.
so if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don'know how the world works.
I mean, look around us, freckles.
we got roofs over our heads...
electricity, showers, beds.
how long, sawyer?
how long do you think we can play house?
why don't we find out?
iced tea.
I thought you might be thirsty.
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry about all the theatrics, but, uh,
I didn't know how many of you there would be or whether you'd be armed.
I had to... cor my bases.
what have you done with miles and kate?
Kate's with sawyer, and miles is somewhere else.
he's fine.
all I did was ask him some questions.
did he answer any? - No.
did you have more luck with the woman you captured?
not particularly.
then why don't you turn her over to me?
and why would I do that?
I agree that these people are liars, and they're certainly not here to rescue us.
but if I return safely with charlotte, they'll take me to their ship.
it's our best chance at finding out who they are and what they really want.
well, then, I can save you a lot of trouble, sayid, because ben says he's got a spy on the boat.
who?
it's a secret.
forgive me, but the day I start trusting him is the day I would have sold my soul.
give me charlotte, allow me to do things my way, or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop.
why would I give you charlotte for nothing?
Oh, I think you misunderstood me.
I never expected you to give her to me for nothing.
should we get dressed? - no.
well, we're gonna have to get out of this bed at a certain point.
Why?
well, for one thing, because I know that eventually you're gonna have to go to that job of yours
you know, the one that you never talk about.
there's nothing to talk about. It's just a job.
I know nothing about you.
I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, what happened to you.
but what about life now?
what about you?
that's what you do when you're in love, right?
in love?
Yeah.
okay.
no more secrets.
what do you want to know?
he's here... my boss.
I, um...
I have to go.
now?
where?
hotel adlon.
Where's my dress?
you have to leave berlin.
what?
you can't be here anymore.
what do you mean? Why would I
people will be asking questions soon about what happened to your employer.
and you can't be around to answer them.
my employer?
this... this is about my boss?
who are you?
it has nothing to do with how- - the caf?
you meant to meet me there?
you used me to get to my boss?
what did you say--people will ask what happened to him?
it's best you don't know.
you're gonna kill him?
you're gonna kill him?
do you even know him?
his na is on a list.
a list? What list?
you--you have a list?
it's my employer'S.
who that?
it doesn't matter who he is!
Soou just kill people 'cause your list?
innocent people?
the man you are working for is not an economist.
you were supposed to page me at ten-thirty
no, I don't kill him
he's not going to give me the name now
why should I keep him alive?
no, He had no idea
all right, all right
I'll bring him to you
leave the hotel
I'll meet you at the safe house what do u think you're
why was naomi carrying this picture of me?
look, man, you gotta understand somethin'.
she was senior management.
it's not like we hung around the cafeteria together.
she stayed on her own
look, naomi told me yopeople were hired by her.
so you look me right in the eye and tell me u've never seen or heard of penelope widmore.
fine.
you don't want to tell me the truth?
I'll find someone who will.
see, when that takes off, I'm on it.
he's back.
Where's kate?
she decided to stay.
what happened to miles?
I traded him.
traded him?
I promised you charlotte. Here she is.
you cheated.
did I?
Yes, you did.
lucky for you, that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.
you all right? - All right, that giveus room for one more.
go back, with all the fun I'm having here?
no.
I've got work to do.
seat's yours if you want it, daniel.
I--no, thank you.
I think I should probably just stay with charlotte.
all rit.
Just--just... just one thing.
just be sure that you follow the same exact bearing that we came in on, okay?
no matter what.
by that, I mean no matter what. Just...
just stay on it.
Roger that.
be careful.
I don't have to talk you out of coming.
as much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control.
wish me luck.
good luck.
send me a postcard.
you said we have room for one more?
Yeah. Why?
you should bring naomi home.
take your shirt off.
is she dead?
Yes.
why didn't she kill you?
she was trying to get information from me.
what sort of information?
she wanted to know who I worked for.
she wanted to know about you.
of course she did.
why are you crying?
because it hurts, or because you were stupid enough to care for her?
these people don't deserve our sympathies.
need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?
you used that to recruit me to killing for you.
you wanna protect your friends or not, sayid?
I have another name for you.
but they know I'm after them now.
good.
you killed naomi!
she wants her people to come here.
and trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here.
if you want to live, you need to come with me.
who are you?
I'm here trescue you.
so this is the team?
these are the wrong people for a mission like this.
none of them have field experience, military training.
you can't just drop them in unprotected.
there's only so much I can do.
Where's the chopper? Where did it crash?
crash? The hell kind of pilot you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound right over there.
get up. You're coming with us.
well, we need to stay where we are so that they can find us.
see, there's your problem.
we don't want to be found.
you wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here.
we're here for benjamin linus.
now where is he?
did ben ever mention anything about knowing anyone off the island?
you're sure of that? - No.
look, this is real simple.
do you know where he is or don't you?
what do you want with him?
I wanna locate him.
the people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus.
they gave me this picture, and that's all they told me.
they said,"find him.
and for what they're paying me, I don't need to know anything else. Do you?
you want ben?
okay, he's with locke and your friend...
locke's got her, too, and we know where he's heading.
locke's the guy that killed naomi?
give me back my gun, shephard.
you want your gun back.
I want answers.
you don't trust me.
I don't trust you.
N. I'll always be with you. R.G.
in fact, you're supposed to be dead.
but am I asking a billion questions? No.
we both have the same problem-- this locke guy.
even if locke has your friend, you can't just waltz in there and grab her.
they're armed.
well, how about that? So are we.
so why don't we move out and- - you're not going anywhere.
will that helicopter fly?
it's what she does.
then you can take me to your ship.
sayid, wait a second.
we did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we?
well?
I burned a lot of fuel cong in. I can't carry much weight.
I'll take three of ya.
in case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner.
I can bring her back safely.
and if I do...
will you take me to the ship?
Absolutely.
you bring charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island.
good morning.
good morning.
it's a long walk to the next hole.
do you need a ride?
thank you, but no. My ball is right here.
you know, you are the first person I've seen out here all morning.
I believe we're paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy.
indeed we are.
is this your first time in the seychelles?
I'd use the 5-iron.
I think I'll stick with the 7.
tell you what.
50 euros ss mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.
let's make it 100.
Eccellente.
amazing, huh, how a wager makes just about anything more fun?
not bad.
not bad.
so...
what do you do for a living, my friend?
I do nothing.
nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here.
I was the recipient of a large settlement.
corporate merger?
actually, a plane crash.
oceanic airlines flight 8-1-5.
I'm sayid jarrah.
one of the oceanic six.
Ah, that'S...
that's--that's amazing.
I remember reading all about it.
take your shot, my friend.
it appears you were right about the 5-iron.
well, uh...
enjoy your round, and, uh, don't worry about the wager.
all in good fun.
no, you won. Low me to pay you.
it's fine, thank you. It'S...
I insist, mr. Avellino.
is this seat free?
where would you like to go?
is it free?" Was the full extent of my german.
what are you looking for?
I love europe. Everyone speaks english.
I'm looking for potsdamer platz.
well, you don't need aap.
it's one block down, right across the street.
thank you.
I'm elsa.
Sayid.
could I have an espresso, please?
what sort of business brings you to berlin?
I'm a headhunter.
a corporate recruiter.
and what do you do?
my employer an economist.
he works in emerging markets.
actually, I-I don't really understand what he does, which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him.
and if this goes off, I'm at his side instantly, which is wonderful since he's only in berlin once or twice a year.
which is why you're enjoying a luxuriously long miay coffee.
Yes.
thank you.
do I...
know you from somewhere?
I'll tell you exactly where you know me from...
if you let me take you to dinner.
this is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight.
18991231 0: 08: 00
well... if you can find it.
Hello?
I made contact. - Good.
take a look at this.
Naomi had it with her.
she was looking fodesmond.
whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it.
maybe desmond can shed some light on this.
how long would it take to get to the beach and back?
couple of hours.
you mind?
anything i can do to help.
so how we gonna do this?
you're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.
well, and what kind of mission is that?
I'm going to make locke release charlotte, and I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.
as opposed to the way I'd do it?
the last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
that's not good diplomacy.
you think you're going after charlotte without me?
of course not.
well, good.
is tre anything else?
Yeah. Givee my gun back.
we leave in ten minutes.
ready to give us a name, gizmo?
he's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat, james.
yeah? Why not?
because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive.
well, here's an idea.
why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe and send that little piggy to market?
and if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef.
now why don't we do that?
because then we'd have to carry him.
Hey, john, how much further is it?
I-I need to feed aaron.
it should be here... the cabin.
maybe we got turned around.
it could be anywhere.
no, it was here.
well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
I guess I was mistaken. It doesn'T...
doesn't matter.
pl the same. We keep movin'.
the barracks aren't far.
if her team is with jack's group, they know we're going to the barracks.
Yeah, and red here was wearing a vest.
which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gunfight.
if all they want is her, maybe we should just let hero.
I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide.
why do we need to take prisoners?
we're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable.
how is she gonna be valuable?
he means as a hostage, luv.
no, this is notwhat I signed up for.
what did you sign up for hugo?
look, I'm just saying I think we
if we let her go, they'll look at it as a sign of good faith.
they'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be.
I'm just trying to come up with some sort of comprose
we're beyond compromise.
and right now, hugo, I'm making the decision.
is that gonna be a problem for you?
kinda sucks, huh?
what's that?
being told not to come along.
now you know what it feels like to be me.
does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway?
touch?
you should go with them, kate.
you're serious? - Yeah.
what, don't you trust sayid?
I don't trust locke.
so what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to naomi?
sawyer won't let him.
got room for one more?
Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.
the gun's a last resort, kate you give locke that same speech?
let move out.
this guy sayid-- where's he from?
iraq.
Iraq?
so he's just gonna go and work everything out?
what was he, a diplomat?
no.
no, he was a torturer.
naomi-- were you close to her?
Nope.
met her on the boat.
you don't seem particularly affected by her death.
sure I'm affected.
she was hot, and I dug her accent.
nice.
and this woman--charlotte.
you don't really care about her, do you?
define "care
so much for camaraderie.
Ah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns?
actually, I do care about locke.
maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half.
there was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us or kill us.
and which side did you land on?
I'll let you know when I decide.
you look fantastic.
this is why I wanted to take you to the opera.
if a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother?
you know what?
I'm not bringing it.
if tonight's the night he calls, so be it.
I'll carry iT.
if he does call, I don't want you fired over me.
you should tell your employer that there is newer technology.
well, I've tried.
he's very old-fashioned.
you know how bosses can be.
do you have a boss?
everyone has a boss, lsa.
come on. We don't want to be late.
why are you still here?
I mean, when we met, you said you would only be in berlin for one week.
the job I'm ons proving harder to accomplish than I thought.
right.
I was hoping it was because of me.
let's go.
Strauss awaits.
what's his story?
Ah, couldn't tell you.
half the stuff he says is way over my head.
the other half goes way, way over.
Hey, uh, frank?
can I, uh-- ooh.
sorry to interrupt.
may I please use the phone just for a second? - For what?
I just wanna call regina on the boat,'cause I figure since we're waiting, maybe I could just, you know, try to
what is it, daniel?
I'd just like to do an experiment.
just--just a- - okay.
you just keep it to at science stuff, all right?
Yeah.
if minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away.
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
Hello?
Regina? Hey--hi, it's dan. Hang on.
can you hear me?
Yeah.
yeah? Okay. Hang on.
I'm, uh, all... yes.
I am all set here. I have a fix.
are you locked in?
getting your signal pretty clear.
okay, great. Then...okay.
fire the pload.
payload away!
don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.
40 kilometers to beacon.
35 kilometers to beacon.
30 kilometers to beacon.
25 kilometers to beacon.
20 kilometers to beacon.
15 kilometers to beacon.
10 kilometers to beacon.
Regina? - 5 kilometers to beacon.
I don't have it.
that's... weird.
that is far more than weird.
what's with the swing set? These people have day care?
you think they're here yet?
let's find out.
it'soming from in there.
hurley, what happened?
they left me.
locke's gone off the reservation, man.
I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said walt was the one who told him to kill this other chick, - and--and--and he- - walt?
dude, don't ask.
I was, like, just trying to argue with him so he would just, like, you know, chill, but, uh
how about you stop babbling, just tell us what happened to them?
where are they?
who are you?
where the hell did they go, tubby?
Oh, awesome.
the ship sent us another sawyer.
hurley, where did they go?
look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know.
and so they all left, all together?
Yeah, they were freaked.
locke said that the peop on the ship were here to rescue charlotte and then kill us.
so... are you?
not yet.
did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?
uh, locke said they were gonna go by ben's house before they took off.
why would he go there?
for all I know, they could've locked ben up in the closet, too.
Where's ben's house?
mind if I ask you a question?
shoot.
the red sox really win the series?
Hey, don't get me started on that, all right?
my dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue.
I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.
it's the payload!
it's finally here.
what is that?
it's a rocket.
Oh, no.
31 minutes.
Oh, no.
this is not good.
your friends are back.
well...
look at that.
look for anything that might show where they've gone.
I'll start in here.
don't worry. Kate's fine.
good job, hugo.
sorry, dude.
I'm sorry, sayid.
nothing personal.
Where's locke?
he's talking to that angry chinese guy.
I'm not going to hurt you, hurley.
I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break-dancing thing you do with your legs.
I think I'll hang back here.
well...
I guess they're running out of jail space.
I lost a dollar, you know.
how'd you manage that?
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
what do you know about friendship?
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
so, what, I'm your prisoner?
if that sorta thing turns you on.
what are you doing here with locke?
I'm not with him.
Yeah, you are, james.
then what are you doing with jack?
I went with jack because I believe he can get us off this island.
then I guess that's the difference between us.
I ain't lookin' to leave.
why not?
cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me.
and what's here that's so much better?
why do you wanna go back, kate?
seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here.
so if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don'know how the world works.
I mean, look around us, freckles.
we got roofs over our heads...
electricity, showers, beds.
how long, sawyer?
how long do you think we can play house?
why don't we find out?
iced tea.
I thought you might be thirsty.
I'm thirsty.
I'm sorry about all the theatrics, but, uh,
I didn't know how many of you there would be or whether you'd be armed.
I had to... cor my bases.
what have you done with miles and kate?
Kate's with sawyer, and miles is somewhere else.
he's fine.
all I did was ask him some questions.

what's that?
cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.
you don't know where your boat is?
I know where it is.
why are you flying directly into the thunderhead?
why don't you just sit back and let me do my job, huh?
is that Faraday?
she told Charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct?
Aye.
what do you expect to find when you get there?-- Answers.
damn it!
hold on!
on your sodding feet!
move! move! move!
what are you waiting for, Hume?
what's the matter, Hume?
did you not hear me?
I'm sorry, sir. I was-- I was having a dream, sir.
you were having a dream, were you?
and what were you dreaming about?
that it took you so sodding long to get to your mark?!
I was in a helicopter, sir,
and there was a storm, sir.
and...
I don't remember the rest, sir.
well, at least it was a bloody military dream.
right! all of you!
in the yard! four minutes!
and you can thank private Hume
for having to do it in double-time.
move! one, two, three!
three! one, two, three!
four! one, two, three!
five.
100 crunches! go! go! go! go! go!
one! two! three...
I hope your dream was worth this, mate.
sorry, pal. it's just...
I've never had a dream that was so vivid.
it was--it was like I was actually there.
have you got something to say, Hume?
I asked you a question!
we're almost through it.
I see daylight.
what do you think you're doing?
Desmond, are you all right?
who are you?
how do you know my name?!
here you go.
all right, they took off a day ago.
why haven't we heard from them?
I'm gonna tell you again,
as I've been telling you all night, doctor, I don't know!
you heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat.
what makes you think I know anything? --Because you're not worried.
excuse me?
your boat's 40 miles off the coast.
it should've taken them, what, 20 minutes to get there?
so why aren't you worried? well, should I wring my hands together
and whisper a prayer on their behalf?
Hey, hey, hey. come on.
maybe we should just-- just tell them.
tell us what?
Dan... Let's not confuse anyone.
well... Daniel, maybe if you talk real slow,
we'll be able to follow.
your perception of how long your friends have been gone...
it's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone.
what does that mean?
this is a mistake.
it'll be fine. it'll be fine.
as long as frank flew on the bearings that I gave him,
if he stayed on it, it... it'll be fine.
and what if he didn't?
then there might be side effects.
we're at 2, 000 feet. sit down! --what am I doing here?!
what the hell's going on?! something's wrong with Desmond.
how do you know my name?!-- Hold him in his seat!
I'm trying! --let go of me!
keep him away from the stick! we'll be there in two minutes!
what are you doing back? who are they?
survivors of 815.
so you brought them here. what the hell were you thinking?
Where--where am I?
all right, just take it easy. --who are you people?
buddy. okay, now, take it easy, buddy.
what am I doing here? who are you people?-- My friend is disoriented.
look, I'm not your friend! I don't know you!
when did he start doing this?
he was fine when we took off. When we hit some weather
Hey, Faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector wait.
what's your name, my friend?
Sayid. --Okay, Sayid. look, we're gonna take your buddy
down to the sick bay, okay?
I'm going with him.-- Let our doctor look at him first,
then you can come down.
you got my word on that, okay?
Hey, listen to me-- This is a mistake, right?
I don't know these people.
I don't know these people.
no, but this is wrong!
I'm not supposed to be here.
22. "here"?
"here" what?
what the hell are you doing on your feet?
are you finished with your crunches？
because you want to run?!
right! squad!
on your feet!
right face!
10 kilometers!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
get moving, or so help me, I'll kill you myself.
what the hell's the matter with you, Des?
if I told you, you'd think I was crazy.
I already know you're crazy.
this morning,
when I was in the yard doing crunches...
I left.
what do you mean, you left?
I was on a boat.
and then--then I was back here, right--right where I started.
des, if you're trying to get tossed out of service
Billy, I am telling you the truth, man.
who else was on this... boat?
anyone you recognize?
there was a photo. Penny was in the photo.
what?
Des! where you going?!
thanks for this morning, Hume.
watch your step.
watch it. watch your step. Take it easy.
I'm not here.
this...
this--this isn't happening.
you are here, and this is happening.
look, we're gonna take care of you. what am I doing here?
it's all right. you're gonna be okay. --I'm not supposed to be here.
who are you people?
my name is kea my, and this is Omar.
I'm from Vegas, and he's from Florida.
but as for where we are, I-- we last ported in Fiji.
so at least we know we're still in the pacific.
all right, my friend. now you just relax, okay?
we're gonna go get the doctor,
and he's gonna wanna ask you some questions
to--to help us sort all this out. --What do you mean, "sort out"?
wait a minute. what do you mean? I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be here! open this door! Open this door!
it's happening to you, too, isn't it?
what's happening to Desmond?
your friends know what's wrong with him.
well, if they do, they're not sharing it with me.
then perhaps you'll share how we took off at dusk
and landed in the middle of the day?
listen, I don't know
what's happening to your buddy, all right?
but you gotta trust me when I tell you this.
I am trying to help you.
you want to help me?
give me your phone.
let me call my people.
you give me that weapon, and I'll give you this phone.
be quick. don't go trying to call Baghdad.
those phones only call each other.
Hello?
Jack? it's Sayid.
I'm on the freighter.
are you okay? Where the hell have you been?
something happened during the flight,
and now Desmond's in their sick bay.
hold on. hold on, hold on, hold on.
all right, you're on speaker.
on the helicopter, something happened to Desmond.
he doesn't appear to recognize me or know where he is.
side effects?
wait, your friend, um, Desmond--Has he...
has he recently been exposed to high levels of radiation
or electromagnetism?
okay, look, uh, we don't know why,
but going to and coming from the island,
some people can get a little... Confused.
so...
what? This is amnesia?
no, this is not amnesia.
Hey.
Hey. hey!
can you hear me?!
are you all right?!
Hello?!
I was just on a Ferris wheel.
see, Ray? I'm not crazy.
it's happening to him, too, Ray, and it's gonna happen to you.
it's gonna happen to all of us, everyone...
once we start heading to that island again.
would you please step aside?
no. no. Ray, no.
I need you to relax for a minute. --No.
no, it's not gonna stop it, Ray!
nothing can stop it, Ray! nothing can stop it!
and how are you feeling? --What the bloody hell is going on?!
I understand you're disoriented. you're not gonna stick me with that,
brother!
I... don't wanna stick you with anything.
it's okay. I just wanna check your eyes.
Why?
so I can help you.
what's your name?
Desmond, why don't you tell me about the last thing you remember
Hello?
penny?
what do you want, Desmond?
um, Penny, listen, I'm, uh...
I'm in trouble, and, uh...
but I... I think something's happening to me, and...
I'm confused and...
I... I need to see you.
you broke off with me, and then you joined the army,
and now you call with some expectation
that I still care about you?
Yeah, I'd say you are confused, Desmond.
no, no, I'm not. it's--it's...
look, (无建议) got two days leave starting tonight.
can I--can I-- can I come and see you?
No! No, and don't bother showing up at the flat either,
cause I've moved.
moved? where?
it doesn't matter.
look, Desmond, I'm going to go.
please, just don't call me again.
no, no. no, listen. Penny, Penny, I --Penny, I...
need you.
did you just... experience something, Desmond?
what the hell, Frank? You're not supposed to be down here,
and definitely not with him. sorry, doc,
but I got Faraday calling from the island.
he needs to talk to the Scottish guy. no,
Faraday's not talking to my patient. now get out of here.
but he's not your patient. give Desmond the phone. hey!
give him the phone now!
Hello?
Desmond? Desmond, my name is Daniel Faraday.
we met yesterday before you took off,
but I'm guessing you don't remember that.
am I right? took off? what?
Desmond, we don't have long to talk,
so I need you to tell me what year you think it is.
what do you mean, what year do I think--it's 1996.
all right, Desmond.
Desmond, look, you--you gotta tell me. where are you?
I-I'm in-- I'm in some kind of sick bay.
no, no, no. not right now, Desmond.
where are you supposed to be? where are you in 1996?
I-I'm at camp Millar. it's, uh, royal scots regiment.
it's, uh, just north of Glasgow. Dan, you might wanna
Yeah, yeah. no. no, I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
Desmond, listen,
when it happens again, Desmond, I need you to get on a train.
get on a train and go to Oxford.
oxford university.
queen's college physics department, all right?
what? why?
because I need you to find me.
where is it? where is it?
what? my journal, my journal.
I need my journal, or I won't believe him.
why does he think he's in 1996? I don't know. I don't know.
it's unpredictable. it's a random effect.
sometimes the displacement's only a couple of hours.
sometimes it's years.
wait, wait, this has happened before?
the phone now, please. thank you.
Desmond, are you still there? Doctor? Hey, doctor, are you okay in there?
talk to him. I can't hold them for long. Um, yes. yes, I'm here.
okay, Desmond, listen, when you find me at queen's college,
I need you to tell me to set the device to 2. 342.
what? all right, you got it? 2. 342.
and it must be oscillating at 11 hertz.
you got it, Desmond?
2. 342, oscillating at 11...
just--just remember that-- 2. 342 at 11 hertz, all right?
and one more thing, Desmond.
if the numbers don't convince me,
I need you to tell me that you know about Eloise.
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy.
get off the phone.
tell me that you know about Elo
...not a single piece of original thinking...
the concept of "original"
the opposite of derivative.
I am the one for you to impress, Mr. Hollister,
and I'm not impressed. so go. go try again.
um, sorry, are--are you Daniel Faraday?
you are?
uh, I'm sorry. I'm--I'm Desmond Hume, and, uh,
I was told I could find you here.
and I think I've...
I've just been to the future.
the future? --Yes.
uh, I-I spoke to you there.
you, uh, you told me to come here to--to Oxford
to find you.
you--you said you'd help me.
why didn't I just help you there in the future?
sorry?
why would I put you through the headache of time traveling?
you--you know what I mean?
it just seems a little... unnecessary?
and don't you think my esteemed colleagues
could've come up with something
just a little more believable, huh?
what kind of a prank is that? Time paradox so uninspired.
set your device to, um... 2. 342
and--and make sure it oscillates at 11.
okay, now--now you...
you're gonna tell me who told you those numbers.
you did.
no, this is... this is ridiculous.
I know about Eloise.
What--what is all this?
this is where I do the things Oxford frowns upon.
all right, this... this future version of me,
uh, he--he referenced this meeting, right? obviously.
so--so I would remember you coming to oxford, right?
I would remember this, here, right now.
actually, um, no.
no? maybe you just forgot.
Yeah, right. how would that happen?
so this--this is changing the future?
you can't change the future.
what's that for? radiation.
do I get one? --You don't need one.
for prolonged exposure. I-I do this 20 times a day.
so what do you put on your head?
Yeah.
this...
this is Eloise.
what does this do?
this... if the numbers you gave me are correct,
what this will do...
is unstick Eloise in time,
just like you.
what happened?
wait, shh, shh. she's not back yet.
there she is.
okay, here goes... everything.
come on, come on. come on.
that's it.
that's it. that's it.
come on, come on.
that's it.
Yes, yes.
Yes!
it worked!
th-this is incredible. --I'm sorry.
how is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?
what is incredible
is I just finished the maze this morning,
and I'm not gonna teach her how to run it until an hour from now.
so--so you--you sent her to the future.
no, no, no, her consciousness, her mind.
so-- so how does that help me?
you? help you?
I don't understand. Am I supposed to help you?
didn't I send you back here to help me? --I don't know why you sent me here.
all I know about you is you
you end up on some bloody island.
an island?
what island? Why would I go to an island
Desmond, give me the phone.
Hey, come on! Everybody relax!
listen, look, Daniel wanted to talk to the guy,
so we brought him the phone, that's all. you let Faraday talk to him?
he said he could help.-- Faraday can't even help himself!
outside now. The captain wants to talk to you.
and I want to talk to your captain. --I'll be sure to let him know.
in the meantime, have a seat.
I need to get back.
back where? the island? --He said he could help.
he said he--he'd tell me what I needed to do. Desmond, Desmond,
can you please explain to me
you're Desmond?
do I know you?
I'm George Minkowski.
I'm the communications officer.
before they strapped me down here,
all the calls to and from this boat came through me
in the radio room.
and every so often,
I'd get this flashing light on my console
an incoming call.
we were under strict orders never to answer it.
so? what's that got to do with me?
those calls came from your girlfriend.
what happened?
Oh, uh, you're back.
and... You were out almost 75 minutes.
out?
Oh, yeah. yeah, yeah. you just... whew.
you went catatonic right in the middle of a sentence.
I had to carry you to the chair.
so I take it you were-- you were in the future again? --Aye.
for how long? ---I don't know. five minutes?
why does this keep happening?
uh, in your case,
I'm guessing the progression is exponential.
each time your consciousness jumps,
it gets harder and harder to jump back.
I would be careful crossing the street if I were you.
what happened to her? She died.
Yeah, I can see that. how?-- Brain aneurysm, probably. I don't know.
I'm going to do an autopsy later.
is that gonna happen to me?
the effects seem to vary from case to case, but, uh...
answer me!
if this keeps happening, am I gonna die?
I don't know.
I think...
Eloise's brain short-circuited.
the jumps between the present and the future
she eventually--she couldn't tell which was which.
she had no anchor. ---What do you mean, "anchor"?
something familiar in both times.
all this--see this? This is all variables.
it's random. It's chaotic.
every equation needs stability, something known.
it's called a constant.
Desmond, you have no constant.
when you go to the future, nothing there is familiar.
so if you want to stop this,
then you need to find something there,
something that you really, really care about...
that also exists back here...
in 1996.
this constant...
can it be a person?
Yeah, maybe.
but you have to make some kind of contact.
didn't you say you were
off on a boat in the middle of nowhere?
uh... who are you calling?
I'm calling my bloody constant.
the number you have dialed
has been disconnected.
you okay?
you look a lot older now, huh?
welcome back, Desmond.
I need to call Penny - - Calling your girlfriend is not our priority.
listen, brother, I don't know you, but
but you seem to know me,
so--so if you and me are friends,
then I need your help. I need to call Penny now.
Whoa! You boys are getting way ahead of yourselves.
two days ago, someone sabotaged all the equipment.
we lost all communication with the mainland.
I probably could've fixed it, but then...
then I went nuts.
Where's the radio room?
it's one deck up. I'll take you there. come on.
and how do we get out of here?
through the door.
looks like you guys have a-a friend on this boat.
your nose, brother.
it's clear.
let's go
"the black rock" set sail from Portsmouth, English, march 22, 1845,
on a trading mission to the kingdom of Siam
when she was tragically lost at sea.
the only known artifact of this journey
is the journal of the ship's first mate,
which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates on the sainted Marie, Madagascar, seven years later.
the contents of this journal have never been made public,
nor are known to anyone outside the family of the seller,
we open the bidding on lot 2-3-4-2
at 150, 000 pounds.
150, 000, sir.
160, 000? do I hear 160, 000?
160, 000, sir. 170, 000, sir.
180, 000 on the phone.
200, 000 pounds.
220, 000 pounds.
240000.0
260, 000 pounds, sir.
280000.0
on the phone, I have 300, 000-- 320, 000.
340, 000 pounds.
360, 000. 380, 000. 380, 000 pounds...
this auction's by appointment only, sir. do I hear 400, 000 pounds?
Yeah, listen, pal, I just need to speak to the gentleman over there just for a moment, okay?-- I'm sorry, sir.
sold... for 380, 000 pounds to bidder 7-5-5. thank you.
just for a minute, all right? Look...
Mr. Widmore Desmond?
can I have a word, sir? I'm sorry, Mr. Widmore. He...
no, no, it's fine. ...possession of Charles dickens when he died.
walk with me. we open the bidding on this lot...
your word. let's have it.
I need to get in touch with Penny. 513
I don't know how to reach her,
and her number's been disconnected.
there was a time when if you'd have asked her to marry you,
I'm certain she would've said yes.
fortunately...
your cowardice won out instead.
I take it you've had second thoughts.
and you'd like her to give you another chance.
why do you hate me so much?
it's not me who hates you.
here's her address.
I'll let her tell you herself.
I know. it's getting harder.
it starts happening faster, too.
come on. let's move.
Hey, how did this happen to you?
we were anchored here, waiting for our orders,
bored out of our minds.
me and Brandon-- He's one of the crew members
we--we took out the ship's tender.
we just wanted to see the island.
but Brandon started acting crazy,
so we had to turn around.
where is he? In a body bag.
there.
who did this?
you got me.
but when the captain finds out, I feel sorry。。
after your call, someone has to tell me
precisely what is going on.
can you fix it, brother?
I need a minute.
do you have the number to make the call?
wake up, brother. Wake up. you've gotta come back.
you've gotta come back. --Desmond, do you know the number?
no. well, you'd better remember it.
it's 2004.
I didn't realize it was almost Christmas. it's been...
No! uhh!
I can't...
get...
back.
what happened to him?
the same thing that's gonna happen to me.
what are you doing here?
I had to--I mean, I tried to call you,
but you--you disconnected your phone. --Yeah, because I moved.
look, I don't know if you're getting the signals, Desmond,
but I'm trying to make a clean break from you,
so if you don't mind, I'm gonna-- wait, wait, wait, wait. Pen,
please wait.
I just--I just need to get your new phone number, okay?
why would I give you that?
because I-I made a huge mistake.
I-I should never have broken up with you, and--and--and... uhh.
I know--I know that now, and--and I'm sorry and-- oh, don't. just don't
I understand, and--and I-I know
it's--it's too late to change things,
but I need to tell you something,
and--and I need you to listen to me, and...
look, I-I know it's gonna sound ridiculous, but...
please, Pen.
I need you to listen to me.
just say what you need to say and then go.
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make any sense to me,
but eight years from now, I...
I-I need to call you,
and I can't call you if I don't have your number.
what?
look, Penny, just-- just give me your number.
I-I know-- I know I've ruined things.
I know you think things are over between us, but they're not.
if there's any part of you that still believes in us, just...
just give me your number.
and what's to say you wouldn't call me tonight or tomorrow
I won't call...For eight years.
december the 24th, 2004.
Christmas eve.
I promise.
please, Pen.
if I give you the number, will you leave?
Aye.
all that, and you're not gonna write it down?
it wouldn't do any good. you have to keep that number.
you can't change your number for eight years. just get out. get out!
just--just remember, December the 24th, 2004.
look, Pen, if--if you still care about me,
you have to answer. I'm not crazy, Penny!
you have to believe me! you have--you have to
trust me.
I do trust you, but you still have to remember that number.
7946-0893. it's a London number.
excellent timing.
the patch is done,
but I don't know how long the battery will last.
I hope she's there.
I hope so, too.
Hello?
penny. Penny, you answered.
you answered, Penny.
des, where are you?
I'm...
I'm... I'm--I'm on a boat. Um...
I've--I've been on an island, Pen.
my god, Penny, is that really you?
Yeah!
Yes, it's me!
you believed me.
you still care about me. Des...
I've been looking for you for the past three years.
I know about the island.
I've been research
and then when I spoke to your friend Charlie...
that's when I knew you were still alive.
that's when I knew I wasn't crazy.
des, are you still there?
Yes! yes, I'm here! I'm still here. can you hear me? yeah, yeah,
that's better.
I love you, Penny.
I've always loved you.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I don't know where I am, but...
I'll find you, Des... I promise...
no matter what... I'll come back to you.
I won't give up. I promise.
I promise. I love you. I love you.
I'm sorry.
the power source went dead. That's all we have.
thank you, Sayid.
it was enough.
are you all right now?
Aye.
I'm perfect.
who are you?
I'm here to rescue you.
I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter because you caed us for help.
she's lying, and whatever they came for, it isn't us.
is that from your chopper?
Yeah, yeah, that, uh, yeah, they... reduced the weight load.
what's this for?
uh, rescuing you and your people...
can't really say it's our primary objective.
then what is?
hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.
you must be Dr. Burke.
I'm Harper Stanhope.
please sit.
today is just a meet and greet so that we can get to know each other.
please don't take this the wrong way, but I...I really don't think I need therapy.
how about we call it "Talking" instead of therapy?
okay. - Good.
let's talk.
so you've been here a week.
and what's your least favorite part so far?
I don't like being treated like a celebrity.
and is that surprising?
you're big news right now.
Yes, I know.
I guess I don't like being the center of attention.
it makes me feel isolated...
alone.
well, maybe you feel that all eyes are on you, but you're not a celebrity, and soon enough, you'll realize that you're no different than anyone here.
Oh, I...I know.
I...I never meant that I...
yes?
Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption.
I know you don't like me busting in, but Ben would like to see th doc.
she's all yours, Tom.
was nice talking to you, Juliet.
welcome to the island.
that Harper's a piece of work.
but you give her a week, she'll have you cryin' about your daddy.
I'm speaking from personal experience here.
welcome to your humble abode.
this is for me?
the whole house?
you're here to help us with some very important research, Juliet.
we pulled out all the stops.
two bedrooms, two baths. Washer, dryer.
fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.
Oh, and I know you love the opera.
you have all the classics on CD.
Ben, this is amazing.
seriously, you shouldn't have gone to all the trouble.
I'm only gonna be here for six months.
right, of course. But...
we want you to feel at home.
need some help?
I'm fine.
I just can't seem to get it steady.
okay.
nice.
Thanks.
why are you going to all this trouble when we're about to leave this island?
well, I still need somewhere to sleep tonight, right?
have you seen Charlotte and Faraday?
all their stuff's gone.
no, I haven't seen 'em.
you still have the sat phone, right?
he saw them going into the jungle.
why didn't he say anything?
you said...
they are friends.
aren't they?
all right, we've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's fan out.
if you cut their trail, call out to me.
I'll come to you.
Hello, Juliet.
long time no see.
what are you doing here?
I came to deliver a message...
from Ben.
the two people you're looking for... Faraday and Lewis...
they're headed to the tempest.
and if they figure out how to deploy that gas...
then everyone on this island is going to die.
why don't you stop them?
because Ben wants you to do it.
how can Ben possibly know where they are when he's a prisoner?
Ben is exactly where he wants to be.
how am i supposed to stop them?
by pointing the gun and pulling the trigger.
who are you?
I'm an old friend of Juliet's.
I just told her where the people you're looking for are headed.
maybe you and your gun can go, too.
you okay?
uh, I was just looking for some gauze.
I...I didn't know anyone was here.
how'd you manage that?
I, um...
I...I work over at the power station.
I was pressed up against the transformer.
take aeat.
let me take a look at it.
you're Burke, right?
the baby doctor
what gave me away?
I heard we lost Henrietta this morning.
it's okay. It's not your fault.
pregnant women are dying on this island.
I was brought here to help fix that.
so whose fault is it?
believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnigh you have aone to talk to?
any friends here?
maybe Harper.
harper hates me.
we only talk because we have to.
I get the feeling that she is a mean...
and spiteful person.
she's my wife.
she's your wife?
I'm sorry. I didn't... - No, don't worry about it.
really, it's okay. It...
okay, you're, uh...
you're set.
much obliged, ma'am.
I know this place can wear on you, but if you need to talk...
I'm around.
good to know.
if you promise not to tell your wife what I said about her,
I won't tell anyone that you lied about how you hurt your arm.
I know a chemical burn when I see one.
you got a deal.
uh, by the way...
I'm Goodwin.
Faraday and Charlotte are heading for the tempest.
the tempest?
it's safer for you if I don't talk about it.
no. Talk about it, please.
it's an electrical station that powers the island.
why would they go there?
if there's something you need to tell me, now's the time to do it.
what I need is for you to help me.
will you help me?
if we move all night, maybe we can still catch them.
thank you.
I think it's that way.
but whatappens if I...
what if I can't do it?
lo at me.
I know you can do this.
should we get going?
Yeah.
it's...it's okay. It's okay. It's Kate.
so they have Miles?
Yeah, but he's fine. They're...
they're treating him fine.
I thought you two were with Jack at the beach.
what are you guys doing out here?
Jack was trying to communicate with Sayid and Desmond on the freighter, but their sat phone ran out of juice.
it's totally dead.
there's no way we can call the boat.
so we vonteered to get the spare batteries out of the packs that we threw out of thehopper.
so... if you threw your pack from the chopper, what's that?
this? it's...
just borrowed this.
mind if I take a look?
go ahead, Dan. Show her.
batteries, huh?
what's this...
what?
that woman... what was her name?
the two of you friends?
not exactly.
she was my therapist.
you people had therapists?
it's very stressful being an other, Jack.
seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.
I'm sure there are things from your past that you'd rather not talk about.
Yeah.
you read them all in my file.
trust me, Jack.
you don't wanna see my file.
the problem occurs somewhere during the second trimester, when the mother's immune system is triggered.
the white blood cell count plummets.
it's like the...
immune system turns on the fetus.
may I? - Sure.
any thought yet on a cause?
mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women who've conceived on the island does it happen to...
which makes me wonder... - Hey, Juliet.
Oh, Ben, I didn't know you were here.
Ethan's out sick.
I have an extra egg salad on rye.
I was just checking to see if Juliet wants it.
Thanks. No, I already ate.
Oh, besides, I have an appointment with your wife in ten minutes.
great.
tell her I said hi.
Oh, will do.
no, I'm fine.
so, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?
he's great.
uh, very smart...
and intense.
challenging.
he's been really good to me.
of course he has.
you look just like her.
I'm sorry?
and I see you and my husband have become friendly.
Yeah.
he's great.
he's been really helpful.
when did you start sleeping with him?
what?
look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot.
so just tell me.
when did it start?
okay.
I'm not doing this. We're done.
no. Please respect me enough to spare me the pretense that you are actually offended.
I know.
I followed you.
watched you.
I'm sorry.
it doesn't matter anymore.
but what does matter is that you listen to me and that you believe me.
and if you continue to have a relationship with Goodwin, there will be consequences.
I don't want him to get hurt.
I would never hurt him.
look it, I am not talking about you.
I am talking about Ben.
Hi, John.
Hey, Claire.
is there something I can do for you?
I wanna know what's going on with Miles.
right now not a whole lot. I'm...
bringing him food and water until he decides to talk.
I'd like to talk to him melf.
and why would you want to do that?
John, we have to find out who these people are and where they came from and why they're not interested in rescuing us.
and you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?
no, I...
I just think we might be taking the wrong approach.
I mean, you killed one, Ben shot one, and now we're holding one prisoner.
you know, it's not hard to understand why they might think we're hostile.
I might be just a little less intimidating.
it's not gonna happen, Claire.
John, I don't...
you do remember what Charlie said about these people.
all Charlie said was whose boat it isn't.
don't you wanna know whose boat it is?
rabbit today?
running out of chickens.
this didn't have a number on it, did it?
what?
eat, change, put your laundry and dishes by the door.
I'll be back to collect them in 15 minutes.
so has the revolution begun yet? Or...
what are you talking about?
well, you're the leader now.
I know it's a tough position.
you have to deal with all those people constantly second-guessing your decisions, and it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it?
a question here, a comment there, and then if you're not careful, you find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands.
believe me, your people are gonna be so angry
when they realize you still don't have a plan.
and I assume you have a plan.
I always have a plan.
does it involve you raising 3. 2 million?
that's a lot of money.
wait.
maybe this'll get you started.
put your laundry and dishes by the door.
I can help you, John.
we have sharednterests...
or at least a common enemy.
and that would be our friends on the freighter.
not them.
the one they work for.
let me out of here.
give me some semblance of freedom, let me sleep in bed and eat with utensils, and I give you my word I'll tell you everything you wanna know - About the person who sent the freighter. - Yeah, but see, there's the problem.
I don't trust your word.
all right, then.
I guess I'll have to show you.
I hope this is good.
I don't know much about wine.
I swiped this off the sub.
there. - Thanks.
I wish we could do this all the time.
I hate that we have to be so... private.
what's the matter with being private?
it's ridiculous.
I've been sleeping on the couch for a year.
why am I not just telling her?
I don't think it's a good idea.
why not?
Ben wouldn't like it.
that's what th is about? You're worried about Ben?
Why? Because he has a crush on you?
you know?
come on. Everyone knows.
he follows you around like a puppy.
and you don't think that's a problem?
now a little less than ailometer from here, he has me working with chemicals that could kill every man, woman and child on this island if I flip the wrong switch.
trust me, Ben has enough on his plate.
the last thing he cares about is you and me.
I just.
get the feeling that he uld be upset.
what's Ben gonna do?
you see where the tail landed?
Yeah, probably in the water.
you run, you can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.
there may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em...a passenger. You're in shock.
come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don'T.
listen, learn, don't get involved.
I want lists in three days. Go.
something's wrong. We should've...
we should've caught up with 'em by now.
these people base jumped out of a helicopter, Jack.
let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.
Hey, it's okay.
it's okay.
it's all right.
it's okay.
take it easy.
take it easy.
I'll go get her some water.
Yeah. Thanks.
what happened?
I was going back to the beach, and...
I ran into Faraday and that woman...
Charlotte.
I think she hit me.
they disapared out of camp last night.
we've been trying to catch up with them.
do you know where they were headed?
some sort of...
power station.
they had gas masks.
all right, no tricks.
you're not leading me out into the jungle so you can disappear or shoot me in the back.
no tricks, John.
we don't even have to leave the living room.
so let's have it.
we have a deal, right?
how do I know you're not gonna run off and meet your people first chance you get?
if my people still wanted me, John, they would've stormed this camp long ago.
it's behind that picture.
36, 15, 28.
red Sox"?
I taped over the game.
this is Charles Widmore.
this is the man whose boat is parked offshore.
this is the man that's been trying to find the island.
who's the man in the blindfold?
one of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.
how does Widmore know about the island?
I don't know, but he does.
what does he want?
John, three months ago in Gainesville, Florida, the Virgin Mary seemed to appear in a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex.
when the word got out, over 5, 000 people came to see her face for themselves.
you've survived an airline crash on this island.
one minute, you're in a wheelchair.
the next minute, you're doing jumping Jacks.
if 5, 000 people came out to see a piece of mold, how many people do you think would come here to see you?
Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island, and he'll do everything in his power to possess it.
everything I know about Charles Widmore is in this file.
some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork, some of it's concrete.
but this is everything, and now it's all yours.
I'm sorry I di't tell you all th sooner.
but it was the only bargaining chip I had left.
there's one more thing I need to know.
your man on the boat...
I want you to tell me who it is.
all right.
but you might want to sit down.
she came through here.
so did they, about half an hour ahead of her.
what happened?
sorry?
at Locke's...why did you stay?
I stayed because I had to find something out.
are you gonna tell me, or are we gonna keep walking through the jungle like it doesn't matter?
I stayed to find out if the peoplon the freighter know who I am, if they knew that I'm a fugitive, that I'm wanted for murder.
do they?
Yeah, they know.
we should keep moving.
God knows where Juliet is.
come on in.
sorry. I have to get this ham out of the oven, or it'll dry out.
please. Don't mind me.
how are you feeling, by the way?
never better.
it smells delicious.
Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.
just you and me.
Oh, I guess I should've made that clearer.
no.
it's fine. I...I hope you like dinner rolls.
I indeed.
I wanna thank you fohow wonderful you've been with Zach and Emma.
they're really sweet kids.
Ben, they've been asking me about their mother in los angeles.
I'm not really sure what to say.
they'll stop asking in time.
they're children.
do they really belong here?
they're on the list, Juliet.
who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
now that we have everyone on the list from the tail section, what about Goodwin?
he's been undercover for three weeks.
he's making a case for this woman...Ana Lucia.
he thinks she'd be a valuable member of our society.
but betwn you and me, I don't see it.
he feels very passionately about her, almost inappropriately so.
after losing Ethan, it's a risk.
Goodwin stays where he's at right now, Juliet.
there's no reason for him to hurry back, right?
but his assignment will be over soon.
I promise you.

Shephard's file.
mikhail dropped it off.
he's a spinal surgeon, Ben.
he has extensive experience in tumor removal.
how about that?
he can help you.
I thought you'd be more excited.
what's wrong?
I need you to come with me.
after our last raid on the tail section survivors, they ran off, left the beach.
I sent Pickett and Tom to track their location, and they came across this.
I'm sorry, Juliet.
sorry about what?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
what happened?
we don't know. There weren't any witnesses.
I can only assume they found out he wasn't one of them.
guess I should've listened to you.
why are you showing me this?
why did you bring me out here?
what, you mean instead of his wife?
you knew this would happen.
you sent him out here because you knew this would happen.
you wanted this!
you wanted him to die!
Why?
Why"?
you're asking me why?
after everything I did to get you here, after everything I've done to keep you here, how can you possibly not understand...
that you're mine?
take as much time as you need.
whoa, Kate, it's all right.
they're on our side.
our side, Juliet?
she just knocked me unconscious.
Yeah. I'm very sorry about that, but I had no choice.
look, Daniel's inside securing the facility.
if you come with me, I will be more than happy to explain exactly how we just saved your life.
all right. Let go.
I'll take their word for it.
you okay?
he wanted me to kill them.
he told me to kill both of them.
how can he tell you anythi?
I don't know, but he knew w to get to me, and he knew where they were going and what they were doing.
don't you understand?
these people came here to wage war against Ben, and Ben's gonna win, Jack.
and when he does, you don't want to be anywhere near me.
why not?
because he thinks that I'm his.
and he knows how I feel about you.
he knows where to find me.
beat that.
son of a bitch!
how'd you get so damn good at horse shoes?
I don't know.
guess I'm just...lucky.
what the hell are you doing out?
see you guys at dinner.
how did you know my father?
he came to see his daughter.
my daughter was on your plane.
her name was claire.
we're here to geta blood sample from you and one from your son aaron.
Why?
to determine your relationshipto the child.
where you going, mommy?
we're going on vacation, baby.
wait, you're in L. A?
of course I can meet, yeah.
Hello, kate.
you okay?
get me to the car.
sayid, you've been attacked. - Where's hurley?
the only wayto save the island, john, is to get your people back here.
how? How am isupposed to do that?
what? - You've...
do you knowwhat's happening to me?
Oh, you don't haveto whisper.
when he's out, he's out.
at least one of uscan sleep.
it's gonna takemore than two nights for me to get usedto sleeping in a normal bed.
what are we gonna doabout him?
I don't know.
I've been thinking a lotabout him.
did you know that clairewas flying to L. A. To give him up for adoption?
no. No, I didn'T.
I think we should sayhe's mine.
what?
we could say that I wassix months pregnant when I was arrested and that I ge birth to himon the island. No one would ever know.
Kate, no. You don't have to...
there's other waystoo this.
after everyone we've lost--michael, jin, sawyer...
I can't lose him, too.
Sawyer's not dead.
no. But he's gone.
good night, jack.
if we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna protectthe people that we left behind, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna haveto convince everyone to lie.
if it's just me, they're never gonna go for it.
so I'm gonnaturn to you first.
are you with me?
I have always been with you.
three YEARS LATER how does it fit?
it's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.
looks great on you.
are you sure you want to do this?
it was your idea.
mommy!
aaron, honey, mommy's gonnarun out and do an errand.
I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.
don't worryabout us, kate.
there's candy in the minibarand a hundred channels on tv.
we're going to bejust fine here.
I don't know what I would'vedone if you weren't here.
thank you.
it's what any friendwould do.
okay, well, I will be back soon.
okay, you be good for sun. Okay, honey?
good luck.
delivery for you, ms. Kwon.
thank you.
I'll be right back, honey.
what the hell's wrong with her? She's been out for ten minutes.
stop shouting, james.
Hey, man.
thank you.
if there's something that you want to tell me, daniel, now would be a good time.
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.
she's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.
give us some space, would you?
she's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up.
he knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it.
James... go away.
did you know that this would happen?
I thought... I thought it might.
I think it's neurological.
our brains have an internal clock, a sense of time.
the flashes... throw the clock off.
it's like really bad jet lag.
really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, daniel.
you wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?
I don't know.
but thank god it's not.
thank you for waiting.
did my assistant offer you something to drink?
um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.
good. Please, ms. Austen, sit.
so... how can I help you?
Mr. Norton, when you came to mhouse looking for blood samples from me and my son,
I asked you who your client was...
and I said I couldn't tell you. - Yeah.
I'm here to offer you a deal.
I'll give you the blood samples, but first, I wanna talk to your client.
considering what you're asking for, that's more than reasonable.
well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today, and I will be sure to pass along your offer.
but I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be-- no.
and the reason, of course, is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals, and we both know it.
I have a signed court order compelling you to let us confirm that you're the child's mother.
I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it, but my client insists that we...
handle the exchange of custody quietly.
what do you mean "exchange of custody"?
you know exactly what I mean.
no, I...mr. Norton,
I just wanna know who is doing this to me.
you did this to yourself.
now it is time you prepare yourself, ms. Austen.
you are going to lose the boy.
we have to go back to the orchid.
excuse me?
the orchid.
that's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
that greenhouse is a long ways away.
you said you had a zodiac raft back at the beach.
we could take that, cut around the horn of the island, be at the orchid in half the time.
and let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.
no, not exactly at all, but I know that ben used it to leave the island.
and if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.
and how you gonna do that?
this is all happeningbecause they left.
I think it'll stopif I can bring them back.
bring who back? - Jack, sun, sayid, hugo, kate.
the boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.
they're not dead, james.
says who?
that doesn't matter.
all that mattersis they've gotta come back.
I have to make them come back...
even if it kills me.
don't you want 'emto come back, james?
don't you want her to ce back?
it doesn't matterwhat I want.
she's waking up!
are you okay?
who are you? - It's me.
it's daniel.
Oh, my head.
what happened?
there was another flash. You passed out.
how do you feel?
a bit dizzy, but...
I'm fine. - Good.
hooray. Everything's back to normal.
now what?
I'll tell you "now what.
we're going to the orchid.
Dilation's almostback to normal.
good. Now take this I. V. Out of my arm, and let's go.
sayid, you were unconsciousfor 42 hours.
you had the equivalent of threedoses of horse tranquilizer in your system.
if you sent that man to hurley'shouse, - we have to leave now. - You need to relax.
Ben is not gonna hurt hurley.
Ben is on our side.
the only side he's onis his own.
Dr. Shephard?
I'm dr. Ariza, director of clinical services.
a word with you, please?
I'll be right back.
what do you thinkyou are doing here?
I was treating a patient. I apologize. It was an emergency.
you were suspendedon charges of substance abuse.
emergency or not, dr. Shephard, you have no business being here.
I understand, and I take full responsibilityfor my actions.
no, doctor. The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions, and that makes usliable for them.
excuse me.
Hello? - jack? It's me.
Hey, did sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?
Yes. He did. Hurley, where are-- - is he okay?
he's fine. - Awesome.
hurley, where are you?
dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in L. A.County lockup.
Oh, and tell sayidI did exactly what he said.
I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now.
what are you talking about, hurley? Wait! Wait
good. You're here. How's sayid?
how you doing today, sir?
got your meds for you.
sorry, I think you havethe wrong room.
Nope. Room 133, right?
got the orders right here. But don't worry.
I won't have togive you an injection.
put thisright in your I. V. Line.
who are you? Who are you working for?
okay, talk, talk.
Address--it's in my pocket.
Hello, sayid.
what happened?
do we know anyonewho lives at 42 panorama crest?
that's kate's address.
Hello?
Kate? It's jack. Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
where are you right now? Are you at home?
what?

aaron is at a hotelwith sun.
sun? Sun's in L. A?
Yeah, she's here on business.

good. I'll go deal with hugo.
sorry, ben.
I'm not letting youget anywhere near him.
you have friends in trouble.
let's get them to safety and save the dirty linenfor later.
I'll drive.
after you get kate, meet us atthe long beach marina, slip 23.
and, jack... hurry. We're running out of time.
Hey, locke? What are you gonnasay to her?
sorry?
Kate. What are you gonna say to herto get her to come back?
I haven'tfigured that out yet.
well, let metell you something.
she was pretty excited to hop on that chopperand get the hell out of here.
what the hell is that?
whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.
beach is this way.
now you wanna takethe scenic route?
John... do you know when we are?
we need to keep moving.
how's your headache?
better.
nothing like sore feet to takeyour mind off your head, eh?
well, don't worry. Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the zodiac around the other sideof the island and rest.
you're sweet, but you don't needto baby me. I'm fine.
you okay?
I'm peachy.
now what?
nobody move.
James! - I got this.
it knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away.
babies know that stuff.
okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen.
do you want this baby?
do you want itto be safe and healthy?
you're not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours.
but I need you to push.
okay?
one, two, three... push!
come on, claire! Push!
okay! He's coming!
push! Push! Push! Push! push! Push! Push! Push!
what happened?
did you see somethingout here, james?
don't matter.
it's gone now.
you shaved your beard.
Yeah.
just needed a change.
look, jack, uh...
I don't know why you called, but I can't be dealingwith this right now.
what's going on?
nothing.
just...
can you just go?
why don't you just tell me?
Jack, please, just go.
Kate, please, tell me.
somebody wants aaron.
what?
there's a lawyer in there.
his clients--they know we're lying.
they know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away.
who's gonna take him away?
What--what are you doing?
look, I gotta go, all right?
get in or don'T.
you ready to tell mewho you saw back there?
already told you.
it was nothin'.
you and I both know when wwerebefore the flash, james.
so who was it you saw? Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?
and how is it that you knew when we were, johnny boy?
that light in the sky--it wasfrom the hatch, wasn't it?
the night that boone died...
I went out there and started pounding on itas hard as I could.
I was...
confused...
scared.
babbling like an idiot, asking, why was all thishappening to me?
did you get an answer?
light came on, shot up into the sky.
at the time, I thoughtit meant something.
did it? - No.
it was just a light.
so why'd youturn us around then?
don't you wannago back there?
why would I wanna do that?
so you could tell yourselfto do things different, save yourselfa world of pain.
no, I needed that painto get to where I am now.
I just got a nosebleed.
what?
when?
let's just notfreak out the others, okay?
just tell me...
Why--why her? Why me?
I don't know.
uh, I think it mighthave something to do with duration of exposure.
you know, the amount of timeyou'vepent on the island.
doesn't make any sense.
those yahooshave been here for months.
I've never been here before two weeks ago.
are you sure about that?
Hello?
the camp's bac finally.
anybody for a dharma beer?
Hello?
anybody here?
I wonder how long agothis happened.
son of a bitch!
what is it?
it's vincent'S.
yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog?
Where's the restof our people?
the zodiac's gone, too.
maybe your peopletook the boat.
why the hellwould they do that?
to get awayfrom whoever came in those.
where did these come from?
that's a good question.
they're pretty old.
not that old.
let me see that.
Ajira. It's an airline.
it's based out of india, but they fly everywhere.
great. Maybe they got a flightout of here to vegas tonight.
who came in these?
other others?
don't look at me.
my question is, when are they coming back?
let's not wait to find out.
this plan soundeda hell of a lot better when we weregoing by motorboat.
how far is this place?
it's around that point.
not more than a couple hours.
Oh, joy.
you all right?
I saw kate.
what?
last night, in the jungle.
before the last flash.
she was deliveringclaire's baby.
but that was two months ago.
time travel's a bitch.
get down!
paddle!
I think they want their boat back!
move!
these your people?
No! Are they yours?
shut up and keeping paddling!
little help!
little help!
paddle harder!
they're getting closer!
thank you, lord!
I take that back!
everybody, paddle!
head for the shore!
Kate, just because the guy told you that he wasmeeting his client doesn't meanthat they're here in L. A.
he could've just told you that to--to throw you off.
or they're in that hotelright now.
okay.
and what if they are?
what if the personwho wants to take aaron is sittingin that hotel room right now?
then what?
come on.
come with me.
we'll--we'll go get aaron, we'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.
all right.
Oh, my god.
it's claire's mother.
wait.
what am I waiting for, jack?
wait. I just...
let's just think about this for a minute. - She knows.
maybe she doesn't know.
no, but she knows about aaron, and that's all that matters!
t mego talk to her.
what?
if I can just explain to herwhy we did it-- maybe if I can get herto understand why...
she'll listen to me.
I can fix this, kate.
I can fix it.
aaron is my family, too.
Dr. Shephard?
Hello, ms. Littleton.
may I come in?
of course.
you look drenched.
no, no.
no, I'm fine.
God, I haven't seen yousince your father's funeral.
how did you even knowI was here?
I knew you were here, ms. Littleton, because I followedyour lawyer.
why would you do that?
I'm--I did it because, um...
I understand thatyou feel the need to do this.
but I need you to know that everything that kate and ihave done--it was for aaron.
who's...
Aaron?
I-I'm afraidI'm not following you.
ms. Littleton, um...
what are you doing herein los angeles?
let's go.
drive.
then call sun and tell her to bring aaronto the long beach marina.
we'll meet her there.
What--wh-whaare youtalking about?
what happened? - Kate, we have to go now.
I'm not going anywhere untilyotell me what just happened!
she doesn't know anything.
what?
she doesn't know.
she still thinksthat claire is dead.
she doesn't even knowthat aaron exists.
but the lawyer--she sued oceanic, and she's in town to pick up her settlement.
what, and it's justa coincidence that her lawyer happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?
I don't know.
but whoever's tryingto take aaron...
it's not her.
then who is it?
can I ask you something?
why'd you take it upon yourselfto rescue hugo?
I had to make surehurley was safe.
you can pull in over here.
Mr. Linus.
Mr. Norton.
I looked into it, and they don't have any kindof solid case against reyes.
the M. E.Said that the manfound outside santa rosa was killed before reyes escaped.
that's very good news.
we have a prelim hearingin the morning.
the judge will neverlet it get past that, and reyeswill be a free man.
thank you, dan.
anytime.
who was that?
that's my lawyer.
okay!
remind menever to dthat again.
where are we?
it's hard to saytill it gets light.
we didn't get a chanceto finish our conversation.
what conversation was that?
the one beforethey started shooting at us, where you were about to tell mehow it felt to see kate again.
I wasn't aboutto tell you anything.
why don't you tell me now?
I was close enoughto touch her.
if I wanted to, I could've...
stood right upand talked to her.
why didn't you?
what's done is done.
what's wrong?
Oi!
come and look at this!
it's wreckage.
looks like it just happened.
anybody speak french?
Jack, why did you call me today?
I told you. I S...
I was worried.
but why?
why wereyou worried?
why today?
I don'T...
right before I called you, sayid was attacked.
and the guy that did it--your address was in his pocket.
what's he doing here?
that's not importantright now.
what matters is that we getyou and aaron someplace safe.
safe from who?
Hello, kate.
it's okay.
he's with me.
he's with you?
I know this is gonnabe hard to understand, but he's here to help us.
to help everyonethat we left behind.
we all need to be together again.
it's him.
what?
it's him.
he's the one who's trying to take aaron.
no. No.
you-- you don't understand. No, jack.- She's right. It was me.
sorry.
who the helldo you think you are?
why don't youjust stay away?
why don't youleave me and my son alone?
because he's not your son, kate.
Robert...
no understand.
you speak english?
little.
are you okay?
Yes.
how did you get here?

what boat?
it's gone.
sink.
it must've been caughtin the same storm as ours.
who are you?
how long you in the water?
I don't know.
how do you not know how you wound up inthe middle of the ocean, ah?
merci, robert.
thank you.
what is your name?
Hello, jin.
I'm danielle.

think OF THE ISLAND LIKE A RECORD SPINNING ON A TURNTABLE,
only NOW, THAT RECORD IS SKIPPING.
whatever BEN LINUS DID DOWN AT THE ORCHID STATION,
it MAY HAVE... DISLODGED US.
come ON!
Aah!
we HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ORCHID.
that's WHERE ALL THIS STARTED. MAYBE IT'S WHERE IT'LL ALL STOP.
this IS ALL HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY LEFT.
I THINK IT'LL STOP IF I CAN BRING THEM BACK.

Hey, BOSS.

Yep. YOU WANNA TELL ME WHY I NEED IT?
cause OUR FEARLESS LEADER IS OUT BLOWING UP TREES.
Why's HE DOING THAT?
cause HE'S LOADED.
since WHEN DOES HORACE DRINK?
he DOESN'T, SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS ON THE DOWN LOW.
Oh, MAN.

Oh. THE BABY -- IT'S COMING.
Oh, HELL.
I'm NOT GONNA TELL HER.

there WAS ANOTHER FLASH, AND... AND SHE WAS...
she WAS JUST GONE.

she MOVED ON, AND WE STAYED.
I'm SO SORRY. -- HOLD ON. WAIT A MINUTE.
we "STAYED"?

I WON'T. -- OKAY.
okay. SWELL.
until DAN CHECKS BACK IN, I SAY WE HEAD BACK TO THE BEACH.
when LOCKE GETS BACK WITH EVERYBODY, THAT'S WHERE THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR US.
the BEACH?
what, YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH FLAMING ARROWS SHOT AT YOU?
and YOUR CAMP IS GONE. WHY BOTHER?
Sawyer's RIGHT, MILES.
we SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BEACH.
we SURVIVED THERE BEFORE. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.
or MAYBE WHEN WE GET THERE, YOU'LL -- YOU'LL WANNA GO BACK TO THE ORCHID AGAIN.
and THEN WHEN THAT GETS BORING, WE CAN HEAD BACK TO THE BEACH.
it's THE ONLY TWO PLANS YOU PEOPLE HAVE.
Hey, ZIP IT. I'M HEADING BACK TO THE BEACH.
if OUR STUFF'S THERE, GREAT. IF NOT, WE BUILD NEW STUFF.
you DON'T LIKE THE PLAN, GOOD LUCK.
who PUT HIM IN CHARGE?
thanks FOR GETTING MY BACK FOR THAT WHOLE BEACH ISSUE.
you SHOULD THANK ME. IT WAS A STUPID IDEA.
well, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU AGREEING WITH ME?
any PLAN IS BETTER THAN NO PLAN.
besides, IF I HADN'T AGREED WITH YOU, WE'D STILL BE ARGUING ABOUT WHERE TO GO NEXT.
I JUST HOPE YOU FIGURE OUT SOMETHING BETTER BEFORE WE GET THERE.
well, I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.
Oh, NO!
no.
? ? no, PAUL!
Oh, GOD! OH, GOD! NO, NO, NO, NO!
no, PLEASE! WE DIDN'T KNOW!
Paul, PLEASE, PLEASE DO SOMETHING.
no, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WE WERE JUST TOURING THIS PARK.
we DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. WE WERE JUST HAVING -- PAUL.
Paul, PLEASE.
Oh, MY GOD! NO!
no, PAUL, PLEASE. PLEASE.
who DO YOU THINK THEY ARE?
who CARES WHO THEY ARE? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN THEY ARE.
Hey.
we DON'T GET INVOLVED, RIGHT?
that's WHAT YOU SAID.
doesn't MATTER WHAT WE DO.
whatever HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
Yeah, THANKS ANYWAY, PLATO.
I'm GOING OVER THERE. YOU STILL GOT MY BACK?
Absolutely.
Paul, PAUL. TALK TO ME!
talk TO ME, PAUL! -- ON YOUR FEET!
no, I CAN'T! I CAN'T! -- COME ON, GET UP! NOW!
Aah! -- SHUT UP!
all RIGHT, DROP THE GUN!
Oh, GOD.
it's ALL RIGHT.
it's OKAY. YOU'RE SAFE.
it's OVER.
who ARE YOU?
her FRIEND'S WEARING A DHARMA JUMPSUIT.
that PUT US '70S, '80S.
the GUYS WITH THE BAGS -- OTHERS?
beats ME.
what, Y'ALL DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER?
before MY TIME.
Sawyer. WALKIE.
we NEED TO GO.
I'm ON IT.
listen, SWEETHEART, WE GOTTA GET MOVING NOW.
who ARE YOU PEOPLE?
our SHIP WRECKED HERE ON THE WAY TO TAHITI. BUT THAT AIN'T IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE WHOEVER'S ON THE OTHER END OF THIS THOSE TWO MIGHT'VE GIVEN 'EM A CALL BEFORE WE SAVED YOU.
we HAVE TO BURY THEM.
bury THEM? WE AIN'T GOT TIME TO BURY NOBODY.
we HAVE TO. THE TRUCE.
Oh, GOD. WE HAVE TO BURY THEM.
and -- AND WE HAVE...
we HAVE...
and WE HAVE TO BRING IT -- HIM BACK HOME.
we HAVE TO BRING PAUL BACK WITH US.
please.
please?
please.
I'll CARRY HIM.
all RIGHT, WE'LL PUT THESE GUYS IN THE GROUND
and CARRY YOUR FRIEND BACK, BUT WE BETTER DO IT FAST.
he WASN'T... MY FRIEND.
he WAS MY HUSBAND.
all RIGHT, LISTEN UP.
when WE GET THERE, THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
so JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. LET ME DO THE TALKING.
you REALLY THINK YOU CAN CONVINCE THEM THAT WE WERE IN A BOAT WRECK?
I'm A PROFESSIONAL. I USED TO LIE FOR A LIVING.
Daniel! STOP!
turn IT OFF.
turn WHAT OFF? -- WHATEVER THAT IS.
it LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF SONIC FENCE OR SOMETHING.
where DID YOU SAY YOUR SHIP WAS GOING?
listen, SISTER, WE'RE THE ONES WHO JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE AND HID THOSE BODIES.
so HOW ABOUT YOU TRUST US AND TURN THAT DAMN THING OFF?
okay.
okay, FINE.
"Sonic FENCE"? DIDN'T I SAY LET ME DO THE TALKING?
one MORE STEP, DAN WOULD'VE FRIE HIS BRAIN.
his BRAIN'S ALREADY FIRED.
okay, IT'S OFF.
you FIRST.
see? IT'S FINE.
all RIGHT, LET'S GO.
and GOING FORWARD, WE SHOULD ALL DO A BETTER JOB OF TRUSTIN'
you're GONNA BE OKAY, AMY. JUST TRY AND RELAX.
Where's HORACE? DOES HE KNOW HIS WIFE'S IN LABOR?
he's UNAVAILABLE.
look, AMY'S IN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.
the BABY'S BREECH. -- WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
it's UPSIDE DOWN. SHE NEEDS A CAESAREAN.
well, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT. JUST DO IT.
I'm AN INTERNIST, NOT AN OBSTETRICIAN.
our WOMEN ALWAYS DELIVER ON THE MAINLAND. AMY WAS SUPPOSED TO GET ON THE SUB ON TUESDAY.
the BABY'S TWO WEEKS EARLY.
can YOU DELIVER THIS BABY OR NOT?
I DON'T KNOW.
Hey, MAN. WHERE IS SHE?
what's UP? -- AMY'S HAVING HER BABY.
what? -- MM.
did YOU HEAR ME?
she's IN TROUBLE.
doc SAYS SHE NEEDS A CAESAREAN.
we HAD AN AGREEMENT.
screw OUR AGREEMENT.
he AIN'T NEVER DONE ONE. I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE.
don't YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY TIME I TRY TO HELP A WOMAN ON THIS ISLAND GIVE BIRTH,
it HASN'T WORKED?
well, MAYBE WHATEVER MADE THAT HAPPEN HASN'T HAPPENED YET.
you GOTTA TRY. YOU GOTTA HELP HER.
you're THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN.
the BABY'S BREECH.
Yes, BUT -- DID YOU TRY AN EXTERNAL CEPHALIC VERSION?
what? NO. I -- IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE.
I'm GONNA NEED A NUMBER 12 SCALPEL, 14-GAUGE SUTURES -- HALF-ROUND IF YOU'VE GOT THEM
and AN EPIDURAL ANESTHETIC. -- YOU'RE GONNA NEED?
where IS HORACE?
I'm SPEAKING FOR HORACE NOW, AND I SAY SHE'S DELIVERING THIS BABY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I WANT HER.
I WANT HER TO DO IT.
you HEARD THE LADY.
listen...
you're GONNA DO GREAT.
I KNOW YOU ARE.
okay.
okay.
Hey.
is EVERYTHING OKAY?
Amy WENT INTO LABOR.
I KNOW.
is SHE OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
there's A PROBLEM.
Juliet's IN THERE.
Juliet?
I PULLED HER OUT OF RETIREMENT.
any LUCK?
we FINISHED GRID 1-3-3 TODAY.
no SIGN OF OUR PEOPLE.
no ONE.
well, 1-3-4 THEN.
how LONG DO WE LOOK, JAMES?
as LONG AS IT TAKES.
what HAPPENED?
it's A BOY.
he's OKAY? SHE'S OKAY?
everyone's OKAY.
how's YOUR HEAD?
it HURTS.
where ARE MY PEOPLE? -- THEY'RE FINE.
Amy TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED IN THE JUNGLE,
and I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DID.
well, Y'ALL GOT A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION.
we HAVE CERTAIN DEFENSE PROTOCOLS.
there ARE HOSTILE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ON THIS ISLAND,
and WE DON'T GET ALONG WITH THEM.
so...
why DON'T YOU TELL ME WHO THE HELL YOU ARE?
my NAME'S JAMES LAFLEUR.
you CAN CALL ME JIM. -- HOW'D YOU GET TO THE ISLAND, JIM?
if MY FRIENDS ARE SAFE,
why ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THE QUESTIONS?
they TOLD ME I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
that YOU'RE THE BOAT CAPTAIN.
we GOT CAUGHT IN A STORM. OUR SHIP WRECKED.
must've HIT THE REEF.
thankfully, WE WASHED UP ON SHORE.
what KIND OF SHIP?
a SALVAGE VESSEL.
searching FOR A FAMOUS LOST WRECK.
it's AN OLD SLAVER OUT OF PORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND, CALLED "THE BLACK ROCK."
you HEARD OF HER?
can't SAY THAT I HAVE.
so... ONCE YOU GOT WASHED ASHORE,
why WERE YOU THEN WANDERING AROUND IN THE JUNGLE?
some OF OUR CREW WERE MISSIN'. WE WERE LOOKING FOR 'EM.
that's WHEN WE CAME UPON YOUR GIRL INSTEAD.
well...
I TELL YOU WHAT, JIM.
if YOUR CREW SHOWS UP, WE'LL SEND 'EM ALONG WITH YA.
send 'EM WHERE?
there's A SUBMARINE THAT LEAVES THIS ISLAND FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
you AND YOUR FRIENDS, YOU'RE GONNA GET ON IT.
it's GONNA DROP YOU OFF IN TAHITI.
you CAN FIND YOUR WAY HOME FROM THERE.
hold ON A MINUTE, CHIEF.
we JUST SAVED THAT WOMAN'S LIFE.
doesn't THAT EARN US A WEEK OR TWO TO FIND THE REST OF OUR PEOPLE?
Nope.
only PEOPLE THAT ARE ALLOWED TO STAY ON THIS COMPOUND ARE MEMBERS OF THE DHARMA INITIATIVE.
and LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
please, JIM, BUT YOU ARE NOT DHARMA MATERIAL.
we're SCREWED.
he's PROBABLY TRYING TO EXPLAIN TIME TRAVEL BY NOW.
Sawyer's GONNA BE FINE.
what ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?
I LIVED HERE FOR OVER THREE YEARS.
that WAS MY HOUSE OVER THERE.
you WERE IN THE DHARMA INITIATIVE?
no.
the OTHERS TOOK OVER THESE BARRACKS
and WIPED OUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM.
they BROUGHT ME HERE ON A SUB A LONG TIME AFTER THAT.
well...
welcome HOME.
no MORE FLASH?
no.
no MORE FLASH.
the RECORD IS SPINNING AGAIN.
we're JUST NOT ON THE SONG WE WANNA BE ON.
Where's DAD? -- COME ON, LUV.
hello.
somebody WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY TO SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOMS.
in THE MEANTIME, MR. LAFLEUR HERE CAN FILL YOU IN ON THE SITUATION.
Mr. LAFLEUR?
it's CREOLE.
improvised.
what HAPPENED IN THERE?
well, HE BELIEVED MY STORY.
but WE'RE GETTIN' PUNTED.
the BASTARD'S PUTTIN' US ON THEIR SUB TOMORROW
and SHIPPING US OFF TO TAHITI.
how's THAT BAD NEWS?
you GUYS, COME ON! NOW!
let's GO! GET IN! GET IN! MOVE!
let's GO! GET OUT OF HERE! COME ON! COME ON!
come ON!
inside!
move! NOW!
keep AN EYE ON THEM.
Hello, MR. ALPERT.
Hello, MR. GOODSPEED.
I WISH YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME YOU WERE COMING.
I WOULD'VE TURNED THE FENCE OFF FOR YOU.
that FENCE MAY KEEP OTHER THINGS OUT, BUT NOT US.
the ONLY THING THAT DOES KEEP US OUT, HORACE,
is OUR TRUCE...
which YOVE NOW BROKEN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
where ARE MY TWO MEN?
you KNOW WHAT?
gettin' ON THAT SUB IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
what DO YOU SAY? SUB ANYONE?
hold YOUR HORSES, BANZAI. NO ONE'S GETTIN' ON A SUB.
okay, LAFLEUR,
how WELL D YOU BURY THOSE BODIES???
well, THAT DEPENDS ON HOW HARD HE LOOKS.
call THE ARROW.
tell THEM WE'RE AT CONDITION ONE.
take THE HEAVY ORDNANCE,
and MAKE SURE THE FENCE IS AT MAXIMUM.
Yes, SIR.
let ME TALK TO HIM.
excuse ME?
your BUDDY OUT THERE WITH THE EYELINER
let ME TALK TO HIM.
we HAD A TRUCE WITH THESE PEOPLE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND I'M THE ONE THAT KILLED HIS MEN,
and I'M THE ONE THAT'S GONNA GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM WHY I DID IT.
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.
well, IT'S A GOOD THING I AIN'T ASKING YOUR PERMISSION.
are YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
not YET.
but I'LL FIGURE SOMETHIN' OUT.
Hello, RICHARD.
I'm SORRY. DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?
I'm THE GUY THAT KILLED YOUR MEN.
heard SOME GUNSHOTS,
saw TWO MEN THROWING A BAG OVER A WOMAN'S HEAD.
gave 'EM A CHANCE TO THROW THE WEAPONS DOWN AND WALK AWAY,
but ONE OF THEM TOOK A SHOT AT ME, AND I DEFENDED MYSELF.
is THAT SO?
that's SO.
your PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS?
they AIN'T MY PEOPLE, HOSS.
so IF YOU GOT SOME KIND OF A TRUCE WITH THEM,
it AIN'T BEEN BROKEN.
if YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER OF THE DHARMA INITIATIVE,
then WHAT ARE YOU?
did YOU BURY THE BOMB?
excuse ME?
the HYDROGEN BOMB WITH "JUGHEAD" WRITTEN ON THE SIDE.
did YOU BURY IT? -- HOW...
Yeah, I KNOW ABOUT IT.
I ALSO KNOW THAT 20 YEARS AGO,
some BALD FELLA LIMPED INTO YOUR CAMP
and FED YOU SOME MUMBO JUMBO ABOUT BEING YOUR LEADER.
and THEN POOF...
he WENT AND DISAPPEARED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YA.
any OF THIS RINGIN' A BELL?
that MAN'S NAME IS JOHN LOCKE,
and I'M WAITIN' FOR HIM TO COME BACK.
so... -- YOU STILL THINK I'M A MEMBER OF THE DAMN DHARMA INITIATIVE?
no.
I GUESS I DON'T.
but NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, TWO OF MY MEN ARE DEAD.
and MY PEOPLE NEED SOME KIND OF JUSTICE.
now WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT?
how ARE YOU DOING, AMY?
is HE GONE?
no, HE'S NOT GONE.
we TOLD HIM WHERE THE BODIES WERE.
you TOLD HIM? WHY?
we HAD TO.
it WAS THE ONLY WAY TO MAINTAIN THE TRUCE.
Jim HERE WORKED IT OUT WITH HIM, BUT...
well, HE'S GONNA NEED SOMETHING FROM US NOW.
he NEEDS TO TAKE PAUL'S BODY BACK WITH HIM.
no.
listen, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME, YEAH?
so THIS IS COMPLETELY YOUR CHOICE.
if YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM TO THEM, THEN
we WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
they CAN TAKE HIM.
he WOULD WANT TO KEEP US SAFE.
can I HAVE A MINUTE, PLEASE?
I'm SORRY.
you NEED SOME HELP? -- HMM? OH.
Nah, I'VE GOT IT. THANKS.
Hey, JIM,
the SUB LEAVING TOMORROW MORNING -- IT RETURNS IN TWO WEEKS.
until THEN, YOU CAN STAY AND LOOK FOR THE REST OF YOUR CREW.
Thanks.
I BOUGHT US TWO WEEKS.
horace SAID WE CAN WAIT FOR THE NEXT SUB.
any LUCK, LOCKE'LL BE BACK BY THEN.
and THEN WHAT?
what DO YOU MEAN, "THEN WHAT"?
locke SAID HE WAS LEAVING TO SAVE US.
the FLASHES HAVE STOPPED.
they're OVER.
no MORE BLOODY NOSES.
we're ALREADY SAVED.
that SUB BEHIND YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.
I've BEEN TRYING TO GET OFF OF THIS ISLAND FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS,
and NOW I'VE GOT MY CHANCE.
I'm GOING TO LEAVE.
you DO REALIZE IT'S 1974,
that WHATEVER IT IS YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING BACK TO...
it DON'T EXIST YET.
it's NOT A REASON NOT TO GO.
well, WHAT ABOUT ME?
you REALLY GONNA LEAVE ME HERE WITH THE MAD SCIENTIST
and MR. "I SPEAK TO DEAD PEOPLE"?
and JIN, WHO'S A HELL OF A NICE GUY
but NOT EXACTLY THE GREATEST CONVERSATIONALIST.
you'll BE FINE.
maybe...
but WHO'S GONNA GET MY BACK?
come ON.
just GIVE ME TWO WEEKS, THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
two WEEKS.
all RIGHT. TWO WEEKS.
<I> three YEARS LATER</I>
Mmm, SOMETHIN' SMELLS GOOD.
hey THERE.
is THAT FOR ME?
you WERE AMAZING TODAY.
thank YOU FOR BELIEVING IN ME.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
wake UP, BOSS.
Ah.
how's YOUR HEAD?
it HURTS.
I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.
what YOU WANT FIRST?
good NEWS.
you're A DADDY.
bad NEWS IS YOU MISSED IT.
Oh, GOSH.
she HAD THE BABY?
it's A BOY.
a BOY?
Mm.
now HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME WHY YOU'RE TOO BUSY DRINKIN' AND BLOWIN' UP TREES
to SEE HIM BE BORN?
I WAS, UH...
I WAS LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF SOCKS,
and ALL OF MINE WERE DIRTY, SO I WENT TO GRAB A PAIR OF AMY'S, AND...
I FOUND THIS...
in THE BACK OF HER DRAWER.
it WAS PAUL'S.
you GOT IN A FIGHT OVER A NECKLACE?
I KNOW.
but...
it's ONLY BEEN THREE YEARS, JIM.
just THREE YEARS THAT HE'S BEEN GONE.
is THAT REALLY LONG ENOUGH TO GET OVER SOMEONE?
I HAD A THING FOR A GIRL ONCE.
and I HAD A SHOT AT HER,
but I DIDN'T TAKE IT.
for A LITTLE WHILE, I'D LAY IN BED EVERY NIGHT, WONDERING IF IT WAS A MISTAKE.
wondering IF...
I'd EVER STOP THINKING ABOUT HER.
and NOW I CAN BARELY REMEMBER WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.
I MEAN, HER FACE -- IT'S...
she's JUST GONE,
and SHE AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK.
so...
is THREE YEARS LONG ENOUGH TO GET OVER SOMEONE?
Absolutely.
Oh.
what?
wait. WHAT?
ho -- NO.
don't BRING 'EM IN.
just MEET ME IN THE NORTH VALLEY.
who WAS IT?
James, WHAT'S GOING ON?
it WAS JIN.
is EVERYTHING OKAY? -- YEAH.
I JUST...
I GOTTA GO.
this is your daughter.
her name'slementine.
those are fake necklaces.
I'll take the one on the end.
why'd you help me?
just one girl watching another girl's back, I guess.
why are you telling me this?
just do it, freckles.
I think we should say he's mine.
there's other ways to do this.
after everyone we've lost, I can't lose him, too.
my client insists that we...
handle the exchange of custody quietly.
you are going to lose the boy.
that's claire's mother.
everything that kate and i have done, it was for aaron.
who's... aon?
I'm ben.
it's nice to meet you, ben.
if I let you out...
will you take me with you to your people?
that's why I'm here.
what are you doing here hello, jin? Are you there?
Jin? Can you hear me?
Hello?
Jin? It's--it's phil, man. Where have you been?
the hostile escaped. We're searching the east grid.
he's headed north.
how the hell do you know that?
because he attacked me.
what? Where are you?
Jin? ! you still there? Jin? Jin!
please help.
okay, everybody, listen up.
we don't know yet if another attack is coming.
so everybody needs to be ready for your security assignments, okay?
make sure you're in contact with your team leaders.
lafleur's got search parties out, but the hostile's got a good jump on us.
we're pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion in order to escape.
is he talking about sayid?
if he was locked up, how could he start the fire?
who are you?
Jack shephard. I'M... I'm new.
ll, jack, the way he started the fire is he had help, okay?
somebody torched that van, and then that somebody let him out of his cell.
and since the security cameras didn't pick up any hostiles crossing the perimeter, that means it was one of us.
Baxter, I want a full report on cleanup A. S.A. P.
you got it, horace.
Hey, you.
Yeah, you.
you're in the motor pool, right?
uh, yeah. - Do you mind running that winch for me?
you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
okay, no worries. Just throw this lever. When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.
all right. - See? Simple.
don't do it till I'm ready. - Okay.
all right, crank her up.
so they just stuck you in the motor pool when you got here?
Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah, same thing happened to me.
wait, hold. Hold it there. That's good right there. That's good.
I guess they couldn't sucker anybody into getting on that sub if they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors.
well, you gotta start somewhere, right? - Yeah.
what's your name? - I'm kate.
welcome aboard, kate. I'm roger. Roger linus.
it's nice to meet you, roger.
that's my kid.
that's my kid!
Hi, handsome. Did you have a good sleep?
Yeah, that's my boy.
catch a falling star and put it in your pocket never let it fade away catch a falling star and put it in your pocket save it for a rainy day
Oh, my god!
Hi, caidY.
Oh, my god! I saw you on the news!
I told all my friends, "i knowthat woman!
this is aaron. - Hi, aaron.
say hi.
you survived a plane crash.
it's amazing. I never thought I'd see you again. What are you doing here?
sawyer sent me.
so that son of a bitch is still alive?
he was when I left.
and he asked you to come here and give me an envelope full of money?
well, he--he told me where to find you, and...
said to take care of clementine... his daughter?
well, she's asleep in her crib right now.
want me to wake her up?
I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you.
I could've sent it, and I probably should have.
why did you tell me all this?
why'd you trust me?
because I thought your daughter had a right to know that her father cared.
why didn't he come back with the rest of you?
the helicopter that we were on was running out of gas, so he jumped so that we could make it to the boat.
what a coward.
he was trying to do the right thing.
he was trying to get away from you.
I told him he had a daughter.
he never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her.
so now I'm supposed to think he's a hero because he told you to come here and help us?
hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?
they gave us a settlement after the crash, and I didn't need it all
you don't have to explain it, kate.
you got the same look on your face I did when he ditched me.
all I have for you is sympathy.
is it his?
what? - Your son.
is it sawyer's?
no. No, I was...
pregnant before I met him.
that's not your baby, is it?
Kate, you just told me that you and your friends cooked a story for the whole world about what happened on that island.
so you tell me the truth about that?
why are you lying to me about him?
because i have to.
what happened?
what the hell are you doing here?
that was ben. That kid who was shot was ben.
was it sayid? Did he shoot him?
here's what you need to do, kate-- keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions.
cause putting any attention on yourself is the last thing I need right now.
now scram. I don't want you around here.
I just wanna know what's going on. - Lafleur.
what... what, uh... what's she doing here?
this is, uh... - I'm kate.
Kate. She's new over at the motor pool.
I was seeing if she saw anything suspicious, but she didn't, so...
you can run along, thanks.
have you checked out the hostile's cell yet?
I was a little busy trying to keep the town fromurnin' down, horace.
okay. Well, then let's do it.
he didn't break out. Somebody let him out.
these are janitor's keys.
we've only got three janitors.
there's roger, willie and, h, that new guy.
I just met him. His name's jack.
Yeah. I just brought him in from the sub. I'll go talk to him.
les, you wanna come with me?
Yeah, sure, boss.
all right, I want you to find jack and hurley and kate as quick as you can.
put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.
what for?
cause I don't want 'em talking to anybody else.
things are starting to spin out of control here.
all right, I got it. - All right, go.
who did this? Do you know who did this to my son?
not yet, but we're working on it. How's he doing?
I don't know. Juliet told me to wait out here.
let me see if I can get an update for ya.
Thanks, jim.
Roger? - Yeah?
you happen to have your keys with you?
Yeah. Why? What do you need?
I must've left them at... at the house.
it's all right. Don't worry about it.
more gauze.
here's some gauze. - Yeah, right hereyeah.
if we can't stop the hemorrhaging, we're just gonna have to pack the whole tract.
okay. - Where's the doctor?
at the looking glass station till friday.
how is he doing? - Not well. Hook him.
he's still bleeding in there somewhere, and I can't fix it.
it's all right. - No, it's not all right.
someone needs to get in there who can find the damage that bullet did and fix it.
he needs a real surgeon.
you're telling us we're under house arrest?
no, you're all free to leave whenever you want...
but I'll shoot you in the leg.
and whose idea was this?
who do you think?
Sawyer's just doing his job, jack.
what the hell are you doing, tubby?
checking to see if I'm disappearing.
what? - "Back to the future," man.
we came back in time to the island and changed stuff.
so if little ben dies, he'll never grow up to be big ben, who's the one who made us come back here in the first place.
which means we can't be here. And therefore, dude?
we don't exist.
you're an idiot.
am I? - Yeah. It doesn't work like that.
you can't change anything.
you're maniac iraqi buddy shot linus.
that is what always happened.
it's just... we never experienced how it all turns out.
this is really confusing.
Yeah, well, get used to it.
but the good news is that linus didn't die, so that means the kid can't either.
he'll be fine.
didn't look like he was gonna be fine.
what if you're wrong?
well, if I'm wrong, then I guess we all stop existing, and none of it matters anyway then, does it?
doc, I need you to come with me.
come with you where?
Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and we ain't got none to put back in him.
so we need you to show us where he sprung a leak.
no.
what?
no, I'm not coming with you.
if you don't come wi me, jack, that kid's gonna die.
then he dies.
what are you doing?
making some sandwiches.
I figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now.
he's just a boy, jack. You can'just let him die.
you heard miles. We can't change what's already happened.
this has nothing to do with me.
unless you're the onewho's supposed to save him.
30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery.
and then you're gonna come in and you're gonna beg me to operate on him because he's threatening to murder sawyer.
I've already done this once.
I've already saved benjamin linus, and I did it for you, kate.
I don't need to do it again.
this is our fault.
we brought sayid back. We caused this.
you know, when we were here before, I spent all of my time trying to fix things.
but... did you ever think that maybe the island just wants to fix things itself?
and maybe I was just... gettin' in the way?
you know, I don't like the new you.
I liked the old you, who wouldn't just sit around and wait for things to happen.
you didn't like the old me, kate.
where are you going?
just relax. You're okay.
I'm sorry. Juliet?
one of the new people is here.
she heard ben needed blood, says she's a universal donor.
this might hurt for a second.
good. very brave.
so james told me that jack wouldn't help, but he didn't say why.
if i understood why jack does what he does, I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.
off island, did something happen with you two?
we were engaged. Does that count?
what's going on?
Roger, I asked you to wait outside.
no, what's going on with my kid?
Kate is giving us some fresh blood so we can transfuse ben.
well, I'm not waitin' outside.
you know, he could stay with me, and you could check on ben, and--and roger here could keep me company, make sure I don't pass out.
okay. Roger, have a seat.
Thanks. - Sure.
he stole my keys. - Sorry?
LAFLEUR asked me where my keys were.
that bastard doesn't ask any questions he doesn't know the answers to...
which means my son stole my keys so he could bust that animal out of jail.
Why--why would he do that?
because of me.
you got kids?
no.
I thought I was gonna be the greatest father ever. You know?
I guess it didn't work out that way.
what about his mother? Is she still around?
no, she's dead.
she died the day he was born.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
I tried to do what I thought she'd want me to do, but...
I guess a boy just needs his mother.
what's going on? - He's going into hypoxic shock.
what does that mean? What's the matter with him? - He needs more oxygen.
Roger, get out of here! - What?
get him out of here! - Wait! What--what is
please, roger, just wait outside. - wait a minute.
let me get this straight.
all this already happened. - Yes.
so this conversation we're having right now...
we already had it. - Yes!
then what am I gonna say next?
I don't know.
then your theory is wrong!
for the thousandth time, you dingbat, the conversation already happened, but not for you and me.
for you and me, it's happening right now.
okay, answer me this.
if all this already happened to me, then...
why don't i remember any of it?
because once ben turned that wheel, time isn't a straight line for us anymore.
our experiences in the past and the future occurred before these experiences right now.
say that again.
shoot me. Please. Plea?
I can't shoot you.
because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come back to thesland on the freighter 30 years from now.
I can die because I've already come to the island on the freighter.
any of us can die because this is ourpresenT.
but you said ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up and become the leader of the others.
because this is his past.
but when we first captured ben, and sayid, like, tortured him, then why wouldn't he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?
I hadn't thought of that.
how is he?
he's stable.
is he gonna be okay?
he's got some fresh blood running through him, which is a good thing.
Roger, I need you to go out to the medical station.
there are some supplies there that we don't have here.
Hey, I just wanna say, I-I...
I wanna say thanks.
I know that you're doing everything you can...
to save him, and...
all right, I'm--I'm gonna go, okay?
is he any better?
he is stable now.
but I can't, um...
I can't fix it.
what about the sub?
I mean, can we takhim somewhere?
no. It's gone.
it won't be back for a couple of months.
but he can't die, right?
he is going to die.
he iin a medical situation that is not resolvable.
okay, well, we can't just sit here and do nothing.
I mean, there's got to be someone who can help him.
we have entire...
what?
maybe there's something they can do.
they"?
the others.
you got him?
Yeah. Ready?
one, two, three, go.
okay, let's go.
I'm coming wityou.
no, no, no, no.
if something goes wrong or we get caught, it doesn't matter for me, but you've got a whole life here.
and besides, if sawyer knew that I got you involved in this, he'd kill me.
how are you gonna manage?
I'll manag don't worry.
Kate, sawyer's gonna find out ben's gone, and when he does,
I have to tell him what happened.
but I'll give you as much of a head start as I can.
good luck.
there's someone...
someone here in los angeles.
let me take you to them.
who?
the same person that's gonna show us how to get back the island.
is that what this is about?
you knew about this.
no, I was o-- -and that is why you were pretending to care about aaron, to convince me to go back there?
I wasn't pretending anything.
this is insane. You guys are crazy.
kate-- -jack, don't!
mommy, I'm thirsty.
I need some milk.
do you want chocolate milk oregular milk?
juice box.
you don't want milk anymore?
juice box.
excuse me.
where are you juice boxes?
aisle 5.
thank you very much.
um, excuse me. Have you seen my son?
I'm sorry? -A little 3-year-old blond?
excuse me. I've lost my son.
he's 3. He's a little blond boy.
don't worry, ma'am. I'll make an announcement.
no, no, no. You have to seal off the store. You...
Hey, is this your mommy? Honey, is this your mommy?
I found him in the fruit section.
I--he looked lost. I was getting ready to make an announcement.
thank you. Thank you very much.
it's okay, honey. Mommy's got you.
mommy's got you.
tell...
tell my...
try not to talk, okay?
tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.
I know you gotta stop me...
but I can't just let that kid die.
damn it, freckles. I ain't here to stop you.
I'm here to help you.
Hi, auntie kate!
Hi, clementine.
is your mommy home?
sure. I'll go get her.
they're going back?
to the island?
why in god's name would they wanna do that?
I don't know.
Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave.
well, jack sounds like a piece of work.
you look exhausted. Drink this.
curl up on my bed. Take a nap. I'll watch your fella.
I lost him.
what?
I don't know what happened.
we were in the supermarket, and I turned around for one second, d he was gone.
and, you know, the crazy thing is, is that...
as scared as I was...
I wasn't surprised.
all I could think was, it's about time.
why would I feel that way?
I mean, why would I expect him to be taken?
because you took him, kate.
no, I...
Claire was gone.
I mean, she left him.
I had to take him. He needed me.
you needed him.
sawyer broke your heart.
how else were you supposed to fix it?
figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself?
well, the line's just right over there, right?
the others are on the other side.
well, they ain't right onthe her side.
we better get movin'.
why are you doing this?
why are you helping me?
when I found out ben was gone, and juliet told me what you were up to,
I asked that exact damn question...
why are you helping ben?
and she said...
no matter what he's gonna grow up to be, it's wrong to let a kid die.
so...
that's why I'm doing this.
I'm doing it for her.
Where's jack?
Uhhe--he's in the shower. I think.
is he in trouble?
I just need to talk to him.
you two mind giving us some privacy?
Hey, ask me more questions about time travel.
I needed you.
I'm sorry?
that kid was bleeding out.
you're a surgeon, and I needed you.
that kid is be -that's not ben yet.
he's just a kid.
Juliet, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
I'm not asking for your help, jack.
you made it pretty clear you weren't interested.
it's up to sawyer and kate now.
what?
she's trying to save him, and I sent james after her to help because they actually care.
I came back here because I care, juliet.
I came back here because I was trying to save you.
we didn't need saving!
we've been fine for three years.
you came back here for you.
at least do me the courtesy of telling me why.
I came back...
because I was supposed to.
supposed to do what?
I don't know yet.
well, you'd better figure it out.
you know, I can take him for a while.
sure you can.
you know, his father said that you think ben broke sayid out.
kid'll do almost anything if he's pissed off enough at his folks.
is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter?
did you?
of course I did.
go ahead and tip his ad back.
what's she like?
Yeah.
Oh, she's beautiful.
looks just like you wh she smiles.
she's growing up fast.
already has a little attitude.
I bet you and cassidy had a lot to talk about.
she had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper.
yeah? What's that?
she thought you were worried about what would happen if you didn'T.
you d me would've never worked out, kate.
I wasn't any more fit to be your boyfriend than I am to be that little girl's father.
you seem to be doing all right with juliet.
Yeah.
I've done a lot of growing up the past three years.
hands up!
do not move.
I said don't move.
this is a violation of the truce.
you're over the line. -We know.
this kid's been shot.
that's both of our problems.
so unless you want to go to war, you're gonna take us to richard alpert, and you're gonna do it now.
Mrs. Littleton, um, m kate austen.
I know who you are.
come in.
thank you.
your friend dr. Shephard came here last night, going on and on about some person named aaron.
when I asked him who that was, he ran out of here like the room was on fire.
he's your grandson.
and your daughter claire...
is alive.
what are you talking about?
Claire died in the plane crash.
no, she survived.
when we crashed, your daughter was eight months pregnant, and...
she's the one who gave birth on the island, not me.
we lied.
there were other survivors, too. We just left them behind.
Why?
why would you leave her there?
because she disappeared, and she left the baby behind.
we looked everywhere, but...
th's when I started taking care of aaron.
and when we were rescued, we didn't-- we had to decide what to do with him.
and I knew that she had wanted him to be adopted, but I couldn'T.
I had to protect him, so I said he was mine.
why did you lie?
why didn't you come to me in the first place?
because I needed him.
I'm sorry.
you're gonna see that he's so sweet and kind and good.
where is he?
um, I checked in two doors down.
he's asleep.
I know that this is a lot for you to handle.
but...
when you're ready, he's waiting for you.
I told him that you're his grandmother, that you'll take care of him while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.
where are you going?
I'm going back to find your daughter.
Bye-bye, baby.
don't worry. We got 'emright where we want 'em.
shut up and keep movin'.
what's it look like I'm doing?
hello there, james.
where the hell did you come from?
you asked my people to bring you to me.
here I am.
is that benjamin linus?
you two know each other?
what happened to him?
he was shoT.
and who might you be?
she's with me.
and why are you here?
cause we need you to save his life.
can you?
if I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.
what do you mean by that?
what I mean is that...
he'll forget this ever happened, and that...
his innocence will be gone.
he will always be one of us.
you still want me to take him?
Yes.
you shouldn't do this without asking ellie.
and if charles finds out-- -let him find out.
I don't answer to either of them.
Wh-where are you taking him?
come on.
Hello, ben.
welcome back to the land of the living.
Hello, Ben.
you're alive. - Yes, I am.
are you saying you know how to find them? How to find Jin?
I have some ideas.
so you knew
this would happen to Locke if we brought him back here?
dead is dead.
you don't get come back from that.
the Dharma folks at the swan work site
they're gonna drill into the ground
and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy,
and that will cause your plane-- oceanic 815
to crash on this island.
I think I can negate that energy.
if I can, then that hatch will never be built,
and your plane will land just like it's supposed to.
and just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.
Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it?
the hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury.
where is it?
listen to me. lower your gun, and we'll talk. okay?
nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.
I'm gonna give you three seconds.
one... - Don't do this.
what's he doing down there?
Jack, he's crazy. is he?
what if this is why we're here?
what if this is our one chance
to put things back the way they're supposed to be?
no. What the hell do you think you're doing?!
they shot him! I'm gonna go help.
Yeah, they're gonna shoot you.
we have to go, Jack. We have to go now.
Jack! - Don't you move!
don't move.
just who the bloody hell might you be?
what happened?
this man walked into camp and put a gun to my head,
and Eloise... reacted. Where'd you find them?
crouched in the bushes... like rats.
did you two come here with this man?
Yes.
put them in my tent.
would you care to tell me, Eloise,
why the Dharma initiative seems to have declared war on us?
these people aren't from the dharma initiative, Charles.
then where the hell are they from?
Richard, he's here.
I brought dinner.
Hello, Richard.
it's been a while.
it's--it's been, uh, three years.
what happened? What--where--where were you?
I'll explain on the way.
on the way where?
it's gonna be night soon.
you and I have an errand to run,
and we don't have a lot of time.
what's wrong?
something different about you.
I have a purpose now.
what's he doing here?
he helped me get back.
why did Locke say these were his people?
I thought they were yours.
when I left the island, John stepped in.
he's the leader now.
who's that man he's talking to?
his name is richard alpert.
he's a kind of...
advisor.
and he has had that job for a very very long time
sun? What are you...
were you here in 1977?
excuse me?
these people...
they were here with my husband
were you here?
do you remember them? A-any of them?
Yes, I was here 30 years ago.
and I do. I remember these people.
I remember meeting them very clearly, because...
I watched them all die.
drink of water?
do you think it's true?
they're all dead?
I don't think we went through all this for nothing, Sun.
I'm ready, John.
you still have that compass I gave you?
a little rusty, but she can still find north.
Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.
what, John, don't you trust me here with my former people?
afraid I'll stage a coup?
I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.
well, in that case, i'd love to come.
good.
stay here. we'll be back in a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can find out.
but whatever happens, sun, you have my word.
if there's a way for you and Jin to be together again,
if there's a way to save our people...
I'll find it.
take it easy on her.
don't talk.
understand?
are you okay?
Yeah.
you know, before we were caught...
you said that we needed
to put things back the way they were supposed to be.
what did you mean by that?
if we can do what Faraday said...
our plane never crashes...
flight 815 lands in los angeles.
and everyone we lost since we got here...
they'd all be alive.
and what about us?
we just...
go on living our life
because we've never met?
all the misery that we've been through...
we'd just wipe it clean. never happened.
it was not all misery.
enough of it was.
the man I shot...
what did he need the bomb for?
I need you to tell me why he wanted the bomb.
I don't think you'd believe me if I did.
when I was 17 years old,
I took a young man to the bomb.
he proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground,
then things would work out splendidly.
when I asked him how he could be so sure...
he said that he was from the future.
and then he disappeared,
right in front of my bloody eyes.
ten minutes ago,
I shot that man in the back.
and before he... died...
he told me that he...
he said he was my son.
explain to me...
and you have my word I will believe you.
how is this my handwriting if i don't remember writing it?
because you haven't written it yet.
I know this is hard to understand,
but...
what you just did...
it was an accident,
and I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.
what?
your son came back here
because he had figured out a way to change things.
he doesn't have to be dead.
you don't have to have killed him.
if we do what's written in that journal...
none of this will have happened.
does he know what he's talking about?
he thinks he does.
all right then, I'll take you to the bomb.
just...
one small issue, however.
we secured it over 20 years ago underground.
but since that time,
it appears that someone's built an entire village over it.
the dharma initiative?
however...
it appears that you two
have been passing yourselves off as members, so...
I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.
Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that.
that woman-- where is she now?
call my lawyer.
Stuart! what the hell are you doing?
I'm getting answers. where is she?!
Hey. hey! stop! damn it, stop.
that is an order. i'm still in charge here.
no, you were in charge, Horace.
but if we're gonna protect our people
and all the work we're doing here,
you don't have the stomach for what happens next.
okay, Jim, last chance.
you tell me where she is...
or so help me god, I will kill you.
you ready to talk now?
Nope.
believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim.
so why don't you tell me
where your girlfriend took the boy?
she bring him to the hostiles?
you know where they are?
stop!
please! - You want me to stop?
then tell me what I want to know!
Stuart, please.
we have known each other for three years.
we are not bad people! We are not here to hurt you!
don't.
whatever you tell 'em,
they ain't gonna believe you.
it's only gonna get more people hurt.
what are we doing, man?
beating him is pointless. Okay? He's not gonna talk.
I can make him talk.
son of a bitch!
easy. Easy.
you're a dead man, Phil.
I'm gonna kill you.
Mr. Radzinsky?
there's still no sign of Miles or Jin.
but the recruits from last week...
I got their sub's manifest from Amy.
there were three last-minute add-ons.
they were the two people that shot at you
Shephard and austen-- and one guy we can't track down.
he's gotta be a part of this.
who the hell is Hugo Reyes?
he's the fat guy.
so what's the rescue plan?
rescue plan? we're heading to the beach.
why do you think we sent you for food?
but they got Sawyer and Juliet
and there are 30 of them, and they all have guns.
the only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.
we gotta do something.
I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.
Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?
I could ask you the same question.
but we asked you first.
your friend Faraday
said that you were from the future.
I need to know if he was telling the truth.
dude, that's ridiculous.
what year were you born?
what year?
uh... 1931?
you're 46?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
so you fought in the Korean War?
there's no such thing.
who's the president of the united states?
all right, dude, we're from the future. sorry.
it's true then?
you are my son?
Yeah, it's true.
your friend--the physicist
he also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the island.
he said there was going to be a
massive accident at the Swan
now is that true?
he's been right about everything so far.
if Faraday said get people off the island...
I'd do it.
well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.
tell me something.
why is it that this man looks...
familiar to me?
you and Erik are coming with me.
going with you where?
you can untie them.
would you mind giving us a moment?
I'm taking them to the bomb.
what?
are you insane?
I'm worried about you.
not in your condition.
who is he?
the man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore.
he and Eloise are...
well, let's just say love can be complicated.
all right. let's move out.
you, uh, you ready to tell me
where you've been the last three years?
you really don't know?
well, i know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel
that you and i were sitting on a log.
there was a bright light. there was a loud noise,
and then you just... you disappeared.
well, Richard, you're just about to see where i disappeared too.
and after we're finished with that,
I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.
that's... not how it works, John.
is that true, Richard? is this gonna be a problem?
you just got back, John.
there's no reason to rush into
I am the leader now. right?
Yes, John. that's right.
good. then i would like you to take me to Jacob.
can you do that? yeah -of course.
fantastic.
let's keep moving. we're almost to the plane.
what plane?
it's a beechcraft-- used to smuggle heroin.
flew out of nigeria, crashed here.
all right, Richard, listen very carefully
because you're only gonna have about three minutes -To get this right. -Get what right?
a man's about to walk out of the jungle.
he's been shot in the leg.
you'll need this to get the bullet out.
uh, i'm sorry, John. i'm not
now just listen. this is the important part.
you're gonna need to tell him
that he has to bring everyone who left back to the island.
and when he asks how to do that...
you tell him he's gonna have to die.
who is that man, John?
me.
what is happening?
what's happening is that you're bleeding to death.
I need to get the bullet out.
how did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
because you told me there was, John.
no, no. no, i didn't.
well... you will.
this must be quite the out-of-body experience.
something like that.
your timing was impeccable, John.
how did you know when to be here?
the island told me.
didn't it ever tell you things?
no, John. and clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is,
or you wouldn't need Richard to show you you' ve never seen him
what?
Jacob. you've never seen him, have you?
what just happened?
where did you go?
to give Richard his compass back.
you want the bullet?
keep it.
everything go all right?
well, you-ou seemed pretty convinced,
especially when i said you were gonna die.
I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.
actually, Richard, it did.
we better get back to camp.
you need to evacuate the island of all nonessen
and you need to do it...
what the hell is going on here?
aren't you supposed to be at the swan right now, Chang?
we're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.
we're under imminent threat.
if we start drilling,
there's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.
we are drilling and on schedule.
Horace, you're in charge.
he's not in charge anymore.
this is my decision, and it's been made.
we keep working. -put us on the sub.
he's right. it ain't safe.
put the women and children on the sub
and get 'em the hell out of here.
and if you put me and Juliet on the sub with 'em...
we'll tell you anything you wanna know.
you okay with that, sweetheart?
Absolutely.
you want on that sub, Jim?
draw me a map.
I wanna know exactly where the hostiles are.
you two know how to swim?
why don't we just go around it?
no, dear, we need to go in.
we have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.
I'm not going.
what?
I'm gonna go back and find everyone else. i...
I can't go any further with you Jack. not this time.
Kate, you can't go back there now. they know about us.
they... they tried to kill us.
and what are you trying to do?
Bye, Jack.
you're not going anywhere.
no, you don't need to do that.
we're not in the habit of telling our secrets
to strangers, then just letting them saunter off.
you know, i don't care i just wanna leave.
look, just put the gun-- step ay!
Hey! i said stop! if she wants to leave, she can leave!
what are we doing here, eloise?
that man just killed one of our own people,
and you're acting like it doesn't matter.
if these people are right
about what they're about to do, richard, it won't matter.
and what are they about to do?
so you're telling me
you're going to erase the last three years of our lives?
we can change things, sayid. i don't know if you're
but i've already changed things.
I killed benjamin linus,
and we're all still here. it's because you didn't kill him.
sawyer and me took him to the others
so that they could save him.
why did you do that?
why did i do that?
since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs
become okay?
the three of us disappeared off that plane and
ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.
and if you're wrong, then everyone on the island dies.
do you understand that?
this is why we're here.
this is our destiny.
do you know who you sound like?
because he was crazy, too, jack. you said so yourself.
well, maybe i was wrong.
no, you were right.
I'm going back to find the rest of our people,
because if i can't stop you, then maybe they can.
the submarine departs in 30 minutes.
all evacuees, please proceed to the dock.
come now, charlotte. stay with me.
this is ridiculous. i can help you.
no, lara, you can't. just go over there.
I want you to leave now!
why is he yelling at her, dude?
it's the only way he can get her to leave.
sorry, man.
we'd better get going.
wait! whoa! whoa! wait--wait a second.
it's jim and juliet.
why the hell are they...
putting them on the sub?
don't worry. it's gonna be okay.
sawyer always has a plan, right?
we'll buy microsoft.
excuse me?
then we'll bet the cowboys in the '78 super bowl.
we're gonna be rich.
look, i'm sorry.
I should've listened to you
when you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.
I'm glad you talked me out of it.
come on, lafleur. get in.
ladies first.
good riddance.
if i don't see you the other side,
I won't blame you.
now take a deep breath and follow richard under.
there's an opening in the bottom
that was a lot further than i thought it was.
where are we?
the tunnels.
you wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?
the same way we brought it in.
I assume you don't mean through the pool.
it's a 12-foot long, 40, 000-pound hydrogen bomb.
no, not through the pool.
I didn't think you'd come.
well, if this works, you might just save us all.
and if it doesn't? at least u'll put us out of our misery.
all right. let's get started.
I'll have a tent prepared for you, john.
we'll get going first thing in the morning.
I thought we could leave right now.
now?
I'm eager.
we can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us
should go to my tent and talk about
is this everyone?
well, there's another group at the temple, but
well, if you don't mind,
I would like to talk to everyone here now.
of course. Be my guest.
Hello, everyone.
my name is John Locke.
I've been told that...
for some time,
you all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob.
and yet, oddly enough,
it seems that no one has actually seen him.
now I'm sure there are very good reasons
why his existence and where abouts are secret.
I just don't know what they are.
and to be honest with all of you,
if there's a man telling us what to do,
I want to know who he is.
this man--Jacob? Can he tell us
how to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?
Absolutely.
richard has agreed to show us where we need to go.
so I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now.
and I'd like all of you to come with me.
I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.
why do you think I tried to kill him?
we're shovin' off in two minutes.
appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.
wouldn't think of it, Nemo.
what are we gonna do en we get to Ann Arbor?
we ain't going to Ann Arbor.
what do you mean? - These guys ain't cops.
they got no authority over us back in the real world
so once we dock wherever we dock...
we're free.
real world.
I don't even know what that means anymore.
Hey, come here.
whatever happens, I got your back, remember?
I love you.
I love you back.
hold on! Don't close the hatch!
horace wants her off the island, too.
we'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.
actually caught her coming back into town.
cuff her over there with the others.
clear the bridge.
all personnel, lay below on the double.
we're away. Engineering, take your stations.
boat is clear for sea.
all men to your stations. Prepare to dive.
clear the bridge. All hands below.
stand by main vents.
diving position.
stand by on ballast tanks. - Ship has been cleared for dive.
repeat, ship has been cleared for dive. Stand by for dive.
ship to dive.
clear engines two and three. test two and three.
I'm sure it's occurred to you
that this woman's motivation
in helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb
is only to annihilate the dharma initiative.
Yes, but I still trust her. - Why?
because 30 years from now, she's the one
who's gonna tell us how to get back to the island.
and that makes you trust her?
now what?
beautiful day, isn't it?
yes... so far.
richard had some concerns.
concerns about what?
this pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable.
he's expressed...
reservations about whether or not
you know what the hell you're doing.
I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Ben.
I know we've had our differences in the past, John,
but I'm here to follow you now.
so if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, - Then I'll do whatever-- - I'm not
interested in being reunited with my people.
what do you mean? You told sun
I know what I told her,
but that's not why we're going to Jacob.
then why are we going to Jacob?
so I can kill him.
are you gonna do it?
Unh-unh. You do it.
fine. I'll do it. But you're gonna be lookout, okay?
okay.
the crops came in pretty good this year.
hey you hear? Frank bought the old...
Yeah, I hear he's gonna farm the land - All the way out to Ames road. - Yeah, I hear that, too.
two cigarettes?
there's nothing he would like less.
what you kids got there?
open your bag.
Mm-hmm. Where'd you get this?
got it over there. - I know you.
you're Diane Austen's girl. What's your name? - Katie.
well, Katie, I'm calling your mom, then the cops,
because I don't tolerate stealing here. You understand?
no need to do that.
I'll pay for it.
I hope this is enough.
well, long as somebody pays for it,
guess there's no harm done.
but I don't wanna see you in here ever again without your parents. You understand me?
Thanks, mister.
you're welcome.
you're not gonna steal anymore, are you?
be good, Katie.
welcome aboard, everyone.
we will be doing some system checks offshore here
before heading out into the open ocean
and submerging to our operational running depth.
you should be receiving your sedatives,
and then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.
have a nice rest. See you on the other side.
we have to get out of here.
out of here"?
we're underwater.
what the hell are you doing here?
how'd you get caught?
I came back to get you. - Came back go get me for what?
Where's Jack
Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.
why the hell would he do that?
does it matter? We have to stop him.
sorry, I'm gonna pass.
did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, I heard you. You just don't get it, Kate.
we we happy in dharmaville till y'all showed up.
but now that's all over.
so we're gonna drink our O.J.
and take our chances in the real world.
Jack wants to blow up the island?
good for jack.
is there anything in there about how we're supposed to move a 10-ton bomb across the island?
actually, it's 20 tons.
fortunately, it seems that Faraday
never intended to freight the device in its entirety.
what?
he left detailed instructions
on how to remove the Plutonium core...
and how to detonate it.
Faraday told me that we needed to wipe out
some kind of pocket of energy.
is only part of the bomb gonna be enough to do that?
the core itself is a thermonuclear weapon.
it'll be more than enough.
Hey! hey! Wait.
we sealed that thing up 20 years ago,
and we put it underground
because it was emitting radiation.
does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise? - Richard - You're pregnant. -Which is exactly why
we have to help him see this through
once the core is removed,
then what?
then we have approximately two hours - To take it to the swan site. - Two hours?
when Faraday returned to the island,
he was very explicit about his timetable.
well then... we'd better get movin'.
who stopped the damn drill?!
I did.
Why? - Because when we passed 70 meters,
the drill temp went up 60 degrees,
and I didn't want it to melt.
well, Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water.
so cool it down and turn it on.
Stuart, we've just evacuated the island
of all nonessential personnel.
we're in the midst of a possible insurrection.
do you really think this is the ideal time - For your experiments? - I've been working
on this project for 6 years.
designing a station that'll be able
to manipulate electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.
have you thougt about the consequence
of drilling into that pocket?!
we have no idea what we are going to
if Edison was only worried the consequences,
we'd all still be sitting in the dark.
I came to this island to change the world, Pierre.
that's exactly what I'm intend to to.
let's get it started!
thirty years later.
take five, everybody.
we still got ways to go to get to Jacob's.
who's Jacob?
he's in charge of this island.
you said John was in charge.
no, I said he was the leader
a title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary.
but everyone answers to someone,
and the leader answers to Jacob.
what's he like?
I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.
you've been staring for the last ten minutes, Richard.
is there something you would like to ask me?
Ben told me that... he strangled you.
that is my recollection, yes.
he said he was sure you were dead.
he saw your coffin loaded onto that plane that you came back on. How are you alive?
well, you've been on this island
much longer than I have, Richard.
if anyone should have an explanation,
I'd think it would be you.
I-I have been here
and I've seen things on this island
that I can barely describe.
but... I've never seen someone come back to life.
and I've never seen anyone who doesn't age.
it doesn't mean it can't happen.
I'm this way because of Jacob.
and if I had to guess,
he's the reason you're not in that coffin anymore.
I agree completely, Richard.
that's why I'm doing this-- so I can thank him.
and once I've done that, we're gonna need to deal with the rest of the passengers from the ajira flight that brought me here.
what do you mean, "deal with"? - You know what I mean.
let's go!
untie the crates.
why'd we even bring this yahoo? - Because we might need him.
for what? He didn't know the answer to the question.
that doesn't mean he's not important.
what, you think he's a candidate?
he's awake.
how long you been listening to us?
long enough to wonder what the hell I'm a candidate for.
who the hell are you people? - We're friends.
so you smack all your friends in the face with a rifle,
shove 'em in a boat and kidnap 'em?
only the ones we like.
let's go.
what's in the box?
your call.
open it.
terrific.
need a pen, son?
Yeah. thanks.
there you go.
you can keep it.
I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.
come on, Jimmy. We gotta get to the cemetery, okay?
what you writin'?
nothin'.
dear Mr.Sawyer, "you don't know who I am, but I know who you are,
and I know what you done.
listen to me, Jimmy.
I know you're angry at the man who did this to your mamand daddy.
and hell, you got every right to be.
but you gotta move on, boy.
they're gone,
and there ain't nothin' you can do to change that.
what's done is done.
now promise me you're not gonna finish that letter.
I promise.
good.
come on. Let's go say good-bye.
let me get this straight.
Jack sets off a nuke, which somehow resets everything.
so flight 815 never crashes. It just...
lands in L.A. safe and sound, and none of this ever happen.
Sawyer, if Jack does this,
he could kill everyone on the island.
Yeah, I heard that part.
and you're okay with that? - You ain't hearing me, Kate.
I made a choice, and I'm sticking to it.
I decided to leave, and I'm leavin'.
all right, here's your sedatives.
what the hell did you just do?
we decided to leave this island, James. We did.
and now we're going back.
you serious? - We can't just let those people die.
you want out?
you wanna stay here and whine about it?
unlock the damn cuffs.
Galaga" to base. The system check is complete.
we're locked on departure bearing
and ready to leave the island.
Roger that, "galaga." Have a safe trip.
see you on the return.
give me your gun.
appreciate that, captain. Now we need you to serve us all.
what? I can't take this sub... - Oh, I think you can.
once we're gone, proceed on course. Whatever you do,
do not take those people back to the island. Understand?
and what if Horace tries to contact me?
what am I supposed to say?
you ain't home.
go.
is this big enough? - That'll do.
are you done with Faraday's journal? - Take it.
can I ask you a question?
sure.
over, uh, 20 years ago,
a man named John Locke...
he walked right into our camp,
and he told me that he was gonna be our leader.
now I've gone off the island three times since then
to visit him.
but he never seemed, uh, particularly special to me.
you said you had a question.
you know him? Locke?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know him.
and if I were you, I wouldn't give up on him.
why haven't you told him yet?
told who what?
Richard. Why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?
if by "plans" you mean murdering him, John,
I assume you'd want to keep that a secret.
when did that ever stop you?
well, I started thinking differently about things when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me if i did'n t do everything you said.
whoa. W-w-wait. Wait.
where did this happen?
in that cavern beneath the temple,
when we went to see the monster.
so...
you're willing to do whatever I say
no matter what it is?
Yes.
well, then...
I guess I won't have to convince you after all.
convince me to do what?
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.
you are.
Paris or Rome? - No.
Florence? - It doesn't matter, Sayid...
Yes, it does. - As long as we're together.
it's our anniversary. We have to find the perfect place.
I would settle finding my sun glasses
excuse me, sir? Could you you help me?
I'm sorry. I think I'm lost. Are you from Los Angeles?
what are you looking for? - I found them.
take me home.
take me home.
time is short. Let's go.
mm, stand back.
it's one of the dharma houses.
I'll go first.
Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here.
I'll go first.
because if someone at that house is a threat,
you might hesitate... but I won't.
all right. Oy, Eloise, go on. After you.
once we give you the "all clear,
then you bring the bomb.
we don't want any acci...oh!
what the hell are you doing?
I'm protecting our leader. Get back.
she's gonna be angry when she wakes up,
but that's a lot better than being dead.
she ordered me to help you. We helped you.
now you're on your own.
and I'm taking her out the way we came in.
after you.
all residents, we are in a code black.
report with your weapons
to your security assignments immediately.
if you come into contact with a hostile,
you are authorized to use deadly force.
how the hell are we gonna get out of here?
go! we don't have time!
we hide in plain sight.
set up a perimeter around the barracks first.
you gonna go over there by the gate. You get two...
so you guys go. You go to pylons.
we're gathering over there.
you're the son of a bitch who shot my kid.
don't fire that weapon.
I'm carrying a nuclear device.
it's the hostile!
Hey! let's go!
get in!
drive!
from the looks of the sun,
I'd say that's the north shore over there.
sun's over there. That's gotta be the west coast.
Really? what, you got a compass? -No. Do you?
thank you.
for what?
for backing me up at the sub.
no problem.
I got no idea where the hell we are.
Vincent! Come here! Hey!
how you doing, boy?
I haven't seen you since the flaming arrows three years ago. Hi!
how you doing? How did he survive alone out here?
Oh, hell, no.
they found us.
son of a bitch.
is that a bomb?!
try not to move. I need to stop the bleeding.
what's going on back there? Is Sayid okay?- Yes, he looks ok.
just keep your eyes on the damn road!
should I pull over? Yeah, - Let's pull over and get shot. Just move.
I don't know where we're going.
the swan site. Head the swan.
why do you want to go there? if Sayid's shot, shouldn't we...
hurley, if you want to save Sayid, - Take us to the swan．- If you want it is.
Jack, what's at the swan? I think I found a way to get you back to your wife.
so hold on. You're telling me
you've just been living out here in the jungle
for the past three years, by yourselves? Uh-huh.
well, I'm sorry y'all got left behind.
didn't you hear me shout out, "meet at the creek"?
you mean with flaming arrows raining down around us,
killing everyone we knew? Oh, sure, we heard ya.
well, we spent all sorts of time looking for ya.
I had Jin out searching the island grid by grid.
Ah, we know.
you know?
Oh, sure, you guys all joined up with the dharma initiative.
well, damn, I could've brought both y'all in.
why didn't you find a way to tell us you are out here.
were out here? Beca
so y'all been scavenging food
and living out in a hut by yourselves.
people try the whole life
to get themselves a nice, quiet place near the ocean where they can live in peace. And we did it.
that's what we made for ourselves.
well, I hate to rain on your parade, but...
your condo's about to go ka-blooey.
Jack has a bomb.
who cares?
excuse me?
it's always something with you people.
now you say jack's got a bomb.
and what, you guys are all gonna try to stop him, right?
Yeah, that's right.
we traveled back 30 years in time,
and you're still trying to find ways to shoot each other?
rose, we just need to know
which way the dharma barracks are from here
so we can stop jack,
or you're gonna be dead.
we all will.
so we die.
we just care about being together.
that's all that matters in the end.
the barracks are 5 miles that way.
thank you.
let's go. Bye.
you sure don't want some tea?
maybe another time.
I wish you'd never showed me what was in this damn box.
what the hell you gonna do with it anyway?
we need to show it to somebody.
what for?
so they'll know what they're up against.
what exactly are they up against?
something a hell than what's in this box, Frank.
don't worry, though. As long as you're with us, you're fine.
that's be reassuring if i knew who you were, "friend.
we are the good guys.
in my experience, the people who go out of their way
to tell you that the good guys are the bad guys.
we're here.
look at the ash!
wait here.
can you do that?
will you help me, Ilana?
Yes.
what happened?
he isn't there, hasn't been in a long time.
someone else has been using it.
burn it!
I'm no tree hugger or anything,
but that's a pretty good way to torch the whole jungle,
don't you think?
so what now?
well, I guess we know where we're going.
Oh! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Call 9-1-1!
is he all right? I don't know!
don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry this happened to you.
this is our old camp.
home sweet home.
all right, everyone, Richard tells me
we should get to where we're going by nightfall.
so why don't you all take this opportunity
to rest up and catch your breath?
considering what I have planned for ya, you're
everything all right?
I was enjoying some alone time.
you see what's behind you?
it's a door. How about that?
it's not just a door, Ben.
it's the door to the hatch where you and I first met.
you mind if I ask you a question?
I'm a pisces.
what happened that day at the cabin,
when you first took me to meet jacob?
well, you clearly already know
that I was talking to an empty chair, John...
that I was pretending.
which is not to say that I wasn't as surprised as you were when things started flying around in the room.
but why would you go to all the trouble
to make something like that up?
I was embarrassed.
I didn't want you to know that I had never seen Jacob.
so, yes, I lied.
that's what I do.
all right, then.
why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?
because...
despite your loyal service to this island,
you got cancer...
you had to watch your own daughter gunned down right in front of you.
and your reward for those sacrifices?
you were banished.
and you did all this in the name of a man you'd never even met.
so the question is, Ben,
why the hell wouldn't you wanna kill Jacob?
how much further?
uh, we're about five minutes away.
you can't stop the bleeding.
I need fresh dressings.
Jack, so this bomb is supposed
to what, blow us back in time?
we're not going back in time.
right, because that would be ridiculous.
I need to modify the bomb.
I can rig it so it detonates on impact.
Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the incident.
or all of this will be for nothing.
why the hell are we stopping?
that's why.
what is it?
why are we stopping?
you'll see.
well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard, - But what does it have to do with Jacob? - It's where he lives.
what's going on, kate?
doc, we gotta talk.
you wanna talk? Then get in the van. We don't - Have time - I ain't get in the van.
I need five minutes, that's all.
I'll say what I gotta say,
and then you can do whatever the hell you want to.
but you're gonna listen. You owe me that much, Jack.
five minutes.
Dr. Shephard? You all right?
the dural sac...I cut it.
give me some suction. - Calm down. It's all right.
the fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't - Look at me.
give me some suction. - Yes, doctor.
Jack... look at me.
count to five. - What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you stitching up the sac
so this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life.
and the only way you're gonna do that is not to be afraid.
so close your eyes, count to five,
and then fix her, Jack.
or I'll have to fix her for you.
one...
two...
three...
four...
five.
sutures.
Hey, kiddo. Girl's in recovery.
she's responsive to stimulus below the waist,
so... no paralysis.
good.
something wrong, Jack?
you embarrassed me.
did I?
you know, it's bad enough that everybody in this hospital thinks the only reason I got this residency is because you're my father. But then you...
you put me in a time-out during my first major procedure,
in front of my entire team.
dad, I know you don't believe in me,
but I need them to.
are you sure I'm the one
who doesn't believe in you, Jack?
one of these yours?
machine got stuck.
I guess it just needed a little push.
take a load off, doc.
no, thanks.
sit down, Jack.
my folks died when I was 8 years old.
I ever tell you that?
no.
con man took my dad for everything he had.
he didn't handle it too well, so...
he shot my mom, then he blew his own head off.
I was hiding under the bed when it happened.
I heard the whole thing.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
that was a year ago.
what?
right now it's July 1977,
which means that happened last year.
so I could've hopped on the sub,
gone back to the states,
walked right in my house
and stopped my daddy from killing anybody.
why didn't you?
because, Jack...
what's done is done.
it doesn't have to be that way.
what did you screw up so bad the first time around
you're willing to blow up a damn nuke - Just for a second chance? - That's not what this is about.
then what is it about?
three years ago,
locke told me that all this was happening for a reason,
that us being here was our destiny.
I don't speak "destiny.
what I do understand is a man does what he does 'cause he wants something for himself.
what do you want, Jack?
I had her.
I had her, and I lost her.
well, damn, doc,
she's standing right on the other side of those trees.
you want her back, just go and ask her.
Nah, it's too late for that.
your five minutes is up.
if what you're doin' even works,
you and kate will be strangers,
and she'll be in damn handcuffs.
if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
well, I guess there's nothing I can say - That's gonna change your mind. - No, I guess there's not.
who the hell do you think you are?!
you think you can come here
and do whatever the hell you want?
I had a life here!
will you stop?
will you stop?! - No.
Aah!
let him go.
he wouldn't listen. I had to. He won't stop!
that's because he's right.
What?!
he's right, James.
we have to do this.
what are you talking about?!
you're the one that told me to come back here and stop him!
what happened?!
I changed my mind.
girls... your dad and I have something
we need to talk to you both about.
are we moving again?
no, stupid. They're getting a divorce.
Rachel... - well, aren't you?
Yes. - But...
we need you both to understand
that your father and I...
we still love each other.
just because two people love each other,
doesn't always mean they're supposed to be together.
but what if you are supposed to be together?
we're not, honey.
but how can you know for sure? - We just know.
and when you're a grown-up,
you'll understand.
I don't wanna understand!
Juliet, wait!
I don't wanna understand!
stop! We gotta talk about this!
there's nothing to talk about, James.
we have to let Jack do what he came here to do.
well, maybe you should told me you had a change of heart before I brought him out in the jungle to kick his ass.
would that soft you?
no. - Well, then I'm glad you finally
got it out of your systerm.
Hey! hey! - You, don't.
I need you to tell me where all this is coming from.
I mean, one minute, you're leading the great sub escape,
and now you're on board with blowing up the damn island?
I got a right to know why you changed your mind.
I changed my mind when I saw you look at her.
don't. don't.
I don't care who I looked at.
I'm with you.
and you would stay with me forever if I let you,
and that is why I will always love you.
you don't... what we had, it was just for a little while.
and just because we love each other,
it doesn't mean that we're meant to be together.
I mean, maybe we were never supposed to be together.
so if Jack can make it that...
that none of you ever come here
then he should.
why you doing this, Juliet?
I...
if I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.
what is it now?!
the gauss readings has jumped off the charts.
let me see.
this is it! We're on top of the pocket!
if we keep drilling and hit that pocket,
all hell is gonna break loose!
radzinsky, are y - Stuart, come in! - What do you want, Phil?
that hostile that shot the kid? He came back.
what the hell are you talking about?
here at the barracks. He...he attacked us
and then got rescued by some of the other recruits.
they stole a van and took off. - Took off where?
I don't know,
but Roger said that one of them had a bomb.
that hostile knows about the swan!
get some men and some guns,
and get your asses out here right now!
if they're coming here, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
come on!
Jack? What happened?
Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.
does it hurt?
Ah, it's okay. - Okay.
do you remember when I sewed you up? when we first got here?
Yeah.
seems like a million years ago.
or 30 years from now.
Kate, why'd you make me promise to never ask about Aaron?
because I was...
so angry with you for making me come back here.
is he why you came back?
I came back so he could be where he belongs...
with his mother.
if this works, Claire will never come to the land,
and they'll always be together,
just the way they're meant to be.
she was gonna give him up for
well, you don't know what she would do.
and whatever it is, it would be her choice.
if you wanna save Claire, this is the only way to do it.
nothing... nothing in my life has ever felt so right.
and...
I just need you to believe that.
go!
keep going!
keep the drill going!
it's about to happen.
are you with me on this?
Yes.
then let's go.
one wallet.
$227 cash.
one ballpoint pen.
one fruit roll-up.
sign here.
you don't understand. This is a big mistake.
I killed a bunch of people.
you see this?
this is a discharge form. You've been cleared.
so take your stuff and go. - Look, dude...
there are men with tranquilizer guns
hunting me down like an animal.
they wanna bring me somewhere against my will.
there's a cab stand right out front.
Oh. Sorry. I didn't see it was taken, dude.
actually, I'm only going a few blocks
if you wanna share.
come on in.
you want some?
cherry.
no thanks.
so what were you in for?
excuse me?
jail.
I was there 'cause i killed three people.
but I didn't really. I guess they figured it out.
what about you?
I wasn't in jail.
well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison?
in a cab?
I was waitin' for you, Hugo.
then you must be dead.
I'm definitely not dead.
well, what do you want from me?
I wanna know why you won't go back to the island.
cause I'm cursed.
is that so?
that's why the plane crashed, my friends died...
now they visit me,
and I can't make it stop.
well, what if you weren't cursed?
what if you were blessed?
how do you mean "blessed?
well, you get to talk to people you've lost...
seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.
Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful,
except for the part where i'm crazy.
I've got some news for you, Hugo,
and you're just gonna have to take my word on this.
you are not crazy.
who are you, dude?
I'm just up here on the corner.
ajira airways flight 316 out of l.a.x.
leaves in 24 hours.
all you have to do is get on that plane.
it's your choice, Hugo.
you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
wait! you forgot your guitar.
it's not my guitar.
don't worry, dude.
everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future...
or the past.
one of those.
I don't think your bud's gonna make it.
he'll make it.
dude, what happened to your face?
nothin'.
we were just up on a ridge
where we could look down into the swan site.
something just happened down there.
they hit something. it's time for me to go.
it's all set to go.
remember, be careful.
it's rigged to explode on impact.
according to Faraday's plan,
you must get the bomb as close as you can to the source of electromagnetism.
sayid, this is gonna work.
and it'll save ya.
nothing can save me.
see ya in los angeles.
are you sure you need to do this?
if you waited, Jacob would eventually come to you, John.
I'm tired of waiting. Where is he, Richard?
what happened to the rest of the statue?
I don't know. It was like that when I got here.
do you expect me to believe that?
not really.
all right, Ben, let's go.
W-what are you doing?
John wants me to join him.
you can't bring him in. - Why not?
because only our leader can request an audience with Jacob,
and there can only be one leader on the island at a time.
John. I'm
you just make these rules up as you go along, Richard.
Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a problem,
I'm sure Jacob and I can work it out.
tell him i said hello.
will you be able to do this, Ben?
I know it won't be easy,
but things will change... once he's gone.
I promise.
can I ask you something, Lafleur?
there ain't no more Lafleur, Enos. go ahead, shoot.
has it occurred to any of you that your buddy's
actually gonna cause the thing
he says he's trying to prevent
perhaps that little nuke is the incident?
so maybe the best thing to do...
is nothing?
I'm glad you all thought this through.
what's going on?
it's Phil.
that's the road to the swan.
if they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.
what do you think, Blondie?
live together, die alone.
good for you. You got here fast. - Any sign of 'em yet?
no, not yet. You got time to set up a perimeter.
you called these men to reset
you, rear ridgeline. You, top ridgeline.
we need to be getting your people away from here.
you, top of the scaffolding. Go now!
there!
get him!
flank him! Get him now!
who's this?!
drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man! - Okay, okay.
tell 'em to put their guns down.
drop the guns!
all right, you can come out now, Doc!
hurry up and do your business.
turn that damn thing off!
what's the matter?!
it won't shut down!
why not?!
something's pulling the drill down.
we hit the pocket!
hurry up, Doc! What are you waiting for?! Drop it!
this don't look like L.A.X
dad!
dad!
get away from here! Get as far away from here as you can!
get in!
what the hell's going on?! Get out of here!
come on!
go! go! go!
help!
help!
come on!
Sawyer! help! Juliet!
where do you think you're going, blondie?
Kate! help me get those chains off!
hold on! you hold on!
I can't. I can't get it off.
I got you. I can't...
Juliet! no!
I can't reach her. You hold on!
I got you.
don't you leave me.
it's okay.
don't you leave me!
I love you. No, you don't let go!
I love you, James. Don't let go.
I love you so much. no!
no, don't let go!
No!
water?
do you have any alcohol?
no. Sure wish I did.
don't shoot.
it's okay.
it's all right.
which one of you is Ricardus?
it's Richard, actually.
what lies in the shadow of the statue?
I'm Ilana.
I have something you need to see.
open it up.
it...it's okay. It's okay. Let them.
where did you find him?
in the cargo hold of the plane we came here on...
in a coffin.
I don't understand.
if this is locke...
who set in there?
you like it?
I did it myself.
it takes a very long time when you're making the thread,
but, uh...
I suppose that's the point, isn't it?
Hello, Jacob.
well, you found your loophole.
indeed I did.
and you have no idea
what I've gone through
to be here.
have you met before?
in a manner of speaking.
do what I asked you to, Ben.
whatever he's told you,
I want you to understand one thing.
you have a choice.
what "choice"?
you can do what he asked,
or you can go,
leave us to discuss our...
issues.
Oh... so now, after all this time,
you've decided to stop ignoring me.
35 years I lived on this island,
and all I ever heard was your name
over and over.
richard would bring me your instructions...
all those slips of paper,
all those lists...
and I never questioned anything.
I did as I was told.
but when I dared to ask to see you myself,
I was told, "you have to wait.
you have to be patient.
but when he asked to see you?
he gets marched straight up here as if was moses.
so... why him?
what was it that was so wrong with me?
what about me?!
what about you?
they're coming.
what?
I can't hear you.
they're coming.
Sawyer, get off of there!
we have to go right now. We need to go!
get off.
it's going down! This thing is gonna go! you ha
you have to go. This thing is going to blow at any second
Jack! help me get him off.
come on!
you son of a bitch!
you did this.
pick him up. Get him to the spring.
the water isn't clear. What happened?
you're not saving him! You're drowning him!
your friend is dead.
what happened?
he's alive.
it worked?
dude, you're okay!
hurley, let him breathe.
miles, can you go get some water?
Yeah, on it.
how are you feeling?
a little light-headed.
Jack... What happened to me?
you died.
how is that even possible?
I mean... One minute he's gone, and now he's fine?
of course he's fine. - What does that mean?
he's an iraqi torturer who shoots kids.
he's definitely deserves another go-around.
what are you looking at?
how many guys with guns you think are outside this place?
what?
I was out cold when they brought me in here.
how many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking about running, kate.
she's got hands in handcuffs, But she's probably got 'em covered, okay?
Hey, watch it.
go!
go now!
lady, I already have a customer.
damn it, I said go!
okay.
easy, easy. Slow down.
Hey, just slow down. Slow down!
okay! Okay! You said go!
just get us out of here.
stop the cab!
can you please just let me out of--aah!
be quiet!
what are you doing? Move!
there's a guy. I'm not gonna run him over.
Hey. I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!
do not get out of this car.
just go.
go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!
what the hell?!
Hey, I got your license plate!
at the light, take a left.
can you--can you please, please just let me go?
I promise I won't say anything to anyone.
