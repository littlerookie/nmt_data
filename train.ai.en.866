I get it.
well, I was gonna say relax, but oddly enough you seem pretty relaxed already.
you're accomplished, you're funny.
you can have whatever you want--women are gonna
he's not cheating with another woman.
he's cheating with another food group.
what?
his floaters float because they're full of fat.
probably had a big cheese burger for lunch.
you're eating flesh? - It's just a hamburger.
not all the time. - You're disgusting!
the soy cakes taste like cardboard.
unsalted cardboard.
I'm accomplished.
I'm funny.
can I... have whatever I want?
can we wait a second?
what's wrong? - I feel good.
do you really need to put that needle
you felt good yesterday, and then you almost suffocated.
and you know that that thing is in my eye?
we think it could be.
if we find it, our hope is that we can treat it.
you hope? - Mom. Don't hang on every word.
he said he hopes. That means he doesn't know.
I just want to understand what's going on.
we won't know anything until we do the test.
Addie, this all looks really scary, but you'll feel nothing. Okay?
okay.
you rang?
you called me.
I bought you an espresso.
you've been buying me coffee for a couple of weeks, I thought I'd pay you back with one.
how did you walk with the cane and the two coffees?
why are you suspicious?
because it's either that or accept the fact that you've done something nice.
and then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.
you think I spat in yours?
or worse.
I stacked them.
what do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist?
they sound almost the same.
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.
don't cheapen this.
we had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats.
I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.
you asked for a date while your finger was in her boyfriend?
got her number.
no, no. No way.
this is an employment application.
she doesn't want to go out with you, she's looking for a job.
Oh, god, she's 26.
with the wisdom of a much younger woman.
have you spoken to Foreman?
several times. We laugh
you're gonna lose him.
and that will be depressing...
and will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have.
macular biopsy was negative, which means you're wrong.
there's no complement factor H deficiency.
the most likely cause of altering blood flow in the brain is a clot or a tumor.
we can rule out a clotting issue because she has a bleeding issue.
which means we should be looking for a tumor.
I think there's an infection.
just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet, doesn't mean they're working.
so why did we do the test?
because if it had been positive, it would have proved I was right.
but negative doesn't prove you wrong.
that's the beauty of the test.
she needs an MRI of her brain.
Absolutely.
as long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess, or something caused by an infection?
I didn't expect House to beg me to stay, but it seems like he's in a better mood since I quit.
nothing in the axial view.
you haven't asked me why I'm leaving.
I figured you'd tell me when you wanted to.
I don't want to be like him.
you're not a jerk.
thank you.
I mean, sometimes you are.
but I don't think we can pin that on House.
and you're a better doctor than when you came through the door.
I'm better at some things, worse at others.
again, not House's fault. It's a job.
you're supposed to take the good, and leave the bad.
it's easier for you.
why, because you think I need to toughen up?
you think I'm weak?
Yeah.
see, I am a jerk. I've gotta get out of here.
what's wrong, Addie?
my head hurts!
brain's clean. No tumor and no abscess.
we're all wrong.
my head!
my head!
Grody!
looks like massive tissue death.
who cares-her head blew up. How cool is that.
it's not pussy meaning you don't think it's an infection.
and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong.
here we go again.
she's got infections that come and go, which means...
it means it has to be something else.
good guess, but no.
it means either she's got a leprechaun in her colon, which is playing with the doggy door, letting bacteria in and out.
or she's got complement factor H deficiency.
are you enjoying this?
I'm saving a woman's life!
I'm saving a woman's life!
actually, I'm diagnosing her.
technically I'm diagnosing her with something that's gonna kill her, but other than that I am saving her life.
an autoimmune problem makes more sense.
you can't explain a transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis.
you'd need three white boards and 100 different-colored markers.
no, it's much more likely she has an invisible protein that allowed bacteria to arbitrarily invade her lungs, then arbitrarily invade her pleura, then arbitrarily jump into her head.
if it's autoimmune, she can live.
but we have to give her steroids now, before her heart ruptures.
if you're wrong and you give her steroids, she dies now.
Foreman, you want a rundown on how it feels to go with your gut and kill a person?
we can get into the whole spiring out of control, self-doubt, resigning thing.
do it.
the worst that can happen is you quit.
cameron, want to explain to the parents why you'll be holding paddles while he's doing it?
because if her heart goes boom, it'll boom right away.
she really has to be awake for this?
if there's a problem, she can tell us what she feels.
relax.
we're scared.
I don't want you to be scared.
then get better.
okay, sweetie?
we love you.
I'm sorry.
ready?
ready.
my patient's about to have a heart attack.
it's gonna be massive.
Oh, well, that's too bad Because I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor.
have you had a conversation with Foreman?
do me a favor.
you haven't... because then you would have to confront your own emotions.
is bile an emotion?
because I could definitely feel something here.
get me some licorice.
this is gonna be the best heart attack of all time.
Oh, it, wait, wait.
she's gonna shock her.
there's always tomorrow.
you wanted to see me?
pretty sure the label is straight.
are you really gonna leave?
where are you going? You lined up interviews yet?
I'm not sure.
you're pissed at House - I get it. You're symbolicating killing him.
Symbolicating? What?
Symbolic-a-lating-gosh, that's a hard word.
are you okay?
Hey, I'm not the one sym - I'm not the one symb.
I'm not the one pretending to kill someone. What would it take for you to stay? Is it money?
he wants you to stay. - He said that?
if I said he said that, would that make a difference?
are you sure you're okay? - Hello?
Ugh, I'm leaving now.
I'm late for a breast thing. You know he wants you.
you know he's good; you know he can make you good.
I don't know what I'm saying. You don't - I don't
you know what I'm saying and you know I'm right. I gotta go.
sorry it took me so long to get down here.
I'm Dr. Wilson. I guess Dr. Stein's gone. Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to him when we're done.
Dr. Stein said they're probably calcium deposits.
well, with your medical history you don't want to take any chances.
I can't seem to put on my gloves today. It's weird.
okay, well... that's fine. One's enough. Well, let's have a look.
you sure talk fast.
this is nothing. You should see me when we're busy.
I just winked at you. I just - I've never winked at a patient in my life.
I have no - I am so sorry. I have no idea what I was thinking.
it's okay.
no, it's not. I was hitting on you. I wasn't consciously hitting on you, but what else could you think?
that you were being reassuring?
Yeah, that would make sense. On the other hand, I feel like my heart's gonna explode.
are you okay?
I feel a little sweaty. Am I sweating?
Yeah.
is something wrong?
I can't - I can't.
I put on gloves to do a breast exam - perfect. Sorry.
it's 185.
excuse me, I have to go kill someone.
you dosed me!
Yes, I did.
but only because you didn't trust me, your best friend.
you could have killed me!
amphetamines aren't gonna kill you.
you don't know my medical history. I - I could have.
you could have given me a heart attack.
a heart attack is not gonna kill you. You were in a hospital.
a- ha! You yawned.
a- ha...
you tried to kill me.
I put you on uppers, and you still yawned.
means it's a symptom of being a big, fat liar.
yawning is a side effect of some anti-depressants
apparently the ones you're on.
I'm not on anti-depressants; I'm on speed.
that means it's a symptom of cerebral tumor. You got six weeks to live.
Mr. Well - adjusted is as messed up as the rest of us.
why would you keep that a secret? Are you ashamed of recognizing how pathetic your life is?
it's not a secret, House! It's-it's
it's personal!
how long has it been personal?
it's personal!
Yawning's recent, so either you just started or you changed prescriptions.
this is why I take them.
they're anti-depressants. Not anti-annoyance-ants.
you'd think this would naturally come up in conversation.
Oh, don't act hurt. You don't care.
on one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.
you wouldn't take them.
you'd rather od on vicodin or stick electrodes in your head because you could say you did it to get high.
the only reason to take anti-depressants is because you're depressed.
you have to admit that you're depressed.
gimme.
are you gonna admit that - nope.
I'm gonna prove that I'm not depressed.
well, I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.
you need a whole work-up.
give me a vicodin so I don't stroke.
I... wouldn't drink that.
my leg hurt, and I...
why didn't you pick up the phone? We've been calling.
I was sleeping.
what did you do?
nothing.
this is how regular people look when you wake them up.
chase was wrong.
addie's kidneys shut down.
hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys.
peripheral smear of red cells had schistocytes.
huh.
hus is usually caused by an infection or a protein deficiency.
what a coincidence.
I know a patient with an infection and a protein deficiency.
you think it's possible there's a connection?
I want to hear you say it, Chase. It will please me.
doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest- instant cardiac arrest.
there were only two choices.
since yours was wrong, mine must've been right.
either that or we missed the leprechaun.
if you're right, there's nothing to be done.
the steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits, it'll hit hard.
liver failure, cardiac arrest
on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis.
don't you see how incredible this call was?
a protein deficiency.
can't be tested, can't be seen.
I called it based on coughing blood.
you're happy about this.
she's going to die.
that's not my fault.
she's gonna die anyway.
but now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why.
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude in her eyes when you tell her.
I'm not telling her.
no one's telling her. Not 'til we're sure I'm right.
but we're gonna wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her.
seems like the humane approach.
her heart went into v-fib.
brought her back. Barely.
Congratulations. You have your confirmation.
what's her name?
who? The co-ed? - Sure.
dead sophomore girl?
you know her father's name? - Dad. Her mother's name is mommy.
Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.
you think they're gonna give a crap if I know their names?
five years from now when the father's looking at photographs of his daughter graduating from high school they're not gonna remember the nice black doctor who called them by their first name.
you don't wanna quit.
you saying you don't want me to quit? - Didn't sound like I said that.
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass.
because you know who you are.
and you figure if you can make me decent and caring, then maybe there's a hope for you
you are about to tell a girl she's dying. And you think it's about you.
God, I hope I'm not you.
I'm sorry.
Addie, you're dying.
are you sure? - Yes.
your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.
how long? - Two days...Maybe less.
you have a condition called- - it doesn't matter.
it's, um, a very rare protein deficiency- -I don't want to hear it.
okay.
it's what's killing you. This is what's killing you.
you're not interested in what's killing you?
will that make any difference? Will I live any longer?
please, could you just leave?
what's the point of living without curiosity? Without craving the
so I'm screwing up my last few hours because I won't listen to you?
get out of here. - It's--it's--it's like the...
dark matter in the universe. - You're smiling.
no, I'm not.
you can only diagnose a problem by looking at what's --missing.
Oh, god. I have to go.
nineteen-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's gonna die.
begged me to shut up.
if you can't shut up, at least talk quietly.
amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.
you were happy. - No, I was hazy.
I don't get hazy on vicodin or anything else I throw down.
which means I was throwing down something I didn't know I was throwing down.
which got me to wondering... Why didn't you give me those happy pills?
I told you; you gotta be checked out- -no, you just didn't want me double dosing.
you dosed me! Those coffees
they worked. You've been smiling. Relaxed...Happy.
a dying girl thought I was happy.
a moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
house was happy. - Hazy.
happy. - Hazy!
Oh, right, a dying girl mistook hazy for happy.
because dying people see happiness everywhere.
she's miserable. - She wasn't miserable.
of course she was miserable.
you just told her she- - she's no different than she'd ever been.
she's no different than she'd ever been.
Oh, god. I gotta go.
I need a minute with your daughter.
Dr. House, get out of here before- - she's gonna live.
does that help? Now get out.
are you jerking us around? - Get out!
You...Have got leprechauns in ya.
depression manifests in lots of different ways.
some people can't get out of bed all day.
others have serial relationships and become oncologists.
I'm dying; I'm not depressed. - Wrong and wrong.
you tried to kill yourself by throwing down kitchen cleanser.
now, most normal suicidal morons would've just drank the stuff.
burn the hell out of their mouth and throat. Painful, but not deadly.
but being a college-educated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum which left no trace.
it burned a hole in your intestine.
but the body can repair almost anything... Which is cool.
in your case, scar tissue closed up the hole.
but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery.
now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away.
but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery where they got a free ride everywhere.
can you fix me?
surgery can fix the bridge. Take about two hours.
Psychotherapy's gonna take you a little longer.
why'd you do it?
I don't know.
I just...have never been happy.
please don't tell my parents.
they'll blame themselves, and it's not their fault.
please, you can't tell them.
technically, all you have to do is promise me that you won't do it again.
then legally, I can't tell them.
I promise.
Yeah. Sure.
we can't thank you enough- - your daughter tried to kill herself.
that's why she's here.
legally, I'm supposed to keep that between me and her.
which makes sense. She's obviously an adult.
capable of her own well-reasoned decisions.
you're sure?
if she doesn't die in the next couple of hours... Yeah, I'm right.
how could she hide this?
everyone has secrets.
we'll take care of her. Figure it out.
make her happy? - Get her into therapy.
might want to try some meds too.
can we call you? If we have any questions.
no.
Sup? - Nothing.
you wanted to see me? - Yeah.
house's patient.
Yeah, the one that would have died if not for him.
subtle. - Thanks.
you're really scared you'll turn into him.
don't tell me I'm better than him. Don't tell me take the good, leave the bad.
cameron already tried.
I'm telling you there are worse things to turn into.
it's not worth it.
I didn't think you were gonna show. - Sorry.
surgery went a little late.
so you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What do you got there?
peppermint tea.
I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea, please.
this isn't a job interview, is it?
it's some kind of interview.
you're judging me, I'm judging you.
you have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.
I'm on anti-depressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable.
I don't like them. They make me hazy. I eat meat. I like drugs.
and I'm not always faithful to the women I date.
you don't seem depressed.
you do realize you just skipped over several deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from.
you told the truth. - Yeah.
I don't always do that either.
well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around, and doing drugs?
were you on the debating team in high school?
Also...I hate...Tea.
I said I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling too hot
you're sneezing. You can do that in a movie theatre.
it'll be a nice soft chair when I collapsed. I'm babe oh, come on! We're gonna be late!
episode four never comes to the big screen.
this is the pre-lucas-ized version, remember?
none of that greedo shooting first crap.
go without me
what are you talking about? You love Star Wars
don't you
since when?
since just before I pretending I loved it
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to be supportive.
fine. I'll go alone.
baby I'm sorry.
me too. I'm so woozy. I can hardly think.
we're hanging at home
you should go
did you just feel something?
feel? Like what?
is there earthquake?
in New Jersey?
Oh god -What?
I think I'm like hallucinating.
call 911
two surgeries for multiple fractures and burns.
I'm thinking the broken bones are a response to the building falling on her head.
and the fever?
she's the only collapse victim whose body temperature
put her on antipyrectics.
already have. The fever is holding at 104.
fluctuating consciousness.
I can't take the case. I don't have a team.
so hire a team. - What for? I don't have a case.
have you even interviewed anybody?
you test drive a car before you buy it.
you have sex before you get married, I can't hire a team based on a ten-minute interview.
what if I don't like having sex with them?
you've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing.
concert is over.
in what twisted universe does mastering eddie Van Halen's two-handed arpeggio technique count as absolutely nothing?
take the case or you will spend the next month helping the collapse team change bandages.
I diagnose her. Alone.
by the end of the day, you go away for a week.
done.
it's not gonna work.
if he solves the case, we cure the girl.
and prove he doesn't need a team.
he's not gonna solve the case. Not that fast.
why not. - Because he needs a team!
and this'll prove to him- - you wanna change his mind about something, you need a more convincing argument than you promised.
fever.
non-responsive to antibiotics and antipyretics.
fluctuating consciousness.
go!
you talking to me?
Yes.
imagine that the roof of the storage closet collapses on your favorite floor buffer.
which then starts overheating.
why would I have a favorite floor buffer?
okay.
maybe the electrical works got banged up in there from stuff falling on it.
hmm, interesting.
brain damage leading to hypothalamic dysregulation.
Nah.
if you're brought in covered in rubble, it's all about the mri'S.
we'd have seen that. Come on!
you gotta earn that fiver.
or stuff leaked in the holes, messing it up.
lacerations leave multiple portals for infection.
bacterial would have responded to the antibiotics.
too high for viral.
parasites or fungus is possible.
or maybe lupus.
my grandma has lupus.
okay, autoimmune. I'll run a lupus panel.
infection fits best.
complete history would be helpful.
which leads to the worst part of the job.
dealing with the floor buffer's family.
we talked every couple of weeks, but Ben would know better than I
no farms, no travel anywhere weird.
you get that, dr. Buffer?
no travel, no farm.
the file says she was sick before the building collapsed.
I figured it was just a cold.
why, do you think's related?
her being sick and her being sick?
often is.
she was unconscious when I found her.
we'd been fighting.
I just want to.
just tell me she's gonna be okay.
I'm not even sure you're gonna be okay.
we're gonna make her all better.
showoff.
you oughta be nicer to people.
where are we going?
you know how the laughter of little children is infectious?
well, parasites and fungi are even more so.
we're gonna find out which one is making her brain bubble over.
where, the building?
epa's doing that job for us. They say it's clean.
which means we're making a pilgrimage to castle blackberry.
her name's Bradbury.
I should ask them for keys. - No need.
I'm sure we can find a large rock somewhere.
I'm not breaking in to somebody's house.
I got principles.
I got some loose change here says you don't.
I'm not doing this.
for less than a 50.
Where's the restaurant?
what restaurant?
the one you said you were taking me to for lunch.
Oh, uh, this one's homier.
dibs on the cold pizza.
I'm sure it looked easier on youtube.
Yeah, you don't need a team.
you can't even get arrested without company.
you're right. Only one solution.
never replace them. Ever.
do you need help?
Yeah, yeah, patronize the poor cripple.
let me get that. - I got it.
will you--let me just let me get it.
I'll check the bedroom.
some interesting mold on the windowsill here!
it's gonna take me a while.
I'll cover the bathroom.
she had a secret diary.
is there any other kind?
what are you doing?
there's a sale on liquid tide.
if you're broke, I can lend you a tiny bit of the money I owe you.
no, no, I wouldn't put you in that position.
what does the diary say?
it's basically a list of her sexual encounters.
boys, girls, vibrating appliances.
if it was, you'd be quoting, not summarizing.
this is a parade of sad banalities.
I can hardly get out of bed.
feeling blue.
then, three months ago, turns into a parade of happy banalities.
starting to turn the corner.
job's looking up.
we can stop swabbing.
her clichés are getting healthier.
or she's less depressed.
aren't there pills that do that?
antidepressants don't cause fever.
not on their own.
but the E. R. Didn't know she was on M. A.O. Inhibitors, so they gave her demerol.
it's a nasty combo.
so all you have to do is convince this kid that his girlfriend had a secret doctor, and a secret stash, and a secret life.
it's been a while since a patient took a swing at you. Can I watch?
I only have to convince the mother.
actually.
I don't have to convince anyone.
this it total crap.
if she was seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know.
if she was on drugs, I'd know.
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the form so we can start the dialysis.
but why antidepressants? I don't understand!
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the forms so we can start the dialysis.
stop saying that.
Dr. Buffer, what is going on? What aren't you telling us?
he's a janitor?
more significantly, a blabbermouth.
house, shut up!
I am very sorry how dr. House handled this.
it is completely unforgivable.
except if he's right.
dialysis will filter her blood.
there's nothing to filter.
save her life.
she wasn't depressed.
I'm miserable around Ben.
not me. I like Ben.
february 12th.
either she's depressed, or she just thinks you're a jerk.
neither suggests that you should be the one directing her medical treatment.
does the diary say my daughter's taking these drugs?
no, but medically- - did you find drugs in their home?
she's probably hiding them in her purse.
I thought it would be rude to go searching under 1, 000 tons of rubble.
this was months ago. We were in a fight.
it doesn't mean she's depressed. And it doesn't mean she doesn't love me.
fine, maybe the diary proves nothing.
on the other hand, half the country's on antidepressants.
and it fits her symptoms perfectly.
no ring on your daughter's finger means you make the decisions.
I'm not sure that I know her well enough anymore.
you really wanna risk her life on how well he knows her?
I have your guita tell no one await my in structions
Wilson, you idiot.
listen carefully, and no one will get hurt.
you must follow these instructions.
any attempt to contact the F. B.I.
or other law enforcement agencies or Cutty.
will be met with.
and a large coke. No ice.
give it back.
what happened?
did someone. kidnap your guitar?
a $12, 000 1967 flying v? Or something?
Where'd you hide it?
I'm flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant.
no,'cause it takes a cri
it takes a criminal mastermind to pull off a heist from an unlocked, unguarded room down the hall.
what do you want?
me? Nothing.
but I'm sure the kidnapper wants what every kidnapper wants.
to see you interview five to seven well-qualified fellowship candidates.
I don't need a team.
you were bouncing ideas off a janitor.
and solved the case!
I'm dr. Cuddy.
if you can hear what I'm saying, blink once.
you can't talk right now. You have a tube down your throat.
and try not to move your head.
you've been in a terrible accident.
but it looks like you will have no permanent injuries.
you've had a bad fever, but it's gone now.
I've been here the whole time, honey, okay? I'm not leaving.
this is very important.
I need you to blink one for yes, twice for no.
were you seeing a psychiatrist?
were you on m. A.O. Inhibitors? The antidepressant.
Megan, it's okay. It doesn't matter, okay? I love you.
honey? Honey, what's wrong?
Megan, are you all right?
what's happening? Are we upsetting her?
heart is beating too fast.
get the family out of here. - Megan?
Megan? - Charging to 200.
clear!
we shocked her back into sinus rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.
fascinating.
equally fascinating is.
why are you here?
I was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet.
but you lost.
I explained the fever.
which is all we were talking about.
she confirmed the antidepressants.
go bet with someone else if you want to explain the heart problems.
she confirmed them by winking.
maybe there was a cute guy across the room.
she got better when I treated her.
even I'm not that cute.
two unrelated symptoms, just a coincidence.
or you're grasping at straws to avoid admitting you can't do this on your own.
fine, what explains the fever and persistent tachycardia?
could be anything. Endocarditis.
Nope. Fever, no infection.
keep going, you're doing great.
you win.
I don't believe you. - I'm not gonna play this game.
just give me the damn resumes.
and my guitar.
I don't have it.
although I did hear some.
plangent strumming from under that couch earlier.
this kidnapper isn't just bold, he's diabolical.
I guess he realized he probably shouldn't give it back to you until after you've had the interviews.
huh, you didn't write anything.
so what you're saying is, you didn't find that one big explanation.
cause there isn't one.
clever.
well, let's just say.
your antidepressant theory does explain the fever.
what about the heart? And don't say a building fell on her.
okay.
a structure collapsed. - Shut up come on, it fits.
hed musculature releases potassium, causes v-tac.
you'd think shd syndrome after she was crushed, not two days later.
microvascular occlusions.
takes that long for the blood to reperfuse.
she'd have a baggy heart.
echo it to confirm.
is crush syndrome good or bad?
does it sound good?
I mean, compared to the other things it could be.
there are no other things it could be.
then why are you testing her?
excellent question.
what. what is it?
the heart's fine.
why is she sweating?
her fever's back.
why would her fever be back?
I can't say.
you don't know?
I know, I just can't say.
cause you'll hit me.
let's discuss this in front of witnesses.
the dt's?
so she's an alcoholic now?
her first fever was from the medication for her depression.
or you're wrong.
the second fever was from the self-medication for depression.
this is insane.
you don'think I would have noticed her being constantly drunk?
you were practically living with Sylvia Plath.
you didn't notice that.
tone it down or I will hit you.
fine, I'll do liver enzyme tests.
lir zymes can also be elevated from musculoskeletal trauma.
they'd be there whether she had a drinking problem or not.
they don't know that.
just pretend to confirm.
what's the treatment?
she's not an alcoholic.
hair of the dog, iv alcohol.
taper it off after a few days.
she's sick and traumatized and half-dead.
you wanna make her drunk.
just do it.
you can't do this.
we lived together, we were gonna have kids.
you barely even know her.
apparently, neither did you.
Hello?
Hi, could I speak to Trevor.Kaufman?
yo yo, it's Trev. What up?
this is dr. Gregory House.
can you come in tomorrow to interview?
house? Are you serious? Awesome!
Hey, dude, I got the House interview!
Oh, look at me!
I got the House interview!
dude, shut up! I'm on the phone!
shut up! - I'm so cool!
give me the phone back. Give me the phone back!
I got a page.
no, you didn'T.
they called a code.
no, they didn'T.
you got a page, but not from us.
did you ever see raid on entebbe?
Yeah, in the end, they release the hostages.
how's that working for you?
the Ugandans played fair.
they didn't move the hostages on the Israelis.
once again, I am in awe of the kidnapper's tactical brilliance.
what is El Fuego Del Amor and why do you need ten of them?
it's a telanovela.
I'm learning Spanish.
say adios.
are you erasing my tivo?
house, not the season finale.
I don't negotiate with terrorists.
I smoke them out of their hidey-holes.
do you know what terrorists do when you don't negotiate?
they terrorize.
bring it on.
fever's down.
sweating has abated. Heart's working fine.
I guess House was right. Again.
that's good news, right?
it is good news.
so what does this mean, she's an alcoholic?
there's no other explanation?
no, sorry.
it doesn't make any sense.
Dr. Cuddy. she's doing this thing with her mouth again.
it's been on and off for the last couple hours.
is she trying to talk?
no.
I think she's screaming.
morning!
where did you come from?
apes, if you believe the democrats.
I heard you were there when I was proven right.
the alcohol treatment took away the heart and fever problems.
Yes, I was also there when you were proven wrong.
she'd been silently screaming for two hours.
amylase and lipase are through the roof.
she has pancreatitis.
IV alcohol can cause pancreatitis.
okay.
you're not gonna argue with me? - Nope.
you think I'm right? - Nope.
why not? - Nope.
it's not really a yes or no question.
which is why I'm not answering it.
if it's not the iv alcohol, it's gotta be- - not interested.
if I'm wrong, she's gonna die.
are you sure you're still dean of medicine.
I'm not interested in arguing because I'm not interested in enabling you.
you need someone to bounce ideas off of.
you need a team.
don't follow me.
M. A.O. Inhibitor caused the fever.
alcohol caused the pancreatitis.
alcohol withdrawal caused the v-tach. Le.
your logic is irrefutable.
you're wrong.
well, who are you gonna believe?
a classic toy or a woman who, if she had any confidence in her ideas, wouldn't feel the need to distract you with a water bra?
are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis?
are you here to enable me?
I don't want her to die because you're stubborn.
wow, so you can enable and rationalize at the same time.
guess you are still dean of medicine.
if you're right, then this guy, who's not an ass, who's not a workaholic, who's not a sociopath, has somehow missed both her depression and severe alcoholism.
Yes, imagine that, a couple with secrets.
why would she lie?
okay, alcoholism you don't wanna advertise.
but...
if you're right, there'd be an abnormality on the pancreas.
at least do an mri to confirm.
Oh, my god.
this guy means business.
or guys. Could be multiple guys.
or a gal. Who knows?
all I can say is, this reeks of boldness.
I am not hiring a team.
you ever tighten a guitar string really, really slowly?
past the point it can handle the strain?
it makes this weird sound.
almost like a scream.
I thought this was gonna be fun.
I messed with you, you messed with me.
eventually, you give in.
but you've shown a startling lack of humor, which got me thinking.
Oh, god.
what's the real reason you won't hire a team?
I told you, I don't need a team.
then hire three people and let 'em sit on their asses.
that wouldn't be right.
three years ago, you hired a team. What's changed?
I have become a man of principle.
I've gotten smarter.
what answer will make Socrates shut up?
what's changed is, you connected with a team.
you worked with a team.
and you lost a team.
damn.
there's no abnormalities in her pancreas.
you fall in love, you get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.
hiring employees can be even tougher.
because you know, eventually, they're gonna leave.
there's increased t2 signal on her hepatic capsule.
if you know what I mean.
you got hurt.
get over it.
now, if you'll excuse me, my patient is about to start bleeding out of her mouth and anus.
internal bleeding.
not anymore.
now it's all over the place.
why are you here?
that's my patient down there.
you're here because I'm here.
I am done enabling you.
I know.
the alcohol didn't cause the pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.
the question is, what caused the internal bleeding?
I hate myself.
you do know that the patient had a building land on her.
four days ago.
bleeding can start at any time.
it's bleeding from five different sites.
you think they synchronized their watches?
she got warfarin after her hip surgery.
it's designed to mess with bleeding patterns.
fever, heart, and bleeding.
three problems, three completely different explanations.
she must be the unluckiest woman in the world.
I only cling to this crazy theory because it's been proven right every step of the way.
each treatment worked.
Yes, she looks perfectly healthy.
this much bleeding is a symptom of something more.
and you need a team because you're wrong and you're gonna kill this woman.
if I had a team, this patient would be dead.
because they'd be here instead of me and they wouldn't notice the size of this woman's uterus.
Hi! How's it going?
mind if I observe?
got a big room up top window just for that.
Oh, stop that.
you wanna look at vaginas, there are websites for that.
think I'm made of money?
can you get him out of here?
enlarged uterus.
means that she was recently pregnant.
she's a good liar, but I doubt she could hide a baby from her boyfriend.
scraping in the uterus indicates that she had an abortion.
but nothing in her medical history.
only one reason to hide an abortion.
boyfriend wants babies, she doesn'T.
she's bleeding everywhere.
unless the guy was performing an abortion with a shotgun...
stop enabling him!
it's not the abortion, it's what she did after.
the boyfriend would have noticed condoms.
he would notice abstinence.
he would not notice the pill.
which means, I don't need a team!
Hey, where's your mother-in-common-law?
Dr. House, this is Doug Mcmurtry.
his girlfriend was working with Megan when...
she's dead?
she passed this morning.
well, then why are you still here?
I need the old lady's consent to do some treatment.
What'd you find out?
I wish I could tell you, but since you're not legally related...
what the hell did you find out?
your girlfriend had an abortion.
see why I didn't tell you?
I'd be insane to also tell you that she's on the pill.
no, she's not.
if they'd known she was on it, they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner after her hip surgery.
the combination caused the bleeding.
it's good news. It's treatable.
just give her tamoxifen.
which is normally a breast cancer - it's not true.
cause, uh, we wanna have kids.
huh.
see, I already did the blood tests.
and either she lied to you, or her blood lied to us.
tell Megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
how are you doing?
I got cancer.
you're on an oncology ward.
everybody's got cancer.
you want sympathy, you wanna try the "hardly anything wrong with the wold in fact," why don't I take you there right now?
how sick are you? Can you walk?
are you a doctor?
admitted today.
first day of a five day chemo course.
Yeah, you can walk. Come on, let's go.
does dr. Wilson know you're here?
well, if he didn't, this would be really stupid.
cause then he wouldn't know where his patient was.
he might think he no, the room upstairs is bigger.
it's got cable. Better looking sponge bath nurses.
if you feel sick, you call me directly, not dr. Wilson.
he's getting his last set of hormone shots.
you put her on tamoxifen?
an anti-cancer drug?
it blocks estrogen receptors.
does it also block breathing and kidney function?
she's crashing.
doesn't mean I was wrong.
we're bringing his patient over now, thanks.
anybody here a doctor?
kidney failure, spiking fever, breathing difficulties.
any theories?
am I in an m. Night shyamalan movie?
you're House, right?
okay, I assume you know me because
I once insulted you, your patient, or your relatives.
if that's so, I apologize. I was drunk that day.
patient initially presented with crush injuries.
I know you because dr. Cuddy issued a memo.
telling to cooperate fully with me?
Nope.
I figured that was a long shot.
anybody here not get that memo?
fungal infection.
don't you have a patient?
she shot herself in the leg while high on meth.
wouldn't hurt her to be in pain for a little while.
fungal infection would be in her eyes by now.
Haemophylus.
doesn't explain the remitting fever.
you've heard...that I've got a job opening, right?
I just care about people.
acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A. R.D. S.Doesn't explain anything.
except the breathing.
if you care about people, you're not getting the job.
I was lying. Crush syndrome.
doesn't explain the breathing.
what was the problem with A. R.D. S?
only explained the breathing.
and the crush syndrome?
it didn't explain the breathing.
you a fan of symmetry?
sure.
weird.
cause your eyes are lopsided.
and by eyes, I mean breasts.
A. R.D. S
and crush syndrome, both reactions to severe trauma.
why can't she have both?
because...
because then there's nothing we could do.
boy, you remind me of someone.
send me your resume.
I'll put it on top of the pile that I'm never gonna look at.
I couldn't leave.
you don't seem like the type of person who would give up on giving up.
I love her.
you love somebody.
someone who didn't drink, who wanted to have babies.
and wasn't miserable.
I know she lied, but...
what are you doing?
why are you saying these things to him?
the woman you love doesn't exist.
this woman is dying.
she has acute respiratory distress syndrome and crush syndrome.
her body's basically giving up.
we can keep her on supportive dialysis and hope for the best.
never mind. She has a lump on her arm.
does that mean you're wrong?
that would be good news for you guys.
we'll know after the biopsy.
which patient is that? - Megan...
house's patient. - Yep.
didn't you get my memo?
sure.
got both memos.
both.
and the second memo said to ignore the first memo?
Yep.
seemed odd.
did an mri and...
of course you did.
What'd you find?
it's kind of freaky. She's got growths all over the place.
she's got tumors?
not exactly.
the growths are eosinophilic granulomas.
they are usually from allergic reactions.
I'm putting her on steroids.
allergy to what? She doesn't have allergies.
we don't know.
unfortunately, the only drug she's had enough of to have this kind of reaction is cephalosporin.
and why is that unfortunate?
because she was on it two months ago.
that's what you mean, right?
she took it for strep throat, so she can't be allergic to it.
it would seem so.
what is this hospital doing to her?
she has had three separate medical disasters.
and now she's dying of an allergy she can't possibly have!
Mr. Lee, I just have to check...
Sam? Are you okay?
what are you doing here?
I was taking a nap.
Where's my patient?
you stole my patient.
you kidnapped my guitar.
give him back.
only when you give her back.
it's a she?
well, it's certainly not a dude.
it's a guitar! You took a human being!
now who doesn't have a sense of humor?
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.
what are you, listening for the distant sound of screaming?
the nurses know to call me.
they don't know who he is!
his name's right there on the chart.
now go away. I'm working.
they give him the wrong meds, who the hell knows what's gonna happen?
bad things would happen.
he's in room 318.
what are you-- what are you giving Megan?
Megan? Nothing.
nothing? What's going on? What's wrong with her?
her? Nothing.
then why are you giving her drugs?
just some amphetamines to wake her up.
everything could be explained by her lying to you.
the antidepressants, the drinking, the pill.
until now.
now she's allergic to something the chart says she's not allergic to.
that's not her lying, that's the chart lying.
which doesn't make S.
do you know Liz masters?
no.
that was her boyfriend who you met outside the morgue.
Mm.
this is her chart.
she's on M. A.O. Inhibitors for depression.
she's on the pill.
she had an abortion a month ago.
and she's allergic to cephalosporin.
what's going on here? What, are you saying this isn't Megan?
Yes.
since when?
since right before I began pretending I loved it.
she's the same size as Megan, same build, same hair color.
they were both horribly injured. Unrecognizably.
EMT teams do not second guess family members' identifications at accident scenes.
no. Liz died yesterday. This isn't liz.
I know Megan.
I know her hair.
I know her hands.
I know her smell. Oh.
what's your name?
Oh, god!
your girlfriend never lied to you.
I did it all by myself, mommy.
you talking to me?
go away.
I did it all by myself, mommy.
how'd you know it was me?
there's a scent given off by wounded, feral cats.
you were wrong.
I got everything right.
just treated the wrong - they had a good relationship.
he couldn't even identify her.
and you were wrong about needing a team.
she almost died.
so I almost need a team.
you were content with your "people are idiots" theory.
but cameron would never have accepted that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life.
and as soon as you claimed it was multiple conditions Foreman would have done anything to prove you wrong.
and then Chase would have done anything to prove you right.
any one of them would have solved this days ago.
hire a team.
I don't care how you do it.
just do it.
sometimes, I am wrong.
I have a gift for observation.
for reading people in situations.
but sometimes, I am wrong.
this will be the longest job interview of your life.
I will test you in ways that you will often consider unfair, demeaning, and illegal.
and you will often be right.
look to your left.
now look to your right.
by the end of six weeks, one of you will be gone.
as will 28 more of you.
wear a cup.
I said I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling too hot
you're sneezing. You can do that in a movie theatre.
it'll be a nice soft chair when I collapsed. I'm babe oh, come on! We're gonna be late!
episode four never comes to the big screen.
this is the pre-lucas-ized version, remember?
none of that greedo shooting first crap.
go without me
what are you talking about? You love Star Wars
don't you
since when?
since just before I pretending I loved it
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to be supportive.
fine. I'll go alone.
baby I'm sorry.
me too. I'm so woozy. I can hardly think.
we're hanging at home
you should go
did you just feel something?
feel? Like what?
is there earthquake?
in New Jersey?
Oh god -What?
I think I'm like hallucinating.
call 911
two surgeries for multiple fractures and burns.
I'm thinking the broken bones are a response to the building falling on her head.
and the fever?
she's the only collapse victim whose body temperature
put her on antipyrectics.
already have. The fever is holding at 104.
fluctuating consciousness.
I can't take the case. I don't have a team.
so hire a team. - What for? I don't have a case.
have you even interviewed anybody?
you test drive a car before you buy it.
you have sex before you get married, I can't hire a team based on a ten-minute interview.
what if I don't like having sex with them?
you've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing.
concert is over.
in what twisted universe does mastering eddie Van Halen's two-handed arpeggio technique count as absolutely nothing?
take the case or you will spend the next month helping the collapse team change bandages.
I diagnose her. Alone.
by the end of the day, you go away for a week.
done.
it's not gonna work.
if he solves the case, we cure the girl.
and prove he doesn't need a team.
he's not gonna solve the case. Not that fast.
why not. - Because he needs a team!
and this'll prove to him- - you wanna change his mind about something, you need a more convincing argument than you promised.
fever.
non-responsive to antibiotics and antipyretics.
fluctuating consciousness.
go!
you talking to me?
Yes.
imagine that the roof of the storage closet collapses on your favorite floor buffer.
which then starts overheating.
why would I have a favorite floor buffer?
okay.
maybe the electrical works got banged up in there from stuff falling on it.
hmm, interesting.
brain damage leading to hypothalamic dysregulation.
Nah.
if you're brought in covered in rubble, it's all about the mri'S.
we'd have seen that. Come on!
you gotta earn that fiver.
or stuff leaked in the holes, messing it up.
lacerations leave multiple portals for infection.
bacterial would have responded to the antibiotics.
too high for viral.
parasites or fungus is possible.
or maybe lupus.
my grandma has lupus.
okay, autoimmune. I'll run a lupus panel.
infection fits best.
complete history would be helpful.
which leads to the worst part of the job.
dealing with the floor buffer's family.
we talked every couple of weeks, but Ben would know better than I
no farms, no travel anywhere weird.
you get that, dr. Buffer?
no travel, no farm.
the file says she was sick before the building collapsed.
I figured it was just a cold.
why, do you think's related?
her being sick and her being sick?
often is.
she was unconscious when I found her.
we'd been fighting.
I just want to.
just tell me she's gonna be okay.
I'm not even sure you're gonna be okay.
we're gonna make her all better.
showoff.
you oughta be nicer to people.
where are we going?
you know how the laughter of little children is infectious?
well, parasites and fungi are even more so.
we're gonna find out which one is making her brain bubble over.
where, the building?
epa's doing that job for us. They say it's clean.
which means we're making a pilgrimage to castle blackberry.
her name's Bradbury.
I should ask them for keys. - No need.
I'm sure we can find a large rock somewhere.
I'm not breaking in to somebody's house.
I got principles.
I got some loose change here says you don't.
I'm not doing this.
for less than a 50.
Where's the restaurant?
what restaurant?
the one you said you were taking me to for lunch.
Oh, uh, this one's homier.
dibs on the cold pizza.
I'm sure it looked easier on youtube.
Yeah, you don't need a team.
you can't even get arrested without company.
you're right. Only one solution.
never replace them. Ever.
do you need help?
Yeah, yeah, patronize the poor cripple.
let me get that. - I got it.
will you--let me just let me get it.
I'll check the bedroom.
some interesting mold on the windowsill here!
it's gonna take me a while.
I'll cover the bathroom.
she had a secret diary.
is there any other kind?
what are you doing?
there's a sale on liquid tide.
if you're broke, I can lend you a tiny bit of the money I owe you.
no, no, I wouldn't put you in that position.
what does the diary say?
it's basically a list of her sexual encounters.
boys, girls, vibrating appliances.
if it was, you'd be quoting, not summarizing.
this is a parade of sad banalities.
I can hardly get out of bed.
feeling blue.
then, three months ago, turns into a parade of happy banalities.
starting to turn the corner.
job's looking up.
we can stop swabbing.
her clichés are getting healthier.
or she's less depressed.
aren't there pills that do that?
antidepressants don't cause fever.
not on their own.
but the E. R. Didn't know she was on M. A.O. Inhibitors, so they gave her demerol.
it's a nasty combo.
so all you have to do is convince this kid that his girlfriend had a secret doctor, and a secret stash, and a secret life.
it's been a while since a patient took a swing at you. Can I watch?
I only have to convince the mother.
actually.
I don't have to convince anyone.
this it total crap.
if she was seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know.
if she was on drugs, I'd know.
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the form so we can start the dialysis.
but why antidepressants? I don't understand!
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the forms so we can start the dialysis.
stop saying that.
Dr. Buffer, what is going on? What aren't you telling us?
he's a janitor?
more significantly, a blabbermouth.
house, shut up!
I am very sorry how dr. House handled this.
it is completely unforgivable.
except if he's right.
dialysis will filter her blood.
there's nothing to filter.
save her life.
she wasn't depressed.
I'm miserable around Ben.
not me. I like Ben.
february 12th.
either she's depressed, or she just thinks you're a jerk.
neither suggests that you should be the one directing her medical treatment.
does the diary say my daughter's taking these drugs?
no, but medically- - did you find drugs in their home?
she's probably hiding them in her purse.
I thought it would be rude to go searching under 1, 000 tons of rubble.
this was months ago. We were in a fight.
it doesn't mean she's depressed. And it doesn't mean she doesn't love me.
fine, maybe the diary proves nothing.
on the other hand, half the country's on antidepressants.
and it fits her symptoms perfectly.
no ring on your daughter's finger means you make the decisions.
I'm not sure that I know her well enough anymore.
you really wanna risk her life on how well he knows her?
I have your guita tell no one await my in structions
Wilson, you idiot.
listen carefully, and no one will get hurt.
you must follow these instructions.
any attempt to contact the F. B.I.
or other law enforcement agencies or Cutty.
will be met with.
and a large coke. No ice.
give it back.
what happened?
did someone. kidnap your guitar?
a $12, 000 1967 flying v? Or something?
Where'd you hide it?
I'm flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant.
no,'cause it takes a cri
it takes a criminal mastermind to pull off a heist from an unlocked, unguarded room down the hall.
what do you want?
me? Nothing.
but I'm sure the kidnapper wants what every kidnapper wants.
to see you interview five to seven well-qualified fellowship candidates.
I don't need a team.
you were bouncing ideas off a janitor.
and solved the case!
I'm dr. Cuddy.
if you can hear what I'm saying, blink once.
you can't talk right now. You have a tube down your throat.
and try not to move your head.
you've been in a terrible accident.
but it looks like you will have no permanent injuries.
you've had a bad fever, but it's gone now.
I've been here the whole time, honey, okay? I'm not leaving.
this is very important.
I need you to blink one for yes, twice for no.
were you seeing a psychiatrist?
were you on m. A.O. Inhibitors? The antidepressant.
Megan, it's okay. It doesn't matter, okay? I love you.
honey? Honey, what's wrong?
Megan, are you all right?
what's happening? Are we upsetting her?
heart is beating too fast.
get the family out of here. - Megan?
Megan? - Charging to 200.
clear!
we shocked her back into sinus rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.
fascinating.
equally fascinating is.
why are you here?
I was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet.
but you lost.
I explained the fever.
which is all we were talking about.
she confirmed the antidepressants.
go bet with someone else if you want to explain the heart problems.
she confirmed them by winking.
maybe there was a cute guy across the room.
she got better when I treated her.
even I'm not that cute.
two unrelated symptoms, just a coincidence.
or you're grasping at straws to avoid admitting you can't do this on your own.
fine, what explains the fever and persistent tachycardia?
could be anything. Endocarditis.
Nope. Fever, no infection.
keep going, you're doing great.
you win.
I don't believe you. - I'm not gonna play this game.
just give me the damn resumes.
and my guitar.
I don't have it.
although I did hear some.
plangent strumming from under that couch earlier.
this kidnapper isn't just bold, he's diabolical.
I guess he realized he probably shouldn't give it back to you until after you've had the interviews.
huh, you didn't write anything.
so what you're saying is, you didn't find that one big explanation.
cause there isn't one.
clever.
well, let's just say.
your antidepressant theory does explain the fever.
what about the heart? And don't say a building fell on her.
okay.
a structure collapsed. - Shut up come on, it fits.
hed musculature releases potassium, causes v-tac.
you'd think shd syndrome after she was crushed, not two days later.
microvascular occlusions.
takes that long for the blood to reperfuse.
she'd have a baggy heart.
echo it to confirm.
is crush syndrome good or bad?
does it sound good?
I mean, compared to the other things it could be.
there are no other things it could be.
then why are you testing her?
excellent question.
what. what is it?
the heart's fine.
why is she sweating?
her fever's back.
why would her fever be back?
I can't say.
you don't know?
I know, I just can't say.
cause you'll hit me.
let's discuss this in front of witnesses.
the dt's?
so she's an alcoholic now?
her first fever was from the medication for her depression.
or you're wrong.
the second fever was from the self-medication for depression.
this is insane.
you don'think I would have noticed her being constantly drunk?
you were practically living with Sylvia Plath.
you didn't notice that.
tone it down or I will hit you.
fine, I'll do liver enzyme tests.
lir zymes can also be elevated from musculoskeletal trauma.
they'd be there whether she had a drinking problem or not.
they don't know that.
just pretend to confirm.
what's the treatment?
she's not an alcoholic.
hair of the dog, iv alcohol.
taper it off after a few days.
she's sick and traumatized and half-dead.
you wanna make her drunk.
just do it.
you can't do this.
we lived together, we were gonna have kids.
you barely even know her.
apparently, neither did you.
Hello?
Hi, could I speak to Trevor.Kaufman?
yo yo, it's Trev. What up?
this is dr. Gregory House.
can you come in tomorrow to interview?
house? Are you serious? Awesome!
Hey, dude, I got the House interview!
Oh, look at me!
I got the House interview!
dude, shut up! I'm on the phone!
shut up! - I'm so cool!
give me the phone back. Give me the phone back!
I got a page.
no, you didn'T.
they called a code.
no, they didn'T.
you got a page, but not from us.
did you ever see raid on entebbe?
Yeah, in the end, they release the hostages.
how's that working for you?
the Ugandans played fair.
they didn't move the hostages on the Israelis.
once again, I am in awe of the kidnapper's tactical brilliance.
what is El Fuego Del Amor and why do you need ten of them?
it's a telanovela.
I'm learning Spanish.
say adios.
are you erasing my tivo?
house, not the season finale.
I don't negotiate with terrorists.
I smoke them out of their hidey-holes.
do you know what terrorists do when you don't negotiate?
they terrorize.
bring it on.
fever's down.
sweating has abated. Heart's working fine.
I guess House was right. Again.
that's good news, right?
it is good news.
so what does this mean, she's an alcoholic?
there's no other explanation?
no, sorry.
it doesn't make any sense.
Dr. Cuddy. she's doing this thing with her mouth again.
it's been on and off for the last couple hours.
is she trying to talk?
no.
I think she's screaming.
morning!
where did you come from?
apes, if you believe the democrats.
I heard you were there when I was proven right.
the alcohol treatment took away the heart and fever problems.
Yes, I was also there when you were proven wrong.
she'd been silently screaming for two hours.
amylase and lipase are through the roof.
she has pancreatitis.
IV alcohol can cause pancreatitis.
okay.
you're not gonna argue with me? - Nope.
you think I'm right? - Nope.
why not? - Nope.
it's not really a yes or no question.
which is why I'm not answering it.
if it's not the iv alcohol, it's gotta be- - not interested.
if I'm wrong, she's gonna die.
are you sure you're still dean of medicine.
I'm not interested in arguing because I'm not interested in enabling you.
you need someone to bounce ideas off of.
you need a team.
don't follow me.
M. A.O. Inhibitor caused the fever.
alcohol caused the pancreatitis.
alcohol withdrawal caused the v-tach. Le.
your logic is irrefutable.
you're wrong.
well, who are you gonna believe?
a classic toy or a woman who, if she had any confidence in her ideas, wouldn't feel the need to distract you with a water bra?
are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis?
are you here to enable me?
I don't want her to die because you're stubborn.
wow, so you can enable and rationalize at the same time.
guess you are still dean of medicine.
if you're right, then this guy, who's not an ass, who's not a workaholic, who's not a sociopath, has somehow missed both her depression and severe alcoholism.
Yes, imagine that, a couple with secrets.
why would she lie?
okay, alcoholism you don't wanna advertise.
but...
if you're right, there'd be an abnormality on the pancreas.
at least do an mri to confirm.
Oh, my god.
this guy means business.
or guys. Could be multiple guys.
or a gal. Who knows?
all I can say is, this reeks of boldness.
I am not hiring a team.
you ever tighten a guitar string really, really slowly?
past the point it can handle the strain?
it makes this weird sound.
almost like a scream.
I thought this was gonna be fun.
I messed with you, you messed with me.
eventually, you give in.
but you've shown a startling lack of humor, which got me thinking.
Oh, god.
what's the real reason you won't hire a team?
I told you, I don't need a team.
then hire three people and let 'em sit on their asses.
that wouldn't be right.
three years ago, you hired a team. What's changed?
I have become a man of principle.
I've gotten smarter.
what answer will make Socrates shut up?
what's changed is, you connected with a team.
you worked with a team.
and you lost a team.
damn.
there's no abnormalities in her pancreas.
you fall in love, you get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.
hiring employees can be even tougher.
because you know, eventually, they're gonna leave.
there's increased t2 signal on her hepatic capsule.
if you know what I mean.
you got hurt.
get over it.
now, if you'll excuse me, my patient is about to start bleeding out of her mouth and anus.
internal bleeding.
not anymore.
now it's all over the place.
why are you here?
that's my patient down there.
you're here because I'm here.
I am done enabling you.
I know.
the alcohol didn't cause the pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.
the question is, what caused the internal bleeding?
I hate myself.
you do know that the patient had a building land on her.
four days ago.
bleeding can start at any time.
it's bleeding from five different sites.
you think they synchronized their watches?
she got warfarin after her hip surgery.
it's designed to mess with bleeding patterns.
fever, heart, and bleeding.
three problems, three completely different explanations.
she must be the unluckiest woman in the world.
I only cling to this crazy theory because it's been proven right every step of the way.
each treatment worked.
Yes, she looks perfectly healthy.
this much bleeding is a symptom of something more.
and you need a team because you're wrong and you're gonna kill this woman.
if I had a team, this patient would be dead.
because they'd be here instead of me and they wouldn't notice the size of this woman's uterus.
Hi! How's it going?
mind if I observe?
got a big room up top window just for that.
Oh, stop that.
you wanna look at vaginas, there are websites for that.
think I'm made of money?
can you get him out of here?
enlarged uterus.
means that she was recently pregnant.
she's a good liar, but I doubt she could hide a baby from her boyfriend.
scraping in the uterus indicates that she had an abortion.
but nothing in her medical history.
only one reason to hide an abortion.
boyfriend wants babies, she doesn'T.
she's bleeding everywhere.
unless the guy was performing an abortion with a shotgun...
stop enabling him!
it's not the abortion, it's what she did after.
the boyfriend would have noticed condoms.
he would notice abstinence.
he would not notice the pill.
which means, I don't need a team!
Hey, where's your mother-in-common-law?
Dr. House, this is Doug Mcmurtry.
his girlfriend was working with Megan when...
she's dead?
she passed this morning.
well, then why are you still here?
I need the old lady's consent to do some treatment.
What'd you find out?
I wish I could tell you, but since you're not legally related...
what the hell did you find out?
your girlfriend had an abortion.
see why I didn't tell you?
I'd be insane to also tell you that she's on the pill.
no, she's not.
if they'd known she was on it, they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner after her hip surgery.
the combination caused the bleeding.
it's good news. It's treatable.
just give her tamoxifen.
which is normally a breast cancer - it's not true.
cause, uh, we wanna have kids.
huh.
see, I already did the blood tests.
and either she lied to you, or her blood lied to us.
tell Megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
how are you doing?
I got cancer.
you're on an oncology ward.
everybody's got cancer.
you want sympathy, you wanna try the "hardly anything wrong with the wold in fact," why don't I take you there right now?
how sick are you? Can you walk?
are you a doctor?
admitted today.
first day of a five day chemo course.
Yeah, you can walk. Come on, let's go.
does dr. Wilson know you're here?
well, if he didn't, this would be really stupid.
cause then he wouldn't know where his patient was.
he might think he no, the room upstairs is bigger.
it's got cable. Better looking sponge bath nurses.
if you feel sick, you call me directly, not dr. Wilson.
he's getting his last set of hormone shots.
you put her on tamoxifen?
an anti-cancer drug?
it blocks estrogen receptors.
does it also block breathing and kidney function?
she's crashing.
doesn't mean I was wrong.
we're bringing his patient over now, thanks.
anybody here a doctor?
kidney failure, spiking fever, breathing difficulties.
any theories?
am I in an m. Night shyamalan movie?
you're House, right?
okay, I assume you know me because
I once insulted you, your patient, or your relatives.
if that's so, I apologize. I was drunk that day.
patient initially presented with crush injuries.
I know you because dr. Cuddy issued a memo.
telling to cooperate fully with me?
Nope.
I figured that was a long shot.
anybody here not get that memo?
fungal infection.
don't you have a patient?
she shot herself in the leg while high on meth.
wouldn't hurt her to be in pain for a little while.
fungal infection would be in her eyes by now.
Haemophylus.
doesn't explain the remitting fever.
you've heard...that I've got a job opening, right?
I just care about people.
acute respiratory distress syndrome.
A. R.D. S.Doesn't explain anything.
except the breathing.
if you care about people, you're not getting the job.
I was lying. Crush syndrome.
doesn't explain the breathing.
what was the problem with A. R.D. S?
only explained the breathing.
and the crush syndrome?
it didn't explain the breathing.
you a fan of symmetry?
sure.
weird.
cause your eyes are lopsided.
and by eyes, I mean breasts.
A. R.D. S
and crush syndrome, both reactions to severe trauma.
why can't she have both?
because...
because then there's nothing we could do.
boy, you remind me of someone.
send me your resume.
I'll put it on top of the pile that I'm never gonna look at.
I couldn't leave.
you don't seem like the type of person who would give up on giving up.
I love her.
you love somebody.
someone who didn't drink, who wanted to have babies.
and wasn't miserable.
I know she lied, but...
what are you doing?
why are you saying these things to him?
the woman you love doesn't exist.
this woman is dying.
she has acute respiratory distress syndrome and crush syndrome.
her body's basically giving up.
we can keep her on supportive dialysis and hope for the best.
never mind. She has a lump on her arm.
does that mean you're wrong?
that would be good news for you guys.
we'll know after the biopsy.
which patient is that? - Megan...
house's patient. - Yep.
didn't you get my memo?
sure.
got both memos.
both.
and the second memo said to ignore the first memo?
Yep.
seemed odd.
did an mri and...
of course you did.
What'd you find?
it's kind of freaky. She's got growths all over the place.
she's got tumors?
not exactly.
the growths are eosinophilic granulomas.
they are usually from allergic reactions.
I'm putting her on steroids.
allergy to what? She doesn't have allergies.
we don't know.
unfortunately, the only drug she's had enough of to have this kind of reaction is cephalosporin.
and why is that unfortunate?
because she was on it two months ago.
that's what you mean, right?
she took it for strep throat, so she can't be allergic to it.
it would seem so.
what is this hospital doing to her?
she has had three separate medical disasters.
and now she's dying of an allergy she can't possibly have!
Mr. Lee, I just have to check...
Sam? Are you okay?
what are you doing here?
I was taking a nap.
Where's my patient?
you stole my patient.
you kidnapped my guitar.
give him back.
only when you give her back.
it's a she?
well, it's certainly not a dude.
it's a guitar! You took a human being!
now who doesn't have a sense of humor?
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.
what are you, listening for the distant sound of screaming?
the nurses know to call me.
they don't know who he is!
his name's right there on the chart.
now go away. I'm working.
they give him the wrong meds, who the hell knows what's gonna happen?
bad things would happen.
he's in room 318.
what are you-- what are you giving Megan?
Megan? Nothing.
nothing? What's going on? What's wrong with her?
her? Nothing.
then why are you giving her drugs?
just some amphetamines to wake her up.
everything could be explained by her lying to you.
the antidepressants, the drinking, the pill.
until now.
now she's allergic to something the chart says she's not allergic to.
that's not her lying, that's the chart lying.
which doesn't make S.
do you know Liz masters?
no.
that was her boyfriend who you met outside the morgue.
Mm.
this is her chart.
she's on M. A.O. Inhibitors for depression.
she's on the pill.
she had an abortion a month ago.
and she's allergic to cephalosporin.
what's going on here? What, are you saying this isn't Megan?
Yes.
since when?
since right before I began pretending I loved it.
she's the same size as Megan, same build, same hair color.
they were both horribly injured. Unrecognizably.
EMT teams do not second guess family members' identifications at accident scenes.
no. Liz died yesterday. This isn't liz.
I know Megan.
I know her hair.
I know her hands.
I know her smell. Oh.
what's your name?
Oh, god!
your girlfriend never lied to you.
I did it all by myself, mommy.
you talking to me?
go away.
I did it all by myself, mommy.
how'd you know it was me?
there's a scent given off by wounded, feral cats.
you were wrong.
I got everything right.
just treated the wrong - they had a good relationship.
he couldn't even identify her.
and you were wrong about needing a team.
she almost died.
so I almost need a team.
you were content with your "people are idiots" theory.
but cameron would never have accepted that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life.
and as soon as you claimed it was multiple conditions Foreman would have done anything to prove you wrong.
and then Chase would have done anything to prove you right.
any one of them would have solved this days ago.
hire a team.
I don't care how you do it.
just do it.
sometimes, I am wrong.
I have a gift for observation.
for reading people in situations.
but sometimes, I am wrong.
this will be the longest job interview of your life.
I will test you in ways that you will often consider unfair, demeaning, and illegal.
and you will often be right.
look to your left.
now look to your right.
by the end of six weeks, one of you will be gone.
as will 28 more of you.
wear a cup.
let's GO CHECK HER OUT.
what ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING--IT'S ALMOST 4: 00.
you GOT SOMEWHERE TO BE?
we KNOW HE LIKES TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE.
he's PROBABLY TESTING US.
to FIND OUT WHAT?
how LONG WE CAN LOOK STUPID FOR?
he SAID HE'D BE HERE BY 3: 00.
he's OBVIOUSLY NOT COMING.
I'm GOING HOME.
nobody FOLLOW HER.
she PIED PIPERED NINE PEOPLE RIGHT OUT OF A JOB LAST WEEK.
would YOU MIND HOLDING MY METAPHOR FOR A SECOND?
new PATIENT.
37 YEAR-OLD MALE.
suffers FROM SEVERE ASCENDING MUSCLE WEAKNESS.
why ARE YOU LATE?
to SEE WHO'D PUT UP WITH IT.
so IF WE LEFT, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED?
I WAS GONNA FIRE WHOEVER STUCK AROUND.
but SINCE EVERYONE STUCK AROUND...
28% CURVATURE OF THE SPINE HAS CAUSED REDUCED LUNG CAPACITY,
and HAS REDUCED BONE MINERAL DENSITY.
patient HAS SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY.
it's GENETIC,
incurable.
this IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC MYSTERY.
you HAVE JUST GIVEN STATE SECRETS TO THE ENEMY.
what ENEMY?
new PATIENT. NEW RULES.
today YOU'RE GONNA SPLIT YOURSELVES INTO TWO TEAMS.
first TO FIGURE OUT
what's THREATENING TO DEPRIVE THE PATIENT
of THE 20 OR SO MISERABLE YEARS HE'S GOT LEFT WITH SMA,
gets TO KEEP THEIR JOBS.
take OFF YOUR NUMBERS. YOU LOOK STUPID.
and I THINK I KNOW WHO YOU ARE BY NOW.
wait. HOW DO YOU WANT US TO SPLIT UP?
good QUESTION,
overly EXCITED FORMER FOSTER KID.
there's TEN OF YOU.
I'm THINKING SIX AGAINST SIX.
no, WAIT.
how ABOUT WOMEN VERSUS MEN?
excellent SUGGESTION,
fat TWIN.
more INTERESTING THAN EVENS VERSUS ODDS,
less INTERESTING THAN SHIRTS AGAINST SKINS.
if YOUR SEX ORGANS DANGLE, YOU'RE THE CONFEDERATES.
if YOUR SEX ORGANS ARE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING,
you're THE YANKS.
Dr. HOUSE...
SDOOUR SEX ORGANS DANGLE, CUTTHROAT BITCH?
not YET.
you NEVER?? ONE FEMALE IN YOUR TEAM BEFORE.
if YOU'RE GOING TO PURGE AN ENTIRE GENDER,
it ISN'T GOING TO BE THE DANGLERS.
sounds LOGICAL.
if YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT FOR MORE THAN THREE SECONDS.
but I JUST TOLD YOU THAT IF THE DANGLERS LOSE, THEY'RE OUT.
an I C ONLY ASSUME,
you're HIDING THE REAL REASON.
manipulative.
cutthroat BITCH IS YOUR OFFIITLE.
ng THIS GE,
if THE DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.
first THING WE DO IS GANG BANG THE SUCKER.
that's NOT WHAT I SAID. WHY DO YOU THINK A LOW SODIUM
two WEEKS AGO.
Hey, WRITE BIGGER AND ANGLE THE BOARD MORE SO THEY CAN SEE IT.
this IS WRONG.
it's OG TY CHEAT F US
and IF THEY CHEAT OFF US, THEY'RE WRONG.
they're NOT CHEATING. ONE OF THEM IS MOVING.
Hey, STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR SUTURES
or I'LL HAVE TO REDO THEM.
why DO YOU GUYS KEEP A D CELL BATTERY
in A URINE SPECIMEN CUP?
because WE PULLED IT FROM A PATIENT'S INTESTINE.
why WOULD SOMEBODY SWALLOW A BATTERY?
why DO YOU ASSUME IT WAS SWALLOWED?
bed FIVE NEEDS A BAG OF RINGER'S LACTATE.
it WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE'D USED A NINE VOLT.
who SAID IT WAS A "HE"?
false ASSUMPTIONS. YOU'RE GOOD.
you're TRYING TO GET ME TO THINK LIKE HIM.
and YOU'RE TRYING TO KISS MY ASS.
why ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
because HOUSE IS TURNING PATIENT CARE INTO A GAME.
it's DANGEROUS-- THE PATIENT'S GONNA SUFFER,
maybe DIE.
you REALLY NEED TO SHAVE.
see WHAT I DID THERE?
interesting.
need A CRASH CART IN HERE!
I DIDN'T DO IT.
when A PERSON FAINTS, IT'S BECAUSE
they're NOT GETTING ENOUGH BLOOD TO THEIR BRAIN.
the ACT OF FALLING CORRECTS THE PROBLEM.
you FAINT AGAIN STRAPPED INTO THAT POWER CHAIR
where YOU CAN'T FALL... YOU MIGHT NOT WAKE UP.
killed BY AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE.
at LEAST MY DEATH WOULD BE IRONIC.
I THINK WHEN YOU WENT TO THAILAND
you PICKED UP A THREAD WORM CALLED STRONGYLOIDES.
they USUALLY GO UP THROUGH YOUR FEET.
I DIDN'T DO A LOT OF WALKING ON THE BEACH.
but I ASSUME YOU DID HAVE SOMEONE
lay YOU DOWN IN THE SAND.
bare BACK, BARE LEGS.
increases EXPOSURE TENFOLD OVER BARE FEET.
two PILLS.
you'll BE ALL BETTER.
can I HAVE SOME WATER FOR THOSE, PLEASE?
Hey, TAKE A NUMBER.
house DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT TAKING TURNS.
what's SHE TESTING HIM FOR? DON'T.
they'll SPEND ALL DAY OBSESSING OVER MY IDEA
instead OF COMING UP WITH ONE OF THEIR OWN.
and HEY, I MIGHT BE WRONG. SERIOUSLY.
I'm WORRIED THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW
what SHE'S GIVING YOU THERE CAN BE CONFLICTS.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
house TOLD ME
he's KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THAT.
ten DOCTORS.
they SHOULD BE GETTING TEN CURES.
we NEED BLOOD, HAIR, AND STOOL.
you POOP, AND THEN YOU USE THE WOODEN STICKS
to COLLECT THE FECAL MATTER,
then YOU RUB IT ON THE GREEN BOX.
hand IT TO MY DOG.
only ONE OF THOSE THINGS I CAN DO ON MY OWN.
and THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT.
is IT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU IF WE...
carry YOU INTO THE BATHROOM?
if YOU WANT ME THERE,
that's THE WAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.
okay.
ready? MM-HM.
can I GET A LITTLE HEAD SUPPORT, PLEASE?
thank YOU.
why ARE YOU HERE?
my OFFICES ARE BEING USED BY MY TEAMS.
teams?
which MEANS THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN YELL AT ME.
you HAVE TEAMS?
two OF THEM.
I WANTED TO DEAL WITH THE YELLING TODAY,
because I NOTICED WHAT YOU WERE WEARING,
and I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LISTEN ALL THAT CLOSELY.
you CAN'T MAKE A COMPETITION OUT OF PATIENT CARE.
without COMPETITION,
we'd STILL BE SINGLE-CELL ORGANISMS.
can I GO NOW?
not UNTIL AFTER THE YELLING.
what's WRONG WITH HIM?
I HAVE SEVEN OF THE FINEST MINDS ON IT.
along WITH THREE VERY SPECIAL
you WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS,
unless YOU ALREADY KNEW-- UH-UH.
I TELL YOU, YOU TELL THEM.
game's OVER.
if YOU KNOW, YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO TREAT.
well, THEN IN THAT CASE, I DON'T KNOW.
why WOULD A GUY...
voluntarily SHOVE A METAL OBJECT
into AN ELECTRICAL SOCKET?
I'm GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KNOWING THE ANSWER.
what WOULD HAPPEN IF I SHUT DOWN THIS GAME?
I'd FIRE THEM ALL,
hire 40 NEW FELLOWSHIP APPLICANTS,
start THE GAME ALL OVER AGAIN.
you DO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM, RIGHT?
Oh, IT'D BE PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE IF I DIDN'T,
wouldn't IT?
antibiotics AREN'T WORKING.
legionella COULD EXPLAIN THE LUNGS, THE FEVER...
if SHE HAD LEGIONELLA, SHE'D HAVE LOW SODIUM.
what CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HER?
she LIKES BODY SURFING.
maybe PICKED UP A VIRUS SWIMMING OFF JONES BEACH.
but SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE ENERGY TO FINISH HER CROSSWORD ANYMORE.
her BOYFRIEND SAID
that's IT.
what IS? BLURRY VISION.
how DO YOU GET BLURRY VISION FROM
you DON'T STOP A DAILY RITUAL THAT CURES BOREDOM
because YOU'RE BORED.
she STOPPED DOING HER CROSSWORD PUZZLE
because SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME READING IT.
what CAUSES FEVER, BOGGY LUNGS
and BLURRY VISION? FUNGAL.
aspergillus WOULD EXPLAIN THE PNEUMONIA, WHICH EXPLAINS THE FEVER.
start HER ON AMPHOTERICIN.
Hey, GUYS?
great JOB.
if YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE YOURSELF OUT,
why CHOOSE ELECTRICITY?
you EAT A BULLET, JUMP OFF A BUILDING
I LOVE THE TEAM THING, BY THE WAY.
bury YOURSELF ALIVE IN CUDDY'S CLEAVAGE.
teamwork, COLLABORATION, ALL FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
it COULD HAVE BEEN A SUICIDAL GESTURE,
as OPPOSED TO AN ACTUAL ATTEMPT.
interestingly, THE RAIN IN SPAIN
doesn't ACTUALLY FALL IN THE PLAIN ALL THAT MUCH.
but WHO PUTS THEIR INTERNAL ORGANS ON A SKILLET JUST TO GET ATTENTION?
go ASK HIM.
that WOULD BE CHEATING.
got A DIAGNOSIS YET?
get OUT OF HERE.
got A STOOL SAMPLE YET?
how COULD YOU KNOW?
Oh, I TALKED TO A NURSE.
pretty BRILLIANT, HUH?
I GIVE YOU A MOVE HOUSE WILL LOVE, STRAIGHT FROM ONE
of HIS FORMER FELLOWS, AND YOU LET ME JOIN YOUR TEAM.
you're TOO LATE.
we ALREADY HAVE OUR DIAGNOSIS.
he's LYING BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU TO GO AWAY.
so DO I.
how DO WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT A DOUBLE AGENT?
to FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE THINKING,
then GO BACK TO THE WOMEN?
because I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
you WANNA KNOW WHY I WANT TO BE ON YOUR TEAM?
because YOU'RE IDIOTS.
if I CAN GET THE WOMEN OUT OF THE COMPETITION, I'M IN.
and SO ARE TWO OF YOU.
so...what's THE BIG MOVE?
it's CALLED XENODIAGNOSIS.
we LET THIS BUGS BITE YOU, AND THEN WE TEST THEIR FECES
for PARASITES.
why CAN'T YOU TEST MY FECES?
because YOU'VE BEEN CHUGGING MILK OF MAGNESIA FOR THE PAST HOUR.
you HAVE A LOT GOING IN AND NOTHING COMING OUT.
testing THE BUGS' FECES
is ACTUALLY MORE ACCURATE THAN TESTING YOURS.
smaller HAYSTACK, EASIER TO FIND THE NEEDLE.
you OKAY? [dog barking]
[Alarm beeping] GET THE BUGS OFF.
get THE BUGS OFF HIM!
test ISN'T DONE.
he's CHOKING!
patchy INFILTRATES ON THE X-RAY.
patient IMPROVED WITH CHEST PT AND OXYGEN, CONSISTENT WITH ASPIRATION.
so NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER SYMPTOM TO EXPLAIN.
why DOES HIS THROAT THINK HIS LUNGS ARE HIS STOMACH?
and WHY ARE YOUR THROATS CLOSING UP?
shouldn't WE BE IN SEPARATE ROOMS?
you THINK I'M GONNA RUN TWO DIFFERENTIALS THIS TIME IN THE MORNING?
grumpy, YOU'RE FIRST.
I'm NOT GRUMPY.
Oh, WHY WOULD I CALL YOU THAT IF YOU WEREN'T?
it's AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION.

you LIKE EXOTIC.
why ARE YOU HERE?
I WANT THIS JOB.

no. I--I JUST
this IS NOT THE JOB YOU WANT.
this IS THE JOB IN THE ZIP CODE YOU WANT.
you ENGAGED?
Yes. TA DA!
am I NOT ALLOWED TO GROW UP

you're ALLOWED TO, PEOPLE USUALLY DON'T.
this IS NOT A NEW SYMPTOM.
our PATIENT HAS SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY.
he HAS DOCUMENTED TROUBLE SWALLOWING.
the CHOKING'S NOT NEW.
so IT'S NOTHING'S NEW.
what CAUSED THE OLD?
strongyloides WORMS EXPLAIN THE FAINTING.
we ALREADY TREATED
so HE'S ALL BETTER, WOMAN...
WHO...THIRTEEN.
hasn't GOT ANY WORSE.
it's A PRETTY PASSIVE APPROACH FOR THE DAUGHTER OF AN ALCOHOLIC.
wrong AGAIN.
we COULD STRESS HIS SYSTEM.
put HIM ON A TILT TABLE.
if HE STAYS CONSCIOUS, MEANS WE MADE
the RIGHT DIAGNOSIS, AND WE WIN.
then WHY HAVEN'T YOU?
six AGAINST FOUR.
one OF THE MEN'S GONNA HAVE TO JOIN THE WOMEN'S TEAM.
on THE OTHER HAND,
one OF THE MEN ISN'T AN ACTUAL DOCTOR.
so, I GUESS IT'S PRETTY FAIR.
men, YOU'RE IN THE PENALTY BOX.
uh, WHO'S NOT THE DOCTOR?
I'm GLAD YOU ASKED ABOUT THAT.
reason I'M PENALIZING YOU
is TIME MANAGEMENT.
in DIAGNOSTICS, YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK.
the WOMEN CAME UP WITH A THEORY AND THEY TREATED THE PATIENT.
you GUYS JUST SAT AROUND IN A LAB, HOPING A SERIES OF BLIND TESTS WOULD GIVE YOU A THEORY.
you WASTED THE PATIENT'S TIME.
now I'M GONNA WASTE YOURS.
her GUMS ARE TURNING YELLOW.
whatever IT IS, IT'S IN HER LIVER NOW.
we WERE WRONG.
we're GONNA KEEP BEING WRONG, UNTIL WE'RE RIGHT.
or TILL SHE DIES.
Yeah, THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.
look, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
it DOESN'T HURT TO BE REMINDED
that WE'RE DEALING WITH REAL STAKES HERE.
liver FAILURE IS A BAD THING, BUT IT'S ALSO A CLUE.
what DOES IT TELL US?
I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE.
I THINK YOU'RE STILL SUICIDAL.
I WASN'T TRYING TO OFF MYSELF.
no, THAT'S RIGHT.
you WERE JUST TRYING TO KILL A WALL.
I CHECK THIS BOX, AND YOUR NEXT ROOMMATES
are GONNA BE JESUS AND CRAZY MCLOONYBIN.
that GUY NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
it's GONNA SOUND STUPID.
suddenly YOU'RE SHY?
you POOPED YOUR PANTS IN FRONT OF ME.
it's ONE OF THE NASTY SIDE EFFECTS OF DYING.
last SATURDAY, I GOT IN A CAR CRASH.
a DRUNK DRIVER CAME OVER THE LINE AND HIT ME HEAD ON.
it WAS LIKE SLOW MOTION.
I SAW THESE HEADLIGHTS,
and...
I SAW...
the PARAMEDICS SAID I WAS TECHNICALLY DEAD
for 97 SECONDS.
it WAS THE BEST 97 SECONDS OF MY LIFE.
okay, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
your OXYGEN-DEPRIVED BRAIN WAS SHUTTING DOWN.
a FLOOD OF ENDORPHINS AND SEROTONIN WAS RELEASED
and IT'S WHAT GAVE YOU THE VISIONS.
no.
believe ME.
it WASN'T CHEMICALS.
I've DONE EVERY HALLUCINOGENIC THERE IS.
this WAS WAY BIGGER THAN THAT.
there's SOMETHING OUT THERE.
something MORE.
Hey, CAN I HAVE MY KNIFE BACK?
no.
who THE HELL ISN'T A DOCTOR?
house SAID WE CAN'T TALK.
he MEANT WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE CASE.
house IS JUST JERKING US AROUND.
it's WHAT HE DOES.
you're NOT CURIOUS?
only ONE REASON
you WOULDN'T BE CURIOUS.
we SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE CASE.
he's PUNISHING US FOR WASTING TIME.
maybe WE SHOULDN'T BE WASTING THIS TIME.
close THAT DOOR.
you're GONNA GET US ALL FIRED.
we NEED TO FIND A LINK BETWEEN FAINTING AND TROUBLE SWALLOWING.
we NEED TO KNOW IF IT'S DYSPHAGIA
or FULL BLOWN ACHALASIA.
PARAGANGLIOMA.
how WOULD A NEOPLASTIC GROWTH IN HIS ABDOMEN EXPLAIN
not HIS ABDOMEN, IN HIS NECK.
a CAROTID BODY TUMOR CAUSES TROUBLE SWALLOWING.
food PRESSES AGAINST THE VAGUS NERVE,
and CAUSES THE FAINTING.
so IF THIS GUY HAS CANCER,
we GET TO KEEP OUR JOBS?
if HE'S HEALTHY, WE'RE FIRED?
we NEED A CT TO PROVE IT.
we NEED THE WOMEN NOT TO FIGURE IT OUT WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE.
and DOES HOUSE'S COMPUTER
have A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE?
there IS A POTENTIAL TOXICITY
in THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT. [door opens]
I WAS NEVER HERE.
blood PRESSURE'S REMAINING STABLE THROUGH 60 DEGREES.
no PAUSES ON HIS EKG, NO NAUSEA.
our TREATMENT WORKED.
I NEED OUR PATIENT.
SYNCOPE'S CURED, AMBER. IT'S OVER.
you OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T STRESSED
the SYSTEM HARD ENOUGH.
you CRANK IT UP HIGH ENOUGH, ANYONE WILL PASS OUT.
this IS INCREDIBLE.
this IS THE MOST I'VE MOVED IN 20 YEARS.
the TILT TABLE TEST SHOWED THAT THE PATIENT'S EKG,
bpm PULSE REMAINED NORMAL DESPITE
who ARE YOU, THIRTEEN?
my NAME'S IN THE FILE.
tells ME MORE ABOUT YOU THAN ANSWERS COULD.
no, IT DOESN'T.
we TURNED THE THING UP TO 95 DEGREES
you DON'T THINK THAT NON-ANSWERS TELL ME ANYTHING?
sure, JUST NOT AS MUCH AS ACTUAL ANSWERS.
that's WHY THEY'RE CALLED ANSWERS.
tells ME YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.
tells YOU I'M HIDING EVERYTHING.
tells ME YOU GOT SOMETHING WORTH HIDING.
is IT TURKISH PRISON?
gay PORN?
you KILLED A MAN,
just BECAUSE HE WAS ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS?
can I FINISH REPORTING ON THE PATIENT?
no NEED.
I'll SEE YOU IN AN HOUR OR SO.
got TO SET SOME STUFF UP.
thank YOU ALL FOR COMING...
to TRIBAL COUNCIL.
a MAN OF YOUR INTEGRITY I FEEL I CAN TRUST.
big LOVE.
and I DON'T CALL YOU THAT
because YOU'RE A MORMON.
Where's YOUR TEAM'S SIXTH MAN?
she WENT ROGUE.
broke THE RULES.
you ALSO SINNED.
you HAVE NO RIGHT TO CAST THE FIRST STONE.
and ATHEISTS HAVE NO RIGHT
to QUOTE SCRIPTURE.
the RULES SAID NO TALKING.
I TOLD THEM NOT TO TALK.
out LOUD.
we WERE TRYING TO SAVE A MAN'S LIFE.
key WORD BEING "TRYING."
tilt TABLE TEST CONFIRMED
that YOU GUYS WERE WRONG.
you're FIRED.
Ah, THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNETH.
you're ALSO FIRED.
we THOUGHT THERE WAS A TUMOR ON THE PATIENT'S ESOPHAGUS.
we WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE AREA,
wrong ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS.
turns OUT THE ESOPHAGUS IS JUST STRAIGHTENING.
it's SCLERODERMA.
explains THE SYNCOPE AND THE CHOKING.
he NEEDS STEROIDS.
you DID A CT SCAN?
obviously.
after YOU WERE ALREADY PROVEN WRONG?
good FOR YOU.
it's TOO BAD YOU'RE WRONG.
straightening INDICATES WEAKENING, NOT HARDENING.
SMA EXPLAINS THE WEAKENING.
strongyloides INFECTION EXPLAINS EVERYTHING ELSE.
you LADIES HAVE THE HONOR
to GIVE THE PATIENT A FEEDING TUBE, DISCHARGE HIM, AND SHOW UP FOR WORK TOMORROW.
the REST OF YOU, YOU'RE A DISAPPOINTMENT.
you MAKE ME WANT TO STOP DANGLING.
it WAS THE BEST TWO WEEKS OF MY LIFE.
I THINK I WILL MISS YOU MOST OF ALL,
ridiculously OLD FRAUD.
do YOU THINK HOUSE COULD BE WRONG?
I THOUGHT HE FIRED YOU.
no. HE FIRED THE MEN.
I DON'T THINK HE'S WRONG.
if HE IS, HOW WOULD I PROVE IT?
I JUST SAID I DON'T THINK HE IS.
well, THINKING ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
you HAVE TO RUN A BLOOD TEST FOR ANTICENTROMERE ANTIBODIES.
would YOU MIND RUNNING THE LABS?
you CAN'T. WELL, I CAN, BUT
no. I WAS MAKING A STATEMENT.
you've BEEN FIRED,
so YOU NO LONGER HAVE LAB PRIVILEGES.
you WEREN'T COMING HERE FOR ADVICE,
you WERE COMING HERE TO CON A FAVOR TO SAVE YOUR JOB.
sorry.
I'm NOT WORKING FOR HIM ANYMORE,
but HE CAN STILL MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE.
and YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE HIS LIFE MISERABLE.
I'm INSULTED.
you CON CAMERON
by APPEALING TO HER HUMANITY.
I TOLD HER WHAT SHE WANTED TO HEAR.
and YOU TOLD ME WHAT YOU THOUGHT
if IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I WANTED TO HEAR.
I THINK YOUR MOTIVES ARE MORE INTERESTING.
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE FIRED YOU.
go DRAW HIS BLOOD.
I'll MEET YOU IN THE LAB WHEN I'M DONE HERE.
guess YOU DIDN'T FIND YOUR TUMOR.
the OTHER DOCTORS TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE FINE?
Yeah.
they SAID IT WAS JUST MY DISEASE GETTING WORSE.
you COME TO TERMS WITH THIS DISEASE.
you KNOW IT'S THERE.
you KNOW IT'S WAITING.
and EVERY NOW AND AGAIN...
it TAKES SOMETHING AWAY.
took MY WALKING.
took MY MODESTY.
now IT'S TAKING ONE OF MY LAST PLEASURES.
well, THERE'S AN OUTSIDE SHOT
that SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE SMA'S CAUSING YOUR EATING PROBLEMS.
and IF IT IS, WE CAN FIX IT.
and REMOVE THAT TUBE.
is THAT MY BLOOD?
it's GREEN.
what DOES THAT MEAN?
it MEANS I'M NOT FIRED.
is HE A VULCAN?
if NO, WHAT MAKES NIMOY BLEED GREEN?
are WE OFFICIALLY UNFIRED?
how DO WE KNOW SHE DIDN'T FAKE THE GREEN BLOOD?
because THAT WOULD BE STUPID.
and WHILE SHE MAY BE MANIPULATIVE,
borderline EVIL, SHALLOW
they GET IT. I'M NOT STUPID.
what CONTRAST DID YOU USE FOR THE CT?
icm. HIS KIDNEYS AREN'T WORKING.
they DIDN'T FILTER THE CONTRAST,
which IN ICM IS GREEN.
ten POINTS.
okay, LET'S ADD KIDNEY FAILURE
to OUR LIST OF SYMPTOMS.
what ARE THESE POINTS?
is THAT HOW YOU'RE DECIDING WHO TO FIRE?
I'm GONNA FIRE THE NEXT PERSON WHO ASKS ME
who I'M GOING TO FIRE.
now WE'RE ON THE POINT SYSTEM?
what HAPPENED TO MEN AGAINST WOMEN?
forget THE GAME.
what DO YOU MEAN FORGET THE GAME?
I MEAN FORGET THE DAMN GAME!
the GUY'S KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.
we NEED TO DIAGNOSE EXACTLY
I THOUGHT WE WERE DIAGNOSING. YOU WERE DIAGNOSING.
now I AM TOO.
I THOUGHT THAT THIRTEEN WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE STRONGYLOIDES.
I WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG.
okay, KIDNEY FAILURE, ASPIRATION, FAINTING, GO.
kidney FAILURE COULD BE THE RESULT OF A GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA.
our PATIENT WEARS A CATHETER FULL TIME.
it VIRTUALLY GUARANTEES
bacterial INFECTION.
which COULD HAVE MIGRATED UP TO HIS KIDNEYS.
infection STRESSES HIS ALREADY WEAKENED SYSTEM,
makes HIS SMA WORSE.
that EXPLAINS THE CHOKING AND FAINTING.
put HIM ON AN IV AMP AND GENT.
our TEAM'S SCLERODERMA DIAGNOSIS STILL HOLDS.
the TESTS COULD HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE
because THE BLOOD WAS TAINTED WITH CONTRAST.
do A SKIN BIOPSY.
get A SIDE OF LYMPH NODE TO CONFIRM.
I COULD HAVE YOU FIRED.
you ALREADY HAD ME FIRED.
just PROVES THAN I CAN.
and WERE THE MEN WRONG?
no.
it DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT-- WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?
because PERFORMING TESTS FOR SOMEONE WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR IN THIS HOSPITAL
you're FRUSTRATED.
you WANT HELP? I'M HERE.
if YOU JUST NEED TO VENT, LEAVE A MESSAGE.
I LIKE HIM BETTER LIKE THIS.
you?
patient DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA.
his LUNGS ARE FILLING FAST.
we STARTED HIM ON ANTIBIOTICS. NOTHING.
we WERE WRONG.
and YOU'RE HERE TO SAY...?
we WERE WRONG TOO.
he DOESN'T HAVE SCLERODERMA.
biopsy REVEALED NO FIBROTIC CHANGES.
cervical LYMPH NODE HAS BLACK FLECKS.
small AREAS OF NECROSIS. IT'S NOTHING.
you SAY NOTHING. I SAY CANCER.
it's A BIT OF A STRETCH TO JUMP RIGHT TO CANCER. I'M NOT JUMPING.
broad SPECS HAVEN'T WORKED, SO IT'S NOT BACTERIAL.
failing LIVER DESPITE TREATMENT
suggests IT'S NOT FUNGAL.
and HER HIGH LACTIC ACIDOSIS
points TOWARDS ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.
also SUGGESTS INFECTION,
which IS A LOT EASIER AND SAFER TO TREAT.
large CELL LYMPHOMA IS INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE.
she'll BE DEAD IN A WEEK IF WE FOLLOW THE TEXTBOOKS.
unless IT'S INFECTION,
in WHICH CASE YOU RADIATE HER
and SHE'LL BE DEAD IN A DAY.
I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THAT.
I've SEEN DOCTORS DO THIS BEFORE.
go BACK TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
if YOU'RE RIGHT THIS TIME,
you PURGE YOURSELF OF PAST GHOSTS.
I KNOW IT'S CONTRARY TO PROTOCOL,
but I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY
ghosts ARE THERE FOR A REASON.
so YOU DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.
switch OVER TO THIRD-GENERATION CEPHALOSPORIN.
you WANT TO REMOVE HIS EYE?
who TOLD YOU?
you BOOKED THE O. R.
good.
you CAN'T BEAT ME IN A FOOT RACE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE DANCING.
cervical LYMPH NODE IS A GARBAGE DUMP.
very SMALL ONE.
just ONE TRUCK COMES IN AND ONLY COMES FROM ONE HOME.
al GORE WOULD BE APPALLED.
the HOME-- THE HOME IS THE RIGHT EYE.
I GET IT.
do A BIOPSY.
on MY WAY.
you're NOT DOING A BIOPSY.
you ORDERED AN ORBITAL EXENTERATION.
right.
because I DON'T WANT TO REMOVE
a LITTLE TINY PIECE, SIT IN THE LAB
and CONFIRM WHAT I ALREADY KNOW,
while MY PATIENT DROWNS IN HIS OWN FLUID.
but IF YOU WANT ME TO, I ABSOLUTELY WILL.
how ADVANCED IS THE PNEUMONIA?
it's TAKING COLLEGE COURSES.
[Yelling] HEY, WILSON,
I'm GONNA CUT SOME CRIPPLE'S EYE OUT.
wanna COME WATCH?
good TIMES.
we GOOD TO GO?
I THOUGHT MELANOMA WAS SKIN CANCER.
technically IT'S CANCER OF THE PIGMENT CELLS.
the SAME CELLS THAT GIVE YOUR IRIS ITS COLOR.
cancer?
why NOT? WHAT ELSE CAN GOD THROW AT ME?
hail, LOCUSTS,
smiting OF THE FIRST BORN.
of COURSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW EVIL YOU'VE BEEN.
if IT'S CANCER, IT'S SPREAD EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?
so IT'S IN MY LUNGS,
my KIDNEYS?
there IS A CHANCE BY REMOVING THE EYE,
get THE PRIMARY TUMOR, AND THREE COURSES OF RADIATION,
that COULD-- COULD...WHAT?
few MONTHS?
years?
more LIKELY MONTHS.
any OF YOUR OTHER DOCTORS HAVE ANY CHEERIER DIAGNOSES?
if THEY DO, THEY'RE WRONG.
this IS THE ANSWER.
it's THE ONLY WAY TO HELP YOU.
I ALREADY CAN'T WALK.
I CAN'T EAT.
you're TELLING ME THAT THE REST OF MY LIFE
is IN THIS BED, PUKING AND IN PAIN?
we CAN MANAGE THE PAIN.
I'd RATHER JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.
I've BEEN TRAPPED IN THIS USELESS BODY LONG ENOUGH.
it'd BE NICE TO FINALLY GET OUT.
get OUT AND GO WHERE?
you THINK YOU'RE GONNA SPROUT WINGS, AND START FLYING AROUND WITH THE OTHER ANGELS?
don't BE AN IDIOT.
there IS NO AFTER, THERE'S JUST THIS.
you CAN'T LET A DYING MAN TAKE SOLACE IN HIS BELIEFS?
his BELIEFS ARE STUPID.
everybody LIES.
some FOR GOOD REASON, SOME FOR BAD,
this WOULD HAVE BEEN A FANTASTIC REASON TO LIE.
Hi, GREG HOUSE.
why CAN'T YOU JUST LET HIM HAVE HIS FAIRY TALE?
if IT GIVES HIM COMFORT TO IMAGINE BEACHES,
and LOVED ONES, AND LIFE OUTSIDE A WHEEL CHAIR
are THERE 72 VIRGINS TOO?
it's OVER.
he's GOT DAYS, MAYBE HOURS LEFT.
what PAIN DOES IT CAUSE YOU IF HE SPENDS THAT TIME WITH A PEACEFUL SMILE?
what SICK PLEASURE DO YOU GET IN MAKING DAMN SURE HE'S FILLED WITH FEAR AND DREAD?
he SHOULDN'T BE MAKING A DECISION BASED ON A LIE.
misery's BETTER THAN NOTHING.
you DON'T KNOW THERE'S NOTHING. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE.
Oh, GOD.
I AM TIRED OF THAT ARGUMENT.
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO DETROIT TO KNOW THAT IT SMELLS.
Yes, DETROIT, THE AFTERLIFE.
same THING.
you're NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN,
so WE'RE INSERTING A TUBE
directly INTO YOUR LUNGS.
it SHOULD HELP US DRAIN SOME OF THIS EXCESS FLUID.
it SHOULD MAKE YOU A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE.
SATs ARE STILL DROPPING.
fluid's CLEAR.
if THIS WAS CANCER, THERE SHOULD BE BLOOD.
call HOUSE. [beeping]
he JUST PAGED ME.
maybe IT WAS... JUST AN ACCIDENT.
it WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
you THINK HIS NIHILISM GOT THE BEST OF HIM?
he TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF?
he PAGED ME. PAGED YOU?
why YOU?
I ASSUME BECAUSE-- DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.
don't FALL INTO THAT TRAP.
is HE OKAY?
burned HIS HAND PRETTY GOOD.
his HEART STOPPED FOR NEARLY A MINUTE.
your COHORT MANAGED TO RESTART IT.
but HE...
has NOT REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
so...
since I HAVE YOU ALL HERE,
we SHOULD PROBABLY TALK ABOUT YOUR ACTUAL PATIENT.
clear FLUID FROM THE LUNGS INDICATES THAT IT'S PROBABLY
not CANCER.
so IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD COME UP
with A NEW IDEA.
you're AN IDIOT.
you NEARLY KILLED YOURSELF.
that WAS THE WHOLE IDEA.
you WANTED TO KILL YOURSELF?
I WANTED TO NEARLY KILL MYSELF.
is HE...
better? NO.
but HE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.
we THINK IT MIGHT BE EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA.
maybe YOU DIDN'T WANNA DIE,
but YOU DIDN'T CARE IF YOU LIVED.
you INSISTED THAT I NEEDED TO SEE FOR MYSELF.
was HE DISCHARGED?
no. HE'S DYING.
you've ALREADY HAD TWO NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES.
not THAT GUY.
the GUY IN THE CAR ACCIDENT, WITH THE KNIFE.
I...I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
he DIED ALMOST AN HOUR AGO.
apparently IT'S BAD TO ELECTROCUTE YOURSELF
within DAYS OF SUFFERING MASSIVE INTERNAL INJURIES.
why DID YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM?
did YOU SEE SOMETHING?
eosinophilic PNEUMONIA.
what DID YOU SEE?
nothing. WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?
nothing YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,
or NOTHING
which ONE IS BRENNAN?
is HE THE RIDICULOUSLY OLD GUY?
house, YOU GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
if IT'S AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH,
it MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN PAST THE STEROIDS.
start HIM ON CYCLOPHOSAMIDE.
I ALREADY DID.
just LOOKING AT YOU HURTS.
I'm GONNA ORDER UP SOME EXTRA PAIN MEDS.
I LOVE YOU.
how FAST WILL THIS WORK?
new MEDS SHOULD START HELPING IN MINUTES, OKAY?
hang IN THERE.
VACUTAINER'S FULL.
I NEED TO REPLACE IT.
I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK...
it's WORKING.
try AND RELAX.
you MUST...YOU MUST BE WRONG.
stop TALKING.
hurry UP AND GET THAT CHEST TUBE WORKING.
okay, I GOT IT.
could YOU GET...
Hoover?
I CAN'T...
can YOU...
put MY HAND...
on HIS HEAD?
it's OKAY.
don't WORRY.
I'm NOT SCARED.
Oh, GOD.
time OF DEATH?
you're LOOKING BETTER.
stark's DEAD.
what ARE YOU DOING?
going TO SEE OUR PATIENT.
he's DEAD.
dead IS NOT A DIAGNOSIS.
you REALLY SHOULDN'T BE
shut UP AND GIVE ME MY CANE.
I ASSUME WE'RE ALL FIRED.
should I FIRE MYSELF TOO?
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRONGYLOIDES,
then I THOUGHT IT WAS CANCER.
a LITTLE HELP HERE.
ready? ONE, TWO...
why DID YOU CALL ME?
because IF I POOPED MYSELF IN FRONT OF WILSON,
I'd NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.
but WHY NOT ONE OF THE OTHERS?
you ALWAYS HAVE THAT PHONE IN YOUR HAND.
we ALL HAVE CELL PHONES. THAT'S NOT THE REASON.
what IS?
if I DIED, YOU'D NEVER GET THE JOB.
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
you DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE
has ANY REASON TO CARE?
think THIS IS STARTING TO COME BACK TO ME.
it's RIGHT, LEFT, THEN REPEAT.
Yeah, THAT WORKS.
what DID WE MISS?
if WE KNEW, HE WOULDN'T BE DEAD.
that's IT?
you're JUST GONNA GIVE UP?
no, WE WERE DEFEATED.
it's OVER.
patient PRESENTED WITH SYNCOPE.
we THOUGHT IT WAS THREAD WORMS, GAVE HIM IVERMECTIN.
thank YOU.
he SEEMED BETTER, TILL HIS BLOOD TURNED GREEN.
can WE AT LEAST REMOVE THE BODY BEFORE LAUNCHING INTO A PURELY ACADEMIC EXERCISE?
patient DIDN'T RESPOND TO ANTIBIOTICS OR STEROIDS.
you OKAY, BOY?
what's WRONG WITH THE DOG?
he's DEAD.
there ARE ONLY
a HANDFUL OF VIRUSES THAT CAN CROSS BETWEEN DOGS AND HUMANS.
but THEY MAY NOT BE CONNECTED AT ALL.
the DOG WAS OLD.
I've SEEN IT BEFORE.
they HANG ON WAY PAST THEIR NORMAL LIFE EXPECTANCY TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR MASTERS.
did YOU WATCH HIM TAKE THE PILLS?
the IVERMECTIN.
did YOU WATCH THE PATIENT
put THEM IN HIS MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM?
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK SO.
what KIND OF DOG IS THAT? ENGLISH SHEPHERD.
it's IN THE COLLIE FAMILY, RIGHT?
not REALLY. THEY SHARE THE MDR1 GENE.
Yeah.
what HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE A DOG WITH THE MDR1 GENE IVERMECTIN?
they DON'T...
I MEAN,
it's USED TO TREAT HEARTWORMS IN MOST DOGS, BUT IT'D BE FATAL
if THE
look FAMILIAR?
I THINK THE LAST TIME YOU SAW IT,
it DIDN'T HAVE THAT DEAD DOG'S TEETH MARKS ON IT.
I JUST PUT IT ON THE BED TRAY TO GET HIM SOME WATER.
when I ASKED YOU IF YOU WATCHED THE PATIENT
swallow THE PILLS, THE RIGHT ANSWER WAS "NO."
take HIS BODY DOWN TO THE MORGUE.
if YOU HADN'T TREATED THIS PATIENT AS A GAME,
he WOULDN'T BE DEAD.
I'm FEELING MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU.
I'm SUPPOSED TO SHOW YOU SYMPATHY?
he DIED WHILE HIS ATTENDING WAS LYING ON A HOSPITAL BED,
because HE STUCK A KNIFE IN A WALL SOCKET.
he DIED BECAUSE A DOCTOR MADE A MISTAKE.
she WAS AN IDIOT.
you EMPLOYED HER.
you're RESPONSIBLE.
doctor FOREMAN.
how's SHE DOING?
fever's GONE.
A. S.T. AND A. L.T. ARE BACK WITHIN NORMAL RANGE.
she SHOULD BE OUT OF HERE IN A FEW DAYS.
gutsy CALL.
Thanks.
it WASN'T A COMPLIMENT.
if YOU WERE WRONG, SHE'D BE DEAD.
I WAS SURE
no, YOU WEREN'T. YOU COULDN'T BE.
there's A REASON WE HAVE RULES.
if EVERY DOCTOR DID
whatever HIS GUT TOLD HIM WAS RIGHT,
we'd HAVE A LOT MORE DEAD BODIES TO DEAL WITH.
it WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
Yes, IT WILL.
because YOU CONFUSE SAVING HER LIFE WITH DOING THE RIGHT THING.
I'm SORRY DR. FOREMAN, YOU'RE FIRED.
as SOON AS THE PATHOLOGIST CUT INTO THE LUNGS,
we SAW THE THREADWORMS.
you THINK IT'S FAIR
that I FIRED ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR TEAM
when YOU GUYS ACTUALLY CAME UP
with THE RIGHT DIAGNOSIS?
I KEEP REPLAYING IT IN MY MIND.
did I DROP THE PILLS WHEN I PUT THEM ON THE BED TRAY?
did I KNOCK THEM OVER WHEN I TURNED TO LEAVE?
you KNOW HE'D BE ALIVE.
his DOG WOULD BE ALIVE.
I KNOW.
you FORCED US TO ACT ON A FALSE ASSUMPTION.
I KNOW.
everything WE BUILT
from THAT STEP ON...
every TEST, EVERY THEORY, EVERY TREATMENT
I KNOW.
forget THE LECTUREY.
if I WAS GONNA FIRE YOU,
I WOULDN'T BE GIVING YOU THE LECTURE.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
I'll SEE YOU TOMORROW.
I'm SORRY TO SAY "I TOLD YOU SO."
whoever thought walking in a circle at two miles an hour would be draining?
fresh air, exercise.
you know, some things do have their negative sides.
our income just got cut in half.
and we get to spend twice as much time together.
more, if you don't leave before your lunch hour's over.
out of my way.
we have a legal right to hold you up for 15 seconds.
one.
just trying to do my job.
Hey, relax, three more seconds, and you can go.
are you telling me what to do?
it's okay.
just take a breath.
get the hell off me.
I think it's been 15.
you okay?
Oh, my god, Jeff!
this place is a mess.
welcome to a world without nurses.
here, you can start with these.
it's not my fault. I didn't lose nurses.
Cuddy was looking for you. Said she'd send you down here.
I know, that's why I'm here.
because Cuddy hasn't found you yet.
she's gonna look everywhere except the place she wants me to be.
Hey. - I've got an aortic dissection here.
what's with the idiot?
fainting spell and recent history of dysgeusia.
everything tastes like lemon meringue pie.
you want to take him?
no.
sir.
why do you have two lunches in front of you?
been here for two meals.
and you're happy with that?
no, I just don't see much use in complaining.
Seriously?
it's a very useful tool.
complain, you make people miserable.
they do what you want to make the misery go away.
you probably should say something.
maybe I can call one of the doctors I work with
they're doing their best.
what the hell?
I'm sure it was an accident.
is he canadian?
uh, he's a low priority...
is that a yes?
he's just... happy.
I gotta stop this before it spreads.
you guys are done.
this could be a metabolic disorder, toxic exposure, carcinoma of the tongue metastasized the brain, epilepsy, M.S.
or it could be the flu, and we should all be back in the ER no, you're ignoring the big symptom.
what if we're looking at both the flu and decent parenting?
okay, you two are perfectly healthy.
this guy wasn't pandering.
he wasn't vanilla nice.
he was nice without any aspiration, personal gain.
I'm thinking genetic defect.
niceness is a defect?
three cavemen see a stranger running towards them with a spear.
one fights, one flees, one smiles and invites him over for fondue.
that last guy didn't last long enough to procreate.
and how long has the patient been suffering?
at least as long as his wife has known him.
11 years.
the chances of him having an undiagnosed pathology for that long -
what are you saying?
that evolution is wrong?
where do you think we are, 21st-century America?
he's saying that statistics are true too.
the world is a bell curve.
most of us fall within the standard deviation, but there are outliers, and if we believe in the existence of extreme jerkiness, which I suspect that we do...
then we also have to accept the existence of the opposite extreme.
you want it to be a symptom because then we're supposed to be jerks, which means you don't even have to try to be nice.
okay. Maybe I'm biased.
let's take a vote.
who thinks that niceness is not a symptom?
and who thinks that their vote counts?
you two, check out his home for toxins.
Taub and thirty-one... - thirty-one?
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you.
Taub and thirteen, mri for tumors and eeg for nerve damage.
test whatever comes out of him for everything else.
too much axis tilt.
don't release until your thumb's at the bottom of the ball.
I assume Wilson was busy.
again.
no axis tilt.
with amber?
again.
still, it was nice of you to invite me.
this is fun.
no, it wasn't.
no, it isn't.
I didn't invite you to be nice.
I invited you because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves.
what's the second thing?
other hand.
if people are incapable of being nice, why bother having the word?
the ontological proof of niceness.
the existence of the word proves the existence of the concept.
look out for those minotaurs on your drive home.
and I thought motives didn't matter.
only results mattered.
so what are you gonna do to screw up wilson's relationship so you don't have to listen to me while you bowl?
I wish the best for them and their tragically deformed children.
well, she's good at being bad.
you might not be able to destroy her.
as long as I give it my best shot.
I'm gonna hold my head high.
cameron had this one insufferable friend.
she wasn't gonna get rid of her, and I sure wasn't gonna join 'em.
so I just said,"see her on thursdays.
I know it's not as exciting as an exploding birthday cake, but, hell, I don't want to hang out with her every night anyway.
that's amazing.
cameron only has one insufferable friend?
joint custody.
of Wilson?
unless we have another love child.
deal with him.
he needs a mother figure.
I'm not saying you're not entitled to spend time with him.
I'm just saying I'm entitled too.
I don't know how to deal with him when he's being reasonable.
this is reasonable?
this is crazy.
you're not a child.
you can make your own plans.
no, crazy is what house would normally do in this situation swap your lubricant with superglue.
the man knows me.
this is his way of accepting us.
it's actually a very touching moment.
I'm proposing I get every other day and every other weekend.
I have yoga wednesdays. You can have him then.
but you have to have him home by 11: 00.
we can swap weekends.
Mondays and wednesdays, and midnight.
if he's not home till midnight, we won't be asleep till almost 2: 00.
Wilson, make a ruling.
no.
you two are like dogs circling eh other in the park.
and I say that with all the love in the world.
you need to sniff each other's butts, bare your teeth, and arrive at some strange detente.
otherwise, you'll end up biting each other's eyes out.
again, with all the love in the world.
I'll let you sniff first.
take my deal, or get out of my apartment.
take my deal, or I move in.
this guy worked for habitat for humanity in costa rica.
and coaches handicapped kids.
you think we should do a work-up on the other coaches?
it is possible he's too perfect.
I'm not saying he's perfect.
I'm saying he's trying to be.
that's what people do.
what?
that's not what people do.
people usually suck, but they want to be good, want to be nice.
house?
exception that proves the rule.
what sort of argument is that?
a bad one.
that might be relevant.
hydrofluoric acid.
lowers his calcium, causes the fainting and taste issue.
but not the niceness.
wouldn't that be nice?
you are king solomon.
if you want us to cut him in half, we're cool with that.
my boyfriend's too much of a wuss to make the call for himself -
and I mean that with all the love in the world.
I'm gonna piss off one of them, and they both scare me.
your treatment of patients is reprehensible.
you're reading his performance review?
I'm busy.
we have a nurses' strike.
your management of employees borders on abuse.
let's go.
no, why-- I want to hear it.
you are overtly contemptuous of hospital hierarchy.
and covertly.
I suppose you didn't know about that.
your attitude towards supervisory personnel "is disrespectful, "and a disturbingly large proportion of your comments are racist or sexist.
that top makes you look like an Afghani prostitute.
would be an example of that.
sign this.
house. I got the-- - it can wait.
I will sign, if you will give us a ruling.
I will give you a ruling, if you do the reviews on your team.
I'd be happy to continue the mockery of this process.
What'd you offer him?
Wednesdays till 11: 00 and alternate weekends.
Wednesdays till 11: 00 and alternate weekends.
Yes.
wednesday nights are ladies' nights at cheetah's.
Calcium's normal.
wow, It really could wait.
everything's normal.
and you thought it wouldn't be.
he's a carpet cleaner. He's got a home full of hydrofluoric acid.
that doesn't mean his calcium should be low.
Yeah, it actually kinda does. Hf causes lower levels
Lower,not low.
lower than normal. - Lower than yesterday.
yesterday might have been high.
what's lower than high?
he actually has hypercalcemia, which is being lowered to normal by the hf.
so what gives us elevated calcium, bad taste, and fainting?
I take it you know?
get the team.
this is gonna be fun.
Hello, again.
these people think you are not too nice.
too nice? For what?
for life as we know it to have evolved without an intelligent designer.
I'm going to prove them wrong.
your wife is very ugly.
get out of here.
he's obviously trying to prove a point.
I think I just did.
you're either perfect or you're sick.
in my experience, sick is much more common.
he's not sick.
he's nice.
nice in the sense that your toaster is nice for making you breakfast.
it's the only thing his wiring will let him do.
he has williams syndrome.
your husband is missing the genes that make him suspicious.
you're wrong. He's relax, there's no cure.
he's gonna go right on tasting lemon meringue pie, fainting, and being a sap.
what about the other symptoms?
he has no other symptoms.
but williams does.
he's got teeth, glasses.
williams cuts iq by 20
he doesn't work in the physics department.
except when they spill a black hole on their carpet.
elfin appearance?
Yeah, he's more legolas than keebler, but I bet you he can still crack off a tch of pecan sandies.
perfect pitch?
you love to karaoke, right?
I suck.
modest. Another symptom.
no, he really does suck.
give us a warble.
you know any cher?
no. But I know bread.
baby, I'm-a want you baby, I'm-a need you you're the only one I care enough to hurt about
what's the matter?
he's stroking.
not a moment too soon.
you were wrong.
why do people say that with such pleasure?
it's very hurtful, you know.
it means the patient gets to keep being nice.
why does that offend you?
it's the way he said it.
he wasn't relieved, he was excited.
he was also wrong.
and I say that with no sense of pleasure.
patient tested negative for williams, which means the stroke and everything else wasn't caused -
you have a friendly demeanor, but you sometimes get too involved.
you relate well to your peers and patients.
and you complete tasks in a timely manner.
please sign.
what the hell was that?
I have to give each of you performance reviews.
plenty of other conditions can cause debilitating niceness.
how is that supposed to help him?
I don't know.
how's it supposed to help Wilson?
cross out Wilson's name and the date, and then fill in your own name.
the point of a review is to give feedback to help.
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.
wouldn't show up on the mri without contrast.
I'll go run the tests.
he doesn't think it's syphilis, but he's gonna go run those tests anyway.
because he doesn't know.
that's why we do tests.
because he's a wimp.
because he's afraid of you.
you want me to intimate him into not being afraid?
not sure I know how to do that.
reviews make a difference. People have to listen, so they have to learn.
I don't think that the right time to tell the dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.
you don't want to do the paperwork.
I am concerned about the rainforest.
I'll do it.
I know.
I don't have syphilis.
you don't know.
how many ways are there to get it?
you can know who you had sex with. You can't know who she
I do.
not for sure.
it's a waste of time.
I had a stroke.
you can't keep wasting time.
we were tested for the peace corps.
ten years ago.
you haven't been with your wife every minute of every day.
you think I'm naive, don't you?
I think you're--yeah.
I know my wife.
she's not perfect.
I'm not perfect.
but she loves me.
and she's always loved me.
every minute, every day.
you're 15 minutes late.
have you heard the good news?
Miley cyrus is playing a third night at the spectrum?
happiness is possible.
and not just in this life, but in the next
Oh, you're selling religion.
I'm sorry, I bought some islam yesterday.
well, it's where your light shows signs before mending
have a good evening.
you're late. - 15 minutes.
16 minutes, my 16 minutes.
so keep him an extra 16 minutes.
you hear that? She doesn't care.
you're going mini-golfing. What's it matter?
you got a tee off time?
it matters because you don't get to decide what matters.
it was my fault. I had to take a shower.
which was my fault.
I had to take a dump.
anything else I don't need to know before you leave?
have fun on your play date.
you've got mommy's numbers, right?
daddy needs a drink.
I was thinking, if we discount the niceness issue
sit down.
I think it's a heart defect.
nothing on the echo.
could bea patent foramen ovale.
it explains the stroke, and the syncope, and a pfo wouldn't show up on a routine echo.
I'm gonna do a bubble test.
you got a minute first?
sure.
I think you've shown remarkable strength in a difficult situation.
are you giving me a performance review?
a good one.
I'm gonna do a bubble test.
there was enough blood left over from his admission work-up to run the vdrl.
you doubted your patient.
no, what I thought didn't matter.
house said he wouldn't let us go on until we ruled out neurosyphilis.
it's not neurosyphilis;it's a pfo.
it's neurosyphilis.
the tests were positive.
it's always the same conversation.
they tell you you must be mistaken, which is why I always run the tests twice, and then they blame the other guy, which makes sense if they're innocent, but obviously, half of 'em aren't.
they don't seem to get that they're busted.
scientifically proven.
unless your spouse cheated too.
exactly. That's what you're praying for in that moment.
that she cheated too.
and then if she doesn't kill you, you know that she did.
you know she betrayed you.
and then, you realize that that sucks worse.
the test must be wrong.
I ran it twice.
not that test.
the one I took ten years ago.
what other explanation is there?
he really sees no other possibility.
did you have an affair?
no.
then why aren't you angry with him?
you ever know anybody who's just too nice? - No.
it's annoying--then you realize it's annoying because they remind you of what you are not.
that you'll never be as good as they are.
and then you think, why can't I?
and before you know it, that naive idiot you laughed at has made you a better person.
you really think I've been in love all these years with a symptom?
if syphilis caused lesions in his brain, and the lesions caused personality changes, you may notice a change in him as his condition improves.
I know my husband.
he's not gonna change.
you should get yourself tested.
so much for the bell curve.
how can House be an ass without it being an illness, but niceness is a biological crime?
you got five bucks?
uh, yeah.
niceness just cost you five bucks.
being an ass generally turns a profit.
Kutner, could you excuse us?
I need to do taub's review.
you can stay.
I think it would be better if this was done privately.
this isn't gonna be done.
what is it with you guys? I've given you advice before.
not as our boss.
what's the difference? Advice is advice.
fair enough.
I'll go first.
you demonstrate a great air of confidence, which is really pissing me off.
house authorized me-- - how long have you known him? He's using you.
I volunteered because I knew he wouldn't.
he could care less about the paperwork.
he's using you to screw with you.
he knows it'll annoy us.
we'll stand up to you, which will force you to confront the fact that even though you think you're our superior, you're no different from us.
he gave you authority to keep you in your place.
it's true.
Thanks.
not him, what'd he say?
nothing, what's true?
there's something wrong with this guy, it means there's something wrong with House.
are you trying to get me drunk?
what time is it?
she'll kill you.
I'll get you home before lights out.
great. Then she'll kill me.
if I get...if I get any more drunk, then I'm
it...Might not work.
if you, uh, know what I mean.
Really?
you'd think that one or more of your ex-wives would have mentioned that to me.
they told you?
wait.
why do you want to get amber angry?
because I'm your friend.
no, no, no. You said you approved, you said you were taking-the high road.
for how long, the first exit?
Hello, and thank you for saving me from being righteoused to death.
patient's vomiting blood.
hematemesis could indicate... don't put it on the board.
you don't think it's a symptom?
I think it's my marker.
he has syph. And what?
and syph, it can cause hematemesis.
not everyone agrees.
How...how could you...
because if you all thought it was just syph, you wouldn't have woken me upin the middle of the night.
if it was just syph, he wouldn't be getting worse.
he's already on penicillin.
bleeding's probably from liver damage, probably caused by ethanol in the cleansers or the penicillin.
two more probablys than I like to hear.
liver tests and serologies are gonna take a full day.
full night, actually.
guy not might make it to brunch.
Yes, I knew about your issue with alcohol.
Yes, I intentionally got you drunk to provoke an argument between you and Amber.
why I would do such a thing is an interesting question.
what's more interesting is that you knew as much as I did and you're the one who's pouring down the drinks.
Why?
because I thought I was out having fun with a friend.
I didn't know the drinks had subtext.
I gotta get home.
Ggt's normal.
rules out alcohol.
how about serum protein?
it's positive.
kinda assumed he had protein.
it's how much protein he has we care about.
it's positive for syphilis.
you mind if I give you a performance review?
not the patient.
he has syphilis.
what happened?
every time I searched my soul...
I found anna.
are you gonna tell Marie?
I have to.
it will destroy her.
could it be any worse on her than loving somebody who can't love them back?
yes?
you might want to turn off the tv.
I'm multi-tasking.
also doing my taxes.
and Cuddy.
What'd you find out?
the patient has hepatitis.
I assume from your omission of the word 'viral' before the hep that it's not another std.
put him on steroids and test him for sarcoid before the liver failure becomes liver failed.
we're all doing this.
there's more?
you have syphilis.
no, I don't.
one of us found a vial of your blood in the lab... - which one of you?
it's treatable we filled a prescription.
you okay?
so this is why he is who he is.
we don't know.
we know.
it's not just a coincidence.
Wilson says he's always been a jerk.
but he got worse.
after his leg.
the leg was a coincidence.
did you sleep with him?
so what's gonna happen?
what's gonna change?
maybe he'll be less of a jerk.
or less of a doctor.
you gotta be a jerk to be a good doctor?
I don't know. Maybe House does.
why aren't you answering me?
because it's none of their business.
it's none of your business.
I think the std makes it my business.
humans are complicated.
humans are simple.
a million different things make us who we are.
you change one, you change everything.
if Mozart was better adjusted, decides to play catch one day, maybe there's no magic flute.
you did, didn't you?
there's something I need to tell you.
you returned him drunk.
on time.
drunk.
on time. No tag backs.
the purpose of the time was to give me time.
so you didn't have sex?
I like sex.
then you can have it tonight.
the L word is on.
you don't get to decide what matters.
either you're genuinely afraid I'm gonna make him miserable, or you're afraid I'm gonna make him happy, or you simply can't stop screwing with anything that moves -
it doesn't really matter because whatever the reason, you'll only get worse.
until either I stop seeing Wilson, or I stop you.
what do you think I'm gonna choose?
if you terminate the agreement, it's not gonna bring peace in the mideast.
I'm not terminating the agreement.
I'm amending the agreement.
I'm adding penalty clauses.
fine.
whoever violates it gets their finger cut off.
I'm serious.
so am I.
you want people to drive safer, take out the airbags and attach a machete pointing at their neck.
no one will drive over three miles per hour.
I'm not cutting... we'll figure it out.
on your time.
you know she's certifiable, right?
I got the forms in my desk.
where is she wrong?
what were you gonna tell me?
nothing.
you're punishing me?
I needed to tell you something privately.
I'm not gonna tell her.
you'll tell her.
she's your girlfriend.
you should tell her.
you're my friend.
it's not the same.
don't sulk.
where am I wrong?
your management style is counterproductive.
you gave me authority over the team, just so they could undercut critiquing the clap-addled?
that's sort of tasteless.
I didn't feel like waiting until your genitals cleared up.
you need to formalize my authority over the team.
no, I don't.
you don't think I'm qualified?
compared to those three?
you wanna punish Cuddy for hiring me without
I like Cuddy. I like parts of her.
you wanna crush the team by crushing me?
I want to empower them.
those three idiots need to respect you.
they should respect you.
they should be afraid of you.
so I have to humiliate you.
cause if the team fears you, they won't question you;
if they don't question you, they won't get any answers;
if they don't get any answers, they're useless.
mocking me saves lives?
the hospital will probably build you a statue one day.
you know, with a "kick me" sign on the back.
so when you think about it, the more I mock you, the more it shows I have respect for you.
or you made up that B. S. because you like humiliating me.
wouldn't rule that out completely.
you busy?
almost done.
uh, so just remember, the rabbit goes around the tree and jumps down the hole.
negative for sarcoidosis.
run him for everything you can think of.
Lepto, schisto, hemo, and the fourth marx brother nobody ever heard of.
you bitch!
I just went to get us some lunch, you were asleep.
you moved my book.
Jeff. Calm down.
it's just the drugs.
the drugs didn't move my book
my husband's having a heart attack... can somebody help me, please?
somebody help me, please!
she saved his life.
or she scabbed.
depends on your point of view.
so what do we think?
new symptom?
or just a wife beater?
Hey.
time for you to take this baby for a spin.
we, uh, loaded him full of prednisone to try to fix the liver.
good news is, he's running out of organs to fail.
prednisone could cause 'roid rage, which could cause hypertension, which results roid rage after six hours?
at that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us.
uh, it still could be penicillin.
allergic reaction.
how does a fried liver put him into a rage?
it's not frying his liver, it's frying hisyphilis.
the penicillin's working.
the real patient is emerging, so syphilis prevents domestic violence.
I'm gonna be more attractive to the ladies.
I was gonna test for a heart issue before the syphilis.
PFO could explain the heart attack and reduced blood flow to the brain could explain the rage.
well, all good ideas.
okay, let's take a vote.
how many think it's the 'roids talking?
and who's for the penicillin?
and how about whatever she said?
someone hasn't raised their hand.
whatever I decide?
you're setting me up.
why would I do that?
PFO.
the pfos have it.
I just hope the bubble test is positive.
or it's no more Mr. nice guy.
we gave Van Gogh chelation therapy.
turned him into a house painter.
maybe not.
maybe we just put Hitler on ritalin.
are you comparing House to Hitler?
Oh god.
just because I don't think he's Hitler doesn't mean I slept with him.
I don't sleep with everyone who's better than Hitler.
maybe Taub is right.
maybe this is good.
this is not good.
well, he respected our opinions, he mockedhimself, he was civil, he shared.
he didn't care.
he never cares.
he didn't vote.
he always cared about one thing.
solving the puzzle.
but he was irrelevant to that diagnosis.
he had no opinion of his own.
he now cares about nothing.
you had no choice;you had to treat him.
what's done is done.
you know that thing I was gonna tell you, I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell someone.
you've got to swear not to tell C. B.
whatever.
well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging.
it's actually the opposite of swearing.
I won't tell Amber.
my team thinks that I have syphilis.
do you?
not yet.
why do they think you do?
because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something.
why would you swap your blood? What are you afraid they'll find?
shut up, you're missing the point.
now, they think that I'm on penicillin.
is this some clever practical joke that I'm not aware of?
and as I get better, I get nicer.
that's brilliant.
foreman thinks I actually value his opinion.
thank god he said pfo, or I'd have had to do some dancing.
you got time for bowling?
come on, it's work hours.
I'll get my shoes.
so we don't need to talk about-- - no.
you're gonna keep screwing-- - yeah.
you're gonna keep talking about it. We are who we are.
I'll get my shoes.
okay, got a good view of the heart.
what if we lower house's dosage?
maybe stabilize him, he doesn't get worse, he doesn't get better.
quite the line to walk.
if we're wrong, he dies of neurosyphilis.
if we don't, other people die.
other people who aren't our boss.
people.
this sucks. The guy had a gift.
I'd kill
Hi, what-- - house doesn't have syphilis.
he switched the blood samples.
how do you know that?
house told Wilson.
I wanted to ruin House's day.
see ya.
we're idiots. - We're not idiots.
positive blood test means positive blood test.
apparently not.
there they are, let's see if they
uh, what are you doing? We're not done.
he doesn't have syphilis.
I know.
patient tested positive for syphilis, right?
is this some sort of recap?
but why did he test positive for syphilis?
Oh, I know this.
either, one: He has syphilis
I was gonna say that.
or two: The test was wrong twice, or three, he gave us someone else's blood.
who?
get that idiotic smile out of my face.
I gotta go on a killing spree.
or, four, he has something that tests positive for syphilis.
it's not chagas.
he worked in costa rica before he was married.
is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too?
chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.
I've heard of remote tribes that actually practice acts of kindness.
or the chagas caused encephalitis.
the mri showed no sign
until we started him on steroids, compromised the immune system, and let the infection flare up.
I did another one.
it's not much.
it's plenty.
you figured this out because I don't have syphilis?
damn.
that should have been my epiphany.
good news, bad news.
good news is we know what you have, it's treatable, you're gonna live.
Really?
what's the bad news?
the cure is a grueling course of pills.
it's like one a day for a month.
now you're just trying to make me laugh.
Yeah, like that's a challenge.
you have chagas disease.
it's a parasite.
it's been asymptomatic for ten years.
not quite. Your brain's been swollen--not enough to see, but enough to alter your personality.
now we're back to that.
he screamed at you.
you don't think he could change?
that was because of the drugs.
so you think drugs are more powerful than parasites?
I mean, the ones we're gonna give you to treat the parasites obviously are -
I standby the principle.
I'm not worried.
neither am I.
neither am I.
but that's because I don't care.
reviews?
it was brought to my attention that on occasion,
I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy.
the word was "contemptuous.
Well-phrased, thoughtful.
identically phrased.
these are all the same.
because, underneath it all, we are all the same.
and Foreman refused to type his up.
well, it's more than I expected.
there's an extra one in there.
your treatment of patients is non-existent because you're not a doctor, you're an administrator.
foreman convinced me that these could be helpful.
your management of employees is, well, let's face it, they're outside carrying signs.
the strike ended.
the nurses have been back for two shifts already.
you'd think I'd have noticed.
what exactly did they do around here?
you act like employees "should fear and respect you, but your eyes tell us...
but your eyes tell us nothing "because we're looking at our boobs, "which tell us that you're desperate "to have someone jump on you and tell you they love you "one grunted syllable at a time.
what you want, you run away from.
what you need,"you don't have a clue.
what you've accomplished, makes you proud.
but you're still miserable.
please sign.
I got a call from Amber today.
says there's been a violation of your contract.
you've been seeing Wilson on her time.
she breached confidentiality.
you can let it slide, officer.
we're even.
Yes, you are.
you're both losing fingers.
look what I found.
nice.
they think you might be able to come home tomorrow.
Oh, yeah? That's good.
what's the matter?
the ketchup.
there's something wrong with that.
tastes fine.
anything else?
everything else is great.
I'm just...I don't know.
I guess I don't like ketchup anymore.
wonder what else I don't like.
roll over.
we need a tougher punishment.
come over to the poopy side.
where are you two going Friday night?
dinner at l'auberge.
you're lying.
of course I am.
Brock? What are you doing?
getting ready for surgery.
what's it look like?
you're operating on my sister.
and my fiancee.
you're drunk.
you could kill her.
it's the only way to stop my hands from shaking.
I need to drink... for Anna.
what about...our baby?
Our...baby?
Brock? Oh, my god!
Brock? Are you okay?
Brock, speak to me!
Oh, my god!
um, I--I think he's really hurt.
cut!
Oh...that was scary.
I thought for a second you were really -
you're gonna be the only one in the world who did.
this is ridiculous.
that was great, Evan.
no, it wasn't. It was crap.
the fans are gonna love it.
the fans are crap. I'm crap.
this whole damn show is crap!
sorry, not your fault.
um...where are you going?
my apartment's on the west side.
excuse me, you need to go the other way.
Hey, did you hear what I said?
what the hell's going on here?
what do you want?
an autographed picture would be nice.
Oh... and I'm also gonna save your life.
you might want to think about repositioning the crosswalk.
it's technically not a violation, but the closer they are to the entrance, the more likely they are to be used.
makes sense.
I actually wasn't expecting you till next month.
Yeah, that's the problem with planned visits.
administrators plan for them.
so the most recent new jersey hospital accreditation requirements.
Yeah, I'm familiar with -
who is that?
I have no idea.
shall we get started?
just let me go.
I won't press charges.
forget the whole thing.
that's probably true.
seeing as how you have a brain tumor.
you're that nut job doctor that keeps calling my publicist.
actually, I'm the nut job head of diagnostic medicine.
I run every day.
I don't get headaches. I'm fine.
so if you don't mind-- - actually, I do mind.
I don't care if you die, but if Brock Sterling dies, Anna never finds out he's the father of Marie's baby.
help!
help!
we're gonna need a wheelchair!
here.
look, in the last month, your average line reading has slowed from 2. 1 seconds to 2. 9.
you're pausing more.
always at the same intervals.
every seven to nine words.
which means you're having trouble reading one side of the teleprompter.
which means it's a peripheral vision problem.
which means a tumor in your occipital lobe.
just one test.
if there's nothing wrong, I'll take you right back home.
make it cab fare.
I don't want you anywhere near my house.
uh, just put it in my spot.
the accreditation board is here to protect us and our patients.
so in dealing with the on-site inspector, please behave as if it wasn't also an enormous pain in the ass.
thank you.
chase, Foreman, Cameron, up here, please.
why is House driving a limo?
don't know.
don't have to know.
Don't...care?
wrong! Until this inspection is over, you're back on House watch.
current case, past cases.
he doesn't have a current case.
I have a whole department.
are you gonna fire us if we don't?
I was just asking for your help.
the last time I checked the E. R.
you had the best-kept charts in the building.
the last time I checked the fourth floor janitor's closet, I found House's charts.
he hasn't filed anything since you left.
now, house may not care whether this hospital's accreditation gets downgraded.
the people who sign my paychecks do.
so I repeat, current, past.
he doesn't have a current case.
did he tell you about the limo?
so I just press this button every time I see a light?
it tells me where your blind spots are.
So...the twins.
they're gonna turn out to be yours, aren't they?
I told you I can't talk about that stuff.
but you want to be done with this, right?
one's mine, one's Julio's.
I knew it!
Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst-- you got her after.
how can you watch that stuff?
cause it's awesome.
it's preposterous.
not one real moment since I've been on the show.
as opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like...
I can't think of any.
what's going on?
the hospital is being inspected, and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me.
I just parked a town car in an ambulance bay.
and instead of ripping me one, Cuddy acted like she didn't know me.
it's either an inspection or an aneurysm.
what's the test say?
as I suspected.
you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field.
are you serious?
no, it's a joke.
two guys go into a bar, and one has significant losses in the upper right quadrant of his visual field.
and the other one says,"you're gonna need an mri to confirm the type and location of the tumor.
that readout says his vision's fine.
no, it doesn't.
Yes, it does.
you lied to me?
I kidnapped you.
you're surprised that I lied to you?
it just means that the symptoms are intermittent.
yo come near me again, I'm calling the police.
you kidnapped him?
it's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.
are you mocking me?
my back. My back is killing me.
don't care. Busy.
Amber's damn mattress.
well, that sucks.
don't buy a new one.
are you being sarcastic?
because we are buying one.
she's incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.
we're buying a mattress for us.
wow, I'm faster than you right now.
it's all about her and whatever hapless salesman wanders into her sights.
she's gonna lie, steal, and trade your testes to get whatever she wants.
hold on, I've just gotta do something before he dials the second "1.
you're going to end up humiliated, holding her purse, and going home to sleep on a new mattress you hate.
what the hell are you doing?
he needs an mri.
give me one-millimeter slices from the cortex down.
any particular reason you decided to sedate a patient for a procedure that's completely painless?
the guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.
Yeah, on tv.
it's evan greer.
he's the main stud on House's soap.
frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.
increase the magnification on the occipital lobe.
you watch because you like or because I like?
I was unemployed, and I
bzzzt! Sorry.
that's not an answer. That's an apology.
if we are ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud
occipital, frontal, temporal lobes are clean.
so is the optic nerve.
definitely no tumors.
he's fine?
And...awake.
uh, what should we tell him?
see if you can talk him out of suing me.
he kidnapped me!
he drugged me!
perhaps you should go out the back way.
I'm not going anywhere you people tell me to go.
it's just someone of your fame... I...I figured fans
you're trying to hide me.
you don't want me making a scene.
the hospital's being inspected today.
and you want me to do you a favor?
not us. Our dean of medicine.
and House hates her.
you'd be doing House a favor by complaining.
this hospital is staffed with lunatics and crimals!
excuse me, where's dr. Cuddy?
it's my foot.
what did he do to me?
what did House do?
Nothing--I was with him the whole time.
it's numb.
I can't feel it.
I can't walk.
foot numbness has a huge differential.
it gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision problems.
which gets a lot wider when there's no proof he ever had a vision problem.
so House was wrong about the first symptom, but the guy just happened to develop a second unrelated symptom a few hours later?
he already kidnapped and sedated the guy against his will.
makes sense he'd also do something to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.
but it doesn't make sense to include a symptom that he caused in a differential he's so desperate to solve.
unless he didn't mean to cause it.
stick to the filing, sweetheart.
let the doctors do the doctoring.
either toxins or vitamin deficiency.
I'm guessing when you drugged him you didn't catch him and ease him to the floor.
he ould've pinched a nerve in his ankle when he fell.
you need to run an emg test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass.
Kutner, leave the room.
wait 30 minutes. And come back and tell her the test was negative.
is it okay if I use that time to do the test?
get out of here.
and the rest of them can help me with all this stuff.
they're busy.
which is really annoying because I wanted to be able to say that they're busy for no other reason than to screw with you.
research.
so the nutjob was right.
usually is.
he said I was dying.
he's wrong a lot too.
that's why we do these tests.
I bet it's pretty cool, you know, being the star of a hit tv show.
it's a daytime soap.
it pretty much puts me one step above dinner theater.
come on. You're on tv every day.
and who cares what the critics think?
women love soaps.
you get to take pride in your job...
feel good when you go home at night.
you're entertaining people.
I don't care.
well, you've made a strange career choice.
look, I'm pandering.
I want to be a part of something that inspires people.
so quit.
find something inspiring and do it.
it's not that easy.
why not?
just isn't.
it's my heart, doctor.
it's racing.
I'm sure it's nothing.
you're a healthy woman, Marie.
shouldn't you examine me?
why don't you have Rico do it?
you can't tell me you didn't notice that pause.
sorry.
she's never waking up.
this is a whole new experience in super hi-def.
I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.
does sound a little forced.
could be stiffening in his tongue which is a symptom of myxedema.
that's not the tongue, it's the dialogue.
I think I dated that nurse though.
no.
what about the way he's holding that stethoscope?
his thumb and forefinger are meeting at an odd angle.
could be demyelination from toxic exposure.
back it up.
what's this, the av club?
it's diagnostic.
everything's under control.
Yeah.
excellent job so far.
house, outside.
keep watching.
you'll never guess what Rico's got in that box.
Rico doesn't even know I'm alive.
you have an obsession with an actor or the character he plays.
I feel for you.
you need to work it out.
but I need you to do it when the hospital's accreditation and my job are not on the line.
you want the star of the hottest daytime drama on tv to die in your hospital?
no, I want you to cure him without committing any more felonies.
I can't do my job if you're gonna tie my hands like that.
51 weeks out of the year, I let you run around like a monkey in a banana factory.
all I'm asking is that you tone it down for a few days.
I want that tv.
we're not bargaining.
you want something.
either you're bargaining or you're begging.
me keeping my job is good for you.
Yes, but it's better for you.
I just want us to be equally happy.
emg was negative for nerve entrapment.
means the foot's a real symptom.
could be vitamin deficiency.
or a toxin.
or atherosclerosis.
or a toxin.
why is toxin a better idea?
might not be.
we'll know after I'm finished searching his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff.
gotta go.
need a decision.
you're not gonna cut your own throat.
Yeah, that sounds like me.
test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins, and search the home.
I like the pillow top.
I like this one.
great taste. That model's top of the line.
how much is it?
$1, 999. It's a great price.
what about
that's too rich for us.
I don't know, you think...
honey, we can't afford that.
not with a baby on the way.
Congratulations. Your first?
Yes.
how about I knock 100 bucks off?
maybe throw in free delivery.
money's really tight right now.
I'm a law clerk and my husband just got laid off.
he has an interview today.
wish him luck.
good luck.
fingers crossed.
we might be able to afford $1, 500.
well, I-- I'd have to check with my manager.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
hold this, would you?
911 from work.
better go.
so am I getting the hard mattress, or do I have to go to my job interview?
whatever mattress you want.
I'm fine either way.
You--Really?
really.
just as long as I get to help you break it in.
pack your manhood on ice.
maybe the hospital can reattach it.
you were so wrong.
she's letting me choose.
you choose" does not mean "you choose.
Really? Sounded like you choose.
I suppose it's possible she meant House is so, so wrong.
it's a trap.
it means if you love me, you'll buy the one I want.
amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.
people who do aggressive don't like to limit themselves.
could a leaky space heater cause vision problems and numbness?
he'd have gotten better at the hospital.
it's not a trap.
did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?
house, look, she's-- - gotta go.
manager says I can do that price.
the gin bottles are all gifts from fans.
Brock Sterling drinks it on the show, but Evan doesn't drink at all.
he's on this whole health kick right now.
fruits, nuts...
did you take those from his dressing room?
no.
you're not gonna marry Brock, are you?
we've been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna.
are you really a doctor?
glioblastoma.
need more proof?
so no toxins on the set.
how about his regular life?
unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?
no. I've been out with him.
he's as vanilla as they come.
and by "out" you mean...
well, I asked him on a date last month.
we went out a few times, but we weren't right for each other.
too small or too large?
is that medically relevant?
I'm a doctor, and it's relevant to me, so yes.
we never got that far.
we made out a while, and then he just said he should go home.
he's a real gentleman.
now that'd be interesting.
he's impotent.
steady diet of sunflower seeds causes a b6 toxicity, which causes an autonomic dysregulation, which causes a wood-free existence.
one bad night and a couple of sunflower seeds, and he's got autonomic dysregulation?
it's more than just one.
he can't even remember the last time he was able to sale.
it's cool, huh?
b6 wouldn't show upon a tox screen.
and we didn't find anything at the house.
so all we have to do is filter the b6 out of his blood.
prep him for plasmapheresis.
just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't.
and can you find out where that voice keeps coming from?
and tell it to get out of my head.
the impotence could be psychological.
he's depressed. Hates his job.
plasmapheresis has risks.
we should have him spend the night in the sleep lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.
confirmation is for wimps and altar boys.
you don't need to wait for a reflex
if he can't get engorged the way god intended, he can't get engorged.
I'm not showing him my boobs.
lack of response to your chest tells us nothing.
thirteen, show him...
where can I find a decent set of knockers around here?
your porn's in the second drawer.
all set.
hear monitor, blood pressure monitor, and the one on his junk.
this is humiliating.
we're gonna close the blinds to give you some privacy.
the instruments will let us monitor your response.
I don't get this guy. He has the coolest gig ever, but he's miserable about it.
he probably figures quitting won't do him any good.
figures he'd be unhappy anywhere.
our circumstances affect whether you're pretty happy in this job, right?
sure.
have you ever had a job where you were miserable?
I once sold men's fragrances in a department store.
and were you miserable?
the pay was awful.
it was a miserable job, but you weren't miserable.
so what about you?
you happy?
not particularly.
heart rate and bp are climbing.
got some activity on the tumescence monitor too.
there's nothing wrong with his naughty.
it's not b6 toxicity.
did he just finish?
sometimes, uh, when you haven't, you know, for awhile, you...
his heart rate's through the roof.
220 and climbing.
he's headed for cardiac arrest.
we shocked his heart back into sinus rhythm.
he's stable, at least for now.
could be some sort of atypical septic reaction.
not without a fever.
thus the word atypical.
in that case, it could be an atypical bunion.
he used to smoke. Could be paraneoplastic syndrome caused by small cell lung cancer.
quit 20 years ago, and his calcium levels are normal.
could be graves disease.
extreme hyperthyroidism leads to systemic problems, including numbness, vision loss, and cardiac arrest.
you want to be here.
I have to be here.
just say the word, I'll fire thirteen.
just sign the forms.
smart move.
I was bluffing.
she's right.
we should fry the thyroid before it fries him.
um, I know it's more exciting this way, but shouldn't we confirm you're right before destroying one of the most important glands in his body?
if that gland has drawn a bull's-eye on his heart, then no.
nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer.
protocol says we should do an iodine uptake test.
we?
anyone else want to run a useless test, while Brock's thyroid plots its next lethal move?
it was rhetorical.
you were sure about b-6 toxicity too.
house is right.
Seriously?
I mean, I am, but you think so?
if he goes into full-on thyroidstorm, he'll die.
we gotta nuke his thyroid.
hang up the phone.
Why? If we're gonna nuke his thyroid
we're not nuking the guy's thyroid without proof that's it's graves.
do the iodine uptake test.
if House finds out
when house finds out.
we'll have the test results.
and we'll either do his procedure or we won't.
what are you doing here?
just grabbing a snack.
you keep food in the morgue?
if I keep it in the lounge, everyone else eats it.
that's 'causeit's everyone else's food.
Oh, I thought it was just everyone else's bags.
the accreditation board will light us on fire for this.
they're not gonna find out.
unless, of course, Conway planned on inspecting the morgue in, say, two minutes.
is that why you're here?
you're gonna get me fired over a sandwich?
no, over a tv.
and you're not gonna get fired because you're gonna fold.
no, I won't.
but you're gonna push it, so we need a safe word to signal your unconditional surrender.
call me sweet sauce.
Dr. House.
I don't think we've met.
Dr. Jamie Conway.
I've heard your name.
most people have.
it's also a noun.
I sometimes come down here to relax, unwind, maybe grab a
sweet sauce.
it's a nickname.
an ironic nickname.
wow, it is almost 2: 00.
aren't you supposed to be--?
Oh, yeah. Yeah,'cause those sick blind kids aren't gonna read to themselves.
see ya.
I recommend skipping c-26.
floater.
been in the river at least a week.
thanks for the warning.
any time.
doesn't the doctors' lounge have that same tv?
Nope, they've got a 12-inch exactly like the one that used to be in here.
files are done.
I'll be doing a dance of joy just as soon as my leg is healed.
can you tilt that down?
I know the paperwork annoys you, but patient records are important.
you can't just let them sit there.
I had to.
in the name of science.
I let the crap pile up, and then I see which team member is the most self-flagellating, breaks down, clears up the mess.
surprise was, it turned out to be you.
again.
you weren't even registered as a competitor.
you miss me.
you miss me.
you hired thirteen to replace
Yeah, all pretty girls are fungible.
you're avoiding.
I miss the job.
I miss running around playing private investigator.
I miss...the puzzles.
seriously, I'll fire thirteen.
or Kutner, if you think thirteen is hot.
I don't miss you.
that iodine left a really weird aftertaste.
that's the tracer in it.
we'll have the images in a couple of minutes.
you must do okay with women, huh?
I already asked him that.
And?
it's not all it's cracked up to be.
he feels unfulfilled.
I doubt it.
I'm lying?
I used to be a plastic surgeon.
I talk about my work as shallow and meaningless.
truth is, I loved every boob job, every tummy tuck.
meaning doesn't mean that much.
but you're not a plastic surgeon anymore.
it's complicated.
are you happier?
it's complicated.
his thyroid looks normal.
so that's good news, right?
everything look too bright to you?
it could be the monitor.
it's not the monitor.
it's the iodine.
it's everywhere.
his body's not filtering it.
his kidneys are failing.
I told you to nuke his thyroid.
it's a good thing we didn't.
kidney failure means it wasn't graves.
so your test screwed me and our patient's kidneys.
practically poisoned him with iodine.
which he could have handled easily if his kidneys were healthy.
all we did was reveal a new symptom.
usually, you're all for that.
must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that's put me off.
you were wrong.
so tell me to my face.
you never hesitated before.
the board's turned you into a coward.
I did it because it was the right thing to do.
you did it to pass an inspection.
does it matter?
kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition, which means that any of his other organs could be next.
we've already started dialysis.
we need to run anas for autoimmune.
you're right.
you and the team, go measure the ceilings.
excuse me?
accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling.
make sure we're in compliance.
there's nothing in our office that would be less
I don't mean us. I mean the whole hospital.
let's see how this baby handles.
what?
you bought the firm mattress.
I thought that's the one you wanted.
it was.
why would you do that?
because -
this is a trick question?
I left it up to you.
you were supposed to get the one you wanted.
I got the one you wanted because I love you.
no.
you did it because that's what you do.
with all your ex-wives, you did whatever they wanted because it was easier, and you ended up resenting them.
don't you dare do that to to me.
what, take care of you?
have you met me?
I can take care of me.
I need you to take care of you.
I have work to do.
you made it to page eight.
mysterious hospital visit for soap doc.
wow, I'll be sure to send my mom a copy.
they told me I have an autoimmune disease.
like lupus or sarcoidosis.
that's what we're here to find out.
you really as good as everyone seems to think you are?
are you really as miserable as everyone seems to think you are?
I just want to do something that matters.
nothing matters.
we're all just cockroaches.
wildebeests dying on the river bank.
nothing we do has any lasting meaning.
and you think I'm miserable.
if you're unhappy on the plane, jump out of it.
I want to, but...I can't.
hmm, that's the problem with metaphors.
they need interpretation.
jumping out of the plane is stupid.
well, what if I'm not in a plane?
what if I'm just in a place I don't want to be?
that's the other problem with metaphors.
Yes, what if you're actually in an ice cream truck and outside are candy and flowers and virgins?
you're on a plane.
we're all on planes.
life is dangerous and complicated.
and it's a long way down.
so you're afraid of change?
no, you're afraid to change.
you'd rather imagine that you can escape instead of actually try.
cause if you fail, then you've got nothing.
so you'll give up the chance of something real so that you can hold on to hope.
the thing is, hope is for sissies.
when I get outta here, I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.
I mean, how many guys get a second chance?
too many.
half the people I save don't deserve a second chance.
now that I've got mine, I'm gonna set things right.
I'm gonna start by being a better father to you.
and to your sister.
and to your other sister.
you realize you're reciting lines from last season.
we're gonna do all the things I promised.
just help me get out of this bed.
cooling blankets in here.
this guy's brain is about to boil.
do you know where you are?
what's your name?
Dr. Brock Sterling.
fever rules out auto-immune.
he's septic.
he's got a massive infection.
we've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics, but he slipped from delirium into a coma.
good news is last time Brock was in a coma he fathered two children.
we need to identify the infection and get him on more targeted meds fast.
what about pneumococcus?
causes heart problems and sepsis.
but not the neuropathies in his foot and eyes.
what about tetanus?
he got a tetanus booster last year.
Lyme disease?
he would've been sore all over.
there's 1, 000 infections that could've caused this.
we can start testing, but he'll be dead before the cultures grow.
unless it's a fungus.
we could see that under a microscope.
test for fungi, parasites, all creatures great and small.
where you going?
to lie down.
I need to think.
could be rat bite fever...
but his glands aren't swollen.
which one are you gonna get?
she told me to get the one I want.
so get it.
listeria explains the sepsis, possibly also the heart problem.
but not the numbness.
if the listeria caused encephalomyelitis, which then caused the numbness...
I want a waterbed.
I've always wanted one.
I know it's ridiculous. It's just
there's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water.
no mocking?
no freudian analysis of how the waterbed is really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?
I'm ignoring you because you make me sad.
he's on ampicillin, which means if it was listeria, he'd have shown some improvement.
no, it's a whole thing.
you need special sheets and insurance
who cares?
you wanted one your whole life.
you're a grown-up.
you can afford it. Stores sell them.
most adults don't go through life like you do, House, indulging our every whim.
you don't deserve to be happy.
and yet I am.
you?
Amber'll think it's stupid.
it is stupid.
live the dream, wilson.
it's not an infection.
it's an allergy.
that's why it's not responding to antibiotics.
this isn't a soap opera, House.
people don't just wake up from comas the second you give 'em drugs.
especially if we give him the wrong drugs.
what do the sts say?
it was negive for fungus and parasites, but that doesn't mean -
the more infections we rule out, the more likely it is that it's not an infection.
he has no history of allergies or asthma.
most importantly, none of his symptoms remotely resemble an allergic reaction.
allergens could trigger an allergic vasculitis.
that would explain the symptoms.
one in a million times.
septic infection always explains his symptoms.
but an infection is never resistant to every antibiotic.
no, infection is rarely resistant.
and allergy never responds to antibiotics.
never beats rarely.
QED, I win.
there were chrysanthemums in his dressing room.
my god, why didn't you say he'd been exposed to plant life.
chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.
it's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.
he has an infection.
if we give him steroids, we'll kill him.
he has an allergy.
if we don't give him steroids, we'll kill him.
not as fast.
fast enough.
you don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something.
and what we're doing right now isn't working.
100 milligrams methylprednisolone.
patients' names?
it's one patient.
you want to give one patient 100 milligrams?
that'll jump start a car.
perfect,'cause my patient's a '69 ford coma.
anything over 50 milligrams, I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.
it's protocol.
and the inspector's here.
I am 99% certain that she'll consent.
but for the sake of the 1% why don't I just
you're not allowed back here.
well, tell the inspector he can put it on my tab.
I didn't mean now.
100 milligrams of methylprednisolone is an overdose.
we were wrong about the infection.
he's suffering from a severe allergic reaction.
the team hasn't finished the test for allergy.
his symptoms don't
in rare cases
trust me, at the end of this conversation, I'm right.
then confirm it.
get a blood test.
what is it about this severe and deepening coma that makes you think we got time for protocol?
protocol has saved your patient from having his thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.
if you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
don't talk about protocol.
my job's on the line.
your job is on the line.
okay, here's what you do: You wait three minutes, then you call security.
by the time they get here and lock me up, I'll be done.
he gets to live.
your ass gets to be covered.
if he dies, let me know...
so I can pack my things.
last night it was so good
I felt like crying
I felt like crying last night though you looked so cold
I felt like smiling smiling when I'm dying last night looked so good
I felt like crying
I felt like crying last night though you looked so old
I felt like smiling smiling while I'm dying you left me cold you left me cold you left me cold you left me cold tests are negative.
patient's negative for all floral allergies.
I'm gonna restart the antibiotics.
if he's still alive.
ampicillin, two grams, iv.
Why?
the steroids worked.
house was right.
the test was negative.
he was still right.
it was an allergy.
to what?
thank you.
I was wrong.
you should've stopped me.
heard about house's patient.
bold move.
and you backed him.
he was right.
he wasn't even in the same neighborhood as right.
the patient's alive.
okay, the rules exist because 95% of the time for 95% of the people, they're the right thing to do.
and the other 5%?
have to live by the same rules.
because everybody thinks they're in that 5%.
what are you doing out here?
I can't sleep.
I hate the waterbed.
I actually kind of like it.
no, it's awful.
we're returning it tomorrow.
okay.
I'm glad you got it though.
me too.
I hope they'll take it back.
they will.
you promised me you'd stop drinking.
of course I'm drunk, Anna.
they told me you'd never wake up from that coma.
but how could you get engaged to my sister?
we fell in love.
what do you want from me, Anna?
I'm just a man.
and I'm just a woman.
and as thrilled as I am about the lady slipper being the best night club port lawrence has ever seen -
Hello?
don't hang up.
what was the verdict?
$200, 000 fine.
you should've been fired.
good night, House.
there are bubbles in his glass.
can't this wait until my patient is allergic to quinine.
and you got this from bubbles?
symptoms started two months ago.
it's also when brock started downing gin and tonics like a brit staving off malaria.
the gin was fake, the tonic was real.
and tonic water is loaded with quinine.
nice job.
you should've been fired.
I'm taking back the tv.
I saved his life.
that wasn't the deal.
the contract clearly stated no takesy backsies.
good night, House.
what are you wearing?
good night, House.
good night, Cuddy.
who picked this dump?
you suggested it.
I suggested you look into it.
sorry. The online reviews were obviously written by some geek in their own marketing department.
next time, call someone you know.
stop relying on a computer to do your job for you.
Brightsize apparel-- eight sexual harassment suitsin two years.
who asked for the meeting? - They did.
Patty Michener, president of Women's Majority.
and wow-- do you guys need me!
nine men.
no one thought it might be a good idea to put a suit on one of the gals from the steno pool to make it look like you give a damn?
we've made it a priorityto promote more women, but
well, from now on you have me standing beside you, which is good.
because your problem is a national problem.
with all due respect, miss michener,
I'd hardly call a few isolated incidents a national problem.
six out of ten victims never even report harassment.
this is bigger than just eight women.
that still only means 20.
not enough for you?
how many asses does your corporate policy allow you to grab?
tell you what you're gonna do.
you're gonna settle with anyone you haven't settled with.
you're gonna fire any manwho's even been accused.
somebody help me! Please help me. I can't get 'em off!
please help me! Help me, please! Somebody help me! Get 'em off.
you gonna call an ambulance, or are you just gonna sit there and stare?
help me, please!
Wilson's back. You gonna
he's been gone two months.
he can wait till I finish slaying a guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.
on a video game you stole from the pediatric ward?
on advice of counsel, I assert my privilege pursuant to the fifth.
when was the last time you talked to him?
uh, I think it was after...
when did his girlfriend die?
he wanted time alone.
I considered being a horrendous pain in the ass, but I didn't want to tread on your turf.
we got a case.
I've gotta remember to close the blinds.
just got a call from Patty Michener from women's majority, the women's rights
we know who she is.
I dated her.
well, not really dated her.
more metaphorically raped her by having a penis.
you did too.
her assistant flipped out.
ripped off her clothes in front of a room full of businessmen.
well, either she cracked under the whip, or she started to realize that her evolutionary purpose is to arouse men, not to castrate them.
send her to psychiatric.
anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal pain aren't psychiatric symptoms.
then it's the latter.
send her to my apartment.
I'll give it to Segal.
house actually wants a case, and you're saying no?
house has more important things to do.
sorry, can't help you.
you need a specialist to remove those kind of warts.
preferably one with experience spelunking.
hallucinations, possible memory loss.
tests show anemia, slow heart rate, and a stubborn refusal to shave her pits.
have you seen wilson?
Nope. But I have seen the patient's frequent flyer balance.
eastern europe, asia, third-world countries. Sometimes more than one a day.
no fever means it's not a tropical disease.
if it's not where she went, maybe it's the work hours.
could be amphetamine abuse.
she's probably popping them like breath mints.
you haven't been by his office?
is wilson hallucinating ants crawling all over him too?
tox screen's cleaner than the windows she won't do.
her job keeps her constantly on the road, probably living off of airline peanuts and diet soda.
severe b12 deficiency could cause all her symptoms.
why is everyone leaping to conclude a strong career woman's been made sick by her strong career?
it's not b12, it's an insulinoma in her pancreas.
it's making her hypoglycemic.
great. Now everyone knows.
you knew the patient had cancer?
is that what she said?
I thought she said, "I am suddenly and irrationally defending "the patient's strong career, "even though in reality "she's just a glorified grunt?
because I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay "not to have a life because I don't have a life.
because I was tested for huntington's, and my life span's been cut in half.
been waiting two months for her to say that.
hallucinations, anemia, bradycardia
Hypersegmented polys says that Taub's right.
pump her full of b12.
see how a strong career woman's been made sick by her strong career.
are you okay?
could be years before you see any symptoms.
why wouldn't you tell us?
I don't have huntington's.
are you lying to us...
because it's none of our business?
if it's none of your business, then I shouldn't have to answer these questions.
and I wouldn't have to, except House doesn't want to answer questions about Wilson.
he's deflecting his own problems onto me.
are you deflecting now?
time for a b12 cocktailand my life lesson.
no, Patty will do the hearing.
she just needs to be the lead off witness so
okay, I'll lock it down today.
I need you back in bed.
my boss has a big Beijing trip.
I've been planning it for months.
I was just tired and dehydrated and
ye, whenever I losesome shut-eye, I pound my legs, clawingat imaginary ant colonies.
you have a severe b12 deficiency. Get back in bed.
I'm sure your boss can do without you for a few days.
it's not about her. It's about me.
I want to be there. I want to matter.
Yeah, I mean, without you, who knows how much starch they'd put in her shirts?
I'm sorry, I'm sure your boss depends on you for
I need to get up.
no, you need to stay in bed. - Please, where's a bed pan?
Oh, my god, I'm sorry.
I just-- I just had a bowel movement.
it's okay, b12 deficiencycan cause sudden
that's not a bowel movement.
my patient is still fighting in the feminist trenches, but the war is over.
yesterday's slutsare today's empowered women.
today's sluts are celebrities. If that isn't progress
I'm leaving.
what, are you gonna take another two months?
boy, you're really milking this bereavement thing, aren't you?
I mean, good for you. Take all the time you need.
I'm resigning.
maybe moving out of new jersey. I don't know yet.
okay. That's an understandable reaction.
it's not a reaction. It's a decision.
I'm writing Cuddy my resignation right now.
I'm just back for the week to wrap up my clinical and administrative duties.
you of all people should know, this is bereavement 101. You think that a change of venue
well, that spares me decadesof psychoanalysis.
I'm not saying you're not in pain.
you're saying my pain's a cliche.
I'm saying that pain fades. - Did yours?
physical pain is different.
I'd rather have my leg chopped off.
you don't know that 'cause you haven't felt-- - neither have you.
Sorry--patient's gota rectal bleed. - Busy.
we need you to-- - actually, as you can see, I'm not busy.
it's just a euphemismfor "get the hell out of here.
this is your grief talking.
and, yeah, it is a bit textbook.
so before you give away all your possessions to the salvation army
my girlfriend's dead.
I'm glad you've read that book before. I haven't.
I'm late to meet dr. Olan to brief him on the cases I'm handing over.
Bye.
it doesn't bother you that House wouldn't take just two secondsto talk about the patient?
Wilson's dealing with a lot.
and our patient may be dying.
she was bleeding out her rear. We're looking up her rear.
you think we needed House's expertise to set us on this course?
her heart rate's slow--bleed should have made it faster.
and it can wait till after we know where it came from, and after he's done dealing with personal issues.
yeah? That the way it works around here?
we get cut slack while we deal with personal sues?
you're not the boss.
boss gets to make the rules. Boss gets to ignore
she's bleeding from... nowhere.
you did an endoscopy? - And a colonoscopy.
ct scan? - Ordered.
but it shouldn't show anything the endoscopy didn't.
we can't do a ct scan.
why not?
we don't need a ct scan. We don't need House.
stop grinning and talk.
one of the routine pre-procedure tests was positive.
which one?
the one that, if it's positive, would explaina hormone imbalance that could screw with heart rate and blood flow.
guess she does have a lifebeyond her career.
I'm pregnant?
you want me to call the father and let him know?
soon as you do some DNA testing, let me know.
must be hard to have a real relationship when
are you making excuses for me?
I'm just saying it's understandable.
you only have to understand something if it needs an explanation.
I have needs. I met my needs. End of explanation.
how recently were you... needy?
Oh, it's been two or three months, at least.
what? What is it?
nothing.
tell me.
it's actually nothing.
the ultrasound shows no trace of a baby at all.
positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy.
b12 deficit rectified, but her heart's slowing even more.
and a bleed should speed her heart rate.
house, this is the kind of case you love.
contradictions piling up left and right.
two false positive pregnancy tests, bradycardia, lower G. I.Bleed. Go.
Choriocarcinoma--would' vetriggered pregnancy hormones.
also would have shown on a sonogram.
immunoglobulin "a" deficiency.
no urinary bleed.
if she's had beta hcg injections, they can cross-react with...
keep going.
you're being an idiot.
you're gonna blow up your career.
and six months from now, when you've moved on from Amber to burnt Sienna, you're gonna be stuckin a mobile oncology truck in pewaukee, Wisconsin.
I'd need a flow chartto explain all the ways in which that wasridiculously insensitive.
you can't hide from misery.
this isn't your business.
my skull was cracked open trying to save her!
then we all need a little tea and sympathy.
I'm through discussing it.
uh, we have a patient.
who's obviously not going anywhere with a bloody rectum.
great to have you back.
actually, I'm
actually, he's about to thrust a tanto into the belly of his career.
I'm leaving the hospital.
I'm sorry, this is obviouslya terrible time-- - why are you leaving?
I just need a change of scenery.
buy a plant.
rectal bleeding, two positive pregnancy tests.
there's nothing we can do?
you could ask House to be a grown-up and respect my decision.
I respect things that deserve respect.
this decision, on the other hand, is a dog wearing a cape!
hallucinations. Heart won't respond
the patient tested positivefor pregnancy because the patient is pregnant.
Hey, who are you?
this is dr. House. He's too brilliant for introductions.
false positive.
you're too busy to be running a day care center in your abdomen.
false positive.
not to mention you should wait till at least 30 to punish that pleasure portal with a 7-pound tissue expander.
I'm 37. And I thought I wasn't pregnant.
37?
impressive.
too bad you're not passing on those genes.
does that look false to you?
you were looking in the wrong room.
it's more common when the egglands in the oven.
sometimes it winds upin the fallopian tubes.
in rare cases, it plummetsthrough the plumbing entirely.
it's using her intestine as a blood supply.
it caused the rectal bleed, and now...
junior miss steinem'sjunior must be pressing on her vagus nerve, slowing her heart to a crawl.
yank the fetus.
she survives the surgery, she'll be fine.
what if she wants to keep the baby?
she doesn't.
well, we can't take two seconds to discuss this?
I mean, fetuses have been transplanted before. Whole uteruses too.
just terminating the fetus when it's glued to her intestines is high-risk surgery.
saving it is a fantasy.
that was at least three seconds.
she's a 37-year-old woman who deserves
people get what they get.
it has nothing to do with what they deserve.
and this has nothing to do with her genitalia, and everything to do with your genetics.
you told me to get tested.
I didn't know it was gonna color your every medical opinion, every personal opinion.
you didn't think a death sentence would people die! You, Amber, everyone.
don't act like you just figured that out.
I gave you a diagnosis. You don't like it, there are exitson every floor.
I'm sorry to be so definitive about this.
I know you're still absorbing the news, but we have no choice.
remove the fetus. Absolutely.
I have no boyfriend, no husband.
I'm on the road with Patty all the time.
where do I sign?
you feel any tendernessback here?
no, not at all.
treating professional sports injuries now?
no, I'm not
familiar with the concept of sarcasm.
don't sweat it, it's new.
have you spoken to Wilson?
we'll get you an ekg. I'll be right back.
you want me to sleep with him to get him to stay?
I put the bisexual chick on that.
if you'd like to sit in, so to speak...
I spoke to him. - What'd you tell him?
I didn't tell him anything. I listened.
so you could feel good about doing nothing. You gotta tell him
I am not your errand girl. Best thing about leaving you
the two of you used to be together?
she dumped me when I lost the last 85 pounds.
said there was less of meto love.
grief means different things to different people.
case in point, means very little to you.
grief is newark. Okay, it's there. You can't avoid it.
the idea is to hold your nose, hope the traffic's not too bad, and get on to man hattan as quickly as possible, not to buy property.
you think that's facing up to things?
I'm not the one who's quitting.
cause you haven't lost anything.
but you have. Listen to you.
what did you do when your husband died?
I got a new job and I moved.
see how crappy that worked out?
separating the placenta from the wall of the large intestine.
sponge. Suction. We've got some bleeding.
bp's dropping. 90 systolic.
she's bleeding like hell. Clamp.
bp's still dropping.
amp of calciumhloride, fast!
still dropping. - Shut up!
squeeze her spleen.
we need to force some platelets out so her blood clots.
she's in weak shape. Spleen's friable. It could rupture.
she's stabilizing. Oozing's drying up.
I hate visitors day.
removing the fetus.
Bye.
you have to stop Wilson from committing career malpractice.
talk to him.
I already talked to him twice. He threw me out.
mocking him and insulting him-- let's see, yes, technically those are categories of conversation.
block his references to other hospitals.
tell him he can't hand off his cases until
talk to him. Deal with his grief.
talk to him about what he's going through.
that's a brilliant idea. I'll take him out for a beer.
that'll make up for the fact that Amber's in a pine box.
that there's randomness and chaos in the universe.
tell him you're sorry.
I didn't kill her.
you were drunk and
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk, she might never have been born. So
you called her up in the middle of the night.
she was on the bus because of you.
I didn't ask her to come out.
I wasn't driving the bus.
I wasn't driving the garbage truck that hit the bus.
and I did not prescribe her the flu meds that killed her.
Yes, I know, that's all true. But...
you really don't feel any sense of guilt?
you want to keep him, he needs to know he's not alone.
just tell him you feel like crap.
it'd be meaningless.
well, then, find some meaning.
and do something.
she's gota neurological problem.
surgical complication?
don't think so. She keeps on blinking.
her heart's not recovering either.
so the pregnancy was a coincidence.
pulse is down to 39. She's maxed out on atropine.
we're installing a pacing wire to...
avoid that. We need some help in here!
page House. - Already paged him.
page him again.
it's for you.
if I told you that I was sorry, would it change anything?
I wouldn't believe you.
if you believe me.
it's hard to imagine such a world.
I'm going home...
until you agree to stay at this hospital.
you can't be...that's blackmail.
and to do your job?
why not hold a gun to your own head?
your conscience bleeds more freely than my head.
text.
patient's in cardiac arrest. Ouchy.
you'd jeopardizea patient because of my-- - if it keeps you here.
your friendship matters more to me than this patient.
I've gotta do what's right for me.
you've gotta do what's right for you.
Yeah. But it comes easier for me.
where is he? Where is he?
status.
her heart's stabilized.
we have a pacing wire in her, but the bradycardiais not getting any better.
house is bluffing.
I called him three times. He's not picking up. What do you want us to do?
the same thing you'd do if he was here.
if he was here, we'd be asking him what to do.
what are the usual suspects? - There aren't any.
she had a vitamin deficiency, and we corrected it, an ectopic pregnancy, we removed it.
but her heart problem won't go away, and now something's wrongwith her brain.
I have complete confidence in you guys.
who wants to go service House so this patient can live?
we can do this without him.
maybe something happened during the surgery.
the surgery was on her bowel, not her brain.
anxiety, stroke, tourette's could all cause eye blinking.
and cause her heart to beat faster--it's slowing down.
M. S.If a lesion took out the sympathetic innervation of her heart, it'd explain the bradycardia and the blinking.
but not the vitamin deficiency or the ectopic pregnancy.
house would want a unifying theory.
house is gone, and so are those sptoms.
M. S.explains everything that's wrong with her right now.
start her on interfer on for M. S.
mind if I come in?
not at all. You mind if I leave?
I told you not to take that case specifically so you could deal with Wilson.
and the two ended updovetailing rather nicely, don't you think?
is this how you show your friendship...
by bludgeoning him with guilt?
because he's my friend, I know what works on him.
well, I can't let you walk away from a patient.
then fire me.
you're willing to risk your career, but you're not willing to say you're sorry.
I told him I'm sorry.
he didn't believe it.
well, make him believe it. - I don't believe it.
you don't want to believe it.
because if you tell Wilson how you actually feel about him, about what happened to Amber, about your part in what happened, and he walks out the door anyway
if you make yourself vulnerable for once in your nerve-deadening, emotionally obliterating
you're doing the same thing he is.
you're running away.
only he's not killing anyone in the process.
Where's dr. House?
he's not feeling well.
was M. S.his idea?
we work as a team.
you know how it is. Collaborative.
sometimes it's hard to tell where an idea comes from.
but you're not really a team.
you work for him.
and you work for Patty. I'm sure a lot of her ideas are actually
she would be fine without me.
I'd be nothing without her.
maybe if you just had the chance.
I'm--I'm sure you've learned a lot.
not everybody's created equal.
does dr. House think I have M. S?
Yes.
did you just shiver?
you're running a slight fever.
is that bad?
it means we were wrong about the M. S.
you had my cable dionnected!
well, that's quite a leap.
just because I happen to have a 31-person maintenance department
each of whom you've personally abused at some point
Why? Did you think I'm okay with letting someone die, but I'm gonna fold if I can't watch celebrity bowling?
that is not an unreasonable theory.
especially with only ten minutes till your favorite soap.
Oh, gee, is this the remote from the doctors' lounge?
this is your 911? Good-bye.
stop!
I'm with holding your salary history from every hospital in the tri-state area.
you go, girl.
and I'm permanently setting every tv in this building to the pottery channel unless you both sit down.
welcome to couples counseling.
it's not the surgery.
the timing fits.
the location doesn't, unless her brains are in her bowels.
if bacteria entered her blood stream, it could have caused an infection in her brain.
the surgery went fine. You were there, you saw.
Peptostreptococcus could explain the blinking and
no. You want to watch a grainy video and have an epiphany.
shut up.
you're making me miss House's mocking.
I know you told us it was none of our business, but if House thinks that your huntington's is affecting you, maybe it really
it's not, because I don't have
you're desperate to do this without him.
you're not trying to cure her.
you're trying to pve-- - stop the tape.
zoom in.
on the anastomosis, that little bump.
it's a hematoma.
a harmless pocket of blood, which is why Chase ignored it during the surgery.
could be a ganglioma, which is why Chase shouldn't have ignored it.
it's an abnormal growth of nerves, it could be causing all the patient's symptoms.
we have to open her up again. Get a piece of it.
so what do you want to tell us?
nothing. Nothing I say is gonna change anything.
you guys need to talk.
actually, you should just read the psych literature.
Repression's gaining a lot of fans.
what you don't face can't crush you.
talk to each other.
how you doing? Good?
fine, thanks.
Sit!
see, the two of you are friends.
look how you both-- - think you're an idiot.
we both also eat with forks.
that doesn't really prove-- - talk to him!
tell him how you feel about what he's doing.
I told him he's an idiot.
tell him what you think about him leaving.
I think he's an idiot. - You're an idiot. He's in pain.
and your response is just to emotionally blackmail him.
you told me what your position is on that one.
you're against it, right?
she hasn't told you in front of me.
she needs to prove she's on my side.
go to hell.
so much for that theory.
I'm sorry you lost Amber.
I cannot imagine what it is you're going through.
but it will not get better by you walking away from everyone that cares about you.
do you think Amber would want you to walk away?
nobody at this hospital even liked Amber.
same time next week?
you want me to do a second major surgery on a patient we almost lost during a first major surgery to see if she needs a third major surgery?
we need a piece of the ganglioma.
then you're talking about another patient.
yours doesn't have a ganglioma.
and if there is one and you missed it?
then you're talking about another surgeon.
I didn't miss anything.
but we're not talking about another videotape.
this one showed a bump. We need to biopsy.
a bump? Oh, yeah. My grandfather died of a bump.
she can't survive a second round of general anesthesia, let alone a third.
you'd do this for House. - Yeah.
then what do you suggest?
because the patient's got a high fever, a low heart rate, and a dim chance of survivalif we stand here like idiots.
then I suggest you don'tstand there like idiots.
how do you get coal out of a mountain when it's someone else's mountain?
if we don't have House, it doesn't mean we can't think like House.
but it does mean we don't have to talk like him.
you don't dig down. You go in from the side.
we insert a lighted scope through the rectum, move the intestine tillwe find the ganglioma, then push it to the surface.
where we see the light, we cut.
we'll make as small an incisionas we can.
but unfortunately, it'll be very painful.
after your surgery experience, we can't give you anesthesia.
can I talk to dr. House?
no. We can do this. We know what we're doing.
I don't mean to be insulting, but my former boss didn't insist on me coming here because of you or your former boss?
I've been replaced.
I'm sorry. You must be-- - I'm fine.
she has a big Beijing trip. Ton of work to do.
she can't just wait for me to get better.
we've been well-trained.
we'll take good care of you.
how can you let her treat you like a footstool?
the world needs flunkies.
don't say that. You're better than that.
I have no problem with it. Why do you?
because... life is short.
I mean, yours could've ended in that surgery.
you'd have never lived for yourself.
what kind of feminist--we can have anything.
no, we can't. We can aspire to anything.
but we don't get it just because we want it.
I would rather spend my life close to the birds than waste it wishing I had wings.
you're through the sigmoid, into the descending colon.
switching on the light.
advance toward the anastomosis.
that's it.
push the wall of the intestine toward the skin.
there, I see it.
don't look down.
scalpel.
so your last day is friday.
I'm gonna miss you.
you shouldn't go.
did House ask you to talk to me, or are you trying to save the patient? Because there'll always be
house asked me. - And you're doing it.
I told him to go to hell.
Thanks.
but I think he's right.
you think you're making a rational choice.
you think the worst is over. And then...
six months later you look back and you realize you didn't know what you were doing.
are you saying the pain doesn't go away?
it gets easier. Not in two months. Not in two years.
but no, it never really goes away.
being here--this building-- I was just in the lounge.
I kept staring at Amber's locker.
I saw a guy wearing a scarf this morning.
the color reminded me of his eyes.
we lived 500 milesfrom here.
I have to do something.
then do it.
but don't think it's the right choice, because...
there isn't one.
it's not a ganglioma.
the problem wasn't the surgery.
abnormally deposited proteins.
it's amyloidosis. That would explain the blinkingand the low heart rate.
only way to treat amyloidosis is to treat whatever's causing it.
it's not as if a lot of things cause amyloid.
rheumatoid arthritis.
familial mediterranean fever.
lymphoma.
well, we can't all be right.
but you can all be wrong.
the patient's joints don't hurt, abdominal pain went away when the fetus did, and no palpable lymph nodes.
got anything constructive to say?
sorry. Sorry.
um, she has lots and lotsof palpable lymph nodes, joint and abdominal pain.
she'll be better by dinner time.
if we don't find the cause of the amyloidosis, we never get her off that wire, she never walks out of this hospital.
but they, who needs House, hmm?
so glad we lost those training wheels.
you want me to make the call?
there seems to be some disagreement.
and this isn't just a pretext to pressure me into staying?
does it look like a pretext?
no.
she really is dying, isn't she?
inflammation, enlarged nuclei, some mitotic activity.
it could be lymphoma.
there are no palpable lymph nodes.
it makes it less likely, but it doesn'trule it out.
I'm an oncologist. I see cancer.
show it to an immunologist, they'll see autoimmune.
I already showed itto an immunologist.
we'll start her on chemo.
you should leave.
house doesn't want to lose his sidekick.
Cuddy doesn't want to lose her check on House.
no one's talking about what you want.
it's not that I want to.
want to, need to.
if there's any chance that being away from here will make your life even a little bit easier, do it.
that's what everyone else here would do.
don't expect anything to change too fast.
lymphoma was your idea?
Why?
I feel better.
sometimes just knowing you're being treated helps.
you've given me18 different treatments.
this is the first one that made me feel better.
I don't think it's psychological.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.
your choices are your choices.
you're not like me.
maybe you have wings.
I have huntington's chorea.
dozen years or so, my nervous system, my cognitive skills, even my emotional balance...
they'll all start to fray.
I won't be able to fly.
I won't be able to walk.
I won't be able to breathe.
and you want to make sure your life matters.
I don't want to just...
be tightening bolts and following instructions.
I want something to be different because of me.
I am.
not just 'cause you saved my life.
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.
running the finance division.
I mean, I don't knowif I'm gonna get it, but if I don't...
there are other foundations.
it's almost 4: 00.
soap time.
nurses' remote.
works in the doctors' lounge.
why do you think Wilson's leaving?
how many times do I have to use the word "idiot"?
and that's a good enough answe rfor you?
whenever anyone does anything out of the norm, you have to tell them what screwed-up process is really at work in their head.
that is why I locked the two of you in a room.
so you would say something stupid and insensitive, and maybe with a little bit of truth.
but you didn't.
so I can only assume that you don't want to know the reason.
you're afraid to know.
you're not listening to me, are you?
try it sometime. You'll see why.
you look 37.
I am 37.
you looked 27 last week.
unless I blacked out for ten years. Your skin
she's got lymphoma. The chemo's probably
stop the chemo.
she's getting better. Bradycardia's improving. We didn't need
she have bruising?
she was pounding her legs during the hallucinations.
it's not lymphoma.
Hey, don't-- no, no, no.
my bad. Thought no meant yes.
those aren't bruises. They're mycobacterial lesions.
she has diffuse lepromatous leprosy.
must have caught it on one of her overseas estrogen tours.
chemo wipes out some of the bacteria, she feels a little better.
wipes out mostof her immune system, she gets a whole lot worse.
leprosy? Like where my limbs fall off?
actually, this is the flattering one.
it's also known as "pretty leprosy.
it doesn't disfigure, it makes your skin look younger, smoother.
don't let the girls hear.
they'll all want to lick your face.
unless you're that kind of feminist.
blast her with antibioticsand prednisone. She'll be fine.
damn, it's after 4: 00. I'm late.
damn. - What?
she's happy you're gonna be fine.
but she'd be happier if you were gonna be fine five minutes ago.
tests confirmed dr. House's diagnosis.
thank god.
when you got pregnant, the physical stress triggered E.Nodosum leprosum.
a common complication of leprosy.
inflamed the nerves to your heart.
made it hard to absorb vitamins, scarred your fallopian tubes.
it explains everything.
better prescribe me some skin cream too, huh?
you might want it for those job interviews.
I'm going back on the road with Patty. My replacement flamed out.
she says I can manage some projects on my own, carve out more of a role.
do you really think she can change?
I don't know. The truth is, I'm not sure I
you can change.
no...
I'm not sure I want her to change.
she's reasonable. She's just another employer, and I'm just...
another employee.
in a weird way, I matter.
I like you better now that you're dying.
I was wrong.
you took a shot.
she's going back to work for that idiot.
it's pathetic.
you thought something would change?
she almost died because of that job. Yeah, I--I thought
almost dying changes nothing.
dying changes everything.
I'm sorry.
I know I didn't try to kill her.
I know I didn't want her hurt.
I know it was a freak accident.
but I feel like crap, and she's dead because of me.
I don't blame you.
I wanted to. I tried to.
I must have reviewed Amber's case file 100 times to find a way.
but it wasn't your fault.
then we're okay?
I mean, I know you're not, but...
maybe I can help.
we're not okay.
amber was never the reason I was leaving.
I didn't want to tell you because
because I was trying, like I always do, to protect you.
which is the problem.
you spread misery because you can't feel anything else.
you manipulate people because you can't handle any kind of real relationship.
and I've enabled it. For years.
the games, the binges, the middle-of-the-nightphone calls.
I should have been the one on the bus, not
you should have en alone on the bus.
if I've learned anything from Amber, it's that I have to take care of myself.
we're not friends anymore, House.
I'm not sure we ever were.
bring it up about six more feet.
okay, you can go ahead and start dropping it.
class is over.
what's going on? Who are you?
I'm a doctor.
did you have a corneal transplant five years ago?
Yes.
every other patient who had a transplanted organ from that donor is either dead or dying.
you got a purse?
I feel fine.
I don't mean to scare you, but so did the others.
four fully dead.
nothing in common except their donor.
Carl got a new heart and lung.
liver kills him.
Tibalt got a new liver, lung killed him.
Holly got a new kidney, her heart blows up.
and Frank, the old guy gasping for breath upstairs, he got an intestinal graft, his pancreas is failing.
all within eight months of each other.
and in each case, serious complications came on suddenly and without warning.
which means arrhythmia, massive pulmonary embolus, or cerebral bleed.
what did Wilson do for me?
if the donor had an infection that somehow slipped by a screening, it could lay dormant
five organ systems hit.
would need five infections for it to somehow slip by screening.
Oh, sure, he made me laugh on a rainy day, made me see the colors I never knew
none of the donated organs were hit.
it means whatever they got came from the donor's blood.
that wouldn't help us narrow down what it narrows down who.
corneal transplants are bloodless. It means apple's gonna be fine.
you secure enough in that theory to send her home?
I guess we could wait till we figure out what's wrong with Frank.
on the other hand, Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh.
and how many colors are there really?
once you got red, blue, and green
he paid for your lunch, liked monster trucks, and was your conscience. Autoimmune disease.
A. N.A. At autopsy of all four victims were normal.
wouldn't cover vasculitis. Henoch-schonlein purpura
antiphospholipid antibodies, normal.
then that leaves cancer.
cancers have names.
they have a progression.
they affect specific organs.
bone cancer can't turn into liver cancer.
forget cancer.
it's cancer.
it's not cancer.
you're right, of course. What was I thinking?
no single type of cancer blew up three organs in the chest while also herniating in the fighter's brain stem.
the fighter's irrelevant.
you don't like coincidences.
it would be a coincidence if six transplant recipients had nothing else wrong with them
like being an idiot, which leads to getting your head knocked off.
the others had cancer.
four autopsies and about 1, 000 lab tests say it's not cancer.
redo the thousand tests and the four autopsies.
Taub and Kutner, check out the donor.
find out which cancer-- - he didn't die of cancer.
his head got chopped off in an industrial accident.
find out which cancer would have killed him.
check the home and office for carcinogens, toxins
he's been dead for four years.
I assume his home's been rented to someone else by now.
find out which cancer killed them.
did I forget you?
you can check out the patient's eye.
put this on Dr. O'shea.
and some chips.
forget your wallet, House? - No.
I'll take care of it.
check.
are you following me?
word is you're into monster trucks.
my kids like it.
but not you?
predator's okay, but I think the california crusher is overrated.
are you checking me out?
you're astute.
no.
how many pills did you just take?
vicodin, opioids, some B12.
need a little kick in the afternoon.
you got a problem with that?
I think I'm falling in love.
her right eye's failing.
no, it's not.
everyone else's transplanted organs were fine.
it means her eye is fine.
we need to remove the eye.
it's her only working eye.
we could remove the other one, but since it's not killing her, I thought this way was less insane.
do you have some ethical problem with what I'm doing that you could express in a unique way which might actually make me think that I'm wrong even though I'll never admit it?
Yes.
you are funny.
the problem's not in her eye. It's in her head.
you wanna come over and watch prescription passion at my place tonight?
you know I'm not gay, right?
neither am I.
if you don't want to have sex, that's cool with me.
I'm not coming over to your home.
I'll grow on you.
do I have to be in the same room as him?
whatever he's got, you've got.
fifth line. - Are you sure?
pretty sure. Fifth line.
am I gonna die?
can we talk about something besides you for a moment?
like maybe the fifth line?
damn.
I'm sorry. We need to remove your eye.
my eye?
a moment ago, you thought you were dying.
Blind's actually good news.
unfortunately, he's wrong.
you just did the test.
she didn't squint.
which means the eye thinks it's fine.
it was wrong. - I know. The eye doesn't think.
the brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong.
which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye.
which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head.
don't worry. It doesn't hurt.
hallucination.
that's a brain thing, right?
500 different things can cause hallucination.
doesn't mean it's neurological.
it does if one of the other organ recipients also had a brain issue.
did he just drop his hands?
no, none of them had brain issues.
if his pupils dilated, if his pupils were fixed, if there was a twitch...
he got hit in the head, he died, no mystery.
that was your point.
yesterday.
you live, you learn.
who shot this?
guy who runs the gym has a camera.
uploads the nasty stuff online.
can't see the dead guy's face.
I can't see his face, can't see the twitch, can't see the pupils
we know the tennis player had a heart problem.
we can maybe tie that to the tuba player's lungs, and then somehow tie both those things, to the construction worker's liver, and then possibly meander over to frank's pancreatic failure, but nothing causes simultaneous brain and heart problems.
cancer made no sense.
the head and heart make less than no sense.
that makes no sense.
I know. I was making a point.
Oh, good. I thought you were an idiot.
why are you talking?
Oh, the guy doing manual labor can't have an opinion?
I might be a genius who just happens to have a passion for fixing coffee machines.
no, I'm obviously not, but that's rude to make assumptions about people.
donor's history came up clean.
did he just laugh?
no, no, I sneezed.
he's a genius coffee repairman.
coffee repairman who wears argyle socks?
I thought I already talked about not judging.
what kind of idiot wears argyle socks with construction boots?
uh, I'm not an idiot.
I'm just--I'm not good at disguises.
who is he?
he's apparently a very bad private investigator.
uh, why is he pretending to fix the coffee machine?
because I wanted to find out what you guys found out before I find out what he found out.
so I can find out if I need a private investigator.
so, nu?
there's no history of unusual infections, no international travel in the 12 months
no, seriously, that's how I sneeze.
he was in Madrid and the Bahamas.
credit card receipts showed no-- - girlfriend paid.
there is no girlfriend.
she was his high school sweetheart.
high school sweetheart is married to his best friend.
I know.
she had a kid four years ago.
timing fits.
she's still pretty hot though.
you find out anything medical?
the kid has a tummy ache.
also, the dead guy was exposed to mercury, mold, and hydrous perchloric acid because their sex pad was next to a garage that was demolished after those toxins were found.
Oh, yeah, that will be $2, 300.
I'll get you a check.
no, I don't take checks.
you think I'm gonna stop payment?
aren't you? - Of course, I am.
actually, that price includes footage of the boxing match from four different angles.
30% of the crowd paid by credit card.
I got their names.
four of them had digital cameras, which I composited like nasa did for the pics of mars.
you know, the rovers and all that.
pupils were dilated.
but he didn't drop his hands, which means he maintained muscle tensity
say it.
you were right.
God, that was petty of me.
he maintained muscle tensity, but was momentarily distracted when he got hit.
that's a temporal lobe seizure.
does that P. I. Guy mean we don't have to break into people's homes anymore?
it's the whole reason you went to medical school.
I'm not gonna take that away from you.
he's better than we are. - And costs more.
gonna biopsy the brain.
no.
say it.
you were right, but no.
temporal lobe controls speech, hearing, memory.
she loses those things, she's gonna be a terrific date, but beyond that
we cut out a piece of it, good chance she's a vegetable.
nothing to hear, nothing to say, nothing to look back on.
you're right. She has so muchto live for.
do we have another patient who's almost finished with all their living?
so it's okay to stab his brain because he's old?
no, it's okay to stab his brain because he's dead if you don't.
get the widow to say yes.
no.
the lung inflammation is a complication of the pancreatic failure, which is reversible.
this is actually his best chance.
if we can find out what's wrong...
how can a test that will probably kill him
I didn't say-- - you said it was extremely risky.
what does extremely mean?
please.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I have a husband.
I have a two-year-old daughter. Her name is Julia.
you'd be saving her mother.
I think you're lying.
you haven't had one visitor.
not one phone call since you've been here.
does she have a child?
no.
but her life is still worth more than my husband's?
I lied to save my life. Wouldn't you?
not at another human being's expense.
no, you'd just rob me of my only chance so your husband can struggle to breathe for a few more days.
just shut up.
I don't want to hear from you. - Ladies.
you want to hate me so you won't feel guilty. - Shut up!
give me a scalpel. - Frank.
he's coding.
clear.
clear.
clear.
Frank! - clear.
clear.
clear.
did you get the consent? - No.
tell Foreman to get it.
old people are scared of black people.
it won't matter. Patient's dead.
save the brain.
don't need consent for an autopsy.
well, at best, we're gonna bat one for six on this one.
thin slices through the parietal and temporal lobes were clean.
occipital and frontotemporal regions were also
brain's clean. Moving on.
to where?
we've gone from making no sense, to making less sense, and then takena step backwards.
each of these people were killed by one thing that attacked one organ.
but never the same organ.
could the donor have had two things wrong?
or six things wrong?
metabolic diseases specialize.
everything else specializes, but cancer plays the field.
you're back to cancer?
metastasis is just a fancy word for screws around.
any type of cancer?
I don't know.
there would be evidence of cancer.
there is. We just haven't found it yet.
you need it to be cancer so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson.
give me something else that explains this constellation of patients, then you can call mean ass.
I didn't call you an ass.
perforated intestine.
if this thing started as normal bacteria living in the intestines but got into a blood vessel through a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall, then they would affect every organ through the blood stream.
it screws up everything.
for everyone.
okay.
it's a long shot, it is possible I'm an ass.
ironically, we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm.
we checked apple inside and out when she came in;she's clean.
the anomaly would have to be intermittent or they all would have died within a day.
she starts getting abdominal pain, shove a tube up her rear before it can get away.
and test anyone else with stomach pain.
everyone else is dead.
not everyone.
the one thing the donor gave to each of these people is his DNA.
anyone else have his DNA?
you want to do a colonoscopy on a healthy four-year-old?
she has a tummy ache.
if Kutner's right, it's not a tummy ache, it's a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancreas ache.
I'm not gonna scare the hell out of the poor kid's mom because of a long shot corollary to a long shot theory.
fine. Tell her the truth.
then ask if daddy knows who the real daddy is.
does she have to be awake?
we need her to tell us when it hurts.
she'll get over it.
your husband might not have.
what if a kid wants ice cream?
the sign outside says 'closed.
Dr. O'shea's not right for you.
What'd you find out?
why are you investigating him?
cause I need to know if he lends money interest-free.
what did you find out?
I want some ice cream.
not until you learn to read.
you're supposed to trust friends.
I don't know the guy. I got no logical reason
to be his friend?
have you never seen an after-school special?
that is part of the pleasure of friendship:
trusting without absolute evidence and then being rewarded for that trust.
you're taking pictures of a guy who's having an affair with his own sister.
and you're lecturing me about the rewards of trust.
there are two types of people that hire me.
no, actually, there are three types of people that hire me, but the third type's irrelevant to the point I want to make.
do you have a special rate plan for being a pain in the ass?
one type wants to find out that they're right, one type wants to find out that they're wrong.
which type am I?
you're the third type.
you lead with the irrelevant types?
you're the type that doesn't care if you're right or wrong because they've hired me to investigate the wrong person.
that's an actual type?
you want me to check out Wilson.
you want to find out if he's-- - how do you know about Wilson?
what do I do for a living?
have you been checking me out?
I've been paying for that?
so far, you haven't paid for anything.
you want to find out he's pining;
you want to find out if there's something about him that will tell you he's gonna come back or something you can use to make him come back.
is there?
no, no, there's nothing.
sorry.
that will be $900.
I gotta go.
I'll get you a check.
colonoscopy was clean.
then that just leaves cancer.
the fact that the kid's colonoscopy was negative doesn't prove anything.
Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything.
excellent point.
we don't know if the kid inherited anything.
even if she did, Kutner's theory is that the thing's intermittent.
the opening would have to be open shortly before death.
unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death.
and that seems like an obstacle.
what if there was a way around that?
then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.
not around death, around death as an obstacle.
we need to see his colon at work.
you do know what death means, right?
without a living system, there's not enough pressure to get fluid all the way up.
life we can't create, yet, but pressure's easy.
we use the same high pressure water jet we use to test cardiac workload.
I mean, he's not gonna be awake to tell us where it hurts
it's not gonna-- - do it.
it's kinda stuck.
it's more than stuck.
the bowel's been dead for six hours.
no matter what you shoot up there, it's closed.
this is nuts.
it's adjustable.
it's working. - Yeah.
not much.
increase the pressure.
the endoscope's bowing.
push on the stomach.
those are normal bodily fluids.
Yeah, normal bodily sewage.
put the pressure back on.
that's the end. No leaks.
wait. What's that?
that's just dark'cause I'm at the end.
what if you're not at the end?
what if it's a core lesion?
maybe a little more pressure?
not too much.
it's finally accelerating.
apple's heart rate has become irregular.
breathing is labored.
colonoscopy's still showing no leaks.
what if it is autoimmune?
what if we don't have conversations we've already had?
four out of the five didn't linger. They got sick and died.
we don't have time to dismiss things we've already dismissed.
nothing fits.
see, that's an example of a conversation we've already had.
she's sick. Something fits.
MS? - No!
okay, from now on, no one says anything unless no one's said it before.
where are you going?
you guys start immuno-gels on her csf to look for hidden protein markers.
then start sequencing her genes.
I'm gonna start treatment.
treatment for what? - Cancer.
it's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.
it's something.
which means we should treat her for something.
she's fine.
Where's her chart?
you rang emergency to get her chart?
I know. That was bad of me.
but I'm pretty sure the chart's supposed to be attached to the bed so that gimp doctors don't have to look all over the place while patients die.
thank you so much.
and some peppermint tea when you get a chance.
I need you to sign something.
consent to chemotherapy.
you found cancer?
no.
then you have tests indicating-- - nope.
then why should I sign it?
that's a good question.
it deserves a complicated answer.
placebo effect.
people have confidence in doctors, they have confidence in diagnoses, confidence in medicine.
sometimes they get a little better just because they think they will.
and that can make us think that the wrong answer is the right answer.
which is very bad.
so you do have proof that it's cancer but you can't tell me because it might affect the way I react to the medicine?
if that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true?
I was practically blind before the transplant.
2200 vision.
didn't you cover all this personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?
you don't care who I used to be?
you're a post-corneal transplant math teacher.
I deduced that you were a blind math teacher.
I was an architect.
you gave up architecture after you could see?
the world was ugly.
you think the world would be any different if your leg was fine?
no.
think you'd be any different if your leg was fine?
I mean, the doctors told me that my life was gonna be so much better once I could see.
I would date, I would dance, but, uh, the guys I hated dancing with before I hate dancing with after.
my parents were still dead.
I was still alone.
you're fun.
you don't seem all that different.
I haven't given up.
Wilson's got a new job, hasn't started yet, but
so who are we following?
see that lady up there?
you point at the target?
no, I'm following the one halfway in between that point and that point.
pretty.
who hired you? - No one. I just like her.
you're stalking her?
no, no, I followed her out of that bookstore back there.
you are stalking her, just not for very long.
so what else can you tell me that I might care about?
he attends this grief counseling thing twice a week where they go around the room and cry about who's dead.
cameron's been to his house several times, they just talk about death and losing loved ones.
what-- what are you
if she turns her head, she's gonna see that we're walking the wrong direction.
no, no, no, she won't. I'm very nondescript.
well, I'm not.
well, then you stay four feet behind me.
how do you know what they're talking about?
I'm in the same grief counseling group.
I recently lost my mother.
you'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.
I didn't lose a kid.
you're a P. I. Who can't lie?
I can lie. I'm just not all that good at it.
well, Dr. Cuddy's been overto Wilson's twice and phoneda bunch of times.
foreman called him.
and the rest of the time Wilson's been reading meditation books and magazines about restoring barns.
are you following me? - no.
are you lying?
no. - Yes.
lesson one: Commit.
it's making me uncomfortable.
sorry.
you're very pretty.
more uncomfortable.
she's not your type.
your type is much stupider than her.
what did Wilson say about me?
Oh, you've never come up.
in the grief counseling or in the other
anywhere, I got three bugs in his home and one in his car.
if I didn't know you, I wouldn't even know you existed.
which is good news.
only two things you ignore
things that aren't important and things you wish weren't important.
and wishing never works.
she's better.
I can tell at once.
vomiting's a side effect of the chemo.
her heart rate's stabilized, breathing's good.
amylase and triglycerides are both coming down.
I guess it's working.
can't believe it.
it's cancer.
it's not cancer.
labs show that our patient is healthier.
she's gonna get sicker.
then she's gonna die.
I brought Thai food.
what did you see in her? - Nothing.
it's not cancer.
all the tests say it's not cancer.
they've always said it's not cancer.
treatment proves it's cancer.
eh, treatment proves it could be cancer.
it's not cancer.
this was your diagnosis.
I never thought it was cancer.
you treated for cancer.
I thought that what she had acted like cancer.
if it acts like cancer, maybe it'll respond like cancer.
it did. 'Cause it's cancer.
we have to find something that walks like cancer, talks like cancer, tastes like cancer, but isn't cancer.
no, we don't.
better is better. Who cares why?
I do. And so does Tetrault.
who?
the dead tuba player.
the point is, he died last, but he died.
which means she's gonna die too.
Tibalt wasn't receiving cancer medication.
there's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.
there's no record of arthritis.
did you interview all the tuba students?
if he had joint pain in his hands, he couldn't have played.
then it wasn't in his hands.
then why do we care about his students?
one of them is Canadian.
brought him methotrexate so he could hide his arthritis.
already couldn't afford his insurance.
and that little piece of business cost me $700.
I'm gonna pass it on to the patient with a steep mark-up.
this makes no sense.
I know.
she's dead unless we can find what's cancer but not cancer.
something's missing.
I need an epiphany.
what are you billing out at?
$300 an hour?
here's four.
there are other oncologists.
better oncologists. But I need you.
let me describe the symptoms, problems, issues, and say whatever you feel like saying, until something triggers an idea in my head.
that's not the way it works.
you have a way of thinking about things.
it's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear.
it complements mine.
it drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise
house, please go away.
cancer, but not cancer.
responds to cancer treatment, but there's no
how are you?
don't do this. Please. Please.
don't do this.
I'm trying to move on.
by hanging out with Cameron, talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me.
I paid a private investigator to spy on you.
you didn't.
you want to move on from me, you got to deal with me, talk to me.
you had no right
we're not friends anymore.
there's no trust to be breached.
I can have you followed, I can call you names, tell your secrets.
foreman did a CT.
temporal and frontoparietal regions are normal.
occipital lobe, normal.
I have the right to walk away from you, House.
there's a world beyond you.
you need to realize that, and even if you don't, I'm moving on.
the next time you knock, I'm not answering.
nothing yet. Keep talking.
I'm sorry.
you charge me for listening in on my own conversations?
Yeah, why wouldn't I?
how many friends do you have?
Seriously? You have a list?
no, I knew this conversation was really about you, so I just gave you an answer so you could get back to your train of thought.
well done. I have one. Had one.
you know, friends are important.
you're gonna miss-- - shut up.
friends allow you to not sit in a room by yourself.
are you charging me for this?
are we friends? - No.
then yes.
do you wanna be my friend? - No. You scare me a little.
he thinks if he's not a friend, he can't talk to me.
we can talk, we can be two human beings talking
I'm with him. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
Yes, you did.
I was in the middle of a sentence.
Yes, I did. You're repeating yourself.
I'm grateful. Make your point.
it's like that"cancer, but not cancer" thing you were talking about before.
friends are friends, customers are customers, and everything else is everything else.
if it's not, nothing's nothing.
and anything can be anything.
10: 10. Stop the clock. - What?
the world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.
cancer, but not cancer.
doesn't make any sense unless...brain, but not brain.
occipital lobe's normal. But her eyes suck.
that lobe should be compensating.
since it's not, that tells me that something's in there that shouldn't be in there.
brain, but not brain.
why are you in my office?
to find the anomaly, I need to chop off the top of her head.
pretty sure I need your approval for that.
I'm gonna trust your first instinct.
I'm not usually confused when you say things like that.
I'm ordering her cancer treatment to be continued.
why does it cost $2, 300 to fix a coffee machine?
cancer stem cells are real.
they explain everything.
they're like embryonic stem cells.
they become whatever they want.
donor had them, the recipients got them.
they floated around, they landed on an organ, got bathed in cytomes and partially differentiated.
and the key word there is partially.
in the tuba player, they became lung, but not lung.
in the tennis player, they became heart, but not heart.
stop me if you've figured out the pattern.
they looked as if they belonged, but they weren't doing their jobs.
and when they were really needed, boom.
chemo worked because cells are basically tumors.
chemo shrunk them.
you're still gonna say no, aren't you?
you've no proof.
I have the brain scan.
the normal brain scan.
this is whyI need to take off her head.
to treat or to prove you're right?
to treat.
chemo's not killing anything.
it's just hiding the real problem.
she's gonna crash.
if we wait until she does crash, it might be too late.
so the next step is what?
I say no, and then you do something to make her crash so that I'll think you've proven your theory?
I would never do that.
no, you won't.
to change the world start with one step however small the first step is hardest of all once you get your gait you'll be walking tall you said you never did 'cause you might die tryin'
cause you might die tryin'
cause you if you close your eyes because the house is on fire and think you couldn't move until the fire dies
she's crashing!
cause you might die tryin'
cause you mightdie tryin'
you might want to check her IV.
from here, it looks like saline instead of chemo.
Yeah, they look identical.
still.
you should probably check.
you switched her meds?
how could I? I had no access.
close her back up.
do the surgery.
there's no reason to-- - no reason not to.
the stupidly dangerous part is already over with.
we're ready with the neural net.
is that someone's brain?
except for the part that isn't brain.
Hey, that's the patient I
you said she'd be fine.
I'm a better liar than you are.
I swapped her meds.
I mean, she's got a brain problem. I coulda killed her.
Yup.
the neural net will show us how fast her neurons are firing.
if there's something in the way, say...
brain that's not brain, the normal neural impulses will be sucked into a vortex because they're not able to do their job.
the computer will then process it and give us a picture of where to cut.
cool.
excuse me?
sorry, I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
you think all this is amazingly cool.
and you have no one else, so you're paying a guy to listen.
Sorry--just trying to save you some cash.
I'm on the clock.
Yeah, why wouldn't you be? You think this is interesting to me?
I see it.
can you get it? - I think so.
turns out you didn't kill her.
cool.
you owe me $5, 000.
why are you just standing there, Dr. House?
how'd you know who it is?
I can smell you.
Yeah, like you're a field of roses.
peppermint tea.
you ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?
never really bought that.
I don't care how often a kid cries, he's being eaten by a wolf, mom's gonna come running.
the world is ugly.
people kill.
they go hungry.
just proving a point.
people are asses.
why are you telling me this stuff?
because the world is not as ugly as you think it is.
your transplanted cornea's fine, your eye is fine, but your brain wasn't working right.
I'm gonna take the gauze off your eyes now.
it's gonna be bright. - I know.
the brain cells that weren't brain cells were in the way of processing visual information correctly.
after the transplant, you could see, but not see.
I could see. I could read.
Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know.
what I do know is that you were not seeing what everyone else was seeing.
and now? Things are gonna be beautiful?
things'll be what they are.
how do I look?
you look sad.
is there any way I could put you on retainer?
I still can't believe you talked me into this.
come on, honey.
you're gonna throw him off.
it's okay. I'm almost done.
a little more light on your hips.
Oh, god.
why couldn't you have come up with this before I had two kids?
you look amazing.
okay, I think... yeah, I'm done.
wanna come take a look?
I can't. You first.
no, we'll look together.
I don't understand.- I thought.
what the hell is that?
honey. It's okay.
this is not what we discussed, or what I paid for.
I don't understand.
I think this is one of the best I've ever done.
I want my money back.
I'm sorry, but this is not some department store photo studio.
and this is not my wife.
Yes, it is. You asked me to paint her exactly as she looks.
that's exactly what I did.
honey! Oh, stop it!
what's going on? Brandon!
that check... better be in my mailbox by Friday.
or I'll be back.
come on!
what happened? - I don't know.
they saw the painting and they just freaked out.
Brandon, what is this?
what do you mean? It's her portrait.
what's wrong with it?
Why's this in here?
first column, last entry.
today is going to be a good day.
this him?
Yes. - No.
she means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?
I'm Lucas Douglas, P. I.
this hospital's not putting a private investigator on retainer.
nor is it gonna pay any more phony repairs on vending machines, cryostats, or elevators.
information saves lives.
saving lives saves money.
no, saving lives costs money, which is why I'm trying to make sure there's still some left!
you want your own personal P. I.
you're gonna have to pay for him yourself.
sorry. - No, I understand.
Hey, - I like the shoes, by the way.
thank... you.
you don't like her shoes. You like her legs.
it sounds less creepy if you say shoes.
less creepy, more gay.
that's my firm's motto.
what is a cryostat?
no idea.
whoever fixed ours is about to get stiffed.
there's no distorted perspective in any of his other recent works.
not much talent, either.
so the symptoms just came on.
acute onset visual agnosia points to a stroke or brain tumor.
M.R.I. Revealed no stroke or brain tumor.
we should do another with contrast.
if he's like the other struggling artists I've known, he's also into drugs.
we should. - what are you looking at?
apparently a moron.
One--E. R. Routinely tests for drugs.
if it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file.
two. - Who pays 12% interest on a car loan?
how did you. - Did you run a credit check on me?
no... That would be illegal.
interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though...
what? It's part of my job.
your job is to diagnose patients.
which I do with the team.
how am I supposed to know how best to utilize that team if I don't know everything about them?
say the van gogh turns out to have neurosyphilis, and our last vial of penicillin is in a storeroom at the end of a 20-mile hallway with a two-foot high ceiling.
you've discovered that one of us has been hiding the ability to stretch or shrink themselves?
no. I would never out someone's super powers.
this, on the other hand...
you crawled 20 miles?
my name's in the Guinness book.
I'll bet that really impresses the babes.
I didn't do it to get the babes.
no, that would cheapen the purity of your achievement.
sorry to interrupt, but we have a patient with a probable brain tumor.
who needs an M. R.I. With contrast, we've established that.
what do you got on taub?
I got nothing on taub.
could also be environmental. We should check his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.
Taub's wife, on the other hand
house... That's enough.
dad's right. This is no time for gossip.
a patient desperately needs our help.
check his head and his house.
can't Lucas. - Nope.
he's very busy.
if there is a tumor, this test will show us
is that stuff dangerous?
this is just the contrast material.
there is a small risk of an anaphylaxis reaction.
I could stop breathing?
don't worry. We're prepared to deal with whatever happens.
you know, I did some drawings this morning, and they seemed fine.
so maybe it was just a reaction to something I ate.
how many people you know have reactions like that to something they ate for breakfast?
but if I'm getting better.
you will continue to get better.
if you're not, we need to know why not so we can start treatment immediately.
baby, let them do the test.
can lead poisoning cause visual agnosia?
not without lead showing up in the blood work.
nothing in the medicine cabinet except some harmless toiletries.
no signs of mold or fungus anywhere, either.
you think House really got something on your wife?
no. Not that I'd care if he did.
wait, your wife's doing the doorman in your bed, and they're sweating all over the sheets that you paid for and...
my wife's not doing the doorman.
how do you know? - We don't have a doorman.
and I just do, okay? Drop it.
in college, my friends and I came up with an inverse-square law.
sounds like a real fun group.
the girls who you think are the most inhibited... straight arrows...
they're the ones you hook up with.
are you saying my wife's a slut?
I'm saying if my wife was a slut, I'd wanna know.
his place was clean.
so is his head.
even with contrast, no masses, no lesions.
a neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause.
time course means we can rule out cancer and M. S.
just leaves toxins or drugs.
you called thirteen a moron for thinking it was drugs.
Yeah, but when she said it, she had other options.
and I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your a cavernous angioma in the brain could leak.
once the blood gets reabsorbed, the pressure goes down, the symptom goes away.
he'll never consent to petrosal vein sampling.
Really?
he was nervous about an injection of contrast.
is his girlfriend hot?
and I'm not talking fever here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?
Very...And if he dies, it's good news for all of us, but that explains why all his paintings suck.
and what's wrong with him.
where are you going?
to tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.
but he doesn't.
I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.
you seem to have a massive brain tumor.
who are you?
he's Dr. House. He's pleased to meet you.
we found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open.
it's risky, but it's the only way to save your life.
no.
wrong answer.
I'm not allowed to say no?
you're not allowed to not be terrified.
there's only two good reasons not to be terrified in a hospital.
you're delusional.
but then you're not afraid of contrast material either.
or you know you're fine.
since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information we don't have.
what drugs are you on?
his drug tests were clean.
drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.
what are you talking about?
hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful.
she's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie.
he needed money.
there's not many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence.
and I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia.
he's a guinea pig.
companies pay him to test their untested drugs.
did hottie go for a pee or coffee?
either way, I don't think you should waste any time on denials.
the clinical trials were supposed to be safe.
the drugs are about to be approved by the FDA.
drugs? How many trials are you on?
three.
admirable.
not many idiots have that much ambition.
you've been symptom-free since your admission, so whatever you took has probably cleared your system now.
you'll be fine.
keep him overnight, just to make sure, and get the names of all the trials he's been in.
you gonna tell heather?
couldn't, even if I cared enough to want to.
not bad.
you almost made it the whole day.
What'd you find out?
the point is to see how everyone reacts.
I'm gonna go get the rest of the gang.
cut the crap, House.
your wife has a separate bank account in her name only.
she's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now.
no withdrawals... yet.
that's it? A bank account?
a secret bank account.
what makes you think it's a secret?
because if it wasn't, you'd call it "the" bank account.
damn.
always forget to use the right article when lying.
it's not secret.
we're refurnishing.
we set the budget, set up an account.
I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.
you're spending almost $100, 000 on furniture?
Yes.
what happened? - I don't know.
he was fine, then all of a sudden, he started seizing.
he said you told him he was better.
what's happening? What's wrong with him?
she is hot.
obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.
none of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.
by themselves, no.
but three unproven, untested drugs?
this is like the mod squad.
no one could stop them.
ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.
just to short circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate.
but people won't test drugs unless they're desperate.
we need drugs to save children and puppies.
ergo, we need desperate people.
ergo, welfare kills sick children.
first drug.
why don't we call it bisexidrine?
clinical trials involve experimental drugs.
means they don't have comforting, catchy names yet.
just random, unmemorable trial numbers.
go ahead.
Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant.
phase one indicated some risk of nausea, E. D. And insomnia.
second drug.
Cuckoldisol.
she is having an affair? - Worse.
sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional.
can be easily regretted.
money is always a calculated decision.
my wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.
shocking. Discuss.
drug b is an autoimmune treatment. Almost no side effects.
but even if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing, it doesn't mix well with anticoagulants or anticonvulsives.
which is the third drug?
World's-sorest-knees-isil.
Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.
there's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to.
if they're not, two million.
and it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the problem.
unfortunately, we don't have to.
we just have to stop the interacting.
if we don't know which. - stop them all.
put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.
rapid detoxrisks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.
difference is, we know what those risks are.
put him on dialysis.
dialysis. Use that for kidney failure, right?
don't worry. Your kidneys are fine.
he's not worried about his kidneys.
he's worried about how he's going to explain the dialysis to his girlfriend.
I just don't want her to worry.
you mean you don't want her to leave you?
what's wrong with that? I love her.
it's not like I've lied to her about anything important.
I am an artist.
I've sold plenty of paintings in the past. It's just...
I've hit a bit of a dry spell lately, is all.
so tell her that.
he can't.
he wants her to be happy too.
he's telling her what she wants to hear.
you didn't know?
no.
what are you gonna do?
she's not sleeping around. She's not gambling it away.
she hasn't even spent any of it.
so I don't see a reason to do anything.
you don't think a conversation might how many people do you know in completely happy and fulfilled relationships?
none. - I am.
most people cling to some story book notion of what a relationship is.
you can't have an imperfect thought.
you can't have a private zone. You can't steal money and hide it away in a secret account?
she makes me happy. I make her happy. It works.
because we don't do storybook.
and I don't plan to poke into her business.
you were right about the dialysis.
he made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.
and I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office.
the only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people.
which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.
you can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.
what did she say?
did you just hear what I said?
I heard the part about you can screw with me at work all you want.
want my advice? - Of course not.
good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do.
I only know what you're going to do.
you're gonna. - I said I didn't want your advice.
I said this is not advice.
you are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you.
what purpose could that possibly serve?
none... which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.
what's your end game?
where are you?
at the track.
that's, like, six miles away.
how cool are these things?
I feel like an idiot.
I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.
you have those night vision goggles?
no.
you're lying.
you like making him miserable.
you like driving people away from you.
he deserved to know the truth.
there was no truth until you dug it up.
you do know that stuff exists even when you can't see it, right?
it was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her.
why did it matter to you?
first of all, stop saying "a" truth.
there is only one truth.
that may be true for you.
miserable people save more lives.
if your life has meaning, your job doesn't have to have meaning.
screw-ups are more palatable if you have someone's arms to go cry in.
Yeah, that makes sense.
usually I have more of a fight on that one.
so why are you making taub miserable?
I just said!
he left his last job to save his marriage.
if his marriage falls apart, you think he'll be working harder for you?
or you think he won't be working for you at all?
his head and neck are completely swollen.
I need a trache kit. His throat's closing.
can't find any landmarks.
just start cutting.
an exploratory trache?
we don't have a choice.
got it.
his face is so swollen it squeezed his tear ducts shut.
we've been lubricating his eyes by hand.
we started him on steroids, iv and cream, to reduce the swelling, but it's having limited effect.
negative for thrombosis and chagas.
could be infection.
culture's still negative.
could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.
why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice?
sorry. You guys still diagnosing?
thought we'd finished hours ago.
you remember, when we decided it was the unproven, unapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like...
like a cocktail.
he just completed a total dialysis.
if it was the drugs, he'd be better.
or he'd be worse.
I take it none of you saw trainspotting.
you think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?
you think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?
it's possible some of the symptoms
either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence.
if it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him.
if it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis.
which means we have to find a better way to detox him.
so how do we do it?
hair of the drug that bit him.
that's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused
that's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again.
just much slower.
why are you looking at him?
try it out.
you heard the boss! Go!
Taub. - I didn't talk to her.
why are you？ - Excuse me.
uh, sorry.
he does look like me, doesn't he?
you gave him your hat.
I needed you out of here, so I could go through your desk.
of course.
nice blouse.
I really like that color on you.
tell House that if he wants to know what I'm doing, all he has to do.
it's not House, it's. - It's me.
I was. - I don't know.
I was thinking maybe we could get together for a drink or something.
I wasn't sure exactly what you like to do.
so I thought... - You'd spy on me.
no. No. Not spying. More like research.
I think it's a good idea to get to know a little bit more about a woman before you ask her out.
show you care about more than just what she looks like.
as romantic as you make that sound, I'm pretty sure that what you're doing is not so much caring as creepy.
that's not fair.
you were scrounging through my desk.
what the hell am I gonna find out?
you went to michigan.
you like your sandwiches a little light on mayo.
you stay in touch with your mother.
you rented the english patient and you gave money to amnesty international.
there's not one thing I can find out in here that you wouldn't tell a coworker while riding in an elevator.
I'm not a creep. I just thought you seemed interesting.
I'll go now.
Yeah, these, um...
I'll give you embarrassing info on House.
in exchange for. - No, no need for a date.
you'd be employing me, so I'd have all the time in the world to ask you all about you, and it would fall under the category of socializing instead of creepy stalking.
and I'd be paying you?
I know it's weird.
but if you pay me while I check you out, it's. - It's all cool.
and you get value, you get leverage against him.
help you keep him in line.
you think I need help keeping House in line?
no.
Nope. Sorry.
this hospital can't afford. - Oh, whatever you can afford.
how'd you know I liked roses?
I was in your House last night.
No! I'm kidding.
who the hell doesn't like roses?
I forgot to tell you.
the parker quartet's gonna play at the library fund raiser.
that's it?
it was your idea.
they'll be great.
you okay?
I couldn't find the letter opener.
I went through some of the drawers in your desk looking for it.
there were a bunch of statements in there from jefferson mutual.
I was so close.
to what?
you've got $83, 000 socked away in a secret account.
not anymore.
I wanted to keep it a surprise, but...
I bought you a car.
the one that... that I...
I knew you would never buy it yourself, so...
I've been saving.
and it's gonna be delivered on friday.
you are amazing.
lucky you.
we've gradually reduced your dosage.
you're actually drug-free now.
I feel great. Thanks to you.
all part of the job.
your blood pressure's normal. Can you sit up?
what are you! - ohh!
what happened to his face?
question is what happened to his hormones?
we can rule out the clinical trial drugs at this point.
his system has been completely cleaned twice.
unless the drugs found a hiding place under the stairs.
drugs could have set off a dormant neurological condition.
good point.
coming clean can cause a lot of damage.
alienation, divorce.
my wife's buying me a car.
I was talking about the patient.
you were wrong. - Divorce was metaphorical.
what about kluver-bucy syndrome?
bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes, visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.
good thing he's got that girlfriend.
if it's kluver-bucy, his brain'll melt down, he'll try to swallow his own hands, and she can take care of him for the rest of his talentless life.
you owe me an apology.
any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason
you're right.
fact is, nothing I said applies.
you had no reason to forgive her.
therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness.
no reason to be an idiot.
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain the seizure or the cytokine storm.
withdrawal complications.
then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve.
the fact that the M.R.I. Showed no lesions on the temporal lobe tends to rule out your lesions on the temporal lobe theory.
the damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural.
we wouldn't see that on the M.R.I.
Foreman's right.
go call your wife, tell her you're not coming home 'cause you have to give the patient a cranial M. R.Angiogram.
then say good night and hang up.
odd that a man who can't run would own so many pairs of sneakers.
you mind hanging this up when you're done?
I have to find something embarrassing about you.
no, you don't.
I ordered us indian.
not too embarrassing, just something credible.
well, if you hand her that...
she's not gonna need you anymore.
well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.
I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.
this isn't gonna work.
it's worked so far.
no, I'm no good at lying.
I know.
that's why your cover is that you want to do her.
I like her. I don't wanna do her.
then what's the point of liking her?
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her.
what do you think you're gonna find out about her?
something... personal. Something embarrassing.
I've spent half my life negotiating with that woman.
anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.
okay.
okay?
you're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?
I'm okay. I don't believe you, but I'm okay.
you're doing this for the same reason I'm doing this.
we'll see who gets there first.
here it is. Circle of willis, the vessels are narrow.
narrow for you, normal for him.
if there were problems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.
not if something else changed.
like? - His heart.
he could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.
I know "heart" and "head" start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end.
the experimental drug is causing arrhythmia, which causes low blood pressure.
combine that with those narrow vessels, the brain doesn't get enough blood.
that causes all of his symptoms.
if we can trigger the arrhythmia and identify it, we might be able to stop it from killing him.
been home?
no.
good. Do an E. P. Study. Find the arrhythmia.
we're gonna insert three electrocatheters into your heart.
tell Dr. Hadley I'm sorry.
she understands.
and you should tell her yourself.
maybe I should tell heather about. - You're gonna be fine.
she's just so supportive. And so great. All I do is lie to her.
what happens if you tell her?
I don't know.
you love her, right?
more than anything, and she loves me.
if you open your mouth, one of two things happens.
she either forgives you or she leaves you.
at best, you wind up exactly where you are right now.
it's noble to want to confess.
really, it is.
but if the result's just damage and pain, that's not noble.
that's selfish.
stimulate right atrium.
no more conduction.
how long you plan on keeping me from going home?
until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?
guilt fades quickly.
by wednesday, you'll be fine.
right ventricle.
and why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?
Because...If it ain't broke.
you obviously think it is broke.
you obviously think it ain't.
your marriage is like a broken toaster.
the bread keeps popping out, and you keep calling it toast.
which is weird, because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters.
and apparently, you don't see any difference.
it's kind of fascinating.
he's going into v-tach.
what's wrong?
good news. - The test is working.
your heart's freaking out, but it's cool that you're still conscious.
try to overdrive.
didn't work.
this might burn a little bit. Charging to 60. Clear.
going again, charging to 120.
are you dyeing your hair?
no. - House, clear.
right.
the hair is growing in red.
his heart rate is stabilized.
does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color?
either he's lying about dyeing...
or just... dying.
red hair means it's not kluver-bucy.
melanin affects hair color.
what affects melanin?
hormones. - Hormone panels were all normal.
age.
he's turning prematurely crimson?
a genetic disorder.
Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.
and make you deaf. Next.
found a long qt interval.
I think it's romano-ward syndrome.
explains the irregular heart rhythms.
but not the ginger nut.
if he's got romano's, he's got at least five gene mutations.
not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.
it also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.
beta blockers don't work.
his heart can't handle an I. C.D.
good god!
has none of you ever read a history book?
the original beatles drummer.
a bunch of nerves controls the tempo of the heart.
they're all playing in time, except one dude can't keep the beat.
wrecks the whole thing.
so we hire ringo.
Pete best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?
probably should have just said that, huh?
start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.
so he saves a fortune on karaoke machines and deodorant.
you think he's stable enough for surgery?
if he was, he wouldn't need it.
Yeah.
do you have any brothers and sisters?
one sister.
he told me he was on the lacrosse team.
in high school. In college, he just cheered the lacrosse team on to victory.
Yeah.
how was your relationship with your dad?
fine. You have three more questions.
how was your relationship with your mom? - Fine.
when did you lose your virginity?
not something I'd discuss with coworkers in an elevator.
and...
and...
you know, don't you?
a bit of a wasted third question.
cause the answer is "know what?
okay, bear with me here.
because some people sometimes consider my thought processes complicated.
I'm into you,'cause you're hot. And smart.
in that order, but both are needed.
photos can be retouched.
and House is an evil genius, which makes this photo suspicious.
and yet you're not suspicious.
which means either you're not smart enough to be suspicious, in which case,
I am less interested in you, or you're not suspicious because you know this is actually a doctored photo of House.
in which case, I am more interested in you.
but I am wasting my time, because you know this is a game we are playing on you, and I am busted.
and I'm screwed.
I know the photo's a fake.
and I know this is a game.
I'm sorry.
too bad.
good-bye.
so you knew that I wasn't gonna give you anything worthwhile?
and you were never gonna give me anything worthwhile.
then why did you bother coming out with me?
I... wanted to screw with House.
by wasting my time?
that doesn't make sense.
no, uh...
there must be another reason.
is it okay if I sit back down here?
your heartbeat's out of control.
we need to surgically sever the connection between your heart and brain.
we believe it's necessary, but you need to know the ramifications.
you'll never be able to feel angina.
you may not know if you have a heart attack.
you may not be able to get help in time.
where are my regular doctors?
regular doctors?
Dr. Taub and dr. Hadley.
why aren't they telling me this?
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley. And this is Dr. Taub.
what are you talking about?
I've never seen you before in my life.
we can't do the surgery.
we're back to where we started. Visual agnosia.
we need to reexamine neurological disorders.
something's slowly progressing.
this isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is.
it's a new symptom, intermittence.
it's irrelevant.
since when is a new symptom irrelevant?
since it points towards the same disease.
intermittence can fit with romano-ward.
we still need to do a sympathectomy.
maybe we missed something.
toxins. - When?
when you checked every bottle, every can, every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?
maybe there is a batch of toxic paint that he used up a few months ago.
then he would have been sick months ago, not now.
he's lost weight since he got here.
that's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.
it's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?
so where you gonna get this old paint?
city dump?
on his old paintings.
we know he hasn't sold one in ages.
but there weren't many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.
if you're wrong...
he could drop dead from romano-ward at any moment. You okay with that?
just give me a few hours.
you got one.
I need to talk to him alone.
it's about your work. Your paintings.
I need to look at all the ones you've sold recently.
honey, can you give us a minute?
to talk about your paintings?
Brandon, please. Tell me what's going on.
I've only sold two paintings in the last three years.
since we met.
one was to my cousin.
I've been making money enrolling in drug trials.
two, three at a time.
why did you lie to me?
I wanna be, uh...
the way you look at me. The way it makes me feel.
uh, I wanna be... what you see...
when you look at me.
you think I'm that shallow?
when I look at you... I see you.
so...
where are the ones you didn't sell?
it's not the paint, it's the drugs.
he's not on the drugs.
I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months.
they're normal april, june, and august.
but they're distorted may, july, september.
every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously.
the statin was one month on, one month off.
I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.
they're hiding under the stairs.
in the fat? That doesn't make sense.
these drugs aren't fat soluble.
I said stairs, not closet.
what was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?
I'm not sure. I think
antacid.
how do you know? - It makes sense.
also, I'm looking at the file.
yes?
it's Dr. House.
uh, wake him up. We're done.
no, no. - He says he needs surgery, but not this one.
did he give any specifics?
abdominal surgery to remove A... bezoar.
it's like a hairball, but it's made up of undigested food.
you can get it if your stomach acid's low, which brandon's was because of an experimental antacid.
fruit and vegetable fibers and skins get stuck together and form a ball.
it gets sticky, ferments, grows.
it starts sucking up some of the pills he'd taken.
some are never heard from again.
but some get released.
for the last week, it's basically been giving him massive doses of all three at once.
and that is why I won't let cameron buy a cat.
he should be fine.
are you glad he told you the truth?
yes... of course.
but...
were you happier before you knew?
about ten more feet.
I do know what it looks like, so maybe this whole blindfold thing
Shh. - My gift, my rules. Bump.
all right, if you don't like the cabut I'm hoping.
you ready?
do you like it?
baby, are you okay?
we need to talk.
damn.
so you didn't get anything.
nothin'.
we probably overstepped.
you're really not the cheerleader type.
on the other hand,
I figured she probably wouldn't figure me as the "photoshopping" a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper "type either.
heh, yeah. About that.
I took a little trip to your alma mater.
you took a little trip 150 miles.
online, by phone.
I meant I did research.
that's a real photo, isn't it?
wow, that is humiliating.
there was a girl.
even more so.
that's too bad.
you wanted her to see you in a different light, and...
not only didn't she see it...
she didn't even believe it was possible.
you know, people hate people who have theories about people.
you want me to back off?
would you?
I barely know you.
I still can't believe you talked me into this.
come on, honey.
you're gonna throw him off.
it's okay. I'm almost done.
a little more light on your hips.
Oh, god.
why couldn't you have come up with this before I had two kids?
you look amazing.
okay, I think... yeah, I'm done.
wanna come take a look?
I can't. You first.
no, we'll look together.
I don't understand. - I thought.
what the hell is that?
honey. It's okay.
this is not what we discussed, or what I paid for.
I don't understand.
I think this is one of the best I've ever done.
I want my money back.
I'm sorry, but this is not some department store photo studio.
and this is not my wife.
Yes, it is. You asked me to paint her exactly as she looks.
that's exactly what I did.
honey! Oh, stop it!
what's going on? Brandon!
that check... better be in my mailbox by Friday.
or I'll be back.
come on!
what happened? - I don't know.
they saw the painting and they just freaked out.
Brandon, what is this?
what do you mean? It's her portrait.
what's wrong with it?
Why's this in here?
first column, last entry.
today is going to be a good day.
this him?
Yes. - No.
she means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?
I'm Lucas Douglas, P.I.
this hospital's not putting a private investigator on retainer.
nor is it gonna pay any more phony repairs on vending machines, cryostats, or elevators.
information saves lives.
saving lives saves money.
no, saving lives costs money, which is why I'm trying to make sure there's still some left!
you want your own personal P.I.
you're gonna have to pay for him yourself.
sorry. - No, I understand.
Hey, - I like the shoes, by the way.
thank... you.
you don't like her shoes. You like her legs.
it sounds less creepy if you say shoes.
less creepy, more gay.
that's my firm's motto.
what is a cryostat?
no idea.
whoever fixed ours is about to get stiffed.
there's no distorted perspective in any of his other recent works.
not much talent, either.
so the symptoms just came on.
acute onset visual agnosia points to a stroke or brain tumor.
M.R.I. revealed no stroke or brain tumor.
we should do another with contrast.
if he's like the other struggling artists I've known, he's also into drugs.
we should. - What are you looking at?
apparently a moron.
one - E.R. routinely tests for drugs.
if it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file.
two - Who pays 12% interest on a car loan?
how did you. - Did you run a credit check on me?
no... That would be illegal.
interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though...
what? It's part of my job.
your job is to diagnose patients.
which I do with the team.
how am I supposed to know how best to utilize that team if I don't know everything about them?
say the Van Gogh turns out to have neurosyphilis, and our last vial of penicillin is in a storeroom at the end of a 20-mile hallway with a two-foot high ceiling.
you've discovered that one of us has been hiding the ability to stretch or shrink themselves?
no. I would never out someone's super powers.
this, on the other hand...
you crawled 20 miles?
my name's in the Guinness book.
I'll bet that really impresses the babes.
I didn't do it to get the babes.
no, that would cheapen the purity of your achievement.
sorry to interrupt, but we have a patient with a probable brain tumor.
who needs an M.R.I. with contrast, we've established that.
what do you got on Taub?
I got nothing on Taub.
could also be environmental. We should check his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.
Taub's wife, on the other hand
house... That's enough.
dad's right. This is no time for gossip.
a patient desperately needs our help.
check his head and his house.
can't Lucas. - Nope.
he's very busy.
if there is a tumor, this test will show us
is that stuff dangerous?
this is just the contrast material.
there is a small risk of an anaphylaxis reaction.
I could stop breathing?
don't worry. We're prepared to deal with whatever happens.
you know, I did some drawings this morning, and they seemed fine.
so maybe it was just a reaction to something I ate.
how many people you know have reactions like that to something they ate for breakfast?
but if I'm getting better.
you will continue to get better.
if you're not, we need to know why not so we can start treatment immediately.
baby, let them do the test.
can lead poisoning cause visual agnosia?
not without lead showing up in the blood work.
nothing in the medicine cabinet except some harmless toiletries.
no signs of mold or fungus anywhere, either.
you think House really got something on your wife?
no. Not that I'd care if he did.
wait, your wife's doing the doorman in your bed, and they're sweating all over the sheets that you paid for and...
my wife's not doing the doorman.
how do you know? - We don't have a doorman.
and I just do, okay? Drop it.
in college, my friends and I came up with an inverse-square law.
sounds like a real fun group.
the girls who you think are the most inhibited... straight arrows...
they're the ones you hook up with.
are you saying my wife's a slut?
I'm saying if my wife was a slut, I'd wanna know.
his place was clean.
so is his head.
even with contrast, no masses, no lesions.
a neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause.
time course means we can rule out cancer and M.S.
just leaves toxins or drugs.
you called thirteen a moron for thinking it was drugs.
Yeah, but when she said it, she had other options.
and I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your a cavernous angioma in the brain could leak.
once the blood gets reabsorbed, the pressure goes down, the symptom goes away.
he'll never consent to petrosal vein sampling.
Really?
he was nervous about an injection of contrast.
is his girlfriend hot?
and I'm not talking fever here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?
Very...And if he dies, it's good news for all of us, but that explains why all his paintings suck.
and what's wrong with him.
where are you going?
to tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.
but he doesn't.
I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.
you seem to have a massive brain tumor.
who are you?
he's Dr. House. He's pleased to meet you.
we found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open.
it's risky, but it's the only way to save your life.
no.
wrong answer.
I'm not allowed to say no?
you're not allowed to not be terrified.
there's only two good reasons not to be terrified in a hospital.
you're delusional.
but then you're not afraid of contrast material either.
or you know you're fine.
since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information we don't have.
what drugs are you on?
his drug tests were clean.
drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.
what are you talking about?
hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful.
she's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie.
he needed money.
there's not many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence.
and I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia.
he's a guinea pig.
companies pay him to test their untested drugs.
did hottie go for a pee or coffee?
either way, I don't think you should waste any time on denials.
the clinical trials were supposed to be safe.
the drugs are about to be approved by the FDA.
drugs? How many trials are you on?
three.
admirable.
not many idiots have that much ambition.
you've been symptom-free since your admission, so whatever you took has probably cleared your system now.
you'll be fine.
keep him overnight, just to make sure, and get the names of all the trials he's been in.
you gonna tell Heather?
couldn't, even if I cared enough to want to.
not bad.
you almost made it the whole day.
What'd you find out?
the point is to see how everyone reacts.
I'm gonna go get the rest of the gang.
cut the crap, House.
your wife has a separate bank account in her name only.
she's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now.
no withdrawals... yet.
that's it? A bank account?
a secret bank account.
what makes you think it's a secret?
because if it wasn't, you'd call it "the" bank account.
damn.
always forget to use the right article when lying.
it's not secret.
we're refurnishing.
we set the budget, set up an account.
I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.
you're spending almost $100, 000 on furniture?
Yes.
what happened? - I don't know.
he was fine, then all of a sudden, he started seizing.
he said you told him he was better.
what's happening? What's wrong with him?
she is hot.
obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.
none of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.
by themselves, no.
but three unproven, untested drugs?
this is like the mod squad.
no one could stop them.
ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.
just to short circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate.
but people won't test drugs unless they're desperate.
we need drugs to save children and puppies.
ergo, we need desperate people.
ergo, welfare kills sick children.
first drug.
why don't we call it bisexidrine?
clinical trials involve experimental drugs.
means they don't have comforting, catchy names yet.
just random, unmemorable trial numbers.
go ahead.
Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant.
phase one indicated some risk of nausea, E.D. and insomnia.
second drug.
Cuckoldisol.
she is having an affair? - Worse.
sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional.
can be easily regretted.
money is always a calculated decision.
my wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.
shocking. Discuss.
drug b is an autoimmune treatment. Almost no side effects.
but even if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing, it doesn't mix well with anticoagulants or anticonvulsives.
which is the third drug?
World's-sorest-knees-isil.
Cuddy used to have that title, by the way.
there's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to.
if they're not, two million.
and it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the problem.
unfortunately, we don't have to.
we just have to stop the interacting.
if we don't know which. - Stop them all.
put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.
rapid detoxrisks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.
difference is, we know what those risks are.
put him on dialysis.
dialysis. Use that for kidney failure, right?
don't worry. Your kidneys are fine.
he's not worried about his kidneys.
he's worried about how he's going to explain the dialysis to his girlfriend.
I just don't want her to worry.
you mean you don't want her to leave you?
what's wrong with that? I love her.
it's not like I've lied to her about anything important.
I am an artist.
I've sold plenty of paintings in the past. It's just...
I've hit a bit of a dry spell lately, is all.
so tell her that.
he can't.
he wants her to be happy too.
he's telling her what she wants to hear.
you didn't know?
no.
what are you gonna do?
she's not sleeping around. She's not gambling it away.
she hasn't even spent any of it.
so I don't see a reason to do anything.
you don't think a conversation might how many people do you know in completely happy and fulfilled relationships?
none. - I am.
most people cling to some story book notion of what a relationship is.
you can't have an imperfect thought.
you can't have a private zone. You can't steal money and hide it away in a secret account?
she makes me happy. I make her happy. It works.
because we don't do storybook.
and I don't plan to poke into her business.
you were right about the dialysis.
he made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.
and I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office.
the only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people.
which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.
you can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.
what did she say?
did you just hear what I said?
I heard the part about you can screw with me at work all you want.
want my advice? - Of course not.
good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do.
I only know what you're going to do.
you're gonna. - I said I didn't want your advice.
I said this is not advice.
you are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you.
what purpose could that possibly serve?
none... Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.
what's your end game?
where are you?
at the track.
that's, like, six miles away.
how cool are these things?
I feel like an idiot.
I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.
you have those night vision goggles?
no.
you're lying.
you like making him miserable.
you like driving people away from you.
he deserved to know the truth.
there was no truth until you dug it up.
you do know that stuff exists even when you can't see it, right?
it was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her.
why did it matter to you?
first of all, stop saying "a" truth.
there is only one truth.
that may be true for you.
miserable people save more lives.
if your life has meaning, your job doesn't have to have meaning.
screw-ups are more palatable if you have someone's arms to go cry in.
Yeah, that makes sense.
usually I have more of a fight on that one.
so why are you making Taub miserable?
I just said!
he left his last job to save his marriage.
if his marriage falls apart, you think he'll be working harder for you?
or you think he won't be working for you at all?
his head and neck are completely swollen.
I need a trache kit. His throat's closing.
can't find any landmarks.
just start cutting.
an exploratory trache?
we don't have a choice.
got it.
his face is so swollen it squeezed his tear ducts shut.
we've been lubricating his eyes by hand.
we started him on steroids, IV and cream, to reduce the swelling, but it's having limited effect.
negative for thrombosis and chagas.
could be infection.
culture's still negative.
could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.
why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice?
sorry. You guys still diagnosing?
thought we'd finished hours ago.
you remember, when we decided it was the unproven, unapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like... like a cocktail.
he just completed a total dialysis.
if it was the drugs, he'd be better.
or he'd be worse.
I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.
you think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?
you think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?
it's possible some of the symptoms
either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence.
if it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him.
if it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis.
which means we have to find a better way to detox him.
so how do we do it?
hair of the drug that bit him.
that's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused
that's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again.
just much slower.
why are you looking at him?
try it out.
you heard the boss! Go!
Taub. - I didn't talk to her.
why are you? - Excuse me.
uh, sorry.
he does look like me, doesn't he?
you gave him your hat.
I needed you out of here, so I could go through your desk.
of course.
nice blouse.
I really like that color on you.
tell House that if he wants to know what I'm doing, all he has to do.
it's not House, it's - It's me.
I was. - I don't know.
I was thinking maybe we could get together for a drink or something.
I wasn't sure exactly what you like to do.
so I thought... - You'd spy on me.
no. No. Not spying. More like research.
I think it's a good idea to get to know a little bit more about a woman before you ask her out.
show you care about more than just what she looks like.
as romantic as you make that sound, I'm pretty sure that what you're doing is not so much caring as creepy.
that's not fair.
you were scrounging through my desk.
what the hell am I gonna find out?
you went to Michigan.
you like your sandwiches a little light on mayo.
you stay in touch with your mother.
you rented The English Patient and you gave money to Amnesty International.
there's not one thing I can find out in here that you wouldn't tell a coworker while riding in an elevator.
I'm not a creep. I just thought you seemed interesting.
I'll go now.
Yeah, these, um...
I'll give you embarrassing info on House.
in exchange for. - No, no need for a date.
you'd be employing me, so I'd have all the time in the world to ask you all about you, and it would fall under the category of socializing instead of creepy stalking.
and I'd be paying you?
I know it's weird.
but if you pay me while I check you out, it's. - It's all cool.
and you get value, you get leverage against him.
help you keep him in line.
you think I need help keeping House in line?
no.
Nope. Sorry.
this hospital can't afford. - Oh, whatever you can afford.
how'd you know I liked roses?
I was in your House last night.
No! I'm kidding.
who the hell doesn't like roses?
I forgot to tell you.
the parker quartet's gonna play at the library fund raiser.
that's it?
it was your idea.
they'll be great.
you okay?
I couldn't find the letter opener.
I went through some of the drawers in your desk looking for it.
there were a bunch of statements in there from Jefferson mutual.
I was so close.
to what?
you've got $83, 000 socked away in a secret account.
not anymore.
I wanted to keep it a surprise, but...
I bought you a car.
the one that... that I...
I knew you would never buy it yourself, so...
I've been saving.
and it's gonna be delivered on Friday.
you are amazing.
lucky you.
we've gradually reduced your dosage.
you're actually drug-free now.
I feel great. Thanks to you.
all part of the job.
your blood pressure's normal. Can you sit up?
what are you! - ohh!
what happened to his face?
question is what happened to his hormones?
we can rule out the clinical trial drugs at this point.
his system has been completely cleaned twice.
unless the drugs found a hiding place under the stairs.
drugs could have set off a dormant neurological condition.
good point.
coming clean can cause a lot of damage.
alienation, divorce.
my wife's buying me a car.
I was talking about the patient.
you were wrong. - Divorce was metaphorical.
what about Kluver-Bucy Syndrome?
bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes, visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.
good thing he's got that girlfriend.
if it's Kluver-bucy, his brain'll melt down, he'll try to swallow his own hands, and she can take care of him for the rest of his talentless life.
you owe me an apology.
any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason
you're right.
fact is, nothing I said applies.
you had no reason to forgive her.
therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness.
no reason to be an idiot.
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain the seizure or the cytokine storm.
withdrawal complications.
then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve.
the fact that the M.R.I. showed no lesions on the temporal lobe tends to rule out your lesions on the temporal lobe theory.
the damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural.
we wouldn't see that on the M.R.I.
Foreman's right.
go call your wife, tell her you're not coming home 'cause you have to give the patient a cranial M.R. angiogram.
then say good night and hang up.
odd that a man who can't run would own so many pairs of sneakers.
you mind hanging this up when you're done?
I have to find something embarrassing about you.
no, you don't.
I ordered us Indian.
not too embarrassing, just something credible.
well, if you hand her that...
she's not gonna need you anymore.
well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.
I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.
this isn't gonna work.
it's worked so far.
no, I'm no good at lying.
I know.
that's why your cover is that you want to do her.
I like her. I don't wanna do her.
then what's the point of liking her?
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her.
what do you think you're gonna find out about her?
something... personal. Something embarrassing.
I've spent half my life negotiating with that woman.
anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.
okay.
okay?
you're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?
I'm okay. I don't believe you, but I'm okay.
you're doing this for the same reason I'm doing this.
we'll see who gets there first.
here it is. Circle of Willis, the vessels are narrow.
narrow for you, normal for him.
if there were problems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago.
not if something else changed.
like? - His heart.
he could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.
I know "heart" and "head" start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end.
the experimental drug is causing arrhythmia, which causes low blood pressure.
combine that with those narrow vessels, the brain doesn't get enough blood.
that causes all of his symptoms.
if we can trigger the arrhythmia and identify it, we might be able to stop it from killing him.
been home?
no.
good. Do an E.P. study. Find the arrhythmia.
we're gonna insert three electrocatheters into your heart.
tell Dr. Hadley I'm sorry.
she understands.
and you should tell her yourself.
maybe I should tell heather about. - You're gonna be fine.
she's just so supportive. And so great. All I do is lie to her.
what happens if you tell her?
I don't know.
you love her, right?
more than anything, and she loves me.
if you open your mouth, one of two things happens.
she either forgives you or she leaves you.
at best, you wind up exactly where you are right now.
it's noble to want to confess.
really, it is.
but if the result's just damage and pain, that's not noble.
that's selfish.
stimulate right atrium.
no more conduction.
how long you plan on keeping me from going home?
until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?
guilt fades quickly.
by Wednesday, you'll be fine.
right ventricle.
and why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?
because... If it ain't broke.
you obviously think it is broke.
you obviously think it ain't.
your marriage is like a broken toaster.
the bread keeps popping out, and you keep calling it toast.
which is weird, because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters.
and apparently, you don't see any difference.
it's kind of fascinating.
he's going into v-tach.
what's wrong?
good news. - The test is working.
your heart's freaking out, but it's cool that you're still conscious.
try to overdrive.
didn't work.
this might burn a little bit. Charging to 60. Clear.
going again, charging to 120.
are you dyeing your hair?
no. - House, clear.
right.
the hair is growing in red.
his heart rate is stabilized.
does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color?
either he's lying about dyeing...
or just... dying.
red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy.
melanin affects hair color.
what affects melanin?
hormones. - Hormone panels were all normal.
age.
he's turning prematurely crimson?
a genetic disorder.
Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.
and make you deaf. Next.
found a long QT interval.
I think it's Romano-Ward syndrome.
explains the irregular heart rhythms.
but not the ginger nut.
if he's got Romano's, he's got at least five gene mutations.
not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.
it also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.
beta blockers don't work.
his heart can't handle an I.C.D.
good god!
has none of you ever read a history book?
the original Beatles drummer.
a bunch of nerves controls the tempo of the heart.
they're all playing in time, except one dude can't keep the beat.
wrecks the whole thing.
so we hire Ringo.
Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?
probably should have just said that, huh?
start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.
so he saves a fortune on karaoke machines and deodorant.
you think he's stable enough for surgery?
if he was, he wouldn't need it.
Yeah.
do you have any brothers and sisters?
one sister.
he told me he was on the lacrosse team.
in high school. In college, he just cheered the lacrosse team on to victory.
Yeah.
how was your relationship with your dad?
fine. You have three more questions.
how was your relationship with your mom? - Fine.
when did you lose your virginity?
not something I'd discuss with coworkers in an elevator.
and...
and...
you know, don't you?
a bit of a wasted third question.
cause the answer is "know what?"
okay, bear with me here.
because some people sometimes consider my thought processes complicated.
I'm into you, 'cause you're hot. And smart.
in that order, but both are needed.
photos can be retouched.
and House is an evil genius, which makes this photo suspicious.
and yet you're not suspicious.
which means either you're not smart enough to be suspicious, in which case,
I am less interested in you, or you're not suspicious because you know this is actually a doctored photo of House.
in which case, I am more interested in you.
but I am wasting my time, because you know this is a game we are playing on you, and I am busted.
and I'm screwed.
I know the photo's a fake.
and I know this is a game.
I'm sorry.
too bad.
good-bye.
so you knew that I wasn't gonna give you anything worthwhile?
and you were never gonna give me anything worthwhile.
then why did you bother coming out with me?
I... wanted to screw with House.
by wasting my time?
that doesn't make sense.
no, uh...
there must be another reason.
is it okay if I sit back down here?
your heartbeat's out of control.
we need to surgically sever the connection between your heart and brain.
we believe it's necessary, but you need to know the ramifications.
you'll never be able to feel angina.
you may not know if you have a heart attack.
you may not be able to get help in time.
where are my regular doctors?
regular doctors?
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.
why aren't they telling me this?
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley. And this is Dr. Taub.
what are you talking about?
I've never seen you before in my life.
we can't do the surgery.
we're back to where we started. Visual agnosia.
we need to reexamine neurological disorders.
something's slowly progressing.
this isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is.
it's a new symptom, intermittence.
it's irrelevant.
since when is a new symptom irrelevant?
since it points towards the same disease.
intermittence can fit with Romano-Ward.
we still need to do a sympathectomy.
maybe we missed something.
toxins. - When?
when you checked every bottle, every can, every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?
maybe there is a batch of toxic paint that he used up a few months ago.
then he would have been sick months ago, not now.
he's lost weight since he got here.
that's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.
it's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?
so where you gonna get this old paint?
city dump?
on his old paintings.
we know he hasn't sold one in ages.
but there weren't many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.
if you're wrong...
he could drop dead from Romano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?
just give me a few hours.
you got one.
I need to talk to him alone.
it's about your work. Your paintings.
I need to look at all the ones you've sold recently.
honey, can you give us a minute?
to talk about your paintings?
Brandon, please. Tell me what's going on.
I've only sold two paintings in the last three years.
since we met.
one was to my cousin.
I've been making money enrolling in drug trials.
two, three at a time.
why did you lie to me?
I wanna be, uh...
the way you look at me. The way it makes me feel.
uh, I wanna be... what you see...
when you look at me.
you think I'm that shallow?
when I look at you... I see you.
so...
where are the ones you didn't sell?
it's not the paint, it's the drugs.
he's not on the drugs.
I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months.
they're normal April, June, and August.
but they're distorted May, July, September.
every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously.
the statin was one month on, one month off.
I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.
they're hiding under the stairs.
in the fat? That doesn't make sense.
these drugs aren't fat soluble.
I said stairs, not closet.
what was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?
I'm not sure. I think
antacid.
how do you know? - It makes sense.
also, I'm looking at the file.
yes?
it's Dr. House.
uh, wake him up. We're done.
no, no. - He says he needs surgery, but not this one.
did he give any specifics?
abdominal surgery to remove A... bezoar.
it's like a hairball, but it's made up of undigested food.
you can get it if your stomach acid's low, which Brandon's was because of an experimental antacid.
fruit and vegetable fibers and skins get stuck together and form a ball.
it gets sticky, ferments, grows.
it starts sucking up some of the pills he'd taken.
some are never heard from again.
but some get released.
for the last week, it's basically been giving him massive doses of all three at once.
and that is why I won't let Cameron buy a cat.
he should be fine.
are you glad he told you the truth?
yes... of course.
but...
were you happier before you knew?
about ten more feet.
I do know what it looks like, so maybe this whole blindfold thing
Shh. - My gift, my rules. Bump.
you ready?
do you like it?
baby, are you okay?
we need to talk.
damn.
so you didn't get anything.
nothin'.
we probably overstepped.
you're really not the cheerleader type.
on the other hand,
I figured she probably wouldn't figure me as the "photoshopping" a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper type either.
heh, yeah. About that.
I took a little trip to your alma mater.
you took a little trip 150 miles.
online, by phone.
I meant I did research.
that's a real photo, isn't it?
wow, that is humiliating.
there was a girl.
even more so.
that's too bad.
you wanted her to see you in a different light, and...
not only didn't she see it...
she didn't even believe it was possible.
you know, people hate people who have theories about people.
you want me to back off?
would you?
I barely know you.
I'm bored of cheap and cheerful. I want expensive sadness. I want you to be crazy 'cause you're stupid, baby when you're sane.
Yeah.
come back to bed.
gimme a minute.
you get 20 seconds.
Hey, what are you?
female, late 20s, tonic clonic seizure.
duration of the seizure?
a little over three minutes.
does your friend have a history of epilepsy?
she never said.
my name is Dr. Cameron. You're in a hospital. We're gonna take care of you.
what's her name? - I don't know.
I have a case I think you might be interested in.
not now.
a 26-year-old woman had a tonic clonic seizure.
what about me speeding away says to you "let's chat"?
history of fatigue, and two years ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.
she's diabetic.
no, she's not. And she has no history of hypertension.
it can wait.
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.
Oh, my goodness.
I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.
I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier.
I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?
I had a breakfast meeting at mickey's diner with the mercy people to tell them...
I'm coming back to work here.
sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me.
donut's a nice touch.
it's just a way of saying "welcome back.
the seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological.
or the ecstasy you found in her system.
according to Dr. Hadley, the patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so.
what does thirteen know about it?
uh, apparently she was with the patient last night.
at 3: 00 A. M.
Oh, yeah.
penthouse forum meets medical mystery.
maybe there is a god.
empty transient sex?
I've been waiting for you to spiral out of control ever since you got your huntington's diagnosis, but this is more than I dared hope for.
patient's seizure resulted from dehydration, which resulted from a cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.
mystery solved. - Wait.
were you doing drugs?
not diagnostically relevant.
depends what we're trying to diagnose.
it's how steep of a spiral you're on.
our patient hemorrhaged into her eye two years ago.
also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed.
her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.
is he in this room?
because if he's not, I don't care what he thinks.
unless he's a she and she was there last night too, in which case I care very deeply.
what if the eye problem wasn't with her vein, but with her blood?
would explain why she seized, why she's always tired.
she parties till 3: 00 A. M. That's why she's always tired.
yet you seem fine.
she's visited four other doctors in the past year.
none of them found anything.
she's a hypochondriac who drank too much.
blood clots could explain everything.
makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too many platelets.
sorry.
thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis.
and no, that one wasn't a metaphor.
suck out some marrow. That one was.
I like to watch.
I can handle this alone.
you've already handled it.
that's why you need a chaperone.
of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone.
so feel free to ignore me.
you know, if you'rein the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering.
you'll have to excuse Dr. House. He mistakes immaturity for edginess.
you're Dr. House?
I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan.
you had sex, then a seizure.
could be a particular position or activity that set it off.
that sounds like a valid medical theory, doesn't it?
I'm really sorry. Just ignore him.
whatever you think we did, we did. And then some.
lights on or off?
do you have a medical rationalization for that one?
light sensitivity. - On.
figured she had more shame than that.
did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals?
she's, uh, pretty direct about what she wants.
I'm learning so much.
okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten.
don't answer.
finally got one right.
you want to investigate him because he ate a donut?
he claimed he had a morning meeting at mickey's diner.
Wilson loves mickey's diner.
he has the french toast tower whenever he sets foot in the door.
there's no way he would've come to work wanting more carbs.
he lied to me. I need to know why.
what do you think you'll find out?
I'm worried that he might be a spy.
he's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.
I'm just not sure if he's working for hirohito or the new England patriots.
you played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.
I need something to lord over him, a lie
he didn't try to retaliate. He moralized.
he always moralized.
he always moralized and got even. He hasn't fired back.
things always change.
and that sucks.
Yeah.
find out where he was.
should've known it wasn't a coincidence.
found your letters.
you recognized House's name.
and you're the first patient I've seen who actually enjoyed being accosted by him.
I would've told you, but.
what exactly would you have told me?
that you slept with me to get to house?
that you've been trying to get him to take your case for over a year?
I'm sick. No one even wrote back.
you used me.
you used me.
my motives were clear.
you might've figured out my motives faster if you bothered to ask my name.
I followed you to that bar because I wanted to talk to you.
see if you'd help me get to House.
I didn't expect you to be so aggressive.
was that seizure even real?
why would I fake a symptom?
it would just make it harder for house to diagnose me.
there's nothing to diagnose. Your biopsy results are negative.
then it's something else.
get dressed. I'm discharging you.
house admitted me. He obviously thinks.
house is using you as an excuse to stick his nose in my personal life.
I'm tired all the time.
some nights I fall asleep at 10: 00 and wake up at noon, still tired.
every doctor I see tells me there's nothing wrong.
and that proves what, exactly? That they're wrong, or that you're wrong?
Oh, come on. You expect me to believe
sit back. Deep breaths. Try and relax.
get the paddles. She's gonna crash.
damn.
we had to use paddles to stabilize the patient's heart.
eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue.
sounds like a real case to me.
I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?
you're just upset because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, throbbing...diagnostic skills.
drugs would explain everything.
this morning, you rejected drugs.
that's when I thought that thirteen was right and was just jerking her around.
cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.
great. - What?
that means that something she did at my place set this off.
either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet.
and that means my place needs to be searched.
now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.
patient's dad had bypass surgery.
means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound.
that was much less convoluted than what you just said.
I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.
who could pick a lock?
I'll go.
make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.
you're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.
think you can pick a lock faster than me?
no need to pick.
nice. Steal from your employees.
never.
I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.
always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.
give me my key. - Don't have your key.
you expect me to believe that you hired Lucas to investigate everyone except for me?
waste of money. I already know everything about you.
thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the patient's. Check it for drugs.
I call shotgun on the bedroom.
you know that I stole a car when I was a teenager.
you know that my mom has Alzheimer's.
you know nothing else.
want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?
not needy. Just don't buy it.
you always want more information about people.
look where we are. Purse is clean.
last night wasn't the first time that thirteen brought home some strange.
if you found her diary.
no toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories.
first time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless...
you think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy?
there are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.
people interest me. Conversations don't.
because conversations go both ways.
like thirteen.
brown recluse. Found it at your apartment.
their venom can cause seizures and heart problems.
unless the ultrasound showed anything. - No.
what room did you find it in?
bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing.
I don't have a bidet.
spider's not the only interesting thing I found.
Yeah, my inhaler is fascinating.
it's got its own extensive online following.
you have asthma?
when I was a kid. It started acting up again when I moved into my new place.
you moved? - Who cares?
he doesn't. He's just surprised he didn't know.
you withhold things other people would never bother to.
the move, a little wheeze, whatever you thought was in my pocket instead of your inhaler.
maybe I should make a return trip to your place.
spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the patient was actually bitten by a spider.
I'll do the exam.
don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate.
it'd be better if a woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way.
I need you to stand up and take off your gown.
I think I would've felt a spider biting me.
not necessarily.
you really need those after everything we did the other night?
the other night I wasn't your doctor.
how long are you gonna stay mad at me?
how long are you going to be here?
okay, then.
look...
I really had no intention of ever seeing you again.
so... Having me end up here is a little less than ideal. I get it.
but... We just met.
how'd you know you didn't want to see me again?
it's nothing personal.
I'm just really not that into repeat performances.
I figured I wasn't the first girl you cruised.
why is that?
you're awfully good at it.
you'd think with all that experience that I'd be better than a seven.
we just met. We were both drunk.
not like there wasn't potential.
little more practice for the both of us, I'd say we're looking at a nine.
easy.
but that would require a repeat performance.
you didn't have to move your hand.
I didn't. My hand's on your hip. You don't feel that?
no. What does that mean?
it means it's not a spider bite.
blood test confirms low potassium levels. Explains the numbness in her hip.
it's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.
which you just wasted with that comment about my comments.
low potassium means her heart problem was a symptom of a kidney problem.
what caused the kidney problem?
could be I. G. A. Nephropathy.
not without blood in the urine.
P. S. A. G. N. ?
not with normal blood pressure.
renal tubular acidosis.
her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood.
excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.
if it's rta, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications.
ct her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis.
what's he doing now?
he's playing that carjacking video game.
he'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.
maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.
like... just about anything.
you don't think it's that.
I don't think it's just about anything?
you don't think it's about anything trivial.
if you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.
maybe he's seeing a shrink.
that does not look like a pizza delivery.
doesn't matter if it isn't. Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.
there's eight units in this building.
there's got to be a pervert like me living in at least one of them.
Yes, because you represent one out of every eight people living in this country.
apparently he has developed a taste for pizza.
Ah, things change.
ct shows one more calcification near the superior pyramid on the left kidney.
see it.
that, um, thing you were hoping house didn't find at your place.
I, uh, I found it.
he did the cag test two weeks ago.
a number this high means you have less time than you thought.
it's understandable you'd be upset.
doesn't mean you have to self-destruct.
it's not noble for you to protect me from house if you're just gonna judge
there are things you should be doing.
working out, improving balance and coordination.
Yeah, that sounds like a blast.
I'm having fun.
cramming as much life into my life as I can.
you're doing drugs. Staying up all night, having sex with strangers.
it sounds fun to me. Good night.
close the incisions.
she won't even have a scar.
her o2 stats are dropping.
did you nick something?
procedure was clean. Bp's strong.
well, she's not breathing. We need to intubate.
the breathing problem started after we fixed her kidney problem.
means the rta isn't the underlying cause.
Where's thirteen?
traffic's bad. She's probably just.
not here.
it's not her lungs.
no masses, no infiltrates.
lungs are working, but she still can't breathe.
distribution plant can't distribute if it's not getting deliveries.
if her lungs are fine, maybe the problem's in the supply line. Airway collapse.
that could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.
there's only one way to find out if her air way failed.
make it happen again.
stick thirteen's carpet cleaner on a treadmill.
methacholine challenge.
and someone find the carpet.
exam going on. 15 minutes.
good morning, Dr. Hadley.
just spoke to my brother.
and by brother, you mean?
I mean my parents'other son.
same dad.
got a call last week from your P. I. You lied.
you did have me investigated.
you've been taunting the team with what you've learned, but you never came after me.
means you couldn't find anything.
you're right.
that's because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or even vaguely interesting since you were 17.
and that's just sad.
I found her in the clinic giving herself iv fluids.
at least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.
she has a fresh night club stamp on her wrist.
she's in no condition to practice.
unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be.
I want her to take a drug test.
you can't make me do that.
but I can suspend you until you do.
because she went to a nightclub in her free time?
or because she had sex in her free time?
patient was undergoing routine surgery for rta.
didn't need thirteen here for that.
and I don't need you making my employees punch a clockor pee in a cup.
let's go. Come on.
thank you.
by the way, the surgery was not routine.
patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential.
you're fired.
what? You just defended me.
no, I just prevented you from getting a drug test.
probably saved your career.
I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit.
I don't have a drug habit.
the slutty party girl is fun till she pukeson your shoes.
then she's just a pain in the ass.
I haven't sat on this couch for four months.
it remembers my cheeks.
I miss this. - Me too.
me trying to work. You interrupting.
Oh, come on. Your patients could wait five minutes. Get me caught up.
come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby?
did you meet someone? - Actually, yes.
I sort of started dating someone.
great. What does she do?
is she... an actress?
no. Why would you think that?
I just figured you'd want something a little more... exciting.
she's not...
you're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her.
she's... a prostitute.
used to be.
she made some mistakes.
single mom, had some drug issues.
but... she's so smart.
she wants to go to law school. And...
I told her I'd help her with tuition.
how long have you known her?
Oh, I knew you'd be like this.
I asked a question. - House...
you are a drug addict. You go to prostitutes. You can't be judgmental.
and yet.
please, don't do this to me.
I was hurting, and I wanted to feel good.
I didn't expect it to go this way. I...
Amber... said that she wanted me to move on.
that she wanted me to...
be happy. And...
Debbie makes me happy.
if you're happy, I'm...
I heard.
Yeah. I'm looking for my ticket back.
sorry if I upset you.
I didn't want to invade your privacy. - It wasn't your fault.
can you get me caught up?
think you're gonna find something we didn't?
it's good for the patient. Good for me.
films are clean. We ruled out hypertension.
guys have her on a treadmill running a methacholine challenge.
and I still think you've been acting like an idiot.
I know.
did you talk about whether this lung field looks a little dark?
it's probably just over-exposed.
or her diaphragm's a little flat.
could be a sign of hyper inflation.
suggests a pulmonary obstruction.
lung cysts.
they wouldn't show upon an x-ray.
treadmill test isn't gonna close her airway. It'll make her lungs explode.
her throat's fine.
we made her airway collapse, but it's not collapsed.
you ruptured a cyst! Her lung collapsed.
breath sounds on both sides.
move.
trachea's deviating to the left.
nice.
chest CT confirmed multiple lung cysts, one of which burst during the treadmill test.
luckily, thirteen figured out the problem and was there to re-inflate her lung.
lung cysts plus all her other symptoms could be amyloidosis, which we can manage.
or pulmonary fibrosis which. - Thank you.
my employees can take care of it from here.
we need to biopsy the cysts.
you fired me because I screwed up.
I just proved I can pull my weight.
all you proved is you know how to make an entrance.
house, she deserves another shot. She found the cysts, saved the patient.
who wouldn't have needed saving if thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.
give her her job back, House.
or what? You're gonna quit?
go do the biopsy.
I'm sorry.
how much clearer do I need to make this?
what does that even mean,"dating a hooker"?
he's an idiot with a messiah complex.
savior to all who need saving. That's why his first wife had a wooden leg.
second wife was canadian.
he's the one who needs to be saved. - From you or the ho?
the ho's just using him for his money.
wait. Bad example.
normally in these situations, I'd follow the girl, find out something embarrassing about her to show him.
but since that's our starting position...
proceed directly to the leg-breaking.
I'm not breaking her legs. She probably has a pimp.
or, at least, an older brother. Or a younger brother. Or over protective sister.
find her, find her family, find client number nine.
just get me something I can use to force her to back off.
sorry to interrupt your meeting, mannix.
here's the result from the lung biopsy.
why not men?
you're bisexual.
if you were just being self-destructive, you'd be having random sex with men.
better chance of getting assaulted, catching a disease.
if this were just about getting laid, it'd be a lot easier to pick up men.
or ugly girls.
this woman's hot.
which means you like the challenge, the conquest.
it's the control that gets you off.
and controlling women is as close as you can get to controlling what's gonna happen to you.
here I thought I was just into boobs.
instead of getting sweaty with a stranger, why don't you try taking it to the next level?
play god.
tell a girl that she's gotten years to live.
she has lam.
okay.
this is not a test.
you're not getting your job back if you can.
I know what it's like to get this news, and no one should have to get it from you.
the biopsy of your lung cyst showed smooth muscle cells.
that's indicative of a disease called lam.
what do you do for that?
surgery to remove the cysts.
but... they'll come back.
little by little, the cysts replace healthy lung tissue until your lungs stop working.
I'm gonna die.
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
they removed all the cysts they could.
that should help you breathe better.
how long until the cysts come back?
we don't know exactly. I'm sorry.
stop saying you're sorry.
I know you're scared.
I don't know what I feel.
you're gonna be numbfor a few more days.
then you'll go home and cry for a few weeks.
and then you get angry.
start telling yourself nothing matters anymore.
you start doing stupid things.
maybe you go out to bars and pick up a bunch of women.
you're...
how long do you have?
maybe a little more than you. Maybe a little less.
I'll race you.
I was thinking maybe I'd come back later.
sounds good.
Oh, god. What's going on?
all her blood counts are down. It's a new symptom. Aplastic anemia.
does the word "fired" have some whole other definition that I'm not aware of?
I don't work for you. Fine. Don't pay me.
just let me finish out this case.
so you like her now that she's dying.
what happens if she stops dying?
there's no danger of that right now.
if we don't figure out what's wrong with her, she's got days, not years.
aplastic anemia takes lam off the table.
unfortunately, none of our other choices are any better.
PNH with some sort of respiratory infection.
best case gives her 12 years.
or fast-moving langerhans. - A few months.
or mastocytosis, which can cause systemic shock and kill her in days.
go. Test for everything. Not you.
you're just a visitor.
how's your patient?
she doesn't have langerhans. - That's good.
actually, a cancer diagnosis would be good news right now.
do you think... I'm boring?
Yes.
you're saying that just to screw with me. - Yeah.
why would you expect anything else?
I expect House to pull my strings.
I expect Cameron to make me feel better.
I expect the new team to kiss my ass.
and I expect you to be honest, 'cause you don't give a crap.
Yes, you're boring. That speech was boring.
thanks so much.
you don't let other people'sproblems affect you.
you don't let your own problems affect you.
and it's the screw-ups that make us interesting.
you're never out of control. Which is good, and... boring.
never losing control also means you're never putting yourself out there.
never pushing your limits.
on the other hand, you do have a tattoo, so...
maybe I'm wrong.
Hallelujah stop and stare. When will jesus find us here could we survive. How can you pretend to know. Who you are or where you will go. When you just get by and dream dreaming all the time away.
I'm glad you're here.
and dream dreaming all your time away. She needs a bone marrow transplant.
test results are back? What's she positive for?
nothing. But we've got a donor match.
jumping to a transplant when we don't know what she
I know she has a blood disorder.
could be pnh. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or leukemia.
she needs a bone marrow transplant. Or thalassemia.
she needs a bone marrow. - yeah, I get it.
but she'll never survive total body irradiation.
so we don't radiate her.
her marrow's nearly wiped outalready. Counts almost zero.
"almost" being the key word.
the new marrow would attack the old marrow. She'll die from graft-versus-host.
you got a better idea?
she trusts you. Go get her consent.
sometimes I find out things you'd rather not know.
this was in his trash.
he's using.
you're back.
genius.
damn. I knew the fake works was too much.
well, you had no choice.
where were you gonna go after fake hooker girlfriend?
how did you knowhe was outside?
cane prints.
I'm actually kind of insulted.
no way I'm a drug addict, but you completely buy that I fell in love with a prostitute?
you played to your strengths.
by which I mean you played to your weaknesses.
Oh, my god.
you invoked your dead girlfriend's name to sell me.
you're my hero.
best $30 I ever spent.
it's 30? Did you keep her number?
unfortunately, I killed her and buried her in the basement.
shame.
hungry? - Yeah.
so, seriously.
where were you the other morning?
Ugh, don't make me do this again.
it has nothing to do with you.
then tell me.
we're going bowling on monday.
I'm coming over to play poker this weekend.
nothing's changed. You have to trust that.
okay.
you're gonna keep following me, aren't you?
it's what we do.
be outside my apartment at 8: 00 tonight.
she said yes to the transplant. - Good.
you're in a downward spiral of destruction.
I can stop.
you're gonna keep spiraling.
keep screwing around.
keep slashing away at every person who tries to help until no one tries to help anymore.
till you hit bottom. Till you're dead.
until then... I can use you.
you're hiring me back?
you did good work.
I did good work yesterday, and I was still fired. What changed?
you wanted me to spend time with her.
see if I could still make a connection.
you connected with a diagnosis, not with her.
you're trying to save me, trying to control me.
you're doing exactly what you think.
cracks.
you're lips are cracked.
you been using your inhaler lately?
allergies. Don't deflect. You always deflect.
did she cry?
when you told her that she was gonna die, did she cry?
she... got upset. She.
were there tears?
no.
chopping an onion releases a mist of syn-propanethial-s-oxide, a chemical irritant which causes people to have a very predictable reaction.
she has no tears.
it was either this or put on brian's song.
I didn't have time to stop by wilson's.
she has sjogren's.
it attacks the glands that produce tears and saliva.
also, by the way, causes lung cysts and rta.
it doesn't cause bleeding.
it's like you and men.
just 'cause you usually don't, doesn't mean you can't.
and it doesn't cause cracked lips in other people.
lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding groundfor a fungus like candida.
your asthma inhaler did the same for you.
wiped out your mouth's immune system.
so she's got what I've got.
just the opportunistic infection, not the underlying condition.
another life saved by girl-on-girl action.
I'm gonna be okay?
you're gonna be okay.
methylprednisolone to get the sjogren's under control.
and some artificial tears to maximize the visual impact of this moment.
Spencer's gonna be fine.
and I hear you got your job back.
I'm gonna keep standing here until you say something.
I feel alone.
and she hasn't gone anywhere.
she gets to live.
I'm gonna go home. I'm tired.
what do you think?
Oh, my god!
you guys shop here too?
best nipples in princeton.
why are you here?
because he ate the donut.
I'm so sorry. He must've followed me.
I'm sure.
well, you're clearly not pregnant, so either you're buying this as a gift, or this is some kind of weird "if you build it, they will come" moment.
I'm adopting a baby.
she asked me to be a character reference. That's where I was the other morning.
I'm sorry. I couldn't betray her confidence.
I didn't want anyone else to know in case I didn't get approved.
today, I did.
it's a dark road and a dark way that leads to my house and the word says you're never gonna find me there oh no are you gonna congratulate me?
if you're happy, I'm...
it didn't get there by itself. There's a feeling. But you're not feeling it at all. There's a meaning. But you're not listening anymore...
Yeah.
come back to bed.
gimme a minute.
you get 20 seconds.
Hey, what are you?
female, late 20s, tonic clonic seizure.
duration of the seizure?
a little over three minutes.
does your friend have a history of epilepsy?
she never said.
my name is Dr. Cameron. You're in a hospital. We're gonna take care of you.
what's her name? - I don't know.
I have a case I think you might be interested in.
not now.
a 26-year-old woman had a tonic clonic seizure.
what about me speeding away says to you "let's chat"?
history of fatigue, and two years ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.
she's diabetic.
no, she's not. And she has no history of hypertension.
it can wait.
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.
Oh, my goodness.
I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.
I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier.
I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?
I had a breakfast meeting at mickey's diner with the mercy people to tell them...
I'm coming back to work here.
sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me.
donut's a nice touch.
it's just a way of saying "welcome back.
the seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological.
or the ecstasy you found in her system.
according to Dr. Hadley, the patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so.
what does thirteen know about it?
uh, apparently she was with the patient last night.
at 3: 00 A. M.
Oh, yeah.
penthouse forum meets medical mystery.
maybe there is a god.
empty transient sex?
I've been waiting for you to spiral out of control ever since you got your huntington's diagnosis, but this is more than I dared hope for.
patient's seizure resulted from dehydration, which resulted from a cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.
mystery solved. - Wait.
were you doing drugs?
not diagnostically relevant.
depends what we're trying to diagnose.
it's how steep of a spiral you're on.
our patient hemorrhaged into her eye two years ago.
also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed.
her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.
is he in this room?
because if he's not, I don't care what he thinks.
unless he's a she and she was there last night too, in which case I care very deeply.
what if the eye problem wasn't with her vein, but with her blood?
would explain why she seized, why she's always tired.
she parties till 3: 00 A. M. That's why she's always tired.
yet you seem fine.
she's visited four other doctors in the past year.
none of them found anything.
she's a hypochondriac who drank too much.
blood clots could explain everything.
makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too many platelets.
sorry.
thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis.
and no, that one wasn't a metaphor.
suck out some marrow. That one was.
I like to watch.
I can handle this alone.
you've already handled it.
that's why you need a chaperone.
of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone.
so feel free to ignore me.
you know, if you'rein the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering.
you'll have to excuse Dr. House. He mistakes immaturity for edginess.
you're Dr. House?
I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan.
you had sex, then a seizure.
could be a particular position or activity that set it off.
that sounds like a valid medical theory, doesn't it?
I'm really sorry. Just ignore him.
whatever you think we did, we did. And then some.
lights on or off?
do you have a medical rationalization for that one?
light sensitivity. - On.
figured she had more shame than that.
did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals?
she's, uh, pretty direct about what she wants.
I'm learning so much.
okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten.
don't answer.
finally got one right.
you want to investigate him because he ate a donut?
he claimed he had a morning meeting at mickey's diner.
Wilson loves mickey's diner.
he has the french toast tower whenever he sets foot in the door.
there's no way he would've come to work wanting more carbs.
he lied to me. I need to know why.
what do you think you'll find out?
I'm worried that he might be a spy.
he's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.
I'm just not sure if he's working for hirohito or the new England patriots.
you played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.
I need something to lord over him, a lie
he didn't try to retaliate. He moralized.
he always moralized.
he always moralized and got even. He hasn't fired back.
things always change.
and that sucks.
Yeah.
find out where he was.
should've known it wasn't a coincidence.
found your letters.
you recognized House's name.
and you're the first patient I've seen who actually enjoyed being accosted by him.
I would've told you, but.
what exactly would you have told me?
that you slept with me to get to house?
that you've been trying to get him to take your case for over a year?
I'm sick. No one even wrote back.
you used me.
you used me.
my motives were clear.
you might've figured out my motives faster if you bothered to ask my name.
I followed you to that bar because I wanted to talk to you.
see if you'd help me get to House.
I didn't expect you to be so aggressive.
was that seizure even real?
why would I fake a symptom?
it would just make it harder for house to diagnose me.
there's nothing to diagnose. Your biopsy results are negative.
then it's something else.
get dressed. I'm discharging you.
house admitted me. He obviously thinks.
house is using you as an excuse to stick his nose in my personal life.
I'm tired all the time.
some nights I fall asleep at 10: 00 and wake up at noon, still tired.
every doctor I see tells me there's nothing wrong.
and that proves what, exactly? That they're wrong, or that you're wrong?
Oh, come on. You expect me to believe
sit back. Deep breaths. Try and relax.
get the paddles. She's gonna crash.
damn.
we had to use paddles to stabilize the patient's heart.
eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue.
sounds like a real case to me.
I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?
you're just upset because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, throbbing...diagnostic skills.
drugs would explain everything.
this morning, you rejected drugs.
that's when I thought that thirteen was right and was just jerking her around.
cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.
great. - What?
that means that something she did at my place set this off.
either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet.
and that means my place needs to be searched.
now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.
patient's dad had bypass surgery.
means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound.
that was much less convoluted than what you just said.
I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.
who could pick a lock?
I'll go.
make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.
you're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.
think you can pick a lock faster than me?
no need to pick.
nice. Steal from your employees.
never.
I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.
always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.
give me my key. - Don't have your key.
you expect me to believe that you hired Lucas to investigate everyone except for me?
waste of money. I already know everything about you.
thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the patient's. Check it for drugs.
I call shotgun on the bedroom.
you know that I stole a car when I was a teenager.
you know that my mom has Alzheimer's.
you know nothing else.
want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?
not needy. Just don't buy it.
you always want more information about people.
look where we are. Purse is clean.
last night wasn't the first time that thirteen brought home some strange.
if you found her diary.
no toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories.
first time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless...
you think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy?
there are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.
people interest me. Conversations don't.
because conversations go both ways.
like thirteen.
brown recluse. Found it at your apartment.
their venom can cause seizures and heart problems.
unless the ultrasound showed anything. - No.
what room did you find it in?
bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing.
I don't have a bidet.
spider's not the only interesting thing I found.
Yeah, my inhaler is fascinating.
it's got its own extensive online following.
you have asthma?
when I was a kid. It started acting up again when I moved into my new place.
you moved? - Who cares?
he doesn't. He's just surprised he didn't know.
you withhold things other people would never bother to.
the move, a little wheeze, whatever you thought was in my pocket instead of your inhaler.
maybe I should make a return trip to your place.
spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the patient was actually bitten by a spider.
I'll do the exam.
don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate.
it'd be better if a woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way.
I need you to stand up and take off your gown.
I think I would've felt a spider biting me.
not necessarily.
you really need those after everything we did the other night?
the other night I wasn't your doctor.
how long are you gonna stay mad at me?
how long are you going to be here?
okay, then.
look...
I really had no intention of ever seeing you again.
so... Having me end up here is a little less than ideal. I get it.
but... We just met.
how'd you know you didn't want to see me again?
it's nothing personal.
I'm just really not that into repeat performances.
I figured I wasn't the first girl you cruised.
why is that?
you're awfully good at it.
you'd think with all that experience that I'd be better than a seven.
we just met. We were both drunk.
not like there wasn't potential.
little more practice for the both of us, I'd say we're looking at a nine.
easy.
but that would require a repeat performance.
you didn't have to move your hand.
I didn't. My hand's on your hip. You don't feel that?
no. What does that mean?
it means it's not a spider bite.
blood test confirms low potassium levels. Explains the numbness in her hip.
it's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.
which you just wasted with that comment about my comments.
low potassium means her heart problem was a symptom of a kidney problem.
what caused the kidney problem?
could be I. G. A. Nephropathy.
not without blood in the urine.
P. S. A. G. N. ?
not with normal blood pressure.
renal tubular acidosis.
her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood.
excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.
if it's rta, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications.
ct her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis.
what's he doing now?
he's playing that carjacking video game.
he'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.
maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.
like... just about anything.
you don't think it's that.
I don't think it's just about anything?
you don't think it's about anything trivial.
if you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.
maybe he's seeing a shrink.
that does not look like a pizza delivery.
doesn't matter if it isn't. Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.
there's eight units in this building.
there's got to be a pervert like me living in at least one of them.
Yes, because you represent one out of every eight people living in this country.
apparently he has developed a taste for pizza.
Ah, things change.
ct shows one more calcification near the superior pyramid on the left kidney.
see it.
that, um, thing you were hoping house didn't find at your place.
I, uh, I found it.
he did the cag test two weeks ago.
a number this high means you have less time than you thought.
it's understandable you'd be upset.
doesn't mean you have to self-destruct.
it's not noble for you to protect me from house if you're just gonna judge
there are things you should be doing.
working out, improving balance and coordination.
Yeah, that sounds like a blast.
I'm having fun.
cramming as much life into my life as I can.
you're doing drugs. Staying up all night, having sex with strangers.
it sounds fun to me. Good night.
close the incisions.
she won't even have a scar.
her o2 stats are dropping.
did you nick something?
procedure was clean. Bp's strong.
well, she's not breathing. We need to intubate.
the breathing problem started after we fixed her kidney problem.
means the rta isn't the underlying cause.
Where's thirteen?
traffic's bad. She's probably just.
not here.
it's not her lungs.
no masses, no infiltrates.
lungs are working, but she still can't breathe.
distribution plant can't distribute if it's not getting deliveries.
if her lungs are fine, maybe the problem's in the supply line. Airway collapse.
that could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.
there's only one way to find out if her air way failed.
make it happen again.
stick thirteen's carpet cleaner on a treadmill.
methacholine challenge.
and someone find the carpet.
exam going on. 15 minutes.
good morning, Dr. Hadley.
just spoke to my brother.
and by brother, you mean?
I mean my parents'other son.
same dad.
got a call last week from your P. I. You lied.
you did have me investigated.
you've been taunting the team with what you've learned, but you never came after me.
means you couldn't find anything.
you're right.
that's because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or even vaguely interesting since you were 17.
and that's just sad.
I found her in the clinic giving herself iv fluids.
at least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.
she has a fresh night club stamp on her wrist.
she's in no condition to practice.
unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be.
I want her to take a drug test.
you can't make me do that.
but I can suspend you until you do.
because she went to a nightclub in her free time?
or because she had sex in her free time?
patient was undergoing routine surgery for rta.
didn't need thirteen here for that.
and I don't need you making my employees punch a clockor pee in a cup.
let's go. Come on.
thank you.
by the way, the surgery was not routine.
patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential.
you're fired.
what? You just defended me.
no, I just prevented you from getting a drug test.
probably saved your career.
I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit.
I don't have a drug habit.
the slutty party girl is fun till she pukeson your shoes.
then she's just a pain in the ass.
I haven't sat on this couch for four months.
it remembers my cheeks.
I miss this. - Me too.
me trying to work. You interrupting.
Oh, come on. Your patients could wait five minutes. Get me caught up.
come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby?
did you meet someone? - Actually, yes.
I sort of started dating someone.
great. What does she do?
is she... an actress?
no. Why would you think that?
I just figured you'd want something a little more... exciting.
she's not...
you're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her.
she's... a prostitute.
used to be.
she made some mistakes.
single mom, had some drug issues.
but... she's so smart.
she wants to go to law school. And...
I told her I'd help her with tuition.
how long have you known her?
Oh, I knew you'd be like this.
I asked a question. - House...
you are a drug addict. You go to prostitutes. You can't be judgmental.
and yet.
please, don't do this to me.
I was hurting, and I wanted to feel good.
I didn't expect it to go this way. I...
Amber... said that she wanted me to move on.
that she wanted me to...
be happy. And...
Debbie makes me happy.
if you're happy, I'm...
I heard.
Yeah. I'm looking for my ticket back.
sorry if I upset you.
I didn't want to invade your privacy. - It wasn't your fault.
can you get me caught up?
think you're gonna find something we didn't?
it's good for the patient. Good for me.
films are clean. We ruled out hypertension.
guys have her on a treadmill running a methacholine challenge.
and I still think you've been acting like an idiot.
I know.
did you talk about whether this lung field looks a little dark?
it's probably just over-exposed.
or her diaphragm's a little flat.
could be a sign of hyper inflation.
suggests a pulmonary obstruction.
lung cysts.
they wouldn't show upon an x-ray.
treadmill test isn't gonna close her airway. It'll make her lungs explode.
her throat's fine.
we made her airway collapse, but it's not collapsed.
you ruptured a cyst! Her lung collapsed.
breath sounds on both sides.
move.
trachea's deviating to the left.
nice.
chest CT confirmed multiple lung cysts, one of which burst during the treadmill test.
luckily, thirteen figured out the problem and was there to re-inflate her lung.
lung cysts plus all her other symptoms could be amyloidosis, which we can manage.
or pulmonary fibrosis which. - Thank you.
my employees can take care of it from here.
we need to biopsy the cysts.
you fired me because I screwed up.
I just proved I can pull my weight.
all you proved is you know how to make an entrance.
house, she deserves another shot. She found the cysts, saved the patient.
who wouldn't have needed saving if thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.
give her her job back, House.
or what? You're gonna quit?
go do the biopsy.
I'm sorry.
how much clearer do I need to make this?
what does that even mean,"dating a hooker"?
he's an idiot with a messiah complex.
savior to all who need saving. That's why his first wife had a wooden leg.
second wife was canadian.
he's the one who needs to be saved. - From you or the ho?
the ho's just using him for his money.
wait. Bad example.
normally in these situations, I'd follow the girl, find out something embarrassing about her to show him.
but since that's our starting position...
proceed directly to the leg-breaking.
I'm not breaking her legs. She probably has a pimp.
or, at least, an older brother. Or a younger brother. Or over protective sister.
find her, find her family, find client number nine.
just get me something I can use to force her to back off.
sorry to interrupt your meeting, mannix.
here's the result from the lung biopsy.
why not men?
you're bisexual.
if you were just being self-destructive, you'd be having random sex with men.
better chance of getting assaulted, catching a disease.
if this were just about getting laid, it'd be a lot easier to pick up men.
or ugly girls.
this woman's hot.
which means you like the challenge, the conquest.
it's the control that gets you off.
and controlling women is as close as you can get to controlling what's gonna happen to you.
here I thought I was just into boobs.
instead of getting sweaty with a stranger, why don't you try taking it to the next level?
play god.
tell a girl that she's gotten years to live.
she has lam.
okay.
this is not a test.
you're not getting your job back if you can.
I know what it's like to get this news, and no one should have to get it from you.
the biopsy of your lung cyst showed smooth muscle cells.
that's indicative of a disease called lam.
what do you do for that?
surgery to remove the cysts.
but... they'll come back.
little by little, the cysts replace healthy lung tissue until your lungs stop working.
I'm gonna die.
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
they removed all the cysts they could.
that should help you breathe better.
how long until the cysts come back?
we don't know exactly. I'm sorry.
stop saying you're sorry.
I know you're scared.
I don't know what I feel.
you're gonna be numbfor a few more days.
then you'll go home and cry for a few weeks.
and then you get angry.
start telling yourself nothing matters anymore.
you start doing stupid things.
maybe you go out to bars and pick up a bunch of women.
you're...
how long do you have?
maybe a little more than you. Maybe a little less.
I'll race you.
I was thinking maybe I'd come back later.
sounds good.
Oh, god. What's going on?
all her blood counts are down. It's a new symptom. Aplastic anemia.
does the word "fired" have some whole other definition that I'm not aware of?
I don't work for you. Fine. Don't pay me.
just let me finish out this case.
so you like her now that she's dying.
what happens if she stops dying?
there's no danger of that right now.
if we don't figure out what's wrong with her, she's got days, not years.
aplastic anemia takes lam off the table.
unfortunately, none of our other choices are any better.
PNH with some sort of respiratory infection.
best case gives her 12 years.
or fast-moving langerhans. - A few months.
or mastocytosis, which can cause systemic shock and kill her in days.
go. Test for everything. Not you.
you're just a visitor.
how's your patient?
she doesn't have langerhans. - That's good.
actually, a cancer diagnosis would be good news right now.
do you think... I'm boring?
Yes.
you're saying that just to screw with me. - Yeah.
why would you expect anything else?
I expect House to pull my strings.
I expect Cameron to make me feel better.
I expect the new team to kiss my ass.
and I expect you to be honest, 'cause you don't give a crap.
Yes, you're boring. That speech was boring.
thanks so much.
you don't let other people'sproblems affect you.
you don't let your own problems affect you.
and it's the screw-ups that make us interesting.
you're never out of control. Which is good, and... boring.
never losing control also means you're never putting yourself out there.
never pushing your limits.
on the other hand, you do have a tattoo, so...
maybe I'm wrong.
Hallelujah stop and stare. When will jesus find us here could we survive. How can you pretend to know. Who you are or where you will go. When you just get by and dream dreaming all the time away.
I'm glad you're here.
and dream dreaming all your time away. She needs a bone marrow transplant.
test results are back? What's she positive for?
nothing. But we've got a donor match.
jumping to a transplant when we don't know what she
I know she has a blood disorder.
could be pnh. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or leukemia.
she needs a bone marrow transplant. Or thalassemia.
she needs a bone marrow. - yeah, I get it.
but she'll never survive total body irradiation.
so we don't radiate her.
her marrow's nearly wiped outalready. Counts almost zero.
"almost" being the key word.
the new marrow would attack the old marrow. She'll die from graft-versus-host.
you got a better idea?
she trusts you. Go get her consent.
sometimes I find out things you'd rather not know.
this was in his trash.
he's using.
you're back.
genius.
damn. I knew the fake works was too much.
well, you had no choice.
where were you gonna go after fake hooker girlfriend?
how did you knowhe was outside?
cane prints.
I'm actually kind of insulted.
no way I'm a drug addict, but you completely buy that I fell in love with a prostitute?
you played to your strengths.
by which I mean you played to your weaknesses.
Oh, my god.
you invoked your dead girlfriend's name to sell me.
you're my hero.
best $30 I ever spent.
it's 30? Did you keep her number?
unfortunately, I killed her and buried her in the basement.
shame.
hungry? - Yeah.
so, seriously.
where were you the other morning?
Ugh, don't make me do this again.
it has nothing to do with you.
then tell me.
we're going bowling on monday.
I'm coming over to play poker this weekend.
nothing's changed. You have to trust that.
okay.
you're gonna keep following me, aren't you?
it's what we do.
be outside my apartment at 8: 00 tonight.
she said yes to the transplant. - Good.
you're in a downward spiral of destruction.
I can stop.
you're gonna keep spiraling.
keep screwing around.
keep slashing away at every person who tries to help until no one tries to help anymore.
till you hit bottom. Till you're dead.
until then... I can use you.
you're hiring me back?
you did good work.
I did good work yesterday, and I was still fired. What changed?
you wanted me to spend time with her.
see if I could still make a connection.
you connected with a diagnosis, not with her.
you're trying to save me, trying to control me.
you're doing exactly what you think.
cracks.
you're lips are cracked.
you been using your inhaler lately?
allergies. Don't deflect. You always deflect.
did she cry?
when you told her that she was gonna die, did she cry?
she... got upset. She.
were there tears?
no.
chopping an onion releases a mist of syn-propanethial-s-oxide, a chemical irritant which causes people to have a very predictable reaction.
she has no tears.
it was either this or put on brian's song.
I didn't have time to stop by wilson's.
she has sjogren's.
it attacks the glands that produce tears and saliva.
also, by the way, causes lung cysts and rta.
it doesn't cause bleeding.
it's like you and men.
just 'cause you usually don't, doesn't mean you can't.
and it doesn't cause cracked lips in other people.
lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding groundfor a fungus like candida.
your asthma inhaler did the same for you.
wiped out your mouth's immune system.
so she's got what I've got.
just the opportunistic infection, not the underlying condition.
another life saved by girl-on-girl action.
I'm gonna be okay?
you're gonna be okay.
methylprednisolone to get the sjogren's under control.
and some artificial tears to maximize the visual impact of this moment.
Spencer's gonna be fine.
and I hear you got your job back.
I'm gonna keep standing here until you say something.
I feel alone.
and she hasn't gone anywhere.
she gets to live.
I'm gonna go home. I'm tired.
what do you think?
Oh, my god!
you guys shop here too?
best nipples in princeton.
why are you here?
because he ate the donut.
I'm so sorry. He must've followed me.
I'm sure.
well, you're clearly not pregnant, so either you're buying this as a gift, or this is some kind of weird "if you build it, they will come" moment.
I'm adopting a baby.
she asked me to be a character reference. That's where I was the other morning.
I'm sorry. I couldn't betray her confidence.
I didn't want anyone else to know in case I didn't get approved.
today, I did.
it's a dark road and a dark way that leads to my house and the word says you're never gonna find me there oh no are you gonna congratulate me?
if you're happy, I'm...
it didn't get there by itself. There's a feeling. But you're not feeling it at all. There's a meaning. But you're not listening anymore...
what time? - 4: 30.
why so late?
make-up test in social studies.
did you invite Shelby for Saturday?
no.
do you want me to call Her ?
Yeah, that'd be great. You calling a 12-year-old girl for a sleepover.
it'll be fine.
make you a deal. I'll call a friend when you call a friend.
it's your birthday. Do what you want.
thank you. Bye.
Bye.
what did you forget? - Nothing.
then why'd you come back?
because I live here.
come on, Samantha, you're gonna be late for school.
what are you talking about? It's 4: 30.
are you okay?
I, uh...
tired, I guess.
what's wrong?
I don't know.
great. That's all I need to know.
you're late! Okay, bye.
37-year-old male with recurring blackouts.
tell him to switch from tequila to bourbon.
worked for me.
the three doctors he's already seen already ruled out drugs and alcohol.
well, then it's epilepsy. Tell him to buy a hockey helmet
egg's clean. So is the CT.
relax.
just because you got approved by an adoption agency doesn't mean you'll get approved by the birth mother.
you're a single mom.
that puts you somewhere below couples acquitted in day care scandals.
you're welcome, Dr. House.
it is an interesting case.
what time are you seeing the mom?
are you having your guy follow me?
I just trashed your social value as a mother, and all I got was a little sarcasm.
it means you don't feel the need to defend yourself, which means you're not worried about getting a kid, which means you've already got one.
we're meeting at 11: 00.
she's due to deliver a baby girl in two weeks.
I'm sure the mom'll be thrilled to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.
she's not a crack baby.
no, mother's perfectly healthy.
she just had to give up the baby in order to continue her work on the human genome.
she confessed to some past meth use.
what they don't confess to is almost always more interesting.
this is a mistake.
because a kid you don't know may have some problems you don't know about that she may have passed on to a kid?
because you're a control seeking narcissist.
which is fine, good even, in some jobs.
but you're not equipped to handle a real kid, never mind a factory second.
where are you meeting her?
in a little place called "follow me" and your urologist will be buying himself a new yacht.
they explained the returns policy, right?
it's worse than video games.
I'm not changing my mind.
could be post concussion syndrome.
not without a pre-concussion.
pick a number.
for what?
Cuddy pool. She got the nod.
little tweaker's due in 14 days.
that's great news... I think.
it's good news.
the great news is she insisted that she's not gonna change her mind, which means she's actually thought about changing her mind, which means she's not sure she's ready to be a mom, which means she's not ready to be a mom, which means she's gonna change her mind.
the only question is when.
$100 buy in.
less than seven means the next seven days.
but she's been dying for a kid for three years.
no way she's gonna back out now.
not one of the options.
mini strokes can cause blackouts and memory loss.
nine hours is a lot of time to be out for a mini stroke.
and there'd be residual damage on the CT.
guy works at home as a consumer product tester.
he could've been exposed to a toxin that caused short term memory loss.
wouldn't show up on imaging.
cavernous sinus thrombosis could absence seizures and memory loss.
I'll take 7 to 14.
we have a player.
you just said it was great news. Now you want to bet against her?
it's only great news if she wants it to be great news.
house knows her better than any of us.
I'd rather use a pseudonym.
good thinking.
I say she's gonna meet the mom and bolt.
I'm going for the early fold.
check his home for toxins and his sinuses for thrombosises.
maybe he oded on caffeine.
apparently he didn't drink the coffee. He just smelled it.
did they just move here?
six years ago.
this is no way to raise a kid.
he's a single dad.
I'm sure he's doing his best.
which is why single people shouldn't have kids.
you got a problem with what Cuddy's doing?
you think single mothers can't.
I think the traditional family is a fraud.
even married moms are single moms.
daddy just pays some bills and reads just enough bedtime stories to not kill himself out of guilt.
my dad was great. After my mom died.
he might be the exception.
on the other hand, you are fairly screwed up.
no booze, no meds, no drugs.
and no view. Building's half-empty.
he'd rather have a view of the turn pike than the park.
park views are probably 50% more.
you're the surprised the guy's a pragmatist after looking at this place?
guy's not a pragmatist. He's a flagellant.
looks like mold.
mom would've cleaned better.
exposure to certain types of mold can cause short term memory loss.
we're testing both of you.
I feel fine.
I'm sure you are. We're just being cautious.
so where do you guys go other than home and school?
nowhere. Dad works at home, and I go to school.
what about sports, friends, travel?
like I said, dad works at home, and I go to school.
must be hard not having your mom around, huh?
I was only four when the accident happened.
still, I'm sure you both miss her sometimes.
not really.
you're strong.
no, I just don't get what the big deal about death is, you know?
Yeah.
how is she?
physically, she's fine.
mentally, she's weird.
I'm sure she's just freaked out about her dad.
Mr. Harmon?
Mr. Harmon.
where are you going?
I have an appointment. I have to go.
we haven't finished with your treatment. We're still waiting on some test results.
I have an appointment.
sorry, you're gonna have to reschedule.
I really have to go.
Mr. Harmon, do you know where you are?
why are you trying to stop me?
his eyes.
is he having a seizure?
his pupils are responsive.
I think he's... asleep.
he was just asleep.
means no memory loss.
and sleepwalking doesn't kill.
unless he walks out a window.
Sleepwalking's not a diagnosis. It's a symptom.
as long as we can't figure out why.
stress-induced insomnia. Lots of people sleepwalk.
not in the middle of the day before they've even put their head on a pillow.
could be some sort of narcolepsy. Which is caused by
there's usually genetic history.
or?
if you know the answer, can you tell us the answer?
I don't know the answer.
which brings us back to--or?
some sort of environmental trigger.
which means?
it's a toxin.
so we are?
being lead down an annoying path.
I honestly don't know where this is going.
just following the clues.
we're right back where we started.
the mold we found doesn't cause these symptoms.
and there's nothing else at his home.
And?
and you're obnoxious.
he never goes anywhere else.
which we know because?
because he says so.
because his daughter says so.
because they have no reason to lie.
which proves he never goes anywhere else...
when...
he's...
conscious.
Oh, my god, you're right.
he said he had an appointment.
next time, let him keep it.
send him home. See where his dreams take him.
Dr. Cuddy?
Lisa. Nice to meet you.
Oh, you want one?
no ，thanks.
I can't stop eating them.
I guess it's, like, a craving.
I must have, like, a dozen a day.
Oh, and this is decaf.
how have you been feeling?
Oh, you know, tired, fat, nervous.
is there, um, anything you want to ask me?
uh, yeah, actually, I just have one question.
um, what are you gonna call her?
Ah, I'm not sure.
it's all been rather sudden, you know?
I like joy.
but as I said, I haven't really decided yet.
well, is there anything you want to ask me?
it's okay.
the agency web site is filled with prospective parents.
their photos, their biographies.
there's so many wonderful people out there.
wonderful couples.
why did I choose a single mom?
my grandmother was married for 37 years to a man that treated her like garbage.
and my mom would've stayed married to my loser dad that long, but he dumped her.
you know, I never understood how you could fall for the same crap as your mother.
then I met tony.
when I read your bio, a doctor, a head of a hospital, I saw your picture...
I don't want her raised by a loser.
how long have you had that rash?
I don't know. A few days?
have you had any joint pain?
Yeah, I'm pregnant. All my joints hurt.
they shouldn't all hurt.
have you been using?
not in seven months.
not since I found out I was pregnant.
that needs to be checked out.
you sure you don't want children?
you know, just because we're stuck here and I'm lying down doesn't mean we need to get deep.
you're afraid you'll make the same mistake you made with your wife.
get caught taking some other kid to a ball game.
I like my life as it is.
alpha waves increasing.
any change in demeanor?
no, nothing. He just got up.
maybe it's a result of the blood pressure change.
delta waves out of nowhere.
he's now asleep.
brain's supposed to turn off motor function.
if the brain was doing what it was supposed to be doing, we wouldn't be here.
he's leaving. Come on.
she's 38 weeks. You think it's fifth disease?
what's that?
it's a viral infection. It can infect the fetus.
usually in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and in women who have trouble with their immune system.
history of drug abuse could've compromised her immune system.
I told you I haven't used anything in seven months.
it does look more like a heat rash to me.
Yes, well, maybe we want to look at the actual blood tests.
of course.
she work for you? - Yeah.
everybody here works for you.
when this happens for real, are you okay to deliver here?
Yeah, sure. - Good.
blood work's normal.
test it again. - Tested it twice.
I'll get you some topical cream for that rash.
I'm admitting her.
there's nothing wrong with her.
there are dozens of other things this rash could indicate.
I want a full fetal work up.
you're losing it.
that's why happens when you have kids.
ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears.
it's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.
she had a lace pattern rash, joint pain, and a history of drug abuse.
you would've done exactly the same thing.
Uh-huh, and I'd be an excellent father.
what are you doing?
baby barf.
maternity ward was handing out free samples.
well played, sir.
you leave me no choice but to change.
my clothes, not my mind. - That's exactly my point.
it's not gonna be me and a cup. It's gonna be eight times a day.
if you can't handle wearing that stain, you can't handle a baby.
why do you even care?
it's not like I'm ever gonna ask you to babysit.
I'm a humanitarian.
we should stop him.
the whole point was to
let him plow into some innocent bystander?
his legs are working. Obviously, his eyes are working too.
his reaction time could be slower.
he's stopping. - Yeah, I see.
he's having sleep sex. - Maybe.
pull up to her. - I know.
What'd that guy want? - Piss off.
go after him. She's not a hooker.
how do you know?
do you want me to describe the clues, or do you want to stop him before he finishes off the drugs he just bought?
apparently, rip's a coke fiend.
so sleeping beauty has a jones for snow white.
coke explains the narcolepsy.
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.
but it doesn't explain the ripin the space time continuum.
coke leads to sleepwalking, which leads to coke, which leads to sleepwalking.
what caused the first sleepwalking?
the coke he took while he was wide awake.
says he didn't.
wouldn't be the first time somebody lied about drug use.
he has no reason to lie.
he knows he's sick.
his job doesn't drug test.
no relationship.
his daughter wouldn't find out.
maybe he just forgot.
forgot he did cocaine?
you're going with forgot over lying?
fits.
cocaine explains the narcolepsy.
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.
whatever is in the cocaine other than the cocaine explains the memory loss.
dealers cut this stuff with all kinds of garbage.
great, we'll start him on immediate treatment for all kinds of garbage.
you can narrow it down in the lab.
not without a sample.
so get a sample.
you want us to score cocaine from a drug dealer?
it's exciting.
it's a felony.
it's necessary.
there she is.
amniotic fluid looks good.
good fetal movement. Heart's beating nicely.
what?
it looks like pulmonary hypoplasia.
what's that?
the baby's lungs are under developed.
she won't be able to breath on her own.
she might die? - I don't know.
if she was born today, she'd be in trouble, but we're not gonna let that happen.
we'll put you on magnesium to prevent labor and steroids to grow the lungs.
it's a good thing Dr. Cuddy brought you in.
how do you know what a drug dealer looks like?
I'm not doing drugs, if that's what you're asking.
I just noticed that she had cash in her hand.
obviously came from him.
obviously didn't have enough time to perform any other services.
I didn't notice her holding
there she is.
uh, we're not cops.
cops aren't allowed to say that, right?
Yeah, they can say it.
but if you were a cop, you'd know that.
what do you want?
I would like to buy some cocaine, please.
Oh, definitely not a cop.
thank you. - Wait.
it's good.
glad you like it, pablo. Now can we go?
no. You gave us the wrong stuff.
what are you talking about? You got my best.
I know. I don't want the good "get your new customer hooked" stuff.
I want the stepped on "keep the old customer coming back for more" stuff.
are you crazy, bitch?
no, I'm a just a bitch who knows what she wants.
looks like this kid thing is really working out for you.
all of the shopping, none of the stretch marks.
not a good time.
right, kid's getting worse.
blessing in disguise.
although a completely predictable one.
you take in strays, don't be surprised by the worms.
still wearing the sweater.
I didn't say you weren't stubborn.
I said you weren't maternal.
thank you. Go away.
you're getting crankier.
baby's sick.
sorry I'm not finding the fun in that.
is it really worth it?
just for the pursuit of unconditional love?
only you could see that as a bad thing.
it's a fake thing. There's no unconditional love. It's just unconditional need.
don't make this child a victim of your biological clock.
victim?
you think she's better off staying. - Yes!
because at least she knows she's not qualified for the job.
let me guess.
I'm gonna tell her not to play ball in the house, but she's not gonna listen.
no, actually, I was going for she sneaks her boy friend in while you're sleeping, and he wants to do it on the desk.
and at first she says no, but she has issues with self-esteem.
you know you're gonna pay for that.
I'm paying for it right now. With wisdom.
get out.
we found lactose. The coke was cut with milk powder.
makes it nutritious.
not much of a toxin.
it is if he's allergic to milk.
he's not. He has milk in his fridge.
how does he like his coffee?
I don't know. What does that
what type of cereal's in the cabinet?
Cocoa-something.
why, what does it matter?
he likes his coffee black. Milk's for the kid.
how can you be sure?
because if he drank the milk, he'd know that he's lactose intolerant.
ask him, then treat him for allergic reaction.
if he gets better, we all get to go home early.
steroids make you more prone to infection.
you'll have to stay here for the new two weeks so we can monitor you.
the baby's lungs, is that because of... the meth?
could be.
you must hate me.
if you'd done everything right in your life, I wouldn't be getting a baby.
you're not scared?
I am scared.
you got, like, this perfect life.
not yet.
what's that?
heart rate's climbing.
what's wrong with her?
it's not the baby. It's you.
I need two units of o-negative, stat!
the mother had a stage two placental abruption. She's losing blood.
so deliver the baby.
the lungs are ten weeks premature.
so deliver now, risk the baby.
deliver later, risk the mom.
it's not your baby yet. It's not your call.
she'll do whatever I tell her to do.
self-worth issues.
that's genetic, you know.
you should deliver now.
right.
are you serious?
you're not?
you just told me. - The wrong answer.
you can give the mom more blood. You can't give the fetus more lungs.
the lungs might work.
it's the right decision medically.
and yet you're here.
to get your opinion, not to get jerked around.
see, this is what's screwed up here.
you're not sure that this is the right call, but you are sure that this is what you want to tell her.
and that scares you because your motives aren't medical.
some part of you doesn't want this baby, and that partwants to tell her to kill it.
this is an impossible situation.
I'm advising her to take the safest route.
right.
doesn't explain why you changed your sweater.
I need your advice.
it's not cancer.
can you remove spleens with your mind too?
you're here to talk about Cuddy. The file is a pretext.
why the hell haven't you come to talk to me about cuddy?
I've been doing all sorts of insane stuff.
if she can't handle your insanity, she can't handle a baby.
that's exactly my point.
no, it isn't.
you're feeling threatened because she's going onto high school and leaving you behind to repeat the eighth grade.
she's sleeping with the math teacher to get a diploma.
adoption is cheating?
are they giving her a fake kid?
that's the problem.
she gets to have a relationship with a kid, but she can't handle one with an adult.
so she's gonna kill it.
well, it does seem cleaner.
I've seen the file. She's making a judgment call.
decisions are never made in a vacuum.
just like your decision to make her miserable.
you're doing this because we no longer have inkwells and cuddy doesn't have pigtails.
why do you think I did that?
how you doing?
not sure.
been keeping an eye on the clock like you said.
I don't think I lost any time.
the machinery agrees with you.
that means your problems were caused by the coke.
can't believe I did coke.
you were asleep.
I chose to do coke.
in your sleep. You weren't responsible.
something inside me wanted to do it.
something inside of me didn't think it was wrong.
it's like a dream.
we all do stuff in our dreams we wouldn't do when we're awake.
I don't.
what's that?
did I fall asleep and hurt myself?
I don't see any cuts.
because there aren't any.
I think...
you're sweating blood.
guy's bleeding out of his pores.
what does that tell us?
other than you don't want to play basketball against him and he's dying?
and neither cocaine or allergies are the answer.
it's gotta be systemic.
hemorrhagic virus, maybe?
you think it's Ebola?
his white blood cell count would be through the roof.
it's not an infection.
D. I.C?
coags are normal.
it's cancer.
leukemia explains everything. - No fever.
the bleeding. - No weight loss.
the rash. - No headache.
the fatigue.
Leukemia'd be obvious from the CBC.
leukemia has false negatives all the time.
so we have four reasons for leukemia, four reasons against.
only need one against.
Yeah, if we had one reason for anything else.
go do a bone marrow biopsy.
what would you do?
I think...
I think you should wait.
but if I wait... I could die.
there would be more danger for you, but.
is this your opinion as a doctor or as a mother?
it's my medical opinion.
it's my personal opinion. - I don't want to wait.
it might only be one week.
we will keep you on plasma.
this is not my baby.
I have already sacrificed nine months for this stupid mistake.
I don't want to sacrifice any more.
Becca, you asked my opinion because you wanted to do the right thing.
you are giving up this baby because you don't want to make the mistakes your mom made, her mom made.
you have a chance to break this cycle, to do something great for this baby.
no.
I need you to hold still.
wait.
have you been testing any tanning creams or sprays?
no.
it's not a tan.
means it's not leukemia.
chem panel confirms kidney failure, end stage.
got him on dialysis?
bp's too low.
too bad.
it would've been nice to have more than an hour or two to solve this thing.
Hemachromatosis?
he have tiny testes? - No. Scleroderma.
his skin's darker, not lighter.
as much fun as 20 questions tends to be, he's blowing blood out of every orifice, you think it just might be vascular?
vasculitis?
if I had said it might be "vitas gerular," would you have said "vitas gerulaitis?
test him for vasculitis, angio and blood.
even if we're right, he's gonna need a kidney transplant.
test the daughter.
she's 12.
small kidney. It just means he won't pee as much.
great for road trips.
I meant she's a minor and daddy has a conflict, so we're gonna need cuddy's sign off.
so get it.
she's... kind of busy.
clamp.
suction.
entering the abdominal cavity.
there's the head.
got a minute?
get out of here.
who's that? - Dr. Gregory house.
he's the one you'll be suing when you develop sepsis.
well, why is he here?
better question is why is she here?
you're an administrator. Administrate.
I have a patient's daughter needs a guardian ad litem. - That's it.
tests are inconclusive. But either way he's gonna need
house, get out!
this doesn't need you. I do.
head's out.
later. - Later's too late.
and there she is.
come on, cry.
come on.
come on. Joy, cry.
cry, joy.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
that's the sound we like to hear apgar's nine out of ten.
you hear that?
you just got your first "A."
she's... yours now.
mazel tov.
now it's time to say those magic words you'll be telling her for the rest of her life.
mommy's gotta go to work.
have the risks of the transplant procedure been explained to you?
damn it. I was hoping you weren't going to ask her that.
of course she knows. Can you just sign the paperwork?
Dr. House explained to you that all surgeries carry risk? You could die.
and if you don't do it, daddy will die.
stop pressuring her.
sorry. Daddy's perfectly healthy.
but we want you to give him a kidney anyway because it'd be cool if he had three.
shut up.
do you understand the risks of living with one kidney?
Yeah.
and you still want to proceed with the transplant?
Yeah.
okay, go ahead.
no.
I'm saying you can proceed.
I'm saying I can't.
whatever he has, she has too.
she's sleepwalking.
if we don't give him a new kidney, he's dead in a week.
we have to transplant.
when your remote has a dead battery, you don't replace it with another dead battery.
whatever's killing the dad's kidneys is gonna kill the kid's too.
it is possible the sleep issues aren't medically related.
maybe they're both insomniacs due to the turnpike noise.
maybe they both drink too much coffee, maybe
house is right.
how do you know?
because the daughter's sweating blood.
if they have the same thing, it means there has to be a common cause.
which means it has to be a toxin, infection, or genetic.
and since we've ruled outinfections and toxins.
it narrows it down to any one of a dozen genetic disorders, each of which takes more than a week to run.
call foreman. Get to work.
Cuddy is positively aglow.
what's your theory?
she's only acting happy to make you miserable?
I need a genetic disease.
I'm sure you're carrying a few.
symptoms are kidney failure, bleeding, and insomnia.
you paid off the pool?
technically, anyone who didn't enter is a winner.
it's not over yet.
everyone's happy until they unwrap that pretty present and find they got a wall clock in the shape of africa.
adoption's a cheat, remember?
there's no real pregnancy, so there's no stranded dopamine receptors, so there's no postpartum depression.
Cuddy will be the happiest new mother you've ever seen.
I've just given you the answer, haven't I?
and now you're going to walk out of here without saying a word.
Nope!
good news.
I know what you have, and you're both gonna be fine.
what? Are you serious?
yes and no.
so you do know what they have? - Yeah.
but they aren't gonna be fine?
no idea. They might be.
why the hell would you say they were?
to make them happy.
for two seconds?
technically, to see if they can be happy.
we should've seen a grin, a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.
they're sick. They're tired.
they're anhedonic, incapable of experiencing pleasure.
something's bushwhacked their dopamine receptors.
they're depressed.
mom's dead. Dad's dying.
you should know that being bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.
being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.
why their place had no music, no view, no decor.
but if you can't feel pleasure, what's with the cocaine?
Really? Is that why you do drugs?
because you're happy?
most people do 'em because they want to be happy.
his subconscious craved it, needed it.
most common cause of anhedonia is schizophrenia.
sure, in white folk.
they're black?
they're liars.
what's your name?
your real name. Hosarian? Herzog?
H'ali-baba?
Hammoud.
changed it when we invaded iraq the first time.
how'd you know?
you and your daughter have familial mediterranean fever.
it's a genetic disease contracted by people of mediterranean descent.
sephardic jews, armenians, arabs.
causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney failure, even lactose intolerance.
symptoms are set off by age and stress.
kid couldn't get happy, but she could get stressed by daddy dying.
you don't know if we'll get better?
treatment tends to be hit and miss once you reach the sweating blood stage.
start them on colchicine and melphalan.
his kidneys are fried.
if he doesn't have fmf, the colchicine will kill him.
boy, sure hope I'm right.
Mr. Harmon?
Mr. Harmon, I need you to open your eyes.
feeling better?
how's samantha?
healthy enough to toss you a kidney.
dad?
the baby's doing great.
I...
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
I was... I was stupid and selfish.
you were scared.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have been.
that's not true.
well, I mean, you would've been scared, but...
you would've done the right thing anyway.
and I want to be like that.
I don't... I don't want to be a loser.
you're not a loser.
when I saw you hold her and the look on your face, it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
and that's when I realized...
I can't.
my life, it's always been about pain, and anger, and disappointment, never about love.
and that's when I realized, you know, it could be.
and I can't give that away.
Becca, don't do this.
what you're feeling is natural.
but you're filled with hormones, and emotion, and fear, and...
you just can't make a huge decision like this right now. You have to give it some time.
I am...
I'm so sorry.
it's a decision that changes everything.
changes the rest of your life.
I hope so.
don't take away my shine my shine is all I have my heat, my love, my beauty, and my glad. It worries me sometimes that I want love and live a life of sad my tremolo sweet baby my fire
it's really not the greatest time for gloating.
there's more than one baby in the sea.
the world is full of teenage boys riding bareback.
no. I'm done.
I can't go through that again.
you're quitting.
just like you quit ivf.
Yeah, just like that.
there, you just did it again.
it's too bad.
you would've made a great mother.
you son of a bitch.
when I was getting a baby, you told me I'd suck as a mother.
now that I've lost it, you tell me I'd be great as a mother.
why do you need to negate everything?
I don't know.
good night.
good night.
we're starting a fund.
then you don't need me.
the man's injured. He can't work.
his fault.
we're family. We depend on each other.
we're not family. We're co-workers.
he's not even that anymore.
I can't believe you just said that.
can't come between a man and his beer money.
see the big, heavy machinery?
I'm sorry, but he should give.
you gave.
go back to work.
paolo is the one who got you off the night shift.
it's not like I asked him.
also coved for you labor day weekend.
but hey, it's America.
if you don't want to contribute.
if you don't want to cont-...
Oh, god!
get an ambulance.
so I take it you did not ask Cuddy out.
Yeah.
yeah "I didn't" or yeah "I did"?
whichever one means you almost had me convinced it was a good idea.
nothing to say? - No.
no, you don't. Or no, you don't don't?
whichever one means no.
is this some kind of reverse?
no.
16-year-old girl with fluid in her lungs.
no preous auma, lung, or cardiac issues.
gram stain was negative.
no bacteria, no pneumonia.
she's a factory worker.
means she probably works close to a lot of recent immigrants.
thank god some of those offshore sweat shop jobs are coming back to America.
she's an emancipated minor.
in a factory?
either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a child star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway.
her parents died last year.
no relatives.
to avoid foster care, she got a G. E.D. And got emancipated.
could have picked up a parasite from a co-worker.
she'd be having G. I.Problems.
pregnancy's more likely.
sparks a fluid overload, hits the lungs, causes the pulmonary edema.
her history says she's not sexually active.
and our history says she could be lying.
but not every teenager is having sex.
but every teenager is stupid.
teenagers on their own are stupider.
the girl's holding down a job, makes her rent.
on the one hand, Kutner's right.
maybe she's a sweet young thing, not a screw-up lying through her teeth.
on the two hand, a pregnancy test only takes five minutes, and we no longer kill rabbits.
so in conclusion, shut up, do the tests.
what else?
drugs could damage the heart.
pressure imbalance allows fluid to build up in the lungs.
tox screen's clean.
for drugs used recently.
not for drugs used before recently.
16 doesn't automatically mean a risky lifestyle.
didn't we just have this conversation?
Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't.
so, in conclusion, shut up.
check her home and work for toxins or drugs.
Kutner and foreman, do an echo.
find the extent of the heart damage.
Kutner can do the echo on his own.
yes...
but he'll be very lonely.
so I have to ask why?
I've been asked to help run a clinical trial.
that okay with you?
good for your career.
great for your street cred.
what's in it for me?
you have four doctors and never more than one case.
it means I have time to work on other things.
and they'll have more chances to step up.
stand on their own.
and if there's an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?
if there's a problem with sophia or any other patient, you know I'll be there.
the patient is my priority.
no.
Oh, do you want a reason?
clinical trials take time. Your time is my time.
I told you, I don't do drugs.
still a good idea to check your heart.
something else could have damaged it.
you find it hard being all on your own?
having to do everything without drugs to ease my pain?
that's not what. - teenager on her own?
I wouldn't trust me either.
I meant it must be hard.
no one there to back you up.
I know you're trying to be nice, but I'm not into the whole pity thing.
I was actually doing the "I get it" thing.
I lost my parents when I was six.
it doesn't go away.
but it gets easier.
you learn to deal.
I still get nervous when there's a knock on the door.
always think it's the state trooper with more bad news...
you already got the worst news and survived.
that's sorta the upside.
your heart's healthy.
isn't that good news?
for your heart, yeah.
but it also means we still don't know what's wrong.
checkbook balanced, place spotless.
looks like she builds her own furniture.
if you're this grown up at 16, what happens at 30?
you turn back into a kid.
like kutner.
Kutner's not that bad.
he needs everything to be nice.
he wants to see the best in everyone.
kitchen's clear.
Yeah, friendly isa dangerous thing.
there is such a thing as too trusting.
corollary is there is such a thing as not trusting enough.
too much, you get hurt.
not enough, you don't live.
so the object in life is to get hurt just the right amount?
excuse me if I don't goout of my way to take relationship advice from you.
and trust should be earned.
bong means nothing. Drugs are irrelevant.
relevant if she's taking them.
even if she is: Irrelevant.
echo showed no heart damage.
would that be the echo that foreman chose not to run with you after I dashed his new drug discovery dreams?
you mad at me because you think kutner screwed up the echo?
I didn't screw up the echo.
I know.
no structural heart damage.
so if it's not the heart...
it's the heart.
didn't you just say it's not?
not all heart damage has to be structural.
drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia.
irregular heart beat would account for the pulmonary edema.
the edema was acute.
vasculitis makes more sense.
there's no sign in her blood work.
and if she had vasculitis, she'd be too weak to work in a factory.
she builds her own furniture.
you think she skips work because she's feeling a little weak?
she needs steroids.
steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er.
foreman. Start her on beta-blockers.
the rest of you, do anything that isn't starting her on beta-blockers.
start her on the treatment. Page me if you need me.
irregular heartbeat causes blood to back up behind the heart and into the lungs.
the beta-blockers keep this from happening.
I thought the test showed my heart was fine.
it's tricky. An arrhythmia can come and go.
so you don't believe me or the test.
you guys are more cynical than I am.
we found the bong in your apartment.
you went into my apartment?
extended drug use can damage.
the bong belongs to my ex. It's why he's ex.
that doesn't mean you didn't use it.
no.
you have no reason to trust me.
you have to do your treatment.
the other possibility is you have vasculitis.
the treatment for that is steroids.
if you've been using drugs, if they've damaged your heart and I start you on steroids, they could kill you.
I haven't used drugs.
I'll get the steroids.
why are you here?
I owe clinic hours. - No, you don't.
I'm here because House doesn't want me to be here.
I'm guessing he said no to the clinical trials.
he didn't need to say no.
he just wanted to say no.
house did something solely out of self-interest?
that's freaky.
don't suppose you'd want to override? - No.
what do you think this is gonna prove?
does it matter?
just figured you could use some help down here.
and you spending two hours wiping noses will annoy house.
if that is your dream, god bless.
if you want to prove you can do his job and something more...
his puke is red.
that's blood, right?
that hurt?
what about that?
four days he's been like this. It's just getting worse.
maybe he just needs to poop.
Evan! - What?
worked last time I had a stomach ache.
it's actually a smart idea.
which is why that'sthe first thing the other doctors checked.
his insides are clear.
anyone else sick in daycare? - No.
how 'bout his friends? - No. No one.
what's happening to him? - Not sure yet.
don't worry. I've got an idea.
you can make him better, right?
that's my plan.
you need to make him better.
stay the hell away from me!
just calm down.
what happened?
I adjusted her iv, and she went crazy.
don't touch me! Leave me alone!
Sophia, it's okay. We're here to help you. - Just stay away from me!
don't touch me!
I said, don't.
get your hands off of me! Get your hands
beta-blockers don't cause psychotic breaks.
she's not on beta-blockers.
we started her on haloperidol. She's stable.
lab tests showed the delirium wasn't caused by a metabolic problem.
means we still don't know what caused it.
Yeah, we do. Niceob, foreman.
I didn't switch her meds.
but your decision to stick it to the man clearly inspired oliver twist.
I treated her based on the symptoms she presented.
you treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process.
she wasn't on steroids long enough for it to cause the delirium. - It's a new symptom.
one that rules out vasculitis.
and arrhytia. The psychotic break caused a surge of adrenaline, but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's not the problem. We're both wrong.
so what causes lung issues and delirium?
and is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?
Prinzmetal angina.
silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful.
if you'd run the echo that you didn't run before giving her the beta-blockers that you didn't give her
if you'd listened to what kutner just said, you'd know it's not a heart problem.
I'm not talking about her heart.
I'm talking about her head.
Prinzmetal angina doesn't affect
no reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm.
leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.
Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fmri to see which artery's dancing.
and when I say foreman, I mean... foreman.
I want his signature on the paperwork. I want videotape.
I want photographs of him with the patient and today's newspaper.
set her up. When you're ready.
house wants you. - To do the procedure.
when you get everything set up, page me.
that's really a camera?
pretty cool, huh?
this can go places the other scopes can't.
Jonah, I need you to swallow this pill.
don't wanna.
it doesn't hurt. Promise.
Jonah, please.
to help make you better.
I don't want to be mean, but if you don't do this, we'll have to make you.
it's a power pill. It's not ust a camera.
it makes your muscles grow.
like the vitamins we take.
except this was made with a secret formula.
you did great, sweetheart. You're very brave.
Jonah's lucky.
I was pretty cruel to my little brother when I was your age.
Why?
I guess I thought that's what big brothers did.
obviously, I was wrong.
is he a doctor too?
no.
does the pill tickle, sweetie?
he can't feel it. What's funny, your brother?
what's happening? - I don't know.
how you guys getting along?
and you suddenly care why?
house was asking questions last week.
I assume foreman needs us, and he's worried that if we're sniping, we might be distracted.
that's kind of insulting, isn't it? - Very.
you're obviously fine.
I need a differential for uncontrollable giggling.
he's four. They laugh.
Yeah.
nothing like diarrhea and bloody vomit to put you in the mood to goof around.
I've looked down one end and up the other.
all the tests came back clean.
I can't figure this out.
you can't? Don't you work with three other doctors and a grouchy gimp?
this isn't House's case.
just so you know, whatever you're trying to prove, it won't be enough.
gotta go.
sorry. You didn't miss much. No spasms yet.
nothing in the anterior or posterior cerebral arteries.
how much longer?
just a few more minutes.
were your foster homes all around here, or did you have to change schools?
is chatting about lousy foster parents supposed to relax me?
left middle cerebral artery looks good.
my foster parents were great.
I think most foster parents do it because they want to do something decent.
which is why you didn't get emancipated.
nothing around the vertebral artery.
no sign of spasms.
but that's odd.
how'd you find out about your parents?
I told you. State trooper.
look at that.
arteries are fine. You can stop.
not that.
I forget, did he come to your house or call you down to the station?
came to my house.
I cried into the guy's shirt for an hour.
fmris tell us where the blood flow is.
you were using your limbic region.
it lights up when we use our imagination.
it doesn't lig up when we're telling the truth.
your parents aren't dead, are they?
I risked my job, put you on a different treatment.
I didn't lie about the drugs.
then why lie about your parents?
because i wish they were dead.
I got emancipated because my dad raped me.
and my mom pretended it didn't happen.
no signs of spasm, impeded blood flow, or brain dysfunction.
it's not prinzmetals.
all the fmri showed is House was right.
she was lying.
only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.
we find out our patient's been raped, and that's your response?
is she a psych patient?
rape could mean std.
thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart.
maybe if we all stopped wringing our hands, we could solve this thing and let her live to have a few more nightmares.
gonococcal endocarditis would explain the pulmonary edema, the delirium.
no sign in her bloodwork.
could be lying about the rape.
yesterday, you were all bff.
now you think she's pathological.
yesterday I had no reason to doubt her.
if she'd been honest with us from the beginning
she lied about dead parents because it's better than rapist parents.
you find that unsympathetic?
that's it. - What's it?
her whole life's a mess.
what rhymes with mess?
it's not stress.
she has none of the usual anifestations. No hormone imbalance, no cardiac.
Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious.
she's a picture of emotional health.
severe emotional stress can lead to asymmetric funion of the midbrain.
explains the delirium.
interruption of the brain-heart coupling could cause pulmonary edema.
even if House is wrong, the treatment's basic all anti-anxiety meds. Hard to argue with.
Yes. I agree. It does explain everything.
thirteen, load her upon diazepam.
Foreman, make sure she does it.
thirteen, make sure he makes sure.
I went to cuddy's house.
but I didn't go in.
went home without ringing either her metaphoricalor actual bell.
you're processing.
I'm scrubbing.
"huh" means processing.
"huh" means acknowledging.
if you prefer, I could say"ha," or "hmm," or...
no insights? No opinions? You're disappointed.
you made the decision.
I can't tell you what's right for you.
Seriously?
cause last week you could.
last year you could.
seems to come pretty easy to you.
do you want me to tell you what you should do?
I want you to stop thinking that acting inscrutable makes you anything other than annoying.
interesting.
holding things in can give you cancer!
kid's in daycare. Could be meningitis.
no fever, no stiffness, no rash.
you check his thyroid?
TSH and 3 t4 were within range.
ruled out all the usual suspects.
nothing's usual for a four-year-old, and as fun as this is, it feels like we're your goomah.
your feelings are hurt?
Eitherou can handle both these cases or you can't.
if you can't, it's dangerous and stupid.
on the other hand, stomach cancer.
leiomyosarcoma.
long shot.
altered mental status means porphyria's more likely.
no abdominal pain?
cancer explains the lethargy, the gi symptoms
neither's perfect.
then we test for both.
and by "we," you mean the collective "not you.
Thanks.
severe stress scrambles the way the brain communicates with the rest of the body.
I have a problem with my brain?
not exactly.
the problem would be with your body chemistry.
Where's Dr. Kutner?
there's four of us. It's my turn.
I'm sorry I lied about my parents.
you did what you thought you had to do to protect yourself.
if we're right, we should see a change in your lungs pretty fast.
then we can figure out how to manage your stress.
it might help to turn him in.
file a police report, get closure.
won't help.
not addressing what happened won't make it go away.
yeah?
what do I have to doto make it go away?
I didn't mean that. I just mean that you
I addressed it. I got away from him.
reporting it just labels me.
girl raped by dad.
it doesn't have to define you.
it's how you see me.
that's why you're treating me with tranquilizers.
not anymore.
stress wouldn't change your urine color.
labs show the brown urine was caused by shredded red cells.
so what messes with her lungs, her mental status, and runs her blood through a wood chipper?
factory lunch rooms aren't the cleanest places. Coulda picked up E. Coli.
or shigella from the restroom. Either would account for the red cells, the delirium.
but not the original lung symptoms.
legionnaire's could, and cause delirium.
no, her sodium's normal.
what does her furniture look like?
said it was homemade. Old boxes, what?
it was wood nailed together.
the wood have little dents or holes?
I didn't see any in the bookshelves, but they were painted.
the desk did.
looked like she had stapled stuff all over it.
holes means that it was pressure-treated.
sawing or burning releases arsenic into the air. Into her lungs.
tests didn't show.
because it found a cloak of invisibility hiding.
arsenic gets absorbed in the internal organs so it doesn't show up in the blood tests.
test her hair.
if it's positive, chelate it out of her blood.
no cancer, no porphyria.
you paged me with negative test results?
Yes, because it means we're done.
since we still don't know what's wrong, this kid has a real problem.
talk to House?
not his case.
there's a point when Cameron and I aren't enough.
we're not there.
we need to run some more tests.
a week ago, he was a happy little boy playing with his brother, and now he can barely lift his head.
we'll figure this out. I just need...
mom! Help!
we need a crash cart!
what's going on? - He's in cardiac arrest.
get them outta here.
clear.
nothing. Go again.
clear.
he's back.
foreman. We're there.
Chelation's complete.
you're arsenic-free.
so I can get outta here?
in the morning.
that's it?
no advice?
no "be careful out there, kiddo?
you want my advice?
want is one thing, expect's another.
I wish I could tell you what to do.
but you're strong.
you've make good choices.
you'll be fine.
Thanks.
need four milligrams lorazepam!
after the seizure, we ran a new mri.
this is sophia's brain three days ago, this is her brain today.
lesions.
magical lesions, which appear out of nowhere.
she was cured, then she wasn't.
lesions grew too fast for cancer.
could be infection. Mrsa.
wbc count would be through the roof.
put the arsenic back.
you wanna treat a patient nearly poisoned to death by giving her more poison?
just because we call something a poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.
it was killing her.
but since she's still dying, the arsenic obviously wasn't killing her.
and since she's now getting worse, the arsenic was obviously fighting the killer.
it's a hero.
we should be organizing a parade.
so what does arsenic treat?
syphilis. Before penicillin, the treatment was arsenic.
we already ruled out stds, and even if we were wrong, that much arsenic in her system would've wiped out the syphilis.
acute promyelocytic leukemia's still treated with arsenic.
APl explains the lesions and why they appeared after we took the arsenic out.
so, put the arsenic back.
we still have a problem.
arsenic slows leukemia, but it can't cure it.
if she wants to see 17, she's gonna need a bone marrow transplant.
best match would be a sibling or a parent.
biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's dying, then load her up with arsenic.
keep her alive till you can convince her that rapist marrow and rapist-enabling marrow work just as well as the unleaded stuff.
we need to talk.
this about the case you didn't want me to know about?
Cuddy? - Foreman.
you didn't flinch when you found out about a sixteen-year-old who could be dying in the next few days.
means you're here about someone even younger dying even faster.
he needs you.
but he has you.
this boy is going to die.
you selfish enough to let it happen?
pot calling a kettle a pot?
you're a hypocrite.
if our job is to find out what's killing patients, you'd help this kid.
but you'd rather play mind games to prove you're the only one with magical powers.
wanted something all your own?
now you got it.
your disengagement won't work.
I can see that.
you think that when you tell me what I should do, my instincts are to push back, so that by not telling me what you think I should do, I'll do what you thinkI should do.
I sound convoluted.
disengagement is neither artful nor effective.
so my not doing anything isn't causing you to do anything?
right.
I'm okay with that.
no, you're not.
you are designed to have opinions and to force them on people.
I'm starting to sound desperate.
don't screw with my stuff.
I just need a donor with the same blood type or something, right?
actually, bone marrow'sa little more complex.
the best donors are immediate family.
but those donor banks have thousands of names.
your parents' similar dna gives you a much better chan。 - No.
if I do this, I'll owe my life to them.
it'd mean everything else that had happened was somehow okay.
they don't deserve that.
they're not in my life.
if that means I'm dead, then I'm dead.
I have huntington's disease.
I'm dying.
don't know when it'll happen, but it'll be sooner than I ever planned.
and I'd do anything to stop it.
because the only way to mak anything right, the only way to make your life matter is to live as long and as well as you possibly can.
have you ever been raped?
no.
don't try to walkin my shoes and I won't try to walk in yours.
you had no right.
to try to convince her to do the right thing?
to lie to her.
it's a true story. Who cares if it's not my story?
it's my life. - It's her life.
point wasn't I'm dying. Point was she should live.
you should have told her.
instead you tell her to call the cops, give her stats on DNA markers.
everything's by the book. Nothing's ever personal.
trying to sleep here!
biopsy confirmed apl. She needs a bone marrow transplant.
run the donor banks. I'm going home.
we need to track down her parents.
I assume she's already said noto that idea, or there'd be no need to screw up your courage before saying it.
children who've been through trauma can't think clearly.
children who've been through trauma and are dying
guess I'm the only one who cares about patient rights.
what she wants could kill her.
what she needs could save her.
our job is to find out what's killing patients, not treat them for chronic idiocy.
idiocy is what's killing her.
and since we can't cure that, I'm going home.
we could save this patient, but all you care about is getting your answer.
your point being?
Taub and kutner can check the donor banks. I'm gonna find her parents.
can't see why you're surprised.
you push against House, he's gonna push back.
against me, I get.
his ego's killing my patient.
you liked this ase because he wasn't looming over you.
the decisions were yours.
only difference now ishe decided not to loom.
doesn't change the fact that your patient's dying.
what are we missing? What's not in the file?
the mother, over burdened at the end of her rope.
makes her kid sick so someone else will take care of him.
sympathize with her.
munchausen by proxy?
she brought him into the clinic, was with him when he went into cardiac arrest.
the brother would have noticed, said something.
Evan's even more protective than she is.
then maybe it's the brother.
he's eight.
could be jealous.
he's the opposite of jealous.
he includes jonah in everything he does.
makes sure he eats, brushes his teeth.
I think we gave him an idea.
either that or he's off to kill House.
Mr. Velez? - Yeah?
I'm Dr. Remy hadley from princeton-plainsboro hospital.
we're treating your daughter sophia for leukemia and we need to test both you and your wife for bone marrow donation.
I'm sorry, you said you were from princeton-plainsboro?
I know this is uneected, but time is short and.
what's going on?
this doctor says you have leukemia.
I don't have leukemia.
Sophia velez? - Yeah?
Sophia isabel velez? - Yeah.
do you know something I don't?
just that liars lie.
you stole her identity.
to protect myself.
so they can't find me.
we can protect you.
but we need to find your parents.
Why?
you have my blood. You don't need my name to find a donor.
you're a minor.
you obviously forged the emancipation papers.
even if we had a donor, we'd still need your parents' consent to treat you.
can't you just pretend you didn't go to that house?
that you didn't find that girl?
calling your parents doesn't mean a family reunion.
you don't even have to see them.
when I get sick enough, it'll be an emergency.
you'll have to give me a transplant.
even without consent.
an iron overdose?
from his vitamins.
if I'm right, we can treat him tonight.
he'll be back to his old self in the morning.
but...
they're children's vitamins. I only give him one.
I know.
I thought more would make him strong.
I didn't mean to make him sick.
he's gonna be okay.
he's gonna hate me.
well, that's the great thing about brothers.
you can make mistakes, and they'll still love you.
donor list turned up a partial match.
so treat her.
it's only a three out of six.
so don't treat her.
she may not last the week.
Partial's better than nothing.
so treat her. - She'll reject it.
and she'll be too weak to try again when a better match turns up.
it's my turn now, right?
if a better match turns up.
well, when you decide, get back to me.
she's scared.
not scared enough.
tell her the thing about emotional reactions is they're definitionally irrational.
or stupid.
might wanna phrase that in your own words.
she wants to deny her parents the satisfaction of saving her life.
that's your rational explanation of her emotional response.
that was her explanation.
that makes sense.
how long did it take her to come up with that?
it was her immediate reaction.
that doesn't make sense.
the fact that it makes sense doesn't make sense?
emotional is immediate.
she went to rational first.
means there was no emotional to process.
you're saying she's lying about being raped?
wouldn't be her first.
she lied about one trauma to cover a worse trauma.
so... what's worse than rape?
Hi, I'm Dr. House.
what did you do?
I don't. - Something happened, but it wasn't rape.
believe whatever you want.
you're scared, and stubborn, and you don't like people feeling sorry for you.
why not?
I don't want pity.
I just wanna be normal.
but you know you're not.
you need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping.
so they won't see the lost, hurt little girl.
because that's not what you see.
you see someone who did something terrible...
who deserves to suffer.
who doesn't deserve to live.
what did you do?
eventually, we'll find your parents...
if only to deliver the body.
then they won't care.
you're an idiot.
you'd rather die than face your parents because, what, you broke their faberge egg?
I killed their son.
I killed my brother.
I was supposed to watch him.
he was in the bath.
I could hear him laughing.
every time they look at me, it's like I kill him again.
if you don't take your parents' bone marrow...
you'd be killing their other child.
if they don't hate you now, they will then.
I don't care.
sure you do.
you want someone to tell youit was just an accident.
that it's not that bad, but it is that bad.
and you know it.
there's nothing you can doto change that.
but there is one thing you can do to not make it worse.
someone reaching for me now.Tthrough the dark reaching for me now. You need someone to hear you when you sigh. Someone to wipe away those tears you cried someone to hold you'neath the darkened sky. Someone to love you more than I. if you're here to celebrate the kid's bone marrow transplant working, you missed cake.
I want to do clinical trials.
already had this conversation.
I've proved that I can work two cases at once.
I can do this. And I'm doing it.
okay.
okay? Just like that?
can I give my reasons later... or never?
three days ago you said no.
three days ago you asked me.
now you told me.
can't say no if it's not a question.
nice thing you did for Foreman.
he speaks.
he deflects.
I almost costa four-year-old his life.
well, you knew Foreman would figure it out.
did I?
you just needed to prove it to him.
you're an ass.
but a noble one.
I sound clever.
thank you.
your little game didn't work.
I'm not Foreman, and you're not me.
you wanna talk about her?
Nope. - All right.
you're gonna be okay, House.
good to know.
excuse me. I've been waiting here for over an hour.
all I need is a refill on my migraine medication.
we'll get to you as soon as we can.
you can get to me now.
it'll only take you two minutes.
you're not an emergency.
this isn't an emergency room.
and it's not gonna go any faster by pissing me off.
got a minute? - No.
a routine checkup can wait. What else you got?
I'm consulting on some clinical trials that involve C. N.S. Compounds.
while it's true that no sometimes means yes, in this context...
one's a new Huntington's drug.
phase three trials are showing real results delaying neuronal degenetion.
I can probably get you in.
no, thanks.
are you doing anything about your disease, following any kind of program?
no. Nor am I looking for a consult.
excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.
well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk.
either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished.
do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone.
sorry.
nice try. Love to help.
shut up!
you wanted to see doctor. - I said shut up.
I'm sick, and I want to know why.
I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now...
or I'm gonna start killing people.
what seems to be the problem?
close those blinds.
you, push the sofa in front of that door.
you, move that table in front of the other door.
now!
okay, okay. Just move it.
you know, you don't have to point the gun man.
we're gonna do whatever you want.
no, we're not.
that's a bathroom you're barricading.
it might come in handy, especially since you've cleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.
do it!
my medical records. I need you to read them.
you really think that reenacting dog day afternoon is the best way to get diagnosed?
I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through.
I've been to 16 doctors in the last two years.
had three full-body cts and two mris, seven blood panels, and one homeopathic consult.
and all that was missing was the threat of violence.
what's missing is an answer!
I can't breathe!
I'm tired... all the time.
I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.
that's a cool constellation of symptoms.
it could be something minor.
at least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists.
shut up and do your job.
you barely looked at the file.
no need. Symptoms...
those are the things you keep whining about.
Tests--negative, or you wouldn't be here.
history. - Shy, quiet kid. Kept to himself.
collected comic books and missing children.
excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.
next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it.
I'll be okay.
if you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict.
what kind of breathing problems?
shortness of breath.
and sharp pain when I inhale.
so you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right?
me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health problem.
since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health.
I've never been married.
got a match? - Why?
because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
I'll look in Cuddy's desk. - Stay out of the desk!
Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does.
no, I don't. - Right.
you just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.
look, sir, I've never smoked in my life, okay?
jerk.
you figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?
I'm sorry. It's just... I got a lighter.
slowly.
hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out.
decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain.
an intermittent rash could be 100 things.
if you add on that final symptom, it can only be lmonary scleroderma.
what final symptom? Those were all my symptoms.
last one is the 16 doctors who missed it.
simple alkylating agent, case solved.
see you on visitor's day.
crime scene!
house, what's going on in there? Is everyone all right?
about to be. Assuming he's not lying.
but he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me.
I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma.
then we all get to go home.
Propofol? You sure?
have one of the guards bring it in. - No, no guards. No cops.
uh, I'll go get it.
no one's leaving.
she's not a cop? Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs. Alone.
she might be armed.
I'd have her deliver it shirtless.
who is it?
Oh, god, House. Maybe we should wait for.
guys with even bigger guns?
who know how to talk to armed. - Say good-bye or I shoot her.
roll up your sleeve.
give it to someone else first.
you're the only one who needs it.
give it to someone else.
if it goes in okay, you can givea second dose to me.
I don't care who. Just pick someone.
again, had your brilliant plan included a roomful of hostages that don't have fetuses, bacterial and fungal infections, leaving their immune systems too week to de with the metabolic strain, or are already on pain killers that have fatal interactions...
he's not on pain killers.
I heard him tell her in the clinic.
Aw, come on, man.
don't take it out on us.
you got a problem with doctors? Take it out on the doctors.
give it to her.
she's sick.
you are a very large creep.
take off your shirt.
satisfied? - Fine.
roll up your sleeve.
you think I'm an idiot? That's what you think?
I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size.
you're not gonna do anything.
you still need me.
come on!
what are you doing? He didn't do anything.
you're right. I need you.
I also need you to know you can't screw with me.
it's for you.
lieutenant Bowman, princeton swat.
Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of medicine.
we just heard a gunshot, but I haven't been able to make contact.
we'll handle that once we secure our perimeter and set up our positions.
by "perimeters,"I assume you mean snipers?
we have to put an end to this.
got a husband in there or a loved one?
uh, no.
don't worry, we'll decide when to start shooting.
house is gonna get someone killed.
the guy's ready to kill for a diagnosis,
I can't think of a better doctor to be trapped in there with him.
how 'bout someone who's not gonna keep pushing th whack job's buttons until he cracks?
it's House.
Joe's bar and grill.
it's Foreman, and every fellow you've had in the last five years.
what causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?
this is pathetic.
if I strap a bomb to my chest, do I get seven doctors attendg to me?
Dr. Robert chase.
on the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.
do you think he's the only guy in new jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol?
I'm not playing this game.
Seriously? You're walking out?
no, he's just kidding. He's right here.
throw me that marker, will you?
chest pain, the lung problems, fatigue, rash.
sounds like chronic lung infection.
heart palpitations and fatigue could be a cancer that's spread from the lungs.
next!
if his diaphragm's not working, maybe his nerves are freezing up.
I think he's going into shock.
first rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!
the shortest distance between stomach pain and insomnia is bad circulation.
plus troubled breathing. Could be a heart defect.
you needed to write four things down to remember 'em?
it's not my wall.
you're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood.
run tests for infection and cancer.
cameron, comb through his medical records.
see if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed uphis heart.
Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins.
873 marshall, south brunswick.
back window's unlocked.
giving out your address.
clearly you're not going back there.
means you do have an end game.
I'm lieutenant Bowman. How's everyone doing in there?
got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious.
unfortunately, not the guy we hoped.
we're gonna need someone to deliver his blood.
it's gonna be hard to play doctor. - shut up.
open that blind. Just a few inches.
why me? - Just open it. Open it!
why me? Anyone can do it. Why pick me?
get back! Get back!
I will kill her unless you back the hell out of there now!
interesting.
anybody else hear those guys outside?
anybody?
he's got hyperacusis.
what does that mean?
it means we have a favorite.
it's nerve related.
amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.
puff out your cheeks. Come on.
big mug shot smile.
left side facial weakness.
seventh nerve palsy.
plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines.
it's post-herpetic neuralgia.
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?
I'm not judging here.
this thing is just as likely to be caused by chicken pox.
I need proof now.
there is a test.
it's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless.
but you make a good point.
you need proof now. I'll order up the test.
if you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in.
it only hurts if your diagnosis is wrong?
win-win.
Jason, don't hang up the phone again.
you're gonna send in...
capsaicin. 200 micrograms.
and two syringes this time.
and we'll give you the blood and his records.
no more meds, Jason, and no deliveries without something in return.
you've gotta give us a hostage.
you can have two.
great. Then I'll send an officer right in with the transfer.
everything gets brought in by Dr. Cuddy.
Jason, I'm not gonna let her do that.
first, - Don't use his name so much.
it doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy.
second. - Come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication.
he's gonna shoot hostages if she doesn't bring it in.
I'll get back to you.
the guy's demanding that you do all the transfers.
okay. - Okay?
what am I supposed to say?
you're supposed to say no.
it's not your job.
if you got a conflict here, if you have stakes in this that you're not telling me about, - Then I can't trust you. - Got it.
I'm okay.
can you tell him I'm coming in now?
who's taking the first dose?
anybody here got a long-standing case f neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?
how bad does it hurt?
you're looking to be the hero?
well, I've been beaten up a lot, and I can handle pain.
how old are you?
the guy's got a gun.
I think that covers the parental consent issue.
and that stuff can also cause nerve and muscle damage.
no way am I taking that crap. Come on.
you have to. It's the rules.
I'll do it.
this is a level of risk taking beyond anonymous girl-on-girl action.
they're patients. I'm a doctor.
with a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness.
everything's not some fascinating character flaw.
this is a genetic flaw.
this is your huntington's speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.
Yes, I have a shortened life span.
another reason why I'm objectively the right choice.
I would have laid money you had herpes.
your turn. So why are we here?
we've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love.
that just leaves... work?
you're defined by your work.
but you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time.
couldn't focus.
maybe you made a huge mistake... got fired.
I just want an answer.
I know. I'm asking why.
guy knew he wasn't coming back.
everything's laid out for us.
I'll check for toxins in the kitchen.
he must have $6, 000, $7, 000 in unpaid medical bills.
I've got debt too. - You don't see me acting like a lunatic.
there's no excuse for what he's doing, but you've got millions of people thousands of dollars in debt because they're sick
at least one of them's gonna do something inexcusable.
especially if it works.
white blood cell count's normal.
it's not infection.
so either his heart's on the fritz, or he's got cancer.
found a picture of his mom.
she's got a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.
classic signs of an upper-lobe tumor.
or she's just ugly.
there are also classic signs of an adrenal problem.
it's his heart.
you can't be sure what.
his neck. Distended jugular.
what are you doing?
I am going to try to strangle you faster than you can pull a trigger.
he needs to check your pulse.
it's racing.
we need to get paddles.
or maybe we could just do nothing.
if I get any weaker...
and they don't fix it... I'll shoot... you!
don't. He didn't mean to.
shut up! All of you.
what are. - What are you doing? What are you doing?
carotid massage... Gotta slow your heart.
it's 200.
well, get the paddles.
whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract.
they don't discriminate against trigger fingers.
nobody gets my gun.
send in paddles! - Don't!
get the damn paddles! Or I'll shoot you.
threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense.
actually doingt, not so much.
give him your gun so he can save you.
just let him die. - Bill, stop.
we can cardiovert chemically.
if we don't know what kind of heart rhythm it is.
if we don't try something, he's gonna kill someone. I'm gonna get the drugs.
no one goes anywhere!
if she doesn't come back, you've got plenty of something, you...come here.
all right... 30 seconds.
she's gonna go.
she's gonna come back.
she should go.
he'll kill him.
but not her.
that your version of morality?
if you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself.
shoot me.
you really want. - Yes.
no, no! She just needs time!
she just needs more time to find the right. - The right drug.
it's me.
she takes it first.
adenosine slows the heart.
which is fine, if it's beating fast like yours.
not fine if it's normal, like hers.
following the math on this?
she takes everything I take.
I don't want anything that cross-reacts.
the martyr's heart is beating dangerously slow.
are we good to go?
your heart's back to normal. No tachycardia.
no sign of a heart defect at all.
but you're sweating.
I nearly had a heart attack.
you're surprised I'm sweating?
on one side of your face, but not the other.
what does that mean?
a tumor is pressing on your sympathetic nerves.
you have lung cancer.
pulse is down below 50.
so's her I. Q.
help her up. Get her heart going faster.
I need proof it's cancer.
of course you do!
it's gotta be a pancoast tumor.
patient's got dyspnea, seventh-nerve palsy.
he's sweating on one side of his face.
everything okay in there?
take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
lung cancer usually shows up lower than the seventh nerve.
did you check his throat?
spit on the floor. - What?
if I do it, I can't tell cuddy that it was medically necessary.
I'm gonna ask you to pisson her chair next.
dry mouth. His parotid glands aren't working.
it there's swelling, it's a pancoast tumor that's metastasized.
feel that. Right there.
if it's cancer, there must be a test.
you just did it.
what about an x-ray or something?
good idea. Oh, damn. I left my CT machine in my other pants.
how many hostages do you think it would cost me for a trip to radiology?
so... what made you snap?
Hmos? - Shut up.
Nah, you saw 16 doctors.
how bad could they have been? - Shut up!
humiliation?
doctors treating you like a piece of meat?
too many fingers and tubes up your holes.
you hate doctors. You want to take back control.
if so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat.
I just want an answer.
that's all.
everyone stays in here with me.
if you need anything from in there, get it now.
move around.
anyone moves... I fire.
that's not all.
curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.
you never did anything just because you had to know?
never shot anyone.
you're not me.
this is my body. This is my life.
and there's a truth out there.
I'd rather rot in jail knowing than...
I can't handle not knowing.
Yeah.
hold that.
you want your answer, you gotta give me the gun.
what's this?
starburst artifact.
the metal from the gun is ruining the image.
show him.
starburst.
now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying.
so you have two choices.
you can give me the gun and get your answer.
or you can shoot me.
I'm not gonna give you the gun.
why did he release you?
house got him to give up his gun.
we just ran.
why are you still here?
curious.
it's safe now, right?
theye gonna be through that door any moment. Just show me the tumor.
there isn't one.
I don't know what you have.
so...
it's over.
thanks for trying.
you had four theories. You ruled out four theories.
maybe no one can cure me.
he overpowered me and got the gun back.
you're a coward.
you need to know everything because you're afraid to be wrong.
raid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor, just another human being, that you'll risk other people's lives.
I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death.
you just want to cheat it by making it come sooner.
gives you the illusion of control.
can I go?
sorry. We might need you.
how do they expect me to think?
is he lying?
why would he do that?
over time, hostages start to root for the captor.
house isn't the rooting kind.
no, he's the obsessive, defiant kind.
mic the door. Get a frame charge.
I hope your boyfriend knows what he's doing.
are you insane?
he's quick for a sick guy.
dyspnea, anemia, seventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia.
long passes. Anything. Go.
I don't believe it.
chase was right. You're gonna kill someone.
I don't want to be a part oit.
loa loa filariasis.
you ever been to cameroon or on the ogowe river? Next.
could be q fever if he's had exposure to goats.
no goats.
histiocytosis x explains the lung involvement and.
we have a new symptom.
he is turning his head, favoring his left ear.
means he's partially deaf in the right.
three hours ago, he had superhero hearing.
Cushing's causes fatigue, breathing problems, fluctuating hearing.
even increased aggression and risk-taking.
I'm doing this by choice. It's not a symptom.
we'll keep that between us till you talk to your lawyer.
I need dexamethasone and enough time to provoke a respiratory reaction and confirm cushing's syndrome.
you need more time? House, we're negotiating with you.
actually, we're through negotiating.
I've still got three hostages left.
I'll give you one.
and no more testing drugs on a sick doctor.
fine. Send in the drugs.
son, come here, come here.
house, you can't.
if you have cushing's, this will slow your breathing.
give it to her first.
those were not the terms.
I lied. These drugs could be fake.
why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
you wouldn't. They would.
she has huntington's.
if these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver.
chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand.
don't do.
how long do you have to live?
eight, ten years.
killing her is your chance to get personal?
Huntington's doesn't have. - Doesn't have a cure?
no.
so if we get out of here.
if she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs.
take a deep breath.
not knowing what was wrong with me...
made me miserable.
maybe that's insane. Doing this...
Yeah. Insane.
but I had something to gain.
you can't take risks with no upside at all.
I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.
heart's racing. Fever.
and your breathing's unchanged.
that means... - Means I was wrong.
her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
we have to get her out of here.
the dexamethasone is making thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the patient's. - why?
this guy's beenon 50 different medications.
maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.
I need to slap you.
for diagnostic purposes.
seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin.
that twitch is chvostek's sign.
don't ask me how chvostek discovered it.
he has calcium deficiency.
drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage.
he's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.
those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years.
he has something that has a long incubation period.
something that should have wrecked his kidneys.
something that explains breathing problems, heart problems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.
leishmaniasis.
would make perfect sense if our patient was an arabian bedouin.
melioidosis.
bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart.
it explains everything.
except that if you read the history, you'd know that our patient has never been to a tropical climate!
is he absolutely sure of that? Mexico. Costarica. You've never been
I've never been anywhere south of florida.
you idiot.
florida counts?
well, not to the supreme court.
but it's warm enough for germs.
you keep blaming doctors when you can't even give a halfway decent history.
negotiation's over.
it will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
he comes out, he gets all the medicine he wants.
you can have Dr. House.
why are you getting rid of me?
I need to trade you for the answer.
you're gonna give her the meds. - No...
come on, give 'em to me instead.
she's taken everything I've taken.
the combination of meds could knock me out.
her kidneys are failing.
you give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.
I need my answer.
your obsession is gonna kill her!
your obsession gave me back the gun!
it is pointless to give her those drugs.
even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.
only if you're right.
house, get out of here.
shut up. I'm not leaving.
who's the martyr now?
either the drugs kill me or he kills me.
doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.
you really don't feel bad about killing me?
not if you don't feel bad about killing yourself.
I don't want to die. - Yeah, you do.
you just don't have the nerve to actually do it.
you just want it out of your control. Well, it is.
cause I've got a gun.
don't do this.
either I do this with you alive, or...
please. Sometimes you just have to trust people.
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
why are you still alive?
he didn't make me take it.
a week of temporary dialysis, your kidneys will be okay.
I'm sorry I backed out of the differential.
about that huntington's drug trial.
test confirmed melioidosis.
easy to miss on a stain.
scans and x-rays vary widely.
is that all you care about?
a moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him every step.
if he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead.
good thing you enabled my every medical move.
you think I handled this differently because you were in here?
I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
this is why you and i can't be a thing.
if you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship withe,
I don't know how I can help you.
cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is...
you want a relationship?
God, no. Just trying to follow your logic.
excuse me. I've been waiting here for over an hour.
all I need is a refill on my migraine medication.
we'll get to you as soon as we can.
you can get to me now.
it'll only take you two minutes.
you're not an emergency.
this isn't an emergency room.
and it's not gonna go any faster by pissing me off.
got a minute? - No.
a routine checkup can wait. What else you got?
I'm consulting on some clinical trials that involve C. N.S. Compounds.
while it's true that no sometimes means yes, in this context...
one's a new huntington's drug.
phase three trials are showing real results delaying neuronal degenetion.
I can probably get you in.
no, thanks.
are you doing anything about your disease, following any kind of program?
no. Nor am I looking for a consult.
excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.
well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk.
either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished.
do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone.
sorry.
nice try. Love to help.
shut up!
you wanted to see doctor. - I said shut up.
I'm sick, and I want to know why.
I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now...
or I'm gonna start killing people.
what seems to be the problem?
close those blinds.
you, push the sofa in front of that door.
you, move that table in front of the other door.
now!
okay, okay. Just move it.
you know, you don't have to point the gun man.
we're gonna do whatever you want.
no, we're not.
that's a bathroom you're barricading.
it might come in handy, especially since you've cleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.
do it!
my medical records. I need you to read them.
you really think that reenacting dog day afternoon is the best way to get diagnosed?
I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through.
I've been to 16 doctors in the last two years.
had three full-body cts and two mris, seven blood panels, and one homeopathic consult.
and all that was missing was the threat of violence.
what's missing is an answer!
I can't breathe!
I'm tired... all the time.
I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.
that's a cool constellation of symptoms.
it could be something minor.
at least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists.
shut up and do your job.
you barely looked at the file.
no need. Symptoms...
those are the things you keep whining about.
Tests--negative, or you wouldn't be here.
history. - Shy, quiet kid. Kept to himself.
collected comic books and missing children.
excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.
next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it.
I'll be okay.
if you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict.
what kind of breathing problems?
shortness of breath.
and sharp pain when I inhale.
so you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right?
me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health problem.
since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health.
I've never been married.
got a match? - Why?
because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
I'll look in Cuddy's desk. - Stay out of the desk!
Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does.
no, I don't. - Right.
you just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.
look, sir, I've never smoked in my life, okay?
jerk.
you figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?
I'm sorry. It's just... I got a lighter.
slowly.
hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out.
decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain.
an intermittent rash could be 100 things.
if you add on that final symptom, it can only be lmonary scleroderma.
what final symptom? Those were all my symptoms.
last one is the 16 doctors who missed it.
simple alkylating agent, case solved.
see you on visitor's day.
crime scene!
house, what's going on in there? Is everyone all right?
about to be. Assuming he's not lying.
but he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me.
I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma.
then we all get to go home.
Propofol? You sure?
have one of the guards bring it in. - No, no guards. No cops.
uh, I'll go get it.
no one's leaving.
she's not a cop? Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs. Alone.
she might be armed.
I'd have her deliver it shirtless.
who is it?
Oh, god, House. Maybe we should wait for.
guys with even bigger guns?
who know how to talk to armed. - Say good-bye or I shoot her.
roll up your sleeve.
give it to someone else first.
you're the only one who needs it.
give it to someone else.
if it goes in okay, you can givea second dose to me.
I don't care who. Just pick someone.
again, had your brilliant plan included a roomful of hostages that don't have fetuses, bacterial and fungal infections, leaving their immune systems too week to de with the metabolic strain, or are already on pain killers that have fatal interactions...
he's not on pain killers.
I heard him tell her in the clinic.
Aw, come on, man.
don't take it out on us.
you got a problem with doctors? Take it out on the doctors.
give it to her.
she's sick.
you are a very large creep.
take off your shirt.
satisfied? - Fine.
roll up your sleeve.
you think I'm an idiot? That's what you think?
I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size.
you're not gonna do anything.
you still need me.
come on!
what are you doing? He didn't do anything.
you're right. I need you.
I also need you to know you can't screw with me.
it's for you.
lieutenant Bowman, princeton swat.
Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of medicine.
we just heard a gunshot, but I haven't been able to make contact.
we'll handle that once we secure our perimeter and set up our positions.
by "perimeters,"I assume you mean snipers?
we have to put an end to this.
got a husband in there or a loved one?
uh, no.
don't worry, we'll decide when to start shooting.
house is gonna get someone killed.
the guy's ready to kill for a diagnosis,
I can't think of a better doctor to be trapped in there with him.
how 'bout someone who's not gonna keep pushing th whack job's buttons until he cracks?
it's House.
Joe's bar and grill.
it's Foreman, and every fellow you've had in the last five years.
what causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?
this is pathetic.
if I strap a bomb to my chest, do I get seven doctors attendg to me?
Dr. Robert chase.
on the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.
do you think he's the only guy in new jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol?
I'm not playing this game.
Seriously? You're walking out?
no, he's just kidding. He's right here.
throw me that marker, will you?
chest pain, the lung problems, fatigue, rash.
sounds like chronic lung infection.
heart palpitations and fatigue could be a cancer that's spread from the lungs.
next!
if his diaphragm's not working, maybe his nerves are freezing up.
I think he's going into shock.
first rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!
the shortest distance between stomach pain and insomnia is bad circulation.
plus troubled breathing. Could be a heart defect.
you needed to write four things down to remember 'em?
it's not my wall.
you're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood.
run tests for infection and cancer.
cameron, comb through his medical records.
see if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed uphis heart.
Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins.
873 marshall, south brunswick.
back window's unlocked.
giving out your address.
clearly you're not going back there.
means you do have an end game.
I'm lieutenant Bowman. How's everyone doing in there?
got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious.
unfortunately, not the guy we hoped.
we're gonna need someone to deliver his blood.
it's gonna be hard to play doctor. - shut up.
open that blind. Just a few inches.
why me? - Just open it. Open it!
why me? Anyone can do it. Why pick me?
get back! Get back!
I will kill her unless you back the hell out of there now!
interesting.
anybody else hear those guys outside?
anybody?
he's got hyperacusis.
what does that mean?
it means we have a favorite.
it's nerve related.
amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.
puff out your cheeks. Come on.
big mug shot smile.
left side facial weakness.
seventh nerve palsy.
plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines.
it's post-herpetic neuralgia.
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?
I'm not judging here.
this thing is just as likely to be caused by chicken pox.
I need proof now.
there is a test.
it's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless.
but you make a good point.
you need proof now. I'll order up the test.
if you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in.
it only hurts if your diagnosis is wrong?
win-win.
Jason, don't hang up the phone again.
you're gonna send in...
capsaicin. 200 micrograms.
and two syringes this time.
and we'll give you the blood and his records.
no more meds, Jason, and no deliveries without something in return.
you've gotta give us a hostage.
you can have two.
great. Then I'll send an officer right in with the transfer.
everything gets brought in by Dr. Cuddy.
Jason, I'm not gonna let her do that.
first, - Don't use his name so much.
it doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy.
second. - Come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication.
he's gonna shoot hostages if she doesn't bring it in.
I'll get back to you.
the guy's demanding that you do all the transfers.
okay. - Okay?
what am I supposed to say?
you're supposed to say no.
it's not your job.
if you got a conflict here, if you have stakes in this that you're not telling me about, - Then I can't trust you. - Got it.
I'm okay.
can you tell him I'm coming in now?
who's taking the first dose?
anybody here got a long-standing case f neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?
how bad does it hurt?
you're looking to be the hero?
well, I've been beaten up a lot, and I can handle pain.
how old are you?
the guy's got a gun.
I think that covers the parental consent issue.
and that stuff can also cause nerve and muscle damage.
no way am I taking that crap. Come on.
you have to. It's the rules.
I'll do it.
this is a level of risk taking beyond anonymous girl-on-girl action.
they're patients. I'm a doctor.
with a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness.
everything's not some fascinating character flaw.
this is a genetic flaw.
this is your huntington's speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.
Yes, I have a shortened life span.
another reason why I'm objectively the right choice.
I would have laid money you had herpes.
your turn. So why are we here?
we've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love.
that just leaves... work?
you're defined by your work.
but you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time.
couldn't focus.
maybe you made a huge mistake... got fired.
I just want an answer.
I know. I'm asking why.
guy knew he wasn't coming back.
everything's laid out for us.
I'll check for toxins in the kitchen.
he must have $6, 000, $7, 000 in unpaid medical bills.
I've got debt too. - You don't see me acting like a lunatic.
there's no excuse for what he's doing, but you've got millions of people thousands of dollars in debt because they're sick
at least one of them's gonna do something inexcusable.
especially if it works.
white blood cell count's normal.
it's not infection.
so either his heart's on the fritz, or he's got cancer.
found a picture of his mom.
she's got a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.
classic signs of an upper-lobe tumor.
or she's just ugly.
there are also classic signs of an adrenal problem.
it's his heart.
you can't be sure what.
his neck. Distended jugular.
what are you doing?
I am going to try to strangle you faster than you can pull a trigger.
he needs to check your pulse.
it's racing.
we need to get paddles.
or maybe we could just do nothing.
if I get any weaker...
and they don't fix it... I'll shoot... you!
don't. He didn't mean to.
shut up! All of you.
what are. - What are you doing? What are you doing?
carotid massage... Gotta slow your heart.
it's 200.
well, get the paddles.
whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract.
they don't discriminate against trigger fingers.
nobody gets my gun.
send in paddles! - Don't!
get the damn paddles! Or I'll shoot you.
threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense.
actually doingt, not so much.
give him your gun so he can save you.
just let him die. - Bill, stop.
we can cardiovert chemically.
if we don't know what kind of heart rhythm it is.
if we don't try something, he's gonna kill someone. I'm gonna get the drugs.
no one goes anywhere!
if she doesn't come back, you've got plenty of something, you...come here.
all right... 30 seconds.
she's gonna go.
she's gonna come back.
she should go.
he'll kill him.
but not her.
that your version of morality?
if you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself.
shoot me.
you really want. - Yes.
no, no! She just needs time!
she just needs more time to find the right. - The right drug.
it's me.
she takes it first.
adenosine slows the heart.
which is fine, if it's beating fast like yours.
not fine if it's normal, like hers.
following the math on this?
she takes everything I take.
I don't want anything that cross-reacts.
the martyr's heart is beating dangerously slow.
are we good to go?
your heart's back to normal. No tachycardia.
no sign of a heart defect at all.
but you're sweating.
I nearly had a heart attack.
you're surprised I'm sweating?
on one side of your face, but not the other.
what does that mean?
a tumor is pressing on your sympathetic nerves.
you have lung cancer.
pulse is down below 50.
so's her I. Q.
help her up. Get her heart going faster.
I need proof it's cancer.
of course you do!
it's gotta be a pancoast tumor.
patient's got dyspnea, seventh-nerve palsy.
he's sweating on one side of his face.
everything okay in there?
take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
lung cancer usually shows up lower than the seventh nerve.
did you check his throat?
spit on the floor. - What?
if I do it, I can't tell cuddy that it was medically necessary.
I'm gonna ask you to pisson her chair next.
dry mouth. His parotid glands aren't working.
it there's swelling, it's a pancoast tumor that's metastasized.
feel that. Right there.
if it's cancer, there must be a test.
you just did it.
what about an x-ray or something?
good idea. Oh, damn. I left my CT machine in my other pants.
how many hostages do you think it would cost me for a trip to radiology?
so... what made you snap?
Hmos? - Shut up.
Nah, you saw 16 doctors.
how bad could they have been? - Shut up!
humiliation?
doctors treating you like a piece of meat?
too many fingers and tubes up your holes.
you hate doctors. You want to take back control.
if so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat.
I just want an answer.
that's all.
everyone stays in here with me.
if you need anything from in there, get it now.
move around.
anyone moves... I fire.
that's not all.
curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.
you never did anything just because you had to know?
never shot anyone.
you're not me.
this is my body. This is my life.
and there's a truth out there.
I'd rather rot in jail knowing than...
I can't handle not knowing.
Yeah.
hold that.
you want your answer, you gotta give me the gun.
what's this?
starburst artifact.
the metal from the gun is ruining the image.
show him.
starburst.
now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying.
so you have two choices.
you can give me the gun and get your answer.
or you can shoot me.
I'm not gonna give you the gun.
why did he release you?
house got him to give up his gun.
we just ran.
why are you still here?
curious.
it's safe now, right?
theye gonna be through that door any moment. Just show me the tumor.
there isn't one.
I don't know what you have.
so...
it's over.
thanks for trying.
you had four theories. You ruled out four theories.
maybe no one can cure me.
he overpowered me and got the gun back.
you're a coward.
you need to know everything because you're afraid to be wrong.
raid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor, just another human being, that you'll risk other people's lives.
I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death.
you just want to cheat it by making it come sooner.
gives you the illusion of control.
can I go?
sorry. We might need you.
how do they expect me to think?
is he lying?
why would he do that?
over time, hostages start to root for the captor.
house isn't the rooting kind.
no, he's the obsessive, defiant kind.
mic the door. Get a frame charge.
I hope your boyfriend knows what he's doing.
are you insane?
he's quick for a sick guy.
dyspnea, anemia, seventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia.
long passes. Anything. Go.
I don't believe it.
chase was right. You're gonna kill someone.
I don't want to be a part oit.
loa loa filariasis.
you ever been to cameroon or on the ogowe river? Next.
could be q fever if he's had exposure to goats.
no goats.
histiocytosis x explains the lung involvement and.
we have a new symptom.
he is turning his head, favoring his left ear.
means he's partially deaf in the right.
three hours ago, he had superhero hearing.
Cushing's causes fatigue, breathing problems, fluctuating hearing.
even increased aggression and risk-taking.
I'm doing this by choice. It's not a symptom.
we'll keep that between us till you talk to your lawyer.
I need dexamethasone and enough time to provoke a respiratory reaction and confirm cushing's syndrome.
you need more time? House, we're negotiating with you.
actually, we're through negotiating.
I've still got three hostages left.
I'll give you one.
and no more testing drugs on a sick doctor.
fine. Send in the drugs.
son, come here, come here.
house, you can't.
if you have cushing's, this will slow your breathing.
give it to her first.
those were not the terms.
I lied. These drugs could be fake.
why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
you wouldn't. They would.
she has huntington's.
if these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver.
chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand.
don't do.
how long do you have to live?
eight, ten years.
killing her is your chance to get personal?
Huntington's doesn't have. - Doesn't have a cure?
no.
so if we get out of here.
if she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs.
take a deep breath.
not knowing what was wrong with me...
made me miserable.
maybe that's insane. Doing this...
Yeah. Insane.
but I had something to gain.
you can't take risks with no upside at all.
I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.
heart's racing. Fever.
and your breathing's unchanged.
that means... - Means I was wrong.
her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
we have to get her out of here.
the dexamethasone is making thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the patient's. - why?
this guy's beenon 50 different medications.
maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.
I need to slap you.
for diagnostic purposes.
seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin.
that twitch is chvostek's sign.
don't ask me how chvostek discovered it.
he has calcium deficiency.
drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage.
he's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.
those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years.
he has something that has a long incubation period.
something that should have wrecked his kidneys.
something that explains breathing problems, heart problems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.
leishmaniasis.
would make perfect sense if our patient was an arabian bedouin.
melioidosis.
bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart.
it explains everything.
except that if you read the history, you'd know that our patient has never been to a tropical climate!
is he absolutely sure of that? Mexico. Costarica. You've never been
I've never been anywhere south of florida.
you idiot.
florida counts?
well, not to the supreme court.
but it's warm enough for germs.
you keep blaming doctors when you can't even give a halfway decent history.
negotiation's over.
it will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
he comes out, he gets all the medicine he wants.
you can have Dr. House.
why are you getting rid of me?
I need to trade you for the answer.
you're gonna give her the meds. - No...
come on, give 'em to me instead.
she's taken everything I've taken.
the combination of meds could knock me out.
her kidneys are failing.
you give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.
I need my answer.
your obsession is gonna kill her!
your obsession gave me back the gun!
it is pointless to give her those drugs.
even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.
only if you're right.
house, get out of here.
shut up. I'm not leaving.
who's the martyr now?
either the drugs kill me or he kills me.
doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.
you really don't feel bad about killing me?
not if you don't feel bad about killing yourself.
I don't want to die. - Yeah, you do.
you just don't have the nerve to actually do it.
you just want it out of your control. Well, it is.
cause I've got a gun.
don't do this.
either I do this with you alive, or...
please. Sometimes you just have to trust people.
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
why are you still alive?
he didn't make me take it.
a week of temporary dialysis, your kidneys will be okay.
I'm sorry I backed out of the differential.
about that huntington's drug trial.
test confirmed melioidosis.
easy to miss on a stain.
scans and x-rays vary widely.
is that all you care about?
a moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him every step.
if he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead.
good thing you enabled my every medical move.
you think I handled this differently because you were in here?
I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
this is why you and i can't be a thing.
if you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship withe,
I don't know how I can help you.
cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is...
you want a relationship?
God, no. Just trying to follow your logic.
excuse me. I've been waiting here for over an hour.
we'll get to you as soon as we can.
you can get to me now.
it'll only take you two minutes.
you're not an emergency.
this isn't an emergency room.
and it's not gonna go any faster by pissing me off.
got a minute? - No.
a routine checkup can wait. What else you got?
I'm consulting on some clinical trials that involve C. N.S. Compounds.
while it's true that no sometimes means yes, in this context...
one's a new huntington's drug.
phase three trials are showing real results delaying neuronal degenetion.
I can probably get you in.
no, thanks.
are you doing anything about your disease, following any kind of program?
no. Nor am I looking for a consult.
excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.
well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk.
either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished.
do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone.
sorry.
nice try. Love to help.
shut up!
you wanted to see doctor-- - I said shut up.
I'm sick, and I want to know why.
I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now or I'm gonna start killing people.
what seems to be the problem?
close those blinds.
you, push the sofa in front of that door.
you, move that table in front of the other door.
now!
okay, okay. Just move it.
you know, you don't have to point the gun, man.
we're gonna do whatever you want.
no, we're not.
that's a bathroom you're barricading.
it might come in handy, especially since you've cleverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage.
do it!
my medical records. I need you to read them.
you really think that reenacting dog day afternoon is the best way to get diagnosed?
I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through.
I've been to 16 doctors in the last two years.
had three full-body CTs and two MRIs, seven blood panels, and one homeopathic consult.
and all that was missing was the threat of violence.
what's missing is an answer!
I can't breathe!
I'm tired... all the time.
I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.
that's a cool constellation of symptoms.
it could be something minor.
at least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists.
shut up and do your job.
you barely looked at the file.
no need. Symptoms...
those are the things you keep whining about.
Tests--negative, or you wouldn't be here.
collected comic books and missing children.
excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.
next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it.
I'll be okay.
if you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict.
what kind of breathing problems?
shortness of breath.
and sharp pain when I inhale.
so you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right?
me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health problem.
since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health.
I've never been married.
got a match? - Why?
because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
I'll look in cuddy's desk. - Stay out of the desk!
Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does.
no, I--I don't. - Right.
you just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.
look, sir, I've never smoked in my life, okay?
jerk.
you figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?
I'm sorry. It's just... I got a lighter.
slowly.
hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out.
decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain.
an intermittent rash-- could be 100 things.
if you add on that final symptom, it can only be lmonary scleroderma.
what final symptom? Those were all my symptoms.
last one is the 16 doctors who missed it.
simple alkylating agent, case solved.
see you on visitor's day.
crime scene!
house, what's going on in there? Is everyone all right?
about to be. Assuming he's not lying.
but he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me.
I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma.
then we all get to go home.
Propofol? You sure
have one of the guards bring it in. - No, no guards. No cops.
uh, I'll go get it.
no one's leaving.
she's not a cop? Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs. Alone.
she might be armed.
I'd have her deliver it shirtless.
who is it?
Oh, god, House. Maybe we should wait for guys with even bigger guns?
who know how to talk to armed-- - say good-bye or I shoot her.
roll up your sleeve.
give it to someone else first.
you're the only one who needs it.
give it to someone else.
if it goes in okay, you can give a second dose to me.
I don't care who. Just pick someone.
he's not on pain killers.
I heard him tell her in the clinic.
Aw, come on, man.
don't take it out on us.
you got a problem with doctors? Take it out on the doctors.
give it to her.
she's sick.
you are a very large creep.
take off your shirt.
satisfied? - Fine.
roll up your sleeve.
you think I'm an idiot? That's what you think?
I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size.
you're not gonna do anything.
you still need me.
come on!
what are you doing? He didn't do anything.
you're right. I need you.
I also need you to know you can't screw with me.
it's for you.
lieutenant Bowman, Princeton Swat.
Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of Medicine.
we just heard a gunshot, but I haven't been able to make contact.
we'll handle that once we secure our perimeter and set up our positions.
by "perimeters,"I assume you mean snipers?
we have to put an end to this.
got a husband in there or a loved one?
uh, no.
don't worry, we'll decide when to start shooting.
house is gonna get someone killed.
the guy's ready to kill for a diagnosis,
I can't think of a better doctor to be trapped in there with him.
how 'bout someone who's not gonna keep pushing th whack job's buttons until he cracks?
it's House.
Joe's bar and grill.
it's foreman, and every fellow you've had in the last five years.
what causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?
this is pathetic.
Dr. Robert Chase.
on the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.
do you think he's the only guy in new jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol?
I'm not playing this game.
Seriously? You're walking out?
no, he's just kidding. He's right here.
throw me that marker, will you?
chest pain, the lung problems, fatigue, rash.
sounds like chronic lung infection.
heart palpitations and fatigue-- could be a cancer that's spread from the lungs.
next!
if his diaphragm's not working, maybe his nerves are freezing up.
I think he's going into shock.
first rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!
the shortest distance between stomach pain and insomnia is bad circulation.
plus troubled breathing. Could be a heart defect.
you needed to write four things down to remember 'em?
it's not my wall.
you're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood.
run tests for infection and cancer.
cameron, comb through his medical records.
see if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed uphis heart.
Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins.
873 Marshall, South Brunswick.
back window's unlocked.
giving out your address.
clearly you're not going back there.
means you do have an end game.
I'm Lieutenant Bowman. How's everyone doing in there?
got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious.
unfortunately, not the guy we hoped.
we're gonna need someone to deliver his blood.
it's gonna be hard to play doctor-- - shut up.
open that blind. Just a few inches.
why me? - Just open it. Open it!
why me? Anyone can do it. Why pick me?
get back! Get back!
I will kill her unless you back the hell out of there now!
interesting.
anybody else hear those guys outside?
anybody?
he's got hyperacusis.
what does that mean?
it means we have a favorite.
it's nerve related.
amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.
puff out your cheeks. Come on.
big mug shot smile.
left side facial weakness.
seventh nerve palsy.
plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines.
it's post-herpetic neuralgia.
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?
I'm not judging here.
this thing is just as likely to be caused by chicken pox.
I need proof now.
there is a test.
it's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless.
you need proof now. I'll order up the test.
if you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in.
it only hurts if your diagnosis is wrong?
win-win.
Jason, don't hang up the phone again.
you're gonna send in capsaicin. 200 micrograms.
and two syringes this time.
and we'll give you the blood and his records.
no more meds, jason, and no deliveries without something in return.
you've gotta give us a hostage.
you can have two.
great. Then I'll send an officer right in with the transfer.
everything gets brought in by Dr. Cuddy.
Jason, I'm not gonna let her do that.
First--don't use his name so much.
it doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy.
Second--come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication.
he's gonna shoot hostages if she doesn't bring it in.
I'll get back to you.
the guy's demanding that you do all the transfers.
okay. - Okay?
what am I supposed to say?
you're supposed to say no.
it's not your job.
if you got a conflict here, if you have stakes in this that you're not telling me about, - then I can't trust you. - Got it.
I'm okay.
can you tell him I'm coming in now?
who's taking the first dose?
anybody here got a long-standing case f neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?
how bad does it hurt?
you're looking to be the hero?
well, I've been beaten up a lot, and I can handle pain.
how old are you?
the guy's got a gun.
I think that covers the parental consent issue.
and that stuff can also cause nerve and muscle damage.
no way am I taking that crap. Come on.
you have to. It's the rules.
I'll do it.
they're patients. I'm a doctor.
with a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness.
everything's not some fascinating character flaw.
this is a genetic flaw.
this is your Huntington's speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.
Yes, I have a shortened life span.
another reason why I'm objectively the right choice.
I would have laid money you had herpes.
your turn. So why are we here?
we've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love.
that just leaves... work?
you're defined by your work.
but you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time.
couldn't focus.
maybe you made a huge mistake... got fired.
I just want an answer.
I know. I'm asking why.
guy knew he wasn't coming back.
Evything's laid out for us.
I'll check for toxins in the kitchen.
he must have $6, 000, $7, 000 in unpaid medical bills.
I've got debt too--you don't see me acting like a lunatic.
there's no excuse for what he's doing, but you've got millions of people thousands of dollars in debt because they're sick
at least one of them's gonna do something inexcusable.
especially if it works.
white blood cell count's normal.
it's not infection.
so either his heart's on the fritz, or he's got cancer.
found a picture of his mom.
she's got a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.
classic signs of an upper-lobe tumor.
or she's just ugly.
there are also classic signs of an adrenal problem.
it's his heart.
you can't be sure what
his neck. Distended jugular.
what are you doing?
I am going to try to strangle you faster than you can pull a trigger.
he needs to check your pulse.
it's racing.
we need to get paddles.
or maybe we could just do nothing.
if I get any weaker...
and they don't fix it... I'll shoot... you!
don't. He didn't mean to
shut up! All of you.
what are--what are you doing? What are you doing?
carotid massage... gotta slow your heart.
it's 200.
well, get the paddles.
whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract.
they don't discriminate against trigger fingers.
nobody gets my gun.
send in paddles! - Don't!
get the damn paddles! Or I'll shoot you.
threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense.
give him your gun so he can save you.
just let him die. - Bill, stop.
we can cardiovert chemically.
if we don't know what kind of heart rhythm it is
if we don't try something, he's gonna kill someone. I'm gonna get the drugs.
no one goes anywhere!
all right... 30 seconds.
she's gonna go.
she's gonna come back.
she should go.
he'll kill him.
but not her.
that your version of morality?
if you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself.
shoot me.
you really want-- - yes.
no, no! She just needs time!
she just needs more time to find the right-- the right drug
it's me.
she takes it first.
adenosine slows the heart.
which is fine, if it's beating fast like yours.
following the math on this?
she takes everything I take.
I don't want anything that cross-reacts.
the martyr's heart is beating dangerously slow.
are we good to go?
your heart's back to normal. No tachycardia.
no sign of a heart defect at all.
but you're sweating.
I nearly had a heart attack.
you're surprised I'm sweating?
on one side of your face, but not the other.
what does that mean?
a tumor is pressing on your sympathetic nerves.
you have lung cancer.
pulse is down below 50.
so's her I. Q.
help her up. Get her heart going faster.
I need proof it's cancer.
of course you do!
it's gotta be a pancoast tumor.
patient's got dyspnea, seventh-nerve palsy.
he's sweating on one side of his face.
everything okay in there?
take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
lung cancer usually shows up lower than the seventh nerve.
did you check his throat?
spit on the floor. - What?
if I do it, I can't tell Cuddy that it was medically necessary.
I'm gonna ask you to piss on her chair next.
dry mouth. His parotid glands aren't working.

if it's cancer, there must be a test.
you just did it.
what about an x-ray or something?

how many hostages do you think it would cost me for a trip to radiology?
so... what made you snap?
Hmos? - Shut up.
Nah, you saw 16 doctors.
how bad could they have been? - Shut up!

doctors treating you like a piece of meat?
too many fingers and tubes up your holes.
you hate doctors. You want to take back control.
if so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat.
I just want an answer.
that's all.

never shot anyone.
you're not me.
this is my body. This is my life.
and there's a truth out there.
I'd rather rot in jail knowing than...
I can't handle not knowing.
Yeah.
hold that.
you want your answer, you gotta give me the gun.
what's this?
starburst artifact.
the metal from the gun is ruining the image.
show him.
starburst.
now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were ever held hostage by a guy who needs a ct, we're not lying.
so you have two choices.
you can give me the gun and get your answer.
or you can shoot me.
I'm not gonna give you the gun.
why did he release you?
house got him to give up his gun.
we just ran.
why are you still here?
curious.
it's safe now, right?
theye gonna be through that door any moment. Just show me the tumor.
there isn't one.
I don't know what you have.

give it to her first.
those were not the terms.
I lied. These drugs could be fake.
why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
you wouldn't. They would.
she has Huntington's.
if these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver.
chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand
don't do
how long do you have to live?
eight, ten years.
killing her is your chance to get personal?
Huntington's doesn't have-- doesn't have a cure?
no.
so if we get out of here
if she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs.
take a deep breath.
not knowing what was wrong with me...
made me miserable.
maybe that's insane. Doing this...
Yeah. Insane.
but I had something to gain.
you can't take risks with no upside at all.
I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.
heart's racing. Fever.
and your breathing's unchanged.
that means... - means I was wrong.
her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
we have to get her out of here.
the dexamethasone is making thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the patient's--why?
this guy's been on 50 different medications.
maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.
I need to slap you.
for diagnostic purposes.
seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin.
that twitch is chvostek's sign.
don't ask me how chvostek discovered it.
he has calcium deficiency.
drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage.
he's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.
those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years.
he has something that has a long incubation period.
something that should have wrecked his kidneys.
something that explains breathing problems, heart problems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood.
leishmaniasis.
would make perfect sense if our patient was an arabian bedouin.
melioidosis.
bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart.
it explains everything.
except that if you read the history, you'd know that our patient has never been to a tropical climate!
is he absolutely sure of that? Mexico. Costa Rica. You've never been.
I've never been anywhere south of florida.
you idiot.
florida counts?
well, not to the supreme court.
but it's warm enough for germs.
you keep blaming doctors when you can't even give a halfway decent history.
negotiation's over.
it will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
he comes out, he gets all the medicine he wants.
you can have Dr. House.
why are you getting rid of me?
I need to trade you for the answer.
you're gonna give her the meds. - No...
come on, give 'em to me instead.
she's taken everything I've taken.
the combination of meds could knock me out.
her kidneys are failing.
you give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.
I need my answer.
your obsession is gonna kill her!
your obsession gave me back the gun!
it is pointless to give her those drugs.
even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis.
only if you're right.
house, get out of here.
shut up. I'm not leaving.
who's the martyr now?
either the drugs kill me or he kills me.
doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.
you really don't feel bad about killing me?
not if you don't feel bad about killing yourself.
I don't want to die. - Yeah, you do.
you just don't have the nerve to actually do it.
you just want it out of your control. Well, it is.
cause I've got a gun.
don't do this.
either I do this with you alive, or...
please. Sometimes you just have to trust people.
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
why are you still alive?
he didn't make me take it.
a week of temporary dialysis, your kidneys will be okay.
I'm sorry I backed out of the differential.
about that huntington's drug trial.
test confirmed melioidosis.
easy to miss on a stain.
scans and x-rays vary widely.
is that all you care about?
a moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him every step.
if he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead.
good thing you enabled my every medical move.
you think I handled this differently because you were in here?
I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
this is why you and i can't be a... thing.
if you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship withe,
I don't know how I can help you.
cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is...
you want a relationship?
God, no. Just trying to follow your logic.
do you want a lean body for summer?
well, the time to start is now.
no gimmicks, no crash diets, and absolutely no drugs.
think healthy and be healthy.
you can start now.
just pick up the phone and become the best you you can be.
cut! Going again.
sorry, did I mess up the commercial?
no, it's fine. Are you okay?
Ah, I think it's cramps.
Oh, I have burning on my side.
sit down, take a few minutes, and catch your breath.
everybody else keep running!
we're not filming.
we don't do this for the cameras. We do it for ourselves.
we can't go again with him sitting there.
fine, um, but that felt phony.
at least let me get a little workout.
maybe if i'm breathing as hard as they are,
I won't seem like such an evil task master.
all right, take five, guys.
how you feeling?
I think I'm ready to do this.
you sure? That's it. That's the way to fight through.
all right, concentrate on those knees.
lean into it. And lift.
lifting. - Come on, push it!
come on, you're almost at the top.
those eight steps are the difference between fat and thin.
seven, six, five, four! One more! Nice job!
you feel that burn?
that's your body carving out its new shape. - Okay.
don't sit. Just take it slow on the way down.
Oh, boy.
are you okay?
any idea why we're getting half as many requests for you as usual?
democrats' health care plan?
at least we have one case that looks intriguing.
30-year-old fitness trainer suddenly can't breathe.
collapses and breaks her ankle.
that's it? You're not gonna argue why this case is beneath you?
no point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.
you can't run away anyway.
that's just mean.
why are we still together?
we are going to our office.
pronoun confusion.
starts kicking in once you pass child-bearing age.
well, that's just mean.
my office was recently destroyed.
I thought I'd use the office of the doctor directly responsible.
I think the patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.
my desk won't fit in his cell.
you can use our outer office.
Where's Foreman and Thirteen?
down in the GRC.
thirteen started her clinical trials today.
what's Cuddy doing in your office?
other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?
these walls aren't soundproof. - I'm well aware.
normal ct means that her lung problem has the distinction of having nothing to do with her lungs.
steroids.
no one looks this fit without cheating.
anabolic steroids hack away at the immune system, left her open to a pulmonary infection.
Musclesandcurves.
my penis is so confused.
she's not on steroids.
her program's all about getting in shape naturally. - Exercising, eating right.
and you know this because?
she has infomercials to sell her DVDs.
what? I'm up late a lot.
and you actually believe what you see on tv.
go run the labs.
the labs are back. And there's no sign of steroid use.
can someone please read her file?
can someone please stop backseat differentialating?
what about allergies? She goes jogging every morning.
inhales car fumes during rush hour.
perfect, except that she was jogging half a mile from the nearest road.
in the cold.
cold air hits the lungs, sets off an attack.
exercise-induced asthma.
nice try.
except eia doesn't account for the elevated bp, if you'd read the file.
come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain.
her bp's fine. - I know.
exercise-induced asthma actually fits.
I know. You know. She can't know.
the only good way to test for eia is to recreate the conditions in which the attack occurred.
but we can't exactly make her run out in the cold on a broken ankle.
get creative.
it's gonna be okay.
any shortness of breath? Tightness in your chest?
feeling pretty good actually.
not even breathing hard.
O2 stats and lung capacity are still well within range.
your cuff's slipping down. You want to stop for a moment?
I'd rather not. Haven't had any exercise in two days.
take it you don't get a lot of fat in your diet.
I take it from your tone you think that's a bad thing.
do you ever indulge?
ha, there's more to life than indulging your every whim.
I didn't say every.
but a whim every now and then can make life a little.
you okay? Trouble breathing?
no, I feel fine. Why?
no pulse.
this isn't asthma.
there a lot of other people in the trial?
I'm taking over the people that already started it at mercy.
so pretty full. Stop.
one more time. No talking.
I shouldn't be here.
it's nepotism.
I know the guy running the drug trials, so I get a spot.
you have Huntington's, so you get a spot.
stop. One more time.
just the fingers. No mouth.
the point of this thing is to improve neural cell longevity.
which doesn't matter much before symptoms.
so you should give my spot to someone. - Shut up.
stop.
you can stop feeling guilty.
your best tapping rate was. 004 taps per millisecond.
means your nerves have started degenerating.
you wanna work in here? Fine. Me too.
we'll split the desk, 50-50.
that side's yours. This side's mine.
you're right. There's plenty of space here.
neither one of us needs all of it.
so that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.
did you say something?
I couldn't hear you from all the way over here on my side of the desk.
patient's heart stopped.
we shocked her back to sinus rhythm. She's stable.
test didn't set it off. Her ekg was normal.
well, she's consistent.
the lung problems had nothing to do with her lungs.
a heart problem that has nothing do with her heart.
something is strangling her system.
carcinoid tumor?
find it, cut it out.
can a leaking breast implant cause joint pain?
no. And she clearly doesn't have implants.
or joint pain. What's going on?
got another patient.
I set up an online second opinion clinic.
people who don't like or trust their doctors email symptoms.
I can knock off four or five cases over lunch.
clear two grand by emailing them back.
ascending colon's clean.
that's got to be illegal.
only in nine states, and this isn't one of them.
legal notice spells out it doesn't replace doctor's visits,
so there's no opportunity for malpractice.
how come you haven't said anything about this?
it's no big secret. I guess i'm just not very chatty.
you told us when you renewed your subscription tonational geographic.
small intestine looks clean. Moving into the pylorus.
so you don't mind if I tell House?
actually house may sort of mind because i sort of set it up in House's name.
nothing in the bile duct.
and by "set it up in his name," you mean?
I mean, it's Dr. Gregory House's second opinion clinic with medical advice direct from Dr. Gregory House.
you're insane. With two days to live.
house is never gonna find out.
he will if I tell him.
or you cut me in for 30% and I keep your secret safe.
that's blackmail. - Yes.
moving into the.
that's her stomach?
it's the size of a shot glass.
because our patient's a big, fat cheater.
subtle.
no way you geniuses could've spotted this.
gastric bypass surgery. She had her stomach stapled.
then had the records from her files pulled so it wouldn't ruin their DVD sales.
can you do this outside?
I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here.
where are the smart guys?
if you mean Foreman and Thirteen,
apparently the first appointment of the drug trial's an all-day thing.
I said yes to this?
her gastric bypass procedure could cause. - Forget the bypass.
treat her like a fat girl.
should we treat her like a 60-year-old asian man too? She's not fat.
not on the outside.
but on the inside, she's still tons of fun.
when she was obese, she probably had type two diabetes.
could've left her with permanent nerve damage.
ten points for doing what I said.
minus ten points for doing it badly.
if this was diabetes-induced rve damage, it would've kicked in years ago.
have you seen my balls?
can you hold on a second?
my balls. Have you seen my balls?
giant one and the red one.
your plan isn't gonna work. - It is.
I try to make you miserable to make you leave.
you deny that it's making you miserable.
you try to make me miserable so I'll stop making you miserable.
and eventually youwillleave, citing reasons that have nothing to do with misery.
you're not bothering me.
step one complete.
I'm gonna call you from my cell.
and then I will come back in here.
Yeah, I just had to explain to him that i had his balls and he's not getting them back.
scuse me.
sleep apnea explains.
apnea would've disappeared when she shrank.
not if it destroyed the musculature of her trachea.
apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain.
the resulting neurological damage. - She been snoring?
she didn't mention it.
did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep?
no, but. - This isn't apnea.
and this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.
cliff notes.
gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside.
on the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues.
private area, House. It can wait.
you need to consider side effects from her gastric bypass surgery.
forget the bypass. - Let the dying girl finish.
you said forget the.
Dr. Thirteen has the floor.
bypass could create malabsorption issues.
leads to low potassium.
very stupid. Her potassium's fine.
but her intestines aren't.
gastric bypass could cause malabsorption by creating a blind loop of bowel.
it ulcerates during exercise.
bacteria get loose in the bloodstream.
migrate to the heart and lungs.
very not stupid.
bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop.
get some and test it.
he could've come up with sibo anywhere else in the hospital.
you didn't need to come down here and screw with us.
but her wrong idea led to his right one.
it was vital screwing.
we think your surgery might've caused an infection called sibo.
stool tests will help us to confirm.
put some of what you're full of in here.
if surgery could somehow make you taller, wouldn't you do it?
sure.
but i wouldn't call a meeting of the lollipop guild
and tell them they can grow if they work real hard at it.
I don't tell anyone not to get gastric bypass.
I tell them how to get healthy.
how to improve their lives.
Yeah, by telling them to do what you were unwilling to.
I was willing to do anything.
thyroid, hormones, crash diets. - None of it worked.
my body was like a prison.
when i got the surgery, I got healthy.
and when i got healthy, I got happy.
I'm not sure you're happy.
but if you are, being healthy didn't do it. Being pretty did.
poop in the bedpan.
house's office? Really?
did he send you here to beg for it back?
well, there are dozens of other doctors.
other doctors actually use their offices for crazy stuff like seeing patients.
not throwing a ball against the wall and calling it work.
it's his process. That ball saves lives.
did he give you talking points?
Yeah, but I added one of my own.
don't take his office and pretend like all you're doing is taking his office.
you chose his room because you want to be there.
but sitting near him and hoping isn't gonna get it done.
leave here now, or I'll take your office.
no, you won't.
the boob lady emailed me again complaing of chronic fatigue now.
she's convinced the implants are responsible.
they're not. - I told her.
she says something is, and if I don't find out what she's gonna complain to the licensing board.
it's not funny. - It is.
you just can't appreciate it because it's gonna destroy your career.
what happened?
he call Foreman "clean and articulate" again?
it is surprising.
clinic patients just whining.
what's the poop?
it's gonna take about an hour to spin down the sample.
what are we looking for?
you don't know?
I'm doing my famous socrates impression.
think I really nailed the accent.
high fat content indicates sibo.
and what does fat do in water?
it floats.
what else floats in water?
correct answer is a duck.
if it doesn't float, kutner missed the boat.
looks like i was wrong to dismiss apnea.
you guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab.
what about all that scar tissue around the implant? Could that be.
that amount of encapsulation's perfectly normal.
well, I gotta tell her something.
tell her to find a decent plastic surgeon who can correct the placement.
Yeah, that's what she wants to hear, she's sick and she's lopsided.
tell her it's a virus.
it probably is, and it'll get her off your back for a few-- emmy's eeg is flatlining.
where would she have gone?
Hey, I looked for you guys in the control room, but you seemed busy.
get off there. Last time you exercised, you had a cardiac incident.
I feel fine.
you felt fine last time.
I only slept a couple hours, but I feel great.
can I get one of those machines?
you're running on a broken ankle.
it doesn't hurt.
and your leg is bleeding.
you feel that? - What does that mean?
numbness in her left foot is ascending into her leg.
how did she manage to sneak out for a run?
she said she needed to use the bathroom.
you two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?
alpha waves on the eeg ruled it out.
I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide for good and valid reasons and must've spilled some on my side.
did it waft over to your side?
cunning plan.
you do realize it's gonna stink for hours on both sides.
Oh, would you look at the time?
I hope your patient isn't still sick...
forcing you to stay here all night.
ascending numbness means her nerves are breaking down.
or her brain. - Or both.
we've gotta go. - Let me finish. I'll meet you down there.
you were 15 minutes late yesterday.
I don't want you to develop bad habits.
appreciate the life lesson, but 15 minutes give or take isn't gonna make a difference.
get started on your other patients.
I'll be down there when we're done here.
way to know where your bread is buttered, sister. Up high!
if the problem's in her brain, it could be ms.
or early onset parkinson's.
but if it's her nerves, it could be transverse myelitis.
or a million other things.
we're gonna stay in the dark until we can figure out
if her electrical problem is in her power station or in the high-tension wires.
power station's the brain. Wires are the nerves.
go run an NCV test.
the test will measure the amount of time it'll take this electrical impulse to travel along your nerves.
will it hurt? - No. Give me your arm.
you can ask nicely.
I learned at med school you don't actually cure with kindness.
you're right. I'm a hypocrite.
but I don't have a choice.
not really interested in your rationalizations.
if I'm open about the gastric bypass, no one would listen to me anymore.
you mean no one would buy your DVDs.
it's not about the DVD sales.
I'm helping people.
my clients are making themselves healthy.
they're living better lives.
can you honestly tell me you've never done anything hypocritical?
I'm sure you had good reasons.
give me your arm... Please?
keep your arm raised.
does this mean something is wrong with my nerves?
no. It's your muscles.
we don't need to run this test.
it's not what we thought.
she has muscle weakness. Could indicate myasthenia gravis.
Yep.
also could be some kind of toxin.
excuse me, are you going up to the personnel floors?
I'm going to see Dr. House.
do you have an appointment with him?
we've been emailing.
joint pain and fatigue thanks to these.
I'm sure it's nothing. - Oh, and now this.
he's actually downstairs. - Uh, gone. Gone for the day.
but, uh, we work for him. We can set you up in the E.R.
the antibiotics will make her feel better. She's outta here by morning.
if it is a staph infection. - It's gotta be.
she has sleeves of tattoos and piercings from god knows where.
she has muscle weakness.
could indicate myasthenia gravis.
I had the weirdest dream.
you guys did the test in a reasonable amount of time.
and came back here before i had time to fall asleep.
you guys still smell that?
maybe you should just let her have your office.
or...
she sends one of yours to the hospital, send one of hers to the morgue.
it's not myasthenia gravis.
her breathing's improving and the weakness is in her extremities.
could be a botulinum reaction.
I don't think sabotaging your boss' office is a wise counterattack.
all that is need for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.
she probably used a lot of botox to tighten up her skin. - True.
could also be any kind of heavy metal toxicity.
psp or arsenic from eating too much seafood.
cadmium from bad bottled water.
lead or nickel from canned fruits or natural grains.
I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.
it is now.
lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing: chelation.
you never showed up.
get out of my house.
I wanted to find proof that you were slipping back into your self-destructive pattern.
confirm you weren't worth my time.
instead, I found this.
you followed all of my instructions to the letter.
probably better than any patient I have.
so why are you the only one who can't show up for appointments?
I came down right after I was finished with House.
you were in your office with another patient.
and there was another patient in the waiting room.
I'm well-aware of what's gonna happen to my body over the next eight to ten years.
I do not need a visual reminder every time i walk into that place.
that's understandable.
it's human.
and you need to get over it.
now you show up on time tomorrow, or you don't show up at all.
your mom is leaving.
you're gonna regret this the rest of your life.
the chelation didn't work.
her muscles are still deteriorating.
rules out toxins.
so what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?
why aren't we doing this in your office?
obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture.
cuddy... Overreacted to my overreaction.
Coronaro-cardiac fistula. Even a small hole could cause.
this started in the lungs, not the heart.
and why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?
I'm sitting straight.
trouble in the land of false hope?
everything's fine. Austrian syndrome.
nice deflection.
but our patient doesn't drink. She's a health nut.
and even if I was a cynical guy and thought that she was a liar,
I'd have done a tox screen which would've come back negative for alcohol.
you should come to these gatherings more often.
keep you from looking like an idiot.
are you making book, or did something else happen to our patient?
personal. I'll put it on vibrate.
guillain-barre.
usually starts as a muscle pain patients compare to the pain of over-exercising.
so who's paging you? Your wife?
does it worry you that she paged kutner first?
guillain-barre fits.
patient didn't notice the initial symptoms because it's no different than how she feels every day.
her muscle weakness is the precursor to full paralysis.
gastric bypass probably set it off.
Oh, at what price beauty?
go start her on plasmapheresis.
she put the lime in the coconut, she drank it all up, she put the lime in the coconut, she drank it all up.
can you stop singing?
musical automatism.
she could be having a partial seizure right now.
you need to get house. - Dee dee!
yelling at her is not going to be an effective treatment.
she's faking. It's a cry for attention.
her brain could be misfiring.
right, a rare neurological disorder is far more likely than a cry for attention.
I mean, nothing about this woman screams look at me.
on the other hand, look at her.
she needs a full neurological work-up.
get House!
ultimate irony.
killed myself trying to make myself healthy.
you're not dying, okay?
this disease is manageable.
better start getting used to that wheelchair.
self-pity doesn't suit you.
just take me down to the. - No.
you're strong enough to walk.
come on, get your ass out of bed and walk.
could be an aneurysm.
we've got to control her blood pressure. Start her on a calcium channel blocker.
or... You could tell House.
we can't tell House.
you'll be in trouble.
on the other hand, she's sick.
she's singing.
and bleeding out of her ears, and losing her hair.
an aneurysm doesn't explain her joint pain.
Wilson's disease does.
no kayser-fleischer rings.
anorexia.
now you're just desperate.
biliary tumor causing pareneoplastic syndrome.
that might actually fit.
I'll scan to confirm.
you'd do that for me? - You don't have the time.
which means I can ask for 25% of your income and you'll give it to me.
you going over the fence?
took three visits, but I finally convinced the contractor that I'm Cuddy's boss.
and all the office renovation plans need to go through me.
you did do the math on this, right?
screwing with her office means her renovations will take longer.
means she will be in your office longer.
see there?
I'm having a bidet put in instead of a toilet.
not in addition to. Instead of.
you want to know what happened to the old toilet?
she'll be with you where you claim to not want her.
I smashed it with a sledgehammer.
I think in some ancient cultures that was actually considered a proposal of marriage.
is this fun for you?
analyzing everyone else's fun away?
ask her out.
it'll cost the hospital a lot less.
I brought some visitors. Cheer you up.
it's okay. Come on in, guys.
we're all staying on your plan. Nobody's cheating.
that's great.
uh, you're on my arm.
we found out about your gastric bypass.
how could you lie to us like that?
the doctors told you?
you're really hurting my arm.
you're not the best you you can be.
you're a fraud.
you're a self-hating fat person.
you're really hurting me.
feel the burn.
help!
get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me!
mood congruent hallucinations.
means it's not guillain-barre.
which means whatever it is, it's now in her brain.
where are you going?
sorry. Treatment.
does Foreman schedule your appointments by numbers on the clock
or just by when I'm in the middle of something?
sorry if I'm dying at a bad time for you.
could be CNS lymphoma.
so losing the 200 pounds was just a coincidence?
what about a prion disease?
if her brain is slowly turning into a swiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do.
there are some possible treatments.
get a brain biopsy to confirm.
you're not cutting into this woman's brain before you test.
thatisthe test.
not for cns lymphoma, which is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis.
one you can test for non-invasively.
you're obviously not opposed to being invasive.
rule out cns lymphoma first, then rule out astrocytoma, then rule out other brain tumors.
I hereby declare them ruled out.
run the tests.
you can do a brain biopsy, but only as a last resort.
start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not.
you're not stopping me for medical reasons.
you're stopping me...
because you have the hots for me.
you're still here because you have the hots for me.
evidenced by the fact that I'm the one who moved into your office.
it's the biggest office. And I'm not the one that destroyed
why are you dressed like that?
why do you try so hard to get my attention?
are you screwing with me?
are you screwing with me?
that depends on your answer.
everybody knows this is going somewhere.
I think we're supposed to kiss now.
we already did that.
it seemed like the logical next step. - Really?
I'm an idiot for being surprised.
can you leave these?
I'll keep coming, but can you change my appointment time?
can't. Schedule's full.
you're stuck with her. Might as well get to know her.
your head MRI was clean. Means you don't have CNS lymphoma.
what's next on the list?
other types of brain tumors.
can we stop at the cafeteria?
I can have something brought up for you. What do you want?
chocolate cake.
you can't give up. We're gonna figure this out.
what am I supposed to be hoping for?
that you find a brain tumor?
what else could it be?
you were so hard on me about lying.
how about you take some of your own advice and tell me the truth?
what's next on the list?
prion disease.
and if that's what I got, how bad?
there are a few treatments, but there's no guarantee.
I'm sorry.
and you won't let me have a piece of cake?
uh, where's Cuddy?
it's not cns lymphoma.
I know.
she's getting worse. You want me to find Cuddy and get her approval for the brain biopsy?
when you were philandering with impunity, how did that feel?
superficially, I loved it.
but deep down, I think I was miserable.
Why? What's going on?
you weren't miserable.
you gave something away to make a relationship work.
you rationalize that you're getting something back.
okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.
leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate seven different things.
Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.
bad idea to get into a power play with somebody who has the power.
you're fired.
just reinforcing your point.
whatever personal drama you're playing out, you'd be a lot smarter to.
thought you said she was sick.
sick people don't spontaneously get better.
Yes, they do. It's called an immune system.
sick people who are sick enough to make it to me don't spontaneously get better.
not as pithy, but yeah, technically more accurate.
what's the last thing you gave her?
I took her for an mri looking for.
MRI's detect. They don't treat.
what did you give her after the MRI?
I didn't give her anything.
she got depressed at the lack of direction.
we went to the cafeteria for some chocolate cake.
took her to her room, hung a bana bag, let her rest.
you gave her cake.
she asked for it. I figured.
you figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me.
feeling crappy again?
I brought your cure.
I'd give you an iv of this stuff, but the frosting tends to get stuck in the little tubes.
is this a joke? - It's not a joke. Not a lie.
not an attempt to defraud in any way.
it's an actual licensed physician with an actual diagnosis.
hereditary coproporphyria.
your face is genetically blessed.
your body chemistry is slightly less so.
doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme that I can't pronounce,
but it's apparently important for your liver and everything else.
treatment is a high carb diet rich in sugar.
when you were a porker, you were self-medicating.
so this is treatable.
we just have to reverse your gastric bypass and get you back on a high carb,
Glucose-enriched diet.
the best you you could be is a lot more you.
open the hangar. Here comes the plane.
there's nothing else you can try?
no. There's a drug that manages the symptoms, but it's not a cure.
let's try that.
you don't want to have the surgery?
understand.
there's not many people who have the guts to admit they'd rather be pretty than healthy.
the income's better and you get more action.
I'll start you on your drug treatment right away.
I bought it.
I bought that it was really about trying to make people's lives a little better.
you're surprised she's superficial? You're a plastic surgeon. This is the human condition.
no, she's a freak.
every time you put someone under to bob their nose, you were risking their life.
what? - No singing. She's better.
no one was supposed to let my patient leave her bed.
she had a respiratory arrest.
we coded her nearly 20 minutes, but she didn't make it.
house is an unemotional child incapable of intimacy or romance.
trust me, it's done. This is perfect.
I like the desk. Lot of character.
that's not the one i ordered.
this is my desk from med school.
you have it in storage or something?
my mom did.
that was sweet of her to do that.
she didn't.
my mom has no idea I'm redoing my office.
I lied to you the other night.
that woman in the waiting room, she didn't freak me out about my future.
she freaked me out about my past.
your mother.
must've been horrible watching her die.
I wanted her to die.
she just...
yelled so much.
and for no reason. Just screamed at me in front of my friends.
my father tried to explain to me that her brain was literally shrinking, that she didn't mean it.
that it was the disease, but I didn't care.
I hated her.
I never said good-bye.
and she died with me hating her.
did chase test for the biliary tumor?
said it was negative.
said she was stable when he left her.
should've found more time. We should've.
house is gonna kill us.
slowly.
and painfully.
you're not only idiots, you're frauds.
fraudulent idiots.
fraudulent idiotic killers, as it turns out.
house, this was really my. - Your fault? Yeah!
for pretending to be me when you're not even competent.
and your fault for not ratting him out while the patient was still alive.
what she had was easily treatable.
she could've been fine.
damn treatment's so simple.
might still be possible. - House...
house, she's clearly dead.
she was dead.
she wasn't dead. She wasn't even sick, you moron.
seriously, how good was she?
no formal training. At least not in acting.
did you see their faces?
I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.
so the CT.
that was from a patient three years ago.
it was hard to find.
but the hair and make-up, getting Chase and Cameron to play along, much easier.
we deserved it.
I'll take down the website.
take it down? Are you kidding?
it's way too lucrative to shut it down.
for Chase, for me, I earn 50% for letting you use my name.
chop chop. Go to work. First dollars go to expenses.
I booked our little thespian here for two full days.
that's three g's I owe her.
and you still got 3 hours left.
do I?
brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime his sister had another one, she paid it for the lime, she put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up, she put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up,she put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em both up put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor, woke him up and said doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take I said doctor...
I'm Sorry. --Jeff
damn it, Zach. This is the last time I'm turning around.
the next time you forget something, you're gonna be on your own.
I can't play without a stick.
then I guess you won't play.
I don't care. I suck anyway.
don't say that.
I'm the worst guy on the whole team.
no, you're not.
then who's worse?
don't worry about anyone else. Just do your best.
see? You can't name anyone.
Zach, stop it.
then name someone.
you can't, can you?
you really think I'm better than those guys?
Yes.
hurry up and get your stick.
Zach, get back in the car.
I need an ambulance at 860 Oakwood Avenue!
why is dad's car on?
get back in the car, Zach!
come on. Come on! Oh, come on.
don't do this to me, Jeff! Don't do this!
I'm sorry. I just...
I couldn't take the pain anymore.
either I need a new watch, or Mowgli is cutting into your beauty sleep.
I was up all night looking at finance reports, and Rachel is doing great.
thanks for asking.
proving that you're a better foster mom than a homeless drug addict.
departmental budgets are due this week.
I'm gonna need an extension.
got some time next decade. - Cameron already turned yours in.
that's nice of her.
two questions-- why did she?
and why are you telling me?
same answer-- now you owe her a favor.
I'm gonna need an extension. I got some time
house, I've got a D. Y.F. S. Home visit on Friday.
and I've got a w-h-o-r-e visit on.
mama's busy. You two are gonna have to go play outside for a while.
32-year-old male with chronic pain all over.
this is the favor?
I was expecting something involving whipped cream and tongue depressors.
he's seen seven different specialists over three years.
no diagnosis and no relief.
Oh, I am fascinated already.
it's like I'm treating myself.
he gets cured, and I get to learn a valuable lesson about the milk of human kindness.
if I thought you learned lessons, I never would've quit.
so you're wasting a favor because?
I think you can help this guy.
drug-seeking patients don't attempt suicide with medicine cabinets full of narcotics.
sounds like fibromyalgia.
sounds like you don't work for house.
a diagnosis that provides neither an explanation nor a cure is by definition not a diagnosis.
the American college of rheumatology would disagree.
there are specific diagnostic criteria which this guy doesn't meet.
putting pressure on his pain helps, doesn't make it worse.
he's got abdominal pain, severe headaches, muscle cramps that come and go.
and he tried to off himself.
he's obviously mentally ill.
pain's probably psychological.
it is not a sign of mental illness to want to be pain-free.
it is if your solution is sucking on a tailpipe.
sane people don't attempt suicide.
not ever?
so if you were being burnt at the stake and someone handed you a gun...
I'd shoot the guys with the torches.
not one doctor this guy has seen in the past three years has been able to find a single thing wrong with him.
what does that tell you?
it means they're idiots.
it means we got to start from the beginning.
we'll do a pain profile to rule out psychosomatic pain, search the home.
go home. Get a refill... and a doughnut.
I'll help with the home.
choose a statement in each group that best describes how you've been feeling lately, including today.
I'm not depressed.
I know what I did was stupid.
I usually sleep well. I have some trouble with sleep. I have a lot of trouble with sleep.
I have a lot of trouble.
it's up and down.
between the pain and the meds, his sleep pattern's pretty erratic.
he's a calm person. He's more nervous than most people. He's so nervous, he's miserable.
he's definitely calm.
sometimes calmer the worse the pain gets.
I think talking, interacting with other people actually makes it worse.
interesting. - Why? Does that mean something?
no, it's just we've seen that in anther... patients.
he can do chores around the house.
with help, he can do chores. He can no longer do chores.
he helps all the time. He's really strong.
he used to play hockey. And he was really good too.
I believe there's hope.
hoping for things to get better is a struggle for me.
most of the time, I feel completely hopeless.
he still laughs... all the time.
he was always optimistic. He still is.
it's just... it's harder now.
I guess...
I pray for strength more than hope.
there's nothing in there but a pharmacy's worth of pain medicins.
this guy makes House look like a Christian scientist.
he's also more compliant than House.
kept all the inserts, had daily pill dispensers to make sure he didn't mix them up.
I guesss if you're gonna go out in a car, this isn't a bad one to choose.
if I ever did it, definitely wouldn't be like that.
don't worry. I'm not making any plans.
I certainly wouldn't know.
ever since we kissed, you've been avoiding me.
no, I haven't. Just been busy.
metal polish could cause nerve damage if he inhaled enough of it.
judging by the shine on that car, he used a fair amount.
judging by the fact that he owns a body shop and one of these, I'd say he knew not to inhale.
busy tonight? We can get some dinner.
I don't think so.
so making out, okay. Meals, too intimate?
I don't want to kiss you again either.
Why? Because we work together?
no. Because I like you.
that makes a lot of sense.
what doesn't make sense is me getting involved with anyone.
I thought you'd gotten past this.
that's why you agreed to the drug trial.
you can't give upon life because-- - I'm not giving upon life.
I'm just giving upon you.
I finally feel like I have a grip on things. I can handle this.
what I can't handle is dragging anyone else down with me.
does this look like quail to you?
you think he's had food poisoning every day for the last three years?
wild quail can be toxic, cause rhabdomyolysis, which would explain his pain, as well as the elevated C. K.Levels.
so would the carbon monoxide he sucked out of his car.
it's not a toxic reaction. It's a psychosomatic reaction.
the pain profile showed an excessive concern about his physical health, difficulty sleeping, getting out of bed.
he's not in pain because he's depressed.
he's depressed because he's in pain.
not according to the pain profile you ordered.
it's not a diet issue.
we should start him on antidepressants for his sake, as well as his family's.
we're not diagnosing his family.
we're not diagnosing you either.
it's rhabdo.
push I. V.Fluids, check his urine, do a muscle biopsy.
what muscle? He says it hurts all over.
then he'll biopsy all over.
where are you going?
if Cuddy can come in late, I can leave early.
if you need anything while I'm gone, just ask Cameron to do it.
so if he just stops eating quail, the pain will go away?
if we're right, it's definitely treatable.
my arm! It's starting to
he needs more medicine.
B. P.Is down. We need to get him in trendelenburg position.
Jeff, can you hear me?
he's arresting.
we need a crash cart in here!
he's not answering his cell either.
V.Q.Scan showed a pulmonary embolism.
means the pain's not psychosomatic.
it also means it's not rhabdomyolysis.
up till now, his heart and lungs were the only places he didn't have pain.
means it's getting worse.
got to let the phone ring more than four times when you're calling a cripple.
chronic pain and pulmonary embolism, go.
how'd you know he had-- - you called after midnight.
it's got to be a heart problem.
but heart only would be consistent with rhabdomyolysis, which means thirteen and Foreman would be singing in the rain, which means it has to be lungs as well.
hypercoagulable state could cause pain and a P. E.
so you think the blood clot was caused by a clotting problem. That's helpful.
what if it's a cancer syndrome, like trousseau's explains blood clots, multifocal pain, lack of obvious physical signs?
and why he's gone three years without anyone seeing it?
check his chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors.
why did he think only you two would be singing in the rain?
bone windows are normal.
checking for cancerous masses in the lungs.
so, uh, who do you know who committed suicide?
Hemingway, Goebbels, Romeo and Juliet.
your mom? Dad?
saying I wouldn't do it under any circumstances means my whole family was suicidal?
no, but categorically insisting there are no circumstances means you've got baggage
personal betrayal, abandonment.
just because you grew up in a Charles Dickens novel...
well, it's people like me who don't do it.
when your life sucks from the beginning, there's nowhere to go but up.
thorax is clear. No tumors in the lungs.
the only betrayal comes from father of the year in there.
he has a wife, a kid-- people who count on him to have a pulse.
okay.
switching to high-res cuts of the abdomen.
my parents live very happily in Queens.
they never attempted, thought about, or attempted to think about commit...... what?
there, along his diaphragm.
that's not cancer.
no hurry. I already bathed once this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.
can't do anything till I write up an estimate.
fine. Pad it all you want. Here's a check for the deductible.
don't touch the piano and lock up when you leave.
sorry, deductible doesn't apply here.
I'm no architect, but I'm pretty sure the master bedroom is part of the home, - which means the home warranty-- - doesn't cover negligence.
this pipe goes through the ceiling, over that wall, and into your shower.
it didn't burst. It was pulled apart.
Yeah, cause I'm clearly a guy who likes to knock out a few naked pull-ups before I greet the day.
you hang laundry in there?
I'm about to hang a plumber in there.
look, there's no rust. There's no corrosion.
I don't know how it happened, but I know what happened, and it's not covered. So... whenever you're ready to spend the $2, 200, give somebody else a call.
I promise, I'm only holding your hand to check for choreiform movement.
I'm getting absolutely no intimacy from it.
I told you, it has nothing to do with you.
I know. That's the problem.
there's 80 reasons we shouldn't date, but you can't shut everyone out.
you're gonna need help, support.
look at our patient.
32 years old, not dead yet, and already he's traumatized his wife, his son and I'll bet they're cherishing every traumatic minute he has left, wouldn't trade him for the healthiest guy in the world.
true. And they're stuck suffering with him, hating every day.
only their pain has no prospect of relief.
this a bad time?
no. - Yeah.
no trace of cancer in the patient.
but we did find edema in his intestines, air in the intestinal blood vessels, and House won't answer his phone.
his intestine must be damaged.
the air's leaking into his body.
if there's a blockage in the superior mesenteric artery, it could be choking off blood flow to his intestine.
blockages all over his body would explain his pain, why the cramps come and go.
do an angioplasty on the superior mesenteric and find the other blockages before he has another cardiac arrest.
I'll help.
good thing we don't have a suicidal patient with a horrific, undiagnosed pain disorder.
we did till we diagnosed it.
we found intestinal edema and air in the blood vessels.
pain was vascular.
if it was vascular, we would've seen uneven pulses.
his blood pressure was uneven. Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angioplasty.
he had hemorrhages in his fingers.
there's air in the intestine. It has to have come from somewhere.
yes... it does.
after we thread the catheter through his groin and into position, the blood will start flowing freely again.
will that take away the pain?
it will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away.
cancel the angio.
he has air in his blood vessels. If we don't open the artery to his intestines
where can air come from?
air can either come from a breach in the lumen in the small intestine, or in rare instances, air can come from the air.
teeth marks.
I'm guessing from when he blew into his I. V. Tube.
air bubble caused the P. E. and cardiac arrest.
you tried to finish the job that you started at home.
Jeff... why?
you said that you never-- - I lied.
I want to die.
please just let me die.
no.
he's in a hyperbaric chamber.
a dose of high pressure ought to chase the air out of his blood.
is anyone keeping an eye on him, you know, because the whole idea of suicide watch was specifically created for suicidal patients.
I realize how you might've thought the name was just a coincidence.
are there any visuals in this room that are key to us learning our lesson?
cause the telephone
I'm inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.
when was the last time you showered? - Scent of a man...
I realize you haven't experienced it sober.
if anyone should be able to handle a depressed pain patient...
he insisted he was no longer-- - apparently he lied.
didn't think I'd have to remind you of that remote possibility.
I have a D. Y.F. S.Inspectionin less than 24 hours, - so if you can't control-- - non-motor seizures.
sorry, I was thinking about the patient. What were you saying?
go on. - The pain started in his abdomen near his intestine.
the first symptom has got to be key.
he's had multiple EEGs, all of them cleaner and squeakier than Cuddy's rubber nipples.
what about a glycogen storage disease like mcardle's?
it explains the pain.
Plus, there's plenty of muscle cells in the wall of the intestine.
fourteen is right.
go run an ischemic forearm test.
take the garbage out on your way out.
if you want a man to take your crap, you have to marry him first.
or employ him.
good girl.
I don't think I'm ready to run a decathlon yet.
Ah, if we can get you managing your life a bit better, that'll be plenty.
Dr. Hadley, whenever you're ready.
Janice. You look better.
Yeah, they said my basal ganglian volume has improved.
all I know is for the first time in two years, I can drink a cup of water without spilling it all over myself.
thank you for getting me back in the study.
I haven't even seen you in weeks.
I didn't even know our appointments were back-to-back again.
well, they weren't. Mine got switched this morning.
we're gonna take your blood repeatedly.
if the increased strain makes your arm hurt more, you have a muscle abnormality.
if you're right about this mcardle's disease, can you take away the pain?
with gene-replacement therapy, with lifestyle changes, we can reduce it.
keep squeezing the ball.
how long does he have to-- - maybe you and Zach should get something to eat.
honey, don't worry about us. - I'm not.
please get out of here. These tests are all I can handle.
they're trying to help you.
they can't.
then how about helping them, you know, by not being
an ass? You have no idea what I'm going through.
I know it's better than what you tried to go through.
sure, no baggage at all.
Where's the pain worst right now?
left arm. Does it hurt more?
couldn't.
and lactate level is steady. It's not any kind of glycogen.
Oh, god! Pain jumped to my leg!
that's never happened before chest, your abdomen--you feel anything there?
No! My leg!
it feels like it's being sawed off.
