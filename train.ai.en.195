marbury did request the same hotel he had stayed in last season, bass said, but when the team balked, he assented to stay in whichever hotel the team chose.
marbury didn't bring his new team much success-the brave dragons failed to make the playoffs, and he was abruptly cut before the start of the next season-but his experience in taiyuan did have at least one silver lining.
marbury didn't choose china any more than napoleon chose st. helena.
marbury has said he is hoping to bring some new talent to china himself.
marbury's deal with the foshan team 'which until this summer had been based in the central chinese province shaanxi' is for just one year, with no obligations beyond that, leaving him essentially a free agent after this season.

marchionne (played by al pacino): "do you think I'm fucking stupid?
marchionne demonstrated his steely nerve again in his dealings with the government to acquire chrysler.
marchionne faces an upcoming challenge with the opening of contract negotiations with the united auto workers.
marchionne had hoped to relaunch italian cars in the u.s. by bringing the appealing 500 to these shores, but the response has been less than robust.
marchionne has already separated out its pickup trucks from the new ram brand, and given sole rights to chrysler for the minivan now marketed as the dodge caravan.
marchionne has also declared his intention to merge the management of the two companies with his 25 top executives.
marchionne is the one, after all, who squeezed general motors 'rick wagoner out of$ 2 billion, acquired 20% of chrysler for nothing in 2009, and has kept fiat alive against all odds.
marchionne knew that without fiat, chrysler would go bankrupt, so he played hardball. "
marchionne said he will kill off the dodge van to avoid brand overlaps and customer confusion.
marchionne told reuters this week that european economic uncertainty has caused fiat to delay plans for capital investment and that he is waiting for "a better line of sight" before resuming its usual product launch cadence.
marchionne took over the troubled automaker in 2004 and quickly turned it into one of the auto industry's brightest success stories.
marchionne was said to believe that jeep's rate of fatal rear-impact crashes was no greater than the rate for other vehicles.
marchionne wastes no opportunity to challenge them, and he did so again at the opening of a new$ 1 billion plant in italy that fiat built with peugeot to assemble commercial vans.
marchionne's bluff worked, and he got his cash.
marchionne's vision for chrysler-fiat is coming into focus.
marchionne, speaking in turin on feb. 3, said he intended to merge fiat and chrysler into a single car company in 2014.
