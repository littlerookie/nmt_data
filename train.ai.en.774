in the end, it all came down to fate...
an LA Weekly advert strewn across the ground.
Claremont Williams III...
Yeah! The legendary bail bondsman.
[Speaking Spanish]
I'm here for the bounty hunter seminar.
cash?
keep the change.
Claremont: See, as a bail bondsman,
I'm the go. Between for the court and the accused.
for a 10% fee,
I will guarantee the amount set by the court.
now...
if the defendant should fail to appear at his or her court date,
I will bring in a bounty hunter to recapture the defendant, or I will face having to repay the court costs myself, which... we can't do.
now, this occurs most frequently when the collateral or the guarantee given to the bondsman turns out to be worthless or difficult to liquidate.
so... in layman's terms, we get 10% of the bail.
now, in the next few moments,
ed Moseby will take the podium, and he will begin the seminar on how to become a bounty hunter.
in the mean time, feel free to take a coffee break, pee break, whatever.
we'll be starting in the next few minutes.
Hey, how about it? Want to ride some bounty hunter cock?
fuck you, dickhead. Ooh. Bitch!
excuse the fuck out of us!
we got to ditch this thing.
gentle men...
it has been a pleasure.
all right, bathroom window, 5minutes.
I'll keep the engine running.
Domino: Nobody really knows where Ed came from.
this much is clear... the man's been places, seen things, lived life.
he did a term in Soledad and a term in Angola, where he lost a toe during a prison riot.
the man's a warrior.
Domino: To say that Choco is the product of a broken home is to presume a home existed in the first place.
no. Choco never had a home. Well, unless you count 10 or so juvenile correction facilities, where he spenthis childhood.
Mierda! Damn!
Goddamn!
what the fuck is this? Where the fuck are you going?
those people paid for a seminar!
where do you get off fucking up my windshield?
I want a job!
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.
everybody wants a goddamn job.
what makes you think you can do this one, huh?
I've been training since I was 12.
knives, guns, throwing stars.
you name it, I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
why would a delicate little thing like you want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?.
I want to have a little fun.
you want to have a little fun?
well, little girl, you want a job?
Yeah.
it's gonna cost you a new windshield.
you know what? Enough of that "little girl" shit. The name is Domino.
Domino.
. domino what? No, just Domino.
let's take a ride.
que?
the kid's name is Hector Maldonado, 19 years old.
his mother posted bail for him, after he was arrested for a drive by.
he speaks perfect fuckin' English. He just thinks it's cute when he's around a good Iooking woman.
Hey. Yeah, listen.
Louise, listen, you can make this easy, or you can make it real complicated.
Domino: For $200, Louise gave us her boyfriend's whereabouts at the local gangbanger hangout across the street.
what's his problem?
latin petulance. Hold on. Give me a minute with him.
all right, come on, princess, spitit out.
why do we need that bitch on the team? You don't like what l'm doing?
I can hear you. [Speaking Spanish]
Hey, baby, why don'tyou take a walk and letme handle this?
first, she ain't on the team yet.
OK?
second of all, take a look at her.
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.
you and I walk down the street, what do people see?
acouple of losers, right?
we add her to the equation, you know what people are gonna think?
what?
there goes two of the coolest motherfuckers who ever lived. Hmm?
you know what? I don't know about you, man, but...
I'm already a cool motherfucker, you know?
sometimes you got your own tongue up your ass.
little fuckin' pendejo.
Domino: I could feel the blood coursing through my veins.
merry Christmas. Did you ever use one of these?
ever heard of the Beverly Hills Gun Club?
Domino: Shotgun in hand, kicking down a door and wondering if there was heavy firepower on the other side.
Domino, you cover the side.
Choco, you cover the rear.
on my word.
Domino: Turns out my first raid was to be a near disaster.
that bitch Louise set us up.
Hector was hiding underneath her bed all along.
Hey, what's up, fool? . Hurry! There's 3 po. pos out front!
fuck. You serious?
ed [over radio]: On my go.
go.
Domino: That night, my coin was tossed.
heads, you live. Tails, you die.
50/50 chance.
life or death.
this ain't SunsetBoulevard.
my destiny was life.
life as a bounty hunter.
put that shit down, homey!
what the fuck you doin', bitch?! Step back, motherfucker!
what the fuck you want?
we're not cops. We're bounty hunters. All we want is Hector.
fuck you and the fuckin' po. Pos, bitch!
you tell me where he is, and I'll give you...
you'll what?
Domino: Sometimes a girl has to be naughty to get herself out of a jam.
I'll give you a lap dance.
man, fuck you, bitch!
I'll give you a lap dance, bra and panties on.
man, if I wanted all that, I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.
come on, you and me.
you know you want it.
Hey, what do you think, dawg?
I want to see what the fuck this bitch is workin' with.
I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on. Is that right?
well, take off your clothes, bitch.
sit down.
that's right, girl. That's right, girl.
Domino: It worked.
we got the scoop on how to find Hector.
2 weeks later, we nailed him.
Domino: Claremontwas Charlie to our three Angels.
it's very simple. The, um... DMV is the de facto conduit for all humanity, and every human being that we track down has a record in the DMVdatabase.
uh, whether itbe LAPD, Social Services, the CreditBureau, or the FBI, they all use the DMV's database as their hub.
so, we have people on the inside who feed us the information.
this one right there.
Ohh, shit. And who would know it?
the gatekeepers of humanity turn out to be a bunch of sassy black women.
excuse me?
he said he liked your suit.
tell him what you said. I like your suit.
Domino: After 6 months, Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.
we were so busy.
little did I know that the FBI liked to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.
ed, what did you do before you were a bounty hunter?
I played music. I was amusician.
Really?
what, in a band?
did you ever hear of Stevie Ray Vaughan?
wait, you're shitting me.
Stevie and I hooked up in Austin.
back in the day, we did the bus tour thing together.
played every goddamn small club that would have us.
Yep. Me and that boy, we tore it up.
holy shit.
played with Pat Benatar, but that was only when I needed cash.
Oh, fuck off. I love PatBenatar.
hey... So did I.
but that's another story.
love is a battlefield, baby.
what about Choco? How did you meet him?
I met Choco on the street...
a few hours after he got out of lockup.
he was standing there in a pair of those jailhouse slippers.
he didn't have a nickel in his pocket or a place to sleep.
we started talking, and I liked the kid.
like a little brother.
you know?
worst thing in the world is to be caged up.
that boy has been there, and he ain't never goin' back.
even if it costs him his life.
what you lookin' at, darlin'? Nothing...!
Domino: Put that fucking gun down!
put the fucking gun down!
Domino: Choco grew up on the streets of Venezuela.
when he was four years old, he stabbed another kid in the eyeball with a pencil.
there were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.
Domino: In 2003, I was named Bounty Hunter of the Year.
to the woman who has brought beauty and grace to this profession...
domino Harve. Ey!
Domino: From that day on, Eddie, Choco, and I were inseparable.
it turned out the three sassy black women and Raul were the gatekeepers of humanity... the DMV.
Lateesha was one of Claremont's many mistresses.
Claremont was godfather to us all.
just look at that luscious action right there. Look at that.
Oh, man, I'm gonna get you a pair of glasses.
Hey.
that's an ass.
[Radio]: Weather's gonna be a great day today. Lots of sunshine.
you know, a guy could get used to a life this ordinary.
maybe you should...
maybe you should fuck her mom, too.
what the fuckis your problem, bitch?
mother: So, who is this Choico?
Domino: Mum was terrified for me.
she didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.
is he your new boyfriend?
his name is Choco, and he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
whatever. He's a criminal. And that Ed Moseby character...
I mean, he's a complete loser.
[Click] He knew Frank Sinatra.
who didn't?
Domino: We may have been dysfunctional, but we worked.
we were family.
do you know this man?
Yeah, he's a reality television producer.
his name's MarkHeiss.
mr Heiss was very generous in turning over some videotapes to the FBI.
there's lots of footage of you.
we know everything. [Echoes]
Domino: Mark Heiss was friends with Mum.
I hate this!
they changed the fucking font!
Domino: He heard my story at some cocktail party.
she's stupid! You're not stupid.
all right. Get Cynthia on the line!
well, Domino's in the lobby. They changed the fucking font!
well, Domino's been waiting.
put her in the conference room.
turns out, he wanted to put us on television.
I should let you know that Mr Heiss will only be available to meet for about five minutes, so we should hurry up and cut to the point.
um, and speak in short sentences because he has the attention span of a ferret on crystal meth.
Domino: Mum was horrified and demanded to tag along just to keep me from signing anything.
I've seen that. Um... Excuse me?
a ferret on crystal meth.
you don't speak... you don't speak Spanish?
no. No?
this is LA, man. You should speak Spanish, you know?
OK, everybody has water. Um...
um... God, he should be here any second. Oh, here he is.
Sophie. Hello.
sorry, guys, about the wait. I'm having fontissues.
let me cut to the chase 'cause I have to take this call.
we want to follow you around with a camera crew for a week.
the last thing we did... the pilot episode... is not testing well.
we got too many rednecks.
it's too much like Cops.
we need... Go ahead.
we need...
something sexy!
something different.
we need Domino.
we need Domino.
listen, uh, friend...
we ain't gonna do this thing unless the whole team gets equal coverage.
you're not her father, Ed. No one cares what you think.
well, with all due respect, Mom,
I'm her boss, and she's on my team. OK?
and unless we all get equal coverage, we're all gonna walk the fuck out of here together, huh?
hmm? Equal coverage, or we all walk.
done! OK.
the whole team... We follow it.
what guarantee can you give us that Domino's name won't be tarnished?
Sophie, this is reality television.
what you see is what you get.
Oh. You will be exploited, your story won't be told truthfully, and your life will never be the same.
I beg you.
I beg you not to get involved with this drivel!
no offence, Mark, but we both know that this is drivel.
no offence taken.
anyway, if she's gonna be in anything, she should be in the centre.
sure, OK. [Phone rings]
but...
done! [Ring]
talk it over. I have to take this call.
Cynthia, you changed the fucking font on the promo! Why?
Domino: I felt like a hypocrite, given my hatred of all things Hollywood, but l'll admit...
I wanted my story told.
I wanted everyone to know the things I'd done.
I wanted some recognition in the world.
we'll do it.
we'll do it.
God help us. God help us all.
Domino: It was the beginning of the end.
crowd: Jerry! Jerry!
welcome back. We're here in LA with mixed race singlemothers.
our next guest takes pride in the fact that she's in the Guinness Book of World Records for being America's youngest grandmother.
and... she's only 28.
please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!
Domino: Lateesha was our prime contact at the DMV.
most of our bond certificates came from Claremont through her.
Hey, Jerry! Hey, Lateesha. How are you?
I'm fine. What's going on?
I'm here today to speak for all people of mixed race in America.
now, as a blactino woman, I believe we deserve our own race category to forge an identity, Jerry. That's how I feel.
did you just say "blactino"?
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino. American.
Wow. Uh, first of all...
first of all, you don't even look latino.
you look black. You're... You're black.
second of all, I'm of mixed race, and I've struggled my whole life as to whether I'm Chinese or whether I'm black.
chinegro! What you are is chinegro!
chinegro? Chinegro! There you go!
chinegro? You are a chinegro!
what the bleep is chinegro? .That's what you are! Chinegro is you!
that's some bulls...
OK, as I understand it, you brought a mixed. race flow chart with you.
why don't we bring that out? [Crowd shouting and booing]
how you doin', sugar? All right. I'm gonna call you later.
all right.
take a look at this...
Blactino, blackasian, hispasian, OK?
now, for the Asian subcategories, I got you, sister.
we have chinegro right here. That's you. Chinegro.
that's not a word! That's not a word!
Yes, it is, sister. We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?
Chispanic, koreaspanic, and last but not least, check this out, y'all... japanic. [Crowd cheering]
that's how I flow with it!
do you believe the government should recognise these racial subgroups?
Yes, Jerry, I do.
Hey, wait!
first of all, first of all, uh. Uh, honey, let me tell you, from one, uh, blactino woman to another...
right on. Our concern is education!
you ever hear of that?! Here you are, a 28-year-old grandmother!
Yes, I am.
you need to add another category to your flow chart.
it's called birth control, bitch! [Crowd shouting and booing]
OK, yeah. Check this out.
I am educated, you blactino bitch!
What?!
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes, my daughter might be a singlemother...
I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass! Bring it, bitch!
crowd: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
come on, Bri. We're late, we're late. Dude, it's fucking Mapquest.
I told you, never again with that piece of shit.
guys.
come meet Domino.
Domino, I want you to meet the co. Hosts of Bounty Squad.
Domino: Fucking... fucking... fucking...
fucking 90210. I couldn't get away from it.
it wasn't until later on that l realised
mum had gotten to Heiss and pulled some strings.
LAN Ziering.
Brian Austin Green. Domino.
cocoa... Choco.
cocoa? Choco.
Choco. Sorry.
the man from Afghanistan has made some significant changes to the RV.
Oh, my God.
are those real bones?
monkey... monkey bones?
shrunken heads?
from my family.
I drive these bounty hunters for a free Afghanistan.
Wow. I didn't know this was gonna be a political show.
Domino: Alf grew up during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.
he had always wanted to be part of the revolution but it seemed to pass him by.
at the tender age of 14, he decided that explosives would be his speciality.
Domino: His eyebrows never grew back.
OK, Ed, uh...
what background should someone have if they want to go into bounty hunting?
how does jail sound?
so, tell me, do you boys hunt?
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...
once.
well, let me tell you something. Once you hunt a human being, you'll never hunt an animal again.
you know, it's a different kind of rush.
the problem is, is that when you've done it for as long as I have, all you got to show for it is an empty bank account and, uh, IBS.
IBS? Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.
you got a spastic colon? That's hysterical.
you know, my grandmother has one of those.
does your grandmother hunt?
uh, well, I don't know. Maybe.
why don't you just shut the fuck up, huh?
you were supposed to talk about the healthcare crisis!
exactly. Why would you use Jerry Springer as a platform for some kind of progressive race modification proposal?
well, I don't thinkTed Koppel would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!
not a chance. Not a chance in hell. Hmm.
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums our people have, baby.
I thought having time on Springer would give me a chance of gettin' a blook deal or a correspondence gig on BET.
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.
Yeah, Montel would've been better.
Domino: Lateesha's granddaughter Mika had a rare blood disease.
her white cell countwas dropping fast.
dad?
we need money.
I got an idea.
what?
armoured car business.
we just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada.
there's a loophole.
Domino: Claremont Williams, bail bondsman, armoured car service, bounty hunter service.
an unusual combination.
kee Kee, me and Claremont are working on a plan to get money for Mika.
a real good plan, baby... a good plan.
are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's licence racket?
well, that's the word on the street.
you drove Lateesha's daughter to school, then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?
her car was in the shop.
how convenient. The morning you call in sick, I turn on the TV and see you all over Jerry Springer.
never heard of TiVo? . think l can afford it?
give me a break, Pat. What do you want?
I got a call yesterday from our health care provider.
they said you tried to pass your granddaughter off as Kee Kee down at City Terrace Community Hospital.
they said you forged the age on the application for some sort of operation.
motherfuckin' HMOs don't cover grandchildren.
Thatfuckin' operation is $300, 000. Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?
you should've thought about that before you became a grandmother.
fuck you.
you got 2 weeks to clear out your desk.
Domino: It just kept getting worse for Lateesha.
what? Did I stutter? 2 weeks.
Domino: No one could've expected what happened next.
Oh, by the way, there are a couple of FBI agents here that want to talk to you.
woman: You're gonna go to jail for a long, long time, Lateesha.
man: Unless you cooperate with us.
Domino: Their names were Cosgrove and Wilson.
someone had tipped them off to Lateesha's counterfeit scam, but that's not what they were really after.
I'm listening.
in about 10 minutes, a college kid named Frances is gonna walk up to your window and ask for 4counterfeit IDs.
you could help us out here.
Lateesha, we want to know what he's up to.
I mean, look at you. You got your hair did, your nails lookin' all good.
you go to jail, that's all gonna go away.
won't see your kids for a long time. Think about it.
it's gonna be long as hell.
Domino: This was when Lateesha decided to do something foolish, and Frances was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
OK.
OK. He and three of his friends are gonna hijack an armoured truck.
they're gonna walk away with 10 million in cash.
10million. Hmm.
PA: Now serving G086.
Hey.
all right, y'all, Lateesha done...
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole, and, uh, she can't get out by herself.
can y'all dig what l'm saying?
mija, we're in a hole together. We dig together. We're a team.
just like Billy Ocean says: "When the going gets tough，the tough get going."
Domino: There are 3 kinds of people in this world...
the rich, the poor, and everyone in between.
think you're having a tough day? You should see this.
I got an armoured truck that's empty. Yeah.
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.
Domino: That's Drake Bishop, owner of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.
he's worth a billion dollars, 10 million of it recently stolen.
his attorney, Burke Beckett.
I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz. We know who you are.
Where's my money?
I think it's probably best if we take a look at the tapes.
Cudlitz: Our tapes show that at 6: 23am, your truck pulls into the parking lot and turns the engine off.
rewind, please. Rewind the tape.
freeze the tape. Freeze the tape.
now, can you zoom in? Zoom in, please.
you a fucking mockingbird? Shut the fuck up!
I just...
Nancy Reagan. I think that's Hillary Clinton.
fat ankles. It's Barbarafucking Bush.
and Jacqueline Onassis just to her left.
christ almighty, it's the goddamned First Ladies.
if you don't mind me asking you, Mr Bishop, what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?
you don't have to answer that. Shut up, Burke. $10 million, cash.
don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.
how'd you get me in this position, Burke?
Mr. Bishop? You have an urgent telephone call, sir.
Yeah. Bishop.
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.
I own the Williams Brothers Armoured Car Service.
Yeah.
um, hold on a minute, please.
let me isolate it.
yesterday I received an e-mail from a source.
in this e-mail were four social security numbers made to counterfeit California driver's licences.
And?
I believe these are the gentlemen who robbed us, sir.
I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles, and I can track down and deliver these thieves to you for a small finder's fee.
how much? Just $300, 000.
and what happens if you don't deliver?
my theft insurance policy will have to fork over that $10 million.
that will take 6. 8 months.
but you should know, sir, that l employ bounty hunters, and my bounty hunters can and will track down these thieves.
well, you deliver these crooks to me and you've got yourself a deal...
300000
thank you, sir. That's a deal.
Domino: Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.
Bishop's attorney had puthis boss in business with the mob.
they're asking for a finder's fee.
finder's fee? That's bullshit.
sounds like an inside job to me.
could be. Who knows if this Claremont Williams is in on the heist or not.
all I know, if this joker delivers the First Ladies, we'll split the 300, 000fee with you.
all right, gentlemen. Sounds like we got a little situation here.
Domino: Quite a mess indeed.
Beckett had just brokered an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.
the 10million, en route from LA to Vegas, belonged to the mob.
Bishop's clean reputation was a great cover for laundered cash.
if the FBI could link the two men together, it would be the takedown of the century.
the FBI was always listening, hence the underwater cordless.
in Needles.
Domino: Locus Fender was brought in to drive the armoured car, another one of Claremont's network of stooges.
his mother Edna worked at the Nedles DMV.
mama! You're not gonna believe this. Mama, come quick!
where are the First Ladies? They disappeared.
what do you mean, they disappeared?
Domino: According to Locus, they stopped for gas.
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab a Mountain Dew. Don't make a peep.
especially you, Barbara.
Hey, man. Hey, how's it going?
I need to get, uh...
$8 of gas and, um...
a Mountain Dew. Do you have Moonpie?
Yeah, I got a couple of them over there.
and a slim...
shit! No, no, no!
Domino: He was sure they'd nabbed the cash. Straight. Up double. Cross.
but they'd left without it.
that doesn't make any sense.
well, they left all the money. It doesn't make sense...
Locus! Fuck'em. Their loss is our gain.
put the money in the freezer.
mama? Locus... Fuck'em.
OK, Mama.
Domino: Either this was some kind of set up, or the First Ladies got scared, decided to pull out and cut their losses.
are you wearing makeup?
what, can you tell? Huh?
you're wearing eyeliner, man. You look like a drag queen.
who the hell is that?
guys, it's time. We need the bounty hunters.
come on! 110%.
I looks like Night of the Living Dead.
are we on? Now?
Yeah, now.
is that a joint? No. He's not smoking.
put that down. You know, television... the people watching, those kids...
Yeah, yeah...
Domino: Claremontfed us a fake story about the First Ladies.
are we rolling?
so, today, Domino and her team are out to nab four criminals for forging checks with counterfeit driver's licences.
what can you tell us about these 4 creeps, Domino?
apparently, they call themselves the First Ladies.
the HEART OF ENGLAND 1940
am I in heaven?
11 YEARS LATER
obituary Jason Rafiel Philanthropist and man of letters
nemesis
miss Marple?
Yes. I'm Mr Broadribb.
you're not terrifying, after all.
should I be? Mr Rafiel called you Nemesis.
the bequest is modest
a gramophone? It's very thoughtful of Jason but...
Oh, no, Mr Rafiel left you ￡500.
but there ls a condition attached...
.which he wanted to tell you himself.
Jane, I wish you to Investigate a possible crime and right a dreadful wrong.
the pieces of the puzzle I have, myself, assembled but it wlll be for you to fit them together into a complete and, I suspect, most terrible picture.
then, my dear, I imagine you returning to your beautiful roses carefree again.
but first, you must once more become that goddess of retribution and righteous anger.
once more, be Nemesls.
let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everlasting stream.
and there was this. Two tickets to a mystery coach tour.
take a trusted companion "of your choosing to support you if danger threatens which it may."
the choice is yours.
I know the deadline looms.
that's what deadlines are for, to loom and scare but until the muse descends...
you're my agent, Marjorie, just tell the publishers the new Raymond West will be sensational.
hold, please, Marjorie.
Raymond West.
Oh, Sophla.
Avril? No, l haven't seen Avril for...
hold, please, Sophia.
Avril! I didn't mean it. You were perfect...
Marjorie, I'm writing a novel, not baking a cake. How do I know how long it's...
tuesday week? Oh, tell them what the hell you like.
Sophia.
Hello?
Oh, Avril. I knew you'd be back!
I knew you'd be back, my...
aunt Jane.
I tried to telephone but the line's always engaged.
how wonderfully lovely to see you.
my favourite aunt. Your only aunt, Raymond.
is something the matter? I've had a strange request.
fascinating.
what kind of man was Jason Rafiel?
he was German...
but left in 1933 when the Nazis burned his books.
he wrote about justice.
I admired him more than I can say.
and he'd have done anything for me.
what did he mean by " a possible crime " ?
something that happened that may or may not have been a crime?
or a crime that hasn't happened yet but possibly will.
daffodil Tours?
find where Truth lies and you will find the truth.
I could do with a holiday.
avril and Sophia can wait.
I like a girl in uniform. I'll take those for you.
just wait in the barn for a moment.
beauty and the beast.
sydney and Margaret Lumley.
morning. Good morning.
sir... Good morning. Morning.
either Michael Faber or Laurence Raeburn.
they're the only single travellers.
he looks like an off-duty undertaker.
could be handy if someone's murdered.
good morning.
morning. Good morning.
welcome to Daffodil Tours. Morning.
Amanda Dalrymple and friend.
I hope he knows what he's letting himself in for.
Why? Is she another of your...
certainly not. Perish the thought.

you've brought your dinky typewriter.
are your fingers tip-tip-tapping with a new novel?
they never never stop.

what a curiously charming hat!
Raymond's treating me to a little break and...
Oh, my solicitor and general...thing.
Derek Turnbull. Sit.

Raeburn?
even the lower orders need a holiday sometime.
Evidently.
just wait inside a moment. Thank you.
poor chap. Tank Regiment, from his tie.

don't fuss. It's fine. Sorry.
good morning, Sisters. Welcome.
thank you.
there's something about nuns, don't you think?
all that scratchy black.
Oh. Mother Superior Agnes Carson and Sister Clotilde Merryweather.
what a merry little band we are.
we're just waiting for our last passenger.
sorry for the delay.
don't mention it. Why, thank you.
I'm Georgina Barrow, your guide and driver.
we nearly left without you.
but you did not. Good.
Yes. Good. Thank you.
Guten Morgen. Michael Faber.
he's a bloody German.
I beg your pardon? Oh, nothing. I was just wondering.
this your first time over here? Second.
I was in the Luftwaffe.
I'm sure you're most welcome, Mr Faber.
thank you, Sister.
old sins cast long shadows.
do you get the impression everybody knows everybody?
what would I do without you?
ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Daffodil, welcome...to our little mystery tour.
and it's off we go!
let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everlasting stream.
I expect that's the map that he used to bomb us.
the war's over.
may I, Mr Raeburn? Oh, please.
I prefer a coach to a train, don't you?
Yes.
a straight line's all very well but twists and turns are so much more absorbing.
what brings you on the tour?
I was kindly sent a ticket by a gentleman who remembered me from a house party.
but I can't recall him.
as one gets older... Amos Flaire.
flair? How unusual. With an E.
I don't know why I can't remember him. Oh, do shut up!
daffodil Tours asked me along to get them a mention in Tatler.
what's Biarritz done to deserve your absence?
too many other expenses. Who asked you?
do you know Miss Dalrymple?
I was in service to her uncle as his butler.
isn't that odd?
isn't it?
sister? Sorry...
have you been to Dorking?
not to my knowledge.
are there many nuns in Dorking? No.
no. You must just have one of those faces.
ladies and gentlemen, our first stop is the historic Forrester Grange, ancestral home of the Forrester family.
is something the matter?
it's where I was in service to Lord Forrester.
this splendid basilica recalls the glory of ancient Rome in the heart of England.
notice the gilded gods looking down on us lesser mortals as we make our way through the riot of coloured marble and on into the ballroom
the ninth Lord Forrester was renowned for extravagant balls, attracting the creme de la creme of soclety.
the Prince of Wales is said to have danced the fandango here in 1814.
it's lovely here, isn't it?
moving on.
and there's Lord Forrester with his family in 1772.
attributed to Thomas Gainsborough but who really knows?
the wall hangings are of crimson silk by the Huguenot weavers of Spitalfields.
moving on.
136 feet in length.
the long gallery was designed to afford variety and amusement for those ladies retreating from the unseemly revelry of gentlemen still at dinner.
next, the print room.
the original wood panelling was replaced in 1767...
are you unwell?
unsettled.
memories? Yes.
why have we come here of all places?
it is a colncldence, isn't it? Another one.
first Miss Dalrymple and now Forrester Grange.
is Lord Forrester still in residence?
no, he's in a nursing home.
not long for this world, so I hear.
his children will have quite a responsibility.
lord Forrester is childless.
his niece, Miss Dalrymple, will inherit the estate.
not that she deserves to.
it could just be a coincidence that we're here.
Oh, shut up! Please, don't get hysterical.
don't take any more of those. They're Benzedrex, not Dolly Mixtures.
the Good Samaritan.
yes... Of all the parables, isn't loving thine enemy
Christ's most important teaching?
that reminds me. Do you have a Bible?
out, out, out, out!
out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!
this tour is over.
fine! Back to the charabanc.
this house is mine or it soon will be and it's no longer open to visitors!
go on! Off with you! Shoo!
sling your hooks!
vamoose!
who the hell put that there?
why are you all persecuting me?
teeny accident.
I'll fetch staff.
who is it?
I'm not sure.
aren't coach parties meant to be sedate affairs?
this is more like Tosca, I'm glad to say.
chapter five, verse 24.
'let justice roll down like waters. "
the Book of Amos.
Raeburn says he was given his ticket by an Amos Flaire...which is an anagram of Rafiel.
Jason always liked to tease me.
and he always got people to do what he wanted.
where does Faber fit in? Who? Oh, Michael Faber.
Yes, I wonder...
driving on into the heart of England, we'll be seeing bosky groves and luscious pasture before arriving at Medhurst, a typically charming village, nestling below the picturesque Bonaventure Rocks.
er, we'll be staying in the Flying Horse, well known for its excellent cuisine.
I'm sure they'll do you a sandwich in your room while you work on your novel.
very nice.
excuse me...
you're Raymond West. I know.
Colin Hards. Hello.
how's the new one coming along?
pretty well. Pretty well.
well, I do hope yours isn't a silent order, otherwise conversation will be terribly one-sided.
I know a joke about two nuns.
would you pass the pepper?
and what tempted you from shady cloisters on this little jaunt, hm?
an anonymous benefactor sent us the tickets.
some grateful soul we must have helped along life's thorny path.
I've read all your books. How kind...Colin.
I reckon I've got a book in me.
you must let it out, then.
she's always going in for things like this, you know.
if it's not crosswords, it's Spot the Ball, and if it's not Spot the Ball, it's Comic Captions...
it's the first time I've won anything, these tickets.
I can't really even remember entering.
well, Rowena, she deserved a holiday. It's the first we've...
the first we've managed since the war, with all the operations.
Yeah. I was all but blind when Army Welfare...
when Army Welfare brought him home and then the woman said it would be a long battle, but he's good as new.
except I can't dance, for some reason. No.
he's lost all his sense of rhythm, and we used to love to foxtrot.
I don't suppose if I...showed you my jottings...
busy, busy, busy, I'm afraid. Ah, success, Les!
bubbly?
Thanks, but I much prefer to keep a clear head.
I much prefer you out of your uniform.
Thanks, Les.
champagne! Oh, thank God!
saving your presence, girls.
isn't she lovely, eh? Oh, yes. Lucky chap.
do you drink?
no, thank you.
a thimbleful will do no harm.
thank you, darling. I'm desperate.
Where's Mr Faber? He wasn't hungry.
long life! Long life!
Cheers! Cheers.
that's nice, isn't it? Yes, it's nice.
Chin-chin.
it wouldn't seem fair if you missed out.
my nephew can be so extravagant and even though he can afford it...
thank you... No.
in case you change your mind.
it's never too late.
I learned that from a man called Jason Rafiel.
what sort of a man was that? Was?
is.
my English.
your English is excellent.
he was a dear old friend with a son called Michael who stayed in Germany when Jason was forced to leave.
the boy came back for holidays, of course.
the war put a stop to that.
what did your friend say about this son?
that he wanted to be a pilot when he grew up, and that he had frighteningly intelligent eyes.
I am Michael Rafiel.
I'm so sorry.
my ticket was with his final letter.
he said perhaps it could make things correct.
things?
but too late.
you should choose better friends, I think.
excuse me.
junior RIFIEL
ray, I'm bored. Tell me a bedtime story.
I'm trying to work.
don't be so mean. Very well.
once upon a time... Oh, good.
once upon a time, Amanda, there was a sophisticated woman who lacked one thing, the ability to take no for an answer.
you used to say yes.
that was then. You never understood my artistic temperament.
old times' sake?
Oh, sorry. Don't go.
miss Dalrymple was just looking for something that she lost.
quite. But...it's no longer here.
Oh, I meant to ask you about your lovely dress.
a long-cherished favourite, clearly. Amanda.
what, darling?
mr Raeburn?
what's happened?
I think he fainted and fell down the stairs.
OK.
Verity?
I'm not Verity. I'm Margaret.
you, bed.
we should get a doctor.
no, no. I've got some heart mixture in my room.
we don't want the tour disrupted, Raeburn.
Jason's note.
'find where Truth lies. "
truth with a capital T.
so?
Raymond, you're a writer. Yes.
well, what's another word for truth?
Verity.
Margaret Lumley thought Raeburn was calling her Verity.
perhaps she's the girl in the photo that had such a dramatic effect on Amanda.
why are you all persecuting me?
and perhaps Verlty was the reason for Michael's argument with Mr Raeburn.
who is Verity? What is she?
if only we knew what this crime was...
...or will be.
Verity...
Martin. Come back to bed.
it's all right. You're safe.
come on. That's it.
come on.
that's it.
mr Raeburn?
you'll miss breakfast.
mr Raeburn?
Colin?
Oh, it's Detective Constable, actually.
this is my aunt.
of course. You're the writer, aren't you?
Oh, well, perhaps one day.
will there be a postmortem on Mr Raeburn?
no need... He had a heart condition.
but er...shouldn't you test his medicine for poison?
poison? Who'd want to poison him?
besides, erm...Mr Lumley and Mr erm...
Mr...the German said the door was locked when they helped him back, and he had the key, so...
well, the medicine couldn't have been got at.
Raymond, are you really too busy to help an aspiring author?
I'll take your advice, Aunt Jane, as usual.
are your jottings typed up?
Oh, yeah, yeah. They can be.
do test the medicine, just in case.
we'll see.
it's ghastly. It disrupts the itinerary.
Margaret!
why did Raeburn call you that? He didn't. I dunno.
come on, sit down. Sit down.
sorry for the delay. I have to deal with the formalities.
we're just waiting for the police. The police?
it's routine with a sudden death.
wasn't it strange, Mr Raeburn coming out with that name?
Verity.
quite unusual.
I wonder who she could be...if anyone.
I don't suppose any of us knows a Verity. I...
I certainly don't.
we did.
she was a novice at St Elspeth's, our old convent before the order moved to London after war.
we took her in one winter's day, 1939...
what brought her to you? She was running from a man.
and the next summer he found her.
but I sent him away in no uncertain manner.
she owed me money. I let her have a room in my house in Kilburn and she did a flit.
I just...tracked her down.
she had a different story.
an over-attentive landlord.
no. No. A few days later, she disappeared.
got nothing to do with me.
did she tell you where she'd come from?
no. No, she didn't. No.
she did say that she'd followed her mother into service.
a servant family?
it's just a thought but the girl in the photograph that got broken...
mr Raeburn seemed to know her.
Verity was a housemaid's daughter at Forrester Grange.
Raeburn was very fond of her and she of him.
and her father?
she was told he was Arthur Hunt, an under-gardener who died when she was a baby, but, in fact, she was born the wrong side of the blanket.
a love child?
I doubt love came into it, knowing her mother.
she never did say who the real father was.
Verity followed her mother into service, but she was caught stealing and ran away.
that child would never steal.
I loathe dishonesty, and seeing her in a fruit bowl was just too much.
weren't you arguing with Mr Raeburn at Forrester Grange?
we disagreed about the war.
and so?
do you know where Verity is now?
she's dead.
sometimes I... I get vibrations.
quite a bother, but he is usually right.
Oh, love. Are you all right?
he's seen too much death. Go to him.
do you want to go upstairs?
blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
it's you, madam.
you stayed here before. In wartime, summer 1940.
don't be so stupid. What makes you think it was me?
I remember your manner.
you remember wrong. Now go away.
we're all in considerable distress.
she was very kind, wasn't she? Sister Clotilde.
Yeah. She's very calming.
come on, then. Blow the cobwebs away.
OK. I'll see you downstairs.
Yeah.
Verity
you're at liberty to explore as you wish, from now on, and we'll meet back at the Flying Horse this evening.
it's a steep climb up to the rocks...
mr Faber, keep up.
you said it is allowed to walk alone.
I don't blame him. Something's going on.
let's keep our spirits up. All these coincidences...
everyone's connected to everyone else...
not us. I think Mrs Lumley might be right.
there's a very pleasant riverside walk for those of you who prefer.
what could have upset Mr Faber?
his name is not Faber.
I have to tell someone. His name is Michael Rafiel.
and I think he killed Verity.
during the war we took in wounded servicemen at St Elspeth's those that hospital could do nothing more for and, for one reason or another, they couldn't go home.
we had our nursing skills and some medical support and did our best for them.
though, in truth, it wasn't always enough.
and then in 1940, the Battle of Britain,
Michael's aircraft was shot down and Verity found him alive.
we gave him sanctuary. A German airman?
well, love thine enemy.
another German pilot was nearly killed by local villagers when they found him.
Verity nursed him in secret, away from our official patients.
they fell in love? Yes.
I remember the day she left.
she was keeping vigil with Ralph Collins, an RAF pilot who was nearing his end.
and then she told me that she and Michael were running away together and she was to meet him here in Medhurst on Bonaventure Rocks.
and I reminded her that she had offered herself to God.
I told her to come to the chapel and pray to St Elspeth for strength to tell Michael that she must never see him again.
and pray she did...
...and St Elspeth gave her the strength.
I must confess I was very surprised.
young love can be so strong.
but Mother Superior was right, as she always is, and Verity chose God over her passion for Michael.
I wished her good luck and off she went to tell him.
but she never came back.
and a week or so later, when we were burying poor Ralph Collins, news reached us that Michael had been captured and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp.
we never heard from Verity again.
did you report her missing? Yes.
but to my everlasting shame,
I only told police that she'd gone into Medhurst on an errand.
I couldn't mention Michael because I would have faced prison myself for harbouring the enemy
and it was my fault he killed her.
we can't say that.
thwarted desire can unleash evil even in the best of souls.
I've had enough of it, Sydney. I'm frightened.
we're not stopping now.
please...
I can't manage without you, darling.
we're in this together.
slow down!
I know who you are.
a few years older and dressing sharper...
...but it's you.
is it?
I've got a proposition.
come to my room later, without your husband.
you can see right to the coast, apparently, from the top.
yeah?
you know...
I think I'll wait for you here.
is it playing up? No, it's fine.
I'll wait with you. No, no, you go on, it's fine.
all right. Yeah. I'll see you later.
Bye, love. Yeah.
what do you want?
Georgina?
I've had the report on Mr Raeburn's heart medicine.
not a trace of poison but I did order a postmortem and you were right.
he was poisoned.
when?
at the latest, soon after he went to bed. At the earliest, seven o'clock.
exactly, Mr West.
could someone have slipped it into his champagne?
certainly.
Hi. Sorry, has anyone seen Rowena?
our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
we don't know she was pushed.
perhaps she just lost her footing.
er, no, no, I can't see it.
Oh, Mr Hards is right, Raymond.
of course Rowena Waddy was murdered.
what have you got there?
just a piece of straw.
what about this figure you saw?
I only glimpsed him. Dark jacket, hat...
see, you say " him " .
could it have been a woman? I suppose so.
is there something over there? No.
no, there isn't.
why not treat this as an accident for now?
one of our group is a killer and until we know why they murdered Mr Raeburn and possibly Verity Hunt...
don't put their guard up?
exactly.
now...
do you know of a man called Jason Rafiel?
I thought she must have gone down another way.
I came back, but she wasn't there. I took a nap...
I didn't sleep well last night and when I woke...still no sign of her.
is your sleep often disturbed? Yeah.
the name Verity almost drives me mad.
is that the real reason that you're here?
I advertised in the personal columns.
"haunted by Verity, desperate for the truth." Please contact.
I received two tickets by post.
her name on a card.
had you, perhaps, met Verity somewhere?
forrester Grange, or where the nuns were, St Elspeth's?
or er...Kilburn, where she lodged with Mr Lumley?
if I had, I doubt I'd remember. Why not?
somewhere in here is shrapnel from Dunkirk.
my memory conked out. It took six months in Dover Hospital for me to recover it...and be identified.
it was Christmas before I was reunlted wlth Rowena.
did you tell her about Verity?
it upset me too much.
Yes, Sydney told me about Verity Hunt and, yes, I suppose there is a resemblance.
especially when we first saw you on the coach.
what do you mean?
you were less...sophisticated.
no jewellery, hardly any make-up.
like you were when Mr Raeburn called you Verity.
sydney prefers me like that sometimes.
it reminds him of her. So what?
had you met anyone else in the group before?
no, thank you.
so, that afternoon...
I was upset with Sydney.
I went up to those rocks on my own all the time.
exactly where?
one rock's the same as another.
right?
one rock's the same as another.
I was looking for Margaret. She was in a bad mood.
what's this got to do with Mrs Waddy's accident?
perhaps you'd prefer to tell me about Verity.
I've got nothing to hide.
autumn '39, when my mother passed away,
I advertised for a lodger.
Yeah. Just for the company.
I let her have room, even though she couldn't qulte afford it
sometimes we used to go to the flicks.
I'd get her chocolates.
Sundays we used to listen to the wireless.
I asked her to marry me. She ran away.
I had this picture postcard from Medhurst saying a very nice sorry, so I traced her to St Elspeth's in the hope that...
well, I could talk her into changing her mind but...they wouldn't let me in.
I wouldn't harm her in a million years.
if you want to know who scared her, it's the Honourable Amanda bloody Dalrymple.
of course I scared her...
you're not obliged to answer.
and you're not obliged to interrupt.
Abusus non tollit usum, Detective Constable.
and hic haec hoc dickory dock.
you're not in court now.
it was me who had her dismissed for stealing.
Verity doesn't sound like a thief, from what I've heard.
you're no judge of character. Look at you and Avril.
I'm an excellent judge of character.
should we leave you alone?
I was thinking...
when you broke that photograph, it did seem rather more than mere disapproval of a thief.
Yes. Why would you hate her so much?
I don't know. I...
of course, you do inherit Forrester Grange...
as the next of kin to Lord Forrester.
what's that to do with anything?
you said that Verity grew up believing her father had died but suppose he was Lord Forrester.
Yes. When her mother died and Verity turned 21 ,
uncle changed his will in favour of her because she was his only child.
naturally I was furious at the prospect of losing my inheritance, and I told her the truth.
that she was nothing more than the illegitimate result of a sordid romp between her tart of a mother and my goat of an uncle.
she was remarkably upset, and that's why she ran away, and that's the last I saw of her.
but you are Lord Forrester's heiress now, so...Verity must be dead.
Absens haeres non erit.
which means if you're not around, you don't get the swag.
four years ago, I had her declared dead as she'd been missing for seven without trace.
do you by any chance remember
Verity wearing a locket around her neck, as she was in the photograph?
I'm not in the habit of noticing cheap jewellery.
now, that afternoon on the Rocks, he got lost chasing butterflies, he says, and I came straight back down and returned here.
did anyone see you? They certainly would have heard .
one of the nuns. I don't know which.
I called out as I passed.
but we didn't speak.
I did hear Miss Dalrymple call but I was deep in meditation.
I'd gone in search of Michael, to urge him to kneel like the blackhearted sinner that he is and confess his guilt before the Almighty.
fortunately for him, he disappeared.
I challenged Mr West to a stiff climb...and won.
her legs are longer. When I reached top you'd disappeared.
I went exploring.
does it strike you as odd that two out of your ten passengers are dead and it's only the second day of the tour?
no, it's 12 passengers.
no, Mr West and Miss Marple don't count.
Oh? Why?
at Forrester Grange, Raeburn accused me of killing her.
he guessed who I was because Verity told him about me.
he was crazy and so is that Agnes, and so is anyone who thinks that I could...
we were so in love. Were you?
from that first moment, I believe.
and it became more, and grew, until we both knew it.
but I could not stay.
I decided to try for Ireland...
I asked her to come with me.
she said yes and we arranged to meet at Bonaventure Rocks.
she never arrived.
someone must have seen me and been suspicious.
but I swear, she never arrived.
I was, the rest of the war, a prisoner.
I asked my father, that champion of justice, your friend, to help - not me but to find Verity.
I am sorry, Michael, but you ask too much.
I am lucky not to be interned as an enemy allen, so how can I possibly help?
I am afraId you must forget this girl.
I never would forgive him.
never.
I cannot count the number of letters he wrote me after the war, begging me.
I burnt them all.
yesterday afternoon...standing on those rocks again...
...I felt Verity was there.
One...razor...
silver...
one gentleman's comb...
black.
are you making any sense of all of this?
I'm starting to.
one letter.
Verity to Raeburn. One letter.
may I? Oh, yes, of course. Of course.
one hair...oh, two.
two hairbrush-es.
Ah, there you are.
Yes, Derek.
are you ready for me?
Yes, Derek.
royal Navy, me.
swallowed half the Atlantic when I was torpedoed in '42.
next thing I'm at the Ministry of Food writing pamphlets about powdered eggs.
powdered eggs! Powdered eggs!
any ice?
somebody had to do it. Ah. Evening.
had a nose bleed. Nose bleed.
ice, please.
why didn't you tell me up on the Rocks?
you might have pushed him off and killed him.
I didn't know you had it in you.
nobody tries it on with my wife and gets away with it.
Thanks, Syd.
I'll wear locket you gave me until my dying day, I promise.
I can't tell you where I am, but I'm in love wlth a German airman called Michael.
Raymond!
we toasted love but...no idea what it is, me.
you're drunk. Well deducted.
deduced.
spot on.
why can I write about love, but I can't do it, hm?
you haven't written anything recently, as far as I can tell.
that's so cruel, Aunt Jane.
it's not all the time tip-tapping-tap...
there's thinking.
then leave yourself some room for thinking, instead of cramming your life with Avril and Sophia and Giovanni.
let me out!
let me out!
looking for this?
what on earth's happening?
some of us need our ten hours!
is it a party?
ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
my name is Jason Rafiel.
if you are hearing this, It has become necessary, through my earthly representative, to encourage you to continue this mystery tour.
your next destination will, I hope, reveal the true fate of poor Verity and justice shall prevail.
as ye sow, so shall ye reap.
why did you ask Miss Dairymple about Verity's locket?
was there something special about it?
it was very special indeed to Verity.
where are we going now?
sit down! We don't want an accident.
why are we going here? St Elspeth's.
what are we doing here? I don't like it.
something's just scurrid over my foot.
wipe my shoe. Wipe my shoe. I expect it was a mouse.
more like a rat.
don't you know what's going on? You are a policeman.
it doesn't necessarily follow, I 'm afraid.
she doesn't look too happy, does she?
martyrdom is no laughing matter, Mr Lumley.
St Elspeth's heart was pierced by the spear of Lord Ethelbert, when she refused to forsake her faith to become his mistress
some of her bones lie here still in the chapel below.
I fell in love here.
with Verity?
how do you know this?
there you are.
my head's exploding.
I had terrible dreams last night.
I saw her face...
and then it vanished.
there was another woman calling me.
she was calling me.
Rowena's death was a dreadful thing.
what's dreadful is...
I can't feel what I think I should be feeling.
it's a terrible thing to say...
I wonder if I ever truly loved her at all.
I don't believe you! What's wrong with it? It got us here.
well, it's not getting us back.
so where's the nearest taxi rank, Miss Daffodil 1951 ?
you sabotaged it!
we're staying the night and that's all there is to it.
it's not! It's not. I'm not staying here!
please, Mrs Lumley.
nor me! Put my case back.
the man I saw on Bonaventure Rocks when Mrs Waddy was killed, he wore these.
the book has your name on it, Mr Faber.
why would I kill Mrs Waddy?
I have never seen those clothes before.
you can give your statement at the police station.
when?
tomorrow.
that was my first arrest since leaving Uniform for CID.
Oh. Good. Yes.
what do you make of that?
fresh flowers? Well, those too.
the inscription, " Known Unto God. "
that's for an unknown soldier, surely?
then there's his name.
no, that was added later.
we only identified him some time after the burial, when his widow came looking for him.
she'd scoured the hospitals and we were her last hope.
she was too late...
but we'd kept his signet ring and she recognised that.
poor woman.
she must still visit him.
flying OFFICER RALPH COLLINS
my mattress is simply crawling with things.
then you'll just have to frighten them away, Miss Dalrymple.
well, I didn't say a word. You'd better not have.
mother Superior was telling me about Ralph Collins.
Oh, the headstone?
it was all terribly sad.
he was more or less in a coma from the day he arrived...
no papers, no memory, and the most appalling injuries...
mother Superior took it very hard when we lost him.
I laid him out all by myself, to spare her...
and broke the news in the morning.
we were all terribly on edge.
it was almost a week since Verity had disappeared.
he's escaped! Michael's gone!
he's got to be here somewhere.
you two, go that way. I'm going down.
it's me. It's me!
perhaps he's made a run for it.
let's just try inside the chapel.
is that him?
No! Please! No!
you killed her. You killed Verity. Confess it!
how could I? She's still alive.
after I'd had Verity declared dead by the courts, she wrote, threatening to return from the grave unless I paid her 50 pounds a month.
but anyone could have read about your legal action and written a letter.
I'm not that gullible.
I sent Derek to meet her, with a photograph and a list of questions about her past.
and it was her? Yes.
I only ask because when Mrs Lumley first saw you at the coach, she put on dark glasses...
as if you were afraid Mr Turnbull might recognise you.
such a fear could account for transformation that evening from the plain and simple look that you said reminded Mr Lumley of Verity.
and reminded Raeburn too.
that's why he called you by her name!
it is possible, isn't it?
how could you be so utterly stupid?
it looked like her from the photo.
didn't it? In your simple little frock and a dark wig under the light of a backstreet lamp because you were too nervous to meet in daylight?
of course you answered the questions about Verity's background because your husband coached you.
he's not that stupid. He rumbled us on the rocks, didn't he?
are you admitting to blackmail? Ask him about blackmail.
he said if I came to his room and did things, he'd keep quiet about us.
how's your nose?
all that money!
wait. Why were you in Medhurst when Verity disappeared?
were you looking for her? Yes.
how did you know where she was?
she'd written to a skivvy chum at Forrester Grange that she was here at the convent.
I wanted to offer her an allowance if she kept quiet about her real father...
but...I never got the chance.
then, my Verity, is she alive or is she dead?
I expect things will make sense in the morning.
they usually do.
mother Superior wondered if you'd like this.
cocoa?
how thoughtful of her.
wasn't it?
still, she can be...
was Verity right to decide to give up Michael for God?
we all have to love in our own ways.
sleep tight.
whose soul are you praying for?
is it mine?
who are you?
I am Nemesis...
and justice will roll down like waters...
and righteousness, the everlasting stream.
the poison in my cocoa is the same poison that killed Mr Raeburn, isn't it?
mother Agnes asked me to give you that cocoa.
I asked her to but she didn't poison it.
it was a temptation, Clotilde, and you succumbed.
when Mr Raeburn said " Verity " at the Flying Horse...
Verity?
it wasn't Margaret Lumley he was looklng at, it was you.
you were wearing a locket that I saw at Forrester Grange in the photograph placed there by Georglna.
a locket given Verity by her adored Mr Raeburn that she'd promised him she would wear until her dying day.
when you saw him recognise it...he had to die.
I don't think the poison was in the champagne.
cocoa?
you were wearing something...
sleep tight.
was it like that?
poor Mr Raeburn.
and poor Verity.
your own special one.
you killed her.
there is no proof.
isn't there?
you killed me.
I loved you.
but you were leaving me.
she said St Elspeth had given her the strength...
but not to reject to Michael...
to go with him.
I wished her good luck.
Verity.
Verity.
what did you do with her?
where is she? Dead and buried.
what did you do with her?
I put her in Michael's room.
and telephoned the police anonymously?
and told them a German was on the run at Bonaventure Rocks?
Yes.
and then I prayed to St Elspeth every day for a week...
and informed Mother Superior that the unidentified patient, nearly blind, in a coma, had died.
but in fact you wheeled him to Michael's room where Verity lay, and then...
the police were coming to search.
I had to wrap her in bandages.
I swaddled her in a shroud.
and then buried her as Ralph Collins.
but I wore her locket always.
and now I understand.
I wasn't in hospital all those months, was I?
you were here. In Michael's room.
I'm not Captain Martin Waddy of the Tank Regiment.
I'm Flying Officer Ralph Collins.
I expected you to die...
but St Elspeth told me to atone and nurse you back to life.
you were my secret...but I didn't know what to do with you.
and then she granted me a miracle.
I read of a woman, clearly disturbed, who wouldn't accept that her husband was missing at Dunklrk, presumed dead.
I sat by your bed as you recovered the memory
I wanted for you.
and be with your wife Rowena.
Rowena.
I returned Captain Martin Waddy to his wife.
she thought it was a miracle.
she wanted to believe.
Martin?
army Welfare, Mrs Waddy. He's home.
it's a miracle.
but when she recognised you, you had to kill her.
poor Rowena.
it was you Raymond saw on Bonaventure Rocks, after you'd pushed Rowena Waddy to her death.
how do you know?
l found a clue...
and the scarecrow I'd noticed on the day of Mrs Waddy's murder had been moved...
because you had used it in your deception.
while you were killing Mrs Waddy, dressed in the clothes you later placed in Michael's case...
miss Dairymple saw you deep in meditation.
of course, you couldn't answer her.
so it seemed you were nowhere near the Rocks when Mrs Waddy died.
I can never forgive myself.
it's God who forgives.
please...
a moment's prayer.
there's a new world out there.
that's very definitely the last ever time ever I pretend to be Verity.
Yes, darling. Thank you.
how many grindingly hard years for blackmail?
we're not pressing charges, Amanda. Think of the papers.
quite. Ghastly.
warm my seat.
ray! Bunny's fancy-dress thing Saturday. I'm going as a nun.
sorry, but I'll be tip-tip-tapping on the new novel.
your jottings. And?
you've really got something. Oh, good. Good.
I'm thinking of giving up the police.
Oh, but you have the makings of an excellent detective.
all aboard!
after the conquest and plundering of the Inca empire by Spain...
...the Indians invented the legend of El Dorado...
...a land of gold, located in the swamps of the Amazon headwaters.
a large expedition of Spanish adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...
...set off from the Peruvian highlands in late 1560.
the only document to survive from this lost expedition...
... is the diary of the monk Gaspar de Carvajal.
on Christmas day 1560, we reached the last pass of the Andes...
...and for the first time looked down at the legendary jungle.
in the morning I read mass, then we descended through the clouds.
Aguirre, THE WRATH OF GOD
a film by Werner Herzog
no one can get down that river alive !
I tell you, we can do it!
from here it will be easier.
no. We're all going to go under.
our Indian slaves are useless.
the changing climate kills them off like flies...
...most of them die of colds.
we don't even have time to give them a Christian burial.
come on, move it!
move you pigs! Come on! Let's go !
keep moving, we don't want to get stuck in the mud!
son of a bitch!
you idiots! The sedan-chair will get stuck!
this way!
damned mud!
watch it, you idiots!
keep the barrel out of the water!
by the last day of the year, we were exhausted.
we camped near the river.
it can't go on like this, men.
the rations are almost finished.
the terrain is so difficult, we're almost at a standstill.
we cannot hope to reach a populated area for some time.
in view of the situation we're in...
... I have changed my plans...
...as follows:
rafts will be built and manned by forty men.
these men will have the task...
...to get food and information about hostile Indians...
...and the location of El Dorado.
we have every reason to believe that both are near...
the expedition must return within one week...
... by water or by land.
if it doesn't...
...we have to assume it is lost...
...and we have to march back the same way...
... in the hope of reaching an area inhabited by Christians.
we hope, of course, that this will not happen...
...as long as the Virgin Mary is with us.
after careful consideration, I have decided...
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua commander of the expedition.
his mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza, will accompany him.
this happens against my better judgement.
but she expressed her wish with such grace and firmness...
...that I cannot refuse it.
don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command.
a man who is well qualified for this task.
his daughter Flores will stay under his protection...
...this also is against my better judgement.
at fifteen, she should have stayed in the care of the Holy Sisters.
as on all expeditions, the word of God must be brought to the pagans.
I hereby nominate Brother Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.
the remaining two hundred slaves will stay with my group.
the Royal House of Spain will be represented...
... by the brave nobleman, Don Fernando de Guzman...
...who proved his courage 10 years ago...
...at the storming of the fortress of Sax ahuaman.
some of the best warriors will form this group...
... but those not chosen shouldn't feel rejected.
I declare all this in the form of a document...
...to be submitted for approval to the Council of the Indies.
herewith I append my signature.
four days later, on January fourth, we set out.
may God be with us.
watch the raft, the rapids get stronger!
keep in the middle of the river!
the first raft got stuck in an eddy! - They must get away from the rocks!
january Sixth.
we finally reached shore and set up camp.
on the other side of the river, one of our rafts ran into an eddy.
we could not hear what they were yelling, and could not help.
how many are on the raft?
seven and two Indians.
we must try to help the poor devils, Aguirre.
you are crazy!
we will not help them!
I'm still giving the orders.
is that so...
we need long ropes and hooks. Further downstream we can cross.
once we're on the other side, we'll be able to get them out.
take as many men as you need... and hurry!
I wonder if Armando has reached the other side?
those men must be getting sick. They're still going around in circles.
what is this? - They're firing over there.
they're trying to signal us.
maybe it's a battle?
there are only six.
the oarsmen and the seventh man have gone.
I find that strange.
look, the oars are still there.
I'm sure, there are still some Indians in this area.
we better go back to the camp.
keep your eyes open!
help!
Indians! Indians!
a prayer from here is not enough, Brother Carvajal.
I want to take these men back for a Christian burial.
you are right, my son...
...their souls will rest much better in consecrated ground.
it's the least we can do for these poor guys who died so bravely.
Perucho, don't you think the cannon is getting a bit rusty?
perhaps.
you know very well who is responsible.
if Aguirre gets away with this, who knows what he'll do next?
don't worry about that.
we really have other problems.
there are Indians everywhere.
the whole area is full of them...
...and no one wants to die like the men on the raft.
if only we were out of this trouble...
we can't hope for that yet.
don't be afraid.
Aguirre would never dare to rebel against the Spanish crown.
we are not in Castile, here.
look what I've found for you.
this animal sleeps its whole life away.
it's never really awake.
our rafts are gone.
the rafts are gone !
january Eighth.
the river rose fifteen feet over night.
when will our misfortunes end?
if I remove your chains, will you run away?
would you?
stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?
what are you doing with my pot?
no, the wood is too heavy.
we'll take this one. I'm not taking one step further into this jungle.
what's going on?
we're making nails.
what for?
we need as many nails as possible.
what are you doing with this log?
well, I'm carrying it from where I found it back to the camp.
who gave that order?
everyone here is collecting wood.
and iron.
what's going on here?
I have no idea.
who gave the order to build rafts?
what does it all mean? Do you know, Inez?
don't even ask. It's your father's fault.
if only it were all over.
gentlemen, as your commander, I have decided...
...to return to our main troop.
it's not my habit to retreat.
we have to march back, of course, because the current is too strong.
we need to get back within the time Pizarro ordered.
but that would be suicide because of the Indians.
whatever the cost, we have to march back.
we must get back to Pizarro !
shit on Pizarro !
I say, we can't accomplish our task this way.
and I say, we can conquer without Pizarro !
that's what we gathered logs and iron for...
...to build a raft.
do you remember Hernando Cortez?
bound for Mexico, he was ordered to return...
... but he just went on!
silence, Aguirre !
he ignored the orders and conquered Mexico !
silence, everyone !
that's how he became rich and famous...
be quiet!
because he disobeyed!
put him in chains!
stop it, now!
anyone else?
what do you think will happen now?
what if there are waterfalls downstream?
who cares, as long as we get closer to El Dorado.
have you seen Ursua clenching his fist?
he must have something in it.
I think, they will kill him.
would you have the courage to help him?
you're the only one who can help us.
I know he will kill Ursua and Armando.
he will finish what he has started.
you are my last hope.
thou lettest man flow on like a river...
...and Thy years know no end.
as for man...
... his days are like grass...
...as a flower on the field, so he blossoms.
for when the wind passeth over it...
...and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
you know, my child...
...for the good of our Lord...
...the Church was always on the side of the strong.
I would like to have you on our side.
we need men like you.
you should think about it...
... but not too long.
well, gentlemen...
...we've gotten rid of the troublemakers.
now we need a leader.
for me, the choice is clear.
we should elect the biggest and strongest nobleman we have.
what me? - Yes... you.
well, gentlemen.
I am making a proposal to elect Guzman.
who else is for him?
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre remains second-in-command!
who's in favor?
plagues have come over my people, earthquakes and floods...
... but what the Spaniards did to us...
... is much, much worse.
they gave me the name Balthasar, but my real name is Runo Rimac.
Runo Rimac. Runo Rimac
it means: He who speaks. I was a prince in this land.
no one was allowed to look directly into my eyes.
but now I'm in chains, like my people...
...and I must bow my head.
almost everything was taken from us. I can't do anything, I'm powerless.
but I am also sorry for you...
... because I know there is no escape from this jungle.
because of our mutiny, we must make our position legal.
read this document.
caesarian King, by the grace of God, through our Holy Mother...
...the Roman Church, Philip the Second of Castile.
we, the undersigned, have until yesterday...
...the seventh day of 1561
... regarded ourselves as your servants and subjects.
we are now more than 200 miles from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.
fate, God's help and the work of our hands have carried us down a river.
a river, the natives call Huallaga, in search of a new land of gold.
we have decided to put an end to the quirks of fate.
we are forging history, and no fruits of this earth shall henceforth be shared.
we rebel until death.
our hands shall perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so.
the House of Habsburg is overthrown.
and you, Philip the Second, are dethroned.
by dint of this declaration, be you annihilated.
in your place we proclaim...
...the nobleman from Sevilla, Don Fernando de Guzman...
...as Emperor of El Dorado.
flee from hence, O King!
and may God bless your soul.
fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward.
let's sever our ties with Spain and crown Don Fernando de Guzman...
... Emperor of El Dorado.
do you call this a throne?
what is a throne, but a plank covered with velvet, Your Majesty.
he must have dragged himself along.
that's no arrow wound, that was a sword thrust.
he must have tried to stop him.
january Tenth.
Armando escaped from his prison.
the man who went on guard at three o'clock was murdered.
it was one of his men.
while Ursua is alive...you'll never be safe !
what can I do about it?
kill him.
while I'm Emperor, law will prevail.
no killings without a trial.
then try him... and then kill him!
but it must me a public trial.
he still has sympathizers.
Perucho, to the witness stand.
what did you get out of Ursua?
nothing.
three men couldn't open his fist. He must have something in it.
we'd have to chop his hand off to get at it.
he said nothing, except some nonsense.
but last night he had visitors.
the whole story reeks of conspiracy.
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that he received money from Ursua.
Yes, it's true.
it was the oarsmen's pay.
next witness!
Okello, is it true that you also received money from Ursua?
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he gave me away for this expedition...
... because he thought, if the Indians are scared of a horse...
...they'd be terrified of a black man.
well, I don't know why, but sometimes Ursua gave me money.
what does the defendant have to say?
I want to speak.
in Spain I had many servants, and I paid them.
it is only fair to give them money here as well...
...even if they are Indians.
time will tell that Ursua is right.
we understand your confusion, my child. You are excused.
the jury, after having heard all testimonies...
...finds the defendant...
...guilty of treason.
my unpleasant duty...
...as President of the first court of your Highness, Don Fernando...
... is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...
...to death by hanging.
I confirm the verdict.
but since it is the anniversary of the last Moor leaving Spain...
... I will grant clemency.
his life will be spared, but he forfeits...
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.
half of his shares will go to the Church...
...the other half will be divided among my best soldiers.
january Twelfth.
in the morning we set out with a new raft.
Ursua is still alive...
...but he refuses to speak.
look, a fire !
at noon we saw a great fire.
steer closer to the shore !
load your muskets.
I can't see anyone.
be careful, men! It could be an ambush.
strip the negro, go on!
fearing an ambush, we stripped the negro slave, to frighten the Indians.
go ! run!
go on! Go, I said!
drive him in front of us!
get away from the food!
look out for Indians!
are you crazy?
take your weapons!
look at that. It was one of our men.
where does this come from?
and this here?
for heaven's sake, cannibals!
the discovery of cannibals around us was so disturbing...
...that we hastily left this dreadful place.
january twentieth.
the mountains are now behind us and the land is flat.
the roof Aguirre had us build, protects us against the scorching sun.
the river is sluggish and we're slowly coming to a halt.
what's this? Are you giving him a gun?
Aguirre, I know that you plan on doing something to Ursua!
there's no doubt in my mind.
and God will punish you for that!
get out of my way!
are you alright, little one?
what's happening? You can't hear a thing.
it's suddenly so quiet.
Yes, not a sound.
Shh...so, we can hear...
the gunpowder! It's on fire !
out of the way! It's going to blow up!
grab the pole !
help me pull the Emperor onto the raft!
here, so he can hold on to it.
damned horse...
... nothing but trouble !
what's wrong with him?
he's dead.
look how short the arrow is.
poisoned.
it must belong to a dwarf.
fire ! make some noise, quickly! - What are we to aim at?
just shoot, you asshole !
fire !
fire !
come, play something for the men.
january twenty fourth.
for the first time, we saw two of the savages.
they seemed to be trusting.
pull the boat close.
I have the man. Hold him!
and I have the woman.
look, there's a fish!
what did he say?
he says...
... he's from the Yagua Tribe.
he knows from his ancestors that one day, the Sons of the Sun...
...would arrive from afar, through great perils.
the strangers would come with thunder from tubes.
they've waited a long time for the coming of the Sons of the Sun.
for here on this river, God never finished His Creation.
look, gold! Where did you get that?
gold!
gold! Ask him where he got it from.
ask him where El Dorado is.
where does this gold come from?
what did he say?
has this savage ever heard of our savior Jesus Christ...
...and of our mission and the True Word of God?
this is a Bible. It contains the Word of God...
...that we preach to bring light into the darkness of their world.
does he understand at all, that this book contains the Word of God?
take it in your hand, my son.
it is a tough business.
these savages are hard to convert.
it won't be much longer.
el Dorado might be only a few days away.
no more rust on the cannon.
we will shoot our enemies with golden bullets.
and you, Okello, will serve my food on golden platters.
and all of us will gain something.
Governships...
... provinces...
...and women.
and perhaps I'll even be free.
let's not forget the most important part of our mission...
...to spread the Word of God to the savages.
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross studded with jewels, Carvajal...
... instead of the silver one you lost.
all the land to our left and all the land to our right...
... now belongs to us.
I solemnly and formally take possession of all this land.
our country is already six times larger than Spain...
...and every day we drift, makes it bigger.
have you seen any solid ground that would support your weight?
Okello, it's missing salt!
fish and fruit we can find now and then...
... but we've been out of salt for a while.
we're down to counting our last grains of corn.
watch, that it doesn't jump off board!
damn, get that horse away from me !
throw that damned beast off the raft!
go on! Go for a swim!
in Mexico, I saw an army of Indians flee at the sight of one single horse.
and besides, we could have eaten meat for a week...
don't worry, little one, the horse will be alright.
Oh, my God, the Emperor!
the Emperor is dead!
after our Emperor's death, the fate of Ursua was sealed.
next morning, a few soldiers took him away and he never came back.
what are they shouting?
they're shouting, "Meat is floating by.
fire !
set the village on fire !
keep shooting, it'll scare them!
don't go into the jungle !
salt!
salt!
I haven't had salt for a month!
she has gone without a trace. We couldn't find her anywhere.
we have not seen any Indians either.
let's march back to Pizarro.
two men, more or less, it won't matter to him.
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.
if I march at night, the Indians won't catch me.
in the day, I will hide. I will get back to Pizarro.
we followed her tracks half a mile into the jungle, then we lost them.
she simply vanished!
then one of the men panicked because of the silence...
...which always comes just before someone gets killed.
I'd rather join the Indians, than stay with this madman.
that man is a head taller than me.
that may change...
I'll explain my plan. I have counted the river bends.
I've drawn a map in the sand.
we need about a day for each bend.
I am the great traitor. There can be no greater!
whoever even thinks about deserting will be cut into 198 pieces!
and then trampled upon until you can paint the walls with him.
whoever eats one grain too many...
...or drinks one drop of water too much...
...will be locked up for 155 years!
if l, Aguirre, want the birds to drop dead from the trees...
...the birds will drop dead from the trees.
I am the Wrath of God!
the earth I walk upon sees me and quakes!
but whoever follows me and the river, will win untold riches.
but whoever deserts...
get away from the tree ! go to mid-stream!
watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!
careful!
the long arrows are getting fashionable...
the men's morale is at a low point. I spoke with Aguirre.
things are not turning out as we expected.
we see nothing but hunger and death.
we lose men, but we never see the enemy.
even El Dorado hasn't been more than an illusion.
mexico was no illusion!
if we turn back now, others will come.
and they will succeed!
and we'll remain a failure !
even if this land only consists of trees and water...
...we will conquer it!
and it'll be milked dry by those who follow us.
my men measure riches in gold.
it is more.
it is power and fame.
I despise them for it.
I am sure, Aguirre is leading us into destruction.
I almost feel, he does it deliberately.
we can't even get ashore, since the river flooded the jungle for miles.
february twenty-second.
the suffering is dreadful.
most men have fever and hallucinations.
hardly anyone can stand upright.
the soldier Justo Gonzales drank my ink, thinking it was medicine.
I can no longer write.
we are drifting in circles.
I see a ship with sails...
... in a tall tree...
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.
the ship is in your imagination.
no floodwaters could rise this high.
we all have the fever.
it is only a mirage.
these things happen when people are overly exhausted.
shut up, monk!
we'll get that ship! It is real! We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.
no, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go with you. We are weak and hungry.
that is no ship. That is no forest.
that is no arrow.
we just imagine the arrows, because we fear them.
these arrows are real, take cover!
this arrow can't harm me.
this is not rain.
monk, do not forget to pray, lest God's end...
...will be uncomely.
when we reach the sea...
...we will build a bigger ship...
...sail north and take Trinidad from the Spanish crown.
from there we'll sail on...
...and take Mexico from Cortez.
what great treachery this will be!
then, all of New Spain will be in our hands...
...and we'll stage history...
...like others stage plays.
l, the Wrath of God...
...will marry my own daughter...
...and with her I will found the purest dynasty...
...the earth has ever seen.
together...
...we shall rule this entire continent.
we will endure.
I am the Wrath of God!
who else is with me?
Alejandro Galán...
you can go in now. - Is it a boy?
no, it's a beautiful girl.
sir!
sir!
Alejandro!
is he born?
what's wrong?
is my son all right?
Carmen?
son? What son?
it's a girl.
another one.
Olivia's waiting for you. Go and see what she wants.
there's nothing else.
a kiss. - A "hairy" kiss.
don't make any noise, your father's asleep.
why didn't you come?
I'm doing things.
what things? - Drawings.
of what?
who for?
nothing for me...
Thanks!
here, the butterflies aren't right.
they're difficult.
but this is beautiful!
and is this me?
where shall I put it?
there's hardly any room left.
and Grandad?
stop it, love.
this working by night and sleeping by day, would kill anybody.
you'll have to put up with it.
things are tight now.
they always be, with what they pay me.
forget about it now.
today's a holiday, so come on, relax a bit.
I put up with it so as not to annoy Lucio.
I can't complain, he was the one who got me the job.
but as soon as things are a bit better...
I'm through, right? At very most a year and that's it.
I'm going to kiss Ami good night.
even that wasn't right.
what?
I couldn't even give you a son to help you.
don't say that.
if we have a daughter it's God's will.
it's all right.
but a son...
a father needs a man at his side.
ami is clever. - She's bright, I know that.
but once she's married, who'll remember your name?
or her granfather's?
the less of him the better.
what? - Nothing.
a name is not so important.
what matters is to carry it with dignity.
well...
I think so.
my father had five sisters.
they all had daughters.
not one man in the family.
he says it's like a curse.
he talks a lot of rubbish.
don't say that in his house.
I'm going to see Ami.
aren't you asleep?
you are not frightened of the thunder?
that's just angels playing marbles.
didn't you know? Or had you forgotten?
I know, but they scare me.
angels can't scare you.
said your prayers?
did it fall over?
remember to pray.
he'll look after you, even if it thunders.
if you forget, He'll punish you.
if people prayed more, it would be a better world.
we should fear God more, and respect Him.
you understand?
well, come on.
go to sleep. Give me a kiss.
good night, love.
are you still scared?
come on, no storm lasts all night.
good night.
she'll hear us.
come on...
Amanda!
get out at once!
Gabriel...
she was looking. - She didn't see anything.
are you sure?
Yes, of course.
what are you looking at?
nothing.
the dark swallows will return on your balcony their nests to hang.
and with their wings beating fast call to you.
but those whose flight res...
Silence!
study it again and then I'll ask you.
Amanda!
what?
do you know the poem?
Yes, but I don't like it.
I don't understand it.
is that for your son?
well, it's for my daughter.
why bring her that?
look, there are some dolls that are almost new.
she doesn't like dolls. I'll bring her this.
she's good with her hands, likes drawing and that.
turned out badly, did she?
keep an eye on her, or she'll be a lady lover.
no, it's not that.
she's got dolls at home.
why have you got the light on?
Carmen?
are you sick?
what's the matter?
what happened?
we're going to have a baby.
what?
why don't you wait in the kitchen?
I'm almost finished.
are you sick?
I'm just a bit tired.
why not go out with Grandad?
he's bored.
what?
didn't you hear me?
go at once!
I don't want to. He smells bad.
go immediately!
you have fixed it?
well?
do you like it?
and what...
what do you say? - Thank you.
thank you?
thank you, Dad.
said your prayers?
not yet.
do not forget.
for if you don't remember Him, He won't remember you either.
give me a kiss.
see you tomorrow.
goodbye.
what did your father say?
about what? - The baby.
that it'll be another girl.
it'll be what God wills.
I said it wouldn't.
I'd call it after him.
Alejandro. - That's not important.
what matters is his health. - But it is important.
and Ami?
what about Ami?
what did she say?
nothing. - Nothing?
you know her, she never says anything.
but is she happy about it?
of course.
of course she is.
I'm going to put my father to bed.
mommy!
come here!
what?
I can't do the butterflies. It's impossible.
draw another animal, something bigger.
a fish or a dog.
a whale. - I like them small.
come and see. - Not just now.
after I hang the washing.
where is she? - Who?
the child.
I don't know, she might be in her room.
you'll pull my finger off.
come on, silly, laugh.
you're dying to.
give me a kiss.
don't be so stubborn!
a "hairy" kiss.
what a temper you have.
let's tidy up.
you're very fat.
I'm getting very fat.
I'll end up looking like Goyi.
don't!
when will you be back?
at about seven.
waken me around four.
are you all right?
and Grandad? - Still in the room.
I'll put him to bed. - I'll do it now.
he's nearly here, isn't he?
there's not long to go.
it mustn't happen when I'm out.
it's not time yet. But Alejandro moves so much.
he keeps kicking me.
his name doesn't matter.
so what if it's a boy or a girl! It's ours.
hush, she'll hear you.
so what?
nothing, she...
...may be asleep. - So soon?
some chance!
does she ask about the baby?
at times.
she's still angry.
about the scarf?
here.
I'll go and say goodbye.
if she's not asleep. - Listen, say nothing about this.
children don't understand.
and it's unlucky.
are you asleep?
goddam!
grandad...
Grandad?
I'll collect them all on Friday, so start now and they'll be ready on the day.
cut and stick... cardboard, colored paper.
draw something that is... presentable.
think of any object, any animal, any person.
the postman, for instance.
Olivia!
what will you draw?
a postman.
can't you think of anything else?
a plant, a flower...
no, what?
a flower.
and you can't think of anything else?
don't you like animals?
dogs?
have you decided?
a dog. - Very well.
Olivia's going to draw a dog.
silence, silence.
this work isn't for you.
I want you to give it to someone else.
write their name on it...
think of the person you love most in the world.
did anyone help you?
it's lovely.
your mother will be very happy.
is Mommy sick?
is she dying?
why do you say that?
she's fine.
Really? - Of course she is.
I promise you.
mommy is very strong.
it's a boy.
dad, it's a boy.
do you hear?
we have a son.
I know.
and he's healthy.
what?
I'm going to feed the baby, don't come in.
you heard?
is Ami not back yet? - No, she isn't.
Where's that thing I brought her?
it's not in her room.
it's there. She didn't bother with it.
she's so tidy.
she doesn't draw much now. - She's getting older.
and more jealous. - What nonsense!
jealous of what? - Of everything.
women are like that. - She's got everything.
none of the other girls do.
but before it was just her.
madam is going to turn out spoiled.
I'm going shopping.
don't let anyone in.
turn off the TV if you leave the room.
and keep quiet, your Dad and Alejandro are asleep.
I won't be long.
Hello, Goyi. - Hello, how's the baby?
he's wonderful.
Amanda!
where are you?
come here!
what did you do?
where is he?
where is the baby? Where is the baby?!
tell me!
tell me!
what's wrong?
shouldn't we talk to her?
she won't come out.
what for?
you can't reason with her.
she's like a mule.
she'll forget it in a few weeks.
we should say something.
you act like it was normal.
she knows it was a mistake.
you think she doesn't? Well, she does.
I'm telling you.
she won't forgive me.
she's bitter, like her grandfather.
and her grandfather's daughter.
Christ!
get out!
do you hear me?!
I told you never come in when I'm here. Go away!
you're not up yet?
what time is it? - Almost twelve.
I'm not well.
another headache?
a bad one.
I'll have a wash. Then I'll lie down in the other room.
are you busy?
I found this at work.
maybe you can use it.
I'll leave it here.
Thanks.
I'm going to bed.
if you remember call me at eight.
your mother isn't well, another headache.
the dinner plates are still on the table.
I'll tidy them up.
good, I'm very tired.
did you get the milk?
I'll have some.
are you going shopping?
good night.
the milk money?
well!
why the hurry?
drop by the house some day! I'll check your oil!
so long.
the milk?
we're running late today.
would you hold the door, son?
Angelines...
two bottles, right?
what? Don't you like it?
I just don't want to eat it again.
what do you want to eat?
no, nothing. This is fine.
do you want meat? A piece of ham?
well, if there were any...
of course there is.
go and buy some ham.
what? Now?
I'm waiting.
for what?
forget it. I'll eat this.
go this minute.
do you hear me?
it doesn't matter.
I've almost finished.
you'll go when I tell you.
Carmen, that's enough.
you'll get a headache.
it's a lie.
what?
your pains. Nothing hurts you.
you go if you want.
see?
I've finished.
she's going now.
I'm fed up with her doing nothing.
people like her are parasites.
you're a... - Ami!
come on.
do it.
what?
can't you do it?
of course you can.
you're the same.
Carmen, please. She's just a child.
a child?!
she was never a child. She was born evil.
stop it! For God's sake, she's your daughter.
I have no children.
I have to kill you.
are you asleep?
I didn't want to say anything, but I wanted to.
you know your mother.
you have to let her get over her moods.
some people you can talk to, others, you can't.
anyway,
God made her like that.
remember how I used to tuck you in at night?
see you tomorrow.
goodbye.
come on, don't be like that. No storm lasts all night.
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.
maybe not.
maybe you shouldn't stay here.
the milk.
you know how I am. - Shut up.
you know I'm sick, yet... - Just shut up.
shut away in your room...
you're like a slug! - Shut up!
you want to kill me! - Shut up!
you're not going to do anything, are you?
you are evil!
you are evil!
so far away.
good boy.
AMI, who is it? Is it Gorka?
tell him to come in.
was the street hard to find?
not really. Who was that? Your daughter?
who, Ami? Yes.
she's temperamental.
not on the head. I'm studying. Honestly.
is your father here? - Wait a minute.
I'll wait, if you take the sticks away.
he's getting dressed.
I'll wait.
got a light?
it doesn't matter, I won't smoke.
I'll send your father the doctor's bill.
what?
I have to see one after the fright you gave me.
my nerves.
don't grow your hair. It's nice like that!
hi there, cutie.
well, she even laughs.
he's almost ready. Come in a bit.
a bit? Sorry, all of me has to come in.
I just came to say hello.
know what?
my flowerpot talks more than you.
don't go out looking like that.
what?
I'd a friend haIf as pretty as you, and she got raped.
it was a joke.
well,
I'm off.
I just wanted to say...
you're beautiful.
so long.
so long.
what do you want?
your father...
what?
he forgot his supper.
I don't know. - Take it to him.
he'll be at the Cantones.
look who's coming. - Who?
Gabriel's daughter, the dyke.
we'll have a laugh tonight.
good night. - Hello.
looking for your father?
where did he go? - I don't know.
what's it called? - Hi, cutie.
your dad forgot his supper?
Thanks, I was a bit hungry. - Where is he?
he's over in Lizaso.
I'll take you.
you know Lucio?
who? - The fat guy.
Yes, he comes to the house.
a pig.
the problem with the job is the people.
what about the garbage?
it's great. You find something every night.
I get everything from it.
like you. - What do you mean?
isn't your dad a garbage man?
do I smell bad?
not yet, I've just started.
your father... Well, you're used to it.
he knows about smelling.
we'll sit down. - I don't see him.
he has to pass by here.
see how I got out of doing my work?
this is nothing.
I spend entire nights accompanying girls who brought their fathers' supper.
what an idiot! - I do, really.
I guess he is not coming. - How strange.
we can go back. - I don't know...
or I'll give it to him. - Give it to me.
give it to me, please.
really, I'll give it to him.
I'll take you home.
fucking garbage!
this isn't it. - You never been here?
that's odd.
everyone comes back.
where are you going? - Like surprises?
come on.
Gorka!
where are you?
know what we're going to do?
eat your father's sandwich.
fuck! Omelet! - How can we eat it?
don't worry. I'll tell him you brought it and I ate it.
what do you think of it?
well...
it's a good place to be alone.
come on, sit down.
come on.
know what?
I was hoping all night this would happen.
what?
that I'd eat this sandwich. It smelled great!
careful!
you nearly squashed it.
so what? - It's dead...
"so what?." Don't you like them?
they are incredible.
what are you doing? You're crazy!
fuck!
what's up with you?
it's just a worm. - A worm?
why did you do that?
I don't understand. Something lovely...
well...
you're lovelier.
shall we go? - Where can they be?
I wouldn't have allowed it.
what? - If she were my daughter.
you do as you want.
what do you mean?
nothing, but just be warned. I don't trust "the big one."
"the big one"?
fuck! It's a nickname.
my brother-in-law was inside with him.
where?
where do you think? In jail!
has he been in jail?
tell me! - Well, he's not that bad.
I know nothing.
he was done for rape, things like that.
let's go.
wait a bit.
come on. Lie down here.
what are you doing? - Relax.
wait.
stop. - It's all right.
no, don't.
that's enough! - What's up?
I want to go. - Ami, it's all right.
that's enough.
please, stop it.
I want to go. - Stop it!
you can't go now.
I have to kiss you.
I can't wait.
come on, I know you want it too.
you think I didn't notice.
you've never done it?
don't be afraid.
just relax.
Christ!
come here!
please, no.
dear God, let nothing happen to her.
bastard! Come here!
don't run, bastard!
take it easy, all right?
what's up? - Where's my daughter?
what?
why are you picking on me?
why did you run? - Why did I run?
fuck! You were crazy, like a mad man!
what is it?
she was with you. - Right, she was!
she left an hour ago.
where will I put him? - In the room.
right at the end.
can you hear me?
dad, it's Ami.
the doctors said you can hear maybe even understand.
can you hear me?
say something if you hear me.
I can't take it any more.
I can't even help you.
can you hear me?
move your hand if you understand.
tell me if you forgive me. Tell me.
goodbye, Dad. I love you very much.
what?
you're going out?
get some fruit and a bit of ham for your father.
I'm not going out today.
I'll be right back.
don't be long.
and take care...
daughter.
what did you say?
what?
what did you say?
when?
what did you call me?
what's up with you?
what a temper!
come on, idiot.
give me a kiss.
but a "hairy" one.
now, go on.
I've to make two beds, hang out the washing, and feed the baby.
he's not to cut the ham too thin.
you're lucky, you know.
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.
I know, I know, I know.
humble digs.
not exactly what you'd call a "panty peeler."
do you know what I mean?
but it suits me just fine.
to be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.
you see, here's my theory:
for most women, if a guy's a good provider and generally a nice chap, six-pack abs really aren't a deal-breaker.
on the flip side, however, even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...
and he will deny it. For us boys, it's all about F.B.B.
face. Boobs. Bum.
I'm just being honest.
it's been said that clothes speak the international language.
and I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fashion whore.
unfortunately, today I've got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit, but that's all right. Gucci. End-of-summer sale.
very understated. And I can easily spice it up with...
what? No, no. I know what you are thinking.
if you ooze masculinity, like some of us do, you have no reason to fear pink. Smashing.
now, in the cologne department, most men overdo it.
americans practically spray it on with a crop-duster.
my rule: Nothing above the neck, though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.
you never know where the day may take you.
almost forgot.
new word for the day.
Ostentatious: The attempt to attract attention to oneself.
who? Me?
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude. I haven't introduced myself.
I'm... -Alfie
there you go. Alfie.
are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?
no, no, no. You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.
you are such a doll, Alfie. But I'm supposed to be on a diet.
Oh, on a diet?
a diet. -You?
Yeah. -Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu, but you should know by now that a full-figured girl like yourself -is every guy's secret fantasy. -Stop it.
so she's a tub of lard. The ship's already sailed, so why not make her feel good about herself, right?
Oh, Lu -Yes, angel
I'm working the night spot, and my apartment is a horror show, so I'm sorry if I keep you up -with the dust-busting at 2 a.m. -Oh, don't you worry.
I'll give it a quick straighten. -Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.
nonsense. I like doing things for you, Alfie.
I'm a blessed man having you in my life.
thank you.
keys are in the usual spot.
now, back home, you're always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money.
so not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.
now, I must admit, I had a second motive.
I'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...
...resided in Manhattan.
and when it comes to shagging birds, it's all about one thing:
location, location, location.
God, I love this city. All right, girls.
just look around. I mean, every one of them, unique, special, like snowflakes.
and with such a plethora...
calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity, well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.
my priorities leaning towards wine, women...
well, actually, that's about it.
wine and women.
although, women and women is always a fun option.
so...
...to live life to the fullest,
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.
I've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.
I think this might just be my favourite position.
I know it was President Kennedy's.
he was such a great leader.
of course, JFK used the old bad-back excuse, but if you ask me, he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion.
what is it about the back of a limo?
obligatory cuddling.
thousand one, thousand two...
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking. I've got a 10: 00 pickup.
you better hurry up. You don't want to keep her waiting.
quite the number, isn't she?
yet, she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months.
six months. I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack.
just look at her. Legs like a racehorse.
perfect yoga bum. I give her my highest grade:
where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?
a movie. -Treasure, please, no, no, no.
stop messing about. You'll ruin my presets.
sorry. -What movie?
I don't know. What's the difference?
the difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he'll be.
it wouldn't matter what I said.
it would never occur to Phil that another man - would ever look twice at me. - Dor, darling, you fishing for a compliment?
no.
you should know by now they only come from me when least expected.
now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.
I don't care if he does.
there's one thing that puts me off marriage: It's married women.
Dorie doesn't know it yet, but you won't be seeing much more of her.
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.
sooner or later, she'll be wanting a little bit more than I'm able to give.
wouldn't it be great if I was going home with you tonight instead of Phil the Pill?
Yeah.
it's definitely time to stage a disappearing act.
so next Tuesday, same time, same place?
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week. I'm booked double shifts.
I'll call you the instant things let up. -Okay.
in the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.
Oh, Dor
your derriere looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.
see?
a compliment when least expected.
what can I say? Happy as a pup with two tails.
and I think I've done old Phil a bit of a favour too.
of course, he'd be the last to see it.
never expect any thanks in this life.
you know what I mean? So Tuesday...
...10: 03 p. m.
do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge, or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?
decisions, decisions...
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit to my semi-regular, quasi, sort of girlfriend.
my sweet Julie.
let me guess. Unexpected last-minute fare.
Yeah. She had me going up and down for hours.
that supposed to be funny? Because it is so very...
not.
Hey!
I'm not kidding, Alfie!
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.
you have a very ostentatious way of showing it.
Yeah, I sure do.
no, darling. Can we hit pause? I just need a second to unwind.
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.
how do you want yours, on the rocks?
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.
no, I'm so totally knackered. I'll make it up to you in the morning.
cross my heart.
but tonight, all I'm good for is a bite to eat, hot bath and a nice long sleep.
you know, this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.
what's that again?
where were you tonight? Really?
you've got to open a restaurant. That's seriously delicious.
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.
Hey.
a little eye contact, please.
we have something here, or am I just a glorified booty call?
Hey.
Hey.
here's what she's really saying:
she wants me to commit. Translation: Become "domestified."
now, it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life.
change your nature, you're a dead man.
chilli, please.
don't get me wrong. She's adorable.
cute? Absolutely. But is it ever enough?
I told you how we men are. We want showstoppers.
and the problem is, Julie hasn't got enough of the superficial things that really matter.
I don't deserve you. -Yeah, that's probably true.
too bad I love you.
Thanks, babe.
Alfie, Alfie... -What?
you're giving me the "Thanks, babe."
you're giving me the "Thanks, baby."
calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!
I know how you feel! - Wait a minute.
you're gonna wake up... -Max.
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?
Yes.
now, lads, learn from my mistake.
never get involved with a single mum.
see, they come with accessories, some of which can be...
...unfortunately, irresistible.
sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.
and women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don't they?
I think that's what Julie was banging on about yesterday.
elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.
this is where I make my reasonably honest living.
standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?
I know. Believe me, it's merely a stepping stone.
currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.
black. Like Lonette's skin...
...which I will never again touch.
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form.
see, Marlon's got a problem.
it's called Lonette.
and very recently, it dumped him.
Oh, dear. Come on, what was it this time?
three a. m. Begging, at her front door.
level of inebriation? -Vomiting.
right. So let me get this straight. You were at her front door, 3 a. m. In the morning, begging and vomiting?
and what, she wasn't charmed by that?
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli in car number two?
I've no idea.
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.
that little chap's name is Wing.
my boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.
wipe that car good. -Owner, that is, till me and Marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...
hello. You miss bird shit.
wing.
he's barking mad.
check out the way he talks to the little woman.
she's given him her best years, cooked his chop suey, helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn't wait to rip off her kimono. And now look at him.
and I'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage?
that's a great figure, man. We swing that loan, cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...
we're gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.
I could've predicted this. See, Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18-month "Where are we going, what are we doing, what's happening here?" crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship. Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.
Marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way.
I fucked up egregiously.
I see you're making the most of that birthday calendar.
by the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back...
...it was too late. - Hey, stranger.
Hey.
Carol.
Carol. Hi, Carol. - Hi.
you look wonderful.
so, Carol, well, it's nice to see you again. You be well.
what's up with that?
put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.
do I even wanna know why? - No. Come on, it would be less than discreet to tell you why.
hair on the arms. Seriously. Long, thick...
what are you talking about? You don't have hair on your arms?
you're looking very lovely tonight. - Thank you.
dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.
classic, isn't it?
now that he can't have her, he thinks he can't live without her.
some people are funny.
Marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation.
maybe... Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.
anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie. Got a lot on my mind.
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate when that happens.
open up, baby. You look seriously beautiful.
not tonight, Alfred. - What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't... I'm just... Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...
I'm just seeing red.
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.
come on, haven't you...? You've tortured him long enough.
Alfie, he should've thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex-girlfriend of his.
those fake-ass, $5 titties.
those are fake? - Hello?
wow, I'm devastated. They've got, like...
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?
begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...
I don't care.
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't forgive and I definitely do not forget.
is okay if I leave now, miss? - Oh, si, Felix.
and hit the lights on your way out, por favor.
I better go.
it's really coming down out there.
Yeah.
and I'm wearing suede.
you're telling the truth. That's brilliant.
okay. I got one. I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.
me neither. - Oh, shit. Okay.
okay. I've never seen a James Bond movie.
you're joking. Not even a Sean Connery?
you serious?
wow, I don't know if that's magic or tragic.
okay. Five ball. My go.
I've never made my own bed. - Oh, bullshit.
no, I repeat, I've never made my own bed.
well, what kind of mama you got?
that's a good question.
let's see. All right.
I got something for you. - All right.
I've never had sex...
I've never had sex with two people in one night.
six-five, your favour.
gotcha.
so, Alfie, what's the most you've had in one night?
we've stopped playing the game, haven't we?
am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?
Driftin' on a memory
ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
loving you
see, if I had that kind of talent...
and a song - Go on, finish your sentence. - If I had that kind of talent, and I looked like you...
and a song ...I would be strutting my stuff - Oh, yeah? - On a stage.
trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when I dropped by tonight.
but then I thought to myself, "You know what?
if this will help her get past her anger towards Marlon,
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?
to do whatever I can to help.
I find that, lately, even lying to myself comes easily.
the next morning, and I can't get last night out of my mind.
try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.
anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot, best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life girlfriend.
Alfie. Alfie.
Alfie! - Shall I pretend I can't hear him?
dude.
Hey! -Too late. Too late.
dude, would you slow down? - Hey, Marly, what's up?
Marly?
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you. You ain't going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night.
down last night? - Dude, don't mess with me.
what happened with Lonette?
have you ever heard the word "knock"?
what went down? - What? Nothing happened.
we had a few shots. - Missus give me silent treatment.
little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.
you keep it up. Keep it up, mate, it'll work.
Alfie, what happened?
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...
I drank a lot last night. - Drunk.
well, I...
I really... I don't remember.
dude, you did something to her. - No.
Oh, yeah, you did. Because she shows up at my house, at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.
she even said that if I needed more time, that she understood completely.
how fucking crazy.
chalk one up for the blokes. Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.
which means he's off scot-free, and so am I.
this is a bloody miracle. That's fantastic. Fantastic.
come on, what did you say to her? - Look, look.
it's all good. - Come on, what did you say?
I asked her to marry me.
you know you're my best man, right?
moral of the story
no good deed goes unpunished.
new word for the day?
resilience:
the ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss.
capacity to spring back.
understand, it's not about replacing Julie.
I just wanna get back to the simple life.
women who mean nothing to me.
so I've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.
Hello, Uta.
now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,
I have to live by some very simple rules.
alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy, which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me.
he said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...
...just remember, somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her.
can I help you, man? -G and T, please.
explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?
I think it's incredibly unfair that it's acceptable for men to be sexually experimental, then with a woman, if she wants to try something... A kiss or a threesome.
you know, that they'd be judged. I wouldn't judge them.
and I think if you two were to kiss, I would... I would just...
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.
although I'm living every guy's Rat Pack fantasy, something feels a bit off.
and throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn't going quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
you carry on without me.
Oh, my loves, I...
I don't know what happened. This is so unlike me.
Yeah, you... You two just...
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.
then, from out of nowhere...
...the unthinkable.
now I really don't get what everyone sees in you.
it just keeps on happening and happening.
or more accurately, not happening and not happening.
this never happens, Uta. Honestly, never.
honestly.
not the word around town...
...peewee.
mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.
Miranda.
the penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.
so I understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction.
I am experiencing a little... A little... A little bit of... What you just said.
not to worry. That's my area of expertise.
so have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?
stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.
well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.
Why? You angry? - No, I'm really not angry.
just, you know, we want different things.
and I can't have you traipsing in and out of Max's life.
you've changed your hair, haven't you?
you have, haven't you? No, you have.
you've changed your hairdo. You cut it?
it looks gorgeous.
Thanks. - How come...?
how come you never had it like that when we were together?
I really gotta go.
well, I guess...
...you need these back.
thank you.
Alfie?
you gonna be okay?
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.
Alrighty, let's take a gander at that penis of yours.
I see.
well.
it seems we have lift-off. - It seems we do.
Wunderschon.
what a relief.
well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy, I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn't I?
well, there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong, so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem -was simply stress-related. -Translation: Julie-related.
like I always say, if they don't get you one way, they'll get you another.
however, - I did feel something a little kooky. - Kooky?
there is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.
I thought I felt a lump...
...on your penis.
but with any luck, it will be nothing.
the words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.
there's something you don't hear every day.
and so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.
a penis biopsy.
I get my test results in three days... Well, five.
five counting the weekend. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
how am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'm a young man.
shift focus, Alfie. Shift...
let's go, kids. Let's go.
move along, children. Look straight ahead.
come on. Do not look at the man. Look straight ahead.
in the meantime, perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.
Alfie, dear, what's wrong? You look like death warmed over.
no, I've just... I've got a bit of a football injury, that's all,
Mrs Schnitman... Hello, Mrs Liberman.
you two look lovely. Where you going?
shopping. You need anything? - I'm fine.
hello.
can I talk to you for a minute?
ladies, this is my friend Lonette.
she's lovely. Good for you, dating an African-American.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.
don't mind us. We're not here. You kids keep talking.
very nice to meet you. - See you, Mrs Liberman.
shop till you drop, girls.
so how have you been?
I'm pregnant.
it seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.
it's the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.
I offered to face the music with her...
...but she wanted to go it alone.
we both knew that if the baby was born with any white-boy features it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.
not to mention your host for this evening.
but standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.
thinking thoughts like, "Here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know."
your own.
didn't take long.
bloody hell, you're freezing.
how do you feel?
empty.
that night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.
doesn't seem to have worked out that way, does it?
Oh, man.
if everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign.
I should think about making... Making some changes.
possibly.
next week. - Excuse me.
did I just...? Did you just look at me? Did I just notice you turn away?
look, if you know the results to my tests, and they're telling you...
mr Elkins. - Please. Please.
mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.
mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11: 30.
I'm gonna be fine.
I just feel it. -Thank you. Goodbye.
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.
it's all right. Take your time. - I don't have a choice.
I used to pee. Now I trickle.
I'm Joe. What's your name? - Alfie.
so how you doing, Alfie?
hanging in. You? -Shitty.
Yeah, me too. Me too.
I like the bolo tie. - Oh, thanks. I have a collection.
you know, when you're old, you learn to be patient.
Yeah.
used to be I never had time for nothing. Go, go, go.
I know that feeling. - Yeah.
my wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year."
I got too much on my platter.
I always thought I'd have more time.
then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.
yells, "Soup's on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.
just like that.
dead as disco.
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I tried picking up the pieces.
even went to Waikiki alone on the 8-day cruise package she was always yakking about.
couldn't get Evie out of my mind.
there's two things I learned in life, kid:
you find someone to love, and live every day as though it were your last.
she's all yours, Alfie.
enjoy.
you all right, son?
Yeah. I hope so.
look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...
...give me a holler.
you'll never call. - Maybe I will.
all right, good. We'll go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.
damn right.
Thanks, Joe.
Hey.
I'm sorry about Evie.
we...
...weren't all that fond of each other...
...but we were very close.
if you know what I mean. - I think I do.
I've been thinking a lot lately about God and death.
and how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,
I'm really in for it.
but I won't be partying with Lucifer any time soon, because my test results were negative.
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I ruined my Prada lace-ups and I don't care.
don't think I've forgotten my oath to completely change my life, because I haven't.
Carrot-apple with a dash of wheat grass.
Yep.
health is now priority number one.
business plan moves onto the fast track.
if you say so... -Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...
no, I definitely don't want to talk. Okay, hold on, what else have I got?
okay, yeah.
all right, if we must, we must, but...
new slate. New beginning.
what's your name, driver? - Alfie, sir.
wait here, Alfie.
do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?
you got someplace to go? - No, I was just gonna nip off -and get a cup of tea. - Look, why don't you just stay put.
yea or nay?
a definite yea, I think. Really.
stunning. Wouldn't you say so, sir?
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait by the car?
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages.
definite yea?
I think.
with one minor...
may I? -You may.
adjustment.
bullfighter. Another lifetime. Don't ask.
fifty, if she's a day.
but don't they say 50 is the new 40, and is she not living proof?
I mean, have a look. Beautifully preserved.
and cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.
better? - Much.
you are so right to trust Chanel. A pair of hot-pink stilettos, and you're good to go.
well, aren't you Mr Full-Service? - We try.
he's getting a little pissy, isn't he? - Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.
is your husband a lot older than you? - He's not my husband.
he's wearing a wedding ring.
well, I never said he wasn't somebody else's husband.
grab the stuff from the trunk -You got it.
Cheers.
ma'am, if you require my services in the future.
happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.
now that, my friends, is a real woman.
smart and sexy and...
you noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?
makes me think, if a woman like that, of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me, then, perhaps...
perhaps I'm selling myself a bit short.
in a flash,
I have my New Year's resolution.
aim higher.
catastrophic. Doomed.
desolate. Cataclysmic.
bought him a word-of-the-day calendar for Christmas.
big mistake.
holiday season, busiest time of the year.
I try to run a business.
what's the problem, Mr Wing? - Your soul brother.
he quit.
in the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...
...but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.
he said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.
they decided, on the spur of the moment, to move upstate, and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.
somehow Lonette convinced Marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.
and to make matters worse, it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year?
Christmas Eve.
a night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness, anguish, despair.
not a great time to be flying solo.
that's why I'm of the belief couples should never split up between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.
always have a relationship to see you through the holidays. Always.
the downside, of course, being gifts.
personally, I've always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.
not that I've ever actually had a Christmas.
that's a whole other Dickens story.
taxi.
taxi.
excuse me.
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law for me to carry any more than...
thank the Lord.
a Christmas miracle.
all right, hop in.
thanks for saving us. I was freezing my little tush off.
no worries. You know, it's pretty full back there.
why don't you... -Good idea.
why don't I?
Hey, watch the champagne.
all in.
they don't get out much. - You wanna watch out, you guys.
you'll end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.
you're English.
I love English.
what's your name? - Alfie.
you wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?
no, thanks. I'm trying to quit.
all right. One hit.
merry Christmastime
there's an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."
so, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.
but when a girl of this mind-blowing calibre invites you to a party, it's time to get going and start flowing.
maybe it's the late hour.
maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.
maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.
whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly, and I find myself saying something highly out of character?
I'm renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.
but, say, you could...
...crash at my sublet, if you want.
see you through the holidays.
that sounds inviting.
and so it came to pass, that after all those years, little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas.
the 12 days of Christmas were flying by at a surrealistic pace.
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.
the package was irresistible.
a showstopper with a new-school brand of sexiness.
who wouldn't get off on the way she makes heads turn?
Plus, we have so much in common.
she's sweet, fun, original, exciting, - Adore you.
full of surprises.
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a cracking good bed.
I began to wonder, could this be the one...
...who finally holds my attention?
happy New Year!
in every doomed relationship, there comes what I like to call "the uh-oh moment."
when a certain little something happens, and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end.
and suddenly you stop and you think:
Uh-oh, iceberg ahead.
with Nikki, that was the first of many...
...uh-oh moments.
it began with petty arguments.
followed by random bouts of melancholia.
major highs and manic lows.
this girl never knows when she's had one too many.
and there had been constant displays of erratic, reckless behaviour.
and thank you, no. No, I did not have insurance.
but whenever I begin to feel there's little reason to go on,
I'm reminded that we still have one very major thing in common.
if only she didn't insist on smoking before, after and during.
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
hear that?
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
that's dangerously close to wife-speak to me.
because I'm making something really special for din-din.
Din-din?
I'll call later.
listen, are you sure you don't think that colour's a little bit intense?
I think you're a little bit intense. - Careful, because you've got paint all over your hands.
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...
sorry, baby.
I gotta run.
no, I've gotta run.
I bet that I can make it worth your while to stay.
I'm sure you can. But you know what? I've got that meeting.
haven't I? - Yeah.
you know you're in trouble when a sight like that can't keep you planted.
when I was a boy at St. Alban's Secondary School, the school took us on this cultural trip to observe art at one of the...
one of those big famous London museums.
anyway, when I was there,
I came across this statue of a Greek goddess in marble.
Aphrodi... Aphrodite, something like that.
beautiful, she was.
perfect female form.
chiselled features.
exquisite.
I stood in awe of her.
finally, the teacher calls us all over, and I'm walking past it, and on the way I notice, in the side of this Greek goddess, all these cracks, chips, imperfections.
ruined her for me.
well, that's Nikki.
a beautiful sculpture...
...damaged...
...in a way you don't notice till you get too close.
I lost the signal for a second there.
but I don't know.
it's just a lot of personal stuff going on.
you know what I mean?
Oh, I know. - Welcome, Mr Alfie.
good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope you don't mind me rambling on.
enjoy your evening, sir. -Thank you.
as you can see, the lad's moving up in the world.
it's just that I've got this friend who's, let's say, outstayed his welcome.
absolutely right.
it's a lot tougher getting them out than getting them in. I like that.
you'll never guess who I'm dropping in on now.
I wouldn't have believed it myself a couple of weeks ago.
why don't you just try being honest, and tell your friend that the hotel is under new management and that they have to vacate the premises. You know what I mean.
that kimono does wonders for your decolletage.
big word. - Big decolletage.
why don't we have a drink and you can tell me the rest of your troubles.
instead of me listening to hers. That's a change.
you know, for someone so very young, you're terribly wise.
secret admirer?
one of many.
you would never think of bringing a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?
it would only encourage them.
I'm gonna make us that drink.
what's your poison, sweetheart?
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please. Midleton Rare, if you've got it.
I like dropping a fancy brand name in now and again, let her know she ain't the only one been around.
why not make this an absinthe afternoon?
brilliant.
no idea what she's talking about. -You've had absinthe?
not recently, no. Remind me, what is it again?
the Green Fairy. The French impressionists' liquid drug of choice.
and I got you some of those little egg thingies you like so much.
I mention I like something once, next thing I know,
I get it on a silver platter.
perfect, huh?
kind of pad I plan to earn myself one day.
understated elegance with just a touch of the trendy.
she's a regular fashionista.
you don't have to tell this one which slingbacks go with which frock.
owns her own cosmetics company.
empire, actually.
started out doing facials in a fancy salon.
took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya, put it on the market, and bingo: All this.
this stuff is so illegal.
I smuggled a whole batch of it back from Prague in Listerine bottles.
Oh, I checked out your business plan.
And? - I'm impressed.
you seem surprised. - Not at all.
because underneath all that bravado beats the heart of a guy who's a lot smarter than he thinks he is, but not nearly as cocky as he'd like everybody else to believe.
what are we...? What exactly are we basing this on?
this insight into my personality
that it takes one to know one.
what?
I was just wondering if there's a clever little tattoo artist out there who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."
here's to clever little tattoo artists.
Jesus.
it made me feel all warm going down.
that's my job.
you know what they say.
what do they say?
absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.
Oh, great.
check this out.
have a look at the size of this tub.
she's had two husbands, both croaked, and I have a feeling this was the scene of the crime.
come on, baby, let's get wet.
if she keeps this up, we're gonna be updating that tattoo of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.
remember how little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas?
be careful what you wish for.
there's something else.
dozed off?
Yeah.
I tried waiting up for you.
your meeting ran late, huh? - Very. I'm knackered.
and wet.
but...
...I do want us to have a little chat, Nikki.
okay.
sure.
why don't we talk over a midnight snack.
I made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.
that was your favourite as a young lad, right?
and check the place out, if you please.
your little girl worked her fanny off. - I noticed. It looks brilliant.
really smashing.
so, Nik... - Alfie, I've been thinking.
will you look at these cute little potatoes?
okay. I know I have been a real handful lately.
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot with me feeling displaced...
...and not totally trusting.
sweetie, cutting to the chase.
I am gonna do better.
I promise.
I am gonna take my medication religiously from now on.
and everything, everything is gonna be easy and breezy.
sound good? Honey?
so come, come and sit. A feast awaits.
I already ate, Nik.
of course.
no worries, we'll have leftovers.
I can whip up a little corned beef hash for brunch.
what's the matter, Alfie?
nothing. I just...
I've got a lot on my mind and...
...I'm feeling a bit... - What?
cold? Distant? Remote? What?
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.
everything happened so quickly.
I'm not the best at this sort of thing. - What sort of thing?
I...
...don't know exactly how to say it.
sure you do, Alfie.
you've had plenty of experience dumping girls.
don't worry.
I'm already gone.
strange.
but even when you know it has to end...
...when it finally does...
...you always get that inevitable twinge?
have I done the right thing?
I must admit...
...I do miss the companionship.
Nikki was a showstopper.
but as me ugly old Aunt Gladys used to say, "Looks aren't everything.
I used to think that was a load of bollocks, but just lately I've been thinking...
...maybe the old bat had something.
Julie?
Alfie, hi.
what a surprise.
God, I haven't seen you since... - Yeah.
you look... You look amazing.
Thanks. You too. You look good too.
I'm getting over a cold.
but you're okay otherwise? - I'm fine. I'm always fine.
it's good to see you.
and you.
Hey, you know, I was...
I'm sorry about what happened between us.
and I'm sorry how it all ended up. It wasn't...
it wasn't good.
I felt bad about not seeing Max and about not seeing you.
it's water under the bridge. - Good.
you know...
...I'm wondering...
maybe we...
you know I can never promise anything.
but if you want, if you like, maybe we could see each other again.
it would be okay by me.
it would be more than okay, it would be great.
Alfie, l... - Yeah?
this is Adam.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, how you doing, Adam? - Pretty good.
Adam. -Yeah.
it was great running into you.
you look fantastic. -Thanks.
what time is it? I've gotta go.
I'm late for a meeting. Nice to meet you, Adam.
Julie
Julie - How's Max? - Oh, really good.
will you say hi?
sure. - Or not.
be well.
hello.
hello.
Mrs Wing, is everything...?
wing.
why are you crying?
I'm not crying. Get out.
you sure? - I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see if I could borrow a car.
she leave me.
sorry?
blossom leave me.
Blossom? Is that your wife's name, Blossom?
what I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?
look, mate. Come on, you can win her back.
woo her. Send flowers and chocolates.
write a poem.
that what you do? - Well, actually, no, I've never done that, but it may be a way to go.
what rhyme with Blossom?
I would try "awesome."
okay.
you never cease to amaze.
Hey.
great to see you too, Lon.
I guess I should have rung. Hey, Sam.
well, that would have been a plan.
well, you know, I'm sorry, it was just...
it's nice.
look, Lonette...
this is so uncomfortable, I know. Because...
you don't have to whisper. Marlon's not here.
I really miss you both.
and I just wondered, maybe...
maybe me and you could put it all behind us, pretend like it never happened, and then move forward, you know?
I just...
you know, Alfie...
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.
you two didn't have a baby.
you did have a baby.
no, you were right the first time.
thinking back to that day at the clinic, I remember trying to look in Lon's eyes to see if I could even begin to understand what she was going through, and how she wouldn't look at me.
and I think I knew then.
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.
so classically...
...I said nothing.
I knew there was a good chance the baby could be Marlon's.
at least, I hoped.
this is a lot...
...for me too, Lon.
Marlon stayed.
for now.
is there anything I can do?
what are you gonna do, Alfie?
Hey.
you know, I never...
I never meant... - You never mean to hurt anybody.
but you do, Alfie.
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.
problem was, they were suddenly in short supply.
and I don't remember being in the car. I just... I just... I was stopped.
and I'm crying.
crying for the little one? - I don't know exactly.
maybe for him.
mostly, I think, for me.
and Marlon.
I never had anybody look at me quite like that before.
and believe me, I've had some looks that could kill.
he stood by Lonette. I could've never, ever...
you don't know what you'll do till you really love someone.
well, now what?
you gonna shoehorn yourself into the situation?
no.
you did the only thing you could do. You behaved like a gentleman.
I've never been accused of that before.
don't get all choked up. You also behaved like a scheming, backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.
next time, think before unzipping.
it's all right. You screwed up.
so, what are you gonna do?
run to the bridge?
the question is...
...What's gonna happen with the rest of your life?
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events of the past few weeks have knocked me for a bit of a loop.
all right, all right, all right.
Hello, mate.
and what can we do for you this evening?
how much are one of those? - Five-fifty.
and you'll need to put them in water immediately.
right, I'll have that.
second thought.
actually, this is sort of a special thing.
what's the occasion? - Say again?
proposal? -No. No, no.
well, I do want to extend an offer to maybe have a go at it for a bit, give us a spin, that kind of thing.
I get it. Commitment issues.
tell me what she, or he, is like, and we'll find the appropriate bloom.
well, she is...
you know what, she's adventurous.
Frivole. -And very sexy.
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.
a little mischievous. You know, cheeky?
avalanche, with a touch of mio amore.
and then under it all, she's just...
she's just kind of sweet.
Liz?
Hello? - It's me, my love.
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight. I thought you were working.
I had a cancellation, so I took the night off.
listen, I thought we should get up early, get out of the city, go to the country and see if we can stay -at that B&B you're always on about. - I'd love to, but I can't.
I have an investors' breakfast in the morning.
how about on the weekend? - Brilliant. Better.
all right. I thought you may...
Oh, my God.
no. Alfie.
Oh, what a sweet gesture. - Milady.
they're not out of some plastic bucket. I handpicked, like, every bud.
I can see that. - And apparently, I have a bit of a flair for flower arranging.
I'm impressed.
talk about being blown away. - Good. Mission accomplished.
I like surprising you.
well, you certainly have done that.
all right, then. Well, you're up early, so I'm off.
I'm gonna see you tomorrow night? - Yeah.
when we speak, there's some things...
some thing I really wanna talk to you about.
what, honey?
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect moment, and that's all I'll say.
I'll ring you in the morning.
and, Alfie, thank you for the flowers. They made my evening.
Really?
in that case, maybe I'll stay.
I don't...
no, it's not a good idea.
there's a guy in there, isn't there?
God...
go.
don't do this.
what's he got - Better than me? - Alfie, please.
tell me. Please?
really, I would like to know. What's he got? Tell me.
I want to know what he's got. Please tell me.
come on. Come on. Come on, just tell me.
just tell me, come on.
what's he got better than me?!
he's younger than you.
he's younger than you.
I've gotta admit, I didn't see it coming.
she caught me off-guard, all right.
you couldn't tell, though, could you?
as you've learned by now, I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.
you see, the thing with feelings is they have this quiet way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
like with Liz.
who would've thought, of all the women I've known...
...the one I let my guard down with delivers the knockout punch.
ironic.
calendar word.
Dorie.
Hi. - Hello, Alfie.
I haven't seen you in ages. - Maybe because you stopped calling.
I know. Things were getting a bit too...
don't bother explaining. I'm way past needing excuses.
all right. No, you know what? I want to explain.
what? You had your fill of me?
someone cuter came along? I don't need to hear it, Alfie.
look, Dorie... - Really.
look, Dorie...
what happens with me is...
I don't know, I get...
when it gets too... Not close but something like that,
I start to feel... Not stifled, not trapped, but something like that.
and I... And...
you know? You know what I mean?
did that make...? Did that make any sense?
I think it has to make sense to you more than me at this point.
Yeah, fair enough.
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.
Dorie.
I'm sorry.
good luck, Alfie.
I warned them all from the beginning.
I always said something along the lines of, "I must advise you,"
I am stamped with an invisible warning.
I will not commit. I will never marry.
despite my best efforts, I'm beginning to feel some small cracks in my faux finish.
you know, when I look back on my little life, and all the women I've known...
...I can't help but think about...
...all that they've done for me...
...and how little I've done for them.
how they looked after me, cared for me...
...and I repaid them by never returning the favour.
Yeah.
I used to think I had the best end of the deal.
what have I got? Really?
some money in my pocket.
some nice threads. Fancy car at my disposal.
and I'm single.
unattached. Free as a bird.
I don't depend on nobody.
nobody depends on me.
my life's my own.
but I don't have peace of mind.
and if you don't have that, you've got nothing.
so...
so, what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself.
what's it all about?
you know what I mean?
you're lucky, you know.
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.
I know, I know, I know.
humble digs.
not exactly what you'd call a "panty peeler."
do you know what I mean?
but it suits me just fine.
to be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.
you see, here's my theory:
for most women, if a guy's a good provider and generally a nice chap, six-pack abs really aren't a deal-breaker.
on the flip side, however, even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...
and he will deny it. For us boys, it's all about F.B.B.
face. Boobs. Bum.
I'm just being honest.
it's been said that clothes speak the international language.
and I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fashion whore.
unfortunately, today I've got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit, but that's all right. Gucci. End-of-summer sale.
very understated. And I can easily spice it up with...
what? No, no. I know what you are thinking.
if you ooze masculinity, like some of us do, you have no reason to fear pink. Smashing.
now, in the cologne department, most men overdo it.
americans practically spray it on with a crop-duster.
my rule: Nothing above the neck, though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.
you never know where the day may take you.
almost forgot.
new word for the day.
Ostentatious: The attempt to attract attention to oneself.
who? Me?
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude. I haven't introduced myself.
I'm... -Alfie
there you go. Alfie.
are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?
no, no, no. You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.
you are such a doll, Alfie. But I'm supposed to be on a diet.
Oh, on a diet?
a diet. -You?
Yeah. -Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu, but you should know by now that a full-figured girl like yourself -is every guy's secret fantasy. -Stop it.
so she's a tub of lard. The ship's already sailed, so why not make her feel good about herself, right?
Oh, Lu -Yes, angel
I'm working the night spot, and my apartment is a horror show, so I'm sorry if I keep you up -with the dust-busting at 2 a.m. -Oh, don't you worry.
I'll give it a quick straighten. -Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.
nonsense. I like doing things for you, Alfie.
I'm a blessed man having you in my life.
thank you.
keys are in the usual spot.
now, back home, you're always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money.
so not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.
now, I must admit, I had a second motive.
I'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...
...resided in Manhattan.
and when it comes to shagging birds, it's all about one thing:
location, location, location.
God, I love this city. All right, girls.
just look around. I mean, every one of them, unique, special, like snowflakes.
and with such a plethora...
calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity, well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.
my priorities leaning towards wine, women...
well, actually, that's about it.
wine and women.
although, women and women is always a fun option.
so...
...to live life to the fullest,
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.
I've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.
I think this might just be my favourite position.
I know it was President Kennedy's.
he was such a great leader.
of course, JFK used the old bad-back excuse, but if you ask me, he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion.
what is it about the back of a limo?
obligatory cuddling.
thousand one, thousand two...
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking. I've got a 10: 00 pickup.
you better hurry up. You don't want to keep her waiting.
quite the number, isn't she?
yet, she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months.
six months. I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack.
just look at her. Legs like a racehorse.
perfect yoga bum. I give her my highest grade:
where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?
a movie. -Treasure, please, no, no, no.
stop messing about. You'll ruin my presets.
sorry. -What movie?
I don't know. What's the difference?
the difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he'll be.
it wouldn't matter what I said.
it would never occur to Phil that another man - would ever look twice at me. - Dor, darling, you fishing for a compliment?
no.
you should know by now they only come from me when least expected.
now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.
I don't care if he does.
there's one thing that puts me off marriage: It's married women.
Dorie doesn't know it yet, but you won't be seeing much more of her.
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.
sooner or later, she'll be wanting a little bit more than I'm able to give.
wouldn't it be great if I was going home with you tonight instead of Phil the Pill?
Yeah.
it's definitely time to stage a disappearing act.
so next Tuesday, same time, same place?
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week. I'm booked double shifts.
I'll call you the instant things let up. -Okay.
in the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.
Oh, Dor
your derriere looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.
see?
a compliment when least expected.
what can I say? Happy as a pup with two tails.
and I think I've done old Phil a bit of a favour too.
of course, he'd be the last to see it.
never expect any thanks in this life.
you know what I mean? So Tuesday...
...10: 03 p. m.
do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge, or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?
decisions, decisions...
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit to my semi-regular, quasi, sort of girlfriend.
my sweet Julie.
let me guess. Unexpected last-minute fare.
Yeah. She had me going up and down for hours.
that supposed to be funny? Because it is so very...
not.
Hey!
I'm not kidding, Alfie!
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.
you have a very ostentatious way of showing it.
Yeah, I sure do.
no, darling. Can we hit pause? I just need a second to unwind.
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.
how do you want yours, on the rocks?
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.
no, I'm so totally knackered. I'll make it up to you in the morning.
cross my heart.
but tonight, all I'm good for is a bite to eat, hot bath and a nice long sleep.
you know, this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.
what's that again?
where were you tonight? Really?
you've got to open a restaurant. That's seriously delicious.
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.
Hey.
a little eye contact, please.
we have something here, or am I just a glorified booty call?
Hey.
Hey.
here's what she's really saying:
she wants me to commit. Translation: Become "domestified."
now, it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life.
change your nature, you're a dead man.
chilli, please.
don't get me wrong. She's adorable.
cute? Absolutely. But is it ever enough?
I told you how we men are. We want showstoppers.
and the problem is, Julie hasn't got enough of the superficial things that really matter.
I don't deserve you. -Yeah, that's probably true.
too bad I love you.
Thanks, babe.
Alfie, Alfie... -What?
you're giving me the "Thanks, babe."
you're giving me the "Thanks, baby."
calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!
I know how you feel! - Wait a minute.
you're gonna wake up... -Max.
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?
Yes.
now, lads, learn from my mistake.
never get involved with a single mum.
see, they come with accessories, some of which can be...
...unfortunately, irresistible.
sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.
and women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don't they?
I think that's what Julie was banging on about yesterday.
elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.
this is where I make my reasonably honest living.
standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?
I know. Believe me, it's merely a stepping stone.
currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.
black. Like Lonette's skin...
...which I will never again touch.
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form.
see, Marlon's got a problem.
it's called Lonette.
and very recently, it dumped him.
Oh, dear. Come on, what was it this time?
three a. m. Begging, at her front door.
level of inebriation? -Vomiting.
right. So let me get this straight. You were at her front door, 3 a. m. In the morning, begging and vomiting?
and what, she wasn't charmed by that?
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli in car number two?
I've no idea.
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.
that little chap's name is Wing.
my boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.
wipe that car good. -Owner, that is, till me and Marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...
hello. You miss bird shit.
wing.
he's barking mad.
check out the way he talks to the little woman.
she's given him her best years, cooked his chop suey, helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn't wait to rip off her kimono. And now look at him.
and I'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage?
that's a great figure, man. We swing that loan, cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...
we're gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.
I could've predicted this. See, Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18-month "Where are we going, what are we doing, what's happening here?" crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship. Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.
Marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way.
I fucked up egregiously.
I see you're making the most of that birthday calendar.
by the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back...
...it was too late. - Hey, stranger.
Hey.
Carol.
Carol. Hi, Carol. - Hi.
you look wonderful.
so, Carol, well, it's nice to see you again. You be well.
what's up with that?
put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.
do I even wanna know why? - No. Come on, it would be less than discreet to tell you why.
hair on the arms. Seriously. Long, thick...
what are you talking about? You don't have hair on your arms?
you're looking very lovely tonight. - Thank you.
dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.
classic, isn't it?
now that he can't have her, he thinks he can't live without her.
some people are funny.
Marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation.
maybe... Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.
anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie. Got a lot on my mind.
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate when that happens.
open up, baby. You look seriously beautiful.
not tonight, Alfred. - What's the matter? Tell me.
I don't... I'm just... Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...
I'm just seeing red.
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.
come on, haven't you...? You've tortured him long enough.
Alfie, he should've thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex-girlfriend of his.
those fake-ass, $5 titties.
those are fake? - Hello?
wow, I'm devastated. They've got, like...
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?
begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...
I don't care.
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't forgive and I definitely do not forget.
is okay if I leave now, miss? - Oh, si, Felix.
and hit the lights on your way out, por favor.
I better go.
it's really coming down out there.
Yeah.
and I'm wearing suede.
you're telling the truth. That's brilliant.
okay. I got one. I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.
me neither. - Oh, shit. Okay.
okay. I've never seen a James Bond movie.
you're joking. Not even a Sean Connery?
you serious?
wow, I don't know if that's magic or tragic.
okay. Five ball. My go.
I've never made my own bed. - Oh, bullshit.
no, I repeat, I've never made my own bed.
well, what kind of mama you got?
that's a good question.
let's see. All right.
I got something for you. - All right.
I've never had sex...
I've never had sex with two people in one night.
six-five, your favour.
gotcha.
so, Alfie, what's the most you've had in one night?
we've stopped playing the game, haven't we?
am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?
Driftin' on a memory
ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
loving you
see, if I had that kind of talent...
and a song - Go on, finish your sentence. - If I had that kind of talent, and I looked like you...
and a song ...I would be strutting my stuff - Oh, yeah? - On a stage.
trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when I dropped by tonight.
but then I thought to myself, "You know what?
if this will help her get past her anger towards Marlon,
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?
to do whatever I can to help.
I find that, lately, even lying to myself comes easily.
the next morning, and I can't get last night out of my mind.
try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.
anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot, best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life girlfriend.
Alfie. Alfie.
Alfie! - Shall I pretend I can't hear him?
dude.
Hey! -Too late. Too late.
dude, would you slow down? - Hey, Marly, what's up?
Marly?
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you. You ain't going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night.
down last night? - Dude, don't mess with me.
what happened with Lonette?
have you ever heard the word "knock"?
what went down? - What? Nothing happened.
we had a few shots. - Missus give me silent treatment.
little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.
you keep it up. Keep it up, mate, it'll work.
Alfie, what happened?
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...
I drank a lot last night. - Drunk.
well, I...
I really... I don't remember.
dude, you did something to her. - No.
Oh, yeah, you did. Because she shows up at my house, at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.
she even said that if I needed more time, that she understood completely.
how fucking crazy.
chalk one up for the blokes. Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.
which means he's off scot-free, and so am I.
this is a bloody miracle. That's fantastic. Fantastic.
come on, what did you say to her? - Look, look.
it's all good. - Come on, what did you say?
I asked her to marry me.
you know you're my best man, right?
moral of the story
no good deed goes unpunished.
new word for the day?
resilience:
the ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss.
capacity to spring back.
understand, it's not about replacing Julie.
I just wanna get back to the simple life.
women who mean nothing to me.
so I've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.
Hello, Uta.
now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,
I have to live by some very simple rules.
alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy, which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me.
he said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...
...just remember, somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her.
can I help you, man? -G and T, please.
explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?
I think it's incredibly unfair that it's acceptable for men to be sexually experimental, then with a woman, if she wants to try something... A kiss or a threesome.
you know, that they'd be judged. I wouldn't judge them.
and I think if you two were to kiss, I would... I would just...
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.
although I'm living every guy's Rat Pack fantasy, something feels a bit off.
and throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn't going quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
you carry on without me.
Oh, my loves, I...
I don't know what happened. This is so unlike me.
Yeah, you... You two just...
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.
then, from out of nowhere...
...the unthinkable.
now I really don't get what everyone sees in you.
it just keeps on happening and happening.
or more accurately, not happening and not happening.
this never happens, Uta. Honestly, never.
honestly.
not the word around town...
...peewee.
mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.
Miranda.
the penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.
so I understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction.
I am experiencing a little... A little... A little bit of... What you just said.
not to worry. That's my area of expertise.
so have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?
stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.
well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.
Why? You angry? - No, I'm really not angry.
just, you know, we want different things.
and I can't have you traipsing in and out of Max's life.
you've changed your hair, haven't you?
you have, haven't you? No, you have.
you've changed your hairdo. You cut it?
it looks gorgeous.
Thanks. - How come...?
how come you never had it like that when we were together?
I really gotta go.
well, I guess...
...you need these back.
thank you.
Alfie?
you gonna be okay?
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.
Alrighty, let's take a gander at that penis of yours.
I see.
well.
it seems we have lift-off. - It seems we do.
Wunderschon.
what a relief.
well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy, I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn't I?
well, there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong, so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem -was simply stress-related. -Translation: Julie-related.
like I always say, if they don't get you one way, they'll get you another.
however, - I did feel something a little kooky. - Kooky?
there is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.
I thought I felt a lump...
...on your penis.
but with any luck, it will be nothing.
the words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.
there's something you don't hear every day.
and so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.
a penis biopsy.
I get my test results in three days... Well, five.
five counting the weekend. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
how am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I'm a young man.
shift focus, Alfie. Shift...
let's go, kids. Let's go.
move along, children. Look straight ahead.
come on. Do not look at the man. Look straight ahead.
in the meantime, perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.
Alfie, dear, what's wrong? You look like death warmed over.
no, I've just... I've got a bit of a football injury, that's all,
Mrs Schnitman... Hello, Mrs Liberman.
you two look lovely. Where you going?
shopping. You need anything? - I'm fine.
hello.
can I talk to you for a minute?
ladies, this is my friend Lonette.
she's lovely. Good for you, dating an African-American.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.
don't mind us. We're not here. You kids keep talking.
very nice to meet you. - See you, Mrs Liberman.
shop till you drop, girls.
so how have you been?
I'm pregnant.
it seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.
it's the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.
I offered to face the music with her...
...but she wanted to go it alone.
we both knew that if the baby was born with any white-boy features it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.
not to mention your host for this evening.
but standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.
thinking thoughts like, "Here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know."
your own.
didn't take long.
bloody hell, you're freezing.
how do you feel?
empty.
that night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.
doesn't seem to have worked out that way, does it?
Oh, man.
if everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign.
I should think about making... Making some changes.
possibly.
next week. - Excuse me.
did I just...? Did you just look at me? Did I just notice you turn away?
look, if you know the results to my tests, and they're telling you...
mr Elkins. - Please. Please.
mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.
mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11: 30.
I'm gonna be fine.
I just feel it. -Thank you. Goodbye.
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.
it's all right. Take your time. - I don't have a choice.
I used to pee. Now I trickle.
I'm Joe. What's your name? - Alfie.
so how you doing, Alfie?
hanging in. You? -Shitty.
Yeah, me too. Me too.
I like the bolo tie. - Oh, thanks. I have a collection.
you know, when you're old, you learn to be patient.
Yeah.
used to be I never had time for nothing. Go, go, go.
I know that feeling. - Yeah.
my wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year."
I got too much on my platter.
I always thought I'd have more time.
then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.
yells, "Soup's on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.
just like that.
dead as disco.
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I tried picking up the pieces.
even went to Waikiki alone on the 8-day cruise package she was always yakking about.
couldn't get Evie out of my mind.
there's two things I learned in life, kid:
you find someone to love, and live every day as though it were your last.
she's all yours, Alfie.
enjoy.
you all right, son?
Yeah. I hope so.
look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...
...give me a holler.
you'll never call. - Maybe I will.
all right, good. We'll go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.
damn right.
Thanks, Joe.
Hey.
I'm sorry about Evie.
we...
...weren't all that fond of each other...
...but we were very close.
if you know what I mean. - I think I do.
I've been thinking a lot lately about God and death.
and how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,
I'm really in for it.
but I won't be partying with Lucifer any time soon, because my test results were negative.
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I ruined my Prada lace-ups and I don't care.
don't think I've forgotten my oath to completely change my life, because I haven't.
Carrot-apple with a dash of wheat grass.
Yep.
health is now priority number one.
business plan moves onto the fast track.
if you say so... -Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...
no, I definitely don't want to talk. Okay, hold on, what else have I got?
okay, yeah.
all right, if we must, we must, but...
new slate. New beginning.
what's your name, driver? - Alfie, sir.
wait here, Alfie.
do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?
you got someplace to go? - No, I was just gonna nip off -and get a cup of tea. - Look, why don't you just stay put.
yea or nay?
a definite yea, I think. Really.
stunning. Wouldn't you say so, sir?
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait by the car?
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages.
definite yea?
I think.
with one minor...
may I? -You may.
adjustment.
bullfighter. Another lifetime. Don't ask.
fifty, if she's a day.
but don't they say 50 is the new 40, and is she not living proof?
I mean, have a look. Beautifully preserved.
and cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.
better? - Much.
you are so right to trust Chanel. A pair of hot-pink stilettos, and you're good to go.
well, aren't you Mr Full-Service? - We try.
he's getting a little pissy, isn't he? - Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.
is your husband a lot older than you? - He's not my husband.
he's wearing a wedding ring.
well, I never said he wasn't somebody else's husband.
grab the stuff from the trunk -You got it.
Cheers.
ma'am, if you require my services in the future.
happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.
now that, my friends, is a real woman.
smart and sexy and...
you noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?
makes me think, if a woman like that, of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me, then, perhaps...
perhaps I'm selling myself a bit short.
in a flash,
I have my New Year's resolution.
aim higher.
catastrophic. Doomed.
desolate. Cataclysmic.
bought him a word-of-the-day calendar for Christmas.
big mistake.
holiday season, busiest time of the year.
I try to run a business.
what's the problem, Mr Wing? - Your soul brother.
he quit.
in the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...
...but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.
he said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.
they decided, on the spur of the moment, to move upstate, and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.
somehow Lonette convinced Marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.
and to make matters worse, it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year?
Christmas Eve.
a night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness, anguish, despair.
not a great time to be flying solo.
that's why I'm of the belief couples should never split up between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.
always have a relationship to see you through the holidays. Always.
the downside, of course, being gifts.
personally, I've always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.
not that I've ever actually had a Christmas.
that's a whole other Dickens story.
taxi.
taxi.
excuse me.
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law for me to carry any more than...
thank the Lord.
a Christmas miracle.
all right, hop in.
thanks for saving us. I was freezing my little tush off.
no worries. You know, it's pretty full back there.
why don't you... -Good idea.
why don't I?
Hey, watch the champagne.
all in.
they don't get out much. - You wanna watch out, you guys.
you'll end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.
you're English.
I love English.
what's your name? - Alfie.
you wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?
no, thanks. I'm trying to quit.
all right. One hit.
merry Christmastime
there's an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."
so, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.
but when a girl of this mind-blowing calibre invites you to a party, it's time to get going and start flowing.
maybe it's the late hour.
maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.
maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.
whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly, and I find myself saying something highly out of character?
I'm renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.
but, say, you could...
...crash at my sublet, if you want.
see you through the holidays.
that sounds inviting.
and so it came to pass, that after all those years, little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas.
the 12 days of Christmas were flying by at a surrealistic pace.
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.
the package was irresistible.
a showstopper with a new-school brand of sexiness.
who wouldn't get off on the way she makes heads turn?
Plus, we have so much in common.
she's sweet, fun, original, exciting, - Adore you.
full of surprises.
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a cracking good bed.
I began to wonder, could this be the one...
...who finally holds my attention?
happy New Year!
in every doomed relationship, there comes what I like to call "the uh-oh moment."
when a certain little something happens, and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end.
and suddenly you stop and you think:
Uh-oh, iceberg ahead.
with Nikki, that was the first of many...
...uh-oh moments.
it began with petty arguments.
followed by random bouts of melancholia.
major highs and manic lows.
this girl never knows when she's had one too many.
and there had been constant displays of erratic, reckless behaviour.
and thank you, no. No, I did not have insurance.
but whenever I begin to feel there's little reason to go on,
I'm reminded that we still have one very major thing in common.
if only she didn't insist on smoking before, after and during.
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
hear that?
what time are you gonna be home, honey?
that's dangerously close to wife-speak to me.
because I'm making something really special for din-din.
Din-din?
I'll call later.
listen, are you sure you don't think that colour's a little bit intense?
I think you're a little bit intense. - Careful, because you've got paint all over your hands.
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...
sorry, baby.
I gotta run.
no, I've gotta run.
I bet that I can make it worth your while to stay.
I'm sure you can. But you know what? I've got that meeting.
haven't I? - Yeah.
you know you're in trouble when a sight like that can't keep you planted.
when I was a boy at St. Alban's Secondary School, the school took us on this cultural trip to observe art at one of the...
one of those big famous London museums.
anyway, when I was there,
I came across this statue of a Greek goddess in marble.
Aphrodi... Aphrodite, something like that.
beautiful, she was.
perfect female form.
chiselled features.
exquisite.
I stood in awe of her.
finally, the teacher calls us all over, and I'm walking past it, and on the way I notice, in the side of this Greek goddess, all these cracks, chips, imperfections.
ruined her for me.
well, that's Nikki.
a beautiful sculpture...
...damaged...
...in a way you don't notice till you get too close.
I lost the signal for a second there.
but I don't know.
it's just a lot of personal stuff going on.
you know what I mean?
Oh, I know. - Welcome, Mr Alfie.
good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope you don't mind me rambling on.
enjoy your evening, sir. -Thank you.
as you can see, the lad's moving up in the world.
it's just that I've got this friend who's, let's say, outstayed his welcome.
absolutely right.
it's a lot tougher getting them out than getting them in. I like that.
you'll never guess who I'm dropping in on now.
I wouldn't have believed it myself a couple of weeks ago.
why don't you just try being honest, and tell your friend that the hotel is under new management and that they have to vacate the premises. You know what I mean.
that kimono does wonders for your decolletage.
big word. - Big decolletage.
why don't we have a drink and you can tell me the rest of your troubles.
instead of me listening to hers. That's a change.
you know, for someone so very young, you're terribly wise.
secret admirer?
one of many.
you would never think of bringing a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?
it would only encourage them.
I'm gonna make us that drink.
what's your poison, sweetheart?
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please. Midleton Rare, if you've got it.
I like dropping a fancy brand name in now and again, let her know she ain't the only one been around.
why not make this an absinthe afternoon?
brilliant.
no idea what she's talking about. -You've had absinthe?
not recently, no. Remind me, what is it again?
the Green Fairy. The French impressionists' liquid drug of choice.
and I got you some of those little egg thingies you like so much.
I mention I like something once, next thing I know,
I get it on a silver platter.
perfect, huh?
kind of pad I plan to earn myself one day.
understated elegance with just a touch of the trendy.
she's a regular fashionista.
you don't have to tell this one which slingbacks go with which frock.
owns her own cosmetics company.
empire, actually.
started out doing facials in a fancy salon.
took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya, put it on the market, and bingo: All this.
this stuff is so illegal.
I smuggled a whole batch of it back from Prague in Listerine bottles.
Oh, I checked out your business plan.
And? - I'm impressed.
you seem surprised. - Not at all.
because underneath all that bravado beats the heart of a guy who's a lot smarter than he thinks he is, but not nearly as cocky as he'd like everybody else to believe.
what are we...? What exactly are we basing this on?
this insight into my personality
that it takes one to know one.
what?
I was just wondering if there's a clever little tattoo artist out there who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."
here's to clever little tattoo artists.
Jesus.
it made me feel all warm going down.
that's my job.
you know what they say.
what do they say?
absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.
Oh, great.
check this out.
have a look at the size of this tub.
she's had two husbands, both croaked, and I have a feeling this was the scene of the crime.
come on, baby, let's get wet.
if she keeps this up, we're gonna be updating that tattoo of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.
remember how little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas?
be careful what you wish for.
there's something else.
dozed off?
Yeah.
I tried waiting up for you.
your meeting ran late, huh? - Very. I'm knackered.
and wet.
but...
...I do want us to have a little chat, Nikki.
okay.
sure.
why don't we talk over a midnight snack.
I made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.
that was your favourite as a young lad, right?
and check the place out, if you please.
your little girl worked her fanny off. - I noticed. It looks brilliant.
really smashing.
so, Nik... - Alfie, I've been thinking.
will you look at these cute little potatoes?
okay. I know I have been a real handful lately.
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot with me feeling displaced...
...and not totally trusting.
sweetie, cutting to the chase.
I am gonna do better.
I promise.
I am gonna take my medication religiously from now on.
and everything, everything is gonna be easy and breezy.
sound good? Honey?
so come, come and sit. A feast awaits.
I already ate, Nik.
of course.
no worries, we'll have leftovers.
I can whip up a little corned beef hash for brunch.
what's the matter, Alfie?
nothing. I just...
I've got a lot on my mind and...
...I'm feeling a bit... - What?
cold? Distant? Remote? What?
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.
everything happened so quickly.
I'm not the best at this sort of thing. - What sort of thing?
I...
...don't know exactly how to say it.
sure you do, Alfie.
you've had plenty of experience dumping girls.
don't worry.
I'm already gone.
strange.
but even when you know it has to end...
...when it finally does...
...you always get that inevitable twinge?
have I done the right thing?
I must admit...
...I do miss the companionship.
Nikki was a showstopper.
but as me ugly old Aunt Gladys used to say, "Looks aren't everything.
I used to think that was a load of bollocks, but just lately I've been thinking...
...maybe the old bat had something.
Julie?
Alfie, hi.
what a surprise.
God, I haven't seen you since... - Yeah.
you look... You look amazing.
Thanks. You too. You look good too.
I'm getting over a cold.
but you're okay otherwise? - I'm fine. I'm always fine.
it's good to see you.
and you.
Hey, you know, I was...
I'm sorry about what happened between us.
and I'm sorry how it all ended up. It wasn't...
it wasn't good.
I felt bad about not seeing Max and about not seeing you.
it's water under the bridge. - Good.
you know...
...I'm wondering...
maybe we...
you know I can never promise anything.
but if you want, if you like, maybe we could see each other again.
it would be okay by me.
it would be more than okay, it would be great.
Alfie, l... - Yeah?
this is Adam.
Hey, how are you?
Hey, how you doing, Adam? - Pretty good.
Adam. -Yeah.
it was great running into you.
you look fantastic. -Thanks.
what time is it? I've gotta go.
I'm late for a meeting. Nice to meet you, Adam.
Julie
Julie - How's Max? - Oh, really good.
will you say hi?
sure. - Or not.
be well.
hello.
hello.
Mrs Wing, is everything...?
wing.
why are you crying?
I'm not crying. Get out.
you sure? - I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see if I could borrow a car.
she leave me.
sorry?
blossom leave me.
Blossom? Is that your wife's name, Blossom?
what I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?
look, mate. Come on, you can win her back.
woo her. Send flowers and chocolates.
write a poem.
that what you do? - Well, actually, no, I've never done that, but it may be a way to go.
what rhyme with Blossom?
I would try "awesome."
okay.
you never cease to amaze.
Hey.
great to see you too, Lon.
I guess I should have rung. Hey, Sam.
well, that would have been a plan.
well, you know, I'm sorry, it was just...
it's nice.
look, Lonette...
this is so uncomfortable, I know. Because...
you don't have to whisper. Marlon's not here.
I really miss you both.
and I just wondered, maybe...
maybe me and you could put it all behind us, pretend like it never happened, and then move forward, you know?
I just...
you know, Alfie...
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.
you two didn't have a baby.
you did have a baby.
no, you were right the first time.
thinking back to that day at the clinic, I remember trying to look in Lon's eyes to see if I could even begin to understand what she was going through, and how she wouldn't look at me.
and I think I knew then.
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.
so classically...
...I said nothing.
I knew there was a good chance the baby could be Marlon's.
at least, I hoped.
this is a lot...
...for me too, Lon.
Marlon stayed.
for now.
is there anything I can do?
what are you gonna do, Alfie?
Hey.
you know, I never...
I never meant... - You never mean to hurt anybody.
but you do, Alfie.
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.
problem was, they were suddenly in short supply.
and I don't remember being in the car. I just... I just... I was stopped.
and I'm crying.
crying for the little one? - I don't know exactly.
maybe for him.
mostly, I think, for me.
and Marlon.
I never had anybody look at me quite like that before.
and believe me, I've had some looks that could kill.
he stood by Lonette. I could've never, ever...
you don't know what you'll do till you really love someone.
well, now what?
you gonna shoehorn yourself into the situation?
no.
you did the only thing you could do. You behaved like a gentleman.
I've never been accused of that before.
don't get all choked up. You also behaved like a scheming, backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.
next time, think before unzipping.
it's all right. You screwed up.
so, what are you gonna do?
run to the bridge?
the question is...
...What's gonna happen with the rest of your life?
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events of the past few weeks have knocked me for a bit of a loop.
all right, all right, all right.
Hello, mate.
and what can we do for you this evening?
how much are one of those? - Five-fifty.
and you'll need to put them in water immediately.
right, I'll have that.
second thought.
actually, this is sort of a special thing.
what's the occasion? - Say again?
proposal? -No. No, no.
well, I do want to extend an offer to maybe have a go at it for a bit, give us a spin, that kind of thing.
I get it. Commitment issues.
tell me what she, or he, is like, and we'll find the appropriate bloom.
well, she is...
you know what, she's adventurous.
Frivole. -And very sexy.
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.
a little mischievous. You know, cheeky?
avalanche, with a touch of mio amore.
and then under it all, she's just...
she's just kind of sweet.
Liz?
Hello? - It's me, my love.
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight. I thought you were working.
I had a cancellation, so I took the night off.
listen, I thought we should get up early, get out of the city, go to the country and see if we can stay -at that B&B you're always on about. - I'd love to, but I can't.
I have an investors' breakfast in the morning.
how about on the weekend? - Brilliant. Better.
all right. I thought you may...
Oh, my God.
no. Alfie.
Oh, what a sweet gesture. - Milady.
they're not out of some plastic bucket. I handpicked, like, every bud.
I can see that. - And apparently, I have a bit of a flair for flower arranging.
I'm impressed.
talk about being blown away. - Good. Mission accomplished.
I like surprising you.
well, you certainly have done that.
all right, then. Well, you're up early, so I'm off.
I'm gonna see you tomorrow night? - Yeah.
when we speak, there's some things...
some thing I really wanna talk to you about.
what, honey?
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect moment, and that's all I'll say.
I'll ring you in the morning.
and, Alfie, thank you for the flowers. They made my evening.
Really?
in that case, maybe I'll stay.
I don't...
no, it's not a good idea.
there's a guy in there, isn't there?
God...
go.
don't do this.
what's he got - Better than me? - Alfie, please.
tell me. Please?
really, I would like to know. What's he got? Tell me.
I want to know what he's got. Please tell me.
come on. Come on. Come on, just tell me.
just tell me, come on.
what's he got better than me?!
he's younger than you.
he's younger than you.
I've gotta admit, I didn't see it coming.
she caught me off-guard, all right.
you couldn't tell, though, could you?
as you've learned by now, I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.
you see, the thing with feelings is they have this quiet way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
like with Liz.
who would've thought, of all the women I've known...
...the one I let my guard down with delivers the knockout punch.
ironic.
calendar word.
Dorie.
Hi. - Hello, Alfie.
I haven't seen you in ages. - Maybe because you stopped calling.
I know. Things were getting a bit too...
don't bother explaining. I'm way past needing excuses.
all right. No, you know what? I want to explain.
what? You had your fill of me?
someone cuter came along? I don't need to hear it, Alfie.
look, Dorie... - Really.
look, Dorie...
what happens with me is...
I don't know, I get...
when it gets too... Not close but something like that,
I start to feel... Not stifled, not trapped, but something like that.
and I... And...
you know? You know what I mean?
did that make...? Did that make any sense?
I think it has to make sense to you more than me at this point.
Yeah, fair enough.
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.
Dorie.
I'm sorry.
good luck, Alfie.
I warned them all from the beginning.
I always said something along the lines of, "I must advise you,"
I am stamped with an invisible warning.
I will not commit. I will never marry.
despite my best efforts, I'm beginning to feel some small cracks in my faux finish.
you know, when I look back on my little life, and all the women I've known...
...I can't help but think about...
...all that they've done for me...
...and how little I've done for them.
how they looked after me, cared for me...
...and I repaid them by never returning the favour.
Yeah.
I used to think I had the best end of the deal.
what have I got? Really?
some money in my pocket.
some nice threads. Fancy car at my disposal.
and I'm single.
unattached. Free as a bird.
I don't depend on nobody.
nobody depends on me.
my life's my own.
but I don't have peace of mind.
and if you don't have that, you've got nothing.
so...
so, what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself.
what's it all about?
you know what I mean?
[ man ] When I was a lad, a journey down the rivers of England was a truly blithe experience.
as Wordsworth has it.
brook lime and flag iris, plantain and marsh marigolds rioted on the banks.
and kingfishers swooped and darted about, their shadows racing over the brown trout.
well, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm happy to be able to tell you...
that these ravishing sights...
will be restored to us again in the near future, thanks to the diligent efforts of your government and your local authority.
all the water above this point will soon be clear.
clear of industrial effluent.
clear of detergents.
clear of the waste products of our society, with which for so long we have poisoned our rivers and canals.
let us rejoice...
that pollution will soon be banished from the waters of this river, and that there will soon be no
look ! what is it ?
it's a woman !
what's that 'round her neck ?
she's been strangled !
looks like a tie. Yes, it's a tie, all right. Another necktie murder.
come on. Move out of the way.
please come away from here, Sir George.
it's another necktie murder. What are the police doing about it ?
why can't they find him ? he's a regular Jack the Ripper.
not on your life. He used to carve 'em up.
sent a bird's kidney to Scotland Yard once, wrapped in a bit of violet writing paper.
that'll do. I'm sure the lady doesn't want to hear more. Or was it a bit of a liver ?
I say, it's not my club tie, is it ?
[ man ] Cheers, Squadron Leader.
chin, Chin. Good morning.
it may come as something of a surprise to you, Blaney, but in this pub we sell liquor, we don't give it away.
still less do we expect our employees to steal it. I was going to pay for it.
Yeah, I'm sure you were. That's the last drink you're gettin' on this house. Get out.
I told you I was going to pay for it. I always pay for my drinks.
even for your watered-down gin.
don't come the innocent with me, you bastard!
my stocks have been well down this past month. - Watch what you're saying !
what, you're a thief? - What's going on ?
our friend here says that I've been pinching his booze.
ridiculous ! he always pays. How would you know ?
I work with him, don't I ? and what else ?
what's that mean ? keep out of this, Babs. Come on, Blaney, outside.
you're fired. You can't do that. He never stole nothing in his life.
he puts the money in the till. I've seen him.
a thief or a boozer, it's all the same to me. I don't need either one as a barman, apart from the fact that half the time he's pulling your tits instead of pulling pints.
he can't keep his hands off you. The customers are always talking about it.
what about you ? always fingering me.
keep your lying mouth shut, Babs, or you can get out as well.
I'm off. Keep the change !
I'll send for my things later.
just a minute !
there's a little matter of ten pounds I advanced you on your salary.
are you planning to steal that as well ?
there you are.
you know what to do with them.
you shouldn't let him talk to you like that. I know.
what are you gonna do, luv ? I don't know.
another pub perhaps. Are you all right ?
you just gave him back the ten quid you borrowed. I had to.
he didn't think I had it. Don't worry, I've got a bit left.
this is Covent Garden, not the garden of love. How about starting work ?
Oh, get stuffed !
look after yourself. I'll call you.
Thanks, guv.
Hello, Dick. Hello, Bob.
I was just coming over for a quick one.
why aren't you back there polishing the sausages or watering the gin, or whatever it is you do there before opening time ?
I have just been given the push.
what for ? you weren't pissing in the beer again ?
Forsythe and I had a set-to. Oh, him.
you duffed him up I hope. He's a bastard.
from squadron leader to barman in one easy lesson ! he wouldn't leave it alone.
he's the boss' brother-in-law, isn't he ?
Forsythe ? I think so.
Brother-in-laws are the worst.
or should I say, "brothers-in-law" ?
what are you gonna do now ? - I haven't decided yet.
Thanks.
george !
that's the last one. Thanks, Mr. Rusk.
why don't you go have a chat with your ex ? she's doin' all right, isn't she ?
I haven't seen her for ages, as you know.
well, as I say, you can always rely on me.
you're all right for a few quid ? Yes. Thanks all the same.
cause if you're not-- No, no. Really. I just got paid.
well... have some grapes.
here you are. I'll get you a box.
finest muscats, fresh in this morning.
take one of these back to your girlfriend Babs.
get her to peel you one. "Beulah, peel me a grape."
that's what my ol' mum used to say when I was a kid.
at least you won't starve to death.
are you sure you don't need a few bob ? no, I'm okay.
well, you don't look okay. Anything else the matter ?
no. What should be ? I don't know.
remember, anything I can do, anytime, it's a pleasure. Ta.
it won't be the same in the Old Globe now.
well, Babs is still there. Yeah, that's true.
and she's prettier than you. A matter of opinion.
bye now. Wait a minute. Give us your paper.
here you are. This will make you a fortune.
this afternoon in the 3: 00, Coming Up.
never been out before, but very well-fancied at home.
this is a four-horse race, and the other three have all won before.
so she'll start about twenty to one, maybe more. Twenty to one ?
put your word on it. She can't lose.
a little birdie told me, and my little birdies are reliable. Thanks again, Bob.
anytime. Don't forget, Bob's your uncle. Good morning, Mr. Rusk.
Hello, Sergeant. What's new ?
not much. This necktie fellow's giving them a bit of a headache, though.
can't seem to get a line on him.
have you tried advertising ? Oh, very funny ! you're one for the birds.
ask 'em all if they've ever had a near miss with a bloke like that, would you ?
or if any of their girlfriends have. Sure.
mind you, half of them haven't got their heads screwed on right, let alone knowing when they've been screwed off.
have you met my friend Dick B
funny fella.
don't worry, Sergeant. I'll put the word about. Thanks, Mr. Rusk.
a large brandy.
What're you gonna have, Doctor ? a pint and a morsel of cheese'll do me fine.
let me order us a hot lunch. We've plenty of time.
Hello, Mr. Usher. What's good today, Maisie ?
stick to the shepherd's. I would.
right. That's two shepherd's pies, please.
and two pints.
I see our necktie murderer's been up to it again.
I saw the newspaper headlines as we came away from the court. Mmm.
I wouldn't envy the lot of any medical man giving evidence at that trial.
why not ? surely it's easier in these days...of legally diminished responsibility.
in many cases you may be right.
but not here.
the man who's killing these women is a criminal, sexual psychopath.
and the legal profession has never really known how to treat them.
[ doctor ] I suppose you could call them social misfits.
we were just talking about the tie murderer, Maisie.
you better watch out. He rapes 'em first, doesn't he ?
Yes, I believe he does.
I suppose it's nice to know every cloud has a silver lining.
Oh ! [ men Chuckle ]
on the surface, in casual conversation...
they appear as ordinary, likable adult fellows.
but emotionally they remain as dangerous children, whose conduct may revert to a primitive, subhuman level at any moment.
large brandy. You mean they'll kill at any time, just as the mood takes them ? exactly.
and, being governed by the pleasure principle, they're particularly dangerous when their desires are being frustrated.
are you deaf? I distinctly said a large brandy.
there's scarcely enough in that to cover the bottom. Actually, make it a triple.
I wonder if the police have got any sort of line on this fellow.
Oh, I shouldn't think so.
with psychopaths there's usually no linking motive. Let's hope he slips up soon.
in one way, I rather hope he doesn't.
well, we haven't had a good, juicy series of sex murders since Christie.
and they're so good for the tourist trade.
foreigners somehow expect the squares of London to be fog-wreathed, full of hansom cabs and littered with ripped whores, don't you think ?
Hey, Dick! What about Coming Up then ?
no, I'm afraid I haven't any time. Thanks all the same.
no, Coming Up, the horse. It won by a mile.
twenty to one! What did I tell you ?
made a fortune. Thanks a lot. Anytime.
Hey, wait a minute !
this is my ma. Ma, meet Dick Blaney, the best pilot who ever pulled a pint of beer.
Hello, Mrs. Rusk. - Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
she lives down in Kent, in the Garden of England !
still got the grapes then ?
Oh, yeah. Keep 'em for later.
you tell her to take the pips out. They're bad for the appendix.
ta-ta ! Bye. Thanks again for the tip.
I told you, Bob's your uncle.
twenty to one !
twenty to bloody one ! christ ! dammit to hell !
well, my dears,
I'm sure I can say on behalf of Mrs. Blaney as well as myself, that it's moments like this that make all our efforts here worthwhile.
you mean, you just don't do it for the money ? [ laughing ]
[ woman ] Mrs. Davisson, this is a business, and financial considerations prevail.
but our ultimate satisfaction is the making happy of two lonely people.
nice of you, Miss Barling. Keep up the good work !
well, it's up to us now, I guess, eh ?
Yes. And good-bye, Mr. Salt.
Bye, Miss Barling. Thank you.
it's been our pleasure. And I know you'll both be very happy.
after all, I know you're both mad about beekeeping.
and there's nothing like a shared interest. I'm sure we will be.
come on, Neville. Best foot forward.
[ Neville ] I suppose we should go straight and get the marriage license, my dear.
what's your rush ?
let's go to my place first.
did you know, Neville, that my late husband, Mr. Davisson, was up at 5: 30 every morning of his life ?
by the time he brought me my cup of tea, which he did punctually at 9: 1 5, he would've cleaned the whole house; and he was so quiet about it, that in 1 4 years, he never woke me once.
not once !
Oh, a neat man, was he, then ?
he liked a tidy place. So do I, come to that.
dandruff. We'll have to get you something for that.
afternoon.
you're new here, aren't you ?
I've been here for over a year now. What can I do for you ?
you can inform Mrs. Blaney...
that one of her less successful exercises in matrimony has come to see her.
and who shall I say is calling ? Mr. Blaney.
or if you preferred it, ex-Squadron Leader Blaney, late of the R. A. F. and Mrs. Blaney's matrimonial bed.
I see. Is Mrs. Blaney expecting you ?
Mrs. Blaney, there's a Mr. Blaney to see you.
Mr. Blaney ? send him in, will you please, Monica ?
Hello, Brenda.
Hello, Richard.
what are you doing here ?
I just thought I'd call around.
well, come in. Take a seat. Thanks.
it's good to see you.
you too. You look fine.
I'll be with you in a minute. I've got to finish writing up a few notes.
how is everything, Brenda ?
you making a fortune ? things are going very well.
streets of London thronged with lonely hearts beating a path to your door ?
that's it.
I'm amazed that in an age where practically everybody considers marriage is hell...
that you can find any clients. If you've just come to insult me
I'm not insulting you, for Christ's sake ! - Please lower your voice.
why ? I don't care if Vinegar Joe out there does hear me.
why don't you get her married off, by the way ?
preferably to a 700-pound Japanese wrestler.
that should iron out some of her creases a little.
Monica, dear, it's nearly 4: 30.
why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off?
I'm sure there's some shopping you'd like to do.
well, thank you, Mrs. Blaney, if you're sure you don't need me.
I'm quite sure, thank you. Good night.
[ Brenda ] Why do you always come to see me when you've had too much to drink ?
[ Blaney] I don't always come to see you when I've had too much to drink.
I don't always come to see you. I haven't seen you for over a year.
you were half seas over then, and violent.
I do hope we're not going to have a repeat of that. Me violent ?
don't be bloody ridiculous.
would I raise a hand to the goddess of love ?
what Brenda Blaney brings together let no man put asunder !
I didn't say you were violent to me.
but you certainly acted the fool and threw the furniture about a bit.
just look at the state you're in !
really ! Oh, leave me alone.
bachelors are supposed to be untidy, aren't they ?
I thought tidiness was most women's dowry, or don't you preach that here ?
Oh, we are bitter today.
what's the matter ? I'm sorry.
I had a bad day, that's all. I lost my job.
how ?
I got fired, that's how. What do you think, I mislaid it ?
for pinching a glass of brandy.
my employer thought I wasn't going to put the money in the till.
till ?
I was working, until this morning, as a barman.
and another thing.
I was given a very good horse by a great friend of mine, one Bob Rusk.
it came in at twenty to one, and I didn't have enough cash on me to back it.
I'm sorry.
well, these things always go in threes.
I wonder what the rest of the day has in store.
dinner with me, I hope.
that, of course, would be delightful, but
I mean, of course, on me. We'll go to my club.
but I must finish these letters first.
here's the address, in case you've forgotten it.
how will it be if we meet there 'round about 7: 30 ?
fine.
thanks for a lovely evening. It was great. I mean that.
thanks for joining me.
it was a damn sight better than the leftovers at the Globe, not that I'm in for more of those.
you ought to get married again, Richard.
Oh, no. You ought to know I'm no good at it. How long did we have ?
nine years, was it ? ten.
Ah, ten years. It was a good job you got out when you did.
I don't know. I suppose I was lucky the agency worked out for me.
what you mean is, you're lucky you haven't had to rely on me these past two years.
I didn't say that. - But you meant it.
I suppose some people are good at organization and others aren't.
that's all I meant. And I'm not, I suppose.
rubbish ! you know what filthy luck I had.
was it my fault that the roadhouse didn't go ?
it was going fine 'til they opened the bloody motorway. I know.
was it my fault the council tore down the riding stables ?
I know. I know life can be very unfair.
but you never used to be sorry for yourself.
Where's the Richard Blaney I married? Huh !
richard Blaney, D. F.C. Do you remember the citation ?
for inspiring leadership, skill...
and tenacity of purpose.
you divorced him. That's what happened to him.
tell me, what sort of skill do you need to deal with shopkeepers...
and interfering bureaucrats ? Shh. Everyone's listening.
let them. I'll bet they've never had to tear down their livelihood with their own hands.
it's all right for you. You just go and build it up somewhere else.
you're like that. You're good at business.
I'll bet they're all good at business here.
I'll bet you're making a fortune out of that agency.
and why not ? if you can't make love, sell it.
the respectable kind, of course. The married kind!
now look what you've done.
Oh, sir. Let me help you. Leave me alone !
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
come on. We'd better go.
will you be all right ?
you did say you hadn't enough money to put on that horse.
don't worry. You've done enough for one day.
you had a coat too, didn't you ? Yeah. That one there.
mine's the pink one.
no, no, no. That's not allowed.
rules of the club.
thank you.
it's all right, Richard. I've got it here. Thank you.
so, this is it, huh ?
can I come in ? I'd like to see where you live.
go along now. Run along home. It's late.
you call this late ? it's late enough for a working girl.
come on, Brenda. I won't be long, I promise.
all right, but only for a few minutes, mind.
okay, thanks. I won't need you.
it just fell out of your pocket onto the floor.
and I was just putting it back... when you were asleep.
it sort of jerked out like on the floor.
I was putting 'em in quiet like so as not to waken you.
keep your hands out of my pockets, or I'll break your arms !
honestly, there's nothing I detest more than someone taking liberties...
with a fine gentleman like yourself.
Oh, it's you again, Mr. Robinson.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
I'm having my lunch just now.
if you want an appointment, perhaps you'll be good enough to see my secretary.
by the way, how did you get in ? no problem, really.
just a question of using your head.
I waited in the courtyard 'til I saw her go out to lunch.
it all seems a bit elaborate. Yeah, perhaps, but
you're the one I wanted to see.
I thought I'd already explained to you that we cannot help you.
Oh, come on now. I know that you can be most helpful...
when you try. Look, Mr. Robinson, you want women of a specific type.
how shall I put it ?
certain peculiarities appeal to you, and you need women to submit to them.
here we have, I'm afraid, a very normal clientele.
as I say, we can do nothing for you.
now if you'll kindly let me get on with my lunch.
I don't think you're really trying your best for me.
I mean, if you can fix up a lot of idiots, then why not me ? hmm ?
I've explained. You're different.
how so ?
I have my good points.
I like flowers...and fruit.
people like me.
I've got things to give.
I'm sorry.
I thought matrimonial agencies were supposed to bring people together ?
not people like you.
somehow I don't think our clients would appreciate...
your conception of a loving relationship.
I get on with all sorts of people.
good. Then you don't need us.
you're not the only matrimonial agency, you know. - Then go elsewhere.
not that any reputable agency would service you. I've been elsewhere.
but... this one, for me, is the best...
because... I like you.
you're... my type of woman.
don't be ridiculous. I'm serious.
I respect a woman like you, and I know how to treat you as well.
you know, in my trade we have a saying.
we put it on the fruit.
don't squeeze the goods 'til they're yours.
now, that's me.
I would never do that.
you know that, don't you ?
excuse me. I've just remembered a call I've got to make.
there's no need to call the police.
what made you think I was going to call the police ?
just intuition, I suppose.
Oh ! english ?
Yeah, of course it is.
that's a very frugal lunch you've got there.
Frugal...
and mean.
certainly not enough to support a lady with your opulent figure.
rather too opulent, I'm afraid, these days; hence the frugality.
why don't you come out and have a slap-up lunch with me ?
I really can't leave the office just now.
I'd buy you the best lunch in town. No, I c
all right. It's a deal.
you mean it ? you'll come and have lunch with me ? of course.
just let me wash my hands. Aah !
I thought we were going to lunch. Yes, of course we're going to lunch.
afterwards.
all right. I know what you want, but not here.
let's go back to my place. But this is your place.
you've got nothing to worry about here.
my secretary may come back in a minute. Really ?
how long do you give her to eat her frugal lunch ? fifteen minutes.
she may be here any minute.
the outside door is locked.
she's got her own key.
I don't believe you.
do you know what happens to wicked girls who tell wicked lies ?
don't worry. Don't worry.
you've got nothing to worry about.
leave me alone. Please !
T-Take the money out of my bag, but please, leave me alone.
in my bag there's, there's enough money there to buy any woman you want. It's yours.
take it ! just take it !
I don't buy women. It's you I want. You're my type.
you are. Yes.
you are my type of woman.
l-let me answer the telephone.
if you don't, the caller will come here in person.
I told you, I locked the outer door. We won't be disturbed.
[ sobbing ] Oh, God !
[ ringing Continues ] Leave me alone.
all right. All right, I won't struggle.
but I like you to struggle. A lot of women like to struggle.
please, don't tear my dress.
I'll take it off if you like.
lovely.
lovely.
lovely.
thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night,
lovely. Nor for the arrow which flieth by day.
lovely. Nor for the pestilence which walketh in darkness.
lovely! Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
lovely. He shall give His angels charge over thee...
to guard thee in all thy ways. Lovely!
lovely !
[ angrily ] Lovely !
[ shouting ] Lovely!
lovely.
you... bitch !
women ! they're all the same.
they are.
I'll show you.
my God ! the tie !
dear Jesus, help me. Help me.
[ knocking ] Hello ?
anyone there ?
Brenda, it's Richard.
hello.
Hello, Globe ? may I speak to Barbara Milligan ?
is that you, Blaney ? listen, you've got a bloody nerve...ringin'up here in my busiest time.
I don't know where she is. She's probably in the other bar.
I most certainly will not nip 'round and fetch her. She's busy.
Hello, Dickie. Is that you ? get a move on. It's not a lonely hearts club.
here, guv. Give us a pint. Yeah ?
I'm fine. How are you ?
I'm okay. Look, I need my things, but I don't particularly fancy meeting Forsythe.
do you think you could pack 'em, put 'em in my bag and meet me this afternoon ?
are you sure ? it'd be great if you could, but I don't want to mess things up for you.
don't worry. It's my half day today. Where shall I meet you ?
I'll be opposite the Lester Square Odeon, 4: 00. Okay ?
okay, at 4: 00. I've gotta run now. Bye.
don't start lending him money. You'll never get it back. Mind your own business.
he's no good for you, Babs. And you are ?
Hey, guv ! take a whiff of this !
how far from here was the place you had lunch, Miss Barling ?
about five or ten minutes.
[ police Sergeant ] Good afternoon, sir.
good afternoon, one and all. This is Miss Barling, sir.
Sgt. Spearman, would you do the honors ? certainly, sir.
the murdered woman is a Mrs. Brenda Blaney.
she ran this business here, sir, and was found by her secretary, Miss Barling, on her return from lunch at approximately 2: 00, sir.
afternoon. Afternoon, sir.
has Miss Barling any ideas ? she certainly has.
she says she saw the murdered woman's ex-husband...
leaving the building just as she came back, sir.
I saw him clear as day. It was Blaney, all right.
he came out of the door downstairs and walked down the alley.
the beast !
I'm sorry, Miss Barling. I must press you.
are you sure it was Mr. Blaney ?
absolutely ! I'd know him anywhere.
you see, he came here yesterday afternoon, and it was perfectly horrid.
he'd been drinking and insisted on seeing Mrs. Blaney.
and did he see her ? Yes. She'd never turn anyone away, not even him.
what happened ? Oh, I don't know.
they started having a row almost immediately. Mrs. Blaney came out and said I might go.
quite naturally I didn't want to embarrass her, so I left.
as I did so, I couldn't help overhearing that Mr. Blaney was becoming very violent, both in his language and his behavior.
did he strike Mrs. Blaney ? Yes, I think so.
there was the sound of a blow. I see.
miss Barling, could you describe Mr. Blaney for us ?
what he looked like, what he was wearing and so on.
Yes, I think I can.
he was a man in his thirties, about an inch or so under six foot tall.
he had dark hair, green eyes and a mustache.
I estimate his weight at about 155 pounds.
he was wearing a rather old-fashioned jacket...
with leather patches on the shoulders and elbows.
in my opinion, it was quite unsuitable for London.
he was also carrying a raincoat.
that's an extraordinarily precise description, Miss Barling.
in my job I've learned to keep a sharp eye on men, Inspector.
excuse me.
I found this handbag on the desk, and there's no sign of any money.
that doesn't make sense. I cashed a check for 50 pounds for her yesterday lunchtime.
it makes perfect sense to me. Where does she keep her money in this bag ?
sometimes she zips it in the pocket. Mmm.
have this face powder identified, will you, Sergeant ?
there might be some on the stolen money. We might be lucky.
all right, sir.
what about fingerprints ? with all the clowns who come in here, there'll be dozens.
Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.
Hey, wait a moment. How can you afford a hotel ?
I'll tell you later. Okay.
so, what you been up to, Dick ? [ sighs ] Well, last night...
I allowed myself to be pampered by the handmaidens of a Salvation Army hostel.
I tell you, after mixing with some of the types in there, one's clothing needs fumigation.
smell that. Whew !
you mean you slept there ? yeah... spasmodically.
what ? with all the old men ? Yes, that's it.
we had a high old time. The conversation was mature, the Red Biddy flowed down the odd throats, and the good fellowship of the open road prevailed.
red Biddy. What's that ? blended red wine.
half vino, half mentholated spirits.
but why, Dick ? reasonable terms for bachelors, that's why.
thirty pence a night, in fact. I don't understand.
how can you afford the Coburg ?
well, I managed to get some money.
since last night ? Yeah.
I, uh, I collected an old debt. That was lucky.
Yeah.
okay.
thank you.
double room, please. What are you up to ? not here !
Shh. Would that be with two singles, or the, uh, matrimonial-size bed ?
the mat-- Double bed.
please. Yes. I see.
Three-two-two should suit you. The Cupid Room.
really ? Yes. It's very cozy.
if you'll just sign the register. Yes, of course.
[ sighs ] Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wilde.
now, look here, Dick Blaney ! - Oscar, if you don't mind.
will you stop playing games ? I can't possibly-- - [ Clerk ] Excuse me.
that'll be ten pounds, plus service charge of two pounds.
perhaps you'd care to settle now ?
there we are. Thank you.
room, please ? Three-two-two, Bertie.
follow me, please.
you've got 322. That's nice.
Yes. The Cupid Room, I think she called it.
love's little arrows have struck quite a few hearts in there, sir, I can tell you.
Oh, yeah.
can I get you anything from the pharmacy, sir ? no, thank you.
sir. Thank you, sir.
[ Blaney ] Hey! Sir ?
hang on. Can you send this to the cleaners for me ?
certainly, sir. And this. Tell them that it's urgent.
and, uh, might as well take the other half as well.
tell them that I want them sprayed.
sprayed, sir ? with what ?
D. D. T. my good man. What else ? sir ?
death to the lurking roach, Porter. Confusion to the insidious louse.
get 'em cleaned and pressed, eh ? Yes, sir.
Oh, dear !
Hey, Glad, take a look at this.
Oh ! Oh, that poor woman.
it's the jacket, Glad, I'm talkin' about. The jacket ! see what it says ?
the police are anxious to interview a man seen leaving the matrimonial agency about the time of the murder.
when last seen he was wearing a tweed jacket with leather patches on the shoulders and elbows and carrying a raincoat.
that's a funny way to patch a jacket. It's meant to be like that !
the party in 322 was wearin' it.
do you mean-- Do you mean Mr. Oscar Wilde ?
that's not his real name, silly. Oscar Wilde, indeed !
he's the fellow the police are looking for.
don't you see ? he's the necktie murderer.
and we've got him upstairs at this very minute !
Oh, dear ! I only hope that girl isn't wearing a necktie at this very moment.
I can't believe it ! not in the Cupid Room !
you know, Glad, sometimes just thinkin' about the lusts of men...
makes me want to heave.
hello. Will you give me the police, please ?
Hello, police ? I'm the porter of the Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.
could you come at once ? I've got this fellow you're looking for here.
you know, the necktie murderer.
he came here with a girl.
come away, Glad. You're not to do anything suspicious.
[ knocking ] Open up !
[ knocking ] Open up ! police !
they must've gone down the back stairs.
but I ask you, in all conscience, is it likely I would murder a woman I'd been married to for ten years ?
if it was true, it would be horrible.
and rape her... after ten years of marriage ? violently rape her ?
I don't know. I'm always hearing of kinky things. Perhaps you was jealous of her.
of Brenda ? Oh, come off it. I didn't know Brenda. It's possible.
maybe you just wanted to get rid of her. But I had got rid of her.
we were divorced, remember. We had been for two years.
there was no question of alimony. She earned far more than me.
you got that money from her, didn't you ? you never collected a debt.
well, yes, I did.
but she gave it to me the night before when we had dinner.
twenty pounds. Why lie about it, then ?
I suppose I was ashamed to admit it, that's all.
that makes sense, I suppose.
but if Brenda gave you the money at dinner, why'd you sleep in the doss house ?
you could've afforded a hotel. I didn't realize that I had it.
she slipped it into the pocket of my raincoat.
Oh, go on, Dick. Why don't you pull the other one ? it's got bells on it.
but it's true ! I suppose she didn't want to embarrass me.
you've got to admit it is pretty tall.
it's not as tall as me sleeping in a doss house with 20 quid in my pocket !
if I knew I had it, I'd never have gone there, would I ?
maybe. Maybe ! you smelled that jacket !
would you sleep there if you didn't have to ? it wasn't that bad, that jacket.
I still think it's a bit suspicious, your sending it to the cleaners.
suspicious of what ? in them sex cases, they always do a lab test on the clothes.
it stank to high heaven !
that's why. You know it did.
barbara, I swear I'm telling the truth.
do I look like a sex murderer to you ?
can you imagine me creeping around London, strangling all those women with ties ?
that's ridiculous. For a start, I only own two.
well, it's true. That jacket was a bit smelly.
and if you had known about the money, you wouldn't have stayed with old men like that.
then you believe me ?
thousands wouldn't.
Thanks.
I must be soft in the head lettin' a suspected strangler...
put his arms around me.
shows you trust me. I suppose so.
Hey, what we gonna do ? the police will be looking for you !
I don't know. I haven't thought yet.
there's only one thing you can do. Tell them what happened, like you told me.
no, I can't do that. You've got to !
they'd never believe me. Why not ? I did.
you're not the law. I'm probably their only suspect.
you have to go along and persuade them to search for someone else.
I mean, one look at you and they'd know you wasn't a sadistic killer.
[ man ] Blaney! Come on !
Dicko !
haven't done any of this cloak-and-dagger stuff since the Suez business.
that's when I first met Dicko, in the squadron, you know.
he was a bit of a split-assed type then too.
Hetty, you remember Dicko, don't you ?
of course. Come in.
this is Miss Milligan. Hello, Miss Milligan.
pleased to meet you. I bumped into them in the park.
how fortunate ! we haven't seen you in ages, Dick.
how's Brenda ? do you still hear from her ?
well, uh, she's dead... I'm afraid.
yes... and you killed her ! steady on, Hetty.
he didn't do it. He's just been telling me all about it. Has he, now ?
see, he was seen near the place where Brenda was murdered.
so the police think he's the strangler chap. But he's not, of course.
all he wants is a place to hide out.
and you suggested he should stay here.
well, yes. It seemed a good idea.
nobody ever knows who's staying here.
you're a bloody fool, Johnny, getting yourself involved like this.
but he didn't do it. [ Hetty ] Of course he did it!
what, old Dicko ? - Yes, old Dicko, the chivalrous knight of the skies !
[ Hetty ] He always treated her like a chit!
I think you're absolutely wrong.
don't you remember that disgusting divorce petition ?
the things you did to her!
divorce petition ? - Oh, didn't he tell you ?
did he forget to mention he was divorced from his wife on the grounds of extreme cruelty ?
thank you very much.
well, is it true ?
yes !
both extreme mental and physical cruelty.
depravity was mentioned, I think.
it had to read that way, but there wasn't a word of truth in it !
the lawyers made the whole thing up.
neither of us wanted to wait three years to get a divorce on the grounds of desertion, so I allowed her to divorce me on the grounds of cruelty.
extreme cruelty.
I wonder if the police have read a copy of it.
my God !
[ Hetty ] Yes, I'm sure they'll be fascinated.
he's innocent, I know he is. You know it ? how do you know it ?
as you say, they'd been divorced. There was no call for him to do her in.
there's no spiteful act I'd put past old Dicko here, especially if he were drunk.
were you drunk when you did it ? was that it ?
I didn't do it, Hetty.
I didn't do it ! I swear !
then why don't you go to the police and explain to them instead of involving Johnny ?
I didn't want to involve him. He insisted.
that's right, I did. Can't abandon a chap in trouble.
I still say, why don't you go to the police and inform them ?
they'd never believe him, that's why.
he's the only suspect they've got, and with all the evidence against him, they'd lock him up without so much as a by-your-leave.
please hide him, Mrs. Porter, just for tonight, until we can think what's best to do.
course we'll hide him. Can't throw an old comrade to the cops.
well, if you want to be arrested for harboring a wanted man...
or subverting the course of justice or whatever, on your own head be it, Johnny.
but I wash my hands of the matter.
thank God we're off to Paris tomorrow morning. That's all I can say.
that is, if we're not all in jail ! I'm going shopping.
perhaps I'd better go. Nonsense, old chap.
don't worry about Hetty. I'll calm her down. Use the sofa tonight.
I must be off. I'm ever so late already.
what do you do, Miss Milligan ? I work in a pub.
same place he used to be. Really ?
why don't both of you slip out of the country 'til this whole thing's blown over ?
come and give me a hand at the Bulldog. Bulldog ?
it's an English pub I've opened in Paris. They're the new thing there.
that's a great idea. Why don't we ?
not likely. I never was any good at French.
you don't have to be. It's an English pub.
as long as you can say "non, " you'll be all right.
well-- Come on, Babs.
you don't like the Globe any more than I did.
meet me at Victoria Station tomorrow morning, 1 1: 00, by the flower stall.
we can shoot down the coast and get a day trip to France. You don't need a passport.
okay. - Splendid !
Froggies will roll over and die at the sight of a real English barmaid.
I must go now, really. You know Forsythe.
mum's the word, eh ? don't tell a soul I'm here.
cross me heart and hope to die.
thanks for lookin' after him. Not at all, my dear.
I'll come see you to the lift.
enjoying that, are you, sir ?
sergeant, my wife is currently taking a course at the Continental School of Gourmet Cooking.
apparently they've never heard of the principle: To eat well in this country, one must have breakfast three times a day.
and an English breakfast at that. I don't mean your cafe complet.
beg pardon, sir ? the cup of coffee half an inch deep...
in floating bits of boiled milk, and a sweet bun full of air.
that's what I had this morning. I see what you mean, sir.
I'm a... Quaker Oats man, myself. [ Chuckles ]
excuse me, sir.
this has just come in. It's the lab report on the ten-pound note...
that Blaney used to pay the hotel bill with. Yes.
as you'll see, the note bore traces of face powder...
identical to that which we found in Mrs. Blaney's handbag.
thank you. Thank you, sir.
well, Sergeant, we were in luck after all.
Yes, sir. That just about does it for him, I'd say. Looks very much like it.
I've never run into any of these jokers before, sir. What are they like ?
Oh, they vary... but not a lot.
the important thing to remember is they hate women, and are mostly impotent.
impotent ? don't mistake rape for potency, Sergeant.
in the latter stage of the disease, it's the strangling, not the sex, that brings them on.
above all, of course, they're sadists.
you know what they are, Sergeant, I'm sure. Oh, yes, sir.
if you don't, read all about it in there: Mrs. Blaney's divorce petition.
it tells you a great deal about the habits of our hero.
yeah ?
right. Put him on. Yes, Chief Inspector Oxford speaking.
my name is Forsythe, Inspector. Felix Forsythe.
I run the Globe Public House, Covent Garden.
I see from the newspaper you're in charge of these strangling cases.
Yes, that is so.
good, because I've got some information to impart.
now, this man you're looking for, the one with the patches on his suit.
I know him. He worked here as a barman.
his name is Richard Blaney. He's a right bastard.
are you quite certain it's the same man ?
gone off with your barmaid ? what exactly do you mean by "gone off" ?
she's been out all night with him and hasn't yet returned.
I felt it my duty to tell you that I consider her to be in great danger.
that is, of course, if she's still alive and kicking.
thank you for your information, Mr. Forsythe.
tell me, what does this barmaid of yours look like ?
I can set your mind at rest on one point. She was alive at 8: 00 this morning.
8: 00 this morning ?
well, where is she now ? we opened at 1 1: 00 !
what I want to know is, is she coming back here or not ? she's left all her clothes !
I expect she'll turn up sooner or later.
these days, ladies abandon their honor far more readily than their clothes.
thank you for your information, Mr. Forsythe. I'll send someone over.
that was Forsythe, manager of the Globe Public House, Covent Garden.
I tell you what, Jim, I'm glad I'm not in the potato business.
got enough troubles of me own. You're not a bad judge, Bob.
the potato business is poison, always was.
it costs a fortune to dig 'em up, another fortune to transport them.
and what do you have at the end? Hardly any money for them.
mostly you can't sell them.
I've got to send a truckload back up to Lincolnshire tonight.
and what will they do with them ? they'll plow them back in.
[Jim ] Can you beat it ?
and they say there's people hungry in this world. True, Jim.
and there are a few thirsty as well. Come on, have one with your Uncle Bob.
good afternoon !
where do you think you've been ? your half-day was yesterday afternoon !
you took a hell of a chance, didn't you, spending the night with a murderer ?
how do you know I spent the night with anyone ? now come off it.
you took his clothes to him. You didn't come home. It stands to reason.
why don't you mind your own bleeding business ? don't talk to me like that !
I was worried about you. I thought you might be next. I even phoned the police.
police ? Yeah. They wanna talk to you.
they're sending a fella over from Scotland Yard. Why ?
why ? because they want your lover.
they wanna pick him up and put him where he can't strangle any more women !
and you'd better help 'em. The sooner that madman's behind bars the better.
don't you talk about him like that !
you don't realize how lucky you are to be alive !
christ Almighty, Babs, if I wasn't shorthanded, I'd take you myself !
as it is, right after closing time-- I won't be here !
you can stuff your rotten job right up your jacksie ! come back, you!
Oh, balls !
got a place to stay ?
Oh, it's you, Bob. Yeah.
I heard that ding-dong you had with Forsythe. Oh, he's a right bastard.
of course he is.
you can stay at my place 'til you get something sorted out... if you want.
I won't be in your way. I'm going up north for a few days.
no strings ? now, do I look like that sort of a bloke ?
all blokes are that sort of a bloke.
are you really goin' away ? sure ! tonight.
you can have the place to yourself. I'll take you there now.
and if you like, I'll go back to the Globe and pick up your stuff for you.
now, I can't say fairer than that, can I ?
Oh, thanks, Bob. I'll just stay the one night if you don't mind.
suit yourself . tomorrow I'm gonna go to, um
I'm going to my sister in Southall.
leaving your boyfriend in the lurch a bit, aren't you ?
he has to make up his own mind what to do.
I'd like to help him if I could. Where's he hiding out ?
can't tell you, Bob. I promised. Ohh !
come on, Babs. Dick and me have always been mates. You know that.
I can't.
all right. Keep your little secret.
you know, changing jobs can be a blessing in disguise. It gets you out of a rut.
a girl like you ought to travel, see the world a bit.
the Cape, California, Jaffa. Where the fruit comes from, that's where I'd like to go if I wasn't tied down here.
but you, you can do as you please !
you've got the whole of your life ahead of you.
here we are. I'm on the second floor.
I don't know if you know it, Babs, but you're my type of woman.
[ Mrs. Oxford ] Is that you, Tim ? Hello, dear.
hungry ? yes !
good. I'll bring it right in.
it's a soup , dear.
I know you'll enjoy it. I have no doubt of it.
don't wait for me. I'm just going to see to the next course.
well... what's new in the case ? any sensational breaks ?
no. I'll be glad when we get Mr. Richard Blaney inside, though.
any idea where he is ?
no, our only lead to him left her job this morning.
I don't know where she is either. You're certain he's the one ?
Oh, yes, he's... the one, all right.
there's not even the complication of another suspect.
it has to be him.
we have him identified as leaving the matrimonial agency...
at the time his ex was killed.
we have the clothes which he found necessary to send to the cleaners in a hurry.
and we have the evidence of the face powder and the Salvation Army hostel.
I don't follow you, my dear.
I didn't think the Salvation Army girls used makeup.
no, Blaney slept in a Salvation Army hostel the night before last.
did he, dear? - Yes.
he was incautious enough to tell them his name.
I don't think an ex-R. A. F. officer would sleep in such a place...
unless he was broke, do you ? no, I don't.
so, let's assume he was.
last night, however, he slept in the...
Coburg Hotel in Bayswater...
and paid for his extremely expensive room with a ten-pound note.
the note bore traces of the same face powder we found in Mrs. Blaney's handbag.
I mean, the murderer not only strangled Mrs. Blaney, he stole money from her handbag as well.
ergo... Blaney is the thief and also the murderer.
that ties it up then.
well, I think so.
and furthermore, there is a waitress at Mrs. Blaney's club who can also testify to Blaney's aggressive behavior towards his wife the previous night.
he doesn't seem to have been very discreet, does he ?
no. Discretion is not traditionally the strong suit of the psychopath.
believe me, that's what we're dealing with.
you ought to read his wife's divorce... petition.
what exactly is in this soup ?
why ? don't you like it ?
Mmm ! it's delicious.
but I find the ingredients are somewhat mystifying.
they're smelts, ling, conger eel, John Dory, pilchards and frog fish.
now, since that must've been fairly satisfying,
I thought a simple roast bird would be enough.
Caille aux raisins.
hmm ?
quail with... grapes.
I must say, I'm very worried. About Mr. Blaney ?
Yes. He's gone off with a barmaid he used to work with.
I think she's in very great danger.
you're wrong, Tim. Absolutely wrong.
it can't be this fellow.
how long did you say he was married?
ten years.
well... there you are.
a crime de passion after all that time ?
look at us. We've only been married eight years, and you can hardly keep your eyes open at night. That's as may be.
but I don't knock you about or make you do degrading things.
no, the evidence speaks for itself.
besides, you can't make normal judgments about psychopathic killers.
they can be triggered off at any time.
we've got to find him before his... appetite is whetted again.
christ all-bloody-mighty !
[ man ] See you, mate.
you bitch ! Where's that bloody pin ?
Hey, you're spilling your load !
what ? the potatoes. They're falling on the road.
Hey, do you see what I see ?
here, what's wrong-- Who is it ?
[ policeman ] Perhaps you can tell us.
wake up ! what ?
get out of here. What is it ?
Brenda wasn't enough for you. You had to kill another girl too !
what girl ? you know. That girl you brought here yesterday.
Babs ? as if you didn't know.
you strangled her like all the others !
she's been strangled ?
don't you playact with me. Get up and get out of here.
I'd call the police myself if I knew how to do it without getting involved.
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.
it's true, Dicko. It just came over on the radio.
they found her in a potato truck in Lincolnshire.
the fellow at the pub where you worked identified her.
he knows where they found her. He put her there !
what are you talking about ? I haven't left this room all night.
liar. I don't believe you. It doesn't matter whether you believe him or not, because it said on the radio Miss Milligan had been dead for at least 1 2 hours when they found her at 3: 00 this morning.
she must've been killed before 3: 00 yesterday afternoon.
Dick was with us from the time she left to the time we went to bed.
so he couldn't have done it.
poor kid. [ Hetty ] I still don't believe it.
they're only guessing when she was killed.
we didn't go to bed 'til 1 1: 00, and Dick was here with us then.
they can't be eight hours adrift. Dicko ?
don't you see what this means ? you're in the clear! We can give you an alibi.
Yes. Yes, I suppose you can.
there's no supposing. We'll simply tell the police you were here with us.
would you do that ? would you do it now before you go away ?
of course I would. Delighted. You'll do no such thing !
what ? not unless you want to go to jail for harboring a wanted man.
but he's not a criminal. The police think he is!
and they have a lot of evidence against him.
we know he didn't kill Miss Milligan. We've got to tell them he was with us.
but we don't know he didn't kill Miss Milligan !
for all we know the time given on the radio might've been a trap.
what is certain, if you go to the police, they will probably charge you with being an accessory after the fact.
and they certainly won't allow us to go abroad, and they will probably put us in jail.
well, Hetty's right, dammit. You can see that, Dicko, can't you ?
you mean you won't come to the police with me ?
I don't see how I can. You heard Hetty. - You're my only alibi !
I'm sorry. I've got to get to Paris today. I can't afford to be kept here.
but you can afford to stand by and see me go to jail for life !
is that it ? it's not as bad as that. I mean, they'll find this strangler chappie. Of all the cowardly shits !
it's "I'm all right and haul up the ladder, " isn't it ?
you pair of bastards !
if that's how you feel after all we've done for you, you better had go !
I'll call the manager.
and involve yourself? Don't worry, I'm going.
I'm a little choosy with whom I spend my last hours of freedom.
look, I'm sorry about this. I'd suggest that you came to Paris and worked in a pub, but they're watching all the ports and stations. It said so on the news.
well, that lets you out then, doesn't it ?
your responsibility for me ends here.
clear this area, please. Thank you, madam. Stand back, please.
looks as though we've got half the law in London in the market this morning.
Yeah. It makes it very difficult to give short weight.
I suppose they're trying to find out...
if anybody saw Blaney put Babs on that potato truck.
you think he did it, do you ? it stands to reason, doesn't it ?
why ? don't you ? I'm not as eager as some to turn on my old mates.
what are you talkin' about ? Blaney wasn't a mate of mine.
I suppose you know I had to sack him for stealin'. Get off.
Yeah, Blaney was a thief, right bastard.
I even told that Chief Inspector, but he didn't believe a word, did he ?
I suspect he's laughing on the other side of his face now.
you reckon ? Yeah, definitely, definitely.
he wasn't so cocky when I saw him at 7: 00 this morning.
I've just been down to Scotland Yard to identify her.
from photos, you know. They took 'em, and they... rushed 'em down special.
she wasn't a pretty sight, I can tell you. Some people have all the luck.
Yeah. I better get a move on.
business will be pretty brisk today. You know how morbid some people are.
absolutely ! jumping up to identify dead girls at all hours of the morning.
see you later.
my God, Dick !
whatcha doin' here ?
I'm sorry, Bob, but I had nowhere else to go.
the people I was staying with left for Paris this morning.
I wouldn't have come, but you did say if I needed anything, anytime
Yes, yes, of course ! but you took a hell of a chance coming here this morning.
the whole place is teeming with coppers. Wait a minute.
well, you'd better hole up in my place for a day or two 'til we get something sorted.
Yes. I thought maybe if you had the room.
I know it's a hell of an imposition getting you involved and everything.
you've got to believe me. I haven't murdered anyone!
this whole business is insane ! you know me.
I wouldn't get involved in anything like this. Of course you wouldn't. No.
the police, as usual, have got the whole thing arse about face.
I mean, these sort of killings always boggle the mind.
that man must be a sexual maniac.
mind you, there are some women who ask for everything they get.
but you ? don't make me laugh. You're not the type.
now... don't worry.
you've done the right thing coming to your Uncle Bob.
right. Well, let's get over to my place now. You know where it is ?
Yeah. Great. I'll go first, and I'll take the bag.
you'll be less conspicuous that way. Okay.
you follow, but take the long way around. Go down to the Strand, you know.
and then work your way up Southampton Street. Okay ? Yeah.
well done, boy ! come in.
make yourself comfortable.
very cozy. Yes, well, it's my little nest.
you know, my home.
home is the place where when you have to go there, they have to take you in.
that's what my ol' mum used to say. You met my mum, didn't you ?
Yes. Ah, great old lady.
I better get to the shop. See you later, eh ? Yeah, sure.
there's something to eat in the kitchen. The booze is here.
so get on with it, right ?
Bob, I'm really grateful for all this. You know that.
I told you, think nothing of it.
Hey, do me a favor, will you ?
keep away from the windows. Yes, of course. Sorry.
don't do anything I wouldn't do.
are you Richard lan Blaney ?
Yes. What is this ? you're under arrest. Come quietly, and you won't get hurt.
is this necessary ? we take no chances with bastards like you.
is this your bag ? Yes.
thank you, Mr. Rusk. You've been very helpful. Anything to oblige, Sarge.
no reward, I'm afraid. Better luck next time, eh ?
you know what they say. "Virtue is its own reward."
l-- Well, if you want any more help, I'll be in my shop.
all right. We know where you are.
richard lan Blaney ? Yes.
as the result of my inquiries, you'll be detained in connection...with the willful murders of Brenda Margaret Blaney, Barbara Jane Milligan and others.
you're not obliged to say anything unless you wish.
anything you do say will be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence.
Mr. Oxford, could you spare a second over here ?
Rusk. It's Rusk !
hold him back. Where was this found ?
over at Henrietta Street where we picked him up. Any identification ?
miss Barbara Milligan, Globe Public House.
covent Garden, London, W. C.2.
[ clerk ] Are you agreed upon your verdict ? we are.
do you find the prisoner, Richard lan Blaney, guilty or not guilty of the murder of Brenda ...lan Blaney, you have been found guilty of a terrible crime.
on its ghastly and wicked nature I will not dwell.
I only tell you that you must entertain no expectation or hope...
that you will escape the consequences of it.
the sentence of this court is that you serve a term of life imprisonment for not less than 25 years.
[ Blaney's Muffled Voice ] Rusk did it ! I told you all along ! Rusk !
I keep telling you. Rusk, where are you ?
one of these days, you bastard !
rusk, where are you ? Rusk ?
one of these days, I'm gonna get out and kill you, you bastard !
I've got nothing to lose now !
I might as well do what I'm being locked away for !
you remember that ! you remember that !
[ Blaney's Voice ] Rusk did it.
Rusk did it. I've told you all along!
Rusk ? rusk, where are you ?
one of these days I'm gonna get out and kill you, you bastard!
I've got nothing to lose now. I might as well do what I'm being put away for.
you remember that! You remember that!
do you see the sign, Hartletts ? Yes, sir.
[ oxford ] It's the fair-haired chap in the brown suit standing underneath it.
did you see him ? right. Yes, I did.
we'll go around once again, and I want a good, close mug shot.
[ Monica ] Yes, Inspector, I remember him well.
he came here on two or three occasions.
every business has its own special cross to bear, I suppose.
and yours is men like this ? that is so.
most of them are easy enough to get rid of, but Mr. Robinson here was particularly insistent.
he wouldn't take no for an answer. Mr. Robinson ?
Yes, that is the man's name.
here we are.
Mr. William Robinson.
you see, Inspector, he wanted us to find women for him who enjoyed, well... certain peculiarities.
you mean, who were sexual masochists ? who enjoyed being hurt ?
that sort of thing ? quite.
perhaps you'd better see it for yourself.
naturally we told him we couldn't oblige, but as I say, he kept coming back.
is it likely, do you think, that if Mr. Robinson couldn't get what he wanted from your agency, he would go to others ? Oh, yes, very likely.
men like this leave no stone unturned in their search for their disgusting gratifications.
excuse me, Inspector.
do you have any special reason for seeing Mr. Robinson ?
Yes, Miss Barling, we do. And I'd like you to keep my visit confidential.
of course.
[ guard ] Get the doctor quick. Looks like an ambulancejob.
I told you it wasn't Blaney, didn't I ?
I told you you were on the wrong track.
a woman's intuition is worth more than all those laboratories.
I can't think why you don't teach it in police colleges.
so you think it's Rusk, do you ? you think he's our man ?
well, of course. Anyone can see that.
he knew both Mrs. Blaney...
and that Barbara what's-her-name, didn't he ? Yes.
well, there you are.
you told me the man's a sexual pervert.
that's why he kept the clothes and put them in poor Mr. Blaney's case.
we have no proof of that.
it stands to reason.
don't you mean intuition ?
what does your intuition tell you I want for dinner tonight ?
steak and a baked potato.
but you're getting...
[ oxford ] It looks like a pig's foot! That's what it is.
I put it in the same sauce the French use for tripe.
that's comforting.
well, when are you going to arrest...
this Mr. Robinson, or Rusk, or whatever he's called ?
when I have the proof I need.
it takes longer to acquire than intuitive insights. When will you have it ?
in a few minutes I hope, dear.
really ?
you old slyboots. Tell.
well...
we know that if Rusk is the murderer, he traveled up in a potato truck with his victim.
how do we know that ?
did you ever hear of a corpse that cut itself out of a tied sack ?
what would he want to take the corpse out of the sack for?
obviously he was looking for something.
how do we know that ?
the corpse was deep in rigor mortis.
he had to break the fingers of the right hand to retrieve what they held.
it would be so nice to get back to plain bread in this house.
what do you think they held ?
a locket ? a broach ? a cross !
it had to be something that would incriminate him.
something that he missed when he put the body on the truck.
a monogrammed handkerchief, perhaps.
not a cross, I think.
well...
I don't see why not.
religious and sexual mania are closely linked.
anyway, whatever it was, he found it, which was unlucky for us.
but we did have one piece of good fortune.
the truck driver told us that he stopped at one place on his journey, and that was at a pull-in somewhere out of London.
a pull-in ? hmm.
it's a... cafe frequented by truck drivers, dear.
they serve humble foods like bacon and egg sandwiches, sausages and mashed potatoes and cups of tea and coffee.
how is it so fortunate that this driver stopped there ?
it's not so much that he stopped, but that he stopped only once that is important.
the only place our man could've escaped from that truck was at that cafe.
I sent Sgt. Spearman to see if he could find anyone who could remember Rusk being there.
I'm expecting him back at any minute.
well, eat up, dear. You'll want to be finished by the time he arrives.
tasty, very tasty.
not a lot of meat on it, mind.
no sense in gorging, dear.
I'll take mine and eat it while I'm beating my egg whites for the souffle.
good evening, Sergeant. Good evening, sir.
I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner. No, not at all. Come in.
thank you, sir. Put your hat and coat on the sofa.
good evening, Sgt. Spearman. What would you like to drink ?
good evening, madam. I don't know that l
Oh, that's all right. You're off duty.
how about a Margarita ? it's delicious.
tequila, triple sec, fresh lemon juice and... salt pressed 'round the rim of the glass.
you'll love it. Thank you, madam.
Sgt. Spearman, you are positively glutinous with self-approbation.
you might as well speak out. Yes, sir.
the woman behind the counter at the cafe...
positively identified Rusk from the photo I showed her...
as being a man who called at the cafe the night the body was discovered.
and that's not all.
what are you waiting for ? a roll of drums ? no, sir. Sorry, sir.
the woman also said that Rusk was disheveled and very dusty...
and asked to borrow a clothes brush.
this is the brush she lent him, sir.
you see there ? [ sniffs ]
what do you say, Spearman ? potato dust ?
here you are, Sergeant.
Cheers.
Cheers, madam. Did you hear all that ?
Yes, I told you. I knew all the time. [ Oxford ] Quite.
get this down to the lab as soon as possible, will you ? very good, sir.
it rather looks like we put the wrong man away this time.
what do you mean "we" ? you... put him away.
all right, Spearman, you can get along now. Good night, madam.
you haven't finished your drink. I'm sorry. I have to get down to the lab in a hurry.
good night, Spearman. Good work.
very good work. Thank you, sir.
poor Mr. Blaney. You've got to get him out, Tim, immediately.
he's in hospital at the moment.
I'll talk to the assistant commissioner in the morning and get the case reopened.
he won't like it, but there's quite enough evidence for a pardon.
will they give him any compensation ?
I expect they'll give him some money, but there's no real way to compensate in cases like these.
poor man.
I think the least you can do is ask him 'round for a really good dinner.
let's see.
it will obviously have to be something substantial.
I think a Caneton aux cerises.
what's that ? Duckling...
with heavy sweet cherry sauce.
after that jail food he's been having, I expect he'll eat anything.
excuse me.
I must see if my souffle's started to rise.
hey !
are the pills working ?
he's sleeping like a baby. - Do you think we gave him enough ?
Christ, mate, he's had half a dozen.
good. Now I'm off to get that bastard Rusk !
all right, all right. Let's make sure.
it's now or never ! I'm due back inside tomorrow.
george ? george !
all right, George.
right, son, better be going. Mind you, do him up good.
here, take this strip of mica.
you may need it to open his door. It might be locked.
doctor ? sister ?
get a trolley, nurse.
[ doctor ] Sister, there seems to be no evidence of a cerebral accident.
we'll have to admit him for observation and then sort it out.
[ nurse ] Could he be an epileptic or a diabetic ?
[ doctor ] Not very likely in his sort ofjob.
we're certainly going to need blood samples.
sleeping pills ! they've given him all their sleeping pills.
good night. Good night, sir.
hello ?
good God ! when was this ?
right. What's that ?
Yes. Five minutes. I'll wait outside.
I'm off ! Blaney's escaped, and I bet I know where he's gone.
I often wondered whether Blaney threw himself down those stairs...
in a suicide attempt or just as a means to get into the hospital.
now, of course, we have our answer.
no. No !
it's not-- [ Thumping Noise ]
Mr. Rusk.
you're not wearing your tie.
l
I GOT IT, LONG HAIR BROWN JACKET.
hi THERE.
how MUCH DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT HIS OPERATION?
Dean CALLS IT "THE SHED."
she WAS RECRUITED TWO YEARS AGO, COMPUTER SPECIALIST.
she's WILLING TO GIVE US EVERYTHING.
what IS IT? - WE NEED SOME HELP.
you HAVE TO WALK BACK INTO THAT OFFICE AND LOOK EVERYONE IN THE EYES.
you CAN'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.
Rachel? I NEED A PREP REPORT THE END OF THE DAY.
okay. I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.
I THINK WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM.
what KIND OF PROBLEM? - RACHEL GIBSON.
she's COPYING EVERYTHING ON MY SERVER.
execute PLAN "B."
they SET OFF AN EMP. THEY FRIED THE ELECTRONICS.
she's OKAY.
she's GOING TO BE OKAY.
thank YOU.
can I HAVE THE DICE?
you GUYS SEEM A LITTLE WOUND UP.
let's LOOSEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. COME ON!
loosen IT UP. GET OUT THE KINKS.
it's THAT EASY. IF IT'S THAT EASY, I CAN'T EVEN HELP IT.
bring EM BACK.
that's RIGHT.
there WE GO. COME ON.
mama WOULD LOVE A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.
eight.
she WINS.
tell YOUR PIT BOSS WE NEED MORE MONEY.
we're FEELING LUCKY TONIGHT.
ready?
how DID I WIN? I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.
I CAN'T EVEN HELP IT. I CAN'T HELP IT.
and IT IS THAT EASY.
this IS DISGUSTING.
can I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING, FRENCHMAN?
you're PREGNANT. YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN A CASINO.
you SHOULD BE AT HOME.
do YOU FEEL AT HOME, BABY? WE FEEL AT HOME.
thank YOU.
Oh, YOU'RE GONNA BET AGAINST ME? WELL, GO LUCK WITH THAT.
don't GIVE ME THAT LOOK, FRENCHY.
I WARNED YOU.
no WOMAN IS THAT LUCKY.
this TABLE'S GONE COLD.
Madame, COULD WE PLEASE HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?
sir, THIS IS INSANE.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM? - SIT DOWN.
I WILL NOT. I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.
sit DOWN.
I HAVE SEEN SOME DESPICABLE ACTS OF CHEATING IN MY TIME,
but A PREGNANT WOMAN USING HER OWN BABY TO ESCAPE SUSPICION...
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF.
what CAN I SAY, SIR?
I'm NOT LIKE OTHER MOMS.
Outrigger, I'M ON MY WAY TO THE VAULT.
SIDEWINDER, I'M APPROACHING THE VAULT.
what's YOUR STATUS?
SIDEWINDER? - SIDEWINDER'S GONNA NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME.
I'm AT THE VAULT. I NEED THAT KEY CODE.
got IT. READY WHEN YOU ARE.
go. - 9 - 7 - 3 - 2
I've GOT THE PACKAGE.
I'll MEET YOU THE FRONT. - ALL RIGHT.
this IS PHOENIX. WE HAVE THE ARCHIVE.
any COMPLICATIONS?
well, I THINK I LOST US ABOUT $900, 000,
depending ON THE EXCHANGE RATE.
copy THAT. WHAT'S YOUR LOCATION?
I'm APPROACHING THE FERRY NOW.
have A SAFE TRIP.
Hello? - YOU HAVE SOMETHING OF MINE.
who IS THIS?
I WANT MY PROPERTY BACK. I WANT "MOCKINGBIRD."
what?
you WILL HAVE YOUR PEOPLE DELIVER "MOCKINGBIRD" TO ME WITHIN THE HOUR, - OR I WILL DROP YOU. - THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "MOCKINGBIRD" IS. - YOU'RE WASTING TIME.
please, WHAT IS "MOCKINGBIRD"?
Rachel, YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING.
you NEED TO EAT. YOU NEED REST.
the DEBRIEFING CAN WAIT. - NO, IT CAN'T.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
you NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME... - IT CAN'T WAIT.
I'm HELD TOGETHER BY A STRING RIGHT NOW, MS. BRISTOW.
a WEEK AGO, I HAD A GOOD JOB WORKING FOR THE CIA.
now I HAVE THE TRUTH.
my JOB WAS A FRONT FOR A MERCENARY ORGANIZATION,
and MY BOSS IS A CRIMINAL,
and MY COWORKERS ARE ALL DEAD.
because I GOT THEM KILLED.
it WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
they'd ALL STILL BE ALIVE IF I HADN'T WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING.
your BOSS GORDON DEAN...
he KILLED THEM, NOT YOU.
it DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, I SEE THEIR FACES.
so I NEED TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING I HAVE RIGHT NOW,
because THE SOONER I'M FINISHED, THE SOONER THIS IS OVER.
Rachel, FIRST OF ALL, JUST DON'T CALL ME "MS. BRISTOW."
it's SYDNEY.
secondly, YOUR INFORMATION WILL GO A LONG WA TOWARDS HELPING US FIND GORDON DEAN.Y
we WILL GET THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
then I'D BETTER GET BACK TO WORK.
Oh, BY THE WAY,
uh, A NAME KEEPS COMING UP IN YOUR DATA--"MOCKINGBIRD."
we DON'T HAVE A BASE REFERENCE FOR IT.
Oh. SORRY. IT'S A BRIEFING HABIT.
I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. IT'S, UM, MY AGENCY CALL SIGN.
it's ME.
I'm "MOCKINGBIRD."
I HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT SUITED TO YOUR ABILITIES.
I'll LEAVE THE APPROACH TO YOUR DISCRETION.
I ASSUME YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE TARGET.
I AM.
you'll HAVE OUR FULL RESOURCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
you HAVE RESOURCES?
don't LET THE APPEARANCE FOOL YOU.
we're IN THE MIDST OF A RELOCATION.
I'll KEEP YOU UPDATED.
I NEED MONEY.
where DO WE STAND ON THE SATELLITE OFFICES?
Cleveland, SEATTLE, CHICAGO-- THEY'VE ALL BEEN ABANDONED.
we BEAT THE CIA BY ABOUT AN HOUR AT THE ST. LOUIS OFFICE.
they FIND ANYTHING?
just EXTENSION CORDS AND SURGE PROTECTORS.
alternate LOCATION SHOULD BE SET UP BY DAY'S END.
we've GOT THE ACCOUNT TRANSFERS READY ACROSS THE BOARD.
I JUST NEED YOUR PASS CODE FOR THE WITHDRAWALS.
God, YOU'RE PARANOID.
that's WHY I'M STILL ALIVE.
I GOT HIM.
I've BEEN MONITORING DEAN'S BANK ACCOUNTS BASED ON YOUR INTEL.
30 MINUTES AGO HE LIQUIDATED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
our INFILTRATION IN PRAGUE MUST HAVE HIM CONCERNED.
he's CLOSING RANKS, COVERING HIS TRACKS.
right, BUT NOT TO WORRY, BECAUSE I'M A BIT OF A MASTER TRACKER MYSELF.
I'm ND OF LIKE A COMANCHE INDIAN.
you KNOW... COMANCHE INDIAN WHO--WHO TRACKS DATA.
anyway, HE CONSOLIDATED ALL OF HIS FUNDS.
he DEPOSITED THEM INTO ONE DESIGNATED ACCOUNT,
it's THE AGENCY FAIL-SAFE ACCOUNT IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS.
I SET IT UP.
10/17 IS MY BIRTHDAY.
wait. DEAN'S MONEY IS ALL IN ONE PLACE?
if WE SEIZE HIS FUNDS, WE CAN CRIPPLE HIS OPERATION.
you WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT.
it's A TRAPDOOR ACCOUNT. IT CAN'T BE HACKED.
you HAVE TO BE AT THE BANK TO ACCESS,
and YOU NEED THE PREARRANGED RESPONSES TO DEAN'S PROTOCOL QUESTIONS.
the ONLY ANSWER SET IS ON DEAN'S SERVER IN THE PRAGUE OFFICE,
which HE DESTROYED.
I KNOW HOW HE WORKS.
the ONLY COPY OF HIS PROTOCOL WAS IN THAT BUILDING WHEN HE BLEW IT UP.
there's NOTHING LEFT.
what?
czech AUTHORITIES HAVE BEGUN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BOMBINGS.
we've ACCESSED THEIR SITE INVENTORIES.
and THEY HAVE CATALOGUED ALREADY SEVERAL BR-46 SERVERS.
that's THEM.
Marshall's DESIGNED EM RECOVERY SOFTWARE.
we CAN RECONSTRUCT THE PROTOCOL.
here's THE PROBLEM.
the BIS WON'T RELEASE THEIR EVIDENCE UNTIL THEY FINISH THEIR INVESTIGATION.
so I'M GOING BACK TO PRAGUE.
I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME.
no. ABSOLUTELY NOT. - RACHEL...
you WANT ME TO DIG THROUGH THAT BUILDING?
if DEAN TRANSFERS HIS ASSETS BEFORE WE CAN ACCESS HIS ACCOUNT, - WE LOSE HIM ENTIRELY. - I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE.
those PEOPLE ARE ALL DEAD BECAUSE OF ME.
I'm NOT GOING TO SEARCH THROUGH THEIR REMAINS.
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU TO DO THIS IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY.
believe ME, WE NEED YOU TO DO THIS.
we NEED YOU TO GO BACK INTO THAT BUILDING.
Mr. SLOANE, MY NAME IS BOYD HARKIN.
I'm SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO YOUR CASE.
I'm REQUIRED TO INFORM YOU,
that UNDER NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTIVE 115B,
you DO NOT QUALIFY FOR LEGAL COUNSEL.
I UNDERSTAND.
this IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR MILLER, UNDERSECRETARY REEVES.
we've SPENT THE LAST FEW MONTHS REVIEWING YOUR CASE.
before WE RULE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.
I'm PREPARED TO COOPERATE. - GOOD.
Mr. SLOANE, A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO,
you SIGNED A PARDON AGREEMENT WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
what WERE THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT?
I WAS ASKED TO OVERSEE A BLACK OPS UNIT FOR THE CIA,
in EXCHANGE FOR MY PARTICIPATION,
I RECEIVED A PARDON FOR A CRES.
let's TALK ABOUT THOSE CRIMES.
your RECORD READS LIKE A VERITABLE CATALOG OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY...
multiple COUNTS OF MURDER,
CONSPIRA, TREASON.
if YOU WILL EXAMINE THE RECORD OF THE PREVIOUS PROCEEDINGS,
as WHETHER THE PARDON ITSELF WAS JUSTIFIED...
I SUPPOSE THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
perhaps.
but SINCE I HAVE YOU IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW,
why DON'T WE SEE IF WE CAN SUSS IT OUT?
of COURSE.
we're SCHEDULED TO MEET THE EMISSARY AT 3.
sydney SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED DOWN IN PRAGUE BY NOW.
give HER TWO HOURS IN AND OUT OF THE SITE.
should HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SPARE,
we KNOW WHAT THIS EMISSARY LOOKS LIKE?
no. HE'S GOT OUR DESCRIPTIONS.
he'll ESCORT US FROM THE BEACH.
helps KEEP THE BANK'S LOCATION A SECRET.
if HE TRIES TO BLINDFOLD US, HE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM.
I'm NOT IN THE MOOD FOR BLINDFOLDS TODAY.
noted.
what DO WE DO TILL 3?
we WAIT.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
well, YOU'VE GOT THE EASY JOB.
once WE ACCESS THE PROTOCOL, WE FEED IT TO TOM AND DIXON.
they HANDLE THE HEAVY STUFF. WE'RE OUT OF THERE.
there's A REASON WANTED TO WORK AT A DESK.
I DON'T LIKE PRESSURE... OR DEATH, FOR THAT MATTER.
listen TO ME.
I HAVE TO DO UNPLEASANT TASKS ALL THE TIME,
and THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE.
where ARE THE BIS BADGES?
I'm NOT SYDNEY BRISTOW. YOU'RE NOT RACHEL GIBSON.
we're CZECH INTELLIGENCE, TERRORISM UNIT.
when WE WALK ON THAT FLOOR,
we OUTRANK EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. ACT LIKE IT.
nothing IN THERE CAN RATTLE US,
because WE SEE THIS TYPE OF THING EVERY DAY.
we SEE THIS EVERY DAY.
we SEE THIS EVERY DAY.
which WAY DO WE GO?
follow ME.
it SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.
let's GET TO WORK.
excuse ME.
misters TALDASH AND WHITE?
my NAME IS PIERPONT. I'M HERE TO ESCORT YOU TO THE BANK.
you're EARLY.
I'm MERELY FOLLOWING YOUR ACCOUNT'S PROTOCOL.
is THERE A PROBLEM?
of COURSE NOT. EXCUSE ME.
ye, THIS IS IT.
this IS MR. TALDASH, ROOM 440.
I'm GOING TO HAVE TO CANCEL MY MASSAGE THIS AFTERNOON.
I'm AFRAID I GOT MY TIMES MIXED UP. THANK YOU.
shall WE? - YEAH.
that WAS DIXON. WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS WE THOUGHT.
Oh, GOD.
it's OKAY.
it's OKAY. I'LL JUST-- I'LL DEAL WITH THE SERVER.
go ON.
I've GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
Rachel.
Rachel, LOOK AT ME. I'LL HANDLE THE SERVER,
but YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
you NEED THE HARD DRIVE. - FIFTH. FIFTH ONE DOWN.
which ONE?
get THE COMPUTER READY.
Rachel.
so HOW FAR IS THE BANK?
you've NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE?
this IS OUR FIRST TIME IN THE CAYMANS.
you're LUCKY. THE BANK'S NOT FAR TODAY.
we GAVE UP OUR FIXED LOCATION YEARS AGO.
technology ALLOWS US A CERTAIN FLUIDITY.
we FIND OUR CLIENTS PREFER OUR BUSINESS REMAIN MOBILE.
welcome TO FIRST CAYMAN TRUST.
hook IT UP.
are THE WEAPONS NECESSARY?
they CERTAINLY WON'T BE IF YOU KNOW YOUR ACCOUNT'S PROTOCOL.
give ME YOUR HAND.
hook IT UP.
gentlemen, THERE ARE OVER 300 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS.
we've COMMITTED THE ANSWERS TO MEMORY.
our BOSS IS HIGHLY SECURITY-CONSCIOUS.
of COURSE.
here WE GO.
the SELECT BLOOD RUNS THROUGH...
do YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT THE QUESTION?
no. THE SELECT BLOOD RUNS THROUGH...
ROUQUET'S HEART. - ROUQUET'S HEART.
the FUTURE'S HISTORY IS WRITTEN IN...
the INK OF THE PAST. - WHAT ARE THESE QUESTIONS?
the INK OF THE PAST.
what THE MIRROR REFLECTS... - LIVES ETERNAL.
lives ETERNAL.
if THERE WAS NEVER A ONE, THERE WAS EVER...
Oh, NO.
what? THE DATA'S CORRUPT.
if THERE WAS NEVER A ONE, THERE WAS EVER...
this WAS YOURS. - NO. NO, NO. THIS WAS YOURS.
I've HEARD DEAN SAY THIS BEFORE.
you HAD ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT RHYMED, REMEMBER?
Yes.
gentlemen, I NEED AN ANSWER.
if THERE WAS NEVER A ONE, THERE WAS EVER...
the TWELVE.
the TWELVE.
the TWELVE.
I'sorry.
gentlemen, WE'RE AT YOUR SERVICE.
come ON. LET'S GEOUT OF HERE.
it's OVER. COME ON.
can I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK, A CIGAR?
you KNOW WHAT? I'D LOVE A DRINK.
someone ACCESSED THE 1017 ACCOUNT.
they CLEANED US OUT. WE LOST EVERYTHING.
that's IMPOSSIBLE.
they WERE ON-SITE, TRANSFERRED FROM THE CAYMANS.
no ONE CAN DO THAT.
I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH...
she's STILL ALIVE.
Rachel GIBSON'S STILL ALIVE.
and THEY'VE GOT HER IN CUSTODY.
we NEED TO GET HER BACK.
I'd LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO OMNIFAM.
which YOU USED AS A COVER FOR A GENETIC ENGINE RING PROJECT
that ALMOST CAUSED A GLOBAL GENOCIDE.
Yes.
"yes"?
Mr. SLOANE, I JUST ACCUSED YOU OF ATTEMPTING TO MURDER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
I WAS HOPING FOR A BIT MORE THAN A "YES."
for YEARS, I WAS DRIVEN BY A MISGUIDED ATTEMPT TO PURSUE A HIGHER POWER.
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY MY WRONGDOINGS.
there IS NO REASON TO.
the GOVERNMENT HAS PARDONED ME FOR THOSE ACTIONS.
however, I AM REFORMED.
two YEARS AGO, I LEARNED I HAD A DAUGHTER.
she HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.
since THE MOMENT I MET HER,
I HAVE DEDICATED MY EVERY MOMENT,
every ACTION,
to ATONING FOR MY SINS.
Mr. SLOANE, FOUR MONTHS AGO YOU BETRAYED YOUR AGENCY
and PARTICIPATED IN A CONSPIRACY THAT CAUSED THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN SOVOGDA.
how EXACTLY IS THAT ATONING FOR YOUR SINS?
I DID NOT BETRAY MY AGENCY.
Yes, I HAVE THE STATEMENTS.
your COLLEAGUES SEEM TO HAVE BOUGHT YOUR HOLLOW JUSTIFICATIONS,
but I FIND YOUR ACTIONS FIT A PATTERN OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR
you HAVE DEMONSTRATED YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.
I FIND IT SHOCKING PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE YOUR LIES.
in TRUTH, THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE A MERE FORMALITY.
you WILL ATONE FOR YOUR SINS, MR. SLOANE.
only YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE THE PUNISHMENT.
we DO.
assuming THE WORST, IT WILL HAPPEN FAST.
you'll BE IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED TO A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.
it's DOUBTFUL WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO GO OVER YOUR AFFAIRS,
assuming THEY RULE AGAINST YOU.
they're GOING TO RULE AGAINST ME.
thank YOU FOR GETTING SYDNEY AND MARCUS TO WRITE STATEMENTS ON MY BEHALF.
I'm SURE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT.
they VOLUNTEERED. I DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK.
well, THANK THEM FOR ME.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE POWER OF ATTORNEY OVER NADIA.
of COURSE.
promise ME YOU'LL DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SAVE HER, JACK,
as IF SHE WERE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER.
you HAVE MY WORD.
thank YOU.
he's SCARED. THE CAYMAN TRANSFER WAS A SUCCESS.
we WERE ABLE TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF DEAN'S FINANCES.
as A RESULT, HE'S GETTING SLOPPY,
making UNCHARACTERISTIC MISTAKES.
an HOUR AGO, ECHELON INTERCEPTED A CALL DEAN PLACED TO LAURENT MOREAU,
a BUSINESS ASSOCIATE MS. GIBSON FLAGGED IN HER DEBRIEFINGS.
you LOST EVERYTHING. - IT'S A SETBACK.
we're MOVING FORWARD AS SCHEDULED,
but I NEED TO RETRIEVE MY OPERATIONS ARCHIVES.
you're PLANNING ONLACKMAILING YOURSELF OUT OF THE RED?
where ARE THE ARCHIVES, LAURENT?
relax. THEY'RE SAFE AT RUE L'OR.
I'll CONTACT YOU THURSDAY TO ARRANGE TRANSFER.
Dean's GOING AFTER HIS ARCHIVES. - IF WE CAN BEAT HIM TO IT,
we'd HAVE ACCESS TO DEAN'S ENTIRE OPERATION.
they SAID THEY'RE BEING HELD AT RUE L'OR. WHERE'S THAT?
well, LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN MONTE CARLO,
one OF MOREAU'S FRONTS.
Hey, IT'S A CASINO.
what DO WE DO WITH ALL THAT MONEY WE SEIZED?
having TROUBLE SLEEPING, MR. SLOANE?
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
you'd HAVE TO COUNT A LOT OF SHEEP TO ERASE TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS, THAT'S FOR SURE.
I'm GUESSING THEY'RE GONNA PUT YOU AWAY FOR A LONG TIME,
which IS JUST TOO BAD, REALLY, CAUSE...
of COURSE, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.
huh, MR. SLOANE?
I WORK FOR SOME VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE.
I SEE.
and I SUPPOSE THAT THESE BENEFACTORS OF YOURS WANT SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR THEIR HELP.
they WOULD AT THAT.
we NEED TO TAP INTO THE FIBER OPTICS.
there's A MAINTENANCE STATION IN THE PARKING GARAGE.
guard CHECKPOINTS ARE HERE AND THERE.
they've GOT THE GARAGE LOCKED DOWN.
I CAN GET INTO THE PARKING GARAGE.
Hey, GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT.
winner-- 7, EVERY TIME 7.
Marshall, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HIT 7.
no, NO, IT'S--IT-- IT'S SUPPOSED TO HIT 7, RIGHT?
I MEAN... SEE? WINNER, 7.
you've GOT IT BACKWARDS. SHE'S RIGHT.
Really?
talk TO ME ABOUT THIS VAULT.
the DEPOSIT BOXES ARE IN ELECTROMAGNETIC TUMBLERS.
can WE GET AROUND IT? - IT'S ON A SYSTEMIC SYSTEM.
the MAINFRAME RESETS THE PASS CODES DAILY.
I CAN GET AROUND IT.
if IT'S AN EM SYSTEM, I CAN DECRYPT THE ALGORITHM.
I JUST NEED ACCESS TO THE BUILDING'S NETWORK.
can WE DO IT FROM A REMOTE LOCATION?
it's A SEGREGATED NETWORK.
I'd HAVE TO BE THERE.
but... I'LL GO.
I'll DO IT. - IT'S OKAY.
no, I-- I MEAN, I WANT TO.
I HAD TO DIG THROUGH MY FRIENDS YESTERDAY
because OF GORDON DEAN.
if I CAN HELP YOU STOP HIM,
then THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO.
there's NOT A WHOLE LOT TH'LL SCARE ME.
not ANYMORE.
tell YOUR PIT BOSS WE NEED MORE MONEY.
we're FEELING LUCKY TONIGHT.
Madame, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?
I NEED A PIECE OF PAPER.
here, HAVE THIS.
SIDEWINDER, I'M APPROACHING THE VAULT.
what's YOUR STATUS? - THEY'RE READY FOR US.
SIDEWINDER? - WE GOTTA GO.
do YOU WANNA COME OVER HERE AND DO THE ADVANCED BINOMIAL CALCULUS?
cause I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO STAND THERE AND WATCH.
Sidewinder's GONNA NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME.
I'm AT THE VAULT. I NEED THAT KEY CODE.
got IT.
I've GOT THE PACKAGE.
this IS PHOENIX. WE HAVE THE ARCHIVE.
what's YOUR LOCATION?
I'm APPROACHING THE FERRY NOW - COPY THAT. HAVE A SAFE TRIP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "MOCKINGBIRD" IS.
please, WHAT IS "MOCKINGBIRD"?
I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
ms. BRISTOW,
you're NOT EXACTLY IN THE POSITION TO PLAY COY.
you KNOW WHO I AM.
Yes.
you KNOW WHAT I WANT.
you're NOT THINKING THIS THROUGH, DEAN.
if YOU DROP ME, YOU DESTROY YOUR ARCHIVE.
the LAPTOP'S A FAKE.
there's NOTHING ON IT. WHERE'S "MOCKINGBIRD" NOW?
ms. BRISTOW...
all RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN. LISTEN...
the CIA HAS HER IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY. SHE'S...IN A SAFE...
what?
she's IN A SAFE HOUSE IN PHILADELPHIA.
listen CAREFULLY.
tell YOUR PEOPLE TO DELIVER HER TO THE 30TH STREET TRAIN STATION.
they HAVE EXACTLY 30 MINUTES.
Sydney... WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Rachel, HANG ON A SEC.
I GOTTA CALL MY DAD.
Dean DOESN'T KNOW RACHEL'S WITH YOU?
no.
he's EXPECTING THE C. I.A. TO DELIVER HER IN EXACTLY...26 MINUTES.
task THE SATELLITES. I WANT FULL COVERAGE OF HER AREA.
sydney, IF DEAN CALLS AGAIN, ROUTE IT THROUGH US.
don't WORRY. WE'LL GET YOU DOWN.
you'd BETTER.
Dixon, WHERE ARE YOU?
we're EN ROUTE. FIVE MINUTES AWAY.
approach CAREFULLY. WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON THE GROUND,
but GET TO THAT CRANE.
rules OF ENGAGEMENT ARE AT YOUR DISCRETION.
copy THAT. ALMOST THERE.
Rachel, HOW YOU DOING?
I've BEEN BETTER.
how ARE YOU?
Oh, YOU KNOW, JUST ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE.
Hey, RACHEL, LOOK AROUND BACK THERE.
is THERE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL?
uh, WELL, THERE'S A TIRE...
and A CROWBAR, AND I HAVE MY PURSE.
are THOSE HELPFUL? - NO, NOT REALLY.
uh... HOW HIGH UP ARE WE?
Oh, JUST...
couple HUNDRED FEET.
don't WORRY. I'VE BEEN IN MUCH WORSE SITUATIONS THAN THIS.
you HAVE?
area's CLEAR SO FAR.
we're APPROACHING THE CAB NOW.
it's EMPTY.
can YOU GET TO THE CONTROLS?
hang ON.
he's GOT SOME SORT OF...
that WAS FAST. DO IT.
Sydney?
pull YOUR AGENTS OFF-SITE, RIGHT NOW.
Outrigger, GET OUT OF THERE.
you're TRYING MY PATIENCE, MS. BRISTOW.
any FURTHER DEVIATIONS, AND I WILL DROP YOU.
I WANT CONFIRMATION MOCKINGBIRD'S EN ROUTE.
what SORT OF CONFIRMATION? - HAVE HER CALL ME.
what?
Dean's GOT THE PLACE WIRED. IT'S ALL ON REMOTE.
if I CAN ISOLATE THE FREQUENCY,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OVERRIDE THE CRANE'S CONTROLS.
what DO YOU NEED FROM US? - JUST TIME. JUST TIME.
Sydney.
I CAN'T DO THAT. I CAN'T CALL HIM. HE'LL KNOW.
I'm A TERRIBLE LIAR. THAT'S WHY HE WANTS ME TO CALL.
Rachel, THIS IS EASY. THIS IS JUST LIKE IN PRAGUE.
you HAVE TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE.
you HAVE TO BECOME THE PERSON YOU USED TO BE.
all YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACT HELPLESS AND SCARED.
I AM SCARED.
Yeah, BUT YOU'RE NOT HELPLESS, NOT ANYMORE.
look...
I've SPENT MY LIFE DEALING WITH MEN LIKE GORDON DEAN.
they ALL HAVE A FATAL FLAW. THEY ALWAYS WANT POWER.
so YOU JUST FOOL 'EM INTO THINKING THEY HAVE IT,
and YOU HIT 'EM WHEN THEY'RE NOT LOOKING.
so WHAT DO I DO?
act TERRIFIED. KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE.
we'll DO THE REST.
hello.
they TOLD ME TO CALL YOU.
Rachel.
where ARE YOU?
I'IN A VAN. I DON'T KNOW.
they WANTED ME...
they WANTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU ASKED.
they're TURNING ME OVER TO YOU.
they WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING ELSE.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME?
just COME IN, RACHEL. WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.
I SWEAR, I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.
I BELIEVE YOU.
Marshall? I'M ALMOST THERE, ALMOST THERE. JUST GIVE ME A SEC.
give ME A SEC. ALMOST THERE.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO TO ME?
that DEPENDS ON HOW COOPERATIVE YOU ARE.
I'll DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. PLEASE, MR. DEAN.
please. I DON'T WANNA DIE.
Rachel, PLAN "B."
what WAS THAT?
kick THE BACKSEAT AS HARD AS YOU CAN.
now, DO IT RIGHT NOW!
the CROWBAR.
she's IN THE CAR.
give ME YOUR HAND.
drop 'EM!
Mr. SLOANE, THIS COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED YOUR CASE,
and IS PREPARED TO RENDER ITS RULING.
before WE DO SO,
I'd LIKE TO REITERATE FOR THE RECORD，
my EXTREME DISAPPROVAL FOR TACTICS YOU HAVE EMPLOYED WHILE WORKIN UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
your COMPROMISED METHODOLOGY HOWEVER, WHILE I MAY DETEST YOUR METHODS,
I CANNOT DENY YOUR RESULTS.
after CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE FACTS,
this COMMITTEEIS FORCED TO CONCLUDE
and THAT, IN TRUTH,
you HAVE THIS COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS IN MIND.
I FIND NO CAUSE FOR VIOLATION.
arvin SLOANE, I HEREBY ORDER YOUR RELEASE,
effective IMMEDIATELY.
how CAN YOU PEOPLE SLEEP AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
you JUST LEARN TO TAKE IT WHERE YOU CAN GET IT, I GUESS.
it's NEVER GONNA BE OVER, IS IT?
I'm GONNA BE WITH YOU AWHILE.
in CUSTODY, I MEAN.
you'll BE WITH US UNTIL IT'S SAFE FOR YOU TO GO HOME.
when WILL THAT BE?
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
Dean KNOWS HOW DANGEROUS YOU ARE TO HIM.
we CAN'T RELEASE YOU UNTIL WE'VE BROUGHT HIM IN.
but IT DOESN'T END WITH DEAN.
no, IT DOESN'T.
it's NEVER GONNA BE SAFE.
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO BRING 'EM ALL DOWN.
every SINGLE ONE OF 'EM.
alias -THE END
I mean, there's a stream to the Russian S. V.R. a European pharmaceutical conglomerate, the C. D.C.
they are government.
Marshall counted 12 sources that make up Prophet Five. 12, dad.
my daughter...
when will she be cured?
soon.
perhaps you could be a bit more specific.
I wish I could...
but there are a few more things we need you to do first.
you have a baby girl.
I'd apologize for the method of transport, but I'm sure you understand our need for discretion.
and I am not in a position to simply disappear for an extended period of time without raising concern.
some advance warning would have been preferred.
yes...
but then that would spoil all the fun.
we have some business which requires your immediate attention.
but I can assure you, we'll have you back in Los Angeles before your co-workers even realize that you've gone.
it's not your timetable that troubles me, Joseph.
it's your manners.
here you are.
you're not joining us?
the 12 are waiting for you inside.
you're not allowed in that room, are you?
Mr. Sloane.
it's an honor to meet you.
we've been admirers of yours for quite some time.
gentlemen.
we'd like to thank you for all the work you've done thus far on our behalf.
I'm not certain I have much choice.
not to get into a free will debate right now, Mr. Sloane, but...
you've always had a choice.
this is our most recent medical report on your daughter, Nadia.
as you're aware, we have the capabilities to restore her health.
and we're prepared to do so on a permanent basis, provided of course you complete one final assignment for us.
no, I've heard such promises for some time now.
tell me, what guarantees do I have that this is the last you'll require of me?
look around you, Arvin.
would we show you our faces if it were our intention to keep you subservient?
you've earned the right to stand in front of us.
we have a job for you.
you'll keep your eye on the endgame, as you always have.
because the moment this assignment is over, we'll give you back your daughter.
what exactly do you want me to do?
this prisoner is one of the most dangerous inmates
we don't leave anyone alone with her.
I'm simply concerned for your safety.
well, that's sweet, but something tells me we're gonna get along just fine.
ms. Espinosa, my name's Kelly Peyton.
I work for an independent organization interested in retaining your services.
get out of my cell.
if I'm interrupting your busy schedule
this facility you're in doesn't exist on government record.
you're being held here without charge, which means you don't exist anymore.
I can't imagine that thought's appealing to you.
my employer will secure your immediate release, in exchange for which, you will undertake a long-term, deep-cover operation for us.
I told you to get out of my cell...
which means if you don't take your skinny little ass back down that hallway right now...
you won't exist anymore either.
I don't think you're understanding me.
I'm offering you the chance to get back at the person who put you here.
I'm offering you the chance to destroy Sydney Bristow.
here you go.
what are you doing?
they fell when I tried to put them away.
sydney, you do not leave edged weapons within the reach of children.
she's 4 weeks old, dad. - Particularly young Bristow women.
she can't even hold her head up. I think we're safe.
have you contacted your field sources?
nobody's heard so much as a whisper since Irina disappeared.
we should task Echelon with her known aliases.
we already have.
rest assured, we've engaged our full resources in looking for your mother.
any news of Prophet Five?
no significant activity in the last few weeks.
I don't like it.
mom dealt Prophet Five a significant blow when she stole the Horizon.
if we aren't picking up activity, it's only because they're regrouping, coming up with an alternate plan of attack.
try to enjoy your time away.
right now you only need to concern yourself with being a mother.
as soon as the affairs of the world require your attention, I'll let you know.
I need assurances that Sydney Bristow will not be harmed.
it's not our intention to kill miss Bristow, if that's what you're asking.
I believe you're overestimating my ability to influence her.
even when agent Bristow thought that I was an honorable man, she rarely did as I directed.
we're simply asking you to guide her actions a bit.
she's on leave, content to stay at home and care for her newborn daughter.
I can't task her to re-enter the field and expect her to follow orders.
she would need... - Incentive.
I think you'll find, Arvin, it won't be as difficult to get miss Bristow into the field as you imagine.
will Tippin?
sorry, I think you have the wrong house.
I'm agent Reeves, witness security, C. I.A.
there's been an incident.
I'm afraid that your cover may have been compromised.
something's happened to Sydney Bristow.
come in.
sir, is there anyone else in the house?
I was sort of expecting someone.
but you're alone now?
all right. I've got him.
will's home security system caught the abduction.
when did this happen? - Last night.
will missed his standard check-in.
have we I. Ded the assailants?
the detention facility reported
Anna was still in custody as of yesterday morning.
they were surprised too, to learn she's at large.
and we're just going to accept that? - No, of course not.
Anna's escape, plus her knowledge of Will's location, suggests internal assistance at the highest level.
Langley launched a full-scale investigation.
I don't trust anyone else on this.
we've already requested and been granted
we're only telling you this because Will is your friend, and we both know you'd want to be informed.
we are not asking you to end your leave.
we have this under control.
you don't need to come back to work.
Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.
she's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.
we anticipate that she will reveal herself before long.
we will find her.
Yes, we will.
I appreciate your effort to protect me on this, but as of this moment,
I'm back.
would you mind holding his head steady, please?
he should be awake shortly.
I'll have Anna make the call.
I have the subject you requested.
I'll give you the location once I receive payment.
midnight. Come alone.
echelon intercepted the phone call an hour ago.
voiceprint matches.
it's Anna.
who's the other man?
we believe he's a Russian mafia lieutenant named Yerik Semanko.
the Centurion is one of their known fronts.
sydney, you're to infiltrate the club and surveil the meet.
we'll have a support team on standby to extricate Will as soon as you ascertain his location.
Anna will have 'em on alert.
it's doubtful we'll be able to just walk in the front door.
we will have an insertion scenario prepared for you.
you'll get the necessary op-tech as soon as you get on the plane.
got it.
I gotta go. The baby-sitters are here.
miss Bristow? I'm agent Rance.
this is agent Dalton.
your father sent us.
he speaks very highly of you.
may we come in? - Sure
we've been briefed.
you're wheels-up in 82 minutes.
that doesn't give us much time.
this has all been rather unexpected.
it's my understanding Isabelle is approaching 5 weeks in age?
I would imagine you have a healthy amount of separation anxiety towards leaving your daughter.
Yeah, I do. Yeah.
in addition to our field officer training, agent Dalton and I are both fully trained in infant development, including emergency care.
if you agree, we'd like to go through the house, babyproof it from top to bottom, socket protectors, safety latches, gates for the stairs, spread-spectrum R. F. Detectors, perimeter sensors, explosive sniffers, all the usual stuff.
perhaps now would be a good time to introduce me to Isabelle.
sometimes she just likes to cry.
it can take her a while to calm down. You just have to be patient.
may I?
I understand your current assignment is short-term?
Yeah, I mean, hopefully she won't even know I've been gone.
Oh, no. The mother-child bond is impossible to replicate, even by agent Dalton and myself.
she'll definitely know you're gone.
but we'll keep Isabelle safe and secure until you return.
thank you, agent Rance.
no need to thank me, ma'am.
I'll give you some time to say good-bye.
it won't always be like this. I promise.
I'm just trying to make the world safer so you can grow up and have a regular life.
someone I love is in trouble.
I have to go and help him out.
it's my job.
mama's gotta go to work.
this is Phoenix. I'm in position.
copy that, Phoenix.
Anna's supposed to meet Semanko in 53 minutes.
perfect.
that should give us plenty of time to I. D. him, wire him for sound.
Sidewinder, what's your status?
security's pretty tight down here, Phoenix.
looks like "A" list only.
I'm on it.
Marshall, I'm on the roof.
all right.
let me know when you're ready.
relay's in place.
OK. I'm accessing the network now to get the others into the club.
Uploading...
one...
uploading PHOTO
okay, gang.
you're on the list.
got a guard up top, Outrigger.
I might need a bit of a distraction. - Copy that.
I'll see what I can do.
all clear, Outrigger. - Thank you.
I'm in. - Copy.
alright.
let's find our boy.
okay, Millimeter Wave is online. Here we go.
Marshall, I'm in position.
Sydney? Online.
here we go.
all right, guys, Semanko's making a big payment, so...
we're looking for someone who's carrying a lot of cash.
okay, Phoenix, I just take a look.
this guy looks like he's got a couple hundred dollars worth of rubles on him.
definitely not Semanko.
moving on.
we got dollars. We got euros,
we've even got a little Turkish doesn't look like anybody's buying more than a couple drinks tonight.
wait, hold on, Oracle.
that guy who just passed you has a loaded Makarov under his jacket.
scratch that.
we've got three guys with Makarovs.
three guys.
and the guy in the center looks like he's got about $100, 000 cold around his waist.
think we found comrade Semanko.
Sidewinder, do you have a 20 on him?
northeast corner, near the V. I.P. Section.
got it. I'm on my way.
Oracle? Keep him busy.
please, watch where you're going.
I'm sorry.
a true gentleman would offer to make it up to me.
what exactly do you have in mind?
my apologies. My wife she's...
a bit of a whore.
tracker's hot.
copy that.
he just headed into the V. I.P room.
Checsupport teams.
I want 'em ready to move as soon as we know Will's location.
copy that. They're on standby.
ms. Espinosa. A pleasure.
Where's my payment? - It's all here.
count it if you wish.
where is Tippin?
thought I'd make your life easy.
you'll find him in room 147.
Sidewinder, Oracle, do you copy? Will's in the building.
copy that. Right behind you.
would you two come with us, please.
are you okay?
hope I'm not interrupting anything.
how good is your operative?
we'll find out soon enough.
she hit her.
begin data capture.
you okay?
Where'd you learn to do that?
Oh, I've just been taking some Krav Maga classes, you know.
maybe we'll do this again sometime.
do we need to send backup?
no, let them go.
we have exactly what we need.
well, so, did they interrogate you?
when I came to, there were a bunch of people in the room but they didn't say a word to me. They just sort of left me alone.
next thing I know, you're kicking in the door.
she got you good.
Oh, it's cosmetic.
it'll heal.
listen, you think it's safe to make a call?
did I?
Oh. I guess I did.
do you remember that painter - Yeah. - I...
I asked her out.
and what, you're getting married?
Yeah. Well, no, not exactly.
I was actually planning on asking her last night before Anna interrupted.
but I'm pretty sure she's gonna say yes.
Oh, I can't believe this.
how can you be marrying a girl I haven't even met yet?
well, you know,
I think the government-mandated isolation
sydney, we haven't spoken in, like, two years.
what about you? What's been going on?
for starters, I have a daughter.
what? - Yeah, a baby girl.
her name is Isabelle.
sydney, are you kidding? That's incredible.
who's the father?
Vaughn, of course.
you guys finally ended up together.
I hate lying to him.
he's my best friend. I can't even tell him the truth.
you should've seen Will's face when I told him Vaughn was dead.
the only way to ensure Vaughn's safety is to keep his existence a secret.
you did the right thing. - That doesn't make it any easier.
will's abduction only underscores our need for absolute vigilance.
we're dealing with a very powerful opponent.
you think Prophet Five had something to do
there's no logical reason anyone would abduct Will Tippin...
unless they were trying to get to you.
relax. The operation is moving forward as planned, and may I say that you have performed admirably.
the agreement was for Nadia's cure.
Yes, once the operation is complete.
if I'm to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances,
I need to know the full parameter of what you've planned.
all you need to do, Arvin, is task your team accordingly when I give you the signal.
and what exactly is the signal?
believe me, you'll know.
this is Isabelle.
sydney, she's beautiful. - Thank you.
ma'am, would you like us to stay on duty for the night?
that won't be necessary.
you can go home. - Thank you.
the surveillance equipment's up.
thank you.
see you.
you want to hold her? - Really? Okay.
I'm Will.
what am I, like an uncle?
uncle. - Yeah.
I'm uncle Will.
will, we were talking about what happened.
we have to assume you were grabbed because someone was trying to hurt me.
yeah? Well, yeah.
I didn't think they wanted me for all the Lakers statistics I have in my head.
right? No.
it's... just...
I'm sorry.
none of this would have happened if I wasn't in your life.
Syd, stop. Are you kidding me right now?
my life is so much better because you're in it.
Oh, what... Oh.
what...
sir? Hand over the baby. - What?
agent Rance... - Ma'am, - take the baby from him right now. - Okay, okay.
what's going on?
take it easy. - What's going on? Hey!
sydney, what's going on?
I don't know. I don't know.
well, it's a sub dermal device placed just below the skull at the brain stem.
I've never seen one this small before.
it looks like they patched a radio receiver to a powerful microcharge.
so, what? What does that mean?
it means that they... they...
put a bomb in your head. - What?
I know. I know. But there's good news.
it looks like the charge is small enough that the blast will be localized.
wait, wait.
so it might not kill me. - Oh, no. It'll definitely kill you.
there just won't be any collateral damage.
how do we get it out of him?
well, we could perform a surgical procedure, but...
I'm worried there's a gyroscopic fail-safe.
I mean, there is a very real chance that if we try to remove it,
will's head could explode.
get medical in here. I want a full extraction scenario.
what? No! Didn't you just hear what he said about the exploding?
will, calm down.
sydney, how can I calm down? There's a bomb in my head.
look, don't worry about it.
we're gonna get it out of you. Just...
what is that?
it's my phone.
it's just my phone.
am I supposed to answer this?
Hello?
Hello, Sydney.
now that I have your attention, I have some demands.
you are going to need to do exactly as you are told.
you have access to the government's
I'd like you to bring me a particular page from his manuscript.
which one?
page 47.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.
there's a train leaving for Madrid from the Coimbra rail station at 2100 tomorrow.
be on it. Come alone.
once I have the manuscript page in my possession,
I will give you the deactivation codes for the bomb.
Anna, I swear to you... - Any deviation, Sydney, and I'm afraid I'll have to blow up your friend.
bye now.
we have to take her threat seriously.
Marcus, how quickly can you get page 47 from the D. S.R?
I can have it within the hour.
do it.
of all the Rambaldi artifacts, why would she want page 47?
who's Rambaldi?
Milo Rambaldi was a 15th century visionary with an uncanny ability to predict the future.
his designs have prophesied everything from binary code - to nuclear weaponry to... - is that Sydney?
not exactly. There are people that believe that's me.
the woman pictured here, the chosen one,
will render the greatest power unto utter desolation.
you're "the chosen one"?
you people really believe this stuff?
we've... seen things that give Rambaldi's words weight.
guys, can we debate this later... after the bomb is out of my head?
what's the harm in giving Anna the page?
these are prophecies about things I might do.
if I don't do them, they're just words.
that's right, Sydney, you have a point.
without you, that page is worthless.
we're not seriously considering giving into Anna's demands?
Yes, we--yes, we are. - No, we're not.
this page will get me close, but there's no guarantee
Anna will deactivate you if we give her what she wants.
Marshall, can you hack the detonation frequency?
well, I mean, she mentioned deactivation codes.
the bomb and the detonator are networked.
I mean, maybe I could build a device that would tap into the communication protocol, reverse engineer the codes, but we would need to get the bomb within range of the detonator in order for it to initialize.
get started on it.
but... the only thing I understood from that was to get the bomb in range of the detonator?
you ever been to Portugal?
I'm sorry.
it's simply not possible.
there has been a terrible mistake.
look at me.
I would not know how to purchase a coach ticket if I tried.
we demand a first-class cabin at the front of the car.
it is away from the commoners.
please, there is nothing I can do.
I simply will not allow my wife
my delicate, porcelain lily...
does he speak Portuguese to us? - I believe so.
it is a dead language. It hurts my ears.
perhaps our fluent steward speaks euro.
careful. It's fragile.
I hope you find this cabin to your liking.
perfectly adequate. Thank you.
will, "delicate porcelain lily"?
leave me alone. I was on a roll.
Syd... you know, my girl, she's waiting for me back home, and, uh... so depending on how this all goes down...
if, uh, I was-- - Will, look at me.
you're gonna make it through this.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
I know that. - Okay.
wait. What did you think I was asking?
I... was just being supportive in case you thought...
you might-- - Die?
it's not important. What were you asking?
I was asking you to be my best man.
Really? - Yeah.
before I realized that you have such little faith in me.
you thought I was gonna die?
no, I--you want me to be your best man?
well, I did. Now I'm not so sure.
how would that work, exactly? Would I have to wear a tux?
you don't have to worry about it, 'cause you're not invited.
okay, we're in.
there she is.
now I just have to keep Anna busy long enough to scan the codes.
incidentally, I'd be honored.
let's do this.
you're early.
I've never been good at following the rules.
I understand you being so cavalier about your own life, but I'm surprised that you care so little about your friend.
all right, Syd...
it's working.
tell me, Sydney, what's to keep me from killing Tippin right now?
you've always been a professional, Anna.
and I have something you want.
not here.
let's find someplace more private.
okay. So far, so good.
okay, you're at 38%.
stay close.
not a very flattering likeness.
what I want to know is, why do you want it?
we disproved these writings years ago.
doesn't really concern me as long as the check clears.
although I must say I have had a lot of fun on this one.
where is the detonator?
I don't have it on me.
wait here.
no, she's lying, Syd.
we wouldn't be able to run the scanner if she didn't have the detonator on her.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
sydney, you know I don't play by the rules very well either.
wait here. I'm not asking.
no, we're only at 65%.
you can't let her leave.
Sydney! Sydney, my head's beeping!
you still having fun, Anna?
you'll never beat me.
and you still don't understand the game.
we're collecting her D. N.A. Now.
we have begun the process.
you should have genetic samples shortly.
I understand. There will be no further delays.
it's okay. I've got you!
Anna--we have to get her...
I'm right here, Syd.
looks like you have about 30 seconds.
Oh, thank god.
I'm ready to go home.
sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.
how exactly was Bristow harm?
you locked her in a train car, and you sprayed her with a chemical agent.
I assume your doctors have given her a thorough examination.
let me guess-- they couldn't find anything wrong.
I need to know what you did to her.
no, you don't.
all you need to know, Mr. Sloane, is that you've fulfilled your contract with our organization.
Congratulations.
we've prepared the compound.
inside you'll find the necessary instructions for administering the cure to your daughter.
it's all there...
everything you need to bring Nadia back.
it's been a pleasure doing business with you.
we've loaded the Bristow D. N.A. Template into the sequencer.
genetic fluid is primed and ready.
good.
how's our subject?
ready to get this over with.
vitals are good.
the provacillium should be taking effect.
I've given you something to help with the pain.
if our prior experiences with genetic manipulation serve as an indicator,
I'm afraid the narcotics won't be of much help.
I'm sure I've been through worse.
I really don't think you have.
they'll give you a panic button.
if anything happens, I'll be at your side in 30 seconds.
okay. That part sounds pretty cool. - Yeah, we'll keep you safe.
I can't help it.
I'm sorry you've had to go through all this, Will.
if you apologize one more time, I'm gonna slap you.
Hey, it's not your fault.
it is, actually.
the people I love
sooner or later, something terrible happens to them.
they're kidnapped, they're tortured...
or killed...
because they know me.
I feel like I'm this plague, and everyone I love is infected.
I just...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for all of it.
Yes, I've been tortured, and I've been kidnapped-- several times, actually, and most likely, none of that would have happened if I hadn't helped a clumsy girl pick up her books freshman year in bio class.
but it's not your fault.
you can't blame yourself for the evils of the world.
look, since I've known you, I've seen a lot of horrible things.
there are people out there that are capable of more cruelty and more hatred that I even thought possible.
but I still sleep well at night. You know why?
because I know that you're out there fighting against them.
sydney, you save the world every day, and you never ask for anything in return.
I think I speak for everybody who loves you...
when I say thank you for watching over us.
but if you'd never met me, you'd have a regular life.
who wants it?
I wouldn't trade you for anything.
I know a lot of regular people who live regular lives.
there's only one Sydney Bristow.
I was trained as a spy, warned not to tell anyone what I did.
I thought I was working for the good guys, until I told my fiance about SD-6
and they had him killed.
Rhat's when I learned the truth.
rhat SD-6 is part of the very enemy I thought I was fighting.
now I'm a double agent, working with the real CIA to bring down SD-6, where my only ally is another double agent, a man I hardly know.
my father.
you think the winner of the Edgar Peace Prize is working with Luc Jacqnoud?
Dhiren Patel is lndia's delegate to the U. N.
there is no way he's working with Jacqnoud.
your objective is to monitor the meeting, I. D. the client, and make sure whatever Jacqnoud is up to doesn't happen.
if Patel's going to be our deliveryman,
I'll need the piece by tomorrow.
Salud.
damn it.
the little guy's bodyguard. I know him.
from Corsica two years ago,
the son of a bitch broke my arm.
you. I know you.
SLOANE: The man that Jacqnoud is meeting with is Malik Suari.
he specializes in industrial demolition.
you think Jacqnoud is going to plant an explosive on Patel?
Yes, I do, and I want you two to stop it.
I have a 20 on Patel. -Let's get him out of here.
something's wrong. He looks sick.
he just went down.
DlXON: If they're bombing this place, it's going to be tomorrow's opening ceremonies.
uh, careful with that. That's TNT.
Yes, don't kill us, please.
recognize me now?
anyone else?
keep looking.
I never did find out what you were doing in Corsica.
are you working for Dimitri?
tell me now, or you're going into the fire.
who sent you here?
are you here alone?
who sent you here?
answer me!
little bitch.
get to level "C" now. She got away.
Oh, my God.
what time is it?
SYDNEY: Dixon, it's me.
thank God. Where have you been? I didn't sleep.
that doesn't matter. Listen to me.
have you spotted Patel?
[ crowd chanting ] -He just showed up.
news agencies are reporting he had an arrhythmia.
Where'd they take him?
what I'm about to say, Dixon, you have to believe me.
of course.
the bomb we're looking for?
it's inside of him.
what? lnside Patel?
they implanted the bomb into his chest Iike it was a pacemaker.
a simple outpatient procedure.
Jacqnoud just turned an Edgar Peace Prize winner into a human bomb, which is not good.
did you see the device?
Yeah, it's small, which means it's probably on a wireless remote.
get Patel.
I'll meet you directly behind the auditorium.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to officially open the 2001 Ministerial Conference of the United Commerce Organization.
Hey!
please welcome our keynote speaker.
ladies and gentlemen, Dhiren Patel.
I just punched Dhiren Patel in the face.
any luck with the trigger? -I worship this man.
when you were in the building, did you l. D. the trigger?!
no, I didn't see anyone.
Oh, God.
please wait one moment. I will be right back.
I know you've been field-trained basic medical, but can you really do this?
pull a bomb out of a man's chest?
Yeah.
it's Jacqnoud.
don't forget. This thing's on a remote.
we can't let them get within range.
get me closer.
get me closer!
I can feel it.
Oh, God.
the police have a roadblock.
get around it. -Oh, God.
get me closer!
you've got to hurry!
they put an adhesive on the incision.
it must have bled through. It's stuck!
what?
closer.
Oh, God. -Wait.
what's that?!
it's on a delay. Just keep driving!
now. -[ High-pitched tone ]
nicely done.
you're gonna be okay.
that's insane. No kidding.
Dixon pulled it out of him? -Yeah.
pulled the bomb out of Patel? -The very one.
any luck with The Alliance member?
the what?
you were supposed to l. D.
the minister SD-6 has been trying to protect.
Thanks, I remember. No, I didn't get it.
sydney, if we're gonna take down SD-6
I was busy trying to keep one of the most important humanitarians on the planet from blowing up!
fine.
anyway, I have a paper to finish.
Hey.
I have something for you.
I know you have a lot of questions about your father.
I don't know if you want this,
but I copied his file.
thank you.
sorry, I'm late.
Hey. It's after 1: 00 already?
Yeah, it's 1: 30.
Oh, God, you gotta be kidding.
okay, so I'm in my operations and technology management class, and I realize two things.
one, I prepared the wrong chapter.
No! -I don't want to talk about it.
and two, you and I are gonna have a Halloween party.
we are? -Guest list.
Oh! -What, is it too big?
I think you put down everyone we've met since seventh grade.
you invited Kenny.
so? He's a kid. It's Halloween.
Francie, if you want to see Charlie again, you don't have to throw a massive Halloween party and invite his nephew.
I love Kenny. -I know you do.
but just admit. You're hoping, just a little, that Charlie will bring him.
what?
is that Will?
maybe he's here to talk to you about the humiliating kiss.
stop calling it that. That's what it was.
I gotta call you back.
I'll call you back. Bye.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I got this, uh...
I'm writing a story on SATs.
about how the university is...
what are you guys doing? -Getting lunch.
we're having a Halloween party on Wednesday night.
excellent. I don't have to wear a costume, do l?
no. -Yeah.
Really? That's...confusing.
let me guess. The bank.
it's a meeting with the higher-ups on these bad loans.
okay, seriously. Your job?
it's a problem, right?
I should go. -We know.
I'll call you guys later, okay? -Okay.
see ya.
SLOANE: This is Hensel Corporation.
a Germany-based chemical conglomerate.
they make ibuprofen, hand lotion, toothpaste.
they also have a multi-million dollar research-and-development fund with ties going back to World War ll and the Third Reich.
they don't list the last part in their annual stock report.
this is Jeroen Schiller.
he's one of Hensel's leading biotech engineers.
he lives in Berlin.
we've been in communication with him since August.
the news is that Hensel has perfected a vaccine against biological weapons.
schiller has access to that information.
he wants to make a trade.
what does he want in exchange?
safe passage to the United States.
he lives in Berlin.
why can't he just take a cab to the airport?
germany's not the problem. Hensel is.
anyone who has top-level clearance is closely surveilled.
your job is to l. D. Schiller.
get him away from Hensel and into the United States.
what kind of extraction?
shipment.
Hensel is upgrading their intranet with fiber optics.
you go in as a Rhine Com network supervisor.
now, unfortunately, this is the last documented photo of Schiller.
university of Hamburg, 1975.
we had tech do an age-processing to give you some idea of what he might look like today.
you'll find it in there.
Marshall, go.
right. Thank you.
how is everyone? Hello.
hope everyone's planning on having an enjoyable All Hallow's Eve.
Marshall.
sorry.
okay, this is pretty incredible.
business card. Something you might hand out.
for instance, "Hello, I'm a Rhine Com network supervisor,"
in German, of course, because English would probably give you away.
but the genius, the achievement, is this.
even Sony would be like, "Whoa, Marshall, [Chuckles] pretty cool.
what does it do?
you place the card on top of his computer monitor.
there's a tiny transmitter inside.
this transmitter will override the cpu and make the network think that you are the system administator
uh, the system administrator.
Wow. -Oh, yeah.
you'll manually override the company's firewall.
then Schiller will transfer the vaccine formula from his office to a Canadian-served website.
then we'll get the password once Schiller's on American soil.
so I got your voice mail.
please don't feel obligated.
no. I asked Diane. We're coming.
all of us.
you don't have to wear a costume.
you didn't need to say that. -Good.
Sydney.
could I have a minute?
Oh, of course.
I'll see you at Op Tech.
I, um...
we were closing a deal last Thursday.
I just couldn't get away.
you said that when you called. It's fine.
this is an especially busy time for me, Sydney.
there are six different cases I'm overseeing.
so until things slow down, we probably shouldn't make any plans.
I wasn't gonna pursue it.
I just wanted to clarify.
good.
Hey.
this is Paul Kelvin. Sydney Bristow.
I know your father. -Really?
I hear that a lot.
we got to move fast. I'm gonna jump in here.
the ClA's been watching Hensel Corp for years.
they're not really creating a vaccine, are they?
Yes, but the U. S. Army has been doing parallel research that we thought was years ahead of the Germans until we got your intel.
so what are we afraid of?
schiller and his team have developed micro-encapsulated cytosines.
they activate the immune cells in your respiratory tract.
do you know anything about this?
a little. You?
a little.
enough to know that SD-6 could sell this vaccine to a radical leader who wants to protect his own people and start an all-out biological war.
what am I supposed to do in Berlin?
instead of shipping Schiller, who we'll get out through Bamberg, we'll ship Kelvin.
he's already prepped to impersonate Schiller.
based on available photographs, we think he's a pretty good match.
you'll make the switch in the building's garage.
you sure you're up for this?
I'm not looking forward to it.
what about when Sloane wants you to give him the vaccine?
he'll give them false information.
Kelvin's got a plane waiting.
I'll see you in Berlin. -Okay.
I've got to tell Dixon.
no. Absolutely not.
how do I make a double switch invisible to my partner?
he'll be there.
you cannot tell him the truth.
he might already know who he's working for.
you don't know him. -That's my point.
but I do.
you might be right about Dixon, but you can't volunteer a man for double-agent duty if he hasn't asked for it.
his whole life, his family.
you'd be putting all of that at risk.
you.
is that a decision that you want to make for him?
I'm in.
copy that. All's quiet out front.
Herr Schiller?
you are the agent?
Dixon, I think someone might be following me.
meet me at Einsetzung instead of behind the building.
copy that.
I'm starting the gas now. [ Gas hissing ]
Dixon, I'm on Koenig Strasse.
I'm on my way.
you win the argument at the end of every night
I never know the perfect...
when you asked me to help you set up, you didn't say, "Will you help me set up all day," did you?
we're almost done. -Almost done?
what's left to cover that we haven't already covered with corn?
I work with a professional party planner.
what's going on with work? You always talk about work.
you haven't even mentioned it today.
you want the truth?
I wasn't working on an SAT story when I bumped into you guys.
there is no SAT story.
I was trying to track down a woman named Kate Jones.
she was supposed to be seated next to Danny on a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong.
you can't do this.
what was Danny doing on a flight to Hong Kong if Sydney was supposed to meet him in Singapore?
Kate Jones and Danny were the only two people to miss that flight. The only two.
I was at the medical school because I thought that maybe they'd have her name on file.
there's too many things about Danny's death that don't make any sense. One of them is this woman.
I looked up every Kate, Kathy, Katherine, Kathleen Jones in L. A. county.
plus I have a contact at the airport who said "You can't do this."
nothing is gonna bring Danny back.
when Sydney finds out what you've been up to, which you know she will...
just think about that.
I want to see Mr. Sloane.
Mr. Schiller, I've explained this. Sloane is not here.
tell us the password to the website.
I only talk to Sloane. That was the agreement.
if you were who you say you are, you would know that.
Mr. Schiller, I swear to you Sloane is a liar.
he has nothing to do with the ClA.
so you say Sloane is a fraud?
how do I know it's not you who is the fraud?
you don't.
but you will.
how fast can we get a plane to Langley?
Why?
he wants proof we're ClA.
I don't think he's gonna believe us unless we walk him through the front door.
Hey, Vaughn, we're in.
what's this?
this is the main reason we made the switch in Berlin.
we had Kelvin give Sloane access to a bogus website with just enough real information about the vaccine to keep them occupied for months.
is that really worth risking a man's life?
no, there's more.
once SD-6 downloads and runs the bogus program, it'll give us a back door into their computer systems.
in other words, we have access to their entire network?
files, contacts, accounts?
this is a huge step in shutting down SD-6.
nice.
it was Agent Vaughn's idea.
you look so surprised.
no, I just...
Yes, it was my idea.
amazing idea.
thank you. I know.
this is very exciting.
go tell Analysis.
it's good to finally meet you.
[ german accent ] Yes. The travel was not so easy,
forgive me for being so...
Oh, no, no. Not at all.
so, we have $200, 000 in cash waiting for you.
thank you.
you're welcome. It's yours.
as soon as you tell us, and we confirm, the location of the plant.
plant?
which plant?
where the prototypes are being made.
the vaccine inhaler.
you do know the location of the plant.
you see, I did not get information about any prototype.
I was never privileged to such information.
I have reason to believe you were.
so why don't you think about it?
why don't you think about everything?
how's Schiller?
I want to talk to you about your report.
is something wrong?
you wrote that Sydney changed the pickup from Einsetzung to the rear exit.
I met them on Koenig Strasse.
was this decided upon before the extraction?
during. -Why?
she thought someone was following her.
did you see someone following her?
no, but I was outside the whole time.
I see.
if Sydney said there was someone following her, there was someone following her.
[ Chuckles ] Hey, Kenny.
trick or treat!
there's more candy in there.
come on in.
good to see you. -Good to see you.
Syd, can I talk to you for a second?
what's up?
Syd, we've been working together a lot of years,
I trust you.
I trust you and I love you. -I know.
if something's up, you'd tell me?
what are you talking about?
Sloane is asking about Berlin.
he thinks someone might have gotten to Schiller.
he thinks he might be a plant.
he wanted to know why you had me change the pickup to Koenig Strasse.
I told you I thought I was being followed.
Syd...
is there something I should know?
no.
Sloane says there's a prototype.
an inhaler for the vaccine.
he wants us to go get it, but Schiller won't give up the location, which makes no sense.
that man should know where it is and has everything to lose by not telling us.
what's gonna happen to him?
I think Schiller's in trouble.
but, Syd...
I think you are, too.
I was just an ordinary guy hangin' round Rhat's when I got approached by a hoochie woman.
here's my question. Who eats this crap?
it's like marzipan, but it's worse.
if it's a question between this or dirt,
I would be all over the dirt.
would you shut up about the candy corn?
okay.
you're bummed the kid came and Charlie didn't.
Shh. What?
you gave me some advice. I took it.
now it's my turn to give you some.
what advice did I give you? -About the Kate Jones thing.
I'm giving it up. You're right.
it can only end badly.
so it's my turn to give you some.
you love Charlie. You don't want to lose him.
so don't be an idiot, okay? You gotta talk to him.
don't deny it. Don't wait. Don't piss me off.
that's exactly what I did when I first met Sydney.
use me as a cautionary tale and call Charlie.
Yeah. Will Tippin.
Hi. This is Kate Jones. You called me?
Yeah, um...
did you know a guy named Daniel Hecht?
Yes, I did. Very well.
[ door opens ] -You can't go to Langley.
what? The plane leaves in an hour?
Kelvin could be dead by then.
Sloane's looking for more than the password.
information Schiller would have.
I mean, this could be it.
if this goes badly, they'll know I'm a double.
so what the hell are we gonna do?
that's why I came here.
I need to talk to Schiller right now.
I wouldn't have called unless I had no choice.
it's all right. What is it?
there's a ClA officer named Paul Kelvin.
Yes, I know about Berlin. Paul's a friend.
then you should know his life's in danger.
he's in custody.
Sloane wants intel Kelvin doesn't have.
I have the information Kelvin needs, but I can't get it to him.
Sloane's already too suspicious of me.
but since he trusts you...
Sloane put a call in to me. That must be why.
why would he call you?
he finds me useful in difficult situations.
I'm surprised you're not home with Emily.
I would be... but we have a problem.
Oh?
schiller won't talk.
I don't trust that man...
so I want proof.
proof?
that he's telling us everything.
that he is who he says he is.
I understand.
SYDNEY: Arvin Sloane is not affiliated with the United States government.
he is just a man who used me,
the same as he was gonna use you.
he made me think I was giving myself to God and country, but it was all a lie.
a lie that cost my fiance his life.
if I go back to SD-6 without the location of that plant, they will take the life of another innocent man.
I need to prove you're Schiller and I'm SD-6.
Paul, I have to hurt you.
there's only one person who can stop that.
I'm talking to him right now.
Mr. Schiller...
please.
it's Badenweiler.
the plant is in Badenweiler.
the plant is located in Badenweiler near the black forest.
Badenweiler! It's in Badenweiler!
SYDNEY: Sloane called us in this morning.
our mission is to go to Badenweiler tonight, steal the vaccine inhalers, and blow up the plant.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
sit in these meetings with Sloane.
look at him as if I don't despise him.
as if I don't want to leap across the table and use the skills I've learned at SD-6 against him.
so what the hell do I do next?
what's my countermission?
he practically apologized. -Sloane did?
for thinking maybe I'd mailed him the wrong guy.
imagine that.
and your reward for a job well done is destroying the Badenweiler plant?
Sloane says Hensel's producing supplies for a neo-Nazi terrorist faction.
that is such a load. Sloane wants the vaccine tech.
Why? He thinks he has the formula already.
it took Hensel five years to go from formula to prototype.
Sloane wants to skip that step.
how's Kelvin?
home with his family. Arm in a cast.
he'll be fine.
what about Schiller?
on his way to the Midwest somewhere with 200 grand of Sloane's money in his pocket.
of all of us, I'd say he's the luckiest.
that's for sure.
what's my counter?
all right, you'll break into the building as planned.
while Dixon sets the explosives, you'll retrieve the inhaler and rendezvous with the ClA team, which will already be inside the building.
they will switch the inhaler.
by this time, Dixon should have exited the building.
you'll disable the explosive while the ClA team searches the rest of the lab's main computer system.
you're just gonna steal their files?
this isn't sanctioned research.
Langley wants to know what else Hensel's up to.
so I get out with the switched inhalers,
Dixon tries to blow the charge.
nothing happens.
by that time, security's on their way, and we can't get back in.
that's the plan.
you all right?
what do you know about case 332L?
there's some missing pages in my father's personnel file and references to case 332L.
and Agent Calder.
you read that, too?
Yeah. Actually, it sparked my curiosity, too.
I went to records to retrieve the case file, but it was missing.
there's no record of it anywhere.
there's one more thing.
calder wasn't ClA. He was FBl.
why would the FBl be working with my father?
they wouldn't.
unless they suspected him of selling secrets.
Yeah, I know.
I'm going to the Hancock Park Homeowners' Association meeting.
no, after county records. Yeah.
wait. I'm on my cell. I can't.
[ haltingly ] You're breaking up, so I can't hear...
Yeah. Will Tippin.
Hey, Scourza. What's up, man?
no, I didn't get a fax.
are you sure it was Kate Jones?
Yeah. Where was she headed?
sao Paulo?
her Social Security number?
Yeah. Give me her Social Security number.
what?
let's go.
I'm going for the inhaler.
I'll see you outside in 10.
Mr. Tippin? -Yes?
I'm Kate Jones.
forgive me if I ask you anything too intrusive.
it's just my job.
it's okay.
can you start by telling me what your relationship was with Daniel Hecht?
miss Jones?
Danny and I were having an affair.
sorry I'm late.
not at all. Let's see what you got.
these are 45s?
I need three of them.
so you're Bristow?
Yeah. -Vaughn's told me about you.
he likes you. Yeah?
respects you.
I've got a bomb to disengage.
Yeah, please. We'd appreciate it.
we'll be about 10 more minutes. Good luck.
I had twisted my ankle and went to University Hospital.
Danny treated me, and he asked me out.
Danny asked you out?
Yeah.
I knew that he had been seeing someone, but I wasn't really thinking so much about her.
Syd, come on.
we had talked about going to Hong Kong together, but at the last minute, he just broke it off.
that's all it was, really.
I guess it was one of those relationships that just kind of happen until they don't.
I see.
is there anything else that you want to know?
Yeah, actually, there is one more thing.
I have a contact who tracked your credit card from another one of your flights out of L. A.X.
from that, they got your Social Security number.
I did a trace on it.
here's what doesn't make any sense.
Kate Jones...
you died in 1973.
I have to go.
who are you?
who the hell are you?
got them.
is everyone out of the building?
we're good.
come on. We got to go.
Dixon, we don't have time to go back.
Dixon, what are you doing?
I brought a secondary detonator in case there was a frequency jam like in Peru, remember?
did you get the inhalers?
you good to go?
all right. Let's go.
Sydney?
we've got to run.
sydney, we've got to move now!
Sydney!

when the wind sweeps across a field of grass, it makes little ripples on it like a lake. Listen then, for each gust is a whispered story of the land...
man: It's funny...
I can see my old self quite clearly.
remembering how I felt is much, much harder.
sometimes feelings come back to me when I'm digging, or in a dream.
but mostly, he's gone.
that earlier me...
could hardly do anything, even think anything.
I mean, I could
I could read a bit.
and I could write a bit.
I could talk...
but hardly ever did.
that was it, really.
everything began on that day.
that was the morning I woke up after my fox dream and knew deep down that The Fat had killed my mother.
I don't mean that he'd murdered her or anything, but he killed her just the same.
he shouted her to death.
I used to hear him shouting when I was in bed at night.
when my mother married The Fat, she was pretty. Beautiful, really.
but afterward, she got thinner and thinner until she just died.
he killed her all right.
Peter
hello.
good morning, Peter.
hello. Peter!
Hello, Peter.
hmm?
you're beautiful, little mouse.
here we go.
magic.
Aye.
eat some crumbs.
here you go. You're magic.
are you? Are you magic?
if you're magic, you could make wished come true, couldn't you?
I know what I would wish for.
I would wish that I lived in a magic kingdom.
you could be king and I'll be son of God.
like that? Would you?
man #2: You out back, Bobby?
Bobby had a little King.
king was white as snow.
everywhere that Bobby went,
king would surely go.
we're in good shape, are we? For Mommy's funeral?
I got your suit.
he said I was to hang around while you got changed.
got a ton of jobs to do as well, before we go.
are you coming?
you hardly knew my mother.
here, look.
got you these.
might cheer you up a bit, later on.
Thanks, Dean.
man: Move, boy, go on.
priest: For as much as it has pleased Almighty God, in His great mercy, to take unto Himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in the sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord, Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Valerie Anne Platt Died 1st May 1996 Aged 42 Years
go on, Bobby, open it.
go on, go on.
happy birthday, darling.
happy birthday.
BOBBY: My mom met The Fat at a time when she was very worried about the store.
business was bad, but then she gave The Fat an important job there, and after that, things got a lot better again.
we used to go there about once a week and visit all the departments.
I'd say hello to everybody and they'd smile and say hello back.
I saw the store that day, from the car.
I saw the name PLATTS in big red letters above the door.
my mother's name.
my name.
our store.
the most important thing about me is that when I was little,
I was knocked down by a car.
I hurt my head badly.
I haven't really been well ever since.
aye, get up, Bobby.
my God, look at the state. Come on.
sorry, Bobby. He wants to see you now, in the study.
my God.
you look like my grammy in a coma.
here, blue one will get you going.
come on.
now, come on!
wake up. Move!
come in.
Bobby.
how are you?
the funeral was quite lovely, I thought.
it might interest you to know that I have been giving some thought to the future.
your future.
I want to see Dr. Forrest.
I don't like Dr. Clarke.
Bobby doesn't like Dr. Clarke?
he'll make me take pills.
does this mean Bobby likes Dr. Forrest?
he doesn't make me take pills. He talks to me.
therapy?
hmm. That's a joke.
look at you.
years of talk and no improvement whatsoever.
poor, poor Bobby.
what's the matter?
lights out. Come in.
I just want to say, Bobby, how sorry I am about your mother.
she'll be missed. She really will.
thank you.
Stuart, as you're here, would you mind witnessing Bobby's signature on these documents?
Yes, fine. - Please, sit.
now, Bobby, can you pay attention?
I need your signature on these documents, where I've indicated.
Stuart will witness.
no.
what do you mean, "no"?
no.
no.
no signing.
my mother said never ever -- no signing -- before she died.
she said that. - This is nothing to concern you.
these are legal matters relating to your welfare.
I thought that you were in my sole care?
she said no.
look, your signature means that you will be taken care of.
that's all.
no, she said not to. She made me promise.
Ahem.
look, em
surely he doesn't have to do this today.
the funeral, and so on.
which means it can wait for a couple of days.
I suppose it will have to.
I'll see you in the morning.
Bobby, come here. Sit down.
and what was all that about, "Bobby Booby"?
it seems I've got your mother to thank for this momsense
a sort of parting gesture.
you think these are something to do with the store, don't you?
what if they are?
what use would the store be to you?
let me spell it out for you.
if you sign these papers, the right thing will be you living here with me.
just as you have been doing.
then again, for someone like you, other arrangements might be called for.
I don't -- I don't understand.
Oh, Bobby, you are not so subnormal that you don't know there are certain special hospitals where people like you can go when you're too ill to be managed at home.
I'm not ill.
you can't send me to a hospital if I'm not ill.
I think I can.
with Dr. Clarke's help, I certainly can.
they'll take you.
and they'll keep you...
forever.
think of it.
you'll not there with all the other loonies, until you're an old, old Man.
you can't. - Yes, I can.
but I won't have to if you're sensible.
all you need do is sign and it's "home" sweet home.
I'll give you some time to think it over.
tomorrow afternoon, precisely 4: 00,
I will pick up the phone to Dr. Clarke.
I will tell him your mother's death has been a terrible setback for you.
and in your present state,
I can't cope with you at home.
what happens after that, I shall leave you to work out for yourself.
I can assure you that if your poor mother were here now, she would be on her knees.
on her knees, begging you to sign the store over to me.
you can go now.
not the howling.
I hate the howling.
get up.
get up and get out of here now.
Peter! Peter!
Peter?
Peter! Where are you?
Peter! Peter!
Peter?
what's the matter, Bobby?
nothing.
just looking for something.
you mean, Peter?
where is he?
I want him.
he's in a safe place.
you see, I've always known about Peter.
give me my mouse. I want my mouse.
I've had a little talk with him.
Peter really needs your signature on those papers.
he understands that otherwise, you'll never see him again.
I can't.
I promised her.
it's Dr. Clarke for you.
tomorrow.
1899/12/31 0: 04: 00
and this is all your fault.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
BOBBY: I left by the back gate where the rubbish lorry comes to collect the rubbish.
nobody noticed me. It couldn't have been easier.
I stopped to bury Peter under one of the trees by the side of the road.
after that, I wanted to sit down on the grass to rest, but I was afraid of The Fat.
I was afraid he would send policemen to take me back.
so I just kept going on and on through the day.
then I walked and walked as fast as I could until the houses got fewer and there were more trees.
first it was fun because I had been kept indoors for so long, but then I started to get tired.
woman: Look, that guy's in trouble.
Hey, you all right? Are you ill?
no, I'm just tired.
hungry.
are you trying to get somewhere?
Yeah, Cornwall. - Right, hitching.
walking.
to Cornwall? You must be joking.
no.
Yeah, Eve's all right, Des, get him in.
well, come with us in the van.
that's Jim, the dog. - Hello.
he's friendly, just pet him. - Hi, doggy.
des: We're happy to give you a lift. We're travelers.
my name's Des, what's yours?
I'm Bobby.
des: Okay, this is Glastonbury. We turn off here for Avalon.
you'll easily get a ride from here.
BOBBY: Right.
thanks for the lift. - Yeah.
see ya. Good luck. - Cheers, mate.
Bye, doggy.
BOBBY: Excuse me, are you going to Cornwall?
no, sorry mate. I'm going the other way.
excuse me, are you going to Cornwall?
no, London, mate.
you going to Cornwall?
Yeah, no problem. Hop in.
man: You're lucky, I was just leaving.
Where's all your gear, then?
I don't need any things 'cause I'm going to stay with my grandpa.
well, I finish at Truro.
you said you were going to Cornwall.
Truro is in Cornwall.
you got any money?
Yeah, some.
you can get us something to eat and a cup of tea at the next services.
we won't be stopping after that.
the truck has to be back in the yard by 7: 00.
BOBBY: Is that a rabbit's foot?
we in Cornwall yet?
surprise, surprise, awake at last.
you were no damn use as company.
out cold the whole way.
look, it's a fox.
look at that, will you?
watch me get the bugger.
what are you doing? No! Stop it!
get off! Get off! Get off me!
get off me. You'll get us both killed.
Jesus, hold on.
Oh my God!
Oh shit!
man #2: No.
leave him alone.
what's that you've got there?
it's a rabbit. It's dead.
you're supposed to help people when there has been an accident.
it's no use. He's beyond help.
anyway, you only help good people.
he's not good. He killed this rabbit.
Yeah, I saw it. I was with him when he did it.
no, it was a fox. I saw a fox.
no, the fox ran clear.
this is the poor little rabbit that got in the way.
look. Told you.
he's like the rabbit now.
dead.
dead.
you're supposed to bury dead people.
his own kind can do that.
I have other work.
how old are you, boy?
I'm 24. - 24?
not yet 1 8 I shouldn't wonder.
no, I'm 24.
it's not fair, everybody always thinks I'm younger, but I'm a Man.
just feel like a boy.
why did you bury the rabbit?
cause it was dead, boy.
because I wanted to.
when a creature is killed, I return it to the earth.
I consider it my work.
your work?
rabbits are generally thought to be pleasing animal.
whereas, rats, for example, are generally detested.
both are living creatures of equal value in nature's scheme.
when they're dead, they should be buried.
and you're supposed to bury dead people.
people? People are of no value at all as far as I'm concerned.
besides, they can bury each other. The animals need help.
all the men kill them.
I bury them.
I bury rabbits, rats, mice and birds.
and frogs, hedgehogs, even snails.
where do you find so many things to bury?
where do you think?
on the roads, boy. On the bloody roads.
the car is a killing machine, pure and simple.
I've buried so many.
well, you must know.
you must have been in cars and felt that little bump, that faint crunch under the wheels.
surely you've had that moment of indecision when some little live creature shows up in your headlight, but you drive over anyway and forget about it.
don't you scream blue murder every time the body of a bird hits the precious paintwork of your car?
how many have you killed, boy? And why?
Why? - Stop it.
I've never driven a car. I can't drive.
all right, all right, boy.
sorry.
I didn't know.
I get a bit worked up.
stop crying.
please...
stop crying.
look, let's sit down and have a cup of tea.
come on, I know a good place.
come on.
can I come with you?
come with me? Where to?
you know, where you're going.
where you live.
to stay, is all.
to stay? No, of course not.
you can't come with me.
no, I think it's about time you went home or wherever it was you were going.
I can't go home. I've run away.
well, I can't take you with me.
it's out of the question. I've got work to do.
I can help you with the work. I wanna help you.
well, so good, boy. I don't know you.
and you say you've run away?
well, that's not good.
people might come looking for you. I can't be doing with that.
I could help with the digging. I could carry your things for you.
listen, are you simple or something? I said no.
no, no, no. Now, go away. Go home.
I wanna shine a shoe! I never have anything to do!
Hey, it's all right. No, no, no.
come up. Huh? Huh?
please, can I come? I've got nowhere to go.
well, I
well, I mean
do you really want to help with the work?
Yes. Please.
do you like animals?
I love animals.
so, can I come?
Yes, I suppose so.
I mean, if you really want to come.
Yeah.
thank you.
thank you. You're a very nice man.
man: Come on, if you're coming.
you dropped your whiskey. - Oh, thank you.
there's a few important things you have to remember.
first one is, never talk to anyone about the work, or about me. Got it?
Yep.
the second one is, always do as I say.
the third one is, you must never kill anything.
you understand that?
never kill any living thing.
Yeah, I'll remember them all. I promise.
good. That's it then.
by the way, what's your name? - Bobby.
call me Mr. Summers.
it's gonna get dark soon.
we've got a long way to go.
what's that noise, Mr. Summers?
you'll see.
you see? It's bamboo.
it does so sigh in the wind.
come on, boy.
I imagine it's the land whispering to me.
or playing its music.
do you want some supper?
Yes, please.
come on. Here.
wash you hands and sit down.
BOBBY: What's that for?
the cheese? It's for the mice.
when the mice are finished, the cockroaches come and eat what's left.
it's nature's way.
so, do you feed the mice every night?
every might that I'm here.
if I feed them, they don't steal from me.
people usually kill mice when they don't want them to steal.
but I feed them.
well, I think it's time you went to bed.
you can sleep there for tonight.
Thanks.
good might, Mr. Summers. - I'll put the lights out now.
Mr. Summers. Look!
it's the mice. It's the mice.
I used to have a pet mouse.
he was a beautiful black and white mouse called Peter.
he was so tame, he'd sit right in my hand.
if Peter was here, these mice might have made him king or something.
I would like to hear more about that mouse of yours sometime.
right now, I think you should get some sleep.
Mr. Summers?
BOBBY: I did that a lot, that summer in Cornwall.
I spent a lot of time watching the tiny things go about their business in the grass.
I used to have dreams with my eyes open.
sometimes it was as if I was as small as the things I was watching.
I used to go in beside them somehow, and everything was big around me.
sometimes I got lost in there, but when I got frightened, I always came back to being me again, so I never cried.
all those tiny things seemed to be going somewhere.
I never found out where it was.
good morning, boy.
where have you been? - I've been into town, shopping.
got a few things for you.
come on in, I'll show you.
so, then,
I got you some boots...
and a sleeping bag. There it is.
and a knapsack of your own.
a thermos.
Oh, yes, and a trowel, for digging.
and a toothbrush.
Oh, wait.
I got you this.
well, come on then, boy. Open it up.
Oh, brilliant!
I've always -- thanks
thanks for everything, but I've always really wanted one of these knives.
Hey, it's not a big town, but the shops are very good because of the holiday-makers and the tourists, you see.
now, I'll get us some lunch.
then we've got to make a start.
we've got some especially important work.
we've got a lepidopterist to deal with.
what does the lepidopterist do with the dead moths?
he sticks pins in them, boy.
keeps them in cases with glass tops.
he collects them, thousands of them.
why does he have to kill them?
why can't he look at them when they're alive?
he kills them because he sees nothing wrong with killing them.
also, they're very easy to catch... and kill.
how does he do it, Mr. Summers?
you'll see, boy.
you'll see tonight.
what's that he's got? - It's a deceitful machine.
it's a light so bright that all the moths and insects are attracted from miles around, tricked by the light, you see?
we're gonna put his light out.
how?
smash it, boy. Smash it.
I've been here once before and I've smashed it once before.
is it part of the work?
Yes.
can I do it?
what?
I don't know.
please.
all right. Why not?
you'll be able to run faster than me, that's for sure.
take this stone.
run as close as you dare, and throw it right in the center. Throw it as hard as you can.
smash it.
you think you can do that?
Yeah, I can do that. - Good.
Mr. Summers: Now!
run!
do it!
come on, for God's sake. Do it!
Hey! Hey!
good boy.
BOBBY: Mr. Summers. Mr. Summers!
Mr. Summers: Shh! It's me.
come on, hurry, boy. Hurry!
what about the dog?
don't worry about him. Look.
I told you I've been here before. Come on, hurry!
did I do it right?
Yes, Bobby.
I have to say, you did it very right.
how do you feel?
I feel fine.
I'm a bit tired, I'm really fine.
BOBBY: The first day was the most exciting of all my days with Mr. Summers because of the attack on the lepidopterist's light.
we never did anything else like that, although Mr. Summers had plenty of plans and schemes.
the rest of the time, we walked up and down the narrow, twisty roads, burying the animals the cars had squashed.
curious carving, isn't it?
BOBBY: It's an elephant. - Mr. Summers: That's right. It is.
BOBBY: As our bit of Cornwall got more and more packed with holiday-makers, there were many more cars... many more deaths.
you maniac!
get out of here, lunatic!
it was important work, but sad.
Mr. Summers got crosser and crosser and took to drinking whiskey out of the bottle during the day.
he said awful things about the people in the cars, though I thought they looked quite ordinary.
but he was always very nice to me.
Aw, Mr. Summers, look.
Oh, no.
not a badger.
poor creature.
must have been knocked over last night.
Why?
why, in God's name?
will somebody tell me why?
he's so beautiful, isn't he?
he's big. I had no idea they were this big.
he's too big to bury around here.
we'll collect him in the evening and bury him somewhere special.
need to get him off the road.
come on, Bobby.
pick him up.
that's it.
bring him over here.
let's put him over by the wall.
that's good. He can't be seen from there.
we'll pick him up and we'll bury him later.
bastards.
bloody bastards.
Mr. Summers: Damn it, I made a mistake.
we don't want to be involved in all this. Come on, Bobby.
but it would be nice to get ice-cream, wouldn't it?
all right. Come on.
all right. Yeah.
don't be long. You know I don't much like the beach with the holiday people there.
I'll wait for you here. - Okay.
Thanks, Mr. Summers. Don't worry, I won't be long.
girl: Come on, let's go.
Bobby.
is it really you, Bobby?
where have you been?
Bernard's been looking for you all over the place.
come and have an ice-cream.
no, I've got to get back.
is there someone waiting for you? - Yeah.
no, no. It's just
it's all right. Calm down. Calm down.
let's go and get that ice-cream.
call the office. - Yeah, I'll call them.
why did you run away, Bobby?
I was frightened. - Frightened?
what were you frightened of?
of him.
of him. Of The Fat, my stepfather.
I don't understand.
he was horrible. He killed my pet mouse.
he said he was going to send me away to a hospital, forever.
steady on, Bobby.
I can accept that he's
I mean, not exactly the same sort of person your mother was, but he's not as bad as all that, surely?
two vanilla cones, please.
is that with flakes?
flake? No, no without the flake. Thank you.
without. Two scoops, dear? - Bobby. Come back!
Bobby!
Bobby! Wait!
Bobby!
where am I?
Mr. Summers!
lost.
how could you be so stupid?
Mr. Summers.
Um-hm?
I've got something to tell you.
would this "something" have anything to do with the day you got lost on the beach?
Yes, it would.
but it's not just that.
it's my whole story.
you wouldn't understand unless I tell you my whole story.
that man was.
Mr. Whiteside is his name.
BOBBY: It took ages.
we sat and smoked one cigarette after another while I told him what had happened on the beach with Mr. Whiteside.
I told him all that and went right back to the beginning and told him about my mother, and the store, and The Fat.
I told him about Peter, the mouse and about how The Fat had killed him.
and how frightened I was.
then I told him about getting knocked down by a car in the high street when I was little, and not being well ever since.
I told him about the nurses and the tutors and never having to go to school.
I told him about Dean and running away to Cornwall.
then I asked him if I had to go away.
no, Bobby.
you don't have to go away.
can I keep on with the work?
Yes.
can I live here with you?
Yes, you can.
Mr. Summers...
yeah?
I love you.
but I'm worried about
about
Mr. Whiteside might...
tell The Fat that I'm in this part of the country.
he might try to look for me.
I've already told you that you can stay.
I'm more bothered about the effect all this has had on you.
I'm going out for a walk.
I need time to think about everything you just said.
you do your book or something.
I'll be back in a while.
Mr. Summers: Tell me, Bobby, have you ever wondered why I live like I live and do what I do?
because you love the animals.
Yes, because I love the animals.
and because I believe that they are life.
life equal to ourselves, and not in some lesser
less valuable form.
I also have a story.
I want you to listen carefully.
first of all, there was a young Man.
he went straight from school to work in a bank.
he worked very hard and became manager of the bank.
but this took a long, long, long time, and because he had been working so hard, he hadn't really had time to think about meeting people, having a girlfriend.
he did eventually meet a girl, though.
she was much younger than him and very beautiful.
he fell in love with her.
who could blame him? It was wonderful.
after all these years of nothing but work, to meet a beautiful woman who seemed to admire him so much...
like a reward.
then the man bought a lovely house on the edge of the town.
a big house. A huge garden.
they married and they moved in.
not long after this...
well, the details are unimportant.
he came to understand that the woman he had married was false.
deceiver.
Mr. Summers?
Yes, it was around this time that he became obsessed with his new ideas about animals and he was foolish enough to start talking about them to people he knew.
his wife started to bother him about the garden.
she made him do work even though she knew that he hated tearing out the wild plants and replacing them with bought ones.
she made him kill to protect these new plants.
life got worse and worse for the man.
he felt ill all the time, started making bad mistakes at work.
life felt like...
one long, dark, wet afternoon.
he just wanted to die.
but I couldn't do it, Bobby.
I couldn't kill myself because I knew if I did, then it would be her killing me.
and me dead is what deep down she really wanted.
I couldn't give her the satisfaction.
so...
I killed her.
I suffocated her with a pillow.
but you don't kill.
I did that time, that one time, because it had to be done.
what about the police?
do they know about it?
I don't know.
they didn't find a body, that's for sure.
I burnt it.
and I took a great deal of money from the bank.
I ran away. Just like you, Bobby.
it was the most exciting day of my life.
then I wandered around for a time, all over the country.
finally, I came here.
no, I can manage.
there's something I want to show you.
is that the money you took?
some of it.
three more boxes like this under the wardrobe.
more money that you or I will ever need.
enough so we can live here forever.
or some other place like it.
well, that's brilliant.
not quite. There's still The Fat to be considered.
he's got to be dealt with somehow.
dealt with?
you mean, kill him?
kill him?
no, we're not going to kill him.
now that you know that money will never be a problem, how do you fell about letting The Fat have the store?
for me, all right, I suppose.
but I feel bad about my mother because I know she didn't want it that way.
but if she knew I was living here, and I didn't need the store, or even the house or anything, then I think she might think it's all right to let it go.
you know, because what she wanted was me to be happy, and that's what I am here, with you.
in that case, you and I will go to London to see this man.
I don't know about that.
I've told you what he's like.
he really hates me.
look, we'll see him in his office, at the store.
the staff will be there and his secretary.
what could he possibly do in broad daylight in front of employees?
I think it will work.
I can feel it. I think it will.
you're a genius!
I haven't been in London in over 10 years.
Mr. Summers: That's a really good drawing.
Bobby, Bobby
I can't help it, Mr. Summers, I feel so nervous.
I feel like I'm going to explode.
look, we've been over this again and again.
I understand the state you're in, why you're in that state.
I told you, leave it all to me.
gosh, it's Bobby. Hey, Bobby.
hello.
man: Bobby's back. How strange.
my dear Phillip, goodbye. I'll see you soon.
I look forward to it. And remember, my treat next time.
see you again soon. - Yes.
well, well, look who's back.
how very pleased I am to see you, Bobby.
I'll just be a moment.
Janet. - Janet: Yes, Mr. Bernard?
send them in now. No phone calls, no interruptions, nothing.
I understand.
maybe you are going to introduce this gentleman, Bobby.
this is Mr. Summers.
Mr. Summers, this is my stepfather.
please forgive me, Mr. Summers.
I have to admit this is taking me by surprise.
I began to think I might never see Bobby again.
of course I am most grateful to you for bringing him back to me.
please do sit down.
in fact, you're mistaken.
I haven't brought Bobby back.
he wanted to come back.
he has some matters that he wants to sort out with you.
I'm here to help him.
help him?
in what capacity, may I ask?
nothing official.
please regard me as a concerned friend.
friend?
I assume Bobby has been telling you stories.
he has a lively imagination.
people tend not to take him too seriously.
but he has told me certain things, yes.
And?
Mr. Summers: I'm inclined to take him seriously.
Meaning?
meaning I do believe that I can solve the problem of Bobby for you.
exactly how do you propose to do that, Mr. Summers?
well, Bobby has been living with me in Cornwall since the beginning of the summer.
he has told me that he is happy and that he would like to stay on indefinitely.
he has been very helpful to me, in my work.
Really?
is this true?
Yes, it's true.
I've been working with Mr. Summers.
he's been very kind to me and I haven't felt ill at all.
not really.
well, quite different from how I felt before.
good heavens, the boy can speak.
congratulations, Mr. Summers, your ministrations have clearly born fruit.
but why come to me for permission?
Bobby's a grown up. He can do as he pleases.
the fact of the matter is that Bobby became very anxious after he met Mr. Whiteside on the beach.
he was worried once his whereabouts were known, then you might decide to come looking for him.
well, it was bothering him so much that I suggested to him that he come back on his own accord, and tell you exactly what his new circumstances are.
And?
well, then he told me that he was prepared to consider the possibility of transferring the ownership of Platts...
...to you.
on certain conditions, of course.
is that it?
Yes. Yes, I believe so.
you idiot.
give me Platts?
I've got Platts. Platts is mime.
your running away made that possible.
and now you're back, you pathetic moron
Hey, stop that. Leave him alone!
leave him alone?
you leave him alone, you disgusting pervert.
human rubbish...
unspeakable human rubbish.
get off him!
Mr. Summers! Mr. Summers!
listen to me.
do exactly as I say.
one noise, one twitch, that would arouse anyone's suspicion, and your Mr. Summers is finished. Do you understand?
get him up.
Janet. - Yes?
I need the car, at the back. Straightaway.
Mr. Summers isn't well. I'm taking him to accident and emergency.
Janet: Should I call the hospital?
the Fat: No need to fuss. I'll call you later.
this man's not well. We're taking him to casualty.
all right, Mr. Bernard.
Mr. Summers, wake up!
are we taking him to a hospital?
hardly necessary.
but he's hurt. He needs help.
I think I've changed my mind about Cornwall.
maybe I should let you and Mr. Summers play house after all.
I'd like to see where you've been hiding all these weeks.
the Fat: Is it hard to find?
BOBBY: No, I can find it.
the Fat: He's all right.
he's sleeping like a baby.
can you find his place from here?
well, can you get us there from here?
if you don't tell me, he'll have to, won't he?
I can't carry him all the way by myself.
charming little place, isn't it?
is there anything to drink?
BOBBY: Mr. Summer's whiskey.
it's in there.
get it for me, then.
Mr. Summers.
what a bloody racket.
well, it's light now.
is there a spade here?
is there a spade here?
Why?
I want a hole dug, that's why.
what for?
what's the matter? You can dig, can't you?
I can bury things.
can you? Where's the bloody spade?
there's one outside by the lavatory.
please stay awake.
I love you.
don't die.
please, don't die.
you can't die.
what would I do without you?
don't let them destroy you, Bobby.
don't let him destroy
trick him.
trap him.
kill him.
he would do it.
dig.
the Fat: Dig long and deep.
BOBBY: I thought of running away.
but how could I have left Mr. Summers?
once I started digging,
I didn't really want to stop.
I thought about all sorts of things while I was digging that hole.
I could hear the sea sound, making me think how big the sea was and how small I was.
it seemed that I couldn't really matter since I was so small.
and I thought about the birds and the little animals.
after then, the insects.
after then, there were even smaller things with names I didn't know.
there were trees and plants and grasses, and they were all alive.
Mr. Summers thought all these things mattered.
"if they didn't matter, " he would say, "why were they there? And why were they so beautiful?"
then I thought, if all these things did matter, then maybe I mattered too.
for a little while I felt a bit better.
why have you stopped?
because I finished. - No, you haven't.
I need another hole, just like this one.
that's enough for now. I'm thirsty.
you can leave the spade.
it's just a toad. It's a toad.
it's harmless.
there's nothing to be scared of.
look.
I can pick it up.
it wouldn't hurt anyone.
look.
you little bastard.
stop! There's money. There's lots of money.
money? What money?
Mr. Summer's money. The money that he had. There's lots of it.
how much? 50 pounds? 100 pounds?
I suppose you think 100 pounds is a great deal of money
no, it's thousands. I promise, it's thousands.
where is it then? - Under the wardrobe.
go get it then.
it's locked. The key, where's the key?
it's on Mr. Summer's key ring.
what are you doing?
nothing.
there's more.
down there.
more?
Mr. Summers says there's three more boxes.
down there. Right under the floor.
I hope you're right.
can't you help me?
the Fat!
I hate The Fat!
Mr. Summers! Mr. Summers, I'm back.
Mr. Summers?
I'm back.
can you hear me?
I'm back.
BOBBY: I took as much of Mr. Summer's money as I could carry, then buried the rest in the hole The Fat made me dig for myself.
I had to get away in case people came looking for us after The Fat never came back.
now I do the work alone, all over the place.
wherever I happen to be.
one day I found a traveler's camp.
now I live there with my dog in a tent I bought.
but night after night, in my dreams,
I become something very small in forest of tall grass.
I can hear the sea sound and the bamboo, very loud.
and I can feel Mr. Summers close by...
whispering to me in the dark.
good evening,
the following are the lowest temperature estimates for California citrus areas,
lowest temperatures tomorrow night will be somewhat higher than tonight and only light scattered firing late in the morning should be necessary,

well, the night before l met her, l was in my hotel room on Bunker Hill down in the very middle of Los Angeles, lt was called the Alta Loma, lt was built on a hillside in reverse so that the main floor was on a level with the street,
my room was down on the fifth floor so that my window was on a level with the green hillside, and there was no need for a key,
the window was always open, l'd been going over the plans l'd made, since l'd come here like everyone else in search of fortune, fame, good health and glamorous women,
only l was going to be different,
only l was going to be different, l wasn't here to search for my future, l was here to create it, l'd write the first great novel about this place and everybody who came here from somewhere else,
the Road to Los AngeIes by Arturo Bandini, lt would bring me everything l ever wanted,
now, after five months, l was trying to make a very important decision,
what to do with my last nickel, "Mr, Bandini, it has now been six weeks since you've paid the rent, "Four dollars per is mounting like the national debt, "Either you pay $24, every penny, or pack up and leave,
lt was her sixth note in six weeks,
pretty humiliating,
my landlady was getting more writing done than l was,
she was the kind of woman who increased her height by rising on tiptoe and peering at me over her glasses, -I'd Iike a room. -Do you have a job?
I'm a writer.
I'II be with you in a moment, Mr. Archer.
wrote that.
here. What's your name?
Mrs. Hargraves, why?
for Mrs. Hargraves.
a woman of ineffabIe charm, " with IoveIy bIue eyes and a generous smiIe.
from the author, Arturo Bandini. "
the LittIe Dog Laughed. "
I hate dog stories.
Bandini. Young man, are you a Mexican?
me, a Mexican?
I'm an American, Mrs. Hargraves. And that isn't a dog story, either.
we don't aIIow Mexicans in this hoteI.
I'm not a Mexican, and there isn't a dog in the whoIe story.
we don't aIIow Jews, either.
I got that titIe after the fabIe, you know, " And the IittIe dog Iaughed To see such sport "
so you're an author. How nice.
here we are, Mr. Bandini. This is one of my very favorite rooms.
there are windows on two sides, which makes it extremeIy airy.
it's $4 a week, and I expect to be paid in advance.
now that incIudes cIeaning but no Iaundry. We never do...
through that window, l saw my first palm tree not six feet away, but the palm was blackish at its branches, -And no girIs in the room. -I'II take it.
stained by carbon monoxide coming out of the Third Street Tunnel, its crusted trunk choked with dust and sand that blew in from the Mojave and Santa Ana deserts,
what jerk's gonna believe l made it all the way from Colorado to downtown L, A, without seeing one goddamn palm tree?
kid?
kid?
kid.
do you Iike miIk?
Yes, HeIIfrick. I Iike miIk.
okay, then.
here's the pIan.
the Adohr man's a friend of mine.
every morning at 4: 00, he parks his truck behind the hoteI and comes up to my room for a whiIe.
that's not much of a pIan, HeIIfrick. -No, kid, no.
whiIe he's having one with me, you get 10 minutes to heIp yourseIf to the miIk.
so what do you think?
if he's your friend, why not just ask him for it?
kid, come on. Who's kidding who?
he knows I don't drink miIk. I'm doing this for you.
no, thanks, HeIIfrick. I Iike to consider myseIf an honest man.
it certainIy makes me wonder about your ideas of friendship.
okay.
onIy trying to do you a favor.
you wanna do me a favor? Pay me the money I Ioaned you.
how much was that? -Fifteen cents.
don't have it. -WeII, how about 10 cents? A nickeI?
can't give you any hard cash, kid, but I'II see you get aII the miIk you need.
Mencken, Editor of the greatest magazine in the country,
do you wanna let him down?
good evening, Mr, and Mrs, North and South America and all the ships and clippers at sea, Akron, Ohio,
a big strike in the Goodrich rubber plant here was called off today when workers agreed on a six cent raise in pay per hour,
the condition of Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr, who was hurt today in a motorcar crash near Walpole, Massachusetts, is not serious,
think of something besides steaIing a bottIe of miIk.
you're an author, not a thief.
the streets are full of them, blondes and brunettes,
one in a red fox fur just getting out of a fancy foreign car,
girls in the plaza,
they're everywhere, and none of them mine,
one glance and they know l'm an inexperienced jerk, ignorant of women and life, and afraid of both,
you have nice hands.
I do?
very.
you're ItaIian.
that'II be two cents a day every day it's overdue.
St, Teresa, when l was little, l prayed to you for a fountain pen,
you answered my prayer. Anyway, I got a fountain pen.
now pIease, sweet and IoveIy Saint, inspire me. Give me an idea, so I can write a story, a great story, so I can be rich and famous and not be ashamed of my name.
door is open.
to you, Mencken. To the future.
l headed down Third Street looking for a place to spend my last nickel,
and there it was,
come on. Learn to dance if you can't waIk!
the perfect place to end up flat broke, -Can I get you something? -Coffee with cream.
just five months ago, l had $1 50 in my pocket and big plans in my head, ln those days, l was Arturo Bandini, lover of man and beast alike,
all l needed was to meet one of those beautiful golden-haired girls that seemed to grow like oranges out here, and l'd write a story, a love story, one of the greatest of all time,
who brought this here?
there you go, Tony.
thank you.
are you done with that coffee?
you caII this stuff coffee? Maybe it isn't coffee at aII.
maybe it's just water after they boiIed your fiIthy shoes in it.
maybe you don't know any better. Maybe you're just naturaIIy careIess.
but if I were you, I wouIdn't be seen in a Main Street aIIey wearing those haraches,
it's huaraches, not haraches,
I hope you die of heart faiIure right there on that chair.
it's not my fauIt. I didn't do nothing.
I swear to God, I just asked him if he wanted some coffee!
take care of it.
if he's sick, get him out of here.
Hey.
young feIIow, are you aII right?
you there? Oh, say something, pIease.
you can dish it out, but you can't take it, can you?
you want the nickeI?
then mop it up.
Hey, you!
sand from the Mojave was blowing across the city, lt was everywhere, lt was even between the sheets, but l didn't care,
all l could think about were those huaraches.
to a Mayan princess from a worthless gringo,
what's the name of the girI who works here?
you mean CamiIIa?
the one who was here yesterday. The Mexican.
wiII you give this to her?
take good care of it. It's vaIuabIe. See that Miss Lopez gets it personaIIy.
the truth was, l couldn't afford to go back and see her that night, l didn't have a nickel for a cup of coffee,
what do you want?
I'm an honest man, kid.
there, see if he wants a beer on the house.
sorry about the coffee.
everybody orders beer around here. We don't get that many caIIs for coffee.
I can see why. I'd drink beer, too, if I couId afford it.
anyway, I hope this is better. You want cream, right?
not bad. CertainIy an improvement over Iast night.
did you read " The LittIe Dog Laughed " ?
the LittIe Dog Laughed, " by me, Arturo Bandini.
Bandini. It's ItaIian. Did you read the story?
sure. -So?
it's very good.
Hey, Iisten. You want a beer?
I can get you some. You don't have to pay.
what did you Iike about it?
CamiIIa. -I have to go.
you stiII haven't toId me what you thought.
I toId you. I Iiked it. I Iike dog stories.
you Iike dog stories. -I Iike dogs a Iot...
there's no dog in the story. -There's no dog...
there's no dog in the story!
okay. I heard you.
then why did you caII it " The LittIe Dog Laughter " ?
why did you Iie to me? Why did you just say you read it when you didn't?
listen, kid. PIease, drink your beer.
it's tough enough just to have a good time, okay?
sir! Sir!
forgot your hat.
something eIse you wanted to say? -CamiIIa can't read.
not EngIish, anyway.
and another thing, Mr, Mencken, l have no understanding of women,
how can l write about what l don't understand?
how can l write about experiences l haven't had?
when l first came here, l was so sure of myself,
so sure l wasn't like the others,
the others came to the land of sunshine with just enough money to live until the sun killed them,
take Hellfrick, across the hall, from Minnesota,
gassed in the Great War and gassed ever since,
most of the time, he has no idea where he is,
so, l guess here is as good as anywhere else,
Heilman's a bank teller from South Bend,
but his health is bad and he was told he had to stay here or die,
he hates the sun and the fog and the SC Trojans,
my landlady's from Back East,
she tries to make the hotel lobby look like Bridgeport, Connecticut,
no Mexicans and lots of doilies, -WiII there be anything eIse, ma'am? -No, thank you.
then there's the Filipino houseboy from Hawaii and the redhead from St, Louis, -HeIIo. -HeIIo.
how are you? -Better now.
she's come to feel he's terribly brave in the face of so much prejudice,
the other day when l was going to San Pedro, looking for work at the canneries, l saw them,
even with high leather heels, he was a foot shorter than she was, l don't know where the girl in the red fox fur is from, but you can find her in Bernstein's Fish Grotto with a fresh one every week,
on the other hand, there's the Japanese man who grows his vegetables down on Jefferson, near the sloughs,
Bullet-faced and always smiling, he keeps me alive for a nickel,
you Iike pIums? Good. Good for you.
of course there are others too poor and too unlucky to be allowed to call any place their own,
even for a while,
aII right, amigos, ln the end, we're all strangers here,
maybe the only thing that makes you a Californian is a pair of sunglasses and a four-bit polo shirt, Suddenly, you belong,
Mr. Bandini. You have maiI.
dear Mr, Bandini, with your permission, "l shall remove the salutation and ending of your very long letter "and print it as a short story for my magazine, "lt seems you've done a fine job here, "l think 'The Land of Somewhere Else' would serve as an excellent title, "Check enclosed, Sincerely yours, H, L, Mencken, "P, S, As to your anxieties about your limited experiences "with life in general and women in particular, "it is, alas, a truism that authors generally have less experience "than other men, "This owing to the incontestable fact "that you simply can't be in two places at once, Mr, Bandini, "Either you're in front of the typewriter, writing, "or you're out in the world having experiences, "Therefore, since you need to write and you need to have experiences "to write about, you have to learn to do more with less, "And doing more with less is, in a word, Mr, Bandini, "what writing is all about,

now that you've got a coupIe of bucks, you're mean and stuck-up.
forty cents.
weII, you haven't changed.
you're just the same IittIe Mexican princess, -charming and innocent. -I'm not charming and I'm not innocent.

Oh, yeah? What eIse is he, a concert pianist?
listen, Arturo, you're not the onIy writer in town.
Sammy's a writer? -You'd be surprised.
I'd be surprised if he couId write his name.
do you Iike my car?
how come it's registered to CamiIIa Lombard? Your name's Lopez.
you married? -No.
so what's the Lombard for? -For fun.
sometimes I use it professionaIIy. -As a waitress?

I'm satisfied with my name. -No, you're not.
I am. -You're not.
I am. -You're not.
I am. -You're not.
what's Sammy's Iast name, Johnson or WiIIiams?
pretty much sums up your ambition in Iife, doesn't it? To be Mrs. White?
you can be a reaI son of a bitch, you know that?
are you stiII coId? -No.
the cIiffs keep you warm.
they're Iike a bIanket when you're underneath them.

friends Iike you and Sammy?
look at the fog.
an army of ghosts crawIing on their beIIies.
what are you taIking about?
the fog bank. It creeps in and hugs the water.
you didn't answer my question. -I know what a fog bank is.
and what about you and Sammy?
who are you interested in, me or Sammy?
come on, why don't you teach me how to ride a wave?

Yeah, why not?

of course not.
what are you waiting for?

you're not gonna ride a wave tonight. -Sure I wiII. You show me how.
I'm from CoIorado.
you mean you don't know how to ride a wave?
listen. My technique might be not good for you to Iearn. It's unorthodox.
that's okay. I'd Iike to Iearn from you.
the first thing you gotta do is get to where the waves are.
don't take any chances. Just stay back, stay right there.
I wiII, I promise.
just watch me...

Oh, God. CamiIIa!
Where'd she go? Where'd she go?
FooIed you pretty good!

dear Boy, "of course l should have known you'd have a girlfriend, "ls she very beautiful?
she's very lucky, "ls she also kind and generous?
would she ever allow you to come to Long Beach, if only for an hour?
l woke up relieved to think there were other possibilities in life besides Camilla,
maybe Vera was a little crazy, but like she said about herself, she was a good person,
we'd read the same books, spoke the same language and she was capable of appreciating my writing,
suddenly, l felt better about myself, l was once again, Arturo Bandini, lover of man and beast alike, and afraid of nothing,
Mr. Bandini! Hey! Bandini!
it's Sammy, the bartender at the CoIumbia.
Yeah. Sammy White. -Yeah.
CamiIIa says you've been pubIished. -What of it?
I was thinking about getting into that Iine of work.
PubIishing? -No, writing stories Iike you.
bartending and the damp nights don't seem to agree with me much anymore.
looking to find something I can do pretty much anywhere.
like writing stories.
Yeah, weII, good Iuck to you, Sammy.
Yeah, I was hoping you couId give me a few pointers.
and that magazine with " The LittIe Dog Laughing " in it, you wouIdn't happen to have a spare copy?
I'd sure Iike to read your story.
I know I got one in here somewhere.
thank you, Arturo. It's a reaI honor.
like I said, I was hoping you couId give me some pointers about writing.
if there's anything I can do for you, you Iet me know.
sounds Iike you've got something in mind.
weII, thought you might Iike a IittIe advice about CamiIIa.
that's reaI white of you, Sammy, but I think I can handIe the situation.
okey-dokey.
but you know what they say, " Never a horse that couIdn't be rode, " never a cowboy that couIdn't be throwed. "
and CamiIIa's one tough IittIe pony. She's got a reaI hard mouth on her.
a reaI hard mouth. " Interesting turn of phrase.
you're too nice to that girI, Mr. Bandini.
too nice? -Way too nice.
you don't understand Mexican women.
Oh, Mexican women are different. -No, sir.
they're Iike most women, except more so.
you Iet up on them, they're aII gonna take advantage.
but you ease up on that IittIe spic, she gonna peg you for a IiIy-Iivered gringo and buck you out of the saddIe before you're in it.
a horse with a hard mouth don't feeI the bit, Arturo.
so, keep them on a tight rein, never Iet them forget who's boss for a second. No trick to it.
ride them hard and it's easy.
weII, Sammy, sounds Iike you know your horsefIesh.
Yeah, I hope so, Arturo.
I'm gonna write Westerns.
by the way, amigo,
CamiIIa's one pony who's worth the ride.
I'm gIad to see you.
Why?
okay.
Sammy toId me you were reaIIy nice to him.
I was beginning to think you couIdn't be nice to anyone.
can I get you something? -Where is Sammy tonight?
he Ieft. -Went home?
to the desert for a whiIe. He hasn't been feeIing reaI good.
what's the matter with him? -CamiIIa.
tb, I think.
here. You can start with this.
Sammy has tubercuIosis. -Yeah. Tough break, huh?
we aII gotta go.
what are you taIking about?
he won't Iive Iong. -How dare you say something Iike that!
so how are aII your other boyfriends?
I haven't got any other boyfriends!
sure. Forgive an incautious remark.
couId I have the check?
no charge. It's on Sammy.
you don't have to pay to be a smart aIeck.
besides, if it cost more than haIf a buck, you couIdn't afford to be one.
you're very funny. Sammy writing your diaIogue?
why do you have to be so mean?
mean? Me?
I'm anything but mean.
Papa?
tell me a story. - Alright. What about?
I don't know. About everything.
everything?
very well, then.
creation
in Tierra del Fuego, land of fire...
a blighted and loveless country on the Earth's furthest rim, lives a community of the dirtiest, most vulgar, least civilised people you can possibly imagine.
they appeared almost entirely naked with their hair all the way down to their bottoms.
they never washed their hands or their faces, even before dinner.
one day, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to meet them.
thank you.
not long now. I shall be with you presently. Head to me, please.
very good. Now, very still, please. No fidgeting.
and above all, no smiling.
excuse me, sir? - Hmm?
will this hurt? - Oh, no, no, no.
it is only a beam of light.
Papa? - Hmm?
how can light make a picture?
well, they take a copper plate and they prepare it with chemicals, and these chemicals are activated by the light that reflects back from your face, and so the silver sticks to the places where the light is brightest. Understand?
Yes.
sorry. So sorry. - No, thank you.
go on. He went ashore to meet them. - Yes, that's right.
so, erm, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to interview the Fuegians.
now.
he offered them some axe heads, some calico, and very pretty buttons.
total value, probably two shillings.
this is yours. You take it.
look how it... Look how it glisters. See?
and all he asked in return?
a few spare children.
you give me el ni? A.
to the Fuegians, children were cheap and buttons were precious, so it wasn't long before the Fuegians had their trinkets and Captain Fitzroy had his three children.
he named them Boat Memory... Jemmy Button and Fuegia Basket.
come here, you dirty little beggar!
the good captain had them washed and dressed, and he taught them the proper table manners.
boat Memory died of smallpox, but the two littlest ones, they learned their prayers and their times-tables so excellently that they were invited to meet the King and Queen.
everyone agreed that good Christian values had tamed the most savage of hearts.
the King gave Jemmy a genuine brass telescope and the Queen gave Fuegia one of her Sunday best bonnets to keep for ever.
two years later, Captain Fitzroy and I took them home, accompanied by a young missionary, in the belief that, by example, they would bring their fellow savages to God.
and what do you think happened?
it didn't work.
that's right. Of course it didn't work!
go after them, you fool! Get them now. - Jemmy! Fuegia!
put your clothes back on! Come back!
it was a complete and total failure.
no, no, no!
quite still, didn't I say? You shall have to do it all over again.
- So sorry. So badly behaved. So sorry.
Mr. Darwin, sir?
come on, Mr. Darwin, or your dinner will be spoiling.
Mr. D will be in presently, ma'am. I imagine.
thank you, Mr.s Davies. - Is Papa unwell again?
he's always unwell these days. - He is not, Franky.
maybe he caught something awful from the Hottentots.
nanny Brodie said God was angry with him.
Brodie said no such thing. - Yes, she did!
good evening. - Good evening, Papa.
sorry I'm so late.
soup du jour, sir.
thank you, Parslow.
lord God, bless this family and the food we eat.
we ask in Thy name. Amen. - Amen.
I hear Mr. Hooker is coming tomorrow.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
did he say what it was about?
I'm not sure that now's the time to discuss it.
perhaps the time to discuss it was before you invited him.
well, quite possibly, but he... He invited himself.
sorry.
tell Mr.s Davies it was delicious, but my...
my stomach's still not quite what it... it should be. Forgive me.
can we go fishing? - Can we pick gooseberries?
october 17th, 1858.
passed a poor night. Stomach still wretched.
noticed a slight tremor in right hand.
consider increasing laudanum by ten per cent, perhaps.
we'll sacrifice the two tumblers. I want to skeletonise them.
Yes, sir.
selective breeding is undoubtedly working.
already seeing real changes in wing structure.
I'm convinced that all fancy breeds, pouter, carrier, tumbler et cetera, derive from the common rock pigeon.
nature selects for survival, man for appearance.
must improve skeletonising methods. Consider aqua regia, quicklime, perhaps.
they'll need a few more hours, those, sir.
master George! Master Franky! Lady Etty and Master Lenny. How are you, sir?
sir? - Thank you.
anything else, sir?
no, no, no, you... carry on. I'll clean myself up.
is it true that he only let you go if you married his fattest daughter?
absolutely true, George, but don't you dare tell my wife.
dear Joseph. - Dearest Emma.
- Ah. Yes. Forgive the short notice.
you know Thomas Huxley? - Only by reputation.
he insisted on coming. - It's a lie.
I have a question for your esteemed, reclusive husband and I didn't trust Hooker to ask it for me.
I see. Children, tell Papa his visitors are here.
he already knows. - He's hiding.
do come in, please.
can we play Charge of the Light Brigade?
you must be exhausted. Will you take tea?
hooker! My dear fellow! And Huxley. Do come in. Come in.
lead the charge, boys. And away we go.
we're re-forming the Linnean Society.
the committee will comprise of myself,
Lyell, Hooker, yourself, of course, if you're game for it.
now that Hooker and I finally have a bit of clout, we can start to reclaim science as a profession.
wrest it away from the country parsons and beetle collectors.
some of whom are friends. - Your book will be our rallying point.
no, it won't. There is no book.
there are fragments, and they're not in any fit state to publish.
I've read your abstract and the argument is hugely powerful.
clear evidence of transformation over millions of years from a free-swimming prawn to a shellfish stuck on a rock.
that's my point. You can't be sure of that, and that's why I need more time.
Mr. Darwin, sir? - Yes?
either you are being disingenuous or you do not fully understand your own theory.
evidently, what is true of the barnacle is true of all creatures, even humans.
the Almighty can no longer claim to have authored every species in under a week.
you've killed God, sir.
you have killed God.
or to put it another way...
and I say good riddance to the vindictive old bugger!
Charles? Charles? - Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Thomas, please. - Yes, I quite understand.
it is time to write your book.
strike hard and fast with a blow that is utterly conclusive.
really, sir, you...
you talk as if we're at war.
Yes. Science is at war with religion, and when we win, we'll finally be rid of those damned archbishops and their threats of eternal punishment.
no, Mr. Huxley, we...
we live in a society and it is a society bound together by the Church.
an improbable sort of barque, I grant you, but at least it floats.
it floats. And you would what?
you would have us all rebuild, plank by plank, the very vessel in which we sail?
Oh, come, come, Charles! Did... Did God's laws change your Fuegians?
was Jenny the ape any less personable for not being a person?
our behaviour, like our physical forms, evolves according to our needs.
your very own words, sir!
and thus, in time, we lose those parts that are no longer required.
like the appendix, the male nipple, and finally, thank Christ, our belief in an utterly redundant Almighty!
Mr. Hooker?
I... implore you, please do not push him.
no one can push Charles. You know how fixed he is.
bit of a barnacle himself, really. - Yes.
and if you prise him from his rock, he will die.
come on, Hooker. It'll be dark soon.
so, what did she say to you?
she said it was killing him.
Yes. Mighty slow death considering the length of time he's sat on this stuff.
we shall all be dead and buried ourselves if he takes much longer.
Yes, since his girl died, one has to admit... he's not the man he was.
when are you going to be done with those stinky old barnacles?
well, I've been chasing this little crustacean in all of its evolutionary forms over 30 million years.
now, eight years doesn't seem a very long time to achieve that, does it?
what does "procrastinating" mean?
Oh, I think you know very well what it means, Annie.
it means putting things off. Why?
that's what Mr. Hooker thinks you're doing.
does he indeed?
is it because of Mama or what's in that box?
both.
I should probably just burn the lot. - You can't. I'm in it.
don't be absurd! Of course you're not.
what do you mean? - When I was a baby, you said.
Oh, that. - The Natural History of Babies.
Yes, that's right.
look at my finger.
Oh, you're so strong! You're so strong!
here. Annie.
I think that will not help her sleep.
I'm sure you're probably right.
who's that?
who is that? Is that you?
Oh, sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, what a mean old papa you have.
Oh, sweetheart!
Oh, what a mean old papa you have!
what a mean old...
what a mean old man you have!
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
six weeks: Gurgles.
tries to suck. Holds tight to my finger.
perceives bosom when three or four inches from it.
I should add that she's musical.
I hope you do not plan to treat all our children as specimens of the ape genus to be included in your experiments.
all of our children? You mean you want more?
Oh, sorry. I assumed.
no, if the idea doesn't appeal, then we won't have any more children.
darling, I have plans to breed an entire army of them.
look at that. That's called the waltz.
careful, now! Not too far ahead.
make yourself useful, Hooker. - Stay away from that water!
fear not, Brodie, I have them in my sights. Children!
now, which of the four of you would be the first who would like to learn how to hook a worm?
me! Me!
a little further on, the leading Highlander snuffed the wind like a setting Spaniel, and then made a signal to his party again to halt.
he stooped down upon all fours, wrapped up in his plaid...
look what I found, Mama. - Look at that.
what shall I feed it? - Let's ask Reverend Innes.
a leaf, I should think. Necrophorus humator, isn't he, Charles?
rather a splendid specimen. - Yes, he is. He's a... carnivore.
he eats carrion and insects.
boys! We need carrion and insects!
look, here's a worm, here's a worm.
an earwig! Squish it! - No, don't kill it.
I know that expression.
he's dreaming of his glory days when he was unencumbered with wife and family.
free to wander the planet.
actually, I was... I was remembering how the tropical seas teemed with living particles that seemed to surround the Beagle with a luminous glow and leave a glistening pathway through the night.
puzzling. So much beauty for so little purpose.
so little purpose? They were helping to light the ship's way.
well said. Exactly.
John, are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus?
he married his first cousin. - So did I.
Yes, but I wasn't suggesting that... - Of course you weren't.
anyway, Thomas Malthus calculated that if, well, if every trout, say, had a hundred or so offspring and so on and so forth throughout the generations, we'd be knee-deep in trout in just a few decades.
how would you respond to that?
I'd respond by saying that most of the eggs are destroyed or eaten so that the numbers remain stable. That's the beauty of God's plan.
it doesn't strike you as a wasteful plan, these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished?
they provide food for others. - Cheese and cucumber?
thousands die so that only a few may live.
is not the sum total of happiness in some sort of massive deficit?
Charles, it is really not my duty to speculate on the mind of God, but it does seem to me that nature is at peace.
there is another view. That all of nature is a battlefield.
remind me where I read that.
this is very good. - Good. Shall I continue?
hmm, please do.
in a short time, he returned, and dismissed his attendants, excepting one, and intimating to Waverley that he must imitate his cautious way...
now, thought Christian, 'What shall I do?"'
and ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises that Christian was forced to put up his sword and betake himself to another weapon called All Prayer.
let us stop there.
is Papa not coming to kiss us goodnight?
he is a little unwell from working. Maybe tomorrow.
you said that last night.
I think when Annie died, he stopped loving us.
no, Etty.
he's just a little bit tired and a little bit busy.
Goodnight, darling.
what are you doing, Annie? - I'm making you beautiful.
but I need to think.
what are you so scared of?
it's only a theory. - No, they're right.
it changes everything.
suppose the whole world stopped believing that God had any sort of plan for us.
that nothing mattered. Not love, not trust.
not faith, not honour.
only brute survival.
apart from anything else, it would break your mother's heart.
hearts can't break, silly. You told me that.
breathe in, Papa. Breathe out.
tell me a story. - Alright. What about?
about Jenny.
it's late. I have no time. - Please?
why Jenny? It's so sad. - I like sad stories.
once upon a time, there was a family of orang-utans living in the deepest jungles of Borneo.
their eldest daughter was the most loving, the most caring, and the most trusting orang of all.
but she was also the most...
intelligent.
well, I was going to say inquisitive.
did I neglect to mention she was not always the most obedient of creatures?
by the time she realised her danger, it was too late.
they put her in a bag and they carried her off...
much to her loving parents' despair.
so sorry. Much to her loving parents' despair, of course. And the Dayaks bundled her into a cage and set off to sell her down the river.
they sold her to a trader for threepence, three farthings, and he put her in a bigger cage and sold her to London Zoo for 300 guineas.
she was the first orang-utan that anyone had ever seen in England.
everyone peered at Jenny, and Jenny peered back, and she marvelled at what strange creatures they all were.
the curators of the zoo, they... they cleaned her up...
made her presentable for polite society.
which was when I was first introduced to her.
what is that, Jenny?
Oh, come on.
Bravo!
when eventually it came time to say goodbye, she grew quite downcast and refused to shake my hand.
finally, she took it, but only after I'd made her a promise
I was never able to keep: That I would visit her again very soon.
go on. Tell me about the bit where she gets sick and dies.
why do you want to hear that bit? - I like it. It makes me cry.
huxley is of the opinion that I should write and be done with it.
says it's a question of moral courage, or of...
or rather my lack of it.
did you tell him about your health?
his theory is that I'm making myself ill by holding back, and... that I should lance the boil, so to speak.
thank the Lord he's no longer a surgeon.
I have concluded that he's right.
you know, bite the gag. Speed is everything.
it will all be over in a matter of months.
it is not mere months...nor even years nor decades that concern me, Charles.
do you really care ... so little for your immortal soul?
Charles... do you not care that you may never pass through the gates of heaven and that you and I may be separated for all eternity?
well, of course I care. Of course I do.
what do you think has kept me in limbo all these years?
I am a neuter bee.
I'm a scientist, and I dare not study for the fear of seeing more clearly what is already as plain as day to me.
do you not think that's torture enough?
I think you are at war with God, Charles.
we both know it is a battle you cannot win.
give me the ball! - No, you cheated!
curse you, woman! - You cheated!
Etty!
Etty, Etty, Etty!
were you never married, Brodie? - Myself? No.
he went off to Australia. I missed my chance.
I shall never marry.
I know how men give you babies.
I sincerely hope you do not, Annie Darwin!
everybody step back and look at the rock.
if you look at it, really look at it, it can take us back through time.
see these greyish, muddy layers?
they were brought here by quiet, patient, gentle rivers, whereas these dramatic sandstone deposits are telling us of huge storms, storms that came through here millions of years ago when Aunt Sarah was just a little girl and Down Village was a swamp full of dinosaurs.
what's a dinosaur? - It's a lizard...
professor Owen invented them. - He didn't exactly invent them.
they weren't real! - Yes, they were.
put some clothes on! You're going blue.
look what I found! Spiny starfish! Don't tell me.
Marthasterias gacialis, look!
Glacialis.
I am Fuegian!
I'm making custard!
he did, he told me!
it is not fair to the other children, nor to Annie herself, that her head be filled with these ideas.
but Daddy said! - I will leave you to deal with this.
he did, he told me! - Hush.
goodbye, Annie.
what happened?
nothing.
your knees. What happened to your knees?
Reverend Innes had to have words with her.
what happened to her knees?
Reverend Innes sent me to the corner and made me kneel on rock salt.
Why? - I said there were dinosaurs, and he said there weren't. But you found them!
Where's my coat? - Take her to the kitchen, will you?
Where's my coat?
he told her to kneel until she repented, so the marks are a result of her own stubbornness.
she contradicted him repeatedly. - Listen to yourself. Emma!
how dare he torture our children for expressing the truth?
it is not the truth as he sees it. - Damn how he sees it!
must our children be revolutionaries at nine years of age?
he is teaching them to deny the evidence of their own senses.
no more than I have told them at bedtime.
it is the instruction of our parents and grandparents.
it's what all of the village believe, or try to.
Charles, Reverend Innes is a dear friend and neighbour.
please, do not set yourself against him.
I beg you.
for you.
not for him.
all things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small. All things wise and wonderful The Lord God made them all
let us pray.
lord God... we know the world is governed by Thy plan...
extending to the merest creatures Thou hast made, such that even a sparrow falls not to the ground without Thy will.
teach us that all misfortune, all sickness and death, all the trials and miseries of which we daily complain...
are intended for our good...
being not the whims of an uncaring universe...
but the corrections of a wise... and affectionate parent.
teach us this in Thy name, O Lord.
Amen. - Amen.
the lesson today is taken from the Book of Genesis.
chapter one, verses 26 to 30. - Sorry.
excuse me. I'm so sorry. - And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over all the cattle and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth.
dearest Emma, last night you said I was at war with God, but truly it is nothing so dramatic as a war, just a silent struggle with myself extended over a thousand afternoons.
the loss of religious faith is a slow and fragile process, like the raising of continents.
what can I say to you except that the process now seems complete?
what are we looking at? - See the rabbit?
stay very still.
make it stop.
quickly, Daddy, make it stop.
quickly! - Etty. Etty, darling.
daddy, make it stop. - Ssh. Darling girl.
dear girl.
dear sweet girl. - It's not fair!
it's not fair! - I'm sorry.
not fair. - It's not fair.
Etty, it has to be that way.
the fox has to eat the rabbit, otherwise the fox's babies will die.
it's the balance of things.
come on, little duck. Give us a smile.
dear Hooker, I am finally decided.
I think I owe it to my children to at least have the courage of my own convictions.
my title will be "On the Origin of Species," and I shall endeavour to keep God out of it, although no doubt He will see it as a personal attack.
nothing is easier than to admit the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult than to constantly bear this in mind.
I shall devote my first chapter to variations under domestication, wherein we will see how great is the power of man in accumulating slight variations.
I will then pass on to see how natural selection causes much extinction... of the less-improved forms of life.
Charles? - Yes?
what is Lewis making?
he's making a water tower like the one they have at Malvern.
the writing's not been going well, so I thought I might try my own water cure.
you're still angry with me.
I can always tell by your playing.
not angry. Sad.
pull.
the face of nature may be compared to a yielding surface with 10, 000 sharp wedges packed close together and then driven inwards by incessant blows.
sometimes one wedge being struck and then another with great force.
the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term a hundred million years.
it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations.
we forget how largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey.
thus, over tens of thousands of generations, tiny variations accumulate.
organs change their very function.
the female sexual organ becomes a cement gland.
limbs become blind feelers or fall away entirely.
what was once a free-swimming creature finds itself glued by its head to a rock, blindly flailing for food.
Papa!
why is sweating supposed to be good for you?
because it gets rid of the poisons in your blood.
I thought you didn't believe in sin. - I don't.
not in the way Reverend Innes understands it, anyway.
then why are you afraid of going to hell?
I'm not. - Yes, you are.
you think you deserve it. - No, I don't.
of course I don't. What could possibly make you think that?
because you think you should never have had me.
Oh, for God's sake, girl.
Oh, I don't have to listen to this nonsense.
you're cruel. You're just being cruel. The girl's gone mad.
that's why you won't talk to Mama any more.
enough of this. I talk to her. Of course I talk to her.
not about the important things. Not about me!
why must everything be about you? - That's what you won't talk about.
what? - How you think you're responsible.
get out of here.
you get out of here. Get out of here.
you said honesty was the most important thing in the world.
if you won't be honest, I won't come again. It'll serve you right!
get out! Please, get out! Get out!
you have not been well for months now.
I'll be fine. I'm fine.
will you talk to John Innes? - What about?
whatever it is that ails you. - What is he now, exactly? What is he?
he's a physician, is he? - Yes. A physician of souls, anyway.
talk to him as a friend. You used to be such friends.
I think he can help you.
Mr. Darwin? Excuse me.
little 'un coming through. Ah, Mr. Darwin.
I was just explaining to Mr. Goodman about your interest in breeding.
Oh, good. Excellent.
Mr. Goodman is our foremost pigeon fancier in all of southern England.
I swear, he can give you any beak or plumage within four generations.
what's your secret? - I interbreed them.
brother and sister, cousin with cousin.
it's the fastest way to alter the strain.
there's a danger that you'll weaken it, but a gentleman like yourself,
I'm sure you can afford to lose a few chicks, eh?
now, plenty of rest, young lady.
down you go.
keep her warm.
thank you, Doctor. - Goodbye, Annie.
goodbye.
unfortunately, if we let them run wild on the beach, we have to expect the consequences, do we not, Mr.s Darwin?
so, increase the calomel to twice... - I will not give her any more of it.
why not? - She's been taking it for weeks.
can you not see she's not... - It is chloride of mercury.
I've prescribed it often in babies. - Not to any of mine.
if she would submit to being bled... - Please, no.
I will write to Dr Gully again. - The hydrotherapist?
I have found his treatments very effective.
no matter that they defy logic? - Logic isn't everything.
clearly not.
I'll see myself out. Good day, madam. - Good day.
I should take her to Malvern to be treated as I was.
it is better she's here.
she needs her family. She needs love and rest.
she'll get well.
one more week.
we'll watch her for one more week. Alright?
thank you.
Papa!
post for you, sir.
this one's from the Spice Islands.
Charles.
Charles, my old friend, there you are. May I join you?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Mr.s Darwin has told me about the book you are writing.
Oh, no, no, not any more. Thank goodness.
you mean you finished it?
it's been finished for me, actually.
a Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace has arrived independently at exactly the same opinion.
expressed in a...
in a mere 20 pages.
now, there's brevity for you.
I had covered 250 so far and come to a dead end, so whilst having wasted 20 years on the project, I am at least rid of it.
well.
well...
the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
hmm, yes, He does, doesn't he?
you know, I was remarking only the other day how He has endowed us in all of His blessed generosity with not one but 900 species of intestinal worm, each with its own unique method of infiltrating the mucosa and burrowing through to the bloodstream.
and on the love that he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp that lays its eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars.
I have said on many occasions, it is not for us to speculate at His reason.
no, we can leave that to Mr. Wallace.
shall I advise him to stay abroad, do you think?
with his opinions, if he shows his face around here, he may be required to kneel on rock salt.
I always valued our friendship.
until now, I regarded you as one of those rare mortals with whom one could disagree and yet feel no shade of animosity.
sadly, that feeling is... no longer reciprocated.
what?
I'm forestalled by Wallace.
what have I done? What?
what possible... What possible reason could you have to be angry at me?
Annie.
Annie! Annie! Come here! Come back!
come back here now!
I am your father! You... You come back here! What?
what did I do? What did I do to you? What?
Annie! C-Come here! Come back!
what did I do to you? Please! Annie, please!
come here! Annie! Annie! Come here!
get rid of them.
get rid of all of them.
come on. Get out!
get out!
go! Come on!
get out! Go!
go!
Mr. Darwin. Mr.... Mr. Darwin.
Mr. Darwin, sir!
Mr. Darwin?
I'll have Lewis dismantle it, sir.
now, Mr. Darwin, I'll send for Dr Holland.
God, no.
God damn it.
damn it all to hell.
Mr. Darwin?
help me here! Help me here!
so, increase the calomel to twice a day.
Yes, of course. - Keep him warm, plenty of rest...
I think Papa's going to die, too.
Oh. Hello, Hooker. Hello.
still talking.
that's good. Word had reached London you'd suffered an apoplectic stroke.
your enemies are celebrating at the Athenaeum.
I have no enemies.
this is the Wallace letter? - Yes.
well, he has 20 pages.
you have a whole book, or at least half of one.
I intend to extract the other even if it kills us both.
have you been talking to Huxley again?
no. Had I been, he'd be here himself with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Up you come.
no, I cannot. I know not what ails me, but it's more than I can endure.
bosh! You have had this illness as long as I have known you.
it's worse in times of overwork, but it has nothing to do with your soul, wherever that resides now.
go and get yourself treated. - I cannot.
believe me, you do have enemies.
I'll bet half the nation would see you burnt at the stake if they knew what you were writing, but you have friends, too, and all of us are fighting the same battle.
and we can win this in our lifetimes. We have to win this.
I implore you, go to Malvern, take your blessed water cure, come back and win it for us.
she's nearly ready. - Thank you. Move those quickly, please.
I want to come with you. - No.
Malvern's not so far. - Parslow! It's two days by coach.
what if the baby comes early? - They have doctors there.
your job is here with the children. - They also need their father.
I can't care about the other children now. I can only care about Annie!
mind her shawl, make sure it's tucked in.
alright, thank you. Thank you. Alright, little frog.
I made these. It's Annie's favourite. - Thank you.
you will see your mama when you're well again.
Brodie, get aboard. - No! No!
say goodbye, now. - No, I don't want to say goodbye!
say goodbye now. - No, I'm going with you.
I'm going with you. Wait there! Wait for me!
go! Go now.
walk on.
Mr. Darwin, old friend. Mr. Darwin.
how long has it been? I haven't clapped eyes on you since...
well... So, what have we now? What have we now?
tongue? Hmm-hm.
shirt up. Let me feel your liver.
right. Up.
pulse hectic, tongue furred, liver tender and enlarged.
and obviously you've been exercising your brain every hour that God gave you.
I have been writing a book. - Madness!
there are far too many of those already.
are you sleeping? - Poorly.
and I suppose never taking the 50c dilution of Chelidonium?
I had my carpenter build a water tower. It no longer has any effect.
of course not! Your carpenter isn't a hydrotherapist.
what on Earth possessed you? - I feared I was dying.
Oh, come, come, come. We shall not have that talk here.
a sharp spinal scrub, cold douche daily at 7: 00am, and sweating by the lamp.
no red meat, no reading, no mental agitation of any kind.
we shall soon have you right, Mr. Darwin. We shall soon have you right.
Papa? I think I'm feeling better now. Honestly.
Papa!
sir, I kneel before You in all humility.
if it is in your power, God, to save her...
then I will believe in You for the rest of my days.
take me, if You must take someone, but not her. She...
she's such a good little girl, you see. She...
I ask this in the name of Your child and mine and in the name of all children.
thank you. Amen.
with what do you most associate these symptoms? Eating?
strong emotion? Physical exertion?
any particular action?
is... Is memory an action? - Memory of what?
my daughter. - Of course.
you must accept there was nothing more to be done.
Oh, dear fellow... she is in heaven.
Yes, that's what my wife believes.
it is a great consolation to her.
but not you?
she and I are divided on it.
were you always? - No.
only since Annie died.
whoa, there.
Charles, I'm... I'm so very sorry about Annie.
where is she? - In the Lady Chapel.
thank you. Thank you.
since that time, she has sought refuge in religion, and I in science.
has this division... affected your marital relations?
we have none any more... to speak of.
perhaps that's for the best.
Meaning?
our last baby...
baby Ch... Baby Charlie. He barely survived beyond infancy and...
are you familiar with the writings of de Quincey?
Yes, I... I've read him.
I have no time for the man.
he maintains that certain thoughts can reside in our mind...without us being aware of them.
they then may manifest as boils and fainting spells... and ghosts.
it's po... It's possible, yes.
Annie is buried here in Malvern, is she not?
Yes. - And have you yet visited the grave?
I really do not wish to discuss this. - Of course...
what possible bearing can it have? - It has every bearing.
that is your opinion. Your treatments have been effective. I feel cured.
I think not, sir.
I think you're not yet cured.
do you have faith, Mr. Darwin? - What?
you say you take no comfort from religion, but do you have faith?
until you do, all the waters in the world will not be the cure of you.
Annie?
Annie! Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
good evening. - Good evening.
I'm Mr. Darwin. I lodged here some time ago.
room number 12, wasn't it?
Yes, it was.
I would only be ten minutes or so.
first floor.
last room on the right. - Yes, I remember.
thank you.
I have the embrocation.
does she want for anything else? - No, I'm sure that will do admirably.
alright. Alright, little one.
here we go. Now, then.
just rub this on.
how's that? Better? - Yes.
dearest Emma, I think it best for you to know how each day passes.
doctor Gully's treatments are having some effect at last.
I will write again tomorrow, but in the meantime...
the surgeon came today to draw off Annie's water.
this did not hurt her, and seemed to give much relief.
I asked if there was any immediate threat to her life, but he believes she has turned the corner.
my Emma, Annie rallied yesterday.
for a moment, I was foolish with delight, but now, suddenly, our dear child has taken a turn for the worse.
this last attack was first thought to be of the smallest importance but rapidly assumed the form of a low and dreadful fever.
she talks a great deal, but we can seldom make out anything.
look, Mama, I'm a general!
much of what she says we cannot make out from the roughness of her poor mouth.
we sponged her with water and vinegar. - There we are.
made her sweet with chloride of lime. - Alright.
gully thinks our poor, sweet child is in imminent danger.
is that better, my darling? Is that better?
beautifully good.
I'm making custard.
my darling Emma, I miss you, terribly. More now than ever.
I often think of the precious looks Annie gives you.
you were always the tenderest of human beings to her and comfort her so on all occasions.
this dreadful alternation of hope and no hope sickens the soul.
I feel we must prepare ourselves for the worst.
tell me about Jenny.
what about Jenny?
ab... About how she dies.
please, Papa. I like it.
well... what the keeper told me was this.
when she was very sick with pneumonia, lying very still...
he tried to feed her with a spoon.
but she shook her head and she looked at him as if to say...
that's very sweet of you. Really.
we're beyond that now.
and the keeper was much moved by the gentleness of the little ape.
and as he bent down to comfort her, she brought her arms up around his neck...
and looked into his eyes in the most human fashion.
and then she laid her head against him...
and died.
Oh, my darling girl, my darling girl!
sorry.
so sorry I startled you.
goodness, Charles. Take off your coat.
you're dripping wet. - Emma, we need to talk.
I went back to Worcester Road.
I saw Annie.
you're hurting my arm.
I need to make you understand... - I do not want to hear it.
I am glad you're feeling better. - You're not listening.
I need you to listen or you will never understand.
I understand perfectly. Do you think that I am deaf and blind?
you've lived with her and spoken with her every day since she died.
she is more real to you than we are.
she is dead, Charles. - I know she's dead.
she is dead!
what in God's name is wrong with you?
why can you not leave our poor girl in her grave?
you're the one who wants to keep her alive, but on a cloud, dancing with little fairies.
I will not listen to this! - In a night shift and snowy wings!
is that how her death was for you, Emma?
something gutted of darkness? - Get away from me.
away from you? There is a gulf between us!
we're like some, some survivors of some shipwreck.
Yes! Yes, because of you! You've torn everything apart!
how? How? How? - With your cruel theories!
with the truth, Emma! Just with the truth!
open the door! Open the... Open the door!
open this door! Open it!
what do you want from me?
I want us to be honest with each other.
about what?
about this... nagging belief that you have nurtured.
that what? - That I killed her.
I never said that. - But you think it, so you must say it.
and say everything else that follows, that I should have kept her warm that day on the beach, that...
I should never have taken her to Malvern without you.
I should have waited for you. I... I should have.
these are your thoughts, Charles.
they are not mine.
I was on the beach.
and I let you go.
I knew, when you left for Malvern...that I would never see her again.
and I hated you.
I hated you for taking her, Charles.
but I was her mother.
and what was I thinking? I could have insisted.
I should have followed you up there.
I let her go.
that's the truth.
and more than anything...
I have...
hated... myself.
perhaps...
perhaps we should never have married.
our blood was too close.
you see, Emma... I thought that we were making the perfect child.
but perhaps instead we endowed her with the weakness that killed her.
I just... wanted to be with you so very much.
the fact... of it is...
knowing everything I now know...
I would marry you again tomorrow, my love.
the affinities of all beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree.
the green and budding twigs may represent existing species, and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species.
so, I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the Earth, while covering the surface with its...
the frameworks of bones have been the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of a porpoise and leg of a horse at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive...
it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us.
advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin, and bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I quivered.
hello. - Hello.
I was wondering if I might, might take over.
alright.
where were you?
I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high.
not the book.
please, a true story.
like you did with Annie.
alright. Let me think.
did I ever tell you about my riding with gauchos?
Yes. - Yes.
or the time our ship was struck by Saint Elmo's fire?
Yes. - My attempt to climb the Andes?
Yes. - Earthquakes?
Yes. - Tidal waves?
Really? I did? - Yes.
goodness gracious, I think I've told you everything.
and yet I fancy
I have never told you about the giant sloth of Punta Alta.
no.
alright, then. Millions and millions of years ago, in a rich and verdant land that we now call Argentina...
there lived a mammal.
there lived a mammal as large as an elephant, as gentle as a lemur and as slow as an incredibly slow snail.
and he lived a happy life watching the slow green march of the passing seasons.
er... I've finished.
I've finished.
you decide. - About what?
well, about what should be done with it.
someone needs to take God's side in all of this.
I'd much rather it was you than Innes.
supposing I think it should be destroyed?
well... then you must do what you think is right.
read it first.
Emma?
well, you said it was my decision.
Emma, where... Where are you going?
to John Murray publishers.
do I have it right?
Yes.
and so... you have finally made an accomplice of me.
may God forgive us both.
good morning, Jim. - Morning, Mr. Darwin, sir.
that parcel for me? - Yes. Yes, it is.
thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of higher animals, directly follows.
there is grandeur in this view of life, that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning, endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.
Sméagol!
I've got one!
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!
pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.
Déagol!
Déagol?
Déagol.
give us that, Déagol, my love.
Why?
because...
...It's my birthday and I wants it.
my precious.
they cursed us.
murderer.
"murderer" they called us.
they cursed us and drove us away.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gollum.
and we wept. precious.
we wept to be so alone.
and cool so nice for feet
and we only wish to catch a fish
so juicy sweet
and we forgot the taste of bread...
...the sound of trees...
...the softness of the wind.
we even forgot our own name.
my precious.
wake up!
wake up!
wake up, sleepies.
we must go, yes.
we must go at once.
haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
I've gone and had too much.
must be getting late.
no.
it isn't.
it isn't midday yet.
the days are growing darker.
come on!
must go! No time!
not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.
no time to lose, silly.
here.
what about you?
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread.
Sam.
all right.
we don't have that much left.
we have to be careful or we're going to run out.
you go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
I've rationed it.
there should be enough.
for what?
the journey home.
come, Hobbitses.
very close now.
very close to Mordor.
no safe places here.
hurry.
it's good.
definitely from the Shire.
Longbottom Leaf.
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.
green Dragon. -A mug of ale in my hand.
putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.
only, you've never done a hard day's work.
welcome, my lords...
...to lsengard!
you young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...
...and now we find you feasting and...and smoking!
we are sitting on a field of victory...
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
the salted pork is particularly good.
salted pork?
Hobbits. - We're under orders from Treebeard...
...who's taken over management of lsengard.
young Master Gandalf.
I'm glad you've come.
wood and water, stock and stone I can master.
but there is a wizard to manage here...
... Iocked in his tower.
show yourself.
be careful.
even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.
well, let's just have his head and be done with it.
no.
we need him alive.
we need him to talk.
you have fought many wars and slain many men, Théoden King...
...and made peace afterwards.
can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?
can we not have peace, you and I?
we shall have peace.
we shall have peace...
...when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...
...and the children that lie dead there!
we shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg are avenged!
when you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows...
...we shall have peace.
gibbets and crows?
Dotard!
what do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?
let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.
or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dūr itself...
...along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
your treachery has already cost many lives.
thousands more are now at risk.
but you could save them, Saruman.
you were deep in the enemy's counsel.
so you have come here for information.
I have some for you.
something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.
something that you have failed to see.
but the Great Eye has seen it.
even now he presses his advantage.
his attack will come soon.
you're all going to die.
but you know this, don't you, Gandalf?
you cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.
this exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king.
Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him...
...those he professes to love.
tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom?
the path that you have set him on can only lead to death.
I've heard enough!
shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.
no.
come down, Saruman...
...and your life will be spared. - Save your pity and your mercy.
I have no use for it!
Saruman...
...your staff is broken.
Grima, you need not follow him.
you were not always as you are now.
you were once a Man of Rohan.
come down.
a Man of Rohan?
what is the house of Rohan...
... but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...
...and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?
the victory at Helm's Deep does not belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.
you are a lesser son of greater sires.
Grima...
...come down.
be free of him.
free? He will never be free. - No.
get down, cur!
Saruman!
you were deep in the enemy's counsel.
tell us what you know!
you withdraw your guard, and I will tell you where your doom will be decided.
I will not be held prisoner here.
send word to all our allies...
...and to every corner of Middle-earth that still stands free.
the enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike.
the filth of Saruman...
... is washing away.
trees will come back to live here.
young trees.
wild trees. - Pippin!
bless my bark!
Peregrin Took!
I'll take that, my lad.
quickly, now.
tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
hail the victorious dead.
Hail!
no pauses.
no spills. - And no regurgitation.
so it's a drinking game?
last one standing wins.
what'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!
to victory!
I am happy for you.
he is an honourable man.
you are both honourable men.
it was not Théoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
don't listen to me.
you are young.
and tonight is for you.
here, here.
it's the Dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women.
I feel something.
a slight tingle in my fingers.
I think it's affecting me.
what did I say?
he can't hold his liquor.
game over.
Oh. you can search far and wide You can drink the whole town dry
but you"ll never find a beer so brown But you"ll never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our hometown As the one we drink in our hometown
you can drink your fancy ales You can drink "em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true
Pippin!
but the only brew for the brave and true
comes from The Green Dragon
thank you! I win!
no news of Frodo?
no word. Nothing.
we have time.
every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
do we know that?
what does your heart tell you?
that Frodo is alive.
Yes.
Yes, he's alive.
too risky. Too risky.
thieves.
they stole it from us.
kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.
quiet! Mustn't wake them.
mustn't ruin it now.
but they knows.
they knows.
they suspects us.
what's it saying, my precious, my love?
is Sméagol losing his nerve?
no. Not.
never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.
Sméagol wants to see them dead.
and we will.
Sméagol did it once. He can do it again.
it's ours!
ours!
we must get the precious. We must get it back.
patience! Patience, my love.
first we must lead them to her.
we lead them to the Wiinding Stair.
Yes, the stairs. And then?
up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...
...until we come to the tunnel.
and when they go in...
...there's no coming out.
she's always hungry.
she always needs to feed.
she must eat.
all she gets is filthy Orcses.
and they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
no.
not very nice at all, my love.
she hungers for sweeter meats.
Hobbit meat.
and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes...
...then we will find it.
and take it for me!
for us.
Yes. We meant "for us.
Gollum. Gollum.
the precious will be ours...
...once the Hobbitses are dead!
you treacherous little toad!
No! No! Master!
no, Sam! Leave him alone!
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.
he's a horrid, fat Hobbit...
...who hates Sméagol...
...and who makes up nasty lies.
you miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
Sam!
call me a liar? You're a liar!
you scare him off, we're lost! - I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
I won't wait around for him to kill us! -I'm not sending him away.
you don't see it, do you?
he's a villain.
we can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide.
I need you on my side.
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
I know, Sam. I know.
trust me.
come, Sméagol.
what time is it?
not yet dawn.
I dreamed I saw a great wave...
...climbing over green lands and above the hills.
I stood upon the brink.
it was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.
a light shone behind me...
...but I could not turn.
I could only stand there, waiting.
night changes many thoughts.
sleep, Ёowyn.
sleep...
...while you can.
the stars are veiled.
something stirs in the east.
a sleepless malice.
the Eye of the enemy is moving.
what are you doing?
Pippin!
Pippin?
Pippin.
what, are you mad? - I just want to look at it.
just one more time.
put it back.
Pippin.
No!
Pippin.
he is here.
I see you.
Pippin!
help! Gandalf, help!
someone help him!
Pippin!
fool of a Took!
look at me.
Gandalf, forgive me.
look at me.
what did you see?
a tree.
there was a white tree...
...in a courtyard of stone.
it was dead.
the city was burning.
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
I saw...
I saw him.
I could hear his voice in my head.
and what did you tell him?
speak!
he asked me my name. I didn't answer.
he hurt me.
what did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
there was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
a fool...
...but an honest fool he remains.
he told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
we've been strangely fortunate.
Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
his defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.
he knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
men are not as weak as he supposed.
there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him.
Sauron fears this.
he will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
he will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...
...before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.
if the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
tell me...
...why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
what do we owe Gondor?
I will go. -No!
they must be warned. -They will be.
you must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
follow the river. Look to the black ships.
understand this:
things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
I ride for Minas Tirith...
...and I won't be going alone.
of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
Hurry! Hurry!
where are we going?
why did you look?
why do you always have to look?
I don't know. I can't help it. -You never can.
I'm sorry, all right?
I won't do it again. - Don't you understand?
the enemy thinks you have the Ring.
he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
and you--? You're coming with me?
merry?
come on.
how far is Minas Tirith?
three days' ride, as the Nazgūl flies.
and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
here.
something for the road.
the last of the Longbottom Leaf.
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.
but-- But we'll see each other soon.
won't we? -I don't know.
I don't know what's going to happen.
merry. - Run, Shadowfax.
show us the meaning of haste.
merry!
merry!
he's always followed me...
...everywhere I went...
...since before we were twins.
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...
...but I was always there to get him out.
now he's gone.
just like Frodo and Sam.
one thing I have learned about Hobbits:
they're a most hardy folk.
foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.
take her by the safest road.
a ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
it waits to carry her across the sea.
the last journey of Arwen Undómiel.
there is nothing for you here...
...only death.
lady Arwen...
...we cannot delay.
my lady!
tell me what you have seen. -Arwen.
you have the gift of foresight.
what did you see?
I looked into your future, and I saw death.
but there is also life.
you saw there was a child. You saw my son.
that future is almost gone.
but it is not lost.
nothing is certain.
some things are certain.
if I leave him now...
... I will regret it forever.
it is time.
from the ashes a fire shall be woken
a light from the shadow shall spring
renewed shall be blade that was broken
the crownless again shall be king
re-forge the sword.
your hands are cold.
the life of the Eldar is leaving you.
this was my choice.
whether by your will or not...
...there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
we've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
Minas Tirith.
city of kings.
make way!
it's the tree.
Gandalf. Gandalf.
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
the Tree of the King.
lord Denethor, however, is not king.
he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.
and do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
and say nothing of Aragorn either.
in fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.
perhaps you come to explain this.
perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
Boromir died to save us...
...my kinsman and me.
he fell defending us from many foes. - Pippin.
I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt.
this is my first command to you.
how did you escape and my son did not...
...so mighty a man as he was?
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...
...and Boromir was pierced by many.
get up.
my lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...
...but it is not now.
war is coming.
the enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged...
...with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
you still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.
send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
you think you are wise, Mithrandir.
yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
I have seen more than you know.
with your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
and with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North...
... Iast of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.
the rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
come.
all has turned to vain ambition.
he would even use his grief as a cloak.
a thousand years this city has stood.
now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.
and the White Tree, the Tree of the King...
...will never bloom again.
why are they still guarding it? -They guard it because they have hope.
a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.
that a king will come and this city will be as it once was...
... before it fell into decay.
the old wisdom born out of the West was forsaken.
kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living...
...and counted the old names of their descent...
...dearer than the names of their sons.
childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry...
...or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.
and so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
the line of kings failed.
the White Tree withered.
the rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
Mordor.
Yes, there it lies.
this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
a storm is coming.
this is not the weather of the world.
this is a device of Sauron's making.
a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.
the Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...
...so he covers the face of the sun...
...to ease their passage along the road to war.
when the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...
...it will begin.
well...
... Minas Tirith...
...very impressive.
so where are we off to next? -Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
there's no leaving this city.
help must come to us.
it must be getting near teatime.
Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
we're not in decent places.
Mr. Frodo?
what is it?
it's just a feeling.
I don't think I'll be coming back.
Yes, you will. Of course you will.
that's just morbid thinking.
we're going there and back again...
...just like Mr. Bilbo.
you'll see.
I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.
long ago, when there was a king.
Mr. Frodo, look.
the king has got a crown again.
come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.
so I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.
do they? -You're in the service of the steward now.
you'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
ridiculous Hobbit.
guard of the Citadel.
thank you.
there's no more stars.
is it time?
Yes.
it's so quiet.
it's the deep breath before the plunge.
I don't want to be in a battle...
... but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
there never was much hope.
just a fool's hope.
our enemy is ready.
his full strength's gathered.
not only Orcs, but Men as well.
legions of Haradrim from the south...
...mercenaries from the coast.
all will answer Mordor"s call.
come on.
this will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
if the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...
...the last defense of this city will be gone.
but we have the White Wiizard. That's got to count for something.
Gandalf?
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...
...the one who will lead Mordor"s armies in war.
the one they say no living man can kill.
the Witch King of Angmar.
you've met him before.
he stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
he is the lord of the Nazgūl...
...the greatest of the Nine.
Minas Morgul is his lair.
the Dead City.
very nasty place. Full of enemies.
quick. Quick.
they will see. They will see.
come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.
the way into Mordor.
the secret stair.
climb.
no, Mr. Frodo! - Not that way!
what's it doing? - No.
they're calling me. - No.
hide! Hide!
I can feel his blade.
we come to it at last.
the great battle of our time.
come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
the board is set.
the pieces are moving.
up, up, up the stairs we go.
and then it's into the tunnel.
Hey, what's in this tunnel?
you listen to me, and you listen good and proper.
anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.
one sniff something's not right...
...one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.
no more slinker. No more stinker.
you're gone. Got it?
I'm watching you.
what was that about?
nothing. Just clearing something up.
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.
another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
you must not fail me.
it's been very quiet across the river.
the Orcs are lying low.
the garrison may have moved out.
we've sent scouts to Cair Andros.
if the Orcs attack from the north, we'll have some warning.
quiet.
we need 10 more.
kill him!
they're not coming from the north.
to the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.
faster.
draw swords.
hold! Hold them!
what?
amon Din.
the beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.
hope is kindled.
the beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
Gondor calls for aid.
and Rohan will answer.
muster the Rohirrim.
assemble the army at Dunharrow.
as many men as can be found. You have two days.
on the third, we ride for Gondor and war.
forward. -Very good, sir.
Gamling. -My lord.
make haste across the Riddermark.
summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
I will.
will you ride with us? -Just to the encampment.
it's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.
the men have found their captain.
they will follow you into battle, even to death.
you have given us hope.
excuse me.
I have a sword.
please accept it.
I offer you my service, Théoden King.
and gladly I accept it.
you shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
Horse-Men.
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.
I fear war already marches on their own lands.
so it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...
...the doom of our time will be decided.
now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!
Faramir!
we can't hold them. The city is lost.
tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.
Nazgūl.
take cover!
Nazgūl!
fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!
fall back!
retreat! Retreat! -Run for your lives!
the age of Men is over.
the time of the Orc has come.
keep going. -It's the Nazgūl.
take cover, my lord!
it's coming!
it's Mithrandir. -The White Rider!
pull!
Mithrandir.
they broke through our defenses.
they've taken the bridge and the west bank.
battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. -lt is as the Lord Denethor predicted.
long has he foreseen this doom. -Foreseen and done nothing.
Faramir?
this is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
no.
you've seen Frodo and Sam?
where? When? - ln lthilien.
not two days ago.
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
and then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
what does that mean?
what's wrong? - Faramir, tell me everything.
tell me all you know.
this is how you would serve your city?
you would risk its utter ruin?
I did what I judged to be right.
what you judged to be right.
you sent the Ring of Power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling.
it should have been brought back to the Citadel to be kept safe.
hidden.
dark and deep in the vaults...
... not to be used.
unless at the uttermost end of need.
I would not use the Ring.
not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her.
ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a king of old
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.
he would have brought me a kingly gift.
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.
he would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.
you know nothing of this matter! -He would have kept it for his own.
and when he returned...
...you would not have known your son.
Boromir was loyal to me!
not some wizard's pupil!
father?
my son.
leave me.
careful, master. Careful.
very far to fall.
very dangerous are the stairs.
come, master.
come to Sméagol.
Mr. Frodo.
get back, you!
don't touch him!
why does he hates poor Sméagol?
what has Sméagol ever done to him?
master?
master carries heavy burden.
Sméagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.
fat one cannot know.
Sméagol look after master.
he wants it.
he needs it. Sméagol sees it in his eye.
very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.
the fat one will take it from you.
send forth all legions.
do not stop the attack until the city is taken.
slay them all.
what of the wizard? -I will break him.
where are Théoden's riders?
will Rohan's army come?
Mithrandir.
courage is the best defense that you have now.
what were you thinking, Peregrin Took?
what service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of Men?
it was well-done.
a generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.
you are to join the tower guard.
I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.
once belonged to a young boy of the city.
a very foolish one...
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.
this was yours? -Yes, it was mine.
my father had it made for me.
well...
... I'm taller than you were then.
though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.
never fitted me either.
Boromir was always the soldier.
they were so alike, he and my father.
proud.
stubborn even.
but strong.
I think you have strength of a different kind.
and one day your father will see it.
here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...
... in peace or war...
...in living or dying...
...from...
from this hour henceforth...
... until my lord release me...
...or death take me.
and I shall not forget it...
...nor fail to reward that which is given.
fealty with love.
valour with honour.
disloyalty with vengeance.
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses...
...defenses that your brother long held intact.
what would you have me do? -I will not yield...
...the river in Pelennor unfought.
Osgiliath must be retaken.
my lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
much must be risked in war.
is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?
you wish now that our places had been exchanged...
...that I had died and Boromir had lived.
Yes.
I wish that.
since you were robbed of Boromir...
... I will do what I can in his stead.
if I should return, think better of me, Father.
that will depend on the manner of your return.
what are you up to?
sneaking off, are we?
sneaking?
sneaking?
fat Hobbit is always so polite.
Sméagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find...
...and they say "sneak.
sneak?
very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.
very nice, very nice. -All right. All right!
you just startled me is all.
what were you doing?
sneaking.
fine. Have it your own way.
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.
we have to be moving on.
it's dark still.
it's always dark here.
it's gone!
the Elven bread. -What?
that's all we have left.
he took it. He must have!
Sméagol? No, no, not poor Sméagol.
Sméagol hates nasty Eleven bread.
you're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!
he doesn't eat it.
he can't have taken it. -Look.
what's this?
crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!
he took it.
I seen him. He's always stuffing his face when master's not looking.
that's a filthy lie!
you stinking, two-faced sneak!
Sam! -Call me
stop it!
Sam!
I'll kill him! -Sam! No!
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.
here, just-- Let's just rest a bit.
I'm all right. -No.
no, you're not all right. You're exhausted.
it's that Gollum.
it's this place.
it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit.
I could carry it for a while.
carry it for a while.
I could carry it... I could carry it.
share the load...Share the load... the load...the load.
get away!
I don't want to keep it.
I just want to help.
see? See?
he wants it for himself.
shut up, you!
go away! Get out of here!
no, Sam.
it's you.
I'm sorry, Sam.
but he's a liar.
he's poisoned you against me.
you can't help me anymore.
you don't mean that.
go home.
Faramir!
Faramir!
your father's will has turned to madness.
do not throw away your life so rashly.
where does my allegiance lie if not here?
this is the city of the Men of Númenor.
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...
... her memory, her wisdom.
your father loves you, Faramir.
he will remember it before the end.
well...
...yes.
at least, well enough for my own people.
but we have no songs for great halls and evil times.
and why should your songs be unfit for my halls?
come, sing me a song.
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
March! March!
March! March! March!
make way for the king.
make way.
the king is here.
my lord.
hail to you, sire.
Grimbold, how many?
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.
we have 300 more from Fenmarch, Théoden King.
where are the riders from Snowbourn? - None have come, my lord.
six thousand spears.
less than half of what I'd hoped for.
six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
more will come.
every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.
we have till dawn, then we must ride.
the horses are restless...
...and the men are quiet.
they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
that road there...
...where does that lead?
it is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.
none who venture there ever return.
that mountain is evil.
Aragorn.
let's find some food.
there.
a true esquire of Rohan.
I'm ready.
sorry.
it isn't all that dangerous.
it's not even sharp.
well, that's no good. You won't kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.
come on.
to the smithy. Go!
you should not encourage him.
you should not doubt him.
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.
why should Merry be left behind?
he has as much cause to go to war as you.
why can he not fight for those he loves?
you know as little of war as that Hobbit.
when the fear takes him...
...and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold...
...do you think he would stand and fight?
he would flee.
and he would be right to do so.
war is the province of Men, Ёowyn.
I choose a mortal life.
I wish I could've seen him...
...one last time.
sir?
king Théoden awaits you, my lord.
I take my leave.
my lord Elrond.
I come on behalf of one whom I love.
Arwen is dying.
she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
the light of the Evenstar is failing.
as Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.
the Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.
the end has come.
it will not be our end, but his.
you ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.
but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river.
a fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.
they'll be in the city in two days.
you're outnumbered, Aragorn.
you need more men.
there are none.
there are those who dwell in the mountain.
murderers...
...traitors.
you would call upon them to fight?
they believe in nothing.
they answer to no one.
they will answer to the king of Gondor.
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.
the blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
the man who can wield the power of this sword...
...can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
put aside the Ranger.
become who you were born to be.
take the Dimholt road.
I give hope to Men.
I keep none for myself.
why are you doing this?
the war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle.
you cannot abandon the men.
Ёowyn...
we need you here.
why have you come?
do you not know?
it is but a shadow and a thought that you love.
I cannot give you what you seek.
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
just where do you think you're off to?
not this time.
this time you must stay, Gimli.
have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
you might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.
what's happening? - Where is he going?
Where's he going?
I don't understand.
lord Aragorn!
why does he leave on the eve of battle?
he leaves because there is no hope.
he leaves because he must.
too few have come.
we cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
no...
...we cannot.
but we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
I have left instruction.
the people are to follow your rule in my stead.
take up my seat in the Golden Hall.
long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
what other duty would you have me do, my lord?
duty?
no.
I would have you smile again...
...not grieve for those whose time has come.
you shall live to see these days renewed...
...and no more despair.
what kind of army would linger in such a place?
one that is cursed.
long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath to the last king of Gondor to come to his aid to fight
but when the time came...
...when Gondor's need was dire...
...they fled...
...vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.
and so Isildur cursed them...
...never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
who shall call them from the grey twilight?
the forgotten people.
the heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
from the north shall he come.
need shall drive him.
he shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
the way is shut.
it was made by those who are dead.
and the Dead keep it.
the way is shut.
Brego!
I do not fear death.
well, this is a thing unheard-of.
an Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?
Oh.
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.
we must ride light and swift.
it is a long road ahead.
and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
all my friends have gone to battle.
I would be ashamed to be left behind.
it is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.
and none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
I want to fight.
I will say no more.
ride with me.
my lady.
form up! Move out!
form up! Move out!
ride!
ride now to Gondor!
what is it?
what do you see?
I see shapes of men.
and of horses.
where?
pale banners like shreds of cloud.
spears rise...
... Iike winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.
the Dead are following.
they have been summoned.
the Dead?
summoned?
I knew that.
very good.
very good! Legolas!
do not look down.
who enters my domain?
one who will have your allegiance.
the Dead do not suffer the living to pass.
you will suffer me.
the way is shut.
it was made by those who are dead.
and the Dead keep it.
the way is shut.
now you must die.
I summon you to fulfill your oath.
none but the king of Gondor may command me.
that line was broken.
it has been remade.
fight for us...
...and regain your honour.
what say you?
what say you?
you waste your time, Aragorn.
they had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
I am lsildur's heir.
fight for me...
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.
what say you?
you have my word!
fight, and I will release you from this living death!
what say you?!
stand, you traitors!
out!
Legolas!
run!
we fight.
open the gate! Quick!
quick! Hurry!
Faramir!
say not that he has fallen.
they were outnumbered.
none survived.
fear.
the city is rank with it.
let us ease their pain.
release the prisoners.
catapults!
my sons are spent.
my line has ended.
he's alive!
the House of Stewards has failed.
he needs medicine, my lord.
my line has ended!
my lord!
Rohan has deserted us.
Théoden's betrayed me.
abandon your posts!
flee! Flee for your lives!
prepare for battle!
hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!
over here!
return to your posts!
send these foul beasts into the abyss.
stay where you are.
we need more rubble!
watch out!
down to the lower levels. Quick!
double up, men!
hold them back! Do not give in to fear.
stand to your posts! Fight!
not at the towers!
aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!
bring them down!
fight them back!
Peregrin Took!
go back to the Citadel! - They'd called us out to fight.
this is no place for a Hobbit.
guard of the Citadel, indeed.
now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!
what are you doing, you useless scum?!
the door won't give. It's too strong.
get back there and smash it down.
but nothing can breach it.
grond will breach it.
bring up the wolf's head.
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
you may go no further.
you will not enter Gondor.
who are you to deny us passage?
legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.
mind your aim.
that's it. Right. We warned you.
prepare to be boarded.
Boarded?
by you and whose army?
this army.
in there.
what is this place?
master must go inside the tunnel.
now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.
it's the only way.
go in...
...or go back.
I can't go back.
what's that smell? -Orcses' filth.
Orcses come in here sometimes.
hurry.
this way.
Sméagol?
over here.
it's sticky. What is it?
you'll see.
Oh, yes.
you will see.
Sméagol?
Sméagol!
Sméagol!
Sam.
and you. Frodo Baggins...
...I give you the light of Eārendil. our most beloved star.
may it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out.
naughty little fly
why does he cry?
caught in a web
soon you"ll be...
eaten.
got away, did it, precious?
not this time.
not this time! -No!
it wasn't us. It wasn't us!
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.
we promised.
you must believe us.
it was the precious.
the precious made us do it.
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.
No!
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I'm so sorry.
this task was appointed to you. Frodo of the Shire.
if you do not find a way...
...no one will.
the scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.
the lower level's in flames.
everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.
time is against us.
make ready!
take heart, Merry.
it will soon be over.
my lady...
...you are fair and brave...
...and have much to live for...
...and many who love you.
I know it is too late to turn aside.
I know there is not much point now in hoping.
if I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...
but I'm not.
I'm a Hobbit.
and I know I can't save Middle-earth.
I just want to help my friends.
Frodo.
Sam.
Pippin.
more than anything, I wish I could see them again.
prepare to move out!
make haste. We ride through the night.
to battle.
to battle.
back to the gate!
Hurry!
I am steward of the House of Anárion.
thus have I walked.
and thus now will I sleep.
Gondor is lost.
there is no hope for Men.
why do the fools fly?
better to die sooner than late.
for die we must.
no tomb for Denethor and Faramir.
no long, slow sleep of death embalmed.
we shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.
bring wood and oil.
steady.
steady.
you are soldiers of Gondor.
no matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground.
run!
volley!
fire!
let him go, you filth.
let him go!
you will not touch him again.
come on and finish it.
back!
Mr. Frodo.
Oh, no.
Frodo.
Mr. Frodo.
wake up.
don't leave me here alone.
don't go where I can't follow.
wake up.
not asleep.
dead.
you get back, you scum!
what's this?
looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.
killed another one, has she?
no.
this fellow ain't dead.
not dead?
she jabs him with her stinger, and he goes as limp as a boned fish.
then she has her way with them.
that's how she likes to feed.
fresh blood.
get him to the tower!
Samwise, you fool.
this scum will be awake in a couple of hours.
then he'll wish he'd never been born.
the house of his spirit crumbles.
he is burning.
already burning.
he's not dead.
he's not dead!
No! No!
No! No!
he's not dead!
farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin. - No! No! No!
I release you from my service.
go now and die in what way seems best to you.
pour oil on the wood!
come on, soldier! Move it!
hurry along there! Hurry along! - Gandalf!
where is Gandalf?
Gandalf!
retreat!
the city is breached!
fall back to the second level!
get the women and children out!
get them out!
retreat!
come on. Come on.
move into the city. Kill all in your path.
take them down!
fight. Fight to the last man!
fight for your lives!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Denethor has lost his mind!
he's burning Faramir alive!
up! Quickly!
go back to the abyss.
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master.
do you not know death when you see it, old man?
this is my hour.
Gandalf!
you have failed.
the world of Men will fall.
courage, Merry.
courage for our friends.
form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!
pikes in front. Archers behind.
Ёomer, take your éored down the left flank.
flank ready.
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.
Grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall.
forth, and fear no darkness!
arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered...
...a sword-day, a red day...
...ere the sun rises!
whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.
ride now!
ride now!
ride! Ride for ruin...
...and the world's ending!
death!
death!
death! -Death!
death! -Death!
death! -Death!
forth Eorlingas!
fire!
death!
charge!
fire at will!
set a fire in our flesh.
stay this madness!
you may triumph in the field of battle for a day...
...but against the power that has risen in the east...
...there is no victory.
No!
you will not take my son from me!
No! No!
Faramir.
so passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
drive them to the river!
make safe the city!
re-form the line!
re-form the line!
sound the charge! Take them head-on!
charge!
cut him down!
take the reins. Pull him left!
left!
aim for their heads!
bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!
merry!
I didn't think it would end this way.
end?
no, the journey doesn't end here.
death is just another path...
...one that we all must take.
the grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...
...and all turns to silver glass.
and then you see it.
what, Gandalf?
see what?
white shores...
...and beyond.
a far green country under a swift sunrise
well...
...that isn't so bad.
no.
no, it isn't.
rally to me! To me!
feast on his flesh.
I will kill you if you touch him.
do not come between the Nazgūl and his prey.
well...
...yes.
at least, well enough for my own people.
but we have no songs for great halls and evil times.
and why should your songs be unfit for my halls?
come, sing me a song.
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
March! March!
March! March! March!
make way for the king.
make way.
the king is here.
my lord.
hail to you, sire.
Grimbold, how many?
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.
we have 300 more from Fenmarch, Théoden King.
where are the riders from Snowbourn? -None have come, my lord.
six thousand spears.
less than half of what I'd hoped for.
six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
more will come.
every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.
we have till dawn, then we must ride.
the horses are restless...
...and the men are quiet.
they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
that road there...
...where does that lead?
it is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.
none who venture there ever return.
that mountain is evil.
Aragorn.

a true esquire of Rohan.
I'm ready.
sorry.
it isn't all that dangerous.
it's not even sharp.
well, that's no good. You won't kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.
come on.
to the smithy. Go!
you should not encourage him.

I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.
why should Merry be left behind?
he has as much cause to go to war as you.
why can he not fight for those he loves?
you know as little of war as that Hobbit.
when the fear takes him...
...and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold...
...do you think he would stand and fight?
he would flee.
and he would be right to do so.
war is the province of Men, Ёowyn.
I choose a mortal life.
I wish I could've seen him...
...one last time.
sir?
king Théoden awaits you, my lord.
I take my leave.
my lord Elrond.
I come on behalf of one whom I love.
Arwen is dying.
she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
the light of the Evenstar is failing.
as Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.
the Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.
the end has come.
it will not be our end, but his.
you ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.
but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river.
a fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.
they'll be in the city in two days.
you're outnumbered, Aragorn.
you need more men.
there are none.
there are those who dwell in the mountain.
murderers...
...traitors.
you would call upon them to fight?
they believe in nothing.
they answer to no one.
they will answer to the king of Gondor.
Andúril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.
the blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
the man who can wield the power of this sword...
...can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
put aside the Ranger.
become who you were born to be.
take the Dimholt road.
I give hope to Men.
I keep none for myself.
why are you doing this?
the war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle.
you cannot abandon the men.
Ёowyn...
we need you here.
why have you come?
do you not know?
it is but a shadow and a thought that you love.
I cannot give you what you seek.
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
just where do you think you're off to?
not this time.
this time you must stay, Gimli.
have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
you might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.
what's happening? -Where is he going?
Where's he going?
I don't understand.
lord Aragorn!
why does he leave on the eve of battle?
he leaves because there is no hope.
he leaves because he must.
too few have come.
we cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
no...
...we cannot.
but we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
I have left instruction.
the people are to follow your rule in my stead.
take up my seat in the Golden Hall.
long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
what other duty would you have me do, my lord?
duty?
no.
I would have you smile again...
...not grieve for those whose time has come.
you shall live to see these days renewed...
...and no more despair.
what kind of army would linger in such a place?
one that is cursed.
long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath to the last king of Gondor to come to his aid to fight
but when the time came...
...when Gondor's need was dire...
...they fled...
...vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.
and so Isildur cursed them...
...never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
who shall call them from the grey twilight?
the forgotten people.
the heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
from the north shall he come.
need shall drive him.
he shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
the way is shut.
it was made by those who are dead.
and the Dead keep it.
the way is shut.
Brego!
I do not fear death.
well, this is a thing unheard-of.
an Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?
Oh.
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.
we must ride light and swift.
it is a long road ahead.
and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
all my friends have gone to battle.
I would be ashamed to be left behind.
it is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.
and none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
I want to fight.
I will say no more.
ride with me.
my lady.
form up! Move out!
form up! Move out!
ride!
ride now to Gondor!
what is it?
what do you see?
I see shapes of men.
and of horses.
where?
pale banners like shreds of cloud.
spears rise...
... Iike winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.
the Dead are following.
they have been summoned.
the Dead?
summoned?
I knew that.
very good.
very good! Legolas!
do not look down.
who enters my domain?
one who will have your allegiance.
the Dead do not suffer the living to pass.
you will suffer me.
the way is shut.
it was made by those who are dead.
and the Dead keep it.
the way is shut.
now you must die.
I summon you to fulfill your oath.
none but the king of Gondor may command me.
that line was broken.
it has been remade.
fight for us...
...and regain your honour.
what say you?
what say you?
you waste your time, Aragorn.
they had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
I am lsildur's heir.
fight for me...
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.
what say you?
you have my word!
fight, and I will release you from this living death!
what say you?!
stand, you traitors!
out!
Legolas!
run!
we fight.
open the gate! Quick!
quick! Hurry!
Faramir!
say not that he has fallen.
they were outnumbered.
none survived.
fear.
the city is rank with it.
let us ease their pain.
release the prisoners.
catapults!
my sons are spent.
my line has ended.
he's alive!
the House of Stewards has failed.
he needs medicine, my lord.
my line has ended!
my lord!
Rohan has deserted us.
Théoden's betrayed me.
abandon your posts!
flee! Flee for your lives!
prepare for battle!
hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!
over here!
return to your posts!
send these foul beasts into the abyss.
stay where you are.
we need more rubble!
watch out!
down to the lower levels. Quick!
double up, men!
hold them back! Do not give in to fear.
stand to your posts! Fight!
not at the towers!
aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!
bring them down!
fight them back!
Peregrin Took!
go back to the Citadel! -They'd called us out to fight.
this is no place for a Hobbit.
guard of the Citadel, indeed.
now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!
what are you doing, you useless scum?!
the door won't give. It's too strong.
get back there and smash it down.
but nothing can breach it.
grond will breach it.
bring up the wolf's head.
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
Grond! Grond! Grond!
you may go no further.
you will not enter Gondor.
who are you to deny us passage?
legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.
mind your aim.
that's it. Right. We warned you.
prepare to be boarded.
Boarded?
by you and whose army?
this army.
in there.
what is this place?
master must go inside the tunnel.
now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.
it's the only way.
go in...
...or go back.
I can't go back.
what's that smell? -Orcses' filth.
Orcses come in here sometimes.
hurry.
this way.
Sméagol?
over here.
it's sticky. What is it?
you'll see.
Oh, yes.
you will see.
Sméagol?
Sméagol!
Sméagol!
Sam.
and you. Frodo Baggins...
...I give you the light of Eārendil. our most beloved star.
may it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out.
naughty little fly
why does he cry?
caught in a web
soon you"ll be...
eaten.
got away, did it, precious?
not this time.
not this time! -No!
it wasn't us. It wasn't us!
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.
we promised.
you must believe us.
it was the precious.
the precious made us do it.
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.
No!
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I'm so sorry.
this task was appointed to you. Frodo of the Shire.
ifyou do not find a way...
...no one will.
the scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.
the lower level's in flames.
everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.
time is against us.
make ready!
take heart, Merry.
it will soon be over.
my lady...
...you are fair and brave...
...and have much to live for...
...and many who love you.
I know it is too late to turn aside.
I know there is not much point now in hoping.
if I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...
but I'm not.
I'm a Hobbit.
and I know I can't save Middle-earth.
I just want to help my friends.
Frodo.
Sam.
Pippin.
more than anything, I wish I could see them again.
prepare to move out!
make haste. We ride through the night.
to battle.
to battle.
back to the gate!
Hurry!
I am steward of the House of Anárion.
thus have I walked.
and thus now will I sleep.
Gondor is lost.
there is no hope for Men.
why do the fools fly?
better to die sooner than late.
for die we must.
no tomb for Denethor and Faramir.
no long, slow sleep of death embalmed.
we shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.
bring wood and oil.
steady.
steady.
you are soldiers of Gondor.
no matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground.
run!
volley!
fire!
let him go, you filth.
let him go!
you will not touch him again.
come on and finish it.
back!
Mr. Frodo.
Oh, no.
Frodo.
Mr. Frodo.
wake up.
don't leave me here alone.
don't go where I can't follow.
wake up.
not asleep.
dead.
you get back, you scum!
what's this?
looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.
killed another one, has she?
no.
this fellow ain't dead.
not dead?
she jabs him with her stinger, and he goes as limp as a boned fish.
then she has her way with them.
that's how she likes to feed.
fresh blood.
get him to the tower!
Samwise, you fool.
this scum will be awake in a couple of hours.
then he'll wish he'd never been born.
the house of his spirit crumbles.
he is burning.
already burning.
he's not dead.
he's not dead!
No! No!
No! No!
he's not dead!
farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin. -No! No! No!
I release you from my service.
go now and die in what way seems best to you.
pour oil on the wood!
come on, soldier! Move it!
hurry along there! Hurry along! -Gandalf!
where is Gandalf?
Gandalf!
retreat!
the city is breached!
fall back to the second level!
get the women and children out!
get them out!
retreat!
come on. Come on.
move into the city. Kill all in your path.
take them down!
fight. Fight to the last man!
fight for your lives!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Denethor has lost his mind!
he's burning Faramir alive!
up! Quickly!
go back to the abyss.
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master.
do you not know death when you see it, old man?
this is my hour.
Gandalf!
you have failed.
the world of Men will fall.
courage, Merry.
courage for our friends.
form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!
pikes in front. Archers behind.
Ёomer, take your éored down the left flank.
flank ready.
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.
Grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall.
forth, and fear no darkness!
arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered...
...a sword-day, a red day...
...ere the sun rises!
whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.
ride now!
ride now!
ride! Ride for ruin...
...and the world's ending!
death!
death!
death! -Death!
death! -Death!
death! -Death!
forth Eorlingas!
fire!
death!
charge!
fire at will!
set a fire in our flesh.
stay this madness!
you may triumph in the field of battle for a day...
...but against the power that has risen in the east...
...there is no victory.
No!
you will not take my son from me!
No! No!
Faramir.
so passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
drive them to the river!
make safe the city!
re-form the line!
re-form the line!
sound the charge! Take them head-on!
charge!
cut him down!
take the reins. Pull him left!
left!
aim for their heads!
bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!
merry!
I didn't think it would end this way.
end?
no, the journey doesn't end here.
death is just another path...
...one that we all must take.
the grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...
...and all turns to silver glass.
and then you see it.
what, Gandalf?
see what?
white shores...
...and beyond.
a far green country under a swift sunrise.
well...
...that isn't so bad.
no.
no, it isn't.
rally to me! To me!
feast on his flesh.
I will kill you if you touch him.
do not come between the Nazgūl and his prey.
it's so beautiful out here.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I was born near here, a little further up the lake near Jefferson.
I've been coming here since I was a little boy.
your parents still live around here?
no, no. They're, uh, they're gone.
my grandparents raised me.
and my Pah-Pah, he, uh, spent his life doing the levees around here...
for free, of course.
Mm. He was a slave? - Mm-hmm.
my grandma was always telling me to be good or else the Confederates would rise up out of Marshall Cemetery and get me.
boy.
what?
I've just never seen this side of you before.
what side?
you seem so calm, so peaceful.
it's what the lake does to me.
I'm happy when I'm out here, you know?
it's funny.
part of me wants to just stay out here by the lake, you know?
read books all day and hunt and fish when I get hungry.
and the other part wants to go everywhere, you know, see everything.
I want to go to New Orleans and New York and Chicago and even San Francisco.
I just want to go...walking down the road and...just disappear.
well, maybe you could take me with you.
when the Saints Come Marching In.
Lord. - What?
it's the school band, and they're outside.
what? Jesus!
I thought you said nobody ever comes around here.
nobody ever does come here, Samantha.
hold on! Hold on!
Henry, come on!
get dressed.
what's going on?
we're gonna go and get Mr. Tolson and Samantha, head back to the campus, and have a pep rally.
come on, get dressed.
you know what? You go and get Tolson, and I'll meet up with you all later on campus.
come on, Lowe.
you know it's going to be fun.
I guess I'll tell them you're going to join us later?
he's going to join us later.
he just has to clean his house, that's all.
great news. Great news. Great news!
my phone has been ringing off the hook.
university of Michigan wants to debate us.
so does SMU. So does Georgia.
Where's Mr. Lowe?
when do I get to debate?
sooner than you think, James.
sooner than you think.
when?
when you're ready.
I'm ready now.
Mr. Tolson, I do not mind if James...
what's wrong?
maybe I'm tired of this.
of what?
of watching other people debate.
when am I going to get a chance to prove myself?
you're our best researcher, James.
we could not do this without you.
you do plenty without me.
excuse me.
James! - What?
James, you wait!
that was so mean what you said in there.
all right, uh, look,
I don't want to lose your friendship.
how can you lose something that you never had?
you were never my friend?
maybe I don't want to just be your friend.
maybe it hurts me to be your friend.
what's going on? - What's going on?
grab his hands.
Mr. Tolson!
where is he?
calm down, Henry.
have you seen him?
no, they won't let us.
they didn't do nothing to you, did they?
no, we're fine. - Deputy,
I'm Dr. James Farmer of Wiley College.
this is William·Taylor, Mr. Tolson's attorney.
and this is his wife Ruth.
hello.
I'd like to see my client, please.
sheriff Dozier. Dr. James Farmer...
Hello, William. How you doing today?
fine, sir, thank you. And you?
Oh, not too bad, not too bad.
me and William, we go way back.
I knew William when I was a boy.
could I see my client now, Sheriff?
your client?
well, the fact of the business is, William, your client is kind of busy right now.
busy doing what?
sheriff. Sheriff.
we have a situation.
get some of your boys out there.
all right, men.
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go!
they with you?
that's right.
see? This is what happens to a town when you let the unions in.
starts trouble.
people get all riled up about nothing.
sheriff, since it's clear that you have no evidence to arrest Mr. Tolson,
I suggest you let him go.
you suggest it?
who the hell are you?
couple of months ago, there was a raid on Floyd Tillman's barn.
it was a peaceful and lawful gathering of sharecroppers who were brutally attacked by a gang of violent vigilantes.
now, witnesses say that you were there.
if you led that raid, Sheriff, you're the one who broke the law, not Tolson.
are you threatening me, boy?
no, sir.
I wouldn't do that.
but I cannot speak for those people outside.
an unjust law is no law at all.
what does that mean?
a mass slaughter of citizens, both white and colored, by Texas Rangers?
is that really what you want as the Sheriff of this county?
now, if you let Tolson go home,
I believe...
I believe that these folks outside, they'll go home as well.
that pig wasn't worth $25.
what?
you owe my father some money.
have a seat, Mr. Farmer.
Oh, Lord.
um...
smu has cancelled.
university of Georgia sounds like they will follow suit.
Why?
I've been blacklisted.
they're talking about censuring me.
Dean Clay and the board have asked me to stop working with the sharecroppers, or else.
they say that it is not my fight.
so... things are bad.
my academic career's in jeopardy.
my debate team has nowhere to go.
anyone know who Antaeus was?
sure. He was a gigantic wrestler in Greek mythology.
his mother was, uh, Gaea, the goddess of Earth, and, uh, I mean, he was unbeatable because anytime someone threw him down to the earth, it would make him stronger.
that's correct.
it would make him stronger.
defeat would make him stronger.
you are my students. I am your teacher.
I think that's a sacred trust.
so what do I say to you now?
quit because the Dean says so?
because the sheriff says so?
because the Texas Rangers say so?
no.
I am diametrically opposed to that.
my message to you is to never quit.
we are not quitting.
good.
what do you want us to do?
debate Harvard.
Harvard? - Harvard University.
they're the reigning national champions.
if we defeat them, we defeat the best.
Mr. Tolson, sir, with all due respect, um, Harvard ain't going to debate us, not little old Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.
they know who we are, Henry.
I've been writing them letters, sending them articles.
but how do we get a letter back?
by continuing to win.
Dr. Farmer has informed me that Howard University is going to be at Prairie View next week.
we annihilated Fisk.
if we eliminate Howard, we will have beaten the two best Negro colleges in America, and I can guarantee you that I will see to it that Harvard does not ignore that.
all right?
Yeah.
# You guys, scoodle um skoo #
# Oh, baby, let's scoodle um skoo #
# Come on, Mama, and scoodle um skoo #
# Scoodle um scoodle um, and scoodle um skoo #
just look for it on there.
you see it on there?
I've been looking the whole time.
prairie View, Texas. The 127.
you show me where to look because it's not on...
127 near Waxahachie.
it's not there.
it's there. You just can't find it.
I see 2, and I see 7.
right. Now look for a 1 in front of it, and you got it.
after 126... - Okay.
before 128.
I really don't think...
you don't see it.
when did you get this map?
what are you doing?
I'm gonna cut him down.
get back in the car. Shut the door.
nobody move.
just get down.
get down, get down.
get down, too. You get down, too.
there's niggers in that car!
come on, come on!
get out of the car!
get out of that car!
stop that car right now!
all right. Everybody sit tight, and, uh...
I'll get the keys.
how you doing, Miss Becker?
I'm fine. You all right?
Yes, ma'am.
I got your rooms all ready.
thank you.
they ain't going to wake up.
come on.
ha!
see you.
all right. Be good, all right?
Hey, baby. How you doing?
why are you still up? You waiting on me?
what's the matter, baby? Come on!
Hey!
shut up. Let's go.
Hey, preacher boy.
shut up. Let's go.
come on.
where are we going?
back to our room.
got him, Mr. Tolson.
# They come from Shevelstown #
Shh!
# Devil knocked my daddy down #
# Run, nigger, run # - Shh!
# Master's gonna get you #
# Run... # - Shh!
okay. Just sit... sit...
not in that bed, though. Get up.
come here.
give me a hug.
stop!
# Look down yonder, what do I see? #
# Great big nigger hangin' from a tree #
# Run, nigger, run #
you're worthless.
what?
you think you're the only one hurting?
um...
okay, I'm sorry... for everything.
for, uh, for drinkin', yeah,
I apologize.
I'm not talking about me.
you're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
no, no, you won't, Lowe.
she doesn't need to see you like this, okay?
I'm just going to talk to her.
leave me alone.
calm down, boy!
stop! Stop!
I'm not playing with you.
calm... Calm down!
are you crazy?
you're never gonna forget what you saw out there, do you understand?
you're never gonna forget what you saw out there.
hanging's the easiest part of it sometimes.
sometimes they cut the little fingers off, your toes, your nose, your ears.
sometimes they cut your privates off.
sometimes they skin you alive.
you'll never be able to forget.
what do you think he did?
he didn't have to do nothing, James!
he didn't have to do nothing!
in Texas they lynch Negroes!
do you understand?
so it doesn't matter how good we are, does it?
what are you talk... What?
this is all useless.
what are you talking about?
I mean we're just a bunch of Negroes debating each other on subjects we all agree on.
now, James, don't talk like that, all right?
why not? - Because you can't!
not you.
Bye! God bless you!
Where's Samantha?
she's not going with us.
why not?
why do you think?
I took her to the bus station.
she wanted to go back to school.
you wanted your chance.
this is it.
but how can any Negro defend the punishment of prison when he's seen so much oppression in his own life?
Yeah!
how?
because crime itself is a form of oppression, and Negroes fall victim to more violent crime than any other race in America.
for us, prison not only offers protection, but retribution.
Yes, indeed!
and for the criminal, it is a dark gift:
the hardship that introduces a man to himself, that rouses his passion for freedom...
Yes, sir!
...his hope for redemption!...
Oh, yeah!
our next debater from Wiley College,
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.
Mr. Farmer?
mom?
mom!
honey.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh!
Mmm!
so?
we lost.
Oh. I'm sorry.
uh, this came.
Harvard.
wonder what it says.
go on and open it and read it.
looks like somebody opened it already. - Not me.
you didn't open it already?
no.
you are not a good liar.
out loud.
dear Mr. Tolson, "thank you for informing us "about your historic victory over Oklahoma City.
I'm sure you realize our season is nearly over, "but today we received another letter from Wiley College written by Mr. Henry Lowe"?
Mm-hmm.
with an "e"?
he told us from a student's perspective about your..."ahem... "about your undefeated season.
well, we're not undefeated anymore.
don't matter.
we wish to extend an invitation to...
we wish to extend an invitation "to debate Harvard Crimson here in Cambridge.
let us know if this is agreeable to you.
honey...
don't you tell anybody.
no.
no, you don't have to thank me.
I just wanted to show you I could write, too.
that's good. Thank you.
but you could do me a favor.
what's that?
keep Samantha on the team.
why would I do that?
Mr. Tolson, it was a rough night.
Yes, it was, Mr. Lowe, for all of us.
and she walked out on us at the last minute.
no, sir. She did not walk out on us.
she walked out on me.
it's good tea.
resolved: Capitalism is immoral.
we will be arguing the affirmative.
to a bunch of Wall Street bankers.
Mr. Tolson, I owe you and my teammates...
you're late. Come in. Sit down.
Samantha, I am not...Samantha
okay, you got macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, black-eyed peas for good luck, red beans and rice, corn bread, candied yams.
I put some peach cobbler in there, too, and some bread pudding.
I know you don't like bread pudding, but I put it in there anyway.
thank you, Mom.
okay.
good luck, son.
dad?
Yes, Jim.
you give Boston my regards.
you hear?
Yes, sir.
come on! Train's leaving.
coming!
Bye, Mom. - Bye-bye.
I love you.
Bye, sis.
love you!
love you, too.
all aboard leaving for Texarkana, Little Rock, St. Louis, and all points north!
all aboard!
I'm not going with you.
what?
I cannot leave this state.
it's a condition of my bail.
you can't let them stop you.
they're not stopping me.
I just don't want to jeopardize your opportunity.
you can win without me.
this is what you wanted to do all along, isn't it?
he's right.
why didn't you tell us this before?
because I didn't want to hear your arguments.
I knew they'd be too good.
all right, Mr. Lowe, you're in charge.
whatever your instincts tell you, you listen.
Yes, sir.
let's go.
let's go.
what are we supposed to do without you?
win.
Chicago Express, with service to Hartford, New York, and Philadelphia, now boarding, Track 29.
I thought somebody was supposed to meet us.
Wiley College?
Yes. - Yes.
I'm Harland Osbourne.
harvard has put me in charge of you for the time that you'll be here in Boston.
how you doing? I'm Henry Lowe. - Mr. Lowe.
James Farmer, Jr. - Mr. Farmer.
Samantha Booke. - Of course. Miss Booke.
we should be going. My car's out front.
I've got it.
Oh, thank you.
just so you know, you'll be staying on campus in Douglas Hall.
I've got to tell you, this debate is stirring up a lot of excitement.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
it's gonna be broadcast all over America.
can we see where we're going to debate?
of course.
Hello, Harvard!
excuse me.
you supposed to be here?
I guess we'll find out, won't we?
Ah!
well, look.
Mr. Farmer.
$5. 00?
lowe, I got $5. 00.
Yeah, I did, too. It's called per diem.
hoo-hoo!
you want me to hold it for you?
no, not my $5. 00.
I got $5. 00. I got $5. 00.
me, too.
well, mine is crispy.
James, this is high tea, all right?
we nibble. We do not devour.
how do you know?
I don't.
hello. I'm Wilson.
this is for you.
thank you.
I can't accept that, sir.
it would be inappropriate.
it would be inappropriate.
who's it from?
it's from Harvard.
maybe it's more money.
hmm.
we have been informed by Top Debate Gamma that your team delivers canned speeches: arguments written by faculty rather than students.
therefore, we are changing the topic.
you will have the same amount of time to write new arguments as the Harvard team: 48 hours.
coaches help students all the time.
Yes, sir.
both teams will be delivered the same reference books.
Yes, sir.
our new topic: Resolved: Civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice.
Wiley College will be arguing the affirmative.
thank you, sir.
I can't reach Mr. Tolson. Nobody knows where he is.
they're setting us up to lose.
we can't win without him.
you're wrong. We can win without him.
Thoreau?
...less desponding free spirits, is in her prisons...
under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man...
here's your coffee, sir.
thank you, Mr. Wilson.
just Wilson.
thank you, Wilson.
...has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits...
but you have to use the Massacre at Amritsar.
agreed, James, but we'll save it for the rebuttal.
we're going to save the best for last because you have to leave the audience...
I think we should get into Gandhi's concept of Satyagraha.
I don't agree.
I don't think people are gonna understand what...
what... Sadagara?
Satyagraha.
from the Sanskrit.
meaning truth and fairness.
I told you.
it's... It's obvious to me that we should begin the debate with Gandhi.
that's exactly why I won't do it.
why should I do the obvious thing?
because that's what wins debates!
listen to what you're saying. This is Harvard, okay?
the first thing you think when you think civil disobedience is what?
that's why we should use Gandhi!
but Gandhi is a strong point!
I want to win! Do you want to win?
Yes, I want to win, but he's right!
Tolson told me I was in charge!
he didn't put you in charge!
you're "in charge" does not mean...
so I can make decisions.
we're not starting with Gandhi!
Yes, we are!
do you hear yourself? You sound like a kid!
well, you are a kid!
fellas, come on!
I'm an idiot? - Yes!
to hell with you! To hell with you!
to hell with this debate!
to hell with me? To hell with me?
just because I disagree with you?
we're not chasing you!
we are so tired of chasing you!
he's coming back, isn't he?
see if I care!
how you doing, man?
you're beautiful when you're asleep.
Henry, l...
Yeah, I know, I know.
but you can't stop me from looking at you.
can everybody shut up and go to bed?
James, come on, wake up.
no.
come on, James, get up.
what?
what is this?
that's my notes.
what are you giving them to me for?
because you're debating, not me.
what?
it's your turn, James.
you serious?
you're crazy.
at 14, you're just as good as me.
the judges will love you.
no. No. You can't quit.
I'm not quitting, Samantha.
Tolson made me captain, and he said you were ready.
Yeah, but you saw me at Howard.
I was horrible.
that's right. You did terrible, didn't you?
so you should just quit, right?
you should just give up.
no.
who's the judge?
what?
who's the judge?
the judge is God.
and why is he God?
because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent.
and who is your opponent?
he doesn't exist.
why doesn't he exist?
because he is a mere a dissenting voice to the truth that I speak.
that's right.
speak the truth.
direct from Harvard Memorial Hall in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this is WNBC Radio, bringing to you live tonight's history-making debate between little Wiley College from Marshall, Texas, and the Harvard University Debate team, the first time ever a Negro college has faced the national champions.
harvard's Dean of Students is making his way to the podium now.
the crowd, as if on cue, falls silent.
on this historic occasion, we welcome the distinguished team from Wiley College, our illustrious judges, you the audience, and through the wonder of radio, the nation.
harvard University celebrates its 300th anniversary this year, and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt, its fifth President of the United States.
but no university, no matter how grand or august in its history, can afford to live in the past.
so, in the spirit of tomorrow, I introduce to you today: the debaters from Wiley College: Miss Samantha Booke, Mr. James Farmer, Junior.
what?
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.
resolved: Civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice.
but how can disobedience ever be moral?
well, I guess that depends on one's definition of the words.
word.
in 1919, in India, 10, 000 people gathered in Amritsar to protest the tyranny of British rule.
has it started?
Shh! - Your brother's talking.
just sit down.
general Reginald Dyer trapped them in a courtyard and ordered his troops to fire into the crowd for ten minutes.
379 died...men, women, children, shot down in cold blood.
dyer said he had taught them a moral lesson.
gandhi and his followers responded not with violence but with an organized campaign of non-cooperation.
government buildings were occupied.
streets were blocked with people who refused to rise, even when beaten by police.
gandhi was arrested, but the British were soon forced to release him.
he called it a moral victory.
the definition of moral: Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory?
you choose.
from 1914 to 1918, for every single minute the world was at war, four men laid down their lives.
just think of it.
240 brave young men were hurled into eternity every hour of every day, of every night, for four long years.
35, 000 hours.
8, 281, 000 casualties.
240.0
here was a slaughter immeasurably greater than what happened at Amritsar.
can there be anything moral about it?
nothing... except that it stopped Germany from enslaving all of Europe.
civil disobedience isn't moral because it's non-violent.
fighting for your country with violence can be deeply moral, demanding the greatest sacrifice of all: life itself.
non-violence is the mask civil disobedience wears to conceal its true face: anarchy.
gandhi believes one must always act with love and respect for one's opponents, even if they are Harvard debaters.
gandhi also believes that lawbreakers must accept the legal consequences for their actions.
does that sound like anarchy?
civil disobedience is not something for us to fear.
it is, after all, an American concept.
you see, Gandhi draws his inspiration not from a Hindu scripture, but from Henry David Thoreau, who I believe graduated from Harvard and lived by a pond not too far from here.
my opponent is right about one thing.
thoreau was a Harvard grad, and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous.
he once said, "Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one."
thoreau, the idealist, could never know that Adolf Hitler would agree with his words.
the beauty and the burden of democracy is this: No idea prevails without the support of the majority.
the people decide the moral issues of the day, not a majority of one.
majorities do not decide what is right or wrong.
your conscience does.
so why should a citizen surrender his or her conscience to a legislator?
no, we must never, ever kneel down before the tyranny of a majority.
we can't decide which laws to obey and which to ignore.
if we could...
I'd never stop for a red light.
my father is one of those men that stands between us and chaos: a police officer.
I remember the day his partner, his best friend, was gunned down in the line of duty.
most vividly of all, I remember the expression on my dad's face.
nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral, no matter what name we give it.
Bravo!
why doesn't he say something?
Shh!
in Texas...
they lynch Negroes.
my teammates and I saw a man strung up by his neck and set on fire.
we drove through a lynch mob, pressed our faces against the floorboard.
I looked at my teammates.
I saw the fear in their eyes...
and worse...
the shame.
what was this Negro's crime that he should be hung, without trial, in a dark forest filled with fog?
was he a thief?
was he a killer?
or just a Negro?
was he a sharecropper?
a preacher?
were his children waiting up for him?
and who are we to just lie there and do nothing?
no matter what he did, the mob was the criminal.
but the law did nothing, just left us wondering why.
my opponent says nothing that erodes the rule of law can be moral.
but there is no rule of law in the Jim Crow South, not when Negroes are denied housing, turned away from schools, hospitals, and not when we are lynched.
St. Augustine said, "An unjust law is no law at all," which means I have a right, even a duty, to resist with violence or civil disobedience.
you should pray I choose the latter.
Bravo!
in tonight's debate between Harvard University and Wiley College...
and the winner is...
Wiley College.
Yeah!
they're probably at a firehouse somewhere. She'd just drop 'em off with a fireman, you know? - Do not talk about that!
I am sick of you accusing me of not being a good mother!
are they at home? Are they at home? - Seven years I've been a good mother!
a perfect mother? I can't have custody.
just remember when we went out. Just remember how you...
right now. Where is Tim right fucking now?
don't you talk about me being a mother. I hate you!
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you just kiss my left nut?
I told you this was a bad idea. - You know what, Ken?
a bad idea would be to let your client walk outta here today and drag this thing out for another year, wasting more time and wasting more money.
I know it doesn't feel like it, but we're making progress.
Mm-hmm. - We settled the deal with the cars.
those are mine. - I want them.
you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna split 'em right down the middle.
how'd that be, Mr. Kroeger? - It would be no-not good at all!
I earned those miles! - Yeah, you earned them flying to Denver to meet your whore. - Oh, Lord.
well, she's not afraid to express herself sexually - if that's what you mean. - She's a stripper, for God's sake!
she is not! - Her name is Chastity!
she is white trash! Same as you.
hillbilly!
that's it, go comatose for me, baby.
you shut your mouth when you're talkin' to me!
hold it. This is getting confusing.
you didn't always hate each other.
there had to be some nice moments, during the courtship, maybe?
or the wedding? - The wedding had to be fun!
you have your families together. - You have your decorations.
families coming together. That's a nice moment.
What'd you have to eat? - Crab cakes.
are you kidding me? Crab c... how could you not have a good time eating crab cakes? I love 'em. - Crab cakes, I love crab cakes.
they're phenomenal. - And did you have a band?
did you have a band? Good or bad? - Yeah.
it's good no matter what. - That's true. You got them...
there's music in the air! ...playing "Shout" and you hate it.
Yeah. Oh-oh-oh-oh-hey. - A little bit softer now - Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey. - Shout now, jump up and shout now.
it's a good time, do you know what I mean?
Yeah. Rubbin' up against each other, just a couple of kids who like to fuck, trying to make it honest. I get it.
guys, the real enemy here is the institution of marriage.
and have some opportunities for yourself. I'm sure you'd love to be free, maybe go out and meet some Latin guy that can dance, grind up on you, make you feel dangerous but also safe.
and how about you? Don't you want to get inside Chastity without having to wonder if everyone's gonna find out?
God, wouldn't that be sweet? - Wouldn't that be nice?
let's finish this and let's move on.
get out there and get some strange ass.
could you give her a glass of water so she can take that?
Hey, John, that's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
wow, now that you mention it, it is half full.
he can have the miles.
Nah, sweetie, you take the miles.
great. Great! Let's sign the paperwork and we are done!
this is just semantics. If you guys want to throw a couple miles at us, we'll take a couple. The big this is, is that we're all movin' on.
could you two just not talk anymore?
Oh, good, you got it. Is it 100%/% goose down?
Yes. Why do you need this? - Are you sure?
I sleep over at John's house every year for his birthday.
okay, that's not creepy.
I guess it is a little creepy when a young man who happens to be an only child loses both of his parents in a tragic accident one month before his birthday and then has a best friend make a vow that he will never spend his birthday alone again.
maybe that would fall under the category of creepy.
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
that's okay. - No, you're really sweet.
I've got the perfect girl for you.
Janice, I apologize to you if I don't seem real eager to jump into a forced, awkward intimate situation that people like to call dating. I don't like the feeling.
you're sitting there, you're wondering, "Do I have food on my face?
am I eating? Am I talking too much? Are they talking enough? Am I interested?
I'm not really interested. Should I play like I'm interested?
but I'm not that interested, but I think she might be interested.
but do I want to be interested? But now she's not interested.
so now, all of sudden I'm... I'm starting to get interested.
and when am I supposed to kiss her? Do I have to wait for the door?
cause then it's awkward, it's like "Well, good night.
do you do like the ass-out hug? Where you like... you hug each other like this, and the ass sticks out because you're trying not to get too close.
or do you go right in and just kiss 'em on the lips or don't kiss 'em at all?
it's very difficult trying to read the situation and all the while you're just really wondering, "Are we gonna get hopped enough to make some bad decisions?" And perhaps play a little game called "Just the Tip."
just for a second, just to see how it feels, - or "Ouch Ouch, You're on My Hair." - Okay.
okay, can... can you... can you put that so he... he can't see it?
and thank you. Hey, Janice. Great talk.
John?
I gotta see you right away, it's important.
what's going on?
we've got three really big weeks ahead of us.
it's wedding season, kid!
I got us down for 17 of them already.
okay, now, how many of 'em are cash bars?
great question, love where your head's at, and two of 'em actually are.
but... I got us covered.
purple hearts. We won't have to pay for a drink all night.
Oh yeah, perfect.
we are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous ladies that are so aroused by the thought of marriage, that they'll throw their inhibitions to the wind.
and who's gonna be there to catch 'em?
grab that net and catch that beautiful butterfly, pal!
what do you like better? Christmas or wedding season?
Mr. Grey. - Yes, um, the answer would be, um...
wedding season? - Bingo.
I'm gonna go get my suit. Oh, now who are we this time?
Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet a real mensch, Chuck Schwartz.
Oh, stop.
and as we carry on the tradition of thousands of years, we honor the eternal bond that stretches through the ages.
I have known this couple for many years.
Deborah， I've actually known for her entire life.
I was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital, and I was there the day she graduated from medical school.
Josh I have known since his bar mitzvah, which those of you who were there know it was not a very pretty sight.
okay. - He never got the courage to ask her out, until 10 years later. Josh was in the emergency room, and he saw Debra again and he said to himself... - Hi.
"Wait! That's the girl I'm going to marry!"
I now pronounce you man and wife.
mazel tov!
mazel tov, baby! From my family to yours, mazel tov. Beautiful.
hava nagila Hava nagila Hava nagila, ba ba ba!
you sly son of a bitch.
nagila, hava nagila ve'nismecha Hava nagila, hava...
does anyone know what this here is used for?
rolling a fatty. - No, not...
not for... where'd you learn that?
you want to get a whole combination.
you gotta get the frostings in the middle and on the other end.
Ba-ba ba ba - That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it! Come on!
you both look beautiful up there today, particularly Debbie in that white dress. Enjoy it. After tomorrow, I don't think you're gonna be able to get away with wearing a white dress.
here, I'll just pick this off,
I'll go grab another piece. That's it.
Ooh! - Whoa.
in the words of the old country...
L'chaim! - L'chaim!
come here!
I want you to take this note, bring it to that blonde girl.
hurry, 'cause I'm gonna time you. Go!
Hi.
who gave this to you?
you know, I saw you at the wedding.
And? - You were crying.
Oh, shit. You weren't supposed to see that.
now you probably think I'm a big pussy.
no, you were so sweet. Come here.
can I say yes?
sanjay Collins. - Chuck Vindaloo, excited to be here.
shamus O'Toole. - Bobby O'Shea.
and we're gonna get drunk. - Ha-ha!
keep it comin', love, keep it comin', love...
who is that? - Uh, him.
uh, I think that's his kid Leonard. The diabetic.
who is that? - That's Luigi and Gina's son Christopher. You know, the banker.
Oh, that's Mae Lin's adopted son Benny, the veterinarian.
the French Foreign Legion?
Yeah. We lost a lot of good men out there.
wow, really? Mount Everest?
I just don't like to talk about it because we lost so many good men out there.
Oh!
lost so many good men out there.
playing with the Yankees?
Yes, with the Yankees.
l... look, I don't want to talk about it, I'm sorry.
you know how they say we only use 10% of our brains?
Mmm. - I think we only use 10% of our hearts.
I feel so tiny in your arms.
Really? How tall are you?
I'm 6'5," but I feel like I'm four feet.
and some poetry, courtesy of Sarah McLachlan.
you've been so good to me. You know you make me wanna shout. Kick my heels up and shout! Throw my head back and shout!

Oh, no no.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sarah, I feel like I don't even know you.
it's Vivian.
would you say you're completely full of shit or just 50%?
I hope just 50, but who knows?
Ah.
you don't think we're being...
I don't want to say sleazy, 'cause that's not the right word, but a little irresponsible, maybe?
No!
one day, you'll look back on all this and laugh, say we were young and stupid.
Yeah.
a couple of dumb kids running around.
we're not that young.
hell of a season, pal.
hell of a season.
Oh! Baba ganoush.
what do we got?
Christmas come early.
secretary Cleary? - The Secretary of the Treasury.
the guy you loved since business school. Don't thank me.
I don't know. I mean, I thought the season was over.
I was looking forward to kinda taking a break for a little bit.
John, what are you talking about?
it's the Clearys. They're an American institution.
pal, there's gonna be over 200 single women at this wedding.
not to mention, if you look here, they've got three live bands, they got oysters, snacks, phenomenal finger food.
I'm tired, okay? My feet hurt. My voice is hoarse.
Oh, please don't take a turn to negative town.
what are you talking about? Who's getting negative?
well, at the Buckner nuptials you were sitting and sulking in the corner.
I wasn't sulking. I twisted my ankle.
rule #6: Do not sit in the corner and sulk;
it draws attention to you in a negative way.
draw attention to yourself, but on your own terms.
please don't quote the rules to me, I know them.
when Chaz Reinhold passed the sacred rules of wedding crashing onto us 12 years ago, he gave us a legacy.
you make it sound like a cult, okay?
and from everything you've told me about Chaz, he sounds like a kook!
you bite your tongue. Chaz Reinhold is not a kook!
he is a brave and a decent man. He is a pioneer!
he lived with his mother till he was 40! She tried to poison his oatmeal!
Erroneous! Erroneous.
erroneous on both counts!
Oh, Lord. Here we go again. - What you should be worried about is not Chaz Reinhold, who is in the hall of fame.
what you should be worried about is you're getting sloppy.
there is no room for error.
I love your enthusiasm.
if I do this, I don't wanna half-ass it.
I want it well planned.
he's back!
all right, partner. We'll start scheming tonight, okay?
sounds good. - If you need me, I'll be on line six.
okay.
could be fun.
Wow. - Mr. Senator.
congratulations, Kathleen. - Thank you.
bill, congratulations. - Thank you, Senator.
secretary, they just grow up so damn fast.
that's the truth.
okay. Let's do our pregame. - What do you got?
a few articles on Secretary Cleary's economic policies.
there's also a roster of key family members, a glossary, sailing terms.
sailing? - Sailing's like sex to these people.
they love it. - Harvard Kennedy School of Government,
mom's big with charities, blah blah blah.
three daughters, one son. I get it. Good work.
good.
let me see that again, please.
handsome.
okay, what's our back story?
we're brothers from New Hampshire, we're venture capitalists.
I'm sick of that!
let's be from Vermont and let's have an emerging maple syrup conglomerate.
wait, that's stupid. We don't know anything about maple syrup.
I happen to know everything there is to know about maple syrup.
I love maple syrup. I love maple syrup on pancakes.
I love it on pizza. I like to take maple syrup and put a little bit in my hair when I've had a rough week. What do you think holds it up, slick?
I'd like to be pimps from Oakland or cowboys from Arizona, but it's not Halloween! Grow up, Peter Pan! Count Chocula!
look, we been to a million weddings.
and guess what? We've rocked 'em all!
great day.
Hey, hey. Fifth row back with the fancy hat.
I like that.
no, don't waste your time on girls with hats, they tend to be very proper.
yeah?
the proper girl in the hat just eye-fucked the shit outta me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
why don't you say it a little louder? I don't think the priest heard you.
look, John, I'm sorry I'm not sorry, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize. I'm a cocksman.
Tourette's. - Frank Myers.
John Ryan. Say hello to my brother Jeremy.
Hi, how are you? So, um, how do you know the groom?
we are Uncle Ned's kids. - Mm-hmm.
uncle Ned.
is he Liz's brother? - Uncle Ned, the brother of Aunt Liz.
how is everybody?
well, Dad kinda putters around the house.
Hey, Aunt Liz sends her best. She couldn't make it.
uh, yeah, I know. Uh, ah...
she's dead.
from the grave.
she sends her best from the grave.
we've become extremely spiritual - ever since she passed. - I see.
but thank you so much for your kindness, brother.
lord knows we need family now more than ever.
you're welcome. - Thank you.
how many times are you gonna do this shit?
rule #32: You don't commit to a relative unless you're absolutely positive that they have a pulse.
rule #16: Give me an up-to-date family tree.
that was your mistake. You made me look like an idiot.
rule #76: No excuses, play like a champion.
Hello, Red.
dibs. - She's all yours.
I ain't gonna fight you.
I think we've got a crier.
no shot. - $20.
make it 40. - Done.
Oh, are you kidding me?
it's beautiful. It's moving. It's a wedding.
and now for our next reading, I'd like to ask the bride's sister Gloria up to the lectern.
$20, 1 Corinthians.
double or nothing, Colossians 3: 12.
and now a reading from Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians.
love is patient, love is kind.
as you all know, Craig and Christina are quite the sailing enthusiasts.
in that light, they have elected to exchange vows which they themselves have written.
the ring.
I, Craig, take you, Christina, to be my wife, my best friend and my first mate through sickness and health, clear skies and squalls.
I'm sorry, I have a tickle in my throat.
I, Christina, take you, Craig, to be my best friend, and my captain to be your anchor and your sail...
well, this is a first.
...your starboard and your port.
and now I pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the first mate.
told you this would be classy, right?
Yes, you did, class, first class all the way. You were not lying.
class class class.
they've got some kind of seasoning on here.
it must be sprinkled.
okay, go get us seats near, but not too near, the bridal party.
I'm going to go drop this box of fresh Wyoming air.
if you see any crab cakes, get your hands on some cause I love the crab cakes. - Consider it done.
fondue set. - Excuse me?
the present you're holding is a sterling silver fondue set.
John Ryan. - Claire Cleary.
uh, so how do you know that?
well... I'm a psychic.
you're psychic? Really?
Yes.
what's that one? - Knife set. German. Very nice.
hmm. And that?
cotton linens, Egyptian. - Ooh.
what about that? - Oh, I'll go all day. Place settings, candlesticks, crystal stemware which they'll probably never use 'cause it's... crystal stemware.
okay, how about that? - This...
uh... massage oils and a book on tantra from the wacky aunt.
let's check.
who's it from? - Aunt Millie.
Yes! - Well, you... you have a gift.
I know. Unfortunately my powers only apply to useless consumer products.
well, you know, if the police are missing a Belgian waffle maker you could, um, give 'em a hand.
Claire, we need you for pictures. - Oh, okay.
who's your friend? - This is John Ryan.
could I just have one more of the samplers here?
good. - What have we got?
come back with some more stuff.
that's good, though. These bacon-wrapped scallops, phenomenal.
really hit the spot. Unbelievable.
Oh, shit. Isn't that the girl you hooked up with at the Andersons' wedding?
Oh, Jesus, I'm smoked. - No, no, don't panic.
we're gonna do #10 from the playbook. Here she comes.
Shlomo? I thought you were renouncing all your possessions and moving to Nepal.
Shlomo, don't you remember me?
Oh my God, you didn't hear.
I'm so sorry.
shlomo had a scuba diving accident.
Yeah, he came up too fast, and the oxygen deprivation...
poor guy, he doesn't remember anyone, even me, his own brother.
I'm just some nice guy who helps him out.
you poor thing!
he actually can't hear anything either. It's part of the accident.
so you're here for the Clearys' wedding?
Oh, yes, yes, but I-I have to leave.
I-I've got a flight to Madrid, but... - Oh, you have to leave?
Yes. - Oh, okay.
I could hang out for a few minutes.
Oh, actually, that won't be necessary.
shlomo would now like me to take him to the bathroom, and then get him some crab cakes.
so, yeah, no, that's o...
okay, okay! Okay, I'm gonna take you to get crab cakes first, then I'll take you to the bathroom.
you know what? Here is my number.
if there is anything I can do to help...
have a safe flight. Don't worry about us.
we're gonna be fine. We're gonna make it.
doctor.
she looked good. I'm gonna give it a shot.
how are you gonna call her? She thinks you're deaf.
everyone wants to be a part of a miracle.
people helping people. It's powerful stuff.
God, you're a sick man. You also may be a genius.
okay, so what angle you gonna play here?
I'm gonna go with the balloon-animal display for the kids, and then when she comes close to check it out, guess who's a broken man?
it's all deadly. - Yes.
I'll see you in a little.
final touch. There it is.
one happy elephant. All right.
who else wants something?
I want a bicycle.
a bicycle? Well, a bicycle, that would take a lot of balloons and honestly Uncle Jeremy's a little tired right now so why don't we do something like, uh... let's say a giraffe?
I just want a bicycle!
why-why are you yelling at me?
whatever, make me a bicycle, clown!
I'm gonna make you a bicycle.
but I don't want to make you a bicycle.
shut your mouth, funny guy, and make it!
let's see how you do with somebody your own age.
I think I'm up to the challenge.
all right, will you save me a dance for later?
maybe. - Okay.
go on, take it, you hyena.
don't say thank you.
Hi. You're good.
that thing? I'm just warming up. Last week I did a, uh, exact replica of... to scale... of Wrigley Field.
ha! - Honest to God.
I don't have anywhere to put it. - Okay, then I'll take a sportscar.
how about a dance?
that's what I really wanted.
so how long have you and the Secretary been married?
30 years next April.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Yeah, and we were faithful for two of them.
hmm? - Enjoy the party.
Thanks.
secretary Cleary, John Ryan.
Hi, John. - I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your position paper on economic expansion in Micronesia.
you've read my position paper?
I read it while I was sailing my boat to Bermuda.
a sailor?
good man, take a seat. - Oh, thanks.
you didn't happen to catch my speech on the Paraguayan debt and money supply issue, did you?
are you kidding me? I thought it was great.
your argument for the inverse ratio of capitalization to debt was genius.
now, if we can just get Congress not to be so shortsighted.
Yeah. - Why not?
it's just that we lost a lot of really good men out there.
I'm sorry.
Gloria, I think I gotta go get some fresh air.
thank you so much for the dance and it was wonderful to meet you.
I wish I were stronger.
Jeremy!
Jeremy, wait up!
John, you seem like an astute man. - Thank you.
maybe you can help explain something to me.
you see that young man out there on the dock?
sure. - That's my son, Todd.
22 years old, the whole world in front of him, every advantage in life, advantages I never had...
that's not exactly true.
he had the same advantages I had, which is a hell of a lot of advantages.
so here's my question.
what's he got to be so morose about?
maybe he hasn't found something to believe in.
Oh, he says he believes in art, but all I've seen him do is dribbling his own blood on a canvas and smearing it around with a stick!
you know, some people call that art.
it's crap!
well, maybe he's...
maybe he's just trying to find his own way, his own path.
I mean, you cast a pretty big shadow.
Yeah.
well, perhaps...
I should take it easy on him.
perhaps.
death, you are my bitch lover!
Todd, that's good!
tell that mean ocean!
Oh, uh...
it's a start.
so you dove into the icy water?
I mean, why would a man risk his own life for the life of a complete stranger?
do you know what that awareness is, Gloria?
what? - That we're all one.
that separateness is an illusion, and that I'm one with everyone...
with the Prime Minister of England, and my cousin Harry, you and me, the fat kid from "What's Happening!!
the Olsen twins,
Natalie Portman, the guy who wrote Catcher in the Rye,
NAT King Cole,
carrot Top,
jay-z, - Weird Al Yankovic... - Hmm.
Harry Potter, if he existed, the whore on the street corner, your mother...
we're all one. - We are?
that my hands are your hands...
Oh...
and that my cheek...
is really your cheek, and that my lips...
...are my lips.
according to Mr. Schopenhauer, they are.
well, the guy wants to run for President.
Oh, so you're hiding, I see.
he thinks Moby Dick is a venereal disease.
well, that's what I need. Claire...
sorry to interrupt.
um, Christina wants to talk to you. - Fun's over.
Yeah. - Funny.
Franklin! - What a great guy.
you are a big hit at this wedding.
well, everyone's so nice. It's easy.
half of these people are here because of my dad.
they're all just, you know, suckling at the power teat.
no no. Come on, they're here because they want to believe they're in the presence of true love.
that's why people come to weddings, 'cause they wanna believe in true love.
what's true love?
true love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.
well, it's a little cheesy, but... I like it.
uh, I saw it on a bumper sticker.
so, you gonna give a toast? - Yes.
nervous? - Mm... little bit. Um...
what are you gonna say?
would you?
you keep it in your cleavage.
nowhere else to put it.
normally, I'm not very good at these things, but I-I think this one's pretty good.
I never thought my sister would find someone who cared about what other people thought as much as she did...
until I met Craig? - Yes!
that's funny! That's funny because it's true. You know, people like funny.
I know. But the whole funny-because-it's-true bit only works if the truth is a small thing like "Everyone knows Jennifer likes to shop," Ha ha ha.
I think you're better off going with something from the heart, honestly.
I think that people are gonna like this.
I think you're gonna hear crickets.
I thing you're wrong. - Sounds of silence.
Mmm-mm. I'm sticking to it. - Go ahead.
Hey, meet me at the back of the room.
I'll be the guy waiting to say "I told you so."
good luck!
and so, after my ninth stint in rehab, um, Craig... oh, Craig.
Craig was the only one who still believed in me.
been sober now for eight months.
and uh...
I thank God every day, for sending me a friend like Craig.
I love you, man.
I never thought that my sister would find someone who cared about what other people thought as much as she did until I met Craig.
uh...
um... as you all know, my sister and Craig are both lawyers at big law firms in New York.
but that's not the only thing they have in common.
um, they both like the color green like Craig's eyes and money.
um, uh...
you know, someone once told me that true love is the soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.
and I think that that's a very rare thing in this world.
and I think it's something to be valued.
and I'm just really happy that my big sister's found it.
uh, congratulations, Chris.
Ah! That was amazing!
it was really great.
we should probably head back so they're not lookin' for us.
I always knew my first time would be on a beach.
first time?
you were a virgin? - Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Jeremy, we're gonna be so happy together.
I love you.
I'm sorry? - I love you!
you totally saved me. - No.
Yes. - Claire, come on. Come here.
