Yeah. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to give her some tips.
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to give her some tips. So...
Yeah. Well, I'm working on a list

Yeah. Well, a girl like you
Yeah. Well, a toy can't take out three grown men at once.
Yeah. Well, about that, um -
Yeah. Well, according to her notes,
Yeah. Well, after all the cases you presented
Yeah. Well, after all the cases you presented over the years, I'm not surprised.
Yeah. Well, all right merry Christmas, dad. Bye.
Yeah. Well, all right, I'll take that one. What is it?
Yeah. Well, all you gotta do...
Yeah. Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

Yeah. Well, apparently, I want everything.
Yeah. Well, apparently, neither do I.
Yeah. Well, aren't you?
Yeah. Well, as Nietzsche says, "when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze into you."
Yeah. Well, as a friend,
Yeah. Well, as usual, you got it wrong.
Yeah. Well, as you said,
Yeah. Well, at least everything will be perfect tonight.
Yeah. Well, at least it's a game we know how to play.
Yeah. Well, at least it's cold and my new boots leak.
Yeah. Well, at least we only have to put up with them - a couple times a year. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, at, uh, parties, weddings, the occasional bar mitzvah, stuff like that.

Yeah. Well, contrary to popular belief,
Yeah. Well, doctor said best - case scenario.
Yeah. Well, don't forget to vote.
Yeah. Well, don't forget to vote.
Yeah. Well, don't get too excited. There was a catch.
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.
Yeah. Well, either way, I'm out
Yeah. Well, either way, he was pretty blown away.
Yeah. Well, enough people are ridiculous,
Yeah. Well, er, we've been talking,
Yeah. Well, essentially, it was a recording
Yeah. Well, even if a victim compiies, it's still murder.
Yeah. Well, even if a victim complies, it's still murder.
Yeah. Well, except, real talk?
Yeah. Well, financially it makes sense, so...
Yeah. Well, flat screens come and go,
Yeah. Well, for me it was, anyway, but I'm just an impulsive kind of guy.
Yeah. Well, for now,
Yeah. Well, for now, let's worry about step one.
Yeah. Well, found something else, too. Look.
Yeah. Well, frankly, Mr. Gerentex, I don't have much of a problem with you.
Yeah. Well, fuck them.
Yeah. Well, get over it.
Yeah. Well, go figure.
Yeah. Well, good - bye, Georgie porgie. Good - bye?

Yeah. Well, got to go.
Yeah. Well, guess what, pal.
Yeah. Well, guess what?
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?
Yeah. Well, he also has a used tab from his explosives kit.
Yeah. Well, he died with a gun in his hands.
Yeah. Well, he just got that place on the beach, so...
Yeah. Well, he just got that place on the beach.
Yeah. Well, he spoke to me.
Yeah. Well, he thinks our children will be very attractive.
Yeah. Well, he was a real sourpuss of a guy.
Yeah. Well, he would've been, too, if he hadn't been in the bathroom.
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.
Yeah. Well, he's gonna be missed,
Yeah. Well, he's gonna stay with us through Thanksgiving.
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.
Yeah. Well, he's on a C130 halfway across the country by this time.
Yeah. Well, he's only 42 minutes away.
Yeah. Well, he's unlikely to come over if we got bubonic plague.
Yeah. Well, her husband had no trouble moving on.
Yeah. Well, here I go, off into the sunset.
Yeah. Well, here we are again, yeah.
Yeah. Well, here we go.
Yeah. Well, here's the thing. Guys are idiots
Yeah. Well, hey, if there's one guy that can whip new directions
Yeah. Well, his vitals are fading fast,
Yeah. Well, how 'bout for my fertilizer?
Yeah. Well, how close on our ass is the air strike?
Yeah. Well, how close on our ass is the air strike?
Yeah. Well, how do we find it?
Yeah. Well, how much were you two making?
Yeah. Well, ice cream is made from cream...
Yeah. Well, if I'm such a big hero, how come I still got to polish the rig?
Yeah. Well, if he couldn't, I would have.
Yeah. Well, if it was just me, it would be fine.
Yeah. Well, if that's all I can bring, can you at least see how much damage I could do with it?
Yeah. Well, if there's a Russian special forces team on our soil,
Yeah. Well, if they do it, we should do it.
Yeah. Well, if you shut the hell up, now is your big chance.
Yeah. Well, if you shut the hell up, now is your big chance.
Yeah. Well, if you wanna go on,
Yeah. Well, if you wanna go on, just Go around me.
Yeah. Well, if you wanna go on, just Go around me.
Yeah. Well, in a nutshell,
Yeah. Well, in most situations, a contract is not a bad idea.
Yeah. Well, in this case, it was "boy" next door.
Yeah. Well, injuries of that nature,
Yeah. Well, is there anything that I can do to help?
Yeah. Well, it actually sounded more like "pa - Kay,
Yeah. Well, it better work.
Yeah. Well, it didn't, did it?
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean he killed anybody either. Come on.
Yeah. Well, it gets old.
Yeah. Well, it helps when you Haven't used them

Yeah. Well, it is a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Yeah. Well, it isn't how I saw mine.
Yeah. Well, it isn't.
Yeah. Well, it just wasn't that,
Yeah. Well, it makes it really hard to know what to do.
Yeah. Well, it must be standard procedure
Yeah. Well, it must be standard procedure for them to keep tabs on foreigners.
Yeah. Well, it says here...
Yeah. Well, it seemed like it was for the best.
Yeah. Well, it seems I don't know dad as well as I thought I did.
Yeah. Well, it sounds great,
Yeah. Well, it sounds kind of soapy when you put it like that, but who wouldn't be?
Yeah. Well, it sure is nice to have you home.
Yeah. Well, it surprised the hell out of me, too.
Yeah. Well, it was a long shot, anyway, right?
Yeah. Well, it was all my idea for the style...
Yeah. Well, it was...
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. I had...
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me. I don't need a shrink.
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me. I don't need a shrink.

Yeah. Well, it's just like that,
Yeah. Well, it's just some quantum mechanics
Yeah. Well, it's my job.
Yeah. Well, it's not enough, Annie.
Yeah. Well, it's not great. Only four of ours made it to advanced blasts.
Yeah. Well, it's not helping me.
Yeah. Well, it's not like he's leaving forever.
Yeah. Well, it's not really an ordeal.
Yeah. Well, it's not the end of the world.

Yeah. Well, luck of the draw, I guess.
Yeah. Well, lucky for us... He's no angel.
Yeah. Well, lucky you.
Yeah. Well, maybe that fits both of us.
Yeah. Well, maybe we'll see you around.
Yeah. Well, maybe you guys can figure it out when you're in detention
Yeah. Well, maybe you should read this.
Yeah. Well, maybe.
Yeah. Well, moms are like that.
Yeah. Well, more or less.
Yeah. Well, motel 6 just ain't leaving the light on anymore.

Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.
Yeah. Well, no, I was until that woman turned up missing.
Yeah. Well, no, that includes 50 grand for "wear and tear" on my mother.
Yeah. Well, no. I mean, I want to be one.

Yeah. Well, once his medication kicks in,
Yeah. Well, one of the kids on the paper
Yeah. Well, one of us grew out of it.

Yeah. Well, see you.
Yeah. Well, seed money for what?
Yeah. Well, she called my house.
Yeah. Well, she is not coming home until tomorrow.
Yeah. Well, she needed some extra dough,
Yeah. Well, she thinks I was spying for you.
Yeah. Well, she's crazy. I'm hungry.
Yeah. Well, she's given me another chance.
Yeah. Well, she's in room one if you need her.
Yeah. Well, she's just looking, so it's not really a big deal.
Yeah. Well, she's one crazy lady.
Yeah. Well, she's still got it in her head that
Yeah. Well, sign your name on that.
Yeah. Well, since the I've had to really step up my patrols.
Yeah. Well, since you asked nicely -
Yeah. Well, since you asked nicely -
Yeah. Well, so are puppies.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know?

Yeah. Well, that didn't really work out, did it?
Yeah. Well, that figures.
Yeah. Well, that may be the only good thing I checked for a wallet, no ID. Nothing on him.
Yeah. Well, that takes us through the 90's.
Yeah. Well, that was more his style. Try it now.
Yeah. Well, that was probably involuntary.
Yeah. Well, that was the good part.
Yeah. Well, that was the notion.
Yeah. Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?
Yeah. Well, that'll happen.
Yeah. Well, that's a real firm, a big firm.
Yeah. Well, that's all I have for the moment on that bastard.
Yeah. Well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low income areas.
Yeah. Well, that's easy for you to say. You dated Emmett.
Yeah. Well, that's enough of that. Enough.
Yeah. Well, that's everything I know.
Yeah. Well, that's him all right.
Yeah. Well, that's his M.O., right?
Yeah. Well, that's if I'm still in business.
Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but -
Yeah. Well, that's not all she wanted to give me.
Yeah. Well, that's not enough anymore.
Yeah. Well, that's not me.
Yeah. Well, that's real cool, Schumacher.
Yeah. Well, that's something I'd like to see.
Yeah. Well, that's the theory.
Yeah. Well, that's trouble, my friend.
Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.
Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.
Yeah. Well, that's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah. Well, that's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah. Well, that's what the humane trappers like. It's nice.
Yeah. Well, that's why I'm here, right?
Yeah. Well, that's, uh, kind of a tough sell right now.
Yeah. Well, that... I don't know what to say. I can't comment on that.
Yeah. Well, the Pope can't meet your standards, okay?
Yeah. Well, the broom's in the back, dumb - ass.
Yeah. Well, the captain's pretty lucky.
Yeah. Well, the choice is yours, brother.
Yeah. Well, the director from yesterday doesn't think so.
Yeah. Well, the fact remains,
Yeah. Well, the intruder left some blood on the scene.
Yeah. Well, the last time I saw you, you kinda had your hands full.
Yeah. Well, the only problem is
Yeah. Well, the story is spectacular.
Yeah. Well, the trick - or - theaters are going to probably be done
Yeah. Well, the way we see it,
Yeah. Well, then he can't be dead.
Yeah. Well, then, I'll hold for the on - call nurse.

Yeah. Well, there you have it.
Yeah. Well, there's a first time for everything.
Yeah. Well, there's just one little thing.
Yeah. Well, these things never really get done.
Yeah. Well, they destroyed her fish tank.
Yeah. Well, they probably figured you 'd
Yeah. Well, they probably figured you'd pay a king's ransom
Yeah. Well, they've been buddies ever since, so...
Yeah. Well, they've done that four times to me already.
Yeah. Well, this amount of trace,
Yeah. Well, this is it; this is definitely it.
Yeah. Well, this is my reality.
Yeah. Well, this is not a date.
Yeah. Well, this man's not a terrorist.
Yeah. Well, this man's not a terrorist. You should move on. It's a waste of time.
Yeah. Well, this should put your mind at rest.
Yeah. Well, this should put your mind at rest.
Yeah. Well, this sometimes can be a magnet
Yeah. Well, those are whole pennies.
Yeah. Well, timing was never my strong suit.
Yeah. Well, turns out, she's great.
Yeah. Well, two hours ago,
Yeah. Well, uh, Hizzoner expects your cooperation either way.
