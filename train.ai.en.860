I never did get a chance to drop it off.
I didn't mean to leave stuff. I didn't look through the stuff.
I just... Just sundries I expect.
so I'll send you a wave, soon as I can.
thank you.
Inara, nice to see her again.
so, trap? Trap.
we going in? Only but a few hours out.
Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap?
if that's the case, then lnara's already caught in it.
she wouldn't set us up willing.
might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels.
we go in.
but how can you be sure lnara don't just wanna see you?
sometimes people have feelings.
I'm referring here to people.
you all were watching, I take it.
Yes. Did you see us fight?
no. Trap.
we're about 70 miles from the Training House, and nobody on radar.
if the Alliance is about, they're laying low.
they're about.
find us a home. I'll take the shuttle a little closer.
Zoe, ship is yours.
remember. If anything happens to me...
or if you don't hear from me within the hour...
you take this ship and you come and you rescue me.
what?
risk my ship? I mean it.
it's cold out there. And I don't wanna get left.
dear Buddha, please bring me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and
mal! What are you doing here?
well, you invited me.
I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come.
well, that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?
you knew my invitation wasn't on the level.
which led me to conclude that you must be in some trouble.
I'm fine. I'm giddy.
for a woman schooled in telling a man what he wants to hear...
you ain't much of a liar. Mal, you cannot handle this man.
I have to say, Captain...
I'm impressed that you would come for her yourself.
and that you would make it this far, in that outfit.
I can be very graceful when I need to.
I've no doubt.
what are you doing? I'm praying for you, Mal.
she's very thoughtful.
but I mean it when I say I've no intent to harm you.
speak your piece.
I think you're beginning to understand...
how dangerous River Tam is.
she is a mite unpredictable.
mood swings, of a sort.
it's worse than you know. It usually is.
that girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.
she is an albatross, Captain.
way I remember it...
albatross was a ship's good luck, till some idiot killed it.
Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint.
I've seen your war record.
I know how you must feel about the Alliance.
you really don't. Fair to say.
but I have to hope you understand, you can't beat us.
I got no need to beat you.
I just want to go my way. And you can do that...
once you let me take River Tam back home.
no, no. You're working this deal all crabbed.
you got to open with payment. That is a trap.
I offer money, you'll play the man of honor and take umbrage.
I ask you to do what is right, you'll play the brigand.
I have no stomach for games.
I already know you will not see reason.
the Alliance wanted to show me a reason...
they shouldn't have sent an assassin.
I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain.
we locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo.
I can speak a word and send a missile...
to that exact location inside of three minutes.
you do that...
you'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.
pulse beacon.
advice from an old tracker. You want to find someone, use your eyes.
how long do you think you can really run from us?
I never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains.
and if you're the best they got-- Captain Reynolds...
I should tell you, so that you don't waste your time...
you can't make me angry. Please, spend an hour with him.
I want to resolve this like civilized men.
I'm not threatening you.
I'm unarmed. Good.
I am, of course, wearing full body armor.
I am not a moron. Wait, just let
what, no backup?
making an awful ruckus. They'll come when they're needed.
I'd start whistling.
captain, what do you think is going to happen here?
nothing here is what it seems. He isn't the plucky hero.
the Alliance isn't some evil empire. This is not the grand arena.
and that's not incense.
sir, can you hear me?
just a flash bomb. Go. Go!
what have you done to my shuttle? It's not your shuttle.
head east. Keep her low.
okay, forget the pulse beacon.
there must be another way to track the ship.
get a read on the nav. sat.
it's a registered transport, you must be able to locate.
sir?
Yes, have you found a nav. sat. trajectory?
sir, we found seven.
we've every reason to be afraid.
why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard.
he didn't beat me up. Nobody said that.
because he's a believer.
he's intelligent, methodical, and devout in his belief...
that killing River is the right thing to do.
so no hope of a reward, huh?
did he say anything about a Miranda?
what is that?
don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind.
conjure it might be the reason they're after her.
you think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?
do we care?
are we caring about that?
you dumb-ass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is...
us on this boat.
look, we get back to Haven...
in a few hours' time. Oh, yeah.
hiding under the Shepherd's skirts...
that's a manful scheme.
you wanna run this ship? Yes.
well, you can't.
do a damn sight better job than you.
getting us lashed over a couple of strays.
no offense, Doc. I think it's noble as a grape...
the way you look to River.
but she ain't my sister and she ain't your crew.
Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless.
so, where's it written that we got to lay down our lives for her?
which is what you've steered us toward.
I didn't start this.
no, that's right.
alliance starts the war, and then you volunteer.
battle of Serenity, Mal.
besides Zoe here, how many... Hey, I'm talking at you.
how many men in your platoon came out of there alive?
you wanna leave this room.
damn right, I do.
this isn't the war, Mal.
you telling me that 'cause you think I don't know?
you came to the Training House looking for a fight.
I came looking for you.
I just want to know who I'm dealing with.
I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.
I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.
we'll get off.
river and I will get off at Haven.
we'll find some-- Nobody's saying that.
nobody besides Jayne is saying that.
Mal.
I got no answers for you, lnara. I got no rudder.
wind blows northerly, I go north. That's who I am.
now, maybe that ain't a man to lead, but they have to follow.
so you wanna tear me down...
do it inside your own mind. I'm not trying to tear you down.
but you fog things up.
you always have.
you spin me about.
I wish like hell you was elsewhere.
I was.
no trouble, little crazy person.
we're going for a nice shuttle ride.
she's out. Jayne's down.
the other way. Find her and do not engage.
it's gonna be okay
she's sealed off the bridge. I do not like her there.
check the shuttle. She could have snuck in.
captain.
the government's man, he says you're a danger to us.
not worth helping.
is he right?
are you anything but a weapon?
I've staked my crew's life on the theory you're a person...
actual and whole, and if I'm wrong, you'd best shoot me now.
or we could talk more.
Miranda.
how can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda...
and none of us knowed that?
because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable.
terraforming didn't hold, or some such. Few settlers died.
was it right before the war?
I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep.
you could have asked. Wait a tick, yeah.
some years back, there was call for workers to settle on Miranda.
daddy talked about it. Nothing about it...
on the Cortex. History, Astronomy, it's not in there.
half of writing history is hiding the truth.
there's something on that rock the Alliance doesn't want known.
that's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right?
furthest planet out? It's not that far from here.
whoa. No. No. Honey... That's a bad notion.
...you show them the bad. I got it, baby.
this is us, at Haven, and here's Miranda.
all along here, that empty space in between, that's Reaver territory.
they just float out there, sending out raiding parties.
nobody ventures there. Not even the Alliance.
you go through that, you're signing up to be a banquet.
I'm on board with our standard run-and-hide scenario.
and we are just about...
wait.
doesn't look like Reavers. Wasn't.
shepherd?
shepherd?
shepherd Book?
get the Doc.
shepherd.
don't move. Won't go far.
shouldn't have been you.
alliance should've hit us. Should've hit me.
that crossed my mind.
I shot him down. Yeah. I see.
I killed the ship that killed us.
not very Christian of me.
you did what's right.
coming from you, that means almost nothing.
I'm long gone. No, Doc will bring you around.
I look to be bored by many more sermons before you sleep.
just don't move.
can't order me around, boy.
I'm not one of your crew.
Yes, you are.
river... Come on.
I don't care what you believe. Just believe it.
whatever you...
how come they ain't waiting?
they knowed we was coming, how come they only sent one?
they didn't know we were coming here.
get on the Cortex.
wave, Li Shen, the Sanchez brothers...
anyone who has ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get out.
get out now.
I'm sorry.
if your quarry goes to ground, leave no ground to go to.
you should have taken my offer.
or did you think none of this was your fault?
I don't murder children.
I do.
if I have to. Why?
do you even know why they sent you?
it's not my place to ask.
I believe in something greater than myself.
a better world.
a world without sin.
so me and mine gotta lay down and die...
so you can live in your better world?
I'm not going to live there.
there's no place for me there...
any more than there is for you. Malcolm...
I'm a monster.
what I do is evil.
I have no illusions about it, but it must be done.
keep talking.
you're not getting a location trace off this wave.
and every minute you keep River Tam from me, more people will die.
you think I care? Of course you care.
you're not a Reaver, Mal.
you're a human man and you will never understand how
get these bodies together.
we got time for grave digging?
Zoe, you and Simon rope them together.
five or six. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.
are you insane?
I won't desecrate these bodies.
I don't understand. What do you mean, the bodies
I want you to muck up the reactor core.
just enough to leave a trail and make it read like...
we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.
these people are our friends. Kaylee...
you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.
jayne, you and Wash hoist up the cannon mount. Goes right on top.
piece or two of the other ship, stick it on.
any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that, too.
we're gonna need paint. We're gonna need red paint.
sir...
do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination...
so that we can make a suicidal attempt...
at passing through Reaver space?
I mean to live.
the Alliance won't have that, so we go where they don't follow.
God's balls, there ain't no way we're going out there.
Mal, think about what you're asking.
...those Reavers'll eat us alive
this is how it is.
anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore...
this is your port of harbor.
there's a lot of fine ways to die.
I ain't waiting for the Alliance to choose mine.
I mean to confound these bungers.
take my shot at getting to Miranda.
maybe find something I can use to get clear of this.
so I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out...
or taking your leave, I will shoot you down.
get to work.
sir
just tell me when we're close.
wash.
define "disappeared ."
every reading I'm getting says normal.
oceans, land masses. No tectonic instability or radiation.
Yeah, but no power, either. Nothing at all?
wait.
something.
it might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.
find it.
gravity's Earthnorm.
O2 levels check, pressure...
if anything's wrong the scanner's not reading it.
well, something sure the hell ain't right.
this ain't no little settlement.
we flew over at least a dozen cities just as big.
why didn't we ever hear about this?
beacon's up ahead.
no entry wounds, fractures.
poison?
got another one.
they's just sitting here.
they didn't crash.
Kaylee. Don't...
how come these ones are preserved?
place must've gone hermetic when the power blew.
sealed them. What are they doing?
what's everybody doing?
there's no unusual discoloration.
nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain.
there's gasses that kill painless, right?
they didn't fall. None of them.
they just lay down.
make them stop. They're everywhere.
every city, every...
every house, every room, they're all inside me.
I can hear them all, and they're saying nothing!
get up.
please get up.
please, God, make me a stone.
she is starting to damage my calm.
Jayne. She's right!
everybody's dead.
this whole world is dead for no reason!
let's get to the beacon.
this is the source?
this ship's banged up all to hell.
these are just a few of the few images we've recorded.
and you can see...
it isn't what we thought.
there's been no war here...
and no terraforming event. The environment is stable.
it's the Pax.
the G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.
it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression.
well, it works.
the people here stopped fighting.
and then they stopped everything else.
they stopped going to work...
they stopped breeding, talking, eating.
there's 30 million people here, and they all just let themselves die.
I have to be quick.
about a tenth of a percent of...
the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax.
their aggressor response increased beyond madness.
they have become...
well, they've killed most of us.
and not just killed...
they've done things.
reavers. They made them.
I won't live to report this, but people have to know.
we meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
God!
turn it off.
river. I'm all right.
I'm all right.
this report is maybe 12 years old.
parliament buried it, and it stayed buried till River dug it up.
this is what they feared she knew.
and they were right to fear...
because there's a whole universe of folk who are gonna know it, too.
they're gonna see it.
somebody has to speak for these people.
you all got on this boat for different reasons...
but you all come to the same place.
so now I'm asking more of you than I have before.
maybe all.
sure as I know anything I know this, they will try again.
maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.
a year from now, 10, they'll swing back to the belief...
that they can make people...
better.
and I do not hold to that.
so no more running.
I aim to misbehave.
shepherd Book used to tell me:
lf you can't do something smart...
do something right.
do we have a plan? Mr. Universe.
we haven't the equipment to broadwave this code...
but he can put it on every screen for 30 worlds.
he's pretty damn close, too.
we still got the Reavers...
and probably the Alliance, between us and him.
that's two armies against our one bitty cannon.
it's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr. Universe.
they're gonna see this coming.
no.
they're not gonna see this coming.
no problem. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
from here to the eyes and ears of the 'verse. That's my motto...
or it might be, if I start having a motto.
we won't be long.
you're going to get caught in the ion cloud.
it'll play merry hob with your radar...
but pretty lights and a few miles after you'll be right in my orbit.
you'll let us know if anyone else comes at you?
you'll be the first.
there.
toss me my 30 coin, but I got a newswave for you
call in every ship in the quadrant. We'll meet them in the air.
destroy it all.
wash, we almost through?
now!
go! Move!
I'm reading activity in the cloud. Lock and fire on my command.
you should have let me see her, Captain.
we should have done this as men. Not with fire.
sir.
vessel in range. Lock on.
bastard's not even changing course.
sir!
target the Reavers. Target the Reavers!
target everyone! Somebody fire!
I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar.
chicken's come home to roost.
the hell? It's okay.
I am a leaf on the wind! What does that mean?
we're almost through.
No! No! No! Yes! Yes!
we're not alone.
EMP!
everybody, strap yourselves into something!
Jayne. Got it.
Kaylee, come on.
we're fried. I got no control. Where's the backup?
Where's the backup?
get up!
stop it!
backup reads at 20%. Can you get us down?
I'm going to have to glide her in. Will that work?
I am a leaf on the wind.
watch how
wash, baby. Baby, no. Baby, come on. You gotta go. Come on.
we gotta move. Baby, please. We gotta move, baby, come on.
Zoe!
move out! Now!
go. Go.
head inside!
jayne, rearguard.
Zoe, what've we got? Sir...
this is a good hold point.
we all stay together. No.
they have to come through here.
they'll bottleneck, we can thin them out.
we get pushed back, there's the blast doors.
I can rig them so they won't reopen once they close.
shut them and hide until I get
we need to draw them till it's done.
this is the place. We'll buy you the time.
all right, let's move those crates back there for cover.
make sure they ain't filled with nothing goes boom.
wait, Wash! Where's Wash?
he ain't coming.
move the gorramn crates!
tell me you brought them this time.
Zoe?
are you here? Do the job, sir.
you hold. Hold till I get back.
captain's right.
can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this.
do you really think any of us are gonna get through this?
I might.
no.
Mal.
guy killed me, Mal.
he killed me with a sword. How weird is that?
I got a short span here.
they destroyed my equipment...
but I have a backup unit.
bottom of the complex, right over the generator.
hard to get to. I know they missed it.
they can't stop the signal, Mal.
they can never stop the signal.
the Reavers. They are all made up of rage.
it's okay. It's okay. I can't shut them up.
stay low.
she picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us.
jayne and I take the first wave.
nobody shoots unless they get past our fire.
I didn't plan on going out like this.
I think we did right, but...
no. I never planned... anything.
I just wanted to keep River safe.
spent so much time on Serenity ignoring anything...
that I wanted for myself.
my one regret in all of this...
is never being with you.
with me?
you mean to say, as...
sex?
I mean to say.
hell with this. I'm gonna live.
Mal. Guy killed me, Mal.
he killed me with a sword.
hard to get to.
that's a fact.
Zoe, gorrammit!
Zoe, get your ass back on the line!
you shot me in the back!
I haven't made you angry, have l?
there are a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now.
you have no idea how true that is.
I know the secret.
the truth that burned up River Tam's brain.
rest of the 'verse is going to know it, too. 'Cause they need to.
do you really believe that? I do.
you willing to die for that belief?
I am.
of course, that ain't exactly Plan A.
spine's intact. Just give me a bandage.
up high, left!
Kaylee!
fall back! Everybody, fall back! Fall back now!
jayne, grenade.
very last one.
they're gonna get in.
I can close it from the outside.
no one's coming back from that.
how much ammo do we have?
three, four max, and my swinging cod. That's all.
the lift isn't moving.
when they come, try to plug the hole with it.
I'm starting to lose some feeling here.
lie still. I'm going to give you something...
my bag.
keep pressure here.
my bag.
I need...
adrenaline and a shot of...
calaphar for Kaylee.
I can't.
river.
river, I'm sorry. No.
no.
I hate to leave. You won't.
you take care of me, Simon.
you've always taken care of me.
my turn.
do you know what your sin is, Mal?
hell. I'm a fan of all seven.
but right now...
I'm going to have to go with wrath.
we ain't got long.
you suppose he got through?
do you think Mal got the word out?
he got through. I know he got through.
I'm sorry.
you should know there's no shame in this.
you've done remarkable things.
but you're fighting a war...
you've already lost.
well, I'm known for that.
piece of shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour.
had it moved.
sorry about the throat.
expect you'd want to say your famous last words right now.
just one trouble.
I ain't gonna kill you.
hell, I'm gonna grant your greatest wish.
I'm gonna show you a world without sin.
these are just a few of the few images we've recorded.
and you can see...
it isn't what we thought.
there's been no war here...
and no terraforming event. The environment is stable.
it's the Pax.
the G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.
it was supposed to calm the population
we meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
God!
sir? It's done.
report.
river?
drop your weapons!
do it now.
weapons down. Let it down, now.
I want to see your hands in the air.
stand down. Do it.
targets are acquired.
do we have a kill order?
do we have an order?
stand down.
stand down. It's finished.
we're finished.
it's not over, you know.
I can't guarantee that they won't come after you.
the Parliament.
your broadwave about Miranda has weakened their regime.
they are not gone and they are not...forgiving.
that don't bode especially well for you...
giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt.
I told them the Tams were no longer a threat, damage done.
they might listen...
but I think they know I'm no longer their man.
they take you down, I don't expect to grieve over much.
like to kill you myself, I see you again.
you won't.
there is nothing left to see.
sir, we have a green light.
inspection's pos and we're clear for up-thrust.
think she'll hold together?
she's tore up plenty. But she'll fly true.
make sure everything's secure.
could be bumpy. Always is.
taking her out...
should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.
right.
ready to get off this heap, back to civilized life?
I, uh...
I don't know.
good answer.
so, you gonna ride shotgun with me, help me fly?
that's the plan.
think you can work out
okay.
clearly some aptitude for the...
it ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross.
you know what the first rule of flying is?
well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.
I do.
but I like to hear you say it.
love.
you can learn all the math in the 'verse...
but you take a boat in the air that you don't love...
she'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds.
love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down...
tells you she's hurting before she keels.
makes her a home.
storm's getting worse.
we'll pass through it soon enough.
what was that?
endeavors.
quite a crew you've got.
Yeah, they're a fine bunch of Reubens.
how you keep them on that crap boat, is the subject...
of much musing between me and Fanty.
we go on and on. So I'm noticing.
is there a problem we don't know of?
you got a sweet take kissing your foot.
how's about you take your 25%, we can talk about the next job?
well, our end is 40, precious.
my muscular buttocks it's 40. It is...
as of now.
find anyone around going cheaper...
find anyone around going near...
a sorry lot like you in the first instance.
you're unpredictable, Mal.
you run when you ought to fight.
fight when you ought to deal.
makes a business person a little twitchy.
Miranda.
Hey! A tussle!
Jayne.
do you know that girl?
I really don't.
girl, it's me!
may I see her?
I believe you've got some storytelling to do.
what in the hell happened back there?
start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a 90-pound girl.
cause I don't think that's ever getting old.
do we know if anyone was killed? It's likely.
I know she meant to kill me before the Doc put her out.
which, how exactly does that work anyhow?
it's a safe word.
the people who helped me break River out...
had intel that River and the other subjects were being...
embedded with behavioral conditioning.
they taught me a safe word...
in case something happened. Not sure I get it.
it's a phrase that makes her fall asleep.
if I speak the words-- Don't say it!
it only works on her, Jayne.
well, now I know that.
ln case something happened.
you feel to elaborate on what that something might be?
they never said what-- And you never did ask.
get your hands off
eight months. Eight months, you had her on my boat...
knowing full well she could go monkeyshit...
at the wrong word. You never said a thing.
I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her.
I don't even know what they-- My ship!
my crew!
you had a gorramn time bomb living with us!
who we gonna find in there when she wakes up?
the girl?
or the weapon?
I thought she was getting better.
and I thought they was getting off!
didn't we have an intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?
we couldn't leave them now. No, now that...
she's a killer woman we ought be bringing her tea and dumplings.
in earnest, Mal, why'd you bring her back on?
may I see her?
she goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.
it's crossed my mind.
can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence...
or is this the wrong crowd? Honey.
we're flying a lot blinder than usual here.
we need to get our bearings.
I think we need to talk to Mr. Universe.
Oh, this is good.
you guys always bring me the very best violence.
you think you're in a hot place?
that's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave?
there is no news. There's the truth of the signal.
what I see. And, there's the puppet theater...
the Parliament jesters foist on the somnambulant public.
well, what about this? Did this make the puppet theater?
no, sir. And no lawforce flags, either.
I had to go into the security feed direct.
you can do that? Can't stop the signal, Mal.
everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.
security feeds are a traipse to access...
and I wasn't the first one in.
this has prints on it. So somebody else has been fed this.
Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me.
you're just gonna embarrass yourself.
I have a commitment to my Lovebot.
it was a very beautiful ceremony. Lenore wrote her own vows...
I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.
and she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy.
can you go back?
see if anybody spoke with her before she acted up.
made any kind of contact with her.
Miranda. "Miranda"?
go back further.
no.
please.
Mal, you're very smart.
someone is talking to her. The oaty bar?
subliminal.
it's a subliminal message, broadwaved to trigger her.
I've been seeing this code pop up all over, the last few weeks.
it's Alliance and it's high military.
they have gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend.
and found her, they have.
do you all know what it is you're carrying?
they're afraid of me.
I'm sorry. They should be.
but I'll show them. Oh, God.
it's okay. Hey, it's okay.
show me off like a dog.
old men covered in blood.
it never touched them, but they're drowning in it.
I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying.
in the Maidenhead, you said something.
when you were triggered, do you remember?
the Captain saw you say something on the feed.
Miranda.
Miranda.
ask her.
who is Miranda?
am I talking to Miranda now?
no.
not right.
but I think when they triggered you...
it somehow brought this up.
this memory. It isn't mine.
the memory, it isn't mine.
and I shouldn't have to carry it. It isn't mine.
don't make me sleep again. I won't.
I won't.
put a bullet to me.
bullet in the brainpan, squish.
don't say that. Not ever.
we'll get through this.
things are going to get much, much worse.
thanks for taking us in again, Shepherd.
you got a plan?
hiding ain't a plan?
it'll do you for a spell.
and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin.
but the Alliance will be coming.
they're after this girl with a powerful will.
I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.
you won't.
this isn't a palms-up military run, Mal.
no reports broadwaved...
no warrants.
much as they want her, they want her hid.
that means closed file.
means an operative.
which is trouble you've not known.
I could have left her there.
I had an out.
hell, I had every reason in the 'verse...
to leave her lay and haul anchor.
it's not your way, Mal.
I have a way?
that better than a plan?
only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal.
belief.
you know I always look to you for counsel...
but sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd.
I ain't looking for help from on high.
that's a long wait for a train don't come.
when I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?
they'll come at you sideways.
it's how they think. It's how they move.
sidle up and smile. Hit you where you're weak.
sort of man they're like to send believes hard.
kills and never asks why.
it's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.
I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.
have to tell me about that sometime.
no, I don't.
river?
river, you look tired.
I think everybody's a little tired by now. Why don't we all lie down.
a little peace and quiet will make everything better.
river. Do as you're told. No.
it's going to be fine. Lie down. No.
cut them down.
what? Mal! You up?
I got a wave. I'm gonna bounce it down to you.
Inara.
I... Is this a bad time?
no, this...
good as any.
how's your world? Cold. It's autumn here.
still at the Training House?
so, what occasions the wave? Not that to see you ain't...
well, you look very fine. Oh. Thank you.
so, what was the...
I guess we're having something of a problem here with the locals.
and, I thought maybe-- You could use a gun hand?
I'm hoping not. But if you happen to be close at all, you...
the crew could take your ease here for a while. And there'd be payment.
well, it would be... I mean, I'd like to.
Kaylee's been missing you something fierce.
Oh, man. I miss her, too.
I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.
Yeah, you left, um...
got some of your stuff in a trunk.
I never did get a chance to drop it off.
I didn't mean to leave stuff. I didn't look through the stuff.
I just... Just sundries I expect.
so I'll send you a wave, soon as I can.
thank you.
Inara, nice to see her again.
so, trap? Trap.
we going in? Only but a few hours out.
Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap?
if that's the case, then lnara's already caught in it.
she wouldn't set us up willing.
might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels.
we go in.
but how can you be sure lnara don't just wanna see you?
sometimes people have feelings.
I'm referring here to people.
you all were watching, I take it.
Yes. Did you see us fight?
no. Trap.
we're about 70 miles from the Training House, and nobody on radar.
if the Alliance is about, they're laying low.
they're about.
find us a home. I'll take the shuttle a little closer.
Zoe, ship is yours.
remember. If anything happens to me...
or if you don't hear from me within the hour...
you take this ship and you come and you rescue me.
what?
risk my ship? I mean it.
it's cold out there. And I don't wanna get left.
dear Buddha, please bring me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and
mal! What are you doing here?
well, you invited me.
I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come.
well, that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it?
you knew my invitation wasn't on the level.
which led me to conclude that you must be in some trouble.
I'm fine. I'm giddy.
for a woman schooled in telling a man what he wants to hear...
you ain't much of a liar. Mal, you cannot handle this man.
I have to say, Captain...
I'm impressed that you would come for her yourself.
and that you would make it this far, in that outfit.
I can be very graceful when I need to.
I've no doubt.
what are you doing? I'm praying for you, Mal.
she's very thoughtful.
but I mean it when I say I've no intent to harm you.
speak your piece.
I think you're beginning to understand...
how dangerous River Tam is.
she is a mite unpredictable.
mood swings, of a sort.
it's worse than you know. It usually is.
that girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.
she is an albatross, Captain.
way I remember it...
albatross was a ship's good luck, till some idiot killed it.
Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint.
I've seen your war record.
I know how you must feel about the Alliance.
you really don't. Fair to say.
but I have to hope you understand, you can't beat us.
I got no need to beat you.
I just want to go my way. And you can do that...
once you let me take River Tam back home.
no, no. You're working this deal all crabbed.
you got to open with payment. That is a trap.
I offer money, you'll play the man of honor and take umbrage.
I ask you to do what is right, you'll play the brigand.
I have no stomach for games.
I already know you will not see reason.
the Alliance wanted to show me a reason...
they shouldn't have sent an assassin.
I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain.
we locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo.
I can speak a word and send a missile...
to that exact location inside of three minutes.
you do that...
you'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord.
pulse beacon.
advice from an old tracker. You want to find someone, use your eyes.
how long do you think you can really run from us?
I never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains.
and if you're the best they got-- Captain Reynolds...
I should tell you, so that you don't waste your time...
you can't make me angry. Please, spend an hour with him.
I want to resolve this like civilized men.
I'm not threatening you.
I'm unarmed. Good.
I am, of course, wearing full body armor.
I am not a moron. Wait, just let
what, no backup?
making an awful ruckus. They'll come when they're needed.
I'd start whistling.
captain, what do you think is going to happen here?
nothing here is what it seems. He isn't the plucky hero.
the Alliance isn't some evil empire. This is not the grand arena.
and that's not incense.
sir, can you hear me?
just a flash bomb. Go. Go!
what have you done to my shuttle? It's not your shuttle.
head east. Keep her low.
okay, forget the pulse beacon.
there must be another way to track the ship.
get a read on the nav. sat.
it's a registered transport, you must be able to locate.
sir?
Yes, have you found a nav. sat. trajectory?
sir, we found seven.
we've every reason to be afraid.
why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard.
he didn't beat me up. Nobody said that.
because he's a believer.
he's intelligent, methodical, and devout in his belief...
that killing River is the right thing to do.
so no hope of a reward, huh?
did he say anything about a Miranda?
what is that?
don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind.
conjure it might be the reason they're after her.
you think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?
do we care?
are we caring about that?
you dumb-ass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is...
us on this boat.
look, we get back to Haven...
in a few hours' time. Oh, yeah.
hiding under the Shepherd's skirts...
that's a manful scheme.
you wanna run this ship? Yes.
well, you can't.
do a damn sight better job than you.
getting us lashed over a couple of strays.
no offense, Doc. I think it's noble as a grape...
the way you look to River.
but she ain't my sister and she ain't your crew.
Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless.
so, where's it writ that we got to lay down our lives for her?
which is what you've steered us toward.
I didn't start this.
no, that's right.
alliance starts the war, and then you volunteer.
battle of Serenity, Mal.
besides Zoe here, how many... Hey, I'm talking at you.
how many men in your platoon came out of there alive?
you wanna leave this room.
damn right, I do.
this isn't the war, Mal.
you telling me that 'cause you think I don't know?
you came to the Training House looking for a fight.
I came looking for you.
I just want to know who I'm dealing with.
I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.
I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.
we'll get off.
river and I will get off at Haven.
we'll find some-- Nobody's saying that.
nobody besides Jayne is saying that.
Mal.
I got no answers for you, lnara. I got no rudder.
wind blows northerly, I go north. That's who I am.
now, maybe that ain't a man to lead, but they have to follow.
so you wanna tear me down...
do it inside your own mind. I'm not trying to tear you down.
but you fog things up.
you always have.
you spin me about.
I wish like hell you was elsewhere.
I was.
no trouble, little crazy person.
we're going for a nice shuttle ride.
she's out. Jayne's down.
the other way. Find her and do not engage.
it's gonna be okay
she's sealed off the bridge. I do not like her there.
check the shuttle. She could have snuck in.
captain.
the government's man, he says you're a danger to us.
not worth helping.
is he right?
are you anything but a weapon?
I've staked my crew's life on the theory you're a person...
actual and whole, and if I'm wrong, you'd best shoot me now.
or we could talk more.
Miranda.
how can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda...
and none of us knowed that?
because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable.
terraforming didn't hold, or some such. Few settlers died.
was it right before the war?
I had to show them. I didn't know if you were going to make me sleep.
you could have asked. Wait a tick, yeah.
some years back, there was call for workers to settle on Miranda.
daddy talked about it. Nothing about it...
on the Cortex. History, Astronomy, it's not in there.
half of writing history is hiding the truth.
there's something on that rock the Alliance doesn't want known.
that's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right?
furthest planet out? It's not that far from here.
whoa. No. No. Honey... That's a bad notion.
...you show them the bad. I got it, baby.
this is us, at Haven, and here's Miranda.
all along here, that empty space in between, that's Reaver territory.
they just float out there, sending out raiding parties.
nobody ventures there. Not even the Alliance.
you go through that, you're signing up to be a banquet.
I'm on board with our standard run-and-hide scenario.
and we are just about...
wait.
doesn't look like Reavers. Wasn't.
shepherd?
shepherd?
shepherd Book?
get the Doc.
shepherd.
don't move. Won't go far.
shouldn't have been you.
alliance should've hit us. Should've hit me.
that crossed my mind.
I shot him down. Yeah. I see.
I killed the ship that killed us.
not very Christian of me.
you did what's right.
coming from you, that means almost nothing.
I'm long gone. No, Doc will bring you around.
I look to be bored by many more sermons before you slip.
just don't move.
can't order me around, boy.
I'm not one of your crew.
Yes, you are.
river... Come on.
I don't care what you believe. Just believe it.
whatever you...
how come they ain't waiting?
they knowed we was coming, how come they only sent one?
they didn't know we were coming here.
get on the Cortex.
wave, Li Shen, the Sanchez brothers...
anyone who has ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get out.
get out now.
I'm sorry.
if your quarry goes to ground, leave no ground to go to.
you should have taken my offer.
or did you think none of this was your fault?
I don't murder children.
I do.
if I have to. Why?
do you even know why they sent you?
it's not my place to ask.
I believe in something greater than myself.
a better world.
a world without sin.
so me and mine gotta lay down and die...
so you can live in your better world?
I'm not going to live there.
there's no place for me there...
any more than there is for you. Malcolm...
I'm a monster.
what I do is evil.
I have no illusions about it, but it must be done.
keep talking.
you're not getting a location trace off this wave.
and every minute you keep River Tam from me, more people will die.
you think I care? Of course you care.
you're not a Reaver, Mal.
you're a human man and you will never understand how
get these bodies together.
we got time for grave digging?
Zoe, you and Simon rope them together.
five or six. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.
are you insane?
I won't desecrate these bodies.
I don't understand. What do you mean, the bodies
I want you to muck up the reactor core.
just enough to leave a trail and make it read like...
we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us.
these people are our friends. Kaylee...
you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.
jayne, you and Wash hoist up the cannon mount. Goes right on top.
piece or two of the other ship, stick it on.
any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that, too.
we're gonna need paint. We're gonna need red paint.
sir...
do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination...
so that we can make a suicidal attempt...
at passing through Reaver space?
I mean to live.
the Alliance won't have that, so we go where they don't follow.
God's balls, there ain't no way we're going out there.
Mal, think about what you're asking.
...those Reavers'll eat us alive
this is how it is.
anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore...
this is your port of harbor.
there's a lot of fine ways to die.
I ain't waiting for the Alliance to choose mine.
I mean to confound these bungers.
take my shot at getting to Miranda.
maybe find something I can use to get clear of this.
so I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out...
or taking your leave, I will shoot you down.
get to work.
sir
just tell me when we're close.
wash.
define "disappeared.
every reading I'm getting says normal.
oceans, land masses. No tectonic instability or radiation.
Yeah, but no power, either. Nothing at all?
wait.
something.
it might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.
find it.
gravity's Earthnorm.
O2 levels check, pressure...
if anything's wrong the scanner's not reading it.
well, something sure the hell ain't right.
this ain't no little settlement.
we flew over at least a dozen cities just as big.
why didn't we ever hear about this?
beacon's up ahead.
no entry wounds, fractures.
poison?
got another one.
they's just sitting here.
they didn't crash.
Kaylee. Don't...
how come these ones are preserved?
place must've gone hermetic when the power blew.
sealed them. What are they doing?
what's everybody doing?
there's no unusual discoloration.
nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain.
there's gasses that kill painless, right?
they didn't fall. None of them.
they just lay down.
make them stop. They're everywhere.
every city, every...
every house, every room, they're all inside me.
I can hear them all, and they're saying nothing!
get up.
please get up.
please, God, make me a stone.
she is starting to damage my calm.
Jayne. She's right!
everybody's dead.
this whole world is dead for no reason!
let's get to the beacon.
this is the source?
this ship's banged up all to hell.
these are just a few of the few images we've recorded.
and you can see...
it isn't what we thought.
there's been no war here...
and no terraforming event. The environment is stable.
it's the Pax.
the G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.
it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression.
well, it works.
the people here stopped fighting.
and then they stopped everything else.
they stopped going to work...
they stopped breeding, talking, eating.
there's 30 million people here, and they all just let themselves die.
I have to be quick.
about a tenth of a percent of...
the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax.
their aggressor response increased beyond madness.
they have become...
well, they've killed most of us.
and not just killed...
they've done things.
reavers. They made them.
I won't live to report this, but people have to know.
we meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
God!
turn it off.
river. I'm all right.
I'm all right.
this report is maybe 12 years old.
parliament buried it, and it stayed buried till River dug it up.
this is what they feared she knew.
and they were right to fear...
because there's a whole universe of folk who are gonna know it, too.
they're gonna see it.
somebody has to speak for these people.
you all got on this boat for different reasons...
but you all come to the same place.
so now I'm asking more of you than I have before.
maybe all.
sure as I know anything I know this, they will try again.
maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.
a year from now, 10, they'll swing back to the belief...
that they can make people...
better.
and I do not hold to that.
so no more running.
I aim to misbehave.
shepherd Book used to tell me:
lf you can't do something smart...
do something right.
do we have a plan? Mr. Universe.
we haven't the equipment to broadwave this code...
but he can put it on every screen for 30 worlds.
he's pretty damn close, too.
we still got the Reavers...
and probably the Alliance, between us and him.
that's two armies against our one bitty cannon.
it's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr. Universe.
they're gonna see this coming.
no.
they're not gonna see this coming.
no problem. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
from here to the eyes and ears of the 'verse. That's my motto...
or it might be, if I start having a motto.
we won't be long.
you're going to get caught in the ion cloud.
it'll play merry hob with your radar...
but pretty lights and a few miles after you'll be right in my orbit.
you'll let us know if anyone else comes at you?
you'll be the first.
there.
toss me my 30 coin, but I got a newswave for you
call in every ship in the quadrant. We'll meet them in the air.
destroy it all.
wash, we almost through?
now!
go! Move!
I'm reading activity in the cloud. Lock and fire on my command.
you should have let me see her, Captain.
we should have done this as men. Not with fire.
sir.
vessel in range. Lock on.
bastard's not even changing course.
sir!
target the Reavers. Target the Reavers!
target everyone! Somebody fire!
I am a leaf on the wind. Watch how I soar.
chicken's come home to roost.
the hell? It's okay.
I am a leaf on the wind! What does that mean?
we're almost through.
No! No! No! Yes! Yes!
we're not alone.
EMP!
everybody, strap yourselves into something!
Jayne. Got it.
Kaylee, come on.
we're fried. I got no control. Where's the backup?
Where's the backup?
get up!
stop it!
backup reads at 20%. Can you get us down?
I'm going to have to glide her in. Will that work?
I am a leaf on the wind.
watch how
wash, baby. Baby, no. Baby, come on. You gotta go. Come on.
we gotta move. Baby, please. We gotta move, baby, come on.
Zoe!
move out! Now!
go. Go.
head inside!
jayne, rearguard.
Zoe, what've we got? Sir...
this is a good hold point.
we all stay together. No.
they have to come through here.
they'll bottleneck, we can thin them out.
we get pushed back, there's the blast doors.
I can rig them so they won't reopen once they close.
shut them and hide until I get
we need to draw them till it's done.
this is the place. We'll buy you the time.
all right, let's move those crates back there for cover.
make sure they ain't filled with nothing goes boom.
wait, Wash! Where's Wash?
he ain't coming.
move the gorramn crates!
tell me you brought them this time.
Zoe?
are you here? Do the job, sir.
you hold. Hold till I get back.
captain's right.
can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this.
do you really think any of us are gonna get through this?
I might.
no.
Mal.
guy killed me, Mal.
he killed me with a sword. How weird is that?
I got a short span here.
they destroyed my equipment...
but I have a backup unit.
bottom of the complex, right over the generator.
hard to get to. I know they missed it.
they can't stop the signal, Mal.
they can never stop the signal.
the Reavers. They are all made up of rage.
it's okay. It's okay. I can't shut them up.
stay low.
she picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us.
jayne and I take the first wave.
nobody shoots unless they get past our fire.
I didn't plan on going out like this.
I think we did right, but...
no. I never planned... anything.
I just wanted to keep River safe.
spent so much time on Serenity ignoring anything...
that I wanted for myself.
my one regret in all of this...
is never being with you.
with me?
you mean to say, as...
sex?
I mean to say.
hell with this. I'm gonna live.
Mal. Guy killed me, Mal.
he killed me with a sword.
hard to get to.
that's a fact.
Zoe, gorrammit!
Zoe, get your ass back on the line!
you shot me in the back!
I haven't made you angry, have l?
there are a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now.
you have no idea how true that is.
I know the secret.
the truth that burned up River Tam's brain.
rest of the 'verse is going to know it, too. 'Cause they need to.
do you really believe that? I do.
you willing to die for that belief?
I am.
of course, that ain't exactly Plan A.
spine's intact. Just give me a bandage.
up high, left!
Kaylee!
fall back! Everybody, fall back! Fall back now!
jayne, grenade.
very last one.
they're gonna get in.
I can close it from the outside.
no one's coming back from that.
how much ammo do we have?
three, four max, and my swinging cod. That's all.
the lift isn't moving.
when they come, try to plug the hole with it.
I'm starting to lose some feeling here.
lie still. I'm going to give you something...
my bag.
keep pressure here.
my bag.
I need...
adrenaline and a shot of...
calaphar for Kaylee.
I can't.
river.
river, I'm sorry. No.
no.
I hate to leave. You won't.
you take care of me, Simon.
you've always taken care of me.
my turn.
do you know what your sin is, Mal?
hell. I'm a fan of all seven.
but right now...
I'm going to have to go with wrath.
we ain't got long.
you suppose he got through?
do you think Mal got the word out?
he got through. I know he got through.
I'm sorry.
you should know there's no shame in this.
you've done remarkable things.
but you're fighting a war...
you've already lost.
well, I'm known for that.
piece of shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour.
had it moved.
sorry about the throat.
expect you'd want to say your famous last words right now.
just one trouble.
I ain't gonna kill you.
hell, I'm gonna grant your greatest wish.
I'm gonna show you a world without sin.
these are just a few of the few images we've recorded.
and you can see...
it isn't what we thought.
there's been no war here...
and no terraforming event. The environment is stable.
it's the Pax.
the G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.
it was supposed to calm the population
we meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
God!
sir? It's done.
report.
river?
drop your weapons!
do it now.
weapons down. Let it down, now.
I want to see your hands in the air.
stand down. Do it.
targets are acquired.
do we have a kill order?
do we have an order?
stand down.
stand down. It's finished.
we're finished.
it's not over, you know.
I can't guarantee that they won't come after you.
the Parliament.
your broadwave about Miranda has weakened their regime.
they are not gone and they are not...forgiving.
that don't bode especially well for you...
giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt.
I told them the Tams were no longer a threat, damage done.
they might listen...
but I think they know I'm no longer their man.
they take you down, I don't expect to grieve over much.
like to kill you myself, I see you again.
you won't.
there is nothing left to see.
sir, we have a green light.
inspection's pos and we're clear for up-thrust.
think she'll hold together?
she's tore up plenty. But she'll fly true.
make sure everything's secure.
could be bumpy. Always is.
taking her out...
should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.
right.
ready to get off this heap, back to civilized life?
I, uh...
I don't know.
good answer.
so, you gonna ride shotgun with me, help me fly?
that's the plan.
think you can work out
okay.
clearly some aptitude for the...
it ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross.
you know what the first rule of flying is?
well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say.
I do.
but I like to hear you say it.
love.
you can learn all the math in the 'verse...
but you take a boat in the air that you don't love...
she'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds.
love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down...
tells you she's hurting before she keels.
makes her a home.
storm's getting worse.
we'll pass through it soon enough.
what was that?
when do you stop looking at each other?
shouldn't there be a warning?
shouldn't somebody say to us, "Hey, watch out, pay attention"?
because you can be thinking, "I'm okay, we're okay, we're good.
then you turn around and... a distance between you.
Zorany! Miro!
I've got a little job for you.
the Speed Merchants?
I'm sorry, I apologize. Traffic.
Yeah, bad traffic for three days?
Hi, Bea.
Hi, Dad.
very exciting.
okay, Bea.
no, I want... - Stop with the balloon.
no, stop, stop.
who's that?
that's one of the cleaners. - Yeah.
it's the cleaner, yeah.
Yeah, you know her-- Erika.
she's staggering.
staggering. Why do you have a picture of one of the cleaners on your computer?
I was just experimenting with my camera.
I was just, um, you know, "Can I just...? Oh, that's good.
come on.
it's all right for you, mate, you've got a gorgeous, Swedish wife.
girlfriend.
half Swedish.
you cannot say girlfriend after ten years.
you all right?
I mean, isn't that true?
you've been there, are you gassed in Sweden if you're ugly?
or maybe just given a penis, because some of the men can be very ugly, but I've never seen an ugly Swedish woman.
Jesus, look at Liv.
Oh, I love this space.
we do. We think it's a steal. Thanks for coming.
that's us. Let's go!
are we crazy?
no.
about what?
king's Cross.
sandy still thinks we're crazy to move there.
it's so... the area.
it's a great office, isn't it?
and it was a...
it's a great project, it was a great night.
I don't know.
it's all great.
thank you for making an effort tonight.
the launch, I know it's not your...
but it really helped.
it's okay. It's fine.
was it an effort?
what? That's her.
that's Bea.
no, that's a fox.
no, it's her, she was exhausted.
they're taking over London. I hate that noise.
it's so late.
how can she just not sleep?
I don't think going to her always...
I don't know if that helps.
I know you don't.
let's go back and see someone.
I've seen too many someones.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
listen, what you're doing, the whole project, for London, the office, everything-- it's wonderful.
I think it can genuinely be something...
rubbish.
terrible. - ...Genuinely rubbish-like.
crap.
I'll come back.
down, hold...
one, two, three.
turn, one, two, three.
bea, darling, it's 3: 30 in the morning.
we have to stop this.
one, two...
Hello?
Yeah, well, no, I mean, I'm his partner, so...
Yes, I am.
What?!
Hi.
officer, this place is my business.
go on, go ahead.
my partner's in there already. - Okay.
I had everything on that laptop, my life is on that laptop.
I'm very sorry, sir.
will! Will!
all the computers, my laptop, the petty cash...
well, how did they get in?
through the roof.
what about the alarm? - They turned it off.
well, how do they know the code?
I wasn't here. I don't know.
Jesus Christ. - Do you have cleaners?
it's not the cleaners.
this is covered in glass.
it's not the cleaners.
I know it's... I know the cleaners.
how can we have a break-in on our first day?
unless the cleaners have turned into a bunch of acrobats.
who is it?
it's Zoran and Miro.
Hey. - Hey.
how's my best nephew, hmm?
Dragan. - Huh?
see my hands? See his?
Uh-huh.
his dad had the big brains.
I had the big hands.
your dad had hands like a girl's.
and the girls loved him.
it's the same with you two.
my son is the clumsy one.
this is for you.
wipe everything.
you know how to do that?
erase everything?
they'll be delivering new computers, and then you can go back in, my little monkey.
Hi, Mom.
how was school?
it was okay.
lots of homework?
no, not really.
not really?
Mirsad, you've not been at school for weeks.
they sent another letter.
it's a mistake-- half the time they don't know who's there and who's not there.
now we have to go back to see people at the Social Services.
we survived.
do you understand?
we survived, and that's not free.
I didn't ask to survive.
imagine your father.
if we could offer him just one day, one hour-- imagine...
you have a life and you are throwing it away.
I don't even remember him.
I don't remember him.
where do you go?
where do you go every day?
I'm working, I'm earning money.
you have to go to school.
that's what we promised, with police and the court.
otherwise, they'll put you in prison.
I'll be 16 in three months.
Mirsad...
you're a clever boy.
you're clever, you've got a brain.
I have to go. I'm late.
if somebody, if one of his family, if any of our people are leading you, I'm telling you, if anyone of them is, I'll kill them!
and I wouldn't care!
we've never really had a proper diagnosis, but I've always known Bea was special.
Yeah!
she's double happy, double sad, double excited, double awake, double needy-- well, no, triple needy, actually.
I know even...
even when Bea was ten months old, she, she was... already distressed by noise.
sh-she would only sleep with a particular blanket next to her or-or eat with a particular spoon.
lately it's been getting worse and she can't sleep at all.
she can't manage at school, where, uh...
all of us, just completely at our wits' end.
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm late.
...eat foods of a certain color.
sorry.
sorry.
I'm Rosemary McCloud.
Hi, Rosemary. I'm Will.
Where's Bea?
Oh, no, Bea...
no, the structure is that before I begin any sort of diagnosis,
I'd like to meet the parents first, alone.
right, great.
so I'm just, uh, finishing with Liv.
um...
well, I'd like to, uh, listen to these documentaries.
I must have heard them in the past.
uh, no, they're mostly World Service.
Liv explained that she's going to semi-retire until Bea gets...
that's not true.
effectively. - Will...
it's, it's either Bea's gymnastics,
Bea's art therapy, Bea's music therapy, it's a sacrifice is all I'm saying.
Liv won prizes for the work she did, did she tell you that?
it's a big sacrifice is all I'm saying, hmm.
I was just explaining to Rosemary...
she's up all night.
...that, um, in these past few months, that Bea's gotten worse.
hmm. - Yeah.
and, uh, she's not sleeping, and... it's intense.
Yes.
Hav-Have either of you-- therapy
have either of you considered ever-ever thought about doing that or...?
I did see someone.
when?
for a while, 'cause I can get low sometimes.
I just go into low... - Wow.
um, my father died and my mother died - and my sister died and... - Hmm.
it's family with a short life expectancy.
and a grandmother of 93.
and a grandmother of 93.
but some days the cup is empty and some days its 93% full.
were you, um, were you brought up in Sweden or...?
Oh, my father was American, and I went to university there.
Uh-huh. - Chicago.
addicted to cold.
no.
uh, are you concerned about Bea?
sure, you know, but Liv is...
Liv worries so much, there's, there's not much room... for...
you know, but a 13-year-old girl who collects batteries, doesn't sleep, doesn't let us sleep, won't eat anything, spends all day wanting to do somersaults, I mean, yeah, sure, I'm concerned.
of course I'm concerned.
Liv says that you're wrapped up in your work.
wrapped up? Wrapped up?
that's fair.
I love how working hard, working really hard, becomes wrapped up, becomes something selfish.
I love that.
when you say that you love it, do you mean that you don't love it?
let's just back up.
we love Bea.
it's not a competition to see who loves her the most.
if it were a competition, I would happily let Liv win.
you win.
it says here your father died, your husband, your sister.
this was where? Sarajevo?
um, Miro and I left with the Red Cross.
my husband stayed behind and was, uh, he stayed behind and was murdered.
you're Serbs?
my husband was Serb. I'm Muslim.
uh, it's complicated.
we're Bosnian, we're all Bosnian...
it's complicated.
do you have relatives in Britain?
my husband's family.
his brother, sisters and aunt.
it was a time when a smack around the ear or my auntie would give me a thump.
matter of fact, she punctured my eardrum at one point, but you knew where you were.
simple, we're all simple.
what about you, Sonny Jim?
what have you been up to while you've not been at school?
back thieving, stealing again? Hmm?
see, things are not things.
things are always somebody's things.
car is Jack's car, 'cause he worked for it.
your Prada jacket is little Kevin's Prada jacket, before it was his-- I can see your little brain ticking over.
his Prada jacket belonged to Mr. Prada.
what about before that?
before what?
before it was Mr. Prada's?
did it belong to the women who made it?
cause my mom does that-- makes clothes for other people, slaves for other people.
or like when prisoners make trains.
next time you're going down.
we'll catch you, and then you can discuss who owns the trains with your cell mates.
back in a minute.
sorry I'm late again, but everything is here.
all the Macs. Everything》 - It's okay.
excellent. Thank you. - Thank you.
excuse me. You dropped this.
Oh, thanks, Erika.
Oh, please, come up, Erika. It is Erika, isn't it?
Yes, sir. - Sandy.
we set the alarm, sir.
I did it myself.
you have my word.
I'm not accusing you.
the police have already called my mobile phone, asking me questions.
Yeah, that is normal.
about this thing and then that thing.
I'm so sorry.
it was like Kafka.
where did you get your car?
why are you ordering takeaway?
you know, we try to do a good job.
you-you do, you do do a very good job.
Erika, listen.
we have to have a new code for the alarm.
now, we're going to give you your own code,
you're going to choose it, not us, so there's absolutely no way of you being wrongly accused of anything.
is that a deal? - Okay, thanks.
Oh, listen.
I had your picture on my computer.
what would the burglar make of that?
my photograph?
Yeah. Well, from when I was, um, trying my camera out, if you remember.
so, the burglar, someone who didn't know the context, would think you were a friend or a girlfriend.
I mean, someone standing over there who couldn't hear us, what would he make of this?
well, apart from my uniform.
of course apart from the uniform, yeah.
but say, if we were too far away to see the uniform.
y-you know? And I could give you this book, and you know, for all matey-boy over there knows, that's a collected works of Franz Kafka, that's your birthday...
or the Bible. - Or the Bible.
uh...
the model hasn't changed.
of course I know.
because we'd have to plant...
why isn't she moving?
you can't take a fish out of the water.
I have 50 e-mails.
why isn't she moving? - She's dead.
you can't take a fish out of the water.
okay, put her down. - Darling, listen to Mommy.
no, no, you can't take a fish out of the water.
no, no, don't put her back in.
you can't take a fish out of water!
she needs water.
sandy, no, I can't get to the office.
if you can get to the office for me.
well, I can't because I'm needed here.
you're right, you can't take a fish out.
you can't, but she's dead. See? She's dead.
you can go? Okay, that's great. Thank you.
it's okay. We'll bury her. - I'll speak later.
okay, this is what we're going to do.
we're going to put her in a little box.
Oh, don't cry, darling.
don't cry.
come on, we're going to put her in a box...
new code. Two, one... seven, eight.
it's my date of birth.
now what are you doing?
let's go! Leave it.
come on, let's go!
come on!
get the door!
Oh!
Jesus Christ!
fucking hell.
Oh...
this is brilliant.
you're really going to do all this, I mean, put a canal right through the middle?
Yeah.
it's brilliant.
I'm Bruno Fella, CID.
are you Sandy or Will?
I'm Will. - Hello, Will.
Hi. - You know what?
I was born right there, just about there.
I'd have drowned.
Mm.
I love it.
I think it's really nice.
this is Sandy, um, Hoffman, my partner.
sandy. - Hello.
detective Bruno Fella, CID.
Hi, Bruno.
I'm just saying this is a fabulous building.
I think it's brilliant.
thank you.
was it you had the scrape with the villains?
no, I wouldn't say it was a scrape.
well, they scraped my car.
no, I was running late for the first break-in.
I wasn't quite prepared for the second.
well, I get it, completely.
you know, completely get it, you know?
you're, um, disgruntled.
I would be, you know, putting all that effort into making such a fabulous building, you know, in an off-style community.
you know, you don't need the grief, do you?
well, it's no fun, Bruno.
you know, financially it's a disaster.
the insurance is gonna be through the roof.
you know your problem, Sandy?
what's my problem?
king's Cross.
is what? What is it?
I mean... that's you there.
you got a British Library over there with Eurostar, and bang in the middle you got crack village with a load of Somalians walking about with machetes.
it's an area in flux.
Oh, they left a computer disk, the burglars.
did you know that? With my photographs.
Oh. What do you mean? Where?
sorry, they returned it.
more than that, they downloaded my personal photographs off my laptop, that they stole the first time, and they brought it back.
well, can we see it?
Yeah.
lovely.
so they got compassion.
I won't go that far.
well, I'm not saying you gotta show them compassion.
you know, you're just like my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend.
they're the criminals, they're the bad guys.
can I have a go?
there... Don't you just love a Mac?
sweet, huh?
and what do you say to your girlfriend?
I'm the Old Bill, Will, you know?
I've been on the beat, undercover, in a suit, you know, it's the law.
it's, uh, Einstein's law of relativity.
what does that mean, exactly, sir? Relativity?
well, relatively speaking, um, it means, if me and Sandy here break the law, you know, we're gonna get a decent lawyer.
hmm.
now these guys who broke in here, they go straight to jail. Do not pass Go.
one law for us, one for them.
except we haven't broken the law.
everyone's broken the law.
our vision for King's Cross, for the public spaces of King's Cross, starts with the premise that we acknowledge an urban landscape is a built landscape.
it starts as an argument with society's phony love affair with nature.
we are against the mistaking of grass for nature, of green for nature.
king's Cross is an area of North London associated with poverty, crime, vice and urban decay.
our job is to transform the landscape, not decorate it with green...
because how we feel about ourselves, how we behave, is directly affected by the space around us.
how we design the outdoors of our city is as important as how we design the indoors.
we're gonna take the canal, and use it like calligraphy, like ink, to write around the development.
we think it's the cleaners.
what about the cleaners?
breaking in.
they don't even clean properly.
it's true. They don't.
they never empty the dishwasher or load it, for that matter.
they bring their kids, their boyfriends.
come on. - They do.
and to be honest, Will, it's getting a little traumatic.
I'm staying late at the office and worrying that the place is gonna be ransacked while I'm in it.
look, they're cleaners and they're not clean.
okay.
good, thanks.
thanks for the tea, thanks for the theory.
I'm sorry, but what does that mean?
it means your boyfriend's been to the office, Ruby, and yours, Wei Ping, and yours, actually, Joe, so where do the rules say we can have boyfriends, but the cleaners can't?
or kids.
and... explain this to me, please.
how the cleaners are getting up onto the roof then swinging through the roof line, and why they are, when they've already got the keys and codes?
all right.
Hi.
I've just been trying to defend our cleaners.
Uh-huh.
well, I've just spoken to the alarm company.
whoever broke in used the cleaners' code.
what do we actually do if we see a burglar?
call the police? Kill them?
there's a weird ecology, of course, to these break-ins.
the new computers, they're upgrades, you know, they're new models.
you could argue that...
a break-in every, oh, say, six months, it's good business, isn't it?
just not every six days.
I wish they would steal this car, for instance.
42, 000 miles.
I've got the criminal mind.
lots of wanting to be bad.
see an ass, want to bite it.
I just never do.
good.
good.
what you've done, there is you strayed from the moral to the criminal, and you crossed the moral-criminal divide.
wanting to bite an ass is a moral issue, and then only if the ass belongs to someone who objects to the idea.
criminal would be biting the ass without permission.
you're such a lawyer.
Yeah.
anyway, then what?
then what, what?
you bite the ass, then what?
well, then... they bite yours.
is the theory.
it's so long since I've bitten or been bit...
it's good to talk about that.
Mm.
the problem is, you find out we're all so miserable.
Hello, hello.
he doesn't look happy.
do you recognize him?
uh... no. I don't know.
God, I wish I could lip-read.
hang on.
I think I can.
I don't like you anymore.
I like Sandy.
he's everything I want in a man.
and stop burgling his bloody office.
God.
hello.
got a light?
we don't smoke. Sorry.
but there is the car lighter.
all right.
so is it?
course it is.
I don't believe it.
okay.
I've got nothing on under my coat.
well, this, this might warm you up.
Christ.
Oh, God.
okay?
have a good night.
Christ.
can I get inside? It's cold.
sorry. Come on, this is a car.
it's not a community cent... Jesus Christ.
Hey. Come on.
um... - So what are - you guys looking for? - Huh?
Oh, fuck. Fuck.
are you spying on us?
no. - Not at all.
who's this? - It's insulting.
no, we're... - Seriously, we've been...
did you not trust us.
this your girlfriend?
no, she's not my girlfriend.
Trust-- if you have to say it, it means there is none.
use a condom.
that's my answer to trust.
sure, I trust you-- use a condom.
one minute you're nice to me, the next you're spying on me.
no, Erika. Erika, listen.
Erika.
Uh-oh.
please, please, can you just listen? Please.
50 pounds, whatever you want.
what's your name?
except talk.
what if I want to talk?
call the Samaritans.
Oh, please.
you know, I don't have time for this.
humans.
chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.
we talk.
Why?
I don't know.
animals don't talk, because they don't lie.
Erika!
a ridiculous idea.
that was good?
you really helped.
we should, uh...
we need, we, we need to lock up.
you work here?
Yeah.
Yes.
bad place for an office.
what's your project about?
I don't really know.
a place I'd like to live in... or run through.
I would love to jump, you know...
chik, chik, chik... jump from building to building. Chika-chik, chik.
this is amazing.
but what?
no buts. Is that amazing?
Yeah.
but dangerous.
Oh.
no buts.
you see the city?
what is it like?
better.
did my dad just not want to come with us?
uh... He, um...
he loved you, but, uh, he was engineer.
he was needed.
every bridge was blown up. So...
anyway, it's more complicated.
no story from Sarajevo is simple.
No! No!
I don't want to.
No! No!
there's no bread.
no bread, no butter, no flour, no dairy.
nor last night. You didn't notice.
I did.
hmm.
we're trying a diet.
how's the chicken?
chicken's good.
good.
ice cream is dairy.
ice cream is dairy,
that's right.
sweetie, try the chicken.
try the chicken first.
this is a diet just for you.
bea, put those things back, now.
have some chicken.
rosemary suggested we try this.
where is it? - Remember her?
where is it? - Therapist Rosemary.
what have you done with the ice cream?
there's amazing stuff about the affect of food on mood, on the brain.
rosemary.
I chose it!
she said that?
Wow.
it's not fair!
every time I say something in this house, it gets repeated back as a question.
you know I like ice cream!
if I say "good morning," people ask me what makes me think it's a good morning.
what? - No ice cream!
I'm trying to hold this family together, Will.
there's no ice cream, Mama.
who are "people"? Who are these mysterious people?
I feel a fool with my sun box, I do, but it's the only sun you can rely on in this house.
I want the ice cream! - No, Liv... Hey, Liv, come on.
what are you talking about? - Why have you taken it away?!
I wanted a slice of bread. You know what? Really?
can we, can we just try this?
can we try this as a family, please?
just as a family for a week?
don't say try together if we don't decide together.
well, don't take a side together, if we don't cook together or talk together or do anything together.
it's not fair! - We don't do anything together.
there we are. - Exercise...
exercise... - "There we are" what?
stop that. - Exercise. Exercise...
you don't even hear it, Will.
you don't even hear it. - Exercise, exercise...
eat your chicken first!
No! - Stop yelling.
chicken? I'm a vegetarian.
don't you yell at me. - You don't eat vegetables.
it's disgusting! - You don't eat vegetables.
disgusting! Disgusting! - Will you stop?
no, it's disgusting! No, leave me alone!
now, what we know is, if we smash things and we scream and we shout, we get our own way.
that's what we know. Or run away.
great... Great.
that's great.
Liv.
Liv, darling.
or we just say nothing!
because God forbid we ever...
we ever say what we actually meant!
no, just let the shutter come down!
anyway...
I really have to get back to the office.
bea, my car keys. Where's the battery? Bea.
Hey, I need the battery.
we're human. Don't punish us.
we get fed up.
fed up. Is that about the diet?
no. It means upset. I don't know why.
it's a metaphor, remember? We spoke about those.
"Cried your eyes out" doesn't mean your eyeballs fall out.
metaphors. "Fed up."
it's nothing to do with food.
Where's my battery, Bea?
it's in my box. - Where's your box?
it's my box. You can't go in my box.
well, you go get the battery. - Bea.
it's all right. We're working it out.
bea, go and get Will's battery.
"Will's battery"?
can you explain to me why you suddenly need to go to the office?
you know why. - You're not the police.
no, and the police are not night watchmen.
nor are you. Most wives would worry if their husbands went cruising in King's Cross - every night. - Come on.
hire a security company, Will.
most wives are married to their husbands, as we're being so accurate tonight.
dads, wives, Will's battery. Thanks for that.
I don't see the real father around much.
I love your sun box, whatever the fuck it's supposed to do.
I keep hoping it'll warm you up.
skinny cup, extra shot, right?
right.
Thanks.
Oh. I brought a CD.
I've got some CDs.
no. For dancing.
I like to dance.
in cars?
inside, outside, upside down.
I can dance on your lap, but it's not - for free. - Absolutely.
I still make you come, but not inside me.
some guys think that's not cheating.
hmm?
I need a man to make me love， to make me sing, I need a man to make me feel like I'm a queen.
that's good.
you are. You're very good.
you're great.
that's okay. It's fine.
what do you mean?
it's okay.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
you smell of perfume.
I don't know how I do.
nor do I.
I love you.
is that an answer?
it's the truth.
what do you need?
what do you want ever?
I feel as if I'm tapping on a window.
you're somewhere behind the glass, but you can't hear me.
even when you're angry, like now, it's like someone long, long way away is angry with me.
well, glass is better than ice, which is where we were earlier.
sweden, ice, depression, the high rate of suicide?
Mm-hmm.
I never got close to anybody who didn't want to talk about that.
Mm. - Or free love.
Liv Ullmann. - Liv Ullmann.
who's Norwegian, by the way.
well, there are no other Swedes to talk about?
nobody lives there.
you could drive for hours before you pass another Volvo.
Abba.
let's face it. It's a sad old list.
what about the English?
you brought us what? Sarcasm?
Mm. - And the Beatles.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
knowing me, knowing you. A-ha.
lager louts.
no. You invented lager.
excuse me. The Danes.
Yeah, same difference.
no, no, no.
I love your laugh.
I love your laugh.
I'd like to gather up all your laughs and lock them in a box, like Bea's, and nobody would be allowed the key.
where are you going?
the shower.
or to kill that fucking fox.
come back here.
mama? - I'll take you.
I'm taking you. - Mom takes me. No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm taking Bea. I want to. Go back to sleep.
mom takes me.
daddy will take you today.
it's fine. It's fine.
see? I'm up.
it's okay.
seat belt, Bea.
what's that?
is that a CD?
Yeah.
Yes, it's a CD.
is it yours?
n... Yes.
shut up!
"shut up" is good, isn't it?
excellent.
I did it!
I did it! I did it!
you watch, I'm going to do it again.
Paul? Paul, are you ready?
are you ready?
sweetie, you're still wet.
you're dripping.
yellow towel.
it's not yellow. Is it yellow?
yellow stitching.
Oh.
you have to dry yourself.
I did. I used the hair dryer.
well, how about my sweater?
it's kind of a towel.
is it a good color?
it's a good color, and it's a sort of towel.
but you'll be cold.
no. If I get cold, I'll wear the towel.
Hey, look. Those guys-- they're amazing.
I want a lesson.
Oh!
mom, are you okay?
you okay? Get up.
Oh, you're soaked.
excuse me. We would like to donate our towel.
no, I'm fine, thanks.
really, we hate our towel.
we hate our towel. We do. We hate it.
it's looking for a new home.
thank you.
come on, lovey.
that was good.
you should join the circus.
get off me!
it's cold.
it's a bit cold.
why wind down the window?
to get some air.
Why?
you know.
quite a strong perfume.
actually... - It's my job.
I got you a present.
in return for the CD, the coffees...
it's good, I think.
my wife uses it. She says it's good.
that's fucked up.
what man wants to be with a girl that smells like his wife?
no, I didn't say I wanted to be with a girl.
you think I like to smell like this?
you think I like to wear panties which cut my pussy in half?
I didn't mention your...
men are incredible!
thank you.
so what, you clean this area up?
is that the plan? - Not exactly.
if you work with nature, why are you so against nature?
well, A: I'm not, and B: I'm absolutely not.
the fox in your garden.
what about the fox in my garden?
the one wild thing in your life and it makes you crazy.
you know, turn the whole world into a park, - like Disneyland. - That's not what we do.
with flowers... - Oh, that's ironic, because that's the opposite of what we do.
go ahead, clean up, because we will move to another alley, and we'll take the foxes with us.
good.
because this is the human heart.
this is the world. It's light and dark.
this is what, the human heart? This is the world?
this is shit.
you're talking shit.
I have to charge you.
huh? - No, I have to charge you.
you crossed the line.
what do you mean? - We have chit chat, it's free.
I keep warm, I buy coffee.
it's a trade.
you abuse me, that's business.
how did I abuse you?
men abuse me, I get paid. 50 pound.
no way am I giving you 50 pounds.
50 pound.
I'm not giving you 50 pounds.
50 pounds!
no.
fuck! - Oh.
Uh-oh.
he's like a monkey. - I've got to call the police.
what? To say what?
to say what?!
there's a man breaking into my building!
it's not a man, it's a boy.
I've got a special thing, a code, four-three, uh...
no, I'm Hoff... Yes, I'm Hoff...
well, my partner's Hoffman.
where am I?! I'm in my car!
I'm looking at him!
I'm... four...!
Hey!
wait!
come here!
fuck.
Hey!
we're getting out of here.
what about Miro?
what about Miro?
what happened to your hand?
forgot my keys.
you're bleeding.
no.
I didn't fall, Mom.
why can't you do it?
you're a tailor.
dad!
dad! Dad!
I'm too old to chase robbers.
dad! All right, hey.
Oh. Hey, what are you crying about?
where the hell have you been?
we've been worried sick.
why is Mommy crying?
why aren't you in bed?
I near... I could've caught him. I nearly caught him.
the police weren't going to get here, so I followed him.
I mean, I imagine, it's just a boy.
what did the police do with my car?
the police?
they were here for probably about a minute.
so what are you telling me?
somebody's stolen my car?
eh? - Oh...
my bag's in there, the wallet, my keys.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Will.
you left the car open?
Yeah, well, I was chasing a thief, Liv.
did you get a look at this boy?
no, not really.
Hey, hey...
it's okay.
reminds me of when I first met you, driving around, trying to get her to sleep in the back.
you in your nightgown.
remember?
so beautiful.
will, a boy can still stab you.
now, what if you'd caught up with him?
I don't know.
anyway, he's not going to come back.
it's probably all over now.
Zoran...
Zoran, watch.
Hey, did you see that?
did you see that? I just landed it.
Yeah, yeah, nice.
you're in the wrong place, man.
I telephoned earlier about my jacket.
Yes.
this is strange. You probably don't remember, we bumped into each other the other day at the sport center.
we gave you our towel.
Oh, that's right.
so, I've, uh, I tore my jacket.
Oh, I can't repair that.
well, I can, but... you'd always see the tear.
I don't think, the cost, I don't think is worth doing.
Really?
it's a favorite. I'd hate to throw it away.
I can try.
come back Friday.
great. Friday.
good, I'll see you on Friday.
Friday.
excuse me! - Excuse me!
your wallet.
it was in your jacket.
Oh, thank you. It's new.
I've already lost one wallet this week.
thank you.
I was rude, I'm sorry.
this city, you know, you see someone in one place, and then another, it makes you very...
sure.
I have to get back. - All right.
can you...
if I, if I brought a suit,
I lost some weight-- if I brought it tomorrow, say?
I'm out tomorrow.
friday then?
okay.
thank you for this.
will, she's asleep.
huh? - It's a miracle.
I can't believe it.
that's great, huh?
why are you trying on suits?
nothing really fits me.
it looks fine.
can I say "Rosemary says"?
Absolutely. What does Rosemary say?
she says...
well, you know, it's: Bea says "I need."
I say "I'm here," she says, "I need,"
I say "I'm here."
I'm not talking about going to work tomorrow, I'm just thinking about going back to work.
good.
and start thinking about you.
about us.
bea can come with me sometimes.
she can dig, make a mess.
no, that's great, but you're busy and distracted.
And?
go on.
and...
she's not my daughter.
and right now when she's such a, she's so...
you can't trust me to take care of her.
if you were measuring how far away from where we need to be, you and me is that a long way?
I don't think you can ask a question like that. It's...
put on a suit, sound like a suit.
it feels a long, long way right now...
from where it needs to be.
I wish we could unsay and unhurt back to wherever that is, and start again.
and how far back?
I remember you bit me.
you were angry with me and you bit me.
I don't remember why.
I don't know why either, but I remember I bit you.
you really bit me.
and I thought we were very close.
we were.
Yeah, but that's just teeth.
it's not invisible, but...
that's amazing.
astonishing, great.
shall I put it on? - Yes.
is there, somewhere?
uh, yeah, my son's room.
just there.
is he in...?
no, no, he's at school.
your son, is he studying to be an architect?
no, he's only 15.
it's a school project.
I'm an architect...
of sorts.
hmm.
funny.
your son's project.
we use those figures.
they're scale figures.
they're from Japan.
hard to find in London.
Oh.
he must get them from school.
uh, your trousers?
you have, uh, children?
Oh, you were with a little girl.
my daughter. - Uh-huh.
I remember her.
this will take a week, at least.
I'll have to remove the lining.
that's fine.
I'll write you a bill for the jacket.
should I just write "repairs"?
Yeah.
what's this?
a practice keyboard.
no space for piano up here.
you can play electric or electronic keyboard?
um, no, I'm happy with this.
you know, I imagine.
you know, so.
not a good place to make noises.
you could always use headphones.
I'm fixing this and I, um, should mind my own business.
people like me from my country, we-- I'm Bosnian
we think it's dangerous not to be able to hear.
tell your son if he's interested, he can come and see our office, you know, to look around.
we're very close.
king's Cross.
I might do that.
will Francis is your name?
Mm. - Hmm.
she'll never be his daughter.
you wish Bea was Will's daughter, is that it?
I wish she was.
I wish she was.
then maybe we'd all be happy.
I don't want to be cold.
I don't want to be sad.
I don't want to be angry with him anymore.
I have this light box.
what kind of light box?
for depression.
the doctor prescribed it and I sit in front of it for hours.
it's supposed to stop me from getting down.
give me an image of that change that you hope for in Will.
he's looking at me.
sugar?
uh, no, thank you.
I think you'll want sugar.
okay.
are you unhappy?
what makes you say that?
you always seem, when you come here, I don't know.
I'm happy enough.
happy enough.
so English.
I think it was the happiest day, really...
when Bea was born.
and then sometimes I think...
sometimes I think Bea was punished because I left my husband and I left Sweden.
and then I met Will, and he was kind.
and we were happy, we really were.
but then I just push him away, I don't know why.
I just push him away from me.
Oh, this is, um, this is going to sound really stupid.
I forgot the shirt.
I was going to bring a shirt for you, you to copy and...
I forgot, I forgot it.
um, all right.
should I go back and get it?
I can go back and get it now.
and I'd be, like, two seconds.
okay.
or perhaps when you come for the suit?
it's a bad time?
you mean without the shirt?
right, that doesn't make any sense, does it?
uh...
I'm going to the supermarket.
right. - I have to go to work.
how do you get the shopping home?
uh, bus.
I'm practically driving a bus.
my car's stolen, so I have a company van.
it's electric.
you could probably walk faster.
pedestrians will overtake us.
say yes, and what's the worst thing that could happen?
Yes.
tell me about your son.
Mirsad? - Mirsad?
it's, um...
he hates his name, but was a name for Sarajevo, not for London.
now his name's Miro.
but I think he should love his name.
you know, names in my country, they're like flags.
you can live or die because of your name.
Mirsad-- it's a Muslim name.
it should be Serbian because of his father, but, you know, I can be stubborn sometimes.
you what?
stubborn sometimes.
but that name saved his life.
when we, when we were getting out of Sarajevo, we came out with Red Cross, leaving the siege.
the guards, the Serbs, stopped us at one of the checkpoints, and they took him, they took my son, and they said what's your name?
and he said, "Mirsad, my name is Mirsad," his Muslim name.
well, if he told his family name, the Serbian name, "Simic,
they might have taken him as a son of a traitor.
anyway, since then, I don't think he's ever really...
he-he gets in trouble.
that's another story.
I can't talk about siege in supermarket, sorry.
we had a break-in.
several, actually, in our office.
something gets smashed,
I mean, I mean, not just the windows.
but not all breaking's bad, is it, you know?
I mean, you break habits.
maybe, maybe before you repair the window, you should smash a few more.
that's all I do, you see, in my job, I tidy up.
there's a mess between buildings, and we come in.
squeeze in bits of green, like dressing.
like lipstick, like pretty.
anyway, that's a roundabout way of saying...
the shape of your mouth,
I could probably draw it by heart.
what are you thinking?
I was thinking, uh, that was a roundabout way of saying you're married, which I know, and I was thinking
bosnian men would say less, but, uh...
would want more.
they love to talk, they love talk, believe me, but, uh, talk for them is politics, women for them is not talk.
that's crushing.
I didn't mean it bad.
she's going to be disappointed, but okay.
Yeah. I have to take the boys to cricket.
here's Mom.
dad can't make it.
Aw...
but here's what we're going to do.
it's okay. Look, sweet...
why can't Dad come?
because he's working. He can't make it in time.
he never comes.
we have the videos, video, video, video.
Hey! Hoopla.
stop. That stop there is very good.
I know. I realize.
again, again.
again? - Again.
what do you think?
she's great, eh? - Great.
it's good, too, because the batteries are back in the remote.
it's a mystery how these batteries finally went home just when we need them.
big mystery.
how did you video this and be in the picture at the same time?
paul was cameraman.
Paul? - Bea's trainer.
you've met him a hundred times.
paul loves Mom.
no, Paul loves Bea.
but...
does Paul love me?
if you could do anything right now, what would it be?
I have to work, I have to get back.
Oh, come on.
let me think. I don't know, uh...
change everything up until this moment.
uh, not my son, everything else.
I can't do that for you.
you didn't say what could you do.
what would I do is what you said, not what you could do.
what could I do?
Why?
I-I-I don't understand.
I don't understand, either.
if I had a magic wand, I don't know, persuade my son to come to Sarajevo with me, start a new life.
and you, if you could do anything right now, what would you do?
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey, are you waking up?
Mm-hmm.
I made bread.
I can smell them.
it's hot. Careful.
you're happy.
is that so strange?
put on the telly; it might be on the news.
ha! You are not so big I can sit on you.
Ah, Miro.
we should go home this summer to Sarajevo.
I think you would love it.
Tanja says there are flights for a few pounds.
maybe.
maybe.
your grandmother would cry for weeks.
great.
what's this?
Oh, uh, I-I forgot.
I put it in your room. - Where'd you get it?
it's a customer.
I sewed his jacket.
he's an architect.
he said, uh, you could go and look at his office.
what's the matter?
I have to go out.
what did you say to him?
wh-wh-what do you mean?
did he go in my room?!
no. Just to try some trousers.
why do people have to go into my room?!
miro, dushma, he's a good person, he's a good man.
he was just trying to help.
you think everyone is good.
no one is good.
what are you...
what is it?
I'm in such shit.
she's taken back the laptop.
she what?
she's taken back the laptop.
that is so fucked up.
she says they're friends.
Yeah, but that's like, "Hello, my son did it."
lock him up.
she says she's going to talk to him, do some sort of deal.
Papa. Papa.
will!
what?
lady looking for you.
what?
a lady is looking for you.
are you okay?
what is it you want from me?
nothing, I don't want anything.
because you don't just walk into someone's life and knock on their door and kiss them.
you cannot do that. - I know that.
what? What-what's the matter?
you used me; you have someone else.
Oh, you mean Liv? - Promise me, promise me.
that's the last thing I want, believe...
promise you what?
promise you I'm not flirting?
I know what that is. - I don't believe you.
I know what that is, - and this is not what it is. - I don't believe you.
I don't...
I can't talk anymore.
I want to go somewhere and not talk.
not talk.
I have a friend; she... she works.
maybe she would lend her place.
it's close to here.
call her.
it's not a hotel, it's not a palace
call her.
what's her number?
the clothes under my clothes, they're not...
I've always wanted to make something in silk.
I'm, uh, giving myself to you.
I want it to be worth something.
come here.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm, uh, I never met somebody when I was already in their bed.
I'm Will.
thank you.
I'm Tanja.
it's good to have a man in my bed.
I hope it's contagious.
I'll get my, uh...
"don't kill the boy," Brave Benoit said, "but Dai replied, "'Why not? I come from the Isle of Wight.
we eat young boys a lot."
but secretly, Dai had a heart. He kept it in a jar.
he hadn't seen that jar for years.
he found it in his car.
great reading.
that's not reading, that's knowing by heart.
there's a metaphor.
where?
to know by heart.
"Forgive, forget, and eat more jam," the jar said on the lid.
dai ate some jam and thought a lot, and in the end, he did.
go home and be a better boy, although sometimes, it's tricky.
there is a moral to this tale:
jam makes fingers sticky.
well done.
sticky jam.
okay, my sweetie.
it is now time for you and bunny to get some sleep.
you're a monkey, be a wise monkey.
somebody asks you a question, you know nothing, you see nothing, you hear nothing.
I'm not a monkey for sure.
your mother's a Muslim dog. They have loose tongues.
are you my brother's son, or your mother's?
we'll find out.
and you don't come to the car wash.
you don't come to our house...
if the police find anything, we're all going to prison......
hurry up!
you're a thief-- I'll kill you!
go ahead, dent the dents.
get away from my boy!
it's no wonder my brother was fucking someone else.
I don't want you in this house!
sure, whatever. - Understand?
Mirsad.
why didn't you give it back?
I will, I will.
I will give it back.
I don't get it.
he knows, doesn't he?
why doesn't he just tell the police?
I don't get it.
will?
Yeah.
you should come and see this.
what? - Come... come see.
just left here.
keys are inside.
I need... a man
what does that mean?
I don't know.
will, is there something going on with you?
I don't know.
something's going on with me.
Erika, you know, Erika...
...forgave me, and, uh, well...
it's early doors, but you know, you know, lattes have been drunk.
that's great.
sandy, can we go somewhere? Can we drive somewhere now?
will... - Anywhere?
don't tell me you're fooling around, okay?
I'm just entering fidelity; don't exit.
it's not about fooling around.
it's always about fooling around.
fucking hell.
will, I've, I've got to...
and so have you.
Oi!
where do you think you're going?
get on the back.
I'm late for school.
Yeah, two years late-- get on the back.
you're in a lot of trouble, son.
put your helmet on; it makes you invisible.
and don't stab me while I'm driving.
you'll fall off.
everybody's chasing around looking for evidence
fingerprints, DNA.
I just look at the buildings and I know it's you. I know.
someone's doing very well, and you're not.
I mean, what do you earn, a few quid, pair of trainers?
you're the bit you spit out to your friends
whoever they are-- and I know who they are.
they're not your friends.
how long are we staying?
Ah... she's lovely.
they should tip London on its side and let a few million people slide right off, you see?
there's no air.
there's no air in a cell.
none.
and that's where you're going, no question, and that's a tragedy.
which of us is lying the most?
about what?
that's not even the right question.
which of us is lying to themselves the most?
what?
about this.
I'm not lying.
I have, um...
a photograph.
what photograph?
of us.
it's, uh...
incriminating is-is the right the word.
I don't know if it's the right word, unless I know what you're talking about.
it took me a little while to make sense of the jacket.
you suddenly appearing at my door.
that you'd been following my son.
you must know that mothers will do anything to protect their children.
why-why would you take a photograph?
was that when your friend came back?
why would you do that?
why would you do this?
you steal someone's heart; that's a real crime.
and then what? You call the police?
no.
I don't know... No!
did you know how long...
do you know how long since anybody touched me?
I should have told you, I know. I should have said something.
it wasn't a plan.
it wasn't a plan-- it was you, that's the truth.
I have to get out.
is that why you come to bed with me?
for what, a photograph?
how squalid.
the water is cold.
but what about...? But it...
it doesn't make any sense.
what about today?
or now?
look, a lie, that's right. That's my...
that's me-- I lie, I lie.
can't we drawn a line and say no more lies between us?
no more lies.
no, I have to ask you to lie, to continue to lie.
I have to beg you not to report my son.
that's what this is: a bribe.
if you like.
I'm, um... not stopping.
old Bill's been at our place.
he says he's going to try and charge my dad.
you shouldn't be here.
what if they followed you? Then what?
so? There's nothing for them to find here, is there?
they've been down the car wash, as well, making out with all this evidence.
they've got nothing. Trust me, nothing.
Hey!
Zoran! The laptop!
they'll find my laptop!
Oi!
up there!
come on!
get to the other end.
come on! - Come on!
don't do it!
Hey!
little bastards are going through Eastern Avenue, Eastern Avenue, on their way!
the towpath!
Miro!
Miro! - I'll head him off.
Miro! Miro!
don't, don't move him.
come on!
don't move!
I'm sorry.
you going to be okay?
Uh-huh.
show Mommy she can go to her work, we can do ours.
hmm?
wei Ping, can you just...?
...exactly as it says on the model.
number nine needs to go left.
all right, take it back, please.
Yeah, way left.
to the very end.
at least three feet to the left.
the model's not bad.
number nine is.
way back!
will? - Yeah?
a couple colleagues of mine.
this is Erin and Lorna, this is Mr. Francis.
hello. - Hello.
was a fair result all around on the burglary, and the DNA matched, and we got most of your stolen goods back.
Yes, Sandy said, um, he's a young boy?
Yeah, he's 15.
he's been in and out of trouble.
you know, final warning.
he's going to prison.
if he gets convicted he will, yes.
he'll go to Youth Detention Center.
is this your computer, Will?
it's got all your files on it.
well, then it must be. Great.
well, I'm afraid we're going to have to keep it just until the case comes to court.
bea? Bea, no!
Bea! - Wei Ping, could you just...?
I'm okay, I'm fine.
darling, stay with Wei Ping.
this is a hollow victory for us, ain't it, girls?
it is, yeah.
I mean, he's just the little runt who's done all the dirty work.
we can't make a case against the adults.
they're the real villains.
Yeah, it's hollow.
well, you may find it hollow, we find it whatever is the opposite of hollow.
of course, we understand.
because actually, it's been like a siege, okay?
we have felt under siege, and worse than that, innocent people have been wrongly accused, our cleaners, you know, it's very degrading.
it's because we know the boy, you know?
I mean, there's nothing wrong with him.
nothing wrong? He's a thief, that's what's wrong with him.
well, there's no question.
will, all this is about some court...
it's not a court. - Conciliation court.
whereby, if we go along to meet the boy...
what is it?
explain, it's a Camden thing.
he gets let off, hooray.
it's not a court.
me and Lorna, we work on the Youth Offenders team, and we encourage the offenders to face their victims.
right, so we go to the court, arrange to meet him...
not a court, sorry, whatever court it is, and he might not go to prison?
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
the law's an ass.
look, he's a boy.
the last thing he needs is prison.
you know he's a Bosnian boy, and his mom, well, well, they're refugees, and his mom's, his mom's in pieces.
Mr. Francis, what do you think?
you've been very quiet.
I just, I want to draw a line under the whole thing.
Bea!
somebody call an ambulance!
I'm so sorry! I am so sorry!
all right, don't move.
it's gonna be all right.
I'm here, I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
Hi, sweetie.
my fibula's broken, two places.
Ouch.
and they have to put wires in to fix it.
Oh.
the doctor said, she said what?
she said that I'd be up and climbing again in no time.
hmm. We've got an X-ray if you want to see.
definitely.
sorry.
Oh, sweetie, don't be sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorriest.
daddy cried. - I did not.
I laughed on the wrong side of my face.
is it hurting? - It did.
we had painkillers.
bea had two, daddy had four.
you did not.
so, listen, Mommy's going to stay, okay?
and I brought everything.
I brought Stuffy.
this hospital's very peculiar.
they don't understand color, do they?
tried to put us in a yellow room.
I need to speak to Mommy.
mommy's here.
I need to speak to Mommy by myself.
will?
okay.
you have four new messages.
Hello, Will, it's Amira.
I need to see you.
uh, call me. Thank you.
Hello, Will, it's Amira. Uh...
I'm sorry.
first of all, I want to give you this, which are the pictures.
I wish, I wish they hadn't caught him.
I wish I hadn't hurt you.
truly.
then help me. Help him.
I can't.
this meeting with Miro and police, if you came, it would...
I really can't.
he'll go to prison.
he's agreed, Miro.
if you help him, he'll come back with me to Sarajevo.
he won't say anything in court except he's sorry,
I promise you.
you're a good person; I know you.
don't do that. Don't do that. - Please.
don't do that. - Please.
Amira, I can't, I can't do what you want.
how can I?
if I meet your son, it will come out that I know you, how I know you.
please, help me.
I can't help you. I can't help you.
I can't. I'm sorry.
please! Please!
listen, I really tried to get him out of trouble.
they've got too much evidence.
come on. I can't.
please, please, please, I'm begging you.
I can't.
I beg you. I beg you. - Amira, please.
I beg you! I beg you!
please, please help.
I can't. I can't.
I was determined not to blame you.
and I know it wasn't your fault, I know it wasn't this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
no, it's me who should be saying sorry.
I've been looking for love out there.
I thought I might have found it.
and did you?
I think I might have lost the love I did have.
the love of my life.
did I?
Liv, I need to tell you everything.
I need to tell you what I've done.
I thought you were going.
I can't go.
I slept with her.
it was hard enough to tell you that last night.
that was bad enough without saying it in public, without hurting you twice.
when you hurt this much, you can't be hurt twice.
I was looking at you...
and I was thinking how long since I'd looked at you.
I don't even know how to be honest.
maybe that's why I like metaphors.
because what I want to say is there's a circle
yours and Bea's-- and I'm not in it.
but that's just to justify it, because there's a part of me so dark, that sees that circle as a cage.
Thanks.
will.
you made it.
come in and sit down.
I'm sorry, there, um...
th-this is, there's been a big mistake.
mistake? - Yeah, um...
Yeah. This boy is definitely not the burglar.
I know him, and I know his... I know his mother.
what do you mean you know them?
they came to our office. They came to the office.
well, how can that be?
you were told their names, yet you never said you recognized them.
I don't remember you saying the name "Simic.
you definitely didn't say "Simic.
Miro and I know each other.
actually, very well.
um, Miro is, um, interested in architecture.
Mrs. Simic?
he is, yes.
no, I'm asking is it true that you and Mr...
um, Francis.
Francis-- know each other?
Mr. Francis is, um, I've done some work for him, adjusting his suit.
I think this Mrs.-- Mrs. um,
Amira is being... discreet.
what do you mean, discreet?
Amira is being discreet about the nature of our relationship, which was not an appropriate one, and I think she's trying to save me from embarrassment, from the embarrassment of myself and my family.
and that's why she, um, that's why she's not saying sh-she came to the office with Miro.
I remember it, though; it was the day of the last burglary.
and Miro cut his hand, and that's obviously where the, uh, well, that's where the DNA confusion occurred.
Mr. Hoffman?
Mr. Hoffman, do you know anything about this?
no. No, I can't say I do.
is this some sort of
I mean, are we supposed to believe this?
actually, I've met both of them at the office.
Yes.
and I-I dressed the boy's cut, didn't I?
Yeah.
wai-- hang on a minute.
we recalled a computer, which you claimed had been stolen.
Yeah, I lent
I lent Mrs. Simic my laptop sometime when we were, um, together.
she takes photographs, and I was showing her how to store them, um, what to do with them, how to delete them.
I'd completely forgotten; I was, um...
I was confused.
I'm sorry.
really sorry.
what you did back there, you gave that boy back his life.
stop the car.
what?
Liv, what are you doing?
you just don't get it, do you?
what? - Oh, God.
we just go home, right?
we just go home, nothing happened, nothing happened.
Liv?
go, go to Bosnia, go! - I can't hear you.
get back in the car, Liv.
just go, go.
why were you looking for love?
ask yourself. Why?
why weren't you looking for me?
Liv, get back in the car.
no. I don't want you in the house!
I don't want you in the house!
God!
God, you drive me out.
you marry me then!
no, I don't want a husband!
I want a good night's sleep.
no. Marry me.
no. - Marry me.
I'm sorry. - No!
I want you back.
then win me back. - How?
I don't know.
how? What will I do? What do I do?
I don't know! - I've been such an idiot.
just tell me what I have to do.
I don't know!
look, I love you. I love you.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mirsad.
we never met, did we; I'm Will.
Hi.
so you're off to Sarajevo?
you wanted to say something, right?
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
and... - Wait.
sandy, have you got a minute?
I just wanted to say that I was sorry and thanks for what you did.
you've given me another chance.
okay, thanks for coming in.
thank you.
this, I think, is the stuff my mom mended for you.
tell her...
tell her thanks for mending stuff for me.
I thought maybe your mother would come with you.
Yeah, she was going to, but she's packing.
is she?
thank you.
what is this?
again, again.
again? - Again.
what do you think?
she's great, eh? - Great.
it's good, too, because the batteries are back in the remote.
it's a mystery how these batteries finally went home just when we need them.
big mystery.
how did you video this and be in the picture at the same time?
paul was cameraman.
Paul? - Bea's trainer.
you've met him a hundred times.
paul loves Mom.
no, Paul loves Bea.
but...
does Paul love me?
if you could do anything right now, what would it be?
I have to work, I have to get back.
Oh, come on.
let me think. I don't know, uh...
change everything up until this moment.
uh, not my son, everything else.
I can't do that for you.
you didn't say what could you do.
what would I do is what you said, not what you could do.
what could I do?
Why?
I-I-I don't understand.
I don't understand, either.
if I had a magic wand, I don't know, persuade my son to come to Sarajevo with me, start a new life.
and you, if you could do anything right now, what would you do?
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey, are you waking up?
Mm-hmm.
I made bread.
I can smell them.
it's hot. Careful.
you're happy.
is that so strange?
put on the telly; it might be on the news.
ha! You are not so big I can sit on you.
Ah, Miro.
we should go home this summer to Sarajevo.
I think you would love it.
Tanja says there are flights for a few pounds.
maybe.
maybe.
your grandmother would cry for weeks.
great.
what's this?
Oh, uh, I-I forgot.
I put it in your room. - Where'd you get it?
it's a customer.
I sewed his jacket.
he's an architect.
he said, uh, you could go and look at his office.
what's the matter?
I have to go out.
what did you say to him?
wh-wh-what do you mean?
did he go in my room?!
no. Just to try some trousers.
why do people have to go into my room?!
miro, dushma, he's a good person, he's a good man.
he was just trying to help.
you think everyone is good.
no one is good.
what are you...
what is it?
I'm in such shit.
she's taken back the laptop.
she what?
she's taken back the laptop.
that is so fucked up.
she says they're friends.
Yeah, but that's like, "Hello, my son did it.
lock him up.
she says she's going to talk to him, do some sort of deal.
Papa. Papa.
will!
what?
lady looking for you.
what?
a lady is looking for you.
are you okay?
what is it you want from me?
nothing, I don't want anything.
because you don't just walk into someone's life and knock on their door and kiss them.
you cannot do that. - I know that.
what? What-what's the matter?
you used me; you have someone else.
Oh, you mean Liv? - Promise me, promise me.
that's the last thing I want, believe...
promise you what?
promise you I'm not flirting?
I know what that is. - I don't believe you.
I know what that is, - and this is not what it is. - I don't believe you.
I don't...
I can't talk anymore.
I want to go somewhere and not talk.
not talk.
I have a friend; she... she works.
maybe she would lend her place.
it's close to here.
call her.
it's not a hotel, it's not a palace
call her.
what's her number?
the clothes under my clothes, they're not...
I've always wanted to make something in silk.
I'm, uh, giving myself to you.
I want it to be worth something.
come here.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm, uh, I never met somebody when I was already in their bed.
I'm Will.
thank you.
I'm Tanja.
it's good to have a man in my bed.
I hope it's contagious.
I'll get my, uh...
don't kill the boy," Brave Benoit said, "but Dai replied, "'Why not? I come from the Isle of Wight.
we eat young boys a lot.'
but secretly, Dai had a heart. "He kept it in a jar.
he hadn't seen that jar for years.
he found it in his car.
great reading.
that's not reading, that's knowing by heart.
there's a metaphor.
where?
to know by heart.
forgive, forget, and eat more jam,' the jar said on the lid.
dai ate some jam and thought a lot, "and in the end, he did.
go home and be a better boy, "although sometimes, it's tricky.
there is a moral to this tale:
jam makes fingers sticky.
well done.
sticky jam.
okay, my sweetie.
it is now time for you and bunny to get some sleep.
you're a monkey, be a wise monkey.
somebody asks you a question, you know nothing, you see nothing, you hear nothing.
I'm not a monkey for sure.
your mother's a Muslim dog. They have loose tongues.
are you my brother's son, or your mother's?
we'll find out.
and you don't come to the car wash.
you don't come to our house...
if the police find anything, we're all going to prison...
hurry up!
you're a thief-- I'll kill you!
go ahead, dent the dents.
get away from my boy!
it's no wonder my brother was fucking someone else.
I don't want you in this house!
sure, whatever. - Understand?
Mirsad.
why didn't you give it back?
I will, I will.
I will give it back.
I don't get it.
he knows, doesn't he?
why doesn't he just tell the police?
I don't get it.
will?
Yeah.
you should come and see this.
what? - Come... come see.
just left here.
keys are inside.
I need... a man
what does that mean?
I don't know.
will, is there something going on with you?
I don't know.
something's going on with me.
Erika, you know, Erika...
...forgave me, and, uh, well...
it's early doors, but you know, you know, lattes have been drunk.
that's great.
sandy, can we go somewhere? Can we drive somewhere now?
will... - Anywhere?
don't tell me you're fooling around, okay?
I'm just entering fidelity; don't exit.
it's not about fooling around.
it's always about fooling around.
fucking hell.
will, I've, I've got to...
and so have you.
Oi!
where do you think you're going?
get on the back.
I'm late for school.
Yeah, two years late-- get on the back.
you're in a lot of trouble, son.
put your helmet on; it makes you invisible.
and don't stab me while I'm driving.
you'll fall off.
everybody's chasing around looking for evidence
fingerprints, DNA.
I just look at the buildings and I know it's you. I know.
someone's doing very well, and you're not.
I mean, what do you earn, a few quid, pair of trainers?
you're the bit you spit out to your friends
whoever they are-- and I know who they are.
they're not your friends.
how long are we staying?
Ah... she's lovely.
they should tip London on its side and let a few million people slide right off, you see?
there's no air.
there's no air in a cell.
none.
and that's where you're going, no question, and that's a tragedy.
which of us is lying the most?
about what?
that's not even the right question.
which of us is lying to themselves the most?
what?
about this.
I'm not lying.
I have, um...
a photograph.
what photograph?
of us.
it's, uh...
incriminating is-is the right the word.
I don't know if it's the right word, unless I know what you're talking about.
it took me a...
a little while to make sense of the jacket.
you suddenly appearing at my door.
that you'd been following my son.
you must know that mothers will do anything to protect their children.
why-why would you take a photograph?
was that when your friend came back?
why would you do that?
why would you do this?
you steal someone's heart; that's a real crime.
and then what? You call the police?
no.
I don't know... No!
did you know how long...
do you know how long since anybody touched me?
I should have told you, I know. I should have said something.
it wasn't a plan.
it wasn't a plan-- it was you, that's the truth.
I have to get out.
is that why you come to bed with me?
for what, a photograph?
how squalid.
the water is cold.
but what about...? But it...
it doesn't make any sense.
what about today?
or now?
look, a lie, that's right. That's my...
that's me-- I lie, I lie.
can't we drawn a line and say no more lies between us?
no more lies.
no, I have to ask you to lie, to continue to lie.
I have to beg you not to report my son.
that's what this is: a bribe.
if you like.
I'm, um... not stopping.
old Bill's been at our place.
he says he's going to try and charge my dad.
you shouldn't be here.
what if they followed you? Then what?
so? There's nothing for them to find here, is there?
they've been down the car wash, as well, making out with all this evidence.
they've got nothing. Trust me, nothing.
Hey!
Zoran! The laptop!
they'll find my laptop!
Oi!
up there!
come on!
get to the other end.
come on! - Come on!
don't do it!
Hey!
little bastards are going through Eastern Avenue, Eastern Avenue, on their way!
the towpath!
Miro!
Miro! - I'll head him off.
Miro! Miro!
don't, don't move him.
come on!
don't move!
I'm sorry.
you going to be okay?
Uh-huh.
show Mommy she can go to her work, we can do ours.
hmm?
wei Ping, can you just...?
...exactly as it says on the model.
number nine needs to go left.
all right, take it back, please.
Yeah, way left.
to the very end.
at least three feet to the left.
the model's not bad.
number nine is.
way back!
will? - Yeah?
a couple colleagues of mine.
this is Erin and Lorna, this is Mr. Francis.
hello. - Hello.
was a fair result all around on the burglary, and the DNA matched, and we got most of your stolen goods back.
Yes, Sandy said, um, he's a young boy?
Yeah, he's 15.
he's been in and out of trouble.
you know, final warning.
he's going to prison.
if he gets convicted he will, yes.
he'll go to Youth Detention Center.
is this your computer, Will?
it's got all your files on it.
well, then it must be. Great.
well, I'm afraid we're going to have to keep it just until the case comes to court.
bea? Bea, no!
Bea! - Wei Ping, could you just...?
I'm okay, I'm fine.
darling, stay with Wei Ping.
this is a hollow victory for us, ain't it, girls?
it is, yeah.
I mean, he's just the little runt who's done all the dirty work.
we can't make a case against the adults.
they're the real villains.
Yeah, it's hollow.
well, you may find it hollow, we find it whatever is the opposite of hollow.
of course, we understand.
because actually, it's been like a siege, okay?
we have felt under siege, and worse than that, innocent people have been wrongly accused, our cleaners, you know, it's very degrading.
it's because we know the boy, you know?
I mean, there's nothing wrong with him.
nothing wrong? He's a thief, that's what's wrong with him.
well, there's no question.
will, all this is about some court...
it's not a court. - Conciliation court.
whereby, if we go along to meet the boy...
what is it?
explain, it's a Camden thing.
he gets let off, hooray.
it's not a court.
me and Lorna, we work on the Youth Offenders team, and we encourage the offenders to face their victims.
right, so we go to the court, arrange to meet him...
not a court, sorry, whatever court it is, and he might not go to prison?
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
the law's an ass.
look, he's a boy.

you know he's a Bosnian boy, and his mom, well, well, they're refugees, and his mom's, his mom's in pieces.

then win me back. - How?
I don't know.
how? What will I do? What do I do?
I don't know! - I've been such an idiot.
just tell me what I have to do.
I don't know!
look, I love you. I love you.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mirsad.
we never met, did we; I'm Will.
Hi.
so you're off to Sarajevo?
you wanted to say something, right?
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
and... - Wait.
sandy, have you got a minute?
I just wanted to say that I was sorry and thanks for what you did.
you've given me another chance.
okay, thanks for coming in.
thank you.
this, I think, is the stuff my mom mended for you.
tell her...
tell her thanks for mending stuff for me.
I thought maybe your mother would come with you.
Yeah, she was going to, but she's packing.
is she?
thank you.
what is this?
I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it?
and it's going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
so, please, remember to cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
come on, guys, time to go home.
come on, love, off you get.
do we have to? - Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.
he squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
beat up another 10-year-old?
this one deserved it. - Yeah.
five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk.
moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
don't kill Cedric.
who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
shut up. - "He's going to kill me, Mum."
where is your mum?
where is your mum, Potter?
she dead?
is she dead?
is she a dead Pott...?
Dudley. - Dudley, let's go.
what's going on? - What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley.
come on, Dudley, hurry up.
dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
don't put away your wand, Harry.
they might come back.
dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
after You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?
good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent.
now, get inside and stay there.
expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
it is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
there's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
is that you?
duddy. Vernon, come quick.
we're going to have to take him to a hospital.
who did this to you, boy?
happy, are we, now?
you've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
this is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense.
dear Mr. Potter. - What?
the Ministry has received intelligence that at 6: 23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
as a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
justice.
he's not very well.
sorry, Hedwig.
very clean, these Muggles.
Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural.
professor Moody.
what are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course.
but where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled.
you haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point.
but the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing?
don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.
not here, Nymphadora.
don't call me Nymphadora.
stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
come on, you, around the corner.
come on.
in you go, son.
there've been no sightings.
no deaths. No proof.
he almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you know what is the most important...
we must trust Dumbledore on this.
was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.
his instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down.
he's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.
Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.
heavens, you're all right.
bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
if my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
freaks. - There, there, mistress.
scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack.
you must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione.
and this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you.
it's completely unfair. - Yeah.
there's a lot of that going round at the moment.
so, what is this place?
it's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix.
it's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who.
couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
we wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
only... - Only what?
only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
but why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. - If you're all done shouting...
do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?
if anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know voldemort was back.
he's not a child, Molly.
but he's not an adult either.
he's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son.
he's as good as.
who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny.
he's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black.
perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.
now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
snape's part of the Order? - Git.
about your supposed reformation.
I know better. - So why don't you tell him?
get off it. - Ouick.
get it up. - Crookshanks.
stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat.
Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up.
Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks.
well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
just because you're allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
you hungry, Harry?
you sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
this is very, very peculiar.
it seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?
show him. He'll find out soon enough.
he's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
he thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
no one in their right mind could believe that...
exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind.
it's been twisted and warped by fear.
now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry.
the last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear.
now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
we think Voldemort wants to build up his army again.
fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command.
and not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures.
he's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same.
but gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in.
we believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
something he didn't have last time.
you mean like a weapon?
no. That's enough. He's just a boy.
you say more and you might as well induct him into the Order.
good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
you are hereby expelledb before the entire Wizengamot..
trains. Underground.
ingenious, these Muggles.
here we are.
I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.
right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.
daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob.
interdepartmental memos.
we used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
they've changed the time of your hearing. - When is it?
in five minutes.
department of Mysteries.
and I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.
keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
as the Muggles say, truth will out.
yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
good luck, Harry.
disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
witness for the defense.
albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore.
you got our message that the time and place of the hearing...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it.
but by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
the charges?
the charges against the accused are as follows:
that he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle.
do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but...
and you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but...
witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
dementors?
in Little Whinging?
that's quite clever.
muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
highly convenient. - I'm not lying.
there were two of them, and if I hadn't... - Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event...
pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can.
please describe the attack.
what did they look like?
well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny.
not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness had gone from the world.
now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor.
dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic.
and it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.
that would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an attack without authorization.
of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
the evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.
he is not back.
in the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.
laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic?
those in favor of conviction?
those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
cleared of all charges.
professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
you'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
what's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
don't worry about me.
anyway, I wanted you to have this.
original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
she was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
they suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.
it's been 14 years.
and still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius?
it feels like it did before.
you keep it.
anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
hold my hand, lovey.
there they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free.
better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.
What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me!
it's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville.
what is it?
what's what? - That. Pulling the carriage.
nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
it's pulling itself, like always.
you're not going mad.
I can see them too.
you're just as sane as I am.
everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
what an interesting necklace.
it's a charm, actually.
keeps away the Nargles.
hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
what's a Nargle? - No idea.
good evening, children.
now, we have two changes in staffing this year.
we're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.
we also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
and I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.
now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you...
she was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome.
and how lovely to see all your bright...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.
that's likely. - That's likely.
the Ministry of Magic has always considered...
...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.
although each headmaster...
...has brought something new to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.
let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating.
Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean?
magic is forbidden in the corridors...
it means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
good holiday? - All right.
better than Seamus', anyway.
me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
why not? - Let me see. Because of you.
the Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.
what, your mum believes them?
nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother.
don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
what's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on.
do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
you all right? - Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
but he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron.
right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
good morning, children.
ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
more commonly known as OWLs.
study hard and you will be rewarded.
fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe.
your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven.
but you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...course of defensive magic. Yes?
there's nothing in here about using defensive spells?
using spells?
well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
we're not gonna use magic?
you'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way.
what use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.
students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.
it is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is what school is all about.
and how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
there is nothing out there, dear.
who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
now, let me make this quite plain.
you have been told...
...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again.
this is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
it was murder. Voldemort killed him.
enough!
enough.
see me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
come in.
good evening, Mr. Potter.
sit.
you're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
no, not with your quill.
going to be using a rather special one of mine.
now...
...I want you to write, "I must not tell lies."
how many times?
well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
you haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
yes?
nothing. - That's right.
because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
don't you, Mr. Potter?
go on.
skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill.
get out of class whenever you like.
obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom.
care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me. - Please.
I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.
and if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal.
what's wrong with your hand?
nothing.
the other hand.
you've got to tell Dumbledore. - No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.
bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
if the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
it's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
you don't understand.
then help us to.
dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
it's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way.
in spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit.
unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
what are they? - They're called Thestrals.
they're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit...
different.
but why can't the others see them?
they can only be seen by people who've seen death.
so you've known someone who's died, then?
my mum.
she was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong.
I was 9. - I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad.
we both believe you, by the way.
that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
but I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
what do you mean?
well, if I were You-Know-Who...
...l'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
can I join you?
pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.
so silly of me, but it sounds...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
but to question my practices is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.
disloyalty.
things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
what's happened to Dumbledore?
having already revolutionized...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.
just one question, dear.
you've been in this post how long, exactly?
you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
but you were unsuccessful?
obviously.
could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
move those mouths.
one teensy little prophecy?
pity.
no, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
you are in grave danger.
lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
it's Professor Trelawney.
sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
you can't do this.
actually, I can.
something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several things I would like to say.
there...
professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister...
you have the right to dismiss my teachers.
you do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds.
that power remains with the headmaster.
for now.
don't you all have studying to do?
professor.
professor?
professor Dumbledore. Professor!
professor Dumbledore.
that foul, evil, old gargoyle.
we're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
she's taking over the entire school.
security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
what are you doing here? - Answering your letter.
you said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing?
training you to kill half-breeds?
she's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised.
the latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
combat?
what does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?
that's exactly what he thinks.
that Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.
he's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
the others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going at all well with the Order.
fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
well, what can we do?
someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
but for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own.
he really is out there, isn't he?
we've got to be able to defend ourselves.
and if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
this is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face.
Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate.
who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
just a couple of people.
lovely spot.
thought it would be safer off the beaten track.
matey, come back here.
Hi.
so you all know why we're here.
we need a teacher.
a proper teacher.
one who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
Why? - Why?
because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.
so he says. - So Dumbledore says.
so Dumbledore says because he says.
the point is, where's the proof?
if Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now.
come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak.
is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that.
and he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.
it's true.
third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once.
last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
wait.
look, it all sounds great when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help.
he's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not.
facing this stuff in real life is not like school.
in school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow.
but out there...
...when you're a second away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die right before your eyes...
you don't know what that's like.
you're right, Harry, we don't.
that's why we need your help.
because if we're going to have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
he's really back.
right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out.
the Shrieking Shack. - It's too small.
forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?
who are you and what have you done with Hermione?
anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today.
what's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
right. Over the next few days, we should each come up...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
we've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
will do, Harry.
all student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
watch where you're going, Longbottom.
you've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
the what?
it's also known as the Come and Go Room.
the Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.
and it's always equipped for the seeker's needs.
so say you really needed the toilet...
charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea.
it's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
you're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
you will please copy the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
there will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it.
Expelliarmus. - Wands away.
stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
it's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
so come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron.
you can do it. - Come on, Ron.
one Sickle. - You're on.
Stupefy.
thank you. - Shut up.
I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
it was completely intentional.
up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
very good. Keep your concentration.
great.
a little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
diminuendo.
working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more:
believing in yourself.
Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it.
think of it this way.
every great wizard in history has started out...
...as nothing more than what we are now: Students.
if they can do it, why not us?
Stupefy. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
so that's it for this lesson.
now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
so just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
and well done, everyone. Great, great work.
well done, mate.
Thanks.
see you after Christmas.
see you in the Common Room, Harry.
thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries.
thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas.
thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas.
have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking.
we could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils...
sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
anyway, it's worth it.
it's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
he was really good.
it's just, Voldemort was better.
you're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
mistletoe.
probably full of Nargles, though.
what are Nargles?
no idea.
well, how was it?
wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
that bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
you'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
don't you understand how she must be feeling?
well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything.
one person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.
just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
in the dream, were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
neither. It was like I...
will you please just tell me what's happening?
everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
make sure he's found by the right people.
sir. - Phineas.
you must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.
tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.
they've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.
what's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
look at me!
what's happening to me?
you wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.
otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
it appears there's a connection...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.
pray he remains ignorant.
you mean, if he knows about it, then...
...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
in the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed to torture them into madness.
only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you from access or influence.
in these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.
you will attempt to resist.
prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
concentrate, Potter. Focus.
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
here we go.
daddy's back.
sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
and a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
I want to see your faces. - Yes.
try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
there you are.
happy Christmas. - Thank you.
lovely to have you with us. - Thank you.
now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
thank you. - Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
Hermione. - A Christmas toast.
to Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
Harry. - Harry.
Harry.
that is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
no more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
if my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher!
that's enough of your bile. Away with you!
of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
sorry about that.
he never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not to me, anyway.
what, you grew up here?
this is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
about the only useful thing I've been able to do.
this is the Black family tree.
my deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
my parents with their pure-blood mania.
my mother did that after I ran away.
charming woman.
I was 16.
where did you go?
round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
you are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
when I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
and afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
this connection between me and Voldemort.
what if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
and what if, after everything that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.
you're not a bad person.
you're a very good person who bad things have happened to.
you understand?
besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.
we've all got both light and dark inside of us.
what matters is the part we choose to act on.
that's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
when all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
you'll see.
come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
if I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
in fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
this is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
giants?
you found them?
well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
but I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
death Eaters? - Yes.
trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who.
did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message.
suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
and they did this to you?
not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
it's changing out there.
just like last time.
there's a storm coming, Harry.
we'd all best be ready when she does.
we have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
and of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
we strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
he's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
so, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
she tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
but I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
we're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
a full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
wow, that was really good.
fantastic, Ginny.
just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
so focus, Luna.
think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
I'm trying. - I know. It's good.
this is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
get them.
been watching them for weeks.
and see, "Dumbledore's Army..."
...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.
all your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
we saw your lies for what they were:
a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
naturally.
no, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
if we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.
dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to...
what was the phrase?
come quietly.
well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
enough of this.
take him.
well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse.
anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.
and the more you care, the more you have to lose.
so maybe it's just better to... - To what?
to go it alone.
Hagrid.
any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
and they're dangerous at the best of times.
the Ministry restricts their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...l'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
and I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
because he's my brother.
blimey.
well, half brother, really.
he's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something.
we talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
that's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
put me down.
now.
you all right?
fine.
just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
you just stay away from her, all right?
he gets his own food and all.
it's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
you will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
feeling sentimental?
that's private. - Not to me.
and not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve.
every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.
you won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.
you're just like your father.
lazy, arrogant.
don't say a word against my father. - Weak.
I'm not weak. - Then prove it.
control your emotions.
discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
stop it.
is this what you call control?
we've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.
the Dark Lord isn't resting.
you and Black, you're two of a kind.
sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.
your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it.
my father was a great man. - Your father was a swine.
Legilimens. - Protego.
come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
nice one, James.
dad. - Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
enough.
enough.
your lessons are at an end.
I...
get out.
what's your name? - Michael.
your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
it's fading already.
you can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
as I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
you know, George...
...l've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
all right, professor!
here you go.
ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
you'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
it's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
what if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
what if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
what if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
what do we do?
we'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not all of them.
Alohomora.
alert the Order if you can.
are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous.
when are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.
that you are.
caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
you were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
no. - Liar.
you sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes.
the time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not.
have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students.
the last of it on Miss Chang.
unless you wish to poison him...
and I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.
I cannot help you.
he's got Padfoot.
he's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden?
what is he talking about, Snape?
no idea.
very well.
you give me no choice, Potter.
as this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
the Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
that's illegal.
what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
tell her, Harry!
tell me what?
well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
how much further?
not far.
it had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
what are you doing?
Lmprovising.
well?
where is this weapon?
there isn't one, is there?
you were trying to trick me.
you know...
...I really hate children.
you have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
how dare you?
filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
please. Please stop it. Please.
now, enough. I will have order.
you filthy animal.
do you know who I am?
leave him alone. It's not his fault.
no, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
but I must not tell lies.
what are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge.
let me go!
thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
how'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
that was clever, Ron.
has been known to happen. - It was brilliant.
so how are we getting to London?
look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.
or was that all just words to you?
maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
so how are we going to get to London?
we fly, of course.
department of Mysteries.
this is it.
he should be here. - Harry.
it's got your name on it.
the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
for neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
you know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
you saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.
now, hand me the prophecy.
if you do anything to us, I'll break it.
he knows how to play.
itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
better, now they're about to be avenged.
now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
all we want is that prophecy.
why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
you dare speak his name?
you filthy half-blood!
it's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.
which is lucky for you, really.
haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?
why he was unable to kill you...when you were just an infant?
don't you want to know the secret of your scar?
all the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.
all you have to do...
...is give it to me.
then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
get back to the door.
department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
the voices.
can you tell what they're saying?
there aren't any voices, Harry.
let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
please, Harry.
get behind me.
did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
don't give it to him, Harry.
get away from my godson.
now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
what? No, I'm staying with you.
you've done beautifully.
now, let me take it from here.
black.
Expelliarmus!
nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
no. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
you coming to get me? - Crucio.
you've got to mean it, Harry.
she killed him. She deserves it.
you know the spell, Harry.
do it.
so weak.
it was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.
the Aurors are on their way.
by which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
you've lost, old man.
Harry.
so weak.
so vulnerable.
look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
it's how you are not.
Harry?
you're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
and I feel sorry for you.
you're a fool, Harry Potter.
and you will lose everything.
he's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
no, you don't.
it's my fault.
no, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...before Voldemort made the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year...he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.
the prophecy said:
neither one can live while the other one survives.
it means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
why didn't you tell me?
for the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
the same reason your friends saved you.
after all these years, after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
how come you're not at the feast?
lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
that's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
but as it's the last night, I really do need them back.
do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
are you sure you don't want any help looking?
that's all right.
anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
if not always in the way we expect.
think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
what's that?
that even though we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
yeah?
something worth fighting for.
right. Over the next few days, we should each come up...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
we've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
will do, Harry.
all student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
watch where you're going, Longbottom.
you've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
the what?
it's also known as the Come and Go Room.
the Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.
and it's always equipped for the seeker's needs.
so say you really needed the toilet...
charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea.
it's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
you're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
you will please copy the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
there will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it.
Expelliarmus. - Wands away.
stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
it's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
so come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron.
you can do it. - Come on, Ron.
one Sickle. - You're on.
Stupefy.
thank you. - Shut up.
I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
it was completely intentional.
up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
very good. Keep your concentration.
great.
a little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
diminuendo.
working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more:
believing in yourself.
Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it.
think of it this way.
every great wizard in history has started out...
...as nothing more than what we are now: Students.
if they can do it, why not us?
Stupefy. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
so that's it for this lesson.
now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
so just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
and well done, everyone. Great, great work.
well done, mate.
Thanks.
see you after Christmas.
see you in the Common Room, Harry.
thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries.
thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas.
thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas.
have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking.
we could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils...
sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
anyway, it's worth it.
it's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
he was really good.
it's just, Voldemort was better.
you're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
mistletoe.
probably full of Nargles, though.
what are Nargles?
no idea.
well, how was it?
wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
that bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
you'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
don't you understand how she must be feeling?
well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything.
one person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.
just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
in the dream, were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
neither. It was like I...
will you please just tell me what's happening?
everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
make sure he's found by the right people.
sir. - Phineas.
you must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.
tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.
they've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.
what's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
look at me!
what's happening to me?
you wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.
otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
it appears there's a connection...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.
pray he remains ignorant.
you mean, if he knows about it, then...
...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
in the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed to torture them into madness.
only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you from access or influence.
in these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.
you will attempt to resist.
prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
concentrate, Potter. Focus.
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
here we go.
daddy's back.
sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
and a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
I want to see your faces. - Yes.
try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
there you are.
happy Christmas. - Thank you.
lovely to have you with us. - Thank you.
now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
thank you. - Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
Hermione. - A Christmas toast.
to Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
Harry. - Harry.
Harry.
that is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
no more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
if my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher!
that's enough of your bile. Away with you!
of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
sorry about that.
he never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not to me, anyway.
what, you grew up here?
this is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
about the only useful thing I've been able to do.
this is the Black family tree.
my deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
my parents with their pure-blood mania.
my mother did that after I ran away.
charming woman.
I was 16.
where did you go?
round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
you are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
when I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
and afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
this connection between me and Voldemort.
what if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
and what if, after everything that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.
you're not a bad person.
you're a very good person who bad things have happened to.
you understand?
besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.
we've all got both light and dark inside of us.
what matters is the part we choose to act on.
that's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
when all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
you'll see.
come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
if I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
in fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
this is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
giants?
you found them?
well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
but I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
death Eaters? - Yes.
trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who.
did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message.
suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
and they did this to you?
not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
it's changing out there.
just like last time.
there's a storm coming, Harry.
we'd all best be ready when she does.
we have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
and of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
we strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
he's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
so, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
she tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
but I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
we're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
a full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
wow, that was really good.
fantastic, Ginny.
just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
so focus, Luna.
think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
I'm trying. - I know. It's good.
this is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
get them.
been watching them for weeks.
and see, "Dumbledore's Army..."
...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.
all your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
we saw your lies for what they were:
a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
naturally.
no, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
if we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.
dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to...
what was the phrase?
come quietly.
well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
enough of this.
take him.
well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse.
anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.
and the more you care, the more you have to lose.
so maybe it's just better to... - To what?
to go it alone.
Hagrid.
any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
and they're dangerous at the best of times.
the Ministry restricts their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...l'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
and I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
because he's my brother.
blimey.
well, half brother, really.
he's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something.
we talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
that's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
put me down.
now.
you all right?
fine.
just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
you just stay away from her, all right?
he gets his own food and all.
it's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
you will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
feeling sentimental?
that's private. - Not to me.
and not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve.
every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.
you won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.
you're just like your father.
lazy, arrogant.
don't say a word against my father. - Weak.
I'm not weak. - Then prove it.
control your emotions.
discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
stop it.
is this what you call control?
we've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.
the Dark Lord isn't resting.
you and Black, you're two of a kind.
sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.
your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it.
my father was a great man. - Your father was a swine.
Legilimens. - Protego.
come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
nice one, James.
dad. - Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
enough.
enough.
your lessons are at an end.
I...
get out.
what's your name? - Michael.
your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
it's fading already.
you can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
as I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
you know, George...
...l've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
all right, professor!
here you go.
ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
you'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
it's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
what if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
what if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
what if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
what do we do?
we'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not all of them.
Alohomora.
alert the Order if you can.
are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous.
when are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.
that you are.
caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
you were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
no. - Liar.
you sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes.
the time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not.
have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students.
the last of it on Miss Chang.
unless you wish to poison him...
and I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.
I cannot help you.
he's got Padfoot.
he's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden?
what is he talking about, Snape?
no idea.
very well.
you give me no choice, Potter.
as this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
the Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
that's illegal.
what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
tell her, Harry!
tell me what?
well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
how much further?
not far.
it had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
what are you doing?
Lmprovising.
well?
where is this weapon?
there isn't one, is there?
you were trying to trick me.
you know...
...I really hate children.
you have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
how dare you?
filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
please. Please stop it. Please.
now, enough. I will have order.
you filthy animal.
do you know who I am?
leave him alone. It's not his fault.
no, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
but I must not tell lies.
what are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge.
let me go!
thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
how'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
that was clever, Ron.
has been known to happen. - It was brilliant.
so how are we getting to London?
look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.
or was that all just words to you?
maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
so how are we going to get to London?
we fly, of course.
department of Mysteries.
this is it.
he should be here. - Harry.
it's got your name on it.
the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
for neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
you know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
you saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.
now, hand me the prophecy.
if you do anything to us, I'll break it.
he knows how to play.
itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
better, now they're about to be avenged.
now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
all we want is that prophecy.
why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
you dare speak his name?
you filthy half-blood!
it's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.
which is lucky for you, really.
haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?
why he was unable to kill you...when you were just an infant?
don't you want to know the secret of your scar?
all the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.
all you have to do...
...is give it to me.
then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
get back to the door.
department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
the voices.
can you tell what they're saying?
there aren't any voices, Harry.
let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
please, Harry.
get behind me.
did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
don't give it to him, Harry.
get away from my godson.
now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
what? No, I'm staying with you.
you've done beautifully.
now, let me take it from here.
black.
Expelliarmus!
nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
no. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
you coming to get me? - Crucio.
you've got to mean it, Harry.
she killed him. She deserves it.
you know the spell, Harry.
do it.
so weak.
it was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.
the Aurors are on their way.
by which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
you've lost, old man.
Harry.
so weak.
so vulnerable.
look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
it's how you are not.
Harry?
you're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
and I feel sorry for you.
you're a fool, Harry Potter.
and you will lose everything.
he's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
no, you don't.
it's my fault.
no, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...before Voldemort made the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year...he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.
the prophecy said:
neither one can live while the other one survives.
it means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
why didn't you tell me?
for the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
the same reason your friends saved you.
after all these years, after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
how come you're not at the feast?
lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
that's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
but as it's the last night, I really do need them back.
do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
are you sure you don't want any help looking?
that's all right.
anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
if not always in the way we expect.
think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
what's that?
that even though we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
yeah?
something worth fighting for.
there was not a horse or beast he could not master.
so much so that in his youth, he took to riding a camel, which was comical.
when he passed, the carriage came to me.
she's got the stone!
she's got it! - She's got it!
and it's the largest in all of Stormhold, so they say.
how nice for you. If you'll excuse me.
wait.
that stone you're wearing. It can't be.
Oh, finally. - Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.
well done. - Sweet.
come here. Let me see it.
you have no idea what you're meddling with.
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold and I demand that you bring it to me!
bring me the stone! Now!
prince Primus! Don't touch anything they give you! They tried to...
are you all right? - Billy!
get him!
the burning golden heart of a star at peace is so much better than your frightened little heart.
even so, better than no heart at all.
Yvaine? Hold me tight and think of home.
No!
what the hell did you do? - What did I do? What did you do?
think of home!" That was a great plan!
you thought of your home and I thought of mine and now we're halfway between the two!
Oh, you stupid cow! What did you think of your home for?
you just said "home"!
if you wanted me to think of your home, you should have said!
some crazy lady was going to cut your heart out and you wanted more specific instructions?
perhaps you'd like it in writing! Or a diagram, maybe!
look, Captain Shakespeare! Caught ourselves a little bonus!
a couple of Lightning Marshals!
they don't look like Lightning Marshals to me.
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
well, let's think.
maybe for the same godforsaken reason we are!
now, who are you?
let's see if a night on our lovely brig will loosen their lips!
get them in the brig! - You heard the man! Let's go!
get them into the brig and the rest of you dirty dogs, back to work!
we've got lightning to catch! Come on!
they're going to kill us, aren't they? - I don't know.
you know, it's funny. I used to watch...
I used to watch people having adventures.
I envied them.
you ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?
what? So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?
no. No, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.
look, I admire you dreaming.
shop boy like me, I could never have imagined an adventure this big in order to have wished for it.
I just thought I'd find some lump of celestial rock and take it home, and that would be it.
and you got me.
if there's one thing I've learned in all my years watching Earth, it's that people aren't what they may seem.
there are shop boys and there are boys who just happen to work in shops for the time being.
and trust me, Tristan, you're no shop boy.
you saved my life. Thank you.
well, well, well.
the last brother dead.
which means that I'm king.
I'm king!
not yet, brother.
damn. I still need the stone.
your brother doesn't have it? - Well, why don't you find out?
where is my stone?
I don't...
the man, see, your brother... I heard him speak of a stone.
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.
what girl? - I don't know.
a girl. She got away. Because this was a trap set up for her, but your brother, he come just straight into it.
a trap? Set by who?
a woman you should pray you'll never meet.
she's...
she's gone. She took your brother's carriage.
this woman wanted my stone?
no. She wanted the girl's heart.
she said the girl was a star and she wanted to cut out her heart and...
eat it?
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea what this means?
everlasting life.
king forever.
it's not here, sire.
this idiot's coming with us.
ask again. - We have asked again and the answer is still the same. She is airborne!
well, she can't remain so forever.
inform me as soon as she touches ground!
immediately! Do you understand?
watch your tongue, sister! It is you and not we who've lost her.
lost her and broken the knife!
even if you apprehend her, how will you complete the deed?
perhaps you should return now and one of us set out in your place.
don't be absurd.
I'll bring her home and deal with her there.
be sure everything is ready for our arrival.
tell me about Victoria then.
well, she...
there's nothing more to tell you.
because the little I know about love is that it's unconditional.
it's not something you can buy.
hang on. This wasn't about me buying her love.
this was a way for me to prove how I felt.
and what's she doing to prove how she feels about you?
well...
look, Yvaine, you'll understand when you meet her. All right?
provided we don't get murdered by pirates first.
murdered by pirates. Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.
I can't quite decide which sounds more fun.
we've located the sky vessel.
it's headed north for the port town on Mount Drummond and you are no longer the only one seeking the star.
there's someone following your tracks!
a witch? A warlock?
a prince and he's catching you up! Get a move on!
so, this is the part where you tell me who you are and why you're up here.
or I'll snap her pretty little fingers one by one like dry twigs!
my name is Tristan Thorn.
this is my wife, Yvaine. - Your wife?
far too young and radiant to belong to just one man!
it's share and share alike aboard my vessel, sonny boy!
if you dare even touch her...
you may think you're showing a little spirit in front of your lady friend, but if you talk back to me again, I'll feed your tongue to the dogs, you impertinent little pup!
sir? - Better! But still interrupting.
let's see. A hanging's always good for morale!
maybe we'll watch you dance a gallows jig!
or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side and have done with it!
it's a very long way down.
plenty of time to reminisce about your pitifully short lives.
please, look, we're just trying to make our way home, back to a place called Wall, where I come from.
what did you say?
I said we were trying to get home to Wall.
that's one lie too many, my son.
wall? - Shut up.
what's he saying?
thought you could just wander onto my patch, did you?
he is. Yeah, he's gonna... - And live to tell the tale?
all right, go, on the deck, on the deck, on the deck! Now, go, go, go!
big mistake, Mr. Thorn! And the last one you'll ever make!
No! No! You brute! - Come... Come on!
you murderer! You pig! - Come on! Get up! Get up!
I'm taking the girl to my cabin, and mark my words, anyone who disturbs me for the next few hours - will get the same treatment! - What? You'll...
no, you idiot! I'll sling you over the side as well!
Oh, yeah.
captain's busy. So should you be.
get in there, wench!
so, that went well, I thought.
now, tell me news of my beloved England.
I want to hear absolutely everything.
hang on. I can't believe your crew fell for that.
and where in God's name did you get that mannequin from?
Oh, it works every time.
an ounce of bargaining, a pinch of trickery, a soupcon of intimidation!
the perfect recipe for a towering reputation without ever having to spill one drop of blood.
ever try to get blood stains out of a silk shirt? Nightmare.
right. I still don't understand how they won't recognize me.
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done, your own mother won't recognize you.
now, we've no time to waste.
we have only two hours before we make port.
first and foremost...
it'll be so good to see you out of those dreary clothes.
so very small-town errand-boy. Howlingly parochial.
here. Dress you.
I wore it as a younger man. I hate to throw anything away.
you know the day you do, it'll come back in fashion.
now, you, darling.
I have some lovely dresses. Take your pick.
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.
honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.
now, England, England. I want to hear everything.
you're not from England. - Oh, no, sadly, no.
but from my earliest youth, I lapped up the stories.
people always told me they were nothing more than folklore, but my heart told me they were true.
as a boy, I'd scurry away from my father at the market while he did his deals just to peek over the wall, dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day, seeing England for myself.
Really? So you... You were here looking over there.
Oh, yes.
hair. - Hair?
mind you, I did my best to fit in.
tried to make my father, Captain Ghostmaker, proud.
forged a decent reputation as a ruthless marauder and cold-blooded killer.
but my father died.
I always promised him I'd take over the family business, keep the old girl flying.
you have no idea the lightness it brings to my heart being able to confide in you charming young people.
the pressure of maintaining the whole Captain Shakespeare persona for the sake of the crew, I don't know.
sometimes...
you see, I'm very much a man of my own creation.
even chose the name specially. Took me ages.
see, I'm thinking legendary British wordsmith.
my enemies and crew are thinking, "Shake! Spear!
it's little things like that make me happy.
I don't understand that.
surely it would make you happier just to be yourself.
why fight to be accepted by people you don't actually want to be like?
Yeah. Why would anyone do that to himself?
exactly.
port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!
hurry up.
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh. I'll be honest.
shall I give you a little taste, young Ferdinand?
no, no. Oh, there you go.
brilliant. Like they're cheap.
I think it's still crackling, very much alive, still tres fresh.
so, name your best price. - For 10, 000 bolts?
ten thousand bolts of finest quality grade A.
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift, isn't it? Difficult to store.
if I get the Revenue Men in here sniffing round, what's the...
best price, 150 guineas.
gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.
whoa, whoa, whoa. - Ferdinand, always a pleasure.
hold on. Hold on. One minute. Hold on, cuddles.
Oh, he's... - One-sixty. One-sixty.
seeing as I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll settle for 200.
two hundred? Okay. You're having a laugh.
have you had your head in that?
has he been sailing up where the air's too thin?
you're being very rude. - Not anymore.
two hundred. - One-eighty.
two hundred. - That's not negotiation.
I'm changing my number. One-eight-five.
did I hear 200? - From you, you did. Yeah.
you said 200. - Lf I did, you're a ventriloquist.
okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.
One-nine-five it is. So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.
brilliant. Put it in the back.
unbelievable. Here.
yes? Can I help you?
nosy.
have you heard any of these rumors going round about a fallen star?
everyone's talking about it.
you get your hands on one of them, we can shut up shop. Retire.
fallen star? - Yeah.
nothing on your travels? - No.
not even a little sniff of a whisper?
everyone's going on about it down at the market.
which market? The market near the wall?
Yeah.
well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time listening to gossip from the kind of pond scum trading down there.
well, if it... - Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?
Oh, what a wonderful woman you are, Sal.
how the world wouldn't be the same place without you.
you look great. You've had your feet done, haven't you?
but, you two, you have business to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.
come on. I've got something new for you.
captain Shakespeare.
stand down!
meet my nephew, the fearsome buccaneer,
Tristan Thorn.
he'll be joining us for our journey home.
I have the perfect gift to keep you amused on the way.
Oh...
right, you lazy dogs!
let's get young Tristan on his way home!
Touche.
I'm impressed.
Yvaine, I know what you are.
no, no. Have no fear.
no one on this vessel will harm you, but there are plenty who would.
your emotions give you away, Yvaine. You must learn to control them.
you've been glowing more brightly every day, and I think you know why.
of course I know why I'm glowing. I'm a star.
and what do stars do best? - Well, it's certainly not the waltz.
now try. - Okay.
see? - Very good.
due west, you say?
and you're certain he had a girl with him?
Yeah.
you're sure? Absolutely sure? Sure you're not lying?
I'd cross my heart if I had one.
brilliant. - You'd better be telling the truth, you two-faced dog.
I can get you one of them, actually. Very good guard dogs.
they can watch the back and the front door at the same time.
I can get you anything you want.
what are the chances of getting a Babylon candle?
that one's slim.
although, I did know a girl once, if you know what I mean...
I'm a ladies' man.
...who had a sister...
I think it was a woman.
Oh, she was terrible. Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.
enough.
hold on tight! The Captain's at the helm!
so there's the road you'll need for Wall.
good luck on your journey home, Yvaine, wherever that may be.
and good luck to you, Tristan, with your Victoria.
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough for your kindness?
don't mention it. No, seriously, don't mention it.
reputations, you know. A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...
just think about it.
well, give my regards to England. It's been a pleasure to meet you both.
mind you don't wear that wench out, Captain Tristan!
what did he say to you?
what did he say when?
just then. When he whispered to you.
no... No, he... He was just saying we should use the lightning to get you a Babylon candle.
barter for it, you know.
for the last time, where is the girl?
the girl with the stone! Where did she go?
are you mocking me? - No...
cause if you are, believe me, you have seconds to live!
what a freak.
clean this thoroughly.
bollocks.
if you have quite finished squandering your magic on your rather counterproductive beauty routine, you might like to know that the star has returned.
she's back on land.
I know, damn it. I couldn't reach the lake in time.
no matter. We have found her. She is on the road to the village of Wall.
if you take the shortcut across the marshes, you should arrive in time to intercept her.
Yvaine.
are you trying to break my leg again? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just... I can't risk people seeing you. I don't trust anyone.
but at this rate, if we keep stopping...
Yvaine. We're making good time. Just leave it a minute.
aren't you tempted?
tempted? By what?
Lmmortality.
let's say it wasn't my heart.
not me. Just a star you didn't know.
you seriously think I could kill anyone?
I mean, even if I could... Everlasting life?
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.
well, maybe if you had someone to share it with.
someone you love.
maybe then it might be different.
come on, I think we're safe.
now remember, Captain Shakespeare has a fearsome reputation.
what the hell is this? - What are you doing here?
my name is Prince Septimus.
and you're going to tell me where I can find the girl.
all right, twinkletoes. I'm gonna count to three. One, two...
you know, you sort of glitter sometimes. I just noticed it. Is it normal?
let's see if you can work it out for yourself.
what do stars do?
attract trouble?
that's... All right, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry.
all right, let me... Let me... Do I get another guess?
is it... Do they know exactly how to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?
how long will that take? - Maybe two days.
but we don't have two days. Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.
Yes, it is. Well remembered.
nice cup of Earl Grey. - Get out, everybody. Get out.
did he hurt you, Captain?
did you tell him where your nephew and the girl went?
so what's the problem?
it's my reputation.
no. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.
it's all right, Captain.
we always knew you were a whoopsie.
you'll always be our captain, Captain. - Aye, aye, Captain.
captain.
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.
prince Septimus, your men, they're dead.
Oh, really?
go on!
I met that woman. She's friends with the Captain.
he said she trades at the market near Wall.
we could hitch a lift. - Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?
you sure? - Yes, yes.
wait! Sorry! My name is Tristan Thorn. This...
that's my flower.
eighteen years I've been looking for that.
give it to me now!
how dare you? That was a gift from his mother!
Oh.
perhaps I was mistaken.
it's all right.
it's obviously very valuable to you, so you can have it in exchange for what I need.
a Babylon candle? - And safe passage to the wall.
a Babylon candle?
Oh, no, no, no. I don't deal in black magic.
Really?
well, can you give us a lift then? To the wall?
well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
for that flower, I can offer you passage.
food and lodging on the way? - Safe passage.
I swear that you will arrive at the wall in the exact same condition that you're in now.
do you have any idea what manner of thing it was that you had?
some kind of lucky charm?
a very lucky charm indeed. Protection.
in fact, the exact same thing that would've prevented me from doing this.
Oh, my God! What did you do? - Much better.
you shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.
though I'll keep me word. You shall not be harmed.
there. Food and lodging just as I promised.
would I be correct in thinking that you can neither see nor hear me?
then I'd like to tell you that you smell of pee.
you look like the wrong end of a dog.
and I swear, if I don't get my Tristan back as he was, I'll be your personal poltergeist!
Tristan?
if you can understand me, look at me now.
you know when I said I knew little about love?
well, that wasn't true.
I know a lot about love.
I've seen it. I've seen centuries and centuries of it.
and it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable.
all those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.
made me want to turn away and never look down again.
but to see the way that mankind loves.
I mean, you could search the furthest reaches of the universe and never find anything more beautiful.
so, yes, I know that love is unconditional.
but I also know it can be unpredictable, unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable and, well, strangely easy to mistake for loathing.
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is I think I love you.
my heart, it feels like my chest can barely contain it.
like it doesn't belong to me anymore. It belongs to you.
and if you wanted it, I'd wish for nothing in exchange.
no gifts, no goods, no demonstrations of devotion.
nothing but knowing you love me, too.
just your heart in exchange for mine.
the wall is one mile that way.
there. Though the walk might take you a little longer than normal.
transformation tends to leave the brain a bit scrambled for a while.
you...
Oh!
I warned you. Save your strength.
I've been so worried about you.
Victoria.
I think I preferred Mother.
come on. There's an inn over there. Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.
I think you need a bath and a good night's sleep before you present me to her.
come on. Come.
come on, Tristan. It's not that far. - Okay.
excuse me? - Oh!
I think you're in my bath. - Well, close your eyes!
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking. Here, I'll turn away.
all right, you can open them now.
did you really mean what you said in the caravan?
what I...
but... But you were a mouse!
you were a mouse! You wanted cheese! You didn't...
I asked you to give me a sign.
and risk you being too embarrassed to keep saying such lovely things?
you want to know what the Captain really whispered to me that day?
he told me that my true love was right in front of my eyes.
and he was right.
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on, you got to come up and see this!
no, thank you.
pervert! - Suit yourself.
ironic, isn't it? - Yeah. What is?
Septimus will be here by the morning, find the girl, get the stone and be king forever.
so unjust.
still, at least we will be free.
you're very close. She's in the market town.
one mile from the gap in the wall.
you speak as if this is good news.
do I need to remind you that Wall is not part of our universe?
if she crosses the threshold into the human realm, our star becomes nothing more than a pitted lump of metallic rock.
then I suggest you hurry up!
what?
Oh, what do you want?
sorry. Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?
ask me again at a more reasonable hour.
no, I can't. I have to go.
look, if my friend wakes up before I get back, - please, can you give her a message? - Go on.
you know, that's the first time I've ever slept at night.
I can't believe it.
Tristan?
have you seen my friend?
he left absurdly early.
he left?
he told me to tell you he's gone to see Victoria because he's sorry, but he's found his true love and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.
what?
are you sure? - I'm positive.
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!
happy birthday.
Tristan.
what happened to you?
I found the star.
I can't believe you did it.
Where's my star? Can I see it?
is it beautiful? - Yes.
well, it's awfully small.
well, that's just a little piece. A token for your birthday.
well... Well, then forget about the star.
it's not the star that I want.
you know what I want.
Yeah. I do.
you want to grow up and get over yourself.
Humphrey. - Thorn.
you must have a death wish.
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.
she's all yours.
you really are a perfect couple. The best of luck to you both.
well, why would I want this? It's just a measly handful of stardust!
Yvaine?
she can't cross the wall.
go on!
stop! Stop! If you go through there, you'll die!
what?
if you set foot on human soil, you'll turn to rock.
wretched slattern! Where have you taken me?
planning to enter Wall, were you?
if death is what you wish, my dear, I'd be more than happy to assist you.
are you talking to me?
you. Small world.
anyhow, no, I wasn't. I was talking to the star.
what star?
my slave girl's no star. Any fool can see that.
if she was, I'd have had the heart out of her chest a long time ago, trust me.
trust you? Not a mistake I'd be likely to make again.
what's it to be, Ditchwater Sal? Heads or tails?
Oh, God. Time to go. - She's not going anywhere.
I think you'll find she is.
it's all right. You can come, too.
you can ride in the carriage or be dragged behind it. Your choice.
what happened?
be my guest. I quit.
eighty years I've stopped you people going out.
what I should have been worrying about was those people from the other side coming in.
all right, just tell me what happened!
what happened? Oh, where to start?
No!
come on!
go on!
the star!
and who else?
a slave for us. It will be nice to have someone to help mop up when we've finished with our little guest.
Oh, good work, sister.
and just in time, I see! You look awful!
who are you?
what business do you have here?
Septimus?
I knew your brother, Primus.
unless you wish to meet him in the afterlife, I suggest you answer my question. What are you doing here?
I might ask you the same thing.
there are four of them.
do as I say and we may stand a chance.
wait. How do I know you can be trusted?
you don't. Why? Do you have a choice?
no. - Well, then, let's go.
get off me! Get off!
una? - Septimus.
Una! - Sister!
Tristan! No! Tristan!
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.
I'm your mother.
rather well. - Good riddance to you. Yes.
Oh!
let's put out those flames.
shall we?
so, what happens now?
we have to learn to live with each other.
forever?
let's get on with it.
be the man that I know you are.
get outside. - Okay.
go.
Tristan! - Get him.
get off!
get out!
so, what's it to be, Prince Charming? Frog or tadpole?
Septimus?
Tristan!
youth.
beauty.
it all seems meaningless now.
my sisters are dead!
everything I cared about gone.
go.
go!
No!
I owe you thanks, boy.
what use was her heart to me when it was broken?
and you got rid of my sisters and now I can have it all for myself.
hold me tight and close your eyes. - What? Why?
what do stars do?
shine.
Bravo! - Yeah!
very good.
why didn't you do that earlier?
I couldn't have done that without you. No star can shine with a broken heart.
I thought I'd lost you.
but you came back.
of course I did. I love you.
come on.
Tristan.
the last surviving male heir of the Stormhold bloodline.
it's you, Tristan.
but if he's the new King of Stormhold, then...
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.
Yeah!
my gift to you.
to you both.
thank you.
they ruled for 80 years.
but no man can live forever, except he who possesses the heart of a star.
and Yvaine had given hers to Tristan completely.
when their children and grandchildren were grown, it was time to light the Babylon candle.
and they still live happily ever after.
what is it that makes a man a man?
is it his origins, the way things start?
or is it something else, something harder to describe?
for me, it all began in 1944.

the Nazis were desperate.

...they intended to upset the balance of the war.
I was 28, already a paranormal advisor to President Roosevelt.
I could never have suspected that what would transpire that night...
...would not only affect the course of history...
...but change my life forever.
all right, men, let's go. Move!
come on! Come on! Come on!
let's fan it out.
your men...
...they'll need these.
are you a Catholic?
Yes. Among other things. But that's hardly the point.
well, you're gonna need one of these.
l abhor the use of violence.
thank you. l wouldn't want you to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.
no, three days too late for that, Professor Broom.
all right, you guys, let's move, move, move, move!
come on boys, let's go!
this way! Left, right!
come on, men, let's get the lead out!
we're close!
you're wasting our time. There's nothing here but sheep and rocks.

nobody's business. -lt is. You got yourself on TV again.

Hey, hey, hey.
warning. Code red.
they're playing our song.
come on, champ, let's go fight some monsters.
we're here at the Machen Library...
...where just hours ago, an alarm was triggered.
the N. Y.P. D. has yet to issue a statement.
we've got SWAT vans, paramedics. You name it.
and now here comes a garbage truck.
a large garbage truck.

nothing psychic about it.
you're easy.
how am l gonna get a girl? l drive around in a garbage truck.
Liz left us, Red.
take the hint.
we don't take hints.
civilians in bedroom.
okay, guys, let's sync up our locators.
seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming in.
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.
a large entity, type 5, reported. Very aggressive.
six guards dead.
l thought we checked this place.
fakes and reproductions.
apparently, not everything was fake.
father.
the entity is still in there.
video surveillance shows a 1 6th-century statue was destroyed.
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.
who wards off demons. -Exactly.
the statue, however, was hollow.
a reliquary.
a prison.
the Vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough...
...to include it on The List of Avignon, of which, by the way, we hold a copy.
perfect job for these babies.
made them myself.
holy water, clove leaf, silver shavings, white oak. The works.
behind this door, a dark entity.
evil, ancient and hungry.
Oh, well. Let me go in and say hi.
you better hit the books, Brother Blue.
we'll definitely need more info on this one.
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.
no. He likes it that way.
the whole " lonely hero " thing.
Hey, Stinky.
kitchen's closed.
what you having?
six library guards, raw, plus belts and boots.
man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out.
red, I found something.
this entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one.
son of Nergal, brother of
listen, Sammy...
...l'm not a very good shot, but The Samaritan here uses really big bullets.
so, what do you say we work this out in a nice, peaceful...
Oh, crap.
that's it for you, Sam.
red, you need to hear the rest of the information.
no, he's taken care of.
no, listen to this.
"Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows...
...son of Nergal, hound of resurrection... "
see...
...l don't like that.
what? Hound of resurrection?
"harbinger of pestilence. Seed of destruc-- "
cut to the end. How do l kill it?

go to the front. Let's go! Move!
l'm going around the back.
Oh, crap.
child.
all grown up, l see.
that voice.
lt was the first lullaby you ever heard, my son.
l ushered you into this world.
l alone know your true calling, your true name.
name this.
that thing. That thing. -What do you think you're doing?
what do you think you're doing? -Helping you. l
nobody helps me!
lt's my job.
you want to help? Here. Load this.
lt's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.
Jesus, what's that on your arm?
Oh, crap.
what the hell is that thing?
let me go ask.
all right, keep coming. Good. Keep coming.
why, you little...
wait!
we're heading toward civilians.
crazy costumes, huh? Trick or treat.
red means stop!
you all right? -Yeah.
stay here.
Sammy, you got a leak.
waiting for me, chunk-face?
what the--?
l'm on your side. -Sure.
that's right!
open wide!
son of a
Yuck!
screw this.
l'm fireproof.
you're not.
Hey, Myers.
yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
how's your arm?
Yeah, my arm's fine. Where are you?
l just fried Stinky.
listen...
...tell Father l'll be home...
...but he shouldn't wait up.
no. No, wait, wait.
Yeah, I gotta go with you.
Hey, Myers. -Yeah?
Bye.
damn it.
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.
die in peace...
...and be reborn again and again.
only seven more days till the eclipse.
the child will be there, and so will we all.
won't we?
there's a big, red man down there.
that's fine, darling. Santa's not here for another month.
not Santa.
well, who, then?
l brought beer.
Oh, Red, your arm.
you better get that looked at.
l wanted to see you.
every time the media gets a look at him, they run to me.
l'm running out of lies, Trevor.
l thought you like being on TV. -l do.
so how many escapes this year alone? Five.
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.
your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red, has a tail and is government-funded.
l know where to find him.
l'll get him back. -Hey, fish stick.
don't touch anything.
l need to touch it to see.
see what? -Past, future.
whatever this object holds.
ls he serious?
don't worry about fingerprints. Never had any.
professor, they were here.
who was here? Nixon? Houdini?
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?
show me, Abe. Show me what happened here.
this is east-wing check-in. We're all clear.
also, make sure it's all locked up over there in the annex.
Roger that.
Kroenen!
move.
move!
there he is!
we'll cover him from here!
all right, don't move! Put that down.
put down the weapon!
get them.
drop the weapon.
on the ground!
last warning!
take him out!
now, ready the welcome, my love.
salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels.
restraining the essence...
...of Sammael, the hellhound.
the seed of destruction.
this l can promise, Sammael.
for each one of you that falls...
...Two shall arise.
professor. -l'm all right.
professor.
you...
you are very sick.
l don't want Hellboy to know.
sixty years ago, they tried to destroy the world.
they're back.
ln my lifetime, they're back...
...to finish the job.
we miss you at the bureau.
abe's crazier every day.
father's still mad at me.
come back, Liz.
come back. -No. No, H. B.
no, not this time.
l don't like it here...
...but l haven't had an episode in months.
and you know what?
l'm learning to control it.
l'm learning where it comes from.
for the first time in my life...
...l'm not afraid.
looks like your ride is here. -Have escort stand by.
the Nanny Squad.
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.
sir, may l go first?
hang on a minute.
he barely knows him.
listen, H. B...
...l've got a chance out here.
so if you really care about me...
...you won't come back.
yeah...
...l gotta go too.
lots to do.
what took you so long?
come on, time to go home.
tape you up.
Nope, l never was. -Well, you could have fooled me.
Hey, Red.
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.
this is nothing.
you know what'll kill me, don't you?
okay, Red, let's get you home. Come on.
you were burned by some organic acid.
l'm lucky that way.
l worry about you. -Me?
well...
...l won't be around forever, you know.
Damn!
could you please be a little careful?
big baby.
how long was it latched onto you?
l don't know. About five seconds.
professor, look. -ls it bad?
touched you five seconds, laid three eggs.
didn't even buy me a drink.
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs.
they are very sensitive to heat and light.
they need a humid, dark environment to breed.
did you ever lose track of him?
well, let's see.
there was that moment when l had the train on top of my head.
we can't risk it.
tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents.
search the whole place top to bottom.
find those eggs and destroy them.
'Elizabeth Sherman. "
I don't like the term " fire-starter. "
I just don't.
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something.
I don't know.
maybe that's right.
not being able to let go.
it's scary.
I black out after each episode. Sometimes for hours.
you hear about so and so...
...who just lost control and just exploded.
well, they're lucky it isn't true.
with me, it is.
my master is calling your name now, my girl.
you must return to the child.
so once again...
...dream...
...of fire.
Hey, freak!
get back here, freak!
let's get her! -Get her!
get her, guys! -Watch this!
freak!
Oh, no! Not again.
Oh, no! Somebody!
help me!
help me, somebody! Help me!
how many buildings does she have to burn down?
she belongs here.
that's not what she feels.
professor, the girl you're
professor, that girl you're talking about...
Hey, Boy Scout...
Hey, Boy Scout...
...think twice.
no, listen, l read her file.
'read her file. " -She blames herself...
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh. Look, l think l can help.
l could talk to her.
l think l could bring her back.
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes, " huh?
what was it?
punctuality? The way you part your hair?
what is your area of expertise?
he doesn't want me with him.
l know that much.
you're doing fine. -No, l'm not.
look, he respects Clay, not me.
l'm really sorry, okay?
l'm not your guy.
l'm dying, Agent Myers.
like any father, l worry about him.
ln medieval stories, there is often a young knight...
...who is inexperienced...
...but pure of heart. -Come on.
look, l am not pure of heart.
Yes, you are.
Rasputin is back for him.
what l ask of you...
...is to have the courage to stand by him when l am gone.
he was born a demon. Can't change that.
but you will help him...
...in essence...
...to become a man.
pull that down.
she was making great progress...
...and now this.
we'll be closed for months.
and it put a big dent in our Thorazine supply.
she's been like this since it happened.
are you sure you want to go in?
miss Sherman?
l'm Agent Myers, FBl.
miss Sherman?
can l call you Liz?
lt's a beautiful name.
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named Liz.
well, it's impressive by my standards. My name's John.
John T. Myers.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau.
no special precautions, no security escorts.
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks.
that doesn't sound like him.
well, Miss Sherman, he's asking you back...
...but it's entirely your choice, you know?
choice, huh?
that's cute.
l've quit the bureau 13 times.
l always go back.
where else would l go?
over here.
you said those eggs need it dark and humid?
well, they hit the jackpot.
the subway lines, they all converge right around here.
right below us is the old Vandeveer reservoir.
lt was abandoned in the mid-30s.
there's a pulse.
there. A cistern on the other side.
most of the eggs are there.
there's no way in.
we should go back and request a special permit, type 2
you guys coming or what?
we lead a charmed life.
here you are, doctor.
reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.
remind me why l keep doing this.
this doesn't really look like doll's hair.
be honest, Red. What do you think?
l'm thinking about doing it myself.
Hey, you guys find anything?
no eggs yet, Red.
what, are you on a lunch break?
nothing here.
red's on the move. l'll cover him.
damn it, Red.
Hey, it's Abe.
Oh, God.
bring your toy over here.
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.
there's only one. l'll fry him quick.
two. There were two.
red?
red. Come in, Red.
l got no signal. Where the hell are you?
it's like Swiss cheese in here.
sit tight, pal, l'm on him.
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.
Oh, crap.
you shouldn't hurt people!
Hey, chunk-face.
you can do better than that, big monster like you.
my kittens! Please!
second date.
my kittens. Careful with them!
lady, give me a break!
thank you.
clay.
man down. l need an ambulance right away. Do you read me?
quarry, Moss, do you read me?
quarry, Moss, do you read me? Man down!
feels good to be outside. lt's been so long.
you know that's-- That's not safe Miss Sherman.
please stay in the car.
no, no. Miss Sherman. Please, can you come down, Miss Sherman?
nice view.
Hey, a smile, huh? Yeah, that's good.
damn.
you'll have to take another one later. -Yeah.
not everyone was so lucky.
we had two agents die today.
clay probably won't survive the night.
not now, Manning, please. -My problem with you:
you're reckless.
these men trusted you to lead them as a team.
l knew those men better than you did.
that makes it all right, then. -No, it doesn't make it all right.
you have an insight. You know monsters.
because in the end...
...there's still one left.
you.
Hey, Manning.
Oh, you should have a look around.
we made some changes around here.
l want that thing locked up, starting now.
locked up! -Nothing's changed.
home sweet home.
Liz!
you did it, buddy. You did it!
Myers?
pop?
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, what's that on your wrist?
this?
lt's something l learned in therapy. -Yeah?
l'm depressed, one rubber band.
l'm impatient...
...Two rubber bands.
maybe...
Yeah, maybe two.
Yeah, maybe.
one minute. One minute.
Hey, Myers...
...you're a talker.
well...
... " need " is a good, solid word.
too needy.
start in, okay? You got nachos coming.
nachos.
Oh, my God.
look at them all.
who had babies?
will it take long? Because l'm actually going out.
out?
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
are you going alone?
no, Myers is taking me.
Hey, your chili's getting cold.
not hungry.
ls there something you'd like me to hear?
lt's just a list. lt's not finished. -Okay.
well, then, later.
see you.
well, good night.
goodbye.

sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?
do you want anything else? The shop's closing.

what are you two talking about?
what is so fascinating, so important?
some people would call that cocky.
he's just strong. -Yeah. That he is.
Hey, l've got yours.
my uncle, he used to say we like people for their qualities...
...but love them for their defects.
he loves you, you know.
what about you?
l don't know. l grew up with him.
but now every time l see him, l get confused.
there's hardly a day that goes by that he's not in my mind.
even now...
...l feel like he's here.
Hey, wait up.
Thanks. That was nice. -l got a cookie, as well.

you sound like a game-show host. -Hi.
you're Hellboy.
l'm on a mission.
all right, tell me something about you. Where do you come from?
then l went to Quantico, went to top of my class. l'm nothing like
don't tell anyone, huh?
Attaboy.
sir, he left his locator.

who wants us in Moscow?
she's sitting on a park bench, and she's laughing.
that's it. l'm done.
they don't look like spies.
are you kidding me?
look at this guy.
those shady little eyes, that phony grin.
are you going to eat that? -No.
Yeah, the old yawning trick.
first he wants my job, then he wants my girl.
Hey, we all have a side that we try to hide.
God
Hey, what the hell?
Hey! Hey, who threw that?
nice shot.
Sebastian Plackba, number 1 6.
lt's Rasputin's mausoleum.
l see the puppet.
but where is the puppeteer?
very good, Professor Broom.
lt was you.
the scraps of paper...
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.
bread crumbs on the trail.
like in a fable.
they both distract him...
...and guide him exactly where l need him.
Moscow.
his destiny.
and the last clue...
...will be left by the late Professor Broom.
you raised the child.
nurtured him.
so in return...
...l will permit you...
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.
if only you had had him destroyed 60 years ago...
but then, how could you have known?
your God chooses to remain silent.
mine lives within me.
every time l died and crossed over...
...came back with me.
he disclosed to me the child's true name.
would you like to know it?
l know what to call him.
...can change that.
...Son.
lt'll be quick.
just go there and tell her how you feel.
my mom says that
look, it's not-- lt's not that easy, okay?
Plus, you're 9.
all right, stand by. -Who are those guys?
Liz, l'm sorry. lt's Broom. Let's go. We need to find him.
no, not him.
would you take her? -Something's wrong.
he hasn't spoken to anybody in three days.
not a word.
l've never seen him like this.
never.
should l stay?
listen, l'm not much of a problem solver.
but l do know this much.
...all us freaks have is each other.
and l'm stuck here.
so...
...Take care of the big monkey for me, will you?
l have accumulated many objects of great interest...
...preserving our heritage.
many, like me, believe Mother Russia...
...to be very close to a historic rebirth.
"Rebirth " ?
l like that.
twenty tons of stone.
june 30th, 1908.
the Romanovs took possession of it immediately.
l've wanted it for ages.
you're aware, of course...
...there's no way you'll get it out of Russian territory.
he is aware. Our guests are coming in.
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from Moscow, that's where we're going.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16. That's the only clue we have.
we've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs...
...but we have no trace of this Sammael or this Rasputin character.
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment.
Hellboy's coming.
l'm not pleased about that, but l'll be in charge this time.
we either wrap this up or l'm closing this freak show for good.
Hi.
Hi.
l'll...
...if you're still going.
l am.
l understand what you don't like about me.
l do.
what l am...
...makes you feel a little out of place...
...out there.
red, l don't-- -Listen.
he makes you feel like you belong...
...which is good, really.
l wish l could do something about this.
l can't.
l can promise you two things:
one, l'll always look this good.
and two...
...l'll never give up on you.
ever.
this engraving here represents Sammy. Text reads:
"one falls, two shall arise. Sammael. "
we'll have to nail them all at once, and the eggs.
and when we do, no mumbo jumbo.
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.
we've installed a handy little timer. You set it, you walk away.

kaboom.
"Sparky"?
who came up with that? Myers?
Yeah, we're leaving the main road, so hang on.
this better be the place or l'll puke.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
lt's practically a city.
and it stinks, and it's muddy.
l think we go back, we check into the hotel, we regroup.
after breakfast.
l think what we have to do here is we have to make a grid.
let me ask for directions.
where are you going?
come on, baby, find me a talker.
hi there.
come on.
come on.
come on.
what do you want?
this is ridiculous.
l run this show, not him.
this guy's nothing but trouble.
ten minutes, we're out of here. -Will you shut up...
...and let him do his thing?
anybody got a PowerBar?
sixty feet further, comrades.
and three rows in.
what the hell is that on his back?
this here is lvan Klimentovich.
say " hi, " lvan.
go that way, Red Monkey!
gotcha.
lvan says there's a whole network of tunnels down here.
goes on for miles.
stay close, everybody.
you better be right about this.
we'll be all right as long as we don't separate.
Hey, Sparky.
tell everyone to turn their locator belts on. Anybody sees anything...
l'll say " Marco. "
polo.
are you sure about this? -On a scale of one to ten: two.
don't worry, Boy Scout, she'll take care of you.
she's a tough one.
come on.
ask your buddy how far this thing goes.
how you doing up there, lvan?
would you mind holding this guy for a while? He is so negative.
what the hell is that?
something big.
lime, come with me. -Right.
no, no, no. Stay put!
you listen to me.
listen to me!
l'm in charge.
we're gonna go back. You can take that door apart.
lime, let's go!
and you! l am not afraid of you!
l'm in charge! We go back!
l was better off dead!
music.
really went deep.
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
what are you laughing at, you Nazi son of a--?

that's all for you, pinhead.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? -Having a

thank you.
so he thinks you and l...
what?
well, that, you know, you feel that way about me.
you want to know that here? Now?
Yeah.
red, white, whatever. Guys are all the same.
Hey, wait up.
have you found them yet?
okay, good.
could you hurry up? Because it's a little spooky in here.
Liz, wait.
Oh, my God.
let's back out real slow.
let's back out real slow.
Myers, ready your grenades.
Marco. Marco. Marco.
get your big, red butt over here.
no piggybacks!
get off me, you
Liz, no!
they're gonna kill him! Do something!
what do you want me to do?
hit me. -What?
hit me.
now!
you should be running.
they are all here.
all of them.
this one's awake.
thank you for this.
and l looked...
these were the words l heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.
and now, the door.
sent by the Ogdru Jahad...
...so that they might at long last enter our world.
you are the key, the right hand of doom.
your stone hand.
what did you think it was made for?
open the locks.
silence.
lmagine it.
an Eden...
...for you and her.
no.
no?
ln exchange for her soul, then?
open the door.
as you wish.
No!
Liz!
her soul awaits on the other side.
lf you want her back...
...open the door and claim her.
your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you.
you cannot break them...
...no matter how strong you are.
the eclipse has begun.
your true name...
...say it!

for her.
Anung un Rama.
repeat it.
Anung un Rama.
open the final lock.
remember who you are!
believe me, l have lived long enough to know...
...not a tear will be shed for this world!
you have a choice.
your father gave you that.
no, you don't!
open it!
do it!
what have you done?
you will never fulfill your destiny.
you will never understand the power inside you.
l'll just have to find a way to live with that.
child.
look what you've done.
you've killed me...
...a god.
Myers, let's go.
hell will hold no surprises for us.
l took a grenade belt.
the damn thing's broken.
keep her safe, will you?
whatever happens, don't leave her alone.
l won't.
you're okay, Myers.
stick around.
Hey, Red.
just pull the cable.
l didn't get you anything.
are you going to be okay alone?
Damn!
damn.
Oh, this is gonna hurt.
gonna be sore in the morning.
she's not breathing.
Liz?
l was so foolish.
red.
...l heard your voice.
what did you say?
l said, " Hey...
...you on the other side...
...Let her go.
because for
for her l'll cross over.
and then you'll be sorry. "
what makes a man a man?
a friend of mine once wondered.
I don't think so.
it's the choices he makes.
not how he starts things...
...but how he decides to end them.
Hey, guys? l'm still here.
Hello?
what is it that makes a man a man?
is it his origins, the way things start?
or is it something else, something harder to describe?
for me, it all began in 1944.
classified mission off the coast of Scotland.
the Nazis were desperate.
combining science and black magic......they intended to upset the balance of the war.
I was 28, already a paranormal advisor to President Roosevelt.
I could never have suspected that what would transpire that night...
...would not only affect the course of history...
...but change my life forever.
all right, men, let's go. Move!
come on! Come on! Come on!
let's fan it out.
your men...
...they'll need these.
are you a Catholic?
Yes. Among other things. But that's hardly the point.
well, you're gonna need one of these.
l abhor the use of violence.
thank you. l wouldn't want you to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.
no, three days too late for that, Professor Broom.
all right, you guys, let's move, move, move, move!
come on boys, let's go!
this way! Left, right!
come on, men, let's get the lead out!
we're close!
you're wasting our time. There's nothing here but sheep and rocks.
ruins, not rocks. -Hold it right here!
the remains of Trondham Abbey, built on an intersection of ley lines...
...the boundaries between our world and the others.
what a load of crap!
hell, a week ago, l never even heard the word " parabnormal. "
paranormal.
move it!
hold the line.
come on!
sweet Jesus.
they must be here for the sheep.
the freak in the gas mask...
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

l will not leave you.
l grant you everlasting life...
...youth...
...and the power to serve me.
llsa! Grigori!

five years of research and construction, Grigori.
five years!
the fuhrer doesn't look kindly on failure.
there will be no failure, general.
l promised Herr Hitler a miracle.
l'll deliver one.
what l will do tonight can never be undone!
what l will do tonight can never be undone!
l will open a portal...
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:
the Seven Gods of Chaos!
our enemies will be destroyed!
and from the ashes...
...a new Eden will arise.

do you understand? We have to stop them.
go! Go! Go! Go!
look out!
get down!
lt's almost over.
no, it's not.
the portal's been open for too long.
something may have come through.
have your men search the area thoroughly.
spread out over that way!
sir! Something up here!
he's gone.
for now.
when you said something came through...
from where?
l don't see them!
do you really, really believe in hell?
there is a place, a dark place...
...where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return.
grigori gave us a glance tonight. -Grigori?
that's Russian, right?
grigori Efimovich Rasputin.
Rasputin?
come on! -Occult adviser to the Romanovs.
ln 1916, at a dinner in his honor...
...he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed...
...castrated and finally drowned.
and yet, we saw him here tonight.
professor Broom.
careful. Be careful.
what the hell is that? An ape? -No.
lt was red. Bright red.
lower your light, you're scaring it.
what are you two shooting at? -A red ape!
no, it's not an ape.

jump down.
come on. Jump down.
lt's a boy.
lt's just a baby boy.
move to the left.
there we were, an unready father for an unwanted child.
the boys gave him a name that very night.
in retrospect, perhaps not the most fortunate.
but nevertheless, a name we all came to use.
we called him Hellboy.
look at the birdie.
speculation about the origins...
evidence that Hellboy...
so, what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
I kid you not. It hunts monsters.
the claim, of course, that this creature...
...works for the FBI as a monster hunter.
this is a sacred place.
give me my gold.
we shouldn't be here.
master.
your eyes.
what did they do to your eyes?
have you told him yet? -No.
we should.
malignant sarcoma.

...how long? -Maybe six weeks.
l can arrange for hospitalization and pain management.
make the time more bearable. -No.
l'd rather be at home.
l have some arrangements to make.
for my son.
you can always get a second opinion.
that won't be necessary.
hurry up!
hurry up! -Wait right here!
Tom Manning is the head of special operations at the FBI.
he joins Pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.
there. That's the tail.
and these are the horns.
l have a question.
ln the pictures of aliens, UFO, the yeti, Hellboy...
...why is it they're always out of focus?
why don't you tell us...
...about the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense?
l wanna tell you, l wanna tell the American public one thing.

paranormal Research and Defense.
there is no such thing.

abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
'Unique. " That's a word you'll hear frequently around here.
sir, where am l, exactly?
as you entered the lobby, there was an inscription:
'ln the absence of light, darkness prevails. "
there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.
make no mistake about that.
and we are the ones who bump back.
1937, Hitler joins the Thule Society...
...a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
1938, he acquired the Spear of Longinus...
...which pierced the side of Christ.

he still angry? -Well, you did break out.
l wanted to see her.
nobody's business. -lt is. You got yourself on TV again.
Myers, huh?

Oh, no, no, no. Nothing. Nothing at all.

...where just hours ago, an alarm was triggered.
the N.Y.P.D. has yet to issue a statement.

apparently, not everything was fake.
father.
the entity is still in there.
video surveillance shows a 16th-century statue was destroyed.
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.
who wards off demons. -Exactly.
the statue, however, was hollow.
a reliquary.
a prison.
the Vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough...
...to include it on The List of Avignon, of which, by the way, we hold a copy.
perfect job for these babies.
made them myself.
holy water, clove leaf, silver shavings, white oak. The works.
behind this door, a dark entity.
evil, ancient and hungry.
Oh, well. Let me go in and say hi.
you better hit the books, Brother Blue.
we'll definitely need more info on this one.
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

the whole " lonely hero " thing.
Hey, Stinky.

Oh, crap.
that's it for you, Sam.
red, you need to hear the rest of the information.
no, he's taken care of.

lt's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.
Jesus, what's that on your arm?
Oh, crap.

Yeah, I gotta go with you.
Hey, Myers. -Yeah?
Bye.

Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.
die in peace...
...and be reborn again and again.
only seven more days till the eclipse.
the child will be there, and so will we all.
won't we?
there's a big, red man down there.
that's fine, darling. Santa's not here for another month.
not Santa.
well, who, then?
l brought beer.
Oh, Red, your arm.
you better get that looked at.
l wanted to see you.
every time the media gets a look at him, they run to me.
l'm running out of lies, Trevor.
l thought you like being on TV. -l do.
so how many escapes this year alone? Five.
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.
your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red, has a tail and is government-funded.
l know where to find him.
l'll get him back. -Hey, fish stick.
don't touch anything.
l need to touch it to see.
see what? -Past, future.
whatever this object holds.
ls he serious?
don't worry about fingerprints. Never had any.
professor, they were here.
who was here? Nixon? Houdini?
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?
show me, Abe. Show me what happened here.
this is east-wing check-in. We're all clear.
also, make sure it's all locked up over there in the annex.
Roger that.
Kroenen!

now, ready the welcome, my love.
salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels.
restraining the essence......of Sammael, the hellhound.
the seed of destruction.
this l can promise, Sammael.
for each one of you that falls...
...Two shall arise.
professor. -l'm all right.
professor.
you...
you are very sick.
l don't want Hellboy to know.
sixty years ago, they tried to destroy the world.
they're back.
ln my lifetime, they're back...
...to finish the job.
we miss you at the bureau.
abe's crazier every day.
father's still mad at me.
come back, Liz.
come back. -No. No, H.B.
no, not this time.
l don't like it here...
...but l haven't had an episode in months.
and you know what?
l'm learning to control it.
l'm learning where it comes from.
for the first time in my life...
...l'm not afraid.
looks like your ride is here. -Have escort stand by.
the Nanny Squad.
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.
sir, may l go first?
hang on a minute.
he barely knows him.
listen, H.B...
...l've got a chance out here.
so if you really care about me...
...you won't come back.
yeah...
...l gotta go too.
lots to do.
what took you so long?
come on, time to go home.
tape you up.
Nope, l never was. -Well, you could have fooled me.
Hey, Red.
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.
this is nothing.
you know what'll kill me, don't you?
okay, Red, let's get you home. Come on.
you were burned by some organic acid.
l'm lucky that way.
l worry about you. -Me?
well...
...l won't be around forever, you know.
Damn!
could you please be a little careful?
big baby.
how long was it latched onto you?
l don't know. About five seconds.
professor, look. -ls it bad?
touched you five seconds, laid three eggs.
didn't even buy me a drink.
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs.
they are very sensitive to heat and light.
they need a humid, dark environment to breed.
did you ever lose track of him?
well, let's see.
there was that moment when l had the train on top of my head.
we can't risk it.
tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents.
search the whole place top to bottom.
find those eggs and destroy them.
'Elizabeth Sherman. "
I don't like the term " fire-starter. "
I just don't.
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something.
I don't know.
maybe that's right.
not being able to let go.
it's scary.
I black out after each episode. Sometimes for hours.
you hear about so and so...
...who just lost control and just exploded.
well, they're lucky it isn't true.
with me, it is.
my master is calling your name now, my girl.
you must return to the child.
so once again...
...dream...
...of fire.
Hey, freak!
get back here, freak!
let's get her! -Get her!
get her, guys! -Watch this!
freak!
Oh, no! Not again.
Oh, no! Somebody!
help me!
help me, somebody! Help me!
how many buildings does she have to burn down?
she belongs here.
that's not what she feels.
she may never feel it. lt's her choice.
she may never feel it. lt's her choice.
professor, the girl you're
professor, that girl you're talking about...
Hey, Boy Scout...
Hey, Boy Scout...
...think twice.
no, listen, l read her file.
'read her file. " -She blames herself...
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh. Look, l think l can help.
l could talk to her.
l think l could bring her back.
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes, " huh?
what was it?
punctuality? The way you part your hair?
what is your area of expertise?
he doesn't want me with him.
l know that much.
you're doing fine. -No, l'm not.
look, he respects Clay, not me.
l'm really sorry, okay?
l'm not your guy.
l'm dying, Agent Myers.
like any father, l worry about him.
ln medieval stories, there is often a young knight...
...who is inexperienced...
...but pure of heart. -Come on.
look, l am not pure of heart.
Yes, you are.
Rasputin is back for him.
what l ask of you...
...is to have the courage to stand by him when l am gone.
he was born a demon. Can't change that.
but you will help him...
...in essence...
...to become a man.
pull that down.
she was making great progress...
...and now this.
we'll be closed for months.
and it put a big dent in our Thorazine supply.
she's been like this since it happened.
are you sure you want to go in?
miss Sherman?
l'm Agent Myers, FBl.
miss Sherman?
can l call you Liz?
lt's a beautiful name.
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named Liz.
well, it's impressive by my standards. My name's John.
John T. Myers.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau.
no special precautions, no security escorts.
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks.
that doesn't sound like him.
well, Miss Sherman, he's asking you back...
...but it's entirely your choice, you know?
choice, huh?
that's cute.
l've quit the bureau 13 times.
l always go back.
where else would l go?
over here.
you said those eggs need it dark and humid?
well, they hit the jackpot.
the subway lines, they all converge right around here.
right below us is the old Vandeveer reservoir.
lt was abandoned in the mid-30s.
there's a pulse.
there. A cistern on the other side.
most of the eggs are there.
there's no way in.
we should go back and request a special permit, type 2
you guys coming or what?
we lead a charmed life.
here you are, doctor.
this should cover your tail fin.

rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
this doesn't really look like doll's hair.
be honest, Red. What do you think?
l'm thinking about doing it myself.
Hey, you guys find anything?
no eggs yet, Red.
what, are you on a lunch break?
somewhere in the nevada desert.
Hi,Ted.
no internet connectiong available.
Ted...I know you're there.
I'm not online, how are you doing this?
I know what the did to you?
look at the needle.
we should meet!
trun around.
my name is Hana Gitelman.
how the hell did you do that?
satellite signals.
WiFi, radio waves.
your computer can download them and so can I.
so you can, uh, access the internet without a computer.
just pull email out of your head.
Yes.
and you're radioactive.
why come to me?
because they got to me too.
I can find them,Ted.
and you can nuke them.
turned on the waterworks, and they were mine.
they're getting the suitcase as we speak.
Where's the bag?
you may fool Ando, but you do not fool me.
Matt Parkman, here to protect you, sir.
sir, we've got to get out of here right now.
this is a setup. - What? How do you know that?
I just do.
now, you absorb all these abilities you find.
I'm gonna teach you how to pull 'em out one at a time.
I don't have to do anything!
except fly.
hello. Zane Taylor?
Yes.
you must be Dr.Suresh. Come on in.
there are others out there like you.
and I am going to find them.
I could go with you.
she had an appointment with a neurologist.
your mother's been having some headaches.
Yeah, she's also been having some memory loss.
did you tell them that?
I don't know any Mr. Muggles.
and I don't know you.
dad?
Where's dad?
he's on one of his stupid business trips.
there's something wrong with mom.
there's something wrong with you.
mom?
do you know who this is?
Claire, leave your brother alone.
you recognize us?
Yes, you are the daughter who is supposed to be setting the dinner table.
I was standing right there just a minute ago, and you had no idea who I was.
Lyle, help your sister with the table.
honestly, claire.
good thing dad's not home, 'cause he would so drug test you.
it's good you called us, Isaac.
I didn't know who else to trust.
that man, Peter Petrelli, Gng to be rponsible for all this.
I tried finding him.
I kept painting what I thought were empty spaces.
and now?
there, in the water.
footprints.
so...
Peter's invisible?
that sound so crazy?
any more than a man who can paint the future?
Peter absorbs others' abilities.
apparently, he's met someone who we assumed was dead.
that's the roof of the...-the Deveaux building.
look, there's a chance that Peter might come here first before we reach him.
what do you expect me to do with this?
save the world.
you know what? Let me do that.
I am pregnant, not porcelain. - No, I'm just trying to be Mr. Helpful.
try Mr. Get-the-hell out-of-the-way.
what did you do?
you like it?
I love it.
I do. - Yeah?
Matt, we can't afford this.
I mean, we're- - nah, come on. I got a guy.
he gave it to me wholesale, so...
I'm so bloated.
you, you look so beautiful to me.
I'm sorry.
you-- Made this beautiful gesture, and I have to mess it up.
what do you mean?
a man called yesterday.
a professor Suresh.
he was a geneticist.
he wanted to talk about DNA.
Matt, your DNA.
did you tell him anything?
I mean, you didn't tell him anything, did you?
of course I didn't tell him anything.
he found you.
he knows.
geneticists.
who are these people?
um, before we go in, I just wanted to say thanks.
for what?
well, you know, for bringing me with you.
you didn't have to do that.
it would have been a long road alone.
I'm glad for the company.
well, I believe in fate,Mohinder,and Karma,and I'm not just saying that 'cause you're Indian.
I mean, you really came to my rescue, and I won't forget that.
it's not completely altruistic on my part, Zane.
I have a feeling we're gonna meet up with a lot of skepticism from these people.
you can help.
I'm ready.
excuse me!
excuse me.
rap music.
can't stand it, but it's the only thing I've found that cancels out the
can I help you?
we're looking for Dale Smither.
you found her.
Oh. O-of course.
I'm Mohinder Suresh, and this is Mr. Taylor.
Zane. Actually, it's just Zane.
I left you several messages this week.
Yeah, I got 'em.
I believe I can help with what's happening to you.
I'm sure you have lots of questions.
Yeah, only one-- how'd you find me?
you gave blood 11 years ago.
signed a consent form to have a sample used in a program called the human genome project.
you dialed the wrong number.
look, I know what you're thinking right now, that you've got nobody to talk to, nobody that understands what you're going through.
but that's not true.
I-I understand.
yeah?
damn.
that was my best wrench.
so there really are others, huh?
Yes. I'm proof of that.
that's why we're here.
I-I-- I thought the headaches at first were gonna kill me.
I'd lie awake at night thinking that my head was gonna explode.
a cockroach crawling across my neighbor's floor was like a marching band parading through my house.
I'm sorry. It must be quite a burden.
a burden?
hell, no.
this is the best damn thing that ever happened to me.
well, now that I've learned to control it, I'm like superman or something.
I can hear rain coming from 40 miles away.
I can even hear someone's moods-- the tiniest changes in a heartbeat.
yours, for instance.
it's racing kind of fast.
you nervous about something?
um, no, I'm just excited to meet somebody like me.
well, if you've come to try to take it away from me, you're gonna have a hell of a fight on your hands.
I can assure you we only want to help.
uh, I'd like to perform a few tests, s-some questions, really, that's all. Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
I'm kinda backed up today.
we can come back in the morning.
okay.
Ando
is that you? I'm locked in!
you're not Ando.
state Gaming Commission.
I come in peace.
what's an Ando?
Ando is my friend.
I bring him from Japan on my mission.
Where's the girl?
Oh! Where's the suitcase?
she said her name Hope.
tell me where they are!
take me with you.
I must save Ando.
not a chance.
I work alone, pal.
you take me with you or she gets away...pal.
I so miss you, Karen.
I miss your laugh.
but they're gonna pay for what they did to me.
what they did to us.
I know you're not gonna like what I gotta do.
so, uh, I came to say good-bye.
enough! I say when it's enough!
you've got a power to stop me.
what are you waiting for?
I'm trying!
and when you've left New York a smoking wasteland, we'll put that on your tombstone: "Here lies Peter Petrelli.
he tried.
dig into that file cabinet of yours and pull something out!
fly, stop time, paint me a pretty picture.
Do...something...unexpected!
you pushed that away with your mind.
which one of your sorry friends has telekinesis?
none of them do.
right--that guy who was chasing Claire in Texas.
he sent some lockers flying at me.
Texas?
and you pulled that little trick out in the here and now?
well, we might just have a chance at stopping you from going nuclear.
I tried. Every street I painted, every building empty.
I think Peter's left New York.
why does this seem so familiar?
Oh, now I remember.
you'd get that same look on your face when you'd lie to me about using.
you think I'm lying?
you're right.
I can't willingly throw you into another man's arms.
because you're jealous.
because he's dangerous.
Oh, god.
I don't think I should have this anymore.
no. Keep it. Please.
I would do anything for you, Simone.
anything.
find Peter.
look, you're nothing but a Japanese mapquest for me.
so till we find that girl, just sit there and shut up.
I bring Ando from Japan on my mission.
I am responsible for him.
all a partner ever does is either drag you under or screw you over.
a partner helps by believing in you. He keeps you honest.
well. Who wanted to help the girl?
grab the suitcase?
take your car?
Ando.
you take on a partner, all you get is their blood on your hands.
why are we stopping here?
I thought we were going to your mother's house.
the less questions you ask,Ando, the better off you'll be in life.
why is that?
that'd be another question.
here, I will help you with-- - no, I've got it.
it's okay-- no
what is this?
what did I say about asking questions?
you know, I have to admit, Zane, when you first offered to help,
I was-- I was cautious.
in what way? - I don't know you.
you don't know me. It could have been a disaster.
you...
made a difference today.
thank you.
here is your key.
when you told that woman Dale that you could help her, is that really possible?
it's only theoretical at this point.
but I am working on an inhibitor, a chemical that'll isolate the genetic mutation that causes these abnormalities.
we can offer these people understanding, control, or, if needed, elimination of their ability.
elimination? You make it sound like a virus or plague.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply-- it's just not all of you exhibit it's just not all of you exhibit the same sets of skills you do.
and they can be dangerous.
my father had to learn that firsthand.
how's that?
he was murdered by a man named Sylar.
well, what happened to this...Sylar?
I'm not sure.
he just got away with killing your dad?
I only know he's gone, locked away.
what does it matter? Even if I could come face-to-face with him, what difference would it make?
justice can never really be served.
what a shame.
they're out there.
I can feel them...
so innocent, so unaware of what's happening to them.
we'll find them, Mohinder.
all of them, together. The two of us.
it's our destiny.
I'm gonna call it a night.
I'll catch you in the morning.
Claire, do we need to talk?
no.
Yes.
mom, you know how you sometimes forget things?
honey, is this about my trip to the neurologist?
it's just some headaches. I don't want you to worry.
but they don't know what's causing it, right?
we are still waiting on the results from the tests.
what if it's not some thing that's responsible for it but someone?
what on earth are you talking about?
what if you knew a secret, and they had a way to brainwash you?
you have been studying long enough.
let's curl up in my bed, piece of pie, glass of milk, and watch an old cary grant movie.
mom, I'm serious.
I know this is a little scary, but dad's in charge of talking to the doctors, and they will come up with the answers.
maybe you shouldn't trust dad so much.
now, why would you say that? - What if it gets worse...
and next time that you-- Mom!
mom!
mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
mom!
mom, please wake up.
what's this all about anyways? - What's what?
the birds.
I mean, you...you sort of hate everything, everyone.
except you treat these pigeons like they're family.
Charles Darwin bred pigeons when he was working out his theory of evolution.
married up various permutations to get maximum potential.
what do you mean by that, maximum potential?
I think he meant you, friend.
but you used to care.
about all this.
didn't you?
all right, sharing time's over.
time to get...
what are you doing? - Something unexpected.
Claire, this isn't a great time.
dad, you have to come home.
mom fell and she blacked out. I called 911
what happened to her?
I came home and she didn't even know who I was.
she didn't even remember Mr. Muggles.
I'm coming home right away.
Claude'll have to wait.
Matt, where are you?
Hey, what's up?
the ring.
I took it to get resized, and the jeweler told me it was worth $40,000.
well, that's ridiculous.
and he accused me of stealing it.
I had to tell him my husband was a cop and there has to be some kind of an explanation.
there is an explanation, right?
the guy that I was protecting, Malsky...those were his.
those were his. - You have to give them back.
I can't.
I can't. He's dead.
hmm. Uh, I need to sit down.
See，honey, this is why I didn't want to tell you about this, okay?
you were gonna get upset... - You let me keep the ring.
it was stolen property. What were you thinking?
I don't know what I was thinking. I have no idea.
you know,Matt, for a guy that can...
read other people's thoughts, you should spend a little bit of time on your own.
you know what? I'm just trying to figure out how to take care of our family.
I don't have a job,Jan.
and I'm worried that the baby
ever since you told me about this thing, this thing that you do,
I have tried to act like everything's okay, but it's not.
it's stealing and lying.
Matt, you're better than this!
all right. Fine, I'll take them down to the precinct.
call them right now. - What?
call them right now.
Hello?
what?
where are you right now?
Yeah. Yeah, I know the place. I'll be right there.
who was that?
I, uh, I gotta go out. - Where?
how you feeling?
you knew they were after you. - Who? I don't know who they were!
you wanted to know why I was invisible all these years.
it was because of them, and you've brought the bastards right to my door!
I just saved your ass!
you've no idea what you've done.
your mate, the painter.
he took your girl up to the roof. He must have known we were up there.
isaac. He's a comic book artist.
let's call a spade a shovel, mate. It had to be Isaac.
they got to him.
you said yourself he disappeared for a bit, right?
Yeah, so? - Well, that's how it works.
at least, that's how it did in my day.
you drop off the face of the earth for a few days, wake up with a memory hole, a killer headache, and a souvenir.
did he have a set of these?
I don't know. - What is that? Those are for the lucky ones.
so what do we do now-- hey!
we?
you watch your own back. I do what I always do-- disappear.
I'm not letting you run again. We're getting somewhere with all this.
you should have thought of that before you brought your baggage to my roof.
I can't do this on my own.
then I guess you go boom.
have you heard from Peter?
last time I saw my brother, he flew out of a window to get away from me.
I doubt he's going to come knocking on my door.
he flew out a window? - So to speak.
Simone, I've got people looking for him, people I can trust.
around the clock. We'll find him.
but what if you don't? You need to go public, call a press conference, tell everyone about peter's condition.
nobody's gonna believe somebody can explode and destroy a city,Simone.
I can't believe I believe it. - Let's tell them everything.
isaac painting the future, Hiro stopping time.
even you,what you all can do is incredible.
it's time people know what's happening. The truth.
Simone, look, I know your heart
it's in the right place. You want to help Peter, and I want to help him too.
but if people knew what we were capable of, they would drop a collective brick.
you think they'll burn you at the stake? - Yeah.
because that's what I would do. I'd round us all up, stick us in a lab on some island in the middle of the ocean.
where Peter saw hope, you see disaster.
I guess I'm voting for the other guy.
do not take this public.
but you kissed me. I thought you liked me.
don't remind me.
what will happen to me now?
damn it!
hope! I want my share.
Ando!
Hiro!
Ando!
Ando!
this way hurry!
Hiro. I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you.
no. This is all my fault.
I never should have...
brought you on my mission.
and if you didn't...
I would be at my desk in Tokyo.
I would never know...
what it is to be a hero.
I don't want to die!
did your powera work?
I had my eyes closed!
me too.
her gun must have misfired.
I guess...
lucky for us!
look Ando!
not a scracth on the Versa!
funny. I didn't hear your footsteps.
that's because there weren't any.
that sound.
in your heart.
what is it?
murder.
is my mom gonna be okay?
she's stable.
when your dad gets here, we can discuss options.
options?
Claire, why don't you come sit down.
your mother has a subdural hemorrhage.
I got a C-minus in biology.
Oh. It's, um...
it's like a bruise on her brain.
specifically the area that controls memory.
has your mother had any recent exposure to radiation?
a history of epilepsy?
if this is a result of domestic violence
no.
no, it's not like that.
not really.
then what's it like?
you won't believe me.
anything you say will be held in the strictest confidence.
there's a man...
who works for my dad.
he can make you forget things.
anything, just by touching you with his hands.
I'll talk to your father.
wait,
Hey,
I only came here because you said it was a matter of life and death.
you can't go blowing anything else up.
I found out what these are.
they're tracking us.
like animals!
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
the truth.
Hey! What's going on? Ted?
she's - she's a friend, okay, like us.
she's the one who put me onto the scratches.
it comes from a pneumatic needle.
it injects a radioisotope for tracking viruses in Africa.
that's what we are to them, a- a virus.
a plague.
who's them?
a shipment of needles went to Primatech Paper in Odessa,Texas.
the tracking slip went to a man named bennet.
sound familiar?
I've already been down this road. Trust me, it's a dead end.
Really? - Yeah.
why would a paper company need pneumatic needles with a radioisotope?
I had my blood tested.
it's in me, that isotope.
Ted, you're radioactive by nature.
how much you wanna bet it's in you too?
no, it's insane. No!
I want to put this whole thing behind me.
my wife and I have a baby coming, my family needs me.
if you got a family, that means you got something to protect.
there is no putting this whole thing behind you.
we gotta find out what they did and make them fix it!
if they can track us like you say they can, he'll know we're coming.
good.
I can get us through any wall they got.
I need you to get inside his head.
he can't lie to us if you're there.
we'll find out the truth.
look, I cannot do this... without you.
if we can save ourselves, we could help others.
we could be heroes!
dad.
I've convinced the doctor to let us take her home in the morning.
she'll be okay.
no thanks to you.
shut up, Claire.
Claire, can I talk to you outside?
please?
the doctor told me you had an interesting theory about your mom's condition.
it's not a theory.
you did this to her. You erased her mind.
Claire, that's ridiculous.
you tried to erase mine.
I don't know where you're getting these ideas.
stop. Stop it! Stop lying!
after what you did to mom, isn't that enough?
what you know is dangerous.
if the wrong people find out about what you can do
like the man who killed jackie? - Exactly.
Why?
why did you do this to mom?
a few days ago, that man broke into our house...
looking for you.
he found your mother instead.
so I made her forget.
your mother is a gentle soul.
and people like her shouldn't have to know about people like him.
and maybe people like you.
I never meant for her to get sick.
I only wanted to protect my family.
Claire bear,
I promise
I promise this will never happen again.
No!
you don't just get to say you're sorry and make everything go away.
Zane, are you all right?
Yeah, it's just, uh, it's just a headache.
okay. Sit tight. I'll be back.
Hello?
anybody here?
Hey, maybe we should just come back, mohinder.
Mohinder, what's the matter?
what are you doing? - Dialing 911.
do you think that's a good idea?
what are you talking about? She was murdered.
and what were we doing here?
what do you mean? We found her.
how? Why?
I mean, I look at us. Where did we come from?
how did we get here?
can we explain any of this without looking completely insane?
the top of her head was removed. It was Sylar. I don't ...I mean, how?
okay, we have to warn them.
everyo on the list.
we'll, uh, we'll leave now and we'll call the police anonymously from the road.
Zane, are you okay?
my arm still hurts a little.
you should dirve
no you always drive
take the versa back to the rental car place
what are you doing?
what I should've done weeks ago.
go home,Ando
why are you doing this?
I said I was sorry about the girl
this isn't about you
it's about me
I made a mistake by bringing you along
I have to do this alone
but you can't
it's destiny!
the comic book-- we're going to save the world!
life isn't a comic book
too many people have died since we began.
I don't know what I would do...
if I lost you too
Hiro please,Hiro.
Hey, young fella. All by yourself?
Yes, just me.
Claire. We'll get through this.
your mom needs us. Lyle too.
I don't even know if I'll remember any of this tomorrow.
all I want to do is run away, but I can't.
somebody has to protect this family from you.
Lyle, take your mother.
get out of the house right now.
dad?
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
we all do.
why'd you do it,Isaac?
how'd you get in here?
What'd they give you, money? Drugs?
what's a judas get these days?
I was trying to stop you. You're dangerous. You said it yourself.
without them to help, you'll become that.
I had help. I was learning to control it.
you scared my only chance of hope! - Stop it!
what are these marks, huh? What do they mean?
they're nothing. They mean nothing.
don't lie to me!
this is why you sent them after me.
jealousy?
with me out of the way, you'd have Simone all to yourself.
you stole her away from me!
but I did it to save New York, to stop the bomb.
I can do it right now.
with just one bullet, I can be a hero.
you're not a hero,Isaac.
you're a junkie. You couldn't even save yourself.
that's why she left you,Isaac.
it had nothing... to do...
with me!
show yourself!
no.
to be continued
ordinary people across the globe discovered the extraordinary abilities.
after seeing a nightmare future.
we must teleport back to our own time.
Hiro returned home to the present.
Claire's reunioned with her real father, didn't go as planned.
I got chance be a part of something big - you need me to leave.
I need to win!
Surech gain the new airline against the face of evil.
the best way to stop Sylar it's for us to work together.
when Sylar only grew more powerful.
this is usually the part when people start screaming.
and he eliminated the painter.
who could see the future and tonight the pieces draw closer in the final battle to save the world.
and now Heroes continued...
Hiro & Ando, New York City.
now the hard part...
why are you smiling?
it's exciting. This is our chance to change the future.
but how? How will we know what to do?
I have Mr. Isaac's book.
it's not finished.
it only has the pictures, not the words.
we could be talking about anything.
let's go ask Mr. Isaac!
he'll konw what we say!
don't worry, New York!
we will save you!
Peter Petrelli, Manhattan come on, boys.
honey, we're home.
how's my girl?
daddy! - Hey, boys, come here.
anything interesting happen while we were gone?
Nope, everything was... unbelievably ordinary.
Wait！you see what I got you guys.
what do you think it is?
Paris is cold this time of year, so here's a nice warm coat.
brown wool.
it's not flashy, but it's fashionable.
now let's talk about gloves.
I'll let you two say good-bye.
you can't leave.
I have to.
at least until the election's over.
I found you in Odessa.
we save each other, you end up being my niece.
this isn't just random, okay?！this is destiny.
my father sacrificed himself so that I could have a life, not a destiny.
you can't save me, Peter - not this time.
and Nathan can?
Nathan can keep me safe.
safe?! You can't get hurt!
you're here to save the world.
how?!
I'm sorry, I can't go around chasing some fantasy.
it's not some fantasy, okay?
I explode.
I see it.
I wipe out this whole city. You, Nathan, everyone.
you explode? - Yeah.
like a nuclear bomb.
nuclear?
like ted. - Ted?
who the hell is Ted?
Bennet Parkman, Sprague, ST. Louis, Missouri
I told you no phone calls.
it's my wife.
if we're going on a suicide mission, I'd like to call her and tell her I love her, say good-bye.
you think I don't want to talk to my wife?
that I don't miss my son and my daughter?
we're doing this to protect the people we love.
the company has a new tracking system.
now, this Walker system doesn't rely on isotopes and satellites.
it just finds you wherever you are.
so we've gotta play this smart.
switch cars, stay to the back roads.
fine, we go to New York, we wipe out the Walker system.
exactly.
Yeah, almost done.
let's go.
Sylar, manhattan that man... with the glowing hands.
he's the exploding man.
I'm going to take his power.
I'm going to explode? Is this my future?
is that what you saw, Isaac?
Hello?
Mohinder, I need your help.
I think I'm gonna do something bad.
you're a murderer. You don't get the luxury of regret.
you don't understand. I think I'm gonna kill a lot more people.
a lot more.
I understood it before - the killing.
I had a reason. To take what others didn't deserve.
it was natural selection.
what are you talking about?
an apocalypse.
a massacre.
half the city gone in an instant.
they mean nothing.
they're innocent.
there's no gain, so why would I do it?
what possible reason could I have for killing so many?
wait, listen. You don't have to.
if you're truly repentant about what you've done, turn yourself in.
I can hear you dialing 911.
it was a mistake to call.
no, wait, Sylar - Sylar!
Jessica Sanders, DL Hawkins, Las Vegas where's Micah?
a car from the Corinthian casino picked him up.
that's Linderman's casino.
what aren't you telling me?
Linderman said that he needed Micah for a job.
a job?
he's ten years old, and you let him go?!
of course not. I told him no.
what have you done? - Me? It was Linderman.
no, this is your fault! Your responsibility.
I'm done with you.
I'll get Micah my damn self.
don't let him go.
you're the one that can save Micah.
he's gonna get killed if he goes alone.
please.
wait.
Micah, Candice, New York City two-pointer for vladimir radmanovic.
everything's under control, Mr. Linderman.
he's a good kid.
not that I mind the babysitting, but don't you think this is a waste of my talent?
Thanks.
no, I appreciate that, I do.
I will.
who was on the phone?
it was Mr. Linderman.
he wanted to make sure that you were ready for tomorrow.
isn't that nice?
mom, I don't like Mr. Linderman.
well, why not?
I don't know. He smells funny.
mom, I don't like it here.
I don't want to do this.
Micah - I want to go home.
Mr. Linderman helped us, and now we have to help him.
that's the last that I want to talk about it, okay?
but, mom, I just don't - Micah, that's enough.
hey... you know that I would never let anything bad happen to you, right?
give me a smile. Okay.
Mohinder Suresh, Kirby plaza
it's good to see you again, professor.
so, have you thought about my offer?
are you ready to come to work for us?
as far as I can tell, you're all a bunch of untrustworthy gundas.
is that a no?
no, I'm not going to work for you - you're going to work for me.
you're going to show me everything you do, everything you know, and I'm going to use it to help me stop Sylar.
and why would I do that?
you raided my father's office in Chennai, planted Eden as my next door neighbor.
you want what I have - the formula.
I can find more of them. You're the one who needs me.
some people died because you led Sylar right to them.
and now you blame yourself, so you become a vigilante.
hmm, that's cute.
is that a no?
what choice do I have?
come on in.
what is this place?
there's someone you need to meet. Molly Walker.
does the name ring any bells?
Yeah, she was on my father's list. - That's right.
your father led Sylar right to her.
he slaughtered her parents, then attacked her.
how did she survive?
well, luckily, we got to her.
that's what we do.
we find people with abilities, help them, protect them.
and she's sick, isn't she?
how can you tell?
her nucleotides are decomposing. You need to get her to a doctor.
a doctor can't help her. I'm thinking maybe you can.
I'm a geneticist. I wouldn't know the first thing about this.
Molly's virus is very rare.
it's destroying her nervous system.
prevents her from accessing her ability.
there's been one other case.
an Indian girl, 1974.
my sister.
Shanti died.
Yes, we know.
sadly, your father developed a cure months too late.
unfortunately for Molly, our people can't figure out what that cure is.
cute, huh?
you're trying to manipulate me?
showing me this poor girl, preying on Shanti's memory.
Sylar is out there, and he's planning a slaughter.
everyone is in danger, and this - none of this is going to help.
you just don't get it.
Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar.
it's me.
I know it's been a while, but I've been thinking about things.
thinking about the future - my future.
I know it's last minute, but if I could just come talk to you.
can I come over?
great.
I'll see you soon.
the election is tomorrow. That's two days before the bomb.
good. Then we have time to prepare.
are you sure you are ready? For this?
a hero's journey takes him down many dark paths before returning to light.
it's just like before...He died and ...
it's happening. Just the way I saw it.
first, Mr. Isaac...Then...
the bomb?
I can hear you.
whoever you are...come on out.
quickly... before we lose him.
you...want to follow him?
why not? He's right here.
now? But the commic says that I kill him after the election you want to wait around for two days? Catch a show?
he just killed Isaac! You must do it now.
Corinthian hotel, Las Vegas.
you do that again, I will kill you.
you're lucky I didn't leave your ass stuck in the wall after what you've done.
what the hell is this place?
it's where Linderman restores his art.
he usually hangs out in here.
what's that?
is that supposed to be - Micah?
where is he?
I don't know, New York, maybe?
her fourth grade report card.
Niki's immunization records.
school photos and medical files.
he's tracked our entire life.
this finally makes sense.
no. No, this is crazy.
nobody does what you and I can do... what Micah can do - nobody.
my life.
me and Niki, everything we had, it was - it wasn't real.
it was all Linderman's science experiment.
all this time Linderman's just been playing with our lives.
what are you doing?
Linderman obviously isn't here.
we're wasting our time.
if Linderman knows this much about us, he must know something about Micah.
where he went, what he's doing.
Linderman went to New York.
some note about Petrelli on election day.
we find Linderman, we find Micah.
let's get Micah the hell out of there.
Hi, Molly.
I'm Dr. Suresh, and I need to take some blood, if that's okay.
Molly, I want to stop the man who hurt your family, and who tried to hurt you.
you can't stop the boogeyman.
he sees into your soul, and then he eats your brain.
well, you know who can stop the boogeyman?
you.
I hear you have an amazing ability.
it's not so amazing.
they ask me where people are, and I find them.
you find them?
anywhere in the world?
Yeah, I just think about them, and then I know where they are.
but it doesn't work right now.
well, that is a very special ability, Molly.
because the boogeyman, he likes to hide.
but if you can tell us where he is, we can make sure he never comes back again.
you're different from the other doctors.
you're much better at this.
Thanks.
you're telling me this guy Ted Sprague blew up your house?
Yeah, pretty much.
don't you see this, Nathan?
maybe I'm not the bomb.
maybe this guy Ted Sprague is.
maybe we can stop him.
you said you had a dream that you blew up New York city.
Yeah, I also dreamed that I could fly.
we know how that turned out for you.
you can fly?
that's cool.
the election is tomorrow.
pick up the phone, call the FBI.
we need to find him.
Nathan... trust me.
I'll make a few calls.
you've been through a lot.
you're very brave.
I just want you to know that I admire that.
Mr. Linderman, we have a problem.
Oh, thank you, lord, for bringing my Gabriel home safe.
Hi, mom.
huh?
thank you, lord.
Oh - come in, come in.
if I'd known you were coming, I would have straightened up more.
um, I brought it from texas.
it's... - for your collection.
perfect!
one more, and I have the continent.
I'm just missing Oregon.
I hear it's beautiful there.
green everywhere.
the clock's broken.
Oh, that old thing, I should have thrown it away years ago.
it was dad's.
it's junk.
it's a beautiful piece.
it just needs a little attention.
I can tell you how proud I am.
I haven't done anything.
you've traveled the world.
some of us only get to see it in snow globes.
I'm tired of traveling - I think I might stay here.
in Queens?
why would you ever come back?
if I stayed, maybe I could stop.
maybe I wouldn't have to... - what?
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.
you want tuna fish?
please don't, I'm not hungry.
well... if you insist on staying
you should call Mr. Bilger - that man from Smith & Barney.
you fixed his Rolex.
why would I call him?
because he said you should.
he said you were very talented, and very special.
maybe he could get you a job.
I have a job.
I fix watches.
that's a hobby.
investment banking is a very lucrative field.
I can't be an investment banker.
you could be anything you want.
mom, he wouldn't even remember who I am.
who could forget you?
you're not even listening to me!
I am listening.
no.
you're making a tuna sandwich.
so?
I asked you not to.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry!
mom - mom, don't.
don't, it's just... maybe I don't have to be special.
that's okay to just be a normal watchmaker.
can't you just tell me that's enough?
why would I tell you that when I know you could be so much more?
if you wanted, you could be president.
what are we doing here?
shouldn't we be looking for Ted?
the FBI and police aren't going to believe us.
they'll take Nathan seriously, though.
he can evacuate the people.
wait. - what?
what, what, what - what is it?
that man.
that's the man my father works for.
he's the one I've been running from.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
we don't know what's happening in there.
Linderman doesn't have a grasp on the situation, Thompson.
and why would you think that?
all the pundits think I'm gonna lose.
and this morning my brother tells me about a fella named Ted Sprague - ring a bell?
we know all about Sprague.
I don't appreciate being kept in the dark.
especially not today.
Oh, god, I can't believe I've been so stupid.
my father took a bullet to keep me from that man, and now he's with Nathan.
it can't be what you think.
why do you keep running back to him?
because he's my brother.
the truth is, you have no idea what's gonna happen.
you're nervous.
nervous?
you want to blow up half of New York.
Yes, we do.
you're scared.
Yeah, I am.
I'm terrified.
I have to find a nuclear man, and I don't know if I can contain all that power.
then run the other way.
I can't. - Why not?
because if we save ourselves, who's gonna save everyone else?
why are you asking me to make this sacrifice?
for the best of reasons.
you're not alone, Claire.
all right?
you coming?
No...this is crazy.
I'm getting out of here.
Micah, I'm gonna go hop in the shower.
you gonna be okay?
Hey, mom, I'm sorry that I talked back to you earlier.
I know that you just want what's best.
Thanks.
now I got you.
put them up or I'll blow you to bits!
okay, you asked for it.
take that.
who are you?
how'd you do that?
I can make you see anything I want.
makes it kind of hard to get away, huh?
Where's my mom?
look, I don't wantto hurt you.
I like you.
but if you don't listen to what Mr. Linderman says, well, I'll show you things that'll seriously mess you up for life.
so you need to behave.
okay?
what if I told you that I can be special?
important.
but to do it, I'd have to hurt a lot of people.
should I?
you? You can never hurt anyone.
there's a lot of things that I can do that you don't know about.
I have something to show you.
what are you doing?!
I know how much you love snow globes.
how - how did you...
I'm sorry, Molly.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
you can't help me either.
it's okay.
no, actually, my father did find a cure.
it's called an antibody.
unfortunately, we don't know where or what it is.
it's hiding, like the boogeyman.
exactly.
who's that?
it's my sister Shanti.
she's very pretty.
this is the first time I've ever seen her.
she died before I was born.
am I going to die?
Molly, my father did everything he could to save my sister.
he was just a few months too late.
I won't be, I promise.
what's this?
it'll protect you from the boogeyman.
thank you.
please.
I'm sorry I scared you, just come out and talk to me.
please.
mom?
he's so sad.
he's distracted. Go on. Do it.
I can't kill a man who is asking for forgiveness.
it's not the Bushido code.
everyone deserves a second chance.
no, Hiro. Not everyone.
you don't understand.
you're not ending another person's life...
future Hiro would not hesitate to chop his head off.
I'm not future Hiro! I don't want to be him!
I saw a vision of the future...
and I'm gonna kill a lot of people.
tell me why I would do that.
future Hiro killed so much, he forgot it should be hard.
mom?
mom?!
when we went to the future...
didn't you wonder where Future Ando was?
I die. Sylar kills me.
I'm leaving.
and when I get back, I expect you to be gone.
don't say that, mom. It's me--it's Gabriel.
you're not Gabriel.
you're damned, and I want you out of my house.
mom - let go!
get away from me! - Mom, calm down.
get away! - Calm down.
I want my son.
what did you do with my son? Give me back my boy.
mom, please, it's me.
it's me, mom, please... No.
my Gabriel - mom, stop it, stop it!
you're not - you're not! - Stop, stop.
you're not, you're not!
I'm sorry.
that heartbeat... you were in the loft. Why are you following me?
I must stop you. - Then do it.
do it! Kill me!
you can't, you coward.
now I'm gonna have to kill you. - No! Hiro!?
you did it. You found the cure.
where was it? - It was in me.
sometimes... when a mommy and daddy have a sick child, they have another baby.
a healthy baby with healthy antibodies.
and if we're very lucky, the healthy baby's blood will heal the sick baby.
unfortunately, I was born a little too late to help my sister.
but I'm not too late to help you.
what happened? Did you kill Sylar?
I couldn't. I failed.
I failed you. I'm sorry Ando.
you haven't failed Hiro.
we still have two days to kill Sylar and stop the bomb.
how?
the sword is broken.
you weren't even going to say good-bye?
good-bye.
I think I figured a way for you to save the world.
a gun?
that's how I save the world - that's your plan? - I can handle ted.
but if I lose it, you're the only one who can get close enough to stop me.
right through the back of the head. You know the spot.
same place you pulled the piece of glass from.
my destiny is not to shoot you. The universe cannot be that lame.
you cannot run away from who you are, Claire.
this bomb is happening. - How can you be so sure?
because I can draw the future.
I met a guy who can do it, now I can do it, you see?
someone's gonna blow.
me, Ted-- it doesn't really matter.
it's happening around the election, unless you stop it.
that's ted. You drew ted.
are you sure?
I'll never forget that face.
that's Kirby plaza, midtown.
Ted is here in New York. Don't you see, Claire? You're part of this.
but you have to do this.
thank you, Benjamin. - What are you doing here?
I didn't think I'd see you till later tonight.
a mother can't be worried about her son on the most important day of his life?
I was just working on the speech - some details of the concession.
I'm not talking about the election.
Linderman called me. He said you're getting cold feet.
it's natural to feel ambivalent. Nobody expects you to feel otherwise.
so I wanted to give you perspective.
you know about Linderman's plans? - Yes.
well, they're not just Linderman's.
a lot of people put time and care into making this a reality.
myself included. - You?
Yes, you don't know everything about me, Nathan.
but I do know everything about you.
and I know what you're capable of. - Do you think I'm a mass murderer?
important men make impossible decisions.
president truman dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end world war ii.
killed thousands to save millions.
that was different, ma, we were at war.
I can't accept this.
that is your one weakness, Nathan - you have no faith.
so how could you possibly believe this bomb could actually heal the world if you have no faith in the idea of destiny?
your destiny, Nathan, is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred.
the people will look back on what you do as the freshman congressman from New York, and they will thank you.
for your strength, for your conviction, for your faith.
in my day, we called it being presidential.
can you believe?
can you be the one we need?
that's my boy.
you were right, mom.
I am meant to be special, just like you wanted.
I can be anything.
I can even be president.
there's no sign of him.
what's wrong?
I'm not normal.
I tried to pretend that I was, and I just hurt everyone. My mom, my dad.
I ruined everything because of what I am.
I hated it.
but you...
when I met you, I finally felt like I was a part of something.
that's funny.
I felt the same thing when I met you.
dad.
dad! - Claire!
I love you, Claire bear.
what's he doing?
he's absorbing your ability.
he's gotta make it stop.
thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
we will defeat White Beard together right after we defeat his entire army.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most,
they'll have you.
we have someone else who needs us.
we would like you to bring her in.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their ability.
but we need you out there,
doing the good work that you do helping others like her.
you were with a boy.
there's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
but you promise me that you won't date.
okay.
I painted that,
but all the street signs are in French.
it could be Montreal.
Ricky!
the woman who did this to Ricky,
she was looking for me.
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
it was his choice, Peter .
my brother could be a right fool sometimes.
the woman who killed Ricky,
she was looking for me.
you saw what she could do.
I'm not gonna let you be next.
I'm gonna find her,
find out who she is, what she wants.
how are you planning on doing that?
the plane ticket, the painting.
it all points to Montreal.
it's a start.
I'm going with you.
no.
I'm not risking your life too.
we were both in that Montreal painting.
I think I'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
besides, when you find Ricky's killer,
I want to be there.
what for?
to kill the bitch.
it's our planet, let's plant a tree!
go, Costa Verde ! stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
do you realize how agonizing it is to watch you people?
it's a no on all three.
next! Are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote yes.
okay, that's one vote
for Claire .
anyone else
care to climb out on a limb with May ?
like I said.
next!
thanks for trying.
Claire, you were amazing.
really.
I don't know what Debbie's thinking.
what I'm thinking is that Costa Verde high deserves cheerleaders that are extra-ordinary.
and you, Claire , are simply not extra-ordinary.
how was that?
perfect yet again.
how much longer are we gonna do this?
it's been hours.
I want to go home.
soon, I promise.
let's take a break.
are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
where are we?
I mean, you just grabbed me off the street.
you're in Hartsdale, New York, at a privately funded company
whose sole purpose is to help you
and others like you.
others like me?
not exactly like you.
others have different gifts,
but you're the first we've met with adoptive muscle memory.
so that's what it's called.
why is this happening to me?
we're not really sure.
there are certain genetic markers,
but where they come from is still a mystery.
you have been given an extraordinary gift.
I agree.
you are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
who are you?
my name is Bob .
I'm in charge of operations.
doctor,
could I see you for a moment?
have you established a reliable baseline for Miss Dawson's ability?
Yes. She is able to replicate any action.
it's really quite extraordinary.
good.
now,
Adam Monroe,
we could determine if this stops all of that.
what is that?
a variant of the Shanti virus.
you're experimenting with the virus?
manipulating a live virus is essential for creating a vaccine, doctor.
we hope to use this virus to take away Monica's ability without harming her.
you could create an incurable strain.
it could cross over to the general population.
think how many people were killed by Gabriel Ray.
there are some abilities in this world.
Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities.
we can't just take them away from her.
it's for the greater good.
so she's a lab rat.
you're just going to inject her witht her consent.
no, Dr. Suresh, you are.
it's a mutated strain, manufactured.
if the biological structure of the virus has been altered,
I don't know if I can save her.
she could die.
you're just gonna have to take that chance.
I never agreed to experiment on people.
you brought them Molly, didn't you?
I didn't know what else to do.
all right, look.
if you refuse to do this,
they're gonna get rid of you,
and then we're gonna lose everything that we've been trying to do.
and worse yet, you're gonna lose Molly.
now you've got principles, and that's fine.
but to bring down this company,
sometimes we have to do bad things.
don't disappoint me, Suresh .
kolya? We'll be late for the party.
so handsome.
here.
let Grandma
what time will you be home?
Thress o'clock.
unless there's candy,
then I make no promises.
Ivan.
my old friend,
we need to talk.
something wrong?
I lied to my dad.
the other night when I went home,
I told him I'd joined cheerleading.
cheerleading? That is bad.
you don't understand.
cheerleading tryouts were last period.
I didn't make it.
what am I supposed to tell him?
you met this awesome guy,
and you need some free time to make out.
I told you my dad's really overprotective about the whole dating thing.
he told me I couldn't date until I was 21.
so? So I have to listen to my parents.
don't you?
Claire, I can fly.
it kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing a non-issue.
but if it's that important to you,
we'll figure out a way to get you on the team. It's impossible.
Debbie Marshall does not deem me extra-ordinary enough.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
you're a total babe, and you have a power.
by definition, you're better than she is.
Oh, you're sweet.
but it's not just her.
she's got that whole squad wrapped around her evil little pinky.
I knew girls just like her at my old school.
all it would take is one person to stand up to her.
well, be that person.
take her down a notch.
how?
you were a cheerleader.
what do they fear most?
public humiliation?
we could give her a taste of her own medicine.
your ability is fascinating.
a gift.
what I do is terrible.
I have taken many lives,
and I can't control it.
I was like you.
I could do things, amazing things.
you?
like what?
I could move objects with my mind.
I could hear a pin drop from miles away.
but then it all just went away.
that's why I need to see Dr. Suresh, to get them back.
you want to be different?
I want to be special,
an ability doesn't have to be a burden, Maya.
it can be wonderful.
stop at the next gas station.
I need to find a coyote to take us across.
what?
what about Gabriel?
I don't trust him, Maya.
I see the way he looks at you.
why he is still here?
God delivered Gabriel to us,
Alejandro,
we should put our faith in him.
is there a problem?
my brother wants to hire a coyote,
to cross the border without you.
Why?
you can't trust them.
it's okay.
we'll cross the border together.
I'm glad to have found you, Gabriel .
isaac Mendez painted a series of eight paintings,
beginning with Kaito Nakamura's death,
and ending in mine.
where are they?
sorry, I'm retired.
I work in the textile factory now.
regional manager of sales,
like you in the paper company.
cut the crap.
where are the paintings?
you think you intimidate me?
I trained you,
you and your invisible partner claude.
I taught you everything!
then you know what I'm capable of.
don't make me do this.
what is this?
you want information?
the Haitian can't help you.
my friend has a new trick.
he can reach inside that company-loving head of yours,
and one by one, blot out all the memories you hold most dear.
think about it,
a man treasured memories your give your life meaning.
your wedding in Capri.
the births of Andre and Mikhail .
it'd be a shame if they disappeared, lost forever.
start with the day he met his wife.
tell me about Katarina .
your honeymoon.
her favorite flower.
I can't remember.
Really?
after 35 years together, such a shame.
are you ready to talk,
or do we keep going?
Hi, honey.
is everything all right?
Hey, dad, yeah.
I was just wondering if I could borrow the car tonight.
did you ask your mother?
I did, and she said to ask you.
I'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later.
just thought you should know.
full disclosure and all.
well, that's very responsible of you, Claire .
take the car.
but do one thing for me.
sure.
lock the doors this time.
I will. Thanks.
is there something else?
where are you right now?
I told you. Management training in Tulsa.
and I'm late for a session.
well, I thought you had to work there a year before they'd send you.
I'm a quick learner.
I've gotta go.
I love you, Claire bear.
I love you too, dad.
what do you think?
okay.
I'm in.
your daughter Claire ?
it must be very difficult for her,
the constant fear of discovery,
especially for a teenager.
aren't you tired of running?
I'm protecting her from animals like you.
you can't hide forever.
take all his memories of me, my family, Claire, everything I ever told him.
he remembers nothing!
wait!
I'm like you.
family comes first.
maybe we can make a deal.
what kind of deal?
you were my protege,
so dedicated to the company, you made me proud.
I miss that.
I want you back.
forget it.
the company has changed.
we have new directives.
come back to us and you'll be safe, all of you.
you have my word.
what about the paintings?
you'll be told everything.
I can give you your life back.
trust me.
what is that?
a border fence, not finished yet.
that is America right there.
attention, you're in violation of U.S. Immigration!
we have notified border patrol.
all right, boys, on the way.
let's see them hands.
who are they?
they're locals, not border patrol.
they're fake police. Just drive around them.
what's... what's that for?
a cholinergic.
it's standard procedure to see if your ability improves.
uh-uh, no way. I won't do needles.
it's the last phase of your testing.
one shot, you can go home.
fine.
just make it fast.
I can't do this.
Dr. Suresh?
I won't do it.
if you don't, someone else will.
and there's more where that came from.
stop!
what are you doing?!
get someone else to do your research.
I'm taking Molly , and I'm leaving.
all right, boys, this is your last warning.
we have to go. They will shoot us.
just drive, now!
no, no, no, no, no.
let her alone.
we need to get past these men, these guns.
you can use your gift.
no.
drive.
the next time you think of that second helping of chunky monkey,
remember one thing.
the sharpie doesn't lie.
appearance matters, girls.
is this really necessary?
hell, yes.
I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.
Debbie, can I talk to you for a minute?
private function, but later.
cheerleaders only.
I'll do your biology homework for a week.
you have five minutes.
I want another chance,
another shot at tryouts.
I appreciate the effort, really.
attempting to better your social status at school is very American dream of you.
but everyone has their place in this world.
deal with it.
so you're not gonna change your mind?
you are slow, aren't you?
Claire?
Claire?!
Oh, my god.
she was right there.
her neck was twisted.
she was bleeding.
I went to see if I could help her,
and that's when he came after me.
the flying masked man?
Yes!
I escaped, thank goodness,
but Claire was dead,
right there on the steps.
I saw her. She's...
what's going on?
but I saw you.
that thing dropped you.
Debbie, calm down. I'm fine.
I don't supposed you saw a flying masked man this evening?
me? No. No.
uh, I was just hanging out with Debbie .
find anything, Ray ?
no dead bodies.
I did find this.
how much have you had to drink tonight, Miss Marshall?
we don't have much time.
the sun will rise soon.
Yaeko's father is there.
you take out the guard, we will follow.
come, my friend.
we must go back and destroy whitebeard's guns.
if you want to stop him, do it yourself.
something wrong?
I saw you, Hiro.
after I saved the swordsmith,
I came after you,
afraid something had happened to Yaeko,
because I love her.
and you, friend, betrayed me.
no. Yes. You kissed her.
it happened...
by accident.
you accidentally kissed her?
I accidentally fell in love with her,
and she with me.
I'm so sorry.
so you've been lying to me all along.
first you show me that I can be harmed by no weapon,
and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could.
she's your princess, Kensei.
I know that.
and I swear I will not give in to love.
that kiss will be our last.
but the fate of the world still rests in our hands.
we must stop whitebeard.
all right, carp.
let's go.
nicely done. For this, Takezo Kensei.
whatever you desire shall be yours.
you're covered at work and at home, an impromptu burger bonanza training seminar at corporate.
here.
what's this?
information. Phone numbers.
if you have any questions or concerns,
I want you to call us anytime, day or night.
also, here.
it's fully loaded.
anything from martial arts to plumbing,
any skill you want is at your fingertips.
support, advice, and now gifts.
you're like my own personal oprah.
you have an amazing gift.
so look around.
seems to me like this town could use a little amazing.
Thanks.
right.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
Niki?
how are you?
I'm feeling better now.
back to my old self, thanks to the company.
in fact, I'm gonna be working with them for a while.
so you're...
your new partner.
I know.
it's the last place that I expected to be,
but I owe these people so much.
Bob told me that you two were having some trust issues.
he just wants me to make sure
that there's no more misunderstandings.
that's ok. Isn't it?
what does it mean?
are you ready?
Yeah.
what is this place?
I don't know.
someone knew I was coming.
we were right about the company.
the world is in danger.
it's up to us. Adam.
the name Adam doesn't ring a bell?
no, and I don't know about any company.
I don't know about any of this.
the world is in danger.
what am I supposed to do?
we'll figure it out.
please tell me who I am, Peter, how did we...
I don't know.
we're in New York.
where is everyone?
it's an evacuation order.
june 14, 2008.
this is next year.
you've given me purpose, carp.
I'm really a hero.
and more, you've made me a better man.
well...
you wouldn't happen to have a swordsmith in there, would you?
No...This can't be!
I know. It's really unfair.
that was easy enough.
Yaeko ?! I had stopped hoping.
father! We came to save you!
I am Hiro.
and this is the great swordman Takezo Knesei.
he has come to save you.
Kensei?
I thought you were a drunk.
turns out,
I'm a hero.
Kensei! Cut my father's chains.
I cannot leave...
white Beard has built an arsenal...
thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
we will defeat White Beard together right after we defeat his entire army.
she won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
the moment you trust them with what you care about most,
they'll have you.
we have someone else who needs us.
we would like you to bring her in.
a lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their ability.
but we need you out there,
doing the good work that you do helping others like her.
you were with a boy.
there's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
but you promise me that you won't date.
okay.
I painted that,
but all the street signs are in French.
it could be Montreal.
Ricky!
the woman who did this to Ricky ,
she was looking for me.
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
it was his choice, Peter .
my brother could be a right fool sometimes.
the woman who killed Ricky ,
she was looking for me.
you saw what she could do.
I'm not gonna let you be next.
I'm gonna find her,
find out who she is, what she wants.
how are you planning on doing that?
the plane ticket, the painting.
it all points to Montreal.
it's a start.
I'm going with you.
no.
I'm not risking your life too.
we were both in that Montreal painting.
I think I'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
besides, when you find Ricky 's killer,
I want to be there.
what for?
to kill the bitch.
it's our planet, let's plant a tree!
go, Costa Verde ! stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
do you realize how agonizing it is to watch you people?
it's a no on all three.
next! Are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote yes.
okay, that's one vote for Claire.
anyone else
care to climb out on a limb with May ?
like I said,
next!
thanks for trying.
Claire, you were amazing.
really.
I don't know what Debbie's thinking.
what I'm thinking is that Costa Verde high deserves cheerleaders that are extra-ordinary.
and you, Claire , are simply not extra-ordinary.
how was that?
perfect yet again.
how much longer are we gonna do this?
it's been hours.
I want to go home.
soon, I promise.
let's take a break.
are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
where are we?
I mean, you just grabbed me off the street.
you're in Hartsdale, New York, at a privately funded company
whose sole purpose is to help you
and others like you.
others like me?
not exactly like you.
others have different gifts,
but you're the first we've met with adoptive muscle memory.
so that's what it's called.
why is this happening to me?
we're not really sure.
there are certain genetic markers,
but where they come from is still a mystery.
you have been given an extraordinary gift.
I agree.
you are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
who are you?
my name is Bob .
I'm in charge of operations.
doctor,
could I see you for a moment?
have you established a reliable baseline for Miss Dawson's ability?
Yes. She is able to replicate any action.
it's really quite extraordinary.
good.
now,
Adam Monroe
we could determine if this stops all of that.
what is that?
as Long As I Have Breath, Anything You Love, I Will Lay To Waste.
Jessica Wasn't The Strong One.
it Was You.
Adam Was Dangerous.
so We Locked Him Up, We Threw Away The Key.
two Weeks Ago, He Escapes.
and Now He Wants Revenge.
who Are You? What's Your Name?
I Don't Know.
I'm From New York.
who's That? I Wish I Knew.
someone Knew I Was Coming.
the Name Adam Doesn't Ring A Bell?
no, And I Don't Know About Any Company.
please Tell Me Who I Am.
what The Future Holds.
I Was In Montreal In 2007.
next Thing I Know, I'm Here.
all These People Died From The Virus.
you Can Change History.
I Can't. You Must!
don't Let Them Take Me!
No!
it Is Man's Ability To Remember That Sets Us Apart.
we Are The Only Species Concerned With The Past.
our Memories Give Us Voice.
they Bear Witness To History So That Others Might Learn.
so They Might Celebrate Our Triumphs.
and Be Warned Of Our Failures.
Adam. Adam-- I Don't Know Any Adam.
Peter
do You Know Me?
of Course I Know You.
Peter, It's Me, Adam.
don't You Remember?
together We're Going To Change History.
sorry, I Don't...

it's Only Been Four Months. You Barely Know Her.
I Can't Believe You Invited Him.
they Broke Up Two Years Ago. It's No Big Deal.
it Will Be When She Breaks Your Heart.
I Don't Feel Like Dancing Anymore.
you Bitch.
let Go Of Me.
you're Gonna Keep Your Mouth Shut, You Understand?
Maya, Please...
I'd Rather See You Dead Than Married To My Brother.
I Said, Let Go Of Me.

I Think I Did It?

he Could Be.
where Am I?
someplace Safe.
my Brother--I Was In A Hospital.
we Have The Finest Doctors In The World.
working On Him.
but His Situation Is Dire.
so Who Are You?
what Am I Doing Here?
I Am An Old Friend Of Your Parents'.
Yeah, I've Seen You Before.
and As I Said Before, You're Safe Here.
but Your Brother...
that's A Different Story.
he Almost Died.
because Of You, Peter.
Hey, It's Not Like It Was Your Idea
to Go Nuclear And Take Out Half Of New York City.
Oh, You Know About That?
Yes, As Long As Your Abilities Are In Control Of You, You Will Always Be A Hazard To Yourself, To Your Family,The Whole World.
believe Me, If I Could Turn Them Off, I Would.
don't Worry,
we've Done That For You.
at Least For Now.
how Did You...
my Colleague Here Is Able To Suppress The Abilities In People Around Him.
I Don't Understand.
what Is This Place?
you Are In A Facility Designed To Help People Just Like You.
Peter, We Can Help You Go Back To A Normal Life.
30 Years Ago, We Had To Shut Down Research On A Vaccine Which Could Disable Your Powers.
but Due To Recent Events,
we Have Reinstated That Research.
and I'm Very Happy To Say That We're Very Close To Finding A Cure For You.
forever?
you Will Never Have To Worry About Hurting Anyone You Love Again.
how Long Until It's Ready?

you're Making The Right Choice.
good Boy.
you Have Had A Terrible Accident.
he's Missing.

dad!
Oh, Big Guy.
I Thought I Lost You.

you're Never Getting Rid Of Me.
Mrs. Sanders...
I'll Be Right Back, Okay?
I'll Be Here.
Dr. Brooks.
um, I Wanted You To Know That We Don't Have Insurance.
but I'm Sure That We Can Come Up...
you Don't Have To Worry About That.
it's All Been Taken Care Of.
I Don't Understand.
how? Who Paid?
uh, That'd Be Me.
do I Know You?
call Me Bob.
did You Happen To See A Morning Newspaper?
what?
no, Why?
not A Mention Of What Happened Last Night On Kirby Plaza.
or The Untimely Death Of Our Friend Mr. Linderman.
who The Hell Are You?
someone Who Wants To Help.
Linderman Made A Mess Of Things
and I'm Here To Right The Ship.
so To Speak.
okay.
you've Done That By Paying Our Bills.
no, I Meant Helping You With Your Illness.
I Know You Think Jessica Is Gone.
how Do You Know About That?
but We've Discovered That When These Abilities Manifest,
the Way The Mind Deals With The New Reality Sometimes Results In A Fracture Of Sorts.
a Split Personality.
no, I'm Finished With Jessica.
how Do You Know A New Personality Won't Emerge?
I Can Get You All The Help You Need.
the Best Care In The World.
Uh-huh. What's The Catch?
the Catch Is You Have To Leave Your Family
and Enter The Program.
I Just Went Through Hell To Get My Family Back Together.
I'm Not Leaving Them Now.
there Is Medication You Can Try At Home, But...
but What?
it's Not Without Side Effects.
and As You Just Said,
you've Been Through So Much For Your Family.
do You Really Wanna Risk Losing Them All Again?
so I Just Take These Pills Every Day?
Yep.
it's A Little Cocktail They Cooked Up Here In The Lab.
it Controls The Abilities.
dampens Them.
like That Guy Who Was Standing In The Corner Of Bob's Office.
the Haitian. Yeah.
Sorta.
so Let's Just Call Them...
haitian Pills.
Bye, Peter.
Ow!
that Hurts.
you'll Get Used To It.
and Then You'll Start To Like It.
Hello?
who Said That?
me.
three Months Ago It's Micah's Birthday Today.
all Right!
11 Years Old.
almost The Man Of The House Now.
mom?
did You Make A Wish, Baby?
don't Tell Us.
beause You Know It's Not Gonna Come True.
you Both Already Know What I Wished For, Anyways.
Micah, We've Been Over This.
but I've Got It All Figured Out.
I Could Make The Car Radio Pick Up The Police Band.
we Could Go To The Crime Scene And Be Heroes.
or The Police Could Just Take Care Of It.
we Could Be Like The Fantastic Four.
minus One. But Still.
Micah, I Wanna Be A Hero To You.
and I Finally Figured Out How To Do That.
I Think I Got A Job.
a Good Job.
doing What?
something That's Gonna Make You Proud Of Me,
I Promise.
come On.
I Promised I'd Take You Bowling, Right?
let's Go.
mom, You Coming?
your Mom's Had A Long Day, Micah.
go Get Your Jacket.
all I Want Is To Smile At My Boy On His Birthday,
and I Can't Even Do That.
they Said It's Just Gonna Take A Little While For The Medication To Level Out.
I Just Don't Know How Much Longer I Can Do This.
I Wanna Say Things'll Get Better.
but I Know How That Sounds.
the Truth Is, They Will.
you Know, It's Been A Month.
you Still Haven't Told Me Your Name.
please, I Just Wanna Be Left Alone.
you Came To The Right Place.
I Have To Warn You, Though,
it Does Get A Bit Old.
let Me Guess.
you Were Living A Perfectly Ordinary Life.
until One Day You Discovered You Could Do Incredible Things.
I Bet It Was Wonderful At First.
you Thought Perhaps You Could Save The World.
and Then You Realized, Tragically, That You Were Dangerous.
I'll Let You Talk To Me After A Decade.
Oh, Actually, Talk To Me After Three.
if They Wanna Leave Me In Here Forever,
that's Fine By Me.
you've Been Through Something Awful, Haven't You?
I'm Sorry.
I'm Peter.
Hello, Peter.
it's Nice To Meet You.
I'm Adam.
two Months Ago
I'm Not In The Mood Today, Elle.
just A Little One?
I'll Up Your Dose.
I'm Fine.
just A Little One.
Oh!
not That A Fistful Of Pills Everyday Isn't Fun, But...
it's Been Two Months Now And I Still Don't Know A Thing About You.
I Was Just Thinking...
maybe There's More To You Than The Whole Sadistic Lightning Thing, That's All.
what's Your Story?
I Liked You Better When You Just Laid There.
so You're Not Gonna Tell Me?
what Are You, Afraid?
no.
you Just Like To Be In Control.
I Get It.
I Figured As Much.
sorry I Asked. Won't Happen Again.
I Accidentally Set My Grandmother's House On Fire When I Was Six.
caused A Blackout In Four Counties In Ohio When I Was Eight.
I Spent My Ninth Birthday In A Glass Room With An Iv Of Lithium In My Arm.
I've Lived In This Building For 16 Years.
ever Since The Shrinks Diagnosed Me As A Sociopath With Paranoid Delusions.
but They Were Just Out To Get Me,
because I Threatened To Kill 'Em.
I'm 24 Years Old, And I've Never Gone On A Date.
never Been On A Roller Coaster.
never Been Swimming.
and Now You Know Everything There Is To Know About Me.
I Don't Have The Luxury Of Being More Interesting Than That.
later, Alligator.
word To The Wise, Friend.
I Would Keep My Distance From That One.
I Caved In A Desperate Moment Six Years Ago,
and I'm Still Paying The Price.
don't Worry.
I Don't Want Anything From Her Except The Drugs.
I'm Sorry, I Keep Forgetting.
you Still Believe Them.
what Do You Mean?
this Cure Of Theirs.
they've Been Days Away From Perfecting It Since I Got Here 30 Years Ago.
Bob's Not Trying To Fix You, Peter.
no.
they Created This Facility To Help Us.
you're Not In A Facility, Peter.
look Around.
you're In A Prison.
you Don't Believe Me?
why Don't You Try Getting Out?
two Months Ago
Oh, I'm Sorry.
are You All Right?
he Said It Was All A Lie.
what Happened To Him, And To Peter, And The Car Crash.
I Take It He Told You He Thought He Could Fly.
and The Plot To Blow Up New York.
that Peter Was A Bomb.
it Must Be The Pain Medication.
you Deserve To Know This.
I Tried To Keep It From You And The Boys.
what?
there's A Dark Secret In The Petrelli Family.
it Started With Their Father.
delusions Of Grandeur,
paranoia.
it Lead To His Suicide.
but Sadly...
that Disease Has Obviously Been Passed Down.
my God.
now...
Nathan's A Great Man.
and His Life Is Gonna Be Very Complicated.
he Really Deserves His Dignity And His...
so I Hope You Understand That This Has To Be Kept Secret.
Hi, What Can I Do To Get You Inside A
Hi, Hi.
what Can I Do To Get You Into A Brand New Car?
Hi, What Can I Do...
depends On What You're Gonna Do To Me Once You Get Me Inside.
I Got A Great Feeling About Your First Day.
my Butterflies Have Butterflies.
Nik, I Am So Proud Of You.
I Knew That Medication Would Work Out.
you Were Right.
I'm Gonna Take Micah To School.
okay.
you Have A Great Day At Work.
and When I Get Home Tonight,
we're Gonna Celebrate.
he's Gonna Know You're Not Taking The Stupid Pills.
go Away, Jessica.
I Don't Need You Anymore.
what Makes You Think This Is Jessica?
remember Me?
that Summer That You Ran Away To L.A. And Told Everyone To Call You Gina?
you're Not Real.
Oh, You're Gonna Sell Cars?
I'm Going Back To L.A. To Go Play.
no, I'm In Control.
if I Can Handle Jessica, I Can Handle You.
then Why Aren't You Taking Your Meds?
No!
No! No!
No!
look, I Need To See My Family.
just For A Day Or Two.
Yes, I-I Think That Would Be Absolutely Possible.
just Not Right Now.
why Not?
they Don't Even Know I'm Alive.
look, I Could Let You Go, And You Could Explode Again.
you Could Blow Up Half The East Coast.
okay, So Dose Me With Some Drugs
and I'll Be Back Before They Wear Off.
it's Perfectly Safe.
I'm Sorry, Peter.
you're Just Not Ready For That Yet.
okay, So Send Someone Out With Me.
Elle, Maybe.
uh, No.
no, No, I'm Sorry, Peter.
um, That's Just Not Gonna Happen.
I'm Never Getting Out Of Here, Am I?
suddenly The Room Starts To Feel Like A Cage.
I Don't Understand.
if They're Not Gonna Help Us, Why Are We Here?
to Keep Us From Being Out There.
why, Because We're Dangerous?
no, Peter, It's Because We Could Save The World.
years Ago, I Tried To Take My Abilities Public.
I Thought That If Everyone Knew That My Blood Had Curing Powers,
I Could Help.
how Naive I Was.
that's Why They Put You In Here.
well, If It Were Possible To Kill Me,
they Would Have, I Assure You.
instead, I'm Locked Up In Here.
when I Could Be Curing Your Brother.
Nathan. How?
just A Small Amount Of My Blood Could Help To Heal Him.
end His Pain.
even After Everything You've Put Him Through.
so How Do We Get Out?
my Daughter Is Still In There!
please!
please!
Hawkins, Get Out Of There!
please!
mommy!
mommy!
mommy!
mommy! Mommy!
thank You!
Yeah, Good One, D.L.

I Don't Think She's Gotten Home From Work Yet.

you've Held Up Pretty Well.
come On, Let's Go Heal Your Brother.
I Knew I Couldn't Hide Forever.
it's Time To Come Home, Maya.
everyone Has Been Looking For Answers...
why You Did It. How?
no One Can Figure Out How You Poisoned Them All.
that's Because I Didn't.
it's Something Evil Inside Me.
something I Can't Control.
you Told Me You Killed Them.
you're Saying Now It Was An Accident?
think About It.
you Didn't Die. Of All Of Them, You Were The Only One!
it Has Something To Do With Us.
that Doesn't Make Any Sense...
but I Still Want To Help You.
it's Over Maya.
no.
it's For The Best, Maya.
no.
please.
you Can't Do This... You Don't Understand, I'm Dangerous.
Oh God, No...
Maya, Please...
I'm Sorry...
Maya, Please, Stop! Whatever You're Doing, Stop!
I'm Sorry...

I Told You, You Ain't Getting Rid Of Me.
I Love You, Baby.
not As Much As I Love You.
Hey,
man, Let It Go.
we're Leaving, All Right?
three Weeks Ago
can I Play With It?
Damon, Come On. Why Would You Ask Him That?
don't Be So Silly.
you're Gonna Be All Right, Aren't You, Sugar?
I Don't Know.
I Think I Need To Get Some Help.
anything You Want, You Just Gotta Ask.
you Know That, Don't You?
thank You.
I've Taken Care Of Everything.
plane Tickets, Money.
now This.
I'm So Sorry, Nathan.
how Long Until It Starts Working?
we Don't Have Time To Find Out.
they're Going To Assume That You'll Come To See Your Brother.
this Is The First Place They'll Look.
come On.
Adam, Look, Look, Look!
good.
come On.
come On.
that Was Incredible.
his Skin Was Starting To Heal Right There In Front Of Us.
he'll Be As Good As New By The Time He Wakes Up.
here, Passport. Plane Ticket.
here's The Plan.
you Disappointed Me, Peter!
and Just When I Thought We Were Getting To Know Each Other.
there's A Warehouse In Montreal.
121 Rue Saint-Jacques.
meet There.
go After Him!
you Take Me Back There,
I'm Just Goep Escape.
I'm Not Taking You Back.
you Deserve Fate.
your Mother Helped Me When I Was In Need.
so Now You're Helping Me?
you Must Start A New Life, Peter.
I Fear This Is Thonly Solution.
your Secret Is Safe With Me.
go With God, My Friend.
there Are Many Ways To Define Fragile Existence.
many Ways To Give It Meaning.
but It Is Our Memories That Shape Its Purpose And Give It Context.
today
the Private Assortment Of Images, Fears, Loves, Regrets.
thank You.
for It Is The Cruel Irony Of Life That We Are Destined To Hold The Dark With The Light,
the Good With The Evil.
success With Disappointment.
this Is What Separates Us,
what Makes Us Human.
and In The End, We Must Fight To Hold On To.
I Remember.
I Remember Everything.
good, Then.
shall We Save The World?
Kensei Takezo.
when I get back, we'll be together.
you came here to get control of your life.
it's another strain of the virus.
my blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
Claire is the key that could cure the virus.
and he has asked you to give us Claire.
you touch my daughter and I'll kill yours.
then I'll kill you.
please don't let them take me.
I'll get us home, I promise--no, no!
Peter.
I remember everything.
see, when I get my ability back,
I'm gonna kill you and your sister.
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
no need to shout.
Adam, I was there. I saw her.
you haven't gone anywhere, Peter.
you were telling me about time travel.
and how you were going to save some girl from some deadly virus,
and then you began shouting her name.
no, no, I was in New York city a year from now.
I saw Caitlin.
I was calling at her to come back with me.
look.
I have to keep trying.
I can't just leave her there to killed by the virus.
what do you know about this virus?
I know that it kills over 93% of the world's population.
Peter, do you know what the virus is called?
Shanti virus.
that's what the guy at homeland security called it.
does that mean something to you?
I knew a woman at the company.
victoria Pratt.
she was a biological engineer.
on Valentine's Day 1977, she recovered a deadly virus from a sick Indian girl named Shanti.
under company orders,
she tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon.
I'd heard the program had been shut down.
clearly I was misinformed.
those are my parents.
Linderman, Charles Deveaux.
those are the company founders, Peter.
the virus is their crime.
they're responsible for this.
parents sin, children suffer.
that is Victoria.
we need to find her, Adam.
we need to find her.
make her tell us everything that she knows.
that's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin.
it's the only way we can save the world.
get the hell out of my house.
Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company,
and for many years a true friend.
I offer my deepest condolences.
are those my dad's ashes?
you had my husband cremated?
Yes, his personnel file was very clear.
what gives you the shit right?
we were only trying to help Claire
use her abilities for the greater good.
but Noah's aggression forced our hand.
he was trying to protect me.
in the wake of this tragedy,
I feel it's only fair to honor Noah's wishes.
you will be left alone to lead a normal life.
my father is dead.
there is no normal.
I'm sorry for your loss.
pack your bags. We're leaving tonight.
the next 24 hours are critical.
I want you to keep an eye on Claire.
it'd be easier without this thing on my arm.
it itches like a mother!
and I thought my little girl was tough.
I am, dad, but I was shot.
and my body doesn't heal itself.
I'm sorry you're in pain,
but none of this would've happened if you hadn't lowered your guard.
how was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up with West, the flying boy?
excuses don't change outcome, Elle.
you need to accept responsibility for what's happened.
can you do that?
can you regain my trust?
sure, daddy.
I'll watch the cheerleader.
Mohinder.
take it easy.
last thing I remember...
you were...
did you shoot me?
I didn't have a choice.
why am I not dead?
you would have been, if you not for an infusion of your daughter's blood.
you took Claire's blood?
it saved your life.
you betrayed me. You went after my family!
you told me this company had to be brought down，from the inside out.
thank god I came to my senses before I'd done any real damage.
what have you done with Claire?
Claire's at home,
grieving the loss of her father.
they think I'm dead.
you put us on this path.
with your violence, your paranoia.
you have nobody to blame but yourself.
what are you doing with that?
your recovery has proven.
this blood has tremendous regenerative properties.
I believe it holds the key to saving an innocent woman from a deadly virus.
that's what this company does.
we save lives.
everything they've told you is a lie.
the company made that virus.
they've been experimenting with it for 30 years.
you can't trust them, Suresh!
get back here, you son of a bitch!
600 bucks for a comic book?
in mint condition.
but that's not why I collect them.
I just like the stories.
how about this for a story?
once upon a time, we cash these in.
and live happily ever after, the end.
Hey, if St. Joan's a good guy,
why is she wearing a hood?
well, every superhero has to have a secret identity.
how else could they live a normal life?
who wants normal?
Pssh, I'd be rolling large.
let everybody know who I was.
but if your enemies knew who you really were,
then they'd be coming after you at home,
maybe even taking revenge on your family.
that's why Clark Kent wears those glasses.
right.
Micah?
mom, you came back!
I told you that I would.
I missed you every day.
Oh, I missed you every minute, every second.
what's that even smaller one?
a nanosecond.
I missed you that one too.
so where were you, mom?
I went to a place that helps people like us, when we're sick.
is it Jessica again?
no, Jessica's gone. They all are.
this is about something else.
what is it?
I have a virus.
you don't have to worry.
I can't make you or anybody else sick.
what's gonna happen to you?
do you remember Dr. Suresh?
he is working really hard to find me a cure.
and when he do, I'll get better.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
he will.
I am going to get better, Micah.
we are going to have normal life.
I promise you.
I've got something to make you stronger.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
dad's medal.
the one that the mayogave him for saving that girl from the fire.
it's in my backpack.
we can't waste another nanosecond.
what's wrong, bud?
it's my backpack. It's gone.
it's beautiful here, Gabriel.
thank you.
I almost feel normal.
after you see Dr. Suresh, you will be.
and then Alejandro and I can go back home.
what if Alejandro could go home now?
but I need my brother.
he's the only one who can stop me from hurting anyone else.
what if you could learn...
to control your own power?
I've seen people's powers grow.
do you love your brother enough to let him go?
of course.
it's...
it's just not possible.
well, you'll never know...
unless you try.
we should get back.
you put him through enough, Maya.
me?
he gave up his entire life for you
even after you killed his wife.
it was an accident.
you really think he's forgiven you?
she was cheating on him.
so she deserved to die?
that's not what I meant. It's just.
but you wanted to kill her, didn't you, Maya?
stop it. let me go.
where? Back to your brother?
he hates you.
if you can control your power,
no more innocent people have to die.
Ahh! I can't!
help. You're killing me.
Help...please.
you were right.
I did it.
I don't think we should go in there guns blazing.
let's just tell Victoria the truth.
ask her straight out where to find the virus.
this woman can't be trusted, Peter.
she worked for the company. She locked me up.
one glance at me on her garden path is liable to affect her mood.
fine. I'll go alone.
no.
you lost?
hope not.
I'm looking for victoria Pratt.
never heard of her.
you worked for the company.
in 24 hours, the Shanti virus is released.
a year from now, 93% of the world's population is dead.
how can anyone know what happens a year from now?
I've been there.
I've seen it.
a time traveler.
you created a virus that kills billons of people.
I don't know how it gets out or where,
only that it does.
unless you help me.
Inside...now.
containment breach in bio-research.
evacuation protocol in full effect.
you have betrayed everything we stand for.
no, Kaito, I tried to save the world.
by releasing a virus that could kill billons of innocent people?
when you're been around as long as I have,
the patterns become clear.
constant war. Disregard for the environment.
famine. And it's only getting worse.
someone had to make the hard choice for the greater good.
take him down to lockup.
and throw away the key!
are you all right, Victoria?
he was looking for Strain 138.
if he'd been successful,
this place would've been ground zero for a global pandemic.
thank you for saving us.
you need to shut down the program, Kaito.
give it to me.
this will be taken to the primatech facility in Odessa.
with Adam locked away, it will be safe.
look, with something that dangerous,
there is no safe.
that virus needs to be destroyed.
the other founders would never allow that.
doesn't that concern you?
Adam had help, Kaito.
it's the only way he would have known what to look for.
I suggest you take a few days off before resuming your work.
I won't be a part of this. Not anymore.
after Kaito and the others were killed,
I figured that sooner or later,
someone would come after me.
you look like your mother.
I don't know anything about this.
the last time I saw my mother was a year from now,
in a future where the world had already been devastated by the Shanti virus.
forgive my paranoia, but I don't know you.
I only knew your parents and what they were capable of.
there was a woman.
Caitlin.
she trusted me to protect her.
now...
somehow I took us into the future,
and now I can't get back.
so if you just tell me where to find the virus,
I know that I can save her.
you're looking for a mutated strain.
if it were ever released,
it would kill us all.
she tell you where to find the virus?
company storage facility in New Mexico.
new Mexico?
company never had a facility...
wait, you don't understand.
no, you're working with him now.
that's all I need to know.
I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure.
better late than never.
Thanks, Peter.
let's get her up to the house.
Alejandro!
Maya?
did you tell your brother the good news?
is something wrong?
this...
says you murdered your mother.
but I know you didn't. You couldn't.
it's me.
I did it.
I killed her.
when my mother found out what I could do,
she didn't understand.
she told me I was a monster.
my own mother tried to kill me, Maya.
and as I defended myself,
there was an accident.
I understand.
everything's gonna be okay, Maya.
I'll take care of you.
why did you lie to me, Victoria?
you're with him.
you're helping Adam release the virus.
release the virus?
I'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it.
30 years ago, Adam broke into my lab.
I stopped him from releasing the virus
so he couldn't kill everyone.
and now he's trying to do it again.
I broke into the lab to prevent you and company for putting the world in danger.
you killed Kaito, didn't you?
and the others. And now it's my turn.
we're trying save lives, Victoria, not take them.
Adam's a killer.
and I guess since you're helping him, you're one too.
just like your parents.
Adam helped me escape the company.
he saved my brother's life.
but what you did, what you were a part of,
that will bring an end to the world.
tell me where I can find the virus so I can stop it.
go to hell.
where is it, Victoria?
primatech paper, Odessa, Texas.
Texas. -No!
thank you.
I am not gonna let you do this!
get away from me!
we're not hurting you. We're letting you go.
what are you doing?
wait!
you didn't have to kill her.
she was about to take your head off.
there's no coming back from that one.
I'm gonna get the car.
if anyone survives,
I'll tell them...
I couldn't have done it without you.
well?
there was this kid on third street.
who said he can tell me how much your comics were worth.
I figured if you knew how much we'd get then maybe...
where are they? Where's my backpack?
it was a setup. I got jacked
Micah! Damon!
my dad's medal was in that bag!
I'm sorry! I'll get you a new one!
you gonna get me a new dad, too?
I'm sorry.
I don't care! I hate you!
we're gonna get you all cleaned up.
and then I'm gonna call the police,
and you're gonna tell them everything that happened.
come on.
we need to get it back.
Nana's calling the police.
I'm not talking about the police.
I'm talking about us. We could get it back.
we have talked about this.
we need to be heroes. Like dad.
being a hero is what got your father killed.
you all packed, Maya?
I tried to let you go the easy way.
but you had to be persistent.
I'm taking my sister.
Gabriel.
Gabriel!
I didn't hear you with the water running.
is everything okay?
I have to talk to you.
yeah?
you were right.
about everything.
about me. About Alejandro.
I never meant to come between you two.
he's my brother.
I have to do what I can to protect him.
in time, he will understand.
of course he will.
and without you,
I would still be somewhere in Mexico.
I just want to help you.
you have done that.
your mom said you're leaving tonight.
I've fallen 20 stories.
been stabbed in the head.
crashed a car at 70 miles an hour.
I've even been on fire.
but this hurts...
more than any of that.
and it's not getting better.
I've always gotten better no matter what.
but this just keeps getting worse.
I can't stand to see you hurt like this.
I won't be. Not for long.
there's a man who used to work with my dad.
he has the ability to erase people's memories.
these are a signal.
so that he knows to come.
are you gonna hang those in the window?
how do you know he's gonna see them?
I don't know, but I have to do something.
you don't want to forget your dad.
forgetting isn't the answer.
Micah.
why are you dressed like that?
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.
to wish that you had a piece of them,
something solid to hold onto.
anybody tried to steal my mom's piano,
I'd feed 'em their teeth.
look.
I know where those kids live, the ones who stole your backpack.
you're gonna help me get back my dad's medal?
long as you stay out of the way.
anything crazy happens, I need you safe.
okay, I promise.
shh, we still gotta sneak you out.
come on.
it's as we'd hoped.
Claire's blood has fortified my antibodies.
they're strong enough to defeat the mutated virus now.
congratulations, doctor.
you promised Niki Sanders you'd find a cure.
and you have.
and you promised me
this company's viral research would end.
in working up this cure, I've been pouring over records
that reveal the full extent of your program.
and you of all people should understand.
what it would mean to find a safe way.
to remove the abilities of dangerous individuals.
here, Strain 138.
if even the smallest amount were released,
it would wipe out all of human civilization.
this strain is locked safely away in our facility in Texas.
and I can assure you, doctor,
this company is vigilant about security.
Really?
for weeks I operated as a spy
within your ranks undetected.
God knows what someone with experience
and ill intent could achieve.
what can I do for you?
help me hunt down every strain of virus within this company and destroy them.
hello.
Niki? It's Mohinder Suresh.
are you still in New Orleans?
Yes.
I think I found the cure, Niki.
I'll bring to you on the next flight.
you're nightmare's over.
I don't know what to say, doctor.
thank you.
Micah.
there's no one home.
you should have plenty of time.
you know how to get up there yet?
almost.
got it.
I just wish it wasn't so bright.
I don't want people thinking I'm robbing the place.
okay.
how did you do that?
I told the lights I need them to be off for a while.
you told 'em.
Yeah.
what?
you're St. Joan!
you really have to stop reading those comic books.
stay here.
I'm sorry, dad.
I'm sorry I didn't listen.
I should've done everything you told me to.
if I hadn't been so selfish, you'd still be here.
you'd better say good-bye.
we gotta be in salt lake by morning.
come on.
this is all happening so fast.
Claire!
what the hell are you doing here?
I came to watch the sunset.
liar! Ugh!
watch who you're shoving, pompom.
Claire, don't.
this isn't fair.
welcome to life.
come on, Claire, we've gotta go.
no, mom, we don't.
we can tell the world what they did.
how they kidnapped me and murdered my father.
you have no proof. No one would believe you.
you're probably right.
I guess I'm just gonna have to show 'em.
I'll show everyone exactly what I can do.
once the secret's out,
you wot be able to touch me or my family.
you'll be the ones running.
hello.
Hello, Mohinder.
Sylar?
where are you?
I convinced the babysitter to take the night off.
don't worry.
I'm taking good care of the little one.
if you touch Molly.
we won't want to wake her.
I brought someone to see you.
she needs your help.
we both do
see you soon, Mohinder.
this doesn't look like the sort of place
where they'd store a virus that could destroy the world.
paper company's just a front.
the good stuff is three floors down.
laboratories, jail cells
Hiro?
Peter Petrelli?
what are you doing here?
Adam Monroe killed my father, and for that he must pay.
I can't let you do that.
then you have chosen the wrong side.
No!
you're going to die! Here! Tonight!
this is my fate then.
I can't save him.
but I can learn who killed him
Takezo Kensei.
I don't trust him, Maya.
we should put our faith on him.
evacuation Notice June 14th 2008.
don't do this.
my father looked good in a suit.
I must find Takezo Kensei...
and avenge my father.
are any of these Kensei? No.
but you're sure he did it?
I saw him on the roof of the Deveaux building.
just before he pushed my father off.
you said Kensei died in White Beard's camp.
even if he didn't...
how could anyone still be alive after 400 years?
Kensei could heal from any wound.
maybe he could survive time as well.
you mean he could live forever?
if he did...
he would leave a trail.
ando, be more careful.
you are like...
a hamster making a nest.
Takezo Kensei and my father.
Kensei was calling himself Adam Monroe.
Adam Monroe.
I saw that name.
from November 2, 1977.
it's a singed order to lock up Adam Monroe. Signed by my father.
this is it, Ando!
I must go back to this day.
but, Hiro.
you said you would never again travel in time.
that you wouldn't risk changing history.
the memo came from Primatech Research in Hartsdale, New York.
I must do this.
not again.
I can control my power!
on my own!
it's all thanks to Gabriel
what did Gabriel do?
he showed me what I am capable of.
isn't.
this wonderful news?
Maya.
I looked up Gabriel Gray on the computer in the office.
he is a murderer.
the police say he killed his own mother.
I don't believe it.
it's not true.
we need to leave before...
I know what you are!
he admits it?
what are you doing, Maya? Get away from him.
he's a murderer!
I am a murderer!
Gabriel understands exactly what I'm going throught exactly how I feel.
we're leaving...now!
Alejandro no!
I'm staying with Gabriel.
we will go see Doctor Suresh without you.
I can control my own ability now.
I am not leaving you alone with him.
I know you hate me.
I killed the woman you loved.
that wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was.
in my heart, I wanted her dead.
medals gone, I am sorry.
you're not taking my sister with you.
and some much more.
I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am.
who cares?
as long as he come with that cash.
I love you, dad.
I'm losing everything I care about.
ando, wake up.
Hiro! You're back!
I know what Adam wants!
what is it?
a virus.
at a place called Primatech.
it's in Texas, Ando! Back in Odessa!
where we tried to save the cheerleader?
Yes!
Adam wants to release this virus!
if I don't stop him, they'll die!
who?
everyone!
but Adam is invincible.
how can you stop a man like that?
I must try.
I must avenge my father's death...
and save the world.
why is saving the world always your reponsibility?
I can't let you hurt him.
>> Give me one good reason why I shouldn't tear open your head right here >> Because you'll never find your dad.
>> We need to show progress.
these are our targets.
hunt them, track them, and bring them home alive.
>> If you kill me, i'll get exactly what i want.
>> And what is that?
>> They'll see what i've been telling them.
they'll know just how dangerous you people are.
>> Daphne's alive, matt. They have her, alive.
>> You're lying to me! >> No, no, no, no, no.
I won't fight you.
your mother wants me to move out of the house for a while.
she's right.
we keep too many secrets in this family.
>> They're just locking people up?
>> Believe it, it's happening.
somebody sent me to warn you.
you must be on a list or something.
>> I can breathe underwater.
>> You're in danger.
you need to get out of here immediately.
chapter five exposed >> We're out of whole wheat. Sorry.
>> Whatever. I'm starving.
>> Well, my mom's going to the market soon,
so hopefully she'll take lyle.
you can come downstairs, stretch your legs a bit.
>> Well, that's a good thing. I'm starting to stink.
>> Look i've got the cash.
there's a train leaving for Albuquerque tonight.
>> Albuquerque?
I don't know anyone in Albuquerque.
>> Well, that's the point.
you could start over, become a new person...
where no one could find you.
>> Yeah, but i never agreed to that.
my family's here, my friends. My life.
>> Do you want them to find you?
make you disappear forever?
>> They're gonna find me anyways.
the government has those spy satellites.
they're probably watching us right now.
>> No. No, we're fine.
>> Yeah, but you don't know that.
you're not Harriet Tubman, Claire, all right?
and this isn't the underground railroad.
you're just a high school girl,
and you're in way over your head.
>> Well, if it wasn't for this high school girl,
you might already be dead.
so you want to survive, you're gonna have to do
exactly what i tell you- Got it?
>> Claire?
I need to speak with you. [Dog growling]
Claire...
>> Hey, mom. What's up?
>> Our house money's gone.
you know, the money i keep in mr. Muggle's rubber sneaker.
any idea where that went?
>> Maybe lyle took it.
>> I already grilled him.
per usual, he has no clue.
>> Okay, fine, i took it.
I was was gonna pay you back.
>> Claire, i don't get it.
you have a nice allowance. [Barking]
what do you need $300 for?
are you in some kind of trouble?
>> No, i just...
>> What is it, muggles?
what's under the bed, boy? What is it?
what is going on with you, claire?
>> Nothing. Nothing, i swear.
I didn't hear anything.
>> Miss bennet, right?
Hi.
>> Home sweet home.
>> Not anymore.
got a one-Bedroom in dupont circle.
>> You don't mind that we're keeping an eye on your daughter,
making sure she's behaving herself?
>> Claire's a big girl. She makes her own decisions.
if she does something wrong,
she can live with the consequences.
>> Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
Peter petrelli has joined Matt parkman as priority one.
charged with kidnapping, assault,
and attempted murder of federal officers.
both of these men are considered armed and dangerous,
and should be taken down by any means necessary.
>> Short of lethal force.
>> Actually, senator, my men have been given the go ahead
shoot to kill.
on whose authority, danko?
>> Mine.
back to work.
>> Do you really want to push my hand?
>> Your brother came into my house,
put a gun to my head.
>> I saved your life, if i remember.
>> You made this personal.
now i do what i need to do.
>> Keep an eye on him for me, will you?
>> Matt and peter kidnapped me and threatened my life.
what makes you think i won't shoot them myself?
>> Sir, we have a lead.
Manhattan.
>> Matt.
>> Uhh! >> Matt!
Matt. >> Uhh.
>> Matt, you need to stop.
Matt...
Matt, you need to stop!
stop. Stop. >> What happened?
>> Look, you've been painting the same image
over and over again all night, okay.
I'm guessing you're trying to find some answers
how to stop this.
>> Oh, god.
>> Look, we need to leave, okay?
it's too dangerous here. We gotta go now.
>> No!
the only thing that matters right now is finding Daphne
and getting her back.
one life at a time.
>> Okay.
look, matt, when you were in bennet's head,
could you see-Could you tell where daphne was?
anything?
>> I don't know. I don't know.
I mean i didn't see much. I saw a hallway.
>> Okay. [Machine beeps]
>> Did you turn that on?
>> No.
who the hell is rebel?
>> I have no idea.
>> Address... >> daphne!
someone's listening to our conversation.
>> No, no, no. He's just hacking in.
this could be information.
we need this information!
>> We don't know who this is.
how can we trust this person, huh?
what if this is a setup?
>> And what if he's telling the truth?
>> Go! Go, go, go!
>> They're gone.
we just missed 'em.
I think i know where they're headed.
>> Mom, this is Alex.
he's, uh...
he's my new boyfriend.
>> Okay, that doesn't explain why he's hiding in your closet.
>> Right.
Well...we're...
you're really gonna make me say it out loud?
>> Absolutely.
>> We're having sex. And i know it's wrong.
very, very wrong.
>> You do understand that my daughter is only 17.
>> I haven't touched her. Okay?
I barely even make eye contact.
>> Claire...
the truth.
>> He's like me.
he has an ability.
you can tell her.
>> I can breathe underwater.
>> He has a power?
and you brought him here?!
>> Dad was after him. I didn't know what else to do.
>> Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?
>> Yes, i do, but what was i supposed to do, just let him
>> And on top of that you lied to me!
I am so disappointed.
>> The agent still there?
>> Pretty sure you lost him when you skidded off
onto the dirt road.
but just to be sure...
Yep, we're clear, officially, off the grid.
no communications within 50 miles.
>> You sound disappointed.
>> Maybe i am.
I mean, the way i see it, agents catch up with us,
we just pwwsshhh
Charbroil 'em from the inside out.
>> I don't want to leave the trail of dead bodies
directly to my father's house.
>> Why are you doing this?
parents suck.
you never get what you want from them.
when i was a kid, i just wanted my dad to take me fishing.
he used my arm as an ashtray instead.
seriously, look. I have the scars to prove it.
>> You should have worn a seat belt.
>> Dude, you're hurting me.
>> Why don't you want me to see my father?
>> I just- I don't get it.
>> You don't need to get anything.
my father's the only one with answers.
>> You're the most powerful dude on the planet.
I mean, what could you possibly need?
we don't need anyone. What?
Hey, what are you doing?
what the hell?!
if you're hungry, there's a burger place up the road.
>> I'm sorry i lied to you.
I should have told you about alex.
>> What you're doing is extremely dangerous, claire.
do you understand that?
>> They were gonna lock him up for no reason.
>> And they'll do the same thing to you.
this is not a game.
>> Mom, i have to do this.
I know that it's hard for you.
you want a normal life, a regular family.
but that's why dad and i have to lie.
so we can protect you.
>> Why?!
because i'm some fragile creature in need of protection?
>> No, that's not what i meant.
>> I know what you meant, and i've got news for you.
I'm strong.
much stronger than either you or your father think.
and i know more than you think i know.
for example, i know that right now,
there's a van parked outside on the street.
they're watching us. They're watching you.
>> You think she's hiding the woolsley kid?
>> Absolutely.
I'm telling you she's helping him.
>> Those pool cleaners have been parked out there for four hours.
nobody's pool is that dirty.
>> This is bad.
>> How you gonna save alex, claire?
you can't go out there.
you gonna keep him up in your closet forever?
>> No. No, i'll come up with something.
I have a plan.
I just haven't thought of it yet.
>> I have an idea.
>> You do?
>> Yeah.
and you can either keep me in the dark,
and lie to protect me,
or you can let me help.
>> I say we definitely let her help.
>> All right, mom... what's the plan?
>> We're not gonna have a lot of time.
get in there, you do your mind-Control magic,
and then we get daphne and we're out.
>> It's impossible. I mean, look at this building.
it's gotta be jam packed full of people.
there are only so many minds i can control
at any given time.
>> You're right. You're right.
>> What are you doing? What is that?
>> I just borrowed your power.
>> Great!
>> That way we can watch each other's backs.
>> And you can't fly now.
which basically rules out our rooftop escape plan.
>> See, we gotta get into the building first.
and two guys pushing thoughts is better than one.
come on.
>> Top floor.
>> I love doing that.
>> Right? Makes it a lot easier.
>> They got cameras everywhere. Let's go.
in here. Come on.
>> Hey, you're not allowed in here.
>> You're gonna finish your lunch in the hall
and make sure no one comes in.
>> I'll just finish my lunch in the hall.
>> The plan was to find daphne.
>> Gotta know where to look, huh?
>> Sir, take a look at this.
>> Okay, this is a problem.
how the hell did they get in here?
>> Targets are in operations.
shut down the computer systems, everything.
>> Can't. Someone's hacking in.
>> Damn it, just shut it down! Let's go!
>> Wait. >> Hell with that.
>> I wouldn't go out there if i were you.
>> You're not me.
son of a bitch.
>> What? >> How'd you do on your history exam?
>> C-Minus.
>> Right. You're grounded.
drivers license, please. Now.
thank you.
>> That was harsh.
>> He's a terrible driver anyway.
>> To disappear, you need a new identity.
trick is to remove the photo
without tearing it.
[Blows] there.
>> [Chuckles] i cannot believe you know how to make a fake i. D.
where did you learn that?
dad? >> No.
Claire, believe it or not, i was a teenager once.
and an enterprising one, not unlike you, young lady.
Oh, there was this band once i just had to see.
def leopard. Oh, my god, rick savage.
bass player. So cute!
Oh, what i would have given to
>> Mom! >> Sorry.
Alex, you need to change your looks.
probably using facial recognition algorithms.
that i learned from your father.
you can find a change of clothes upstairs.
>> I appreciate everything that you're doing.
you know i didn't mean to drag you into all of this.
>> You were gonna do it one way or another, claire.
just thought i might help.
>> I'm sorry for being the way i am.
making everything so much harder.
sometimes i just wish i was normal.
>> Why on earth would you want that?
>> It would just make everything easier.
maybe you and dad would still be together.
>> Honey, your father and i had issues
long before you came around.
>> Why'd you marry him?
>> 'Cause i fell in love with him, warts and all.
he was dangerous, handsome.
I accepted everything that went with that.
but now...
I'm tired of being lied to.
I can't see my marriage anymore.
>> So it's...over.
you guys are gonna get a divorce.
>> I don't know.
maybe.
but whatever happens between your father and i
has nothing to do with you.
okay?
>> [Whispering] so what are we looking for?
>> Something happened here.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
>> I've been here before.
>> How do you know?
>> I remember.
my father was here too.
?Listen to the wind blow ?
?Watch the sun rise ?
?Run in the shadows ?
?Damn your love, damn your lies ?
?and if you don't love me now ?
?you will never love me again ?
?I can still hear you saying ?
?you would never break the chain ?
?and if you don't love me now ?
?you will never love me again ?
>> Hello?

>> I can remember my father.
>> Are you sure?
>> Positive.
>> Sorry. >> It's okay.
I still don't know why you're doing all this for me.
>> Well, we're an endangered species.
I'm just...doing my best to try to save us.
>> Hell, i didn't even know there were others like me.
>> I remember that feeling.
>> So...how do i look?
>> Like an exceptionally cute boy
who can breathe underwater.
>> You're special, claire.
and not just because of the whole Immortal healing thing.
I don't know.
maybe if things were different,
we could have gone out or something.
we could have been hiding in your bedroom
for entirely different reasons.
>> Uh, even if things were different,
I'm not really into the whole relationship thing right now.
>> Hmm.
>> It just seems like everyone who gets married
gets a divorce.
>> Okay, i think it's more like half of all marriages Get a divorce or something.
>> Yeah, but who knows how happy that other half is.
>> I don't know.
I still think it's worth it.
>> Why?
>> For moments like this.
when someone gets you
the way that no one else does.
it's definitely worth it.
>> Those agents are coming toward the house.
Alex, come with me. Come with me!
>> Go.
>> Come on, in here.
>> That's the first place they're gonna look.
>> No, you have to whack it.

God knows what else in there.
he doesn't think i know about it-Careful.

>> Okay.
>> Just another day in the bennet house.
>> Let's go. Let's go! >> That is so weird.
>> You're not supposed to be here.
I'm off limits.
>> Top floor is clear.

>> Oh, come on, claire, we both know what's going on.
hot guy, just your type.

>> Well, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?
>> If you two are finished here,
I need you to get the hell out of my house.
>> Wow, that was close.
>> I cannot believe the way you stood up to that bitch.
>> Let's not celebrate yet.
they're not gonna give up so easily.
>> The train's leaving soon.
we need to find a way to get you to the station.
>> You have both done enough.

>> No, they'll catch you.
>> Maybe not.

>> I think i got something.
>> Daphne? >> Millbrook, right?
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

they got the whole thing on tape.
>> What are you doing? >> Copying the files.
>> What for? >> To expose them.

no warrants, no trials.
this is gonna look great on the evening news.
Nathan's not gonna know what hit him.
we'll use this as leverage.
daphne's not here, matt.
there's no guarantee
that we're gonna find her, but if we have this
>> We can make a deal.
everything we've got in exchange for daphne.
>> One life at a time.
>> Parkman's a telepath.
incredibly powerful.
but when he uses his ability,
his senses become raw nerves,
and he becomes susceptible.
we exploit that... we can disrupt his thoughts.
>> That just might work. Let's do it.
>> Unh! Peter, i can't focus. We gotta get outta here.
>> I need more time! [Computer beeping]
it's done! I got it!
Matt! What?
30 seconds for what?
[Alarm stops] it's off. Come on, let's go! Go!

>> You have all that information too.
tell me this isn't you.
>> Of course not.

>> Yeah, but you could hire someone for that, mom.
>> And beyond that, i know who's keeping me safe, nathan.
I can live my life in peace, thanks to your generosity.
I would never betray you.
>> Look, peter... he stole dangerous files.
and there are people that want him dead Because of that.
>> You're in charge. You can protect him.
>> I'm doing everything i can to contain and control These people with abilities,
but there are other people
that want to see them all dead.
>> Yes, dear.
I've had a bit of experience with all this.
>> Hello?
>> It's me.
>> Pete, where are you? >> Is he okay?
>> I'm only gonna say this once. You know what i took.
I've got evidence against you and your entire organization.
what you've been doing to us.
>> What do you want?
>> A trade.
Matt parkman and daphne millbrook
for everything that i've got.
>> That's it?
two people? I don't understand.
>> Look, if anything happens to them or me,
all the information i've got goes directly
to the nightly news- Do you want that?
so do we have a deal?

I don't suppose that's a coincidence.
>> Peter's no dummy.
daphne and matt ready for transport?
>> No, senator, they're not.
we're not making a deal.
>> What's he talking about?
what the hell are you talking about?
>> I have another plan.
>> You realize if my brother's harmed in any way,
copies of those files are gonna make their way
to every news organization in this country.
our entire operation will be compromised.
>> I'm aware of the situation.
>> Then get millbrook and parkman released right now,
put them in the car,
and get them down to the parking lot.
or do you want to disobey a direct order?
>> I'm following orders, senator, just not yours.
the united states government will not make deals With terrorists.
those were the president's exact words.
despite your endless protestations,
your brother's a terrorist.
>> Terrorist? My brother's not a terrorist.
>> Target spotted approaching parking lot.
>> I'm en route. Hold your stations.
just stay out of my way. Let's go.

>> Are you all right?
>> It's just a scratch. He'll be fine.
>> What do you want, a thank you?
Why...are you doing this, nathan?
>> Doing what, saving your life or trying to save the world?
>> Perhaps there's a better way of doing it.
>> Ma- This hasn't turned out
exactly the way i wanted it to.
okay? I'm aware of that.
there's a lot of different agendas going on.
>> Yeah, all leading to killing us.
you realize you're responsible for that.
>> Yeah, i do.
it's out of control, and it's my fault.
but i can fix it.
in fact, i'm the only one who can fix it.
>> Why is that? Because you're one of us?!
>> Because i'm the only one who really cares
if you're alive or not, pete.
come with me, okay,
and i promise you'll be treated well.
>> Don't do this, nathan. >> It's okay.
>> Ma, please.
you have my word.
I know you'll take care of me. >> I will.
>> Because you love me.
>> Pete, i'm just trying to help.
>> Yeah.
Bye, nathan.
>> Pete!
>> No, nathan, don't.
>> You give me one good reason
why i shouldn't go after him right now.
>> Because the game has changed.
I've seen it, and you need to be ready.
>> And we have some breaking news for you now.
rumors have surfaced that the u. S. Government
has recently broadened the reach of the patriot act.
>> Thanks, brian.
well, tonight sources have provided our news bureau
some startling footage taken directly
from an unnamed government agency
right here in washington.
now, this video shows american citizens
in hoods and restraints
in what appears to be a clear violation
of their constitutional rights.
is the government running a secret military organization
with the authority to disregard civil liberty?
>> So what, we're just gonna stay here all day?
look, the guy's an ass, plain and simple.
all right, i told you parents su
>> He killed my mother.
>> I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I mean, i've been trying to tell you that he's a jerk.
>> You've been trying to tell me, really?
when did that happen?
cause all i can remember is the cute little stories
of you two bird watching around the neighborhood.
you made him sound like mr. Freakin' rogers.
>> I was just waiting for the right time.
Hey, i got an idea.
why don't we drive up to canada,
because we're close to the border.
we could rob some old ladies. >> That's not gonna happen.
>> Why are you doing this to me?
>> Because you're here,
and i need to express my feelings.
you used me for some joy ride, an escape.
I got news for you, kid. There is no escape.
there is only pain.
and you can never outrun it no matter what you do,
no matter where you go.
go home to your mother, luke.
>> You're not gonna kill me?
>> Seems a little on the nose.
>> Where you going?
>> To find my father.
cause now that i've seen the truth...
I want him to die.
>> What the hell are you doing?
>> Must've realized there'd be consequences
for your actions.
>> Yeah, when that story breaks, you're exposed.
and the world will see what you're doing.
you're hunting innocent people.
>> You're not innocent.
the world just doesn't realize how dangerous you are.
now they will, and they'll beg me
to hunt you down and kill you.
the enemy has a face, parkman. It's you.
>> No, i don't want to hurt anyone.
>> Really?
to me...you look exactly like a terrorist.
>> Why did you...
>> You gonna miss having a cute guy in your closet?
>> A little.
you were incredible.
>> Nice to know i still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
>> I love you.
>> I love you. Just the way you are.
I wouldn't trade this life for anything.
>> Me either.
>> So i made popcorn.

we're just kidnapping you.
I am so sorry.
do you want to be an alpha chi or not?

Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
where are we?

I'm a friend of mr. Bennet's.
how'd you get in here?
we told them that I was your aunt.
my aunt?
I don't have an aunt.
you do now.
Mr. Bennet fixed some paperwork and here I am.
Mr. Bennet said that everything would go away...
that the cops would buy the story.
Mr. Bennet...
said they'd let me go.
Hey.
all I have to do is sign you out.
that might not be such a good idea.
why not?
I killed my parents.
I'm a murderer.
you can't control me.
you've never been able to do that.
well, I had a compelling reason.
let's face it. Your wife is kind of hot.
enough!
that is the second parkman I made scream today.
if you want, I can give you some pointers later.
crazy psycho!
what are you gonna do?
hit me? Defend your lady's honor?
we both know it's not about that.
it's about all those other things I can do to her...
and matty, next time I take over your body.
that's when the real fun begins.
hmm, cozy.
Oh, my god.
do you smell that?
it smells like something died in here.
what is this place?
Oh, my god.
slaughterhouse.
Oh, my
please don't say that again.
Hey, guys?
supercute puzzle over here.
what you find will help you survive.
when we were found will keep you alive.
when we were found"?
okay, guys, let's just open one,
so we can get out of here.
wait!
Oh, my god.
relax. Relax.
it's not real.
they're just trying to scare us.
open 24.
how do you know?
when we were found," 1924.
that's when the sorority was founded.
you know that?
my mom's a former sister. Remember?
Oh, thank god.
I am so thirsty.
Hey, one bottle per team.
no problem.
come on, ash.
they won the first round.
now we are going to bring it.
no.
can I just stay here?
what happened with your parents... I understand.
all you did was touch them.
the day that I discovered my ability,
I killed a man.
he was threatening me.
I grabbed him and something took over.
something inside of me.
and no matter how hard I tried...
you couldn't let go.
your emotions took over.
you got mad.
for most people, that's not a bad thing.
we're not most people.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
his next of kin is here.
what possible reason do you have for holding him?
well, we got plenty.
is this jeremy's?
Gil, show him what we found.
I feel the darkness surrounding me.
I am the bringer of death.
he's 17 years old.
half the songs in his ipod sound just like that.
well, maybe I should read you the part
about killing animals.
any kid at school will tell you he does it...
for fun.
so now we're taking gossip as evidence, is that it?
there's something wrong with that boy, okay?
far as I'm concerned, this proves it.
he ain't getting away with killing his family.
he's staying right here.
no, they still haven't charged him.
their evidence is circumstantial at best.
Yes, right now.
I'm calling in a favor, denis.
thank you.
all right, I'll see you then.
sounds like you're shaking things up in there.
from the looks of the place, I'd say they could use it.
is that right?
tell me something.
how's a girl like you end up in a place like this?
Oh, you have to do better than that.
the name is samuel.
and I'm here to ask you one question.
if you're here to save young jeremy's life,
then what's next?
you gonna take him to a place just to live?
or where he belongs?
what did you do?
it's all right.
stay back.
I'm a friend, tracy.
how do you know my name?
it's all right. You're safe here.
I'm like you.
we're all like you.
what is this place?
home.
slaughter floor or operation center?
should I even ask?
have a nice hell week.
after you.
so, uh, how long have you known?
known what?
that I really don't want to be in this sorority?
that you like girls.
you make it sound like I have to declare,
like, it's my major or something.
I'm actually jealous.
first year of college
and you've already figured yourself out.
hmm.
I don't know about that.
truth is I've had more boyfriends than girlfriends.
Really? Mmhmm.
how many more?
six or seven.
that's not a lot, right?
sounds about right.
Hey, you're not
no, you couldn't be.
you were a cheerleader.
not what?
a virgin?
we could not be more different.
maybe we're strange attractors.
strange attractors?
it's a physics thing.
everything in the universe has a magnetic charge, right?
so strange attractors are particles that end up together
that don't really belong together,
but when they're together, they're superpowerful.
sort of like we could be?
or not.
what?
Shh. Hold on.
come on.
don't tell me you're freaked out now.
I mean, look.
see? Nothing.
just more lameness.
what the hell was that?
I'm starting to think this isn't a game.
this is the life jeremy could have.
what? Working at a carnival?
surrounded by family.
his true family.
do you remember the first time you experienced your gift?
gift" might be a little generous.
like the entire universe coursing through you All at once.
that wasn't just your ability, tracy.
you were tapping into something greater than yourself.
we're all connected.
I'd like to believe that.
believe it.
every time someone joins this family,
I get a feeling in here.
it's an energy, I guess.
it gets stronger every day.
this is where jeremy should be.
what, living in trailers, drifting from town to town?
what would you do?
give him a false name? A false life?
this is a boy who can work miracles.
why should he be invisible?
bring him home!
you could join him.
I know you've been lost too.
it's your nature.
that's enough.
just take me back now.
fair enough.
look, I'm never out the hard sell,
but please take this
to find your way back here.
this is lydia.
she'll take you from here.
I know her. I helped her.
she came to me when she was sad.
I know.
I held her in my arms. We were flying.
we've talked about this.
the memories you're having, they're not yours.
then whose are they?
and if the real me isn't in here...
then where am I?
Matt, what are you doing?
uh... I have to leave.
it's just it's not safe for you and matty.
Why?
because...
someone else can control me.
my body.
someone else?
Matt, why do you always do this?
come on.
we're just getting close.
we're going on 15 years
and you want to blow everything up again?
look, I did a terrible thing.
Aw, this should be good.
I used my ability to push one man's memories
into another man's head.
Yeah, my head.
there is somebody out there using my body
without my permission.
I didn't even know that you could do that.
it was wrong. I know that.
but I had to do it to get rid of this really bad criminal.
well, that's not very nice.
or at least just his mind.
and now his consciousness is rattling around
up in here.
well, there's so much space.
will you shut up?
Janicejanice, look.
I can get rid of him.
the answer's out there.
I just got to go find it. Good luck.
I need you to trust me, okay?
I'm gonna give you guys a moment.
do your thing. You trust me, right?
come on, you said it yourself.
a decade and a half. That's worth something, right?
I can fix this.
okay.
okay.
um... You need a place to work things out.
you should stay here. No.
no, I insist.
it's safer for you here.
and I'll take matty and we'll go and stay with
don't!
don't tell me where you're gonna go.
I don't want him to hear.
okay. Okay.
I love you.
that's good.
that was pretty smart even for you,
not letting her tell me where she's gonna be.
but you still haven't figured out
how to get rid of me, genius.
Mohinder, look. I have no idea where you are.
just will you do me a favor? Call me back, okay?
when you get this, just call me.
how's he gonna help you?
he's probably still working on his father's research.
why don't you try your old lady?
see if she picks up.
forget it, parkman.
it is time for you to give me back my body
and just...
accept it.
I'm... Gaining ground and I
I can... Make you do whatever...
I want.
yeah?
this is hurting you a little bit, isn't it?
you wish.
you know, you're right.
I mean, you slept with my wife.
you can control me at any time, right?
all right.
control me.
stop me from drinking this beer.
come on.
come on! Stop me!
why don't we see how you do...
against the heavy artillery.
wait.
I think I've finally found a leash for this dog.
there you are. Your guy came through.
he made all the arrangements.
that's great.
you all right? Yeah.
Yeah, let's just let's get him out of here.
Thanks. Hey.
Jeremy, they're letting you go.
but who am I gonna live with?
you'll be a few doors down from me In my apartment building in d. C.
I've set up a new identity for you.
your name is jarod mitchell
and you're going to attend georgetown high school.
so nobody will know what I can do?
you'll learn to control your ability with tracy's help.
but you're gonna keep it to yourself.
it's the only way.
what if something happens?
nothing's going to happen.
you'll be safe.
you'll be invisible.
what, you think a sorority brought us out here
to kill us?
that's ridiculous.
it's just a game.
it didn't just move itself.
well, there was no one else there.
how else would you explain it?
in my world, there's a million ways.
name one.
telekinesis.
I've seen it.
heck, I know someone who has it.
so wait, you're saying there's Another one of you here?
it's very possible.
and what?
they're bored and they're playing A college prank on you?
not a prank.
you think that they're trying to kill you?
not me.
then who?
me?
come on.
think about it.
my first roommate committed suicide
with a mysterious note that wasn't there, but then it was.
I mean, maybe you almost getting gutted
wasn't a coincidence.
Claire, that is a little out there.
sounds like some crazyass conspiracy theory.
which pretty much describes your entire life.
what was that?
I don't know.
ash, cut it out. Come on.
Hey, you guys all right?
you find another clue?
like I'm gonna tell you.
look, your roommate's freaked out
and we don't care about the treasure.
let's just stick together, get the hell out of here,
and once we find it, you can have it.
deal?
okay, can we just go?
deal.
lead the way.
we'll take my car. Straight ahead.
we know what happened to your parents!
we know what you did!
we know what you did.
Hey!
you're getting away with murder, you...
don't! Hey!
don't hurt him!
Jeremy, stop.
let him go.
get the hell away from him!
Jeremy! No!
Jeremy, you can save him!
everyone back! Back!
Jeremy, listen to me.
you can help him. You can save him.
everybody stand back!
now listen, son.
you're going back in there where you belong.
you know what you did to your mama and your daddy.
save him. You can do it.
you do not understand the first thing
about what's happening here.
three people are dead.
I understand that.
and that boy, whatever he is, is responsible!
Hey, do you want it to happen again?
just let me talk to him.
talk to him?
you're through talking to him.
both of you.
you think killers go free, huh?
not in this town.
Gil, where's the boy?
Gil, do you read?
the boy is gone.
Gil, do you read me?
are you there?
not so tough now, are you?
go ahead.
take your best shot.
give me a reason.
you're not normal.
you don't belong here.
go.
you like that?
you know what this is?
I bought this with janice
on our anniversary trip to ensenada.
and it is so poetic that I am using it to bury you.
bury me or drown the truth?
the truth, what?
that you're nothing?
you're just a figment of my imagination.
let's quiet those voices, shall we?
your wife walked out on you.
you think she wanted to give you your space.
she can't stand the sight of you.
pathetic.
you know what she said to me In front of the fire last night?
why can't you be more like this all the time?
when you're gone...
Janice and I are gonna have a beautiful life together.
you're so desperate to fit in.
why can't you accept your power?
why do you insist on being so forgettable?
Oh, man.
you're afraid.
you're afraid of dying.
and you just passed out.
you just passed out.
Yes!
Oh!
honey, I did it.
I really did it.
kill house.
prep room.
kill house" sounds more dangerous.
we're taking that one.
I thought we were gonna stick together.
no way.
let's just check this real quick.
we'll catch up to them.
well, we won.
kind of.
I'm gonna go get paris and nicole.
I get it, by the way.
you get what?
you wanting to run from your freaky world
and live a normal life.
I shouldn't have put you on the spot
and gotten all relationshipy on you.
the last thing you need right now is
I need you.
trust me.
what?
what's going on?
Oh, my god! Claire!
Oh... My...
God!
grab her!
a little help, please?
Oh, my god. Claire.
Oh, my god. Don't!
don't do it! Stop!
no, stop!
what the what?
how did you
what's happening?
what are we gonna do?
we could have saved him.
he needed a home.
a real home.
Hey.
Tracy, I'm sorry.
you know, this was supposed to be simple.
just go in and sign him out.
I thought I could manage it.
by hiding him away for the rest of his life?
I stood on his porch and I told him
that I wouldn't let him down.
but you did.
we did.
I did what I thought was right.
and I was wrong.
I've been wrong all these years.
do we have to be invisible?
you ever think we could just live, noah?
out in the open?
not after today, no.
don't ever call me again.
Hi.
Hey.
you gave us quite a scare there, brother.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just, um
I had to see if, uh
if I could, um
I'm much better now.
not quite.
we start over from the beginning.
you hear me?
Yeah.
Thanks.
both of you.
I love you.
you'll love me a lot more after I take a shower.
let me guess.
you want your body back?
did you think you were actually winning?
the second you blacked out, I slipped right in.
now I'm in the driver's seat.
you'll never get away with this.
I already have.
Lauren, it's great to see you.
dinner's ready, everyone.
you brought a date? - No.
how did the two of you meet?
Lauren and I use to work together at primatech.
she is so a date.
I'm dead. He knows it. You know it.
why don't you tell us why?
as far as the world is concerned, Nathan is still alive.
Yeah, but I'm not me.
they are your memories.
his spirit and his mind are fighting for his family.
I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna bring him back, mom.
it's over. It isn't possible anymore.
I'll find a way.
maybe I'm just not supposed to have a normal life.
it sounds like you're giving up.
I want to find out where this leads.
where did you get that?
I stole it from my dad.
you need to take me back.
I need to know the truth.
your brother's powers could increase a thousandfold.
it's been my life's work to keep him in the dark.
how long have you been lying to me, huh?
you had to be controlled.
you have the power to kill millions.
you have betrayed me.
Sullivan
I know the truth, samuel.
but I have a daughter to look after,
so your secret is safe with me.
you wanted to see me, samuel?
I don't know why I bother reading these
nothing but god-awful news... Everywhere.
makes one wonder, doesn't it?
about what?
the nature of our lowly existence.
people want to believe there's hope everywhere,
but then you read this.
it makes you wonder if we're not destined to be the last generation of our species.
and if that's so, how can we stop that from happening?
I...I don't really give it much thought.
well, you really should.
you grew up in this family.
you've been a loyal and trusted member your whole life.
that's why I want to ask a favor.
with Edgar gone, will you do me the honor of being my right-hand man?
or should I say men?
the honor would be all mine.
good, bcause I need you to start by retrieving some files from the apartment of a Mr. Noah Bennet.
they'll be in a box marked "primatech."
who should I give this to?
do I get to use my friends?
I think they will lend themselves very nicely to the job.
evening, Mr. Bennet. - Hello, Ms. Gilmore.
come on in.
you know, um... I easily could have picked you up.
you do live closer to the theater.
I asked you out.
seems only fair I pick you up.
are you uncomfortable with that?
no, no, no, not at all.
it's just... It's been a long time since I've dated.
you know, I kind of, uh, skipped right over the sexual revolution.
who said anything about sex?
what's all that?
Oh, that's the bad guys.
I think. I don't know.
it's been hard to wrangle resources since primatech folded.
"Compass"?
that seems to be the key component in the mystery.
enough for them to kill for.
I've come across two of them.
here, have a look.
it was right here.
maybe you put it someplace else.
no.
she took it?
when she was here last night.
damn it.
voice mail.
Claire it's me.
I know you took the compass.
whatever you're doing right now, please just stop.
this is much more dangerous than you know.
call me right away.
let me guess--We're not gonna go to the movies tonight.
give me her number.
working for the CIA has a few benefits,
like waterboarding terrorists and pretty decent bagels,
and the ability to triangulate cell-phone calls.
what is it? - 703-555-0187.
when we get the cell-tower locations,
we can hop on google maps,
and get a general sense of where she's headed.
thank you.
I owe you.
it'll be okay, Noah. We'll find her. We will.
we came all this way to go to a carnival?
I guess so.
the compass is locked right onto it.
I always said I belonged in a freak show.
I just never took it so literally.
I know why you're here.
good.
then you'll save me from the long-winded windup.
Peter, there are five stages of grief.
you need to leap over denial phase
and get right into the acceptance of this whole thing.
he's not dead, mom.
sweetheart, Nathan died months ago,
despite my own grand gestures of denial.
no, he's in there, in Sylar.
why do you think we're still standing?
Nathan kept us alive.
so I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna take Sylar down once and for all.
how do you intend to fight him with all the powers he has?
well, it won't be too hard once I take them away.
thanks for coming, Rene.
the least I can do.
please, Peter, think about what you're doing.
I have. I'm gonna go get Nathan back.
what happens when you find out there's not a Nathan to get back?
I guess I'll just settle for revenge.
maybe we shouldn't do this.
what? We've been driving for 21 hours.
I know. It was a stupid idea.
what if we run into psycho Becky in there?
she already tried to kill you once.
twice, actually.
but you'll protect me, won't you?
look, I'm serious, okay?
you don't have to do this.
and now that I think about it, neither do I.
Claire, Claire, wait.
I'm here because of you, to support you no matter what.
so you have to do this.
do I?
we've been on the road for a day.
but you've been on this road your whole life,
and it's led you here.
so you have to at least check it out.
so glad you could make it.
I know it can look a little scary from the outside,
but you'll get used to it.
here, free passes.
the whole night's on me-- everything.
you like carnivals, right?
I guess. Thank you.
but, um, we are just looking.
of course you are.
although I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to be seeing.
it's actually more normal than it appears.
this is just the "show" part of the business.
we need to make money the most honest way we can,
going town to town, always on the move, at least for now...
till we find a better, more permanent way to live.
Hey, you two like popcorn?
who doesn't?
well, this is the best popcorn in the world,
and I'm not just saying that.
that is good.
tell you what, stay until you finish the box.
walk around on your own.
meet my family.
when you're done, I'll walk you back to your car.
you girls can go back to school.
fair enough? - Okay.
just until you finish the box.
every tattoo, a harbinger of things to come.
what is it we're suppose to be looking at here?
I don't know, but I've got plenty left.
you never know what future will appear before your very eyes.
every tattoo, a harbinger of things to come.
her naked skin a canvas to rival Van Gogh's.
step right up. Pay your money.
you never know what future will appear before your very eyes.
every tattoo, a harbinger of things to come.
her naked skin a canvas to rival Van Gogh's.
step right up. Pay your money.
you never know what future will appear before your very eyes.
well, this looks promising.
what are we supposed to do?
you ask a question, and then you take my hand.
and then what? You're like a fortune teller?
I show you what you need to see.
like a crystal ball?
something like that.
go ahead. Do it.
am I supposed to be here?
must be some kind of projector or something, right?
in Girl.
what, am I... am I gonna have a circus act?
this isn't the future, Claire.
this is your desire.
come on, let's get out of here.
is this all for me?
you shouldn't have.
no, seriously, You really, really shouldn't have.
listen, Peter.
I'm pretty disappointed in you.
your plan was to syringe me in the neck with drugs.
wasn't that the old plan?
I mean,don't get me wrong.
congrats for pulling it off in the first place.
but fool me twice, you know?
Yeah, I know.
what the hell did you do?
our Haitian friend... I took his ability...
mind-erasing and power-blocking.
now give me my brother back!
Nathan's pretty dead, Peter. I should know.
he's still in you, and I'm gonna get him back.
what are you gonna do...
beat him out of me?
something like that.
that hurts, doesn't it?
no healing power.
what do you want?
I want to make a deal.
I'll let up.
I'll let you heal, but you give me Nathan.
you give him back to me, body and soul.
sounds like a pretty one-sided deal to me.
it is.
so what's it gonna be?
you're gonna need a lot more nails in that thing.
that's fine.
I'll just take away everything that's you until Nathan is the only one left.
I would love to see you try.
come on, Nathan, I know you're in there.
go ahead. Kill me.
come on, I can't do this alone.
please.
is it really you?
what did she mean about seeing your desires?
no idea.
do you have some secret desire to be a circus performer?
not that I know of.
well, this place is starting to give me the willies,
so maybe we should just...
it's kind of amazing, though.
I mean, these people have all figured out a way to use their abilities.
they're conning people, Claire.
at least they're living out in the open.
in a freak show.
look, I can think of worse things.
try having the government hunt you down.
maybe I can be the girl who gets sawed in half every night.
now, that's something to aspire to.
give me three more balls.
I'm going for that big stuffed tiger.
that's not fair.
you've had your turn.
watch and learn, missy.
three years pitching in the minors, dude.
I'm gonna clean you out.
Hey, that ball was headed right down the middle.
what the hell did you do?
I'm not the one that pitched in the minors for three years.
double or nothing.
all right, it's your money, man.
how's he doing it?
watch his right hand.
sorry.
all right, little lady, your turn.
so that guy was a jerk, but it doesn't give him the right to rip him off.
Congratulations.
thank you so much.
all right, who's next? Let's go.
come on, three balls for a dollar.
looks like our time is up.
evening, ladies.
hope you liked what you saw.
not really.
if you're interested, uh, I can show you backstage, where we all live.
we'd love to. - No, thanks.
you're more than welcome to join us.
we don't exclude anyone here.
come on, step right up! Here we go.
all of southern Ohio.
that's great, needle in a haystack.
hard to believe we bagged and tagged every one of these people.
you're not gonna find any leads in there.
carnival's a nest we never came across.
I'm gonna try cross-referencing these with the CIA database, see what I can find there.
let it go, Noah. Girls lie to their fathers.
you're not the only one.
I deserve it.
like father, like daughter.
lying is a stock in trade in our line of work.
and you reap what you sow.
all right, fine.
if you want to wallow, have at it. Unload.
I've driven everyone away with my suffocating need for control.
Oh, come on. Everyone?
you. - Me?
Yes. You.
this ought to be good.
Lauren, we had something together.
what, at primatech?
I definitely thought you were cute,
but we never had feelings for each other.
we did, actually.
no, we didn't.
we had breakfast twice a week for almost six months, and we talked about everything.
well, I think I would remember that.
not if you had your memory erased.
you had my memory erased?
no. You did it yourself.
it was over before it began.
we both knew it was gonna end badly,
and you chose the high road.
I haitian'd myself.
this isn't the way I wanted to tell you...
but you deserve to know the truth.
and what, this-- Now you're single, playing the field,
and you thought what, you could reignite the flame?
Mr. Bennet?
who wants to know?
name's Eli. Uh, I'm an emissary.
an emissary from where?
Sullivan brothers carnival.
you mind if I, uh, come in?
I'd rather you stay where you are.
now, now... Where are your manners?
what do you want? - Something you have, and we want.
we don't want anyone to get hurt.
so we'll just take what we came for,
and we will be on our way.
bathroom!
he's a multiplier. - I know.
okay, that's what I call being prepared.
one of them is a prime. We shoot him, we get rid of the rest.
it took us two weeks to find the one in Tulsa. What's the plan here?
shoot them all and hope for the best.
gone.
so are your files.
from time to time, the ogre would return,
always bringing presents to the boys and girls of the village.
even though the grown-ups feared him, hated him,
the children knew he was harmless.
because children always know, right?
you got to admit, it's nowhere near as creepy behind the scenes.
that's because it's dark out.
it's just like any other carnival.
except for the part about the superpowered con artists.
everybody knows that the games at carnivals are rigged.
and I don't see the problem with doling out a little karma.
I mean, they let the little girl win a prize, right?
they're exploiting their abilities, Claire.
I don't see you running around conning people with yours.
Hey, barbie...
Doyle? Hey.
what are you doing here?
we were just in the neighborhood.
how long have you been here?
since you helped me leave costa verde.
I kind of kicked around for a while,
tried to stay under the radar.
it didn't work out so good.
and then Samuel found me, And everything changed.
it is amazing living here.
I finally belong someplace.
I can be completely myself.
you have no idea what that's like.
I need to talk to you about this.
are you gonna be here for a while?
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.
I have to go strike my set, and I'll talk to you in a bit.
okay. - Okay.
explain to me how you're bffs with a carny?
he kidnapped me once, tried to get my mom to shoot me, but I got over it.
excuse me?
the children want to hear one more story before they go to bed.
why don't you tell us one?
no. Oh, I don't-- I don't think I know any stories.
of course you do. We all have stories.
uh, okay...
once upon a time...
there was a frog.
and the frog lived in a far-away land with mom, dad, brother, and a tadpole named Mr. Muggles.
and the frog always wanted to be special.
what is it you people want from her?
it's not fair to toy with her emotions like this.
she's vulnerable, you know?
we live in troubling times, do we not?
that doesn't answer the question.
families encompass all manner and shape.
but the defining ingredient is love.
now, we don't profess to offer much, but love, we have in ample supply.
something that changed everything.
I'm tired, Pete.
Yeah, I know.
no, I mean I'm tired.
I've been trying to get out. Fight my way,
and I don't think I can do it anymore.
I don't think I can hang on.
sure you can.
you know what? Let's go get some air.
I know just the place.
and after they saved the world from total destruction,
the frog went back to its family with all that it had learned,
and they all lived happily ever after.
all right, children, time for bed.
no. No more stories. Come on, lets go.
good night.
they love you.
who's in charge here?
sorry, sir. This is a restricted area.
Where's the man in charge?
you're looking at him, friend.
you're not my friend. You stole my money.
well, I'm sure there must be some mistake.
we-- we don't steal money from our customers.
the hell you don't. Now give me my damn money back.
we offer our customers games of chance.
and as such, you obviously took a chance, and you lost.
the game was rigged.
or you don't possess the proper skill level to win.
we all have talents, certain talents, friend.
god-given gifts, but perhaps the good lord forgot to hand a sufficient one out to you?
well, how's this for a gift.
Oh, my god!
why isn't he fighting back?
it's clear our friend has a point he has to make.
let him speak his piece.
okay, that's enough!
Really? I'll take you on.
I'll take on any of you freaks.
you can't hurt us.
remember the last time we were up here?
Yep.
Yeah, I do.
you were standing on that edge right there...
like an idiot...
asking me about dad's depression...
asking me if I could fly.
do remember what you said?
I said we could both fly.
no, no, no.
before that.
you denied it.
it was an election year.
denial was the go-to.
it seems like a million years ago, huh?
a lifetime.
and we made it through it together.
made it through all the craziness, you and me.
we can make it through anything, Nathan.
even death?
why not?
because this isn't me.
it's not my body.
because it's Sylar's.
no. It is you. Nathan, I'm looking at you.
you're looking at an illusion.
no, it's you.
look, I need you to keep fighting in there, okay?
I can't.
he's killing me.
and I can't hold on anymore, Pete.
Yes, you can, Nathan.
look, that's-- that's why you found me.
that's why you came and found me.
I found you because I wanted to crucify you in times square.
Nathan, that is not you.
that's what I'm trying to tell you.
Nathan, stay with me. Hey, hey! Fight it.
come on, I need you to fight it.
I need you to fight it, Nathan.
come on, stay with me, bud.
please.
come on.
I'm sorry, Pete.
pull yourself up, Nathan.
let me go, Pete.
I can't do that.
you need to accept that I'm gone.
I need you to help me. Now, pull yourself up, please.
you're gonna have to carry on for the both of us, Pete. Okay?
tell mom I love her.
you take care of Claire.
fight the good fight.
you've always been everything that's good in the world, Pete.
Nathan. - And I got a feeling the world ain't seen nothing yet.
I can't do this without you.
you can do anything, Pete...
anything.
remember that.
I love you.
I love you, Nathan.
why did you let him do that to you?
life is a series of choices...
one of the many I'm forced to make to preserve the well-being of this family.
you could've defended yourself.
Yeah, easily.
but we're gypsies, Claire.
we weigh our decisions very carefully when dealing with the outside world.
the path of least resistance is sometimes the wisest.
it's not right. - No, it isn't.
we're not that different, are we?
we're both learning new things about ourselves,
both searching for new ways to live our lives on our own terms.
but you found that out here.
have we?
you all get to be what you want to be,
out in the open, right in front of people.
if we lie, bow our heads, keep our mouths shut...
let some creep punch our face and not hit him back, Oh, yeah.
I've been sold a bill of goods my whole life...
taught how to be comfortable being a second-class citizen.
and now I'm questioning that, and so are you.
I know what you were thinking, walking around tonight,
that this place is awfully strange,
yet strangely familiar. Am I right?
I don't know what I've been thinking.
Yes, you do, and you were right.
we all think it's a little strange.
a carnival?
it's the only life most of us have ever known.
but we can be more.
we can be bigger...
if we can just figure out how.
and I have a strong feeling, Claire Bennet,
that you can help us do just that.
I think it's time for some soul searching.
