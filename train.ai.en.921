one time when I was, uh, in high school,
I was working on my dad's truck.
and I had one of them vacuum tubes
you know what I'm talking about.
and, uh, I figured out that if I held it just so and sucked
I could give myself hickeys.
so I had them all over my neck.
and I told my buddies that, uh, that I had a girl from out of town.
but, truth be known,
I never kissed a girl before, ever.
I'm sorry.
what's so funny?
sorry, everyone.
it's just, well, hickeys, huh?
guess we found a new nickname for Kendrick.
let's go.
we're making good time, but we gotta keep moving.
so, Winsley, what's your secret, huh?
good grief, you think I'd tell you chaps?
I've just barely met you.
is all Brits as charming as Winsley?
I don't know.
what the hell is he doing?
no...
No!
No! No! No! Don't kill me!
no, no!
cover his mouth.
come on, right here.
Deac, Deacon, Deacon, shh.
it's okay.
be quiet.
can you do something for him?
he needs a warm place to sleep.
Yeah, we don't really have that, do we, Gould?
what can you do for him here?
deacon, listen to me!
do not get us killed!
look at me! Look at me!
open your eyes. Look at me.
relax.
breathe.
I'm going to take my hand away from your mouth.
don not scream, okay?
okay. Shh.
did you see 'em?
tell me you saw 'em.
it's okay, Deacon.
talk to me.
all right.
last Thursday, we ran into some Krauts in a little town in the Elsenborn Ridge.
they were pulling out, but this one little bastard was holed-up inside a church.
I sent Deacon to take him out.
it was dark in there.
somebody took a shot at him.
so he threw in a grenade, sprayed the room.
went up and took the guy out.
in the room...was two women and six kids.
it was a mess.
when it was over,
Deac just...
flipped out.
our C. O. gave me a jeep to have him checked out at St. Vith.
we got captured about an hour before you guys run into them at Malmedy.
you don't mention this to him.
do you understand me, Gould?
all right, what do we do?
we keep him talking.
we don't let him go off by himself.
and please, put that rifle in somebody else's hands.
Yeah.
C'mon. Damn.
what is that? Some kind of code?
no, it's the way I write.
I hope somebody can translate that.
of course. I can.
are you trying to tell me you're the only person that knows what that says?
that more or less sums it up.
so us not letting you die would be pretty important?
Yes.
great.
you got watch.
gonna give you a gun.
I'm gonna scout a bit.
I'll be right back.
that is sick.
Yes, I'm sure you prefer to use your fingers.
that's much better, Hickey.
very distinguished.
that's better than carrying it around in your pocket all day.
that good reading?
do you believe in a life after this one?
not a chance in hell.
when we first got there,
I was working on this kid.
he was shot up pretty bad.
he kept saying, "Please, God.
please, God," over and over...
like it meant something.
he was so sincere about it,
I thought it might work.
then two minutes later he was dead.
there wasn't a thing I could do about it.
when I looked into his eyes...
there wasn't nothing there.
nothing.
that's when I realized that...
this is it.
it's funny.
what can possibly be funny about that?
no, I don't mean funny funny.
it's just that, uh...
we were just outside Sainte-Mere-Englise.
we were getting pounded pretty hard.
and I was holding this kid on my lap, and...
he was shot up pretty good.
and I remember him praying.
and I was praying too.
then all of a sudden, he
he was gone.
and that was it ,really.
that was the first time I really watched somebody die.
but right then, I knew that he was
he was in a better place than that.
how convenient for you.
convenient?
Yeah, that's what I was just thinking about what you said.
funny, huh?
where you from?
I know, Arizona.
where in Arizona?
Snowflake-- I never heard of it.
what do you do in Snowflake for fun?
hunting.
what do you hunt?
whatever's in season.
so you like to shoot things?
forget I asked.
so why do you like the Krauts so much?
cause I know 'em.
I know that most of 'em are just like you and me.
they just wear a different uniform.
so Adolf Hitler is a pretty nice fella?
once you get to know him
it's just a different uniform?
that's not what I said.
and those guys at Malmedy--they're just like us, except they got different helmets on?
if it makes it easier for you to hate 'em, then go right ahead.
you know what, if it weren't for them,
I'd be finishing up med school and putting a cast on Billy's leg 'cause he broke it on his bicycle.
but instead,
I'm taking lead out of his 17-year-old brother's gut, 'cause he wanted to serve his country, and he lied about his age.
and now he's spitting up blood, lying in the dirt, and asking God to come and save him.
it's more than a different unifom.
are they crossed by yet?
they must be stalled somewhere in here.
Yeah, this weather can't be helping them much.
how far is it to Manhay?
about 15 kilometers.
all right.
this weather keeps up, we should be able to beat 'em.
get there by dark. All right.
let's move out. Come on.
Ahhhh!
okay, buddy? Okay?
Kendrick, can you hear me?
we can't do this here!
we gotta get out of this.
if we stop now, there's no way we're going to make it in time.
if we can't move, they can't move.
and we can't move!
get him out of here.
come on.
we're going, we're going.
careful, careful.
stand right there.
do not move.
no, no.
you can't sit down.
you've gotta keep moving. Get up.
get up. Keep moving.
I'm gonna check it out. Winley.
give me your gun.
just stand there, keep your eyes open.
I'll go with ya.
I got it, Deac.
but, Sarge, I can
Corporal!
don't worry about it.
just open the door.
it's okay, okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay.
I'm American.
put the knife down!
put it down! I don't want
put it down!
it's okay.
it's okay, look, I'm putting the gun down.
okay?
put the knife down.
I'm an American, okay?
it's okay, it's okay.
okay, put it down.
American.
American.
Yeah.
it's okay, fellas.
it's okay, uh...
this is, uh, this is Madam Thearey.
uh, and this is Sophie.
bon jour.
bon jour.
Ah, yeah, yeah, we're all-- we're all Americans.
uh, except for him.
he's, uh, he's British. He's from, you know, England.
bien.
Merci.
Merci.
merci, Catherine.
what did she just say?
Goodbye...in French.
it's 15: 00 hours.
we did everything we could, Winley.
we certainly did.
still...
here I sit all nice and comfy, while...
you boys have been super.
but I'm figuring I best get on with it.
look, if I start now,
I can probably get there before morning.
Yeah.
you could try.
I just don't know what your frozen dead body is gonna do for anybody.
you can give these to Kendrick if you want.
cheerio.
you let him go.
he's not our prisoner, Gould.
he's gonna die out there.
Yes, he is.
bon jour.
bread.
thank you.
Oh, Winley?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
we got company.
Oh, Sophie!
No!
No!
no, no!
No!
hands off!
hands off!
you gotta take him, Deac.
Deac, get the Luger!
we gotta catch him!
Damn!
you gotta be kidding me.
did you get him?
we lost him.
what happened to "dead eye"?
I don't know. I just couldn't hit him.
couldn't or wouldn't?
Hey, I did not miss on purpose!
that's a lie!
that's enough!
if Deacon says he just missed him, he just missed him.
we've got other things to worry about right now.
look what I found!
I heard gunshots, so I started back through the woods, and I found this little bugger...
kneeling down, praying his little Gerry head off.
I say we shoot him right now!
shut up, Kendrick!
I'm with Kendrick. Let's shoot him.
with his own gun!
we don't shoot prisoners, people.
Yeah, but he does.
shoot him!
shut up, Kendrick!
what's wrong with you? Shoot him!
Winley, put the gun down!
you will obey my orders!
what's going on?
this is Rudolph Gertz from Berlin.
when I was on my mission, I taught his family, and I
I never miss.
Gundy, I didn't hit him...
but I never miss.
sergeant.
hmm.
did you give my cigarettes to, uh...
Thanks.
no problem.
so, Winley, why did you come back?
I heard gunshots, and I realized I was probably going to die out there.
I'm not proud of it.
you made a choice.
you're still alive. That's good for you.
Yes, that's true.
it's midnight.
Gould, you're up.
I see our prisoners-of-war's having fun.
What'd he say name was?
Adolf.
he gives me the creeps.
it's Rudolph.
whatever.
Hey, Winley, I'll make you a deal.
you pick a card, any card, the put it back in the deck.
if I can find your card in this deck, you give me one of them smokes.
what do you say?
deal.
okay.
got it?
okay, now, you just tell me when to stop.
stop.
this is your card.
Nope.
sorry, Hickey.
this is your card.
the French lady is coming.
bon jour, Catherine.
bon jour.
thank you.
thank you all.
Allez.
Joyeux Noel.
Merci.
Merci.
Frliche Weihnacht.
Frliche...
where is he?
Where's the Kraut, Deacon?
you let him go. You let him go!
no, no, Deacon!
off, off!
let's go, right now!
Hey, who had watch, Gould?
who had watch?!
I did.
but I fell asleep.
then Deacon didn't let anybody go.
Yes, I did.
what?
come on, what'd you wanna do, Gundy?
take him with us?
no, I wanted to shoot him, remember?!
what where you thinking?
I made a trade.
Rudy told me that the weather's pretty much shut down all movement on either side.
and that Manhay is in the middle of some of the heaviest fighting right now, so we wouldn't be able to get Winley through anyway.
but he also said that an unknown number of Germans are making a push toward this little town, Longin.
that's less than six kilometers away.
right.
those are our nearest boys.
I think we can make it through to them.
Yeah, sure.
through a fully armed Kraut division.
we sneak through.
I like it.
I don't love it, but I like it.
and with our full arsenal of two pistols and a bolt-action.
you check the back of that rig?
it's not much, but we gotta make it count.
it's outta gas. The tank's empty.
all right.
run it as far as you can on fumes and then ditch it.
take some grenades.
what kind of name is Oberon?
it's from Shakespeare.
you ever heard of him?
Yeah.
what kind of a name is Shirl?
it's short for Shirley.
Yes, Shirley.
don't get me wrong
I love the name Shirley.
in fact, it's my mother's name.
you trying to get us killed?
is that what you think?
marching through enemy lines
there's no danger there.
Yeah, well, it seems like the right thing to do.
we die trying.
Yeah, maybe.
of course, if someone killed a bunch of innocent women and children this might be a real great way to make up for it, right?
is that what your little Bible tells you?
huh?
is this your penance?
you know what?
here.
what?
take it. I can get another one.
I don't want your book.
Really?
cause with all your questions, you seem awful curious.
get back in formation.
let's take 'em.
or not.
we lay low, keep moving.
that's good thinking, Kendrick.
what are we, about a mile from Longin?
sounds about right.
all right, sun's starting to peek through.
let's go, boys.
how you doing?
all right.
you know, this really is beautiful country.
Yeah, I knew you liked her.
I think I want to learn French.
No!
stay with me, Gundy.
Gundy, I'm coming.
breathe, breathe!
no...
help him!
he's dead.
no, he's not.
he can't...
Look...he's gone.
come on, we've gotta go.
we've gotta go --now.
all right, come on.
come on.
come on.
C'mon, Winsley, let's go.
I can't.
Kendrick, go see if we're still being followed.
go to hell, Gould.
now!
you go!
or you too worried about saving your own skin?
I'll go.
no, you're not going anywhere.
they're still all over the place.
what do we do now?
we're gonna get shot out here.
we need to find a place I can work on him.
can he move?
Yes. Yes, I can move.
all right, follow me.
huh?
I need your help.
put your fingers in here
when I open the wound, push the muscle aside.
don't scream.
okay.
it's all right.
doing all right, doing good.
open it a little further.
I'm trying.
I got it.
come on. Almost done.
I got it.
Ugh. That's it.
all right, I got it. You're gonna be fine.
hold still, hold still.
hang in there, Winley.
you're not gonna bleed to death.
we'll take you to an aid station.
Shhh!
Krauts.
let's go!
here.
heads up!
come on! Move!
come on!
triples on the right flank!
I've got it!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
Kendrick, get Winley outta here!
Yeah, go!
all right, ready?
move, move!
grenade! Move, move, move!
C'mon!
come on.
I got him.
stay with me, stay with me.
we're gonna make it.
we're gonna make it.
Shhh...
get out. Go.
fire in the hole.
come on, Hickey. Hang on.
Gould will be here in a second.
just hang on.
help...
just hang on, hang on!
I'm sorry.
go!
where are they?
right there.
where is he?
there.
Winley! Come on.
Winley. Winley, hang on.
Winley, come on.
say something!
right here.
I can't swim.
is that your big secret?
Where's Kendrick?
Kendrick's dead.
we gotta get these clothes off of him.
so what now?
I don't know.
how's your German?
all right.
the German line's about a half mile up that way.
this road will take us straight through the clearing.
our boys are dug in on the other side.
we ready?
we get Winley through...
save some lives.
that's the idea.
I hid.
I didn't sign up.
I tried to dodge the draft.
but my father came and found me.
is that your big secret?
huh.
did you get that, Winley?
Gould, cover up those weapons.
all right, Winley. Look sick.
hang on.
go! Go! Go!
what's going on?
I can't tell.
I think they're trying to make a push.
there's a jeep coming from right over there.
better get the Sarge on the radio.
let me see.
foxtrot 2-9er calling Foxtrot 0-2.
we got a jeep coming from out of nowhere. Over.
out.
that's one of our jeeps.
but that's a Gerry flag on the hood.
what are they trying to do?
I don't know what you got in mind, Gerry.
but it ain't gonna happen.
the flag! Now!
get it!
hang on a second!
American!
what is it?
we got two Krauts coming in, right there.
you okay?
they're shooting at each other.
you know what, I think the boys are ours.
let's give them some cover fire.
cover fire!
into the trees, on me.
I'm out! I'm out!
you take Winley and go, and I'll cover you.
no, I'm not going to leave you!
you go now!
No!
I'll be right behind you.
you saved my life.
be at peace, Deacon.

[Item Queen's midnight swim at Bachelor party]
Why!? Why's everyone after Kkamini?
because that's what you want.
babu, are you Kkamini's manager or of those journos?
yours, 100%.
what's this? - Three new item numbers...
cabaret, nautch-girl number, cabaret.
top music directors
dance directors of your choice.
and I looks?
enough is enough, Babu
Kkamini is not an ltem Queen. l want to be a Tragedy Queen.
...like Meena Kumari...
Karan Johar... - Karan Johar?
why doesn't Karan Johar ever call me?
because a Karan Johar film needs not an ltem Girl, a heroine.
who has no scandals.
she's a simple girl who could be a daughter, sister, daughter-in-law...
she has one hero, just one hero. True love...
true and pure.
Oh, that so? - What?
plan, Babu, plan!
press conference
jounals
camera
and Kkamini...
ln ethnic wear...
and goggles
just one photo...
one question. - ls this true?
no, this is a lie! lt's a plot, a conspiracy!
Kkamini did not go to any party last night.
somebody morphed Kkamini's face.
Kkamini doesn't even know how to swim!
this is not coming
the Press has gone mad. You come to rescue Kkamini but you slip..A slip of the tongue.
you will mention his name. - Whose?
his! - His? Whose?
Oh, anybody's!
who is he? - Who is Rahul?
tell us.
who is this Rahul?
exactly
who is this Rahul? Rahul is Kkamini's very life!
Kkamini's whole world... Rahul is Kkamini's faith.
this means, Kkamini... - ...is having an affair with Rahul?
No! Don't call it an affair.
this is love...
Kkamini's true love.
l kept it hidden all this time, but not anymore. Because...
why fear when you love. Why heave sighs in silence.
no more questions
do you know what you're doing?
relax, Babu
Kkamini knows everything
Kkamini is not a fool
wake up and smell the coffee
here comes Kkamini
three, two, one, touch down
sir, l'm Dotcom Paaji.
president of end of our marriage. com, ...
what's the plan now?
don't you worry about the plan, my princely bridegroom.
nothing to worry, sir. Get into the car and we'll go straight to Udaipur.
why Udaipur? We told you to finalise the match with Colonel Bakshi of Delhi.
forget it. l'll show you better stuff. - One minute...
what can be better than Col. Bakshi? Good family, rich, first class Punjabi.
you're correct, sir. Col. Bakshi agreed but it's his daughter who's to marry.
she expired. - There! Your marriage is jinxed.
getting into a flap again ! she expired. - No sir, what l meant...
he was in a flap, all the way from Canada...
you're right, sir. But l didn't say the girl had expired...
l meant, her wedding date had expired.
some guy had in his tender earlier and the girl opened it herself.
Oh, this messes up the whole deal! - Makes no difference.
we'll open our tender somewhere else. ls there any shortage of girls here!

lt wasn't part of the plan. Then why did you do it? Why?
why did you do it?
why...
you know why l did it.
what else could l do under the circumstances.
you wanted it too.
but if l hadn't done what l did, there'd be a mess up.
how'd the plan progress?
plan?
Yes, plan
what did you think?
what were you thinking?
what deep game are you playing?
amazing! You are asking me?
the game that you had started. The Rahul-Kkamini game of love.
listen...
Rahul's entry changed Kkamini from ltem Girl to girl-next-door.
but to sign a Karan Johar film, she must turn into a queen...
and that too, Tragedy Queen.
look boss. You aren't getting 10 million to spout philosophy.
you listen, boss. l gave you a 100 million bucks plan for a million.
listen to the second half of the plan

Thanks.

only one echoing answer...
Tomorrow...yes tomorrow.

there may be a tomorrow but ...no Rahul.
Why?
a Rainy Night...
journey... Just One Mistake... and accident!
l'm Karan Johar speaking. l'm so sorry, l just came to know...
...that Rahul is dead.

Where're you going? Please stop.
no, Anjali. l should be sorry.
please go inside your friends are waiting for you, please
just look at us, look at me
why are you with me?
they are of your age. Not me.
l am not in the least like them.
l'm with you because you are not like them.
none of them can do what you did in there.
because they are not what you are...
...crazy...crazily in love with me.
I'm crazy about you
I really am
are you all right, Vinay?
you shaved?
yes... no... ls it okay?
lt's different...
Malhotraji, it's very good news. Your heart is perfectly okay.
Heart...! What heart problem does he have?
who is she? - She...
she is my wife.
Oh, Mrs. Malhotraji.
very glad to meet you
nothing to worry about. He's perfectly fit and fine.
l was told on the phone that he had an accident.
then why a heart check-up? - Well...
you keep quiet... You tell me. - lt's nothing.
just a routine check-up. - Didn't l say, a routine check up?
actually, your daughter told me he had chest pain.
daughter!? - Yes.
shy? Oh, not in the least.
she's really rough and tough. A really lovely girl.
shall we go?
l don't want to hear anything! Where you were, who you were with...
how it all happened, why you didn't go to office...
why that girl went to the hospital with you...
even if she did, what was the need to lie...
Seema, you are ranting on, talking nonsense!
what lie did l tell? What lie?
do l have only one thing to do? There are errands to run outside the office.
l told you about Kkamini's party, didn't l? Had to go out for it.
l was crossing the road. A car came by suddenly.
the poor girl was standing there. She took me to the hospital.
and they ask a 100 questions at the hospital.
how did it happen? When? Who are you?
l just said she was my daughter. You'll nag me to death for it?
Why's Mamma crying, Papa?
because Papa made a mistake.
while crossing the road?
Yes, son. - Did you look left? Then right?
no, son
where was your attention, Papa?
l got distracted. That's why Papa made a mistake, son.
you won't make this mistake again, will you?
never.
mamma, Papa promised.
come, you've school tomorrow. Go to bed.
l don't know what all l thought
you've changed so much...
l was scared. l never stopped to think...
...you'd never do something like this to us.
forgive me.
what's this, Guru !
their connection is on...
there's a forced disturbance in my line...
at least set her connection right.
from when the poor girl has been calling left, right and centre!
go on, Sukhi. - We're in luck, Paaji.
col. Bakshi has consented to the wedding.
Bakshi is ready?
Oh no, pal. lt's a big risk. The marriage is already fixed.
but Paaji... - Shut up, Sukhi.
shut up, Paaji
listen Sukhi. Tell Bakshi Saheb we agree to the wedding.
How're you, Tehzeeb?
they're all friends here
don't worry, l'll be back soon.
we are at Anarkali Bazar near the Lahore stadium.
the people of Lahore are spreading cheer...
in the joy of the lndian team's visit to Pakistan. Just a minute...
5 minutes!
go away. - Go where? l've come from so far.
we are live... LlVE!
let's ask what they think of this historic lndia-Pakistan series.
uncle, do you want to say something?
the atmosphere is very nice. Business has doubled because of the match.
how wonderful!
Congratulations! can I speak now?
salaam. Have you any message for your lndian brothers?
l want to say something.
would anyone like to say something? - Strange!
l've something to say and l'm not allowed to speak!
will anybody in Lahore give me a hearing?
speak, son. l am with you.
l am Ashu and she is Tehzeeb.
l love her and she loves me too... Don't you?
but we can't get married because l'm a Hindu and she is a Muslim.
my parents are against this marriage. Before coming here, she said to me...
think, Ashu... if we marry, what'll our tomorrow be like?
all l have to say is this, whatever our tomorrow may be...
we'll make it beautiful together.
but if you are not with me, l have neither today nor tomorrow.
so Tehzeeb, will you give me my tomorrow?
will you marry me?
l can't remember anything.
this is a strange story...
where does it begin...
she started...she started! She started...
bright smiling face...
Yes, Madam.
working?
lt's only this Raju who can repair Maya.
your name is Raju?
I'm stephanie
what are you saying!? You not stepney! You front tyre!
Rohit call... come?
no worries... only smiles.
we'll go to Rishikesh. Meet Rohit ...
then girlfriend boyfriend marriage and Raju's ruin !
nothing.
no girlfriend?
of course l have.
but she is leaving me... going... to her boyfriend.
girlfriend very bad
no, madam. Girlfriend good... from head to toe good.
l haven't said l love you to her till now.
you see, l don't know how to say l love you ...
close your eyes
now, think from your heart take a deep breath and say it l too love you.
when Rohit says "I love you," I will say l too love you.
l was just passing by.
thought l'd meet you.
Why?
can't we even meet, Gia?
we could have met, Shiven.
that is, if you wanted to.
l always wanted us to meet...
as a friend
no. As BF and GF
we had such good times together, Gia.
only good times... Not bad times.
but Shiven, love is what's there at all times...
because love is not about good times but who you spend time with.
lt's so complicated even when you hear it...
I mean, life should be. simple
like? - Like we were.
you are so beautiful no complication, nothing
this good time, bad time... Today, tomorrow...
who knows what tomorrow brings.
l know.
l know about my tomorrow, Shiven.
l am getting married tomorrow.
they went to Delhi? But we were told that...
if your daughter was rejected they were to go to Jammu.
What...? That dirty, low-down sinner!
who is he to reject us? We broke it off.
col. Bakshi has lost his mind!
what's he saying?
the girl who's marry him
Rohit's getting married?
Rohit, dial Canada. Give our relatives the good news.
okay, give it to me. l'll phone.
your call. - Yes.
lt's your sister from Canada.
l'll give her the good news of your wedding.
Hello, Rohit's getting married
don't even try to call, understand?
please can I speak to Rohit, I need to talk to him
please I am begging you
Rohit, your sister wants to talk to you.
it's me, I'm India, come to see you, I need to talk to you listen, I'm getting married, OK?
you take care
hurry. We'll reach Delhi in 3 hours. Quick... hurry.
Where's she going off looking so sad?
listen !
that's not the way. This is the way. Where're you going off?
taxi waiting.
it's over
what over?
the end.
no end... start.
lt's the beginning.
Rohit waiting there...
he's not waiting, he told me. He's getting married
so what if he says that? Will you believe it? Come with me.
I just can't believe it I came all this way thinking that he want me .
but listen...
listen to me...
listen to me...
will you listen to me or not?
shut up!
l'll give you a tight slap!
your hope of lndian woman? No, no hope.
eating egg curry and parathas don't make you an lndian woman.
you don't become an lndian woman reading Hindi English novels.
giving up hope and turning your back on love...
... will never make you lndian.
lndian woman fight!
fight for love, fight for husband!
so, what did the jackass say? Must've said...
l can't marry you Stephanie. Can't go against my parents.
lf he runs away, you'll also turn coward?
what do I do?
come with me. l'll take you there in 3 hours.
we'll go there, talk and then marriage to Rohit.
why are you doing all this?
when you meet Rohit, it's what you say, l love you...
that's the reason... Come.
where are we going?
just one more attempt...
your hair's turned white, uncle!
Ashu Baba, you !
madam, look who has come!
madam, look who has come!
l'm on the terrace, drying clothes. - Oh, let the work be, madam.
come and see who's here! - l'm coming. Why are you shouting?
my son...
son, your father... - We'll leave.
just a while.
Tehzeeb has lost her memory.
perhaps this place might...
at least get some water, Kaka.
where are all the servants gone! Our daughter-in-law is home.
do you remember this place, Tehzeeb? Remember that day...
garlands of flowers everywhere...
all the people...the bustle...
Music...lights...
the festive air...
and the wedding canopy...
Panditji reciting mantras, everyone busy with wedding preparations...
Nidhi's wedding... Your best friend... And my sister.
look, the groom's party has arrived.
remember, Tehzeeb. - l don't remember a thing!
try and remember, please.
look, Nidhi's friends are all coming down...
laughing and chattering...
and your face amongst them all...
my heart stopped beating when l saw your face...
congratulations, Kaka. Nidhi is a bride!
shall l make you a bride too?
you think it's easy? lt'll be very difficult.
know why? Because l'm not going to marry just anybody...
saved in time. - Not me!
naughty!
remember anything? Something?
please try. Remember those people...
what people! What wedding? What day? l don't remember anything!
who let these people in?
are the servants all dead?
Tehzeeb met with an accident.
she lost her memory. - Congratulations!
now finally he has a chance to mend his mistake. Make him understand.
tell him to leave her... so he can rectify his life even now.
don't say that!
he is in trouble. - Then why has he come here?
where else will a son go if not home? - He should've thought of it...
the day he married a Muslim.
tell him. There's nothing in this house to give him.
there is, father.
your hatred.
l have come to ask for it.
hate Tehzeeb...
...exactly the way you did when she first came here as a bride.
Tehzeeb doesn't remember anything, not even my love.
perhaps she might remember your hatred.
lf not my love, your hate may perhaps give her back her life.
please, father... Give back Tehzeeb her memories.
please hate her, father!
why weren't you answering my calls?
Anjali...! l was about to call you...
don't lie to me
I'm not lying to you
a lot is happening.
l need a little time.
l don't have time, Vinay. l'm going to Paris. l have a dance scholarship.
What're you saying? l have a job here...
a family. A home... My life is here.
ls this the kind of life you want?
l don't know what l want...
l hardly know what to do... what to say...
don't say anything, Vinay. Just listen to your heart...
...the way l heard... And saw...
l see in your eyes a man who wants a lot from life.
l will give you all that.
it's Paris Vinay, city of love
just us...you and me.
Papa phoned...
Gia is getting married.
l came to collect the tickets.
perhaps you are going somewhere else.
just a minute...
come in
looking at the photos? l thought l'd appear in person...
and come close to you
what do you want now, Rahul?
nothing.
l got what l wanted. - What?
being with you.
you can't stop playing this game even for a second, can you?
consider, just for a second... What if this is not a game?
what if Raooul really loves Kkamini?
what if he has always loved her?
from the time Kkamini was not Kkamini... but was Kamna?
an ordinary singer at a small hotel in Dehradun.
from the time Rahul was not Raooul but Rahul...
an ordinary waiter at the same hotel...
...whose only desire was Kamna...
...whose only dream was Kamna's love...
okay, let's leave it at that. Let go of all those old things.
but if today...
lf Rahul were to ask Kamna...
will Kamna fulfil Rahul's unfulfilled dream?
lf Rahul were to say today, Kamna, l love you...
will you marry me?
wait...
lf there is a knock on the door at the same time?
Then...?
and today, Kkamini's dream is standing at the door...
...money, name, fame...
a whole new life...
a life that begins with Rahul's death?
what if Kkamini has to choose between her dream and Rahul?
your dream has come true! Karan Johar announced his new film.
you know, he's thinking of casting you !
this means we must act quickly...
this means.
Rahul must die.
Hey, aren't you going to wish me a loving goodnight?
all right...listen...
may not be love...
but l surely found answers to my questions.
Oh, l forgot the most important thing...
my wine...
congratulations on the tears of joy.
What're you doing?
l'm talking to you !
what are you doing? What's all this! - Lower your voice.
listen to me... - Rohan and Shai are home.
l know... - They don't have to see this drama.
this is not some drama! - Let go my hand!
then first listen to me. - There's nothing to listen.
l have seen it.
shut up! shut up and listen to me
why did you do it, Vinay?
weren't you happy?
lt's not a matter of happiness...
...but of life.
there's a world outside the four walls of the house and office...
...that l want to know... A life l want to live.
l want to realize the dreams l had the dreams we had dreamed.
don't you remember, Seema?
the dreams we had dreamt?
the dreams you had? Why have we forgotten them?
ln these 15 years of marriage, they got lost somewhere.
that feeling, love, that excitement, Where has it all gone?
where is it, Seema?
where is all that?
perhaps time has changed...
but l love you as much even today.
Yes, l too had dreams... Dreams of my own.
but after meeting you, your dreams became mine...
your life became mine.
my dream was for you to get what you wanted.
l had Rohan and Shai... and you.
l didn't want anything more from life.
but l want...
l want more.
may you get what you want...
...that is my only dream even today.
'ls this love or punishment? "
'tell me, O my heart! "
'why doesn't this endless chain of pain not break? "
'how many tests and trials must this love endure? "
'so many diverse stories are writ by this love. "
'o God... "
'even if someone lays down one's life... "
'lt has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. "
'how arduous is the journey to reach love's destination ! "
'there are no solutions to the heart's tribulations. "
'every heartbeat emanates sorrow. "
'every breath breaks restraining bonds. "
'every moment somewhere plaintive lips sigh a complaint. "
'someone's world destroys itself for love. "
'o God... "
'even if someone lays down one's life... "
'lt has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. "
congratulations... on your marriage.
l'm not getting married.
lt was all a publicity stunt.
a plan to get a dream role in A Karan Johar film.
now when the plan is about to be successful...
l want something else.
and you know what funny?
even l don't know what l want.
Why're you telling me all this?
because you too don't know what you want.
2 O clock at night... alone...
...distressed...
you have all the symptoms of being confused.
l guess both of us are confused.
okay, let's decide who is more confused.
how many years have you been married? 12...?
15
let me guess...two kids...
a boy and a girl.
l have met your wife.
she is very pretty.
love marriage
high school sweethearts
together in college too... Then marriage
quick rise...well paid job. Comfortable home in the suburbs.
perfect couple, perfect home, perfect family
perfect but boring life.
then you meet somebody... ln the office...
on the street, bus, train...
on the train?
a newness in life...you want more than what you have.
you seem to know a lot about me.
not about you but l surely know Miss. Train.
l understand girls like her very well...
because l too am a girl like them.
or perhaps l was...
until Rahul came into my life...
so, Miss. Train...
she has a name...Anjali.
anjali what?
you don't even know her full name.
you want to lose what you have...
for what?
you want to lose what you could have had.
for what?
o God... "
'even if someone lays down one's life... "
'lt has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. "
Yes, it's true Rahul is no more.
he died in a car accident.
they've all left for Gia's wedding.
they've gone? - Yes.
'no one hears the sobbing sighs. "
'no one allays the longing of tormented arms. "
'raging desires only half-slaked. "
'all hoped for pleasures shattered into fragments. "
'somewhere a seed of suspicion, elsewhere a wall of hate. "
'even in victory there is loss. "
'o God... "
'even if someone lays down one's life... "
'lt has no effect at all on the one so passionately loved. "
where do you have to go?
l don't know...
'ls this love or punishment? "
'tell me, O my heart! "
'don't ask the pain-afflicted... "
'...what happiness is. What is laughter. "
'Hardship hovers over them... "
'...in some form or other. "
'o God... "
sorry, madam. l dozed off.
Oh this...?
l made this for you.
give it to your boyfriend when he says l love you.
shall we?
Dehli, madam
mamma, l want the window seat.
mamma, where's Papa?
he's not coming with us.
l just need to talk.
she is my wife.
l haven't come to ask you to forgive me...
...because what happened was unforgivable.
please don't go.
what had to happen happened, Vinay.
nothing happened, Seema. Nothing has changed.
no. Everything has changed.
lt was you who said... That love, the excitement...
l could never give you what you call life.
this is not true, Seema. - Then what is the truth?
what is the truth?
the truth is that in all this, l am left standing like a joke...
...l, my love, my trust... everything.
l am going so that you can get all that you want from life.
but you are my life, Seema.
and this is the only truth.
the only truth.
sir, you have to leave this flight now
please don't go, Papa.
for all of us to go together...
...l suppose we've to catch another flight.
you're all right, aren't you?
l must put on this act for the world.
you are a very good actress, Kkamini...
...but not that good ...
l can tell the difference between real and false tears.
lt's too late... l have lost him forever.
when Kamna was lost, Rahul searched and found her.
because Rahul loved Kamna.
and now when Rahul is lost, Kamna will find him...
...because Kamna loves Rahul.
shall l cancel our tickets for the Delhi-Bombay connecting flight?
How're you feeling? Are you okay?
l am Ashu, Tehzeeb.
let me go.
listen... l've to make a call. Please...
listen, Tehzeeb.
l shouldn't have taken you to my father's house.
l shouldn't have taken you anywhere
listen, Tehzeeb. You are with me. That's more than enough.
come home, Tehzeeb. - l don't want to go with you.
l don't want to stay in your house!
because l can't bear to see you like this!
you always say everything will be all right...
but nothing ever is all right.
you are always searching for your memory in my eyes.
and when you don't find it... You try to act as if it's all fine...
...perfectly normal.
you bring me back my smile and hide your tears.
l can't bear to see you suffer like this!
l want to see you happy.
but my happiness is with you, Tehzeeb.
how can it be!
l DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!
l need to make a call please...
give me your phone... please.
l must make a call.
l can't remember...
abba, yes. Tehzeeb is all right. Talk to her.
Abba...
take me away...please! Take me away.
l tried so hard to recognize you...
but nothing... reminds me of you.
l know, Tehzeeb...
...you have forgotten me.
but that your heart has also forgotten me.
...is something l can't believe.
you'll remember everything one day.
and if l can't remember?
what if l can't remember anything at all?
we'll create new memories.
memories are of life...
and without you, there's no life.
what life will you have with me tomorrow?
whatever our tomorrow may be...
we'll make it beautiful together.
but if you are not with me...
then l have neither today nor tomorrow.
will you give me my tomorrow, Tehzeeb?
tell me, Tehzeeb! Will you give me my tomorrow?
Shiven, love is what's there at all times...
because love is not about good times but who you spend time with.
whatever our tomorrow may be, we'll make it beautiful together.
but if you are not with me, then l have neither today nor tomorrow.
thanks guys
do you know what you are doing, Gia?
let's go.
'don't ask the pain-afflicted... "
'...what happiness is. What is laughter. "
'Hardship hovers over them... "
'...in some form or other. "
'o God... "
no invitation no entry sir. I'm very sorry
What're you saying sorry for! lt'll be too late if we don't go in.
we don't have orders, sir. - So call the person who gives orders.
are you the manager here? - Something like that.
sir, they don't have invitation sir
Why's she going on about invitations! This girl here...
...came half-way across the world. l made her roam all over lndia.
ln between my Maya darling had 2 punctures and 4 repairs!
she says lNVlTATlONS!! And all this for whom?
that moron of a jackass in there, ha?
he promised love and marriage to her and is marrying someone else!
she is mad enough to love that jackass.
but if love isn't mad, is it any worth, sir?
and she harangues about invitations!
you may go in... because madmen don't need invitations.
thank you.
stop!
stop this wedding!
l told you, madam. The jackass will stop his father when he sees you.
go madam go
why you've come here?
don't I make myself clear on the phone?
I cannot marry you

I want to marry an Indian girl
not some blond like you
there you go I said it

so without embarrasing me further please leave just get out
you said get out to madam! Are you a man or dishrag?
she left her world and came running after you. And you spurn her love!
to opt for hate and reject love is the worst stupidity.
lf l were in your place, l'd put my hand on my heart, close my eyes...
take a deep breath and say l love you !
then why didn't you?
why didn't you say it, Raju?
say it.
l also love you...
l love you too.

dimwit of an owl who doesn't know what love means.

Bakshiji, shall we start?
please start.

they do get together.
l can't find the words... But all the best.
excuse me boss, I need to talk l am getting married, Shiven !
Why's the wedding going on? l mean why are you getting married?
why shouldn't l get married? - Get married. Most certainly.

don't l have to marry someone or other, don't l?
Yes. But not him, someone else.

you must marry me.
Why?
because today l realise ...
love is not about good times but who you spend time with.
gia, l now know...
whatever our tomorrow may be...
we'll make it beautiful together.
but if you are not with me, then l have neither today nor tomorrow.
something like that
the whole point is.
that I love you l know l'm late every time but today... - Today...
lf you were late today, l'd have really killed you !
Panditji, you may begin.
wait! Bakshi Saheb...
bloody...
brighter!
Panditji, what are you looking at me for? Start the ceremony.
this is simply not done! Every one here...

Panditji, finish the ceremony.

he'll be somewhere here.
So...you did come.
l have come.
so, you did find me.
l found you.

Cheque...?
10 million. You brought the cheque, didn't you?
l forgot. You forgot too?
how convenient
you love playing games don't you? - But not more than you.
all right. So let's begin.
lf l said l don't have a cheque for 10 million...
...but loads of love for you... Then?
lf l said...
Then...?
lf the phone rings exactly at that time...
and it is Karan Johar calling.
Then...?
and you have become Karan Johar's heroine...
Kkamini's dream isn't a dream anymore but a reality.
Then...?
l am Karan Johar speaking.
l have some good news.
wrong number.
now... will Rahul marry Kamna?
good technique to split 10 million in two.
accept love's sweet salute, my darling.
just commit the folly of loving me back.
my heart is restless...
my heart is restless...
my heart is restless...
2 years later lf not the first year...
l've to give you something at least the second year, don't l?
happy second anniversary
samurai III
duel AT GANRYU ISLAND
young Kojiro Sasaki is determined to win a match...
with Musashi Miyamoto, his lifelong rival in love and swordsmanship, to become Japan's No. 1 fencer "Clothes Rod" my poor sword
your owner, such a fencer, is still unrecognized
despite his great skill
his dream remains unattained!
blind fools!
poor swallow
not just anyone can do that "Swallow turn" swing. I'll kill Musashi with it
why must you fight him?
my long-cherished dream
he has nothing against you. Why must you kill him?
tell me!
you're a devil!
why get excited about him?
please. Forget him
I won't mention him from now on. So please. -Conceited girl!
I'm not after him because of you
he's good. He's my only match in this country today
my dream is to fight him. He must dream it too
Akemi, stop! -I won't
you scare me. You horrify me
looking for Musashi?
go - then. If you see him...
tell him not to trifle with his life till we fight
Mu-sa-shi!
ancient city of Nara
martial Arts Tournament by the Hozoin Temple Priests
who's next?
come on!
you? -No, pass
if no one sallies forth, I'll leave
I'll call myself today's winner!
any objections?
speak up!
you may come in a group
no one?
no contender? Oh, well
let's go
hang it! -Wait, kid!
I like your spirit. You insulted me audaciously
you challenged
fight with you? -You can't?
then why did you say that?
he's only a child. Forgive him
who are you? -His companion
you urged him? -No, my own idea
then you'll fight with me
you may attack me together, if you wish
please. -I won't forgive him
I apologize in his place. -No!
I was insulted publicly
I won't swallow it
fool
prize fool Agon!
agon, stop it. -No!
stop!
you're no match for him at all
he's peerless. Hasn't lost in 60 odd matches
stop it! -Musashi?
this is no fight
the winner of the tourney is Priest Agon here!
I remembered your old self in Priest Agon
I marvel at your perfection
power alone won't make an accomplished samurai
he must be strong. At the same time he must be just
I want to be able to fight without regrets
my past encounters were full of them
errantry has its points
your suffering will polish you
I feel so pleased tonight
have you ever fallen in love?
I know a person who's longing for you
want to meet this person?
so you've somebody in your heart
don't worry. I mean a man
a man longing...? -Yes, for a man
besides, he hasn't seen you even once, mind you!
who is he? -Lord Yagyu
what? Lord Shogun's teacher?
why don't you go to Edo and see Yagyu?
you brought a letter from Lord Karasumaru? I see
so your name's Otsu
are you connected with Musashi Miyamoto?
Yes, Your Grace. I'm looking for him
too late
he was here until this morning. -Was he?
but he left for Edo
stop. Don't chase him
I must see him. -I see, you care for him
the city of Edo had become Japan's most crowded city
it was the Shogun's political and military headquarters
his captains maintained villas here...
to serve him and to recruit their forces.
many ambitious samurai sought employment...
coming to this large city with high hopes.
I am Okaya. -One moment
why cover your spearhead?
don't worry about hurting me, please
take it off
see his assurance, my Lord
now that I use it uncovered, use a sword yourself
no. This will do -I won't fight like this
it's all right. -Use your sword
I am only an unemployed samurai
use of my sword will offend His Lordship
full of confidence, sir. -Okaya, let him have his way
he overdid it
I was embarrassed
was the audience successful?
well... I fear not
Why? A man of your ability! -It's true
my opponent was not very strong. I should have been gentle
did you win? -I did
true, he will live. As a cripple
nobody will hire one who cripples his vassal
I overdid it. -I like it. You always mean business
I think I did nothing wrong. But people disagree
why are you doing that?
still like me after I tore your present?
I did the same thing today
I'll stay unemployed
I like it. I like your straightforward character
Omitsu
elope with me
I love you. -Please!
don't you want freedom?
don't you love me? If you do, follow me
I am leaving Edo
where are you going?
these young men of today! Impertinence!
conceited! -Please
you don't know how worried he is about today's match
did he tell you that? -No, Father
only... I can sense it
very painful, Okaya? -lt is
I was lucky...
it was not...
a sword
I am very sorry, believe me. -I was just no match for you
I may be sorry but it was my fault
did you get the job?
take good care of yourself
I thought he was arrogant
but he's fine. I never knew it
Kojiro visited Okaya? -Okaya told me so, sir
what do you suggest? -lf he really meant to console Okaya...
he must be somebody. I am for employing him
who is better, your Musashi or him?
I hear Musashi is a matchless swordsman. -I must see Musashi
try and find him for me. -And Kojiro?
I'll think it over
Hey, kid! Your master's been carving images for days
quit fencing? Is he a fencer? -None of your business!
keeper, is this an inn?
master. When will you see the Shogun's teacher?
I won't. -Really? Where's the letter that monk gave you?
threw it away. -You shouldn't have!
lord Yagyu might've recommended you to the Shogun
you disgust me. -Why?
if you succeed in life, so will l
Jotaro, is that why you've followed me?
but why stay here then?
waiting for her? -Who?
Otsu. -Fool!
I know you want to see her. I'm positive
sure. Look. This is her face
please. Mercy
Why? -No
don't
you mustn't
Yes, I want to see her. But she'll refuse to see me
Why?
I did something shameful to her
it's four to one. -And he's winning
what skill! Where is he?
he left a note "The four are students of Obana Strategic School"
he who is responsible for it is Kojiro Sasaki of lsarago.
I appreciate...
your kind deed
however, Miyamoto, the bodies you brought...
have nothing to do with my school
but I hear that they drew when he slandered you
please. None of my students are as weak as that
you call me a meddler, then?
Miyamoto, I teach the Shogun. Mine is an honorable family
my 100 students are accomplished men
I see. Forgive my rudeness for bringing the corpses
let me pass
professor Obana told me they could not be his men
don't be offended. Please give them up to us
I will not. The dead men won't like it
fortunately I know several sutras. I'll bury them
I learned a lesson today "Here lie four unknown samurai"
so it is you
I thought it was one of them
thank you for your help last year
you fought marvelously. I saw it
I learned of your ability today for the first time
those four. One stroke each! -Try it?
kid. Go away awhile
be calm no matter what you see
I've always wanted to meet you
stop. -Scared?
no. Postpone it
elsewhere. If we fight here...
they may say I fought for Obana
which is not true
let us fix it properly and fight freely
you are right. Tomorrow evening...
I'll be at the East Gate. Right? -Very good
you have been evading me. Scared of me? -No
however, I won't elope with you
you think I am joking?
you meant it
you are a darling. I meant it
but I've changed my mind. -Why?
tomorrow night you'll know
I'll do or die! You won't be seeing me, anyway
if I win I'll seek a much larger fortune
if I lose... I'll be dead
in either case, you'll always remember me as your lover
his Lordship
what was it? -Well, he was delighted
he wants to hire Kojiro as his teacher
Kojiro did something big. Where is he?
I'll bring him here
did you come back? -I bring good news!
my Master heard about you and Obana's students
please. They were just weaklings. It did me no credit
however, their master is Lord Shogun's teacher
vengeance will be sought. -I'll fight
listen to me. You are too full of youthful vigor
my Master said "Such animosity must be stopped
he suddenly decided to employ you as a retainer
well? If you become Lord Hosokawa's teacher...
they dare not attack you. -I decline
I dislike seeking protection. -Don't be silly
if they challenge, fight as Lord Hosokawa's teacher
it's not like you. Another thing
chief Retainer Sado is recommending Musashi
Musashi? -He is being sought quietly
we must decide this before they find him
taking an initiative is always advantageous
listen. I duel with Musashi tomorrow
what! With him? -So your worry is over
his dream is too vast
what noise!
Hey, quiet you!
thanks
they became quiet. You are persuasive. -Sure!
excuse me
samurai! Stop eating
confess you're scared. Don't pretend you're calm at heart
stop!
who are you? -Don't know me?
those who don't know me here, must be deaf
speak loudly, as I am hard of hearing
who? -Shut up!
I'm Kumagoro the horse-dealer, a tough guy
and when I say tough I mean tough. -Horse-dealer, eh?
I deal with samurai. I handle live horses, mind you
so what? -You sent this kid to me...
to tell me to be quiet, didn't you?
I have a big voice. You don't own this inn, do you?
so, what? -Apologize
write a letter of apology addressed to us all
or I'll take you out into the yard and punish you
amusing. Very interesting
fresh! You heard me. Now answer me!
answer me at once, or else...!
which would be better?
too many. Wash these sticks
he's terrific!
training for revenge?
I'm his pupil now. Musashi Miyamoto! No wonder!
are you out of your head? -Of course not!
Horse-dealer. Did you say Musashi?
does he live here?
now I fully understand you
I will not force my ideas on you
however, will you be good enough to see my Master?
but, I am to fight a duel tonight. -A duel?
it will be the memorable match of my life. -Who's your man?
Kojiro Sasaki. -Sasaki?
you mean it?
I hear he may be employed by my Master
what? Is Kojiro...
Miyamoto, if you win...
...please certainly accept my offer
must you fight?
Hey, kid! Where is Musashi?
l have decided to leave on a journey
let me please postpone the promised match for a year
when we meet again, I will be quite ready...
to vie with you. Yours truly
why do you cry? -I don't like it
that Kojiro as Hosokawa's teacher!
I dreamt of worldly success once
I thought it was natural to settle down
but now I want to train myself further
Jotaro, I'm hungry. Let's eat, shall we?
Kuma. I'm your senior, am I not?
call me Master Jotaro
I say... Master Jotaro. -What is it?
a man should be kind to his juniors
let's eat, shall we? Shall we?
drop the reins. Or we'll shoot
surrender your swords
step back
how did you reach here safely? -We met brigands
nothing happened? -We won a horse
they appear often? -More than often, sir. They ruin us
they steal our crops, they steal our women
we're at their tender mercy
many have left this village for safety
imagine. They won a horse! Isn't it something?
have you an axe to cut down trees?
master. Why fell trees?
build a hut. -What for, Master?
we'll live here. And plough
what about fencing practice? -We'll continue as we plough
brace up!
hurry up will you, girls? They'll be angry
Hurry! They seem like rich people. We'll get rich!
rich - nothing! The keeper'll become rich
we'll become thinner. -The greedy pimp!
hurry up!
you're free, Hanagiri? -Let me breathe
we're short of one girl for five customers. Hanagiri!
keeper. Do all your girls wear bells?
no, sir, she's the only one. Tinkles around like a kitten
Hanagiri, you say? Bring her. At once
you have a quick ear. -Reminded of someone?
you win! We'll stick to drinks then
so it's you
you laugh at me. Don't you?
I'm not that heartless. -I know you. Worse than that
I didn't even touch you. -lt was your vanity
had I not loved him, you'd have...
probably. Come here and pour us drinks
she cares for Musashi
unrequited love. See her now!
stop!
I may be soiled but my heart is pure
is it? I'll tell you where he is now
he ploughs at Hoten Field in Shimosa
care to go? -No joking, sir
if she goes, I'll suffer a big loss. -Keeper
enough?
just a farmer
a woman? -What?
what a find!
stop! I saw her first. Didn't l?
a girl. -Brigands again!
why - Otsu!
why - Jotaro!
more loot
master! -What, we eat now?
big news! Otsu came! -Otsu?
lord Yagyu of Edo told her, she says. How did he know about us?
bring me something to wear
she's washing her face now to make herself presentable
will you hurry?
I missed you
I thought you were mad at me. -But why?
I was to blame
it was sudden. So...
you forgive me?
I won't leave you again!
that's the hut we built
we three live in it
and we have tilled those patches of land
it was barren. But it is yielding crops lately thanks to our labor
in the old days I hated farm work
and was daydreaming always
wanting to become famous and successful
vainly and at random
now I'm tilling again. Isn't it strange?
I'm beginning to learn the value of life
the soil has taught me that
Jotaro
cook something for Otsu. I'll ask old Gen to house her
are you very happy to see him again?
he's still angry about me. -What happened?
listen, Jotaro. -Master Jotaro
Yes, sir. I don't understand him at all
me, neither. He's carving again
he told me he'd done something bad to her
can't be true! If so, why would she come here? -Y es
who goes there?
I hate to leave this village. I'll stick to it...
even if I may be killed on that account
please, sir, teach us how to fight
we must fight the brigands away from here!
please, Master!
it's no use teaching you how to fight
if you must learn to run
away from them, sir? -And laugh last
you're going there by yourself? -Yes. I have come alone so far
it's dangerous from here
the way to the next village is infested with bandits
I've known bandits since I was a baby
my father was a brigand, too
isn't my lunch ready yet? -lt is
better disguise yourself as a man
they'll stop any girl
men have made a plaything of me. I don't mind anything now
if I can see him, I'll die content
one moment. Men come here regularly to buy oil and salt
wait till then and go with them. -A good idea
that may be them
give us drinks!
it's bad since those samurai came
I hear they're teaching them fencing. -Who are they?
we've got to destroy them, anyway
this is too small. Bring bigger bowls!
keeper, that your daughter?
Hey, girlie! Come here!
why - you're Akemi!
you're Toji! -Yes, I am
know her? -She's Oko's daughter.
what happened to my mother?
where is she? -I killed her
you were there when she was killed!
you surrendered to save your skin! -Shut up!
I avenged my brother's death. -Avenged?
your mother had killed him. I'm Kohei
but you two had killed my father! -You'll be with him
that's the village
tell them the brigands were all arrested by the officials
understand?
and set Musashi's hut on fire tomorrow evening
we'll attack then. Right?
I can't. Never! No! -Don't be a fool!
Musashi is his enemy. Also mine
he spared you. You must do it
if you won't... I'll have to kill you
don't. You're still sick
but I can't stay idle here. -Stop!
tell me. Tell me what to do now
must I leave? -Well, no
tell me then. Why do you evade me?
you dislike me? Hate me?
have I been erased from your heart?
please!
you're heartless! Stony-hearted! I hate such a man! -But...
I can't live!
I wish I were dead! -Don't be stupid
I am stupid! Watch what a stupid girl does!
what are you doing?
so. She's here
this is because of her. That dame!
I'm sorry. -Old Gen can accommodate another person
Otsu won't like it. Neither will Akemi
I think I'll go ask Aunt Oseki
I'll do that for you. -Me, too
at last we're alone
why don't you like it?
you have changed, Akemi
but I like your tone. I'm so glad
darling! I have loved you since we lived in the hills
I really cared for you. -You don't mean that
but I mean it. I tried to tell you when you were trapped last time
I didn't understand you
darling... elope with me
won't you? -Stop it
oko, your mother, asked me to do that once
her blood is in your veins
no. I'm different. I'm not like her at all
I never loved men till I met you
I've never loved anybody but you, darling
that's why I came here
I'm sorry
it's not your fault
you have Otsu. I shouldn't be unreasonable
I will leave in the morning
be happy with her. Good luck
darling. It's hard!
but I give you up! I promise
so hold me tightly before I go!
choke me to death! In your arms!
as your last favor!
men! I heard on my way here...
that all the brigands were arrested. -Really?
the whole town's talking. -lf they're arrested, we are safe
Akemi said that? -Serves 'em right. -Now we're saved
Akemi, are you sure about the brigands?
Akemi! Is it true?
you wouldn't believe me
I'll stay here awhile. I like it here
master, did you hear it? Very good news, eh?
did you hear? -Yes, I did. -Let's stop work and celebrate!
she'll signal to us with a fire. Set houses afire!
you kill the villagers
don't take on Musashi. I'll handle him
come with me. We'll talk alone
Where's Otsu?
she's at my home. -She'll play the flute
I'll fetch her
Otsu. You know how a girl feels
I'm in love with him. -Akemi
you are a terrible girl
why must you come between us two?
take it up
if you want him... fight!
how horrible! -Take it up
help! Somebody!
fire! Fire!
Brigands! Brigands!
calm down! Quiet! Take women and kids to Old Gen's.
Musashi! Come out! Fight with me!
Musashi, I'm here to avenge my brother's death!
brace up, Kuma!
Jotaro... you're... truly my senior
Akemi!
well done!
what are you doing?
Akemi! Brace up!
Otsu. I'm dying now
I've been so wicked. -Oh, no!
you saved my life! Don't die! Akemi!
darling!
at last...
you hold me...
in your arms. -Brace up, Akemi!
it's all over with me
I can't even... see you
be happy together, you two
Musashi! Where is Master Musashi?
l have been officially employed as Lord Hosokawa's teacher...
and will leave for Kokura, his Castle Town
I am desirous to have the match at Kokura, April next.
my Master's so unreasonable to leave you like this
after all, he prefers fencing to me
Kokura Town, Lord Hosokawa's country seat "Our Lord's Retainer Kojiro Sasaki will fight by command..."
"with Musashi Miyamoto of Mimasaku Province."
Musashi. In five days, eh?
fight fair and square, like a real samurai
he is a peerless match, sir. I will not spoil your honorable name
in four days
he's busy. But I am his childhood friend
an intimate friend
I was with him at the fencing school
he'll remember my name without fail
they ignored me while I was jobless
but today even strangers want to see me
such is life. -But it's something for rejoicing
your prowess will be acknowledged, definitely
after the match, another big event
my daughter is impatient
please, Otsu! Let me find my Master
please. Why have I come all this way?
in this match he might meet the worst
if so, I'll gather his remains
so I must see him. I must speak to him!
from Musashi, sir?
l will arrive in my own boat in time
I hope this is satisfactory
I see. He didn't come here out of respect
he'll go directly to the isle
but where is he?
brace up, Otsu
what happened? -She's sick
Omitsu
you look pensive
think I'll lose? -Oh, no
you may not expect it but you're afraid
I'll win. To defeat him has been my ambition
I'll defeat him with my own ability
prayers of those who wish me victory and talismans...
are useless to me
therefore don't pray for me, dear
sympathy harms my mental tranquility
I want to fight alone
return to the castle
now I feel relieved
Hey, Sasuke. Is it ready? -Sure
it's an honor for a boatman to row for Master Musashi
the boat's been purified
thank you for the kind gift I wear now
I feel so refreshed. -Good luck, sir
one moment. I want you to see someone before you leave. -Me?
don't bother to get up
Otsu!
I can't see him like this
master!
don't come in! I'm coming!
Otsu. -At last we meet again
you look weak. Very ill? -I'm cured now
my illness is so whimsical, you know
let's take a walk, shall we, Otsu?
this is the first time you ever asked me
let's. Of course
until today I've walked my own way...
and made you suffer a lot
forgive me. But I'm not as heartless as I may seem
I know. -You do?
that's why I've loved you
darling!
what a lucky day it is today!
I can fight with clear conscience now
why do you cry?
I hate it
I wish you weren't a samurai!
darling, abandon your sword. Don't fight!
let them call you a coward! I crave for happiness, just us two!
that's impossible now, Otsu
please! I won't let you go! Oh no!
don't be unreasonable
I'm a woman
I wish you had been an ordinary man
Otsu, don't demoralize me, please
a samurai's wife sends off her man with a smile
especially when it might be for good
is that the lsland? -No, sir, that's not it
our island lies beyond that. A smaller one
is this where a sea-battle was fought in olden times?
what is that for, sir?
for the duel
fight with a wooden one? -I like the size
listen. If I lose and fall...
take my dead body back...
to Otsu -Dear God!
don't talk rot! -Take this as my memento
Musashi's boat is sighted!
Musashi is coming! -Musashi has come!
don't be nervous
you'll see the mysterious power of my sword
watch me
Musashi!
Mr. Miyamoto. That was splendid
he was the best fencer I will ever encounter
I'm so glad. I'm so glad!
I was praying so I wouldn't bring you back dead
I'm so glad about it all. I'm so happy!

Oh! Damnit!

I open the door, dog charges after you.
I get in the bedroom, slam the door.
you beat the dog out the front. Go downstairs.
climb back up the fire escape, help me carry the guy down. It's simple.
why don't you be the decoy?
because, at U. W.You ran the 40 in 4. 5. --4. 3.
OK, last digit on the serial number.
I hate dogs. Just as much as I hate you.
on 3.
you're gonna be ok.

not today.
you're safe now, ok?
well, just, um, tell my father that I'm on a shift, you know?
Oh, I'm sure it's important, mary, or he wouldn't have had his assistant call.
I'll stop by if things slow down.
Hey.
your guy's tropes came back positive.
I scheduled an angio, but...
with his weight, it's only a matter of time before he's back.
what?
Oh, that thing you do with your hair when you're uncomfortable.
I'm not uncomfortable.
Yeah.
whatever.
so how are you, allie?
about the same as when you saw me yesterday, wyatt.
Ah, exactly my point! See, it's been a year since I got back and we hardly see each other outside the yard.
the schedule is brutal.
we both have days off.
which you spend gambling.
Hey, what I do is not gambling. It's, um, risk assessment.
I can't believe that's all you want.
playing poker and driving an ambulance.
we do everything you do.
we just do it at 60 miles an hour.
while standing on your head.
forget it.
let's grab coffee and catch up on the past.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
lookin' for you.
this is wyatt, wyatt cole.
this is dr. Manyard.
of course, martin's kid. The prodigal son.
I was a student of your father's.
he's a giant.
I'm sure I don't have to tell you that.
Oh, we had to raise all the doorways in our house.
didn't you two go to med school together?
the first 2 years.
and then?
I flunked sucking up.
yo, wyatt, work calls.
Hi. Are your mommy and daddy home?
I don't have a mommy or daddy.
is that the ambulance? let them in.
he passed out. I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to wake him.
he dead?
they're trying to save him.
what's your name, little man?
we call him Q.
OK, Q.
why don't you take your, uh
she's my aunt.
OK, why don't you take your aunt and take her to the next room? All right.
he's not breathing much on his own. Do you want to tube him?
no, let him hit him with the narcan first.
who the hell are you people?
we're the welcome wagon.
what are you doing in my apartment? Marissa!
sir, you're gonna need to go to the hospital with us
I ain't going nowhere with you!
did I tell you to call 911?
you were out!
I thought you were dying!
do I look like i'm dying?
Hey, sir, why don't you let us take you in for observation?
I told you, if I want a ride, I will call a cab.
sir, can you at least sign the paper saying you refused treatment?
I ain't going anywhere with you!
can I go with you?
Hey, why aren't you in school, quentin? Are you sick?
you a doctor?
you like doctors?
no.
good. Neither do we.
hey...
how'd you get these?
I was bad.
what happened?
nothing.
he's always making up stories.
he didn't make those up.
sometimes he just loses control.
he don't mean nothing by it.
just don't say anything, ok?
just go.
Marisa! --Please.
and the boy has contusions on his rib cage, which appear to be the result of abuse.
there are also narcotics in the home.

child services should have a looksie.
OK, annie. Thanks.
I'm working , so I only have a minute.
this won't take long.
your mother wanted me to remind you that today's your last day to reapply for medical school.
mom did?
miss this deadline, you lose all your credits, start from scratch.
you already have 2 prodigies in the family, dad.
isn't that enough?
course, robbie has an ulcer and molly's the therapy poster child.
and you're what?
the happy failure?
what you have isn't a career, wyatt.
it's a hobby.
look at your friend alice.
she's already practicing.
let's leave her out of it.
she's leaving you behind, son.
life's a race, and you're lagging.
Yeah. First to the finish line dies.
you have no excuses.
you've been privileged.
you've had every option.
you availed yourself to none of them.
I don't understand what you want.
right now?
uh, 10, 000 bucks. That'd do it.
are you are aware that the dsm has a diagnosis for gambling disorders?
I read it.
it lists 10 symptoms of the pathological gambler.
you need 5 to qualify.
I only have 3, so they just consider me a problem gambler.
I'm working very hard at it.
I'll give you half.
if you send in the application.
bribery, nice touch.
uh, I need the money today.
the application has to be postmarked by midnight.
I can't be his son.
in his world, you don't become a doctor, you don't exist.
hell, maybe he's right.
come on. Doctorsaren't doctors anymore.
they're plumbersand bureaucrats.
they do the samething we do.
they just get paid10 times as much.
just face it, wyatt.
you became a medic so you could tell your dad to shove it.
Oh, thank you, dr. Phil.
I suppose you became one to do good works.
this thing is always about fathers and sons, always.
be right back.
Hey, sorry we're late.
don't apologize to me.
he really wanted to see you.
we got side-tracked.
it's 11: 15.
Clare, people don't get sick on schedule.
it's not my job to make excuses for you anymore.
that's not what I'm asking you to do.
come on, sack, we got a big old bad one.
look, can you just...
I got this for him.
fine.
I told you, wyatt.
you don't tempt the gods.
wrap a c-spine in the stretcher.

God must be pissed at me.
Where's triage?
what you got here?
help me right now!
my son, he's dying!
Oh, god!
Oh, no!
I'll take care of it.
we'll work on the guy in the car.
Hey, you ok?
can you hear me?
Hey, hello, can you hear me?
I couldn't stop.
save your breath.
couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
OK, I'm just gonna slide the board underneath.
get his jacket off.
Harper, move now!
pulse is fast and weak.
breathing shallow, and what there is of it is 100 proof.
OK, I'm gonna take over.

start a line.

possible tension pneumothorax.

you're not taking him anywhere.
sir, please get out of our way.
this guy is a murderer!
you guys are trying to save his life?
know what I say?
let him die.
right here, right now.
sir, you interfere with us and-- - hey, you know what, partner? No.
let him. You want to lynch him, go ahead, be my guest.
be just like the old days.
and then you can watch while his lungs shut down, while he loses control of his bladder, while his heart beats his last beat.
that'll change everything, right?
only thing it'll really change is you.
is that what you want?
Whoa! Careful, buckaroo.
about to thread the needle.
Hey, it's no fun if it's easy.
nice work back there with the crowd.
that was easy, man.
this is hard.
we better call the coroner.
I'm so sorry.
you have to do more!

I wish we could.

he's critical, you gotta take him.
do you want him to die while he's waiting in a hallway?
Wendy, the police will be here any minute to talk to the guy.
I don't care.
what do I have to do?
call the chief of medicine?
I'll see what I can do.
you're using your father to extort this patient into my E. R?
your E. R? I didn't see your name on the door, fleming.
we have no room.
Hey, he's got tension pneumothorax.
he's got possible internal injuries. - I don't need your diagnosis.
schedule him in.
in the future, you just get them here.
we'll decide who to treat and how.
I need to talk to you.
all I got is time.
when?
Hi.

and that means you have no privileges.
that's what I love about you, angela, the small acts of kindness.
he's the whitest white boy in america.
every time he looks at me it's like he's waiting for me to break into the mexican hat dance.
Hey, naheem. Marry off your daughters, yet?
if only you were indian.
that would solve one of my problems.
4 single daughters is a heavy load to bare.
I heard a rumor today.
N. M.R. Was buying us out.
is that true?
N. M.R. They jump our calls, undercut our business.
what are you gonna do?
we wait.
it may be our karma to go on.
maybe not.
so karma's like fate, you have no control?
not at all.
there's free will in karma.
to be responsible for your karma
that's strength.
you always have a choice.

of course not.
you're doing that for your father.
but it could have shaped your perspective.
I doubt it.
she breaks your heart.
your drop out of med school, move to hawaii, to lick your wounds for a couple of years.
by the time you return, she's become a doctor, and you still a piece of...
you don't think she'll take you more seriously if you become more serious?

Wyatt, you have something you want to say to me?

Why?
I don't know.
I didn't know then, I don't know now.

step into my office.
God!
hold on, hold on.

actually, I have something to tell you.
you're such a dork.
unexpected.
I wish that was what is was.
Oh, god!
I don't know how to say other to just...say it.
Daniel asked me to move in with him.
What'd you say?
uh...I meant to tell you earlier.
the day's--the day's just been so insane, and...
I know you're upset.
no, I'm not upset.
Why?
you don't know him.
he's kind.
he's a brilliant surgeon.
give me a break! - And he makes me feel safe.
safe how?
safe for democracy?
safe harbor?
that's nice.
safe at first base.
don't engage.
make fun of it.
nothing's safe in this world.
that's why you and I... - I see it everyday.
a woman wakes up in the morning.
she looks out her window and she sees its raining, so she decides to take her son to the movies.
and they're walking in the park, and they're happy.
and out of nowhere, a car out of control , wham, hits her son.
there's no safety in the world.
everything's risk.
love is a risk.
that's so romantic, and such bullshit.
Oh, you're so smart.
love isn't risk.
it's commitment.
a concept you don't grasp.
Really?
you left me. Remember?
you were already gone.
you were out, looking for the next game.
God! What I want now is a place where the earth doesn't move!
where I know where I stand.
where I feel-- I'm not ashamed to say it--safe!
safe!

Ah, it's probablya wrong number.

how did you get this scar?
give me the phone, man. I'm a cop. It could be important.
cop? Shit.
Zack. Zack, come on, man.
what are you doing?
sorry. I don't do cops.
Oh, I was kidding.

I'm not a cop, I'm a secretary at a law firm, and the guys I work for will sue your ass if you leave me here.
nice knowing you.
No! Zack! You shithead!
shit! Shit!
shit! Shit!
Gus, my leg's going to sleep. Move.

Where's zack? - Please. Ham.

who's zack?
Oh, perfect.
and what's his signature doing there?
Earl... help me out of these cuffs.
wish I could, grace, but I can'T.
key's right there. Right there.
God would throw a flag for interference.
somebody's dead, earl.
and some asshole killed them, and that asshole's walking around having a nice day.
not if god has anything to say about it.
you can teach me a lesson some other time. Right now...
I got to get to work.
well, as do I, grace, but it looks like one of us is gonna be late.
Yep.
sure gonna be nice having you in one place for a while.
so, what you want to talk about?
you already removed the body?
Yes, I already removed the body.
uh, male victim. Hard to tell what age.
Yeah, hard to tell.
shit! Jesus christ.
didn't see much except you jumping out of your boots, cowboy!
sparrow seen flying from the scene! We got an A. B.B on him!
All-bird bulletin.

what? They made me do it.
I'm serious, man. Get that thing out of there. Get it out!
were you attacked by a small bird when you were little?
no, I just don't like small birds. Okay?
don't do that, henry.
and I didn't bust your frigging vince young bobblehead, yo.
Hey, i dusted the prints yesterday.
I found two sets of prints -- you and grace.
Oh, must have been the time I tried to shove it up your ass.
Where's grace?
where is grace?
she got tied up.
okay. I've got blood away from the victim over here, which usually means the killer cut himself, but that's written in blood.
drops could be spillage from that.
she was tortured.
Yeah.
these slash marks -- none of them are fatal.
the killer spent some time hurting her.
they're all over her face and shoulders.
she hasn't been dead very long.
rigor hasn't fully set in.
lots of anger, stabbing -- usually a person
but this evil shit on the wall...
looks like a purse dump.
any I. D?
no.
purses always get to me.
I think about my sisters.
check it out.
she worries about money, bad breath, smokes pot
chocolate for the munchies -- goes to bars.
beer cantina.
beer cantina.
isn't that where you and darleen spent your honeymoon?
handwritten numbers.
looks like seven of them.
could be a phone number.
seven smudged numbers.
good thing you go to church, rhetta.
it'll take a miracle to decipher that.
so, grace is where?
she's gonna want to see this.
Yeah, I imagine she would.
I left you a message on your cell.
where are you?
you need to see this crime scene.
it's brutal. I hope everything's okay. Call me.
and why is ham being so pissy?
Earl? - Yep.
are you eating something?
I had to go to the middle east.
I got a hankering for some of mustafa's tabbouleh.
caught him right before he closed up shop.
okay. Look.
I admit I messed up.
could use a little more lemon.
you must be getting awful hungry.
open wide.
what -- what is this crap?
best tabbouleh on the planet.
well, this planet.
they got some good tabbouleh on paxtibar
little planet about a trillion zillion miles from earth.
Paxtibarians take great pride in their tabbouleh
kind of like you guys and oil.
are you finished?
with my tabbouleh?
look, I learned my lesson.
in your head, that means, next time, you hold the cuff key.
what do you want, earl?
what do I have to do to get out of these things?
start leadinga different life?
buy self-releasable handcuffs?
I need to get to work.
Yes, you do.
so unlock these handcuffs so I can go to work.
well, you're talking about your job.
I'm talking about your life and the work you need to do on it.
you got to get ready, grace.
for what?
for whatever plan god has for you.
I'm ready, okay? I'm ready!
I don't know about that, my girl.
want to watch tv?
Oprah's on.

a switchblade, 3,maybe 4 inches long.
Bobby's trying to track it down.
victim have a name?
not yet.
there's nothing in missing persons, and we can't put out a picture.
look, she was wearing, uh, this necklace.
Bobby and butch canvassing the area?
Yes, ma'am.
what about grace?
I don't know.
you don't know where your partner is? Has she checked in?
I think it was family stuff. I'm sure she's fine.
did you speak to her?
where is she?
she's home -- I think.
you think?
Bobby? Go by grace's house.
make sure she's okay.
lost my favorite t-shirt on that bet.
it had a pictur eof golda meir, pre -'67, embroidered on the pocket.
I knew I should have taken the over, but I always beena sucker for the underdog.
it goes with the territory, I guess.
well, who ever heard of a war lasting only six days?
please answer the phone, earl.
can't. Boss doesn't like us doing phone surveillance.
sure would make life easier.
Hey, it's doug.

you are not going to believe what your favorite nephew did.
here's a hint -- he's grounded until thanksgiving. Call me.
I'd like to bea fly on the wall for that you talking to a kid about something he's done wrong.
Earl, take your damn wings and flap your smart ass back to egypt.
and while you're there, tell mustafa his tabbouleh sucks.
Oh, shit.
this is the third time I've called you.
you're either dead or someplace with earl, so call me.

I think I'm onto something.
Doug? Call me, man.

Hey, luke!
Hanadarko, baby.
Where's my 5 bucks?
shit, man. You cheated.

nude female, maybe 25.
hard to tell --her face was so cut up.

bad morning.
I called you three times. - I know.
I-I brought you something to say I'm sorry.

Hey, doug.
Yeah, I'll be here.
okay, man. I'll see you then.
he is really upset with clay about something.

Earl whittles? - Yeah.
he's not exactly channeling michelangelo, is he?
I also brought... this.
Earl drinks while he whittles.
our warehouse jane doe -- bottle's from a similar case.
did you stop by the crime scene?
the blood on the wall is the victim'S.
what case is this?
why doesn't it havean evidence tag on it?
Oh, no. Forget it.
I didn't steal it. I got 100% legally.
somebody's already dusted it for prints.
maybe you could get dna off the mouth of the bottle.
you think you know this guy.
why is all the earl shit out?
don't change the subject.
I'll tell you when I piece it together.
the earl shit --what are you doing?
theorizing.
about how to get rid of him, I hope.
what if all this stuff means something.
what if it's likea language -- a language of symbols, a language of angels.
what if I sneeze and a 1965 mustang comes flying out my butt?
what?
wonder if earl has ever left anything behind for leon cooley.
if he did, doesn't matter.
on death row, you'd be lucky if they don't confiscate your used toilet paper.
Hey, I may havea missing-persons match.
guy coming in, his daughter's description as good fit with our victim.
what about the canvass?
some grocers down the street saw a dark S. U.V. Around midnight.
didn't see anyone.
butch is out shaking down one of his C. I.S.
why'd the killer choose this warehouse? Who owns it?
japanese company who's name I can't pronounce.
pork chop.
I owe you an apology.
you owe your team an apology.
where were you this morning?
I took some personal time.
why didn't you call in?
I should have. Why didn't you?
and why shouldn't i bench your ass?
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
don't you dare.
should I be worried about you?
no. I have rhetta for that.
this is your friend talking, grace. Should I be worried?
it's just family stuff.
God, that's the same bullshit ham just tried to feed me.
no bullshit.
my brother-in-law's coming in. We got to talk about my nephew. Really.
what's going on with ham?
what about him?
well, he's pissed at you, and I don't think it'sover paperwork you didn't do.
whatever crapis going on off the job, that shit will get you killed on the street, so fix it, grace, or I'm gonna reassign you both new partners, and that is not your friend talking.
that's your captain.
whatever you want to say to me, ham, say it.
I'm so sick of your shit.
what shit are you sick of, ham? Be specific.
who the hell was that guy? Someone you met at a bar?
grocery store.
look, what the hell are you doing?
what I'm not doing is explaining any part of my life to you.
you sleep with every guy you meet, is that it?
only the ones willing to give me a ride home.
you know, you can be such a bitch!
listen, you judgmental asshole, you got out of your wife's bed hoping for a quickie before we hit the crime scene.
I'm sorryI wasn't available.
Mr. Duncan.

this is ella.
we have breakfast every wednesday -- pancakes.
anyway, she's never been late, let alone not show up.

last night. - What time last night?
I just told you.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
look, my wife, she went by ella's apartment and her work.
her work, her work. She works at mercy hospital.
she didn't show up today.
do you know if ella had plans last night?
she was going out with friends.
did you speak with any of them today?
her best friend, jennifer.
she hasn't talked with ella either.
I know that I'm supposed to wait 24 hours, but...
but ella -- well, this is -- well, she wouldn't do this.
she'd call me.
Mr. Duncan...
does this mean anything to you, sir?
why do you have this?
do you recognize it?
no. Oh, no.
it's not the first time this guy's done this.
he enjoyed it. You get a look at the victim?
Yeah. I got a hit in vicap from 11 years ago.

went out with her friends last night.

Where'd you get this.
the internet.
I walked in on clay while he was watching this.
it's his turn now.
Hey, claire.
you want a piece of pie?
do you believe that?
What'd he say?
he was with friends.
they were doing it.
lame shit.
I know he feels bad about it.
it's not like clay. I don't get it.
it could have something to do with me.
I'm kind of dating someone.
kind of?
well, actually, I'm dating someone kind of seriously.
that's great.
we ever gonna meet her? What's her name?
Lisa. - Last name? I want to run her.
okay. Take your chances.
no, but you're gonna love her, grace.
I mean, she know smore about football than I do.
she loves to bowl, hunt, makes me laugh, and she's smart.
can't wait.
you know she'll never take the place of your sister.
shit, doug. It's been 12 years.
Mary frances has been wondering what took you so long.
well, I -- seems -- I think clay's having a hard time with it.
it seems like he likes her, but...
I don't know.
it's the only thing I can think why my son's turning into such a jerk.
I'll talk to him.
I want you to put the fear of god into him.
I'll do what uncle bud did to me when I set the convent on fire.
uncle bud the texas ranger?
What'd he do?
Jennifer, thanks for meeting me.
I'm sorry I have to do this now, but I need you to go through last night for me.
it was your birthday?
it's not your fault your friend is dead.
what do you want to know?
everything from the time you met ella to the time you left her
what you did, where you were, who you talked to.
did anyone buy you drinks?
anyone go outside to smoke a cigarette or a joint or to get laid?
nothing you say can surprise meor get you in trouble.
it was your birthday --four best friends out to party.
I' been there, okay?
so just be honest with me.
uh, we met at 8: 00 at this restaurant downtown
aunt sassy'S.
do you know if he gave ella his phone number?
Yeah, uh, I saw him.
he wrote it on a matchbook?
no.
he put it in her cellphone, but, um, there was another guy.
they were dancing.
I think they went outside for a while.
how come they went outside?
to smoke a joint.
we were all pretty wasted.
Ella talk to anyone?
this cute guy from new york.
he's visiting his sister.
he bought us drinks.
you remember if he paid with cash or credit card?
cash. He...
told us he never used plastic 'cause he likes the way money feels in his pants.
you know his name?
how old is he?
our age, uh... 25 maybe.
she wouldn't have left with him.
even if she was drunk?
no way.
Ella may have taken his phone number, but all of us, we think it's crazy to go home with some guy you meet in a bar.
maybe. I mean, she could have.
we've picked up guys before.
we know it's stupid.
let's go back to aunt sassy'S.
you were having a good time, drinking a lot.
you notice anybody else?
anybody watching you guys?
there was an older guy at the bar.
Ella thought he was sexy. He was kind of watching us.
how old?
I don't know, 40, 45.
will you work with us on a sketch?
sure.
why the hell should I talk to you about anything?
I thought maybe because I'm a friend of detective hanadarko'S.
so what?
and becauseI know about earl.
you know shit about earl.
actually, mr. Cooley, technically, that's not true.
Mr. Cooley?
what do you know about earl?
I know he's an angel.
he your last-chance angel?
no.
you haven't met him?
no, sir.
but I know he takes you places, and I was wondering if you ever come back with anything.
a migraine.
anything else?
why do you want to know?
because maybe the things you come back with mean something.
and how do you know that, cop?
you a cop?
no, sir.
I'm a person who believes god has brought earl to save my friend.
Earl's some... heavy-duty help.
she kill somebody?
just you.
only thing I ever brought backI got with me right here.
you got a tattoo with earl?
in cuba.
holy redeemer. Is that your church?
never heard of it.
me and earl went out drinking.
couple mojitos later, we both get tattoos.
Earl has a tattoo? Where?
tell detective hanadarkoto ask him.
that way, I ever see you again and you know the answer,
I'll know you ain't full of shit.
thank you.
till then, you'll just be a pretty lady I can spend some of my loneliest hours...
thinking about.
friend of mine says he saw an S. U.V. Last night -- maroon.
he told me it was parked outside the warehouse.
some dude was helping a girl puke.
this friend get a description?
Yeah. She was a hot blonde.
not her, razor -- of the dude.
no. It was too dark.
well, this shit ain't worth 50 bucks and a tank of gas.
it was 60, and, uh, this next shit will be.
my friend got the plate.
of the S. U.V?
what's the something?
he thinks a letter.
maybe a B.
so it's, like, one of 22 letters.
26 - 26?
pretty sure.
good job, razor.
BUTCHIE? What?
I'm thinking, how about instead of the cash, then, um,
I could go over to your place and make you supper?
and then I could give you a massage.
you know what I'm saying?
I'm afraid I know exactly what you're saying.
this pans out, I owe you a tank of gas.
when you gonna tell them?
tell them what?
why you got that scar on your back.
I can't tell what I don't remember.
well, you remember waking up with a sliced shoulder.
you remember moving out of your house a month later, bought this place.
you ain't gonna tell them. You ain't ready.
get up, girl. No.
rematch. Wrestling.
I win, you tell them.
you win, you get to carry that secret long as you want.
you cheat. Fine.
we'll do it your way, then. Here.
what the hell am I supposed to do with this?
bang your head against it for couple more decades, grace.
I got to get back to france.
shit.
what are you doing here so early?
what are you doing here so early?
no, you. What are you doing here?
family stuff.
I didn't bust your vince young bobblehead.
figure it's ham.
it's not ham.
I'm not ever gonna know, am I?
if I figure it out, I'll tell you.
I just need to be careful.
me too.
will i ever get another one?
you want another one?
a guy can't ever get enough bobbleheads.
Thanks.
I'll take it from here.
take a seat.
give me your right arm.
act like a tough guy...
you get treated like one.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
I-I know it was stupid.
I can handle stupid, clay.
we're all stupid sometimes.
what I can't handle...
is mean --being violent.
aunt grace?
my name is detective hanadarko.
and if you like watching yourself so much, great.
let's watch. - Hey, claire.
you want a piece of pie?
that is assault, clay.
Claire could press charges against you, and you don't even need to go to trial because the evidenceis right here.
that is her name, isn't it?
let me hear you say it.
so, what do you say we watch you assault clairea few more times?
Hey, claire. You want a piece of pie?
ready to see it again?
Hey, claire. You want a piece of pie?
bartender remembers jerry from new york. He's been coming in every night for a week.
but not last night? - No, I'm checking the airlines.
what about the older guy from aunt sassy's?
he show up at the bar?
Yeah, the bartender doesn't remember him.
shit! Shit!
retaliation for the, uh, vince young bobblehead.
he thinks I did it.
guess so.
I think we got something here.
remember those grocers saw a dark S. U.V. Outside the warehouse?
butch has another witness saw a guy near a maroon S. U.V. Around midnight, helping a girl throw up.
how we doing on the wrap-up?
who's your witness, benny?
street kid I've known for a while.
he gave me the tag --kate, some letter, and 2.
so I ran every letter in the alphabet, found three that are close.
Kateb25 -- a taurus, belongs to a 25-year-old girl, no record.
Katee2 --woman's husband bought a jag, so she got one, too --no record.
and kater2 -- an S. U.V. Leased to tolliver catering.
Jeremy tolliver's the owner --no record.
could be the sketch.
could be the guy'snot from new york at all.
do we know where he works?
he's got a catering truck, works the I-35 industrial corridor.
butch and bobby at his house?
no one's home. They're talking to his neighbors.
I don't think he's our guy.
based on what?
the hit we got in vicap happened in 1996.
Jeremy tolliver was 15.
15-year-old could have been in a bar, had a girl take him home.
doubt it.
look, the restaurant-supply store's right down the street from the warehouse.
he buys stuff there for his catering truck.
that's how he knew about it.
look, I-if his S. U.V. Was there, we got to talk to him. I just think we should ask who else drives it.
well, you got another suspect?
not yet.
then what the hell do you have, grace?
or is that none of my business, too?
and what the hell'swith you?
detectives?
state trooper spotted the catering truck.
Bobby and butch are on their way.
this is the address. You are their backup.
are they gonna be safe?
he looks just like the other sketch.
check out the orange apron.
Jeremy was at the emergency room last night.
he burned his hand.
think that's his stepbrother, scott.
he's staying with him right now, getting a divorce.
Jeremy drive his S. U.V. To the emergency room?
his wife drove him in her car.
ran down his employees.
his stepbrother was arrested five days ago.
domestic abuse -- beat his wife, threatened her with a switchblade.
Hey, we're seizing this truckin payment for back taxes.
you want to step out?
step out of the truck now. Come on. Drop it.
let's go. Hands behind your back.
spread them.
illegal knife.
you're under arrest.
what you in for?
well, you're in the slammer, you must've done something bad.
I -- I pushed a pie into a girl's face.
her name is claire.
you always been such a tough guy?
I don't think so.
why'd you do it?
I don't know, sir.
sure you do.
we almost always know why we do things.
we just don't always like fessing up to it.
maybe becauseI wanted to be cool.
you ain't the first to have that come back and bite you.
who's taking a crack at this guy?
I need to do it alone.
why alone?
because I owe all of you an apology.
get rhetta for me, will you?
11 years ago, a girl picked you up in a bar.
she took you home.
you had sex.
you took your knife and cut her across the shoulder.
do you remember?
no. - Yes, you do.
it was your first.
what happened?
why'd you leave this?
did you get scared?
did you scare yourself?
it wasn't me.
five months later, you got married...
hoping a wife might fix this urge you got.
but it's been simmering, hasn't it?
all these years.
and five days ago...
it boiled over.
you went after your wife.
and what you did to ella duncan -- you're not scared anymore.
soon as I saw the word evil on the warehouse wall,
I knew there was a d somewhere because you did the same thing in my bedroom behind a door.
what is this evil/devil bullshit, scott?
your mommy call you an evil little boy?
call you the devil?
tell you women are evil?
especially women who go to bars? - All I had to do...
was buy you one drink.
bourbon and coke. Right?
right.
you were drunk when you walked in.
asked me to light your cigarette.
we played pool.
bending over to take your shot, you stuck your ass right in my face.
do you remember?
I don't remember you.
where we met...
how I got home -- the whole night is a blackout.
next day, I drove to tulsa, got treatment, filed a report.
what I didn't tell them was my name...
or that I was a cop...
or that you left a beer bottle at my house.
I got your fingerprints.
I ran them every week.
but until five days ago, you'd never been arrested.
we found a fingerprint in the warehouse, too.
you weren' tas careful as you thought.
she was a whore.
just like you.
I want to tell claire...
that I'm really sorry for what I did.
the important thing is that we learn from our mistakes.
here you go, gus man.
shit! Earl!
remember this?
Yes.
why are we back?
I was wrong.
you are making progress.
inch at a time maybe, but that's okay.
I'm proud of you.
you shouldn't be.
God doesn't sweat the small stuff.
this is the small stuff?
well, he kind of works on a sliding scale.
he let me live, but not ella duncan. Why?
I don't know.
ask him.
Scott tolliver let you live, grace, and killed ella.
ask him.
all I know is you got big things, big responsibilities ahead.
and what you done today...
well, it's a --it's a big step, girl.
kind of makes me feel like dancing a jig.
shall we?
what are you saying?
God's got plans with your name written all over them.
why would god have my name on anything but his shit list?
better hang on tight!
your life's about to get a little bumpy!
dad! That Was So Cool!
move Out! Move Out!
move Out! Move Out! Move Out!

Hello, Brad. Hello, Ryan.
I want to play a game.
the same woman made you a fool.
manipulating your love for her, and causing nothing but pain.
her fun and games pushed you both to break the law to fulfill her material needs.
she is toxic and today all of your transgressions will be made public.
he's fucking lying, Brad.
now you must choose who will drop out of this triangle, for within 60 seconds one of you must die.
if you wish to save her, then the saws must be pushed all the way to one side or the other sparing her while proving for good who is indeed the alpha male.
what are you fucking staring at, you motherfuckers? Do something!
are you both strong enough to walk away from what is destroying you, or will you fight one more time for the heart that binds?
you have 60 seconds to decide.
live or die. Make your choice.
Oh, Fuck!
do something, please.
Damn!
what the fuck are you doing? It's me or you asshole, and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.
Damn!

you lying slut!
what the fuck are you doing?
you don't love anybody!
you're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you! Fuck you!
Brad! Brad, look at me!
is the chick that fucked me in your bed two days ago worth one of our lives?
she's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.
No! No, stop!
stand aside! Move it!
somebody help her.
game over. No! No, you fucking bitch!
tonight, a house of horrors has been discovered at what used to be known as the Rowan Zoological Institute.
the body of Umbrella Health CEO William Easton has been identified as one of the several victims of this grizzly crime scene.
however, we have also been informed that there may be this deadly event.
hopefully the many questions of the local police, the FBI and the victims family members may be answered by those seven civilians lucky enough to walk away from this unprecedented display of carnage with their lives.
we now go live to Tony Gabrielson who is reporting from the scene. Tony.
Hey, man. Hey, what's up?
what have we got here?
that's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow. What does she want?
all she said was that she didn't trust the FBI, and she didn't trust homicide.- Good...
and she just wants to talk to you.
why me? I don't know. Only you, though.
she looks crazier than a sack full of cats.
all right, let's get this over with.
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.
thank you. You're welcome.
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs...
my colleague said that you wanted to speak with me.
Yes.
but I need complete immunity.
why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?
because of what I know Which is what?
do we have a deal?
you've got to give before you can receive in this house, Jill.
my husband John, he had an accomplice.
a person who assisted him with almost every murder.
look, don't get me wrong.
I'm all ears if you've got something legit that you want to put on the table.
this person will go on killing until he's stopped.
you know him and he definitely knows you.
is that right?
he's detective Mark Hoffman.
are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?
Yes.
you swear to be totally open? You tell me everything, no matter how personal or private?
Yes. I'll give you evidence, whatever you want, as long as I have your protection, and complete immunity.
do we have a deal? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.
welcome back! We're live with Bobby Dagen whose national tour.
s. U.R. V.I. V.E. My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw rolls into town this weekend.
well, you're quite the national phenomenon these days, aren't you?
well, thank you, ma'am.
it's quite flattering how many people have responded to my story.
and if I can help a few people along the way, then I'm pleased.
now, you survived a trap created by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?
Yes, ma'am.
well, everyone must ask you this question. What was that like?
life changing. It was something I never anticipated and, quite honestly, something that should have killed me.
tell me more. Tell me about the actual experience.
I actually have no recollection of how I got there.
I just remember the feeling of waking up trapped.
and I had to insert two hooks into my pectoral muscles and hoist myself up to a platform. You put the hooks in yourself?
I did.
I pretty much realized that I couldn't hold on much longer and I had to accept the fact that I was going to die.
and then I saw something, and what I saw was my life.
it was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.
and right then, something inside me started to grow, something from the bottom of my soul.
and I just...I decided to live.
I found a strength that I thought had long since expired.
and I just yanked, and I yanked!
and when I got to the top, I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.
there was blood everywhere, and I just screamed.
I just sat there and screamed.
because I hadn't just survived,
I was reborn.
this was my life.
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.
Bobby's life-changing experience comes to the...
this is the moment.
Where's the big kiss?- I don't know.
done, friends.
it need not be so...
ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?
where was the big finish, Bobby?
you tell your story, you thank your pretty wife, you bring her out for a big hug and kiss. I just didn't want to push it, all right?
okay, but that's the heart of the story.
she was there for your whole recovery.
and without the acknowledgment, without the kiss, the audience isn't gonna have any kind of emotional connection.
I disagree.
too much emotion, and it's gonna feel like pandering.
okay, why don't you let me do the public relations, and you do the legal paperwork, okay?
okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right? It's my fault. It wasn't your fault, Bobby.
you were fine.
just remember your bullet points next time. I will.
these interviews are important. Nina, relax.
don't worry about them. You were great.
yeah?
your story's real and people feel that.
I know that you get overwhelmed at times, but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.
you were meant to do this.
I know. I know, baby.
Bobby.- Yeah?
we got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.
thirty minutes of face time with other survivors.
Yeah, sounds good. Nothing more exciting than that?
no, not much. Let's go.
Oh, God!
you want to know the only thing wrong with killing you, Jill?
I can only do it once.
Oh, my God!
No!
help me! Help me!
help! Fuck!
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.
the situation you find yourself in is of your own doing.
you, your girlfriend, and your friends are all racists.
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!
you have intimidated others based on their physical differences.
but today it is you who will run scared.
your pathetic friends follow your every word, Evan.
therefore you will be the only one capable of saving them and yourself.
in 30 seconds, the jacks holding up this car will fall, setting off a deadly chain of events.
in order to stop this from happening, you must tear yourself away from the seat to which you are glued.
then you must pull the red lever before you.
but no act comes without a sacrifice.
you've judged others by the color of their skin, and today, Evan, you will learn that we are all the same color on the inside.
live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.
No!
Evan, help! I can't.
do it. Fuck! Fucking do it!
just fucking do it!
do it! Do it, man!
here I go!
Evan, Baby, get me out of here!
shit! Fuck! Here I go!
here I go! Come on!
fuck me!
God! Please!
Evan, please!
God! Do it! Fucking do it!
God!- Do it!
Evan! You got us into this. Get us the fuck out!
do it
you fucking pussy!
shit.
every night I keep thinking that things will get better the next morning when I wake up.
but it isn't.
everything I do, everything I see,
I'm surrounded by these tiny triggers.
they're everywhere, and they remind me of what I went through, what Jigsaw did to me.
Sidney, go on, please You're...
you're in a safe place now.
tell me what happened next.
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!
Sidney, look at me.
you made a decision.
how did that make you feel? free.
he was abusive.
I tried to stop it before, but it wasn't until that moment that I really did something.
it was him or me, and I chose to live. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
that's a bunch of bullshit.
he had to die for you to leave him?
you want to know the best thing that happened to me after having to cut off my own arm?
it's handicapped parking at the damn mall!
what the hell is a camera here for anyway?
I am simply here to illustrate the fact that a traumatic experience, such as the kind that each one of us has been forced to endure can have a positive outcome. That's all.
yeah? Like what? A new perspective on life Wait, wait, wait.
I know. I understand that you're not at that place yet.
I understand that and I respect that.
but if you look around at all these people taking their lives for granted, eventually they all found something positive from their experience.
we should never be ashamed of what we've gone through, because we are good and we are strong!
you know what? I'd like everybody to have a look at something
right here.
these are my scars.
because our minds will heal, but these scars will never go away.
these scars should not be a symbol of shame.
they should be worn as a badge of courage.
you know, earlier, I spoke of valuing your loved ones.
but to be perfectly honest, it's something that I never did prior to my ordeal.
but since then, I have found someone who has truly become my rock.
Joyce,
please.
it's my lovely wife Joyce.
I love you.
love you too, baby.
Bravo.
to be able to sustain such a traumatic experience, and yet find the positive in that grizzly act, it's a remarkable feat indeed.
remarkable, if not a little perverse.
I'm sure I speak for everyone here when I say how grateful we are to be part of your promotional DVD.
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...
I can take that, sir. Thank you very much.
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?
sure. I'll be in the car, okay?
great. You'll see her to the car, please, sir?
of course.- Thank you.
what's up?
so what's with the creepy guy with the cane? Someone I should know about?
no, no, no. He's been at these meetings longer than I have.
he's fine.
all right.
listen, get back to the hotel, and get some rest, all right?
Yeah. Everything's fine. Great work tonight, Bobby.
thank you. You're the man.
Joyce?
what happened to him?
they always tell you not to smoke at the gas station.
this should wrap up the week for you. Great.
what's up, man?
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.
Why?
call came in about a car crash.
car crash? Why are you there?
it's not just a car crash. It's a trap.
how many bodies?
enough pieces to make four.
okay, get everyone away from that crime scene till I get there.
even Homicide, ou got it? Yeah.
all right, I'm on the way.
Hello, Evan. I want to start a game.
the situation you find yourself in...
you, your girlfriend...
you have intimidated others based on their physical differences.
but Today it is you that will be...
so, what do you think?
Why?
why this display?
why them? Why now?
you know he likes to put on a show.
well, there's gotta be something else.
bag the other bodies Get them back to the coroner's office right away.
we'll need them checked for anything resembling a clue.
tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.
if that man has a cavity in his tooth, I want to know about it.
Yes, sir.- All right.
Gibsson.
yeah?
Hoffman was expecting you.
God damn.
Gibson, see yourself
would you look at that?
please get forensics in here. Tell them to haul ass.
this needs to be dusted for prints.
all right.- Okay.
help!
Hello, Bobby.
I want to play a game.
you have amassed wealth, fame, and notoriety, based upon your story of survival.
many have aided in your cause, but few know the truth.
you are a liar.
you and I both know you have never been in a trap, nor have you ever been tested.
today these lies will come full circle and you will learn if you truly have what it takes to call yourself a survivor.
the cage you find yourself in will symbolize your rebirth.
Joyce! No!
Joyce! No...
please no...
within the next 60 minutes, you must stay upon the path of learning and traverse a series of obstacles to obtain access to your wife, who you have also deceived.
if you fail to reach her before the clock runs out, she will die. No.
live or die, Bobby.
make your choice.
Bobby!
help!
let me out!
Bobby! What's going on?
what's going on?
another Jigsaw survivor has come forward. As the city stays crippled in fear from the Jigsaw killings, chilling new words from the latest survivor provide a reminder of the physical and mental toll these deadly games can take.
this horrible event was happening to me, and in that moment, that moment that this thing threatened to take everything away, even the pain,
I realized what I still had left to give.
and I didn't want to let that go.
it gave me light.
that pure moment of absolute horror gave me light.
and as wrong as this may seem, I'm better for enduring it.
I'm stronger. And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.
I'm grateful it happened to me, and I wish the same for everyone like me.
Joan is but one of a growing number of citizens...
if something like that doesn't get you to change your perspective on life,
I don't know what will.
today the survivors joined in.
and if those people weren't so fucked up after their games,
that's a real clever design.
yours or your husband's? Everything was him.
well, here's my problem, that was left for me, and your fingerprints were all over it.
when you told me Hoffman had it in for you, you didn't mention that it was because you tried to kill him.
there's a new game going on. Does that surprise you?
no, No? No?
you're crazy, you know that?
I knew you were crazy the minute I laid eyes on you.
crazy.
okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.
till I catch Mark Hoffman, this is your new home.
get comfy.
what makes you think he can't find me here?
Jill, it's a safe house Safe house. Safe. House.
you get it?
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.
Hoffman knows our location God damn it. God damn it!
what?
we just had a small explosion here in a car at the crime scene.
okay, is anyone hurt?
holy shit!
Roger, you okay? Yeah.
get out of there. You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.
don't touch anything else until it's clean.
got it. All right.
play it.
Hello, Gibson.
been a long time, What I want is simple,
give me Jill Tuck.
you're protecting her despite the fact that she had direct knowledge throughout, which makes her complicit in every death.
I'll make you a deal. Give it to me.
the game stops, and no one else dies.
if not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.
make your choice. The clock is ticking.
let's get her down to the holding cell at the station.
lock it down. No one gets in without my authority.
got it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!
No! Please!
No! Please, help! Please!
what the fuck!
Bobby. Bobby, help me!
I can't move, Bobby.
please, help me! Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.
help me! Do something!
don't leave me.
Hello, Bobby.
before you is one of your trusted colleagues.
she has been your publicist for years, knowing your lies but choosing to speak no evil.
she has been richly rewarded for her words, but today she will be rewarded for her silence.
in the X-ray, you will see a key, the key to Nina's survival, which will shut off her device.
but there's a catch.
you have one minute to pull the fish hook from her stomach, and unlock her device or else the four spikes will penetrate her throat, will come in her throat, silencing her forever.
remember, the spikes will also advance ach time the decibel level in this room rises above a whisper, killing her even sooner.
will Nina live or die, Bobby?
the choice is yours.
help me. Help! No! No!
just shut up.
stay with me, okay?
do it.
okay, stay with me. Stay with me.
it's gonna be okay. Look at me.
look at me
quiet, please. For me.
please. Please, for me.
just shut the fuck up.I'm gonna get this out.
no, no!
just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.
No!
why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?
you just needed to shut up!
No!
my God! No!
No!
help!
here you are. Take care.
ma'am, your name?- Sara.
without an "H."
I just want to say I love your book so much.
I just felt like I could feel everything that you went through.
I feel like it changed my life I appreciate that, ma'am.
I really do. Thank you.
thank you.
your name, sir?- John.
with an "H" without an "H"it doesn't matter.
we'll go with John with an "H" this time.
you got quite an army working for you here, don't you?
must be spreading a pretty good word.
well, we try to reach as many people as possible, you know?
you don't see anything wrong with that?
no. No, sir. I do not.
you know, history is a passion for me.
and in ancient Egypt if you were speaking under oath, you were required to say,"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries.
that means anything to you?
no, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.
well, I'll tell you what it means.
it means if you knowingly lied on the public record that you were subject to a period of enslavement.
what are you implying here, sir? I'm not implying anything.
move along, buddy. He signed your book.
thanks for the signature.
nice picture, but I don't need it.
we've met.
Adam, Gibson says he wants you on these right away. They're from the junkyard.
make your choice.
the clock is ticking.
see that?- Yeah.
I know that from somewhere.
Hey, I've got something over here.
we might know who's in the game. This was just sent to us.
it was taken from a security camera downtown.
the guy's name is Bobby Dagen. Familiar?
no. He's a Jigsaw survivor who's milking it on talk shows.
his wife and handlers are also missing.
Joyce?
who is it? Who's there?
Suzanne.
for fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.
Bobby, get me out of here! Help me!
is Cale here?- Who the fuck knows?
get this off of me, Bobby! Get this off of me!
Hello, Bobby. That feeling running through your body is fear, the fear of not knowing if you have what it takes to survive.
before you is your lawyer who swore an oath of ethics, but chose to see no evil in order to benefit herself.
once her device begins to rotate, if you don't delay its movement for at least 30 seconds.
it will pierce her eyes and mouth.
to do this, you must step into the other machine and lift the bars to the highest position long enough to close the circuit, slowing down her device.
if you do nothing, she will wind to her death before the clock runs out.
do you have what it takes to help her? Make your choice.
Bobby, please!
Bobby, please get me out!
get me the fuck...
my God!
no, no! Bobby, please!
please, help me!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
please, hurry! Hurry!
come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!
Bobby, please, hurry!
No! No!
No! No! My God!
No! Bobby!
get me outta here!
my God! No!
Bobby, please! No! No!
my God!
No!
help!
do you know this guy?
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.
did your husband? I do not know.
you sure you don't know him?
Yeah, I'm sure.
all right then.
lock it up.
Hoffman just sent an e-mail with an MPEG attachment.
I'm just searching the IP address. Can you find out where it came from?
it depends on how many proxy servers he filtered it through, but it was time-delayed, so it'll leave fingerprints.
play it.
Hello, Gibson.
once again, we're at a moral crossroad.
I don't blame you for not giving me Jill Tuck, but you shouldn't let an old grudge cloud yourjudgment.
look to where you're being led.
look beyond the crossroad to the clear dawn.
do you see it?
I get it. Let's go.
Joyce?
Cale?- Bobby? Bobby?
listen to me. Cale. Cale, I can see you, okay? Cale, don't move
Bobby, where the hell are you? You got to help me, Bobby. Do you know where Joyce is?
what the fuck? I can't see, man. How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.
okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.
don't fucking move. We're not on the ground floor.
a lot of this floor is missing. Just don't move, okay?
fuck. You gotta help me.
get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck! Fuck me!
Cale, there's a tape. What fucking tape?
there's a tape. Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.
Hello, Bobby.
across from you is your closest friend.
he knows all your sins, yet he acts as though he hears no evil.
today, what he hears will be the difference between life and death.
Bobby, you must help Cale walk over the planks, and get as close to you as possible.
find your own way across the beams to the key.
you must get it to him over the last span between you.
if the noose around Cale's neck is not removed within 60 seconds, a winch will be engaged, and your secret will be left hanging.
does Cale live or die, Bobby? The choice is yours.
Bobby!
Cale!
Cale. Cale, listen to me. Listen to me.
shut the fuck up and you listen to me for once.
listen, I'm gonna walk you through this, okay, buddy?
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.
I'm gonna try to get as close to you as I can, buddy.
I'm fucking listening to you. Talk me fucking through this.
I want you to shuffle to your right.
just shuffle exactly to your right. You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
I want to walk by that board."Right.
Yes, yes.
okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!
now there's gonna be a plank in front of you.
okay.- You're gonna have to go.
what the fuck was that, man? do it! ok, ok.
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man? It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle. It was a bottle.
what the fuck was that?- It's okay. It was a bottle.
you're gonna be fine.- Okay.
you got it, buddy. You got it.
now you're gonna feel a second plank. You'll feel it with your foot.
feel it with your foot.- Yeah, right!
get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby. Step up onto the plank.
Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Relax. You're okay.
hold on!
easy!
hold on!
Bobby! Bobby!
I got the key but...Cale!- Get me outta here!
I'm gonna throw you the key. Cup your hands closer to your chest!
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?
one,
two!
three!
Oh fuck me!
No!
Cale!
No! Cale!
No! Stop!
there's nothing here.- Yes, there is.
right there.
why would he want you here?
for me to remember.
this is where he saved my life.
when I was in uniform I responded to a distress call here.
back when this place was a flophouse for junkies and homeless people.
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.
drop the gun.
he didn't know what hit him.
Yeah, he assaulted me, but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.
next time, you shoot first.
I had no choice but to report Hoffman for brutality.
you owe me.
what happened?
he got a promotion is what happened.
and I got put on an island.
a year later, I transferred to IA, busted three of his guys. He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.
and here we are.
this place was called Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.
look beyond the crossroads "to the clear dawn.
I don't follow you.
the man he killed was released from Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital when the state shut it down.
that building's been abandoned for years.
that's where the game is being played.
all right, you get back, you stay with Jill Tuck.
don't let her out of your sight.
Bobby!
Joyce?- Bobby! Bobby!
Joyce. I'm here.
Joyce?- Bobby! can you hear me?
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.
Bobby, I can see you, too.- Yes - Get me out of here.- Baby, I'm on my way.
who's doing this? Why?
why is this happening?- Please, baby, I'm on the way.
just hang on, okay?- Hurry. Please hurry.
there's got to be a tape.
Hello, Bobby.
before you is the door that leads to your wife.
however, you must first make a choice.
as you may have guessed, your decision will be as difficult as pulling teeth.
the lock before you requires a four-digit combination to open.
however, if it is access you seek then a true sacrifice will have to be made.
watch and learn, Bobby.
the necessary numbers have been etched onto two of your teeth.
look to the chart as a reference for which teeth to pull and in which order to enter the digits.
time is ticking down. You must make your decision quickly.
Bobby!
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?
Oh, My God!
No!
No!
left side clear.
Clean!- Clean!
the game's still on.
Clean!- Clean!
let's go.
clean!
what?- I found where that MPEG came from.
Where?- A business called Pete's Auto Body on 58th Street.
the junkyard.- The location of the car trap? Yeah, that's correct.
okay, you guys keep moving. Where are you going?
to get Hoffman.
okay, let's move it.
Roggers.
Yeah.
what?
what happened?
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.
the game isn't over.
we got a live one.
can't cross here. Let's go.
Hey. Go get your shotguns. You come follow me.
give me your gun.
Hoffman, freeze.
I want you to slowly put your hands in the air.
Joyce?- Bobby!
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.
I am so sorry. I knew you could do it.
I knew you'd come.
get me out.
Bobby! My God.
there's gotta be another way.
Hello, Bobby.
you have almost completed your rebirth.
however, your final task will be your most difficult.
the woman before you symbolizes your success.
she is your trophy.
and she has seen the good in your message, despite its dishonest beginnings.
what's he talking about?
today, we will see if you can truly earn her love.
to prove your status as a survivor, you must overcome a game that should be all too familiar.
you supposedly survived it once already, so it should be easy to survive once again.
Pierce the hooks through your chest muscles,
Pierce the hooks through your chest muscles,
in order to free yourself and your wife, you must hoist yourself with these chains and connect the extension cords above you before the clock expires.
both hands will be needed to complete this task.
but that should be simple. For, as you claim to understand, the pectoral muscles can easily support your weight.
so I ask you, Bobby, when you embrace every day as if it is your last, will it be with your wife?
make your choice.
what is he talking about? Baby, I'm so sorry.
I lied.
I was never in a trap.
how could you let me believe that?
I'm gonna make this right.
you don't deserve to be there.
I'm your wife. How could you lie to me?
I know that from somewhere.
make your choice. Clock's ticking.
bag the other bodies. Get them back to the coroner's office right away.
what is this, sir?
Hoffman tapped into the station's security system.
he's been watching us the whole time.
Oh, My God.
this is Palmer. Listen.
you get every available officer back to the station.
I'm sorry, sir? Right now.
sir?
Gibson, are you still there?
Gibson?
door's locked!
gas! Gas!
I love you, Joy.
I never lied about that.
I love you.
Bobby, I love you.
Gibson?
you can do it. You can do it.
Bobby, I love you.
you can do it.
hang on! Hang on!
pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it
gee, Bobby! you can do it.
my God!
Wow!
what was that?
pull! pull!
pull pull! You're almost there!
fight, Bobby. You can do it.
someone's out there.
Oh, my God. No!
help me! Help me!
I've been looking for you.
how do I look?
bitch!
help me!
Bobby, please, reach.
quick, Bobby! You can do it,
quick! Quick! You can!
Bobby, safe! Safe!
just one more! Quick, can you!
you can do it.
Bobby!
No!
Bobby!
No!
Bobby! No!- Joyce!
Joyce!- Bobby!
Joyce!
Bobby!
you fuck you Bitch!
Bobby! Bobby!
Joyce!
No! No!
Joyce!
game over.
over the last two hours, it seems our entire city has been shaken to its core.
in addition to the nine police employees killed tonight,
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer John Kramer, has been found dead.
citizens are being advised to report any activity, even remotely suspicious, at this time, as blockades are being set up at major intersections within a 30-mile radius, surrounding what will be considered the largest attackon this city's police department in our history.
any citizens with information leading to the apprehension...
what the fuck...
Hello, Doctor Gordon.
you are perhaps my greatest asset.
congratulations, Dr. Gordon, you survived.
without you, my work over the last few years would not have been possible.
Jeff's wife.
Dr. Linn Taylor.
she'll be perfect.
my eyes! I can't see!
that having been said, I have a request.
watch over Jill.
and should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.
in return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.
I've shown you a lot of places.
but there is one that will be, perhaps, the most meaningful to you.
I don't think so.
what do you think you're doing?
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
No!
you can't fucking do this to me.
fuck you.
No!
game over.
No!
dinner with your dad?
every Sunday.
you want a doggie bag? - Every Sunday.
Thanks.
so, um... how have you been?
how's work? Um...
that shop has quite a reputation.
what's the name of the guy who runs it?
uh... Cyrus Beene.
you know, uh, he turned down running Harvard.
Olivia, if you don't wanna do this...
we made an agreement.
I have dinner with you every Sunday.
you pay off my law school loans.
I'm here. What more do you want?
I am trying. That's what this is.
this is me trying.
I've called. I apologized.
I asked for a second chance with you.
I made mistakes.
mistakes?
we lost your mother, and I was grieving, and I did the wrong thing.
I sent you away, and that was a mistake
a terrible mistake.
but I - I'm trying now.
and when someone you love is making an attempt at amends, you give them an inch. You give them a centimeter.
you don't extort payment for your school loans and then shrug for five Sundays in a row.
I... am... trying.
you try, too.
I'm good.
you asked how I am. I'm good.
I'm...
I have a boyfriend.
is he good enough for you?
how are you?
how's the Smithsonian?
well, we're considering adding a new mastodon to fossil mammals - M. Matthewi.
although paleontologists don't think it warrants its own species, and because it doesn't differ enough from M. Americanum.
I disagree.
now I'm rambling.
I'm - I don't want to bore you.
you're not boring, dad.
so tell me more about the mammoth.
Ah-ah. Mastodon.
a solitary creature, with sharper teeth than its cousin.
the mammoth gets all the glory, but the mastodon was the far more dangerous beast.
how was it?
it was...
he's trying.
so it went well, then.
Yeah. It was good.
I'd love to meet him someday.
I told you, introducing my dad to people I'm dating
w-wait. I'm not people you're dating. We live together.
and I will make a honest woman out of you at any time.
all you have to do is say "Yes."
I told you... I'm not ready to
I'm not gonna propose again, Liv. This is it. One time.
don't push.
I love you.
I'm hanging up now.
I love you, too.
hand it over, bitch!
run.
day two here at the Jeannine Locke president grant scandal, and, people, it just keeps getting better.
we've seen the e-mails.
we've seen Ms. Locke herself admit to having feelings for the President of the United States.
he is freakin' hot.
...who leaked the news, the White House has remained silent on the accusations, which, to my mind, pretty much confirms that Jeannine Locke had an affair with the president.
what happened to Jeannine...
I know.
we can't come clean now, can we?
no. It'll make you look like you unzip your pants for anything with a pulse.
Ouch.
sorry.
I miss you. - Stop.
when something happens, something is strange or funny or...
I met the Dalai Lama last week.
we played basketball.
you did not.
I did. I swear. He asked, so...
no press. No witnesses. Just...
I shot hoops with the Dalai Lama. It was...
the man has a jump shot.
he fouled me twice. It was surreal.
and I picked up the phone to call you.
something happens, and you're the one I wanna talk to.
you don't wanna talk to me.
I only wanna talk to you.
I'm going after the White House.
clearing Jeannine's name means going after the White House, after you.
I understand.
it's gonna give the story legs.
it's gonna make it hard for you.
she's an innocent kid. Bring it.
I won't hold back. - You better not.
somewhere...
in another life, in another reality...
we are married and we have four kids, and we live in Vermont, and I'm the mayor, and
and I make jam.
and you make jam.
I won't hold back... with Jeannine.
I'm going to attack the White House, and I'm going to go for blood.
go for the jugular.
you don't know where she is?
you were supposed to control this girl, Cyrus.
now we've got a bimbo on the loose.
we made up that she's a bimbo. Mellie
just... find her.
doom, gloom, fate of the republic. I get it.
I'm calling to remind you that Jeannine Locke is a gift from the gods, manna from heaven, and yet I haven't heard a whisper from the White House confirming the affair.
the president has been given a hell of an opportunity, Cyrus.
make him take it.
make him? Make him?
the only thing I can make him do is shut me out, and given what I read in that folder about Remington, you can't afford that.
fine.
you do what you have to do, and I'll do the same.
you know, some people just say good-bye.
good-bye, Cyrus.
what about the trip to Italy?
sir? - The president of the United States cannot go to the land of the bunga bunga party and field questions about his sex life in front of the pope, for god sake. Cancel it.
sir. - Right away.
sir, it's important - What, Ethan?! What?!
I found Jeannine.
good afternoon.
I'd like to introduce you to Jeannine Locke.
Jeannine graduated Summa Cum Laude from Berkeley.
Jeannine is a loyal friend and sister and daughter who has worked tirelessly for this administration.
and most importantly, Jeannine Locke absolutely, positively did not have sex with the president of the United States.
by leaking her name through anonymous sources, this White House is guilty of slander, and I am representing her pro bono, because I have personally been affected by these brutal and underhanded character attacks myself.
yesterday the president was having an affair with me.
today it's Jeannine.
tomorrow, who knows? All I know...
What'd you expect, Cy? It's Olivia.
it's time this administration stops hiding behind anonymous sources.
what happened the other night?
where did you learn to do that?
I don't know.
Huck. - Maybe I took karate in high school.
you can tell me.
you can trust me.
I was a trained assassin for a secret offshoot of the C.I.A. on U. S. Soil called B613 run by a man called "Command"
in a paper company that's not really a paper company.
it's called Acme Limited, but really, it's called Wonderland.
acme's in wonderland. Welcome to wonderland, son.
then they put me in a hole, and then I wasn't so good at my job anymore.
and then I wasn't in Wonderland anymore. I was here,
but I can still - I can kill a man with very little effort and a lot of joy, but I try not to.
okay?
is there medication you should be taking, or...
anyone I should call?
do you think you and your dad could eat at a place with cheeseburgers?
I want a cheeseburger.
you learned to cook.
I started by reading cookbooks for fun.
hmm. Try it... with the wine.
I don't really like wine. I don't have the taste for it.
because you've never really had fine wine.
try it.
go on.
this is amazing.
go here.
ask for Miguel.
tell him that I sent you.
they have the best wines in the district.
Thanks. - Happy to expand your palate.
and now...
I'm fine.
you were mugged.
I was saved.
by a homeless man. For the record, hearing about it in an e-mail was not fun.
you call your father. - Dad.
why are you even friends with men who live in the metro station?
he's...
I don't know. He's sweet.
at least, he's sweet to me.
but when he was beating up those guys, it was like he was a different person
someone... scary.
I asked him about it.
you asked the scary homeless man.
and he said he was an assassin for a secret government organization.
he called it... I think it was "B613"?
and he said it was like the C.I.A. but on U.S. Soil.
have you heard of anything like that?
from my lofty position at the Smithsonian? No.
but, Olivia, this man is homeless, a transient.
he attacked a violent criminal with his bare hands and then he explains it away by telling you that he's part of a secret ring of super spies.
he's clearly mentally ill.
maybe.
probably.
but can you look into his story?
ask around?
don't you have that friend at the FBI?
if you really want me to ask, I will.
I do... want you to ask.
please?
if it'll make you happy.
I'll tell you what needs to be done to save your presidency, which is currently hanging by the very thinnest of threads.
you need to grow some presidential-sized balls, get out there on TV, and tell the world that you had sex with Jeannine Locke.
you confirm it.
then I confirm it, and we put all this behind us.
it's funny.
the things people forget, the things that you'd think would be staring them smack in the face.
like the fact that I am the president of the United States, and I call the shots.
you both threw an innocent young woman under the bus, and now Liv is going to make that right.
so when the media calls and asks if Jeannine Locke was my mistress, you will answer,"absolutely not."
and then you're gonna tell them that this White House owes Ms. Locke one world-class hell of an apology, which we humbly hope that she'll accept.
and if we don't?
try me.
one of my aides will be giving you a folder.
whatever you've got planned, Mellie, unplan it.
we cannot push, and this is not the right time.
he is my husband, Cyrus, not yours, and I will push him however and whenever I want.
now one of my aides will be giving you a folder.
in it, you will find every date I was out of town during the last year, along with the west wing logs for the same period.
match the dates I was gone with the dates Jeannine worked in the oval
and you've got all the opportunities she had to sleep with the president.
leaked by an anonymous source of your choosing.
you're evil.
you're welcome.
breaking news at this hour
as unnamed White House staffers now say that Ms. Locke and President Grant spent numerous nights working alone in the west wing...
security logs confirm reports that Ms. Locke and the president were the only employees working in the west wing on nights when the first lady was out of town.
high-level administration officials say Jeannine locke accessed Ms. Grant's schedule in a calculated attempt to seduce the president when his wife was away...
locke told her fellow staffers that she was burning the midnight oil...
this is ridiculous.
I was never alone with the president! - She says
I heard.
we're gonna need proof. Jeannine needs an alibi for every night the press is talking about.
the nights you worked late - who else was there?
my friend Ethan. We worked late together every night.
we sent each other IMs.
they have time stamps.
that is how we show I was never alone on instant messages.
that can only be accessed on the White House server.
we may have something.
good. Get on it.
you never said your dad lives in D. C.
just, uh, meeting your colleagues.
and you must be Huck.
did you ever get a chance to look into that thing?
I was telling you about? The B613 thing?
I did. There's no such thing.
I-I even had my, uh, buddy at the FBI - look into your friend at the - at the metro station. - And?
and someone matching his description was arrested just the other day.
paranoid schizophrenic, repeat offender, attacked a couple of commuters, in and out of jail, A rap sheet as long as my arm.
it's sweet that you care about him, Livvie, but some people are just beyond even your ability to help.
that doesn't sound like Huck.
well, it was.
but are you sure it was him?
was it Union Station?
Olivia, you need to drop this. This is a waste of time.
I just don't think - Olivia.
Yes, dad.
that's Olivia's dad?
guess so. - And he lives right here in D. C. in town?
guess so.
God, he seems so...normal.
why has she never mentioned him?
well, if she hasn't said anything...
I'm sure she has her reasons.
we made a deal.
my people you stay away from, especially Huck.
I'm not here to talk to your people.
I'm here to talk about Jeannine Locke.
you need to leave.
I'm sure you realize by now that there is one thing I have a say over.
if you ever wanna see Jake Ballard again,
america will believe it was Jeannine Locke that had an affair with the president.
how do I know he isn't already dead?
you don't!
what did you do to him?
ask your friend Huck.
this him?
no.
you know, if you give me a picture of this Jake Doe,
I wouldn't have to call you down here every time some 6-foot somebody shows up in a body bag.
I prefer to come down every time.
must be big money client looking for this guy.
something like that.
I have to ask you something.
it's about B613.
I can't tell you how I know this, but Jake Ballard has been taken, and if I don't let Jeannine Locke burn, they're never gonna let him go, so...
in B613...
if you disobey an order, what happens?
do they kill you?
uh, not at first.
they spent a lot of money making you, and they don't like to lose their investment.
so at first, they try to reprogram you, make you come back to the fold
how?
they use the hole.
they use the hole...
and darkness, isolation, pain.
and if that doesn't break you.
that's when they kill you.
well, that's when they make you wish you were dead.
I need him.
I want "fanaticism" changed to "extremism."
and bring back that line about The Bay of Pigs.
that was good stuff.
sir?
Thanks, guys.
I need you to tell me if Jake Ballard is alive.
is there a reason he wouldn't be?
B613 has him.
he saved my life.
he's good at that.
forgive me if he's not my favorite person these days, Liv.
I know, but just...
find out if he's still alive, and if he is, get him away from them, please.
for me.
this is crap. That arrest was illegal.
and you accepted money for a sex act, Licorice.
we have it on tape.
I asked him first if he was a cop. He said no.
you know, that's not actually a thing, right?
excuse me. I'm looking for a David Rosen.
you found him. Just hang on.
you need a lawyer. Do you have a lawyer?
I know a lot of lawyers. Judges, too.
perfect. Call one.
I'm sorry. Who are you again?
I left you a few messages.
you know Professor Stewart from Georgetown.
right. Right. You dropped off that purse.
Yeah, so I ran the prints off it.
your homeless friend's not in the system.
do you have a pen? - Yeah.
that's impossible.
he was just arrested last week at Union Station.
Nope. He's never been arrested, ever, anywhere.
his prints came back completely clean.
I'm sorry, Mr. Rosen... - Call me David.
David, look, I'm just a little confused here because someone specifically told me this man was arrested.
then someone specifically lied to you.
anyway, great to meet you, olivia pope.
tell Professor Stewart I said hi and that I blame him for not forcing me at gunpoint into a career in Corporate Law.
sorry. Almost stole this.
I was a trained assassin.
B613 run by a man called "Command."
acme Limited, but really, it's called "Wonderland."
acme's in Wonderland. Welcome to Wonderland, son.
best wines in the district.
sorry. Almost stole this.
you're late, so I heard all of the specials without you, and they are making the most tremendous...
what's Acme Limited?
what do you do for a living?
and don't tell me it's fossils or exhibitions or publishing papers.
don't lie.
what... do you do... for a living?
dad?
do you teach people how to kill?
do you throw them in a hole until they go insane?
do you work in Wonderland?
I'm your father.
so I'm going to explain to you how you are to behave in my presence.
you do not ask questions that you cannot handle the answer to.
you do not make judgments about things you cannot imagine.
you don't know me that way.
you don't ever want to know me that way.
but if you push, you will know me well, and that would break my heart, because I'm enjoying these Sunday dinners that you make me pay for.
now you are on my dime.
pick up your menu, order your meal, and tell me about your day.
no.
huck, did you know that Liv and her dad used to have a standing dinner date every Sunday night like clockwork?
how do you know that?
I hacked into Liv's e-mail.
Why?
because I can.
that's not a reason. At least, not a good one.
relax. It's not like they talked about anything at all personal.
but you know what is weird, though?
all their correspondence - the e-mails, the dinners,
at a certain point, it just stops, and they never e-mail each other again.
what do you think happened? - Quinn.
they must have had a pretty big falling out, right?
I know I've taught you lots of things, but...
you should try to be less... like me.
you should be less like me and more like Liv.
captain Jake Ballard has been taken by B613.
B613? I... I'm afraid I don't know
Yes, Cyrus, you do know.
well, I wasn't aware that you knew.
B613 has taken Jake Ballard, and I want him released.
we can't ask for that.
Cyrus. - This is not insubordination.
it's just a fact. We can't ask for that because of the way things were very deliberately set up between that organization and the executive branch.
they don't answer to you.
their operations are entirely walled off from this and every administration
to ensure plausible deniability, to keep you safe.
I am their commander-in-chief.
no, sir, this is what I'm trying to explain.
you're not. - There has to be a way.
their only objective is the stability of the republic.
sir, right now they are not your biggest fans.
and trust me, B613 is not the kind of enemy that any world leader would want to have.
just find out if Ballard is still alive.
that's an order, Cy.
I'm still your commander-in-chief, right?
I'm a friend of Jeannine's.
Mr. Beene's soup can never get cold.
Jeannine I. M.'d you the night the White House's claiming she was alone with the president.
I don't remember. - Don't have to.
all you have to do is pull the messages off the White House server and hand 'em over.
I wouldn't even know how to do that.
Really? Because it's gotta be a lot like using a bit torrent to illegally download movies, right?
I'm impressed with your wide range of tastes, by the way, from French new wave to "America's sluttiest moms"?
bet the White House would love to know how much of your government-issued hard drive is dedicated to that.
we good with Ethan, the IMS?
I scared him straight. We're good.
Oh, thank goodness. - What now?
now it's time for America to hear from Jeannine directly to witness the strength of her character first thing in the morning, live.
live? - Quinn! Help Jeannine with wardrobe.
let's go, people!
what do we think? Too short?
we'd have to see how it looks when she's sitting to be sure.
clearly you have a crush on the president.
it's obvious from that video.
I was joking around!
you can't ex - don't. Don't get defensive.
it makes you seem guilty.
how how about this? - She's not Amish.
we need current but classic, professional yet relatable.
give us a minute, please.
do you know what time it is?
it is almost 4: 30 on Thursday the 9th.
I don't understand.
I should be headed to the Hill right now, to the speaker's office to hash out details of the campaign finance bill, which, I know, it sounds very boring, but it is full of ideas
my ideas.
and instead I'm shopping.
I am discussing headlines, all because somebody
one single person - just whispered my name.
whispered that I had an affair with a man that I have never even been alone with.
it is insane!
it is.
he had the affair, you know?
everyone knew it was going on, we just didn't...
know who it was.
I can't believe this is happening to me.
you are going to get through this.
I am going to get you through this.
your life is not over.
your career is not over. I promise you.
it's unclear what exactly
miss Locke will be talking about, other than the White House spin machine that she says put her in this position.
come on, Brooke, the real question on everyone's lips is if the president's mistress wasn't Jeannine Locke and it wasn't Olivia Pope, then who was the first lady talking about?
frankly, Mrs. Grant is a woman of a certain age.
it wouldn't be the first time a powerful man's wife got jealous for no reason.
which is a shame, because otherwise Mellie Grant is an intelligent, accomplished woman.
she could have had a political career of her own.
I'll be right there.
Jeannine, thank you so much for agreeing to meet me.
Mrs. Grant, I just wanted to tell you that I didn't.
I would never.
I know you didn't, dear.
but let's talk about your future.
Olivia. Why are you here?
it's Sunday. I thought we were having dinner.
of course. Uh...
I think I can whip up something for the two of us.
three of us. - I just had to park the car.
and you must be... Eli.
she still hasn't told you yet, has she?
dad, this is Senator Edison Davis.
he proposed to me, and I accepted.
not immediately, of course. She made me sweat it out.
but, uh, then... I don't know.
I guess something just clicked for her.
edison was recently appointed to the Senate Intel Committee, the one that makes sure spies don't break any laws, like disappearing innocent civilians...
that kind of thing.
it's a great move for his career.
gives him a lot of influence in this town.
honey, will you open the wine?
it needs to breathe. - Sure. Sure.
uh, the kitchen is in... - Right around there.
thank you.
give Huck back to me.
Oh, my gosh, you scared me - again.
I thought we had a deal, Ethan. Um, a deal?
Yes, We did. - Hand the I. M.s over.
but - but... I can't.
why not?
five minutes out, guys.
Where's Abby? We need those messages.
Abby, Where are you? - We're screwed, Liv.
she told Ethan to destroy the I. M.s,
so there's no evidence she wasn't alone with the president.
someone in the White House must have gotten to her.
she's gonna go on live TV and tell the world she had the affair.
nothing starts until I give the okay.
was it you? Did your people do this?
Jake Ballard is alive.
they'll release him? - No.
I tried. There are protocols in place.
no, they need to release him.
they won't. I'm sorry.
make them. - I can't.
we're talking about a man's life.
it's out of my control.
there's a reason. - What?
there's a reason that this is not Vermont, that we don't have kids, and that you are not the mayor.
there's a reason we are not happy.
it's so you could be president.
it's so nothing is beyond your control!
that's the point! You bring him back!
they're ready in there, Liv. - Just give me...a minute.
I save Jeannine, and Jake dies.
I let Jeannine burn, and Jake lives.
they want to start.
stall them.
I'm asking you to spare a man's life.
as you know, what happens to Jake is up to you.
I'll put Sunday dinners back on the table.
I'll take that under consideration.
we're about to start.
just one second.
going on television right now to admit to an affair you did not have,
selling your soul to whoever in that White House got to you is not what's about to happen.
I don't know
stop lying right now.
they are giving me $2 million in a Cayman account - tax-free.
might as well profit off it.
you don't do this.
you don't lie, because every time you do, you sell a little bit of your soul.
and then you have to live with those lies eating away at you month after month, year after year, until one day you're gonna look in the mirror and you won't even recognize yourself.
then you'll hate what you see, Jeannine.
believe me.
she's all yours.
great. Let's start. - Sound speed.
hold up. We're being pre-empted.
are you kidding me? By who?
the president.
he's about to speak live from the briefing room.
sir, please tell me right now what in the hell you are planning to do here.
actually, Cy, that's up to you,
because we are playing "Let's make a deal."
behind door number one is me getting up in front of the press corps and telling them that you orchestrated a cover-up and ruined a girl's life, because all I've ever wanted to do is tell the truth
that I had an affair with Olivia Pope.
behind door number two is me giving you exactly what you want and telling that same press corps how sorry I am to have slept with Jeannine Locke, at which point you will call your friends at B613 and get them to release Jake Ballard.
Ballard? Sir, I told you, there's no way we can make B613 do anything.
it's a simple choice, Cy.
door number one, I tell the truth and the both of us get kicked out of this White House.
door number two, I admit to the Jeannine affair and Jake gets released.
what's it gonna be? Because I'm about to go on live television and need to know what to say.
how presidential are my balls now, Cy?
uh, the, uh, 9:50 was 4 minutes late.
it threw everything off. You missed your train.
it's okay... Huck.
I can wait for the next one.
I have to take this, but when I'm done,
I'm going to buy you a cheeseburger, okay?
what do you want?
I would've thought you'd start with "Thank you,"
given that you have your friend back.
I hope he's all settled back in his little underground palace.
what... do you want?
what every father wants, Olivia.
I want you to be happy.
I just have this strong feeling that
senator Davis isn't quite the man for the job, especially at the moment.
what are you talking about? Where's Edison?
right now? At Washington Memorial.
he was in a terrible accident.
I'm surprised you haven't heard. It's all over the news.
I can't remember the details. Maybe a broken collarbone, a leg or two...
he'll pull through, of course, but it sounds very painful, so...
when you give that ring back, let the guy down gently.
poor guy's been through enough.
I will stay away from you.
I will stay away from what you do, but in return, you will do the same, because this is over! We are done!
we are family, sweetie. We're never done.
good morning, everyone.
I'd like to make some remarks.
I have indeed taken part in an inappropriate relationship with an employee of this White House.
that person's name...
and I extend my sincerest apologies to her and her family for any pain that I've caused them.
to put it simply, I am...
okay, people, let's wrap it up.
ashamed and embarrassed by my behavior.
okay, you heard that. We're excused.
Mr. President, a word.
Mr. President,
I don't believe Jeannine Locke was that girl.
I don't believe Jeannine Locke threatened your marriage.
I don't know what it is you're doing, but here's what I do believe.
I believe this is some kind of dodge.
this is some kind of slipping through the bars.
this is some kind of way out of you keeping the promise you made to me.
I believe that this is some kind of lie.
I'm not lying, Sally.
I had Jeannine Locke six ways to Sunday all over this White House.
and after some soul searching on all of our parts,
I think my constituents are going to forgive me for it.
why would he do that?
why would he say that we slept together when we didn't?
where are you going? Where is she going?
we'll set up some interviews. Network, print.
get you a book deal.
it'll be enough to retire on.
smile, Jeannine.
you're getting what you wanted.
I know you wanted me to stop.
you didn't?
only because I was doing what you said.
I was being like Liv.
and my gut said there was something in her e-mail I had to find.
here it is. Liv and her dad are talking about some homeless guy she used to give change to in union station, a guy who saved her from some sort of mugging.
she's asking her dad to look into him for her right before the e-mails stop.
didn't you live in union station when you were homeless?
I want the deal. - What deal?
I want the deal she got for you.
there was no deal, Huck.
were Liv and her dad talking about you?
what's wrong?
I have a couple of questions.
literally two questions.
first - why did you lie to me?
I've never lied to you.
you said there was no deal for me.
you said no deal.
but you used to talk to your father, and then you got mugged, and I was taken from the metro right after that.
and then they put me back, but then they've never tried to find me again.
and you don't talk to your father anymore.
you stopped then. You stopped right then.
how high up is your father in b613?!
is your father command?!
is your father command?!
is your father command?
Yes.
he is.
I never want to speak to you again.
open your front door.
go to hell!
open your front door.
sunday, my house, 7:00.
I'll choose the wine.
you're sure it's safe to go back to your apartment?
rowan knows where I am. B613 always knows where I am. It doesn't matter where I go.
I'm not the one who wants me to leave. - Jake.
you're safer if I'm here.
you and I both know I'm already being defended.
by the President?
does he know your father's command? Does he?
no. - So how can he defend you?
how can he defend you if he doesn't know who your enemy is?
my father wouldn't hurt me, not physically.
he put me in a hole, which was bad. What was worse...
every other day he had two guys haul me out of that hole, and he stood there and watched as they beat the crap out of me.
they did things to me that you can't imagine.
and then he had me bandaged up.
set the bones, stitched the cuts, gave me a shot of penicillin, 'cause he wanted me alive and then back in the hole. That was just for fun.
Olivia, he would hurt you. Your father?
he would slit your throat and drink your blood if it served the republic, and I think you know that.
I think you have nightmares about that. So why are you pretending like you're daddy's little girl?
I can't. I can't have you here.
he can't know you're still here. - Liv...
he made Huck kill. Just like that.
he flipped his switch, and Huck is killing again. My father did that just so I'd know he could.
he's in charge. He's in charge of everything.
which is why we have to stop him. - No. I can't be involved!
whatever's going on, I don't want to be a part of it.
I don't want to know. I don't want to see. I don't want to help.
I need to go back to doing what worked.
eyes straight ahead, no looking around corners, no peeping in shadows, no asking questions, no stepping outside the lines. I need to be a good girl, - go to Sunday dinners. - Liv...
I've never heard of B613. I've never heard of you.
Harrison. - We got the job.
they said yes? - They said yes.
can I come up?
no.
okay. No.
I don't know. - You don't know?
I don't know. - Okay, I'm gonna go.
don't be mad. - I have a case to prep.
actually, it's right up your alley. The Senator who murdered the girl he was sexting.
the family's like a deer in the headlights with the media.
they're good people who could really use some gladiating.
sorry.
what's up? - Electric bill's getting... paid, Abby.
lights are staying on!
well... good night. - Good night?
well, I was serious about the girl's family and the gladiating.
I'm sorry, David. But... we already have a gig.
my name is Huck, and I'm an alcoholic.
Hello, Huck. - Hi, Huck.
so, uh... I fell off the wagon.
I let my guard down, and I... drank whiskey.
the sad thing is that I was offered a bottle a month ago, and I didn't take it.
I was strong. But this time was different.
this time I didn't take the whiskey.
it was put in my hand.
the... decision was taken away from me.
and I drank...
and drank...
and drank.
I wish I could say that I hated it, but I didn't.
I liked it.
because whiskey is good.
whiskey feels like home.
and I just...
crap!
crap, crap, crap!
what? The money train's arrived. - I'll be right there.
do it, Cy. Open your mouth.
get that thing away from me.
open your mouth, Cy, and give it to me. I know you want to.
stop it!
one quote, Cy. One tiny quote I can take back to my editor.
I am not going to comment... On the personal life of a Senator.
the personal life of a Senator?
he took a picture of his wang and killed the woman he sent it to.
this in a party that already has a wang problem because of your boss.
so don't sit there and act like this murder trial has nothing to do with you.
it has everything to do with you.
which is why you're going to put this memo down and give me a quote from the White House, who has yet to respond to repeated allegations that the party it presides over is suffering through its worst P. R. crisis in years.
one sentence, Cy, and I promise I will leave you alone.
no comment. - Bitch.
senator Richard Meyers... by day, he represents the great state of Washington in our nation's highest legislative body.
by night, he's a perving, sexting pervy-perv who uses the handle "Redwood Johnson.
gross.
say the thing again. - We need the money.
we need the money. - We need the money.
we need the money. - Right. Okay. We need the money.
we've had worse clients... I think.
haven't we?
pics of his junk aren't the problem.
it's the welcome recipient... A miss Desiree Oaks.
she saved them all, tried to use them to blackmail the Senator and ended up murdered.
bludgeoned to death. The weapon was never recovered, but the Senator's prints were found all over Desiree's apartment.
what were you doing at her apartment, Senator?
well, I went to talk to her, try and get some those photos back, resolve this mess.
was I upset? Sure.
but I did not so much as lay one finger on that girl.
were there any other women you engaged in this sort of relationship with?
no, it was just one stupid little trifle. That's it.
and as the record shows, he was home at the time of the murder.
and you'd be the one to testify to that, Mrs. Meyers?
Yes. Absolutely.
Shelley Meyers, the Senator's alibi.
she's a doting mother, partner at a law firm, all-around upstanding citizen.
if she's still supporting him after everything he's put her through...
he must not be guilty. - That's the message we're sending.
jury always reads and watches news stories about the trial, despite orders by the judge to the contrary.
so while I argue your case, Olivia's gonna work on your perception, - both in the courtroom and in the media. - Well, I appreciate that, miss Pope.
I'm about to mount a re-election campaign, and I'm bleeding approval ratings.
we'll do what we can, Senator.
thanks very much, Liv. - Yeah.
your daughter? - Uh, she's in Bethesda with my sister.
I thought it best to keep her as far away from all this as possible.
luckily, she has a history report to keep her busy.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton. - Oh, worthy subject.
look, um...
I know you think my husband...
that what he did was creepy, and it was. There's no doubt about it.
but the man who sent those pictures... That was a different Richard.
and we have been through marriage counseling, we've talked endlessly, and he's a better person now. And, in case you've forgotten, innocent.
so I won't let the world hang him for something he didn't do.
you of all people should know how wrong that is.
he made one mistake, miss Pope. One.
and... - We all deserve a second chance.
exactly.
is it true that the Senator is a sex addict?
senator, did you have sexual relations with miss Oaks before you killed her?
senator, are you and Mrs. Meyers getting a divorce?
we're very sad about what happened to Desiree Oaks, but my client isn't a murderer.
he didn't kill miss Oaks. The only thing he's guilty of is bad judgment.
he texted a girl... One girl. He made one mistake.
and, Kelly, can you read the text messages you received from the defendant to the court, please?
I thought about you so many times today. I want to shave you, put you on my lap...
make you my little... - Butterfly.
that's what he used to call me. - "Spread your wings, butterfly.
spread 'em wide and tell me how..." - "I can be your daddy.
you wanna feel my paddle, baby girl?" - "Just beat me up.
make me your... - "Toilet."
he wanted to take pictures of me on the toilet.
lick 'em." - "Grab 'em.
squeeze 'em until they hit you in the face.
I don't even know what that means. - No further questions.
it still doesn't mean he murdered her. - Tell that to the jury.
while Reston was the clear winner on the issues of last night's Democratic debate, the best moment of the night belonged to congresswoman Josephine Marcus of Montana.
I don't think it is a matter of the President showing leadership on the issue.
at this point, I'm more interested in him not showing certain things.
I think it's high time the man tame his cobra
Josephine Marcus Stole the Show and keep the lid on the basket so our country can focus on education, keeping jobs here at home. I mean, honestly...
are you watching this hack? - Tame my cobra? Not bad.
it's good. Catchy.
good? I don't know who's hurting us more, the pervert or this one.
let the dems take all the free shots they want now during the primary.
that way, if they try these jokes in the election, they'll be beating a dead horse.
well, regardless, we need to keep Fitz above the fray.
focus on national security, pick a fight with Russia, something.
Peter Foster, Local Navy Pilot Found Dead - G8 summit's coming up. - G8. No one pays attention to the G8.
half of America can't even spell G8. No.
we need a war. We need to liberate some people.
you can't take the stand right now. David Rosen will rip you to shreds.
he's made this case all about you, Senator... Your failings, your flaws, how someone like you could have murdered Desiree Oaks.
is this still going on? - The texting? No. Of course not.
this all happened before I was arrested. - So what do we do now?
we make it about the girl. We need to find other reasons she might have been killed.
you had other women. Maybe she had other men.
are we really going to... - Slut-shame a dead girl? All aboard.
Mr. Granville, would you please describe your relationship with the victim?
like a mentor. She would come to me with work questions, problems, sometimes just to vent.
did she ever mention the defendant, Senator Meyers?
she said she received threatening texts from him.
and when did she tell you this? - The night before she died.
we were at dinner, and she said that she was afraid for her life, that Senator Meyers had told her he would kill her.
your witness.
Mr. Granville, would you say that you and Desiree had dinner together often?
no more than any mentor occasionally checking in on his protégé.
so once a week, according to these receipts? - I suppose.
and at these dinners with your protégé, did you present her with gifts of high-end jewelry, handbags, and at one time, a blackglama mink jacket, which your waitress said, and I quote, "I would kill my own mother for"?
well, you're quite a mentor, Mr. Granville.
maybe a better term would be "sugar daddy." - Objection!
coming to light in the Senator Meyers scandal is that the victim,
Desiree Oaks, had multiple suitors supporting her lavish lifestyle.
objection.
rent. - Objection.
car payments. - Objection!
even her gym membership was paid for by...
men who enjoy supporting a young woman financially in exchange for her company.
Desiree Oaks Had Multiple Suitors
but isn't that essentially prostitution by another name?
whatever you choose to call it, I think it's fair to say there's more than one man out there who could have been jealous enough to commit the crime of passion that sadly ended Desiree Oaks' life.
I object to all of this! - Mr. Rosen, on what grounds?
and congresswoman Dandridge has assured me that she's going to push her colleagues to follow her example so that facilities such as the Adams Irving medical center become the rule in this country and not the exception. Thank you, Samantha. And thanks, everyone. Thank you.
Yeah. This way?
Madame First Lady, what'd you think of Josephine Marcus' performance at the Democratic debate last night?
I think it's great anytime a new female talent enters politics.
even if she's a democrat? - Doesn't matter what party you're from.
all of us women have to break through the same glass ceiling.
blah, blah, blah. Give any piece of trailer trash a push-up bra and a microphone, and those stupid flyovers will eat it up like fried twinkies...
Mellie... My mic's still on.
our daughter was a kind, generous person.
every day she made us proud to be her parents.
she's dead. The things these people are saying...
they should be ashamed. - Turn it off.
tomorrow's all about prepping the Senator's wife.
this entire case hangs on whether the jury believes her alibi.
I don't want any surprises up on the stand. - We're on it.
I was worried about you, okay? - Why?
what? - Why are you worried about me?
I come to work. I do my job. I go home.
I have appropriate emotional responses, and I'm taking social cues for behavior.
I am being normal. Why are you worried?
you're not... You're not talking to me, not like you used to. We're not...
look, I wanted to know what was up. - So you followed me.
Yeah. - Friends don't follow friends.
I'm not a client, Quinn. You don't fix me.
but those meetings do? - Those meetings are supposed to be anonymous.
they're also supposed to be for alcoholics.
well... Huck, wait. Who did you... You said you drank the whiskey.
that's a person, right?
you killed someone and it felt good?
like a high?
what do you want? - To talk.
what do you want? - To talk.
so talk. - Who did command have you kill?
I don't know what you're talking about. - I think you do.
I think you wanna take him out as much as I do.
we're both wearing leashes, Huck.
you and me and everyone else who's ever worked for that man... He owns us, just like he owns Liv.
but if we could get something on him... Something big like murdering a guy...
no. - Why?
because no one takes down command. - No one's ever tried.
stay away from Liv. Stay away from me.
"worst lady"! "First catty bares claws"! "Mouthy Mellie..."
first catty"? That doesn't even rhyme.
what's the second rule of politics? - I know the damn rules.
I'll give you a hint! The same rule applies to gun ownership.
the microphone is always loaded! - I know the rules.
I took my mic off. Blame that stupid congresswoman.
I'd like to, but then you had to go and break rule number one... Never insult the voters.
it'll blow over. I will make it right.
you're missing the point.
Josephine Marcus went from flavor of the month to legitimate Presidential candidate.
you did that. You gave her legitimacy. You minted her ass!
even better. She's inexperienced.
we should help her win in the primaries so that we can crush her in the general.
Ethan? Get in here!
Madame First Lady.
would you say we had a problem with female voters in this next election?
Yes, sir. - What if we ran against a female candidate?
would that be fun for us? - We'd likely get clobbered, sir.
I will go craft an apology. - Run it by me first.
the prosecution's about to rest. Now it's our turn.
your testimony is crucial. You nail it, we're home free. Just remember...
supportive, not smug. I know.
and make just enough eye contact with the jury. Too little, you'll seem impersonal.
too much, you'll seem like you're begging. - I appreciate it, Shel.
I have the head of B. N.C. on the phone. - Tell him I'll call him back.
he said it's urgent. Something about a story that's about to break.
he says he wants a comment. - What story?
we met on mixer last week. It's an app.
senator Meyers sends more texts while on trial.
people pretend to use it for networking, but it's really just a hookup site.
he called himself "Mr. Chubbles." You know, he has a mole on his...
I mean, it's small, but... the mole, I mean, not his...
anyway, I thought he was harmless. I didn't even know he was married, let alone a Senator, and then at 2: 00 A. M. last night, I get a text, and it's like...
now I get the name.
she's lying. I've never seen that girl in my life.
Shelley, you have to believe me.
call them up. Tell them it wasn't me.
make a statement. Whatever you have to do. I did not send that text.
did you hear what I said? - Harrison.
give me your phone. - What?
you heard him. - I don't...
I left my phone in the car.
okay. Me and you, men's room, now. You drop trou, and we hope to God there's no mole.
there's a mole.
I don't know why I...
I have a lot of stress.
I couldn't sleep.
I have a problem, Shelley.
Oh, Shelley... Do not touch me.
not now. Not...
don't touch me.
honorable discharge from the Navy in '94.
from what I can tell, that was the last good thing to happen to him.
palmetto air.
small airline in Florida. He was fired six months in.
two marriages. And a lot of arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct.
had a few sales jobs along the way, but even those dried up.
I'm not sure how he got by financially.
he's got a sister, but she doesn't seem to have any more money than he did.
what about the funeral arrangements?
wherever his sister can find the cheapest place to bury a pine box.
detail, halt!
never expected all this.
I'm sorry. Can I help you folks? This is a private service.
ma'am...
you must be officer Foster's sister.
Marion, is it? - Mr. President?
I wanted to pay my respects and tell you how sorry I am for your loss.
I don't... Mr. President...
I never met your brother, but I was in the Navy at the same time.
he was a good man.
I didn't even think he could be buried here at Arlington, but then veterans affairs called this morning, and...
was that you? Did you do this for my brother?
they let me pull a few strings from time to time. Perk of the job.
but why?
Pete Foster was an American hero, and he deserves to be buried as such.
detail, atten-hut!
half right... face!
! Aim! Fire!
aim. Fire.
aim. Fire.
are you an idiot, or did you do it to spite me?
what the hell are you talking about? - This.
the President throws a funeral for a down-on-his-luck Navy vet, and I have to find out about it from the gravedigger's Instagram account? Me!
the chief of staff's husband, who could have been an asset to you.
I could have produced a segment on the President's heart at a time when the only organ people care about is his penis.
but, no, either you didn't see the potential, or... or you didn't see my potential.
so I ask you again... Are you an idiot, or did you do it to spite me?
James, I had no idea this was happening. - Really?
so the President calls veterans affairs and says, "Pete Foster. Let's throw him a funeral,
and no one said a word to you?" - No.
not everything I do is a scheme. You may not believe that, but it's true.
okay. I'm sorry I bothered you.
wait. Did you say Pete Foster?
you could have given me a heads-up. - Not exactly my style.
or, okay, I don't know, you could have not killed him.
calm down, Cyrus. Pete Foster killed Pete Foster.
right, of course. Well, whatever the official story is, the President heard about it, because he went... to the funeral today.
he practically arranged the damn flowers himself.
Pete Foster had every intention...
he had the original flight plan, Cyrus, and he was gonna use it...
on Grant. A loaded gun that I was not about to let go off.
so taking care of the man? Necessary.
giving you a heads-up? Less so.
this day could not have gone worse for the defense.
the defense, who we should point out, has Olivia Pope on its team.
how do we think Ms. Pope is feeling right now, Anne?
first she's accused of an affair with the President, then she gets duped by real mistress jeannine Locke, and now this.
that's right, Tanner, and let's not forget, this is a woman who used to command a lot of respect in this town.
her name alone was enough to strike fear into people's hearts.
and now it's close to becoming a punchline.
if you're coming to say that we need to drop the case, don't waste your time.
he lied to us, Liv. And if he lied to us about the sexting, who's to say he's not lying about killing the girl?
Shelley Meyers is in the wind, gone. - She's not answering her cell.
she's not at home or her sister's. - If we jump ship now, we just look smart.
if you're worried about the money, we can all work for free just for a few months.
we're not broke yet. We're fine. I have my savings.
you shouldn't have to use it. - Quitting is not an option.
Harrison, tomorrow morning, do whatever you have to do to stall.
buy us some time with the judge until we track Shelley down.
please. Go. Find her.
bad time? - You shouldn't be here.
does the name Pete Foster mean anything to you? That's who your father had Huck kill.
what did I tell you?
he was in possession of something dangerous, and not just to your father.
to Fitz, to the White House. It was a flight plan of some kind.
I have no idea what you're talking about, and for the last time, I do not care.
okay. Look. Pete Foster was a pilot.
he flew 86 missions, but there are only 85 listed individually on his jacket, - which means that one of them is missing... - Stop.
I have told you over and over that I want nothing to do with this...
what the White House does, my father... none of it.
so take your files and your conspiracies and leave my office. Now.
or, okay, I don't know, you could have not killed him.
calm down, Cyrus. Pete Foster killed Pete Foster.
calm down, Cyrus. Pete Foster killed Pete Foster.
No!
Pete Foster had every intention...
Pete Foster had every intention... on Grant.
a loaded gun that I was not about to let go off. So taking care of the man?
he had the original flight plan, Cyrus, and he was gonna use it.
he had the original flight plan, Cyrus.
missing MISSION?
he had the original flight plan, Cyrus.
pilot ID: P521 AIRCRAFT CALL SIGN: USN699 MISSION DESIGNATION: G629KL
Pete Foster killed Pete Foster.
left some unfinished business for you inside.
look, we all get a case of foot-in-mouth disease from time to time.
Marcus Responds to Mellie Grant Graffe
let's call it a joke that fell flat and leave it at that.
first lady apologized. Apology accepted. I will say this, though.
don't knock a fried twinkie till you've tried one.
a star is born. You should be so proud.
I apologized. What more can I do?
you didn't just create a star. You created a movement.
a movement? Please.
her favorables are up 12 points in the last 2 days.
she's been top 10 on Twitter for the last 48 hours.
and you know what else is trending? Hashtag...
Mellie has a big fat mouth... - Leave her alone!
her apology was gracious.
sir, with all due respect... - Enough! Take a walk, Cyrus.
thank you. - We all make mistakes.
you're going to fly out to Montana right now. Today!
and you are going to walk the deserted streets of seven forks or horsefly gulch or apache tears or whatever the hell the name is of the hick town our Calamity Jane calls home, and you're going to talk to everyone from her second grade teacher to the first boy who put his hand under her blouse, and you are going to come back with some good old-fashioned dirt!
that's how Nixon did it way back when, and it still works. Understood?
good. Now... get going.
no. - No, what?
no, I will not be a pawn in whatever stalling tactic you're about to employ.
not after I spent the entire morning at the courthouse convincing judge Gaynes that your request to add six more addiction experts to the witness list was really just a way of hiding the fact that you've lost Shelley Meyers.
luckily, she agreed with me. If you don't produce the wife by 9: 00 AM tomorrow, we're moving on to closing arguments.
actually, I was seeing if you wanted to have lunch.
is that a yes or a no? - I don't know.
you don't know? - I don't know. Am I hungry or full?
salad or sandwich? And don't get me started on drinks and desserts... I'd be lost.
okay. I get that you're... miffed.
Miffed? Nah. I'm done waiting for a decision.
I'll make it easy for you. You won't give me a straight answer? In or out?
I'll give you one. I'm out. I'm done.
any luck finding Shelley Meyers?
we tracked credit cards, ATMs I hacked into her e-mail. Nothing.
where would you go if you had lots of money and wanted to go away somewhere alone?
easy. The fanciest hotel I could find.
we looked at every hotel in the area. - Shelley's smart.
with the media attention she's getting, she'd know to use an alias.
so what are we thinking? A movie character? Someone from a novel?
what do we know about this woman? - Besides the fact that her husband's circumcised.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her daughter's writing a history report about her.
and just checked into the grand district.
there was a paralegal I worked with once, a young guy, fresh out of college, who had the most amazing thighs.
they said he played soccer. I'm assuming it was from that.
we were sitting in the lunchroom one day, and his shoe brushed up against mine under the table.
I should have pulled my foot away, but I didn't.
I kept it there, gently touching his, even though I was married and I knew it was wrong.
the guilt I felt that day.
touching his shoe.
you would have thought we screwed in the supply closet.
miss Meyers... - I'm done forgiving him.
the sacrifices I have made for that man.
the marriage I protected because...
I thought it actually meant something. And for what?
so he could shove a camera down his pants.
I'm a partner at a law firm.
and he has made me look like...
the weakest, most backwards anti-feminist this world has ever known.
and that is not the poster child I am supposed to be.
I am supposed to be... a role model, a woman that my daughter can look up to, someone... she can admire.
Ah, I should have screwed that kid, him and his beautiful thighs.
I should have just brought him home and banged him in our bed!
I can recommend a divorce lawyer, Ms. Meyers. That's a punishment that meets the crime.
but sending your husband to prison... which is what's going to happen if you don't testify tomorrow...
it's not right. It's not right, and you know it.
so I'm supposed to do what, just get up on the witness stand and pretend that I'm not hurt?
pretend that I don't find him despicable?
because I'm not that good an actor, Ms. Pope.
they will know I am lying.
what if you didn't have to lie?
the coroner has testified that Ms. Oaks' time of death was between 8: 00 and 10: 00 PM.
where were you at that time? - At home with my husband.
the defendant was with you that entire window of time?
the whole evening, until we went to bed at 11: 00.
so could your husband have possibly been at Ms. Oaks' apartment to murder her?
he could not. - Your witness.
Mrs. Meyers, you don't want your husband to go to jail, do you?
no. - I'm sorry. "No, " what?
no, I don't want him to go to jail. - No, I imagine not.
and you'd like to help him avoid that. Isn't that right? - Yes.
and so you'd say pretty much anything to get him acquitted, correct?
objection, your honor. - Withdrawn.
as you know, Mrs. Meyers, in US law we have something called marital privilege, whereby an individual can't be compelled to testify against their spouse.
it can make my prosecutor's job harder, but I fully support that principle.
because I look at it this way...
why in the world would a jury believe a wife's testimony anyway when it's clearly going to be prejudiced in her husband's favor? Don't you agree?
your honor... - Enough, Mr. Rosen.
the jury will disregard.
do you love your husband, Mrs. Meyers?
no. - I'm sorry?
you've heard the disgusting things he's been doing. He's a pig.
he makes me sick.
what's she doing? - Telling the truth.
so... you don't love your husband?
my husband has disgraced his office and dishonored our marriage.
he's a pervert and a creep, and I hate him.
I would love to see him go to jail for the rest of his life, but you don't go to jail for being a cheating, lying bastard.
you go to jail for being a murderer, which he's not.
he didn't kill that girl.
is that who you killed? Looks like his wrists are slashed.
is that to make it look like a suicide?
I'm assuming there's a special way of doing that, ways of angling the blade so the cops can't tell it was staged.
it's not polite to sneak up on people.
you need someone to talk to, Huck.
you wouldn't go to those meetings if you didn't. With me, you don't have to call it "whiskey.
you can call it what it is.
don't do this alone, Huck.
no. - I need to talk to you.
there's nothing to talk about. - Yeah, there is.
grant. A loaded gun that I was not about to let go off. So...
what does any of this mean? - There were numbers on his body.
Pete Foster's body. Tattooed. They're a Navy flight plan.
for a secret mission called operation remington.
it was a rescue, during the first Gulf war, on iranian soil.
that's why it's classified. - I was on that mission.
there were five of us on the ground and one plane flying air support.
and the pilot on that plane was Pete Foster. - No.
that pilot was the President.
so why does this guy go get a tattoo saying he was the pilot?
maybe for the same reason your father wanted him dead.
sir, I'm sorry... - Cowboy boots?
are those... - Yes, sir.
I figured it was okay. After all, we are Republicans.
this isn't the Bush White House, Ethan. We don't wear cowboy boots.
understood, but listen... - We wear shoes, real shoes.
sir... - Thinking man's shoes.
I failed you, sir. - What are you...
I didn't do so well in Montana... Except for the boots, or so I thought.
the only thing I got was that at 15, Josephine Marcus walked into a maternity ward pregnant.
but when she walked out, there was no baby and no birth certificate, so...
no proof. - You didn't fail me, Ethan.
no? - Not at all.
how long before a verdict?
could be ten minutes, could be ten hours. I'll go sniff around, see what I can find out.
you all right?
I didn't realize how much she hated me until just now.
she hates me, Olivia. The way she looked at me in there...
my wife of 20 years hates my guts.
I did this to her. I dragged her into my muck.
she'll get through this, Senator. She's a strong woman.
and maybe in time, she'll forgive you... again.
but she won't forgive herself. - For what?
lying for me.
I didn't kill that woman, Ms. Pope. But there's nobody who can prove that.
certainly not Shelley. She was out shopping that night. She came home late.
she lied to give me an alibi.
she's a lawyer, Olivia. She believes in the law.
she's gonna carry this with her forever.
here we go. Jury's back in.
the defendant and counsel will please rise.
the clerk will now read and record the verdict.
in case number 438-076, the district of Columbia versus Richard Alan Meyers, we the jury find the defendant for the charge of second-degree murder not guilty.
district of Columbia would like to thank the jurors for their service.
Mr. Meyers, you have no further business with this court.
you are free to go, and court is adjourned.
you weren't his alibi. - Excuse me?
he was yours. You followed him over to Desiree's place, waited until he left, and killed her.
you thought you could fix it. You thought there was just one.
it's like you said, Olivia.
we all deserve a second chance.
no comment.
Josephine Marcus... She's not going to be a problem.
drugs? - Abandoned baby.
boy, do I love a slutty teen. We should have something to leak in a day or two.
anything else? - No, sir.
actually... yes.
it's about the funeral you went to.
what about it?
this is an election year, sir, and I'd hate to see your conscience get in the way of your goal.
who told you? - Who is not important.
what's important is keeping you in the White House.
and if you keep looking backwards, dredging things up that ought to stay buried, well, then people are going to notice.
and they'll pick up shovels and start digging themselves, and we know what they'll find at the bottom of that cracker Jack box.
don't we?
do you think...
we can leave the past in the past, sir?
good.
then that's all we'll say on this matter.
where were you?
you have to stop asking questions. - Look, I am worried about you.
you have to stop asking questions!
you're not worried about me. You're interested.
you wanna know what it feels like to do the things that I do. I see you.
I see that look in your eye every time you ask me one of your questions about where I was and what I've been doing.
you're interested.
and maybe that's because you're able to see me, too...
how my mouth has been dry for months, how I've been squirming and vibrating, and it wouldn't stop until the other night when everything just stopped, and I wasn't thirsty anymore.
all these questions you're asking...
they have answers, but you don't wanna know them.
so stop being interested.
and stop asking questions.
stop. Stop while you still can.
now cleared of the murder of 24-year-old dental hygienist Desiree Oaks,
senator Meyers says he's looking forward to putting his campaign in gear and working on his marriage, in that order...
yeah? - Is that a picture of your...
Yep. It's an addiction, David. I couldn't help myself.
I told you I don't wanna play games. I'm out.
I don't wanna play games either.
so? - So I'm...
outside your door, and I'd like to come in.
you okay?
Yeah, sure.
I'm just...
I don't know what I am.
well, you're the daughter of the man that runs the top secret organization that made your friend kill a man for some reason having to do with your ex-boyfriend, the President.
look, uh...
Hey, hey. Come on. Don't cry.
I'm not crying.
I'm trying not to scream.
I'm scared.
okay.
put your head right here.
come on. Do it.
do it.
there.
you're not alone in this.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
don't answer it.
it could be important.
Mr. President. - Why so formal?
what can I do for you? - Do for me?
does everything have to be transactional in this town? Even with us?
what happened? - Rough day?
you could say that. How are you?
I'm fine. You're, uh...
are you okay?
I don't know how to answer that. I honestly don't.
you sound... - More wine?
you have company. - Yes.
explains the formality. - Sorry, it's just...
you should go. - It's okay.
you have company. - We can talk.
that would be rude. Good-bye, Olivia.
we're here, sir.
what the hell is this? - This is a reunion...
one that is long overdue.
I really want to. I've buried stories before, James. I can't do it again.
and here I was thinking that you'd called this meeting begrudgingly.
wait. What?
I said I thought you'd called the meeting begrudgingly.
you thought I called this meeting? - What's with all the whispering?
please, please. Oh, God.
I've always liked you, David. You seem smart.
are you smart, David?
can you work with me on this, or do I need to stop liking you?
vic's name is James Novak, White House press secretary, but I'm guessing you already know that, or justice wouldn't be down here taking over my case.
no car keys, empty wallet, and windshield glass at the scene suggest we're looking at a carjacking gone wrong.
there's been a string of them in this area the past few months.
got an APB out on the car.
we're also visiting local chop shops around town.
any luck, the perp will try to dump it locally.
Mr. Rosen?
put an expedite on ballistics. Anything you find, I'm the first to know.
copy that.
the White House doctor's going to be here any minute to check you out.
you've had a terrible shock.
we're gonna find whoever did this. We're going to find them, and they're going to go to jail for the rest of their life.
I have some things to do right now, but I'll be back soon, all right?
James is dead. He died. - Ethan.
I know, but right now, your job is take care of Cyrus.
I talked to him yesterday. - Ethan.
Ethan, stop crying or you're fired.
I mean it. Don't make me fire you, Ethan.
call his nanny. Make sure his daughter is accounted for.
check on him every 15 minutes.
this is the worst day of his life.
you're Cyrus Beene. - Guilty as charged.
I was, um... Do you think I could get a couple words on Grant's thoughts on immigration?
primary Election Indiana
I called you a couple times.
uh, sorry. I'm James Novak, Boston dispatch.
Boston dispatch.
no comment.
wait a second. Novak? James Novak?
the James Novak who wrote that tiny little hit piece in that tiny little paper that no one's ever heard of?
do you mean the meticulously researched cover story on Hollis Doyle's influence on the grant campaign that ran in the Boston dispatch?
wouldn't know. Didn't read it. But if I had,
I'd tell the hippies in Cambridge square not to worry.
Doyle's pipeline has no chance of moving forward, no matter who's in the White House come January.
so, you didn't read it, except that you made it all the way to the end?
piece of advice, James.
you want to play with the big dogs? Dress the part.
you really think I'm gonna take fashion advice from a guy with a neck beard?
no comment.
I can't believe James is gone. - Just awful.
I'm so sorry. How's Cyrus? - In shock.
you'll have to suspend your campaign activities at least for a few days out of respect.
um, I hate to say it, but is that wise?
it's the decent thing to do.
I think what Mellie's concerned about is the gun-lobby event.
you want me to suck up to the gun lobby the day after my press secretary's shot down on the street in cold blood?
one could argue, especially then, the liberals will be braying about gun control.
it reaffirms your commitment to our second amendment rights.
I'm not politicizing the death of a friend.
you'll be the only one who won't be.
reschedule my appearance.
Mr. President, the vice President's on the line for you.
Mr. President, James Novak was a devoted public servant.
in the wake of this senseless tragedy, I imagine you'll be temporarily suspending your campaign?
we will be, yes.
I just wanted to let you know that, in solidarity, the Langston campaign will, of course, follow suit, so that his passing may be mourned with all the honor that it so richly deserves.
I appreciate that, madame vice President. Thank you for the call.
of course.
and now?
now we go after that gun-lobby endorsement with everything we've got...
guns blazing, as it were.
what was the President's reaction to the news?
I'm sorry. I'm just getting my bearings here.
you mean you can't just tell us how the President reacted?
where was he when he heard the press secretary was shot?
hold on, I'm getting there. Just one sec.
when can we expect to hear something from the President?
Where's Vanessa Chandler?
find out if shelby moss was at work this morning.
Shelby Moss. That's... - David's N. S.A. girl. What's going on?
Vanessa Chandler was a no-show at the White House today.
wait. Are you saying...
I don't think James Novak died in a carjacking.
it was a hit. - Oh, my God. David.
go.
David! Oh, my God, David.
Abby, are you stalking me at work? - Yes. Yes, I am stalking you.
because you didn't come home last night, and... Did you know that James Novak was killed?
Yeah, I'm running lead on his case. - Oh, my God. That's even worse!
worse... what are you talking about?
there are people, David, and they are dangerous, and they are out there, and James is dead, and Shelby Moss and Vanessa Chandler are missing, and you're alive... You know, for now...
but those people are gonna see you. David, you're gonna be on the news.
James Novak died in a random street crime. It's not whatever you think it is.
it's not... - Uh, don't... don't do that.
don't lie to me. You can't... Don't lie to me. We don't do that anymore.
I'm not lying. - David.
he was a friend of mine.
I liked him, and I miss him, and I can't believe he's gone.
please don't make this into something it isn't, Abby.
please just let me get through this by doing my job.
Liv. I heard the news. I'm sorry. I know James was a friend.
Thanks.
actually, that's why I'm calling.
I think James may have been killed because he knew the truth about Daniel Douglas.
can you do me a favor? Can you look into it?
I'm in the middle of something right now.
well, whenever you have time. - Sure. No problem.
I'll throw in the Gucci for free.
you are a very resourceful young lady.
let's just say I have a knack for playing the market.
so, now that I've paid your retainer, where do we go from here?
we find ourselves a terrorist. - Well, I thought that's what you were.
no, not at all. - You blew up a plane.
that was personal.
terrorists use violence to advance their convictions... God, country...
and since I'm not burdened by those, I'm more of a facilitator.
I don't make bombs, I make money.
when I hired you, I thought it was just gonna be you and me.
then who would take the fall? Because it's not gonna be me.
don't worry. Your money's been well spent.
you just leave everything to me.
tell me you found Shelby Moss. - I wish I could.
her boss said she left early yesterday and didn't show up this morning, and her roommate said she never came home last night.
and Vanessa Chandler? - Also M. I.A. , but I'll keep looking.
no. Find out what Leo Bergen was up to last night.
you think Leo and Sally killed James?
I don't know, but they'd benefit most from his death.
I did everything you said. I held his calls, canceled his meetings.
I did a bunch of stuff wrong on purpose just so he could yell at me, which usually makes him feel better, but I'm sorry, Ms. Pope.
I couldn't stop him.
this is completely wrong!
I asked for her schedule, not your own personal musings - about when she might be leaving! - They told me it was in flux.
why use so many words when a simple "I failed you" will do?
Ethan, get out. - Yes, ma'am.
Liv, this is bad. She's going behind our back.
Cyrus, sit down. - I'm fine! Just listen.
sit down. You've been relieved of your duty.
Sally Langston is sneaking behind our back to steal the endorsement of the gun lobby.
and I will handle it. - Air force two is fired up on the tarmac!
Sally's set to meet with their leadership today!
I will deal with it!
I know what you're doing. I appreciate it. I really do.
thank you... for caring about me, for my health. I mean it.
but asking me to sit on my hands while Sally Langston steals the gun lobby and with it Ohio and Western Pennsylvania and the White House in a single meeting...
that's not helping me. That's involuntary manslaughter.
let me work. I need to work.
general Election Grant Campaign Bus - Working. - Just one question.
why hasn't governor Grant taken a stand on the issue of marriage equality when he has a gay campaign manager?
what?
"what" as in you're surprised I asked, or "what" as in you didn't hear me?
I'll repeat the question. Why hasn't...
I'm not gay. - So, why are you whispering?
because your question is outrageous. - And yet you shaved your beard.
it itched. - I don't believe you.
you need to return to your seat.
you do look a lot better without it.
you found nothing? - Nothing.
I'm not saying bergen didn't do it, but if he did...
he was clever about it. All right, listen.
the Daniel Douglas file, the one in my safe...
I want you to look at it, see if there's something we've overlooked, a thread we haven't pulled on yet, something that could give us some answers.
will do.
lance McCollum? - Who wants to know?
Hi, Lance. - Who the hell are you?
we're the United States government, and we're here to ask you to serve your country.
I can't serve nobody. I'm a sick man.
your liver. We know.
six months if you're lucky, and with your insurance, you probably won't be.
livers are expensive, Lance.
but you know who gets free medical care... Transplants, even?
inmates, that's who.
we went to his place on an anonymous tip.
idiot sees us coming and starts running.
my partner chases him down, and voila.
suddenly, we've got cause to search the premises. - That's when you found the beretta.
shoved under the couch with some beer cans and cat toys.
got a record... Two carjackings.
ballistics? - Uh, still pending.
so, what do you say? Can we make it official and arrest this guy?
Mr. Rosen?
no. - I'm sorry?
it's too soon. - Too soon?
we've practically got him dead to rights. Why on earth...
because I said so. We wait for ballistics to come in.
until then, no arrests.
the determination of our party... - The determination of our party...
the vision of a better tomorrow than we've ever had before.
grant Campaign Speech Defiance, Ohio
can you see that future with me?
can you dream with me? - Can you dream with me?
because I can't do this alone.
Yes, I'm the one running for President. But that's just me...
y-you're going to miss the end of my guy's speech.
he gave the same speech two days ago, and the day before that, and three times last week.
sometimes it feels like a thing of the past...
a relic from a bygone era.
it's a good speech. - What?
the speech. It's... It's a good speech.
Oh, my God. You're terrible at this.
at what?
I do... I don't... I don't...
indulge very often. - Indulge?
Cyrus, I'm not a dessert.
I like you. I'm attracted to you.
now that you're divorced, I want to date you...
because you're intense and you're strong and...
even though you're a republican, you have a very hot mouth.
Cyrus, that was my move.
it is now your turn to make a move back.
unless I've just been deluding myself that there's something here and you can't figure out a way to tell me.
okay. I'm sorry.
I won't bother you anymore.
no.
that was... my move.
damn right, that's your move.
Sally's decided to mourn the press secretary by going down to Houston to meet with her good friends from the gun lobby.
what are you doing here? You should be at home. Why isn't he at home?
he needs to work. Let it go.
Cyrus. - You heard her. Let it go.
all right. So, what's the plan?
you want me to fly down to Houston to meet with the gun lobby today?
no, that's... - Bad optics, given the situation.
but we can send Andrew. - With his record on guns?
he's too moderate. - And Mellie.
they do love Mellie. - Mellie's kin.
all right, but if Sally's leaving in a few hours, we need to get ahead of her.
we need help from our commander in chief.
four gun-control bills signed into law when he was governor of California...
his very being an assault on the second amendment...
Ooh, "assault." Gun lobby's gonna love that.
and this arduous weapons ban he's supporting...
what part of "shall not be infringed" does Grant not understand?
Jim, what's going on? Why are we turning?
we have to head back to the White House, ma'am. Air force two has been grounded.
grounded? By whom? - Cyrus Beene, that grief-stricken son of a bitch. I'll handle this, madame vice President.
Hut!
ahh, another bird that gets to have dinner with his family tonight.
the gun lobby has 5 million members. If you want their support, it's not enough to be seen with a shotgun in your hand. You need to know how to use it.
in case my family ever gets attacked by clay pigeons?
or armed intruders. - Oh, that's right.
you and your beloved second amendment.
the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
wiser words were never written.
Hut!
nice! - Fifth place, junior world championships.
I'm sorry. There must have been a miscommunication.
I only speak to Ivan, but your name is...
can you see why I'm confused? - Ivan is very busy man.
doesn't know you. Neither do we.
if you want to do business, you work with us. First off, where's money?
perhaps we can get started with negotiations and arrange for a meeting with Ivan after.
would you mind?
now, Dimitri, tell Ivan that Marie Wallace sends her condolences for his loss and she looks forward to meeting with him soon.
you have something?
when I took the Daniel Douglas file from your safe, it showed signs of tampering.
I pulled footage off the cam inside. - You put a camera in my safe?
when David stole the cytron card, it exposed holes in our security system. I upgraded.
Quinn was here. She went right for that file, which means...
B613 knows everything.
three innocent lives, and one of them was a friend of mine!
innocence is in the eye of the beholder, and I think you're smart enough to see why my definition is different than yours.
so you admit this was B613? - I am telling you bad things happen.
a reporter and an N. S.A. worker go missing. A press secretary dies in a carjacking.
it's unfortunate. Life is unfortunate. Random. Coincidental.
bad things happen to good people all the time.
No! You make bad things happen to good people.
who put you up to this? - Olivia...
I want to know.
who? Who made you do this?
you tell me... Who made you do this? Who?!
I am command, Olivia! Who do you think?!
this was your call? - This was my call.
I am protecting the Republic. I keep this country running.
I do what needs to be done!
it's my job! I'm command!
you told me you would be different. - I am different.
No! No! Fitz gave you the keys to this office and immediately you became my father!
I am different! Because when something awful needed to be done,
I did not pull some poor, broken soldier out of a hole and make him do something that would give him nightmares for the rest of his life.
I did that awful thing myself.
James Novak died in a carjacking. Accept that and the world keeps spinning.
and if I don't?
bad things happen to good people all the time.
I promise you, I am fine. I have to go.
you're being unreasonable. - I'm being unreasonable?
inauguration Night
don't you dare make this about me, Cyrus, when this is so clearly all about you being too afraid to tell your other boyfriend that you're gay!
I'm not afraid, James.
I am just not ready to tell the President of the United States what I do when I go home at night.
when are you gonna be ready, Cyrus, huh?
because I seem to remember you telling me that things were gonna be different after the election.
James! - I brought a tux, Cyrus!
you realize that you are literally... literally... Standing me up for the ball!
I can't take you to the inaugural ball! You knew that I couldn't take you.
bringing a tux anyway is your way of trying to make me the bad guy...
you are the bad guy! - I am not like you.
I am traditional. I am not interested in flaunting my secrets.
I am not some dirty, little secret.
I am your boyfriend!
what do you want?
your boss has friends at the justice department, yes?
she knows people. Why?
because I may be looking for an escape route.
you know what? Never mind. Forget this ever happened.
calm down, Rosen. I'm not here to kill you.
I'm here because I'm concerned about the pace of your investigation.
the pace?
lance McCollum still walks the streets of our nation's capital.
why hasn't there been an arrest yet?
there will be. It's a big case... Lots of red tape.
we need to thoroughly review the evidence.
we've done everything but put James Novak's car in Lance's living room. Do I need to do that?
do I need to put James Novak's car in Lance's living room?
no. - Good, 'cause I'd hate to think you're having doubts about this.
not at all. Why would you...
because you scheduled a meeting with the Attorney General.
St-strictly to update him, not to tell him what happened...
not that anything did happen.
I gave you a suspect. I expect you to use him... soon.
what?
you could say hello.
Hello, Olivia. What do you want?
Olivia? - Can you just... Be...
I don't know, nice, for a minute, to me?
can you be a dad...
normal, kind, regular dad... for just a few seconds for me, please?
I'm asking... I'm really asking, here, because I... I really need it. I...
I need my dad.
what?
I don't know what the point is... of this...
of democracy and freedom and patriotism.
if there are no white hats, if everyone is evil, if the deck is always stacked, if everyone I love is a monster, if no one is worth saving, what's the point?
I'm asking you.
I'm actually asking you. What is the point?
what happened?
Sally Langston murdered Daniel Douglas, and Jake killed three people to cover it up, including Cyrus Beene's husband.
Oh, that. - "Oh, that"?
forget it. - Sit down. Sit... Down.
you want me to be your dad, I'll be your dad.
that's the number of people I'm responsible for killing...
not the number of people I've killed, the number I'm responsible for.
there's a difference.
you get an order to kill someone, well, maybe you pull the trigger, but it's not on you. They ordered it.
if you didn't kill the poor bastard, somebody else would.
but when you become command, you are the one giving the orders.
you are the one making the decisions.
you have to choose who lives, who dies.
you are responsible.
so you become...
the hand of God.
183. I know all of their names.
I know how old they were, if they had children, if they would be missed.
183. I never made a decision lightly.
I always suffered a bit with each one.
the responsibility of that, the gravity of that, the weight of it, it marks me. It stains me.
it never leaves me. I am responsible.
183. So, whatever you think of Jake, however you want to punish him, being the hand of God is already the worst punishment in the world.
and there is, incidentally, a point.
if there are no more white hats, if the deck is always stacked, and if everyone you love is a monster, there is, in fact, someone worth saving.
who? - Everyone!
everyone is worth saving! Even the monsters. Even the demons.
everyone is worth saving.
in the face of darkness, you drag everyone into the light.
that is the point.
at least, I like to think that is the point of you.
am I finished... being dad now?
are we done?
Hut!
good shooting, dick. - Appreciate it, Andy.
certainly underestimated your abilities, governor.
not bad for California.
despite the hippies, there's still plenty of wild west back home.
Yeah, I just wish your boy Fitz had brought more of your spirit to his first term.
look, I appreciate the visit, but I'm gonna have to go with Sally Langston this time around.
what if my husband were to make some kind of gesture?
gesture? What kind of gesture?
uh, whatever gesture would make you feel more confident about his position on these matters.
though if I were you, a speech from the White House would seem to do the trick.
a speech.
they're still leaning towards Langston, but they've agreed to switch horses if you make a speech affirming your support for the second amendment.
I mean, I know the timing's not great. - That's an understatement.
but, all in all, it's good news. Thanks for the hard work, Andy.
it was Mellie who struck the deal. I was too busy worrying about the recoil.
she's right here. Want to thank her yourself?
no, that's okay. I'll see her when you guys get back.
right.
well, what did he say? - He loved it.
wanted to thank you for your hard work.
was that Andrew calling from Houston?
Yeah, they want to make some kind of deal. - A big speech, yeah.
Mellie's chief of staff filled me in. Don't do it.
Cyrus, when was the last time you ate?
Lauren, call down to the kitchen. Have them bring us up some food.
what? I'm fine.
Cyrus... - I'm fine.
if Lauren wants to bring me something, she can bring me a new press secretary.
Sheila's been a damn train wreck down there.
now, about this speech... You can't do it.
Yes, it gives us our base back, but look at who we're up against... A democrat who shot his wife's rapist and Sally Langston, who might love guns even more than she loves Jesus.
so you're saying... - I'm saying let's steal some votes from the left and worry about winning the base back later.
by coming out in favor of gun control?
your press secretary was shot, Mr. President. You were shot.
it's a perfect opportunity to shift positions without looking like a flip-flopper.
you don't like it. - It's a smart move politically, but...
using what happened today to get votes... You sure you're okay with that?
if we can turn some purple states red, why not?
Mr. President. - Cyrus, I thought you'd gone home.
day Five of Grant Presidency
uh, I was hoping to discuss something with you before I left. Sir...
it's important.
what is it, Cy?
I'm s-seeing someone. - That's wonderful.
is this the first person you've started seeing since the divorce?
it is.
and it's serious?
it is. - Well, good for you, Cy.
do you... Want to tell me anything else about this person?
it's...
a journalist. - A journalist?
a very... opinionated journalist.
is that going to be a problem?
of course not. - Good. Okay.
that's a-all I wanted to say.
are you in love?
I am, sir...
in love.
they... Make me happy.
then that's all that matters.
we cannot... we will not... Sit idly by in the face of such tragedy.
we must work together to put an end to gun violence once and for all...
not only for James Novak, but for every citizen of this great nation.
president grant decidedly guaranteeing his opponent, vice President Sally Langston, an endorsement from the powerful gun lobby today.
the President's decision to admonish the nation's gun lobby is being hailed as bold but brilliant by a vast majority of independents this evening.
grant's approvals are up by four points and are continuing to rise.
in other news, still no word on the carjacking death of press secretary James Novak.
white house officials remaining silent tonight.
what is so bad about stiffer background checks?
everything! Are you insane like Fitz or just stupid?!
so, you're saying three days is too long to wait for a gun?
three minutes is too long.
Oh, wait. So... so, you're okay with a depressed teenager or a criminal walking out of prison, hell-bent on revenge, walking into his friendly neighborhood gun shop - and walking out with an ak-47? - Ar-15, more likely.
the point is, the vast majority of violent crimes are committed with black-market guns.
no self-respecting gangster is gonna walk into his friendly neighborhood gun shop to get a piece.
and while we're at it, we may as well put background checks on vodka.
bloody Marys kill far more people than guns!
those aren't the same! - "Bartender, I'd like a beer.
Yes, ma'am! That'll be five bucks. Come back in three days.
ordering a beer is not the same thing as buying a gun!
it makes the same amount of sense. - It doesn't!
it's a shame. - What is?
that he can't see you the way I do.
David?! Are you here?!
why didn't you answer me? - Didn't hear you.
you heard me. What are you doing here?
I live here.
you're home before dark. You're never home before dark.
I'm sick. - That's not how this works.
how what works? - This. Us.
you lying to me is not how we work. What's going on?
I'm not lying. Everything's fine.
David. - Abby, let it go.
no. - Abby...
something major's going on with you...
something major and disturbing and quite frankly pretty scary...
so you need to tell me what it is.
I am sick. That's all.
are you in danger, or are you in trouble? - I told you, I am sick.
danger or trouble...which is it? Danger or trouble? - This conversation...
can you please get out of my way?! - Danger or trouble?!
David. Look at me.
look at me. Something's wrong.
something bad has happened to you... Something terrible.
you don't hide that from me.
you don't lie about it to me. You give it to me.
you let me share it.
I love you. You are my heart.
what happens to you happens to me.
I'm supposed to send an innocent man to jail for a carjacking he didn't commit.
that's the price I have to pay for still being alive.
but I can't bring myself to do it. - Oh, David.
he killed them right in front of me, Abby... Shelby, Vanessa, James.
they're all dead, and I'm alive.
Huck. - Yeah?
you come for some more teeth? A finger?
I came here to kill you, to, uh... Put you down.
you cracked Liv's safe. I saw you on the camera.
you're broken. You're a threat.
so I came here to put you down.
but then I was sitting here, and I realized...
I saw you on camera.
I trained you. I made you.
and you are good, Quinn. You're special... talented...
which means I shouldn't have seen you on camera.
you would have de-magged the optics, looped the visuals, cut the upload.
there's no way I would have seen you on camera...
unless you wanted to be seen.
I don't know what you're talking about. - You wanted me to see you.
you wanted us to know what Jake was doing, what B613 was doing.
you're not broken.
somewhere in there, you're still a gladiator.
you tell me I'm a gladiator, and then you take it away, and now you're here and I'm just supposed to... Screw you!
screw you, Hu...
if you're not gonna kill me...
get the hell out.
Liv, I need to talk to you.
the... the guy who killed James, it was Jake... your Jake...
and now he's threatening to kill my David if he doesn't arrest the patsy he's picked out for him.
Liv. Thank God you're still here.
excuse me. Little busy here.
this is more important. Adnan Salif... She's back in the country, and she's up to something, and whatever it is, it's bad with a capital "b.
Liv! I talked to Quinn, and she's in deep over there... Like, way deep...
and I think we maybe need to get her out.
if you brought me here to give me a lecture on moral relativism, I'm not interested.
sit down.
so, this patsy... - His name's Lance McCollum.
he's 47 years old. Has a mother named Pat and a cat named Murphy.
you need to arrest him.
no. - David...
three people died, Liv, right in front of me. I can't let those deaths go unpunished.
and if you die, too, then what?
who's going to fight the real enemy?
real en... what real enemy? Jake Bal...
Jake Ballard did what anyone in his position would have done.
the problem isn't Jake, David. It's B613 and the fact it even exists.
that's where you should be focusing your energy.
I see. So exposing Jake, that's a death wish, but taking down the entire organization, that's something within my reach?
me, David Rosen, and my army of one?
army of two. We'll do it together.
brick by brick, we'll tear that building down until there's nothing left but a hole in the ground.
to do that, though, we need to be patient... Patient and alive.
so instead of standing alone and turning this into a suicide mission, stand with me and turn this into a cause.
lose this battle so we can win the war.
so, they've made an arrest. - Ballistics on the gun were a match.
McCollum has signed a written confession.
so, a carjacking, then, that's... That's...
what this was. We're sure of that now.
we're sure of that now.
I've gathered the press for a briefing. As soon as I can grab a minute with Sheila...
Cyrus, where are you going?
I can't let Sheila do it. She's a travesty.
Cyrus, wait.
do not go into that room. Cyrus. Cyrus.
once you open that door, it changes you.
I know you!
I know who you are!
the justice department, in coordination with local law enforcement, has confirmed that a suspect... A suspect...
has been taken into custody in the murder of White House press secretary James Novak.
first Grant State Dinner
w-what? What are you doing?
are you sure?
dance with me, James.
Oh, no! Oh, no!
I got it.
come on. Come on.
come on. It's okay.
let... Let me do my job.
let... let me do my jo... job!
the suspect's name is Lance McCollum.
he's being described as a career criminal.
FBI investigators have matched the ballistics of a gun found in his apartment with the bullet used to kill Mr. Novak.
all other questions about the case will be referred to the justice department, specifically the U. S.attorney's office for the district of Columbia.
any questions?
I'm sorry. I really am. I did the others...
quick and clean. I wish I could have done that with you.
I'm sorry I had to be so sloppy with you.
but I have to make yours look like a carjacking. It has to look like an amateur did it.
so it's going to hurt, and it's...
going to take some time.
I'm sorry.
but I'm gonna sit here with you.
I'm gonna stay with you until it's over. I'm not going to let you die alone.
you're not alone.
Ella... - Your daughter's gonna be okay.
nothing is going to happen to her.
she's safe. She is safe.
it's okay. But it's okay.
you're almost there.
you're almost there.
any minute now.
she didn't send you. - She sent me.
she sent you? - She sent me.
she's not dying in a hospital or being held hostage or in the North Korea prison - because those are the only acceptable... - She sent me. I'm her proxy.
her what? - Her proxy.
there is no proxy. You understand?
I'm your Olivia - until she says otherwise.
she's not over the first-family interview. Small of her.
she's licking her wounds.
I have no information on that. All I know is I'm handling the White House.
I'm your... - Olivia proxy.
right. I'm calling her. - She said you'd say that.
did she?
she said to tell you she wouldn't take your call. The only call she is taking is mine, and I am not to call her unless and this is a direct quote, so let me be exact...
do not call me unless the white house is on fire, "in flames, burning to the ground." End of quote. I can do this, Mr. Beene. Don't worry.
I'm very good. I'll handle it.
I almost feel sorry for what's about to happen to you.
well, hello, everyone.
I thought we could start with polling numbers. How does that sound?
there was a sizeable bump from the Grant-family interview.
we made a lot of headway with women in many key voting demos and won no less than three media cycles.
well done.
okay.
the bad news is that Sally's still got a stronghold on women who want to break the glass ceiling.
Reston, well, he visits his murdering wife in prison every Sunday without fail.
chicks dig that. I mean, women seem to love that, so we've got some work to do to put us over the top with women, which is why this upcoming event with the wounded female soldiers...
the warrior women of America... is so important.
I've put together some information... - Where's Olivia?
Olivia's... I'm her proxy today. So, back to these polls.
we're on the precipice of something great here, people.
if we gain just three points with women nationally, we're looking at a potential lock with Ohio, Michigan, maybe even... F-f-Florida.
nice coat.
if I'm going to work with you, I need you to promise me something...
that you won't harm the president.
it's not a joke, dad.
you looked me in the eye and said he wouldn't see his second term.
have you seen the poll numbers lately?
he's accomplishing that all by himself.
promise me you won't hurt him.
dad. Promise me.
I promise you, I won't touch a hair on his head.
good.
so, B613.
how is it funded, and where do they keep their money?
to protect my agency from the naysayers and bean counters, it had to operate off the books.
to that end, in the late '80s, we staged a cyber-attack on the O. M.B.
its purpose was to siphon small amounts of money from all other government entities.
we scanned the entire federal budget and rerouted tiny amounts of funding to a black-box account.
every agency, every taxpayer, unknowingly had a hand in replenishing this fund, which few were aware of and only I controlled.
so, if someone wanted to get at that account, how would they go about it?
we just need to find the algorithm and track it to B613's secret account.
you're not gonna believe this, but I was this close to saying, "top-secret, money-siphoning algorithm" yesterday.
where did you get this information?
look in the O. M.B.'s asset-execution code.
it should be... - It didn't come from Jake. He's the enemy.
so where did you get it?
my father.
I would have gone with "anonymous former government employee."
you're a mark. - What?
your father's treating you like a mark.
did he make you a promise, Liv? He promised you something.
that means - He's gonna take something.
that is what they do. That is what we do.
he doesn't want anything. - Of course he does.
you just don't know what it is.
I know this is hard for you, Huck, but you have to trust me.
this is the job...Hack into the O. M.B. sSoftware and get the code.
my father says it's there. If we get it, we can shut down B613.
I don't work for your father.
no. You work for me.
this is the job.
I'm not gonna do it.
Yes, you are.
this is what we're doing. We all do things we don't want to do.
this is what we're doing.
good morning.
you haven't returned any of my calls.
you need to stop calling me.
is that what you want?
that's what needs to happen, yes.
is that what you want?
I can't walk past you in the hallway and smile like nothing's happened.
this is real, Mellie, and after all these years, after everything you've done for him, you deserve something real, someone who's not just playing the part of the man who loves you... Someone who actually does.
I have to go.
I will always love my wife. She made a terrible mistake...
marrying you... - One that most people wouldn't forgive.
so I will continue to visit my wife here in prison till she finishes serving her time. Thank you.
reporter: Turmoil surrounding the re-election campaign...
someone turn that up. Now.
turn on your TV. Turn it on, Liv. Turn it on now. Now, now, now.
Jeannine Locke, the former White House communications aide who had a sexual relationship with president Grant, is now an author.
in her upcoming memoir, set to be released later this month,
ms. Locke claims that she was taken for granted.
I don't want to hurt the president.
in fact, I want the world to know what a special man Fitz Grant is...
a strong, satisfying... Impressive man.
female reporter: What do you mean by "impressive"?
I think you know what I'm talking about.
male reporter: - Oh, come on. Don't be coy.
give us a sneak peek, Jeannine.
at least tell us whether the president is a breadstick or a baguette.
I'd have to say the President of the United States is definitely... a baguette.
and what else can you tell us about the president?
I think the house is burning down.
and do you still feel...
today, Ms. Locke is back in the news with a sensational memoir that's causing a stir around the world thanks to her response to a local reporter's question.
I'd have to say the president of the United States is definitely... a baguette.
baguette? This is how we go down?! This is our legacy?!
turn it off.
I thought there was a clause.
I thought she couldn't talk about it.
we negotiated her original contract, but...
looks like someone bought it out and brought jeannine to another publisher.
someone being Langston or Reston. - Hold on.
I must say, I'm shocked and appalled by all of this.
it's unfortunate that the president continues to be plagued by this indecency.
my family and I will keep him in our prayers.
that bitch.
we've got Cassidy's abortion. Time to pull the trigger.
no. - Times or the post? Who gets it?
Cyrus, we are not leaking the abortion.
it's wrong on every level. This is old news.
we ignore it and continue with business as usual.
Mr. president, this is not the time to put down our sword.
stay above the fray, Cyrus. - We need to hit back!
we need to hit back!
Cyrus... - Olivia and I need the room.
this Jeannine Locke thing is big.
you can't underestimate it, but it can be counteracted.
it means you're going to have to make nice with Mellie and Andrew.
you sent Gabby to me in your place?
Abby. - What?
her name is Abby.
I don't care what her name is. You sent her to me in your place?
what is that? - Well, I'm here now.
what do you need?
I want Andrew Nichols off the ticket.
we're not taking Andrew off the ticket.
I want a list of new V. P. picks on my desk by the morning.
you're not getting a new V. P.
I am not running with that son of a...
you knock Andrew off the ticket now, it's an amateur move.
it's too late. It'll ruin you.
you picked him, he's your guy, so too bad for you. He stays on the ticket. That's final.
what else do you need?
what else do I need?
what else do I need?
what else do you need?
what service can I render for you today?
am I here to stroke your ego? Am I your cheerleader?
am I here to wipe your tears?
am I your nanny?
am I here to fight the bullies?
am I your bodyguard today?
maybe I'm here to make you feel good.
maybe I'm your dealer.
or maybe I'm here to make you feel hot and manly and ready so you're not jealous of your wife's boyfriend.
is that it? Am I your fluffer today, Fitz?
is that what I am?
what service am I billing you for today?
you're being disgusting...
Oh, I'm being disgusting? - ...And petty...
right. - I'm the petty one.
...and jealous. - What else am I supposed to be?!
I lie in bed every night, and I play our relationship over and over in my head, like a movie.
we meet, we fall in love, we can't stop ourselves, we're meant to be,
I give up everything inside me, and then it stops.
the movie just stops.
I don't know how it ends.
it's just me waiting for a house in Vermont that I can't live in and a man who makes me promises he can't keep.
I am not the bad guy.
I am not the guy who lured you into some degrading...
I am not the bad guy.
I know that. - You want this to be easy.
you want this to be simple. It is not easy or simple.
I know that.
so you can't just stand here staring at me with dead eyes like I'm some...
this didn't happen to you.
I didn't happen to you.
I know.
I should go.
fine. Go.
if Andrew leaves the ticket, you lose.
if Mellie doesn't stand by you, you lose.
and losing is not an option. We're winning this election.
so make nice with Andrew and Mellie.
morning, boss. What's on the schedge for today?
the two of you are to relieve the agents surveilling this target.
you are not to approach the target under any circumstance without my authorization.
agent Perkins, is everything all right?
this is Maya pope, Olivia's mother.
will that be a problem for you?
God, I've missed you.
Mmm. 22 years is a long, long time.
remember when you used to bring me flowers?
I do.
who's buying?
and what do you and Mr. Yushkin like?
a single rose or a garden?
surprise us.
JFK? Yeah. Sure. Let's assume - Kennedy was a bigger cheat...
something we can't really determine till all of Grant's illicit flings are plied out of the woodwork in the next decade or two, but putting all that aside, for all the skinny-dipping and starlets, the man got stuff done.
this guy, he's got no Cuban missile crisis, no man in space, no... oh!
Cyrus Beene, ladies and gentlemen. Get a picture with him now while he's still around.
see you folks.
it's time to join the fray.
I'll get that. And a scotch, neat.
some things never change. It's good to see you again, H.
how's your neck? I was worried.
adnan tell you what she's been up to? Who she's been working with? Hmm?
Maya pope, Marie Wallace, whatever she's calling herself these days...
I need to find her, Clare.
Yeah, here's the thing. Marie Wallace is a trailblazer.
she's a role model.
there just aren't that many women as high up in our business as she is, and she is the best, so am I willing to piss off a potential mentor just to help you out?
I don't think so. - Come on.
I'm leaning in, Harrison, making an investment in my future.
sorry.
I'm outside your door. - What?
I'm standing outside your door.
what do you mean?
I mean I'm drunk, and I'm... standing outside of your door.
I'm not letting you in.
Liv. - You can't come in.
I could come in if I wanted to come in, - and we both know it
but you won't.
no, I won't.
I miss you.
says the spider to the fly.
no.
I miss you.
we can't be together because, you know, you kill my friends.
James wasn't your friend.
I'm godmother to his child.
he wasn't your friend. I would never kill your friends.
can you hear it?
what?
the B613 in your brain.
I would never kill your friends"?
Yeah, I can hear it.
I wish you'd just stood in the sun with me.
sometimes I wish that, too.
just let me in.
get away from my door.
let me in.
Jake, go home.
I don't have a home.
goodbye, Jake.
no, don't hang up. Don't hang up!
Liv... damn it!
let me in, damn it!
I asked you to save me...
and you said no.
you found the algorithm?
right where your father said it would be.
all I had to do was follow the sublist to its result array.
is it an account?
are you telling me we have B613's money?
it's empty.
the whole thing's just some legacy code Left over from an abandoned treasury department project.
he played us. He played you.
I played you? To what end?
you tell me. Are you working with Jake?
is that what's happening?
it's not a preposterous idea, dad. B613 is your life.
helping me destroy it -- I'm helping you put down an animal, a dog that isn't mine anymore, a dog that is sick and malnourished
because its new master doesn't know how to care for it.
so rather than sit here and watch it starve to death,
I've chosen to euthanize it, to show it mercy,
not because I hate it, but because I love it.
so the money
Jake Ballard moved it.
that's the only explanation. Why did he move it?
I presume so this wouldn't happen.
he knows I know their secrets, and he knows I'm not his friend.
the good news is the money exists somewhere, most likely on the agency's private network.
if that's the case, though, - you'll have your hands full trying to find it. - Why?
because the B613 network can only be accessed from within, and that's just accessed.
if you want to change something, like the algorithm that controls the flow of money, well, for that, you'll need a code
a code that is in the possession of one man and one man alone.
you may not trust me, but at least be smart enough to know my priorities and predict my behavior accordingly.
what? - I need you back here, Liv.
Why?
cause things are about to get ugly.
facing my dear cassidy's predicament,
I know why women must be allowed to make that painful choice for themselves.
what did I say?
the woman's a hypocrite.
she spent her entire political career telling women they can't have abortions while letting her daughter "D" And "C" Till the cows come home, then she flip-flops on the issue when it's politically convenient.
or personal experience helped to change her mind on the issue.
most mothers of a 13-year-old daughter would do what Sally did, Cyrus, and now all those women, they feel for her.
you did that!
you can't just lie down on the job and send some amateur in here because your boyfriend was mean to you and then expect us all to fall in line when you've licked your wounds long enough to come home.
I can expect you to listen to my directives as the manager of this campaign.
the president is meeting with senator Ramirez right now, you know, to give her the V. P. slot.
so no one here is listening to your directives
just F.Y.I.
having puerto rico, so...
senator Ramirez.
so lovely to see you again, but we're going to have to cut this meeting short.
but I just -- - Excuse me?
very important national-security matter.
you understand how that is. I know how busy you are
Yes, but -- - and we wouldn't want to leave you waiting.
thank you so much. Goodbye.
what the hell was that?
you were vetting her.
you were unspeakably rude to a United States senator.
you were vetting her as a potential vice president.
what, did you think I wouldn't find out?
senator Ramirez can deliver votes.
I told you, you are not replacing Andrew.
Ramirez brings women, hispanics, christians, she's a team player, a working mother of four.
she'd make a great V. P.
you are not replacing Andrew!
you don't tell me what to do!
I don't want to fight with you.
I don't want to fight with you, either.
Fitz, I'm going to ask you again.
what do you need?
I need Andrew gone. - No.
that's what you want.
what do you need?
I don't love her.
I don't want her back.
I'm almost indifferent to her, to the sense of betrayal.
no.
you know the answer.
we both know you know the answer.
you want me to humiliate you to make it easier for you to walk away.
I'm not gonna say it.
please don't make me say it for you.
if you make me say it for you, I'll never forgive you.
tell me.
I want to hear it from you.
what do you need?
I need Andrew to stop screwing my wife.
consider it handled.
thought we were having a strategy session with the team. - No.
it's just you and me.
what do you want, Olivia?
actually, I'm here to find out what you want.
do you want to screw Mellie Grant, or do you want to be vice president?
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
two choices -- screw Mellie, be V. P.
one or the other. Either/or. Because you can't have both.
I'm not going to allow you to have both.
he's not going to allow you to have both.
so you can either cozy up to Mellie, or you can cozy up to Fitz.
choose Fitz, and I'll protect you.
I'll keep you on the ticket.
I'll ensure your political future.
choose Mellie, and I'm sorry, Andrew, but I will have to use my considerable talents to tear you down, brick by brick, because the only way to do this, the only way to drop you from the ticket and be certain it doesn't blow back on the president is to make sure it's not just Fitz chasing you out of town, but all of America.
and while you might like living out the rest of your days teaching political science at a small, second-tier liberal-arts college,
I don't think Mellie will be by your side for it.
she's more of a "run with the big dogs" kind of woman.
so you need to make a choice.
do you want to be vice president of the United States of America for the next four years, or do you want to screw Mellie Grant for the next month?
because that's how long it'll take for her to lose interest in you once I get done destroying you.
screw Mellie, be V. P. -- your choice.
tell me something...
cause I've always been curious.
what's it like?
what? - Being you?
cutting people's throats and calling it politics?
appealing to the lowest, basest part of humanity, scraping the bottom of a person's soul, carrying out these little emotional assassinations?
governor. - I'm in love with her!
I love her.
so choose Mellie.
I wish you would.
it would restore my faith in humanity.
but if there's one thing I know, it's that, given the choice between power and love, men like you will always, always choose power.
what did he do to you?
24 hours, Governor.
if you haven't ended things with Mellie, I'll have to do my job, and life as you know it will be over.
Oh, forgive me.
no one told me you were bringing one of your degenerate, chronic-public-masturbating clients.
no, that one lives right here in the White House.
I'm the awesome client from awesome town.
more like suck-it-town, you pompous jackass.
get out of my office! - Enough!
the sniping, the infighting, it has to stop.
while we sling mud back and forth, Reston stays squeaky clean.
he's up five points overall, eight with women.
that's just in the last 72 hours.
keep it up, and we're headed toward mutually assured destruction, so from now on, instead of fighting each other, we gang up on Reston.
if we peel away his support from women, it's a two-candidate match.
and how do you propose we do that?
by telling the truth.
be relaxed but firm
trustworthy, like she can trust you.
I'm familiar with the definition of "trust worthy."
we just don't want her thinking this is some kind of double cross to take down her husband's campaign.
which it is.
and when she sees what's in that file, I'm guessing she won't mind, so maintain eye contact.
try not to look so... shifty.
do you have any advice that doesn't involve insulting me?
no.
on the gate!
Joan Reston, as I live and breathe.
let me save you some time.
Yes, I support my husband's candidacy for president, I have no comment on my own case, and I respectfully refer any other questions you may have to the office of my attorney.
Mrs. Reston -- - as I said,
I support my husband's candidacy for president, - I have no comment -- - I'm not here to ask you questions.
I'm here to let you know that you're not the one that belongs in prison.
your husband is.
it's taking everything you've got not to whip out your phone and tell Olivia Pope where her mom is right now, isn't it?
what? - Your loyalties.
are you a faithful person, Robin, to B613, to me?
I have n-never
I mean, you've been faithful in the past, right?
who else have you dated?
well, um, there was Jesse.
why'd you and Jesse break up?
he died in an explosion.
also dead. Scissors.
and now you.
who else have you dated? - I don't date people.
except you.
you're special.
look.
we're ready. Clare just needs the paperwork.
when can we expect these back?
two U. S. Passports? 24 hours.
it's more than two. - You said two.
that number's gone up.
my team. - Team?
how many people are we talking about?
24 hours.
after you drop these off, you'll need to leave town immediately.
for how long? - Forever, dear.
do you have a problem with that?
no.
if B613's account is on their server, there's only one way to get into it.
I have to turn Command's phone into a transmitter and use it to piggyback onto B613's network.
this will upload everything I need
passwords, log files, serial numbers.
you just have to place this device on Command's phone for 30 seconds.
how am I supposed to do that?
how am I supposed to get anywhere near Jake's phone long enough to...
I think you can find a way.
huck, no.
do you have any idea how many times you've asked me to do things that I didn't want to do, but I did them because you asked me to?
B613 took away my family, Liv, my life, my name.
they destroyed me.
and now we can do the same to them, which is what you said you wanted.
don't you want that anymore?
we do what we have to do.
go ahead. Shoot me.
it'd be the best thing that happened to me all day.
what do you want?
what do you
what do you want, Liv? Why are you here?
is this why you're here?
is this what you want? Is it?
how do you think Liv's gonna get what we need?
dude could probably kill you with a bendy straw, but at the end of the day, he's just a normal guy.
put a fork in him. - Or a needle.
men. Women, right?
once you let 'em in...
you're lucky you're not normal, man.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
did anyone see you? You made the bed?
I don't want the maids talking, saying we don't sleep together anymore.
that's the last thing we need during this campaign, so I need you to make Jerry's bed every morning.
or I can do it.
I made the bed.
no one saw me.
fine.
I'm wearing the Escada, so I put some ties that match it out on the bed.
I gave you three options. They're all good.
they'll photograph well.
they're a subtle match to some of the uniforms of the female vets, and the feel appropriately sober, but patriotic.
here. You want to take a look and
what's going on?
nothing. - We're waiting.
waiting? - To hear back from Clare about Adnan.
for Reston to make his prison visit.
for Jake's phone to download onto my hard drive.
great.
Reston's at the prison.
this is Olivia Pope's case file.
where did he get this?
he's a political operative, Sam. I'm sure he stole it.
what I want to know is, is it true?
did you shoot that man knowing he was my lover?
cause if you did
you'll what? Call the police on me and file for divorce?
Yes.
who's going to believe you, dear?
I am the governor of the state, and I am about to become the most powerful man on the planet.
do you know how easy it would be to have you boxed up and shipped out to a state mental ward?
one phone call, Joanie.
you'd be having supper with the rest of the lunatics across the bay.
and I would make sure that you would rot there for many, many years to come, so you, my loving wife, had better do exactly as I tell you from now on.
till death do us part. Right, honey?
I got it all -- location, travel docs, everything
but I want out. I'm gonna need your help.
okay. It's gonna be okay.
I thought about what you said, about the light.
I keep trying to figure out when I'm done, when to walk away.
when there's always more to do, more darkness than light.
is that an option for you, walking away?
I don't know. I-I just wonder I
in my 22 years in prison, you know what I missed most of all?
really good wine.
we always did have that in common.
enjoy it. It'll be your last.
I heard about your forced retirement.
sorry you lost your little army.
Oh, please do, baby. Please take a stab at me.
I wonder which one of us is faster.
what are you doing here?
I'm your mother. I love you.
I worry about you.
no, you don't. - I do.
I know it's hard for you to believe with him in your ear, but I do.
I love you.
and because I love you, I want to warn you.
you need to find yourself another line of work, because what you do now is too dangerous, baby.
I think you'd better get that.
they got to her. Liv, I was too late.
clare's dead.
Harrison, listen to me. Get back to the office.
hang up the phone right now.
you're a monster.
you forced my hand by refusing to stay out of my affairs.
I hope you've learned your lesson.
I'm a patient man, but a vengeful one, and I have a very long memory.
it's been lovely. Truly.
thanks for the wine.
now, don't go saying I was too mean just because Joan Reston didn't bite.
what makes you think she didn't bite?
Oh, I don't know, that today's news cycle got up and running at 6: 00 this morning,
and I haven't heard a peep about Reston's divorce on any of the cable shows, let alone network.
do you have any idea how easy it would be to have you boxed up and shipped out to a state mental ward?
one phone call, Joanie.
you'd be having supper with the rest of the lunatics across the bay.
now, that doesn't sound very female-friendly, does it?
it's already got 100, 000 hits, and I just uploaded it.
I'm smarter than you are, Leo.
news cycle, here we come.
the Reston campaign suffered a massive blow today -as a video of the candidate... - The video, featuring Governor Reston with his wife, Joan, has managed to go viral in less than two hours, with over...
with Governor Reston's numbers already down by 15 points from last night's BNC poll, it's clear that this election has now become a two-candidate race.
and now we're joining one of those candidates, President Grant, where he and the First Lady are speaking to the warrior women of America.
all of you have made a sacrifice.
all of you have had to suffer far more than you deserve.
you have made a sacrifice so that others may be free.
some of us don't have that kind of strength, especially at times like these, when it's so easy to be consumed by every salacious detail found in a magazine or heard on the news, but seeing you women here makes me realize just how small and petty those matters can be.
standing in the presence of such strength, such grit and resilience,
I am reminded of what's important, what really, truly matters.
and that is all of you.
the very best of us.
the very women we should all aspire to be.
some much-needed humanity on a day otherwise dominated by sexual innuendo and political maneuvering.
Andrew, wait.
did you... happen to watch the event at the veterans' hospital?
I did. I thought you did well.
we should be tracking better with women by the end of the day.
I'm glad you think so.
in fact, if you have your own ideas about what women might respond to,
I have a few hours before my next event.
we could talk.
I don't think that's a good idea.
since when?
well, I've been thinking, and, uh, you and Fitz have been such good friends to me for so long.
friends.
you take everything from me!
okay. Everybody, out.
No!
I'll go.
you just keep on being president.
you know, I used to want your job, but now I'm not sure.
your job is really hard.
my father tried to put me on a plane a few months ago.
he tried to put me on a plane and disappear me and let me start a new life and get away from all this and be somebody new, be somebody who wasn't...
and I said no.
why did I say no?
do you want to know what Olivia Pope would say?
what would Olivia Pope say?
you don't get to run.
you're a gladiator.
gladiators don't run. They fight.
they slay dragons.
they wipe off the blood and stitch up their wounds, and they live to fight another day.
you don't get to run.
how was that?
that was good.
I feel like I'm watching Mozart.
Mozart couldn't bring down B613.
I decided to meet you halfway.
are you sure you want to do this here?
because we could wait till we get to the safe house, go over the plan with Ivan and the team.
no. Let's stop and smell the roses.
she's got a freaking bomb.
15 pounds of fully nitrated gun cotton next to a lead-shielded cobalt-60 dispersion capsule.
that's not just a bomb, Robin.
that is the Mona Lisa of boom.
I'll be damned.
it worked. I'm in.
is that the budget? - That's everything.
the budget, isolated B613 communication networks, infrastructure, schematics, continuity plans, their power grid -- everything.
why aren't we going in? What are we waiting for?
chief, we've got eyes on the prize. Should we pursue?
negative. Wait for my go.
she has a bomb. - I see that.
I also want to see what she's planning to do with it.
okay, but shouldn't we... - Stand down, Agent Perkins.
copy that.
look, I don't want to just sit here doing nothing.
of course you don't.
you want to race in, wave your gun, be the hero, and then run back to Olivia Pope and say,"Caught your mom."
friends again? Can I come home now?
huck, you -- you did it.
okay.
we're breaking out the booze.
I can blow it all up, Liv.
right here, from my desk, right now, I can shut down B613.
let's head out.
wait, we're gonna lose her.
we wait for command!
should I?
should I shut down B613 right now?
shut it down.
they're asking about the package.
team needs to prep.
are we going White House or campaign trail?
target is on the move!
stand down. Repeat, stand do
it's not a brownout.
it's some kind of internal malfunction.
fix it. I need it back now.
this is not good.
the hell with this.
wait! Come back here!
so now we know whose side you're on.
just call command.
we're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
I know we haven't had a lot to celebrate around here in the last few months.
sometimes, it seems the battles weren't winnable, or at least not worth the blood spilled fighting them, but then a moment like this comes around, and it makes you feel like it's all worth it, that we're finally stepping back into the light.
we did this, people. We made this happen.
gladiators.
here, here.
what the hell have you done?!
I don't know what you're talking about.
no? Then let me be the one who breaks it to you.
you just killed the president.
Amanda tanner is pregnant. - What?
I want to tell the world what he did.
I want them all to burn for this.
you don't have to worry about that sex tape, because who needs a sex tape when you've got a fetus full of presidential d. n.a?
that's not my baby.
I'm out. I'm gonna tell them the truth.
she's not our problem. She's a kid.
our real problem is olivia pope.
president fitzgerald thomas grant iii has declared war on you, olivia.
may god have mercy on your foul.
answers, people. We need answers, and time is of the essence.
her phone's gone and her purse. She ran away.
you told her she was gonna have to go on tv, she freaked out, and she ran away.
I gotta say, as crime scenes go, it's pretty clean.
no broken locks, no signs of struggle, and I'm not finding any prints aside from yours and amanda's.
because it's not a crime scene. Because she ran away.
there's someone watching you. - What?
your trash is gone, and it's not trash day, and there's a sedan parked across the street
u. S. Government plates, tinted windows.
what about amanda, huck?
whoever it was came up through the service elevator, picked the lock on the back door, sedated her, taped her up, got her in a duffel bag.
in and out, probably seven minutes, six if they were quick.
how do you know?
that's how I would do it.
my secretary has a standing order to stop you from walking in here.
Alissa, you're fired.
one of my clients is missing.
have you looked in jail? You often seem to find them there.
her name is amanda tanner. She's 27 and she was staying in my apartment.
how long has she been gone?
five, six hours.
you consider that missing? That's barely enough time to rack up a good bar tab.
Oh, god. - What's wrong?
I know I ask a lot of you, but this amanda thing is big.
she's a good kid and she was under my protection. Can you help me find her?
I'll see what I can do.
thank you, david.
don't fire alissa. I snuck in while she was in the bathroom.
you're late.
I keep trying amanda's phone, but it goes straight to voice mail.
when I say "all hands on deck..."
Harrison, she's our client. She's missing.
I mean all hands on deck. - We should be doing things.
things should be happening. Shouldn't we at least file a missing persons report?
just 'cause you don't see things happening, doesn't mean things aren't happening.
with olivia, things are always happening.
I just don't - What could possibly be more important than amanda right now?
that.
I first met paul ten years ago at the governor's conference.
I thought my speech was pretty killer, so when paul took me aside afterward,
I was looking forward to simply "Congratulations, fitz. You moved me to tears."
and then for ten very long minutes, he told me, point by point, why every word out of my mouth was not only wrong but potentially the dumbest thing any politician had ever said.
senator sanchez told you the hard truth because he cared, because he thought we could all do better.
he scored no political points and never asked for anything in return, but he earned my profound gratitude, and today, my profound sadness.
of course the senator would be the first to object if I stood up here today and talked about him and failed to mention the 119 other people who died this morning.
this is... A tragic day for all of us.
our prayers are with all those who lost loved ones on flight 684.
Where's my daughter?
any information at all?
ms. Pope, Nelson O'shea, pilots' union. Nice to finally meet you.
Yes. I wish it were under better circumstances.
Yes. Very sad.
so it's a standard crash investigation.
we'll need you to make a statement on belief of the pilots' union to the press as soon as possible.
the airline p. r. Is up there right now, so - you let them go first?
I didn't think it was a problem.
sky national has immediately activated our emergency response protocol and is in direct contact with the f. a.a. And n. t.s. b.
although our primary concern at this time is for the passengers on board the aircraft and their families, we're able to assure you, this particular plane has a perfect safety record.
and there it is.
they're saying it's the pilot's fault.
no, he didn't. He just said
they're not saying it, but they're saying it, and this crowd's eating it up with a spoon.
make sure we know when the memorial is so we can clear my schedule.
sir, we ought to take this chance to bring the d. r.e. a.m. Act to a vote.
Cyrus. The poor man's still scattered across the virginia countryside, and you want to start using him to leverage a vote?
paul wanted this more than anything.
a pathway to citizenship for immigrant kids who go to college-He'd be honored.
it's a divisive issue, even within our own party.
let me put a call in to his wife, she if she'll reach out to the fence sitters.
how close is the vote?
nose count has us within four or five.
we're gonna look opportunistic.
never let a crisis go to waste, Mr. President.
make the call.
and how long was her tour of duty in the air national guard?
and she flew c-141s out of dover?
okay. Thank you so much.
how many times do I have to tell you you can't just walk in here whenever you feel like it?
look, amanda tanner is gone, and that means my story is gone, but it also means your client is gone, so I thought I could just walk in here and talk to you.
if amanda is gone- And I'm not saying she is-Then I'm sure olivia's working on it.
well, I saw the news. Doesn't she have her hands full with this plane crash?
sometimes just because you can't see things happening doesn't mean they're not happening...
or something, you know, if she is gone.
there's a missing persons report, quinn.
there's a report? Who-who filed it?
Amanda's father.
so what are you calling yourself now?
Huck. You?
huck finn? That's funny.
well, charlie, like charlie brown?
I thought you were dead.
I'm not dead.
huck freaking finn?
don't make fun of my name.
you out of business?
I was never in business.
it's lucrative when you contract out.
I'm a retired government employee.
Oh, really? You sure?
you know what they say - "once you go black, you never go back."
ops, that is. Black ops.
you never could tell a decent joke.
so what do you want then?
female, 5'4," 105 pounds, 27 years old - Amanda lynn tanner.
don't know what you're talking about.
you're getting sloppy in your old age.
you crossed the street at a light. I got you on the traffic cam.
well, then. You don't need to ask me about her, now do you?
you got me on the traffic cam.
Yeah. But where is she?
no. No. That's just tacky. That's tasteless. You know better than to ask.
what did you think? That you were gonna buy me an assassin's brunch and then we'd hold hands?
no. Jeez. Now you're off looking for missing girls?
come on. Tacky. Stop looking. She's gone.
Hey, you ever want to come back, make a little more money than the U. S. Governays, you give me a call.
talent like yours should not go to waste.
and, uh... It's not like charlie brown.
like manson. Charlie manson. Now that's a name.
huck finn? Come on.
Hey, buddy.
welcome, everyone.
this is the preliminary c. v.r. Meeting of all interested parties to sky national flight 684.
this morning, I'll play the black box recording in its entirety without stopping.
you'll hear it once and once only.
the national transportation safety board prohibits you from recording what you're about to hear.
you are allowed to take notes, but you are prohibited from taking those notes from this room.
any questions?
here it is, my special fruit drink.
that's good. What's in it?
cranberry, grapefruit.
it'd be perfect with some vodka.
sky national 684, you're cleared to descend to and maintain 5, 000.
Roger national 684. We'll be out of 15 for 5.
...national 684, you have a sky coast aerostream 4 miles away at 2: 00.
possible wake turbulence. You may feel a bump or two.
684. Got the aerostream.
and I feel the bump or two.
hang on. I'm pitching down. We're nosedown.
sky national 684, I show descending. What's your status?
kick rudder. Lori, left rudder. Left rudder.
sky national 684, what's your status?
684. Emergency.
left rudder. Left rudder! what the hell are you
Oh, here we go.
no, there was a loud bang and the captain was saying "hang on."
no, that was the first officer.
fine. But I can't remember if he said it before or after the two thumps.
before, I think. Maybe after. I don't know.
I - I should've written the whole thing on my arm.
before... The two thumps.
it was loud thump, loud thump, long clicking sound, short clicking sound, then three faint thumps.
the first officer saying,"left rudder." Left rudder. What the hell are you-aah! Here we go.
I got a good ear.
but I'll tell you what I didn't hear in the last ten seconds - The pilot.
as soon as they hit the wake from the aerostream, I think she panicked, maybe overcorrected.
it was like she didn't hear. She-she froze.
which is exactly what the airline will say.
if sky national can prove pilot error, they save millions of dollars.
they don't have to ground their fleet, do extra maintenance.
they have every reason to want to trash lori mackelson in the press, cast her as a panicking, p.m. s.ing woman who can't handle a little turbulence.
Lori had 16, 000 flight hours under her belt. She didn't panic.
she was a great pilot, under any conditions. She did not freeze.
can I help you, sir?
not unless you can bring my wife back.
all I want them to do is to get out there and say she didn't do this.
believe me, andrew. We're gonna do everything we can to clear your wife's name.
why haven't you said anything? The news has already said the plane was perfect.
can't you just call a - a press conference?
if I get up there and play defense, hold my gloves in front of my face, it confirms their narrative.
we need to change their narrative.
we need to anticipate what they're going to say about lori before they say it and then hit back with evidence.
so lay it on me. What is the worst thing they can say?
she's been sober for over 20 years.
she still goes to a. a. Meetings from time to time.
so she's an alcoholic.
that's not how I would phrase it.
which is why they will.
sources say that the flight crew, including the captain and first officer, were drinking at their hotel the night before the flight...
F. A. A. Regulations prohibit the consumption of alcohol 12 hours before a plane's scheduled departure time.
the crew was in direct violation of these regulations.
boy, were they hammered. Not the pilots, though, right?
two pilots, six flight attendants - Hammered.
even... I said "y'all better not be flying tomorrow.
she says to me,"don't worry. These planes these days - They fly themselves." Can you believe it?
according to the manufacturer, the mw-85 has a perfect safety record.
it's one of the top performing passenger planes in the world.
the plane has met with nothing but praise from the aviation community.
I could lose my job. - I just need a quick peek at the mechanic reports.
you're asking for a lot. You're not offering much there, stevie.
no one will ever know.
Oh, our little secret, huh?
maybe if you want to come by my apartment around 8: 00?
I'd like to get in a workout and have some time to rinse off.
early indications from the black box recording indicate that the airport tower tried to communicate with the pilot...
damn it. They already leaked what was on the black box?
somewhere in that recording is the truth. We need our own copy.
I'll get huck on it.
pleas from the first officer also appear to have been ignored.
I was this close to getting the mechanic's report.
what happened?
I lost my superpowers. I'm engaged.
I can't use every tool in the box anymore.
and by tool, you would mean your
okay. Just find another tack, stephen. We need those reports.
the bartender confirms that both pilots and all six flight attendants were drinking.
six? Manifest listed five.
you think one of 'em didn't make the flight?
black box recording. - How'd you get it?
N. T.S. B. Server. Kid's play. Olivia, may I talk to you?
check the airline schedule. See what attendants were supposed to fly 684.
got it. - In your office?
see what other flight crews were passing through philly that night. - Got it.
Where's quinn? Has anybody seen quinn?
I think she went out. - Where's the manifest?
on my desk. - She's dead.
if there is a missing flight attendant who is alive right now, we need to find her before the airline does.
Amanda tanner is dead!
are you sure?
pull down your wdow.
you tell your boy-you talk into that little radio in your sleeve and you tell the president I know.
I know what he did to her. I know!
shanker and holiday are both on board, but we're still three votes short.
you'd make it a lot easier on the v. p. Ic you could throw in a few carrots for border security.
it might give us something to work with.
come on now, billy. Are you telling me you can't work with bright, energetic young people earning their way to citizenship through good grades and hard work?
it's not that, Mr. President.
great. Then I will count on the vice president's active support.
yeah?
who is this?
Hank tanner. I'm amanda's father. Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I stopped by amanda's place and found Mr. Tanner outside.
Amanda said that she came to work for you after she left the white house.
Yes, that's right.
I don't mean to be a bother here, but, uh, I've-I've been talking to mandy every day since she was in the hospital, and then I haven't heard anything from her, so I decided to come up here and make sure that everything was all right.
her mother is really worried about her.
it's okay, Mr. Tanner. Everything's going to be fine. I promise.
Mr. Tanner, you look like you could use a cup of tea.
Quinn, would you help me get some tea for Mr. Tanner?
thank you.
what you did back there? You made a promise. We don't make promises.
but - Amanda tanner is dead.
wh - She's dead.
how do you know? - We know.
but we can't tell him we know because we're not supposed to know, and there is no body.
so right now, we're gonna go back in there and give that nice man a cup of tea and tell him we are doing everything in our power to find his daughter.
and don't ever promise an outcome we can't deliver.
I have to take this.
are we on a secure line?
why the hell are you threatening my agents?
you mean the men you sent to follow and scare me?
you told them that you know what I did to her.
to who? Amanda tanner?
playing dumb doesn't suit you. - Olivia, either say what you mean or stop
war is war? Fine.
but murder... Is murder.
Amanda's dead?
she has a dad - A really nice man who's looking for his daughter.
how do you think he's gonna feel when he finds out that the man he voted for had his daughter killed?
I didn't do this.
you know me. You know I didn't do this.
I don't know anything.
trust your gut.
your gut's never wrong.
I don't have a gut anymore.
Livvie... Come to the white house and look me in the eye.
we need to talk about this face-to-face.
face-to-face is over. That girl is dead.
this wasn't... me.
you know me.
and the thought that I would ever, that I could ever...
you know me.
if you didn't kill her, we both know who did.
tell me I'm wrong.
you let a pit bull off his leash, he mauls a baby.
no one blames the dog. You let cyrus off his leash.
that's on you.
Carly reston? - Yeah?
you're a flight attendant for sky national?
Oh, god. Look, I called in sick before I went to bed last night, which is more than six hours in advance, so if you couldn't find anyone to cover, it's not my fault.
you're not from corporate, are you?
all of them? Everyone?
Yes. - Sammi?
all of them. Everyone.
I need to know if captain mackelson was drinking at your party at the bar last night.
Lori? No way. She's been sober for, like, a million years.
goes to meetings at every city on the route.
she almost never comes out with us anyway.
the only reason she even came out with us last night is 'cause it was my birthday.
you didn't tell me amanda tanner useded to work in the white hou.
you didn't tell me she had a previous suicide attempt.
you pretty much didn't tell me a single thing about the girl whom you tasked me with finding.
so if I'm about to step into political quicksand here, i'd like to know it before I sink.
I can't tell you any more than I've told you.
but you know more. If you can't tell me more, then you're actually obstructing justice.
I'm sorry, david.
you know what the flags are for?
yellow's where they picked up pieces of the fuselage.
red's for body parts.
I heard one of the emergency workers talking.
it's how they keep track of whose parts are whose.
Andrew, you should really get back - When my mom died, we had an open casket.
when my dad died, we had an open casket.
it's how we say good-bye.
what are my kids gonna see when they look in lori's casket? A red flag?
I'd like to correct... In the strongest terms possible...
the idea that the pilot, lori mackelson, had been drinking the night before the crash.
she had not, and we have a witness to that effect.
a little history about lori - She was married to andrew mackelson for 17 years.
they have two boys - Carter, age 15, and jonathan, age 12.
I don't want to ask you to do this because it's... Not what you do anymore.
you want the body.
I know what I'm asking.
and if it's too much for you, if you don't want to, you can say no. That'll be the end of it.
we'll find another way.
I'll take care of it.
huck, you need reeling in, you call me.
I'll come for you.
I got this. I'm good to go.
no problem.
Digrazzo flipped!
it took a lot of pork and a guarantee of heavy campaigning from you in new jersey come mid-terms.
we're only two away now.
Amanda tanner's dead.
how sad.
aren't you gonna ask how it happened?
no. Should i?
a young woman died.
a member of this administration.
I said how sad I was.
you didn't hear me? I'll say it again. How sad.
let's lower the flags.
for god sakes, cy, show some respect.
120 innocent americans
children, mommies and daddies and best friends and husbands and wives died in that plane crash yesterday.
that's sad.
we lost one of the few sane and worthy members of the senate yesterday.
that's sad.
four navy s. e.a. l.s died in afghanistan, and...
that doesn't even touch sudan, congo, northern mexico.
that's sad.
but the disturbed girl who made it her life's mission to take down this administration, the one who was happily- No, gleefully- Carrying your illegitimate bastard child- She's no longer with us?
well, I'm sorry if I'm not sitting shivah.
I'm sorry if I can't help but see the millions of people that we'll actually be able to help now that amanda tanner is gone.
I am sorry, but this is a good thing.
it is a good thing for us.
it is a good thing for the country.
what happened to mckinley?
I was just getting used to seeing his judge-y face every morning.
he's being restored. His judge-y face got flaky.
what's your preference - Madison or van buren?
van buren has a certain wisdom about him.
what's bothering you?
I think we're gonna pass the d. r.e. a.m. Act.
Cyrus is on it like a dog with a bone.
you know he called sanchez' widow?
good. It needs to be passed.
still, there should be limits. We're political animals. We're not animals.
sometimes I think he's too willing to go to extremes.
Tom, hal, would you come here, please?
Tom? - Yes, ma'am?
you would take a bullet for the president, wouldn't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Hal? - Yes, ma'am, I would.
thank you. That's all.
there isn't a person in this building who isn't willing to go to extremes for you.
I got it.
you got it? - Got what?
mechanic report-I got it.
how'd you get it?
I got it.
I bet you did.
I looked through 200 reports, every inspection made on this plane in the last year.
these are two separate reports.
this one's signed and dated by a mechanic hoin penix last fall...
this one's signed and dated by a mechanic in philly a week ago-the last inspection before the crash.
no problems reported in either.
that's bad for us, right? That means the plane was fine.
read line four - "power controll unit.
notice anything?
he misspelled "control," but...
line four. - oh, It's misspelled here, too.
what are the chances?
identical reports signed by different mechanics in different cities, months apart?
the philly report is fake.
the last inspection of the plane before it crashed was forged?
what's your status?
kick rudder. Lori, left rudder. Left rudder.
sky national 684, what's your status?
684. Emergency.
left rudder. Left rudder! What the hell are you 684. Emergency.
thank you.
684. Emergency.
that is your signature.
no, it is, but that's not my report. That's not my handwriting.
I wouldn't misspell "control."I won my sixth grade spelling bee.
you were the last one to inspect the plane before it crashed.
can you tell me what you said in your report?
Hey, I just turn 'em in, all right? This thing's not on me.
I'm not here to blame you. I just want you to remember.
look, it's important.
first, I would've checked the p. c.u.then the summing levers.
and you want to make sure they're okay, 'cause if they're not, you risk the rudder deflecting to full blowdown limit.
I'm just trying to think if something was going on with the levers.
if there was, I would've put the plane down.
I seem to remember recommending that for one of my birds.
slow down. Just... I don't want to miss any of this.
what exactly are you saying? Are you saying
there's something wrong with the plane. - What?
she didn't panic. She didn't freeze.
she was-she was doing everything right. That's what the noises are.
it's her responding, but it didn't matter,'cause there was something wrong with the plane.
I know. I know.
just showing up at someone's house-it's so tacky.
but we really do need to talk about what happened to amanda tanner.
okay, charlie?
Lori, left rudder. Left rudder. Right there.
hear that? Those three soft thumps.
they're there. Trust me. - Trust him.
it's the sound of lori pushing on the left rudder, but the pedal won't move.
it won't let her go left. - Why not?
the thing that makes the rudder go left or right
according to the mechanic, one of its parts was bent.
it'd be like making a right turn in your car and having the steering wheel lock up on you.
the mechanic mentions the bent lever in his report, but... That report is gone.
this is good, andrew. We can use this.
it means lori did everything in her power to stop that plane from going down.
it means it wasn't her fault.
then whose fault was it?
my wife is dead. 120 people are dead.
who's to blame for that?
well, we really appreciate your help.
and I know senator sanchez would, too. This is a great way to honor him.
we'll have you and lynn over to dinner at the residence next week.
okay. Thank you, senator.
Yeah. Bye.
Jankowski's in.
well done, everyone!
all right! As long as brownhill's gallbladder keeps him at home, we have got a tie.
and the deciding vote is cast by the vice president.
I'm sorry. I tried again this morning, but
don't do this to me, billy.
we're gonna need one more.
get your boss up here. This has gone far enough.
I don't want you to think that I'm doing this because I'm mad at you.
I'm not. I'm not.
you trained me, but it was the agency, really.
they... Took stuff from me, and not just my name or my ability to ever contact my family again.
I was young, I was fresh out of college, and they made it sound fun.
we had fun, didn't we? That's the problem.
it's horrible and it's sickening, and just when you think you can't take any more, it gets fun.
the u. s. Government really knows its stuff, yeah?
something in you just falls away, and it gets fun.
there's a high. It's good.
it's so good, which is what I wanna remind you of-how good it can get.
you think about that.
okay, I'm thinking about it 'cause I'm rusty. I'm sober.
this is gonna be bad for me for a while, but I'm gonna push through the horrible and the sickening and then something's gonna fall away, and I'm gonna start enjoying myself. All right?
and we both know...What an artist I can be.
and like any junkie, i'm gonna enjoy the high for as long as I can. Okay?
are you ready, old friend?
madam vice president.
thanks for coming on such short notice.
it's an honor to be invited to the party, sir.
I just came from a prayer meeting.
you know how my people like to pray.
I do.
my cassidy was only 12 years old when I was deciding whether or not to take the v. p. Slot, and she said,"do it, mama. Governor grant walks with the lord.
can you believe she was only 12 years old?
very... Precocious, that cassidy.
we did it, sally.
the d. r.e. a.m. Act is tied in the senate, and you will have the great honor of casting the deciding vote.
sir, I'm afraid that I
we made a hell of a team out on the campaign trail, didn't we?
the children of illegal immigrants should not be allowed to take part in the bounty of america。
Mr. President. That is not god's plan.
I will never forget the way you brought those people to their feet in utah.
rain pouring down on 10, 000 tired people, and they jumped up like a baptist choir.
that is the closest I've ever seen to political magic.
I'm not saying that they shouldn't be allowed to partake in certain paths to legal immigration
you're an experienced politician and a woman of god, so I'm not gonna waste your time by trying to talk you into something that you've obviously given a lot of serious thought to.
so let's just get right to it.
you intend to be president one day. - Sir, I
and whatever our disagreements, this country could use a woman president.
but of the 14 vice presidents in our history who have gone on to assume the presidency, do you know how many have done so without the endorsement of the president they served?
none, sir.
we are going to do great things together, you and I.
great things.
and we're going to start by passing the d. r.e. a.m. Act.
sir?
it's my honor, sir.
she's in.
deal closed. We're good.
the bill will pass, no problem, or I will tear her right-wing guts out.
I'm back. I am back.
we got a blackmail letter.
a demand. It's not olivia. It's not amanda.
Olivia's not this crazy, and amanda is dead.
which means there's someone else, a third party.
Olivia did not send us that sex tape. Someone else did.
Cyrus, what's the demand?
Oh, Charlie, you make a beautiful noise.
they did, you know, take stuff from me - The u. s. Government.
after I started nonot being able to slp after I started crying when I wrapped a guy in plastic, they put me in a hole nobody wants to be in.
and I don't mean a metaphorical hole. I mean, an actual hole.
they took stuff from me, charlie.
so much stuff, that I was homeless, on the subway, begging for change when liv found me, which is why I'm breaking my sobriety,'cause she asked, okay?
and I'm telling you this because I want you to understand that I owe her, so I'm not gonna stop until you tell me where amanda is. You get that?
tell me where she is.
Charlie, I have a scalpel, a 10-blade.
I will peel you like a grape.
you're gonna retire to new mexico. It's nice there.
but first, you're gonna tell me where amanda tanner's body is. All right?
all right. - Okay.
Alissa, you're fired again.
what?
14th street bridge.
you're gonna need a diving team.
you okay?
not really.
okay. - Okay.
good evening.
this is the 37th time i have spoken to you from this office.
I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved.
therefore... I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
as we look to the future, the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this nation, to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us.
I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in america.
what exactly are you insinuating, Ms. Pope?
I don't like to insinuate.
I'd rather deduce likely scenarios.
and in my scenario, you get a mechanic's report that says you have to ground all your mw-85s, which would cost you millions and send your customers running to your competitors.
you'd worry about what your stockholders are going to say.
you'd worry about your job. That's understandable.
if I'm c. e.o.it's the last thing I'd want.
so one report goes missing- No harm, no foul
that is until 120 people fall out of the sky.
this is not some kind of conspiracy. If that's what
she doesn't insinuate. She deduces.
I started this airline with one plane, two pilots, and an old furniture warehouse converted to a hangar.
I lost seven employees yesterday.
the senior flight attendant, sammi tyler, was one of my first hires.
believe me, I want the truth just as much as you do.
so why did this report disappear?
why didn't it get passed up the line?
I don't know.
somebody does.
Phyllis hayes?
I'm, uh, harrison wright. I'm here to
I know why you're here, Mr. Wright.
two people used to do my job, and now it's just me.
that's not an excuse. It just means things pile up.
I had a huge backlog of mechanic reports from all over the country and I had to get them out, push them up the ladder.
they fire you if you don't get them in on time to headquarters.
but my youngest daughter was having a piano recital and I didn't want to miss it.
I - I already missed one this year.
so I duplicated one of the reports.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
I believe this is what you're looking for.
I'm never going to hear her play without thinking about... All those people.
she's very good at the piano... My daughter.
I'm sure she is, Ms. Hayes.
I've come here tonight to express my sincere condolences to the victims and the families of flight 684.
as of this afternoon, sky national has participated fully in the n. t.s. b. Investigation, and we understand and accept our role in the events leading up to the crash.
so I would like to take this time to apologize to all those who lost loved ones in this tragic event, including the families of the crew, and of captain lori mackelson, who fought so valiantly until the end to prevent this terrible tragedy.
thank you.
that's mandy... That's my daughter.
she didn't suffer.
how do you...
cause I know what you do to people to make them suffer.
she didn't suffer.
it was a... Good... Death.
thank you.
it's okay.
Hal? Tom? Can you guys come in here a second, please?
what if I wanted to get out of here?
sir? - The press corps lid is on.
the staff has all gone home. What if I wanted to leave?
I don't think - That's not possible, sir.
you're gonna tell me 41 never left?
43 never went out for a drink?
okay, seriously. 42?
bill Clinton. William Jefferson Clinton never left?
I wouldn't know anything about past presidents
kennedy never left the white house in secret? What am I, born yesterday?
sir, we have no knowledge of - Fine.
I want to go somewhere spontaneously. How do I do that?
I would inform our immediate supervisor at the secret service, who'd inform the head of the secret service and the white house press secretary, who'd inform the white house press corps.
150 individuals would assemble, along with your bulletproof presidential limousine, your chase and follow car, your ambulance, two unmarked vehicles, as well as the sharpshooters and the marine guard
no. - sir?
what if I wanted to go somewhere alone, no secret service, no press, no anything?
technically, the president of the united states is allowed to refuse the protection of secret service, - but, uh - "but, uh," what?
it needs to be approved by the secretary of the treasury, sir...
and recorded in the national record.
I'm not a prisoner. - No, sir.
I am the most powerful man on the planet. - Yes, sir.
but I can't leave my house. - No, sir.
you see where I might be a little bit annoyed?
Yes, sir.
I am a grown man. I am going to leave here.
if I have to walk out to the staff parking lot with you two following me, jump into someone's 1994 civic and drive off without protection, I am going to leave.
I would like to be safe and not jeopardize the economy of this country when I did so.
can you come up with a way to make that happen?
two sedans, covered parking, one sharpshooter, and your ambulance.
one sedan and covered parking. No sharpshooters and no ambulance.
one sedan, covered parking, no sharpshooters, we keep the ambulance and add two agents.
sold.
just like 43. - Yeah.
personal belongings on her body, no sign of foul play, slashed her wrists a month ago.
cops want to rule it a suicide.
coroner wants to rule it a suicide.
so it's gonna be ruled a suicide.
Yep.
so... Who do you think killed her?
see, I've got this nagging feeling you've got a pretty good idea.
I know I give you a long leash on a lot of things, and I like to, because despite my better judgment and all my protests to the contrary,
I really do consider you a friend.
but I can't look the other way here, not on this.
I'm an assistant u. s. Attorney, liv.
I prosecute crime. I get the bad guys.
so at some point, even with you, I gotta draw the line.
I gotta do my job.
gotta be the sheriff.
the white hat looks good on you.
Lisa. I'm gonna need that autopsy report fast-tracked as soon as you can.
well, I can tell you right now it's gonna be a suicide.
I'm still gonna need that report.
are you still engaged?
not so engaged that I... I don't remember the freezer.
I left you ten messages. I just heard. It's horrible.
I couldn't reach you. I didn't know what to do, so I-I just started making grilled cheese, because it's literally the only thing I know how to make, and it's comfort food, and I figured you'd be hungry, and you
Quinn, are you okay?
...congressman Mike pence of Indiana...
welcoming the compromise, but cautioning against taking too much credit...
what? Wait. Hold on. Coming!
Stephen. - It's not his.
what? - I just got the coroner's report.
the blood type's not a match.
Amanda was pregnant, but the baby was not the president's. liv?
Jorge!
Jorgito!
el Chupacabra!
el Chupacabra!
all right, you got mail.
I would love for you and your friends to enjoy a relaxing stay with my family here in Veracruz.
it'll be great to finally meet my American pen pal.
sounds great! And I can practice my Spanish.
Jeepers! You have mail.
I thought I'd catch you at your computer.
so, what do you think?
of course. I'd love to go to Mexico. Yes!
I mean, si!
let's ask Velma.
Jinkies! You have mail.
Mexico?
the art, the museums, the pyramids...
I'm there!
great! Let's check with the guys.
Zoinks! Like, you have mail.
Mexico? Tomorrow?
like, let me check.
what have we got tomorrow, Scoob? Let's see. Daydreaming at 1 0: 00...
napping, snoozing, relaxing...
like, sorry, guys, looks like I'm booked.
reah, rooked!
do you realize we'll be there for the annual Day of the Dead celebration?
like, what's that?
a holiday in which families gather at the cemetery and celebrate their ancestors who are allowed to come back to Earth for two days.
cemetery? Sounds scary!
not at all.
just a bunch of kids in costumes, lots of skeleton-shaped cookies and candy.
basically, it's non-stop eating.
sounds like Halloween! -Exactly!
so, what do you say? -Can't talk now, guys.
like, Scoob and I gotta pack!
looks like that's everything.
like, what'd I forget?
are you sure this is the place?
Yeah, this is it.
like, looks kind of... -Quaint?
small.
welcome to Mexico! -Hi, how are you?
nice to meet you.
you must be Fred. -That's right.
and you must be Alejo.
let me introduce you to the gang. This is
no need.
they're exactly as you described. Daphne, Velma...
senor Scooby.
is this Shaggy?
he doesn't look like he could eat you out of house and home.
he's got a high metabolism.
please, let me introduce you to my family.
isn't this where you live?
no, these are just the guest cottages.
you will each have your own. This is where we live.
welcome to my family's hotel...
la Villa Bella.
it's beautiful!
what does "bella" mean?
beautiful.
la Villa Bella is very, very bella!
reah, rery rella!
let me show you around.
this is my wife, Sofia, and my mother, Dona Dolores.
welcome!
and in the pool is the rest of my family.
Jorge, Oliver, Natalia, Cristina, Fernanda, Carolina, Mirelia, Gabriella and Sebastian.
and this is Chiquita!
are they all your children?
No! Only Jorgito.
the rest are just visiting for the Day of the Dead festivities.
here in Mexico, family is more important.
you must be hot and tired after your long trip.
please feel free to join the children in the pool.
I think Scooby has already won someone's heart.
my older brother, Luis, manages the cafe with his fiancee, Charlene.
Howdy!
Lemme grab ya'll a cup of caffay lay-chair-a whilst you take a load off.
you can see why I fell...
how do you Americans say, "head over heels" for Charlene.
I met her on my last trip to the United States at Mister Smiley's Fantastic Funland and I've been smiling ever since.
you know, cafe lechera is famous in Veracruz.
first, one server pours you thick coffee...
then the custom is to bang on your glass with your spoon...
until another server arrives to pour hot milk in your glass.
ain't that a hoot?
I just love these loco customs.
"Loco," that's "crazy" in Mexican. I mean, Spanish.
you know, some days I grind so many coffee beans...
I swear the little suckers are coming outta my ears!
it didn't take long for Scooby to start living la vida mocha!
this lunch is really wonderful, Dona Dolores.
whoever came up with the whole fiesta tradition is okay in my book.
it is often followed by another tradition...
ia siesta, an afternoon nap.
even better!
Reah! Reven retter!
the purpose of fiestas and siestas, is to provide sustenance and rest for another tradition: hard work.
traditions, like, who needs 'em?
forgive me for interrupting your meal, Dona Dolores...
but I need to discuss some urgent business with your sons.
as you wish.
excuse us, please. This won't take long.
Diego Fuente used to do business with my late husband.
I don't trust him, never did.
he is a... How do you say in America?
crook?
liar? -Con man?
jerk!
for the last time, I told you, no.
now, please leave. We have guests.
I apologize for the disturbance.
please, finish your meal.
that man is as stubborn as a bull.
he wants to buy our father's land and he won't take no for an answer.
maybe it is not such a bad idea, Alejo.
putting all your assets into land is foolish.
we made a promise to Papa before he died...
and I don't intend to break it now.
so, how will you be spending your first day in Veracruz?
we were hoping to watch the preparations for the Day of the Dead festivities.
if anyone's still alive to honor the dead.
don't ya'll know about the big ol' monster?
you must have noticed by now that our hotel is relatively empty.
that's because a monster has been terrorizing Veracruz and the nearby villages.
right after I sent the e-mail to you...
the monster showed up near the plaza and nearly got Jorgito.
I immediately e-mailed you again to warn you, but you must've already left.
did you say monster?
Yes, the locals call him "El Chupacabra."
I've read about him. He's Mexico's version of the Bigfoot.
Rigfoot?
that's right.
I am not a superstitious man, but I saw it with my own eyes down by the wharf.
I will never forget it.
he stands nearly 10 feet tall and walks on two hind legs.
he's covered with thick fur...
has the face of a hideous monkey...
with huge paws and sharp fangs.
and his eyes glow green like those of a demon.
calm down, everybody!
the Chupacabra's only a myth!
Yes, let's forget about El Chupacabra...
and make the most of your first visit to Mexico.
why don't we all get a good night's sleep?
Yes, there's nothing to worry about.
Alejo's right.
but just in case, double lock your doors.
say your prayers.
and whatever you do, don't go outside!
like, whoever heard such a ridiculous story?
a 10-foot hairy monster with big feet and sharp teeth?
sounds like something out of a cartoon!
like, pleasant dreams, Scoob.
see you in the morning.
like, it's gonna be a long night.
Yeah.
did you hear that? Sounds like something outside the window.
probably just a little bird or a squirrel.
el caba-choo-choo! I mean, la kooka-babka!
el popa-choopa! No, I mean, help!
no, Scoob! He's trying to break in!
like, we're trapped! Let's get out of here!
what happened to you two? -And what was all that noise?
like, that big Mexican Bigfoot was trying to get us!
Oh, no! Where's Daphne?
Oh, no, you don't.
this is no time to be chicken.
it's all for one and one for all.
like, I've always felt teamwork was highly overrated.
okay, guys, on the count of three, we'll charge the door.
ready? One, two...
three!
charge!
we thought these were the eyes of the El Chupacabra.
sorry, guys.
I was afraid to go to sleep and thought some Latin rhythms would calm me down.
looks like Alejo's stories riled everyone.
like, anybody got a bandage?
I don't know what you heard, guys, but I think we're safe now.
let's all try and get some... Wait a minute! What's this?
Footprints! Big ones.
don't look, or we'll never get to sleep.
notice how they lead to the cottage window...
then reverse direction and head off towards the hotel?
we must've scared whatever it was away.
it was brave enough when we were separated...
but got scared at the thought of a bunch of us to contend with.
not a very courageous monster.
whatever it is, it's gone.
maybe now we can all get some sleep.
we're gonna need it. We've got a big day tomorrow.
Yeah, sightseeing and chocolate bean tamales!
can't wait!
that's not exactly what I meant, Shaggy.
we've got a mystery on our hands.
Zoinks!
...and whatever it was, we scared it away.
I got up early, and using my mud mask made a cast of the footprint from Bigfoot's big foot.
look!
it's huge!
and look, it is speckled with some kind of gritty black stuff.
is it dirt?
I don't think so.
I don't know what it is.
whatever it is, please do not mention it to my mother or Sofia.
or Charlene. I don't want to scare them.
in fact, I better alert the security guards to be especially vigilant.
if word of this gets out...
we will lose the few tourists we have managed to keep.
el Chupacabra could ruin our livelihood...
not to mention everyone else's in Veracruz.
don't worry. No matter how huge ferocious or bloodthirsty this vicious Chupacabra monster may be...
we'll get to the bottom of the mystery.
you can count on us, right, gang?
you just thanked my family for their generous hospital and delicious comets.
I almost forgot.
I know this is silly, hon. But it's a good luck charm.
with that big ol' Bigfoot thang out there, y'all can't be too careful.
promise me you won't never take it off.
Si, I promise, Charlene.
as you can see, there aren't many tourists here...
since the Chupacabra incident.
this place is usually very busy this time of year.
I've got an idea. Why don't we ask the locals about the monster.
good idea, Fred. We can videotape them.
great! I'll be the reporter.
and action!
a seesaw...
a jungle gym...
a merry-go-round.
at first glance, this modest playground looks like any other.
but the children here in Veracruz are fearful...
and have good reason to be.
el Chupacabra. Imaginary Bigfoot?
or big scary monster that could bite your head off?
you decide.
what does El Chupacabra look like?
a gorilla!
a bear!
an alien!
what does El Chupacabra do?
eats goats!
destroys crops!
he's a bully!
what does El Chupacabra sound like?
like a coyote!
like a ape!
like my Uncle Flaco!
what does he smell like?
like sulphur!
like garbage!
like my Uncle Flaco!
will he show up tomorrow at the Day of the Dead festivities...
or will he remain as elusive as the Loch Ness monster?
or the perfect boyfriend?
this is Daphne Blake in Veracruz reporting.
back to you, Velma.
and cut!
back to you?
Yikes! What does that mean in English?
leave today or you won't see tomorrow!
is that right, Alejo?
unfortunately, your translation is correct.
looks like someone wants us to make like a pinata and beat it.
we better get out of here now.
hold on, you two.
we came here today to get to the bottom of this Chupacabra mystery.
and no one's going to scare us away until we do.
like, Freddy, it's too late for that.
looks like they need some friendly persuasion.
would you each do it for a Scooby snack?
how about two Scooby snacks?
great! So far, it appears as if the Chupacabra is nocturnal.
now that it's getting dark, we should do a thorough search of the town.
maybe we'll get a clue to help us find the monster...
or at least the van vandals.
the girls are right.
Alejo and Luis, why don't you investigate the hills?
the girls and I will search the west part of town...
and Scooby and Shaggy can search the east.
the mystery machine is actually on the east side of town.
why don't we do a thorough search of the van...
and if everything checks out okay...
keep guard right here?
Ro-kay!
jEscucha! Listen!
just an owl. Don't be a baby.
it's just a statue.
Yes, of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent.
I've read about him.
he was revered by the Aztecs as the god of all things good.
look!
welcome.
good, you speak English.
Yes, of course. Please, come in.
are you a medicine man?
I prefer "curandero..."
but, yes, medicine man, shaman, and healer all apply.
how can I help you?
we were hoping you can tell us something about El Chupacabra.
like everyone, I have heard the stories about the big-footed beast.
but there is nothing in the ancient lore about a monster such as this.
our animal friends don't harm people for no reason.
then how do you explain the attacks?
the only evil force in this land is greed.
greed?
but what does this have to do with El Chupacabra?
recently, people from the north offered huge sums of money to build businesses here and attract tourists.
the locals turned down the offer, but when the strangers left...
I see. -You do?
the answers to all your questions can be found in the past.
and did I also mention you're in grave danger?
no, I think you skipped that part.
you're in grave danger.
we better get back to the others and warn them.
be careful, my friends.
in Mexico, things are not always as they seem.
website?
as I said, expect the unexpected.
muchas gracias para sus palabras...
Sabias de avestruz.
what did you say to him?
I just thanked him for his wise words of advice.
thanks for your wise words of ostrich?
teenagers. Go figure.
let's head back. We're getting nowhere!
okay!
Luis, come quick!
do you hear what I hear, Scoob?
like, that's not gonna help much.
we better get outta here now...
or we're gonna be an El Chupacabra fiesta plate!
none of this looks familiar. Are you sure we're going the right way?
that's Polaris, the North Star.
we should be headed in the opposite direction.
trust me. I know where I'm going.
we're sunk.
Alejo! What happened? -I was attacked by El Chupacabra.
didn't you hear me calling for help? -No.
something hit me over the head and knocked me out.
when I woke up, you were gone.
the Chupacabra is still out there...
and we've got to find the others before he does.
like, the next time we go on a trip...
remind me to pick someplace a little less exciting...
Iike maybe a librarian's convention?
Zoinks! The brakes aren't working!
Yikes! -Rikes!
look out!
hold on tight, Scoob!
like, how do we stop this thing?
okay, Fred, how do you say "hopelessly lost" in Spanish?
it looks like the woods get thicker up ahead.
do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
we might.
mostly coyotes and jaguars and boars.
coyotes? -And jaguars?
and boars. -Oh, my!
let's get out of here!
sorry, guys.
no, we're sorry.
we were hoping to find you close by, but not that close.
we thought we heard El Chupacabra. Listen.
that is nothing to be afraid of. It is just a coyote.
there are lots of them around here.
they are more afraid of you than you are of them.
then why is it headed in our direction?
maybe it is not running towards us, but away from something else.
Yeah, but what? -Like maybe that!
Jinkies! El Chupacabra!
run!
I think we lost it.
Oh, no! The Mystery Machine!
it's gone!
but its brake fluid isn't.
someone must've tampered with the brakes on the Mystery Machine.
we've got to find Shaggy and Scooby!
shaggy! -Scooby-Doo! Where are you?
Jinkies! Perfect timing!
if you and Scooby hadn't shown up when you did...
we'd be Mexican history.
Yeah, but now that we're safe from that creepy Bigfoot...
you might want to slow down a little.
I'd love to slow down, but I have some bad news for you.
what's that? -Like, I can't!
the brakes took a break!
Yikes!
but I have some good news, too. -Yes?
we're out of gas.
right in front of a gas station. What are the chances of that?
must be the good luck from my Charlene's medallion.
well, gang, all set.
here, Luis. I got you some ice for that blow to your head.
lt must be pretty swollen by now. -What happened?
I am afraid my brother was attacked by El Chupacabra...
and received quite a hit on the head.
it knocked him, how do you say, "out cold."
here, let me help. Where's the bump?
I don't see anything.
right here. I can manage. Thank you, Daphne.
where to now, guys?
the curandero said to look to the past, but what exactly does that mean?
look!
what better place than a museum to learn about the past?
perfect! And we should be able to get there by morning.
is it morning already? I could sure use more sleep.
I could sure use some of Charlene's coffee.
Reah! Roffee!
guys, look!
coming soon to Veracruz.
mister Smiley's Latin Adventure!
looks like the one we have back home.
only this one's got a Spanish accent!
if we don't solve the Chupacabra mystery, the only tourist attraction I foreseeis one big empty ghost town.
the curandero said to look to the past...
so we might as well start at the very beginning.
interesting. Half-man, half-beast.
look, guys! Like, ancient scooters!
leave it to Shaggy to come to a museum and immediately find the toys.
Jinkies! This place is creepy! -Good morning!
are we enjoying ourselves in Mexico City's national museum? Super!
and would we like a private tour of the museum...
which begins with a special live, multimedia show...
about the Aztecs? Super!
please follow the green directional arrows on the floor to the special VlP Auditorium.
please watch your step.
continue down front and be seated in the comfy chairs made of rich Corinthian leather.
okay, super!
let's turn back the hands of time, shall we?
the war-like Aztecs had many barbarous rituals.
for example, warriors sacrificed thousands of captives...
on the altars atop the pyramids...
often ripping out their still-beating hearts to offer to the gods.
super. And now I'd like a volunteer from the audience.
how about you? -Freddy?
Daphne! -She's gone!
you've been warned! Please follow the arrows to the clearly marked exit doors to your right. Super!
excellent idea! Just like what we had in mind: exiting.
right, Scoob? -Reah! Rexiting!
not so fast, you two! -We can't leave here until we find Daphne.
and her kidnappers.
where could they have gone?
why would someone want to kidnap Daphne?
look at this. It looks like some sort of ripped label...
from one of the warriors' costumes.
I wonder what that means.
let me see that.
look! A trap door!
I wonder where it leads to?
my guess is that it will take us right to Daphne and her kidnappers.
it sure looks like the perfect getaway.
speaking of getting away...
come on, guys. There's no turning back now.
great, a dark spooky tunnel.
I hate dark spooky tunnels!
look, here's a door.
we must be at the pyramids. -I've read about these.
the pyramids were created by the Olmec lndians who built Mesoamerica's first great civilization.
it's the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent...
the good god we saw a statue of at the curandero's tent.
look! At the top! It's Daphne!
where am l?
Daphne, don't move! We'll be right there!
like, if the Aztecs were so brilliant...
why didn't they invent an elevator?
reah, relevator!
boy, am I glad to see you guys!
what happened to you? -I'm not sure.
I was blindfolded the whole time by that fake museum guide and her warrior friend.
let's get out of here before they come back for you.
that's odd. This statue wasn't here before.
what's going on?
Hello, mis amigos.
I am Paco, the magical talking eagle.
I protect the pyramids here at the place of the gods.
that's the worst Spanish accent I've ever heard.
I know, he looks like a character from a tacky theme park!
these evil tourists have destroyed a sacred idol...
and angered the gods.
we did no such thing! This eagle is lying to you.
do not believe their lies.
when the cage lifts, you must run them out of here...
before they completely ruin the ruins.
if you don't, the gods will seek revenge themselves...
and you don't want to see that!
quick! In here!
there's tons of spiders down here!
spiders!
no, guys, actually these are scorpions.
gee, thanks. I feel much better now.
don't worry about the scorpions. I'm sure the rats'll take care of them.
rats!
Jinkies, we must be in the ancient tombs!
don't worry, Shaggy. Everything in here is dead.
like, how comforting!
look, we can disguise ourselves by wearing the traditional clothing of the native lndian skeletons!
just act natural.
look!
it's the vandals trying to disguise themselves by wearing the traditional clothing of the native lndian skeletons!
help!
senor Fuente! What's he doing here?
trying to attack you.
I am, amigos, mi Paco!
magical eagle!
I didn't buy this animatronic imposter for one minute.
I guess the curandero was right.
things in Mexico aren't always what they seem.
come on, we better get out of here...
before these mysterious mischief-makers try and top themselves.
Rouch!
how awful to witness something like that.
you are so strong, Dolores. Like a bull.
some people have all the luck.
why can't the Chupacabra carry off my future daughter-in-law?
what's going on? Are you all right?
Where's Charlene?
please calm down, both of you. There is nothing to be upset about.
el Chupacabra has run off with your fiancee!
we'll never see her again!
please, somebody tell us what happened.
it all started just moments after you left.
we were in the cafe, your mother, Charlene, and l.
el Chupacabra broke down the door...
picked up Charlene in his arms and ran off with her!
this is terrible. I never should have left.
Jinkies! And she's still missing?
Yes. We've been looking for her since yesterday.
the villagers are continuing the search.
here, at the cemetery, and up in the hills.
I am El Chupacabra! I am going to eat you!
all this talk of El Chupacabra is not good for the children.
now, forget all about this scary monster nonsense...
and play with your skeletons among the tombstones.
I must go join the search.
Yes, but it'll be more productive if we first get all our facts straight.
I think the village is being terrorized for a reason.
somebody wants him to scare everyone off and get us out of the way.
but what's to be gained from that?
el Chupacabra is scaring off the tourists, making businesses suffer.
if the Oteros are forced to sell...
senor Fuente gets what he wants: the Oteros' land.
good point.
but what does that have to do with El Chupacabra?
the footprints leading away from the cottage suggested El Chupacabra was scared off once Shaggy alerted the rest of us.
some monster. He was okay scaring Scoob and me...
but chickened out when there were more of us.
maybe he's a fake.
I don't think we can rule out the supernatural.
supernatural?
if the creatures at the pyramids were special effects...
they were pretty special.
and very effective!
real or fake, somebody's been following us.
Yeah, they're anticipating our every move.
but how? -Let's look at my videotape again.
wait! Freeze the frame!
look, whoever wrote "manana," the Spanish word for "tomorrow..."
forgot the tilde.
what's a tilde?
it's a symbol you put over the "n" to change the pronunciation.
without it, the word would be said incorrectly as...
Manana," instead of "man-yan-a..."
a mistake no real Spanish-speaking person would ever make.
looks like your Spanish lessons are finally paying off.
muchas gracias.
so the bad guy doesn't speak Spanish.
maybe. But there's always the possibility there's more than one bad guy.
Velma, did you save the torn label from the fake warrior's costume?
sure did, but I still don't know what it means.
sorry to interrupt, but it's time for us to pay our respects.
we're all ready to go. -Please feel free to join us.
my homemade mango salsa, your favorite.
and from Charlene, a cup of her cafe lechera.
maybe if he knows where she is, he will send us a sign.
I am the ghost of Senor Otero.
don't be alarmed.
as you all know, today is the day...
we spirits return to Earth to commune with the living.
mama, please, wake up!
I have learned that El Chupacabra is the result of an evil curse placed upon our land.
the only way to break the spell is to get rid of that land.
once the land is sold...
el Chupacabra will vanish forever...
and Charlene will be returned, unharmed.
that doesn't look or sound anything like my father!
someone is playing a trick on us!
can I see your medallion?
just as I suspected. It's a tracking device.
let's see if it works in reverse.
now, stop that now! Now, be quiet! Do you hear me? Quiet!
please! Ignore the stupid dog!
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
leave the cemetery at once!
it is cursed! The whole town is cursed!
sell the land and everything will return to normal!
can't you see? Many of them don't understand your foreign language.
speaking Spanish might help!
I don't know how to speak Spanish!
why can't everyone just learn English?
like, not so fast, senor.
it's Mister Smiley!
officers.
we suspected that "mile" and "enter" were part of bigger words...
and look, we were right! "Smiley Entertainment."
when Mister Smiley was unable to convince the locals to sell their land for his new theme park, he turned to the Otero family.
their hotel is built on some of the best real estate in Veracruz.
when they refused to sell, he wouldn't take no for an answer.
so he terrorized the tourists with the Chupacabra attacks...
hoping to ruin the Otero's hotel business and force them to sell.
and then he did everything he could to prevent us from revealing his scheme.
smiley was the perfect person to pull it off.
Why?
please. You're only encouraging him.
being the head of a theme park...
he had access to the best special effects money can buy.
like, not to mention the animatronic animals...
like our magical eagle friend, Paco.
and by kidnapping me and framing us as vandals...
he was able to derail our investigation...
and create bad publicity for the pyramids.
...soon to be his chief competitor...
for the dollars of tourists all over the world.
our deductions make perfect sense.
but if Smiley is behind the Chupacabra attacks...
then how do we explain that?
that sure doesn't look like a special effect to me!
lt is the monster! -El Chupacabra!
like, this is gonna be bad. Real bad.
you don't scare us, you big Bigfoot wannabe!
they caught the monster!
we caught something, but "monster" might be a little strong.
well! We certainly weren't expecting that.
were we?
please, leave her alone! She only did what I asked her to do.
I'm the guilty one, not her.
hardly. It takes two to tango.
I'm afraid she's right.
smiley didn't have to pull my leg to be part of his scheme.
I love him.
you see, I worked as an actress and stuntwoman at his theme park.
when I visited one day, it was love at first sight.
speaking of love, where is my fiancee, Charlene?
I'm afraid you won't be seeing her ever again.
pick up the pieces of your shattered life and find someone new.
I can't accept that! Papa, I asked for a sign, Papa.
anything to show us where Charlene might be.
please don't let your firstborn son down.
look! The gifts we left for him are gone!
the only thing that's left is the cafe lechera...
that Charlene made for him.
I don't understand. -I'm beginning to.
I was afraid of that.
I seem to recall someone mentioning coffee grinds...
coming out of their ears from working in the cafe all day.
Charlene, I thought you loved me.
would you wake up and smell the cafe lechera...
you pea-brained romantic!
I never loved you, I loved your money!
I mean, if we got married, your inheritance would become mine!
then I was fixing to drop you like a hot tamale...
and share my riches with my little honeybunch here.
but that goody-goody brother of yours had to complicate everything.
mister "l want to respect father's wishes," over there.
thank goodness you're all okay.
you mean you knew about all of this?
please, let me explain.
I admit I tried to convince you to sell your land.
but I finally accepted that you would never go against your father's wishes...
and I respected that.
but these two characters don't understand things like loyalty and family.
when I heard of their harebrained Bigfoot scheme...
I tried to track you down at the pyramids.
not to harm you, but to warn you.
I understand. Please accept my apologies.
and please accept our apologies, Luis.
I have to admit, there were times when we questioned your integrity.
we were wrong.
I can see how misunderstandings happen.
from now on, I will try to look beyond the surface to what lies beneath.
what happens now, hon?
we go to jail! What do you think happens?
we could've made billions if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!
I never trusted Senorita Charlene, that bruja.
"Bruja"?
that means, "witch."
Alejo, I have something to confess.
Yes, brother?
Hermano, when you called out for help...
I did hear you, but I was paralyzed with fear.
after losing Papa last year...
I panicked at the thought of losing my only brother.
so I lied and said the Bigfoot knocked me out.
I'm sorry for being a coward, Alejo. I pray it never happens again.
there are worse things than being a coward.
like, I've made a career out of it!
so I guess there never was a real Chupacabra.
I wonder how that myth got started. -Like all myths, I guess.
since the beginning of time, men and women have loved to tell stories.
and what better reason for creating them...
than to explain the many things we don't understand...
and maybe never will?
like how they can pack so much flavor into one piece of fruit?
at least our ancestors had the good sense to create a way to work off all those calories.
Scooby-dooby-doo!
Hey, Wolf. no, no, no, no.
it's okay. He's just paying us a little compliment.
that's all. - yeah, daddy. I hear whistles all the time.
that's the sound of wind passing through your brain.
you know what? Your dad never gets to see you guys.
could you at least pretend that you love each other?
Aw. He's in prison. He's not insane.
here is the latest from your favorite mystery writer.
and here's these magazines you said you wanted
like the news and sports and all that junk.
which one has the Victoria's Secret catalog tucked away?
those models have nothing on my girls.
you guys all look fantastic.
next time, wear coats.
especially you. Is that a new dress?
wolf, I've worn this a thousand times.
you've just never noticed.
that's because I was standing next to you when you were wearing it.
I don't like the idea of you out in this thing alone.
Oh, I wish.
she's dragging us with her to go to Alan and lexy's "I beat cancer" party.
talk about a rave.
alan and lexy's? I thought you said that you weren't going.
well, I did, but I changed my mind.
Lexy's been through a lot, and she could use a lift.
as much as I love our kids... Mm.
there are times that I need an adult to talk to.
if I stay locked up in that house, I just go...
crazy?
forget it. I'd rather see you in this than in that checkout apron anyway.
don't worry. Your checkout girl's checked out.
I cleared my name and I told my boss what he could do with his toilet paper.
there's always the store, you know.
Charlie would love to have you back.
wolf, it's not gonna happen.
now listen, I'm sorry, but this is gonna have to be a short visit.
we gotta go.
say good-bye to your daddy.
behave yourselves for your mom.
Bye, dad. - Don't drive her nuts. okay?
and, uh, send lexy and alan my love.
just don't give too much to Alan.
and on that note...
down, boy.
Hey, Cheryl. - Hi.
we were starting to forget what you look like.
Hey. yeah, it does get a tad hectic with, uh, my husband doing five in the can.
sorry. Sometimes I forget that we're not the only ones wading through crap.
but how about you two? You must be so excited
Paris, the city of love.
can you believe he's not going?
you're sending your wife to the most romantic city in the world alone?
you're an idiot, Alan.
I'm up to my ass in alligators, but I really want lexy to enjoy herself.
she's really been through hell.
excuse me. That's my German import guy.
Wow. Talk about trust.
wolf goes batty if I go to a party without him.
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
alan trusts me so much, he can't wait to send me to France.
I think i need a drink. - Okay.
must be pretty tough on your mom these days, huh?
what is?
you know, being alone, you know?
a woman's got needs, same as men.
that's just gross.
lechers anonymous.
excuse me? - Not important.
Hey. Why do you get to miss the party and I don't?
because I am doing double duty.
Stierson's got me on a fishing expedition.
meanwhile I'm trying to work on dad's appeal.
they still don't know you're a West?
Oh, they know. They just don't know I'm one of those wests.
listen, I need you to teach me fluent Cahuilla by friday.
why do you need to speak Cahuilla?
no one understands a word you lawyers say anyway.
well, we're representing them in a discrimination case.
Mr. Stierson wants me to prepare a proper welcome for the tribal representatives.
why you, o great white cracker?
okay, you remember when I told you that I got the job on the spot based on my interview?
where they told you they've never seen an applicant
as brilliant and articulate about the law before?
Yeah, I might have left out some details.
your C. V.is most impressive. Well, thank you, sir.
we'll call you if there's an opening.
okay. thanks.
Oh, my mother is gonna be disappointed.
her entire tribe was really looking forward to having somebody on the inside.
maybe next time.
excuse me. Your mother is native American?
Cahuilla, actually.
west's not your standard native American name.
I never would have guessed.
well, I don't like to play the race card.
historically speaking, it hasn't done much for our people.
so your mother's maiden name is... Red... Bear.
Redbear.
her grandfather was mauled by a red bear.
they're very rare. You don't see them around anymore.
okay, so honest abe lied his way into his law firm?
Hey, now. Who snuck you into the casino kitchen when you were 8
so you could learn gambling from the elders?
okay, fine. I'll just charge you what you bill your clients an hour.
I'm a lawyer. You have to earn your right to overbill.
whoa. What does that mean?
never cut cards with a woman named hope.
don't i know it. Later.
working on the, uh, Cahuilla tribe case?
night and day.
Oh, it must feel good, you know, doing something for your people.
Oh, it does. Thanks.
my people--they need all the help that they can get, so...
so any luck finding the smoking gun that proves the Injuns' case?
Oops. Sorry.
hope I didn't offend.
well, we Indians, we have tough skin.
man, it's a high-profile case Stierson put you in charge of.
a lot of public... ity for the firm if you win.
you know, listen, I can help you out if you're interested.
I'm not, but thank you.
I'm just saying, you know, I wouldn't want you to blow it.
I would hate to see your first case be your last.
Oh, it won't be.
but I appreciate your concern, Hugh.
Oh, hey, you know what?
um, my uncle is a district court judge,
and he just put away this white trash thief with the same name as you.
Logan? - that's funny.
"west" is a pretty common name.
not very native American, though.
well, I'm only half.
half.
I forgot.
okay. Well, you know what?
if you need any help, I am... Just down the hall.
Alan, quit following me.
it's like I'm leaving a trail of bread crumbs.
we need to talk about last night.
no.
okay, It happened. It's over. Poof. okay?
just go away so I can try to enjoy your cancer party.
so we keep this our little secret?
Yeah. We made a deal--you won't tell, I won't tell.
okay?
go find your wife.
pretend you're happily married.
Oh. Hi. - Hey.
I know how tough it's been for you lately.
and I just want you to know, if you need anything, I am here for you.
that's really good to know, Charlie.
thanks a lot.
come here. - Oh, no. Charlie, come on.
I mean it. Don't make me kick you in the nuts!
what the hell was that for?
come on, Charlie. You've had enough. Come on.
why don't you go home, sober up and sleep it off?
I'm not driving.
are you okay? - Yeah.
it's a good thing you came along before I turned charlie into a soprano.
look, I just wanted to say that...
I think what you're trying to do for the kids is--is really admirable.
Thanks. Would you tell my kids that?
because lately they're calling me "the holy mother," and they know I'm not a virgin.
I tried to get Wolf to go legit for years, but...
just don't give up. It's worth it.
none of this would have been possible if I'd have stayed in the game.
well, Wolf's not in the game now, so we're trying plan "b."
and right now, plan "b" sucks.
listen, linda, my office manager-- she moved to seattle a week ago,
and I was thinking, you've had experience running a business and paying bills.
I don't need your charity, Alan. - And i'm not offering it.
it's either hire you or put an ad in the paper.
I was paying her $950 a week, plus health insurance for the whole family.
and the job's in this country?
Cheryl, the office is in total chaos.
you'd really be saving my butt.
what are friends for?
here's to saving your butt.
and I'll have to tell my kids to get sick while I've got this job.
Logan, I want to put Hugh on this Cahuilla tribe case with you.
uh, sir, I think I've got it covered.
but you have yet to come up with any evidence that proves their civil rights were violated.
this is a landmark case that is not only lucrative for this firm,
but precedent-setting for your people as well.
I understand that, sir. I just think that
maybe we gave you more than you can handle right off the bat.
you just seem distracted. I want Hugh to help.
Yeah, I can--I can dive right in, Mr. Stierson,
good. I like your initiative, Hugh.
Oh, by the way, how is the Cahuilla tribal welcome coming?
very well, Sir. I think they're gonna be really pleased.
excellent. Can't wait to hear it.
Hey, Wolf.
man, you're looking good.
so you--you wanted to see me?
what happened to your head?
Oh, I-I hit it...on a door.
it was actually pretty funny, c -'cause I was... Well, never mind.
it's a long story. - And how was the party?
the party?
it was good, you know.- no, I-I wouldn't know.
what about cheryl? Did she have a good time?
Yeah. Yeah, she--she seemed to.
what, she--she say anything?- not yet.
I can't help feeling, though, you know, now that she's on her own,
some bastard is bound to hit on her.
Oh, yeah, bound to.
What--what kind of bastard?
an old friend, maybe.
the kind of person you wouldn't suspect.
he'd pretend to be loyal, but he'd jump her the minute your back was turned.
wolf, I was - Alan has always had a thing for her.
Oh, yeah, Alan. Right.
Nah, I see what you mean.
you know, she was talking an awful lot to him, now that you mention it.
Really? - Yeah.
and what were they talking about?
he, uh, offered her a job.
doing what?
office manager or something like that.
that son of a bitch.
maybe he just needs a new office manager.
do me a favor.
keep your eye on them, okay?
just in case.
you mean spy on Cheryl?
wolf, she's as faithful as a cocker spaniel, man.
well, Alan is a son of a bitch who's gonna start sniffing around her sooner or later,
so keep me posted, okay?
come on.
you can do this.
it's your name in Cahuilla.
what's that mean?
little big fool.
that's very funny.
well, you didn't tell me I'd be teaching remedial cahuilla.
that's going to be double.
well, don't expect too much.
if I don't find that damn smoking gun, it's not gonna matter how good my Cawilla is.
Cahuilla. - Cahuilla is.
Stierson's gonna kick my butt outta here.
I lose my job. Dad spends five years in jail.
yay, logan.
you'll find it. You're probably just looking in all the wrong places.
I have scoured every file, every internal memo.
I have subpoenaed every internal e-mail.
okay, You know those slimy C. E.O.s.
they're not about to leave a paper trail.
they probably do their dirtiest work over martini lunches a napkins
or the back of receipts or something like that.
come on. All right?
I'm charging by the hour.
rate's double past my bedtime. Okay?
okay, Okay. - So... 'E' kill 'et "Nishka," what does it say?
Oh, god.
any available salesman to the front, please.
any available salesman to the front, please.
well, well, well.
tuesday, 9:45 in the a. m.
Mr. dingus plays a little touchy-feely with little Miss looky-loo.
does this mean they're swapping spit?
drinking out of the same bottle?
making the beast with two backs?
only time will tell.
uh, it's right-- right around here.
I told you it was bad.
bad?
this is worse than Cal's room.
well... Well... They say a journey of a lifetime begins with the first step.
and this could take a lifetime.
Dan, you have a customer waiting.
you've got a customer waiting inside.
is that petty cash? - More like an advance.
you're already paying me, Alan. - Take it.
I figure things are a little tight right now.
you're a good man, Alan Markham--Messy, but good.
I'll deduct this out of my first check.
wolf really got the cream of the crop.
I hope he knows that.
are you flirting with me, Alan?
cause if you are, I can't take the job or the cash, and I need both.
just admiring an old friend. - Good.
did you have to say "old"?
Bye. Off to modeling class.
again? How many classes are you taking?
Oh. I'm in the accelerated program.
is that where they teach you to walk very, very fast?
if you weren't so beauty-disabled, I would make fun of you.
just tell me who's paying for these.
I got a scholarship.
to become a human coat hanger?
Yes, a very rich, very glamorous human coat hanger
with a closet full of clothes that you'll never be able to afford.
Hello?
how's the new job?
well, I'm making three times my old salary and I don't have to be on my feet all day,
so what could be better?
has he hit on you yet?
guess what, Wolf. Not everyone finds me as attractive as you do.
I know Alan Markham.
can't keep it in his pants, never has.
Well,"it" hasn't popped out yet.
I want you to quit.
I thought you'd be happy for me.
I am. Now find another job.
look, you're pissed because he had the balls to go straight, and it worked for him.
this is a good job, and I'm not giving it up because you're jealous of him and his success.
now call me when you're ready to be happy for me, damn it.
bitches. What can we do?
get him! Get him!
so how's daddy?
like jack nicholson in "the shining."
Wow. I'm really starting to rub off on you, aren't i?
does your sister have a boyfriend? Is that what's going on?
you want me to rat out my own flesh and blood? Wests don't do that.
you're right.
forget I asked.
which is why I can't tell you to check inside her undie drawer.
I'm gonna need two screwdrivers, a mojito and a legitimate modeling agent
to get me some modeling gigs,
like you promised me when I took this crappy job.
look, it's just gonna take some time, okay?
in the meantime, you're making decent money.
you just have to be patient.
I got agents coming in here all the time.
trust me.
don't be shy. Just let 'em know, and they'll be sure to take care of you.
you can take off if you want.
if I find anything, I'll let you know in the morning.
Oh, yeah, right, just like I'd let you know if I found something.
I'm not you, Hugh.
I'm not about to stab a colleague in the back just to advance my career.
okay, fine.
there's no smoking gun here, anyway, so it was nice knowing you, tonto.
I'm really gonna enjoy this corner office.
I've got it coming to me, even if I'm not a member of a, uh... Minority.
receipts interview non-native Americans for lower-level jobs.
substandard living conditions... Higher health risk.
modeling class, my aunt fanny.
you call taking off your clothes for a bunch of drunks a straight job?
I'm not taking my clothes off, mom. I'm just a waitress.
right. - why do I even tell you the truth?
I might as well lie. You never believe me anyway.
you're quitting that job, you hear me?
have you shown it to Stierson yet?
as soon as he gets in.
Hey, buddy, I'm, uh, going out for a double espresso. You want anything?
no, thank you, but when you get back, stop by.
there's something I want to show you.
all right. - Yeah.
that bastard.
did you learn that on the reservation?
misspent youth.
so where'd you put it?
you put it in your briefcase? You bring it home?
what are you talking about?
we're looking at $1 million-plus in legal fees,
and you think that this is some kind of pissing contest?
you really don't want to screw with me, Hugh.
boy, you know what pisses me off?
somebody who gets a corner office for playing a phony ethnicity card.
and you got yours because of what, your brilliant G. P.A?
or is it because your uncle plays golf with stierson?
well... At least my old man's not in the slammer.
now get out of my office.
Hey, it's me.
look, what are you doing tonight?
I think I have a job for you, Billy and Cruz.
it could be fun.
call me back.
that'd be, like, illegal.
mom doesn't want us doing anything illegal, remember?
mom will never know.
Yeah, right, until you tell her.
Cal, I'm not gonna tell her because then I'll be implicated.
you know, that means - No, man!
come on! - You suck, dude! All day long!
all right, look, look, look - god!
it's just between you and I, okay?
this guy deserves it, and apparently, from what he tells everybody at work,
he's got a killer sound system and a huge collection of porn.
dibs.
all I want is the briefcase. What you do with the rest...
is entirely up to you.
his briefcase.
you're such a big-shot lawyer, you can't afford your own briefcase?
you tell him. -Okay, that... Loser.
come on!
okay, that's where he put the evidence.
that's why I want you to do this thing in the first place.
and mom will never know?
never. You have my word.
all right.
all right.
okay.
I like 'em big, mommy.
daddy!
Hey.
daddy, what happened to your eye?
this?
I slipped i-in the shower.
no bath mats here. - Right.
so what's up? - Well, I got a job.
Yeah, the pay's really good, and there's a chance for real career advancement.
that's wonderful, sweetheart. - Yeah.
um, it's at the sparkle club.
that's a strip joint.
Yeah, but, daddy, I'm just waitressing. I promise.
the owner, Robby, he has connections to big modeling agencies.
one of the girls just got signed to elite, and I am ten times prettier than her.
what does your mother say? - What do you think she says?
of course she wants me to quit.
she'd rather see me flipping burgers at rusty's.
it is so unfair, dad.
well... Mm, your mother can sometimes be a little overprotective.
no, daddy, she has no faith in me, not like you do.
all right.
tell your mom I said you can keep the job so long as it's just waitressing.
now the moment you sense any funny stuff, I want you to quit, okay?
okay. I promise.
Oh, daddy, I love you so much!
thank you.
thank god mom's not a single parent.
I need your signature on this.
you want to talk about it?
Nope.
I almost got the receipts filed for April and May.
Cheryl, come on. Something's wrong. Give me your work.
sit down.
talk to me.
it's Heather.
God, Alan, she's working at the sparkle club.
she swears she's only waitressing, but - she's telling you the truth.
I saw her there. I was ordering a drink.
um, things have not been easy for me with Lexy being sick.
but heather is telling you the truth. She's being honest.
a strip club, Alan?
what am I gonna tell you?
I'm lonely. You must know how that feels with Wolf being away.
besides, I only look. I never touch.
Oh, spare me the details.
you should have told me.
I promised her I wouldn't rat her out.
now Heather thinks I'm a sleaze.
thanks for telling me.
Hey, what do you say we get out of here and get a drink... Then grab a bite?
just to commiserate, that's all.
thanks anyway, alan, but I think I should just go home and wallow alone.
let's just have dinner then.
we won't talk about Wolf or Lexy.
Thanks, Alan. I appreciate the offer, but I gotta go home.
wednesday, 5:43 p. m...
this time it's Miss looky-loo goes in for the squeeze.
is Mr. pretty face finally getting to her?
it does not look good.
just where do you think you're going? - To work.
you don't work there anymore, remember?
my house, my rules.
Oh, really?
cause daddy said it was okay with him, and I'm pretty sure it's still his house, too.
you really want your daughter to end up as a hooker?
I trust her. - Bullshit.
if you'd found out about this first, you'd be through the roof.
your princess at a strip club?
Hey, she wouldn't have to take a job like this
if she wasn't getting pressured by certain people with pretensions.
you blame me?
you're the one in jail.
Oh, you noticed. thank you.
Oh, and by the way, thanks for asking how I'm feeling since I got the crap beat out of me.
or didn't you notice?
how are you feeling?
better, thank you.
I miss you, though.
I don't see you enough.
well, I've been busy, Wolf. I have something called a job.
and you have to show up if you want to get paid.
and showing up is all that Alan expects?
alan is a good man who's paying me more than I ever made selling your stolen merchandise.
alan is a sleazebag who only offered you the job so that he could get into your pants.
or has he done that already?
what the hell's the matter with you?
I have been faithful to you for more than 20 years.
and if you can't understand that, then you've got your head stuck up your ass,
and as far as I'm concerned, you can keep it there.
aren't you gonna invite me in?
I thought you couldn't make it.
I changed my mind.
I could use a little commiserating.
Lexy called. she's off to dinner with a bunch of new yorkers she met at the louvre.
that woman could make friends anywhere.
Yes, she can.
Oh, thank you.
I-I just saw wolf.
yeah? How's he doing?
pissing me off, as usual.
did you ever think about leaving him?
Oh, I've had my moments, but what marriage hasn't?
me and Lexy, too.
in fact, we were splitting up last year.
then she got the big "c," and I couldn't go through with it.
and now that she's getting better?
Oh, it's over. I think we both know that.
I'm sorry, Alan.
no.
everyone deserves to be happy, even you.
don't, alan.
I... I can't.
why not?
because no matter how pissed off at Wolf I am,
I can't prove him right by cheating with you.
at this point, it's hard to think of it as cheating.
I think I should go.
you could stay.
spend the night.
no one would ever know.
you know, I-I know you think you mean well, Alan, but you don't.
and besides, I'd know.
Hey.
listen, I'm--I'm sorry I accused you of ripping me off.
I'd like to make it up to you, try to, you know, - bring you out for a drink, try to... - bury the hatchet.
I'm apologizing.
Yeah, sure, kemo sabe. why not?
Hey, but you know what?
don't blame me if you can't hold your fire water.
the one, the only two-- miss candy cane.
Hey, hey. so one more?
it's on me. huh?
Oh, no. I gotta go home. - Hugh, come on.
no, no, no, no, no.
I-- Hugh, listen to me. listen to me. come on.
one more smoke of the peace pipe, all the scenery in front of you?
yeah? Sm-- right?
just one. - I knew you would.
one.
Hey, sweetheart.
what do you need? - Two more mojitos.
they said they want actual alcohol in it this time.
Yeah, really funny. - Heather?
what are you doing here?
um, it's called working, this thing us Wests are supposed to be doing now.
does mom know that you're here?
does mom know you're here?
I'm here having a drink with a colleague.
and I'm serving drinks, period.
so, yes, Mom knows. yes, Dad knows.
you don't have to act like either one of them right now.
listen, i'm just looking out for you, okay?
as long as my baby sister's not giving lap dances.
don't be gross.
well... I'm only working here until Robby over there gets me discovered.
what, do you guys think you're the only big shots coming up in here?
trust me, we got all kinds.
we can always tell a lawyer by a lousy tip.
well... Be careful.
here you go, sir. - Thank you.
come on, Cal. pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hey-o. this is cal.
well, it's not really me, because-- ipod. sweet.
jackpot!
Hey, baby. How you doin'?
yo, jackpot, dudes.
homemade porn, dude. - No, man.
dude, Cruz, the guy's coming home soon.
so what, man? We gotta check it out at least.
it might be girl-on-girl, bro.
there you go.
what's she gonna do with that?
um, maybe she's gonna play ping-pong.
that's gotta hurt.
I guess he likes it.
I guess he really likes it.
Oh, man! Come on!
let's go man. Let's go, dude. Come on, man.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, wait. What are we forgetting?
we already raided the fridge, bro. - Yeah.
briefcase? - The briefcase.
briefcase.
all right. Come on, man.
I am gonna buy you... A lap dance.
no, no, no, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
no, you are not fine. - I'm fine. I'm fine, Jugh.
no, you are not fine. You are not fine. - Let me tell you what.
I'm going to give... The dying man his last meal.
Hey, sweetie? Sweetie? Honey?
well, hello.
what time you getting off, huh?
unless, you know, you wanna get off now.
well, I think right now would be just... Perfect.
well, thank you. I really got off on that.
well... I'll say this much for him-- he may be a lawyer, but he's an excellent tipper.
thank you, sir.
well done, sis.
thanks for coming, detective.
always a pleasure to see you.
well, it's always a pleasure to see you, too, as long as you're right here where you belong.
five minutes, please. - all right.
so you said you had some information for me concerning ongoing criminal activity?
I'm just curious as to why you would tell me anything.
I mean, isn't it against the west code to rat people out?
I want to get outta here.
as luxurious as the accommodations are, detective, I'm a bit of a fussy sleeper.
I tend to prefer my own bed and the woman I share it with.
and I figure, cooperating with you will look good for my appeal.
okay.
what do you got?
don't worry.
she may not have much in the brain department,
but what is there is coated with a nearly bionic predilection for survival
that would knock the socks off a cockroach.
it's not her survival I'm worried about.
it's her future.
and why was Logan the only one who understood the difference?
yeah... I've been meaning to ask him,
but he's just so busy trying to find a phone booth to change in.
don't be too hard on Heather.
Hey, it's not like she tries to make bad decisions.
she just doesn't know what the good ones are.
watch it. she's locked and loaded.
here.
what's this for?
room and board.
stuff, you know.
you don't have to do this.
well, I figured since I'm making a little money now, I should at least contribute.
I'm sorry I haven't trusted you more to take care of yourself.
you are a West, after all.
I made a lot of mistakes in my life,
and I don't want you to repeat them.
you worked in a strip club?
no.
but if the opportunity had presented itself, I might have.
how was work?
it was good. It was good.
the--the tips were really good.
good. - Yeah. good.
I'm glad. - Yeah. Yeah.
honey, do you think... Could you wear something that was a little more... More?
uh, no. no, i can't.
okay. - Can't. Nope.
son of a bitch!
morning.
is that all you have to say to me after leading me on like that last night?
Alan, I did not lead you on.
you left me in a high state of arousal, and you know it.
I'm sure you took the matter well in hand.
it's not the same thing.
listen, cheryl, I'm crazy about you.
I always have been and I always will be.
Alan, it's very flattering, but it's never gonna happen,
so be a good boy and stop touching me.
what the hell is this about?
I have a warrant to search these premises.
are you kidding me? What are you doing here?
I'm just conducting a criminal investigation.
what else would I be doing here?
working awfully close to the boss, aren't we, cheryl?
we believe that you have a very strong case, as our senior partner, John Stierson,
will explain in greater detail once we're all inside.
if you'll follow me.
well done, Logan. Very impressive. - Thank you, sir.
brilliant work on the smoking gun, by the way.
Oh, I appreciate that, sir. - Sorry I'm late. I... Sorry.
well, you should be.
look at you.
go home. sleep it off.
Mr. west no longer needs you.
and don't think i am not gonna call your uncle.
putz.
well, you know how to party.
I' say that much for you.
somebody... Uh, robbed my apartment last night.
well, I hope that you didn't lose anything important.
you are one of those wests, aren't you?
Aw, hugh, I don't know what you're talking about.
but... We should go out again sometime.
we could play some ping-pong.
I hear you have your own paddles.
are we ready, sir? - Yes, we are. Please.
so you just started working here on monday, huh?
that's what I just told you.
well, then I guess you're not implicated.
in what?
apparently, Mr. markham's connected to an organized gang of international car thieves.
his inventory of high-end stolen imports is actually very impressive.
that's not true.
well, cheryl, someone seems to think it is.
someone... Very close to you.
it is hot!
Oh, baby!
some of that!
complete with the pumps!
that is hot!
all right. That's enough.
settle down. Settle down. - Oh, I'll be your daddy!
reminds me of your mama!
what the hell are you doing dressed like that?
what? I always dress like this now.
what, with my man in prison and everything, I gotta put the goods back out on display.
all right, cheryl. You made your point. You win.
now you listen to me, Wolf, or I'm gonna start talking very loudly about
how you ratted out Alan Markham.
and that should make life in here a bit more interesting for you, don't you think?
Yeah, I coulda slept with Alan, but I didn't.
and do you know why?
because you're the first man that I ever fell in love with,
and you'll probably be the last,
and that means everything to me.
but after this, I don't know if you are that man.
well... I did what I had to do.
you betrayed yourself.
and you had no faith in me.
you ruined a man's life-- a friend
because you didn't trust me.
I don't think I'm gonna wanna see you for a while, Wolf.
well, I'll be right here when you do.
you were right about Roxy. She is amazing.
she's totally rocking the mic out there.
look at us. We are the "Charlie's angels" of hot undies.
Hey, I get to be Jaclyn Smith.
who needs class when you got sass?
ladies, make your man's night in the rev it up bustier, available in medium, large and full bloom!
What?! Badonkadonk!
Cheryl's in the kitchen taking orders, so get those checkbooks ready.
you know you want to. What?!
Ooh, honey, you know, you need to order that in amethyst.
with your eyes and that hair?
Ooh, honey. Who needs more daiquiris?
right here.
Oh, ladies. Give it up for jenny!
so you've got the va va voom merry widow in peacock and red fishnet thigh-highs.
excellent choice.
I'm gonna need that by Friday. - I can do a rush.
now would you like to have this delivered to the home address or the workplace?
definitely home.
I'm with a bunch of girls from the station.
you bring this stuff by, we'll never live it down.
uh, any relation to sergeant Mack?
only by marriage. He's my ex. Yep.
I've heard plenty about you.
so this is the infamous West nest?
well...
don't believe everything you've heard.
I'll have this to you by Friday.
please do. I've got a weekend.
make the most of what you got.
even if what you got is a whole lot!
it's okay. Just breathe.
Oh, my gosh. There's, so much fat and, like, cellulite and thongs everywhere, and everyone's so happy about it.
honey, you would have been gorgeous up there, but we needed some ladies our customers could relate to.
mom, trust me. I do not want to be in your fat girl underwear, okay?
I mean, I don't want them all in my living room either.
don't worry. It won't get on you, at least not yet.
mom, don't say stuff like that. - Good one.
I have my first modeling job tomorrow night.
this is really freaking me out.
it's actually the music I have a problem with.
well, get used to it because business is blooming.
seriously, a pun? - Hey, be happy for me, okay?
it's something I can be successful at for once.
they, like, parade around in their underwear in our living room, only most of 'em are mom's age and a lot of 'em are fat.
if I were in hell, this is how they would torture me.
I don't know. It sounds kinda good to me.
no, no, no.
I'm telling you, man, the hens are taking over.
we gotta get you outta here.
well, it's not gonna happen anytime soon.
what are you talking about? You'll win that appeal.
not if nobody's working on it.
well, Logan's working on it.
not anymore. He said it's, uh,"detrimental" to his "career."
what? - Something about the judge's nephew working at his firm.
Oh, that is such crap.
I knew we shouldn't have let him work on your case.
I told mom we shouldn't...
it is what it is.
well, we'll just get somebody else.
all right? We'll get JJ. Back on it.
with what, Cheryl's panties for baggy butts?
the only thing you guys got right now is the house, and there is no way in hell you're selling that, so we sit and we wait and see what happens.
all right, don't worry, dad. Listen to me.
we're gonna get you outta here. - Yeah.
I promise.
Yeah. I could go for some kung pao.
actually, you know what? Um...
I think I've got something here I could nibble on.
something just came up I have to revisit.
you, too.
excuse me.
I think you know my brother, Cal West?
look at that. There are two of you.
Yeah, I'm his...I'm his brother Logan.
I heard you were here to meet with Stierson today.
I wanted to introduce myself.
Cal speaks so highly of you.
I like to make an impression.
well, that you do.
you look different.
I'm heading out for a swim.
anyway, um, I know you just had a meeting with Mr. Stierson, but if there's anything that I can do for you personally
there is, actually.
you can apologize.
I'm sorry. For what?
and here I thought I made an impression.
believe me, I was impressed.
listen, I know it wasn't right.
but you have to admit, at least you ended up with the better brother.
I didn't "end up" with anyone, did i?
POKER，hey, watch the chopsticks, Honolulu.
what? What is so funny?
you got some crack you wanna make about ponzu sauce?
cause trust me, I've heard it.
you're pretty cranky for a mermaid.
you wanna try laying up here in this fishtail?
I guess you are kinda out of your element.
let me get you a drink.
I can't. I got like an hour till the octopus shows up.
wait a minute. Are you detective rick hardy?
I'm Grant Wily.
my dad loves your show, man.
he almost bought that jacket you wear because you look so badass in it.
it wasn't because of my methodical crime solving?
Yeah. No, it was that, too.
you know, that, um, that special you did about castles in Ireland?
me and my mom loved that.
I always wanted to be a fairy.
and look at you now.
Yeah. I'm really launching my career here with these shiny oven mitts on my boobs.
Hey, you know, I'm pitching a new reality show with my producing partner...
what's hot in palm springs?
and we're looking for a co-host.
I'd like to talk to you about it.
why don't you come find me when that octopus shows up?
I bet I could knock off early.
and so one day...
his brother comes to the circus to visit him and says, "frank, have I got a job for you.
you're gonna get to wear a suit and a tie.
you're gonna have a nice desk and a beautiful corner office."
and Fred looks at him.
and Fred, of course, is covered in elephant crap.
and he says,"what?"
and give up show business?
believe me, I've shoveled my share of crap in my day.
no, you've gotten to do so much cool stuff, man, like clog dancing off a cliff in Ireland and chasing all those bad guys on that cool motorcycle.
don't forget the number one pop song in Scandinavia.
true.
man, all those things that I want just seem, like, a million miles away.
Yeah, believe it or not,
I feel like that, too.
trying to reinvent myself now doesn't feel that different from when I was first starting out, like you.
Hey, do you really think that I could...
be your co-host? Like, me?
Hey, if a skinny kid from Lagrange can grow up to be rick hardy...
you just gotta want it.
well, thanks for all the advice and encouragement.
you make it all seem so possible.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, Hollywood can be a really cynical place.
don't let 'em take your innocence or your desire.
that's what makes you special.
I bet you say that to all the mermaids.
grant, right here! - Damn. It's the paparazzi. Hang on.
who's the girl?
that was quite a ride, detective hardy.
Yeah. Sorry. I really can't show up in the tabloids right now.
you think we might?
Hey, I-I hate to do this, but could I call a cab to get you home?
I really don't want you seen by those vultures.
right. - Yeah.
they're such a pain.
Hey, um, I should give you my number so you can call me about the reality show.
Yeah. Right. Definitely.
acme cab. - Oh, hey. Yeah, I need a cab, please.
girl, I'm just glad nobody threw up on the merchandise, okay?
maybe a little less vodka in the daiquiris next time.
hell, no. That's a major sales tool, baby.
Hey, there you are. I've called you, like, eight times.
sorry. My phone died.
Hey, I got doughnuts.
come to mama! - Yes! All right!
so where's the fabric?
Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I think, uh, Mr. Singh got, uh, backed up.
you know, he's gonna need an extra day to-to get it.
I don't understand. He's got an entire warehouse full of fabric.
did you give him the money? - Yeah, like, a deposit, you know, and he...
sorry. I guess your phone's not totally dead.
Hey, baby.
no, sure, take whatever you want. There's-there's more in the freezer.
okay. See you later.
it's terry.
Oh, you're kidding me! - No! You didn't take him back!
he sold your flat screen.
I know, but he's paying me back.
he's got this whole plan to make money.
girl, he always has a plan to make money, and it usually ends up with him in jail.
well, this time sounds real good.
you know, he's got all these people together to invest.
Oh, no.
did you give him our money?
what? No. no.
don't lie to me, Kasey... - no!
because I can call Mr. Singh right now.
it's just for a day.
Oh, Kasey!
no, he's gonna give us back double. He promised.
he promised.
Oh, well, great.
damn.
Hey, Terry. - What's up, Cheryl?
heard they put wolf on ice, huh?
Yeah.
kasey gave you some money?
maybe.
well, it wasn't hers, and I want it back.
Yeah. Just be cool, all right?
24 hours, you'll get it back, plus interest.
well, I don't want interest, Terry.
I want my money, and I want it now.
and I'm telling you, that's not gonna happen.
all right? So just sit tight.
you know, maybe go get your nails done.
you know that thing that you think is charm, Terry? - Yeah.
well, it doesn't work with me.
that was my money. Mine.
look, even if I wanted to get it back, it's too late.
you know what? If I had half a brain, I'd rat you out so fast, you'd be back in jail by lunchtime!
yeah?
well, that wouldn't sit too good with your business partner, would it?
what business? Thanks to you, Terry, the whole thing probably went up in smoke.
now why can't you weasels just ruin your own lives?
why do you have to take us down with you?
maybe that's 'cause, uh---Shut up.
it was a rhetorical question.
idiot.
so thou refuse to drink the dodgemy dear son's blood.
dude, you ready to see me totally making out with grant wilby in "indiscreet" magazine?
just when Shakespeare was getting good.
why are you even reading that? School's out.
the plots are awesome for our screenplay.
I mean, Titus Androgenic actually feeds tamora her sons in a pie.
and then there's all these eyeballs getting cut out and...
look! My butt!
Congratulations. You're a mystery mermaid.
wait. Where's my name?
"Racy blonde. " "sexy siren. " Who writes this crap?
damn it! No one's even gonna know it's me.
what the hell is your tattoo doing on top of Grant Wilby?
Oh, see, mom knew it was you.
doesn't count.
damn right, it counts.
do you have any idea what's gonna happen when your father sees these?
well, he's not gonna see it 'cause he's in jail.
Ooh, a silver lining.
what are you doing, heather?
you've got one modeling job, and you end up on the cover of a tabloid with some tv actor.
it's called launching a career, mom.
he's married.
that didn't come up.
it's too easy.
okay, look, I don't know what this guy told you, but you're not allowed to see him ever again, do you hear me?
now please put away these groceries.
and I'm gonna burn these in the backyard.
and that one, too.
don't worry. You're still young.
you have a whole life of scandal ahead of you.
man, Dropped his own dad's case?
lawyers are cold-blooded.
Yeah. All right, so are you in or what?
hang on. Hang on. Check out this new ringtone.
dude, Cruz, come on, man.
all right, all right. Sorry, man. What's the plan?
all right, so about three, four times a week,
I pick up Mr. Hong's lunch from this taqueria that he likes, right?
and I started noticing this creepy white dude...
who runs a comic book store just right nearby.
every Wednesday, he takes his weekly cash drop, puts it in the trunk of his car, then treats himself to the baja combo platter, extra salsa.
S--sorry, man.
Mr. Hong likes tacos?
is that even, like, legal? - Dude.
focus, man. Focus. - Okay.
I'm not talking about the tacos.
I'm talking about all that cash just sitting in the trunk of that car for, like, 30 minutes, man, while he's chowing down.
right. What kind of car?
that's the good news.
it's old, like David Lee Roth/Van Halen-old, man.
golden age, bro.
so no alarm, plus, he parks around the side where there's no video cameras.
dude, you actually thought this through.
I mean, it's for my dad, man, you know?
it's like a late father's day gift.
so you take your half.
I'll put my half towards my dad's appeal.
we'll be cruising down to baja in no time.
Hey, you guys!
Hey, Tanya.
I saw you at the salon again. Somebody's been stalking me.
Oh, go ahead and play it off.
pretend you just like those tacos you're getting practically every day.
Tanya, we're late! - Then go without me, Tito! I'm busy!
if you don't mind, could you just - We're in between something.
sorry. Am I interrupting a meeting of the minds here?
no, no. We're good.
so Wednesday, noon. All right, bro?
what's Wednesday? The day I finally get my hands on those awesome cuticles?
I know this is the last thing you're gonna wanna hear, but one of our suppliers fell through, so it's gonna mean a slight delay on delivery.
you said Friday.
I know, but I was thinking that maybe if you and some of the other lady cops wanted to get together and throw us the rest of the money...
we paid our deposit.
you know, what is this, some west family con job?
Oh, come on. Do you think I'd really be stupid enough to try and con a bunch of policewomen out of their panties?
look, all I know is I'm going to desert hot springs, and I'm bringing that lingerie that I paid for or you and your family are gonna start hearing sirens in your sleep.
God, you really were married to sergeant Mack, weren't you?
uh, Cheryl.
Oh, great. Now you.
um, I didn't realize that you knew Barbara.
I don't. We're just, um, working on something together.
Oh, okay. Well, um, I mean, whatever it is, uh,
I would hate for it to, you know, I mean...
she has, you know, her own perspective on things, on me, in particular, and, uh
are you worried, detective, that your wife is gonna say unflattering things about you to me?
no, not at all.
I mean, not really. Did she?
she doesn't need to. I can do that all by myself.
no, really, I'm just selling her some clothes. That's all.
Oh, right, this is the, uh, underwear business.
how do you know about that?
well, I mean, when you applied for the license...
you're on a watch list.
well, there you go.
I'm just selling your wife some slutty panties.
ex-wife.
a- and that's funny,'cause I-I never thought that was Barbara's thing.
well, maybe it just wasn't your thing.
I'm sorry.
anyhow, uh, just remember, whatever she says, uh, you know, it takes two to tango.
gotcha. - All right.
look who it is.
I was just talking to Mr. Stierson about you.
only in the, uh...
most glowing terms, I hope.
quite. Apparently, he's quite proud of the new diversity in his firm.
I had no idea your family was Cahuilla.
uh, we're half Cahuilla, actually.
that's funny. Cal never mentioned that.
listen...
I wanted to apologize to you about the sex.
it won't happen again, unless, of course, you want it to.
that's your idea of a sincere apology? - Well, I.
Uh-oh. A sincere apology in a law firm?
I must be on the wrong floor.
Valerie, hi.
I was just finishing up with Ms. Hong.
Patty Hong, this is Valerie Bottoms...
hello.
my girlfriend.
nice to meet you, Valerie.
Patty was just --Ms. Hong was just here on, uh, business with Mr. Stierson.
Oh, I hope it's nothing serious.
estate planning. - Identity theft.
uh, and identity theft.
my goodness. Someone stole your identity?
no. No, someone else's.
you can't trust anyone these days.
I'll say.
uh, if you need five minutes...
no. No, we're finished. He's all yours.
clients, right?
Yes, Mr. Singh.
uh, yeah, I understand that, but if we could just get half the material, then we could
Yeah, it's just that.
no. I understand.
Thanks. Thanks for nothing.
what about some kind of emergency short-term loan?
Oh, sure, we'll tell them all our money for our crotchless panties went to a drug deal.
I'm sure the banks would love to invest in us.
Terry said he'd have the money back by tomorrow.
Terry said and you believe that?
he's just gonna say that again tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that.
he said it was a sure thing.
a sure thing? Kase, this was all of our money.
and you didn't even come and talk to us before you gave it away to that loser.
okay, okay, ladies. Ladies, let's just cool it down.
no. I'm sorry, but this is really bad.
if you wanna self-destruct, fine, but don't take all of us down with you.
I said I was sorry.
but couldn't you have thought this through for once in your life?
I mean, this was my last shot.
this was something that I could actually do that made sense, the one thing that I was counting on, and you just
I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
just forget about it. Forget the whole thing.
Oh, man.
I guess I'll have to, won't I?
wolf, all I do is think about this family.
what do you think this business was for?
when half the guys in here are gawking at pictures of our daughter's ass in a magazine, it doesn't exactly look like you're paying attention.
it's not as if she asked for my permission.
I'm as pissed as you are.
well, if I was home, none of this crap would be happening, that's for damn sure.
Oh, yeah, right.
when you came home, she was getting a prison guard drunk and showing off naked pictures of herself.
things definitely shaped right up!
look, you tried, okay, but this idea about taking the high road, Cheryl...
it ain't working, babe.
well, you know, thanks for the support, Wolf, especially when I really need it.
do you mind if I hide out here for a while?
mom's yelling at dad. I think he found out.
Oh, about the dirty underwear business? I thought he'd love that.
no, about my thing --the photos.
Yes, the telltale tattoo.
Ooh, that's a good title.
fine, use it for some stupid movie that no one's ever gonna see.
that'll make me feel really nice.
I mean, he wanted me to co-host this reality show, and I texted him, like, 50 times.
he's not responding. I don't get it.
Heather, I'm the virgin here.
do you really need me to explain it to you?
this sucks.
I mean, off he goes in his midlife-crisis-mobile with his unfamous wife, and I get nothing
no reality show, not even my name in the tabloids.
well, maybe you should have it tattooed on your butt.
okay, so you got played by rick hardy. Who cares?
I do. Okay? I care.
I could practically smell the ocean from the balcony of my Malibu condo, and now I'm stuck here...
modeling mom's fat chick underwear.
you know, it wouldn't be too difficult to turn this to your advantage.
Really? How?
it's called media manipulation...
where fair is foul and foul is fair.
just trust me.
okay, there he is.
Ooh, nice chinos.
all right, he's headed for the car.
okay. In goes the bags.
good. Good.
okay.
all right.
we have 40 minutes for the baja combo platter.
and...
why are you making a-a sign? I'm-I'm right here.
50 bucks if you can tell me which famous movie dude had a ride just like this.
I don't know, man. Ask my sister.
"live and let die," bro. James bond.
okay. go.
dude, you said there wasn't an alarm!
who puts an alarm on a crappy car like this?
come on. Get the stuff, man.
no, there's more. There's more.
Grab-grab the jumper cables.
I'm not gonna take jumper cables. That's bad juju.
Just-no, leave it. Cruz! - No, man. They can trace it.
well, look who it is.
I knew it. I saw your car out front, and I said to Gina, "nobody likes tacos that much."
I know he's finally ready to let me give him that mani-pedi.
what are you doing? - Nothing. We're just looking at this car.
it's the same one as James bond.
you didn't come to see me.
you came to jack something out of this car.
no. What? No. - Uh, cops.
where is it? Is it in the backpack? - No.
give it to me. - No.
give me the backpack. - No. Dude, no.
I'll hide it... In one of the lockers in the salon.
you come with me.
you get in the car and meet us in front of the salon. Move.
Bye, Gina! See you tomorrow!
drive slow.
Hey, Cher.
what are you doing outside? Wanna come on in?
I know where the money is.
well, hallelujah for small miracles. Where?
okay, so you know how terry likes a little light bondage?
okay, so I tie him up, and I tell him, "you tell me who you gave the money to or I'll take this candle
cut to the chase.
he gave it to Luther Wallace.
Leslie Wallace's son?
that kid who used to shoot off the M-80s?
Yeah. Guess he grew up.
well, where can we find him?
you know, that I don't know.
you know, I think I'm probably gonna, you know...
I'll call you later. - Okay.
Oh, great. More bad news.
afternoon, Cheryl.
I'm afraid I have a search warrant.
what is it this time? You come to confiscate your wife's panties?
uh, no, actually, um, there was a robbery about an hour ago, over at Guerrero mall.
security cameras picked up a vehicle identified as lac's in the parking lot.
how do you know it was Cal?
I don't. But he has priors, so, uh, I gotta check it out.
and I was just starting to miss our little visits.
Oh, yes.
people don't know this about me, but I'm actually a healer.
I can just tell where's there's a problem, and I get in there and work it out.
that's pretty cool.
how do you do that?
any other problems I can work out for you, Cal?
yo, dude, dude. Company. Dude.
Tanya Cruz, look who's stopped by to say hi.
sorry to interrupt, but, uh, we got word of a theft over at Guerrero mall today, and, as it turns out, surveillance cameras picked up your car in the area at the time of the robbery.
that's weird,'cause, I mean, we were...
I'm sorry, officer...
detective Mack.
and, uh, I don't think this concerns you, miss...
Tanya Leterre, and I work at the guerrero mall at the french silk nail salon, and Cal and Cruz stopped by a little bit ago to pick me up, so...
a little bit "ago"?
and, uh, how long were you there?
45, 20, 30... 30. - 20, 30, 45.
I take a while to get ready.
but you could check with gina, the store manager. She saw him there.
um, she saw me-me, too.
Yeah, he was driving my car 'cause I was...
I was picking up my girl.
Mack.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I'm leaving now.
all right, then. Well, there we have it.
french silk nail salon.
French.
you still need to look around?
no. No, I think I'm okay.
but, uh, I'll hang on to this just in case.
see ya.
Bye.
I have a question for you.
you heard her. We were just...
right now, I don't even wanna know about this.
I wanna know where I can find Luther Wallace.
what, the kid with the M-80s?
Yeah, he doesn't, uh, deal with M-80s anymore, you know?
what do you know about him?
it's nothing. He's just into drugs.
you know, we-we don't deal with him.
are you doing a drug deal?
no, I'm not doing a drug deal.
now you wanna answer questions about your afternoon or you want to get on the phone and help me find Luther Wallace?
you know, if you want, I can give you a really good foot massage.
no. Hey, ma, I'm gonna- I'm gonna make some- make some calls, okay?
thank you, Cal.
okay, wait a second. I'm gonna have to think about this as an assignment from Tyra.
okay. I'm ready.
when I met Grant Wilby...
I was lying on display in a mermaid costume, - feeling very alone in a crowd of wealthy people. - Good.
grant wilby was the only one who actually spoke to me, so like my modeling, it began with communication.
can we get some shots with the mermaid tail?
uh, Mia? There's a reason we came to you and not celebwhore.
your blog is about women finding their authentic journey and claiming their true power.
Heather, what are you doing? Put your top back on.
gosh.
this is about romance.
rielle Hunter, but with class.
no, I gotcha. Go on.
by the end of the night, grant could see I was no mermaid, and I knew he was no rick hardy.
we were just two people finding each other in an empty sea.
Ooh, you're good. - I know.
too bad I'm not cynical enough to do this full-time.
and then say some stuff about how hurt she was when she found out grant was married, and even though she would never want to hurt his wife, her feelings will never change because "love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.
pretty. Is that Rihanna?
what the hell do you?
be... Quiet. All right?
what are you doing here?
I came to get something that belongs to me.
okay, you're gonna have to be a little bit more specific than that.
my business partner gave our money to her boyfriend, and it ended up with Luther Wallace.
I was going to go and get it.
Yeah, keep laughing. That's your wife's money in there.
ex-wife.
well, what are you doing here?
at the moment, I'm saving you from getting killed in a drug bust.
what?
Yeah, there's 20 cops around this house right now.
we've been setting this up for over a year, and you almost walked smack-dab in the middle of it.
20 cops? - Yeah.
for little Luther?
Wow. He has grown up.
sergeant Mack, what's your status?
Yeah, I had to make an interception.
you need backup? - No, we're good.
is it really necessary for you to lay on top of me?
Yes. - why?
because I don't know what you're gonna pull.
I haven't figured you out yet.
I'm not that hard to figure out.
yeah?
well, you're a lot more complicated than you seem.
we're in position and ready to move in.
Yeah. Copy that. We're good to go.
all right, we're gonna go now.
stay down.
okay. - Good.
Oh, wait. Try not to shoot Luther.
his mom and I were den mothers.
okay.
I have two minutes.
if you're going to attempt another apology,
I suggest you start with your girlfriend.
I'm not gonna apologize 'cause I'm not sorry.
ever since we spent that night together,
I can't think of anything else.
then you came into the firm, and I thought a lot of things, but "sorry" wasn't one of them.
I appreciate you being so direct.
are we finished?
what else am I supposed to say?
follow me.
turn around.
so does he look like you remember?
he was such a good webelo.
I'm guessing he never made it to eagle scout.
his mother must be sick.
well, in my experience, the mothers are always the last to know, and even then, they don't believe it.
let me get a new shot. - Oh, yeah. Sure.
I'm goin' inside.
the evidence count.
I'll put it in the report. - All right.
I guess that means I'm not getting my money back.
what exactly was your plan here, anyway?
just gonna knock on the door and ask nicely?
something like that, only I wasn't gonna be so nice.
you are something else, Cheryl West, I'll give you that.
well, do me a favor.
tell your wife that she's not gonna get her slutty panties because of your drug bust.
ex-wife.
and I'm pretty sure she'd prefer I not know anything about this, you know, seeing how it wasn't my kinda thing?
I'm sorry about that. That was out of line.
no, no. You were right. You know how it is.
you get together when you're young.
you think you'll always be that person you were when you met.
then one day... You're not.
um, well...
uh, I... I better...
thanks for saving my life and, you know, whatever.
just finishing the report.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna need a recount. - The whole thing?
afraid so. We're getting two different numbers on the cash.
who knows what else we missed, right?
sorry about that.
Hey, mom, you got any of those, uh, silk corset thingies left?
I thought you hated these things.
on old, fat ladies, yeah, but on me, my boobs look great.
who wants to see the triumph of heather west over the sexist media?
is that a good thing? - What are you talking about?
meet the "home wrecker"?
it's postmodern irony, mom. Keep reading.
Oh, my gosh. I'm so gonna get work out of this. Nice!
for admitting to outdoor sex with an aging tv star.
no, for getting photoshopped. Look at that.
think what you may, but after my long conversation with grant...
we discovered the rarest of things in life, a true connection.
you said that?
Heather was more in charge of the visuals.
I was in charge of the content.
it's so awesome having an evil genius as a sister.
well, I prefer to think of it as "skilled media negotiator."
totally legal, I might add.
well, let's just hope it had the intended effect, whatever that might be.
Oh, if that's Kasey, tell her I'm in the shower.
this is so awesome. I'm gonna be so famous. I'll get it.
Heather. I saw the interview.
I had no idea.
well, about that...
and that thing you said at the end,"sonnet 116"?
let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment.
that's my favorite.
uh, well, I guess it's too bad that you're married and everything.
actually, it was my wife who saw the interview.
she was actually the one who forwarded it to me.
anyway, we're separating.
look, I'm staying at the hidden palms.
so we can be together now.
I was still reading that. - I know, and it only gets better.
listen, I feel terrible.
Oh, imagine that.
what do you want me to say?
what do you think you should say?
that I appreciate everything you did for me, and it's hard when people grow apart.
Oh, is that what happened?
Valerie, when we met, I was still a kid.
Yes, and you've turned into a lying cheater. I'm so proud.
couldn't you at least say you're sorry?
I'm sorry. I really am.
thank you. Apology accepted.
and I will also accept...
payment in full for all the hours I tutored you to get you into law school and pass the bar.
as for the student loans, there's no rush on that, but I will be charging you 7% interest.
1% for every year you took from me.
Logan lent us the money.
so that's us at the post office sending out our last shipment.
we worked all night, but we made our deadline.
and Roxy says that we'll make enough money, next time we can hire someone to help with the sewing, because I may be a lot of things, but I ain't no seamstress.
aren't you gonna say anything?
hopefully it'll last longer than your last three jobs.
you know, it would be really nice if you could just have a little bit of faith in me.
you don't think I have reason to have my doubts, Cheryl?
no, I'll tell you what I think.
I think the hardest thing for you besides watching me fail is watching me succeed.
you can't stand it. It's the same with Logan.
anytime that we wanna spread our wings, you just have to shoot us down.
let me tell you something about your glorious son, okay?
Oh, come on. - He ditched his old man.
Yeah, that's right. Dropped my case. Left me to rot in here.
so forgive me if it's kinda hard for me to have a little faith.
evening, Cheryl.
should I ask if you have a warrant?
no.
I was just, uh, dropping by to return something of yours.
what's this?
that is the item that you tried to reclaim yesterday.
and... Just how exactly did I reclaim this?
well, it doesn't really matter. You just did.
okay. why?
Why? - Yeah.
well, because, uh, that's what cops do, right?
we help honest, hardworking people who shouldn't be getting screwed.
did you just call me "honest," detective Mack?
I think I did.
well, good luck with the business.
what's it called?
full bloom.
full bloom.
now that's something to shoot for.
I am the Spirit of Christmas Present.
now look upon me.
you have never seen the like of me before.
never?
yet how many of my brothers have you rejected in your miserable lifetime?
I have never met any of your brothers, sir.
you have never looked for them.
well, how many of them are there?
what year is this?
eighteen hundred and sixty!
then I have eighteen hundred and fifty-nine brothers.
each year at this time, one of us visits this puny little planet to spread some happiness, and to remove as many as we can of the causes of human misery, which is why I have come to see you,
ebenezer Scrooge.
you're a funny-looking little creature.
I must admit,
I found it hard to believe you'd be as horrible as my brothers said you'd be, but now that I look at you,
I can see they were understating the truth.
let me assure you that I am a man of the highest principles and the most generous spirit.
generous spirit, you?
you don't know the meaning of the phrase, but you're about to find out.
now... drink this.
what is it?
taste it.
Mmm! Mmm...
do you like it?
it's wonderful.
I've never tasted anything like it.
of course you haven't.
what is it?
the milk of human kindness.
there are more good things in this life, Scrooge, than you can possibly imagine.
I'm sure there are.
can I have some more?
ebenezer Scrooge
the sins of man are huge.
a never-ending symphony of villainy and infamy duplicity, deceit, and subterfuge.
and no one's worse
than Ebenezer Scrooge
though man's a handy candidate for hell
I must admit
life sometimes has
its brighter side
as well
I like life
life likes me
life and I fairly fully agree
life is fine
life is good
especially mine, which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life, here and now
life and I made a mutual vow
till I die, life and l
we'll both try to be better somehow
and if life were a woman, she would be my wife
Why?
Why?
because I like life.
that's all very well for you, but not for me.
I hate life.
nonsense, man.
Why?
because life hates me, that's why.
Scrooge, you're an even bigger fool than I took you for.
I've never heard such a lot of self-pitying drivel.
you don't even know how to live.
now, you listen me.
I like life...
well, go on.
I like life...
that's better.
life likes me
like likes me...
good, good.
I make life a perpetual spree...
perpetual spree
eating food
drinking wine
thinking who'd like the privilege to dine me
I like drinking the drink I'm drinking...
that's better, Scrooge!
I like thinking the thoughts I'm thinking
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music, and I'm in a trance
tra, la, la
oompah-pah
chances are we shall get up and prance...
look at me!
where there's music and laughter
happiness is rife...
Why?
Why?
because I like life.
where there's music and laughter
happiness is rife
Why?
because I like life
see how much we
like life!
what happened? What's happened?
what the devil am I doing in a pile of snow in the middle of the night?
that's what I'd like to know.
where are we?
now, Scrooge, over there lies the lavish home of Robert Cratchit, Esquire, who owes both the opulence of his surroundings and the magnificence of his Christmas celebrations to the high principles and generous spirit of his employer.
I want to look in the window.
it will cost you nothing, which I'm sure will be good news for you.
will they be able to see me?
no, which I feel sure will be good news for them.
I could do with another of them drinks.
later.
for the time being, I think it better you see things as they really are.
Oh, nectar. Pure nectar!
and at only tuppence a pint, you can't really grumble.
what a tragedy it is that Her Majesty and His Worship the Lord Mayor couldn't be with us tonight.
they don't know what they're missing.
now you try that, my love.
Mmm.
Bob Cratchit, you're a genius.
the stuffing's ready, Father.
the marriage of roast goose and sage and onion stuffing a la Cratchit is one of the culinary miracles of our day.
and a living legend throughout the length and breadth of Camden Town.
now the only remaining problem, my dear, is whether to put the stuffing inside the goose or the goose inside the stuffing.
but since the ultimate intention is to put them both inside ourselves,
I don't suppose it very much matters.
and here they are, the one and only carol-singing Cratchits, newly returned from their triumphant musical tour.
how did you do, Tiny Tim?
ten pence, ha'penny.
Ooh.
well done.
another fantastic coup by young Timothy Cratchit, the financial wizard, at only seven years of age.
the youngest millionaire in the vast Cratchit empire.
ladies and gentlemen, if I may steal a moment of your valuable time,
I would ask you to drink a toast to the sparkling good health of the two gentlemen whose industry and generosity have provided our sumptuous Christmas repast.
master Timothy Cratchit...
tim and Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
what are you trying to do, ruin our Christmas?
but his money paid for the goose, my dear.
no, your money paid for the goose, my dear.
but he paid me the money.
because you earned it, my love.
fifteen shillings a week at threepence an hour, and not a penny rise in eight years.
believe me, you earned it.
Oh, Mr. Scrooge assures me that times are hard.
he's right, for you they are, but not for himself.
nonetheless, he is the founder of our feast and we shall drink to him.
quite right.
you, listen to this.
the founder of our feast, indeed.
I wish I had him here.
I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon.
he'd have indigestion for a month.
Ethel, my dear, the children.
it's Christmas!
it needs to be Christmas, Bob, to drink to a rotten, hard, stingy old miser like Scrooge.
but Ethel...
you know he is, Bob.
nobody knows it better than you, my poor love.
to Christmas, my dear.
children, we shall drink to your father, for all the love and happiness he gives us.
and to Tiny Tim, for the health we wish him.
and for the sake of your father
I'll even drink to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.
long life to him and to us all.
a Merry Christmas to us all!
merry Christmas!
God bless us.
God bless us, every one.
as I said to the Lord Mayor, if Her Most Gracious Majesty is feeling bored, I said, you wheel her over to Camden Town, I said.
a glass of Bob Cratchit's hot punch and a song from Tiny Tim, and we'll have her back on her regal feet in no time.
well, there's your punch.
now where's our song, my Tiny Tim?
tiny Tim! Come on, son.
come on, Tim.
on a beautiful day that I dream about
in a world I would love to see
is a beautiful place where the sun comes out
and it shines in the sky for me
on this beautiful winter's morning
if my wish could come true somehow
then the beautiful day that I dream about
would be here
and now
on this beautiful winter's morning
if my wish could come true somehow
then the beautiful day that I dream about
would be here
and now.
good boy.
well done, Tiny Tim.
well done.
what an unpleasant child.
you know, Scrooge, there are few things more nauseating to see than a happy family enjoying themselves at Christmas.
do you not agree?
I think Bob Cratchit's really rather fond of me.
and so's his wife, couldn't you tell?
she doesn't really know me.
that is one of the few things wherein fate has blessed her.
and, uh, what will become of Tiny Tim?
what's this?
concern over a sick child?
have you taken leave of your senses?
don't mock me, Spirit.
is the child very sick not that it's of any great importance to me whether he is or not-- but is he?
well, of course, he's sick.
you mean he's seriously ill?
will he live?
well, will he?!
what does it matter to you,
ebenezer Scrooge?
if he's going to die, then he'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
we have one more call to make.
ladies and gentlemen.
will you please honor me with your undivided attention.
the time has come that I know you all look forward to in this house every Christmas Eve, when I ask you to drink to the good health and long life of my celebrated Uncle Ebenezer.
sounds to me as if he knows I'm here.
of course he doesn't!
he can't see you!
Harry, I've visited you every Christmas for the past five years, and to this day
I can never understand this extraordinary ritual of toasting the health of your old Uncle Ebenezer.
I mean, everybody knows he's the most miserable old skinflint that ever walked God's earth.
who's he?
Oh, just a friend.
my dear Tom, it's very simple.
he is indeed the most despicable old miser.
worse than you could ever possibly imagine.
you find this amusing?
believe it or not, he likes you.
you see, I look at it this way:
if I can wish a Merry Christmas to him who is beyond dispute the most obnoxious and parsimonious of all living creatures
hear, hear!
then I know in my heart that I am truly a man of goodwill.
the scoundrel...
wait! There's more to come.
and besides, I like old Scrooge.
what did I tell you?
truly, I do.
I can't help feeling that hidden somewhere deep inside that loathsome old carcass of his there's a different man fighting to get out.
careful, Harry, it may be even worse than the one you know.
Oh, God forbid, Tom.
anyway, that's the reason I ask him to come here every Christmas in the forlorn hope that, one day, he might pick up enough goodwill to raise his clerk's wages by five shillings a week.
God knows it's high time he did!
he's free with other people's money.
all right, Harry, that's enough.
I refuse to have Christmas haunted by Uncle Ebenezer.
we'll have some dancing and some music.
then we'll play some splendid party games.
there's a charming new game called "The Minister's Cat."
it's very funny.
you'll all end up getting very angry when you lose.
as for you, nephew, if you were in my will,
I'd disinherit you!
Scrooge!
come over here.
you need some more of this.
huh! Raise my clerk's wages!
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
ladies, center!
Yes! I know that tune!
I used to sing it when I was a lad.
the minister's cat is a lonely cat.
the minister's cat is a languid cat.
the minister's cat is a lordly cat.
the minister's cat is a lazy cat.
the minister's cat is a ludicrous cat.
the minister's cat is a lascivious cat.
the minister's cat is a...
too late, you're out!
Oh, no!
he's out! He's out!
you see, they get furious when they lose.
it's lovely.
he's out! Next "M."
come on. "M," "M," "M.
now "M.
the minister's cat is a marvelous cat.
the minister's cat is a marmalade cat.
marmalade?
the minister's cat is a miserable cat.
miserable.
the minister's cat is a merciful cat.
merciful!
the minister's cat is a... --Merry.
uh... --Say merry.
Oh, damn it!
I told you to say merry.
why are you so stupid?
he's always been stupid.
and stop yawning when I'm talking to you!
what next?
the minister's cat is a... naughty cat.
quickly, quickly!
the minister's cat is a noble cat.
noble.
the minister's cat is a nebulous cat.
nebulous.
the minister's cat is a n...
nasty cat. Oh, bother.
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not out because I was just about to say, "nice."
you fool, it's too late.
you could've said, "neglectful," "nervous," "nauseating."
you're out, you're out, you're out!
the minister's cat is an orange cat.
the minister's cat is an old cat.
Yes!
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas, darling.
I wouldn't have missed it!
good night, good night.
Yes, thank you, thank...
Oh, thank you, my boy.
what a wonderful evening!
that minister's cat game, splendid!
I thought I was rather good at it.
good night, good night. Thank you.
I can honestly say
I haven't enjoyed a Christmas as much as this since I was a young apprentice at old Fezziwig's.
Oh, so many years ago.
Yes.
what Christmases we used to have in those days.
fantastic, they were.
he had...this daughter reminded me...a little bit of your mother, she did.
her name was lsabel.
Oh...
Oh, lsabel.
they say happiness
is the folly of fools
pity poor you
one of the fools...
happiness...
was standing beside me.
I could see her
she could see me
happiness
is whatever
you want it...
to be...
Yes, Scrooge.
I have brought you home.
you're not going?
my time upon this little planet is very brief.
I must leave you now.
but we still have so much to talk about, haven't we?
there is never enough time to do or say all the things that we would wish.
the thing is to try to do as much as you can in the time that you have.
Yes, but
remember, Scrooge!
time is short.
and suddenly, you're not there anymore.
no, wait!
don't go!
don't leave me!
where are you?
wait, it's too dark!
I can't see! I can't see!
I can't see! I can't see!
I can't...
Oh, my God, what am I doing here?
I'm in bed, that's what I'm doing here.
this is where I'm supposed to be in the middle of the night.
was I dreaming again? I must've been.
that giant!
I must be mad!
there are no giants!
there are no ghosts!
am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?
and you want to show me shadows of the things that will happen in the time before.
is that so, Spirit?
ghost of the future, I fear you more than any apparition I have seen.
but as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to be another man from what I was,
I am prepared to bear you company.
will you speak to me?
the night is waning fast, and I know that time is precious to me.
lead on, Spirit, lead on!
there you are, me friends.
shining as bright as the ugly thoughts the mere mention of the name "Scrooge" brings to our minds.
ladies and gentlemen.
we are gathered here today because we are united by a common bond.
namely, our feelings of gratitude to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
I don't think any of us could ever hope to find the words to describe the true depth of our feeling towards him.
is this the future?
all right, my friends, all right.
that's Tom Jenkins, the hot soup man.
he owes me six pounds.
I must say, he looks uncommonly happy for someone so deep in debt.
all these people owe me money.
they love me and I never knew!
kindly hold down your emotions, if you please.
now we are all deeply moved.
and those of us what has been in debt to Mr. S over all these years will never forget what a rare and beautiful thing he has just done for us all, right?
then three cheers for Mr. Scrooge!
hip, hip
Hooray!
what did I do? What did I do?
whatever it was, it has made you truly happy, and I am the cause!
my friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I shall remember this moment until my dying day.
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
and so say all of us
may I say, in all humility
I have labored unceasingly all my life to be worthy of this moving demonstration of your feelings towards me.
ladies and gentlemen.
on behalf of all the people who have assembled here,
I would merely like to mention, if I may.
you may!
that our unanimous attitude is one of lasting gratitude
for what our friend has done for us today
and therefore, I would simply like to say
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double dutch
but my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war's
been won for me
and if I had a flag, I'd hang me flag out
to add a sort of final victory touch
but since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me
it sounds a bit bizarre
but things the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me
and if I had a cannon I would fire it
to add a sort of celebration touch
but since I left me cannon at home
I'll simply have to say
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very, very, very much
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
and so say all of us
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me
it isn't every day
good fortune comes me way
I never thought the future would be fun for me --And if l --Hey!
you woke my baby!
will you keep quiet?
beg your pardon, lady.
and if I had a bugle I would blow it
Shh!
to add a sort
of how's your father touch
but since I left me bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very, very, very much
no, no, dear friends!
it is I who should thank you!
thank you very much -Thank you very much -Thank you very much -Thank you very much -That's the nicest thing -Very, very much
that anyone's ever done for me
thank you very much
the future looks all right
thank you very much
in fact, it looks so bright
thank you very much
I feel as if they're polishing --The sun for me --Thank you very much
and if I had a drum, I'd have to bang it
to add a sort of Humpty-Dumpty touch
but since I left me drummer at home
I'll simply have to say
thank you very, very, very...
the color hurts my eyes.
I musn't show weak eyes to your father when he gets home.
it must be near his time.
past it.
but I think he's walked a little slower these last few evenings.
I've known him walk with Tiny Tim on his shoulder very fast, indeed.
but he was light to carry for it was no trouble. No trouble.
where is Tiny Tim?
take me to him.
on this beautiful winter's morning
if my wish could come true
somehow
then the beautiful day that I dream about
would be here
and now...
I must go now, my little fellow.
I promised your mother
I'd help her with the Christmas dinner.
I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
same time.
all right?
Oh, Tim...
poor Tiny Tim.
spirit, you've shown me a Christmas-yet-to-come that mingles great happiness with great sadness.
but what is to become of me?
no, no!
please, I beg you!
I've seen the error of my ways!
I will repent!
truly, I will repent!
Ah...
so there you are.
Marley!
where am l?
I should've thought it was obvious.
I heard you were coming down today, so I thought I'd come to greet you, show you to your quarters.
nobody else wanted to.
Th-th-th... th-th...
that-that's very civil of you, Marley.
I-l-l...
I am dead, aren't l?
as a coffin nail.
I... I...
I'd rather hoped I'd end up in heaven.
did you, indeed?
you may find your office here rather small, but not, I trust, unfamiliar.
office?
your activities in life were so pleasing to Lucifer, that he has appointed you to be his personal clerk, a singular honor.
you will be to him, so to speak, what Bob Cratchit was to you.
that's not fair!
it's... it's...
diabolical.
I must confess,
I find it not altogether unamusing.
here we are, my dear Ebenezer.
your office.
It-it's...
freezing cold in here.
Lucifer turned the heat off.
he thought it might make you drowsy.
you'll be the only man in hell who's chilly.
watch out for the rats.
they nibble things.
Rats?!
Oh...
I almost forgot.
I knew there was something.
they apologize that your chain wasn't ready for your arrival.
it's so big, they had to take on extra devils at the foundry to finish it.
it's even bigger than I thought it would be.
Oh.
here it is now.
don't let them do this to me, Marley.
I beg you!
that's quite a chain, isn't it?
help me. Help me!
bah, humbug!
merry Christmas.
don't leave me, Marley!
help!
help! Help!
help! Help! Help!
help! Help! Help! Help...
help!
where am l?
I'm in my own room.
I'm not in hell at all.
I haven't got any chains.
perhaps it didn't happen after all.
perhaps it did.
but I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I've got a chance to change, and I will not be the man I was.
I'll begin again.
I will build my life.
I will live to know that I fulfilled my life.
I'll begin today.
throw away the past.
and the future I build will be something that will last.
I will take the time...
I have left to live...
and I will give it all that I have left to give.
I will live my days
for my fellow men
and I live in praise of that moment when
I was able
to begin
again!
I will start anew
I will make amends
and I'll make quite certain
that this story ends
on a note of hope
on a strong amen
and I thank the world
and remember when
I was able to begin...
again!
I don't know what to do.
it's a miracle.
I'm as light as a feather!
I... I... I...
I'm as happy as an angel!
Yay!
I... I'm as giddy as a drunken man.
a merry Christmas, everybody!
Oh.
Oh, Jacob Marley, wherever you are, you shall see a change in me, Jacob, I swear it.
Whee!
boy! Boy! Boy! What day is it?
today? --Today.
why, Christmas Day, of course.
it's Christmas Day!
I haven't missed it.
the spirits have done it all in one night.
well, they could do what they like, you see?
of course they can.
of course they can.
Hello, my fine young fellow.
hello.
do you know the butchers in the next street but one?
I should hope so.
what a remarkable boy! An intelligent boy.
do you happen to know if they've sold the prized turkey that was hanging up in the window?
not the big one, the enormous one.
what, you mean the one as big as me?
what a wonderful boy!
so witty! It's a pleasure to talk to him.
Yes, that's the one.
it's still there.
it is? Go and buy it.
what's that?
here's two sovereigns.
go and wake up the butcher and tell him to open his shop.
meet me there in ten minutes.
be holding that turkey, and I'll give you a half a crown.
go on, run.
run, run!
run! Run!
Oh, what a lovely boy.
I think I'm going to like children.
now that's what I call a turkey.
it's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
come on, dear boy.
let's go and open the toy shop.
thank you. Merry Christmas.
and I'll have that...
huh?
and-and some of those...
and the hobby horse...
and then some flutes and-and some... trum... trumpets...
and-and that doll...
and some bows and arrows.
bows and arrows.
Yes, and... --Yes.
Oh, yes, and l... I must have a cricket bat.
and-and these.
and these.
and the horse and the spinning top.
and... the piano.
and-and all those dolls.
all of them? --Yes.
Oh, and l... I like that.
Oh, and this beautiful coach.
and several kites and the horse.
Yes. Whiskers.
and these boats.
Yes.
and some of these.
Oh.
boy.
I'll have that.
Oh.
now, how much is all this?
Oh, uh... oh...
well, never mind.
here are some sovereigns, and you can keep the change.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
and I shall require the services of several small boys to help to transport these delightful objects to their destination.
and each boy shall receive a half a crown.
half a crown. Yes, Mr. Scrooge.
M-Mr. Scrooge...
what has happened?
well, what's happened, it's perfectly simple, Pringle.
I've discovered that I like life.
I like life
life likes me
life and I fairly fully agree
life is fine, life is good
especially mine, which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life, here and now
life and I made a mutual vow
till I die, life and l
we'll both try to be better somehow
and if life were a woman
she would be my wife...
Why?
because I like life!
Ooh, look, a slide!
no, let me! Let me! Let me!
no, no! Look! Look!
Oh...!
Oh! Whew!
I like life
life likes me
I've made life the perpetual spree!
eating food, drinking wine
thinking who'll have the privilege to dine with me
I like living the life of pleasure
pausing only to take my leisure
Whoa! Oh!
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music, and I'm in a trance
tra, la, la, oompah-pah
chances are I shall get up and prance
where there's music and laughter, happiness is rife
Why?
Why? Because I like life!
uncle Ebenezer!
Oh, Merry Christmas to you, my dear nephew, and to your enchanting wife.
we were just on our way to your house with some presents.
these are for you, from an old fool who deeply regrets the Christmases gone by that he might have shared with you.
and, and...
this is for you, my dear.
a sort of belated wedding present.
Oh, Uncle Ebenezer, thank you.
Christmas lunch is sharp at 3: 00.
may we expect you?
you may.
I'll be there.
Oh, you are a pretty girl.
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music, and I'm in a trance
tra, la, la
Oh, ha, ha
chances are, I shall get up and prance
where there's music and laughter, happiness is rife...
Why? Because I like life!
father Christmas
Hooray!
father Christmas
he's the greatest man in the whole wide world
in the whole wide world and he knows it
every Christmas
father Christmas
puts a great big sack on his dear old back 'Cause he loves us all and he knows it

but that's all right!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
ln the morning -ln the morning -Christmas morning -Christmas morning
if you lift your eyes, there's a big surprise
on your bed, you'll see, it's a gift from Father Christmas
from Father Christmas
that's how Christmas ought to be.
Hey!
merry Christmas!
a Merry Christmas to you, sir, from Father Christmas himself.
Oh, dear.
don't worry about your goose, Mrs. Cratchit.
you can use it as stuffing for this.
now, where are the other presents?
this dolly is for you, my dear.
and this one is for you, and this pretty little dolly is for you.
it's the dolly in the corner!
and those are for you, my boy.
thank you.
and-and these, Bob Cratchit, are for you and your good lady.
I must leave you now, as you can imagine, it's a very busy day for me, and I have many more calls to make.
I almost forgot.
this...Is for you.
you didn't steal it, did you?
no, I didn't steal it.
it's a present for you to keep.
a Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim.
you still don't recognize me, do you, Bob Cratchit?
Yes! Uh... no.
you-you're Father Christmas?
no.
Aah! It's Mr. Scrooge! He's gone mad!
it's all right, my dear.
there's nothing to be frightened of.
no, I haven't gone mad, and on Monday, when your salary will be doubled...
doubled? He has gone mad.
...We'll sit together and discuss how I could help your family.
to start with,
we'll find the right doctors to get Tiny Tim well.
and we will get him well, you know, Bob?
Yes. I believe you.
I'll believe anything!
and may this be the merriest Christmas of all our lives!
Tom Jenkins, Tom Jenkins!
about that six pounds you owe me...
you agreed to give me a few more days, Mr. Scrooge.
I just need a few...
you can keep it.
it's my Christmas present to you.
God bless you this Christmas Day, Mr. Scrooge.
thank you very much.
thank you very much, that's the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me
it sounds a bit bizarre
but things, the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me
and that goes for anyone else who owes me money!
you can keep it.
as of this day, all my debts are ended!
and if I had a drum I'd have to bang it
to add a sort of Humpty-Dumpty touch
but since I left me drummer at home
I'll simply have to say
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me
it isn't every day
good fortune comes my way
I never thought the future would be fun for me
and if I had a bugle, I would blow it
to add a sort of how's your father touch
but since I left me bugle at home
I'll simply have to say...
Ah, gentlemen! Merry Christmas!
merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge!
come to my office on Monday morning, and I will give you 100 guineas for your most worthy cause, and the same every Christmas.
thank you very, very much, Mr. Scrooge.
...very much
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me
the future looks all right
in fact, it looks so bright
I feel as if they're polishing the sun for me...
sing a Christmas carol --Sing a Christmas carol
sing a Christmas carol
sing a Christmas carol
sing a Christmas carol
sing a Christmas carol
like the children do
sing a Christmas carol...
and if I had a cannon I would fire it
to add a sort of celebration touch...
and enjoy the beauty, all the joy and beauty
that a merry Christmas
can bring to you!
and since I left my cannon at home
I'll simply have to say...
...Gladness and cheer, Christmas is here...
thank you very, very, very much
Hey! Hey!
thank you very much, thank you very much
that's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double dutch
but my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war's --Come along, boys! --Been won for me
and if I had a flag, I'd hang me flag out
to add a sort of final victory touch
but since I left me flag at home
since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say --Thank you very much --Thank you very much --Thank you very much --Thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you very, very much
thank you very, very, very much
thank you very, very
very much!
merry Christmas!
merry Christmas!
Hello!
I don't know whether you can hear me, old Jacob Marley, and I don't know whether or not I imagined the things I saw, but between the pair of us, we... we finally made a Merry Christmas, didn't we?
I have to leave you now.
must go and get ready.
I'm going to have Christmas dinner with my family.
and enjoy the beauty
all the joy and beauty
that a Merry Christmas
can bring to you!

9. 5. - [Chuckles]
excuse me.
[Woman] Charlie?
Charlie. Charlie! Oh, my God. Charlie.
somebody! Help! Charlie. Charlie. Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi. I just want to let you know what's goin'on.
I hate you. [Chuckles]
I saw you on the news. I got your message. I know you want me to kill you.
excuse me. - Um, yeah. Sorry.
so all of these are from last week? - That's about half of them.
[Typing] - And then there are the verbal threats.
[Man] He's a dead man. I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
he's ruinin'this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
they sound worse in English. - Yeah.
we got this guy yesterday. Did you translate this?
no. But whoever did's not a native speaker. - How do you know that?
well, he translated here- [Reading Spanish]
and that literally means " to put pressure on him, he bit the guy.
as if he was being tortured. But that's not what it means here.
it's slang. It means he bribed him.
he didn't bite him.
[Chuckles] Good.
we need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
you picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
button up your jacket. - Why? What goin' on?
[Man Over Radio] Dispatch, this is Charlie 9. Units on scene.
here comes the Secret Service. - I really don't need them breathin' down my neck.
what do they know about investigatin' murder?
she can breathe down my neck.
but not him.
agents Breckinridge, Marin. Secret Service.
you guys bring lunch? - Not today.
the way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
as the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
bad guy shoots him first.
you think this is a street crime? - In my gut, yeah.
you know my problem with gut feelings?
once you have them, the only evidence you see is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
human nature. - There's no money left in his wallet...
and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
you have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger...
to notice anything outside of the ordinary...
so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario. - [Speaking Spanish]
anyone want anything to eat or drink?
uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine. - Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner. I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
you sure? You've been on as long as me.
you gonna make me change my mind? - [Chuckles]
detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.
it's cedar, which is a soft wood. It gets brittle with age.
so what are you sayin'? - Bad guy used a silencer. That's why nobody heard it.
and that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet...
and stopped it from penetrating the wood...
which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
the shooter was standing right here.
one other thing, Detective.
excuse me. Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
we assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
if he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions...to avoid accidental shootings.
our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
if he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
Aprotective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
when we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon. I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
if this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
let's get a gurney up here!
it always amazes me how thorough you are.
well, we try to do the best job we can.
hopefully you sleep better at night.
and I definitely do. - Garrison, DiPaola. We're good on the perimeter.
I'm 10-60. - Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can get something to eat.
Hi. - Hi.
you all right?
I missed you. I missed you so much.
just a second. - Okay.
this is outstanding. - There you go. And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
[Radio Beeps] - Garrison, DiPaola. Where are you?
garrison, DiPaola, where are you? - Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi. So what the hell is going on, or
aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
he- He was murdered?
P. I.D. Thinks it might be connected to work.
director put us on alert.
I'm sorry. I know he was your friend.
was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
was he agitated or worried about anything?
he was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
did he tell you why? - He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
What'd he say at breakfast? - Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you...
but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
he told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
just gossip. It just- - Yeah.
probably not even true.
look, that's all we need for now.
you got the lead on Charlie's murder? - Screw you.
what? - Screw you.
you still got a problem with me? - Take your hands off of me.
Christ. It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me...
but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
if you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
otherwise, stay out of my way. - Fine. You're a piece of work.
you know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work. You have any idea what that might be?
no. - Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo. - Do that.
Hey. Is everything okay? - Hey, Jill. Yeah.
you workin' with him now? - Yeah.
keep your eyes open. You may learn a lot.
but don't listen to everything he's got to say.
especially about me. - Okay.
Pete.
there some problem between you two?
I thought you were friends. - We were.
so what happened? - It's personal.
let's go.
no. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him. - Just tell him it wasn't me.
it wasn't anybody. - I'm not saying it was.
I wasn't having an affair! - Cindy, I know you weren't.
what do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times? This is why I left him.
he's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
you still love him, don't you?
Hey, Pete. Pete. - Hey, Tom.
you know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
okay. Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore...
offered to transfer the call to W. F.O. P. I.D.
he said you're the only person he'd talk to. - Thanks.
there he is! Publishers Clearing House, my man! You got somethin'for me?
[Laughs] Did you fill yours out yet?
every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out. I never do.
long time, no see, Walter. What's up?
let's walk.
you got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
that agent who was killed outside his house on Monday? - Yeah.
maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
what was that something? - A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
not if you got somebody inside.
you saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
that's right.
there's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president? - That's right.
well, what's his name? - I don't know. I just know he exists.
well, how? Who-Who's giving you the information?
I want one million dollars. - What are you smoking, Walter?
now be serious. - I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
they'll hunt me down. - We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day. Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
you get me the money, and I will disappear. - I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
here. Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...
they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
and where's the president right now?
press conference at his house. Twenty minutes.
this morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve to take on the infrastructure of terrorism...
wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
how reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
against who? - Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
sir. That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
[Ballentine] Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
now let me point out, this is very important
polygraph everyone on that list...
and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this...
so let's fold that investigation in as well.
and we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing. - He's the best we've got?
Yeah. - Pete. He's kind of a protege of yours. What do you think?
he'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him. - Then he's the guy.
you can have anybody you want.
from I. D. from the field. You get carte blanche.
not right now. - Oh, sorry.
I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie. - No, I'm gonna keep her.
she hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
[Man] I will blow you up. I come to bomb this country.
[Indistinct] Holy wars.
we have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
you think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
probably. The threat alone interferes with the process.
we pulled 50 agents in from the field.
people who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
they'll integrate with both of your teams.
we're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat...
the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
as far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
is that clear? - Mr. President...
we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
what do you think would happen to the power of the president if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
it took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency...
and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right? - Fine.
good, let's do that. How do we proceed?
bill, you're the guy.
you're the last line of defense.
you can protect him better than any of us can.
is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah. - [Coins Jingling]
this.
[Ballentine] And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
you can bank on it. Thank you very much. Good night.
good night. Thank you.
heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
this way, Mr. President. - Thank you, Bill.
classic is moving to bravo cars.
[Woman Over Radio] Copy that. Command to alpha cars. You are off the hook.
sir, could you put down that knife?
it's not what they wanted to hear. It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
he's an old C. I. Of Garrison's. Nine, 10 years.
garrison? - Mm-hmm.
what's wrong?
it's nothing.
are you sure? - Yes. It's okay.
how do I find Xavier? - Um, I don't know where he lives.
he's a fanatic about not being followed. - You ever tried?
what? - Have you ever tried?
he wants a million bucks from us, Dave. I'm sure he'll contact us.
you better be right.
you get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
could be any one of them. It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
what percentage of your people have had a polygraph? - A little over half.
over half"? The president's life is at stake.
heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5: 00 p. m. This afternoon...
or don't show up for work tomorrow.
were you born in Morocco? - No.
do you live in Bethesda? - No.
[Woman] Were you born in Alabama? - No.
[Man] Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
uh, yes. I was involved with an investigation with the bureau
just yes or no answers, please. - Okay, Stan. Yes.
are you up? The witch hunt is on.
get your polygraph today.
how did they get these?
night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
it's gotta be someone inside the Service.
somebody could have picked it up. They're good. That's what they do.
who?
the same agent plotting to killJohn? Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
now, all of a sudden, there's two? I don't buy that.
somehow they're connected.
maybe this is the assassination?
this is a death sentence forJohn, a political death sentence.
that's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
just relax. - I'm relaxed.
were you divorced in 1998? - No.
have you received adequate training for your profession? - No.
but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
no.
have you done anything in the past 30 days to violate Secret Service protocol? - No.
are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
[All] No.
I could use a few of those.
Thanks. - You look exhausted, Bill.
you look worse. - [Chuckles]
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
well, I'm back on. It's worse than going to confession.
have you done your polygraph yet?
you know I can't even let you back on duty unless- - Yeah, I'll go now.
[Woman] Is your name Peter Garrison? - Yes.
are you involved in a plot to kill the president? - No.

I was having a cup of coffee. - Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop. Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times. You never returned any of his messages.
and that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
they moved the flight up two hours. I was in the coffee shop.
it was noisy. I couldn't hear my cell phone.
let's roll!
Hey! I'm coming!
huh?!
Yes!
are you and I going fast? - Hey!
Hello? - Walter?
yes? - I have some bad news.
it's about your two uncles, son.
Walter?
Walter? Walter?
good news...
you're spending the summer with your two uncles.
it's just gonna be for a few weeks. A month or two, tops.
Scout's honor, okay?
cross my heart and hope to die, okay?
where are you going this time?
the Fort Worth College of Court Reporting.
I met a guy last night.
he's gonna pull some strings.
Walter, you're gonna have to learn to trust people, or you're gonna grow up bitter and disappointed.
you're gonna have fun with your two uncles. You'll see.
mom, you're an only child.
I know what uncles are.
well, Mr. Smarty Pants,
it just so happens, they really are your uncles.
your great-uncles.
my mother's brothers.
they disappeared 40 years ago and just showed up back here in Texas.
can't I come with you? - No!
honey, I'm gonna be working my tail off learning court reporting.
I'm doing everything I can to keep this family together.
how about a little help here, okay?
now, look... they say these two old men got millions stashed away in cash.
nobody knows where they got it.
got no kids, no one to leave all that money to.
you and me, we're as close as any family they got.
you want them to like me so they'll die and leave us their money?
we could buy a house, maybe settle down.
Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, look! Here it is.
here it is, honey. Here it is.
by the way,
I hear these two were in some state nuthouse for 40 years.
got all their money from a big lawsuit or something.
but then there's lots of stories about them.
who knows what to believe?
just find out where they stashed all that money, okay?
maybe we should've called first.
no. Older people just love surprises!
here we are.
okay.
go away, go away!
Hey, go away! Shoo!
show 'em you're friendly, honey. Let them smell your hand.
they must be down there by that lake.
let's go! Come on!
there he is!
winged him. - He's running for it.
Damn! Empty. - Get ammo. I'll keep him covered.
Yoo-hoo!
huh?
Yoo-hoo!
you send for a hooker?
uncle Hub, Uncle Garth, it's me, Mae!
Mae!
Pearl's daughter.
and I brought Walter, your nephew.
relatives. - Damn! God.
we're old, damn it. Leave us alone!
the last thing we need is some little sissy boy hanging around all summer.
Walter, honey, why don't you wait out here and play, okay? I'll be a minute.
he could help out around here, do chores.
help out? Your kid's a damn wienie.
I know. That's why he needs to be around real men, like you two. It won't be for long.
he's got to cook for his damn self. I'm not cooking.
nice doggie. Come play.
this is for your own good, Walter.
you know...
I bet all that money is hidden real close by.
imagine, a real buried treasure just like in those books you're always reading.
Walter, maybe if you'd learn to smile once in a while, then people might like you.
now, come on, how about a big smile to remember you by?
okay? Come on!
you're gonna have to work on that smile while I'm gone, okay?
Bye, honey! Bye!
well?
if my mom calls, can we hear the telephone out here?
don't have one.
no telephone?!
is it okay if I go inside and watch television?
ain't got one.
no television?!
what do you do?
Hey!
rumor has is you two have millions stashed away.
why not put some of that money to work for you with the high yield only investing in gold and silver can bring?
can I leave you some pamphlets?
gentlemen, word is out...
you are two sophisticated men of means...
nice evening. Peaceful.
Hey, kid.
you sleep up there. In the tower.
hey... we don't know nothing about kids.
so if you need something... - Find it yourself.
or better yet, learn to do without.
we're both getting old. - Fixing to die any time.
so if we kick off in the middle of the night, you're on your own.
jumpy little fella. - Mmm.
quiet though.
uncle Hub?
uncle Hub?
he's sleepwalking.
brand new mattress and I'm still waking up tired and sore.
so...
you two disappeared for...
40 whole years.
where were you?
africa mostly... Morocco,
algeria, Kenya...
not much sadder than a couple of has-beens jabbering
those days are through. So are we.
I hate this!
I hate it! - We're retired.
gardening is what retired people do.
what do we want any damn vegetables for anyway?
they're good for you. Make you live to be 100.
Oh yeah? Yeah? To hell with that.
you live to be 100.
Hey, Uncle Hub! - Hub, how are you doing?
kids, say hi to Uncle Hub.
