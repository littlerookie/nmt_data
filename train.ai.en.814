hang on a second.
can I help you?
the name's tommy.
I know something about a murder.
talk to me.
but I had, like, nothing to do with it, though.
look, I-I even got proof.
does this have to do with the missing csi?
me and my friend...
we took her.
where is the missing csi right now?
7501 whitlock.
robert milland's house.
take him, frank.
take him.
Eric, 7501 whitlock.
get swat.
tactical units to 7501 whitlock.
officer hostage situation in progress.
clear.
we clear?
all clear.
H? Yeah, the house is clean.
I'm not sure if calleigh was here, but, uh, she's not now.
what else?
hang on a second.
found an interesting picture of our murder victim.
he's with that guy, the landlord, that said he has nothing to do with the poker games.
so he's a liar.
bring him in.
I didn't shoot robert.
neither did the killer.
he was poisoned using arsenic.
you lied to us.
because you knew robert milland, and you knew about the poker game.
Yeah, well, that's only half true.
I knew robert.
we used to hit vegas together, but he got tired of the casino scene.
said that underground poker was more... exciting.
so you let him use your buildings for a cut of the action?
no way.
those games are full of criminals.
robert liked to play the gangster.
not me.
so you're saying he broke into your buildings?
Yeah. I had trouble unloading the building.
he took advantage of it. Pissed me off.
and you wanted to make sure that'd never happen again, right?
I swear, I didn'T.
you know where csi duquesne is?
because if you do, you better tell me.
lieutenant caine is working on the killer's fingerprints, and if they match yours, I'm not going to be so nice a second time.
you sure you don't know where tommy went?
you heard him-- he went to get bleach.
Yeah, and he never came back after whispering in the corner with you.
maybe he got caught, or maybe he got scared.
you're the one who should be scared, bitch.
see, you just became my new partner.
and we're about to pull off the biggest heist in underground miami.
here?
you flask
I just...couldn't lose again.
explain that, please.
I was in a rut.
robert was too good.
he was always rubbing it in my face, you know, just...
always had to bring up the new rolex.
the donzi.
his hummer.
all paid for by my kid's college fund.
sorry, girls.
looks like community college for the little ones.
I didn't want my wife to find out how deep I was in.
so by getting rid of him, you figured you'd increase your odds.
I had to win back some of what I lost.
for my family...
I just wanted to mess with his game, so I...
I spiked his flask.
look, the guy never took a sip.
walked away with the biggest pot of the night. How'd he do that?
he drank it after the game, paul.
it gave him a heart attack.
you didn't lose your gun in that game, did you, paul?
no.
I was so pissed.
I drove by robert's place afterwards.
I saw the hummer a few streets over.
I thought it was his.
fired off a few rounds.
freaked when i saw the csi decal.
I don't blame you.
have we made any progress, miss boa vista?
I had the techs scour this entire place, and there's just nothing that says that tommy garver or seth mcadams was ever here.
well, what we do know is they had calleigh clean the place.
she did such a great job of helping us id these suspects.
I just wish there was a way she could have told us where she went.
maybe there is.
better not miss one fingerprint.
Hello, talk to me.
club descent, 6:00 P. M.
I'll be there.
$100, 000 buy-in?
perfect.
Yes, I got her.
okay. All right.
and if I'm not mistaken, baking soda...
and grape juice...
look at that.
invisible ink.
precisely.
descent. 6 P. M.
club descent. You know it?
I know it.
just got one last little errand, and then this is all gonna be over for you, my dear.
the poker game?
that's my girl.
what do you need me for?
let's just say I'm not exactly on the invite list.
here.
my badge.
get him to open the door.
go!
Miami-Dade P. D.
sorry. Invitation only.
Yeah, here's my invite.
all right, ladies, poker game's over.
I want all your cash now.
come on.
drop the guns, or I will shoot her.
you're not gonna get the chance.
now, if I were you, I'd fold.
don't you agree, calleigh?
clear!
you messed with the wrong people.
so you're sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
what are you gonna do?
are you gonna take some time off?
I really don't know, to be honest.
I think I just want to go home, think about what happened.
Hey, you're not going home alone.
Eric, I'm fine.
I really am, I promise, but thank you.
I'm not.
I don't know what I would have done if something would have happened to you today.
okay.
Thanks, Frank so, what's the story names
jumped through a window to commit suicide?
that doesn't make sense.
they usually take the path of least resistance, don't they, gentlemen?
these guys don't want to create more pain for themselves.
they want to release it.
plenty of bridges in Miami to jump off of without a bunch of glass gettin' in the way.
I agree with that, too, so we may be dealing with a homicide.
thought was my job to classify that.
your new M. E.
pleasure to be working with you, gentlemen.
morning, doctor. Glad to have you on board.
I realize I have some big shoes to fill, so hope you'll bear with me.
let's see.
the victim suffered antemortem lacerations to the hands, face and neck.
what the hell was that?
call fire-rescue! We may have a live one here.
she's hit! She's hit!
go! Go! Go!
she's... gone.
excuse me.
Dr. Thomas Wellner.
I was told to report here, uh, fill in for Dr. Wood's replacement?
Yeah.
actually, you're replacing the replacement.
Dr. Higgins was killed in the crossfire.
I see.
Hey, Frank.
one hell of a morning, huh?
no luck on tracking the shooter.
I got every man out there canvassing the area.
we've got every angle covered here.
I'm gonna take the streets.
got Ryan and Natalia going to check out the room that Manny Ortega fell from.
think that was a bad call on fire-rescue's part?
I mean, you heard it.
our dead guy took a damn breath.
well, wasn't a breath.
it was a death rattle.
sounds like our shooter was lying in wait.
wanted to make sure Ortega was dead.
he didn't care about who was collateral damage, either.
our new M. E. was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want this guy bad.
Yeah, we'll get him, Frank.
we'll get him.
excuse me?
am I in the right place?
well, it depends.
who are you?
the medical examiner said I could come up here, see about my brother, Manny.
Yeah. Listen, Mr. Ortega, we have other means of identification if you don't want to...
after everything that's happened, I don't want to remember him like that.
listen, can I...can I take his belongings?
I'm afraid we can't release them.
this is still an open case.
all right, I understand.
if you don't mind me asking, were you two very close?
well, when we were younger, you know...
Yeah. Manny was prideful, you know.
it got in the way.
how so?
we didn't have much schooling, you know?
I did well for myself, and he struggled.
you think you'd know of anybody that'd want to do harm to him?
not specifically, but...
he'd disappear for weeks at a time.
not to do any missionary work.
I'd like to say that I never thought he'd end up this way, but...
I can't.
it's like a war zone down there.
just goes to show, no crime scene is ever safe, huh?
God, that poor M. E.
so obviously Manny Ortega fell from up here.
Yeah, or he was pushed.
well, the building's vacant, so what was he doing up here in the first place?
my guess is, nothing good.
this room is completely empty.
it's going to be really hard to get an I. D. on the killer, I think.
maybe not.
you have something?
blood swipe.
blood swipe?
good catch.
so who are you?
you know my name.
let me rephrase that.
who are you really?
reaching in my back pocket.
be my guest.
I'm ATF.
so you're a federal agent with a criminal record.
pure fiction.
used to work undercover.
those trumped-up charges gave me street cred.
in case somebody got wise.
Yeah.
Manny's death was, uh...an inconvenience.
inconvenience?
you mean, like my medical examiner.
you got her killed today, you know?
I could charge you with murder.
now hang on a minute.
I've been tracking illegal munitions sales in south Florida.
Manny showed up on my radar.
I'm losing interest, agent.
all right. He was small time, but in a big game.
he was running all around Miami scaring up buyers for illegal rounds.
and you wanted to find out who Manny was working for.
I squeezed him a little.
see if I could get him to squeal.
he wouldn't bite.
you got the wrong guy, man...
cut the crap.
man, I've been on you for weeks.
all these inquires you've been making
hanging out with drug dealers, rival gangs...
what?
I can't have friends?
that's cute. Cute.
look, I know you're working for somebody.
you tell me who, and I don't make your very near future a living hell.
I ain't saying squat.
I can take the heat.
we'll see about that.
I could have gotten Ortega if I had the time, but somebody beat me to it.
and with him went my case.
am I supposed to be satisfied by this?
I guess you'll have to be.
not for long, agent.
beat it.
Toodle-oo.
Dr. Wellner, I really need something to run with.
do you have anything from these bodies?
just barely getting started on this guy.
I guess I got used to the old M. E.
right- Alexx.
I don't know what kind of spell this guy had over you guys, but, uh...
a woman.
what?
Alexx is a woman.
whatever.
look, this is detailed work.
a tad more delicate than dusting for prints.
listen, as an M. E.I'm sure you can appreciate the gravity of this case, okay?
all we have to work with right now is trajectory.
so if you please...put a little move on it.
right.
I guess if you're here that means, uh...
Yeah. I finished my proficiencies.
I think you mean, my proficiencies.
you know, Eric, I just don't even think that we need to talk about it.
I really didn't mind having a refresher course.
it was good for me.
anyway... this is terrible.
I don't even know what to say.
have we got any leads?
I processed all the rounds from the scene.
I ran them through IBIS.
I got zip.
so the only thing we have to go on is if the shooter left something behind.
Yeah.
well... the shooter obviously wasn't perched up there, because the rods are facing that way.
right up there at parking structure.
shall we?
here we go.
look at all these casings.
explains why we couldn't see him.
the sun was right in our eyes and he used it to his advantage.
we may have a live one!
got an unspent round.
there are a bunch of them. It must've dropped during the chaos.
they're oxidized, too.
I can't see the head stamp.
this could be a nice lead.
I'll run the rest through prints, see if anything pops.
this is strange. They all look oxidized.
take a look at this.
it's a piece of a gun grip.
weapon malfunctioned.
you know, a blast like that could have injured the shooter.
Horatio, it's Eric.
listen, our shooter's weapon malfunctioned.
he could be injured.
okay. Here's what we do.
canvas all ERs.
let's do it right now.
all right, I'll tell them we're looking for someone with powder burns.
Hey, good to see you again, Red. It really is.
this place is starting to feel like a second home to me.
so... what kinda two-bit beef you got conjured up this time?
I am working on a double homicide, Ron, in which the killer's gun malfunctioned, resulting in the type of powder burn that you are sporting on your neck.
Oh, well, I fired a gun recently.
Yes, I did, at the range, and I accidentally put in the wrong size rounds.
so, I got a little powder burn on the neck.
Yes, you were at the range.
Yeah, well, this day and age, you want to be prepared, you know, protect your family.
family, Ron.
like it or not, we are family now.
and I really wouldn't want anyone to try and take them away from me.
where is your gun, Ron?
it was useless. I dumped it.
I'm sure it's in some garbage dump.
you know, Ron, that seems a tad flimsy to me.
does it?
I don't think it's as flimsy as what I got brought in here for.
you want to book me?
book me.
I'm gonna find the gun, Ron.
you play the hero, but it's gotta kill you. Huh?
deep down...
that you're so bound by the law.
you know, Ron...
justice comes in many forms.
so does self-delusion.
just thought I'd come in and check on you.
check on me? Why?
Oh. Right.
bullets fly and everyone thinks I'm supposed to have some sort of Vietnam flashback?
it goes with the job.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you have to get used to it.
look, I'm fine.
but thanks.
okay.
what were you cooking up over there in the fuming chamber?
hopefully,
I didn't get any viable prints from the gun grip, so I ran the prints from the casings.
he's got a previous assault charge.
Horatio. Yeah, I've got a name.
Hey! Who are you and how'd you get past security?
all-access pass.
we're looking for this guy, Brad Gower.
Brad. Um... yeah, sure.
that's me. Can I help you?
Yeah. You sure can.
turn around and put your hands on the table.
turn around!
what's this all about?
he's clean.
never heard of him. Why?
your fingerprint was on a bullet casing connected to his murder.
okay. Let me stop you right there.
this is a munitions supply company.
my prints are on thousands of live bullets.
I do spot checks for quality control.
Really? We didn't see a sign on the front door.
well, I don't sell to the public.
I'm an independent defense contractor.
you can check my contract with the DOD.
you supply ammunition to our armed forces?
not exactly.
the U. S. pays me for the ammo and then, uh, distributes it to our allies around the world.
we supply them, they help us.
it's a win-win.
I find your patriotism inspiring.
I'm more interested in capitalism.
I gotta be honest with you.
deal's worth over ten mil.
ten mil for rusty bullets?
rusty?
Hey. Anything can happen once these bullets leave my warehouse.
it already has.
unless you want this on you, you help us track that rusty bullet back to your shipment.
give me the ballistics info on the round.
I'll do my best.
good decision.
I'll call Calleigh.
Hey, Calleigh, this is Frank.
you got anything off those unspent rounds?
not yet. I'm just getting started on them.
I got a guy that says he might be able to track the buyer.
thank god, you're okay.
it was crazy.
the bullet just rolled off the table.
then the lab catches on fire.
normally bullets don't discharge when they hit the ground.
I know. It's because they were old.
I should have known something because of the oxidation.
don't beat yourself up over it.
because of me, the entire case is probably compromised.
there were three unspent bullets at the scene, right?
Yeah.
how many of them were compromised?
I think two.
there's probably another one in the rubble.
all right. Let's find it.
Hey.
here it is.
I found it.
you are my hero.
success?
success!
I used my bullet-puller to neutralize the bullet, so, let's see what we've got.
so you've got black powder there.
you don't see that much anymore.
I know. It's predominantly smokeless these days.
it's because they add stabilizers to make it safe.
could explain why the round was unstable.
Yeah, black powder doesn't have that.
no, without the stabilizers, the powder deteriorates over time.
it becomes acidic, which releases heat.
with nowhere to go, that heat builds up towards a flashpoint, and it's just itchin' for a reason to blow.
does that explain why the bullets are so oxidized, is they're old?
almost 40 years old, to be exact.
this round was made in 1969.
you know what that writing is?
it's Cyrillic.
it was manufactured in a Soviet bloc country.
why are those even in circulation?
it shouldn't be.
it's illegal to sell old ammunition from those countries.
you know, all of this stuff is coming from Brad Gower's company.
means he's buying old ammo, and selling it as new through his defense contract.
Yep. Collecting it up cheap, selling it off at a huge profit-- it's a nice scam.
maybe our vic Manny knew about this- was looking for a payday.
well, there's only one way to find out.
Hi, Brad.
put your hands on your head and get down on your knees right now.
here's your warrant to search the premises.
still after me for those murders?
I already told you, I just touched those bullets.
got something over here.
you sure did- right before you loaded the magazine and fired it.
nine mill, cracked grip.
matches the piece we found at the scene.
okay, Brad, this is your chance.
Manny introduced himself.
he said he wanted to off-load some ammo.
what kind of ammunition?
he said it was some brand new prototype.
supposed to be the most dangerous ammo ever made.
it seemed too good to be true, so I followed him this morning.
the guy he met had "fed" written all over him.
I figured manny was a snitch, that he was trying to lure me in with the promise of new bullets and then deliver me to the feds for reselling the rusty ones.
Hey, Ortega.
Brad, what are you doing here?
Where's your friend, Ortega?
what friend?
the fed.
you didn't think I'd see him leave?
you trying to rat me out?
trying to get me busted on an illegal weapons charge?
how stupid do you think I am, Ortega?
choose.
choose? What?
the way you're going to die.
either you take your chances with this bullet, or you spread your wings -
see if you can fly.
no, no, no, no, no. We can work this out!
I didn't think he'd actually jump.
I couldn't take the chance that he'd get up again.
I actually thought he was dead, until you guys arrived.
that woman- she yelled.
call fire-rescue. We may have a live one.
and that's when you panicked.
I wanted Manny gone.
I didn't mean to kill her.
but you did, Brad, you did kill her.
take him direct to booking, please.
everybody down!
go! Go! Go! Run! Run!
Frank, this is getting to be a very nasty habit.
Hey, Frank, where's Horatio?
mobilizing the troops.
I've got every man out there looking for that car.
I'm also thinking about upping my life insurance.
so we've got a drive-by shooter who only gets off one shot?
Yep. One entry wound, a couple dozen exit wounds.
you know, I've heard about these, but I've never seen them.
they're called fused alloy rounds.
what makes them so special?
basically, they're just fragments of metal put together with heat.
if it comes in contact with something cold, such as body armor, it remains intact and sails right through.
if it comes in contact with a heat source, for example, a human being, the heat reverses the manufacturing process and the bullet returns to its original state.
fragmenting back into pieces.
it's dual-purpose ammo.
body armor or not, either way they got you.
so any shot's a kill shot?
Yeah.
well, hell, with ammo like that, ATF ought to be all over that.
you're right.
and I bet they are.
look, if this is about Manny Ortega I already told lieutenant Caine...
the Ortega murder's been solved.
Brad Gower confessed.
you've been tracking illegal munitions in south Florida, so I figured you knew Brad and his partner were selling outdated ammo.
Yeah, I knew, but I looked the other way.
those bullets are going overseas and hard reality is, that's their problem.
I'm worried about the bigger threat here in Miami.
the fused alloy rounds.
well done.
you go to the head of the class.
they are lethal and illegal.
that makes outlaws the perfect buyers.
have you been able to figure out who's making them?
no.
that's why I need to find out who's buying them.
what about Manny Ortega?
any idea how he fits in the big picture?
chatter says he's soliciting buyers for the munitions maker.
look, Manny, I know what you've been doing.
you've been prowling around for buyers.
buyers for fused alloy rounds.
you got the wrong guy, man...
cut the crap.
all these inquiries you've been making
hanging out with drug dealers, rival gangs...
what?
I can't have friends?
look, you're working for somebody.
you tell me who and I don't make your very near future a living hell.
I ain't saying squat.
we'll see about that.
you've got till noon tomorrow.
I get a name...
or you don't get a second chance.
you know, agent Caldwell, in my opinion you should have protected him.
he got left out in the cold- that's why he got killed.
a life like his- I'd call it karma.
I guess.
since you were surveilling Manny, I imagine you know all of his buyers.
I'd like a list of the names, if you don't mind.
anybody asks...
I was never here.
I just got a list from ATF of interested buyers in fused alloy rounds.
could get us closer to who shot Brad Gower.
they did their homework.
they cracked the shell corporations and then tied them to individuals.
there's someone on there who's very familiar.
thank you, ma'am.
let me know what I can do.
okay, you know something, Caine, I'm really getting sick of this.
you are about five words away from a harassment suit.
what do you want now?
Brad Gower was just killed with the same ammunition that you purchased from Manny Ortega.
what, so someone put me on a list- who cares?
anyone could do that.
who?
Manny what?
I never killed a guy called Gower.
I've got an alibi.
you have an alibi?
Yeah, I do, I do.
and it's ironclad.
Julia and I...
we just got married.
we're family now.
we're legal.
20 smiling people in one of your fine courtrooms.
doesn't get any better than that, does it?
what are you planning to do with the rest of the ammunition you purchased, Ron?
well, hypothetically, if I were buying up all the bullets,
I'd be using it for only one thing and one thing only.
is that a threat?
don't flatter yourself.
although it would be a lot easier on Kyle come Father's Day.
Ron, you're going to be dead by Father's Day.
I guess congratulations are in order.
you heard.
the wedding was a little spur-of-the-moment.
does Kyle know?
is that why you've come?
to lecture me about who I should be seeing?
Julia, Ron is after your money.
my money?
the money you've amassed over the years of doing what you do.
Really?
and what is that?
when you're gone, he will eliminate the one thing that stands between him and that money.
you're talking about Kyle.
you don't think I considered that?
I am not going to let that happen.
you don't have a choice.
where the boy is concerned, I do.
what are you proposing?
do not go back home.
you meet me at Miami shores airstrip at 5: 00 P. M. Today.
the boy is innocent.
we'll be there at 5: 00.
what's going on, dad?
I need to talk to you.
this looks serious.
it is serious.
is it about Ron again?
it's about Ron.
now listen to me. I need you and your mother to leave the country for a while.
what do you mean, for a while? How long is a while?
for as long as it takes.
look, it took me my entire life to meet you.
okay, now you just want to send me away?
someday you will understand what I am doing.
that's what they all say, and then they're just gone.
I need you to trust me.
Yeah, they all say that, too.
suspect vehicle in the drive-by shooting located at Bayfront Park metromover stop.
everybody down!
this is the car from the drive-by shooting?
Yeah, patrol found it five blocks from the crime scene.
fortunately, Horatio left his calling card.
you find anything else?
no, unfortunately not.
there were no prints, no trace.
whoever ditched the car got rid of the license plates, took off the vin number and they left the keys.
I bet they wanted it to get stolen.
so, where does that leave us?
well, a car like this will have a navigation system that I bet is linked to bluetooth.
Bluetooth- so a driver can talk on their cell phone hands-free?
exactly. And if the shooter paired his cell phone with the car, the navigation system will have record of it.
and the number will be stored in the system's memory.
look whose number's up.
Colin Madison, you worked with Brad Gower.
Yes, I did...
until today.
until you killed him.
me?
there was a drive-by, one shot.
unfortunately, for you, we can put you in that car.
no. No, no. No way. No.
now see, I bet you think you got away with it because you cleaned your car, but here's the thing. It's your navigation system that gave you away.
it's hooked into your bluetooth, which is linked to your cell phone.
put your cell phone on the table, Colin.
Hey, listen, I just realized I'm late for something.
I gotta go.
what's going on?
um, I can't explain right now.
I'll talk to you later.
Colin, here's the thing.
I know that you killed Brad, I just don't know why.
you're cheating the government on the defense contract, you're making money hand over fist.
you mean, Brad was making the money.
I was on an hourly.
he wouldn't cut me in.
so you wanted him out?
you're trying to muscle into the business?
not at all.
I wanted to live.
this morning, a guy burst into my office with a gun pointed at me.
you Brad Gower?
I had to try and convince him I wasn't Brad.
What'd he ask you?
he didn't ask me anything.
he told me.
said if I didn't kill Brad, I'd be next.
he even gave me the bullet to use on him.
why would he do that?
said he had a score to settle.
look, I know the guy meant business, so I did it.
everybody down!
do you know his name?
know his name?
make me a deal, and I take you to him.
dispatch, swat's making entry, 144 tenth street.
10-4, air 21. Respond.
it's quite a performance you put on this morning.
you came to claim Manny's stuff, look for anything that might incriminate you.
Yeah, you can never be too careful.
so your brother worked for you.
Yeah.
he really surprised me, you know?
did very well for himself.
I was very proud of him.
I guess that means he warranted a revenge killing, then.
you'd kill for your family, wouldn't you?
how many rounds of this ammunition would you say is out on the street?
the alloy?
I don't know.
none...
some...
a lot.
we got you on multiple charges.
might as well talk, Juan.
no, see, I believe in self-preservation, which is something you ought to think about, lieutenant.
cause by taking me down, you're gonna make a lot of people angry.
so consider yourself warned.
take him.
what time is it?
what?
what time? What time is it?
it's 4: 00.
I'll be right back.
I need to take care of something.
where are you going? Dad said he was gonna meet us in an hour.
don't worry about Horatio.
just stay here and don't use the phone.
be careful, mom.
I will.
Horatio Caine.
Thanks, Frank so, what's the story names
jumped through a window to commit suicide?
that doesn't make sense.
they usually take the path of least resistance, don't they, gentlemen?
these guys don't want to create more pain for themselves.
they want to release it.
plenty of bridges in Miami to jump off of without a bunch of glass gettin' in the way.
I agree with that, too, so we may be dealing with a homicide.
thought was my job to classify that.
your new M. E.
pleasure to be working with you, gentlemen.
morning, doctor. Glad to have you on board.
I realize I have some big shoes to fill, so hope you'll bear with me.
let's see.
the victim suffered antemortem lacerations to the hands, face and neck.
what the hell was that?
call fire-rescue! We may have a live one here.
she's hit! She's hit!
go! Go! Go!
she's... gone.
excuse me.
Dr. Thomas Wellner.
I was told to report here, uh, fill in for Dr. Wood's replacement?
Yeah.
actually, you're replacing the replacement.
Dr. Higgins was killed in the crossfire.
I see.
Hey, Frank.
one hell of a morning, huh?
no luck on tracking the shooter.
I got every man out there canvassing the area.
we've got every angle covered here.
I'm gonna take the streets.
got Ryan and Natalia going to check out the room that Manny Ortega fell from.
think that was a bad call on fire-rescue's part?
I mean, you heard it.
our dead guy took a damn breath.
well, wasn't a breath.
it was a death rattle.
sounds like our shooter was lying in wait.
wanted to make sure Ortega was dead.
he didn't care about who was collateral damage, either.
our new M. E. was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want this guy bad.
Yeah, we'll get him, Frank.
we'll get him.
excuse me?
am I in the right place?
well, it depends.
who are you?
the medical examiner said I could come up here, see about my brother, Manny.
Yeah. Listen, Mr. Ortega, we have other means of identification if you don't want to...
after everything that's happened, I don't want to remember him like that.
listen, can I...can I take his belongings?
I'm afraid we can't release them.
this is still an open case.
all right, I understand.
if you don't mind me asking, were you two very close?
well, when we were younger, you know...
Yeah. Manny was prideful, you know.
it got in the way.
how so?
we didn't have much schooling, you know?
I did well for myself, and he struggled.
you think you'd know of anybody that'd want to do harm to him?
not specifically, but...
he'd disappear for weeks at a time.
not to do any missionary work.
I'd like to say that I never thought he'd end up this way, but...
I can't.
it's like a war zone down there.
just goes to show, no crime scene is ever safe, huh?
God, that poor M. E.
so obviously Manny Ortega fell from up here.
Yeah, or he was pushed.
well, the building's vacant, so what was he doing up here in the first place?
my guess is, nothing good.
this room is completely empty.
it's going to be really hard to get an I. D. on the killer, I think.
maybe not.
you have something?
blood swipe.
blood swipe?
good catch.
so who are you?
you know my name.
let me rephrase that.
who are you really?
reaching in my back pocket.
be my guest.
I'm ATF.
so you're a federal agent with a criminal record.
pure fiction.
used to work undercover.
those trumped-up charges gave me street cred.
in case somebody got wise.
Yeah.
Manny's death was, uh...an inconvenience.
inconvenience?
you mean, like my medical examiner.
you got her killed today, you know?
I could charge you with murder.
now hang on a minute.
I've been tracking illegal munitions sales in south Florida.
Manny showed up on my radar.
I'm losing interest, agent.
all right. He was small time, but in a big game.
he was running all around Miami scaring up buyers for illegal rounds.
and you wanted to find out who manny was working for.
I squeezed him a little.
see if I could get him to squeal.
he wouldn't bite.
you got the wrong guy, man...
cut the crap.
man, I've been on you for weeks.
all these inquires you've been making
hanging out with drug dealers, rival gangs...
what?
I can't have friends?
that's cute. Cute.
look, I know you're working for somebody.
you tell me who, and I don't make your very near future a living hell.
I ain't saying squat.
I can take the heat.
we'll see about that.
I could have gotten Ortega if I had the time, but somebody beat me to it.
and with him went my case.
am I supposed to be satisfied by this?
I guess you'll have to be.
not for long, agent.
beat it.
Toodle-loo.
Dr. Wellner, I really need something to run with.
do you have anything from these bodies?
just barely getting started on this guy.
I guess I got used to the old M. E.
right- Alexx.
I don't know what kind of spell this guy had over you guys, but, uh...
a woman.
what?
Alexx is a woman.
whatever.
look, this is detailed work.
a tad more delicate than dusting for prints.
listen, as an M. E.I'm sure you can appreciate the gravity of this case, okay?
all we have to work with right now is trajectory.
so if you please...put a little move on it.
right.
I guess if you're here that means, uh...
Yeah. I finished my proficiencies.
I think you mean, my proficiencies.
you know, Eric, I just don't even think that we need to talk about it.
I really didn't mind having a refresher course.
it was good for me.
anyway... this is terrible.
I don't even know what to say.
have we got any leads?
I processed all the rounds from the scene.
I ran them through IBIS.
I got zip.
so the only thing we have to go on is if the shooter left something behind.
Yeah.
well... the shooter obviously wasn't perched up there, because the rods are facing that way.
right up there at parking structure.
shall we?
here we go.
look at all these casings.
explains why we couldn't see him.
the sun was right in our eyes and he used it to his advantage.
we may have a live one!
got an unspent round.
there are a bunch of them. It must've dropped during the chaos.
they're oxidized, too.
I can't see the head stamp.
this could be a nice lead.
I'll run the rest through prints, see if anything pops.
this is strange. They all look oxidized.
take a look at this.
it's a piece of a gun grip.
weapon malfunctioned.
you know, a blast like that could have injured the shooter.
Horatio, it's Eric.
listen, our shooter's weapon malfunctioned.
he could be injured.
okay. Here's what we do.
canvas all ERs.
let's do it right now.
all right, I'll tell them we're looking for someone with powder burns.
Hey, good to see you again, Red. It really is.
this place is starting to feel like a second home to me.
so... what kinda two-bit beef you got conjured up this time?
I am working on a double homicide, Ron, in which the killer's gun malfunctioned, resulting in the type of powder burn that you are sporting on your neck.
Oh, well, I fired a gun recently.
Yes, I did, at the range, and I accidentally put in the wrong size rounds.
so, I got a little powder burn on the neck.
Yes, you were at the range.
Yeah, well, this day and age, you want to be prepared, you know, protect your family.
family, Ron.
like it or not, we are family now.
and I really wouldn't want anyone to try and take them away from me.
where is your gun, Ron?
it was useless. I dumped it.
I'm sure it's in some garbage dump.
you know, Ron, that seems a tad flimsy to me.
does it?
I don't think it's as flimsy as what I got brought in here for.
you want to book me?
book me.
I'm gonna find the gun, Ron.
you play the hero, but it's gotta kill you. Huh?
deep down...
that you're so bound by the law.
you know, Ron...
justice comes in many forms.
so does self-delusion.
just thought I'd come in and check on you.
check on me? Why?
Oh. Right.
bullets fly and everyone thinks I'm supposed to have some sort of Vietnam flashback?
it goes with the job.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you have to get used to it.
look, I'm fine.
but thanks.
okay.
what were you cooking up over there in the fuming chamber?
hopefully,
I didn't get any viable prints from the gun grip, so I ran the prints from the casings.
he's got a previous assault charge.
Horatio. Yeah, I've got a name.
Hey! Who are you and how'd you get past security?
all-access pass.
we're looking for this guy, Brad Gower.
Brad. Um... yeah, sure.
that's me. Can I help you?
Yeah. You sure can.
turn around and put your hands on the table.
turn around!
what's this all about?
he's clean.
never heard of him. Why?
your fingerprint was on a bullet casing connected to his murder.
okay. Let me stop you right there.
this is a munitions supply company.
my prints are on thousands of live bullets.
I do spot checks for quality control.
Really? We didn't see a sign on the front door.
well, I don't sell to the public.
I'm an independent defense contractor.
you can check my contract with the DOD.
you supply ammunition to our armed forces?
not exactly.
the U. S. pays me for the ammo and then, uh, distributes it to our allies around the world.
we supply them, they help us.
it's a win-win.
I find your patriotism inspiring.
I'm more interested in capitalism.
I gotta be honest with you.
deal's worth over ten mil.
ten mil for rusty bullets?
rusty?
Hey. Anything can happen once these bullets leave my warehouse.
it already has.
unless you want this on you, you help us track that rusty bullet back to your shipment.
give me the ballistics info on the round.
I'll do my best.
good decision.
I'll call Calleigh.
Hey, Calleigh, this is Frank.
you got anything off those unspent rounds?
not yet. I'm just getting started on them.
I got a guy that says he might be able to track the buyer.
thank god, you're okay.
it was crazy.
the bullet just rolled off the table.
then the lab catches on fire.
normally bullets don't discharge when they hit the ground.
I know. It's because they were old.
I should have known something because of the oxidation.
don't beat yourself up over it.
because of me, the entire case is probably compromised.
there were three unspent bullets at the scene, right?
Yeah.
how many of them were compromised?
I think two.
there's probably another one in the rubble.
all right. Let's find it.
Hey.
here it is.
I found it.
you are my hero.
success?
success!
I used my bullet-puller to neutralize the bullet, so, let's see what we've got.
so you've got black powder there.
you don't see that much anymore.
I know. It's predominantly smokeless these days.
it's because they add stabilizers to make it safe.
could explain why the round was unstable.
Yeah, black powder doesn't have that.
no, without the stabilizers, the powder deteriorates over time.
it becomes acidic, which releases heat.
with nowhere to go, that heat builds up towards a flashpoint, and it's just itchin' for a reason to blow.
does that explain why the bullets are so oxidized, is they're old?
almost 40 years old, to be exact.
this round was made in 1969.
you know what that writing is?
it's Cyrillic.
it was manufactured in a Soviet bloc country.
why are those even in circulation?
it shouldn't be.
it's illegal to sell old ammunition from those countries.
you know, all of this stuff is coming from Brad Gower's company.
means he's buying old ammo, and selling it as new through his defense contract.
Yep. Collecting it up cheap, selling it off at a huge profit- it's a nice scam.
maybe our vic Manny knew about this- was looking for a payday.
well, there's only one way to find out.
Hi, Brad.
put your hands on your head and get down on your knees right now.
here's your warrant to search the premises.
still after me for those murders?
I already told you, I just touched those bullets.
got something over here.
you sure did- right before you loaded the magazine and fired it.
nine mill, cracked grip.
matches the piece we found at the scene.
okay, Brad, this is your chance.
Manny introduced himself.
he said he wanted to off-load some ammo.
what kind of ammunition?
he said it was some brand new prototype.
supposed to be the most dangerous ammo ever made.
it seemed too good to be true, so I followed him this morning.
the guy he met had "fed" written all over him.
I figured manny was a snitch, that he was trying to lure me in with the promise of new bullets and then deliver me to the feds for reselling the rusty ones.
Hey, Ortega.
Brad, what are you doing here?
Where's your friend, Ortega?
what friend?
the fed.
you didn't think I'd see him leave?
you trying to rat me out?
trying to get me busted on an illegal weapons charge?
how stupid do you think I am, Ortega?
choose.
choose? What?
the way you're going to die.
either you take your chances with this bullet, or you spread your wings-
see if you can fly.
no, no, no, no, no. We can work this out!
I didn't think he'd actually jump.
I couldn't take the chance that he'd get up again.
I actually thought he was dead, until you guys arrived.
that woman- she yelled.
call fire-rescue. We may have a live one.
and that's when you panicked.
I wanted Manny gone.
I didn't mean to kill her.
but you did, Brad, you did kill her.
take him direct to booking, please.
everybody down!
go! Go! Go! Run! Run!
Frank, this is getting to be a very nasty habit.
Hey, Frank, where's Horatio?
mobilizing the troops.
I've got every man out there looking for that car.
I'm also thinking about upping my life insurance.
so we've got a drive-by shooter who only gets off one shot?
Yep. One entry wound, a couple dozen exit wounds.
you know, I've heard about these, but I've never seen them.
they're called fused alloy rounds.
what makes them so special?
basically, they're just fragments of metal put together with heat.
if it comes in contact with something cold, such as body armor, it remains intact and sails right through.
if it comes in contact with a heat source, for example, a human being, the heat reverses the manufacturing process and the bullet returns to its original state.
fragmenting back into pieces.
it's dual-purpose ammo.
body armor or not, either way they got you.
so any shot's a kill shot?
Yeah.
well, hell, with ammo like that, atf ought to be all over that.
you're right.
and I bet they are.
look, if this is about Manny Ortega I already told lieutenant Caine...
the Ortega murder's been solved.
Brad Gower confessed.
you've been tracking illegal munitions in south Florida, so I figured you knew Brad and his partner were selling outdated ammo.
Yeah, I knew, but I looked the other way.
those bullets are going overseas and hard reality is, that's their problem.
I'm worried about the bigger threat here in Miami.
the fused alloy rounds.
well done.
you go to the head of the class.
they are lethal and illegal.
that makes outlaws the perfect buyers.
have you been able to figure out who's making them?
no.
that's why I need to find out who's buying them.
what about Manny Ortega?
any idea how he fits in the big picture?
chatter says he's soliciting buyers for the munitions maker.
look, Manny, I know what you've been doing.
you've been prowling around for buyers.
buyers for fused alloy rounds.
you got the wrong guy, man...
cut the crap.
all these inquiries you've been making
hanging out with drug dealers, rival gangs...
what?
I can't have friends?
look, you're working for somebody.
you tell me who and I don't make your very near future a living hell.
I ain't saying squat.
we'll see about that.
you've got till noon tomorrow.
I get a name...
or you don't get a second chance.
you know, agent Caldwell, in my opinion you should have protected him.
he got left out in the cold- that's why he got killed.
a life like his- I'd call it karma.
I guess.
since you were surveilling Manny, I imagine you know all of his buyers.
I'd like a list of the names, if you don't mind.
anybody asks...
I was never here.
I just got a list from ATF of interested buyers in fused alloy rounds.
could get us closer to who shot Brad Gower.
they did their homework.
they cracked the shell corporations and then tied them to individuals.
there's someone on there who's very familiar.
thank you, ma'am.
let me know what I can do.
okay, you know something, Caine, I'm really getting sick of this.
you are about five words away from a harassment suit.
what do you want now?
Brad Gower was just killed with the same ammunition that you purchased from Manny Ortega.
what, so someone put me on a list- who cares?
anyone could do that.
who?
Manny what?
I never killed a guy called Gower.
I've got an alibi.
you have an alibi?
Yeah, I do, I do.
and it's ironclad.
Julia and I...
we just got married.
we're family now.
we're legal.
20 smiling people in one of your fine courtrooms.
doesn't get any better than that, does it?
what are you planning to do with the rest of the ammunition you purchased, Ron?
well, hypothetically, if I were buying up all the bullets,
I'd be using it for only one thing and one thing only.
is that a threat?
don't flatter yourself.
although it would be a lot easier on Kyle come Father's Day.
Ron, you're going to be dead by Father's Day.
I guess congratulations are in order.
you heard.
the wedding was a little spur-of-the-moment.
does Kyle know?
is that why you've come?
to lecture me about who I should be seeing?
Julia, Ron is after your money.
my money?
the money you've amassed over the years of doing what you do.
Really?
and what is that?
when you're gone, he will eliminate the one thing that stands between him and that money.
you're talking about Kyle.
you don't think I considered that?
I am not going to let that happen.
you don't have a choice.
where the boy is concerned, I do.
what are you proposing?
do not go back home.
you meet me at Miami shores airstrip at 5: 00 P. M. Today.
the boy is innocent.
we'll be there at 5: 00.
what's going on, dad?
I need to talk to you.
this looks serious.
it is serious.
is it about Ron again?
it's about Ron.
now listen to me. I need you and your mother to leave the country for a while.
what do you mean, for a while? How long is a while?
for as long as it takes.
look, it took me my entire life to meet you.
okay, now you just want to send me away?
someday you will understand what I am doing.
that's what they all say, and then they're just gone.
I need you to trust me.
Yeah, they all say that, too.
suspect vehicle in the drive-by shooting located at Bayfront Park metromover stop.
everybody down!
this is the car from the drive-by shooting?
Yeah, patrol found it five blocks from the crime scene.
fortunately, Horatio left his calling card.
you find anything else?
no, unfortunately not.
there were no prints, no trace.
whoever ditched the car got rid of the license plates, took off the vin number and they left the keys.
I bet they wanted it to get stolen.
so, where does that leave us?
well, a car like this will have a navigation system that I bet is linked to bluetooth.
Bluetooth- so a driver can talk on their cell phone hands-free?
exactly. And if the shooter paired his cell phone with the car, the navigation system will have record of it.
and the number will be stored in the system's memory.
look whose number's up.
Colin Madison, you worked with Brad Gower.
Yes, I did...
until today.
until you killed him.
me?
there was a drive-by, one shot.
unfortunately, for you, we can put you in that car.
no. No, no. No way. No.
now see, I bet you think you got away with it because you cleaned your car, but here's the thing. It's your navigation system that gave you away.
it's hooked into your bluetooth, which is linked to your cell phone.
put your cell phone on the table, Colin.
Hey, listen, I just realized I'm late for something.
I gotta go.
what's going on?
um, I can't explain right now.
I'll talk to you later.
Colin, here's the thing.
I know that you killed Brad, I just don't know why.
you're cheating the government on the defense contract, you're making money hand over fist.
you mean, Brad was making the money.
I was on an hourly.
he wouldn't cut me in.
so you wanted him out?
you're trying to muscle into the business?
not at all.
I wanted to live.
this morning, a guy burst into my office with a gun pointed at me.
you Brad Gower?
I had to try and convince him I wasn't Brad.
What'd he ask you?
he didn't ask me anything.
he told me.
said if I didn't kill Brad, I'd be next.
he even gave me the bullet to use on him.
why would he do that?
said he had a score to settle.
look, I know the guy meant business, so I did it.
everybody down!
do you know his name?
know his name?
make me a deal, and I take you to him.
dispatch, swat's making entry, 144 tenth street.
10-4, air 21. Respond.
it's quite a performance you put on this morning.
you came to claim Manny's stuff, look for anything that might incriminate you.
Yeah, you can never be too careful.
so your brother worked for you.
Yeah.
he really surprised me, you know?
did very well for himself.
I was very proud of him.
I guess that means he warranted a revenge killing, then.
you'd kill for your family, wouldn't you?
how many rounds of this ammunition would you say is out on the street?
the alloy?
I don't know.
none...
some...
a lot.
we got you on multiple charges.
might as well talk, Juan.
no, see, I believe in self-preservation, which is something you ought to think about, lieutenant.
cause by taking me down, you're gonna make a lot of people angry.
so consider yourself warned.
take him.
what time is it?
what?
what time? What time is it?
it's 4: 00.
I'll be right back.
I need to take care of something.
where are you going? Dad said he was gonna meet us in an hour.
don't worry about Horatio.
just stay here and don't use the phone.
be careful, mom.
I will.
Horatio Caine.
okay, where are you taking me?
right up here. It's the perfect spot.
Really?
hey... Professor.
well...
pull it out.
let me see it.
so, how many of those do you have out here?
Oh, a dozen or so.
and I try to hide them so they aren't disturbed.
what's it tell you?
water levels, algae content.
anything contaminating the marsh.
it doesn't look contaminated.
just because you can't see it doesn't mean the danger isn't there.
you see those cattails?
they're an Everglades' grave marker.
runoff from the sugar farms makes them grow.
if they aren't dealt with, they'll take over the entire Glades.
so, what you're saying is that, where there's cattails, there's no other life?
then that must mean, you must be very...
very important.
very.
what was that?
I don't know.
could be a black panther.
I had one eat a sensor two months ago.
you did?
there's nothing to worry about.
they're more afraid of us than we are of...
it's getting closer.
whatever it was, it's gone.
Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
get your cell. Call for help.
okay, okay, okay. Hang on.
we're getting you help. Hang on.
all right. Um...
hang on, buddy.
911? Yes, please!
this guy just ran out of the bushes.
he's covered in blood.
I don't know where we are.
where the hell are we?
according to his driver's license, our victim's name is, uh, Vince Koslov.
I got the boys running a background check on him now.
thank you, Frank.
who do we have here?
he found our vic.
or more like, our vic found him.
you understand this is restricted land.
Yeah. I'm one of the few people authorized to be on it.
I work for the Forest Service.
I - I monitor the water quality out here.
what about her?
she authorized? Well, I...
I mean, not technically brought her out here to get technical.
with miles and miles of Everglades all around,
Vince here decided to pick you out.
I don't know why.
I've never seen him before.
I've never seen anyone out here before.
this place is empty.
perfect place for a murder.
is that right?
okay.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
so what have we got?
someone really did a number on this guy's abdomen.
Oh, yeah?
if it's just the abdomen, how come he's covered in blood?
my guess? Sliced his upper gastrointestinal, bled into his esophagus.
he would have coughed that up.
hmm. Any chance he tore himself on these branches coming through the mangroves?
no. The wounds are clustered. Uniform.
and the pucker, which tells me it was a blade.
someone stabbed him with a knife several times.
with wounds like these, I'm surprised he made it through all this mangrove.
he definitely wasn't stabbed far from here.
that actually makes sense.
he was in pretty good shape.
Tripp just ran background on him.
turned out Vince here was an extreme fighter.
like a kickboxer.
Yeah. It's sort of like kickboxing, but, uh... it's a little meaner.
there's no gloves, no rules.
he immigrated here from Russia, won a few titles, then he disappeared a few years back.
maybe I can fill in some of the blanks in post.
all right.
I was wrong about our victim coughing up blood.
his GI tract wasn't punctured.
so where did the blood come from?
I don't know.
there's no trauma to the mouth, so I'm cutting open his stomach to see if the contents tell us where he was before.
I can tell you he didn't chew his food very well.
look at the size of the piece of meat he swallowed.
that's a tattoo.
he ate human flesh.
that's where the blood came from.
Vince took a bite out of someone.
Horatio, are we dealing with a cannibal?
we are dealing with the Russian mob.
that's one of their tattoos.
it looks like a stag's head.
is that some sort of symbol?
it means that his victim was marked for death.
so you're saying our guy Vince, here, was carrying out a hit.
and his victim fought back.
wait. Aren't Calleigh and Eric still out there looking for the crime scene?
they are. And that means somebody's looking for them.
there's some blood here.
there's more blood over here.
it's definitely where Vince came through.
there's a clearing up ahead.
let's be careful. This guy could be anywhere.
it's definitely our crime scene.
Yeah. I'd say this looks like the guy that would have stabbed Vince.
we don't need an M. E. to tell us a cannibal took a bite out of his neck.
Horatio said there was some sort of a stag tattoo on his skin that they found.
that looks like the rest of it right there.
based on the arterial spray, I'd say Vince ripped out his carotid.
no, no, no. Come on.
you know, Calliegh, this guy's Russian mob, too.
how can you tell?
these Russian mob tattoos, they read like a criminal resume?
the cat on his chest - that means he was a thief.
I always forget that you're half Russian.
Yeah. Yeah. I went through a phase when I wanted to learn about Russia and my family's history.
didn't always like what I found.
his diving knife.
I bet that blood on the blade is Vince's.
so cannibal takes a bite out of tattoo boy.
in his final moment, tattoo boy stabs the cannibal. Case closed.
well, we still have to put the knife in his hands.
that shouldn't be too hard to do.
Vince was a fighter, right?
I'll bet you this guy was, too.
take a look at his hands.
sticky stuff.
it's like a spray - on adhesive that fighters use instead of tape.
that rosin will fluoresce under ultraviolet light.
you know what?
if he touched the knife, it will be on the handle.
he never touched the knife.
if he didn't kill Vince, someone else had to.
we're looking for a third man.
Hey. I got a name on that guy you found in the Everglades.
he's in CODIS for a few burglaries.
well, we know who killed Andrew.
let's hope this print can tell us who stabbed Vince.
it it partial? Yeah.
print image is small, but the ridge detail is rich.
let's see what AFIS has to say.
take a look at where he works.
diver Tech Supply.
I think it's time to, uh...
check out his inventory.
can I help you?
I'm not sure yet.
do you sell this knife?
blue Iron's blunt-tipped diver.
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I do.
you interested?
a knife just like this was used in a homicide this morning.
Hey, man, a lot of shops around here carry knives just like that.
this one has your fingerprint on it.
well, yeah, of course it has my fingerprint on it.
I touched it when I sold it this morning.
do you remember who you sold it to?
how can I forget?
it's a young girl. Smoking hot.
come to think of it, she was all business.
I'm looking for blunt-tip dive knife.
Hooked-edge cutting line, quick-release sheath.
got one left.
perfect.
I can get you deals on all the latest dive equipment.
let me guess, you want my name and number for your customer profile?
you read my mind.
it's a quick read.
what time did she come in?
first thing this morning.
you want to talk to her?
miss Gray, could we have a word, please?
who are you?
Miami-Dade PD.
you just purchased a plane ticket?
Yeah, I'm going on vacation.
that's still legal, right?
Yeah. Killing a man isn't.
his name is Vincent Koslov.
he was stabbed to death in the Everglades this morning.
I don't know him.
witness says you purchased a knife from Diver Tech Supply.
a knife just like the one used to kill Vince.
how did you find me?
easy, we flagged your credit card.
miss Gray this is an excellent chance to help yourself.
okay. I did it.
I stabbed him just like you said.
you're confessing to murder?
Yeah.
it was me. I killed him.
okay.
thank you, Miss Gray.
Eric, a 230-pound trained fighter?
there's no way she could have taken him out on her own.
she had help.
miss Gray,
I hadn't noticed the lacerations on your hands before.
did you get those during the stabbing?
Yeah, I did.
is that it? No.
how do you know Andrew Brodsky?
miss Gray,
I believe he asked you a question.
that's my cell phone.
that's right.
while you were being processed, we examined your cell phone.
and it turns out that you made a number of calls to Mr. Brodsky.
that's not all.
look like he's your boyfriend.
he is. So?
miss Gray, before Vince was murdered, he killed Andrew.
it must have been horrible watching Vince rip out Andrew's throat.
he did that to Andrew?
but you know that because you were there...
so you claim.
miss Gray, I don't believe you did this alone.
I believe you're covering for someone.
did you bring him the murder weapon?
no, I...
miss Gray, who did Andrew work for?
he was in construction.
look, you have my confession.
what else do you want?
we're gonna want to swab your hands.
to prove I killed Vince?
for starters.
looks like some sort of glass.
it's all I found from the cuts on her hands, tiny shards of glass.
what kind is it?
so far, three different types:
sodium carbonate, which is used to make beer bottles, and baro-silicate which you might find in restaurant kitchens.
well, there's not a whole lot of those in the Everglades.
what about that third kind?
I was about to find out when you walked in.
let's see what's behind slide number three, shall we?
it's window glass, but it's tempered.
like from a car window?
right. But you see these dark spots?
seems like it's some kind of tar.
you know, tempered glass is often recycled to make asphalt.
I have to say that combination seems an awful lot like a city street and not at all like the Everglades.
so Cassandra Gray didn't cut her hand with a knife, did she?
no, she cut 'em on the pavement.
why would anyone crawl down the road?
she was running? She fell?
she's not covering for somebody. She's running from them.
it's safer in custody.
but to take murder rap?
who would make a person that scared?
the Russian mob.
Horatio, I heard.
cassandra Gray's confession was a dead end.
you want me to release her?
not just yet, Frank.
since both our vics were fighters,
I checked out all the fight clubs, see where they train.
any of them Russian-owned?
Yeah. Uh, an Ivan Sarnov, Aegis Fighting Club.
start there.
beautiful! Whoo!
beautiful! That's the way!
finish him!
take him down!
what are you doing?!
my job.
those badges are worthless in here, bro.
Weller, go cool off.
go cool off.
I'm sorry for his mouth, but he's correct, Lieutenant.
there are no laws being broken here.
till now.
I'm Ivan Sarnov. I own the Aegis.
everything is above board.
these men are all protected under a combative sports agreement.
too bad Andrew Brodsky and Vince Koslov didn't have that same sort of protection.
Yes, and in case you didn't know, Mr. Sarnov, both of those men were found dead in the Everglades today.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't know these men.
what is this?
is this tattoo equipment?
look at this.
this is the exact same stag's head we found on Andrew Brodsky's neck.
I run a clean club.
what my men do outside my doors, I can't control.
what is this?
new mat?
you don't mind, do you?
look at that.
H, we got dried blood here.
in a fighting club, blood is an occupational hazard.
a cut lip didn't produce that amount of blood, Ivan.
I suspect it came from several.
no, it's a continuous pool.
what that means is it's from one donor.
you are training killers here, aren't you?
I think you have wasted enough of my time.
did you get any results from the blood I found at the fight club?
the one that you told me to drop everything for?
Yeah, that one.
Yes. I'm running it through CODIS now.
did you get any hits on Andrew Brodsky or Vince Koslov?
no, it didn't match either reference sample, but let's see what CODIS tells us.
the blood belongs to Nathan Madden.
probably works for Ivan, he's probably got a record.
no, you know what, it's exactly the opposite.
he was reported missing two days ago by his wife Susan Madden.
so she must've provided a reference sample to the department just in case.
their address is listed as a yacht in Wayside Marina.
I'll call Horatio.
Thanks, Natalia. Yeah.
H, we got a lead on the blood pool.
I'm Susan Madden.
Miami-Dade police, ma'am.
can I see some ID?
we're here about the missing persons report you filed on your husband.
did you find him?
we think he may be in some danger, ma'am.
we found traces of his blood at the Aegis Fighting Club.
we wanted to know why he might be at the club.
I don't know.
a man came to see Nathan a couple days ago.
you recognize this man? No.
I heard Nathan say his name.
they were in an argument.
get out of here, Weller.
it's gonna happen one way or the other.
I will not let you do this.
what's going on?
listen...
I like that you're willing to fight for something.
so I'm gonna give you a chance.
how about we have a little bet?
you win, we'll go away.
we win, you do as we ask.
you know what this wager was about?
the last thing that he said was that he would never let anyone take our home away from us.
where are you going? You're scaring me.
don't worry. I have to take care of something.
careful.
he took off in our sport boat.
it's the last time I I saw him.
I'm sorry. I...
I can't say anymore.
you mean you won't say anymore.
no, I can't say anymore.
well, it was one of Ivan's guys at the fight club.
why would he want to take Madden's yacht?
let's ask him.
so, I checked with PD.
Jason Weller's in the wind.
what about Nathan Madden?
nothing.
how does a straight-laced yacht owner end up all mixed up with the Russian guys?
by owning a slip at the Wayside Marina.
well, those are like million- dollar waterfront condos.
there's a 30-year waiting list to get one.
someone's found a way to get around it, though.
in the last six months, 12 slips have sold for $10, 000 apiece.
how's that possible?
because the Cupelo Corporation is behind them.
looks like it's some sort of an offshore company.
so it's probably a shell.
means it's gonna be next to impossible to get their records.
this corporation is strong-arming the owners into selling their slips and then renting them back to them.
so it looks legal, but it's extortion.
I think our missing yacht owner was trying to buck the trend.
he is the one slip that didn't sell.
well, then now we know why he went down to the Russian fight club.
he was trying to keep them from taking his slip.
he was last seen on his sport boat.
let's put out a BOLO.
yamaha 230 spotted in Biscayne National Park.
I think this is it.
there's no sign of Nathan Madden.
you think that belongs to our missing boat owner?
no. Calleigh rushed DNA testing, and it's arterial spray.
it's consistent with Andrew Brodsky's COD.
this is the boat that was at the crime scene in the Everglades.
maybe Madden's still alive.
I don't know, but we're gonna have to figure out who was on this boat.
they might've missed the blood on the hull, but they definitely wiped down the inside.
I've dusted the console, all of the railings.
I'm not finding any usable prints.
what's with the mirror, Wolfe? It's gray carpet.
if there were any shoeprints, we would've seen them already.
not if the dust particles are the same color as the carpet.
okay, take the mirror and move it back, like, 20...
20 degrees, 20-degree angle.
little bit more.
back, back, and stop.
stop it right there.
see that?
see, the light illuminates the front side of the dust particles.
mirror's letting us see the other side because it's shadowing the dust against the light surface.
now we lift them.
if this doesn't match, how many do we have left?
two.
but they both look like the patterns from the victim's shoes.
this one doesn't.
I think we got our killer's shoe.
the brand is Surf Glide.
let's check the known dealers.
it's got to be a long list.
but we only need one.
diver Tech Supply.
where Greg Donner works.
Greg Donner said that he sold the knife that killed Vince to Cassandra.
but his was the only print on it.
now we can put him at the scene.
a shoe print?
a lot of people wear these shoes.
not all of them had the same nick in the tread that you do.
only your shoes were at the murder scene of Andrew Brodsky and Vince Koslov.
we already have your fingerprints on the knife.
I think we've been over that already.
I sold it to that little...
that little what, Greg?
we know you lied about selling the knife.
it was business.
didn't have anything against Andrew, he just didn't follow orders.
what are we doing all the way out here?
sorry, Andrew.
you just don't have your priorities in the right order.
no, no, come on, guys.
look, I'm sorry. I don't know what...
so you had Vince kill Andrew, why stab Vince?
Vince was becoming a liability.
he lacked subtlety.
it's done.
not quite.
in other words, you're Russian mob.
does "Donner" sound Russian to you?
it's not your real name.
Yes, it is.
no.
you changed it to blend in.
adept in the way of the bratva?
subtlety?
what the hell, I'm a dead man anyway, right?
Yeah, I'm bratva.
you don't have the tattoos of a vor, so you don't call the shots.
who ordered the hit?
I don't ask those questions.
neither should you.
what about this question:
Where's Nathan Madden?
we know that you were on his boat.
you mean the rich guy from the marina?
I don't know.
I just borrowed it while he was sparring at the fight club.
I heard the idiot was fighting for his boat slip.
my guess is he lost more than that.
No! Please!
who was he fighting?
Aw, gee, Officer, I just don't know.
all those big men at the gym, they all look the same to me.
so Cassandra saw.
that's why you lied to us about selling her the dive knife?
she was a loose end needed tying.
figured you could flush her out for us.
Thanks.
get him out of here.
well, we solved the Everglades murder.
now all we need to do is find Nathan Madden.
they were very interested in Cassandra.
let's ask her.
it turns out, Miss Gray, that we've apprehended Mr. Koslov's killer.
you have to let me go now, don't you?
it seems clear that you confessed to us because you were afraid the mob was gonna kill you.
I just thought I was safer in here.
that's why I couldn't talk.
Yes, which is precisely why you need to talk now.
no. It was easy for you to find me.
it'll be easy for them, too.
tell me what happened.
andrew and I were outside of his gym.
now, you know what I want to do tonight?
what's that?
I want to go see a movie.
I didn't see him, but he saw us.
I think Andrew knew him.
why do you say that?
Andrew's reaction.
he wasn't surprised.
and then they shared this look.
like they recognized each other.
and then Andrew pulled me away.
Andrew, what the hell are you doing?
sorry, but you saw.
that body. I - I won't say anything, I swear.
you don't have to do this. I got no choice!
shut up!
I love you. Please.
get as far away as you can.
don't let them see you.
I'm dead if they see you.
which is why you attempted to leave town.
I went back to my place to grab some things.
I thought I was careful, but someone must have seen me.
it's my fault.
he couldn't kill me, so they killed him.
who's that?
he's with the U. S. Marshal Service, Miss Gray and the Witness Protection Program.
he's gonna help you disappear.
these Russians, Lieutenant...
andrew said they'd never give up.
neither do I.
so, this is where Cassandra saw Madden's body dumped?
she said it was outside the Russian's fight club.
I really hope Cassandra's on the level.
Horatio gave her protection.
she's got no reason left to lie.
but still, it seems to lack sense to dispose of a body outside your own establishment.
Russians don't lack sense; they lack fear.
best way to get caught.
it's empty.
it's trash day - it could be in a landfill by now.
or not.
Hey!
Hey, Stop the lift! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
stop this!
stop this.
stop the Dumpster.
looks like Cassandra was telling the truth.
Where's Calleigh?
she went to the marina to notify his wife.
according to the I. D. this is Nathan Madden.
wow, these guys really stop at nothing.
they stab, they bite.
now they beat.
the means don't matter as long as it ends in death.
the means matter to me.
what are you thinking?
they fight bare- fisted in there, which means the killer had his hands all over him.
so with permission, I'm gonna dust the body for prints.
you realize that that's impossible without a fuming chamber, right?
it's like you said - different means, same ends.
anyway, I can't fume him.
he's been out here too long at this point.
if I can get even a whisper of a print to fluoresce...
well, I'll let you get to it.
we found Nathan Madden.
and that is...?
that's the guy whose blood we found all over your club.
you killed Nathan because he wouldn't meet your demands.
you remember.
I have made no demands.
you wanted his million-dollar boat slip for ten grand.
we found your fingerprints all over his body.
this man you mention, Nathan Madden, was he a short man?
I remember him - not a good fighter.
and you're right, there was a lot of blood.
I tried to help him when he fell.
you'll be okay.
you're all right. You'll be okay.
stay with me.
help is on the way.
you helped him into a Dumpster after you beat him to death.
but you know what?
cassandra Gray saw you.
you mean Andrew's girlfriend, yeah.
you know, she's had some problems in the past.
not a reliable witness.
is there someone else who can corroborate this story?
if you didn't kill Nathan, who did?
you remember the man fighting this afternoon?
I talked to him, make sure he turns himself in.
and why would he do that, Ivan?
he trusts me, Lieutenant.
weller just got carried away; he's a good kid.
who would follow your every command, including confessing to murder.
whether you like it or not,
Jason Weller's testimony will exonerate me.
is that the man who killed my husband?
his testimony confirms it.
am I gonna be safe?
you are now.
Mrs. Madden, if you have any problems, you don't hesitate to call me, okay?
thank you, Lieutenant.
thank you, ma'am.
a shame.
he was one of my best.
you trained him well, Ivan.
we live in a world where it's necessary to get results, Lieutenant.
well, then it turns out we share the same philosophy.
what is it you are after?
I'm after you, Ivan, and I'm gonna get you.
and they're off.
number five-- Backdraft-- jumps out in front, followed by the two horse, Snowrider.
Backdraft, go, boy.
fighting hard on the outside is Caesar and Freebie.
break clean.
at the first turn, here comes Snowrider on the rail.
Backdraft, fading fast.
Oh, no, Backdraft.
come on, don't quit on me now.
don't quit.
there you go.
comes Backdraft, tchi fire, mang h move.
it Swrid anBadrafin the homestretch. Come on, come on. der, raft. Badraft, Snowrider.
and it's Snowrider at the wire.
did we get an ID yet?
Yeah. We've got a Robert Banyon.
big-time horse owner.
took a shot to the back of the head.
my guess is, the shot didn't kill him right away.
his heart continued to beat and he bled out.
okay, who found him?
a couple on their way to another suite, looked in, saw the body.
I notice the entrance wound.
but no exit.
which means the slug is still lodged in his skull.
I need the round.
well, you'll have it as soon as I do.
there must be 10, 000 people out there, Horatio.
and one of them is my killer.
everyone remain seated until you're processed by an officer.
so what have we got besides a killer view?
a man shot in his own luxury suite.
any witnesses?
doesn't appear that way. I think he was here alone.
all right, let's see what our shooter left for us.
so, what happened to you last night?
thought you were coming by Brennan's. We had a table in the back.
Oh, I just-- I went home, did some e-mails, went to sleep.
I was tired. I'm sorry.
no, no reason to apologize.
missed out on a good time, that's all.
looks like the victim dropped a pair of binoculars on the floor.
it's a combination binocular-digital camera.
maybe Banyon was killed over something he saw.
Yeah, maybe he took a picture of it.
I'll get them to A. V.
well, he sure liked fine wine.
also, this food looks like it could have been prepared at the track, except for this.
what's that?
they're Grandine Truffles.
they are delicious, they are my favorite, and...
because of that, I happen to know you can't even get them in Miami.
what does that get us?
a place to start.
Horatio. - Yes, ma'am.
I got something off the truffles that Calleigh found.
what did we get?
well, they're distributed by a company out of Chicago owned by a guy named Wayne Tully.
what do we know about him?
he happens to be in the horse racing business as well, and his corporatoffice says he's here in Miami.
and we're off.
it's a tough game, the horses.
turns out that you have a number of businesses.
we found a specialty item distributed by your company in Robert Banyon's luxury suite this morning.
so, the man has good taste.
Yeah, but I'm willing to bet that if we took your DNA, we could place you in that suite as well.
DNA on one of the wine glasses.
okay, I was there.
why is that?
little thing I call business.
man's a fan of my truffles.
um, I thought I'd scratch his itch and make my pitch.
which was?
shares in his stable.
even a filet of the breeding rights on a horse like Backdraft, we're talking big race fees, stud prices, claims on offspring for years.
it's a gravy train, it's a easy street.
so what do you say? I'm offering you twice what those shares are worth.
you see Backdraft down there?
practically stole him.
what makes you think I'm gonna let you steal him from me?
times like these, having a partner is never a bad idea.
I don't have "times like these.
get out of here, Tully.
and when he turned down easy street, you shared your disappointment.
you got anything to back that up?
we called the airport.
they said that you checked a nine-millimeter Beretta on your flight yesterday to Miami.
I want to protect myself. Something wrong with that?
I need the gun.
you ever stop to think that maybe I have enemies?
I guarantee you do.
Hey, what are you doing?
me? Uh, Just looking around.
Yeah, well, you're coming with me.
who do we have here, Frank?
this guy's a stooper. His name's Scott Aguilar.
caught him sniffing around the track with one of these things.
I was just looking for stuff, sir, that's all.
Yeah, that's why they call them stoopers
stooped over all day looking for dropped tickets.
people sometimes don't pay attention, they'll, you know, throw out their winners.
you're interfering with a murder investigation.
murder investigation?
I assu you, sir, that was not my intent.
well, I'll tell you what my intent is-- for you to get your bottom-feeding butt elsewhere. Let's go.
lieutenant Caine, this boy appears to be lost, and I found this in his pocket.
it's got CSI Wolfe's name and number.
thank you, Officer.
what's your name, son?
okay, Billy. How do younow Ryan Wolfe?
he's a friend of my dad's.
where is your dad now?
he was supposed to pick me up at swimming ssons.
he never did.
so you're here alone?
well, my dad's a vet here at the track and he's usually here, but I can't find him.
okay. Okay, how about if we find him, okay? Come on. Come on.
Freeze!
is that your dad's car? - Yep.
stay here.
what was that?
stay in the car.
get up.
hang on a seco. You're Russian mob.
you work for Ivan Sarnoff?
Horatio, this is Billy's father.
his name is Mark Gantry.
mark, this is Lieutenant Horatio Caine.
mark helped me out when I had the little gambling problem.
why does his son have your business card?
mark was having a little bit of trouble.
and I'm, uh, helping him look after his kid Billy.
Where's my son?
your son is in good hands.
I want my boy back.
I don't think that's a good idea, Mr. Gantry. Mr. Wolfe, please.
I'm going to call you. Hang in there, okay?
Mr. Wolfe, the dead man has a tattoo from the Russian mob. Why is that?
I have no idea. You know Mark's not involved in that.
okay, that's not my question, is it?
look, he called me. He said he was in trouble.
I came over, there's a guy in his house.
I don't know what's going on.
you'd better find out.
so, you got a bullet for me yet?
Nope, and I didn't see one in the fluoroscope, either.
but there's no exit wound.
unless the entrance is the exit.
what do you mean?
well, I'm not positive.
but let's take a closer look.
powder burns? - No.
you're looking at the damage caused by a captive bolt gun.
used to put down livestock.
Yeah, those are brutal.
it's a one-centimeter wide cylinder that bores a whole into your head.
and as it retracts, conduits on the pistol force out compressed air.
that explains the dark circle, right? - Yeah.
captive bolts are supposed to destroy a horse's brain stem, so the heart keeps beating.
Hey, that's just like our victim.
a bolt gun on a human being?
as if it isn't bad enough to use it on animals.
Yeah, Robert Banyon was a horse owner.
maybe someone didn't like the way he treated his animals.
excuse me. We're looking for Robert Banyon's trainer.
I work for him. I'm the Head Groom. Terrance Chase. And you are?
I'm going to need you to stop right there, freeze.
the horse is spooked. Its ears are back. I guess we're making him uncomfortable.
all right, well this isn't about the horse.
we're here to ask you a few questions abt Robert Banyon.
okay, I groom his horses, I hear things.
you hear that he was murdered this morning?
are you serious?
we are.
he was killed with a captive bold gun, and we know that you use those in your line of work.
not by me. I think those things are barbaric.
I'm going to take a look around.
don't worry-- I won't spook the horses.
so, uh, you know your horses.
Yeah, I grew up around them.
I also know enough to know that grooms and owners don't always get along.
Yeah. Yeah, you'd be right about that.
but, uh, you know, Banyon treated horses right.
and I'd never jeopardize that relationship.
I can't believe this happened.
did Robert Banyon have any enemies that you know of?
in his side of this business, almost impossible not to.
which is why I stick with horses.
you know, their trust is implicit.
well, I wish the same could be said for you.
looks like our murder weapon.
I've never seen that before. I swear.
tell you what. We'll let evidence be the judge of that.
in the meantime, you're coming with us.
these are the photos from Banyon's binocular camera.
hoping he caught a reflection of his killer in the glass.
but you haven't found any yet.
Banyon had a lens filter. Prevents glare and reflections.
that could explain why he didn't see the killer coming.
and why we can't now.
Hey, Jane, do me a favor. Go back and zoom in on the jockey.
she's holding something in her hand. Some kind of plastic box.
it's called a "jigger." It's an electric prod.
it's used to make the horse go faster. It's illegal.
okay, so we don't know who killed Robert Banyon.
but we may have just found out why.
Yeah.
why don't you dismount. We need to ask you a few questions.
Yeah.
it's our understanding that your road twice today, and your second mount was Backdraft for Robert Banyon. Is that true?
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
it's terrible what happened to Mr. Banyon.
Yeah, we think so, too.
we also think you conspired to kill him.
what? - We've reviewed the tape.
and we know that you intentionally eased up on your horse during the race, andhen you spurred him on at the end for a comeback.
that's right. You made sure Banyon never took his eyes off the race.
this way, a killer could step in and put a gun to his head.
you can't possibly prove that.
actually, we can. We have photos of you using a jigger.
okay. Okay, I used the device.
but it wasn't about murder. It was about winning.
why don't you explain that.
look, Backdraft is lightning out of the gate.
but today he was off. Sluggish.
it was like I didn't have my horse under me.
I had to get him going.
you risked your career for that?
careers can be made in a race like today's.
or ended. - No.
no, don't do this. It was just one time.
I can't lose my racing license. Please.
it's too late. We're going to take you in.
so, what have you got on my friend Mark Gantry?
still working on it, but you can take his personal effects.
okay.
it's a racing program.
Yeah, found it in his pocket.
same track where Robert Banyon was murdered this morning.
what else you got?
here, we also found a powdery substance in his pants.
Benzoylmethyl ecgonine.
more popularly known as... - Cocaine.
bit of a surprise.
more than you'll ever know.
you're lying to me!
no, man, I swear. - After what I did for your son, after what I do for you?
you were my sponsor.
and now I found a racing program in your pocket.
okay, uh...
I found cocaine on your clothes.
you're using again?
no. No, look, Ryan-- so yeah, look, I've been using a little, okay, but...
you got it under control?
spoken like a true addict.
that man who attacked me today, he's a member of the Russian mob.
do you know what that means?
what, is he your dealer? You owe him money?
Yep. He came to collect. I didn't have the cash, okay.
I didn't know what else to do, who else to turn to.
you dragged me into a drug deal?
Freeze!
I'm sorry. I-I screwed up. All right?
I'll, I'll deal with this. All right?
I just need a little time.
no, Mark. Now I have to deal with it.
you want to help yr son?
you help yourself.
be sure to get tse to Prints, okay?
go. Right away, please.
his personal effects.
I ran our Russian mobster's prints through AFIS, and I didn't get anything.
what about the watch, Mr. Wolfe? Take a look at that.
it's running 11 hours ahead.
11 hours ahead is Russian time.
you know, if he just arrived, his prints would probably be in the immigration databases.
I'll check.
nicholas Brinks. He just stepped off a plane from Moscow last week.
see who sponsored his visa.
it's our old friend, Ivan Sarnoff.
owner of the Aegis Boxing Club.
and a killer.
a month ago, you promised we'd reunite.
what is it this time, Lieutenant?
what about him?
he killed himself today.
what does that have to do with me?
you provided Nicholas with entry into the country, didn't you?
perhaps I did.
and Nicholas killed himself to avoid being questioned.
why did he do that, Ivan?
you'd have to ask him.
but that's out of the question now, isn't it?
I'm asking you.
lieutenant Caine, pity.
in another life, we would be great comrades.
I think that Nicholas killed himself to protect you, Ivan.
he was a loyal friend, Lieutenant, and you know I have a lot of friends.
and you're gonna need every one of them.
Eric Delko, in my Trace lab?
Yeah, I'm working on the Banyon case.
I found some unusual fibers on the towel the murder weapon was wrapped in.
recycled jelly cable, silica and polyopylene fibers, coated in a microcrystalline wax.
never seen it before.
certainly not common. At least not in the States.
you recognize it?
Yeah, what you're looking at is Polytrack.
it's developed in England. It's used to replace dirt at horse tracks.
Why?
it's cleaner.
drains faster, and it's more animal-friendly than dirt.
so, you know your horses, huh?
well, every Englishman worth his salt has done his time at the Derby.
uh, what does it mean when a horse puts its ears back?
it means the filly doesn't fancy you.
so this Polytrack, uh-- it's everywhere?
not exactly.
I think only five tracks in the U. S.have made the changeover.
not one of them is in Miami.
how about Chicago?
you know what they say about animal instinct?
I'm afraid I don't have time to talk.
make time.
the bolt pistol that killed Robert Banyon was wrapped in a towel that had traces of Polytrack on it.
that synthetic track stuff? What's that got to do with me?
just happens to be the new ground cover at Tallulah Field in Chicago, where you base your operations.
and you own a bolt pistol, don't you?
I do.
unfortunately, I had to put a horse down yesterday.
stay where you are.
wait a minute. It's gone.
big shock.
no, no, no, no, no. I know what's going on here. I want a lawyer.
I don't blame you. Officer.
betting slip.
first race. $1, 000 on the number four horse.
Banyon's horse didn't run that race.
no. We need to take a closer look at this ticket.
I thought you might want to see the tox report on your friend Mark Gantry.
there's no trace of cocaine in his system.
no. He's clean.
that doesn't make sense.
addicts lie to cover their using, not to, uh...
not to invent it.
why would he do that?
this may not be what you want to hear, but in my opinion,
I think he's covering up for a bigger lie.
mark is the track veterinarian, isn't he?
Yeah. So?
well, you know how they said that Robert Banyon's horse all of a sudden started lagging?
they sometimes use cocaine to dope horses.
lagging?
last time I checked, cocaine was a stimulant.
cocaine is a stimulant in a human being, but the right dose in a horse will cause the heart rate to decrease, the respiratory system to increase.
it causes them to over breathe.
slows them down.
so he was dosing the horses, and not using the drugs on himself?
he's race fixing.
he's gambling again.
I don't know what to do.
let me check into it.
Hey, look, I've just been released from custody.
you know, I talked and talked to you guys. I did not do this thing.
I know you didn't, Mr. Chase.
Oh, Terrance, please.
I actually came to see Backdraft.
we're thinking that he may have been doped with cocaine.
doped? Really?
who'd do something like that to you, Backdraft?
and, you know, my question is how?
well, that part's easy. Horses are vascular.
you know, you rub the drug right on their skin. It absorbs into the bloodstream.
in the first turn, here comes Snowrider on the rail.
Backdraft fading fast.
you know, it looks like he could have been dosed under his bridle.
Yeah, sweat opens the pores. Ingestion's immediate.
Hey, easy.
it's positive. Cocaine.
poor baby. What's gonna happen to him?
he'll probably be sold off.
Oh, if he's lucky, put out to, uh, stud.
are you interested in taking a ride?
Oh, I can't. I'm on duty, but, uh...
but I may take you up on that some time.
please do.
okay, Terrance.
we just got a call from CSI Duquesne.
we've confirmed the presence of cocaine on Backdraft.
we know everything. We know you tried to fix the race.
the only way you're gonna help yourself is come clean, all right?
sarnoff shows up one day out of nowhere.
starts bringing up long-shot bets I made, like, three years ago, before I even entered the program.
are you sure that they were yours?
Yeah. My... My bookie drops dead one day.
and three years later, there's Sarnoff.
he's got my name in that black book of his that he keeps in his coat.
starts pressuring me.
threatening me, threatening my son.
and you couldn't pay.
told me if I dusted Robert Banyon's horse, I'd be in the clear.
you thought I'd forget?
this debt would just float away on the breeze?
no. No, of course not.
you owe me.
I need that money. All of it.
but I'll give you some time.
time's up.
I don't have it.
okay. Then you do something for me.
you do it right, we call it even. Yeah?
so, I couldn't bring myself to do it to that beautiful animal.
and now he won't rest until I pay, one way or the other.
all right, listen, Mark, you and Billy are gonna get out of here. All right?
you got to disappear. You got to start over.
he'll find us wherever we go.
not necessarily.
betting stub from the horse track?
Yeah, this is the one they found in Wayne Tully's horse trailer, where the murder weapon went missing.
you gonna turn it into a winning ticket?
Yeah, if you consider beer and mustard a big case breaker.
there's no usable trace.
what about that circle across the top?
I don't know what that is.
maybe some sort of code from the betting windows?
the shapes are more imprint than they are laser print, don't you think?
Yeah. You got a theory?
found a track rat today. You know, "stooper.
he had one of those claw grabbers.
what was he doing with it?
well, he was looking in the trash for betting slips, and I'm willing to bet that's one of them.
and how does this have anything to do with a missing bolt gun?
did you steal one from Wayne Tully's trailer?
Oh, no, no, ma'am.
you would never catch me using that tool to put down an animal.
what about putting down a human being?
we did some checking, Scott.
we know that you're the original owner of Backdraft.
Yeah. Yeah, I owned Backdraft.
we're gonna need to check your hands.
what is it you're doing?
testing for nitrites.
by-product of gunpowder being burned.
you through?
you are through.
what are you talking about?
it's positive for nitrites.
that means there's a presence of gunshot residue on your hand.
you shot him with the bolt gun, didn't you?
you put Banyon down.
that horse was one in a million.
he was a pure thoroughbred.
he was raw talent.
perfect stride.
perfect balance.
and he's got heart.
just nded the proper training, that's all.
a little seasoning, support.
and then, Banyon shows up, and...
well, he convinced me that Backdraft was flawed.
this horse, I ran his stats. He's too narrow up front.
don't know if it will take the stress of training, much less racing.
sir, that horse has great breeding.
he'll never win a race.
look, I need a trotter pony.
I'll take him off your hands, do you a favor-- five grand.
three cup victories and eight figures later...
look...
I was a jockey that never finished in the money. Okay?
I scraped together whatever money I hato buy Backdraft.
he was my ticket out, and Banyon lied to me.
he told me that he was worthless.
and then he stole him from me.
he knew he was a winner all along.
and he was mine.
just because Banyon was a dirty businessman, that doesn't give you the right to kill him.
that's easy for you to say.
every time that horse took first place...
the feeling got worse.
all the horse owners keep a bolt gun.
first unlocked trailer I found, I took one.
there you go.
come on, come on.
if I wasn't gonna get a share of the winnings, well, neither was he.
you didn't just lose your horseScott.
you lost everything.
you must be insane coming here.
I knew you'd be looking for me. I figured I'd save you the time.
you caused me a great deal of trouble.
look, Mr. Sarnoff, I'm here to make it right. I swear.
you think I'm a fool?
some game to be played?
I just need this to be over. I need my life back.
your life.
I could kill you right here, right now.
if you want to kill me, you go ahe, but I'm through running.
but if you let me live, I can help you.
I took care of the other race myself.
why do I need you?
tell me your offer.
I'll give you one more race, a big one.
I dose your horse. I take care of any post-race dope test.
I get you your money.
and then, my debt is finished.
we're no longer talking about just one race.
how many?
all the races. I own you.
you want to live? You make me a winner.
race after race af...
so, Ivan...
I guess that makes this post time, huh?
this is a setup.
this will never stand.
Yes, it will.
Oh, Ivan, third race, five horse.
it's a guaranteed loser, huh?
it's all here, H.
s every date, every horse, every race.
God, Ivan, you've made millions.
bribery, extortion, conspiracy to race fix...
my guess is that's, um... 30 years.
that's a big number, Ivan.
and this time, there's no one to take the fall. Book him.
seeing me off?
I guess that's a fair description.
you're bringing a world of hurt on yourself. On your city.
on those close to you.
go on.
it's started. You don't even know it.
your team is falling apart. You even know where they are. I do.
trouble is coming, Lieutenant.
and it's looking for you.
all right, Billy.
I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?
no, you won't.
so, you won't be able to play your guitar for a while,
but you'll have your thumb for your video games, okay?
okay.
I hope you're here to take me to breakfast.
actually, just got one seeing Dr. Jacobs.
so...
I'm good.
Yeah, I'm great, even.
no residual brain damage from the surgery.
and I can start back toork immediately.
that's so wonderful, honey.
I'm so happy for you.
so, why aren't you?
no, I'm good.
how long have we known each other, Eric?
what, eight, nine years.
long enough for you to know better than to lie to me.
you ever regret leaving pd?
Dr. Woods!
I got to go, babe.
all right.
okay, what do we have?
24-year-old woman in shock blood pressure 70/45. Tachy at 140. Breathg rapid.
her name's Lauren.
boyfriend here founder unconscious.
okay.
on my count.
get a monitor on her. I need O2 sat.
okay, she's going into respiratory failure.
what-what does that mean?
she's not getting enough oxygen. We need to intubate.
respiratory failure.
what's your name?
Ethan, how long has Lauren been out?
I-I don't know. She-She sounded wed.
that's why I rushed over to her place.
start positive pressure ventilation at 100% oxygen.
can you be more specific?
She-she was mumbling her words.
She-she said her head hurt.
pupils areixed and dilated.
no corneal reflex.
sounds like a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
I'll do a spinal tap.
has lauren been ill?
Ethan, has Lauren been sick?
Yeah, the flu. Is this the swine thing?
no, this isn't the flu.
doctor, please...
cardiac arrest.
what is with th girl?
she's in systole.
okay.
EPI. I'm starting chest compressions.
Eric, please, get him out of here.
come on, Ethan.
here we go, sweetheart.
let's go. It's gonna be okay, all right?
Just...got to give 'em some space.
still no rhythm, Alexx.
get those paddles ready.
another dose of bicarb.
defib doesn't work on asystole.
could be fine v-Fib.
charge to 300.
no-- 360.
clear.
anyone you want me to call?
Yeah, my mom and dad.
I got-Got their number on my cell phone.
sure.
you're going to propose.
Yeah.
I'll just wait until she gets better, you know.
she, uh-- She likes ice cream after she's sick, so i'm just gotta slip it in the dish.
that's cool.
Yeah.
she looked a lot better yesterday, so I figure maybe today's the day.
I'm sure she going to be okay.
you said she was going to be okay.
Hey, man...
alexx, what happened?
I need you to get Horatio down here, please.
Why?
cause that girl was murdered.
and in my expeence, you may have your number one suspect right here.
technically, Lauren died from acute renal failure.
when the kidneys went, the other organs followed.
if she'd only come in aay earlier.
Horatio, the last time I saw something like this,
it was back in the morgue on a homicide case.
so, you're thinking she was poised.
in my opinion yes.
boyfriend.
he said she looked a lot better yesterday, was actual going to propose to her.
well, either he's blind or lying, because that girl hasn't had a od day in a week.
son of a bitch.
he had me fooled.
had an engagement ring and everything, I mean...
probably rehearsed the whole thing.
okay, we don't have all the information yet, Eric.
Yeah, I know, but...
was acting strange.
wouldn't talk me in the eye, didn't fully answer my questions.
let's keep him here while I process the house, all right?
I'll send over her blood and issue samples to the crime lab.
thank you, Alexx.
Eric, stay with him.
poison that can be absorbed by touch.
man, that's diabolical.
I don't get it.
nothing's lighting up.
Yeah, I'm flatlining on these tox screens, too.
that's the problem with poison-- The only way to find it is to take shots in the dark.
but I have tested her apartment for every poison I can think of.
boyfriend might have slipped it in somewhere else.
maybe.
so, you would bring food to lauren when you went to check in on her?
are you kidding?
she was sick. Like, coming out of both end sick.
I mean, she could barely hold down water.
when did she start feeling ill?
a week ago.
Mmm, we went out to eat.
and, uh, when we got home, she started saying her stomach hurt.
Where'd you go out to eat?
I-I don't-- I don't remember.
what do you mean you don't remember?
you ate there, right?
I don't remember.
look, deal was, that don she'd pick and i'd pay, right?
I might have the receipt in my back pocket.
was Lauren going to leave you?
what? No.
what do you think the ring's for?
I don't know. Maybe this was your way of keeping her from running.
wh-why are you asking me these questions?
because Lauren wasn't sick, Ethan.
she was poisoned.
which means that someone had to poison her.
and you're number one on the list.
why would I kill Lauren?
you know, I've qestioned a lot of guilty people before,
and they've all got one thing in common.
it's a bade of nerves.
right now you're sweating like someone that's got something to hide.
I didn't kill her.
that was just as good a confession, you idiot.
Hey, I need Alexx woods in here, right now!
why would the suspect poison his girlfriend and then himself?
well, he wouldn't, unless he pulled a Romeo and Juliet.
Yeah, but he was just getting ready to propose to her.
exactly.
the last thing they did before Lauren got sick was go out to eat, so I raa food-borne illness tox.
this is what I got.
Lauren tested potive for E coli.
okay, so then she wasn't poisoned?
e coli is poison.
we checked with Alexx. She confirmed it.
and based on how quickly this killed Lauren and put her boyfriend on life support,
a lexx believes this is a new and very deadly strain.
and alexx was concerned that the health agencies were moving too slow.
well, I can understand why.
so, we must find the source before another outbreak occurs.
look, I don't want to be that guy, but is this anywhere near the corner of our jurisdiction?
we must investigate every death.
e coli doesn't just appear.
someone allowed this to happen.
someone allowed her to die. That's negligent homide.
e coli can only be ingested.
so, the first step is to find where the infected food came from.
ms. Boavista, we need a a fingerprint to track the strain.
I'll go pull in Valera.
I'll grab Walter and Jesse; we'll, uh, read up on e coli.
then Eric and I will go to the restaurant where they ate.
now, listen.
we treat this as we would any other murder, okay?
right.
welcome back.
Thanks.
so, how do you want to find the restaurant?
I've got an idea.
kiss my ass, lady.
can't you see me a little busy right now?
Where's my ten top, Lucy?
I'm waiting on the potatoes.
are you brain dead?
look, if you don't want to talk to me about our victim's last meal, that's fine.
I'm sure the 5: 00 news would love to.
Really? - Yes.
that's how you wanna do this? - Yeah.
okay.
you see this?
means I run a clean store.
your victim got it somewhere else.
great, let's prove it.
Lauren had a vegetarian chopped salad last sunday.
so, let's run your produce.
can't. After a day, we pitch it.
come here.
let me educate you here.
e coli doesn't come from the kitchen.
it came from yours.
it was delivered that way.
you wanna know where E coli starts?
the grower.
who's your grower?
aunt sally's farm out in sweetwater okay?
listen, I need you to make a trip to sweetwater.
okay, boys, how are we gonna pull this one off?
we don't have the authority.
and I don't feel a warrant in my pocket.
Walter, we have badges.
okay.
can I help you?
Yeah, we're, uh, we're looking for aunt Sally.
uh, sorry to disappoint, but there is no Sally.
pr folks thought Sally sounded better than uncle Seth.
I'm Seth Eers.
we'd like to run a few tests on your farm to see if it's the source.
is that right?
Yeah.
can I see some ID?
Yes, sure.
you feds?
no, sir.
well, you're not ag inspectors.
no, we're csis from md.
we're, uh, actually treating this as a homicide investigation.
then you'll show me your warrant.
I see.
then I' afraid you're going have to leave the property.
looks to me like these rural guys know how to read their constitution.
Yes, they do.
what's he doing?
you don't have the authority to be here.
if I tell you to leave, you have to clear out.
not if I have probable cause.
cause for what?
Oh, can I see your emoyees' green cards?
they don't have their cards then I do have the authority to shut you down.
fine.
look around for your E coli.
saddle up!
I've got each of the crops batched together.
they're rows-- Soil, stalk and leaf.
okay, now what do I do?
hit the result window on the cards with the uv light.
if it glows, then the area the sample was taken from is positive for e coli.
I thought you read this book.
a lot of information.
you're getting all negatives.
have we checked all the fields?
Yeah, this test isn't that difficult.
I don't understand.
I do.
e coli didn't come from this farm.
we're missing something.
aunt Sally's is the only grower that ships to the restaurant.
where else could the E coli have come from?
e coli is carried on the exterior of the plant, right?
maybe it came in contact with the bacteria after it left the farm, like a processing plant.
but they ship direct by local truck.
Yeah, if the truck was infected, the shipment would've been infected, too.
who delivers to that restaurant?
let's find out.
well, there's the truck.
where is mr. Wayons?
only one way to find out.
get your butt up!
turn around.
why were you running, superfly?
then we got a paradox, 'cause i didn't start chasing until you started running.
look, where I'm from, cop calls your name, you run and ask questions after.
Mr. Wayons, you mind if I look in your truck?
be my guest.
you deliver produce from Sally's farm?
don't have to say.
Hey, frank, bingo.
Mr. Wayons, you have E coli in this truck.
that is responsible for the death of a 22-Year-Old girl.
look, I only pick up and drop off.
Hey, if the produce is dirty when I get them, it's not my fault.
well, we tested the farm, and we got a negative.
that means your truck is ground zero.
if I got bugs, they came from Sally's.
sometimes they don't show up in these tests out in the field.
ask around.
when they get in the heat of a truck, that's when they start growing.
why don't you use refrigeration.
they don't pay me enough for that.
who's "they"?
Seth Ellers?
if I yak, I lose this gig.
then what do I tell my wife?
well, look, Ellers, all those farmers, they're just like me.
we all work for someone else.
I pulled the corporate fings on aunt Sally's farms.
it's a subsidiary of bixton ganic food.
that driver was right.
Yeah, half the world works for bixton.
Yeah, they're into food produce and pharmaceuticals.
do let me tell you, none of it's really organic.
most people don't look past the name of the company.
no, guys, I meant the trucker; he was right.
just because our tests weren't positive, doesn't mean that farm's clean.
we tested all the crops.
but we didn't test what goes on them.
e colis primarily spread through fecal material.
well, I didn't see anything in the fields.
there was port-A-Johns for the workers.
how else could the feces get on the crops?
??
water.
has anyone checked the irrigation system?
uncle Seth will never let us back on that farm.
we go over their head.
you can have a seat.
thank you.
lieutenant Cne, I'm Sheldon Parks, legal counsel for Bixton organ foods.
this is Jerry Mackey, CEO.
I'm glad we could accommodate you.
I've asked Mr. Mackey not to speak during the interview.
I'll be representing the company today.
and I'll be recording our conversation for legal purposes.
indeed, gentlemen, let me cut to the chase.
we found a strain of E coli that killed a young woman.
that strain was traced back to one of your trucks.
just to be clear, you are referring to Mr. Wayons' truck?
I am.
Mr. Wayons is an independent contractor.
if you review Mr. Wayons' contract-- I'm providing lieutenant caine with a copy?
bixton organic is not liable for any negligence on his part.
that is simply not true.
the same E coli originated on a farm owned by your client.
we're aware of the testing you performed without permission or warrant.
we're also aware that you didn't find anything.
isn't that correct, lieutenant?
for the record, lieutenant Caine did not disagree.
I need to test your irrigation system.
and I am certain Bixton's gonna help me 'cause they don't want any other deaths.
we're not responsible for any far.
but Mr. Mackey has heard your concerns,
he wants you to know that he's asked the health department to perform a study.
when is that going to take place?
when they can.
I think we're done here, then.
and lieutenant, you are familiar with the veggie libel laws?
florida has laws against the disparagement of agricultural products.
so I would advise you to keep these accusations to yourself.
it's been a pleasure.
I take it that didn't go very well.
we need toet back to that farm, jesse.
before they cover this up.
you guys do know that this is an illegal search and seizure, right?
anything we find on th farm is gonna get tossed.
doesn't matter. We're not going to the S. A.S office.
Yeah, Horatio wants to go straight to the health departnt.
they'll have to act.
all right...
so, how we do this?
okay, we need to test each puddle out there.
so start at the sprinklers and work your way back until you find a well.
Yeah, and one more thing... - What?
don't get caught.
Yeah, Walter, I found the well.
you get out of here! - Put the gun down!
you put yours down! - Put the gun down!
I told you Bixton suits, if I saw you on my land again, I'd shoot!
MDPD.
bixton didn't send you? - No.
what's your name?
Mr. Webb, I need you to put the gun down, you understand me?
you don't work for bixton?
doesn't mean they aren't trying.
to buy you out?
buy? Hell, they're getting us for free.
they already grabbed my grandfather's first 40.
well, how's that?
I've said enough.
you're a cop.
is it the disparagement laws?
you ever heard of drifter？
no.
well, I got caught in it.
bixton's patented seeds blew into my crops.
I didn't know you could patent a seed.
neither did I.
an inspector found a few of their seeds mixed up with mine.
and they accused you of stealing and sued.
couldn't afford the lawyer, so I settled.
had to pay with land.
that's how Seth lost aunt Sally's to them.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Yeah.
you guys find the source of the bug?
Yeah, take a look.
check it out.
how many cards did you put down there?
Walter spilled the bag.
I told you not to set it up there.
the water from that well-- Used for irrigation.
so, Bixton's contaminating their own fields.
that should shut them down for a while.
hate to break, but this isn't the source.
we still got to figure out how the feces are getting into theater.
speaking of which, I think I stepped in some.
where?
over there.
Oh, man. Yeah.
you think it's coming from the well?
no, I think it's underground seepage.
Yeah.
it could be runoff from the hill.
Oh, looks like we found what killed Lauren.
this is a bixton foods outfit?
Yes, that's the cattle yard and the crop where the poisoning occurred.
I just became head of the health department. I haven't seen anything this bad.
yeah I mean, I always thought that corn-Fed beef was a good thing.
that's what Bixton wants you to think.
it also causes E coli, doesn't it?
that's what the research suggests.
Yeah, you know, a cow's digestive system is not designed for corn, so the acid builds up.
that creates a breeding ground for the e coli.
that's good.
it's another violation we can use to shu them down.
Oh, excuse me.
not really,'cause it's not against the law.
doctor?
no, it's just how they do things nowadays.
it also proves that bixton caused the outbreak.
no, no, no.
I would be very careful how I use that term.
what are you saying, doctor？
how many people does bixton have to kill before you decide to call it an outbreak?
I'm just saying, we shouldn't jump to conclusions.
we will do a proper investigation.
then we'll see what that turns up.
well, what else do you need, doctor？
the DNA fingerprint from the E coli found in the manure.
we want to insure against implicating the wrong parties.
bixton foods is a reputable agricultural company.
so, you're basically saying that disparagement laws are more important than people's lives.
lieutenant, please.
Eric, I think that we should let the doctor get to her lunch with the CEO of Bixton Foods.
what are you suggesting, lieutenant?
it's come to my attention, doctor, that you are the ex-V. P. of a Bixton subsidiary.
now, I am certain that's not going to affect your investigation.
let me tell you something. Anybody else dies while you're conducting your investigation,
I'going to drag you down to the funeral,
so you can explain why your protocol is more important than their kid's life.
I don't appreciate being threatened.
have a good lunch.
I haven't gotten a chance to tell you, but I was so happy you're okay.
I'm really glad you're back.
I wish I felt the same.
I watched that girl die in front of me.
and now the same thing's happening to Ethan.
it's not e coli.
Ethan doesn't have an e coli infection.
what do you mean?
we didn't find any of the bacteria in his blood.
at first I thought his symptoms were the same as Lauren's, but they aren't.
his heart stopped beating because he's in total paralysis.
the only thing keeping him alive is the respirator.
what do you think is causing this?
I don't know.
that's why I brought tissue biopsy and blood.
our lab is too slow.
I'll have Walter run a tox screen.
thank you, Calleigh.
okay, that's an air ball on basic tox.
to get any further, I need to know what I'm looking for.
usually there's a crime scene that gives me clues.
we don't got one of them.
well, it doesn't mean we don't have any clues.
Hey, Eric, what were Ethan's symptoms?
Alexx said he went into total paralysis.
sounds like neurotoxin to me.
blocks the nerves from talking to the muscles.
it starts in the limbs and works its way to the heart.
Yeah, but the bad news is, there's a whole catalog of neurotoxins.
they come in three flavors.
we got manmade poison, venom or bacterial.
well, we've already ruled out man-Made.
I doubt he was bitten by a snake.
so that leaves us with bacteria.
well, then, we're back to something he ate.
okay, this whole thing has centered around bixton's produce,
so, w.what did Ethan order?
according to this receipt, he had a veggie burger and a corn on the cob.
the farmer that pulled the gun on me?
bixton was growing genetically engineered corn on his land.
could the toxin have come from that?
I don't know. Why would someone engine a toxin into their food?
I don't know, but I know how to find out.
Mr. Webb.
the corn bixton's growing on the land they took from you?
is that genetically engineered?
mutants, every one.
is it the same type ey grow on aunt Sally's farm?
I don't follow.
leme have some of that corn.
is she done yet?
no, she hasn't said anything.
Really?!
she done yet?
you guys, i'm working as fast as I can here.
Walter, where are the tox assays?
they're in trays.
so, you know what's killing Ethan?
let me just run a presumptive on his blood first. Okay?
did the toxin come from the corn?
it's from a bacteria gene that bixton added to the corn.
I thought genetic engineering was about mixing a spinach with a cauliflower.
no, no, no, no, that's the dark ages.
nowadays, they frankenstein bacteria with plants.
makes them resistant to aphids and stuff.
what was bixton shooting for?
well, you know how corns hard to digest, right?
Yeah, because of the cellulose.
exactly. Well, bixton's scientists found a bacteria that eats the cellulose, theh clostridium dermacellum. Se.
so, they added one of its genes to the corn's dna sequence,
so that the co would expresses a protein that breaks down that cellulose.
so, they made digestible corn.
exactly, but then they obviously ran into a problem.
have you ever heard of cell conjugation?
Yeah. Bacteria absorbs the traits of their neighbors.
well, the dermacellum's cousin is the clostridium tulinum.
so, bixton's cultures obously had that in them,
because their traits transferred to the bacria they used.
botulinum causes botulism.
wow, so
it kicks out botulism.
not all the time, but in this case, yes.
botulism causes paralysis.
that's what Ethan's suffering from.at
there's an antitoxin for botulism.
I'm gonna go call Alexx.
is there enough to save Ethan's life?
I don't know, but it's enough to bring down bixton.
I can't wait to see the evidence wipe the smile off that ceo's face.
you did some good work today, eric.
but i'm gonna take this one alone.
come on, I'm not gonna lose it again, all right?
Eric, this is your first day.
pace yourself. Okay? - Okay.
all right? All right.
gentlemen.
lieutenant, as before, I've asked Mr. Mackey not to speak.
I'll be representing the company today.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Mackey alone.
Mr. Mackey is entitled to legal representation.
Yes, but there will be no charges filed, so it won't be necessary.
what's this all about?
need some advice on your corn futures?
how much do you think a man's life is worth?
I don't know who that is.
his name is Ethan Dunt.
and your company killed him.
he's brain-Dead, eric.
no antitoxin can fix that.
I'm sorry, I did everything I could.
you think this was from a bixton product?
it's called botulism.
you can't blame Bixton if the poor kid didn't refrigerate his food.
we reverse-Engineered your corn.
and we believe that that... is the smoking gun.
glad to see my tax dollars are buying you guys really nice toys.
so, now what?
like you said, can't press charges.
if you knew, why did you put it out?
the protein for botulism presents less than one percent of the time.
and that's your acceptable risk.
they might get a few lawsuits, but as long as costs don't outweigh profits...
you see, you think farming is ma and pa with a pitchfork.
farming is big business.
you have to take risks.
like your customers.
they take risks, don't they?
they don't know what's in their food.
they don't want to know.
people just want their food.
they don't care where it comes from.
but i know where it comes from.
cattle farms that produce E coli.
and so you know, I've contacted the fda.
and they're going to close the farmown.
you know, you don't know anything, lieutenant.
if we used only natural farming methods, prices would be astronomical.
people would starve.
so, if one man's death means 500 get fed, yes, i'll take those odds.
speaking of which...
how about bixton food versus 12 jurors?
you said you weren't pressing charges.
not criminal charges.
but Ethan's family has enough evidence now to mount a civil suit.
it won't go to trial, lieutenant.
they have a full confession...from the defendant.
so, I guess we'll see you in court.
Hey, Calleigh.
what are you still doing here?
I just need to catch up on some of my cases.
so, I figured out what you're doing.
can't wait to hear where this is going.
you're leaving csi, aren't you?
you always were good at reading me.
look, um, let's not tell anybody else for now.
I don't feel like answering lots of questions.
I wouldn't.
why are you going?
lots of reasons.
life's too short？
Yeah, basically.
and what about you and me?
I guess csi's not the only game in town.
like I said, you know me too well.
I'll always be here, h
Eric, uh, it's H. I'm going to, uh...
I'm gonna be out of commission for a few hours.
I'd appreciate if you'd cover me.
I need to go say hello.
okay. Thank you, brother.
stop! Stop!
what's going on? - There's a lady. She's hurt.
where is she? - She's down the hill.
want to show me? - Yeah.
okay. - Where?
I think she's pregnant.
where is she? - This way.
I was out running. I didn't have my phone.
she's down here.
this is Horatio Caine. I'm at Robin Hill and Seventh.
I need an ambulance immediately.
did you see what happened?
okay.
all right... Let me look at you. Okay. Okay, okay.
hang in there. I called for the ambulance.
okay, okay.
just lie still.
why are you making that face?
me, throw your baby shower?
I would consider it an honor.
did you ever stop and think what it is for me?
let me educate you. It's a nightmare.
Marcie, you can't be serious.
how can you be so insensitive?
after all I've been through. The three years, the five doctors, all the heartache.
this is just another reminder.
look, I know you've had a difficult time, but-but you have to...
no. Do not go there.
you have no right. Not when this is so easy for you.
look, forget I asked, okay?
I'll figure something else out.
you clearly cannot think of anything but yourself.
Really? You're going to say that to me?
when all we talk about is your baby, your husband, your precious Mercedes.
you cannot deal with my happiness.
there's to your crummy happiness.
I'm out of here.
everybody, clear the hallway, watch your backs.
patient coming through.
tell me the last set of vitals.
Heather, you're at the hospital now. We're gonna take good care of you.
hang in there. Hang in there.
28-year-old female found by the side of the road, unknown history.
she's pregnant.
one, two, three.
mom's BP, 150/100. She's tachy at 125.
I've got major abdominal bruising.
the baby? What about the baby?
any fetal heart rate?
the baby's at 109 with poor variability, late decels.
baby's moving.
she's contracting again.
six milligrams dexamethasone IV.
we have to stop the contractions.
you hang in there, Mom.
H, I got your text; what's going on?
I got a woman, brutally assaulted, eight months pregnant.
baby gonna make it? - Too soon to tell.
that falls under "Expectation of Death."
that allows us to investigate before there's a murder. - I want all hands on deck.
I'll get everyone. - They are gonna pay.
that's all we can do now.
we appreciate the help, Doctor. Thank you.
is this the victim's purse?
Yep. Excellent.
check the phone. - Okay. Thanks.
okay, the victim's name is Heather Chapman.
let's put a BOLO out on the vehicle immediately.
got it.
I've got an emergency number in her phone for a Gary Chapman.
so that's probably her husband.
looks like she texted him a few times this morning about a fight that she had with her girlfriend Marcie.
okay, what do we know about Marcie?
okay, Marcie... we've got...
they had brunch this morning at the Blue Marine Cafe.
okay, so we find the girlfriend.
got it.
well, the waiter at the Blue Marine Cafe seemed to think you were fighting.
we had a disagreement. It happens between friends.
your friend's listed in critical condition.
her and her baby?
they might not make it.
and you were the last person to see her before she was assaulted.
so, what was the argument about?
I've been trying to get pregnant for the last three years.
do you have any idea what that's like?
no, of course you don't, because you're men.
it's hell.
thousands of dollars, shots, procedures, in vitro.
and none of it has worked for me.
but Heather got pregnant.
she didn't even have to try.
Gary just looked at her sideways, and wham, bam, bun in the oven.
I hear some serious resentment there.
maybe that's why you put her in the hospital.
no. No! I didn't. I would never.
in fact, I'd like to go over and see her now.
no, no, no, she's in critical condition at the hospital.
I'd say you've done enough for one day.
excuse me. My wife. I really need to find my wife, Heather Chapman.
she just arrived in the unit from the ER.
how's the baby?
she's stable for now.
Heather hasn't regained consciousness yet.
I told you they wouldn't know anything, Dad.
next few hours we'll know more.
Mr. Chapman, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
I'm a CSI with the Miami-Dade Police Department.
I've been staying with Heather.
csi? So it's true my wife was attacked?
what we know is that your wife was assaulted and her car is missing.
this is unbelievable. How does this happen?
we just don't have any details yet.
in broad daylight?
the cops don't protect anybody.
Josh, enough. A little respect, okay?
would you all like to go and see her?
it's right this way. - Thanks.
I'll check on you in a few minutes.
did you get a load of the hyper hormonal friend?
did I.
Yeah, she's all that and then some.
definitely motive.
Yeah.
depends on what kind of evidence we can dig up, though. What do you got?
well, this is where we found her.
okay. - Right in this area.
I just got started a little while ago.
so you're thinking she was assaulted up there and fell down this embankment, landing here?
no, actually I think it all happened in here because we found some blood right there.
on the curb.
see it? - Yep.
same splash angle.
she was definitely on the move, Natalia.
we've got directionality here leading us that way.
across? - Yep, yeah.
hold that car.
more drip cast off.
same splash angle.
well, let's see where she came from.
there's some here on this curb pointed off over that way.
how the hell did she get all the way over here?
she must have stumbled over looking for help.
more drip cast off.
the distribution of each drop is consistent, leading us across the road.
but how are we going to stop traffic?
you're impeding a police investigation!
MDPD! - Oh, come on!
hold this man all day if you need to.
we got some over here, too.
got some right here.
Yep.
look at that. Another one up here.
what's going on here?
we got something going on over here.
big something.
all that directionality is leading us to this pool of blood.
Oh... Yep.
look at that. We've got headlights or taillights or something - all probably from her car.
well, we know she owns a white Mercedes.
Mercedes' taillights are coated in a polycarbonate plastic just like this.
so she was in an accident.
right.
this is the point of impact.
take a step back and look at this.
four fresh burnt rubber tracks forming a perfect rectangle.
from her tires?
so she was completely still when she got hit from behind.
and not one skid mark from the other car.
okay, so somebody targeted her.
I think Heather Chapman got carjacked.
there he is. There he is. Okay.
this is CSI Eric Delko and Lieutenant Horatio Caine.
we have eyes on the Code 22.
I repeat: we have eyes on the Code 22.
we are in pursuit headed west on Coral.
here we go. Here we go.
get out of the way!
we just lost the code 22.
last spotted headed east on Miracle Mile.
this is Tripp. I think I can cut him off.
Frank! You okay?
I'm all right.
just washed this damn thing.
on the ground! Everybody down! Get down, everybody! Down!
everybody down! Now! Get down!
put your hands on your head right now. Right now!
Where's your friend?
you just broke my damn shoulder!
Where'd he go? - You think we're not going to find him?
where did he go? Where is he, huh? What's his name?
I don't know! - Where would he go?
I don't know. I swear.
get that to the lab, please.
who are you, ma'am?
I'm the day manager here.
you recognize the suspects? Have they been in here before?
I don't know.
officer Delko, what do you want to do with this picture?
is that the one the perp threw at me?
Yep. - Okay. Can you get that back to the lab, please?
wait. Is it necessary to take that photo?
Yeah. The suspect handled it.
it might have some fingerprints on it.
why do you ask?
I'm the photographer.
will I get it back? - That's up to you.
Hey, did you hear about Delko?
laid that guy out in the club like an All-Pro linebacker.
Yeah. I heard about that.
Yeah, it's too bad the other guy got through the line.
PD's out combing the area for him right now.
what's going on with the steering wheel here?
looks like the air bag is missing.
you know, it probably deployed when the car was rear-ended.
carjackers - they... they just want to take the car, right? That's what they're after?
Yeah, so they got to get rid of the air bag so they can drive it.
well, if they want to drive off with the car, why do they beat up the driver?
I mean, especially if the driver's pregnant.
doesn't make much sense, does it? - No.
I'm sure she didn't put up much of a fight.
we got to find the guy that got away.
somebody keyed the car.
it's the entire length of the car. - What?
Yeah. The paint near the groove is still flaking.
it's fresh.
so the car was keyed, then got jacked.
then they beat her down and left her on the side of the road for dead.
does that sound plausible?
no.
you're okay.
you're in the hospital.
you're being very well taken care of.
my name is Calleigh.
how's the baby?
they've given you something to slow the contractions.
she's a fighter, just like you.
Where's my husband?
Heather, your husband is helping us.
he's with the police.
do you remember anything, or... do you know why they would have attacked you?
Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
I can't remember anything.
it's okay.
don't worry.
the baby.
it's bad, isn't it?
they don't know yet.
do you pray?
I do.
I quit praying when I was 12.
preteen rebellion, I guess.
I want to pray now.
for the baby, but... I can't remember any prayers.
I know one that my grandmother taught me.
do you want me to say it for you?
please.
it goes... Angels of God...
angels of God...
from Heaven so bright...
from Heaven so bright...
watch over my children...
watch over my children...
and guide them aright.
and guide them aright.
fold your wings round them...
fold your wings round them...
and guard them with love.
and guard them with love.
sing to them softly...
and sing to them softly...
from Heaven above.
you rest.
thank you.
Horatio. - Yeah?
just got a hit off that nine-mil you guys found at the club.
rounds used in an armed robbery.
same armed robbery where there was a loser who was the main suspect named Sam Novak.
take a look at his priors. - Stolen property, grand theft auto.
known associate of Ruben Franco.
who you just brought in with the broken collarbone.
he's on his way right now for medical treatment.
okay. You know what?
let's hold off on that, okay?
Hey, can you hold up for a sec?
why don't you step out of the car?
thought we were going to the hospital.
Yeah, we will eventually. I need you to tell me where your friend is.
look, I don't know. Someplace better than me, right?
do you recognize this picture?
this is the girl and her baby that you left half-dead on the side of the road.
Hey, look, he took off without me. I don't know where he's at, okay?
Oh, really? You're going to be like that?
why don't you come with me?
I got this, Billy. Thanks.
come on. - Where are we going?
where are you taking me? Huh?
what?
shut up!
get in.
you know, Ruben, separate from everything, separate from anything you can put down on paper or maybe even drive off a lot, is the value of a human life.
and at the end of the day, that's all that really matters to me.
I'm saying that if this baby dies, they're going to be finding pieces of you all over Biscayne Bay.
so I ask you, Ruben, where is Sam Novak?
man, you're wasting your time.
Natalia? Close the door.
today... we have no options.
so last chance, Ruben...
where were you taking the car, and where is Sam Novak?
which one?
Oh, God! Okay, okay! I don't know where Novak is, but we were gonna take the car to a chop shop.
where?
we're looking for Sam Novak. Where is he?
say hello to Josh Chapman.
we found him at the chop shop. He's our victim's son.
I'm not her son. Heather is my stepmother.
okay.
Ruben Franco gave you up, Josh. - I don't know who that is.
you work in a chop shop. They steal the cars, and you chop them up.
look, I work on cars. I'm a mechanic.
Oh, really? Your stepmom's Mercedes is carjacked by two guys that you know?
don't you think that's a bit of a coincidence?
you think? - I don't pick the cars.
but it looks like you picked her. Show him, Frank.
we found these photographs on a bench where you work.
same place Franco and his buddy were taking the car to.
no idea where those came from. - Who took 'em? Novak or Franco?
look, a lot of guys come in and out of that shop.
I don't pay any attention.
okay, let me see your keys. Come on.
you see white on that, don't you, Frank?
Mm-hmm. You were angry enough to key Heather's car, huh?
Yeah. I did it yesterday.
it was a dumb thing to do, but I was pissed.
after all this talk about buying me a car, instead, one day Dad's driving off the lot with a brand-new Mercedes for her. Bitch.
let me tell you something, kid - if you're trying to send a message, you're sending it loud and clear.
look, my folks got divorced. Dad stopped paying attention. That's all.
now he's chasing some Norman Rockwell life with Heather and their new baby.
you lie to us, you'll get in big trouble.
I didn't put her in the hospital. You got to believe me.
here's the problem, son- I don't. Take him. - Let's go.
- Lieutenant?
Mr. Chapman? - Right-right here.
Mr. Chapman... - How's my wife?
your wife and baby are holding. I need to talk to you about your son.
my son? - Your son has been linked to a chop shop where we found surveillance photos of your wife.
I believe these men attacked your wife and they're linked to the same shop.
what? Josh is...?
do they look familiar to you?
no, I don't...
I don't recognize either of these men. My son did what?
okay, I need your wife to I. D. them.
if possible. - Absolutely.
okay, follow me. We don't have much time.
I don't know.
you know, you look good in black.
I like you in this. Where's that smile? Come on, let's see it.
sorry, sorry. Hey, I'm sorry, baby.
just - if you can try to remember where this was taken, it would help the police a lot.
I went out a couple days ago, with Marcie.
Yeah. It looks like it was taken in a restaurant.
you probably told me which one in the morning, and...
you weren't paying attention.
I'll work on that.
Sienna Sky?
your favorite. - Yeah.
you are - you're so gorgeous.
one more thing. Just...
one more thing and then we'll let you rest. - Okay.
see these guys?
can you recognize either of them?
are those the men that attacked me?
the police think so.
I don't remember their faces. - Hey, hey, babe, it's okay. Just look.
this one...
that's Marcie's personal trainer. - Marcie's trainer.
I only met him once. He tried to sign me up.
Marcie Westerfield's trainer. - I'm all over it.
just don't go. Okay?
Where's Sam Novak?
I don't know.
look, the fact that my trainer is some sort of criminal is news to me.
I don't even see him anymore. - You sure about that?
we found these surveillance photos in a chop shop.
the same one that Novak was headed to with his buddy after they jacked your friend's car.
somebody was watching Heather two days ago at the Sienna Sky Restaurant where she was sitting across from you.
and we know you made the reservation.
you sure you didn't have her sit in that chair?
look, I don't need this, okay?
my friend is lying in a hospital bed right now with her baby.
that you wish was yours.
I don't deny that I'm envious.
she has the perfect husband, the perfect life, everything.
and me, all I've got is this bloating, the irritability, the empty nursery.
see, I just think it's sort of weird that your trainer also happens to be the guy that attacked her.
maybe I need a lawyer.
well, sir, you see, I get paid to ask questions, because I work for the Miami-Dade Police Department.
that would explain why I'm asking all the questions. Right.
well, thank you very much for your time, too, sir.
you have a nice... Jerk.
who the hell was that? - That's the manager of the Sienna Sky restaurant, who very impolitely told me they have no security cameras in their parking lots.
so, so much for stealing a shot of our photographer.
Yeah.
Eric, you notice this?
the upper right-hand corner of the photograph, there's a thin, white line.
what causes that? The printer?
well, it could be. Those are reproductions.
let me take a look at the originals.
Yeah. They're on the originals, too. Take a look.
I was dusting them for prints, I noticed some imperfections.
see if they match up.
Yeah.
same exact white mark, upper right-hand corner.
Really? Same exact white line.
same thing as the surveillance photos.
you know, I think all these photos were taken by the same camera.
Yeah, well, I'd be willing to bet that they're all from the same photographer, too.
I already told you everything I know. Can I just get my camera back?
what is this about?
zoom in a little. - Oh, there it is- the zigzag.
the what? - Zigzag.
there's a flaw in your camera's sensor.
as a result, every picture you take has a distinct imperfection.
the photos you have on the wall of your clubs
these photos you have of Heather Chapman while you were surveilling her.
care to explain why you photographed our carjacking victim without her knowledge?
Yeah, why were you surveilling her?
I - I used to date this guy, um, Sam Novak.
he paid me to take pictures of this girl.
I figured it was his new girlfriend or something.
I don't know who she was, or what it was all about.
Sam Novak stole her car.
Sam Novak beat this girl so badly that her and her unborn child are in a hospital.
and you covered for him. That makes you an accomplice.
what? No, no, no, no. I... No, I...
you've got to believe me, I didn't have anything to do with this.
it was just a hit-and-run. I didn't know he was going to beat her up.
if you don't tell me where Sam Novak is, and this girl, this girl dies
you're going down for felony murder.
okay. Do it.
go, go, go. - Miami-Dade Police. Get down on the floor.
that looked like it hurt.
I don't know what the hell you think I did, but I didn't do it.
we found these inside.
Oh, yeah. We got an airbag here.
Yes. I'm guessing it's from the Mercedes.
Yeah. You know you're facing two counts of attempted murder here?
two counts of murder? What, are you guys making up charges now?
in your case, we don't have to.
saddle up.
right away.
afternoon. - Afternoon.
is there something wrong, Doctor?
uh, there's some bruising starting to appear. - What does that mean?
could be a possible clotting disorder, like DIC.
can I get a nurse in here, please?
she's hemorrhaging. Now! Nurses, now!
let's get her on her side. I need to get this patient to the O. R. right now.
Heather, stay with me. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.
let's go. Move, move, move!
Yes, I'm outside with number one.
I want to expedite his paperwork immediately and drop him down to holding...
you're going to burn in hell for this! - Hey, easy. Take it easy.
I should have killed you when I had the chance.
No!
what the hell are you doing? Easy, easy!
let it go! Let it go!
let me finish this. Huh? What are you doing?
get him out of here. Get him out of here.
he deserves this after what he did to Heather!
if Heather dies, I don't know what I'm going to do.
this isn't the way, Gary.
and now you have a problem.
take him, Eric. - Come on. Let's go.
Yeah. The abrasion marks line up perfectly.
so it clearly came from Heather's car.
Yeah. This is from where Novak pried it from the steering wheel.
right. They must have stripped it out on their own.
and it did not deploy.
no, but it should have. I mean, Franco hit this car going at least 30 miles an hour.
maybe, maybe it malfunctioned. - Hang on.
look at this. - What do you got?
Eric, somebody sawed off the tilt lever here.
which means the wheel would be locked in place.
the steering wheel's at a weird angle.
the airbag didn't deploy.
someone was definitely trying to make sure the baby got hurt in the collision.
why would a carjacker go to this much trouble?
he wouldn't.
who did this, the son? The jealous best friend?
Oh, no.
come on, talk to me, H. Why the knife?
he never mentioned the baby, Eric.
who? ! who never mentioned the baby? !
Chapman. He never mentioned the baby.
I got it. I got it.
it matches up perfectly.
son of a bitch.
lieutenant, um... I apologize for my behavior. - Have a seat, Gary.
you disabled your wife's airbag, Gary.
and then you locked the steering wheel in place so your child might be killed.
then you hired Novak and Franco to crash into your wife's car.
I didn't hire anyone.
I might have spoken to Vicki, and she said she knew people.
I don't do that sort of thing anymore, Gary. - Right, Vicki, I understand.
but look, we both know you have some old friends who could do this thing for me.
it's just... I'm not sure.
ask around.
tell 'em I'll make it worth their while.
I'll see what I can do, okay?
you tried to eliminate Novak because he was planning to go public on you.
no. Look, I might have started something, but it wasn't supposed to be a carjacking, okay?
and Heather...
was not supposed to be assaulted and left on the road for dead, okay?
how did this happen?!
how could you do this to me?! To Heather?! - I didn't.
this was supposed to be a simple hit-and-run, Vicki.
they beat my wife unconscious! She could die!
you were willing to pay anything to anyone to get this done, and I warned you!
Gary, we believed in you.
anyone could have used this knife, anyone. Novak is your man.
he's sick. He's your criminal.
I believed in you.
lieutenant, I love my wife.
I love her. Everything was perfect with us.
but it was just about to change forever, okay? I was...
why, because of the baby? - Oh, the baby. Wah!
you know what kind of hell a baby brings into a marriage?
it's like a parasite.
why do you think I got divorced the first time around?
my wife- Josh was born- all we did was fight like dogs.
look, you want to have a romance with a baby instead of me? Get out!
and Heather was perfect.
Heather was always happy.
and then, and then she gets pregnant. And I could see it.
I could feel it happening again.
no.
no, I wasn't gonna lose her.
you know, this really could be anybody's knife.
just got a text. They just rushed Heather into the OR.
it doesn't look good for the baby.
fetal heart rate unstable.
we need Peds down here now! We're running out of time!
angels of God...
from Heaven so bright...
watch over my children...
and guide them aright.
fold your wings round them...
and guard them with love.
sing to them softly of Heaven above.
let's get her on the warmer.
you can bring Mom around. Looks like we're out of the woods now.
she's beautiful.
she's perfect.
she is perfect.
I almost can't believe it.
what's wrong?
it wasn't supposed to be like this.
I don't know if I can do this alone.
of course you can.
you are one of the strongest people I've ever met.
and you're not alone. You have each other.
she likes you.
she's an angel.
she is.
she's a little girl.
and she's beautiful.
just like you.
just like you.
excuse me.
Hi. Hello.
Hi.
nice ring.
Ah. Excuse me, miss.
you got to know the secret hand signal to get a drink In here.
it's like I'm invisible.
well, I see you. What can I get you?
Hi, I'm Neal.
okay, Neal. You thirsty?
Oh, uh... mojito. - You got it.
you know that rum sales have grown 12% in England because the mojito is so popular?
I'm... sorry.
I can get a little rain man I see numbers in everything.
I'm an accountant.
you're not a regular in here. - It's that obvious?
uh, my brother asked me to meet him here.
and he's late, as usual. - Okay.
I'm so sorry. - You clumsy cow.
Hey, buddy, she said she was sorry.
I'm not your buddy.
look, let me get you a towel.
how about you get me your manager? Because you just lost your job.
Hey! - ???
you bumped into her. - Who the hell are you?
how about you get out of my face?
Oh, my god.
Really?
Braden, stop!
Hey! I'm calling security.
everybody go back to your drinks.
are you okay? Oh...
I've never been in a bar fight before.
I couldn't tell.
did you see that punch I landed?
your one, his ten. Yeah, I saw.
Wow. You didn't have to do that.
Yeah, I did.
um, why don't you go clean yourself up?
and when you get back, drinks are on me.
I'll get back with you girls. I got to go take care of business.
you killed him.
no. I didn't.
so that's what you saw? You sure that's what happened?
I never saw a dead body before.
I freaked out. I got out of here. I called 911.
this place is not that big. How's that possible?
I saw them fight. That's it.
you have a clear line of sight to the men's room.
I don't know what to tell you.
you know, he was just sticking up for me.
but then the last time you saw Neal, he was headed to the men's room.
Yes.
I thought somebody called in a dead body.
they did, Eric.
nobody out there knows where the suspect is or the dead body.
there's no drag marks on the floor.
and there's only one way out of here, gentlemen.
if you get out of the bathroom,
there's an exit in the back hall, here.
no witnesses saw the suspect leave, though.
so how did they get the body out?
well, either somebody's lying or this Neal guy's Houdini.
and that's what it would take.
do you know the victim's last name?
I just heard the bartender call him Braden.
Braden, stop!
we didn't find any Braden in the receipts from last night.
you said the man who fought with him told you his name was Neal?
we did find three Neals.
think you could pick the suspect out of these dmv photos?
this is him, Neal Marshall.
he doesn't look like a killer.
looks can be deceiving.
look, um, we're going to shut the place down today. So you can go home.
but will you do me a favor and leave me your contact information?
Yeah, I need to put a bolo out on a Neal Marshall.
five-nine, brown hair, brown eyes. Thanks.
I don't know if it's important, But he said he was meeting his brother here.
he never showed up.
I'll look into that. Thank you.
Neal and I aren't just brothers, we run an investment firm together.
I know with absolute certainty that he wouldn't hurt anybody.
we have three little girls.
my husband's never been in any type of trouble.
very nice.
where do you think he could be?
he said he had a business meeting last night, but he never came home.
it's my understanding that you were supposed to meet him at bar 212.
I was helding up on an overseas call. I was running late.
you told him to meet you at a singles bar again?
witnesses stated that he was fighting over a woman.
Neal and I have been going through some difficulties.
difficulties?
she keeps him on a tight leash, and he's finally tugging back.
you can't blame the guy.
I mean, they got married right out of high school.
was he supposed to stay single and irresponsible, like you, forever, Dean?
you have been in his ear; I can tell.
excuse me.
Yeah.
okay. Yeah. - Was that about Neal?
his car was spotted pulling into a parking structure in south beach.
please don't let them hurt my husband.
I won't, Mrs Marshall.
the parking lot is across from the home address that the waitress at the bar gave us.
Yeah, well, that's not a coincidence. - Exactly.
all right. I'll go there now and check it out.
Natalia, that's it.
clear.
clear here.
he looks like he fits the description of the guy they found stabbed in the bathroom.
well, at least we know where Neal Marshall put his body.
Where's Neal Marshall?
Miami-Dade police department. Open the door.
just a second. - Let's go.
uh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little out of it, after what happened.
can I come in?
what's this about? Do you have any more questions about last night?
I want to come in.
sure.
you here alone? - Yeah, why?
you can't go in there! - Stay right there.
Neal Marshall? Put your hands up. - I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill that guy. - Put your hands up. Turn around.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can, and will, be used against you.
I'm innocent. Please...
let's go. Get over there.
cuff yourselves together. - Me?
Yeah, you. You were hiding him.
what? I didn't do anything. - Leave her alone.
she was just trying to help me.
Oh, my god. What did you do? - I didn't. I found him like that.
okay. Okay. Take these keys. Go to my place
ozone and twelfth. We'll figure this out.
I'll get there as soon as I can. - Why are you doing this for me?
because you said you didn't do this, and I believe you. Now, go!
it's called "aiding and abetting."
let's go. Come on.
this is an insane misunderstanding.
I fought with that guy at the bar, but I didn't kill him.
sure. Why is his body in your trunk, then?
what?
that's impossible. I'm being set up.
set up by who? - I don't know!
you should be quiet, Neal.
someone needs to figure all this out!
Oh, no. - What the hell was that?
it's them.
what do you mean, them? Who's them?
guys, ???
we got to get the hell out of here.
how? We can help! - However the hell way we can.
uncuff us! Please!
all right. - Grab the door.
on my count, right? One, two, three.
all right.
come on, give me your hand!
it doesn't look like it fell ten floors.
car isn't even that damaged, man.
Yeah, well, trust me, it was falling.
Hey, Wolfe, you got anything in that control panel?
Yeah, I think I got something.
looks like a remote-control switch plate that's wired to the power line.
that explains what happened.
he turned off the power, triggering the electromagnetic brakes.
what the hell was that?
right, giving me time to get out of the car...
...turn the power back on and release the brakes.
Yeah, the car falls, turn the power off, engage the brakes.
gives Neal and Olivia a soft landing, let them escape.
Hey, did these two know each other before last night?
Neal's married. H spoke to his wife.
she said she was worried he might be stepping out on her.
I did a background check on Olivia Hunter. I didn't find anything.
well, someone must have been up here to help them rig the elevator.
that's how they got away.
Yeah, well, we need to find out who.
I need you to be honest with me right now, Mrs. Marshall, - And Tell me where your husband is. - I have no idea.
you know, covering for him is a felony. That's a whole lot of prison time.
are you accusing me of something? - We know that he didn't escape alone.
it was too well orchestrated.
I didn't help him, I swear.
Neal is the father of my children. If I had any idea, any idea at all...
do you know who Olivia Hunter is?
no. Who is she?
she came up in the investigation.
God.
look...
all we know is that your husband is involved in something very dangerous, and I need your help.
you've got to tell me anything you possibly know
that could help us figure out what.
I... I don't know if it means anything. But Neal's been having some problems at work.
what kind of problems?
they lost an account, a big one,
and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
please find my husband. Please.
thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall. You can go home for now. Okay.
got your text.
there's an anomaly with the victim found In Neal Marshall's trunk.
this body's temp-- It doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
what are you saying?
this man has been dead for several days.
so, he can't be our victim from the bar.
couldn't have been.
a corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death,
and another degree each hour after that.
so, by that calculation,
he should be approximately 87 degrees.
precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
so he started too low.
are we saying he was frozen?
or held in some sort of cold storage.
take a look at the knife wound.
there should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
right.
now, this incision is recent.
what is that, doctor? - It's an rfid chip.
some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
so, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove,
because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the rfid reader in here?
Yeah.
where did you get an rfid chip? - It was in our victim.
well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
what?
the body that we found in the trunk--It's a medical cadaver.
so our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
we have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
a phantom crime scene.
and a rigged elevator.
what the hell is going on?
here we go.
the cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
donated his body to Silas Biotech.
I'm gonna ask Boa Vista to go by Silas Biotech.
maybe she can get some answers.
Hello?
Oh, I am so sorry.
we are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
I need to speak to the person in charge of your research cadavers.
Oh, well, that-that'd be my boss, but he's out.
that's why we're having the party now.
he does not like to have fun on the clock.
well, unfortunately, he's probably not gonna like this, either.
we found one of your research cadavers at a crime scene.
pulled this off the rfid chip.
Oh. Mr. Norris.
Oh. Okay, um...
let's see here.
Hi. Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
all right.
did you know that he was missing?
uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
how does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
thank you. - You welcome.
we-we do everything we can to prevent it, but...
did you file a police report?
we hadn't officially determined, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
there was an inventory audit in mid-process.
can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
the body went missing during transport from Dade General, so...
you might want to follow up with them.
I will. Thank you.
hello.
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD. He's on the phone with horatio right now.
we need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me. Come in, and we'll work it out.
why is this happening?
what is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her. I woke up, and she was dead.
who's dead, Neal? Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
she said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant. Maybe I saw something.
some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see. I don't know!
okay. Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
I got a location.
???? - He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
don't forget to send backup.
on their way.
??? - I got the room key.
they checked in under the waitress's name.
it's clear.
she's gone.
I don't get this guy.
the victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
look at this damage on the molding.
that looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
but when would that have taken place?
is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
or that's what he wants us to think.
let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at c-3.
spinal cord was severed death was instantaneous.
how could that have happened?
she fell. Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
and what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
that bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
it looks like she's been in a fight.
evidence seems to indicate.
and the tattoo on the hand.
hm.
chinese symbol for "long life."
pity she was denied one.
she was covering it with body makeup.
she also has... tinted contacts.
and her hair was dyed.
she's attempting to conceal her identity.
now, why would she do that?
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in afis.
Uh-huh. Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-Wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
exactly. And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist,
I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas Biotech.
now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
see, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
especially with that whole Lisa-Slash-Olivia. She had to have been part of it, right?
you know what, I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
Hora... Horatio, I was here. Right here.
Hello?
this was a working office. There was... a reception desk,
there was... workers coming out of this back room.
I'm so sorry. We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
this is crazy.
I mean, they completely stripped the place.
there's nothing here.
I don't get it.
let's get a team here to go over this place. All aright?
Horatio, wait a minute.
there's something in here.
I'm not crazy. I'm not cra... This is what that receptionist was wearing earlier today.
he does not like to have fun on the clock.
I'm gonna take all these documents and try to get them reconstructed back at the lab.
what the hell is going on here?
I thought this software was supposed to make reconstructing documents easier.
it's searching for patterns and repeated text, but... with all of this...
we're gonna be lucky to even find segments of information. It is gonna take some time.
Yes, you think?
Hey, we're working as fast as we can.
I know. It's... I'm sorry.
look, it's just that I've got to figure out what the heck is going on here.
I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure. What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas Biotech corporate card.
okay.
so if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front. Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
okay, here's the credit card number that I have.
so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
that account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
the billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.
Yeah, sure. Don't mention it.
thank you.
excuse me?
you killed him.
these are all the witnesses from the bar.
what is going on?
let's find out. Ladies and gentlemen, could I have you all stand against the wall, please?
whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
I think I can help here.
this is the lady from before.
she's from Silas Biotech.
Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
you know, actually, I'm sorry, I was not completely honest with you before.
I am Wendy Colton. I am the CEO of l. I.V. E. Corporation. Nice to meet you.
if you are investigating the murder at bar 212, I think I can ease your minds. This is Braden Wilkinson.
and, uh, he was the man who fought with Neal Marshall at the bar.
I'm not your buddy.
as you can see, he's alive and well. There was no murder.
so we know how the dead body got out of the men's room, it walked out.
and everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.
you do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.
we have a young lady who's lying dead in the morgue.
who?
her name is Lisa Blackhall,a.k.a Olivia Hunter.
um... could we please discuss this in private?
she's gone.
when was the last time you talked to Lisa?
well, she was off the grid for a couple hours,
but that happens sometimes-- I thought she was gonna check in soon.
what exactly do you do here?
we solved the problem of virtual reality. We make it real.
listen up! Okay, everybody, get in position.
we're ten minutes out before Neal's arrival.
how hard do I hit him?
make him feel it, but don't break anything.
cue the music.
we create actual, tailored, immersive experiences for our clients that changes their lives.
they're getting into the elevator now.
I'm on it.
kill the power.
got it.
well, you certainly changed Lisa's life.
we had nothing to do with her death.
you put her in that situation with Neal.
she took Neal to that hotel because it was in the script.
it was supposed to look like they'd slept together. That was part of the fantasy.
what are we going to do? This is insane.
we need to lay low, okay? Figure out what you stumbled into.
make a list of all your clients.
I want to know who killed her.
I don't know.
you're saying Neal paid for this?
no. He had no idea what was going on. His game was a gift.
from who?
Contractually, I can't say. - Consider the contract null and void.
we're talking about one of your employees here.
that's fine, we'll just get a warrant.
no. No, I... really, that... that won't be necessary.
this will tell you everything you need to know.
you're under arrest. - For what?
reckless endangerment. - And obstruction of justice.
it's just a game. - Game over.
come on, let's go.
let go of my arm.
lieutenant Caine.
okay, I'm on my way.
what is it? - Neal just broke into his own house.
Neal, you're acting crazy. - We have to go now.
what about the kids?
we'll pick them up from school. Listen, I love you.
then just stop.
no, we're running out of time.
Neal, just calm down, okay? We can work this out.
put it down.
this is a mistake.
wouldn't be my first one today.
but it'll be your last.
Neal, listen to me.
this is just a game.
what the hell are you talking about?
please, baby, I don't want to see you get hurt.
Neal, look, you're taking this way too far. You're innocent, we can prove that.
put the gun down.
listen what he's say Neal. Your brother knows what he's talking about.
he doesn't know anything.
explain it to him, Dean.
okay, he's right. Look, none of this is real.
you're not making any sense.
I just want my life back.
you'll get it back, but you've got to put that gun down first.
I can't trust you.
I'm all you've got right now.
look, please, the gun is not loaded, so don't, don't shoot him, please.
I keep this gun loaded, Dean. How did you know that?
how did you know it wasn't loaded?
it's always loaded.
d-did you take the bullets out?
would somebody explain to me what's going on?
that's exactly what Dean's going to do right now. Aren't you, Dean?
what, do you know something, Dean?
tell me. Tell me!
look where we are. A woman is dead. Why would you do this?
no one was supposed to die.
I was framed for murder.
I did it for you, for us. - For us?
I needed to get you out of your comfort zone
my brother is a coward.
we can take his whole world and tilt it.
we'll strip him of everything he has and take him on a classic hero's journey.
once he succeeds in overcoming the worst we can throw at him, he'll come out of the game with a new confidence, afraid of nothing.
this is very... expensive.
it'll be money well spent.
Why? I was happy.
it was killing our firm.
this is about money?
this is about the Dunlevy account? - I had them.
they were going to invest millions until you told them that it wasn't prudent.
I gave them a risk assessment. - You gave them an accurate risk assessment.
who does that?
we lost them, how many others? I needed you to man up.
I was actually starting to believe your crap about how I needed to loosen up, have fun, but you know what I learned from all this?
what? - That I love my wife and kids and I want to be with them more than anything else, and that makes me more of a man than you'll ever be.
gentlemen.
so, Dean, did the game include murder?
no.
I swear. This was all just supposed to be pretend. I didn't kill her.
who did? - I have no idea.
she called me from the hotel, she was pretty worried.
did Neal just call you?
no, is he okay?
well, he's freaking out just like he's supposed to.
so what's the problem?
I've kept him off his cell, but I just caught him talking to somebody.
he didn't call you?
no.
if he compromised the game, it could be dangerous.
I got to go.
I don't remember making a call.
that's because you were drugged, Neal.
that's the last I heard from Lisa.
could I have your cell phone, please?
you did make a call, Neal, just preceding the murder.
he called me?
I must have missed it.
it's okay.
you're lying, Mrs. Marshall.
pardon?
can we see your left shoulder, please?
what? Why?
why are you doing that?
because you were at the hotel, and you forced your way into your husband's room, didn't you?
I knew Dean wanted you to go to bars, to see other women...
Jenny, I never did any... - You were tempted.
I could tell.
so you did get that phone call from the hotel?
Yes.
Jenny, I don't think you're safe.
I need you to get the girls and go to your mother's.
Neal, what's going on?
the police said you were fighting over some woman, that you killed a man.
no, I didn't kill anyone.
you sound strange. Where are you?
Jenny, please, I'm at the Brio Hotel, but I think I'm being followed.
it's not safe.
Neal? Who are you talking to?
are you alone? - Just do what I said.
get the girls and go to your mother's now.
I went to the hotel. I wasn't sure what I would find.
can I help you?
who the hell are you? Where's my husband?
I never thought that Neal would get blamed. I just got out of there.
how could I know that it was only a game? For me it was very real.
there was Neal with another woman.
I'm sorry that I ever gave you reason to believe that I would do that.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
we have to go.
please, no, there has to be a way.
tell the girls I love them, okay?
can you do that?
please.
can't you do something? It's not her fault. Please, it's the game.
I'm sorry, Neal. But she killed someone. She's looking at manslaughter.
is this part of the game?
please tell me this isn't real.
Neal, I can assure you, this is all too real.
let's get him!
get him! Get him!
you better run.
head him off!
you can't run forever!
we're going to get you!
we've got him, man!
who is he, Frank?
according to his I. D.
our victim's name is Philip Gordon.
witness saw four men chasing him.
four men.
philip certainly knows how to draw a crowd, doesn't he?
Yeah. I ran him.
turns out he's a registered sex offender.
released from Westgate state prison less than a month ago.
well, that will do it, won't it?
dead child molester.
some people might say that's a problem that took care of itself.
alexx, you know the area.
too well, Horatio.
my kids play in this park.
did you know you had a registed sex offender in your neighborhood?
everybody did.
his face has been all over the websites.
the entire neighborhood was up in arms over it.
that certainly increases the suspect pool, doesn't it?
and the number of killers.
this body is badly beaten.
I'm expecting to find several more injuries and broken bones.
mob mentality can turn a boy scout into a killer.
and makes it hard to determine which man killed him.
or maybe not.
that's a stab wound.
alexx, that just narrowed us down to one.
wait. wait. Stop, guys.
hold on a second.
those are perfectly round drops of blood.
they're gravitational.
means he bled while he was still standing, alexx.
so he was stabbed before he ran.
it also means he left a blood trail.
Thanks, guys. -You willcome
Eric, got anything?
Yeah. I found this at the start of the blood trail.
cell phone for kids.
he wasn't supposed to be within 100 feet of those kids.
it doesn't look good for him right now.
that could explain the attack, too.
that should be easy to find out.
these phones, they speed dial 911 and the kids' parents.
let's do a reverse directory on the parents.
name is Victor Terraza.
and,... he lives, he lives right around the corner.
some man tried to grab my daughter.
I yelled at the guy to get him away from her, and I guess somebody heard me because a few guys took off after him.
I just grabbed Isabel and ran home.
did you recognize the man?
no. I was just focused on Isabel, you know?
would you mind if I spoke to her?
no. Go ahead.
Hi.
you want to tell me what happened?
my tights got ripped.
that's too bad, isn't it?
I told my dad I don't like to wear dresses.
I understand.
Isabel, did the man hurt you?
Yeah. He made me fall down.
who brought you here?
what?
who did you come here with?
my daddy.
where is your daddy?
I don't know.
daddy, where are you?
I screamed really loud like daddy taught me.
and then he ran away?
thank you very much.
I like your elephant.
Mr. Terraza, how much time did he spend with her?
a few minutes? I don't know.
I'm going to need to, uh... process her.
process?
she's got, as you may have noticed, some blood on her dress.
boy, this guy really took a beating.
Yeah.
but it was the running that got him.
the running?
Yeah.
the stab wound caused massive internal bleeding, but the fatty tissue sealed the laceration, containing the bleeding.
now, this guy was going to die either way, but the running sped it up.
the physical exertion accelerated his heart rate, filling his peritoneum with blood.
now, I also found some green material in his hairlike fibers.
Yeah. The little girl had that on her, too.
when I processed her, I sent it to trace.
alexx, what is that on his cheek?
some kind of pattern.
like a shoeprint.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
just dropping this off.
it's a mysterious green fiber from philip's clothes.
it's not a fiber.
it's acrylamide polymer,
A. K.A. Fertilizer.
Wow. You're good.
not that good.
Calleigh found the same stuff earlier.
fertilizer.
must have gotten it during the fall?
it's not just any fertilizer.
it's hydromulch a mix of wood fibers and bonding agents used to keep grass growing in areas with lots of foot traffic.
well, all that tells us is that philip died in the park, which is something we already knew.
park manager said they sprayed for the first time this morning.
so, we find the suspects with mulch, we find the mob.
now all you need is a few suspects.
I think Calleigh can help with that.
she just paged me from layout.
see ya.
so somebody stepped on Philip's face.
let's see what kind of shoes that somebody had on.
give me the class characteristics.
okay. The majority of the sole is a chevron pattern.
the treads are approximately one centimeter in width at two-centimeter intervals.
and the border is single-lined continuous.
let me see.
the latest Transverse five stars.
lieutenant Caine. What's the news?
the news is, you lied to me.
what?
you didn't rush your daughter home this morning.
your shoeprints were found all over philip gordon's face.
well, what would you do if some pervert came after your kid?
why don't you tell me what you did, Victor?
look, I was talking to some of the other dads.
I thought I was keeping an eye on Isabel the whole time.
then, all of a sudden, I hear her crying.
daddy! Where are you, daddy?!
that's that pervert.
let's get him.
got him!
and then you stabbed him to protect your daughter.
Stabbed...?
Hey, I didn't stab anybody.
look. Like I said,
I chased the guy, and then I gave him a good whaling. That's it.
this morning, you told us you didn't recognize him.
everybody knew that freak.
from the website?
no. The posters.
they're all over my street.
posters.
excuse me, Frank.
Eric, get Mr. Wolfe, and go back to that neighborhood.
thank you.
Hey, check this out.
there were posters here, now there are just staples and corners.
somebody took them all down.
Yeah. Guilty conscience.
or it's a consciousness of guilt.
you keep your kids on a short leash?
I don't have kids.
Oh, I just figured with all the "dating" you do...
Yeah, well, I'm very careful.
well, better safe than sorry.
what about you, you been dating?
taking a little bit of a break right now.
a break-- that's what they call it?
look, why don't you go to that side of the street, take a look, and I'll stay on this side of the street
I got one.
Wow， somebody really had it out for him.
Yeah.
let's find out who.
of course I put them up.
I also went to PTA meetings and signed up for neighborhood watch.
why did you post them, alexx?
it wasn't like I was targeting philip.
I look at the F. D.L. E.Website all the time.
when I saw this guy was only a few blocks away, I put up a few posters.
come on, Horatio, you know the recidivism rate for sex offenders is huge.
and there is no known cure.
exactly.
I just wanted the parents to be informed so they could protect their chil...
wait a minute.
can I be charged criminally with this?
an aggressive attorney might move for a civil suit.
Horatio, I was ptecting my children.
Oh, my lord, there's one on my block.
are you gonna move?
I'm gonna move my gun safe into my bedroom.
but you wouldn't put a poster up.
it's not illegal.
but I mean as a county employee, right?
Alexx should've known better.
well, she has two kids.
and as a county employee, she has every right.
we have firsthand knowledge of how dangerous these guys can be.
she also has firsthand knowledge of how quickly people escalate to violence.
she should've thought of that.
would you rather her little girl end up on her table instead?
I would rather no one end up on her table.
that's not always an option in the real world.
I work patrol
I think I know a little something about the real world.
guys?
is there going to be a rumble here?
we were just discussing the case.
what's up?
Phil Gordon's residence, that's whats up
it turns out he wasn't the only one that lives there.
who would live with a sex offender?
someone with the same last name-- Gordon.
sounds like family. -Yeah.
I'm on my way over there with Tripp to check it out.
take it easy on each other, all right?
we were just letting Philip stay here while he got back on his feet.
so, he was your brother?
Yeah, nobody else would give him a break.
you took these posters down?
you bet I did.
they were like neon arrows to our front door.
Yley and I were being harassed.
that rock through the window was the last straw.
so why let him live here?
cause he's my brother.
couldn't say no.
how'd you feel about that, Mrs. Gordon?
I understood.
but it hasn't been easy.
I mean, I've been getting these migraines ever since he moved in.
why don't you go lie down honey, -okay? -Okay.
this has been hard on her.
since the vandalism started, we can't go out anymore.
one of us has to stay home at all times just to protect the house.
so you were home all morning?
I was working;
Hayley was here, sick in bed.
we're gonna need that projectile that came through the window.
okay. I threw it in the trash.
all right, well, then we're gonna need to confiscate the trash.
it's all yours.
you want to, uh, show us Philip's room?
okay. It's this way.
is this his? -Yeah.
lots of death threats.
smells like ammonia.
was he using that to get high?
no, no, nothing like that.
philip said he would inhale those anytime he had an unhealthy thought.
like a reverse pavlov.
so he was self-correcting?
Yeah. He really wanted to get better.
looks like he had a long way to go. -Yeah.
that kiddie porn on Philip's computer? Wasn't his.
how could that be? It's his laptop.
someone sent him a pornado.
philip got an e-mail that said he won a free trip to Hawaii, but when he clicked on the link to collect his prize, there was no free tickets, and there was only porn girls,
trying to stop it only makes it worse.
virtual porn bomb.
I don't get why someone would send porn to a child molester.
because somebody wanted him to look guilty.
can we find out who?
Mdpd's running on the address.
okay, good. I'm there. Thanks.
lieutenant Caine.
we meet again, Ned.
I haven't done anything.
I wouldn't say you haven't done anything, Ned.
you sent a virus to Philip Gordon's computer.
well, yeah.
and now Philip Gordon's dead, Ned.
dead? I-I had nothing to do with that.
I've been home all day.
Ned, you wanted Philip gone, and you got your wish.
Yeah, but I didn't want him dead.
I just wanted him to move.
I thought if he got caught with the porn, it would violate his terms of release, and-and-and they'd send him back to prison.
why did you care?
ever since he moved to the gables, I've been getting harassed.
by who? -Neighbors.
it was bad enough you caught me for peeping on Ashley Anders.
people hear a guy like that is moving in, and they check out the web site and then my picture pops up, and they think I'm the same as him.
but you are a sex offender, Ned.
but I'm not a predator.
and I'm not a pedophile.
I-I would never hurt a child.
I just... like adult actresses.
a little too much.
but you have bigger problems that distributing child pornography is a felony, Ned.
it's not like I looked at it.
you don't have to.
this the trash from the brother's place?
Yep. Delko said the object that went through their window's in here.
you gonna help?
so, hey, what happened between you and Calleigh? Big fight?
it's not really my place to discuss calleigh's business.
it's your business, too.
it's not yours.
you know Calleigh will just tell me later anyway.
good.
she'll probably tell it better.
there's something on it.
what's it say?
you ruined everything.
that sounds personal.
Yeah, maybe it was Ned, the porn stalker.
or one of Philip's victims.
I'll run its dna.
to run against the old cases?
Yeah, it's worth a try. See if you can find anything else here.
Yeah.
Hey, Natalia. -Hey.
so, do you want the good news or the bad news?
always the good news.
you're invited to my party.
thank u very much.
that's great.
what about the bad news?
the bad news is the epis from the rock don't match any of Philip Gordon's molested victims.
maybe it was Ned.
Mm-mm, amelogenin is xx.
it was a girl that threw that rock.
let's look at all of philip's previous victims.
did she check hannah brooks in '91?
Yeah.
what about amanda clarkston '93? -Yes.
Ryan, Valera assured me that she checked all of Philip Gordon's victims.
this just doesn't make sense.
now this really doesn't make sense.
sure. The classic escalation of a sexual predator.
Yeah, exactly.
except at the height of his crimes, he committed one more burglary.
these guys don't go backwards.
burglary? That was over ten years ago.
Yeah, it was.
but yesterday, someone threw one of these rocks through that burglar's window.
they're out there for anyone to take.
can you tell us about that night ten years ago?
where was your daughter?
what does that have to do with anything?
philip Gordon wasn't just a burglar.
he was also a sexual predator.
more than a burglary happened that night, didn't it?
you're wrong.
criminals like PhilipGgordon have a progressive disorder.
that means they don't revert from sual assault back to nonviolent crime.
there's a first time for everything.
no, they're right.
Julia,don't say another word.
you wouldn't let me talk back then, but you can't stop me now.
what happened?
I woke up, and he was in my bedroom.
my mother, she wouldn't let me say anything.
she said that the court case would be too hard and that it would follow me forever.
well, guess what, mom.
it did anyway.
I was only trying to protect you.
but you couldn't.
so you decided to get your own revenge.
I saw those posters.
I couldn't believe that he would move into our neighborhood.
I wanted him to know that I remembered.
I was still so angry.
I'm afraid you're going to have to come with us to the station and make a statement.
Dr. Halliwell?
alexx, have a seat.
I understand you were being questioned in relation to a murder.
Gary, I put up posters, that's it.
Hey, I'm on your side, alexx.
so what's the problem?
I just think it would be a good thing for you to take a break from the day shift, lieutenant Caine and his team.
this won't affect my work.
it already has.
today you were being questned about a murder, alexx, and a few months ago you wrote a prescription for CSI Wolfe.
Ryan needed antibiotics.
he should've seen his doctor.
I was helping a friend.
they're your friends,
I am your boss.
so you're punishing me.
I'm helping you.
you're an excellent forensic pathologist, alexx.
thank you, doctor.
as you know,
I make the deputy chief appointment.
I see no reason why it shouldn't be you someday.
I'm flattered.
but that appointment is based on politics as much as merit.
Meing?
I'm looking out for your reputation.
I want you to switch to night shift.
working with an unfamiliar crew will help keep you objective.
okay.
well, you're making a good decision.
so you think the young girl did it? -No.
there's no hydromulch on her clothes or shoes.
eh, doesn't mean she wasn't involved.
Yeah, we're checking her story.
you walk all the way over here for this?
taking a real interest in this case.
Yeah. And I also wanted to make sure your eye infection has cleared.
Yeah, it's all good.
my doctor is looking into nerve damage.
nerve damage?
I can't help you anymore.
I have my own doctor now.
Ryan, who did you tell
I wrote you that prescription?
no one.
well, the news traveled all the way to the chief medical examiner's office.
well, alexx, you know there's a mole in the lab.
which is why I can't do any more favors.
I really put myself out on a limb for you, baby.
I got it.
I don't know if I can keep this up, H.
Mr. Wolfe, -I understand, but I need you to trust me. This will not fall on you.
did you page me?
Yeah. I went through the rest of the trash from Philip's house.
check this out.
Yeah, that's hydromulch from the park.
this is a failed delivery notice from worldsend.
are you telling me the worldsend man killed philip?
no, the wife said she was home all morning.
but according to this, worldsend tried to deliver a notice at 10: 10 and no one was there.
so it blows her alibi.
Yep
it must have been hard to let Philip into your home.
like Robert said, he's family.
he's not your family.
I consider him to be.
look, what is this about?
you weren't home all day like you said you we.
worldsend tried to deliver a package and no one was there.
I did go out for a bit.
I went to the doctor, since I wasn't feeling well.
like I told the detective,
I've been getting migraines.
we found evidence from the park on that note.
I walked to the appointment.
I thought fresh air might help.
look, call my doctor.
he'll tell you.
we will.
Hey, Tripp. -Yeah?
anything on the wife?
Yeah, her alibi checks out.
doctor's office called and confirmed an appointment.
so why was she acting so weird?
probably conflicted;
didn't want to live with Philip, but she's married to his brother.
and people think you're a tough guy.
I need to see lieutenant Caine
A. S. A. P!
what's going on?
Oh, no, no, no.
I will only speak to Horatio Caine.
okay, we'll take you to him.
no, this is important!
someone just tried to kill me!
thought I was a child molester.
I know. I know I shouldn't have done the pornado.
but lieutenant, my life's in danger.
who attacked you, Ned?
I don't know.
I couldn't see his face.
so, tell me exactly what happened.
I never, never should have opened the door.
you touch any kid -in this neighborhood... -please, don't!
I'm not like that!
can you describe him, Ned?
male, six feet, average size.
Hey, when you catch him, can I sue?
Ned, first I need to catch him.
why the camera?
I have to take a photograph of your bruise.
I don't have a bruise.
not that you can see.
can you stand up, please?
pull your shirt aside.
when you get a bruise, blood vessels break under your skin.
it can take a few days for the bruise to visibly form.
uv light penetrates the skin deeper than visible light, so this camera can figure out what's going on underneath.
you can see under my skin?
I'm about to.
whoa, you, uh... you planning on going postal?
I'm planning on catching the vigilante.
okay.
I measured that photograph that Ryan took of Ned's bruise, and I've determined that the mark was made by either a . 45 or a nine-millimet.
great. Well, that narrows it down to half the population of miami.
well, this actually narrows it down a bit more.
two Colts and a Smith are the only models that make this figure-eight barrel.
so what now?
play the match game.
this barrel plug ratio is not proportional.
muzzle diameter is a few millimeters short.
we got it.
this is the barrel that made the impression.
colt nine-mill, 19-11.
all right. I'm going to check the computer, see if anyone in Ned's neighborhood owns one.
Yeah, got several names.
that name keeps popping up.
I'm going to let Horatio know.
this morning, you left the part out about your sex-offender welcome wagon.
I just like to scare punks like Ned.
then how can you explain to me, Victor, that Philip ended up dead?
that guy was a threat.
hanging around that park every morning?
it was only a matter of time before he snatched up some little girl.
you knew Philip was going to be at the park, and yet you took Isabel anyway.
I can protect her.
you have a swing set in your own backyard, yet you chose to go to the park Isabel likes it.
I don't think that's what happened, Victor.
I think that you targeted Philip.
you think a lot of things.
and I also think that you used Isabel as bait.
all right.
you play here, baby.
papi has something he has to do.
if any man comes up to you, you scream, okay?
okay, daddy. -Okay, go ahead.
you dressed her up and took her to the park, knowing there was a sexual predator there.
I still didn't stab the guy, so... I'm out of here.
hold up.
actually...
that'not true.
you're not going anywhere.
raise your arms up.
you assaulted Ned Ostroff.
yoll be sticking around here for a little while.
well, what do we have here?
wow, that's sharp.
you take this to the park this morning?
no comment.
arrest him, frank.
let's go.
Horatio wants us to compare the wounds on the victim to the knife we found on Victor Terraza.
double-edge blade.
a knife like this leaves a clean, symmetrical wound.
Philip's wound was ragged.
meaning that the murder weapon would have to be a single-edge serrated knife, so that is not the murder weapon.
afraid not.
the only other bleeder......is this.
look at this laceration.
I thought he got it from the fence.
but the edges are curved.
from a serrated knife.
It'not torn. -So?
philip had a knife wound on his back.
well, how'd that happen?
he was carrying the knife in his belt.
and he got the scratch when the killer pulled it out.
which means he brought the murder weapon with him, either for protection or... who knows?
philip was killed with his own knife.
what's this about?
Dr. Warner is gonna trade shifts with me next month.
I'm back on days.
that's my decision, not yours.
this team treats me like family, and Horatio Caine is personally responsible for saving my life.
you don't owe him anything.
Yes, I do.
and I want to work with people I respect.
excuse me?
Dr. Halliwell, lieutenant Caine and his team are at the top of their field.
and I want to work with the best.
now, if that blocks my chance at having a corner office and a few extra bucks a week, so be it.
you realize what you're giving up.
my decision is made.
and now you have to live with it.
what do you want with my kitchen?
philip was found with a knife on him ts morning, ma'am, and it may turn out to be the murder weapon.
but all of my knives are here.
it couldn't be one of mine.
unless somebody put it back.
we'll know as soon as we find it.
this one tested positive for blood.
we've got our murder weapon.
so someone in this house killed philip.
I did it.
no, you didn't.
you were at the doctor, just like you said.
no. No, I'm confessing.
arrest me.
after what you've been through,
I doubt very much you could have overpowered Philip.
not to tell me what happened?
we've been trying to get pregnant for three years.
all we wanted was our own family.
and then philip...
got out of prison.
I... I came home and I saw the graffiti and the broken window.
the stress...
I started bleeding, and...
I lost the baby.
so you blamed Philip.
the doctor said there could be a million reasons why.
I couldn't help but think that maybe if he hadn't moved in...
I'd still be pregnant.
and at what point, hayley, did you inform robert?
as soon as it happened.
thank you, ma'am.
my parents taught us that family was everything.
I wanted to believe that philip could get better.
Yes, because philip was your brother, right?
but then hayley told me about the miscarage.
and that's when you went over the edge.
I was just gonna tell him that he had to move out.
so you went to look for him at the park.
what is this?
a knife?
it's nothing. I-I need...
I need protection.
when I saw that knife,
I knew he was never going to be normal.
why are you even at this playground?
you are not supposed to be within a hundred feet.
I'm just testing myself.
I won't do anything, I promise.
you need to stop.
I-I n't think that I can.
and I thought I was the good brother.
I stood up for him.
you stood up for him by killing him.
I had to do it.
he was gonna hurt someone else.
he already hurt my family.
no, you did that.
you hurt your family.
officer.
I feel bad for that guy.
I hope the jury takes it easy on him.
a killer is a killer.
you believe that?
personally? No.
Profesonally, yeah.
and I'm still on the clock.
you want to ask me again in about an hour over a beer?
Oh, you're not mad at me?
cause, um, I heard we got in a really big fight today.
don't believe everything you hear.
why are you doing this?
hang on a second, Frank.
you got to see this.
pop that trunk, will you?
Yeah.
interesting use of cargo space.
Yes. That would explain why our driver was moving so fast.
one thing's for sure: She was hauling ass.
Yes, Frank.
a dead body can have that effect on you.
"Collision."
Hey.
anything on our vics?
the guy in the trunk's a john doe.
what about the driver?
her license says her name's angela ross.
I've got tripp running it.
H wants a reconstruction of this, but whole lot left to work with.
I think she was hit by another car.
what gives you that?
there's a collapsed rear quarter panel.
it's inconsistent with this accident.
we're going to need as much crash data as we can get.
unfortunately, at 6: 00.A. M.
there aren't any witnesses.
no witnesses? You sure about that?
what do you mean?
check it out.
there's a traffic camera.
Trafc cameras take pictures of speeders.
maybe it caught something worth seeing.
that's good.
check it out.
any id yet on the guy from the trunk?
nada.
hmm.
all right. What do we have?
looking at strangulation.
and there's a gash on his side that caused loss of blood.
now, I'm thinking it's postmortem.
buy I'll know more at the post.
all right.
anything else?
there was one interesting thing.
baby boy has red dye on both his hands.
you have any theories?
working on it.
let me guess. You'll know more at the post.
always do.
Hey, Alexx, what's your take on Angela Ross, our female driver?
well...
eyes are clear.
her pallor's good.
I think She was definitely into something hinky.
I'm just waiting for tox to tell me more.
she didn't have any track marks.
body weight's normal.
no sign of hep or other diseases.
Meaning?
there's a look they have when ty hit my table.
the bad ones.
this one.
she didn't have that look.
she was speeding out of town at sunup with a, uh...
with a body in her trunk.
you asked my opinion.
I'll tell you mine.
I think she was up to no good.
if she was, Ryan, let her tell us.
Hey, Calleigh.
Hey.
I sent a patrol unit out to our female driver's address.
and. What'd you find?
vacant lot.
Really?
Angela's id was a fake?
Yeah.
our girl just became a jane doe.
so, we don't have an id on eitr victim.
no.
so, what's next?
run with what we've got.
red ink, white fibers from the guy in the trunk.
okay.
anything yet?
Yeah, these fibers you called about.
they're all over the trunk.
100% sheepskin wool, with a chromium wash.
Mm. Seat covers.
exactly. Trace confirmed it.
well, maybe they were on john doe's body when he was dumped in the trunk.
what are you thinking?
I'm still thinking that this supports my second car theory. Come here.
there's damage here in the quarter panel and bumper.
at over 60 miles per hour.
it could have happened then.
well, there's also paint transfer.
now, it could be incidental, or it could be road rage.
what about the body in the trunk?
I didn't say it wasn't a strange case.
we need to get these paint samples to trace, have them analyzed.
every paint has a distinct signature, so...
we find the collision car, we find a witness.
that's right.
or a murder suspect.
so, you got something.
I certainly did.
victim's car is a silver frost metallic.
gray base coat, ultragloss sealer.
okay, what about the other sample?
arctic silver metallic, zinc chromium primer.
a second car.
she was run off the road.
okay, let's plug into the automotive paint database and see what we come up with.
porsche boxster 986.
3. 2-liter, 0 horsepower. Sweet ride.
Yup.
I'll put the word out.
we're looking for an arctic silver boxster.
that look silver to you, Eric?
Yeah, as silver as a new dime.
Yes. Front end damage, too.
it's consistent with the collision damage on the victim's car.
sheepskin seat covers.
Yeah, just like the fibers on our john doe.
did you get something?
Yeah.
rental contract.
Sunstar rents.
the car of your dreams, weekend rates.
the question is, whose dream is it, Eric?
his name's russell miller.
staying at the copper palms hotel on collins.
interesting. Call the copper palms and tell them to hang on to our dreamer.
Mr. Miller?
Yeah, I'm russell miller.
what can I do for you?
a car rented in your name was involved in a traffic incident this morning.
what kind of incident?
man was found dead in a trunk.
well, I valeted my car last night.
I've been in a seminar all morning.
you recognize that man?
never seen him before.
material from your seat cover was found on his clothing.
Yes, it was, and there was ink on his hands, just like the ink on your shirt right now, Mr. Miller.
all right. All right, look.
they guy's name is luis.
he's a valet here.
he set me up with a girl.
you know, for a fee.
car jockey was also a pimp?
we agreed on a price.
then he wanted more money.
I refused.
we had a fight.
you had a fight?
where did the fight take place?
in the car.
we agreed on a price!
that was for her.
this is for my cut.
you don't get a cut.
either I do, or you do.
look, I... I'm a married man.
this could be very bad for me.
not as bad, mr. Miller, as it was for luis.
put him in the car, please.
you think the hooker might be ourissing driver?
if she exists at all, Frank.
pimps usually sleep with their employees.
Yes, they do.
alexx, let's run a sexual activity kit on our john doe.
thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
Where's valera?
she had a meeting at the state attorney's office.
the state attorney?
Mm-hmm.
you know why?
don't know, but you're stuck with me.
since I am, let me bounce something off you.
you know that luis reyes weighed 160 pounds, right?
right.
and russell miller says that some mystery hooker tossed him in e trunk of a car.
and you're wondering how she did it.
I'm wondering if she even exists.
she does not.
here's the results of valera's test swabs.
DNA, on his privates was male.
there was no hooker.
it was just russell.
I'll tell horatio.
we found male dna on luis, south of the border.
we think it might be yours.
what do you mean?
you killed luis, put him in the trunk of the car, and then walked away.
he was blackmailing me.
blackmailing you how?
okay, truth.
we had sex.
just a one-time thing.
then he threatened to tell my wife.
give me $500, closet boy, and it all goes away.
what happens if I don't?
then I pay a visit to your wife.
tell her that the man of the house is not so manly.
you can't do that.
watch me...
that lady...
that lady drove by at just the wrong time.
she saw it all.
and you ran her off the road. off the road.
I did what I had to do.
I made a mistake.
I know it's wrong.
I tried to hide my guilt.
I just...
I thought, somehow, it might just go away.
but it didn't go away, did it, Russell?
speaking of which, frank, read him his rights.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
alexx, what did you get?
that the man from the collision car?
Yes, and he just admitted to strangling luis.
I just finished my post.
our lady driver was killed after the crash.
after the crash?
where does that leave us?
where does that leave us?
we've got one killer in custody and one on the loose.
this homicide was buried deep within the trauma.
now, these are the injuries she sustained in the crash.
the fractures radiate outward from the point of impact, to the back of her skull, and that's where things get weird.
instead of a radial fracture,
I found a compression, which couldn't have been caused by anything her head hit in the accident.
so she was hit her in the back of the head.
with something other than a fist.
Ah, what do you think the weapon was, Alexx?
Horatio, I don't know.
I'm going to have to shave her head and cast it to determine.
okay, and we need to go back to the car.
so this time, we approach it from the front.
that's right, from the front, where the killer must have stood.
this door was shut when you got to the scene, right?
Yeah, the window was blown out, and access to the door was blocked by a tree.
so the killer had to reach in through the windshield.
all windshields are made up of two pieces of glass held together in the middle by a layer of lyvinyl butyral.
it acts as an adhesive.
when her head hit the windshield, it blew through this layer...
but it wouldn't have been peeled out and curled around like this.
someone peeled it back.
rescue?
no.
no, rescue never touched the glass, but whoever did might have left some prints or some other trace.
I've got a diamond.
you sure it's not a piece of broken glass?
polished, precision-cut.
if it fell out of its setting, it could be part of a larger piece.
there was no mention of angela wearing a necklace or ring.
maybe the killer took it.
maybe we just got tive.
checking out the carat weight?
carat weight is its value in the real world, my friend.
I'm checking out its value to us.
which is?
the girdle.
excuse me?
on a diamond, the girdle is the rim that's formed at the top of the stone, and that's where they place the dia number.
right: Diamond index of america.
they registeall the high-quality diamonds.
they inscribe across the diamond with a laser.
so our diamond is registered?
Yep, and the dia will tell us exactly who the rightful owner is.
hello.
um... welcome to fieldcrest jewelers.
I'm chris kaiser.
is there something I can help you find?
actually, yes.
big day coming up for both of you, hmm?
no, we're with the crime lab.
Oh. Is everything okay?
Yeah, we're actually looking for the rest of this.
uh, yes, it seems to be a diamond from a piece that was stolen la night.
Afsana necklace, it's worth $4 million.
do you know this woman?
Yeah, that's Barbara.
you're certain that her name is Barbara?
it's not Angela?
no, Barbara.
she works here.
at least we know who she is.
Yeah, but not why she changed her identity?
I'm sorry, but why are you asking about her?
do you think she's the one that stole the necklace?
she was killed this morning.
what?
we think she was murdered.
that's impossible, I mean...
um... She was one of the nicest people.
who would do something like that?
we were actually hoping that you might have an idea.
no, um, she really kept to herself.
the necklace-- I have to ask: Did you...
no, but now that we know what it is, we'll alert the local pawn shops.
they'll be on the lookout.
Ah. Thank you.
if there's anything else I can do to help...
Ah, actually...
Barbara's address.
sure.
this is where the jewelry store owner says she lived.
somebody kicked the pet door in.
Yes, let's...
let's get that to the lab.
did you see that?
Yeah.
hold off on that a second.
hold off.
Hey, Danny?
Danny, you can come out. It's safe.
are you okay?
okay.
is there anyone else here, Danny?
no.
okay, where's your dad?
heaven.
your dad's in heaven.
okay, Danny,
I am a police officer, and it is safe to come out.
I want you to take my hand.
come on, pal.
good man.
come on.
that the victim's son with the social worker?
Yes, and he is terrified to talk.
abused?
possibly.
mother's a jewel thief and father's dead: That will screw up a kid.
Yes, that will do it.
ma'am, how's he doing?
I told him about his mother.
he's processing.
okay.
looks like he's been trained to remain silent.
seems like it.
so he's afraid of telling the truth?
it's possible.
fear levels off the chart.
we can't tell why.
this is going to be a difficult case.
thank you, ma'am.
Thanks, lieutenant.
miss boa vista...
are you okay?
Yeah.
no, I'm fine alexx, the casts.
on Barbara?
Yeah.
was on my way down to start.
okay, I want you to hold off so we can fluoroscope the body.
looking for anything special?
I am, but I don't want to lead you.
mm, keeps it interesting.
give me 30 minutes.
got it.
got a hit on the windshield?
well, we're getting there.
lucky to get anything at all.
luck had nothing to do with it.
hmm.
one dui; livein michigan.
let's find out what brought him to miami.
let's do that.
what are you doing in miami, mr. Benchley?
been a long winter in detroit.
thought I'd get a little miami sun.
but you're on probation.
I reported my whereabouts to my po.
that's how you found me.
how did your fingerprints get on barbara sommers'windshield?
that's her name?
poor lady.
answer the question, mr. Benchley.
I was on my way back from the mikasuki casino.
saw a car sitting there, so I pulled over to help.
are you okay?
she was dead.
so I called it in.
but didn't hang around.
didn't see the point.
or you were drunk when you were leaving the casino.
come on.
this long after?
breathalyzer won't register anything.
look, there was nothing I could do.
Really?
cause y could have killed her and stolen a $4 million necklace.
do I look like a guy that just came into a fortune?
I don't know, mr. Benchley.
but you don't look like a guy who's innocent.
Hey, natalia.
Hey.
Hey, how's the case going with the lady from the crash?
I hear you guys are stuck.
yore hearing a lot of things, aren't you?
Yeah. No, no, I get it that there's a mole in the lab, and I'm the new girl, so it must be me.
you're right.
it's silly.
let's start over, okay?
the case is weird.
well, if that's even her name.
her kid won't talk.
her identity keeps changing.
she stole this necklace, and someone killed her.
maybe her past caught up with her.
what does that mean?
nothing, it's just...
you know, some people have secret lives.
what kind ofecret lives?
I've already said enough, okay?
just try to think of her as a person.
Hey, wait a minute.
you know something you're not saying?
no.
you know, you say something like this, and you tell me you're not the mole, and I'm supposed to believe that.
I need to know the truth.
you know what?
forget I tried to help.
so what do we got?
I processed the pet door from barbara sommers' place.
okay, what'd you find?
nothing significant, except this.
is that some kind of metal shavings?
Yeah, and these are the sem results.
okay.
it's 92. 5% silver, 7.5% copper alloy.
I recognize this.
it's the properties of sterling silver.
sterling silver shavings.
makes perfect sense.
from the pet door? What's that mean?
it means that our jewelry store manager's lying.
you do engraving at the store, don't you?
is that against the law?
we found sterling silver residue inside Barbara's house.
she worked at a jewelry store.
as a clerk.
okay.
okay, so I went looking for the necklace.
but that's all.
were you going to hock it yourself?
no.
don't lie to me, Chris.
I'm telling the truth.
I was in a jam either way.
Why?
I hired the girl who ripped the store off.
we're insured, but it still looks bad.
I lose my job.
I just got promoted to manager.
I didn't kill her, I swear.
it's a $4 million necklace, Chris.
people have killed for less.
why didn't you report the thef when you first discovered it?
I told you, she was my hire.
it was on me.
so you were going to find it yourself.
you bitch, open this door!
I've already called the police, Chris.
I know you got it!
I know you took that necklace, and you're giving it back!
you bitch!
it was my only option.
I have one thing to say to you.
if you had reported it missing, then Barbara Sommers might still be alive.
and no necklace is worth that.
I downloaded the images from the traffic cam.
your victim's car.
God, what's she doing, 90, 100?
she's moving for sure.
wait a second. She's heading north.
so?
the accident happened in the southund lane.
I was wrong.
I think our victim might have had a conscience.
I fluoroscoped the body, Horatio. What I found made me sick.
I don't blame you, Alexx.
this is abuse.
ribs, nose, fingers, arms, ankles, soup to nuts.
I counted 14 breaks, and it couldn't have come from the crash because they've all healed.
beaten to within an inch of her life.
for years, judging from the density of the knitted bone.
this is why she was running, and this is why the boy won't talk.
lieutenant.
Natalia, Eric said you may have info on this case, and it's possible that she's part of an organization, an underground organization that protects abused women.
I think she is. I belong to the same thing.
I'm sorry.
it's an organization that prides itself on its anonymity.
but I think I can help.
okay.
this is obviously a big decision for you. Why don't you take some time with it?
give me an hour.
I'm going to call some of my contacts.
they're spread out everywhere; it's like a big family.
I understand.
thank you.
Horatio, we've got someone trying to move the necklace.
Frank, I'm on my way.
let me go!
pawning property isn't illegal.
it is when it's stolen.
look, I found it.
found it at a murder scene. That could make you an accessory.
so you want to take the question again?
I was on my way back into town from biscayne.
I came up on this wreck. She was already dead so what are you, a roadkill pirate?
I called in the accident. That's got to count for something.
what counts is your rap sheet.
we've got you on a string of robberies:
wallet from a pedestrian in a hit-and-run, cd player from another crash, set of water skis off an suv that broke down on highway 1.
I need you to tell me what you saw at the wreck site.
okay.
just before I stopped, a car was pulling away.
a silver car, like a sports car?
no, it was big, like a truck. Big.
like an suv?
the sun was in my eyes, but, yes, like an suv. can I go now?
let me see. How can I put this?
no. Officer, hang on to her for a second.
Frank, I've got to take this.
ms. Boa vista? - Lieutenant.
did you get something?
Yes, Barbara Sommers' married name.
it's Benchley.
ms. Benchley. - Does that mean anything?
that means that howard benchley drives an suv.
Howard, you neglected to tell us that barbara was your ex-wife.
didn't seem pertinent.
you honestly expect us to believe that?
look.
I hate the fact that she was ever my wife.
so I guess I block it out when talking about her.
Yes, and yet you came...
you came to miami to see her.
no, not her.
Danny. My son.
then what were you doing following her?
trying to get some dirt. Regain custody.
she's the crazy one.
Yes, and now she's the dead one, Howard, so, mission accomplished for you.
I didn't kill her.
everything's coming up roses for you, isn't it, Howard?
why don't you think about it in holding for a while.
guy's cagey.
there's one way to make him talk, Frank.
what's that?
find the murder weapon.
I'm stepping out for a bite. You want something?
no, no, I'm cool. - Okay.
you come in and look at this for one sec?
sure.
officers executed a warrant on Howard'car.
these were all the possessions that could have done the damage.
none of them are.
that's a plaster cast that alexx made of Barbara's head wound.
but none of howard's things fit.
he could have tossed what he used, but, uh...
he's an amateur, so I'm hoping he didn't.
I know what he used.
a gun.
first blow glanced off the side of her head, leaving a groove.
next one hit her bluntly.
the coup de grace: Edge of the handle.
all combined, it would have killed her.
but there were no guns found in either vehicle, or at the crime scene.
it's got to be somewher yeah.
I think it's time we questioned howard again.
well, maybe not.
wasn't the necklace recovered at a pnshop?
Yeah, maybe it's not the only thing she pawned.
looks like lunch is a drive-through.
already did my civic service today.
gave up a sweet sheet of ice.
Ah, come on, I know you love the repeat business.
why do I think this ends badly for me?
well, it depends on how helpful you are.
when Rita pawned the necklace, that wasn't all she had, was it?
make it easy on yourself. - I know how many hot, unregistered guns you've got in there.
now, why would you go say something like that?
I'm guessing Rita pawned a gun.
you give me the one I'm looking for, we're good.
okay. She pawned a nine-millimeter.
see? That wasn't so hard.
pawnshop guy said he wiped it down before he planned to move it.
you know, no one wants to buy dirty gun.
well, there's pawnshop clean, and th there's csi clean, if you had a gun, why wouldn't you fire it?
if it wasn't loaded.
and how would you know it wasn't loaded?
check the magazine.
bingo.
see ya.
you won't believe me, but I didn't come to town to kill her.
you're right. I don't believe you.
I just wanted to see her.
to get her back. I was the only man for her.
but she disagreed with you.
she just needed convincing.
so in order to convince her, you killed her,
she was past help.
and ditching Danny?
I did her a favor.
typical barb
keeps a gun for protection, then forgets to load it.
Where's Danny?!
your as bad a mother as you were a wife!
leave me alone...
you've made your son an orphan.
he's still got a dad.
at this point, Howard, he doesn't think so.
barb told him I was dead?
that's correct, and I understand her instinct.
well, legally, I am still that boy's father.
that is true. But being someone's father...
is not a right; it's a gift.
take him.
hey?
let it go.
look, I'm sorry.
for what?
for things that I couldn't have known.
well, then, why the apology?
because I think you deserve one.
I heard how you helped break the case. Barbara's background.
well, uh, it's still stuff at happened in my past that's not your fault.
well, earlier today is the past.
so, I'm sorry.
accepted.
are you safe now?
he-he's in jail.
I'm okay, Eric.
and, you know, we're okay.
good. Okay.
well, some things you can count on. - Yeah.
Danny, I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you're going to be okay.
my mom was killed, just like yours.
Really? - Yeah.
you mean by your dad?
I do.
I do mean by my dad.
so...
so I want you to know that you're not alone.
you really do know what it's like.
I also want you to know that I am going to be right in there every day if you need to talk.
all right?
good man.
you, too.
you too, partner.
it's the last day for closing arguments in the murder trial of Stephen Rowe.
accused in the disappearance and murder of his wife, Melissa, whose body has never been found.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
Melissa hasn't used her credit cards or withdrawn money from any of her bank accounts or even contacted her father in over six months.
clearly, we have cessation of life.
I have a title for Ms. West's case against Stephen.
evidence of things not seen.
cause I don't see anything.
a gift from her father when she began culinary school.
it's part of a set.
that's why Mr. Rowe had to put it back.
unfortunately for him, he didn't put all of it back.
the tip broken off when he stabbed her.
the marriage was unhappy.
and, yes, Stephen was having an affair.
he met Allison Grady and found true love.
no crime in that.
but ask yourselves:
why kill your wife when divorce is an option?
divorce was never an option for Mr. Rowe.
that would make him the bad guy.
and for a man who refuses to hold a job, alimony would be fatal.
it would be much easier to slice your wife up and throw her remains into the ocean.
Melissa Rowe was missing three days.
three. - before he called the police.
finally, consider the four 20-pound dumbbells curiously missing from Mr. Rowe's personal set.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
no body means Mr. Rowe had enough weight.
when you go behind those doors, there's only one question you need to ask:
do you want to send a young man to death row based on things not seen?
jury Foreman, has the jury reached a unanimous decision on the issue that was submitted to you?
Yes, Your Honor.
if you'll give the verdict to the deputy, please.
if the defendant would please stand.
in The State of Florida Stephen Rowe,on the charge of murder in the first degree of Melissa Rowe...
we find the defendant...
not guilty.
all right.
looks like a fisherman just found Melissa Rowe's body.
the bad news is, the verdict's already in.
the verdict is in, Frank, but the jury is out.
police believe the body of Melissa Rowe was found this morning by a local fisherman.
is that her, Alexx?
she was in the water a long time, Horatio.
it'll be hard to determine what was degradation from injury.
I'll call you from the office when I confirm her ID.
no, need, Alexx.
that's Melissa's favorite dress.
gentlemen.
let get her to Autopsy.
did you get anything in the water
no. No weights. She was drifting free.
okay. It won't be far from where you found her.
won't stop looking till I find them.
all right.
officer.
let him go.
Mr. Bowman. Is... is it?
Mr. Bowman, I... No, it is. - is it my daughter?
I won't know till I confirm the DNA, but I...
I think it's Melissa.
Mr. Bowman.
you have to let me see her. Mr. Bowman.
no, I... I need to know.
I gotta know. Mr. Bowman, listen to me.
I want you to stay here with me.
Mr. Bowman.
stay here with me.
we need to go, boys.
what do I do now, Lieutenant?
let's remember Melissa the way she was.
all right?
let's do that.
Oh, my gosh, why is it so cold in here?
I don't want to lose what little of her I've got.
when you pull a body out of the water, putrefaction goes into overdrive.
well, tell me you at least have have enough for cause of death.
don't know yet.
what I can tell you is, her fingers were cut off.
are you sure it wasn't the wildlife?
no. They only go for the meaty parts.
the lips, ears.
the fish finished the job, but someone got them started.
I'm hoping her legs can tell us something.
looks like the panty hose kept everything together.
what woman wears panty hose in Miami?
her husband said she was going to a club the night she disappeared.
that is exactly my point.
I do not believe one word that man says.
maybe you can find something once the panty hose dry out.
adipocere.
I thought that only formed in fatty tissue.
there's a little bit of fat everywhere in the body.
water kills most bacteria except the ones that digest fat.
they excrete the adipocere.
the soapy material coats nearby tissue protecting it from decay, sometimes for years.
so the panty hose kept the water from wearing away the adipocere, and that preserved her thighs.
Yeah. Sharp force trauma.
based on the tears in her dress, poor baby girl has wounds like these all over her body.
tissue is too degraded to compare it to our knife.
well, I know that this sounds terrible, but let's hope he cut her to the bone.
how's it going with the toolmarks from the Rowe case?
I'm comparing the stria from a cast of Melissa's femur to a test mark of the knife from the trial.
I see you went virtual with the Micro-CT. Mm-hmm.
it's the murder weapon.
that knife made the indentation on Melissa's femur three times.
even with the broken tip?
the tip must've broken off before the attack.
why would Rowe use a broken knife for the murder?
so what does this get us?
double jeopardy. - even with the new evidence, we can't retry for the same case.
whose idea was it to go to trial without a body?
the state attorney thought the case was solid enough.
Rowe didn't waive the time, so we didn't have the time.
those the missing dumbbells.
Rowe used to weigh Melissa's body down?
look, if you don't move, I'm gonna have you arrested for obstruction.
simple yes or no.
look, I'm not Ryan, Erica, okay?
you just did.
lieutenant Caine.
hope you're here to return my stuff.
sure would like my laptop back.
got quite a spread here.
this is my family's house, Lieutenant.
is that a fact?
did you buy that rock on your finger yourself, too?
I'm paying her back.
with your dead wife's policy.
were you just in the neighborhood, thought you'd stop by for a little police harassment?
no, actually, we've recovered the weights that you used to sink Melissa with.
a jury found him innocent.
never confuse an acquittal with innocence.
just leave us alone.
the press hounds us, you cops drive by every night.
we just want to get on with our lives. So did Melissa.
you know what, Caine?
you shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.
everyone's got Melissa with a halo on her head.
but she wasn't who you thought she was.
is that why you killed her?
I didn't kill Melissa.
now, get off my property.
so Horatio said something to Rowe, got him all worked up.
his lawyer wants all the evidence back.
I liked your Erica Sikes exclusive about finding Rowe's weights.
I didn't say any of that to her.
she made it all up.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Oh, that's right, I said the same thing.
give it a rest, Wolfe.
equal time, bro, equal time.
look, you're supposed to be going through the files on Rowe's laptop.
didn't bother. It's already documented.
that's how we found out Rowe was having an affair.
Horatio wanted you to review...
what I did do was go through the files that weren't in the laptop.
I'm not following you.
just 'cause you hit delete doesn't mean the file's gone.
it's still on your hard-drive.
the space is relabeled as available, but the file's still there.
sometimes, it takes a long time for things to save over it.
that's how I found these.
looks like he was nervous we'd find his white sheet with the pointy hat.
Rowe was a white supremacist?
while he clearly didn't embrace our African brethren, I think his interests were a little more narrow.
genealogy, family genetics.
looks like he was worried about how his kids were going to turn out.
definitely wanted white ones.
then, I guess we just found out what Melissa's little secret is.
Melissa's mother died when she was nine months old.
we just never talked about her.
stephen found out that Melissa's mom was black after they were married.
they only dated a month, then eloped to Vegas.
Mr. Bowman, when exactly did he find out?
when I met him.
a week after they came back from the wedding.
how could you lie to me about that?
I'm sorry, Stephen.
I just don't go telling everyone I'm half black.
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't either.
it's not like that.
why does it matter?
why does it matter?
what are our kids going to look like?
I don't know.
like me.
what? A half-breed?
damn it!
that bastard belongs in jail.
you know what?
I've got an idea.
lieutenant Caine.
miss West.
you went over my head and brought in a federal prosecutor?
miss West, I have evidence that Mr. Rowe was involved in Melissa's murder, but I need to act on it right now.
on what grounds?
I believe her killing was racially motivated.
a hate crime?
you're never going to sell that to a jury.
I don't agree. Lieutenant.
Yes, sir? Good work.
I see where you're going with this, but Rowe was married to the victim.
Yes, but he didn't know her racial status till after they were married.
okay, Lieutenant, you want to pursue this, get me something definitive.
we need a slam dunk.
thank you.
this is a waste of time.
bring us cases we can win.
Yes, ma'am?
for a perfect murder, there's a lot that doesn't make sense.
I'm listening.
why use a broken knife to kill someone?
question is, where is the other piece?
and I could ask the same question about the weights.
Delko only recovered two of the four missing from Rowe's set.
it's like there's a piece of the crime missing.
so is Stephen hiding another murder?
are you thinking that he used the same knife and weights to kill someone else before?
and was he practicing for Melissa?
practice makes perfect.
Yes, it does.
we have our killer.
we need to find our victim.
Mr. Wolfe.
this is impossible.
how do you find Mr. Rowe's first victim when you know nothing about her?
I want to stay focused on Mr. Rowe.
okay.
stephen Rowe discovered Melissa's racial status on March 26th.
and she disappeared on October 5th.
so those are the six months we need to look at. That's right.
so we got to find where he worked, where he lived, where he ate sushi.
ASAP.
are you finished with the vics?
Yeah.
so the stars are all the female victims in the area during the six months we're worried about.
and this database is the entire life of Stephen Rowe that you've compiled from six months of credit card receipts?
Yeah.
okay, let's see where they intersect.
the dots indicate all the events in Rowe's life.
and when they overlap with a star, that means that Rowe might have a relationship with the female victim.
especially if the victim's murder looks a lot like Melissa's.
that one's near his old address.
missing since May 15th.
water dump.
Yeah, the body surfaced only a couple days later, and the C.O.D. was sharp force trauma.
that's only two months after Rowe discovered that Melissa's mother was black.
pull up the status of that case.
Ryan, this case is pending.
Opa-Locka P.D. has arrested one Ethan Gaffney.
he's in custody.
the murder looks an awful lot like Melissa's.
maybe Opa-Locka has the wrong guy.
Debra Massey was my student.
your student?
Yeah, I'm a pilot.
I give flying lessons.
Mr. Gaffney, do you know a Stephen Rowe?
Yeah, yeah, from the news.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you trying to pin the Rowe murder on me?
what, he walks on his wife's murder, so now you go looking for a sacrificial lamb?
is that it? We're trying to determine if there's a connection between the two cases.
wait a minute.
damn, I get it.
you think he killed the lady I'm in for.
just relax. We're just asking questions here.
but that makes sense.
see, I had nothing to do with Debra's death.
I'm as innocent as the day is long.
Opa-Locka P. D. must have had some reason to arrest you.
I have the luck of being the last to see her alive.
I told them, flying lesson was over, she went home.
they didn't believe me.
well, Mr. Gaffney, we'll look for some evidence we all can believe.
Debra was stabbed, but they never found the knife.
maybe because Stephen Rowe had it all the time.
only tool marks will tell.
they didn't say anything about the bones in the autopsy findings.
probably didn't look.
then I think we need to.
if she was in the water, too, how come she looks so much better than Stephen Rowe's wife?
she was only in the water a couple of days before the gases brought her up.
until she was buried, she was on ice, which makes my job a whole lot easier.
Debra's not missing any fingers.
that's not like Melissa.
Yeah, but like Melissa, Debra was stabbed.
she was also weighted down.
you think this is Rowe's practice murder?
those are ligature marks around her ankles.
can't tell from what.
if I can get a clear image,
I'll let Horatio know.
okay.
tool marks on Debra's bones were from narrower blade than Melissa's were, and they were more slashes than stabs.
so this is not the blade with the broken tip.
no.
Debra's edge was more flat, hollow grind, like a box cutter.
Melissa was a tapered knife.
and that means that Debra and Melissa were killed by different knives.
both were weighted down and dumped in a lake.
Debra floated up, but Melissa stayed put.
Yes, so someone is learning from their mistakes.
but was it Rowe making those mistakes, Horatio?
whatever was used to tie Debra Massey down left a unique mark in the skin.
now, I couldn't make it out at first, until I used oblique lighting.
a timing chain made that mark.
it's used in airplane engines.
ladies, I believe we have a suspect who can enlighten us.
you gave Debra Massey flying lessons.
you work with airplanes.
do you recognize the chain, It's unique.
it's found in motorcycles, snowmobiles and your airplane.
it's called a silent chain.
well, it's talking now, isn't it?
you used this chain to tie weights to Debra Massey's ankles.
Mr. Gaffney, you killed Debra.
this is your chance to help yourself.
okay, look...
I need you to understand something, cause those Opa-Locka detectives won't listen to me.
I didn't set out to kill Debra.
she was hitting on me.
when she freaked out, I overreacted.
come on... Just... No!
Hey, come on, let finish your flying lesson.
shut up.
she wouldn't stop screaming.
people were going to hear.
I had to shut her up.
Hey, for the record, I didn't have anything to do with that Rowe chick.
I just don't want those papers to start printing those lies again.
what lies?
they made me out to be some kind of Hannibal Lecter, I didn't do that. I'm not a monster.
I don't think Debra would agree with that.
Eric, the articles from Debra Massey's murder. - go back through them.
so, what do you think this article's about?
victim's name withheld.
these look like... Melissa Rowe's murder.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
everything reads like Melissa, but her fingers are cut off.
this is Debra Massey's murder.
this is before Gaffney was arrested.
Yeah. Describes the murder as being perfect,
only they misreported that her fingers had been removed.
so Rowe read everything he could about Debra Massey, copied it to the letter with Melissa to make the police think Gaffney did it.
but he practiced on someone else first, and they'll also be missing their fingers.
okay, so we need to find a body without any fingers.
problem. None of the unsolveds have missing digits.
I'm going to talk to someone who knows Rowe. Who's that? His old roommate.
you used to be Stephen Rowe's roommate?
man... you guys never give up.
read the trial transcripts.
I don't got any new answers for you.
well, I think we have different questions.
so, you said that after Stephen got married, he still came to your poker games?
Yeah. I already answered that one.
did Melissa ever come with him?
she came for a while, but then they both stopped.
why, do you think?
this is why Stevie could never hurt a woman.
he likes them too much.
did Melissa catch him with another woman?
not at the game.
he was talking to another tenant here.
Melissa overreacted.
does this woman still live here?
now, you see, if I answer that one,
I know what you'll be thinking, and you'll be wrong.
what would be wrong is you not answering the question.
her name is Theresa Barton.
she moved out, left all her stuff, didn't tell anyone.
sounds a lot like Theresa Barton went missing.
anyone call it in?
I don't know.
the manager may have, but people come and go around here all the time.
he gave her a month. No calls.
he put her stuff in storage.
Stevie had nothing to do with this Barton chick.
I think we're going to answer that one.
want to guess when Theresa Barton disappeared?
inside our timeline?
three months after Stephen decided to get rid of Melissa and a month after the Massey murder articles were published.
did you call Horatio yet?
so, this is all the stuff from Theresa Barton's storage?
Yeah.
she's a pretty girl.
let's have Tripp follow up on this membership at Carlyle's Cinema Rental.
she has a movie rental card?
Yeah.
that's weird.
Theresa doesn't have a DVD player or a VCR.
let me see this.
you know, the only time I've ever seen a card look like this...
when it's used to open a locked door.
I bet if we call Carlyle's, the account number will have Stephen Rowe's name on it.
you confirm that. I'm going to call Horatio and have him pick up Rowe at his girlfriend's house.
I think we just found Rowe's practice murder.
that is blood.
ms. Grady, are you here?
he's already gone, Frank.
well, somebody's blood is still here.
do you think it's Allison's?
we went to your girlfriend's house but instead we found her blood.
you know, every time something goes wrong in this town, you can't come running for me.
Where's Allison?
like I told you, last time I saw her, she was at home.
Yes, which is where you cut her.
that was an accident.
aren't they all?
look!
Allison hit me.
she cut herself on a broken picture frame.
I tried to go help her.
she told me to leave her alone, so I did.
she's probably off shopping, trying to cool off right now.
look, with any absence of any wrongdoing...
we found out.
I don't know a Theresa Barton.
Yes, you do; you used her as your practice victim.
that's quite a stretch.
you know, you can't just connect me with some random woman just 'cause you want to.
we recovered your video rental card
the one you used to break into her apartment.
you got a body this time, Caine?
I don't need a body.
officer.
H, that print we lifted from Allison's blood at her house?
I matched it to the ten cards from the Rowe investigation.
Melissa's father.
are we sure Allison's in here, Frank?
we haven't spotted her yet.
Bowman's here. He won't come out.
okay.
you take the back.
I'll take the front.
Mr. Bowman?
Mr. Bowman, it's Horatio Caine.
I just want to talk.
MR.BOWMAN: Are you okay? Are you okay?
there you go, Melissa, there you go!
keep pedaling.
she kept falling off that damn bike...
but she always got back on.
you're doing great. That's great, honey.
no matter how bad it got, she got back on.
that's why she's dead.
Allison's dead?
is that what you're telling me?
no.
all right! There you go, there you go.
she wouldn't give up on Stephen.
keep going straight. Keep pedaling.
no matter what he did to her.
I didn't save my girl, but I saved Allison.
and that's a good thing, Mr. Bowman.
it's a good thing.
I didn't go there to do a good thing.
I went there to kill that bastard.
did he hurt you?
we got to get you out of here before he comes back.
let go of me! Listen to me, listen to me!
if you don't leave now, he will kill you.
get up!
move.
she didn't understand I wanted to help her.
Mr. Bowman, you kidnapped her.
if I saved her life, do you think I care if I go to prison?
where is she?
she'll just go back to him.
daddy, look, look, I'm riding!
going back...
is her choice, just like Melissa's.
you did not fail them.
I did fail my daughter.
I just want my little girl back.
I know you do.
we found the girl.
okay, Frank.
okay.
daddy, look! Look, Daddy, look!
look at me!
you're doing great!
that's great, honey!
thank you, Lieutenant.
he was going to kill me.
believe it or not, ma'am, he was trying to help you.
can I just go home to Stephen?
stephen is under arrest.
stephen didn't hurt me.
it was an accident.
this has nothing to do with you.
I don't understand.
why are you holding him?
because Stephen, ma'am, is a killer.
excuse me.
Horatio, we still haven't found Theresa Barton's body...
Frank, we've got 72 hours before Stephen is released and disappears.
Hey.
what you said earlier about these Massey articles got me thinking.
you mean how Rowe studied them for his murders?
I think you know where Theresa Barton's body is.
I do?
Yeah, well, if he followed these articles to a "T,"
where was Massey's body dumped?
Silmar Lake.
then that's where we'll find Rowe's practice victim.
things change fast in Miami.
could I help you gentlemen?
Yeah. Yeah, you can.
there used to be a lake here, and we think there was a body dumped in it.
Yeah, well, we drained it a few months ago and filled it up with trash, and nobody found no body.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't if you weren't looking for it, but we will be.
not now, you're not.
if I shut down, I lose ten grand a minute.
all right, well, you want to lose another ten arguing about it, or do you want to let us get to work?
I get how the thing sees different layers underground, but how is it going to pick up a body?
it's a landfill, she's covered in trash.
it's the same way, it kicks out the electromagnetic waves, they bounce back, and the computer creates a cross-section of what's below.
now, if I see a bump...
bump means we got a body. Right.
wait a minute, stop.
back up about a foot.
this is where we start digging.
what are we looking at?
it could be Theresa Barton.
I'll learn more at the post.
we can compare her to a DNA sample of her belongings.
okay. Okay, her fingers are missing.
one similarity to Melissa Rowe.
okay, there's another similarity.
those are Stephen Rowe's missing dumbbells.
all right, all we need now is the knife tip.
it's a match, Stephen.
so you have the tip of a knife.
my lawyer got me off the first time, he'll get me off again.
actually, Stephen,
I have quite a bit more than the tip of a knife.
I have Theresa Barton's body with the tip of the knife in it.
we found her, buried in the bottom of a lake bed.
you chose Theresa randomly, didn't you?
do you live in the building?
I come here to play poker.
my old roommate lives here.
Oh, that's great.
the problem is, Stephen, is that you didn't do your homework.
the press got it wrong.
Debra Massey's fingers were not, I repeat, not cut off.
you have my lawyer's number.
Stephen, I don't even think your lawyer is going to take this case.
here are the pantyhose from the drying shed you asked for.
Thanks, Paula.
even in that bag, it stunk up the whole lab.
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought Horatio already nailed Stephen Rowe.
he's on ice.
but Horatio still wants to build the federal case for the hate crime.
I was just waiting for these to dry out to tie up Melissa's loose ends.
what's that?
it's a fingernail.
well, that must've hurt.
lucky some skin was still attached to your fingernail.
usually, there's no viable DNA.
Hey, Valera, let me ask you,
if you saw a woman wearing pantyhose in Miami, what would you think? Hooker.
or from out of town.
my money's on whoever redressed Melissa is not a Miami native.
I thought this case was closed.
I compared the DNA to the blood we found at the house.
I never thought...
this case just reopened.
you are not from Miami originally, are you?
Connecticut.
my family gave me the house here, so I moved down.
what does this have to do why we found pantyhose on Melissa's body.
young women from Miami don't wear them.
Yes, and why you redressed her for a night out in Connecticut.
what?
I didn't redress Melissa.
I had nothing do with her.
then explain the fingernail that we found in her pantyhose.
Oh, God.
okay... I did redress her.
I didn't want to.
stephen made me.
that's all I did.
that already makes you an accessory to murder.
what was I supposed to do?
I was terrified.
if I said anything, I would wind up like her.
now listen to me.
we need to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we're going to have to find some things to add to the dress.
Allison, you did more than redress her.
look, you don't know what really happened.
no one else was there.
stephen was there, Allison.
stephen is meeting with the assistant state attorney as we speak.
I don't understand.
he's cutting a deal.
with what? With you.
Oh, my God.
he's such a coward.
he promised me.
he chickened out on killing Melissa, didn't he?
the whole point of the other girl was to get rid of Melissa.
I can't.
that girl's face, I can't get it out of my head.
you promised we'd be together.
I'll figure something else out.
you mean, you'll leave it to me to figure something else out.
that's what he never understood.
that there was no other way.
he said there was no way he was going to stay married to a black girl, and Melissa wasn't going to give him a divorce.
so you took the knife from the practice murder.
it was easy.
called her, told her if she wanted to know who her husband was sleeping with to come over.
I'm so sorry you had to find out this way.
we love each other.
I told you that I would take care of it.
we've got to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we got to find something to add to her dress, okay?
sometimes you have to fight for what you want.
Yes, well...
now you can fight for your own life.
Theresa Barton-- what are these?
ms. West, you asked me to deliver you a case that you can win, and now, you have three.
wow, a trifecta.
Yeah.
good job, Lieutenant.
is that another one?
this one is for Melissa's father.
I'm hoping it will bring him some peace.
for the Feds.
Yeah.
how are you going to do that?
well, Allison's testimony makes Melissa's death Stephen's hate crime.
we already have him for Theresa Barton.
isn't that overkill?
hate doesn't trouble you, Ms. West?
of course, it does.
I'm glad to hear that...
because hate should trouble us all.
it's the last day for closing arguments in the murder trial of Stephen Rowe.
accused in the disappearance and murder of his wife, Melissa, whose body has never been found.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
Melissa hasn't used her credit cards or withdrawn money from any of her bank accounts or even contacted her father in over six months.
clearly, we have cessation of life.
I have a title for Ms. West's case against Stephen.
evidence of things not seen.
cause I don't see anything.
a gift from her father when she began culinary school.
it's part of a set.
that's why Mr. Rowe had to put it back.
unfortunately for him, he didn't put all of it back.
the tip broken off when he stabbed her.
the marriage was unhappy.
and, yes, Stephen was having an affair.
he met Allison Grady and found true love.
no crime in that.
but ask yourselves:
why kill your wife when divorce is an option?
divorce was never an option for Mr. Rowe.
that would make him the bad guy.
and for a man who refuses to hold a job, alimony would be fatal.
it would be much easier to slice your wife up and throw her remains into the ocean.
Melissa Rowe was missing three days.
three. - before he called the police.
finally, consider the four 20-pound dumbbells curiously missing from Mr. Rowe's personal set.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
no body means Mr. Rowe had enough weight.
when you go behind those doors, there's only one question you need to ask:
do you want to send a young man to death row based on things not seen?
jury Foreman, has the jury reached a unanimous decision on the issue that was submitted to you?
Yes, Your Honor.
if you'll give the verdict to the deputy, please.
if the defendant would please stand.
in The State of Florida Stephen Rowe,on the charge of murder in the first degree of Melissa Rowe...
we find the defendant...
not guilty.
all right.
looks like a fisherman just found Melissa Rowe's body.
the bad news is, the verdict's already in.
the verdict is in, Frank, but the jury is out.
police believe the body of Melissa Rowe was found this morning by a local fisherman.
is that her, Alexx?
she was in the water a long time, Horatio.
it'll be hard to determine what was degradation from injury.
I'll call you from the office when I confirm her ID.
no, need, Alexx.
that's Melissa's favorite dress.
gentlemen.
let get her to Autopsy.
did you get anything in the water
no. No weights. She was drifting free.
okay. It won't be far from where you found her.
won't stop looking till I find them.
all right.
officer.
let him go.
Mr. Bowman. Is... is it?
Mr. Bowman, I... No, it is. - is it my daughter?
I won't know till I confirm the DNA, but I...
I think it's Melissa.
Mr. Bowman.
you have to let me see her. Mr. Bowman.
no, I... I need to know.
I gotta know. Mr. Bowman, listen to me.
I want you to stay here with me.
Mr. Bowman.
stay here with me.
we need to go, boys.
what do I do now, Lieutenant?
let's remember Melissa the way she was.
all right?
let's do that.
Oh, my gosh, why is it so cold in here?
I don't want to lose what little of her I've got.
when you pull a body out of the water, putrefaction goes into overdrive.
well, tell me you at least have have enough for cause of death.
don't know yet.
what I can tell you is, her fingers were cut off.
are you sure it wasn't the wildlife?
no. They only go for the meaty parts.
the lips, ears.
the fish finished the job, but someone got them started.
I'm hoping her legs can tell us something.
looks like the panty hose kept everything together.
what woman wears panty hose in Miami?
her husband said she was going to a club the night she disappeared.
that is exactly my point.
I do not believe one word that man says.
maybe you can find something once the panty hose dry out.
adipocere.
I thought that only formed in fatty tissue.
there's a little bit of fat everywhere in the body.
water kills most bacteria except the ones that digest fat.
they excrete the adipocere.
the soapy material coats nearby tissue protecting it from decay, sometimes for years.
so the panty hose kept the water from wearing away the adipocere, and that preserved her thighs.
Yeah. Sharp force trauma.
based on the tears in her dress, poor baby girl has wounds like these all over her body.
tissue is too degraded to compare it to our knife.
well, I know that this sounds terrible, but let's hope he cut her to the bone.
how's it going with the toolmarks from the Rowe case?
I'm comparing the stria from a cast of Melissa's femur to a test mark of the knife from the trial.
I see you went virtual with the Micro-CT. Mm-hmm.
it's the murder weapon.
that knife made the indentation on Melissa's femur three times.
even with the broken tip?
the tip must've broken off before the attack.
why would Rowe use a broken knife for the murder?
so what does this get us?
double jeopardy. - even with the new evidence, we can't retry for the same case.
whose idea was it to go to trial without a body?
the state attorney thought the case was solid enough.
Rowe didn't waive the time, so we didn't have the time.
those the missing dumbbells.
Rowe used to weigh Melissa's body down?
look, if you don't move, I'm gonna have you arrested for obstruction.
simple yes or no.
look, I'm not Ryan, Erica, okay?
you just did.
lieutenant Caine.
hope you're here to return my stuff.
sure would like my laptop back.
got quite a spread here.
this is my family's house, Lieutenant.
is that a fact?
did you buy that rock on your finger yourself, too?
I'm paying her back.
with your dead wife's policy.
were you just in the neighborhood, thought you'd stop by for a little police harassment?
no, actually, we've recovered the weights that you used to sink Melissa with.
a jury found him innocent.
never confuse an acquittal with innocence.
just leave us alone.
the press hounds us, you cops drive by every night.
we just want to get on with our lives. So did Melissa.
you know what, Caine?
you shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.
everyone's got Melissa with a halo on her head.
but she wasn't who you thought she was.
is that why you killed her?
I didn't kill Melissa.
now, get off my property.
so Horatio said something to Rowe, got him all worked up.
his lawyer wants all the evidence back.
I liked your Erica Sikes exclusive about finding Rowe's weights.
I didn't say any of that to her.
she made it all up.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Oh, that's right, I said the same thing.
give it a rest, Wolfe.
equal time, bro, equal time.
look, you're supposed to be going through the files on Rowe's laptop.
didn't bother. It's already documented.
that's how we found out Rowe was having an affair.
Horatio wanted you to review...
what I did do was go through the files that weren't in the laptop.
I'm not following you.
just 'cause you hit delete doesn't mean the file's gone.
it's still on your hard-drive.
the space is relabeled as available, but the file's still there.
sometimes, it takes a long time for things to save over it.
that's how I found these.
looks like he was nervous we'd find his white sheet with the pointy hat.
Rowe was a white supremacist?
while he clearly didn't embrace our African brethren, I think his interests were a little more narrow.
genealogy, family genetics.
looks like he was worried about how his kids were going to turn out.
definitely wanted white ones.
then, I guess we just found out what Melissa's little secret is.
Melissa's mother died when she was nine months old.
we just never talked about her.
stephen found out that Melissa's mom was black after they were married.
they only dated a month, then eloped to Vegas.
Mr. Bowman, when exactly did he find out?
when I met him.
a week after they came back from the wedding.
how could you lie to me about that?
I'm sorry, Stephen.
I just don't go telling everyone I'm half black.
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't either.
it's not like that.
why does it matter?
why does it matter?
what are our kids going to look like?
I don't know.
like me.
what? A half-breed?
damn it!
that bastard belongs in jail.
you know what?
I've got an idea.
lieutenant Caine.
miss West.
you went over my head and brought in a federal prosecutor?
miss West, I have evidence that Mr. Rowe was involved in Melissa's murder, but I need to act on it right now.
on what grounds?
I believe her killing was racially motivated.
a hate crime?
you're never going to sell that to a jury.
I don't agree. Lieutenant.
Yes, sir? Good work.
I see where you're going with this, but Rowe was married to the victim.
Yes, but he didn't know her racial status till after they were married.
okay, Lieutenant, you want to pursue this, get me something definitive.
we need a slam dunk.
thank you.
this is a waste of time.
bring us cases we can win.
Yes, ma'am?
for a perfect murder, there's a lot that doesn't make sense.
I'm listening.
why use a broken knife to kill someone?
question is, where is the other piece?
and I could ask the same question about the weights.
Delko only recovered two of the four missing from Rowe's set.
it's like there's a piece of the crime missing.
so is Stephen hiding another murder?
are you thinking that he used the same knife and weights to kill someone else before?
and was he practicing for Melissa?
practice makes perfect.
Yes, it does.
we have our killer.
we need to find our victim.
Mr. Wolfe.
this is impossible.
how do you find Mr. Rowe's first victim when you know nothing about her?
I want to stay focused on Mr. Rowe.
okay.
stephen Rowe discovered Melissa's racial status on March 26th.
and she disappeared on October 5th.
so those are the six months we need to look at. That's right.
so we got to find where he worked, where he lived, where he ate sushi.
ASAP.
are you finished with the vics?
Yeah.
so the stars are all the female victims in the area during the six months we're worried about.
and this database is the entire life of Stephen Rowe that you've compiled from six months of credit card receipts?
Yeah.
okay, let's see where they intersect.
the dots indicate all the events in Rowe's life.
and when they overlap with a star, that means that Rowe might have a relationship with the female victim.
especially if the victim's murder looks a lot like Melissa's.
that one's near his old address.
missing since May 15th.
water dump.
Yeah, the body surfaced only a couple days later, and the C.O.D. was sharp force trauma.
that's only two months after Rowe discovered that Melissa's mother was black.
pull up the status of that case.
Ryan, this case is pending.
Opa-Locka P.D. has arrested one Ethan Gaffney.
he's in custody.
the murder looks an awful lot like Melissa's.
maybe Opa-Locka has the wrong guy.
Debra Massey was my student.
your student?
Yeah, I'm a pilot.
I give flying lessons.
Mr. Gaffney, do you know a Stephen Rowe?
Yeah, yeah, from the news.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you trying to pin the Rowe murder on me?
what, he walks on his wife's murder, so now you go looking for a sacrificial lamb?
is that it? We're trying to determine if there's a connection between the two cases.
wait a minute.
damn, I get it.
you think he killed the lady I'm in for.
just relax. We're just asking questions here.
but that makes sense.
see, I had nothing to do with Debra's death.
I'm as innocent as the day is long.
Opa-Locka P. D. must have had some reason to arrest you.
I have the luck of being the last to see her alive.
I told them, flying lesson was over, she went home.
they didn't believe me.
well, Mr. Gaffney, we'll look for some evidence we all can believe.
Debra was stabbed, but they never found the knife.
maybe because Stephen Rowe had it all the time.
only tool marks will tell.
they didn't say anything about the bones in the autopsy findings.
probably didn't look.
then I think we need to.
if she was in the water, too, how come she looks so much better than Stephen Rowe's wife?
she was only in the water a couple of days before the gases brought her up.
until she was buried, she was on ice, which makes my job a whole lot easier.
Debra's not missing any fingers.
that's not like Melissa.
Yeah, but like Melissa, Debra was stabbed.
she was also weighted down.
you think this is Rowe's practice murder?
those are ligature marks around her ankles.
can't tell from what.
if I can get a clear image,
I'll let Horatio know.
okay.
tool marks on Debra's bones were from narrower blade than Melissa's were, and they were more slashes than stabs.
so this is not the blade with the broken tip.
no.
Debra's edge was more flat, hollow grind, like a box cutter.
Melissa was a tapered knife.
and that means that Debra and Melissa were killed by different knives.
both were weighted down and dumped in a lake.
Debra floated up, but Melissa stayed put.
Yes, so someone is learning from their mistakes.
but was it Rowe making those mistakes, Horatio?
whatever was used to tie Debra Massey down left a unique mark in the skin.
now, I couldn't make it out at first, until I used oblique lighting.
a timing chain made that mark.
it's used in airplane engines.
ladies, I believe we have a suspect who can enlighten us.
you gave Debra Massey flying lessons.
you work with airplanes.
do you recognize the chain, It's unique.
it's found in motorcycles, snowmobiles and your airplane.
it's called a silent chain.
well, it's talking now, isn't it?
you used this chain to tie weights to Debra Massey's ankles.
Mr. Gaffney, you killed Debra.
this is your chance to help yourself.
okay, look...
I need you to understand something, cause those Opa-Locka detectives won't listen to me.
I didn't set out to kill Debra.
she was hitting on me.
when she freaked out, I overreacted.
come on... Just... No!
Hey, come on, let finish your flying lesson.
shut up.
she wouldn't stop screaming.
people were going to hear.
I had to shut her up.
Hey, for the record, I didn't have anything to do with that Rowe chick.
I just don't want those papers to start printing those lies again.
what lies?
they made me out to be some kind of Hannibal Lecter, I didn't do that. I'm not a monster.
I don't think Debra would agree with that.
Eric, the articles from Debra Massey's murder. - go back through them.
so, what do you think this article's about?
victim's name withheld.
these look like... Melissa Rowe's murder.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
everything reads like Melissa, but her fingers are cut off.
this is Debra Massey's murder.
this is before Gaffney was arrested.
Yeah. Describes the murder as being perfect,
only they misreported that her fingers had been removed.
so Rowe read everything he could about Debra Massey, copied it to the letter with Melissa to make the police think Gaffney did it.
but he practiced on someone else first, and they'll also be missing their fingers.
okay, so we need to find a body without any fingers.
problem. None of the unsolveds have missing digits.
I'm going to talk to someone who knows Rowe. Who's that? His old roommate.
you used to be Stephen Rowe's roommate?
man... you guys never give up.
read the trial transcripts.
I don't got any new answers for you.
well, I think we have different questions.
so, you said that after Stephen got married, he still came to your poker games?
Yeah. I already answered that one.
did Melissa ever come with him?
she came for a while, but then they both stopped.
why, do you think?
this is why Stevie could never hurt a woman.
he likes them too much.
did Melissa catch him with another woman?
not at the game.
he was talking to another tenant here.
Melissa overreacted.
does this woman still live here?
now, you see, if I answer that one,
I know what you'll be thinking, and you'll be wrong.
what would be wrong is you not answering the question.
her name is Theresa Barton.
she moved out, left all her stuff, didn't tell anyone.
sounds a lot like Theresa Barton went missing.
anyone call it in?
I don't know.
the manager may have, but people come and go around here all the time.
he gave her a month. No calls.
he put her stuff in storage.
Stevie had nothing to do with this Barton chick.
I think we're going to answer that one.
want to guess when Theresa Barton disappeared?
inside our timeline?
three months after Stephen decided to get rid of Melissa and a month after the Massey murder articles were published.
did you call Horatio yet?
so, this is all the stuff from Theresa Barton's storage?
Yeah.
she's a pretty girl.
let's have Tripp follow up on this membership at Carlyle's Cinema Rental.
she has a movie rental card?
Yeah.
that's weird.
Theresa doesn't have a DVD player or a VCR.
let me see this.
you know, the only time I've ever seen a card look like this...
when it's used to open a locked door.
I bet if we call Carlyle's, the account number will have Stephen Rowe's name on it.
you confirm that. I'm going to call Horatio and have him pick up Rowe at his girlfriend's house.
I think we just found Rowe's practice murder.
that is blood.
ms. Grady, are you here?
he's already gone, Frank.
well, somebody's blood is still here.
do you think it's Allison's?
we went to your girlfriend's house but instead we found her blood.
you know, every time something goes wrong in this town, you can't come running for me.
Where's Allison?
like I told you, last time I saw her, she was at home.
Yes, which is where you cut her.
that was an accident.
aren't they all?
look!
Allison hit me.
she cut herself on a broken picture frame.
I tried to go help her.
she told me to leave her alone, so I did.
she's probably off shopping, trying to cool off right now.
look, with any absence of any wrongdoing...
we found out.
I don't know a Theresa Barton.
Yes, you do; you used her as your practice victim.
that's quite a stretch.
you know, you can't just connect me with some random woman just 'cause you want to.
we recovered your video rental card
the one you used to break into her apartment.
you got a body this time, Caine?
I don't need a body.
officer.
H, that print we lifted from Allison's blood at her house?
I matched it to the ten cards from the Rowe investigation.
Melissa's father.
are we sure Allison's in here, Frank?
we haven't spotted her yet.
Bowman's here. He won't come out.
okay.
you take the back.
I'll take the front.
Mr. Bowman?
Mr. Bowman, it's Horatio Caine.
I just want to talk.
MR.BOWMAN: Are you okay? Are you okay?
there you go, Melissa, there you go!
keep pedaling.
she kept falling off that damn bike...
but she always got back on.
you're doing great. That's great, honey.
no matter how bad it got, she got back on.
that's why she's dead.
Allison's dead?
is that what you're telling me?
no.
all right! There you go, there you go.
she wouldn't give up on Stephen.
keep going straight. Keep pedaling.
no matter what he did to her.
I didn't save my girl, but I saved Allison.
and that's a good thing, Mr. Bowman.
it's a good thing.
I didn't go there to do a good thing.
I went there to kill that bastard.
did he hurt you?
we got to get you out of here before he comes back.
let go of me! Listen to me, listen to me!
if you don't leave now, he will kill you.
get up!
move.
she didn't understand I wanted to help her.
Mr. Bowman, you kidnapped her.
if I saved her life, do you think I care if I go to prison?
where is she?
she'll just go back to him.
daddy, look, look, I'm riding!
going back...
is her choice, just like Melissa's.
you did not fail them.
I did fail my daughter.
I just want my little girl back.
I know you do.
we found the girl.
okay, Frank.
okay.
daddy, look! Look, Daddy, look!
look at me!
you're doing great!
that's great, honey!
thank you, Lieutenant.
he was going to kill me.
believe it or not, ma'am, he was trying to help you.
can I just go home to Stephen?
stephen is under arrest.
stephen didn't hurt me.
it was an accident.
this has nothing to do with you.
I don't understand.
why are you holding him?
because Stephen, ma'am, is a killer.
excuse me.
Horatio, we still haven't found Theresa Barton's body...
Frank, we've got 72 hours before Stephen is released and disappears.
Hey.
what you said earlier about these Massey articles got me thinking.
you mean how Rowe studied them for his murders?
I think you know where Theresa Barton's body is.
I do?
Yeah, well, if he followed these articles to a "T,"
where was Massey's body dumped?
Silmar Lake.
then that's where we'll find Rowe's practice victim.
things change fast in Miami.
could I help you gentlemen?
Yeah. Yeah, you can.
there used to be a lake here, and we think there was a body dumped in it.
Yeah, well, we drained it a few months ago and filled it up with trash, and nobody found no body.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't if you weren't looking for it, but we will be.
not now, you're not.
if I shut down, I lose ten grand a minute.
all right, well, you want to lose another ten arguing about it, or do you want to let us get to work?
I get how the thing sees different layers underground, but how is it going to pick up a body?
it's a landfill, she's covered in trash.
it's the same way, it kicks out the electromagnetic waves, they bounce back, and the computer creates a cross-section of what's below.
now, if I see a bump...
bump means we got a body. Right.
wait a minute, stop.
back up about a foot.
this is where we start digging.
what are we looking at?
it could be Theresa Barton.
I'll learn more at the post.
we can compare her to a DNA sample of her belongings.
okay. Okay, her fingers are missing.
one similarity to Melissa Rowe.
okay, there's another similarity.
those are Stephen Rowe's missing dumbbells.
all right, all we need now is the knife tip.
it's a match, Stephen.
so you have the tip of a knife.
my lawyer got me off the first time, he'll get me off again.
actually, Stephen,
I have quite a bit more than the tip of a knife.
I have Theresa Barton's body with the tip of the knife in it.
we found her, buried in the bottom of a lake bed.
you chose Theresa randomly, didn't you?
do you live in the building?
I come here to play poker.
my old roommate lives here.
Oh, that's great.
the problem is, Stephen, is that you didn't do your homework.
the press got it wrong.
Debra Massey's fingers were not, I repeat, not cut off.
you have my lawyer's number.
Stephen, I don't even think your lawyer is going to take this case.
here are the pantyhose from the drying shed you asked for.
Thanks, Paula.
even in that bag, it stunk up the whole lab.
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought Horatio already nailed Stephen Rowe.
he's on ice.
but Horatio still wants to build the federal case for the hate crime.
I was just waiting for these to dry out to tie up Melissa's loose ends.
what's that?
it's a fingernail.
well, that must've hurt.
lucky some skin was still attached to your fingernail.
usually, there's no viable DNA.
Hey, Valera, let me ask you,
if you saw a woman wearing pantyhose in Miami, what would you think? Hooker.
or from out of town.
my money's on whoever redressed Melissa is not a Miami native.
I thought this case was closed.
I compared the DNA to the blood we found at the house.
I never thought...
this case just reopened.
you are not from Miami originally, are you?
Connecticut.
my family gave me the house here, so I moved down.
what does this have to do why we found pantyhose on Melissa's body.
young women from Miami don't wear them.
Yes, and why you redressed her for a night out in Connecticut.
what?
I didn't redress Melissa.
I had nothing do with her.
then explain the fingernail that we found in her pantyhose.
Oh, God.
okay... I did redress her.
I didn't want to.
stephen made me.
that's all I did.
that already makes you an accessory to murder.
what was I supposed to do?
I was terrified.
if I said anything, I would wind up like her.
now listen to me.
we need to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we're going to have to find some things to add to the dress.
Allison, you did more than redress her.
look, you don't know what really happened.
no one else was there.
stephen was there, Allison.
stephen is meeting with the assistant state attorney as we speak.
I don't understand.
he's cutting a deal.
with what? With you.
Oh, my God.
he's such a coward.
he promised me.
he chickened out on killing Melissa, didn't he?
the whole point of the other girl was to get rid of Melissa.
I can't.
that girl's face, I can't get it out of my head.
you promised we'd be together.
I'll figure something else out.
you mean, you'll leave it to me to figure something else out.
that's what he never understood.
that there was no other way.
he said there was no way he was going to stay married to a black girl, and Melissa wasn't going to give him a divorce.
so you took the knife from the practice murder.
it was easy.
called her, told her if she wanted to know who her husband was sleeping with to come over.
I'm so sorry you had to find out this way.
we love each other.
I told you that I would take care of it.
we've got to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we got to find something to add to her dress, okay?
sometimes you have to fight for what you want.
Yes, well...
now you can fight for your own life.
Theresa Barton-- what are these?
ms. West, you asked me to deliver you a case that you can win, and now, you have three.
wow, a trifecta.
Yeah.
good job, Lieutenant.
is that another one?
this one is for Melissa's father.
I'm hoping it will bring him some peace.
for the Feds.
Yeah.
how are you going to do that?
well, Allison's testimony makes Melissa's death Stephen's hate crime.
we already have him for Theresa Barton.
isn't that overkill?
hate doesn't trouble you, Ms. West?
of course, it does.
I'm glad to hear that...
because hate should trouble us all.
it's the last day for closing arguments in the murder trial of Stephen Rowe.
accused in the disappearance and murder of his wife, melissa, whose body has never been found.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
Melissa hasn't used her credit cards or withdrawn money from any of her bank accounts or even contacted her father in over six months.
clearly, we have cessation of life.
I have a title for ms. West's case against stephen: evidence of things not seen.
cause I don't see anything.
a gift from her father when she began culinary school.
it's part of a set，That's why mr. Rowe had to put it back.
unfortunately for him, he didn't put all of it back.
the tip broken off when he stabbed her.
the marriage was unhappy.
and, yes, stephen was having an affair.
he met Allison Grady and found true love.
no crime in that.
but ask yourselves: Why kill your wife when divorce is an option?
divorce was never an option for mr. Rowe. That would make him the bad guy.
and for a man who refuses to hold a job, alimony would be fatal.
it would be much easier to slice your wife up and throw her remains into the ocean.
Melissa rowe was missing three days
three-- before he called the police.
finally, consider the four 20-pound dumbbells curiously missing from mr. Rowe's personal set.
no body doesn't mean no crime.
no body...
means mr. Rowe had enough weight.
when you go behind those doors, there's only one question you need to ask:
do you want to send a young man to death row based on things not seen?
your honour, the jury has a verdict jury foreman, has the jury reached a unanimous desion on the issue that was submitted to you?
Yes, your honor.
if you'll give the verdict to the deputy, please.
if the defendant would please stand.
in the state of florida V. Stephen rowe, on the charge of murder in the first degree of melissa rowe...
...we find the defendant...
not guilty.
all right.
looks like a fisherman just found Melissa Rowe's body.
the bad news is, the verdict's already in.
the verdict is in, frank, but the jury is out.
double Jeopardy
just hours after Stephen rowe was acquitted for the murder of his wife a body believed to be melissa rowe has been founded in the local lake
is that her, Alexx?
she was in the water a long time, Horatio.
it'll be hard to determine what was degradation from injury.
I'll call you from the office when I confirm her id.
no, need, alexx.
that's melissa's favorite dress.
let's get her
Eric. Did you get anything in the water?
no. No weights. She was drifting free.
okay. It won't be far from where you found her.
won't stop looking till I find them.
all right.
officer.
let him go.
Mr. Bowman.
Mr. Bowman, I...
no, it is- is it my daughter?
I won't know till I confirm the DNA, but I...
I think it's melissa.
Mr. Bowman. You have to let me see her. Mr. Bowman.
no, I... I need to know.
I gotta know. Mr. Bowman, listen to me.
I want you to stay here with me.
Mr. Bowman.
stay here with me.
we need to go, boys.
what do I do now, lieutenant?
let's remember melissa the way she was.
all right?
let's do that.
Oh, my gosh, why is it so cold in here?
I don't want to lose what little of her I've got.
when you pull a body out of the water, putrefaction goes into overdrive.
well, tell me you at least have have enough for cause of death.
don't know yet.
what I can tell you is, her fingers were cut off.
are you sure it wasn't the wildlife?
no. They only go for the meaty parts-- the lips, ears.
the fish finished the job, but someone got them started.
m hoping her legs can tell us something.
looks like the panty hose kept everything together.
Whatoman wears panty hose in Miami?
her husband said she s going to a club the night she disappeared.
that is exactly my point. I do not believe one word that man says.
maybe you can find something once the panty hose dry out.
adipocere.
I thought that only formed in fatty tissue.
there's a little bit of fat everywhere in the body.
water kills most bacteria except the ones that digest fat.
they excrete the adipocere.
the soapy material coats nearby tissue protecting it from decay sometimes for years.
so the panty hose kept the waterfrom wearing away the adipocere, and that preserved her thighs.
Yeah. Sharp force trauma. Based on the tears in her dress, poor baby girl has wounds like these all over her body.
tissue is too degraded to compare it to our knife.
well, I know that this sounds terrible, but let's hope he cut her to the bone.
how's it going with the toolmarks from the Rowe case?
I'm comparing the stria from a cast of melissa's femur to a test mark of the knife from the trial.
I see you went virtual with the micro-ct.
it's the murder weapon.
that knife made the indentation on melissa's femur three times even with the broken tip?
the tip must've broken off before the attack.
why would Rowe use a broken knife for the murder?
so what does this get us?
double jeopardy
even with the new evidence, we can't retry for the same case.
whose idea was it to go to trial without a body?
the state attorney thought the case was solid enough.
Rowe didn't waive the time, we didn't have the time.
those the missing dumbbells Rowe used to weigh melissa's body down?
listen, if you don't move, I'm gonna have you arrested for obstruction.
Simple， yes or no.
look, I'm not ryan, erica, okay?
I'm not gonna talk to you about the rowe case.
you just did.
lieutenant caine.
hope you're re to return my stuff. Sure would like my laptop back.
got quite a spread here. - This is my family's house, lieutenant.
is that a fact?
did you buy that rock on your finger yourself, too?
I'm paying her back.
with your dead wife's policy.
were you just in the neighborhood, thought you'd stop by for a littleolice harassment?
no, actually, we've recovered the weights that you used to sink melissa with.
a jury found him innocent.
never confuse an acquittal with innocence.
just leave us alone.
the press hounds us, you cops drive by every night.
we just want to get on with our les.
so did melissa.
you know what, Caine?
you shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.
everyone's got melissa with a halo on her head.
but she wasn't who you thought she was.
is that why you killed her?
I didn't kill melissa.
now, get off my property.
so Horatio said something to Rowe, got him all worked up.
his lawyer wants all the evidence back.
I liked your erica sikes exclusive about finding rowe's weights.
didn't say any of that to her. She made it all up.
Oh, where have I heard that before?
Oh, that's right, I said the same thing.
give it a rest, Wolfe.
equal time, bro, equal time.
Yeah. Look, you're supposed to be going through the files on rowe's laptop.
didn't bother. It's already documented.
that's how we found out Rowe was having an affair.
Horatio wanted you to review...
what I did do was go through the files that weren't in the laptop.
I'm not following you.
just 'cause you hit delete doesn't mean the file's gone.
it's still on your hard-drive.
the space is relabeled as available, but the file's still there.
sometimes, it takes a long time for things to save over it.
that's how I found these.
looks like he was nervous we'd find his white sheet th the pointy hat.
Rowe was a white supremacist?
while he clearly didn't embrace our african brethren,
I think his interests were a little more narrow.
genealogy, family genetics.
looks like he was worried about how his kids were going to turn out.
definitely wanted white ones.
then, I guess we just found out what melissa's little secret is.
Melissa's mother died when she was nine months old.
we just never talked about her.
stepn found out that Melissa's mom was black after they were married.
they only dated a month, then eloped to vegas.
Mr. Bowman, when exactly did he find out?
when I met him. A week after they came back from the wedding.
how could you lie to me about that?
I'm sorry, stephen.
I just don't go telling everyone I'm half black.
Oh, yeah, well, i wouldn't either.
it's not like at.
why does it matter?
why does it matter? What are our kids going to look like?
I don't know.
like me.
what?
a half-breed?
damn it!
that bastard belongs in jail.
you know what?
I've got an idea.
lieutenant Caine. - Miss west.
you went over my head and brought in a federal prosecutor?
miss west, I have evidence that mr. Rowe was involved in melissa's murder, but I need to act on it right now.
on what grounds?
I believe her killing was racially motivated.
a hate crime?
you're never going to sell that to a jury.
I don't agree. - Lieutenant.
Yes, sir?
good work.
I see where you're going with this, but Rowe was married to the victim.
Yes, but he didn't know her racial status till after they were married.
okay, lieutenant, you want to pursue this, get me something definitive.
we need a slam dunk.
thank you.
this is a waste of time.
bring us cases we can win.
Yes, ma'am?
for a perfect murder, there's a lot that doesn't make sense.
I'm listening.
why use a broken knife to kill someone?
question is, where is the other piece?
and I could ask the same question about the weights.
Delko only recovered two of the four missing from rowe's set.
it's like there's a piece of the crime missing.
so is stephen hiding another murder?
are you thinking that he used the same knife and weights to kill someone else before?
and was he practicing for Melissa?
practice makes perfect.
Yes, it does. We have our killer. We need to find our victim.
Mr. Wolfe.
this is impossible.
how do you find mr. Rowe's first victim when you know nothing about her?
I want to stay focused on mr. Rowe.
okay.
stephen rowe discovered melissa's racial status on march 26th.
and she disappeared on october 5th.
so those are the six months we need to look at.
that's right.
so we got to find where he worked, where he lived, where he ate sushi.
ASAP.
are you finished with the vics?
Yeah.
so thetars are all the female victims in the area during the six months we're worried about.
and this database is the entire life of stephen rowe that you've compiled from six months of credit card receipts?
Yeah. Okay, let's see where they intersect.
the dots indicate all the evts in rowe's life.
and when they overlap with a star, that means that rowe might have a relationship with the female victim.
especially if the victim's murder looks a lot like melissa'S.
that one's near his old address.
Debra massey. Missinsince may 15th.
water dump.
Yeah, the body surfaced only a couple days later, and the C. O.D. Was sharp force trauma.
that's only two months after Rowe discovered that Melissa's mother was black.
pull up the status of that case.
Ryan, this case is pending.
Opa-Locka P. D. Has arrested one ethan gaffney. He's in custody.
the murder looks an awful lot like melissa'S. Maybe Opa-Locka has the wrong guy.
Debra massey was my student.
your student? - Yeah, I'm a pilot.
I give flying lessons.
Mr. Gaffney, do you know a Stephen Rowe?
Yeah, yeah, from the news.
you trying to pin the Rowe murder on me?
what, he walks on his wife's murder, so now you go looking for a sacrificial lamb? Is that it?
we're trying to determine if there's a connection between the two cases.
wait a minute.
damn, I get it.
you think he killed the lady I'm in for.
just relax. We're just asking questions here.
but that makes sense.
see, I had nothing to do with Debra's death.
I'm as innocent as the day is long.
Opa-Locka P. D. Must ve had some reason to arrest you.
I have the luck of being the last to see her alive.
I told them, flying lesson was over, she went home. They didn't believe me.
well, mr. Gaffney, we'll look for some evidence we all can believe.
Debra was stabbed, but they never found the knife.
maybe because stephen rowe had it all the time.
only tool marks will tell.
they didn't say anything about the bones in the autopsy findings.
probably didn't look.
then I think we need to.
if she was in the water, too, how come she looks so much better than Stephen Rowe's wife?
she was only in the water a couple of days before the gases brought her up.
until she was buried, she was on ice, which makes my job a whole lot easier.
Debra's not missing any fingers.
that's not like Melissa.
Yeah, but like Melissa, Debra was stabbed.
she was also weighted down.
you think this is Rowe's practice murder?
those are ligature marks around her ankles.
can't tell from what.
if I can get a clear image, I'll let Horatio know.
okay.
tool marks on debra's bones were from narrower blade than melissa's were, and they were more slashes than stabs.
so this is not the blade with the broken tip.
no. Debra's edge was more flat, hollow grind, like a box cutter.
Melissa was a tapered knife.
and that means that Debra and Melissa were killed by different knives.
both were weighted down and dumped in a lake.
Debra floated up, but Melissa stayed put.
Yes, so someone is learning from their mistakes. Alexx.
but was it Rowe making those mistakes, Horatio?
whatever was used to tie Debra Massey down left a unique mark in the skin.
now, I couldn't make it out atirst, until I used oblique lighting.
a timing chain made that mark.
it's used in airplane engines.
ladies, I believe we have a suspect who can enlighten us.
you gave Debra Massey flying lessons. You work with airplanes.
do you recognize the chain, mr. Gaffney?
it's unique.
it's found in motorcycles, snowmobiles and your airplane.
it's called a silent chain.
well, it's talking now, isn't it?
you used this chain to tie weights to Debra Massey's ankles.
Mr. Gaffney, you killed Debra. This is your chance to help yourself.
okay, look...
I need you to understand something, 'cause those Opa-locka detectives won't listen to me.
I didn't set out to kill Debra. She was hitting on me.
when she freaked out, I overreacted.
come on... - just... no!
Hey, come on, let finish your flying lesson.
shut up.
she wouldn't stop screaming.
people were going to hear.
I had to shut her up.
Hey, for the record, I didn't have anything to do with that rowe chick.
I just don't want those papers to start prting those lies again.
what lies?
they made me out to be some kind of Hannibal lecter, said I cut off her fingers and ate them.
I didn't do that. I'm not a monster.
I don't think Debra would agree with that.
Eric, the articles from Debra Massey's murder,go back through them.
so, what do you think this article's about?
victim's name withheld.
these look like... melissa rowe's murder.
Yeah, I thought so, too. Everything reads like Melissa, but her fingers are cut off.
this is Debra Massey's murder.
this ia before Gaffney waarrested.
Yeah. Describes the murder as being "perfect,only they misrepord that her fingers had been removed.
so rowe read everything he could about Debra Massey, copied it to the letter with Melissa to make the police think Gaffney did it.
but he practiced on someone else first, and they'll also be missing their fingers.
okay, so we need to find a body without any fingers.
problem.
none of the unsolveds have missing digits.
I'm going to talk to someone who knows Rowe better than anyone else.
who's that? - His old roommate.
you used to be Stephen Rowe's roommate?
man...
you guys never give up.
read the trial transcripts.
I don't got any new answers for you.
well, I think we have different questions.
so, you said that after stephen got married, he still came to your poker games?
Yeah. I already answered that one.
did Melissa ever come with him?
she came for a while, but then they both stopped.
why, do you think?
this is why Stevie could never hurt a woman.
he likes them too much.
did Melissa catch him with another woman?
not at the game.
he was talking to another tenant here. Melissa overreacted.
does this woman still live here?
now, you see, if I answer that one,
I know what you'll be thinking, and you'll be wrong.
what would be wrong is you not answering the question.
her name is Theresa Barton.
she moved out, left all her stuff, didn't tell anyone.
sounds a lot like theresa barton went missing. Anyone call it in?
I don't know.
the manager may have but people come and go around here all the time.
he gave her a month.
no calls. He put her stuff in storage.
Stevie had nothing to do with this Barton chick.
I think we're going to answer that one.
want to guess when Theresa Barton disappeared?
inside our timeline?
three months after Stephen decided to get rid of Melissa and a month after the Massey murder articles were published.
so, this is all stuff from Theresa Barton's storage?
Yeah.
she's a pretty girl.
let's have tripp follow up on this membership at carlyle's cinema rental.
she has a movie rental card?
Yeah.
that's weird.
Theresa doesn't have a DVD player or a VCR.
let me see this.
you know, the only time I've ever seen a card look like this...
when it's used to open a locked door.
I bet if we call Carlyle's, the account number will have Stephen Rowe's name on it.
you confirm that; I'm going to call Horatio and have him pick up rowe at his girlfriend's house.
I think we just found rowe's practice murder.
that is blood.
ms. Grady, are you here?
Mr. Rowe?!
he's already gone, frank.
well, somebody's blood is still here. Do you think it's allison's?
let's find mr. Rowe.
we went to your girlfriend's house looking for you, stephen, but inead we found her blood.
you know, every time something goes wrong in this town, you can't come running for me.
Where's Allison?
like I told you, last time I saw her, she was at home.
Yes, which is where you cut her.
that was an accident.
aren't they all? - Look!
Allison hit me.
she cut herself on a broken picture frame.
I tried to go help her. She told me to leave her alone, so I did.
she's probably off shopping, trying to cool off right now.
look, with any absence of any wrongdoing...
we found out about Theresa Barton, Stephen.
I don't know a Theresa Barton.
Yes, you do; you used her as your practice victim.
that's quite a stretch.
you know, you can't just connect me with some random woman just 'cause you want to.
we recovered your video rental card
the one you used to break into her apartment.
you got a body this time, Caine?
I don't need a body.
take him please
H, that print we lifted from allison's blood at her house?
I matched it to the ten cards from the rowe investigation.
Melissa's father.
are we sure Allison's in here, Frank?
we haven't spotted her yet.
Bowman's here. He won't come out.
okay.
you take the back.
I'll take the fron mr. Bowman?
mr Bowman, it's Horatio Caine.
I just want to talk.
are you okay? Are you okay?
there you go, Melissa, there you go!
keep pedaling.
Mr. Bowman?
she kept falling off that damn bike...
but she always got back on.
no matter how bad she got she got back on.
that's why she's dead.
Allison's dead?
is that what you're telling me?
no.
she wouldn't give up on stephen.
no matter what he did to her.
I didn't save my girl, but I saved Allison.
and that's a good thing, mr. Bowman.
it's a good thing.
I didn't go there to do a good thing.
I went there to kill that bastard.
did he hurt you?
we got to get you out of here before he comes back.
listen to me, listen to me!
if you don't leave now, he will kill you.
she didn't understand I wanted to help her.
Mr. Bowman, you kidnapped her.
if I saved her life, do you think I care if I go to prison?
where is she?
she'll just go back to him.
Mr. Bowman...
going back...
is her choice, just like melissa'S.
you did not fail them.
I did fail my daughter.
I just want my little girl back.
I know you do.
we found the girl.
okay, frank.
okay.
daddy, look! Look, daddy, look! Look at me!
you're doing great! That's great, honey!
thank you, lieutenant.
he was going to kill me.
believe it or not, ma'am, he was trying to help you.
can I just go home to stephen?
stephen is under arrest.
stephen didn't hurt me. It was an accident.
this has nothing to do with you.
I don't understand why are you holding him?
because stephen, ma'am, is a killer.
excuse me.
Horatio, we still haven't found Theresa Barton's body...
Frank, we've got 72 hours before Stephen is released and disappears.
Hey.
what you said earlier about these Massey articles got me thinking.
you mean how Rowe studied them for his murders?
I think you kn where theresa barton's body is.
I do?
Yeah, well, if he followed these articles to a "t,
where was massey's body dumped?
Silmar lake.
then that's where we'll find Rowe's practice victim.
things change fast in miami.
could I help you gentlemen?
Yeah, you can.
there used to be a lake here, and we think there was a body dumped in it.
Yeah, well, we drained it a few months ago and filled it up with trash, and nobody found no body.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't if you weren't looking for it, - but we will be. - Not now, you're not.
if I shut down, I lose ten grand a minute.
all right, well, you want to lose another ten arguing about it, or do you want to let us get to work?
I get how the thing sees different layers underground, but how is it going to pick up a body?
it's a landfill, she's covered in trash.
it's the same way, it kicks out the electromagnetic waves, they bounce back, and the computer creates a cross-section of what's below.
now, if I see a bump... - bump means we got a body.
right. Wait a minute, stop.
back up about a foot.
this is where we start digging.
what are we lookg at?
we're looking at Stephen Rowe behind bars.
it could be Theresa Barton.
I'll learn more at the post.
we can compare her to a DNA sample of her belongings.
okay.
okay, her fingers are missing.
one similarity to Melissa Rowe.
detective Wolfe.
okay, there's another similarity. Those are Stephen Rowe's missing dumbbells.
all right, all we need now is the knife tip.
it's a match, Stephen.
so you have the tip of a knife.
my lawyer got me off the first time, he'll get me off again.
actually, Stephen,
I have quite a bit more than the tip of a knife.
I have Theresa Barton's body with the tip of the knife in it.
we found her, buried in the bottom of a lake bed.
you chose Theresa randomly, didn't you?
doou live in the building? - My old roommate lives here.
Oh, that's great.
I come here to py poker.
the problem is, Stephen, is that you didn't do your homework.
the press got it wrong.
Debra Massey's fingers were not,
I repeat, not cut off.
you know what, Caine?
you have my lawyer's number.
Stephen, I don't even think your lawyer is going to take this case.
here are the pantyhose from the drying shed you asked for.
Thanks, Paula.
even in that bag, it stunk up the whole lab.
Hey, what are you doing? I thought Horatio already nailed Stephen Rowe.
he's on ice. But Horatio still wants to build the federal case for the hate crime.
I was just waiting for these to dry out to tie up Melissa's loose ends.
what's that?
it's a fingernail.
well, that must've hurt.
lucky some skin was still attached to your fingernail.
usually, there's no viable DNA.
Hey, Valera, let me ask you, if you saw a woman wearing pantyhose in miami, what would you think?
hooker. Or from out of town.
my money's on whoever redressed melissa is not a miami native.
I thought this case closed.
I compared the DNA to the blood we found at the house.
I never thought...
this case just reopened.
you are not from Miami originally, are you?
Connecticut.
my family gave me the house here, so I moved down.
what does this have to do with anything?
it explains why we found pantyhose on Melissa's body.
young women from Miami don't wear them.
Yes, and why you redressed her for a night out in Connecticut.
what?
I didn't redress Melis. I had nothing do with her.
then explain the fingernail that we found in her pantyhose.
Oh, god.
okay...
I did redress her.
I didn't want to. Stephen made me.
that's all I did.
that already makes you an accessory to murder.
what was I supposed to do? I was terrified.
if I said anything, I would wind up like her.
now listen to me.
we need to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we're going to have to find some things to add to the dress.
Allison, you did more than redress her.
listen, you don't know what really happened.
no one else was there.
stephen was there, Allison.
stephen is meeting withhe assistant state attorney as we speak.
I don't understand.
he's cutting a deal.
with what? - With you.
Oh, my god.
he's such a coward.
he promised me.
he chickened out on killing Melissa, didn't he?
the whole point of the other girl was to get rid of melissa.
I n'T.
that girl's face, I can't get it out of my head.
you promised we'd be together.
I'll figure something else out.
you mean, you'll leave it to me to figure something else out.
that's what he never understood.
that there was no other way.
he said there was no way he was going to stay married to a black girl, and Melissa wasn't going to give him a divorce.
so you took the knife from the practice murder.
it was easy.
called her, told her if she wanted to know who her husband was sleeping with to come over.
I'm so sorry you had to find out this way.
we love each other very much.
I told you that I would take care of it.
ve got to make it look like Melissa went to the club.
we got to find something to add to her dress, okay?
sometimes you have to fight for what you want.
Yes, well...
now you can fight for your own life.
Theresa Barton-- what are these?
ms. West, you asked me to deliver you a case that you can win, and now, I have three.
a trifecta.
good job, lieutenant. Is that another one?
this one is for Melissa's father.
I'm hoping it will bring him some peace.
for the feds.
Yeah.
how aryou going to do that?
well, Allison's testimony makes melissa's death stephen's hate crime.
we already have him for Theresa Barton. Isn't that overkill?
hate doesn't trouble you, ms. West?
of course, it does.
I'm glad to hear that...
because hate should trouble us all.
hundreds of fans are coming out to celebrate fashion designer Patricia Novak's new summer line, stars arriving in true south beach style from surf to turf.
stepping off the boat we have heiress Nikki Beck and her boyfriend Brandon Hess, of the band two minute mile.
Nikki, Nikki, over here.
show us that thousand watt smile, Nikki.
hey guys, great to see you.
Nikki, are you going to be working the catwalk today?
you know it.
and after the show,
I'm throwing a party for a couple hundred of my dearest friends.
and check out who's right on Nikki's tail.
Manhattan's favorite socialite, April Goodwin.
april, April, over here.
over here.
Oh, they're kissing.
Oh, wow. Look at that, they're kissing.
Oh, my god.
look, her dress fell.
so, look, come to my place.
bring your headshot, we'll talk about how I can make you a star.
Nikki wants mojitos in blue glasses or I stop payment on your check.
no, I use the same trainer.
guy is great, you should check him out.
I'll give you his number.
Oh, my god.
what is she doing here?
Hey, none of that.
I can't be in this room.
I need some air.
alone.
so, that's Nikki Beck.
Yes, quite the young celebrity.
it looks like she was electrocuted in the middle of her own party.
well, she was famous for being famous.
all eyes trained on her every move.
all except... her last one.
electrocution by bathtub is always hard to call,Horatio.
death comes from ventricular fibrillation.
a heart attack.
and no visible signs of trauma.
whoa. wait a minutes
something in her throat.
looks like a pill.
she didn't have time to digest it before she died.
alexx, get that to toxicology, please.
no problem.
thank you.
unique murder weapon--tanning lamp.
uv fluorescent bulbs.
looks like they're all broken.
aren't these outlets supposed to trip in order to prevent an electrical shock?
they did. Just not fast enough.
unfortunately, she had something working against her.
bath salts, when they're dispersed into the water, the particles get charged.
so the salt conducted the electricity.
Oh, I got a hair.
it's not Nikki's color.
maybe it's her killer's.
Hey, guys, check this out.
some blistering on her skin.
concentrated around a pale linear mark.
isn't that normal for water electrocution?
Yeah, shows where the water level was at time of death.
how can she have a linear mark when she was wearing her robe?
exactly.
this girl was re-dressed after she was electrocuted.
maybe a cover up?
well, let's ask the guy who's used to controlling Nikki's image.
her manager.
I did it.
I put her robe back on.
that doesn't look so good, Chad.
re-dress screams cover-up.
I didn't kill her.
when I found Nikki in the tub, she was already dead.
Hey.
you flaking on your own party?
Oh, my god, Nikki.
nobody needed to see her that way.
so you slipped back in the crowd, but you decided not to call 911?
I know how it works.
you call it in, suddenly you're like the prime suspect.
you seem to be overly conscious of how things look, Chad.
I had a client once, his autopsy photos ended up on the Internet.
no such thing as a private death anymore.
looks like a pattern with you.
your clients passing away.
say what you will, but I'm not a murderer.
I was only protecting Nikki.
Hey. -Hi.
your mother ever tell you there's more to a woman than meets the eye?
hair extensions, capped teeth...
collagen in her lips.
she also had a spray-on tan.
good eye.
and you told me you might have nerve damage.
actually, you're right, I don't.
and I'm glad word didn't get around that I did.
why would it?
wait up.
were you testing me?
to find out if I was the mole?
this isn't easy for me.
me? Of all people, me?
look, the lab is on the line.
Horatio told me it was the only way.
alexx, I'm sorry.
I just found out that Nikki used a spray-on tan.
so a tanning lamp doesn't make a lot of sense.
maybe, uh, maybe it was a plant.
someone brought it to make it look like an accident?
well, if so, I may have the very person who did it.
check out the hair you found at the scene.
Yeah, the medulla's thick.
it's greater than half the shaft, so it's not human.
it's animal hair.
and one with a very unique substance on its coat.
lauryl glucoside.
and is that rosemary oil and grapefruit extract?
it's organic flea shampoo.
for those who can afford the very best.
but whose dog barely ever touches the ground.
no way.
you think I killed nikki?
so that's not your tanning lamp, Miss Goodwin?
please.
I prefer the actual sun.
we found a dog hair next to the bathtub where Nikki was murdered.
I have a warrant to extract hair from your dog to make a comparison.
babydoll doesn't like strangers.
fine, I was trying to help Nikki.
I wasn't aware the two of you were that close.
we were "frenemies."
"frenemies"?
friends in real life, enemies in the press.
we just played their game, gave them what they wanted.
what exactly were you trying to help her with?
Nikki just got out of rehab.
and she couldn't deal.
did anyone see you?
we're cool.
Oh, my god, your wardrobe malfunction idea was the best.
what's wrong?
give it here.
I put you in rehab and I can put you right back.
all right, take it.
it's interesting that you would say that, because our medical examiner found a pill in her throat.
I swear, I took the pill away from her.
then how would she get another one right before she died?
that bitch.
who are you referring to?
her assistant, Melinda Carson.
april's lying.
I did everything Nikki wanted, but I drew the line at drugs.
then where'd she get them?
are you kidding?
drugs are exchanged at these parties more than phone numbers.
I take it Nikki didn't know about your past.
my past?
you were arrested for identity theft three years ago on your last job.
that was a misunderstanding.
I can't get anything done unless I pretend to be the person I'm working for.
I do her banking.
buy her airline tickets.
is there any chance that Nikki found out you were using her identity and things got out of control?
that's just great.
now you're accusing me of murder, too.
unless you'd like to substantiate that with any proof,
I have a funeral to arrange.
Eric, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
is she okay?
she's fine，she and I are getting married today.
we don't have the luxury of time, Eric, and it would make her happy.
the other thing that would make her happy is for you to be there.
I don't know.
I understand.
but, Eric, it would mean a lot.
Yeah.
I'll think about it.
H, the pill from Nikki's throat had a word stamped on it.
her saliva deteriorated a portion of it.
ghost-- is that a street term?
didn't sound familiar, so I scraped a sample, ran it through tox.
What'd you find?
it's a designer drug, knockoff of ecstasy.
so new, it's not even on the government's controlled substance list.
and one of the ingredients is ephedrine, used in cold medicine.
Yes, but it is also used in the production of methamphetamine, isn't it?
whoever was going to manufacture this was going to need to buy a lot of it.
and also going to need an I. D. to purchase it.
that's right, I'll run it through narco, see if we get any red flags， I'll let you know.
let's do that.
ephedrine
Dade University Dept of Chemistry 1108 Brighton Avenue Miami, FL 33011
professor Danville.
we're here to investigate the murder of Nikki Beck.
well, how does this concern me, officer?
you created the pill that we found lodged in her throat.
our narcotics division is aware of your website.
Yes, I set it up to post my research.
I have a grant to create drugs.
is that so?
I just test formulas,
I don't make drugs, or distribute them.
then why did you recently purchase a large quantity of ephedrine from surfglide pharmacy?
it's part of my work, buy it all the time.
but this last batch was stolen.
and you didn't report it.
where did you keep the batch?
well, it was in the filing cabinet, top drawer.
wait a minute, don't touch that.
the ephedrine was right there.
Yeah, you use toothpicks?
no. Why?
well, someone does.
Eric, get that to the lab.
I hear congratulations are in order.
listen, I wanted to tell you.
I was just afraid of how you'd react.
how did mami and pappy take it?
you didn't even tell them?
this is exactly why.
I knew they'd react the same way you are.
look, Mari, you should be concentrating on getting better right now.
why do you always focus on the negative?
that's one of the things I love about Horatio.
he makes me think about the positive.
you barely know him.
no, you barely know him.
he is not the same man you see at work.
don't you think it'd be wise to slow down right now?
I want to have a life like everybody else.
what if the cancer comes back?
what if it doesn't?
I need to start living for the future.
until Horatio, I didn't know if I had one.
so you'll be at the ceremony?
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
are you looking for the toothpick results?
Yeah, Valera was supposed to have something for me.
she was kind of swamped, so I told her I'd jump in and help you out.
okay.
is everything okay?
Yeah, fine.
I mean, I know we didn't spend that much time together, but enough to know when something's bothering you.
I'm just dealing with some personal things.
I'll, um... I'll work it out.
thank you.
so, uh, what's the word on the toothpick?
Oh, uh, yeah, I extracted enough DNA for a profile and CODIS found a match.
you want to check out your donor?
think that's your drug dealer?
well, if he's not, he's definitely cooking it.
Thanks.
Miami-Dade P. D.
did you just see that, Eric?
okay. Dario Sanez!
Dario! Officer.
check the house, Eric.
check the house.
there's somebody back there.
policia?
please, help us.
what's your name, ma'am?
Isabella, were you making drugs in that house?
Yes, we worked for him.
we were prisoners.
so you lived in there?
where are you from, ma'am?
el salvador.
these men... they come.
they take women in the middle of the night.
is that what happened to you?
no, I let them take me.
you let them take you? Why?
they have my sister.
these women, they don't last long.
and she's already sick.
what's your sister's name?
I hope I'm not too late.
please find her.
I'm going to do my best.
Hey, Joey, you paged me?
Yeah.
um, I thought there were no prints on the murder weapon.
that's a first for me...
a tanning lamp used as a murder weapon.
I was about to ship the tanning lamp off to the evidence locker when my uv light hit it.
there, on the back.
see those tiny dots?
Oh, yeah.
what are they?
you're looking at a datadot.
like a name tag, but with numbers.
company that makes them assigns a unique pin number to each registered owner.
the dots are applied with a liquid adhesive containing a uv trace.
so how do they help us?
I traced the owner through the company's home page, and guess what?
registered to Brandon Hess.
Nikki Beck's boyfriend.
Joseph, you just confirmed my theory.
this didn't belong to her.
looks like they've been joined by grief.
Yeah, at the hip.
Oh, look--you brought a friend this time.
Hey, I meant to ask you, who are you wearing?
MDPD.
I'll have to google them.
I'm glad to see you're helping each other through this.
this is hard on all of us.
but we totally have each other's backs.
and fronts, apparently.
april, you're gonna have to give us a second while we ask Brandon a few questions.
so buzzkill.
ring me at home, Bran.
see ya.
so, what's up?
how would you describe your relationship with Nikki?
great girl.
our time together was hot.
and she was there for me when...
two minute mile was breaking up.
my group. Two minute mile?
sorry, boy bands aren't really my thing.
we've sold 28 million copies.
whatever.
I'm going solo.
why are you asking me about all this?
because it was your tanning lamp that was used to electrocute Nikki.
my tanning lamp?
datadots confirm that it's yours, Brandon.
Yeah. My accountants tagged all my stuff with those, for insurance.
then how did it end up at Nikki's?
I don't know.
we used to borrow each other's stuff all the time.
can I go?
for now.
we don't have enough to hold him.
we need to go back to the one thing we do have: The murder weapon.
Yeah.
Eric... you okay?
Yeah. I'm just...thinking about this woman, Isabella.
hard to see a woman take chances with her life like that, not knowing what the future is.
it's a good thing she has people that care about her.
Yeah.
anything off the word on that pill?
no.
think that's the guy's nickname?
the dealer?
maybe it's a way to contact him.
okay. Well, even if the letters correspond to numbers, "ghost" is only five digits, not enough for a phone number.
but it is enough for a short code.
what about a text message?
Hey, punch in the specified five-digit code and you get an automated response.
why don't we place our own order?
let's give it a shot.
we got him. 3rd and Palm.
there you go. Call narco, have him picked up.
Mr. Cervantes, you've done quite well for yourself.
you think my business will shut down just 'cause you got me in here?
I got a diversified corporation.
and multinational.
you kidnap young woman from El Salvador and get them to work for you as slaves.
you kidding me?
they want to come.
work a few years, pay off some debts.
then they're free to go.
after their bodies are destroyed by the poison you have them working in.
you have to think outside the box to stay ahead.
if I don't find Lucia, my friend, I'm going to put you in a box.
do you understand me?
like I said, I got a corporation to run.
I don't sweat personnel changes.
who handles that for you?
talk to middle management.
I don't know a thing.
after i find Lucia, I'm going to shut down your corporation forever.
officer.
Hey.
let me ask you something.
do you have any plans after work tonight?
Yes, I heard about the wedding.
no, I'm not going.
I'm really happy for them.
don't you think we should do something for them?
well, they said they didn't want to make a fuss, but I got them something anyway.
would you do me a favor?
would you put my name on the card?
I already put your name on the card.
you did? -Yes.
thank you so much.
you're fantastic.
so, what do we got going on here?
a partial print showed up on the bottom of one of the bulbs when Kayle was processing the lamp.
but there's not enough ridge detail to match it to a ten-card.
no. I thought if I pulled enough partials,
I'd be able to frankenstein a print.
that could take forever.
how are you at poker?
what, you want to bluff?
who do you have in mind?
Frank ran the background on her.
it turns out she has a secret of her own.
the Goodwin family's broke.
Really?
well, I just spoke to Nikki's assistant, Melinda.
I wonder if April knew about nikki's deal to do a reality show without her.
reality show?
it was supposed to be together, but Nikki didn't want to share the spotlight.
I'd call that motive.
what?
am I supposed to guess what this is?
it's your fingerprint off a bulb from the tanning lamp that killed Nikki.
you know, for someone in your position, April, lying doesn't look so good.
I'm in a "position"?
you were the last person to see Nikki alive.
your fingerprint is on the murder weapon, which you said you had never seen.
of course I lied.
you kept calling it a weapon.
it was just a gift.
you gave it to Brandon?
I always give gifts to my friends.
I just sent Nikk flowers for her party today.
I have nothing to hide.
except for your family's financial situation.
we did some research on you.
are the Goodwins millions of dollars in debt?
didn't your father just apply for a real estate license?
he's trying.
that makes you the sole breadwinner for your entire family.
how would you like to carry that name and not have a dime behind it?
I'll do whatever it takes to support my family.
including kill Nikki?
how'd you feel when you found out that Nikki was dropping you to do her own reality show?
what are you talking about?
no way.
it was supposed to be about both of us.
she was going to dump me?
you saying you didn't know?
I didn'T.
you guys want me, I'll be on my boat.
I can see myself out.
she's a pretty good actress.
she's not that good.
she only does reality TV.
I believe her.
well, if you're right, then we still don't know who Nikki's killer is.
Horatio, I called in a few favors over at narco.
asked for any houses they suspected of cooking meth.
how many were there?
22. Average house uses 1, 250 kilowatt hours a month.
cook houses, over three times that.
what about the place we just hit?
3, 900 kilowatts.
okay. Same dealer, same equipment.
which house had the same amount?
here, this one. Just over 4, 000.
it's over near higgins park.
that's a quiet neighborhood.
not for long.
excuse me.
put the gun down slowly.
you're under arrest for the manufacture of illegal drugs.
are you alone?
Yeah, man. Just me.
check the van, Eric.
okay. Calmate, okay?
she's not here.
Where's Lucia?
don't know no Lucia, man.
let me jog your memory, my friend.
Oh, her?
I got rid of her, man.
she was useless.
she kept fainting from the fumes.
I sold her.
to who?
I don't know.
check the bag. The cash is in there.
here it is.
I'm going to process it to see what I can get off it.
cuff him.
I mean, we've been through everything.
what are we missing?
look at this picture.
Yeah. This is Nikki's bathroom.
what am I looking at?
the flowers.
Oh, yeah. April said she had them delivered to the party.
exactly. Flowers don't wilt that fast.
unless they were in high humidity.
when Nikki's body was found, the hot water had steamed up the room.
by the time we got there, the moisture had evaporated.
we didn't miss something. We just couldn't see it.
so what exactly are we looking for?
anything the moisture isn't sticking to.
footprints, handprints. When you see something, just circle it with the chalk.
so if someone walked in here while it was humid, their footprints would appear under new moisture.
the outlines will.
it's like if you take your finger and draw it across a window and then you breathe on it.
moisture can't stick to the grime left behind, and so you only see the mark when everything around it is wet.
okay, so most of the prints around the tub were wiped out by the water and crime scene activity.
I got some bare feet prints here.
probably Nikki's.
these are male shoe prints.
they go from the tub out the door.
well, that covers nikki's manager's story, right?
he came in here, re-dressed her...
and these high heels would back April's story.
she came to the tub, took the pill from Nikki.
then whose footprints are these?
look like a woman's.
flat soles.
sensible shoes.
someone working the party.
Melinda, her assistant.
she claims she never came in here.
these come from the door.
they go to the tub.
and then they go from the tub to the vanity.
that's where the tanning lamp was.
these footprints are spread apart, like she braced herself.
if this is Melinda's handprint, she could have thrown in the lamp, and fell back when Nikki splashed her.
but that only suggests she was in the room.
it doesn't prove she killed Nikki.
no.
but I know what will.
Melinda's been lying to us all along.
I didn't tell you because i didn't want Nikki to look bad.
so now you admit you were there.
Nikki wanted a fix.
what Nikki wants, Nikki gets.
so all that rehab was a waste.
just give me the damn pill.
I left her in that tub, flying high.
actually, that's not true.
I just got off the phone with Nikki's manager.
turns out, she was gonna drop you out of her reality show, not april, like you told us.
that's true.
Mel, I got some news about the show.
it's the network.
they don't think you're right for the demo.
you promised me i could play myself.
sorry.
at least you still have this job.
not anymore. I quit.
seriously, Mel, where are you going to go?
you leave, you're over.
but that's not where it ended, is it?
you killed Nikki, didn't you, Melinda?
...you're over.
no. You are.
no.
I didn't kill Nikki.
the murder weapon had fluorescent uv bulbs.
so?
so they shattered when you threw the tanning lamp into the water.
stand up, Melinda.
ultraviolet waves are invisible.
the bulbs are lined with a phosphor uv coating which allows it to glow under ultraviolet light.
when Nikki had a seizure, she splashed the water in the tub on everything, including you.
the water carried those phosphor shards onto your clothing.
when the water evaporated, it left the glass behind.
did you know she got $100, 000 just to show up at a premiere?
never even stayed for the movie.
and all she paid me?
500 a week.
she didn't deserve the life she had.
she didn't deserve to die, either.
Hey. Look, i got to run. Can it wait?
I heard you're not going to the ceremony today.
Where'd you hear that?
everyone kind of heard.
everyone needs to mind their business.
well, Marisol could say the same to you.
you haven't been through what I've been through with her.
okay?
do you trust her?
Yes, of course.
and I know you trust Horatio with your life.
so don't you trust these two to make this decision?
Look...I've been taking care of Marisol ever since she got sick.
I don't think she's ready for this.
but this is not your decision.
she didn't even invite our family.
that's not the way we do things.
it's her wedding day, Eric.
she probably didn't want to hear that speech, did you think of that?
no.
she just really wants to be happy.
and I know her brother wants that, too.
I got to do trace on these $100 bills.
Eric, what did we get?
I found iodine crystals on one of the bills used to buy Lucia.
Lodine. It's possible that Cervantes' men used it in their kitchen.
I don't think so.
I found this bill in the middle of an unwrapped bundle.
Cervantes' men never touched it.
okay.
wait a minute.
wait a minute, Danville had iodine on his hands, didn't he?
he's got Lucia.
I just develop the drug formula.
I can't help what people do with it.
this is not about the drugs.
I'm talking about Lucia, where is she?
who?
the woman you purchased from your partners. Where is she?
I haven't touched her, I swear.
I am certain she's gonna have a different story.
so for the last time, take me to her, right now.
Danville said she was locked in a back room.
Lucia, it's okay, honey.
it's all right.
Isabella sent me.
that's right.
you're free.
come on. You're free, honey.
ladies.
I don't know how to thank you.
well, there's no need, ma'am, there's no need.
all my sister wanted was to come to America, to be happy.
now she can.
now, I want you to go with this lady. She's gonna help you.
and this is my card. If you need anything, you'll call me.
okay?
thank you.
all right, ladies, good luck.
how's that for a wedding present?
the best kind.
we all pitched in.
Wow.
this is a good year, too.
we hope you have a lot more to come.
Congratulations.
thank you, pal.
you'll tell the others?
I will.
you look beautiful.
you don't look so bad yourself.
any doubts?
Nope. You?
no way.
listen, I don't think Eric's going to show.
I beg to differ.
Hey, sis.
Thanks, little brother.
sir.
wouldn't have missed it.
you ready? I sure am.
I got a clear shot.
I can get the hit and get away clean.
I've got it all mapped out.
just give me the okay.
excuse me.
excuse me. If I may have your attention, everyone, please.
thank you. Thank you.
many people criticized my husband and me for wanting to turn prime, tourist-friendly real estate into a children's hospital.
but they don't understand.
those young lives are the future.
now, the wealthy often find it easier to part with their money than their time.
right?
but in doing both, you have put your Palm Beach counterparts to shame.
and so, a toast!
to you!
Cheers!
can't say there's a protocol for this one, Horatio.
going to have to keep our guy chilled until I can post him.
the murder weapon is, uh, melting.
alexx, I think someone got here first.
take a look at that.
whoa.
a gunshot wound.
right. Some of the guests heard it.
that's cold-blooded, Horatio.
it's as cold as ice.
open
open
officer?
you seem to be the one in charge here.
I guess that depends who you ask.
my name's Josh Brockner.
I'm Mr. Whitford's...
uh... was Mr. Whitford's executive assistant.
if I can be of any help
who do you think would want to kill him, Josh?
well, he was a real estate developer
one of the richest and most influential in Miami.
swam with sharks on a daily basis.
for every friend, he had three enemies.
okay, I need a list of all of those people.
sure, anything.
I just want to help get
Mrs. Whitford home to her baby.
she's really been through a lot.
back in line, please.
Hey.
is this where the victim was shot?
Yeah.
right there.
then he fell backwards, over the balcony.
killer made it easier for us.
he left the gun behind.
.38 with a two-inch barrel.
I'll get it to Firearms.
wait a minute, Eric.
this is another blood drop.
separate from the rest.
and it's still wet, so it could be from our killer.
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.
it's okay, you know.
what is?
to experience a relearning curve.
what are you talking about?
evidence markers three and four.
you put two markers on the same blood drop, man.
I can't make a simple mistake?
that's what I kept telling myself last year.
after I got shot.
I'm fine, Wolfe.
and I'd be even better if everyone would stop giving me the third degree.
I said that, too.
Hey, Alexx, were you able to recover the projectile from the victim yet?
Yeah. Sing GSW.
round penetrated the chest.
came to rest in the pericardial sack, which caused massive internal bleeding.
but Whitford's days were already numbered.
there was massive scar tissue on the muscle, which caused several of the vessels to become narrow or completely occluded.
Wow. Not even 40 years old and he's already had a heart attack.
doesn't mean he didn't do some hard living.
he's got a perforated stum in the nasal cavity.
Ah.
chronic cocaine use.
Mm-hmm. His heart would've given out soon enough.
the killer just beat him to it.
which brings us back to the bullet.
looks like a . 38.
it'the same caliber as the weapon Ryan recovered.
it's in nice shape.
should make my job a lot easier.
Thanks, Alexx.
I'll see you later.
Hey. - Hey.
Eric said the . 38 came back with no viable prints.
unfortunately, no.
I was however able to match the spent round to the recovered firearm, making it a definite as our murder weapon.
and the serial number wasn't altered.
so Automated Firearms is searching for a registered owner.
there you go.
the trust fund playboy, who's always in Ocean Drive.
that's the guy.
I wonder what Neil has to say for himself.
Mr. Massey, we recovered your firearm from a murder scene.
my . 38?
that thing was stolen, few years ago.
is that a fact?
it's hard to find good help.
people think just because I got money that I don't notice when things disappear.
so I shouldn't expect to uncover a police report along the way.
Nah.
I got better things to do than to get someone into a beef with INS.
I understand. Where were you this morning?
at my family's attorney's office, getting my monthly allowance.
my parents get some kind of a thrill out of tightening the reins.
well, we hare a common interest.
I'm going to keep you in a holding cell till I can verify your story, okay?
here's another blood drop.
separate from the rest.
it could be from our killer.
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.
I hope you got something on that blood.
Neil Massey's story checked out, and we had to spring him.
well, I can see why.
that lone blood drop you found, it came back XX.
female?
Yep. - So whose blood is it?
did you check it against the reference samples?
everyone who attended the party.
and guess what?
the blood's consistent with Ashley Whitford.
the victim's wife?
Uh-huh.
all right, thanks.
I got a nose bleed, about five minutes before my speech.
public speaking makes me nervous.
so you admit though that you were in the bathroom.
Yes, I was.
but I was alone.
my husband hadn't arrived yet.
so you and your husband, you put on this event together
when you gave your speech, he's not there with you?
we usually arrive separately.
he hates these events.
always just shows up at the end.
I swear I didn't see him until...
Ashley, let's just-- let's be honest, okay?
this doesn't look good.
you stood to gain everything from your husband's death.
we're talking a huge estate.
right.
because everything in this world's about money.
I lost a husband today.
and my baby just lost his father.
I did not kill Dominic.
OK.
Thanks, Ms. Whitford.
we'll be in touch.
what do you think?
I don't buy it.
well, the evidence is equivocal.
the blood drop she left behind was gravitational.
that's consistent with a nosebleed.
and her alibi's about as airtight as you can get.
because she was downstairs when he fell.
she forgot her glasses.
I'll catch up to her.
Hey.
Hey, your glasses.
what have we got?
when I chased Ashley outside of MDPD,
I got worried I was seeing things, so I... compared the fingerprints off her sunglasses the sample print we took at the party.
they don't match.
the Ashley Whitford we interviewed-- it's not her.
Eric, I think it's likely that Ashley Whitford has an identical twin.
and she played us.
they played us.
they're playing everyone.
would you like your sunglasses back?
miss...?
she's my sister.
Yeah.
boy, you guys really tried to pull a face one.
which one of you murdered Dominic Whitford?
neither.
just because we're twins doesn't make us murderers.
it doesn't make you innocent either, Cayla.
you just posed as your sister.
that means you're looking at obstruction of justice and giving false information.
but everything Cayla said was true.
I told her exactly what to say to you guys.
it may as we have been me.
so do you remember what to say?
don't worry, Ashley.
I've always been great being you.
I'll call you when I'm done?
wait.
my ring.
but it wasn't you, Ashley.
were you afraid that you couldn't pull off the lies?
I just wanted to be with my son.
he's only a year old.
he doesn't get that his daddy is never coming home.
Ashley could barely speak to anyone, let alone cops.
we've always covered for each other.
you know, like tests in school, creepy dates.
and Dominic knew you were twins?
no.
he didn't need to know.
interesting.
makes it easier to cover up murder.
Ashley did not kill Dominic.
here's the thing.
you have different fingerprints, but...
identical twins share the same DNA, so the blood that we found at the crime scene puts you there as well.
I told you guys already.
it's mine.
my nose started bleeding.
no, actually, Cayla told us that, which means that I don't know really who is covering for who.
okay, Ashley was outside at the time, and I wasn't even at the party, okay?
I was at the gym.
feel free to check.
I will. - Okay.
I will. In fact, I'll double check.
Hey, I got your message.
there's new information?
I checked Dominic Whitford's medical records.
in 39 years, he's only checked into the hospital twice.
he jammed a Q-tip in his ear when he was 11
and was treated for a case of pleurisy at 27.
otherwise, perfect health.
there's nothing anywhere about a myocardial infarction.
well, if he didn't have a heart attack, then what caused the s tissue on his heart muscle?
a heart attack.
the twins thought they had a secret.
Whitford had an even bigger secret.
wait a minute.
are you saying that this is not Dominic Whitford?
are you saying this is another twin?
no, but he tried really hard to be him.
I don't know what you mean.
see this scar along the hairline?
well, this is where plastic surgeons like to hide their handiwork.
he had a face lift.
correct.
but not to lose a few wrinkles.
he changed his whole appearance.
scars inside the mouth.
that indicates cheek implants and chin augmentation.
there's another scar right here.
a bilateral otoplasty.
had both ears pinned back, capped it off with a nose job and color contact lenses.
we're not talking a reasonable facsimile, honey.
this man paid big money.
maybe Dominic Whitford picked up the tab.
you think he was paid to be Dominic's look-alike?
I don't know.
he's a hotshot real estate developer, needs to be in two places at once.
and he had a lot of enemies.
I mean, someone thought they had killed him.
you know, if that's true,
Dominic Whitford is still alive.
MrWhitford has had at least three attempts on his life.
development displaces people and people get angry.
you should see the hate mail.
so you knew he had a look-alike.
knew? I... I helped hire the guy.
he gave up his identity for 100K a year.
he also gave up his life.
so you knew the victim wasn't Whitford, and you knew that we were investigating the murder of a look-alike, and yet you said nothing.
Why?
I couldn't.
when Greg down...
I-I thought my boss could be in danger.
h-he went to great lengths to create this decoy.
I'm the only one who knows.
even his wife doesn't know.
well, if your boss is in danger, we need to find him.
do you have any idea where he is?
I don't know.
I haven't been able to reach him all day.
okay, let me put it to you this way.
Whitford, like yourself, could be a suspect, so I suggest that you start cooperating with me, all right?
he's been spending a lot of time at the Ambrose Estates property.
they just broke ground.
that wasn't so bad, was it?
Thanks, leave right now.
the dead shall rise.
you seem to be in a hurry, Mr. Whitford.
uh, no, I didn't realize you guys were cops.
I... I heard about the shooting.
figured I might be next.
Mr. Whitford, I'll be frank.
either you killed Greg Ramsey or you know who did.
my look-alike does promotional events for me all the time.
given, this is obviously the worst-case scenario, but... he knew the risks.
what do you mean risks?
when you're as high profile as I am, sometimes even leaving the house is dangerous.
I'm a very recognizable person in Miami.
I just used my double for added security, plain and simple.
go.
maybe you were attempting to fake your own death to disappear, and your double became expendable.
no.
I had nothing to do with Greg Ramsey's death.
excuse me.
Mr. Wolfe.
the cadaver dogs, please.
H.
I had no idea anyone was buried here.
well, you know, this isn't the first dead body you've been associated with today.
I don't understand.
I really don't.
I mean, I swear I'm innocent.
then you'll be okay with protective custody till we prove it.
Mr. Whitford, have you called your wife and told her that you're still alive?
no, I figured it was safer her not knowing.
you know, until I got to the bottom of it.
well, then you're both in for a big surprise.
Hi. - Hey.
that's the girl from the construction site.
Yeah, I did my best to put the poor baby back together.
almost done fluoroscoping.
were you able to get an ID?
dental records match on a missing person.
Mia Graham? That name sounds so familiar.
I think this girl used to work for Dominic Whitford.
I came across her name in one of his files.
cod's pressed skull fracture.
any thoughts on what the murder weapon might be?
I think you might have more luck identifying what cut her up.
I guess saw marks are easier to identify than depression marks.
wait a minute.
I think I just found a piece of it.
has teeth. Looks like a saw blade.
it could be from a, uh...
sawzall?
think you can get a print?
I know I can.
your boss said you'd be here, Josh.
and I guess he was right.
I, uh, you know, I was just... cleaning up.
Yes, I can imagine you are.
well, I run this job site so...
anything goes missing, I take the hit.
I would get used to that if I were you.
we found your fingerprint on the blade that killed Mia Graham, your former supervisor.
it's a perfect match.
why would I kill her?
you killed Mia because she was Mr. Whitford's assistant and you wanted her job
a job would have been out of your reach.
someday all this will be yours.
Really? You think Mr. Whitford will let me manage the site? No.
you'll be running the machinery.
I've told Dominic that that's on a par with your skill level.
except for the heavy stuff.
never figured anyone would find her.
and that's because killers like you, Josh, never do
take him.
we're not going to tell Ashley her husband's still alive?
that seems kind of cruel.
Hey, they don't want to be straight with us, we return the favor.
besides, H. doesn't want anyone in on this until we know who we can trust.
all right.
I have a police report from the first attempt on Dominic Whitford's life.
you think it was the same person tried again today?
if at first you don't succeed...
says here Mr. and Mrs. Whitford were shot at outside the country club polo grounds.
Ashley was eight months pregnant.
bullet missed them both, but Ashley fell.
she was rushed to the hospital for an emergency C-section.
looks like the only piece of ballistic evidence we got was this 9mm round.
couldn't tie it back to a gun.
tell you what we do have, we have a list of witnesses and suspects.
anyone of interest?
Yeah.
take a look at this.
same guy that owns the gun involved in the shooting this morning.
now he's connected to two attempts on Whitford's life.
so I'm thinking that shooting at Dominic Whitford was target practice?
Mr. Massey? - I assume you're talking about the incident at the country club.
I am talking about the incident at the country club.
I was at the clubhouse when it happened.
a cop questioned me as a witness not a suspect.
it was a year ago and they agree it was a coincidence.
why didn't you mention it before?
because I knew it would look bad.
but believe me, it was...
just a coincidence.
seeing as Dominic Whitford is dead,
I don't believe there are any coincidences, and I think a jury will agree with me.
let's book him.
get him out.
wait a minute.
wait a minute...
I... I did shoot at the Whitfords last year.
but it had nothing to do with Dominic.
I was aiming at his wife.
his wife?
why Whitford's wife?
we dated three years ago.
I kept a lot of cash in the house and one day it was gone along with my . 38.
now Ashley was with me when it happened, so I thought it couldn't have been her.
but then I found out about her sister.
why didn't you report it?
no proof.
and to be honest,
I was embarrassed.
you know, duped by twins.
like a joke.
I felt like I was stuck in one of them gum commercials.
well...
since you've copped to it, you're going to be stuck in prison for attempted murder.
I...I just wanted to scare her.
look, you're lucky she didn't lose the baby.
if she had, you'd be in there for murder.
let's go.
Hey, Natalia. It's Calleigh.
listen, I think we need to pay the twins another visit.
and would you pick up a copy of Ocean Drive on your way in?
Oh, you'll see.
Bye.
what stolen money? Neil's lying.
Oh, I... I'm sure. I can't wait to hear the truth.
he was scary jealous.
he went into a rage when I left him for Dominic.
the guy was practically stalking Ashley.
he couldn't kill Ashley, so he went after Dominic.
I'm just grateful that Noah's safe.
yes to him. Uh...
you had a cesarean delivery, right?
I had to. During the shooting, I fell.
there was bleeding.
well, maybe you can explain this picture that I found of you in Ocean Drive magazine.
it's really cute to you.
but there's no scar.
Oh...
they must've airbrushed it.
yeah? - Yeah.
do you know that I can get a warrant to have your body searched for surgical scars?
all right.
Ashley found out she couldn't have children.
I had the baby, okay.
so you covered for each other like back in high school, but this time you slept with him.
I couldn't tell him.
I was afraid that he'd leave me.
children were so important to him.
hey... give me a second.
okay? - Okay.
any tips?
he likes... enthusiasm.
blow in his ear, it'll be over before you know it.
ready?
As'm ever going to be.
you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
so you're telling me that you switched places for nine whole months without Dominic knowing?
Yes. I know it was wrong.
Yeah, you are wrong, Cayla, because we checked your passport and you weren't in the country. You were in Africa the entire pregnancy.
I already called Child Services.
they're going to take Noah away and send him to foster care unless you tell me the whole truth right now.
wait!
please don't take him.
he's mine. Noah's mine.
triplets.
that's... well, that's...
perfect.
all three of you are coming with me.
I really shouldn't talk without Ashley and Cayla.
I already spoke to them, I'd like to hear your story.
I don't know how it got this far.
why don't you tell me how it started?
it was always just a game.
Cheatng on tests.
fooling bosses, boyfriends.
so you three went after Dominic?
we grew up poor.
this was a way to make sure we were okay forever.
Ashley was supposed to marry him.
anytime it got old, Cayla and I'd step in.
then Ashley would divorce him, and then get a big chunk of change.
but he wanted a pregnant.
well, then Ashley had to get pregnant since the money always goes with the kid.
but... she couldn't do it.
Ashley's infertile.
so I did.
having a baby-- that is not a game.
I know.
I love Noah so much.
I miss him.
did you kill Dominic so that you could get him back?
no. God, no.
dom was actually a really good guy.
who killed him?
we have the blood from the crime scene.
we know it was one of you.
I don't know.
you're going to lose Noah, Beth, if you don't help me out here.
I'm sorry.
H. , I heard you caught Josh Brockner.
Yes, we did.
what about the triplets?
dead end.
we know one of them did it, but we just can't tie it to them individually.
identical blood and identical DNA.
just got to figure out which one of them it belongs to.
antibodies, Eric.
antibodies.
all the girls were born with the same blood.
what they don't know is that every time the body experiences a specific trauma, it builds antibodies to fight it.
so you got different lives, different traumas.
and Beth Selby's blood is going to show presence of anti-RH positive antibodies, which a woman's body produces when she's pregnant.
well, we find that in the blood, she's our killer.
and thus, the antigen antibody test.
I add a specific reagent to the sample, give her a quick spin in the centrifuge, and if it precipitates, then we've got her.
no.
sorry, Eric. There's no evidence of any anti-RH positive antibodies.
eliminates Beth as the killer.
try this.
this reagent may show us something else on the next blood sample.
you know that this is the very last blood sample from the scene.
we test this one, we're out of crime scene samples.
just call it hunch.
if it doesn't pay off, we've got nothing.
I know.
a killer could walk.
okay.
is it clotting?
Yes, it is.
indicates the presence of specific IgG and IgM antibodies.
you know what that shows.
the presence of a killer.
you know, as a CSI,
I spend a lot of time looking at things that to the naked eye seem identical, but aren't.
likes prints and
DNA, tool marks.
it's just what I do... really well.
so? - So, triplets... are no problem.
I have to say, though, you girls were really good.
I mean, Ashley, you lured Dominic in like a pro.
you used your MBA background to spark aittle interest.
maybe there was even love. Who knows?
then, Beth, you stepped in and did the one thing that Ashley couldn't and had a child.
but I didn't kill anybody.
I told you that.
Oh, and you know what, Beth? I believe you.
I think that's the one thing you couldn't do.
the blood from the crime scene showed the presence of IgG and IgM.
Meaning?
meaning that person was immunized against an infectious disease.
dengue fever, to be exact, which is contracted in Africa.
and, Cayla...
only you have been there.
I was told to shoot Dominic when I heard the champagne corks pop.
while Beth was at the gym.
which provided you with a really nice little alibi.
excuse me. If I may have your attention, please?
it wasn't glamorous enough, didn't generate enough tax revenue to ensure the city a rich future.
but they don't understand.
those young lives are the future.
the wealthy often find it easier to part with their money than their time.
...counterparts to shame.
so, a toast to you!
Ashley, I thought you were downstairs.
damn it, Cayla.
we both said that trip was a stupid idea.
it wasn't a trip.
I was a student.
then you got one of your little nosebleeds, didn't you?
so?
so, we did all the work, and you messed up.
are you kidding me, Bethie? You lay there.
he told me how disinterested
I seemed all those months before I got pregnant.
okay, okay, okay, ladies, if it's of any comfort, you're all guilty of murder.
what's going to happen to my baby?
he'll be raised by his father.
excuse me?
his father?
he's dead.
how is that possible?
because I can spot differences, and you three can't.
when you've got money, everybody wants a piece of you.
I spent so much time suspecting the people I work with,
I never thought to look next to me.
my whole life people have told me lies.
you know, despite all that's happened,
I still have the only thing that's important
my son.
well, he's a lucky kid.
and why is that?
because his father is a good man.
help! Please, help me!
please help me!
help! Please, help me!
the city of Miami has been gripped with a local news story, first reported here on WETX yesterday afternoon.
the victim: Innocent; the crime: Shocking.
and all of it caught on tape.
local college student Sherry Williamson was brutally carjacked early yesterday morning.
a nearby security camera, the only witness.
with us, we have special correspondent Ryan Wolfe, former CSI with the Miami-Dade crime lab.
welcome, Ryan.
thank you, Heather.
it's nice to be here again.
now, the unnamed suspect is still at large.
what can your forensic background tell us about the scene of the crime?
okay, uh, well, you see, the average person would look at the center of the action, but as a CSI, I'm trained to look from the outside, and work inward.
now, if we focus here on the attacker, we're never going to see his face.
so, we have to, uh, analyze the environment around him.
okay, right here.
if we isolate this image, and then we magnify it, and then we enhance it, you'll see the attacker's identity clear as day.
if anyone has information regarding this man's whereabouts, please call the station's hotline at 555-0111.
it's quite a crowd, Frank.
Yeah, word spread fast.
everybody clamoring to sneak a peek at public enemy #1.
carjacker.
Yeah.
whose face Ryan plastered all over television about an hour ago.
did we get a name?
no.
no ID, and nobody's talking.
city on the hunt.
looks like vigilantes took it upon themselves to be the guy's judge and jury.
judge, jury and executioner.
is it just me, or have people gotten a little too casual about seeing a dead body?
easier when decompose at a distance.
believe me.
we've got at least a dozen footprints here.
if an angry mob got to him, that would explain our boy's injuries.
ligature mark on his ankle, possibly held in restraint.
baby boy didn't go down quietly.
bruising, lacerations.
fingernails on both hands are torn.
wait a minute.
is that something under the nail bed?
it's like a wood splinter.
it's going to be impossible to process this scene.
people have contaminated it.
someone also contaminated the body.
smell's unmistakable.
it's urine.
it's not just enough to kill somebody.
you've got to make a statement.
media blew this carjacking way out of proportion.
maybe Ryan fueled the fire.
he didn't just fuel the fire.
he lit the match.
miss Williamson...
miss Williamson, I know this is difficult, but can you tell me if that's the man that hurt you?
Yes, that's him.
what happened?
I just left the bank and was going to my car.
he came out of nowhere.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey. - Hey!
help, please!
help me!
did he have a weapon?
no.
guess he really didn't need one.
now he's dead.
I can't help but feel responsible.
why do you say that?
all the craziness this caused.
Yes, I wanted justice, but...not like that.
I understand.
stand by.
15 minutes to air.
all remaining talent to the set, please.
cameras to your places...
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going?
thanks for coming down.
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
you look different.
must be the eyeliner.
I wear makeup now.
you must think it's pretty, uh, pretty silly.
no, that wasn't the adjective I was looking for.
well, I got to earn a living.
so, congratulations.
I heard you found the carjacker.
is that why you called me down here?
to ease your conscience?
you know, you may have gotten a man killed today.
I didn't really think it would go that far.
well, that seems to be a pattern with you.
okay, so this about the, uh, it's about the gambling...?
it's about everything, Ryan.
you assaulted a police officer.
you leaked information to Erica Sikes.
okay, well, all that is done now.
not doing it anymore.
are you not doing it in the way that you burned the counterfeit money and promised you would never bet again?
doesn't this job ever get to you?
I needed an outlet.
I wasn't hurting anyone.
Really?
you were being blackmailed by a suspect who you owed money to.
and I paid him that money so that he wouldn't have any power over the investigation that I was a part of.
you gambled on the clock so that you could pay him back.
and I did it in a card club.
and I wasn't breaking any laws.
you broke all the rules.
and because you have, every case you have ever worked on is being called into question, so if you say that you weren't hurting anyone, think about all of the people left behind to pick up the pieces for you.
speaking of which, I'm needed in DNA.
I have to go.
wait. Wait.
just wait a second.
after my segment ran, the station received a lot of phone calls, including about a dozen death threats-- to the carjacker.
these are the, uh, names and numbers.
hopefully, one of them is your guy.
are you familiar with the south pointe area, Mr. Hewitt?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's where they found that guy.
the carjacker, right?
the carjacker you threatened.
and we found your DNA on his clothes.
it was nice work, and quick.
I'm a fan of law enforcement, you know?
Yes. But you don't believe in the law, do you?
I do.
but sometimes you-you got to take things into your own hands.
I saw the carjacker on the beach in the morning.
recognized him from the news.
did to him what he did to that poor girl.
with a little interest.
come on.
step outside the badge a second.
you got to admit.
streets are much safer without this guy on them.
that's not up to you.
sir, were you brought in for questioning?
are you a suspect?
I'm not a suspect. I did it.
I killed the carjacker.
is there anything else you'd like to say?
you bet. People of Miami, we can take back our city.
make it safe for our families.
so you admit it? You are a vigilante?
you can call me whatever you want.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
let's take back our city!
take it back!
excuse me, officer?
is that him?
the guy who killed my brother?
your brother?
I'm sorry, but I'm not at liberty to discuss an open case.
came as soon as I heard.
I still can't believe it.
what's your brother's name?
I just saw his picture on the news.
think you would feel comfortable identifying his body for us?
sure. Whatever you need.
okay.
you heard it live.
Derek Hewitt, a mechanic from homestead, has confessed to the murder of a still unnamed suspect who was caught on video assaulting young Sherry Williamson in broad daylight yesterday.
Hewitt, a self-described vigilante, urged others to "take back the city" by any means necessary.
H, Natalia called.
she spoke to the victim's brother.
and we got a positive ID on him.
it's Jason Billings.
did you get a cause of death?
Yes. It's a Jefferson fracture.
vertical force to cause a broken neck.
check out these photos Alexx sent over.
she documented all the injuries he sustained.
several to his rib cage were postmortem.
and then there's this.
that looks like a shark bite.
Yeah, also postmortem.
so if Jason was already dead when he was bitten, that means he died out on the water and then somehow made it back to shore.
before he was ID'd on the news.
Yeah, before Ryan broadcast his face.
so our vigilante didn't kill the carjacker.
he just wanted the credit.
so if he didn't kill him, who did?
well, I mean...Wednesday.
Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, in all honesty, I've been...
Bye.
Hey.
great to see that smile.
it's nothing.
who was that? Jake?
um, yeah, I told him that if people would stop killing each other, we could have a proper meal.
is that info on the carjacker?
Yeah.
guy's name is Jason Billings.
born into money.
he had some pretty expensive hobbies.
like what?
like racing anything he can get his hands on.
horses, cars, boats.
why would a guy with that much money to burn need to steal a car?
had to be out of desperation.
we need to find out where Jason docked his boat.
Miami-Dade PD.
is this Jason Billings' boat?
Yes, it is.
is he in some kind of trouble?
not anymore.
he's dead.
Oh, my god.
how do you know him?
I just...I work for him.
I keep his boat clean and running.
did you clean it today?
no, no, I just, I just got started.
check out the kill switch.
the strap's torn.
didn't our victim have ligature marks on his ankle?
what, do you think somebody pushed Jason out of his boat?
Yeah, and it means Jason took the kill switch with him.
if it disengages, the motor shuts off.
it means the killer had to get it back to ride the boat back to shore.
Yes, leaving Jason to die.
where were you this morning?
I was in the Keys.
party went late. I slept in.
I got, like, 30 people who can vouch for me.
Really?
well, you're gonna need more than 30 hungover college kids.
like what?
like DNA, prints.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
what am I supposed to do now?
why don't you take the rest of the day off?
we'll look after the boat.
okay?
this is a sweet ride.
it's a custom-built twin-engine donzi.
1, 400-horsepower.
this thing's so fast you can barely see it on the radar.
this is such a guy thing.
I mean, there's really only one reason to buy a boat like this.
try to look cool.
Oh, there's another reason.
how about drug smuggling?
see these markings on the hull here?
cement.
it's used to affix what's called a blister.
okay, I've heard of those.
that's what they hide the drugs inside to avoid detection.
blisters are usually made of fiberglass and painted the same color as the boat.
easy to pry off in case the coast guard spots them.
this blister's long gone, though.
but the cement left a mark.
looks like there's something in it.
looks like sand.
there's no reason to run a $500, 000 boat aground on purpose.
Nope, not unless you're in a real hurry to offload a drug shipment.
Oh, great.
now we got to search hundreds of miles of Florida coastline.
I'm all up for a treasure hunt and everything, but this is a lot of ground to cover.
and that's why I brought along our new toy, the profiler.
it's electromagnetic, so it picks up more than a metal detector.
Yeah, but so far all we've got is an iPod, four beer bottles, and a beach towel, but no fiberglass blister with the drugs.
so we keep looking until we find the blister.
is that who I think it is?
Yeah, Ryan Wolfe with on-the-spot coverage.
God, he just keeps anticipating our every move.
want me to go talk to him?
no, let's keep working.
I don't have my tripod, Wolfe.
how do I get a decent close-up of them from here?
you're not shooting them, Eddie.
you're shooting me.
what's the matter?
afraid your CSI colleagues will steal the spotlight?
I'm respecting their work.
come on, man.
a little closer.
come on. Get closer.
there's no crime scene tape.
Hey, man, just 'cause you heard about this on the police scanner doesn't mean you get to interfere with a murder investigation.
you understand that?
you got that?
I'm going to do my opener from here, all right?
Yeah, looks good, looks good.
I just want it a little wider.
get it off!
Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, relax!
get it off me!
I can't. I can't get it off or you're gonna bleed to death. All right?
hold on.
call for help!
call emergency!
get rescue out here now!
Oh, get it off!
hold on, man, hold on. All right?
he lost a lot of blood.
it's going to be close.
you know, us being here and us following you around, that's not my idea.
the assignment editors wanted me to follow up on a story.
just in case you were wondering.
no, I, I, I wasn't.
it's just that, um...
it's just that I'm on somebody else's payroll now, and it's weird.
I know.
I mean, I-I've been there.
when I worked for the feds, it was easy to lose sight of whose side I was on.
what do you think I should do?
short term: Get away from the cameras; and long term: You're just going to have to decide what your own priorities are.
you sure you're okay?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Natalia, that trap was put there to protect something.
will you bring your camera?
Yeah.
thing looks like something out of Vietnam.
or drug runners trying to protect their stash.
what is it?
looks like when that trap was triggered, it disturbed a lot of the sand around here.
it's the blister.
can you help me lift this?
Yeah.
well, there's our buried treasure.
it's wrapped in banana leaves to protect from moisture.
it's a common practice in Cuba.
Jason Billings was in deep.
this is a big stash.
if you bury something this well, you don't draw attention to it by setting a trap.
you do if you intend to kill the person that's following you.
by looking into your brother's past, Mr. Billings, it shined a light on your own.
what do you mean?
it turns out the boat is registered to you.
Yeah, the boat's in my name, but I gave it to Jason.
so what?
Jason may have been killed on the boat.
wait, I thought the vigilante guy killed him on the beach.
we have new information, don't we?
like that the boat was being used for drug running.
I...
I thought he was into something.
but it was his business.
I didn't ask.
we believe that Jason was offloading drugs.
we want to know for who.
do you have any idea who he hung out with?
there was this one guy.
he had those eyes, you know, like he wasn't afraid of anything.
that's going to change.
can I help you?
I think you can, Tony.
I know a lot of people.
I'm, uh, not so good with names, though.
Jason used his boat to smuggle drugs for you and now he's dead.
wow, that's...
that's creative, man.
I understand you have a connection with the Sovantes cartel of Cuba.
connection to a drug cartel, now... now you're just flat-out insulting me.
listen, I have three homes.
okay, a yacht, solid rep.
life is good, man. Why would I kill anyone?
maybe to keep it that way.
well, when you have proof... then we'll talk.
looking forward to it.
so what have we got?
well, my friend, you dug up 20 kilos of pure heroin, street value: $1. 4 million.
do you have any idea who was handling the banana leaves?
sand destroyed most of the prints, but I found one on the underside that was willing to cooperate.
it belongs to the left index finger of this guy.
Yeah, H got a reference sample from him earlier, including that ten cards.
doesn't he work on Jason Billings' boat?
I guess.
when he's not smuggling heroin from Cuba.
I'm not a drug runner, sir. I promise you.
I'm not interested in getting bounced out of Dade university.
see, we found your fingerprint though, Cole, on ten kilos of pure heroin.
explain that to me.
whenever Jason offered to take me for a ride, it was usually for a mile for two.
one day he says, "how about Cuba?
I was all over it.
that far.
that fast.
it was awesome.
what happened when you got there?
it was like an Indy pit stop.
some guys directed us in to refuel.
and Jason asked me to help him.
Hey, don't just stand there.
give me a hand with this, will you, buddy?
what is it?
come on. What does it look like?
no, I can't, man.
I shouldn't.
well, you don't, you're not coming back with me.
you helped him load the boat?
I didn't have a choice.
he had this look on his face I'd never seen before.
did you help him bury the product when you got back?
no, my involvement ended when we docked here.
he told me to keep my mouth shut, and I did.
that's it.
well, I guess we're going to find out, huh, Cole?
hmm, that is gruesome.
so you found something in the trap?
Yeah, epithelia, but they're not from our unfortunate cameraman.
it matches the reference sample of Cole Telford.
the college kid.
I found skin in this hinge right here.
he must've gotten pinched trying to put this contraption together.
he lied his way out of the prints, but I think he's going to have a tough time with this one.
so you're a mechanical engineering major?
Yeah, got one semester to go.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry.
what's that?
Oh, come off it, Mr. Telford.
your DNA already broke the news.
you set the trap, and I'm willing to bet you built it.
Yeah. It was spring-loaded for 125 pounds of pressure.
Jason loved the idea.
Oh, get it off! oh, get it off!
Jason was paranoid.
he thought Decker was tracking us, that he'd do anything to get his heroin back.
the trap was to send him a message.
well, you're going to have a lot of time to work on your communication skills.
is he going to be okay?
the guy in the hospital?
he's recovering.
well, I guess I got lucky.
Yeah, real lucky.
now you got 20 years to figure out how to build your next trap.
good afternoon, Mr. Wolfe.
good afternoon.
who are you here to see?
Yeah, bring him in.
all right, listen, I've got to go.
Yeah.
Bye.
you're late, pal.
what, did you get, uh, stuck in the makeup chair?
that's very funny.
Where's your visitor's pass?
are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.
all right, so you're pissed at me now, too?
no, Wolfe, I got my own problems.
now put your visitor's pass on before I get my ass thrown out of here, all right?
now, what have you got for me?
this is so strange.
Yeah.
this is the footage you dissected from your TV show?
you know, uh, "as a CSI, I like to work from the outside inward.
you have an uncanny gift for impersonations.
I actually should've practiced what I preached.
take a look at the part where Jason gets in the front seat.
there.
you see that?
no, see what?
all right, roll it back.
go back to where you started.
at 30 frames per second, the surveillance cameras record too slow to pick it up.
right there on the roof.
Yeah, some kind of spark. And you were able to see that?
not until I looked between the frames.
that's a good eye, Wolfe.
how many times have you watched this?
after the, uh, citywide manhunt, I started... a few.
now, that spark-- I think it's a ricochet.
somebody fired a bullet.
Yeah, well, Sherry Williamson didn't mention anything about gunfire to Horatio when she spoke to him.
she's been in on this the whole time.
not bad, huh?
I still got it.
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's just too bad you can't do anything with it because I'm going to be the one taking it to the judge.
good work.
nice shirt.
the entire city knows your name.
you got citizens who wanted to kill the man who assaulted you, and yet... you forgot to tell us that someone took a shot at him.
what? What are you talking about?
come on.
I know you're covering for someone.
you're on the hook right now for conspiracy to commit murder.
don't take the fall.
give me the shooter.
it was Jason's brother.
Jason's brother, Paul?
Yes.
he came to me.
asked for help.
why you?
paul and I are seeing each other on and off.
the money he offered me, it would've set me up for a long time.
so, for a price, you were supposed to lure Jason to your car?
he grabbed coffee at the same place every morning, early.
so I pretended to have car trouble.
excuse me, sir.
could you help me?
my car won't start.
Yeah. Sure, where are you parked?
it's just right here.
I got him there.
paul said he'd do the rest.
help! Please, help me!
so Paul fired outside the security camera's range.
the plan was botched.
paul missed.
and then I end up on the news, damsel in distress.
"damsel in distress," huh?
well, I'm afraid this isn't going to have a storybook ending, Ms. Williamson.
I hope your payday was worth it.
that's enough.
we've been down this dead-end road already.
you're in just as deep as your little brother.
running out of ways to phrase this, guys.
it was his mess, not mine.
why did you take a shot at him in broad daylight?
talked to Sherry?
you should've paid her more.
she belted it out like an opera singer.
Jason was in deep with Decker.
his shipment numbers from Cuba weren't adding up.
you work for Decker, too?
he told me to take care of it.
Yeah.
by killing Jason.
or he'd kill us both.
I couldn't do it.
so I fired a shot off the top of the car.
Jason took you out on his boat.
what was the purpose of that?
he was asking me for help.
someone tried to kill me this morning.
I think Tony's sent one of his goons after me.
return the kilos you took from him.
it'll all go away.
I promise.
it's too late.
W-what are you looking for?
you still carry that Glock with you?
no, and I wouldn't give it to you if I did.
you're one of Tony's goons, Paulie?
no, it wasn't like that.
go ahead. Finish it, Paulie.
finish it.
finish it, Paulie.
he never surfaced.
I recovered the boat's kill switch, rode back to shore.
worked out well for you, didn't it?
I never wanted him to drown.
I just wanted him to give the drugs back to Tony.
I loved my brother.
get him out of here.
cause of death was a broken neck.
guy's spinning us a yarn.
or maybe he's telling the truth, and somebody else finished him off.
Jimmy, push it!
get these guys off my ass!
get inside. Get inside.
this is the United States Coast Guard and Miami-Dade Police Department.
prepare to be boarded.
everyone on board your vessel must immediately ce topside.
did you have an accident on your boat?
it happens, you know?
day on the water.
it gets slippery.
it certainly was for Jason Billings.
he was never on my yacht, man.
we found his blood on your deck, and his cause of death was a broken neck.
Jason, uh... he drove the fastest boat in Miami, and when his shipments started coming in short, he would lie to me.
blame my Cuban suppliers.
so you followed him.
I had no choice.
I knew his brother wasn't going to finish the job.
he left him out in the water.
Hey, hey, hey.
give me your hand.
where are my missing kilos?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you don't tell me where it is, you're going right back in.
you understand me?
you won't kill me, man.
I'm the only way you'll get any of it back.
you're right.
you're right.
I cut my losses, man.
kid didn't want to save his own life, I wasn't about to save it for him.
you're quite a humanitarian, aren't you?
take him.
here to comment on our latest breaking news story, our resident crime expert, former CSI, Ryan Wolfe.
Hi, Heather.
a woman in Pensacola drowned her two young children this afternoon before taking her own life.
is this postpartum...
what?
is this postpartum pushed to the extreme, or is there some societal influence at work?
no, no, that's just horrible is what it is.
you know, to be honest, I don't think it's really our right to speculate on a mother who drowned her children.
but if you had to.
but I don't have to.
and I don't want to.
I'm sorry, I...
I'm sorry, Heather.
look, my time spent here has been, uh... it's been really fascinating.
it's been great.
but there's someplace else I think I got to be.
there are men and women who put themselves in harm's way every day.
it's their lives for ours.
and for them, it's not something that they do.
it's something that... that, you know, they are.
now, I'm not going to try to make myself sound so honorable, but I took an oath.
I took an oath to protect people in Miami, and, uh... I was born to be a cop.
and, um...
I think I lost that along the way.
so...
Hey, H.
you helped us, Mr. Wolfe.
Yeah, it was the least I could do.
but you consorted with a known felon, and that's not going to go away anytime soon.
you understand that?
I don't expect it to.
everything you've done in the past, everything you do today will come under close scrutiny.
I may not get my job back.
but every case that gets reopened, I'm going to answer to.
I'm not going to abandon this team.
and we, Mr. Wolfe, are not going to abandon you.
hello.
good morning, Doug.
I missed you.
who is this?
come on. I know you know me.
refresh my memory.
what did we do?
don't be naughty.
not yet.
we met at the ceremony where they retired your number.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
or what I said I'd do.
right.
brunette.
big blue eyes.
touchdown, quarterback.
let me ask you something.
are you still with your wife?
Oh, she's out. Pilates or something-- forget about her.
okay.
so, what was your most exciting experience?
winning your first, second or third ring?
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're just being bad.
okay, after the birth of my daughter, I'd have to say my induction.
I remember your speech.
you were on crutches, right?
that's right.
fourth surgery on my right knee.
it starts like an S.O.B. When it rains.
you follow football?
always been a fan.
you can blame my dad for that.
you know, I read recently that you were hospitalized.
was it anyseing thrious?
okay... now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
are you writing a story or something?
or something.
how would you like... to be remembered?
are you okay?
is everything all right?
Hello?
are you still there?
Hello?
Hey, H.
detective.
what have you got?
the victim is Doug Mcclain.
the football player.
who called it in?
the wife.
said she got back from augustine and found him on the floor.
although he retired 12 years ago, he's still a star, so when this breaks, it's gonna break big.
do we have control of the media, detective?
Oh, as good as can be expected, given the circumstances.
the body's in here. - okay
he's got a stab wound through the neck.
have we located the murder weapon yet?
did a cursory.
didn't see anything, but...
we got this.
okay.
check his phone records.
maybe he was attempting to call for help.
already working on it. - Thank you.
whoever stabbed him perfectly severed his carotid.
this spray is from his last three heartbeats.
only get that kind of force and volume with a total arterial transection.
alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.
it doesn't make sense.
Doug Mcclain was one of the best athletes of his time.
a man like this would never go down without a fight.
till today.
what's going on?
the victim's wife and that character want the body.
for what?
cryonics.
they want to freeze him?
that's what they said.
excuse me.
Mrs. Mcclain?
I'm alexx woods, M.E.
I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
but I can't let you take your husband's body.
but it was Doug's wish to be frozen until he could be cryonically revived.
he made all of the arrangements with the cryonic facility and...
and Dr. Klein...
Yes.
I understand, but that was before he died a vioeant dleth.
an autopsy could seriously compromise Doug's chances of revival.
with all due respect, doctor, fame doesn't exempt him.
I have jurisdiction over the remains of his body.
here. Does this help?
it's an injunction from judge Porterson.
an autopsy will never bring back Doug, but some day...
science will.
I have an eight- year-old daughter, and I know it sounds crazy, but...
Doug wanted to see her grow up.
this way, maybe...
one day he will see her.
and maybe even her children.
we'll just take the body.
okay, this is subject to court ajudication.
in the meantime, you better find me a seat in your van, because that body does not leave my sight.
certainly.
Mcclain was inducted into the hall of fame just last year.
famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was found murdered in his home early this morning.
he broke records in 1988 for total yards thrown.
Doug's wife, Elissa, was not available for comment.
stay tuned to channel four news, as we continue to bring you...
that's heparin, isn't it?
Yes.
you do realize an anti-coagulant is elusess on the dead, right?
dead to you, doctor.
we operate with a different definition.
heparin helps maintain tissue viability.
okay. Get him in.
you find anything, CSI Duquesne?
only smudges, detective Berkeley.
I didn't hear you leave this morning.
well, you know, a girl's got to keep some mystery.
okay.
well, what do you got on this one?
well, I can tell you there was no forced entry and this window was the only thing open.
well, it might be how the killer got in.
this doesn't belong.
what is it?
it's a piece of double-sided tape, but look at the fibers in it.
it's too short to be carpet.
I bet it was pulled off of whoever came through the window.
you find anything?
Oh, yeah.
just... probable motive.
somebody took mcclain's three championship rings.
1995 championship ball.
I'm assuming there used to be a football there.
it would have been from his last game.
took his team into the championship one last time and then retired.
the man was a class act.
you know, I knew that you liked football, but I wasn't aware that you were so into it.
well, you need your mornings, I need my sunday afternoons.
so you really think that Mcclain was killed for a few keepsakes?
keepsakes?
the stuff in this room's got to be worth a fortune.
well, then, why not take it all?
three championship rings and a signed team ball is definitely worth the most.
then I think the killer definitely knew what he was doing.
you gonna be able to pull any prints off that?
it's worth a try.
alexx, what do you got?
Doug Mcclain's wife presented a signed court order, Horatio.
signed by who?
judge porterson, Miami's leading advocate of progresvesi science.
you mean leading advocate of science fiction.
it's gonna take a hearing before I can get Doug under my knife.
by then, we could lose everything.
okay, here's what we do.
shift to plan "B.
I'm on my way to precore now.
I'll let you know.
keep me posted.
Hey, did you get a chance to look over the things I brought in from the trophy case?
Yeah. I got a print on that pair of cleats.
but it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.
well, nothing comes easy, does that?
what it's that?
you were right about the sticky tape you found by the window.
the fibers don't match anything in Mcclain's house.
it's silk.
italian silk.
killer could have brought it in on his clothing.
Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of people wear it.
well, you got anything better?
no.
but Mcclain was on the phone at the time of the murder, so Tripp is running the records to see who he was talking to.
you think he has somebody?
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
Hi.
that's a pretty top.
is it silk?
Yeah.
we're going to have to take a sample of your top to compare to some fibers we found at the Doug Mcclain crime scene.
what makes you think I was at the crime scene?
according to the phone records, you were the last person to speak to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.
the closest I got to him was the phone.
I was just updating his obituary.
I'm sorry?
newspapers like to be prepared for an unexpected death.
we have obituaries of people still alive on file so when they pass, we're ready to print.
that is morbid.
so I take it that you're a reporter?
my boss gave me a list of names and told me to update them.
and people will just talk to you?
you figure out ways to get them to open up.
Doug was a jock.
it's pretty obvious what part of the ego you have to stroke.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
that's the list of people that I had to update.
see? Doug Mcclain?
I don't understand why Doug would be at the top the list.
he doesn't have near the medical history of these other people.
my boss says that retired football players have a high mortality rate.
something about the abuse to their bodies.
and the abuse got a whole lot worse during the phone call.
am I right?
what are you accusing me of?
it just seems to be an incredible coincidence that
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the same day you were updating his obituary.
that doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.
are you sure?
you didn't keep Doug on the phone so that someone would have opportunity to kill him?
why would I do that?
I don't know.
but I'm going to find out.
have you prepped the equipment, doctor?
Yes.
what are you using it for?
well, if I can't perform a traditional autopsy to figure out what happened to him,
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.
as long as you do it quickly.
we need to get him into a neuropod asap.
I have to warn you, it's going to be freezing in there.
Yes.
Horatio. Yes.
I'm working on our quarterback now.
right. Right. But this will take longer than the real thing.
I have to compile each scan until I get a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.
I understand, Alexx. What else?
according to early data, he does have a fracture on his hand.
looks like to the second metacarpal, with swelling around the wrist.
swelling around the wrist?
perhaps he punched someone or something, huh?
Yeah.
looks like he may have fought back after all.
maybe. Keep me posted.
Hey.
Hey. You hear anything from calleigh about the obit writer?
Calleigh couldn't place her at the scene.
all right. I guess we keep digging, huh?
what have you got?
well, I'm trying to track down Doug Mcclain's stolen memorabilia off the internet.
how many sites have you been to?
14... so far.
you know how many sites there are, right?
Yeah.
wait a minute. Go back.
there's some football stuff there.
championship rings.
that them?
looks like it.
championship years '92,'93 and '95.
Yeah. And there's the football right there.
Oh, ye of little faith.
all of these items were put up for auction by a Theo Knight.
well, Theo's about to get a very disappointing return on his investment -
let me call Horatio.
why do you guys need my prints?
we have reason to believe that Doug Mcclain was killed during a robbery of his football memorabilia.
you seem like quite a fan, Theo.
my dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.
every snap. Every pass.
what, you guys think I broke into his house to steal from his personal collection?
we don't know.
we found a fingerprint, though, on an old cleat of his.
is that going to match one of these?
it may.
I was there two weeks ago, but not last night.
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.
so he sold you three championship rings and an autographed team ball willingly?
well, his manager did.
he gave me a good price.
I had to have it.
you had to have it?
you were online within hours of his murder selling it, Theo.
I was going to add it to my collection here, but when one of these legends dies, collectors go into a frenzy.
right.
news breaks, your 100-k investment climbs up to seven figures. Is that right?
I guess I'm a lucky guy.
Yes, but not for long.
tragic day for the sports world, Mr. Wilson.
Doug Mcclain was a legend.
Yes. And I understand you were his business manager.
and now I'm managing his estate.
and selling it off rather rapidly, too.
what are you talking about?
apparently, you just sold some pieces of memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.
I had to.
Doug had, um...
cash flow problems.
he spent money like he was still in his prime.
got so bad, I had to sell his stuff just to keep him afloat.
I notice that you have a black eye.
now, we found Mr. Mcclain with a broken hand.
am I to assume that he was not happy about what you were doing?
it was a sore subject.
Dougie wore those on that naked bootleg,'93.
game winner.
what else you got?
well, over here we have his first...
what the hell's going on?
you told me a reporter was coming in here.
would you excuse us for a minute?
sure.
Thanks.
you're selling all my stuff?
this is my life.
if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a life.
was that before you killed him this morning?
I was nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
you can check.
I'm going to.
you're running the double-sided tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?
Yeah. I already did.
you had silk fibers on one side, but even better-- epithelials on the other.
and what would cause that?
you're such a guy.
remember j-lo's green versace dress?
what do you think held that up?
double-sided adhesive?
this is wardrobe tape.
did you get a profile from it?
CODIS should tell us any second.
she's got an interesting rap sheet.
one and only arrest, 2004, for breaking and entering a residence.
Yeah. She broke into Doug Mcclain's house.
that was three years ago, and that was a complete misunderstanding.
Doug and I were having an affair, and his wife caught us in their bed, and she completely overreacted.
you know that Doug Mcclain's dead?
I know. I saw it on tv.
well, we found tape from your dress that proves you entered his house again, through a window.
that's because Doug called me a few days ago and asked me if I wanted to come over.
he said his wife was away.
did you?
and when I got there, he wasn't home yet.
so why not wait, hmm?
why climb through a window?
I knew Doug since his playing days.
we had a special relationship.
and I wanted to surprise him.
I was gone before dawn.
can you prove that?
look, I know what you're trying to say, but I would never hurt Doug.
never.
I think you got tired of climbing through windows, miss Sullivan.
I think you got tired of being Doug's second choice.
being Doug Mcclain's second choice was more than any girl could ask for.
except being his first.
you know, there is a great thai restaurant next to the shore club.
you don't give up, do you?
neither do I.
now, be careful with that, girl.
you gotta make sure it's pulled right back to your...
shoulder or it's going to kick back. You okay?
okay?
all right.
Yep. I'm good. All right.
I'm going to check out.
Oh, yeah?
you know, I... I saw what happened out there.
is your, um, shoulder okay?
Yep. I'm fine.
it's good.
okay.
take care of that shoulder.
by now, the world has heard about the death of sports legend Doug Mcclain, but tonight, on tape, you will hear his actual death at the hand of his murderers.
don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter in the mystery that is gripping the nation.
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to take another look at that obituary writer.
okay, so I didn't exactly tell you everything.
that is the understatement of the year, miss Legassic.
I did call Mr. Mcclain for my article.
but you conveniently left out the part where you had the murder recorded.
I was taping the conversation so I wouldn't miss anything.
at the time, I wasn't even sure what I was hearing.
what exactly did you hear?
I can't say.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement with the tv station.
it's legally binding.
so are handcuffs.
it's your choice, Wendy.
he was literally talking to me one second and gone the next.
I kept recording until my cell battery ran out.
and so your first instinct after you found out he was killed was to sell the tape?
I'm not a monster, officer.
I just wanted to get out of the obituary business.
you thought the recording would make you a reporter at WETX.
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.
that tape is never gonna make it to tv.
a judge has issued a warrant,
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting you for obstruction of justice.
your journalism career died with Doug Mcclain.
you can write an obituary for it.
okay, I uploaded Wendy Legassic's phone conversations.
what's next?
let's start with Doug Mcclain's final words.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
Doug, are you okay?
okay, now search for spiking activity.
here's some activity.
almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.
now, that sounds like somebody moving around the house, doesn't it?
and that's somebody making a phone call.
ten digits; an area code and a phone number.
track the numbers.
I'm on it.
I use reverse directory.
lieutenant, why would the killer be calling the victim's wife?
because they must be connected.
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire somebody to kill your husband?
absolutely not.
why would you ask that?
because it turns out that you and your husband weren't living together, and your current listing is in coral gables under your maiden name.
Doug and I have been separated for a year now.
I have my own place, but we're discreet about it.
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about image control, public perception, his legacy.
it was his livelihood.
and a divorce would taint that.
fans hold an idealized view of Doug, and they pay big for that perfect, infallible ideal.
okay, so let me ask you this.
if you didn't hire somebody to kill him, who called you from the crime scene?
Doug's manager called.
why would he do that?
to tell me what happened.
he wanted me back at the house before the police or the press got there, because everybody thinks that Doug and I are still together.
was he there when you arrived?
no.
do you think he killed Doug?
do you?
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa mcclain places you at the scene at the time of the murder.
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.
I'm his manager.
and when I found his body, I called Elissa.
cause you told us you were nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
now, that's a flat-out lie.
look, this is all about discretion, damage control.
I started collecting things that Doug wouldn't want the public to find out about:
whiskey bottles, diet pills, little blue pills, then I got out of there.
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.
I'd like the items, Mr. Wilson.
who's this?
I took care of everything for him but that.
never got a straight answer.
I think it's time to get one.
so, are there prints on the photograph?
Yeah, but it's not usable.
but the kid's wearing Doug's old number, and that can't be a coincidence.
no, it's not.
also, I can see part of a logo on the back of his helmet.
and it looks to me like it says "Lauderhill.
lauderhill youth program.
exactly. That's what I thought.
Yes.
more importantly, Natalia, who is this kid?
I'll call Lauderhill.
we got to find him.
lieutenant, April.
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.
thank you for coming in.
so you received our e-mail.
I guess we're hoping that you may be able to identify the child in the photograph.
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a youth football team every summer.
he was our star quarterback.
where might I find him?
lieutenant, he had a rare kidney disease.
he died last week.
what's his name?
may I?
sure.
is that your son, miss Sullivan?
Yes.
who's his father?
but in DNA only.
Caleb was only six years old when he died.
you know, I never asked Doug for anything-- money, nothing.
I raised Caleb all on my own.
he was everything to me.
and then he got sick.
his kidneys failed, didn't they?
I would have given him both of mine, but I wasn't a match, and there was a good chance that Doug was.
Dougie, he idolizes you.
he even put your number on his jersey. Please.
if he doesn't get this transplant, he will die.
I'll need to check with my attorney about this, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
please, Dougie, he's so young.
I'll give you a call next week.
Dougie, come on!
I never heard from him.
you know, everyone acts like Doug Mcclain was some big hero, but the man turned his back on his own son.
you broke into the house this morning, didn't you?
Yeah.
I heard doug on the phone with some new girl.
same as he ever was.
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
then you stabbed him, rita, didn't you?
Yeah.
okay.
where is the knife now?
I left it in him.
Why? It's not there?
miss Sullivan, someone removed it.
Rita Sullivan confessed?
alexx, she confessed to leaving the knife in the body.
we never recovered it.
wasn't at the scene.
well, that changes the scenario.
although, I'm sure she meant to finish Doug off.
but she didn't, did she?
no.
according to the virtopsy data, when the knife went in, it severed his carotid artery, paralyzing Doug but not killing him.
the blade plugged the hole like a cork.
so the removal of the blade is what killed him.
when the knife came out, it unleashed the arterial blood just as Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.
is there anything to suggest Rita didn't kill him?
you know, Horatio...
there may be.
see these dark spots in the wound?
that's clotted blood.
these darker portions are coagulated red blood cells.
the light ones are fibrin and platelets.
and a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.
with this amount of clotting, that blade had to have been inside Doug for a significant amount of time.
how long, Alexx?
30, 40 minutes.
30 to 40 minutes?
but the recorded phone call was only 25 minutes.
so we're looking at a two-part murder.
Rita started the process...
and somebody else finished it.
Hey.
how goes it?
you know, too much evidence and not enough hours in the day.
Atth's the truth.
man, you okay?
what's the matter?
I think my shoulder's out.
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you got to go see the doctor.
I can't.
this is going to go on my record, and it's going to get out that I can't shoot a shotgun.
it's not going back in on its own.
okay, well...
can you do it for me?
please.
all right.
just relax, okay?
okay.
you all right? You loose? - Okay.
all right, good. Look at me.
all right.
okay, all right.
put your arm over here.
okay?
Yeah.
all right.
just breathe.
okay.
don't try to be a tough guy, all right? - Okay.
it's only going to get worse.
if you need to, you go to the doctor. All right?
okay?
thank you.
thank you.
what are you sniffing around about?
Horatio's got me working to supercede a court order, reclaim your frozen football star's body.
working with us for a change.
you are aware of the pending new rules regarding fraternization among officers, aren't you?
new as in different after you and Yelina Salas?
things have changed.
the county's caving to the state's pressure on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.
that's interesting.
the department's redefining its policies on fraternization of officers.
you would be best served sharing that with the others in the lab.
listen, Stetler, if you have something to say to CSI Duquesne or detective Berkeley, you'd best be served telling them yourself.
duquesne and Berkeley?
I was talking about you and Boa Vista, but thank you.
Calleigh, hey.
it's Delko.
I... think I might have just put you in a jam.
give me a call back when you get the message, all right?
Hey, turn it around, Berkeley; we got a suspect in the grove.
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.
great, let's go.
I can't work this case.
Why?
because you're on it.
what are you talking about?
I've just been informed of pending changes in department policy.
are you saying that we can't work a crime scene together because we've been seeing each other?
more like we can't work a crime scene because we may have a falling out and things get ugly and job performance may suffer.
you sound like you're a firm believer.
no.
I just got Rick Stetler breathing down my neck.
how does Rick Stetler know anything about us?
I don't know.
listen, I think we should just take a step back -
let things cool down a little bit, okay?
okay.
Hey, Calleigh.
I heard you were riding over to Martin Wilson's house.
I'm going to ride with you.
you might have to.
Calleigh, what's up?
nothing.
what's wrong?
did I interrupt something?
how does rick stetler have even the faintest idea what's going on in my personal life?
it was an accident.
I left you a message.
I called you.
I didn't get it.
I never intended for this to happen, okay?
I don't like the situation with Jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.
you know that.
let's just work the case.
going somewhere, Mr. Wilson?
Ah, back again.
you guys are thorough, aren't you?
what's in the envelope, Martin?
Doug's personal effects I picked up from Precore.
you know, everything has its place.
what about the murder weapon, does it have a place?
Hey, I didn't take the knife.
he was dead, and I wasn't about to mess with him.
he wasn't dead.
he bled out after the knife was extracted.
he died over 30 minutes after he was stabbed, and you were right there.
look, I have been nothing but cooperative.
feel free to open it up.
whatever you want.
what are you doing with a body bag, Wilson?
that's Doug's also.
I'm not working now, and I figured it would be the last big ticket item I could sell.
wow, you're a real class act, Martin.
something's punctured right through the bag from the inside.
it's about the same width as the wound in Doug's neck.
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.
what a surprise.
this is coming with us.
and so are you.
precore is concerned with organ and tissue preservation.
preparing Doug Mcclain's blood vessels and cells for cryo storage.
we are not concerned about the plastic body bag.
the body bag, Dr. Klein, was used to smuggle the murder weapon away from my crime scene.
now, did you remove the knife from Mr. Mcclain's neck?
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.
I've been around long enough to know you're making enormous suppositions.
that may be, but I want you to open the tank.
you're going to have to take this up with judge Porterson.
to bring you up to speed, the judge has rescinded the court order.
so open the tank.
I... can't do that.
the neuropod's already been set to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.
we take him out, his preservation could be compromised.
and if we don't, so will yours.
open it.
what's that?
that, Mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon which we found next to your husband's body.
and that is your fingerprint.
they told me it would be 40 years before they opened that.
I can assure you the investigation can't wait that long, Mrs. Mcclain.
I didn't want to go there.
I didn't want to see Doug like that.
but Martin, his manager, insisted.
wanted me to play the part of the grieving widow.
so you kept up appearances.
I went back to the house.
I found him there.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
I called Precore.
which is when you realized he was still alive.
I heard him groan.
it was... it was so soft,
I thought I'd imagined it.
I didn't know what to do.
martin wanted to protect the estate.
his reputation.
but... I just couldn't pretend anymore.
the way doug was living his life, he was...
he was depreciating every day.
and he was dragging me and our daughter down with him.
he was just going to keep screwing up until everything just came crashing down around us.
so he was worth more to you dead than alive.
is that what you're telling me?
so I pulled out the knife.
and like that, it was over.
he bled to death.
doctor, please...
take this from me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mcclain, I can't take that knife.
my husband is the biggest name is sports.
this is publicity you can't buy.
now, if you want his body in your facility you will do this.
I'm calling 911.
precore takes their van for one lap around the block.
arrives shortly after you do.
and I play my role one last time.
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the next several years are going to be very real.
hello.
good morning, Doug.
I missed you.
who is this?
come on. I know you know me.
refresh my memory.
what did we do?
don't be naughty.
not yet.
we met at the ceremony where they retired your number.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
or what I said I'd do.
right.
brunette.
big blue eyes.
touchdown, quarterback.
let me ask you something.
are you still with your wife?
Oh, she's out. Pilates or something-- forget about her.
okay.
so, what was your most exciting experience?
winning your first, second or third ring?
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're just being bad.
okay, after the birth of my daughter, I'd have to say my induction.
I remember your speech.
you were on crutches, right?
that's right.
fourth surgery on my right knee.
it starts like an S.O.B. When it rains.
you follow football?
always been a fan.
you can blame my dad for that.
you know, I read recently that you were hospitalized.
was it anyseing thrious?
okay... now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
are you writing a story or something?
or something.
how would you like... to be remembered?
are you okay?
is everything all right?
Hello?
are you still there?
Hello?
Hey, H.
detective.
what have you got?
the victim is Doug Mcclain.
the football player.
who called it in?
the wife.
said she got back from augustine and found him on the floor.
although he retired 12 years ago, he's still a star, so when this breaks, it's gonna break big.
do we have control of the media, detective?
Oh, as good as can be expected, given the circumstances.
the body's in here. - okay
he's got a stab wound through the neck.
have we located the murder weapon yet?
did a cursory.
didn't see anything, but...
we got this.
okay.
check his phone records.
maybe he was attempting to call for help.
already working on it. - Thank you.
whoever stabbed him perfectly severed his carotid.
this spray is from his last three heartbeats.
only get that kind of force and volume with a total arterial transection.
alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.
it doesn't make sense.
Doug Mcclain was one of the best athletes of his time.
a man like this would never go down without a fight.
till today.
what's going on?
the victim's wife and that character want the body.
for what?
cryonics.
they want to freeze him?
that's what they said.
excuse me.
Mrs. Mcclain?
I'm alexx woods, M.E.
I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
but I can't let you take your husband's body.
but it was Doug's wish to be frozen until he could be cryonically revived.
he made all of the arrangements with the cryonic facility and...
and Dr. Klein...
Yes.
I understand, but that was before he died a vioeant dleth.
an autopsy could seriously compromise Doug's chances of revival.
with all due respect, doctor, fame doesn't exempt him.
I have jurisdiction over the remains of his body.
here. Does this help?
it's an injunction from judge Porterson.
an autopsy will never bring back Doug, but some day...
science will.
I have an eight- year-old daughter, and I know it sounds crazy, but...
Doug wanted to see her grow up.
this way, maybe...
one day he will see her.
and maybe even her children.
we'll just take the body.
okay, this is subject to court ajudication.
in the meantime, you better find me a seat in your van, because that body does not leave my sight.
certainly.
Mcclain was inducted into the hall of fame just last year.
famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was found murdered in his home early this morning.
he broke records in 1988 for total yards thrown.
Doug's wife, Elissa, was not available for comment.
stay tuned to channel four news, as we continue to bring you...
that's heparin, isn't it?
Yes.
you do realize an anti-coagulant is elusess on the dead, right?
dead to you, doctor.
we operate with a different definition.
heparin helps maintain tissue viability.
okay. Get him in.
you find anything, CSI Duquesne?
only smudges, detective Berkeley.
I didn't hear you leave this morning.
well, you know, a girl's got to keep some mystery.
okay.
well, what do you got on this one?
well, I can tell you there was no forced entry and this window was the only thing open.
well, it might be how the killer got in.
this doesn't belong.
what is it?
it's a piece of double-sided tape, but look at the fibers in it.
it's too short to be carpet.
I bet it was pulled off of whoever came through the window.
you find anything?
Oh, yeah.
just... probable motive.
somebody took mcclain's three championship rings.
1995 championship ball.
I'm assuming there used to be a football there.
it would have been from his last game.
took his team into the championship one last time and then retired.
the man was a class act.
you know, I knew that you liked football, but I wasn't aware that you were so into it.
well, you need your mornings, I need my sunday afternoons.
so you really think that Mcclain was killed for a few keepsakes?
keepsakes?
the stuff in this room's got to be worth a fortune.
well, then, why not take it all?
three championship rings and a signed team ball is definitely worth the most.
then I think the killer definitely knew what he was doing.
you gonna be able to pull any prints off that?
it's worth a try.
alexx, what do you got?
Doug Mcclain's wife presented a signed court order, Horatio.
signed by who?
judge porterson, Miami's leading advocate of progresvesi science.
you mean leading advocate of science fiction.
it's gonna take a hearing before I can get Doug under my knife.
by then, we could lose everything.
okay, here's what we do.
shift to plan "B.
I'm on my way to precore now.
I'll let you know.
keep me posted.
Hey, did you get a chance to look over the things I brought in from the trophy case?
Yeah. I got a print on that pair of cleats.
but it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.
well, nothing comes easy, does that?
what it's that?
you were right about the sticky tape you found by the window.
the fibers don't match anything in Mcclain's house.
it's silk.
italian silk.
killer could have brought it in on his clothing.
Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of people wear it.
well, you got anything better?
no.
but Mcclain was on the phone at the time of the murder, so Tripp is running the records to see who he was talking to.
you think he has somebody?
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
Hi.
that's a pretty top.
is it silk?
Yeah.
we're going to have to take a sample of your top to compare to some fibers we found at the Doug Mcclain crime scene.
what makes you think I was at the crime scene?
according to the phone records, you were the last person to speak to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.
the closest I got to him was the phone.
I was just updating his obituary.
I'm sorry?
newspapers like to be prepared for an unexpected death.
we have obituaries of people still alive on file so when they pass, we're ready to print.
that is morbid.
so I take it that you're a reporter?
my boss gave me a list of names and told me to update them.
and people will just talk to you?
you figure out ways to get them to open up.
Doug was a jock.
it's pretty obvious what part of the ego you have to stroke.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
that's the list of people that I had to update.
see? Doug Mcclain?
I don't understand why Doug would be at the top the list.
he doesn't have near the medical history of these other people.
my boss says that retired football players have a high mortality rate.
something about the abuse to their bodies.
and the abuse got a whole lot worse during the phone call.
am I right?
what are you accusing me of?
it just seems to be an incredible coincidence that
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the same day you were updating his obituary.
that doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.
are you sure?
you didn't keep Doug on the phone so that someone would have opportunity to kill him?
why would I do that?
I don't know.
but I'm going to find out.
have you prepped the equipment, doctor?
Yes.
what are you using it for?
well, if I can't perform a traditional autopsy to figure out what happened to him,
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.
as long as you do it quickly.
we need to get him into a neuropod asap.
I have to warn you, it's going to be freezing in there.
Yes.
Horatio. Yes.
I'm working on our quarterback now.
right. Right. But this will take longer than the real thing.
I have to compile each scan until I get a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.
I understand, Alexx. What else?
according to early data, he does have a fracture on his hand.
looks like to the second metacarpal, with swelling around the wrist.
swelling around the wrist?
perhaps he punched someone or something, huh?
Yeah.
looks like he may have fought back after all.
maybe. Keep me posted.
Hey.
Hey. You hear anything from calleigh about the obit writer?
Calleigh couldn't place her at the scene.
all right. I guess we keep digging, huh?
what have you got?
well, I'm trying to track down Doug Mcclain's stolen memorabilia off the internet.
how many sites have you been to?
14... so far.
you know how many sites there are, right?
Yeah.
wait a minute. Go back.
there's some football stuff there.
championship rings.
that them?
looks like it.
championship years '92,'93 and '95.
Yeah. And there's the football right there.
Oh, ye of little faith.
all of these items were put up for auction by a Theo Knight.
well, Theo's about to get a very disappointing return on his investment -
let me call Horatio.
why do you guys need my prints?
we have reason to believe that Doug Mcclain was killed during a robbery of his football memorabilia.
you seem like quite a fan, Theo.
my dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.
every snap. Every pass.
what, you guys think I broke into his house to steal from his personal collection?
we don't know.
we found a fingerprint, though, on an old cleat of his.
is that going to match one of these?
it may.
I was there two weeks ago, but not last night.
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.
so he sold you three championship rings and an autographed team ball willingly?
well, his manager did.
he gave me a good price.
I had to have it.
you had to have it?
you were online within hours of his murder selling it, Theo.
I was going to add it to my collection here, but when one of these legends dies, collectors go into a frenzy.
right.
news breaks, your 100-k investment climbs up to seven figures. Is that right?
I guess I'm a lucky guy.
Yes, but not for long.
tragic day for the sports world, Mr. Wilson.
Doug Mcclain was a legend.
Yes. And I understand you were his business manager.
and now I'm managing his estate.
and selling it off rather rapidly, too.
what are you talking about?
apparently, you just sold some pieces of memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.
I had to.
Doug had, um...
cash flow problems.
he spent money like he was still in his prime.
got so bad, I had to sell his stuff just to keep him afloat.
I notice that you have a black eye.
now, we found Mr. Mcclain with a broken hand.
am I to assume that he was not happy about what you were doing?
it was a sore subject.
Dougie wore those on that naked bootleg,'93.
game winner.
what else you got?
well, over here we have his first...
what the hell's going on?
you told me a reporter was coming in here.
would you excuse us for a minute?
sure.
Thanks.
you're selling all my stuff?
this is my life.
if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a life.
was that before you killed him this morning?
I was nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
you can check.
I'm going to.
you're running the double-sided tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?
Yeah. I already did.
you had silk fibers on one side, but even better-- epithelials on the other.
and what would cause that?
you're such a guy.
remember j-lo's green versace dress?
what do you think held that up?
double-sided adhesive?
this is wardrobe tape.
did you get a profile from it?
CODIS should tell us any second.
she's got an interesting rap sheet.
one and only arrest, 2004, for breaking and entering a residence.
Yeah. She broke into Doug Mcclain's house.
that was three years ago, and that was a complete misunderstanding.
Doug and I were having an affair, and his wife caught us in their bed, and she completely overreacted.
you know that Doug Mcclain's dead?
I know. I saw it on tv.
well, we found tape from your dress that proves you entered his house again, through a window.
that's because Doug called me a few days ago and asked me if I wanted to come over.
he said his wife was away.
did you?
and when I got there, he wasn't home yet.
so why not wait, hmm?
why climb through a window?
I knew Doug since his playing days.
we had a special relationship.
and I wanted to surprise him.
I was gone before dawn.
can you prove that?
look, I know what you're trying to say, but I would never hurt Doug.
never.
I think you got tired of climbing through windows, miss Sullivan.
I think you got tired of being Doug's second choice.
being Doug Mcclain's second choice was more than any girl could ask for.
except being his first.
you know, there is a great thai restaurant next to the shore club.
you don't give up, do you?
neither do I.
now, be careful with that, girl.
you gotta make sure it's pulled right back to your...
shoulder or it's going to kick back. You okay?
okay?
all right.
Yep. I'm good. All right.
I'm going to check out.
Oh, yeah?
you know, I... I saw what happened out there.
is your, um, shoulder okay?
Yep. I'm fine.
it's good.
okay.
take care of that shoulder.
by now, the world has heard about the death of sports legend Doug Mcclain, but tonight, on tape, you will hear his actual death at the hand of his murderers.
don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter in the mystery that is gripping the nation.
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to take another look at that obituary writer.
okay, so I didn't exactly tell you everything.
that is the understatement of the year, miss Legassic.
I did call Mr. Mcclain for my article.
but you conveniently left out the part where you had the murder recorded.
I was taping the conversation so I wouldn't miss anything.
at the time, I wasn't even sure what I was hearing.
what exactly did you hear?
I can't say.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement with the tv station.
it's legally binding.
so are handcuffs.
it's your choice, Wendy.
he was literally talking to me one second and gone the next.
I kept recording until my cell battery ran out.
and so your first instinct after you found out he was killed was to sell the tape?
I'm not a monster, officer.
I just wanted to get out of the obituary business.
you thought the recording would make you a reporter at WETX.
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.
that tape is never gonna make it to tv.
a judge has issued a warrant,
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting you for obstruction of justice.
your journalism career died with Doug Mcclain.
you can write an obituary for it.
okay, I uploaded Wendy Legassic's phone conversations.
what's next?
let's start with Doug Mcclain's final words.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
Doug, are you okay?
okay, now search for spiking activity.
here's some activity.
almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.
now, that sounds like somebody moving around the house, doesn't it?
and that's somebody making a phone call.
ten digits; an area code and a phone number.
track the numbers.
I'm on it.
I use reverse directory.
lieutenant, why would the killer be calling the victim's wife?
because they must be connected.
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire somebody to kill your husband?
absolutely not.
why would you ask that?
because it turns out that you and your husband weren't living together, and your current listing is in coral gables under your maiden name.
Doug and I have been separated for a year now.
I have my own place, but we're discreet about it.
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about image control, public perception, his legacy.
it was his livelihood.
and a divorce would taint that.
fans hold an idealized view of Doug, and they pay big for that perfect, infallible ideal.
okay, so let me ask you this.
if you didn't hire somebody to kill him, who called you from the crime scene?
Doug's manager called.
why would he do that?
to tell me what happened.
he wanted me back at the house before the police or the press got there, because everybody thinks that Doug and I are still together.
was he there when you arrived?
no.
do you think he killed Doug?
do you?
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa mcclain places you at the scene at the time of the murder.
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.
I'm his manager.
and when I found his body, I called Elissa.
cause you told us you were nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
now, that's a flat-out lie.
look, this is all about discretion, damage control.
I started collecting things that Doug wouldn't want the public to find out about:
whiskey bottles, diet pills, little blue pills, then I got out of there.
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.
I'd like the items, Mr. Wilson.
who's this?
I took care of everything for him but that.
never got a straight answer.
I think it's time to get one.
so, are there prints on the photograph?
Yeah, but it's not usable.
but the kid's wearing Doug's old number, and that can't be a coincidence.
no, it's not.
also, I can see part of a logo on the back of his helmet.
and it looks to me like it says "Lauderhill.
lauderhill youth program.
exactly. That's what I thought.
Yes.
more importantly, Natalia, who is this kid?
I'll call Lauderhill.
we got to find him.
lieutenant, April.
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.
thank you for coming in.
so you received our e-mail.
I guess we're hoping that you may be able to identify the child in the photograph.
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a youth football team every summer.
he was our star quarterback.
where might I find him?
lieutenant, he had a rare kidney disease.
he died last week.
what's his name?
may I?
sure.
is that your son, miss Sullivan?
Yes.
who's his father?
but in DNA only.
Caleb was only six years old when he died.
you know, I never asked Doug for anything-- money, nothing.
I raised Caleb all on my own.
he was everything to me.
and then he got sick.
his kidneys failed, didn't they?
I would have given him both of mine, but I wasn't a match, and there was a good chance that Doug was.
Dougie, he idolizes you.
he even put your number on his jersey. Please.
if he doesn't get this transplant, he will die.
I'll need to check with my attorney about this, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
please, Dougie, he's so young.
I'll give you a call next week.
Dougie, come on!
I never heard from him.
you know, everyone acts like Doug Mcclain was some big hero, but the man turned his back on his own son.
you broke into the house this morning, didn't you?
Yeah.
I heard doug on the phone with some new girl.
same as he ever was.
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
then you stabbed him, rita, didn't you?
Yeah.
okay.
where is the knife now?
I left it in him.
Why? It's not there?
miss Sullivan, someone removed it.
Rita Sullivan confessed?
alexx, she confessed to leaving the knife in the body.
we never recovered it.
wasn't at the scene.
well, that changes the scenario.
although, I'm sure she meant to finish Doug off.
but she didn't, did she?
no.
according to the virtopsy data, when the knife went in, it severed his carotid artery, paralyzing Doug but not killing him.
the blade plugged the hole like a cork.
so the removal of the blade is what killed him.
when the knife came out, it unleashed the arterial blood just as Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.
is there anything to suggest Rita didn't kill him?
you know, Horatio...
there may be.
see these dark spots in the wound?
that's clotted blood.
these darker portions are coagulated red blood cells.
the light ones are fibrin and platelets.
and a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.
with this amount of clotting, that blade had to have been inside Doug for a significant amount of time.
how long, Alexx?
30, 40 minutes.
30 to 40 minutes?
but the recorded phone call was only 25 minutes.
so we're looking at a two-part murder.
Rita started the process...
and somebody else finished it.
Hey.
how goes it?
you know, too much evidence and not enough hours in the day.
Atth's the truth.
man, you okay?
what's the matter?
I think my shoulder's out.
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you got to go see the doctor.
I can't.
this is going to go on my record, and it's going to get out that I can't shoot a shotgun.
it's not going back in on its own.
okay, well...
can you do it for me?
please.
all right.
just relax, okay?
okay.
you all right? You loose? - Okay.
all right, good. Look at me.
all right.
okay, all right.
put your arm over here.
okay?
Yeah.
all right.
just breathe.
okay.
don't try to be a tough guy, all right? - Okay.
it's only going to get worse.
if you need to, you go to the doctor. All right?
okay?
thank you.
thank you.
what are you sniffing around about?
Horatio's got me working to supercede a court order, reclaim your frozen football star's body.
working with us for a change.
you are aware of the pending new rules regarding fraternization among officers, aren't you?
new as in different after you and Yelina Salas?
things have changed.
the county's caving to the state's pressure on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.
that's interesting.
the department's redefining its policies on fraternization of officers.
you would be best served sharing that with the others in the lab.
listen, Stetler, if you have something to say to CSI Duquesne or detective Berkeley, you'd best be served telling them yourself.
duquesne and Berkeley?
I was talking about you and Boa Vista, but thank you.
Calleigh, hey.
it's Delko.
I... think I might have just put you in a jam.
give me a call back when you get the message, all right?
Hey, turn it around, Berkeley; we got a suspect in the grove.
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.
great, let's go.
I can't work this case.
Why?
because you're on it.
what are you talking about?
I've just been informed of pending changes in department policy.
are you saying that we can't work a crime scene together because we've been seeing each other?
more like we can't work a crime scene because we may have a falling out and things get ugly and job performance may suffer.
you sound like you're a firm believer.
no.
I just got Rick Stetler breathing down my neck.
how does Rick Stetler know anything about us?
I don't know.
listen, I think we should just take a step back -
let things cool down a little bit, okay?
okay.
Hey, Calleigh.
I heard you were riding over to Martin Wilson's house.
I'm going to ride with you.
you might have to.
Calleigh, what's up?
nothing.
what's wrong?
did I interrupt something?
how does rick stetler have even the faintest idea what's going on in my personal life?
it was an accident.
I left you a message.
I called you.
I didn't get it.
I never intended for this to happen, okay?
I don't like the situation with Jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.
you know that.
let's just work the case.
going somewhere, Mr. Wilson?
Ah, back again.
you guys are thorough, aren't you?
what's in the envelope, Martin?
Doug's personal effects I picked up from Precore.
you know, everything has its place.
what about the murder weapon, does it have a place?
Hey, I didn't take the knife.
he was dead, and I wasn't about to mess with him.
he wasn't dead.
he bled out after the knife was extracted.
he died over 30 minutes after he was stabbed, and you were right there.
look, I have been nothing but cooperative.
feel free to open it up.
whatever you want.
what are you doing with a body bag, Wilson?
that's Doug's also.
I'm not working now, and I figured it would be the last big ticket item I could sell.
wow, you're a real class act, Martin.
something's punctured right through the bag from the inside.
it's about the same width as the wound in Doug's neck.
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.
what a surprise.
this is coming with us.
and so are you.
precore is concerned with organ and tissue preservation.
preparing Doug Mcclain's blood vessels and cells for cryo storage.
we are not concerned about the plastic body bag.
the body bag, Dr. Klein, was used to smuggle the murder weapon away from my crime scene.
now, did you remove the knife from Mr. Mcclain's neck?
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.
I've been around long enough to know you're making enormous suppositions.
that may be, but I want you to open the tank.
you're going to have to take this up with judge Porterson.
to bring you up to speed, the judge has rescinded the court order.
so open the tank.
I... can't do that.
the neuropod's already been set to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.
we take him out, his preservation could be compromised.
and if we don't, so will yours.
open it.
what's that?
that, Mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon which we found next to your husband's body.
and that is your fingerprint.
they told me it would be 40 years before they opened that.
I can assure you the investigation can't wait that long, Mrs. Mcclain.
I didn't want to go there.
I didn't want to see Doug like that.
but Martin, his manager, insisted.
wanted me to play the part of the grieving widow.
so you kept up appearances.
I went back to the house.
I found him there.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
I called Precore.
which is when you realized he was still alive.
I heard him groan.
it was... it was so soft,
I thought I'd imagined it.
I didn't know what to do.
martin wanted to protect the estate.
his reputation.
but... I just couldn't pretend anymore.
the way doug was living his life, he was...
he was depreciating every day.
and he was dragging me and our daughter down with him.
he was just going to keep screwing up until everything just came crashing down around us.
so he was worth more to you dead than alive.
is that what you're telling me?
so I pulled out the knife.
and like that, it was over.
he bled to death.
doctor, please...
take this from me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mcclain, I can't take that knife.
my husband is the biggest name is sports.
this is publicity you can't buy.
now, if you want his body in your facility you will do this.
I'm calling 911.
precore takes their van for one lap around the block.
arrives shortly after you do.
and I play my role one last time.
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the next several years are going to be very real.
good morning, Doug.
I missed you.
who is this?
come on. I know you know me.
refresh my memory.
what did we do?
don't be naughty.
not yet.
we met at the ceremony where they retired your number.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
or what I said I'd do.
right.
brunette.
big blue eyes.
touchdown, quarterback.
let me ask you something.
are you still with your wife?
Oh, she's out. Pilates or something-- forget about her.
okay.
so, what was your most exciting experience?
winning your first, second or third ring?
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're just being bad.
okay, after the birth of my daughter, I'd have to say my induction.
I remember your speech.
you were on crutches, right?
that's right.
fourth surgery on my right knee.
it starts like an S.O.B. When it rains.
you follow football?
always been a fan.
you can blame my dad for that.
you know, I read recently that you were hospitalized.
was it anyseing thrious?
okay... now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
are you writing a story or something?
or something.
how would you like... to be remembered?
are you okay?
is everything all right?
Hello?
are you still there?
Hello?
Hey, H.
detective.
what have you got?
the victim is Doug Mcclain.
the football player.
who called it in?
the wife.
said she got back from augustine and found him on the floor.
although he retired 12 years ago, he's still a star, so when this breaks, it's gonna break big.
do we have control of the media, detective?
Oh, as good as can be expected, given the circumstances.
the body's in here. - okay
he's got a stab wound through the neck.
have we located the murder weapon yet?
did a cursory.
didn't see anything, but...
we got this.
okay.
check his phone records.
maybe he was attempting to call for help.
already working on it. - Thank you.
whoever stabbed him perfectly severed his carotid.
this spray is from his last three heartbeats.
only get that kind of force and volume with a total arterial transection.
alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.
it doesn't make sense.
Doug Mcclain was one of the best athletes of his time.
a man like this would never go down without a fight.
till today.
what's going on?
the victim's wife and that character want the body.
for what?
cryonics.
they want to freeze him?
that's what they said.
excuse me.
Mrs. Mcclain?
I'm alexx woods, M.E.
I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
but I can't let you take your husband's body.
but it was Doug's wish to be frozen until he could be cryonically revived.
he made all of the arrangements with the cryonic facility and...
and Dr. Klein...
Yes.
I understand, but that was before he died a vioeant dleth.
an autopsy could seriously compromise Doug's chances of revival.
with all due respect, doctor, fame doesn't exempt him.
I have jurisdiction over the remains of his body.
here. Does this help?
it's an injunction from judge Porterson.
an autopsy will never bring back Doug, but some day...
science will.
I have an eight- year-old daughter, and I know it sounds crazy, but...
Doug wanted to see her grow up.
this way, maybe...
one day he will see her.
and maybe even her children.
we'll just take the body.
okay, this is subject to court ajudication.
in the meantime, you better find me a seat in your van, because that body does not leave my sight.
certainly.
Mcclain was inducted into the hall of fame just last year.
famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was found murdered in his home early this morning.
he broke records in 1988 for total yards thrown.
Doug's wife, Elissa, was not available for comment.
stay tuned to channel four news, as we continue to bring you...
that's heparin, isn't it?
Yes.
you do realize an anti-coagulant is elusess on the dead, right?
dead to you, doctor.
we operate with a different definition.
heparin helps maintain tissue viability.
okay. Get him in.
you find anything, CSI Duquesne?
only smudges, detective Berkeley.
I didn't hear you leave this morning.
well, you know, a girl's got to keep some mystery.
okay.
well, what do you got on this one?
well, I can tell you there was no forced entry and this window was the only thing open.
well, it might be how the killer got in.
this doesn't belong.
what is it?
it's a piece of double-sided tape, but look at the fibers in it.
it's too short to be carpet.
I bet it was pulled off of whoever came through the window.
you find anything?
Oh, yeah.
just... probable motive.
somebody took mcclain's three championship rings.
1995 championship ball.
I'm assuming there used to be a football there.
it would have been from his last game.
took his team into the championship one last time and then retired.
the man was a class act.
you know, I knew that you liked football, but I wasn't aware that you were so into it.
well, you need your mornings, I need my sunday afternoons.
so you really think that Mcclain was killed for a few keepsakes?
keepsakes?
the stuff in this room's got to be worth a fortune.
well, then, why not take it all?
three championship rings and a signed team ball is definitely worth the most.
then I think the killer definitely knew what he was doing.
you gonna be able to pull any prints off that?
it's worth a try.
alexx, what do you got?
Doug Mcclain's wife presented a signed court order, Horatio.
signed by who?
judge porterson, Miami's leading advocate of progresvesi science.
you mean leading advocate of science fiction.
it's gonna take a hearing before I can get Doug under my knife.
by then, we could lose everything.
okay, here's what we do.
shift to plan "B.
I'm on my way to precore now.
I'll let you know.
keep me posted.
Hey, did you get a chance to look over the things I brought in from the trophy case?
Yeah. I got a print on that pair of cleats.
but it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.
well, nothing comes easy, does that?
what it's that?
you were right about the sticky tape you found by the window.
the fibers don't match anything in Mcclain's house.
it's silk.
italian silk.
killer could have brought it in on his clothing.
Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of people wear it.
well, you got anything better?
no.
but Mcclain was on the phone at the time of the murder, so Tripp is running the records to see who he was talking to.
you think he has somebody?
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
Hi.
that's a pretty top.
is it silk?
Yeah.
we're going to have to take a sample of your top to compare to some fibers we found at the Doug Mcclain crime scene.
what makes you think I was at the crime scene?
according to the phone records, you were the last person to speak to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.
the closest I got to him was the phone.
I was just updating his obituary.
I'm sorry?
newspapers like to be prepared for an unexpected death.
we have obituaries of people still alive on file so when they pass, we're ready to print.
that is morbid.
so I take it that you're a reporter?
my boss gave me a list of names and told me to update them.
and people will just talk to you?
you figure out ways to get them to open up.
Doug was a jock.
it's pretty obvious what part of the ego you have to stroke.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
that's the list of people that I had to update.
see? Doug Mcclain?
I don't understand why Doug would be at the top the list.
he doesn't have near the medical history of these other people.
my boss says that retired football players have a high mortality rate.
something about the abuse to their bodies.
and the abuse got a whole lot worse during the phone call.
am I right?
what are you accusing me of?
it just seems to be an incredible coincidence that
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the same day you were updating his obituary.
that doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.
are you sure?
you didn't keep Doug on the phone so that someone would have opportunity to kill him?
why would I do that?
I don't know.
but I'm going to find out.
have you prepped the equipment, doctor?
Yes.
what are you using it for?
well, if I can't perform a traditional autopsy to figure out what happened to him,
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.
as long as you do it quickly.
we need to get him into a neuropod asap.
I have to warn you, it's going to be freezing in there.
Yes.
Horatio. Yes.
I'm working on our quarterback now.
right. Right. But this will take longer than the real thing.
I have to compile each scan until I get a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.
I understand, Alexx. What else?
according to early data, he does have a fracture on his hand.
looks like to the second metacarpal, with swelling around the wrist.
swelling around the wrist?
perhaps he punched someone or something, huh?
Yeah.
looks like he may have fought back after all.
maybe. Keep me posted.
Hey.
Hey. You hear anything from calleigh about the obit writer?
Calleigh couldn't place her at the scene.
all right. I guess we keep digging, huh?
what have you got?
well, I'm trying to track down Doug Mcclain's stolen memorabilia off the internet.
how many sites have you been to?
14... so far.
you know how many sites there are, right?
Yeah.
wait a minute. Go back.
there's some football stuff there.
championship rings.
that them?
looks like it.
championship years '92,'93 and '95.
Yeah. And there's the football right there.
Oh, ye of little faith.
all of these items were put up for auction by a Theo Knight.
well, Theo's about to get a very disappointing return on his investment -
let me call Horatio.
why do you guys need my prints?
we have reason to believe that Doug Mcclain was killed during a robbery of his football memorabilia.
you seem like quite a fan, Theo.
my dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.
every snap. Every pass.
what, you guys think I broke into his house to steal from his personal collection?
we don't know.
we found a fingerprint, though, on an old cleat of his.
is that going to match one of these?
it may.
I was there two weeks ago, but not last night.
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.
so he sold you three championship rings and an autographed team ball willingly?
well, his manager did.
he gave me a good price.
I had to have it.
you had to have it?
you were online within hours of his murder selling it, Theo.
I was going to add it to my collection here, but when one of these legends dies, collectors go into a frenzy.
right.
news breaks, your 100-k investment climbs up to seven figures. Is that right?
I guess I'm a lucky guy.
Yes, but not for long.
tragic day for the sports world, Mr. Wilson.
Doug Mcclain was a legend.
Yes. And I understand you were his business manager.
and now I'm managing his estate.
and selling it off rather rapidly, too.
what are you talking about?
apparently, you just sold some pieces of memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.
I had to.
Doug had, um...
cash flow problems.
he spent money like he was still in his prime.
got so bad, I had to sell his stuff just to keep him afloat.
I notice that you have a black eye.
now, we found Mr. Mcclain with a broken hand.
am I to assume that he was not happy about what you were doing?
it was a sore subject.
Dougie wore those on that naked bootleg,'93.
game winner.
what else you got?
well, over here we have his first...
what the hell's going on?
you told me a reporter was coming in here.
would you excuse us for a minute?
sure.
Thanks.
you're selling all my stuff?
this is my life.
if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a life.
was that before you killed him this morning?
I was nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
you can check.
I'm going to.
you're running the double-sided tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?
Yeah. I already did.
you had silk fibers on one side, but even better-- epithelials on the other.
and what would cause that?
you're such a guy.
remember j-lo's green versace dress?
what do you think held that up?
double-sided adhesive?
this is wardrobe tape.
did you get a profile from it?
CODIS should tell us any second.
she's got an interesting rap sheet.
one and only arrest, 2004, for breaking and entering a residence.
Yeah. She broke into Doug Mcclain's house.
that was three years ago, and that was a complete misunderstanding.
Doug and I were having an affair, and his wife caught us in their bed, and she completely overreacted.
you know that Doug Mcclain's dead?
I know. I saw it on tv.
well, we found tape from your dress that proves you entered his house again, through a window.
that's because Doug called me a few days ago and asked me if I wanted to come over.
he said his wife was away.
did you?
and when I got there, he wasn't home yet.
so why not wait, hmm?
why climb through a window?
I knew Doug since his playing days.
we had a special relationship.
and I wanted to surprise him.
I was gone before dawn.
can you prove that?
look, I know what you're trying to say, but I would never hurt Doug.
never.
I think you got tired of climbing through windows, miss Sullivan.
I think you got tired of being Doug's second choice.
being Doug Mcclain's second choice was more than any girl could ask for.
except being his first.
you know, there is a great thai restaurant next to the shore club.
you don't give up, do you?
neither do I.
now, be careful with that, girl.
you gotta make sure it's pulled right back to your...
shoulder or it's going to kick back. You okay?
okay?
all right.
Yep. I'm good. All right.
I'm going to check out.
Oh, yeah?
you know, I... I saw what happened out there.
is your, um, shoulder okay?
Yep. I'm fine.
it's good.
okay.
take care of that shoulder.
by now, the world has heard about the death of sports legend Doug Mcclain, but tonight, on tape, you will hear his actual death at the hand of his murderers.
don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter in the mystery that is gripping the nation.
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to take another look at that obituary writer.
okay, so I didn't exactly tell you everything.
that is the understatement of the year, miss Legassic.
I did call Mr. Mcclain for my article.
but you conveniently left out the part where you had the murder recorded.
I was taping the conversation so I wouldn't miss anything.
at the time, I wasn't even sure what I was hearing.
what exactly did you hear?
I can't say.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement with the tv station.
it's legally binding.
so are handcuffs.
it's your choice, Wendy.
he was literally talking to me one second and gone the next.
I kept recording until my cell battery ran out.
and so your first instinct after you found out he was killed was to sell the tape?
I'm not a monster, officer.
I just wanted to get out of the obituary business.
you thought the recording would make you a reporter at WETX.
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.
that tape is never gonna make it to tv.
a judge has issued a warrant,
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting you for obstruction of justice.
your journalism career died with Doug Mcclain.
you can write an obituary for it.
okay, I uploaded Wendy Legassic's phone conversations.
what's next?
let's start with Doug Mcclain's final words.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
Doug, are you okay?
okay, now search for spiking activity.
here's some activity.
almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.
now, that sounds like somebody moving around the house, doesn't it?
and that's somebody making a phone call.
ten digits; an area code and a phone number.
track the numbers.
I'm on it.
I use reverse directory.
lieutenant, why would the killer be calling the victim's wife?
because they must be connected.
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire somebody to kill your husband?
absolutely not.
why would you ask that?
because it turns out that you and your husband weren't living together, and your current listing is in coral gables under your maiden name.
Doug and I have been separated for a year now.
I have my own place, but we're discreet about it.
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about image control, public perception, his legacy.
it was his livelihood.
and a divorce would taint that.
fans hold an idealized view of Doug, and they pay big for that perfect, infallible ideal.
okay, so let me ask you this.
if you didn't hire somebody to kill him, who called you from the crime scene?
Doug's manager called.
why would he do that?
to tell me what happened.
he wanted me back at the house before the police or the press got there, because everybody thinks that Doug and I are still together.
was he there when you arrived?
no.
do you think he killed Doug?
do you?
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa mcclain places you at the scene at the time of the murder.
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.
I'm his manager.
and when I found his body, I called Elissa.
cause you told us you were nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
now, that's a flat-out lie.
look, this is all about discretion, damage control.
I started collecting things that Doug wouldn't want the public to find out about:
whiskey bottles, diet pills, little blue pills, then I got out of there.
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.
I'd like the items, Mr. Wilson.
who's this?
I took care of everything for him but that.
never got a straight answer.
I think it's time to get one.
so, are there prints on the photograph?
Yeah, but it's not usable.
but the kid's wearing Doug's old number, and that can't be a coincidence.
no, it's not.
also, I can see part of a logo on the back of his helmet.
and it looks to me like it says "Lauderhill.
lauderhill youth program.
exactly. That's what I thought.
Yes.
more importantly, Natalia, who is this kid?
I'll call Lauderhill.
we got to find him.
lieutenant, April.
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.
thank you for coming in.
so you received our e-mail.
I guess we're hoping that you may be able to identify the child in the photograph.
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a youth football team every summer.
he was our star quarterback.
where might I find him?
lieutenant, he had a rare kidney disease.
he died last week.
what's his name?
may I?
sure.
is that your son, miss Sullivan?
Yes.
who's his father?
but in DNA only.
Caleb was only six years old when he died.
you know, I never asked Doug for anything-- money, nothing.
I raised Caleb all on my own.
he was everything to me.
and then he got sick.
his kidneys failed, didn't they?
I would have given him both of mine, but I wasn't a match, and there was a good chance that Doug was.
Dougie, he idolizes you.
he even put your number on his jersey. Please.
if he doesn't get this transplant, he will die.
I'll need to check with my attorney about this, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
please, Dougie, he's so young.
I'll give you a call next week.
Dougie, come on!
I never heard from him.
you know, everyone acts like Doug Mcclain was some big hero, but the man turned his back on his own son.
you broke into the house this morning, didn't you?
Yeah.
I heard doug on the phone with some new girl.
same as he ever was.
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
then you stabbed him, rita, didn't you?
Yeah.
okay.
where is the knife now?
I left it in him.
Why? It's not there?
miss Sullivan, someone removed it.
Rita Sullivan confessed?
alexx, she confessed to leaving the knife in the body.
we never recovered it.
wasn't at the scene.
well, that changes the scenario.
although, I'm sure she meant to finish Doug off.
but she didn't, did she?
no.
according to the virtopsy data, when the knife went in, it severed his carotid artery, paralyzing Doug but not killing him.
the blade plugged the hole like a cork.
so the removal of the blade is what killed him.
when the knife came out, it unleashed the arterial blood just as Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.
is there anything to suggest Rita didn't kill him?
you know, Horatio...
there may be.
see these dark spots in the wound?
that's clotted blood.
these darker portions are coagulated red blood cells.
the light ones are fibrin and platelets.
and a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.
with this amount of clotting, that blade had to have been inside Doug for a significant amount of time.
how long, Alexx?
30, 40 minutes.
30 to 40 minutes?
but the recorded phone call was only 25 minutes.
so we're looking at a two-part murder.
Rita started the process...
and somebody else finished it.
Hey.
how goes it?
you know, too much evidence and not enough hours in the day.
Atth's the truth.
man, you okay?
what's the matter?
I think my shoulder's out.
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you got to go see the doctor.
I can't.
this is going to go on my record, and it's going to get out that I can't shoot a shotgun.
it's not going back in on its own.
okay, well...
can you do it for me?
please.
all right.
just relax, okay?
okay.
you all right? You loose? - Okay.
all right, good. Look at me.
all right.
okay, all right.
put your arm over here.
okay?
Yeah.
all right.
just breathe.
okay.
don't try to be a tough guy, all right? - Okay.
it's only going to get worse.
if you need to, you go to the doctor. All right?
okay?
thank you.
thank you.
what are you sniffing around about?
Horatio's got me working to supercede a court order, reclaim your frozen football star's body.
working with us for a change.
you are aware of the pending new rules regarding fraternization among officers, aren't you?
new as in different after you and Yelina Salas?
things have changed.
the county's caving to the state's pressure on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.
that's interesting.
the department's redefining its policies on fraternization of officers.
you would be best served sharing that with the others in the lab.
listen, Stetler, if you have something to say to CSI Duquesne or detective Berkeley, you'd best be served telling them yourself.
duquesne and Berkeley?
I was talking about you and Boa Vista, but thank you.
Calleigh, hey.
it's Delko.
I... think I might have just put you in a jam.
give me a call back when you get the message, all right?
Hey, turn it around, Berkeley; we got a suspect in the grove.
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.
great, let's go.
I can't work this case.
Why?
because you're on it.
what are you talking about?
I've just been informed of pending changes in department policy.
are you saying that we can't work a crime scene together because we've been seeing each other?
more like we can't work a crime scene because we may have a falling out and things get ugly and job performance may suffer.
you sound like you're a firm believer.
no.
I just got Rick Stetler breathing down my neck.
how does Rick Stetler know anything about us?
I don't know.
listen, I think we should just take a step back -
let things cool down a little bit, okay?
okay.
Hey, Calleigh.
I heard you were riding over to Martin Wilson's house.
I'm going to ride with you.
you might have to.
Calleigh, what's up?
nothing.
what's wrong?
did I interrupt something?
how does rick stetler have even the faintest idea what's going on in my personal life?
it was an accident.
I left you a message.
I called you.
I didn't get it.
I never intended for this to happen, okay?
I don't like the situation with Jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.
you know that.
let's just work the case.
going somewhere, Mr. Wilson?
Ah, back again.
you guys are thorough, aren't you?
what's in the envelope, Martin?
Doug's personal effects I picked up from Precore.
you know, everything has its place.
what about the murder weapon, does it have a place?
Hey, I didn't take the knife.
he was dead, and I wasn't about to mess with him.
he wasn't dead.
he bled out after the knife was extracted.
he died over 30 minutes after he was stabbed, and you were right there.
look, I have been nothing but cooperative.
feel free to open it up.
whatever you want.
what are you doing with a body bag, Wilson?
that's Doug's also.
I'm not working now, and I figured it would be the last big ticket item I could sell.
wow, you're a real class act, Martin.
something's punctured right through the bag from the inside.
it's about the same width as the wound in Doug's neck.
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.
what a surprise.
this is coming with us.
and so are you.
precore is concerned with organ and tissue preservation.
preparing Doug Mcclain's blood vessels and cells for cryo storage.
we are not concerned about the plastic body bag.
the body bag, Dr. Klein, was used to smuggle the murder weapon away from my crime scene.
now, did you remove the knife from Mr. Mcclain's neck?
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.
I've been around long enough to know you're making enormous suppositions.
that may be, but I want you to open the tank.
you're going to have to take this up with judge Porterson.
to bring you up to speed, the judge has rescinded the court order.
so open the tank.
I... can't do that.
the neuropod's already been set to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.
we take him out, his preservation could be compromised.
and if we don't, so will yours.
open it.
what's that?
that, Mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon which we found next to your husband's body.
and that is your fingerprint.
they told me it would be 40 years before they opened that.
I can assure you the investigation can't wait that long, Mrs. Mcclain.
I didn't want to go there.
I didn't want to see Doug like that.
but Martin, his manager, insisted.
wanted me to play the part of the grieving widow.
so you kept up appearances.
I went back to the house.
I found him there.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
I called Precore.
which is when you realized he was still alive.
I heard him groan.
it was... it was so soft,
I thought I'd imagined it.
I didn't know what to do.
martin wanted to protect the estate.
his reputation.
but... I just couldn't pretend anymore.
the way doug was living his life, he was...
he was depreciating every day.
and he was dragging me and our daughter down with him.
he was just going to keep screwing up until everything just came crashing down around us.
so he was worth more to you dead than alive.
is that what you're telling me?
so I pulled out the knife.
and like that, it was over.
he bled to death.
doctor, please...
take this from me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mcclain, I can't take that knife.
my husband is the biggest name is sports.
this is publicity you can't buy.
now, if you want his body in your facility you will do this.
I'm calling 911.
precore takes their van for one lap around the block.
arrives shortly after you do.
and I play my role one last time.
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the next several years are going to be very real.
hello.
good morning, Doug.
I missed you.
who is this?
come on. I know you know me.
refresh my memory.
what did we do?
don't be naughty.
not yet.
we met at the ceremony where they retired your number.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
or what I said I'd do.
right.
brunette.
big blue eyes.
touchdown, quarterback.
let me ask you something.
are you still with your wife?
Oh, she's out. Pilates or something-- forget about her.
okay.
so, what was your most exciting experience?
winning your first, second or third ring?
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're just being bad.
okay, after the birth of my daughter, I'd have to say my induction.
I remember your speech.
you were on crutches, right?
that's right.
fourth surgery on my right knee.
it starts like an S.O.B. When it rains.
you follow football?
always been a fan.
you can blame my dad for that.
you know, I read recently that you were hospitalized.
was it anyseing thrious?
okay... now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
are you writing a story or something?
or something.
how would you like... to be remembered?
are you okay?
is everything all right?
Hello?
are you still there?
Hello?
Hey, H.
detective.
what have you got?
the victim is Doug Mcclain.
the football player.
who called it in?
the wife.
said she got back from augustine and found him on the floor.
although he retired 12 years ago, he's still a star, so when this breaks, it's gonna break big.
do we have control of the media, detective?
Oh, as good as can be expected, given the circumstances.
the body's in here. - okay
he's got a stab wound through the neck.
have we located the murder weapon yet?
did a cursory.
didn't see anything, but...
we got this.
okay.
check his phone records.
maybe he was attempting to call for help.
already working on it. - Thank you.
whoever stabbed him perfectly severed his carotid.
this spray is from his last three heartbeats.
only get that kind of force and volume with a total arterial transection.
alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.
it doesn't make sense.
Doug Mcclain was one of the best athletes of his time.
a man like this would never go down without a fight.
till today.
what's going on?
the victim's wife and that character want the body.
for what?
cryonics.
they want to freeze him?
that's what they said.
excuse me.
Mrs. Mcclain?
I'm alexx woods, M.E.
I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
but I can't let you take your husband's body.
but it was Doug's wish to be frozen until he could be cryonically revived.
he made all of the arrangements with the cryonic facility and...
and Dr. Klein...
Yes.
I understand, but that was before he died a vioeant dleth.
an autopsy could seriously compromise Doug's chances of revival.
with all due respect, doctor, fame doesn't exempt him.
I have jurisdiction over the remains of his body.
here. Does this help?
it's an injunction from judge Porterson.
an autopsy will never bring back Doug, but some day...
science will.
I have an eight- year-old daughter, and I know it sounds crazy, but...
Doug wanted to see her grow up.
this way, maybe...
one day he will see her.
and maybe even her children.
we'll just take the body.
okay, this is subject to court ajudication.
in the meantime, you better find me a seat in your van, because that body does not leave my sight.
certainly.
Mcclain was inducted into the hall of fame just last year.
famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was found murdered in his home early this morning.
he broke records in 1988 for total yards thrown.
Doug's wife, Elissa, was not available for comment.
stay tuned to channel four news, as we continue to bring you...
that's heparin, isn't it?
Yes.
you do realize an anti-coagulant is elusess on the dead, right?
dead to you, doctor.
we operate with a different definition.
heparin helps maintain tissue viability.
okay. Get him in.
you find anything, CSI Duquesne?
only smudges, detective Berkeley.
I didn't hear you leave this morning.
well, you know, a girl's got to keep some mystery.
okay.
well, what do you got on this one?
well, I can tell you there was no forced entry and this window was the only thing open.
well, it might be how the killer got in.
this doesn't belong.
what is it?
it's a piece of double-sided tape, but look at the fibers in it.
it's too short to be carpet.
I bet it was pulled off of whoever came through the window.
you find anything?
Oh, yeah.
just... probable motive.
somebody took mcclain's three championship rings.
1995 championship ball.
I'm assuming there used to be a football there.
it would have been from his last game.
took his team into the championship one last time and then retired.
the man was a class act.
you know, I knew that you liked football, but I wasn't aware that you were so into it.
well, you need your mornings, I need my sunday afternoons.
so you really think that Mcclain was killed for a few keepsakes?
keepsakes?
the stuff in this room's got to be worth a fortune.
well, then, why not take it all?
three championship rings and a signed team ball is definitely worth the most.
then I think the killer definitely knew what he was doing.
you gonna be able to pull any prints off that?
it's worth a try.
alexx, what do you got?
Doug Mcclain's wife presented a signed court order, Horatio.
signed by who?
judge porterson, Miami's leading advocate of progresvesi science.
you mean leading advocate of science fiction.
it's gonna take a hearing before I can get Doug under my knife.
by then, we could lose everything.
okay, here's what we do.
shift to plan "B.
I'm on my way to precore now.
I'll let you know.
keep me posted.
Hey, did you get a chance to look over the things I brought in from the trophy case?
Yeah. I got a print on that pair of cleats.
but it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.
well, nothing comes easy, does that?
what it's that?
you were right about the sticky tape you found by the window.
the fibers don't match anything in Mcclain's house.
it's silk.
italian silk.
killer could have brought it in on his clothing.
Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of people wear it.
well, you got anything better?
no.
but Mcclain was on the phone at the time of the murder, so Tripp is running the records to see who he was talking to.
you think he has somebody?
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
Hi.
that's a pretty top.
is it silk?
Yeah.
we're going to have to take a sample of your top to compare to some fibers we found at the Doug Mcclain crime scene.
what makes you think I was at the crime scene?
according to the phone records, you were the last person to speak to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.
the closest I got to him was the phone.
I was just updating his obituary.
I'm sorry?
newspapers like to be prepared for an unexpected death.
we have obituaries of people still alive on file so when they pass, we're ready to print.
that is morbid.
so I take it that you're a reporter?
my boss gave me a list of names and told me to update them.
and people will just talk to you?
you figure out ways to get them to open up.
Doug was a jock.
it's pretty obvious what part of the ego you have to stroke.
I was the brunette by the bar.
I'll cry if you don't remember me.
that's the list of people that I had to update.
see? Doug Mcclain?
I don't understand why Doug would be at the top the list.
he doesn't have near the medical history of these other people.
my boss says that retired football players have a high mortality rate.
something about the abuse to their bodies.
and the abuse got a whole lot worse during the phone call.
am I right?
what are you accusing me of?
it just seems to be an incredible coincidence that
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the same day you were updating his obituary.
that doesn't mean I had anything to do with it.
are you sure?
you didn't keep Doug on the phone so that someone would have opportunity to kill him?
why would I do that?
I don't know.
but I'm going to find out.
have you prepped the equipment, doctor?
Yes.
what are you using it for?
well, if I can't perform a traditional autopsy to figure out what happened to him,
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.
as long as you do it quickly.
we need to get him into a neuropod asap.
I have to warn you, it's going to be freezing in there.
Yes.
Horatio. Yes.
I'm working on our quarterback now.
right. Right. But this will take longer than the real thing.
I have to compile each scan until I get a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.
I understand, Alexx. What else?
according to early data, he does have a fracture on his hand.
looks like to the second metacarpal, with swelling around the wrist.
swelling around the wrist?
perhaps he punched someone or something, huh?
Yeah.
looks like he may have fought back after all.
maybe. Keep me posted.
Hey.
Hey. You hear anything from calleigh about the obit writer?
Calleigh couldn't place her at the scene.
all right. I guess we keep digging, huh?
what have you got?
well, I'm trying to track down Doug Mcclain's stolen memorabilia off the internet.
how many sites have you been to?
14... so far.
you know how many sites there are, right?
Yeah.
wait a minute. Go back.
there's some football stuff there.
championship rings.
that them?
looks like it.
championship years '92,'93 and '95.
Yeah. And there's the football right there.
Oh, ye of little faith.
all of these items were put up for auction by a Theo Knight.
well, Theo's about to get a very disappointing return on his investment -
let me call Horatio.
why do you guys need my prints?
we have reason to believe that Doug Mcclain was killed during a robbery of his football memorabilia.
you seem like quite a fan, Theo.
my dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.
every snap. Every pass.
what, you guys think I broke into his house to steal from his personal collection?
we don't know.
we found a fingerprint, though, on an old cleat of his.
is that going to match one of these?
it may.
I was there two weeks ago, but not last night.
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.
so he sold you three championship rings and an autographed team ball willingly?
well, his manager did.
he gave me a good price.
I had to have it.
you had to have it?
you were online within hours of his murder selling it, Theo.
I was going to add it to my collection here, but when one of these legends dies, collectors go into a frenzy.
right.
news breaks, your 100-k investment climbs up to seven figures. Is that right?
I guess I'm a lucky guy.
Yes, but not for long.
tragic day for the sports world, Mr. Wilson.
Doug Mcclain was a legend.
Yes. And I understand you were his business manager.
and now I'm managing his estate.
and selling it off rather rapidly, too.
what are you talking about?
apparently, you just sold some pieces of memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.
I had to.
Doug had, um...
cash flow problems.
he spent money like he was still in his prime.
got so bad, I had to sell his stuff just to keep him afloat.
I notice that you have a black eye.
now, we found Mr. Mcclain with a broken hand.
am I to assume that he was not happy about what you were doing?
it was a sore subject.
Dougie wore those on that naked bootleg,'93.
game winner.
what else you got?
well, over here we have his first...
what the hell's going on?
you told me a reporter was coming in here.
would you excuse us for a minute?
sure.
Thanks.
you're selling all my stuff?
this is my life.
if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a life.
was that before you killed him this morning?
I was nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
you can check.
I'm going to.
you're running the double-sided tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?
Yeah. I already did.
you had silk fibers on one side, but even better-- epithelials on the other.
and what would cause that?
you're such a guy.
remember j-lo's green versace dress?
what do you think held that up?
double-sided adhesive?
this is wardrobe tape.
did you get a profile from it?
CODIS should tell us any second.
she's got an interesting rap sheet.
one and only arrest, 2004, for breaking and entering a residence.
Yeah. She broke into Doug Mcclain's house.
that was three years ago, and that was a complete misunderstanding.
Doug and I were having an affair, and his wife caught us in their bed, and she completely overreacted.
you know that Doug Mcclain's dead?
I know. I saw it on tv.
well, we found tape from your dress that proves you entered his house again, through a window.
that's because Doug called me a few days ago and asked me if I wanted to come over.
he said his wife was away.
did you?
and when I got there, he wasn't home yet.
so why not wait, hmm?
why climb through a window?
I knew Doug since his playing days.
we had a special relationship.
and I wanted to surprise him.
I was gone before dawn.
can you prove that?
look, I know what you're trying to say, but I would never hurt Doug.
never.
I think you got tired of climbing through windows, miss Sullivan.
I think you got tired of being Doug's second choice.
being Doug Mcclain's second choice was more than any girl could ask for.
except being his first.
you know, there is a great thai restaurant next to the shore club.
you don't give up, do you?
neither do I.
now, be careful with that, girl.
you gotta make sure it's pulled right back to your...
shoulder or it's going to kick back. You okay?
okay?
all right.
Yep. I'm good. All right.
I'm going to check out.
Oh, yeah?
you know, I... I saw what happened out there.
is your, um, shoulder okay?
Yep. I'm fine.
it's good.
okay.
take care of that shoulder.
by now, the world has heard about the death of sports legend Doug Mcclain, but tonight, on tape, you will hear his actual death at the hand of his murderers.
don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter in the mystery that is gripping the nation.
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to take another look at that obituary writer.
okay, so I didn't exactly tell you everything.
that is the understatement of the year, miss Legassic.
I did call Mr. Mcclain for my article.
but you conveniently left out the part where you had the murder recorded.
I was taping the conversation so I wouldn't miss anything.
at the time, I wasn't even sure what I was hearing.
what exactly did you hear?
I can't say.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement with the tv station.
it's legally binding.
so are handcuffs.
it's your choice, Wendy.
he was literally talking to me one second and gone the next.
I kept recording until my cell battery ran out.
and so your first instinct after you found out he was killed was to sell the tape?
I'm not a monster, officer.
I just wanted to get out of the obituary business.
you thought the recording would make you a reporter at WETX.
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.
that tape is never gonna make it to tv.
a judge has issued a warrant,
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting you for obstruction of justice.
your journalism career died with Doug Mcclain.
you can write an obituary for it.
okay, I uploaded Wendy Legassic's phone conversations.
what's next?
let's start with Doug Mcclain's final words.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
Doug, are you okay?
okay, now search for spiking activity.
here's some activity.
almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.
now, that sounds like somebody moving around the house, doesn't it?
and that's somebody making a phone call.
ten digits; an area code and a phone number.
track the numbers.
I'm on it.
I use reverse directory.
lieutenant, why would the killer be calling the victim's wife?
because they must be connected.
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire somebody to kill your husband?
absolutely not.
why would you ask that?
because it turns out that you and your husband weren't living together, and your current listing is in coral gables under your maiden name.
Doug and I have been separated for a year now.
I have my own place, but we're discreet about it.
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about image control, public perception, his legacy.
it was his livelihood.
and a divorce would taint that.
fans hold an idealized view of Doug, and they pay big for that perfect, infallible ideal.
okay, so let me ask you this.
if you didn't hire somebody to kill him, who called you from the crime scene?
Doug's manager called.
why would he do that?
to tell me what happened.
he wanted me back at the house before the police or the press got there, because everybody thinks that Doug and I are still together.
was he there when you arrived?
no.
do you think he killed Doug?
do you?
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa mcclain places you at the scene at the time of the murder.
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.
I'm his manager.
and when I found his body, I called Elissa.
cause you told us you were nowhere near Doug Mcclain this morning.
now, that's a flat-out lie.
look, this is all about discretion, damage control.
I started collecting things that Doug wouldn't want the public to find out about:
whiskey bottles, diet pills, little blue pills, then I got out of there.
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.
I'd like the items, Mr. Wilson.
who's this?
I took care of everything for him but that.
never got a straight answer.
I think it's time to get one.
so, are there prints on the photograph?
Yeah, but it's not usable.
but the kid's wearing Doug's old number, and that can't be a coincidence.
no, it's not.
also, I can see part of a logo on the back of his helmet.
and it looks to me like it says "Lauderhill.
lauderhill youth program.
exactly. That's what I thought.
Yes.
more importantly, Natalia, who is this kid?
I'll call Lauderhill.
we got to find him.
lieutenant, April.
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.
thank you for coming in.
so you received our e-mail.
I guess we're hoping that you may be able to identify the child in the photograph.
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a youth football team every summer.
he was our star quarterback.
where might I find him?
lieutenant, he had a rare kidney disease.
he died last week.
what's his name?
may I?
sure.
is that your son, miss Sullivan?
Yes.
who's his father?
but in DNA only.
Caleb was only six years old when he died.
you know, I never asked Doug for anything-- money, nothing.
I raised Caleb all on my own.
he was everything to me.
and then he got sick.
his kidneys failed, didn't they?
I would have given him both of mine, but I wasn't a match, and there was a good chance that Doug was.
Dougie, he idolizes you.
he even put your number on his jersey. Please.
if he doesn't get this transplant, he will die.
I'll need to check with my attorney about this, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
please, Dougie, he's so young.
I'll give you a call next week.
Dougie, come on!
I never heard from him.
you know, everyone acts like Doug Mcclain was some big hero, but the man turned his back on his own son.
you broke into the house this morning, didn't you?
Yeah.
I heard doug on the phone with some new girl.
same as he ever was.
what if I said my most exciting experience was talking to you, honey?
now you're starting to sound like a reporter.
then you stabbed him, rita, didn't you?
Yeah.
okay.
where is the knife now?
I left it in him.
Why? It's not there?
miss Sullivan, someone removed it.
Rita Sullivan confessed?
alexx, she confessed to leaving the knife in the body.
we never recovered it.
wasn't at the scene.
well, that changes the scenario.
although, I'm sure she meant to finish Doug off.
but she didn't, did she?
no.
according to the virtopsy data, when the knife went in, it severed his carotid artery, paralyzing Doug but not killing him.
the blade plugged the hole like a cork.
so the removal of the blade is what killed him.
when the knife came out, it unleashed the arterial blood just as Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.
is there anything to suggest Rita didn't kill him?
you know, Horatio...
there may be.
see these dark spots in the wound?
that's clotted blood.
these darker portions are coagulated red blood cells.
the light ones are fibrin and platelets.
and a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.
with this amount of clotting, that blade had to have been inside Doug for a significant amount of time.
how long, Alexx?
30, 40 minutes.
30 to 40 minutes?
but the recorded phone call was only 25 minutes.
so we're looking at a two-part murder.
Rita started the process...
and somebody else finished it.
Hey.
how goes it?
you know, too much evidence and not enough hours in the day.
Atth's the truth.
man, you okay?
what's the matter?
I think my shoulder's out.
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you got to go see the doctor.
I can't.
this is going to go on my record, and it's going to get out that I can't shoot a shotgun.
it's not going back in on its own.
okay, well...
can you do it for me?
please.
all right.
just relax, okay?
okay.
you all right? You loose? - Okay.
all right, good. Look at me.
all right.
okay, all right.
put your arm over here.
okay?
Yeah.
all right.
just breathe.
okay.
don't try to be a tough guy, all right? - Okay.
it's only going to get worse.
if you need to, you go to the doctor. All right?
okay?
thank you.
thank you.
what are you sniffing around about?
Horatio's got me working to supercede a court order, reclaim your frozen football star's body.
working with us for a change.
you are aware of the pending new rules regarding fraternization among officers, aren't you?
new as in different after you and Yelina Salas?
things have changed.
the county's caving to the state's pressure on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.
that's interesting.
the department's redefining its policies on fraternization of officers.
you would be best served sharing that with the others in the lab.
listen, Stetler, if you have something to say to CSI Duquesne or detective Berkeley, you'd best be served telling them yourself.
duquesne and Berkeley?
I was talking about you and Boa Vista, but thank you.
Calleigh, hey.
it's Delko.
I... think I might have just put you in a jam.
give me a call back when you get the message, all right?
Hey, turn it around, Berkeley; we got a suspect in the grove.
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.
great, let's go.
I can't work this case.
Why?
because you're on it.
what are you talking about?
I've just been informed of pending changes in department policy.
are you saying that we can't work a crime scene together because we've been seeing each other?
more like we can't work a crime scene because we may have a falling out and things get ugly and job performance may suffer.
you sound like you're a firm believer.
no.
I just got Rick Stetler breathing down my neck.
how does Rick Stetler know anything about us?
I don't know.
listen, I think we should just take a step back -
let things cool down a little bit, okay?
okay.
Hey, Calleigh.
I heard you were riding over to Martin Wilson's house.
I'm going to ride with you.
you might have to.
Calleigh, what's up?
nothing.
what's wrong?
did I interrupt something?
how does rick stetler have even the faintest idea what's going on in my personal life?
it was an accident.
I left you a message.
I called you.
I didn't get it.
I never intended for this to happen, okay?
I don't like the situation with Jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.
you know that.
let's just work the case.
going somewhere, Mr. Wilson?
Ah, back again.
you guys are thorough, aren't you?
what's in the envelope, Martin?
Doug's personal effects I picked up from Precore.
you know, everything has its place.
what about the murder weapon, does it have a place?
Hey, I didn't take the knife.
he was dead, and I wasn't about to mess with him.
he wasn't dead.
he bled out after the knife was extracted.
he died over 30 minutes after he was stabbed, and you were right there.
look, I have been nothing but cooperative.
feel free to open it up.
whatever you want.
what are you doing with a body bag, Wilson?
that's Doug's also.
I'm not working now, and I figured it would be the last big ticket item I could sell.
wow, you're a real class act, Martin.
something's punctured right through the bag from the inside.
it's about the same width as the wound in Doug's neck.
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.
what a surprise.
this is coming with us.
and so are you.
precore is concerned with organ and tissue preservation.
preparing Doug Mcclain's blood vessels and cells for cryo storage.
we are not concerned about the plastic body bag.
the body bag, Dr. Klein, was used to smuggle the murder weapon away from my crime scene.
now, did you remove the knife from Mr. Mcclain's neck?
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.
I've been around long enough to know you're making enormous suppositions.
that may be, but I want you to open the tank.
you're going to have to take this up with judge Porterson.
to bring you up to speed, the judge has rescinded the court order.
so open the tank.
I... can't do that.
the neuropod's already been set to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.
we take him out, his preservation could be compromised.
and if we don't, so will yours.
open it.
what's that?
that, Mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon which we found next to your husband's body.
and that is your fingerprint.
they told me it would be 40 years before they opened that.
I can assure you the investigation can't wait that long, Mrs. Mcclain.
I didn't want to go there.
I didn't want to see Doug like that.
but Martin, his manager, insisted.
wanted me to play the part of the grieving widow.
so you kept up appearances.
I went back to the house.
I found him there.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
I called Precore.
which is when you realized he was still alive.
I heard him groan.
it was... it was so soft,
I thought I'd imagined it.
I didn't know what to do.
martin wanted to protect the estate.
his reputation.
but... I just couldn't pretend anymore.
the way doug was living his life, he was...
he was depreciating every day.
and he was dragging me and our daughter down with him.
he was just going to keep screwing up until everything just came crashing down around us.
so he was worth more to you dead than alive.
is that what you're telling me?
so I pulled out the knife.
and like that, it was over.
he bled to death.
doctor, please...
take this from me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mcclain, I can't take that knife.
my husband is the biggest name is sports.
this is publicity you can't buy.
now, if you want his body in your facility you will do this.
I'm calling 911.
precore takes their van for one lap around the block.
arrives shortly after you do.
and I play my role one last time.
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the next several years are going to be very real.
let's go to work.
so what do you think?
no signs of a struggle.
the area around the body was undisturbed.
Ryan and Calleigh are canvassing the area, but I'm pretty sure this is a secondary crime scene.
tire treads?
nothing, nothing.
no evidence of how the body got here. She was just dumped.
okay, so all we have is the body.
okay, Dr. Price.
no I. D.on her yet.
got a call into Missing Persons.
they're checking reports for any descriptions that might match the victim.
lieutenant, we've got multiple burns on her body.
one here on her hand, on her arm and several on her upper torso.
this jacket burn goes from the back all the way to the front of her palm.
something was clamped onto her.
I'm guessing jumper cables.
this guy's sadistic.
she wasn't just murdered, she was tortured.
the electricity took the path of least resistance, exiting out her back.
I'm guessing she was in a prone position at the time of death.
with burns like these, I'd say it packed a pretty good charge.
how much?
it's hard to say exactly. It takes one amp to kill a person.
to inflict these types of burns, ten maybe.
I don't need to open her up to know that she's probably fried inside, but I will to get you guys some answers.
thank you, Doctor.
ready? One, two, three.
okay.
okay.
all right, let's shoot.
small scale.
large scale.
okay, now let's do length, width.
start here.
width.
okay.
what have we got?
young adult female, no signs of ligature marks or bruising.
she didn put up a fight?
nor was she physically restrained.
it's like she let it happen.
what's the cause of death?
heart failure due to electric shock.
her heart went into severe ventricular fibrillation and then stopped.
the burns don't look as extreme as I thought they would.
well, after the initial shock, tissue damage doesn't progress with further electrocution.
some of it will fry and some of it will remain completely healthy.
electricity's funny like that.
take a look at this.
her pupils are fully dilated.
which means they were that way at the time of death.
so she was killed in complete darkness?
something's not right here. - What are you thinking?
well...
well, it's more of a hunch than a thought.
I'll take it to Trace, see if it hits on anything.
how's that desk treating you, Reggie?
it's a far cry from Homicide, but hey, what's not to like?
hang in there, Detective.
thank you, Horatio.
let me set these up for a positive ID.
is that the victim's boyfriend? - Yeah, Wolfe's with him. Name's Tim Erickson.
he called in the Missing Person on one Kathy Meyers.
description is a match.
all right, thank you.
I checked up on him. He got a record.
you might want to follow up on that.
old habits die hard, huh?
the may have me riding this desk, but I'm gonna work it, baby.
just remember why you're here.
we were supposed to go out last night.
what time was that?
8: 00 I tried calling her.
went by her dorm, and her car was gone.
when I went by again this morning, she still hadn't come back.
were you two very serious?
it was our three-month anniversary.
I was gonna ask her to move in with me.
that's why we were going out.
so she was gone less than 12 hours, and yet you filed a missing person's report.
it was supposed to be a surprise, but she knew it was coming.
that's why I thought something was up.
Tim, was Kathy aware of your sexual battery conviction?
what's that got to do with this?
well, you know, more often than not, the first person to report someone missing or murdered is usually guilty of the crime.
I came down here to ID my girlfriend, and you've got the nerve to accuse me of her murder?
if you're finished, I'd like to go now.
don't go far.
did you get the tox back from Kathy Meyers?
Yeah, nothing in her bloodstream.
no chloroform, no GHB, nothing.
what about you? What'd you get?
a swab from Kathy Meyers' eye has high doses of cyclopentolate.
blocks the eyes' muscular receptors, dilates the pupils.
effectively blinding her; restraint without restraint.
Tara's hunch was right. He didn't kill her in the dark.
instead, he fully dilated her pupils so that she was sensitive to the light.
it's weird. - Wait, wait, wait.
do you remember that case from about a year or so ago, the murder vic's name was Allison...
something?
no, doesn't ring a bell.
well, anyway, her pupils were dilated in the same manner.
I did the trace. - What happened?
you know, I can't remember.
but the lab's IDB shoulde able to tell us.
let me just put in the right search words, and I'm sure we'll be able to track down her case.
Allison Novell, 21, stabbed and dumped back in October of last year.
Yeah, but stabbed. Kathy Meyers was electrocuted.
may be related, maybe not, but it's still worth looking into.
okay, well, their lead suspect was Dr. Max Paulson, her ophthalmologist.
never found enough to connect him.
but the physical evidenceis still in the department.
great. I think it's time to get a second opinion from Dr. Paulson.
you're kidding me.
look, I was wrongly accused last time.
you can't just come into my office and start accusing me again.
we can if you've killed another girl.
her eyes were dilated with a tool of your trade.
Oh, just like Allison Novell.
where were you this morning?
in my bed sleeping, like everyone else.
and before you ask, no, no one can corroborate that.
how unfortunate.
that's quite a shiner you got there. Cut lip, too.
that happen when you tried to subdue the girl in our morgue?
cause we will find evidence of that.
you guys got to learn to communicate. Talk to Reggie Mastow.
detective Mastow contacted you? - Yeah.
and as you so astutely pointed out, he left the marks to prove it.
why is he so hell-bent on pinning me for murder?
first Allison Novell, now some girl I don't even know.
because maybe you killed these girls.
I didn't kill anyone, and you won't fault me if I talk to my attorney?
I insist on it.
he said I assaulted him?
I saw the facial damage myself, Reggie.
and you two have a history.
I just put him on notice, let him know we're all still watching him.
I don't need the help.
I see a lot of casework, strapped to this desk.
now, as soon as I saw those dilated pupils, I knew that could only mean one thing, that Max Paulson killed again.
Reggie, you're on restrictive duty.
because of him and the Allison Novell case.
look, a civilian charge me with harassment, it run up the IAB chain,
I ain't working Homicide no more?
you're not taking this seriously, Reggie.
I found the man's print on the Novell girl!
the print was inconclusive.
a tented arch, just like Paulson.
you know how rare that is?
of course you do; you run the damn crime lab.
as long as I've been working this, I ain't never been more sure of anything.
what do you got?
did a search of past cases involving pupil dilation and forced bliness.
so we have another victim.
Yeah, we do. She's alive.
she reported being attacked and blinded about eight months ago. Name's Jessica Davis.
thank you, Eric.
that name rings a bell.
just give me a little more time on this.
I can connect Paulson to her.
I need your badge and gun.
you're gonna put me on leave? For what?
you are endangering two cases now.
your badge and gun.
lieutenant, please don't do this to me.
they already took the work away from me.
I'm just a shadow around here. - Reggie, listen to me.
let me clear this up, and I will personally reinstate you.
lieutenant, Jessica wants to talk to you, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea, given her condition.
her condition?
she was just diagnosed with metastic breast cancer.
I'm sorry to hear that.
we just got engaged a month ago.
well, she is weak. But she's stubborn as ever.
if you could just take it slow with her.
I'll do that.
Hi, Jessica.
I just hope you listen this time.
I don't...
your department dismissed me.
I'm not...
I reported this eight months ago.
the detective I spoke to passed me off to somebody else.
I never heard from either of them again.
okay. Why don't you tell me what happened?
I had a day off; I spent it reading a magazine in the park.
I lost track of time, and headed off to school.
I must have been knocked unconscious. - Why do you say that?
suddenly, there was this blinding light.
I can't see!
tell me how bad it hurts. Beg for your life.
he wanted me to beg for my life, but I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
the next thing I know, I'm out on the street.
I've told you all of this before!
no one took me seriously.
okay, Jessica, that's about to change.
Horatio, I pulled all the evidence on Allison Novell out of the empty PD storage, but this is unfortunately all but destroyed by water damage.
is anything usable?
not that I've seen. - Okay.
salvage what you can and reprocess itplease. Excuse me.
you got it.
Horatio Caine.
lieutenant, please, I need your help.
miss Davis, what's the matter?
my fianc\ isn't here.
there's a man parked outside watching me.
I don't know what to do.
okay, I'll be right there.
you stay away from her! You understand? I'll kill you!
Oh, you're wearing a gun. You son of a bitch!
Reggie, let him go! Let him go!
wait, I know you. You're that cop.
the one that blew me off!
you're not really giving me a whole lot to go on.
it just happened so fast.
do you know how many assault reports I get?
what? That's him?
you blew my girlfriend off? You son of a...
Mr. Chilton, calm down.
Eric, take them inside, please.
let's go.
I don't know what you're doing here, man.
a-all I could think about, Horatio, - was I was supposed to come and finish the job. - Reggie, didn't we just talk about this?
look, I'm just trying to protect Jessica. - Didn't we just talk about it, Reggie?
look, we let her slip through our finger before.
we can't... - Reggie!
if I see you out here again, if I see you out here again, you're finished.
do you understand? I'll have your job.
she's not safe. She's not safe.
hello. Just finished my post of Kathy Meyers.
was there something else you needed?
Yeah, I need to take some photos.
well, if you need pictures, why don't you just check the case file?
no, not like t ones that I need.
these are infrared photos, and they penetrate through multiple subdural layers.
any bruising should show up in AV.
we know that Allison from a year ago and our victim today were both blinded by eyedrops.
right, and Jessica Davis corroborates that.
but the killer would had to have subdued them before he could administer the eyedrops.
eyedrops don't stop you from screaming or fighng back.
all right. So the question is: how did he do it?
we know it wasn't chemically, so it has to be physically.
Yeah, but I didn't find any bruising to indicate physical restraint.
none that you could see. That's what this is for.
all right, she's all yours.
Thanks.
there's some clear bruising, but it doesn't look like he strangled her.
Yeah, there's only four markings. They're all from fingers.
it's a blood choke.
pinch the carotid and the jugular, cut off blood to the brain.
hypoxia kicks in, and in a few seconds, it's lights out.
so we're looking for someone with specialized hand-to-hand trainin Maybe military.
or a vengeful cop.
are you saying that you think Reggie killed Allison Novell and Kathy Meyers?
I'm saying that he's been all over this case since it started.
Yeah, because he wants the guy to be caught.
or because he wants to make sure that we have a suspect at all times.
okay, look, I'm willing to admit that Reggie can be a bit aggressive, but he's a good cop.
in Allison Novell's case, they used infrared photography, too.
there were no markings. Killer's getting angrier.
and all I'm saying is I've seen Mastow. He can come unhinged.
in my opinion, all you've got are a few bruises.
and I think you need to have a lot more than that before you take this theory out in front of the rest of the department.
I don't agree.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Reg.
miss Duquesne.
what are you doing here?
I wanted to gnaw me a bit.
the department's in full "cover-your-ass" mode.
well, I guess in all fairness, he did put him in a bit of a tight spot.
everybody's overreacting.
and you guys have proved me right.
speaking of which, any new leads on Max Paulson?
you know I can't discuss the case.
that's how you're going to play it, huh?
it's protocol.
you CSIs love your protocol.
prance around here in your perfect white lab coat, acting like you know every damn thing.
but sometimes police work ain't clean.
I think I'll stick with what works for me.
turn the elevator back on.
what works for you?
while you're taking your sweet time looking for more evidence,
paulson is out there walking free and easy.
now, who's to say he's going to stop these killings?
is that what you want?
more innocent girls to die?
step away from me, Reggie.
you getting off?
no. I forgot something in the lab.
ask yourself something, Detective.
how would you feel if you had to stare a murderer in the eye and let him walk away?
you trying to get to sleep after knowing something like that.
I sleep just fine. How about you?
Yeah, we're at a total loss with the evidence in Allison Novell's case.
and overall the evidence in Kathy Meyers' case.
twice, none of it linked to Max Paulson or...
or any other suspects in this case.
you know, if the evidence doesn't lead us to the killer...
then maybe she can.
so we know where she was dumped, but we don't know where she was abducted from.
well, she was a, uh, student at Dade University.
right.
but what do we really know about her?
we know she was in love.
Yeah, Erickson said that it was her three-month anniversary, and they were going out to celebrate.
and what does a girl do before her big date?
make me wait in the living room with her cat.
okay, but before that, what does a girl do?
cause see this right here-- these little marks along her eyebrow?
that's from threading. - Threading? That sounds painful.
what happens is a stylist weaves a thread through your eyebrow, and then pulls the whole thing at once.
so you get this done in a salon?
monthly.
and from looks of her credit card bills, she had a favorite place that she goes to.
so I ran the plates, and the car's registered to Kathy Meyers.
salon confirmed that she was here yesterday.
Yeah, looks like it's her purse.
okay, so she was abducted right here.
take a look at this. See any scuff marks? - Yeah.
we travel along here...
resulting... in this.
must be where he parked. I don't see any tire treads.
neither do I.
what do you think this is?
it looks like industrial grease.
ybe off his shoe?
could lead us to the killer.
Yeah. Okay, I'll be there.
we have another body.
pupil dilation is consistent, repeated electrical burns.
no pattern.
looks like jumper cables again.
it's a match to Kathy Meyers, isn't it?
you really don't expect to have to see this kind of thing twice in one day.
the bruises from the blood choker clearly visible this time, Lieutenant.
I know I'm new, but I have to say I think this guy is escalating.
and getting sloppy. What is underneath that fingernail, Doctor?
looks like she took some hair with her.
which means she put up a fight.
good news is, she got a follicular tag.
that is good news.
latest victim's name is Rachel Calvado.
just 21, but already booked for possession, solicitation, assault.
bless her heart. That is a hard life.
harder death.
still waiting on the DNA results on the hair from under her nails.
everything all right?
Yeah. I'm just a little edgy.
so are you going to run sample against the department staff?
no. Why? Have someone in mind?
Reggie Mastow. It could be him. I just want to know for sure.
but he's no longer working the case.
the only way his hair could get on the victim...
doesn't matter. It's from another familiar face.
Max Paulson. Thanks.
I don't know a girl named Rachel Calvado, either. I'm sorry.
we found hair under her fingernail, Max.
and the problem is, Max, that the DNA profile is yours.
that's not possible.
cause you can't make mistakes?
detective Mastow's methods may be wrong, but I think he may be right about you.
circumstantial. Everything you have is circumstantial.
everything but the truth, Max.
how does this keep happening?
why don't you tell us?
I have-- nobody seems to be listening to me.
I've been in a theater all afternoon.
two movies, back to back.
can anyone vouch for that?
no. I went alone.
maybe an employee at the theater would remember me.
busy doc like you goes to see two movies... alone?
that's a hell of an alibi.
it certainly is.
followed up on Max Paulson's alibi.
theater usher corroborated his story.
Yeah, well, he could have snuck out the back and maybe returned unnoticed.
Hey, guys, what, um...
what if Max is a scapegoat?
why, what do you mean? What are you thinking?
come on, Calleigh, you're reaching now.
I don't know, I mean, Reggie was at Max's this morning within hours of Kathy Meyers' body being discovered.
he saw the autopsy photos, recognized the dilated pupils-- no big deal.
Reggie could have known we we're close.
he pins it on Max Paulson, we close the case, and then he...
proves everyone that he was right.
look, guys, I rode patrol with Reggie for five years.
he's not a killer.
the guy eats, breathes and sleeps finding the bad guys.
Yeah, but if he's so passionate about it, why give Jessica Davis the brush-off when she told him about her attack?
she didn't give him much to go on.
or maybe he didn't want to spend that much time with her, because he was afraid she'd recognize him.
look, if Reggie's guilty of anything, you guys, it's tunnel vision. That's it.
take a look at this.
I got a piece of leather with a button clasp.
it's the perfect size for an ankle holster.
Horatio said Reggie was wearing one this morning when he was confronted by Dennis Chilton.
I'll call Horatio.
put it down, Reggie. Put it down.
this? Just doing a little house cleaning.
I heard you slammed the door on Max Paulson.
calls for celebration.
or not, judging by the way you tickling your sidearm.
we need your backup weapon.
what's going on? I know that lo.
come on, fellas, it's me.
I need the weapon, Reggie.
the clasp is missing, Reggie.
that's 20 years old.
showing a little mileage.
that clasp could be anywhere.
where did you get that from?
I found this 15 feet from Rachel Calvado's body, Reggie.
did you kill Kathy Meyers and Allison Novell too, Reggie?
I'm telling y'all, y'all need to be talking to Max Paulson.
he's right under our nose.
you know how many hours I put in trying to solve the Allison Novell case?
it's about finding the right guy, Reggie.
then Kathy Meyers' body showed up.
I let that man slip through my fingers before.
I ain't about to let that happen again. - It's not up to you, Reggie.
Rachel Calvado was a heroin addict. She ain't got no family.
she's got a record a mile long.
now I did r a favor.
I made her life worth something but using her to save the lives of other people who did have a future.
Hey, baby. You busy? - Get lost.
you want to see a little of this? How about that? Come here. Come here.
that hurts! Please, no! I can't see!
bottom line-- you killed a woman to close a case.
I did what was necessary.
you are way over the line this time!
try filing a report. See if anybody cares.
I put the killer in your lap.
that you did, Reggie.
you're certain Reggie didn't kill Allison Novell and Kathy Meyers?
he killed Rachel Calvado to throw focus back onto Paulson.
so what do we do? - We start over.
we've been through it all. It's been destroyed.
not all of it, Eric. Check this out.
I took the liberty of pulling Jessica Davis' case file.
since it was never considered part of the case, it was stored separately.
right. Now, she's the only victim that got away.
maybe she took a piece of the killer with her, Eric.
the only thing logged in is what she was wearing.
it's already been processed. It's another dead end.
look again, Eric.
it says that there are two latent overlapping prints that were found on the butto of her blouse.
which we couldn't separate a year ago, right?
no, the technology didn't exist.
separate them now, and find me.
I thought you were working prints on the Jessica Davis case.
I'm isolating each print according to its chemical composition.
because the chemicals in prints are unique.
way to think outside the tent card.
Yeah, I'm using desorption electric spray ionization to identify the chemicals on the button.
and then... we can isolate each of the chemicals and hopefully tease out an image of a print.
Methylparaben.
that's the primary component in hand lotion.
I bet that was transferred there by Jessica.
12 hydroxystyrene-- that's lithium grease.
hang on.
it's the same substance found where Kathy Meyers was abducted.
it ties the two victims together.
so whoever killed Kathy is the same person that attacked Jessica.
got a tented arch.
looks like the same tented arch that we found on Allison Novell.
Dr. Paulson had a tented arch.
do you think that Reggie could have been right all along?
paulson's an ophthalmologist.
what would he be doing with industrial grease?
it can be used on cars.
around the house, I guess.
Jessica Davis' fianc\.
wait... wait, stop! Stop! There's been some sort of a mistake!
some sort of lab mix-up. Dennis, tell them.
ms. Davis, your fianc\ murdered somebody this morning, ma'am.
we found lithium grease on a pair of his boots.
and that confirmst. - No, you're wrong!
he killed Allison Novell and he killed Kathy Meyers.
di't want you to find out like this.
you're the one who attacked me?
I was angry.
I wanted someone to feel as bad as I did.
so I killed the first one.
I couldn't kill you.
my eyes... I can't see!
who are you?
do you know how bad this is going to hurt?
tell me how bad it hurts.
beg for your life.
never.
you can't do this to me!
do you understand?
I couldn't kill you then.
after that, I did everything I could to make you fall in love with me.
for the first time in my life I felt alive.
somebody help me! Help!
I finally found someone as in control as me.
and then you lost control again when you found out Jessica had cancer.
that's when you discovered Kathy Meyers, rit?
I had to get rid of my anger.
and that's exactly what you did.
at the expense of everything.
take him, please.
so Max Paulson was innocent.
I knew it was him.
at least I thought I did.
I betrayed the oath, Horatio.
killed a woman. You don't come back from that.
here I am thinking I'm doing the right thing, taking a murderer off the street, and I become the thing I despise the most.
I'm gonna be fine, Lieutenant.
we all have to pay for our mistakes.
will you do my back?
whoa, Kelly, you're, like, totally burning.
whatever. Color's color.
Yeah, well, you won't be saying that when you're all crying to me later.
Carla, lean back.
you're totally blocking my sun.
what? What is it?
Oh, my God.
the victim's Ronnie Temple.
he lived in Hialeah Gardens.
Hialeah Gardens.
so he was local.
Alexx is on her way, but we don't need her to see that he was garroted.
any witnesses?
couple dozen people hanging around the pool, but nobody saw a thing.
that's because they were watching...
the eclipse.
all eyes on the sky.
I think the killer counted on the distraction.
but he didn't count on us.
Hey, Calleigh!
okay...
that's not your usual passive-aggressive.
now that was aggressive-aggressive.
not now, Berkeley.
I know that tone.
I mean, us taking a break was a mutual thing, right?
it was.
it is.
Hey, Alexx!
look...
I just want to be put on record:
this, right here, this is some bad mojo.
how do you figure?
my grandmother was into astrology, and the saying goes:
if someone dies during an eclipse, they can't rest until they take another soul with them.
that's ridiculous.
hey...
I'm going to do my job...
but mojo is mojo, honey.
just ignore him, Alexx.
he takes everything at face value.
well, call me if you get anything.
if you still remember the number.
I heard you two had to break up because of department rules.
that's the story.
speaking of stories, I heard on the radio this morning that there had not been a total eclipse in Miami since the year 1637.
the path of totality.
it's the one time when God Himself looks the other way.
I don't know this side of you, Alexx, but I like it.
Hey, check out this little metal case.
it seems out of place at a pool, don't you think?
and it's empty.
looks like someone had a go at it.
they probably left me some nice epithelials.
I wonder if the contents were worth killing over?
I just ran the swabs Calleigh got from the metal case at the scene, and they were a match to a known felon: Mario Montero.
he's in the system for two aggravated assaults.
that's great. I'm going to have him picked up.
perfect.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
what is this?
this...
well...this can't be right.
look at this-- check out his DNA.
16 markers, two peaks per.
I don't know-- it looks normal to me.
ten alles apiece.
but then look at the last six.
they're way outside the variant.
and that last peak is so low that it barely even registers.
I don't know; you got me.
what?
well, they...
don't register as human.
what do you mean?
his DNA is mutating.
these peaks mic a specific canine profile.
canine, like a dog.
like a wolf.
a wolf!
okay, well, I guess I'm going to need a leash to bring him in.
Thanks.
evidence puts you at the scene of a homicide.
Ronnie Temple from the Woolrich Hotel pool.
Yeah, I was there.
so?
saw him all bloody and whatnot.
I just snaked all of his stuff.
what were you looking for?
wolf hormones.
come on.
wolf hormones?
80 years ago, no one ever thought they could turn a dude into a chick.
and, uh, Ronnie Temple used to sell you all this stuff?
temple was the go-to guy.
anything you could eat, snort, smoke, shoot.
dealt out of that cabana.
I gotta ask-- why a wolf?
that's my destiny.
that's why.
werewolves, man, they're outlaws...warriors.
in other words...killers
if I'd killed him, it'd went down way different, tell you that.
wouldn't even have been enough left of him to identify.
that's not exactly the best way to convince me to let you out of here.
if you could pinch me for murder, you'd have done it already.
I guess I'll have to settle for theft for now.
and I want everything back that you took from that cabana.
everything.
is that the stuff that Mario stole?
you mean the wolf man?
Yeah, this is it-- everything that he scavenged from Ronnie Temple's briefcase.
I guess Montero wasn't lying.
embryonic hormones: Canis Lupus.
he injects wolf hormones?
Why?
the guy want to turn himself into a wolf.
well, Mario made bail.
and he's gotten a big firm to represent him.
lawyers, vampires and werewolves-- they all run in the same circles.
you're still angry with me about the thing with Jake, right?
no, I'm not.
you know what, it...
it probably would've gotten out eventually, even if you hadn't have told Stetler, and you probably just sped up the inevitable.
if it would've been me, I would've transferred to the night shift.
that's sweet.
check this out-- it may be the victim's blood.
and look at the frayed edge-- it's not from the name card.
that's an employee ID from the Woolrich Hotel.
frayed thread's probably from the lanyard he ripped it off of.
lanyard, cord, string -
whatever it was, it would've been something good to strangle someone with.
does it say who the card belongs to?
no. It's got an employee ID number.
Shawn, you're a pool boy at the Woolrich Hotel, and we recovered your employee badge at our victim's body.
someone broke into my locker, took my badge.
why don't you show him your hands here, sport?
it's not what you think.
it happened on the job this morning.
I think you've hit your quota of cockamamy excuses today.
I cut myself when I was putting out the lounge chairs.
we'll verify that if we have to turn over every chair.
be my guest.
what reason could I possibly have to kill the guy?
well, the victim was dealing drugs out of one of your cabanas.
maybe he didn't cut you in.
I didn't care what the guy did, to be honest.
I just didn't want to be on his bad side.
you don't want to be on mine, either, I can assure you.
you have to believe me.
I'm innocent.
Mr. Hodges, I don't have to believe anything.
case number 0792134.
victim's name is Ronnie Temple.
male Caucasian, 30 years old.
apparent homicide by a ligature.
body was found in the cabana of the Woolrich Hotel.
a deep furrow stretches across the anterior neck, crossing just below the laryngeal prominence.
seems to be something stuck in the wound.
looks like hair.
noted.
could belong to his assailant.
now going to begin the Y incision.
alexx, guess who just got reinstated!
alexx, can you hear me?
alexx, hold on. Hold on.
this is Ryan Wolfe.
I need paramedics in the autopsy room, now.
Alexx's doctor called.
and she's regained consciousness.
ct scan came up normal.
doesn't seem to be any internal cause.
so it was environmental.
you'd think, but HAZMAT cleared the room.
there's nothing showing up on the MiniRAE.
I don't know, maybe Alexx is right.
about what?
the eclipse and somebody dying during an eclipse.
they don't rest until they take someone else's soul?
I think we found our other soul.
ligature marks are similar.
so, Eric...
we've got another victim.
Yeah, her name's Diana Long.
23 years old, she was killed in her apartment.
called it in late last night after midnight.
night shift processed her?
Yeah, and the scene-- no way to tell there was a pattern until now.
two murders, 12 hours, right?
both strangled within five miles of each other.
anything else to connect the victims?
Jake's doing background checks as we speak.
I think we're dealing with a serial killer, H.
so do I.
Hello?
we get the full report from night shift?
she lived alone, didn't work, and nobody even came to claim the body.
all right, well...
there's something I need to say to you, so just let me say it.
the thing with you and Calleigh, Stetler-- I never meant for that...
save it.
she's obviously not too bothered by it.
means, I'm not too bothered by it.
good.
you know, I'm beginning to understand why Diana Long didn't have any friends.
got take-out menus, catalogs, a mini-fridge.
take a look at this.
see how deep that wear pattern is?
spent a ton of time in this chair.
so she was living her life on the computer.
she's got a screensaver of the beach when the real thing's right outside her window.
Yeah, I'm going to take it to AV.
there could be something on it.
she's got no roommates, no friends...
who discovered the body?
it was a delivery guy.
he hung around for questioning, had all the right answers.
maybe he wasn't being asked the right questions.
so, Clint...
it was you who discovered Diana Long's body.
I told the other officers that already.
I don't know what more you want from me.
how about the truth?
okay.
my name is Clint Gilmore.
I work for TakeIn Delivery.
whatever you need, we bring to you.
we're number one in Miami for a reason.
so Diana was a customer.
Yes, she was one of my best clients.
every single night she need something.
bread, toothpaste, diet soda...
even once-- I swear-- a snare drum.
so you knew her pretty well.
no, I didn't know her at all.
I had never even spoke with the woman.
she'd just leave her door unlocked, d leave money on a side table so she wouldn't have to get up.
it was like she was living under quarantine.
what was the last order she placed?
uh... food for two.
but when I got there, I opened the door, the money wasn't on the table.
and you know what's weird, Lieutenant?
what is that?
that was the only time I ever saw her face.
did you ever see her guest?
sorry, but no.
I hope you catch this guy.
I will, Clint.
I will.
that's a nice upgrade.
the, uh, hardware, I meant.
not that you're not very, um...
let's just start this over again.
my name's Ryan Wolfe, and I was just reinstated.
I know who you are.
so this is Diana Long's desktop computer?
more like her lifeline.
there's an icon for absolutely everything.
well, it's modern living, I guess.
if you call being a mouse potato living, sure, I guess so.
says the girl who gets her paycheck from standing in front of a computer screen all day.
wow, first day back and you're already feisty.
so can you tell me if Diana had any, uh, communications with anyone last night?
sure, let me look at her instant messages.
they're all archived.
here we go -
she went by the name WORLDTRVLER and chatted with someone going by LIONCASH88.
what's their last exchange?
LIONCASH88 said,"We should meet,"
and she said,"Kind of busy, I don't know."
her last words were sent at 11: 30 p. m.
and she died shortly after that.
can you get an identity for Mr. LIONCASH88?
sure, I can run a reverse trace on the IP address.
looks like your gentleman caller's real name is Nicholas Pike.
think she rejected him?
well, if she did, why did she order food for two?
you got quite a place here, Mr. Pike.
thank you.
the nightclub business has been good to me.
you know what they say, bring in the ladies, the men always follow.
actually, I'm interested in just one lady.
her name is Diana Long.
does that sound familiar?
not off hand, no.
maybe her screen name does: WORLDTRVLER.
Oh, yeah. Sure. We met in a chat room.
um, very nice to talk to.
