I just lied to him, didn't I?
Yes.
where were you going?
what?
before I got in the cab, where were you going?

I was waiting for a bus.
I came to bring you your stuff.

well, uh, gee, thanks.
so where were you goin'?
don't worry about it.
fine.
Langdon street.
you got family there?
uh, no.
it's the... couple who's adopting my baby.
they were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport,
but I guess they got the days mixed up or somethin'.
it's not like they abandoned me.
Brentwood's not far. Get in.
Seriously?
do you want a ride or not?
so why do you people want us to stay at the temple?
we're protecting you.
from what?
you've been on this island for a while, right?
ever see a big pillar of black smoke
makes a "Ticka ticka" Sound, looks pissed off?
Yes.
from that.
do you know anything about another plane coming in?
an ajira flight.
I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?
I think he means the one that landed
Justin. Shut up.
no, no, no, that's a decoy trail.
he went this way.
and you're basing this on what?
experience.
Aldo. - What?
I think she's right.
of course she is.
after you, princess.
so what's your strategy for bringing you boyfriend back?
I hope you got one, because he shot a guy on his way out.
if he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.
watch it.
thank you.
looks like one of rousseau's traps.
the frenchwoman?
no, she's been dead for years.
this--this couldn't be one of her
Justin! Shut up.
what was he gonna say?
you don't even remember me, do you?
you don't recognize me?
well, maybe this will jog your memory.
three years ago, You staged yourself a little prison break, and you did it By knocking the guard out with the butt of you rifle.
that would be me.
what are you doing?
escaping.
you okay, man?
he's back!
sayid, what happened?
they tortured me.
Why?
don't know.
they didn't ask me any questions.
step aside.
Hey, shephard.
we were hoping you'd come on your own.
what the hell did you do to sayid?
we--we didn't do anything to him.
y-your friend is sick.
sick with what?
he's... Yeah, I... not really-- There's not really a literal translation.
the closest thing would be... Infected.
infected?
he's not even runnin' a fever.
what... Did I say something funny?
I doubt it.
he doesn't really have a sense of humor.
he says you have to give your friend this pill.
are you serious?
why don't you give it to him?
because it won't work unless he takes it willingly,
and he won't take it willingly from us.
well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it Before you tortured him.
we didn't torture him.
we were diagnosing him.
to see if he was infected.
Yes.
I'm not gonna give anything to sayid Unless I know what's in it.
tell me, shephard-- Your friend... How did he get shot?
he was, um... He was helping me.
so it was your fault?
Yes.
and there have been others Who were hurt or died... Helping you?
Yes.
well... Then this is your chance to redeem yourself.
it's medicine, And your friend needs it.
what happens if I don't give it to him?
the infection will spread.
so... nothing? There wasn't anything?
no white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?
I remember being shot.
you're not a zombie, right?
no.
I am not a zombie.
Hey.
you mind giving me and sayid a minute?
Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they usually lead To me having to do something I don't quite understand.
I'm right there with ya.
it's fine.
we'll be in the food court if you need us.
so did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?
they said they were trying to diagnose you.
right.
they told me it was some sort of test, Which they said I passed.
clearly, I didn't.
what's that?
they want you to take it.
it's medicine, according to them.
what about according to you?
I don't know.
and you know, before when you-- When you thanked me for saving your life, I...
I didn't have anything to do with it, sayid.
I didn't fix you. They did.
I don't care who fixed me.
I only care about who I trust, So if you want me to take that pill, jack, I'll do it.
wait.
where are you going?
catching up with sawyer.
so you never planned to bring him back to the temple.
no.
I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?
where did your plane land, kate?
what?
the ajira plane that you, jack and hurley came in on-- Where did it land?
I don't know.
sun was on that plane, too, and I have to find her.
you think they're gonna tell you?
you think they care about you or about sun or about any of us?
who do you care about, kate?
good luck, jin.
once you catch up with sawyer... then what?
I guess we'll figure that out together.
so, uh... What happened to your handcuffs?
I cut them off.
it's a beautiful neighborhood.
I bet they're a really nice couple.
what?
I didn't say anything.
what, you--you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?
why would I think that?
good,'cause they didn't.
this is it.
um... Will you come in with me?
are you kidding me?
please, I-I just... I really don't want to go up there on my own.
uh, hi.
uh, mrs. Baskum?
I-I'm--I'm claire littleton.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
um... My husband...
he left me.
and... believe me, I wanted the baby so much,
but... I can't do it alone.
I'm sorry.
look, I know I should've called you
so, uh, wh-- Y-y-you just changed your mind?
look, my--my life is just... A little bit complicated right now.
she came all the way from australia, and you don't call?
Oh, my god.
are you okay?
it's coming!
who's there?
better come out now Or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.
what the hell are you doin' here?
I was worried about you.
what's happening?
I-I think I'm having contractions.
when did they start?
um, about 20 minutes ago.
try to relax.
we're gonna take you to the m. F.C. U.To get looked at.
are you with her?
Yeah.
okay, follow me.
what are you doing? What--what's going on?
hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
What--what's going on?
is something wrong?
excuse me.
excuse me.
Yes.
are you a doctor? - Yes. I'm dr. Goodspeed.
can I please get your help in here?
ms. Littleton?
Claire, how are you feeling?
uncomfortable, what--w-what's happening?
what's happening... Is that mother nature's gotten a little ahead of herself.
are you ready to have your baby?
I-I'm sorry. What!
you're at 36 weeks.
3 centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced.
which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.
if I want?
so what, you mean-- you mean you can stop it then?
maybe.
however, to do that would require a number of drugs.
drugs? I mean, w-will that hurt the baby?
no, they're perfectly safe.
I just don't want to have to Stick you with needles if I don't have to.
so it's up to you.
I'm--I'm not ready.
okay.
let's get her started on the nifedipine drip.
Wh--what--what is it?
Margaret, let's do an ultrasound.
I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there.
Ah, it--it could just mean the baby's out of position.
w-w-what are you-- what are you saying?!
W-what--what's happening to my baby?!
is my baby okay?!
is aaron okay?!
see?
there he is.
everything is just fine.
your boy just likes to move around.
140 b. P.M. Perfectly normal.
I have a feeling That aaron is gonna be a handful.
now let's see if we can slow this down.
you did great, mommy.
Thanks.
a couple days ago, You asked me why I came back to the island.
I need to find claire.
I thought... Maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me, And then...
maybe if we could find her and bring her back to aaron,
then maybe all of this wouldn't have been for nothing.
I'm sorry.
I never should've followed you.
which time?
that was your house, right?
with juliet.
Yep.
I'm sorry.
you already said that.
no... For juliet.
if I hadn't come after you on the sub,
then you two would've left, and she would've never died.
it's not your fault she's dead.
it's mine.
she was sittin' right there, Right where you are now, Tryin' to leave this place.
and I convinced her to stay.
I made her stay on this island 'cause I didn't want to be alone.
you understand that, right?
but, uh... But I think some of us Are meant to be alone.
I was gonna ask her to marry me.
you can probably make it back to the temple by nightfall.
what's that?
it's a baseball.
you speak pretty good english For someone that needs a translator.
we both know that I don't need a translator.
then why do you have one?
because I have to remain separate From the people I'm in charge of.
it makes it easier When they don't like the decisions I make for them.
who are you?
my name is dogen.
are you from here-- the island?
I was brought here like everyone else.
what do you mean,"Brought here"?
you know exactly what I mean.
you didn't give your friend the pill, did you?
no.
why not?
because I don't know what's in it.
it will eliminate... - the infection, yeah.
I got that.
but what's in it?
I cannot explain. - Try.
there isn't any time.
he'll die if you don't... - he already died.
what is in it?
you just have to trust me.
I don't trust myself.
how am I supposed to trust you?
let's see where trust gets us.
now... are you gonna tell me What's in it?
poison.
come in.
excuse me.
ms. Littleton?
um, yeah?
I'm detective rasmussen.
is ms. Hart here?
uh, I'm sorry. Who?
she signed in with you.
she was just the, um, the cab driver.
I needed help, and she brought me up here.
she left after they treated me, though.
did she, uh, Give you any indication where she was headed?
Why? Is something wrong?
no.
it's nothing for you to worry about.
come on. Let's go.
Thanks.
sure.
thank you.
Why--why are they after you?
What--what did you do?
would you believe me if I said I was innocent?
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
well, I should go.
Oh, wait.
um... Here.
take my credit card. - No.
there's not much of a limit on it, but it's something.
you don't have to do this.
you didn't have to do what you did either.
aaron's a great name.
I don't know why I said it.
it's like... I don't know.
I knew it or something.
I think you should keep him.
well, um, good luck.
Yeah.
you, too.
Thanks.
he swallowed it?
Yes.
what's this?
tea.
why would you people want to kill sayid?
we believe he has been...
closest translation is "Claimed.
claimed.
by what?
there is a darkness growing in him.
and once it reaches his heart, Everything your friend once was...
will be gone.
no, I... How can you be sure of that?
because it happened to your sister.
get up!
that's for my head.
now... Where's that bitch?
I don't know.
you don't understand.
I'm going back to the temple!
Yeah, right.
it looks like he's alone.
maybe we should take him back.
or maybe we didn't find him alive.
Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.
he may be one of them.
where you goin'?
bitch So Bitch
Jin. Come on. Wake up, buddy. wake up.
how long have I been out?

how stupid do you think I am?
pretty damn stupid, actually.
excuse me?
this is a setup, lady.
there's a van sittin' right outside.
the room is bugged.
the place is surrounded by cops.
so now you wanna put that gun down, And we'll work something out.
they don't care about you.
they want your husband.
there's a tracer in the case.
all you had to do Was take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out.
you really except me to believe That you're working with the police?
if this place is surrounded, How come no one came to save you?
I don't need saving,'
cause you're gonna do the right thing And put that gun down.
but if you don't,
well, then all I gotta do is say the magic work,
and that door busts open.
you're a lousy con man.
la" What?
police! Drophe gun!
behind your back.
cuttin' it a little close, huh?
only way to cut it.

I know that everyone is tired.
it was a... A long and traumatic night for all of us.

and I will make myself available to answer them.
but right now we need to keep moving.
we have to take advantage of the daylight.
we wanna know What happened to the people who stayed behind at the temple.

Bye-bye.

who's anthony cooper?
old buddy I ran into.
said he could hook me up with some laker tickets.
that's cool.
what, did you- -you see him in palm springs?
what?
palm springs?
your trip last weekend? - Yeah.
it's a blur.
too much sunshine.
too many mai tais.
well, get it together, because you got a date tonight, pal.
date with who?
friend of mine, works with my dad at the museum.
she's great.

it's just, uh...
I don't know if I can get another seat.
you know you can tell me the truth...
about anything.
are you lying to me, man?
why the hell would I lie?
about a quarter mile ahead, there's a clearing.
we'll make camp there.
everybody fill up on water.
we might be there a couple of days.
a couple of days?
I thought you said we were gettin' off this rock.
we are. - When?

great. Let's go.
I wish you hadn't interrupd me.
I'm sorry. I forgot my manners.
I forgive ya.
what happened back at the temple?
how'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing?
I didn't rescue them.
I'm the smoke thing.
you telling me you killed all those people?
I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully,
and they didn't take it.
why not?
because they're convinced That they're protecting the island from me,
when, in fact, all I wanna do is leave.
so it's either kill or be killed.
and I don't want to be killed.
we goin' on a boat ride?
you are.
where?
hydra island.
what's on hydra island?
the plane.
the ajira flight.
the same plane that brought your friends back.
unfortunately, they didn't come alone.
and I have reaso to believe that Some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm.
so I want you to go over there and do some recon.
well, that sounds safe.
you'll be fine.
yeah?
well, what am I supposed to do If I run into somebody who wants to do me harm?
I'm not worried about that.
Oh, you're not, huh?
no, because you are the best liar I ever met.
you tell 'em whatever you need to tell 'em To gain their trust, find out everything you can about them,
and then get back here.
why exactly am I doing this again?
why do you think, james?
we get on the plane, we fly off this island,.
and we never look back
come on.

okay, do me a favor, james, and don't treat me like All the other girls who ask you.
tell me the truth.
well... I guess I...
got to a point in my life Where I was either gonna come a criminal or a cop.
so I chose cop.

bring it next time.
you want some water? - Yes, please.

I ran your credit card.
I know you went to sydney.

you know what?
you're right, Because I'm not your partner anymore.
you thirsty?
very.
I'm sawyer.
I'zoe.
I can't believe there's anybody left alive.
I thought I knew everybody on the plane.
I didn't come on this plane.
what plane did you come on?
long story.
what the hell happened here?
what killed all those people?
I... We--we crashed here, And we were all just waiting for... Someone to rescue us.
I was out collecting wood When I heard... Screaming.
screaming?
when... When I came back... They were-- they were all dead.
I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here.
I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun.
are you alone?
no.
I'm with a group of people back on the main island.
I can take you back there.
Oh, thank god.
trust me, God's got nothing to do with it.
I'm sorry, kate.
excuse me?
I have to take responsibility for claire's behavior.
I was the one who told her that the others had her baby.
why would you tell her that?
have you ever had an enemy?
someone that you needed to hate?
very powerful, isn't it?
Claire was devastated without aaron.
she needed something to... Something to keep her going, so... I gave her something to hate.
and then when you told her the truth, All those feelings, all--all that anger That she'd been holding on to for so long-- It had to go somewhere.
very insightful... Coming from a dead man.
well, nobody's perfect.
I'm sorry that this happened.
and I'm sure if you give her time, Everything will be all right.
I promised before that I would keep everyone safe, And that means you, too, kate.
where did sawyer go?
I'll show you.
think that thing'll still fly?
I don't know.
it'll take a bit of work And someone who knows how to - how to do it.
I-I take it you haven't come across the pilot?
no, ma'am.
how many people did you say were with you?
couple dozen.
did they all come on the same plane with you?
some, not all.
when did you crash?
long time ago.
do you all have guns?
I mean, whoever killed those people back there, They--they might come back.
Yeah, we got plenty of guns.
you wanna grab that end?
Where'd you say you were headed?
what's that?
your flight. Where were you going?
uh... Guam.
what's in guam?
my boyfriend.
you're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good.
what are you talking about?
who are you?
put your weapon down!
drop it now!
your name even zoe?
is yours sawyer?
down on your knees!
all right, all right. You got me.
take me to your leader.
that island over there - that's where I sent sawyer.
you could've just told me That you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages.
you didn't have to bring me down here.
sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you.
you referred to me as a dead man.
I am not a dead man.
I know what you're feeling, kate.
I know what you're going through.
how do you know that? - Because...
my mother was crazy.
a long time ago, before I... Looked... Like this, I had a mother, just like everyone.
she was a very disturbed woman.
and as a result of that... I had some growing pains...
problems that I'm still trying to work my way through.
problems that... Could h-have been avoided, Had things been different.
why are you telling me this?
because now... Aaron... Has a crazy mother, too.
get in.
he's waiting for you.
it's not me I'm worried about.
I just don't know what I'd do If anything ever happened to you and ma.
anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us.
not today, anyway.
it's the way you live this life, Each day one at a time.
now if you spend your whole life Worrying about something that's gonna happen,
before you know it, your life's over And you spent an awful lot of it just worrying.
Hey, you hear that?
that's what life's all about-- Laughing and loving each other,
and knowing that people aren't really gone when they die.
we have all the good memories to sustain us Until we see 'em again.
it's hard not being afraid, pa.
I know, sweetheart I know.
you've got to be joking.
may I come in?
absolutely not. - Why not?
you don't get to kick me out at 3: 00 in the morning
and then come 'round the next day With puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower.
look, I don't know If you're just lonely or guilty or completely mad.
buy you know what? I don't care.
you blew it.
what you got in here?
none of your business. Keep moving.
come.
he's here, sir.
Thanks, zoe.
would you leave us, please?
of course.
Hello, mr. Ford.
my name is charles widmore.
do you know who I am?
of course I do.
you're the fella sent a freighter to the island,
it's sad, really...
how little you actually know.
well, I know you murdered all them people out there And dropped 'em in the ditch.
we didn't murder those people.
but I don't expect you to believe that.
good,'cause I don't.
so why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island?
John locke sent me.
John locke's dead.
I think we both know the guy I'm talking about Is not really locke.
so here's the deal, chief.
I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear, That I didn't find anybody.
then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep.
then you can kill him.
and what do you want in exchange, james?
one-- the people I come back with-- The people on my boat
don't get touched, not even a hair on their head.
and two-- You give us safe passage off the island.
how do I know I can trust you?
same way I know I can trust you.
so... Do we have an agreement?
I suppose we do.
I-- I just, um... I-I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that.
I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me And out aaron.
thank you. Thank you for taking care of him.
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
it's okay.
it's okay.
how'd go?
you didn't really send me over there To find passengers from that plane, did you?
no.
well, in case you're interested, They're all dead.
well, that's terrible. What happened?
I don't know.
well, what do you know, james?
I know there's a man over there on that island
that ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight.
came over on a sub.
name's widmore.
Charles widmore?
well, I guess y'all know each other.
he ain't alone.
I counted at least six armed compadres with him, Not to mention whatever crew's on that sub.
there's a locked room on there - somethin' they're hiding.
and they're settin' up pylons, like the ones at new otherton.
you know... The ones that keep out that smoke thing.
and what did you tell them about me?
I told them I'd tell you the coast was clear and bring you back with me.
walk you right into their trap.
that way, they could kill you...
which means they'll be caught with their pants down When we change our plan of attack.
I appreciate your loyalty, james.
you said you were gonna get me off this island.
deal's a deal.
what are you doing here?
get in t car.
who's sawyer?
when I was 9 years old, My father shot my mother, and then he killed himself.
sawyer was the reason why.
he was a grifter. Con man.
I've been hunting him down Since the day I left the academy.
I chased down a lead in australia, Got a name--anthony cooper.
I ran the name. I got a list of anthony coopers, And I've been calling them.
and when I find the right one... I'm gonna kill him.
why didn't you tell me any of this?
I knew you'd try and talk me out of it.
damn right.
fair enough.
my car!
Hey!
son of a bitch.
what's for dinner?
rabbit. I think.
good. I'm starving.
what are you doing running errands for locke?
I ain't runnin' errands for nobody.
he said he sent you over to the other island.
did you find the plane?
Yeah.
and that ain't the only thing over there.
a guy named widmore set up camp on the beach,
got a whole team with him-- Guys with guns.
they're here for locke.
so what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna let them fight it out.
and while they got their hands full with each other...
you and me are gettin' the hell off this island.
even if we could get on that pla, who's gonna fly it?
we ain't taking the plane, freckles.
we're taking the sub.
son of a bitch.
we're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke?
you found what they were hiding in the submarine.
I most certainly did.
Hello, hugo. - We have to talk to you.
we"?
okay, guys.
come on out.
Hello, jack.
I was hoping you'd come.
I think we have some catching up to do.
this was your idea.
you all right with me talking with him alone?
it's all you, dude.
all right, let's catch up.
you look just like him.
does it bother you?
no, what bothers me is I don't have any idea what the hell you are.
sure you do.
why john locke?
because he was stupid enough to believe That he'd been brought here for a reason,
because he pursued that belief until it got him killed,
and because you were kind enough To bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.
he had to be dead before you could look like him.
that's right.
who else have you looked like?
Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
the third day we were here, I saw...
I chased my father through the jungle--My... My dead father.
was that you?
Yes, that was me.
Why?
you needed to find water.
this may be hard for you to believe, jack,
but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.
help me? To do what?
leave.
but because jacob chose you, You were trapped on this island before you even got here.
but now jacob's dead.
we don't have to be trapped anymore.
we can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.
and if we can just fly away whenever we want, Why are you still here?
because it has to be all of us.
what?
John locke was the only one of us That ever believed in this place.
he did everything he could To keep us from leaving this island.
John locke was not a believer, jack.
he was a sucker.
sinus tach at 130, b.P. Dropping.
last read was 62 over 30, Possibly due to internal bleeding.
any signs of neurological damage?
no response in lower reflexes.
that's because he's a paraplegic. - You know this man?
Yes. He's a substitute teacher at my school. His name is...Locke.
Mr. Locke. I don't know his first name.
but he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?
smashed to pieces, that thing probably saved his life.
I saw the man that did this, the--the hit-and-run driver. He--he was at our school.
when we get to the hospital, you can talk to the cops.
but do you know anyone we can contact for him?
I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him - helen. - What did you say?
I was... Gonna marry her.
well...
you're still gonna marry her'cause you're gonna be okay, mr. Locke.
John. My name is john.
blunt force trauma victim, late 40s male, He needs a c. T. Scan.
baby! Baby! - Yes, sir. I understand. She's pregnant.
we're gonna take good care of her. - Baby!
500 lost cc's. External blood loss. - baby!
we're gonna do everything we can.
what is it?
you can come out.
you following us, claire?
Yeah.
Why?
cause he's my brother.
looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do.
I'll leave you to it.
Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th
did he tell you?
that he was the one pretending to be our father?
Yeah. Yeah, he told me.
you know, I pretty much gave up hoping That you'd ever come back.
now that you're here...
it's--it's good to see you, jack.
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
you know, I-I never really had much in the way of family,
so it... Really means a lot that you're coming with us.
actually, I haven't--I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
Yeah, you have.
what do you mean?
you decided the moment you let him talk to you, Just like the rest of us.
so, yeah, Whether you like it or not, You're with him now.
he's got a submarine?
keep your voice down, damn it.
Yeah, widmore's got a sub.
we're using it to get off this rock.
are we gonna tell sun?
Kate's telling her now.
I thought we might want to avoid huddles.
what about sayid?
Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.
Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, anakin
who the hell's anakin?
look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothin' to no one.
Hey, claire.
Hey, hurley.
you look great.
it's so nice to have everyone back together again.
want an apple?
Hey, schaub, I'm the one who brought her in.
wanna give us a minute?
funny. You don't strike me as the murdering kind.
that's because I'm not.
you be sure and mention that to feds when they get here.
there something you wanted?
you remember me? From the airport?
we were on the same flight from sydney.
Yeah, I remember.
having that little meet-up in the elevator?
and a week later--boom.
of all the cars in los angeles, you smash into mine.
almost like someone's trying to put us together.
are you hitting on me?
it'd never work, sweetheart. I'm a cop. You're a murderer
I already told you. I'm not a murderer.
Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.
so why didn't you arrest me?
I did arrest you.
no, in l. A.X.the elevator.
you saw I was wearing handcuffs.
I didn't see any handcuffs.
all I saw was A pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.
you know what I think?
I think you let me go because you went to australia,
and you didn't want anyone to know you were there.
should I tell that to the feds when they get here?
Oh, I like you.
Jim. Got a live one. Come on.
sorry. Duty calls.

he said that he wants to leave, And we all have to go together.
and do you believe him? - I'm not sure yet.

listen up, everyone.
what's going on?
people are trying to kill us again.
all this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected,

trying to provoke us into a confrontation.
well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get.
gather your things.
we're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane.
James, I need your help with something.
there's a boat moored Just a few hours down the shore from here.
I want you to get it and meet the rest of us On the other side of these bluffs.
we'll all sail over to the other island together. Can you do that, james?
how come we're not all heading for it together?

how about it, freckles? Know anything about sailing?
I know enough.
good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?
can you give me a hand with somethin'?

just listen. First chance you get, You double back, hoof it to this spot.
there's an old dock.
grab hugo, sun and lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.
what about sayid and claire?
sayid's a zombie and claire's nuts.
she gave up her ticket when she tried to kill kate,
and I ain't gonna let that happen again.

but how am I supposed to get us away from--from locke?
you figure it out.
ready to roll?
what was that all about?
guy talk.
I need you to go out to where I've got desmond.
I thought you weren't going to give him back.
I'm not.
you're gonna kill him.
and that's not gonna be a problem, is it, sayid?
you do still want what you asked me for, right?
Yes, I do.
then go do what I said.
so what did he offer ya?
if you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...
I think I have a right to know What you're gettin' in exchange for it.
he told me I could get something back I lost.
and what did you lose?
the woman I loved.
and where is she now?
dead.
and what makes you think locke can bring her back?
I died...
and he brought me back.
so what will you tell her?
what do you mean?
this woman--When she asks you what you did to be with her again...
what will you tell her?
what's going on?
everything will be okay for you now.
I took care of it.
what do you mean? Where are you going?
I have to leave.

you ready to get wet?
you sure this is a good idea?
you see a bridge?
going back to get locke.
what?
we're gonna ditch locke.
you, me, jack, hurley, sun and that pilot that looks like
he's stepped off the set of a burt reynolds movie.
when were you planning on telling me this?
now.
wait. You didn't say claire.
cause she ain't comin'.
the claire you came back for is gone.
I promised I would bring her back.
that was before she started drinkin' locke's kool-aid.
she's dangerous. You really want her around aaron?
let's go. We ain't got much time.
Hey, claire.
how long have you been with locke?
ever since you left.
so you trust him?
Yeah.
Why?
cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.
sun, have you seen sayid?
he was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back.
Oh, the silent treatment?
I'm sorry, sun, but I didn't do anything to you.
James should be on his way by now.
just keep everyone moving to the beach. I'll catch up with you there.
where are you going?
I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.
hurley, wait up. sun.
we have to go now. - Go where?
there's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.
um, I think we should stick to sawyer's plan, Or he'll be really pissed.
this is sawyer's plan. Let's go.
where have you been?
doing what you asked.
then what took you so long?
I just shot an unarmed man.
I needed a moment.
did you kill him, sayid?
of course I did.
go and check, if you like.
come on. We have a boat to catch.
I hope you know where you're going, 'cause that smoke thing Runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.
sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.
there they are!
all right. Let's go. Everybody onboard. Let's go!
we sailin' home on this, huh?
won't work, not without a bearing.
for three years, the only way dharma folk Ever got on or off this island was by sub,
so that's what we're doing. Nice job, doc.
where you going?
claire...It's okay.
we're leaving the island.
then, uh, why aren't you waiting for john?
because that's not john,
and whoever he is, he's not one of us.
come with us.
I can get you back to aaron.
wait a damn min... - sawyer, shut up.
she is coming or I'm not.
come with us, claire.
John promised me... - no, I'm promising you.
I was there when he was born.
and I never should've raised him.
it should've been you.
I came back to get you so you could be with him again.
it's the only reason I came back to the island, claire.
so, please, come with us.
let's go home.
all right. Get on the boat before locke gets here.
he finds out we're gone...He's gonna be mad.
it's your mom.
Yeah, we just got here.
thank you.
uh... I don't know.
I'll have him home as soon as I can. Maybe, like, 5:00?
actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards.
so, uh... Maybe more like 7: 00?
all right.
Yeah, I'll drop him off.
you know, Hearing your grandfather's will being read,
I know it's not the most fun, but...
it'll be over soon, I promise.
and it's--it's okay to be sad.
I'm sad for you, dad.
let's go.
Mr. Shephard.
hello.
and you must be david. - Hi.
we're set up in the conference room.
I've got a surprise for you.
do you believe in fate?
this is claire littleton.
Claire, this is mr. Shephard and his son david.
hello. I'm--I'm jack shephard.
Hi, it's, uh, it's really nice to meet you.
you found her.
actually, she found us.
you were in my father's will.
do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?
he was my father, too.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
this is the, uh, this is the service.
Yeah, this is dr. Shephard.
no, no, it's not a very good time.
Yes, they can go ahead and prep him.
I'm 20 minutes away.
I'm so sorry. There's been an emergency at the hospital,
and, um...We're gonna have to reschedule.
I know I'm a little late to the party, captain,
but you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?
my plan, chesty, is to land on hydra island,
get ourselves nice and cuddly with widmore
until we get a chance to jump on that sub.
then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face And make 'em take us home.
I like that idea.
I saw some canned food down in the galley.
anybody else starvin'?
freckles. Take the wheel a minute?
sure.
be nice.
didn't think you'd show up, doc.
sorry?
taking orders ain't your strong suit.
nice to see you finally came around.
this doesn't feel right.
what doesn't feel right?
leaving the island.
you wanna tell me why not?
because I remember how I felt last time I left...
like a part of me was missing.
they got pills for that, doc.
we were brought here Because we're supposed to do something. James.
and if locke-- that... That thing--Wants us to leave?
maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.
get off my damn boat.
what?
you got a decision to make and you make it now.
either you're with us, You keep that damn crazy talk to yourself,
or you're going in the water.
James, this is a mistake.
and I know there's a part of you that feels that.
the island is not done with us yet.
Yeah, well, I'm done with this island.
so if you wanna take a leap of faith, jack, then take it.
get off my damn boat.
I'm sorry that I got juliet killed.
what did you say to him? - He changed his mind.
what do you mean, he changed his mind?!
what did you say to him? - He ain't comin' with us.
we have to go back and get him.
we're done going back, kate.
so all these years, You had no idea your dad had another kid?
Nope. None.
Wow. I can't believe he never even mentioned her.
Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.
is that where you get it from?
Yeah, probably.
all right. Uh...
you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
uh, yeah, sure.
good luck, dad.
Thanks.

it got into an accident.
I swear I didn't do it. It was Jin.
weII, it's been a few days.
at that intersection by the cIub. Jin took the car out.
he dodged an approaching car.
but that crazy bastard crossed the median.
so he tried to avoid it, but wham.
Oh that? That's Ryu Jin.
I toId you he was in the car.
peopIe get smaII Iike that after they die.
Yes, it's me.
how come I can't reach you? - I was out of the country.
Really? - Yeah.
how have you been? - Fine, and you?
I'm fine as aIways.
you missed me, didn't you? - Of course.
what are you doing today?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd go to jaiI.
forget it.
he said he was going to take care of everything.
I didn't do it.
weII, aII women are the same.
I'II make the IOU for six months.
thanks for this.
don't do this.
don't go. You know how much I Iove you.
I don't need Iove.
is this Ryu Jin's ceII phone?
it's mine now.
let's go to the cIub.
I got Iots of money!
Where've you been?
so handsome.
JuIian, Iook at me.
I Iove you everyone. Cheers!
Cheers! - Cheers!
my cIub's number one host, JuIian.
you've been through a Iot.
but you know what?
I found out about it aII whiIe you were in prison.
so you wanted to go independent after swindIing money from rich girIs?
you know that bad rumors get around in this town.
shut up!
don't try to pIay games with me.
look at me straight in the eyes.
even your wonderfuI piece down there is through now.
what a cooI breeze.
but I smeII a woman's groin in the wind.
shit, this isn't right.
peopIe have misunderstood one thing about me.
a guy Iike me can never faII.
you got that right!
the king of Adonis CIub wiII never faII.
so how about we go independent now as you pIanned.
your fan cIub wiII be waiting in Iine aII across the country.
I'II do my best to heIp.
shit!
you bastard.
you crazy bastard!
get out of the truck! You're a reaI wisecrack.
get out right now.
long time no see. - You're a reaIIy funny guy, with that big car of yours.
Hey! You!
you two know each other?
damn it!
what the heII is this?
huh?
do you know how to drive?
this is crazy.
you Iook reaIIy beat.
Yes, I sure am.
I have a probIem.
I know.
I heard you went straight to the cIub.
that's why I came to you right away.
you know? ReaIIy?
pIease heIp me out.
let's see.
TotaI, 2. 87 miIIion doIIars.
Pius, the 6-month interest on the Ioan.
sorry.
one month.
this cIock is ticking on your behaIf.
the worId is unpredictabIe.
fun, isn't it?
Hey! wait.
wait.
2. 87 miIIion doIIars in one month?
come on.
that's crazy!
then, shaII we make it three days?
when you were a big shot, you were the one who demanded 500, 000 doIIars in three days.
so you shouId know the ruIes.
you shouId've Iived with modesty.
and don't forget the one who made you what you are.
it's JuIian.
caII me at this number.
shit.
why'd you bring that bastard here?
Ji-hyae!
you've got no manners. - Why the fuck are you cursing?
go away!
Yes, it's JuIian. - Where do you think you are?
no way, so what happened?
so there was no other choice.
in that tiny basement,
I spent that winter with my insane aIcohoIic father.
what a rotten mother.
how couId she have abandoned you?
don't know.
he Iooked at me...
with a very sad face one day.
and then he caressed his hand on my face.
I reaIIy hated it.
his hand was damp and smeIIed strange.
and the moment he Iit the cigarette in his mouth, he burned.
in fIames.
he burned in front of my eyes.
haIf of his body was burned to a crisp.
that's nonsense.
it's a Iie again, right?
of course it's a Iie.
come on.
it was true?
come here,
I'II hug you.
no, I have a meeting at three.
here you are.
you're such a IoveIy woman.
six months for the IOU?
I toId you, it's my present.
money, money.
what? OnIy one grand?
what bad manners.
it's enough for just a pair of shoes.
dom Perignon Vintage, pIease. - Yes.
who keeps caIIing a hundred times a day?
one of Ryu Jin's cIients, I bet. Listen to the message.
there's probabIy no password.
you know the saying, your girI is my girI, and my girI is yours.
or... reguIars foIIow wherever the famous chef goes.
how much?
my name is Park Ki-young, Your father's lawyer,
what does it say? You can teII if they're rich...
I'm calling you to talk about your inheritance,
your father has passed away,
I feeI reaIIy bad for the guy.
he said he went through a Iot when he Ieft home after his parents divorced.
his parents are aII dead and now their son.
onIy thing Ieft is the money.
whether you're rich or a host, you're aII the same when you die.
don't you agree?
Oh yeah, he said once that he's got a younger sister.
then she'II get aII that money.
this is his younger sister?
Yeah, she's twenty.
he wrote Ietters to her everyday.
everyday?
Yes, everyday.
crazy bastard.
pIay this. - Okay.
let's go at Ieast.
we'II hand over the ashes, and offer our grievances.
teII them how sorry we are and shed some tears.
that way we'II get compensated with some money.
he's rich.
Jin, what do you want? - Rice,
anything,
nothing hard about it.
we're the onIy ones who can give this to Jin's famiIy.
let's go.
what if you can't pay him back in a month?
he'II kiII me.
what? Then he won't get his money.
I don't want to die, that's why I pay him back.
damn it, it's raining.
it's pouring.
what a house. - Hop out.
look at that house.
it's a huge mansion.
what is your name?
Micky. Cute and fun Micky.
not that, your reaI name.
kim Tae-ho?
Yes, Tae-ho.
from now on, forget about JuIian and Micky.
you're Kim Tae-ho, Ryu Jin's secretary.
what?
there's aIso a woman in that house.
hoId on.
who is it? - Ryu Jin.
you're going to impersonate him?
you're no Ryu Jin.
I'm not going. I'm scared.
you'II go to jaiI again if you get caught.
trying to take me to jaiI with you?
I'm scared.
thank you for coming.
I'm Park Ki-yong, the one who caIIed you.
she's been taking care of this house for 15 years.
this is Ms. Lee.
and Mr. Oh here has been running your father's company after his death.
pieased to meet you.
this is my secretary, Kim Tae-ho.
and my sister?
Mr. Park. - I know it's a formaIity, but we need to make sure about your background, so...
so?
check my identification?
mother Ioved the cIock on that waII.
but it's not here anymore.
it used to hang there.
that...
mother picked a picture herseIf, and hung it here.
it's aII been changed.
was it that bastard again?
I didn't come here for this.
so is that why the appIe tree in the yard was thrown away?
there was such a thing?
the appIe tree that Mother raised!
we came to this house after you and your mother had Ieft...
it was there!
mother and I raised that tree ourseIves!
Where's Min?
huh?
min.
min!
who are you to yeII in here?
min, it's me, your brother.
don't Iet any strangers into my house.
min, it's raining outside!
my sister can't see?
actuaIIy, I was going to teII you.
min, wait!
min, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
min!
it's been so Iong. My onIy image of you as a kid...
Jin!
min!
I'm sorry, Min.
from now on, I wiII...
go back!
you and mom died 16 years ago.
I've never once forgotten about you.
you know that. It was aII in the Ietters.
letters?
there were Ietters?
no, we didn't receive any Ietters.
Mr. Park.
compensate him and send him away.
in your father's wiII, your brother is aIso entitIed to the inheritance.
you must sign first for the inheritance - to be settIed. - I toId you he's dead!
why do I need to sign for a dead person?
okay, you take care of it.
because I don't need that money.
then get out of here right now.
min!
we're the onIy two Ieft.
I can't Ieave you aIone and go.
if you smiIe...
if you smiIe Iike you once did, then I'II Ieave.
untiI then,
I want to be with you.
now are you satisfied?
leave.
min, my Iove for you...
I don't need Iove.
CEREBRAI thrombosis?
she feII sick when she was 13, and totaIIy Iost her sight at 15.
what did that father of ours do at the time?
he did the best he couId for Min.
he took her to aII the famous hospitaIs.
he even took her overseas many times.
aithough she was in a criticaI state, she survived thanks to him.
you'II find it comfortabIe for your stay here.
I'II cIean up the room on the third fIoor.
you can move your beIongings in there.
don't worry about me.
I have to go overseas soon for an important business.
this is the room.
Bye. - Thank you.
have a good rest. - Yeah.
I was scared out of my wits.
we wouId've been dead if it wasn't for this baII.
that girI's got a serious temper. She takes after her brother.
is your face aIright?
go pack my stuff and bring them here.
there's a fine for every inch ripped even on a pooI tabIe.
so imagine scratching JuIian's face. It's a crime.
so my Iife is in her hands.
he's different from what I had imagined.
as you know, peopIe are infIuenced by the environment they're raised in.
I'm teIIing you, it was unreaI.
I couId feeI his mastery.
that teary-eyed acting of his.
I shouId've recorded that stuff and study it.
but I didn't bring the camera.
Hey!
do it right.
you missed the naiI.
I'm sorry.
you can't get anything right.
you know exactIy what an inheritance is?
study that instead. Think you'II get the job done?
you two are hopeIess anyway.
a Ferrari.
nice.
deIicious.
thank you for the meaI.
there's stiII some Ieft.
it's bad manners not to finish.
min usuaIIy doesn't eat much.
then put your dishes away.
UsuaIIy, I... - Ms. Lee, I wasn't taIking to you.
min!
it's etiquette to take your dishes at Ieast.
saw that?
a bIind person can't do this.
Ryu Min!
pIease stop.
there are many peopIe who can do this even though they can't see.
min!
I'II heIp you. Let's go downstairs.
I get scared if you suddenIy grab me!
you do? Sorry, I didn't know.
but...
but Ms. Lee can't aIways be by your side.
so Iet's put in an effort together so that you can do things yourseIf.
is that what you wanted to say?
don't worry about triviaI stuff Iike that.
money can handIe everything.
I feeI the same way.
min.
can you hear me?
the most important thing in the worId is that can't be bought with money.
don't weigh money and your heart on the same scaIe.
understand?
min gets scared when many peopIe are around.
she particuIarIy disIikes outsiders coming here.
if something happens, how wiII you...
who did this?
I did not permit this!
min, shaII we pIay, too?
ms. Lee.
Yes, I'm here, Min.
send everyone out.
send them out this instant!
you're being too mean to the kids.
who cares? If I don't Iike it, that's it.
yeah?
then you Ieave.
don't Iock yourseIf in, just because you can't see.
min...
don't interfere. This is a famiIy matter.
be carefuI on your way out.
ms. Lee, what's the best way to grab on to a bIind person?
here, grab on to this.
I thought you've never been outside aIone.
I'II heIp you.
carefuI, carefuI.
even the smeII of the grass is nice.
aII I smeII is cigarette smoke.
fine.
I know that you had a hard Iife.
but I'm here now.
there's onIy the two of us.
us two have to Iive together.
so can't you open your heart a bit?
Oh yeah, you said money is aII you need?
sure you do.
but you think the worId wiII be easy on a bIind girI?
never. It doesn't work that way.
min.
I'II take care of everything from now on.
just trust me and foIIow me.
let's make a new start.
I know how you feeI.
I'II never Ieave you.
you know how I feeI? - Let me finish!
how do you know how I feeI?
know how it feeIs to graduaIIy Iose your sight?
min! - Let go!
know how it feeIs to Iose the memories you want to cherish?
it wouId've been better if I was just born bIind.
I want you to remember exactIy how crueI you've been to me.
I was doing weII forgetting.
but now, you're making me remember everything.
wiII the stone turn into a Iump of goId?
I think you've picked up the wrong stone.
Jin.
kiII me.
Tae-ho,
I got a favor to ask.
are you sure?
don't ask.
I ordered it from a trustworthy website.
but aren't you going overboard?
who'd give a deadIy piII to someone as a gift?
but it does seem possibIe.
peopIe, you see, don't die so easiIy.
so what does this cane have to do with it?
a present for my sister,
a mascot of fortune?
what?
a gift?
min, what are you going to do today?
there are things that you see which can't be seen.
want to go with me?
anyway, what's in this?
Oh, that?
drugs.
drugs?
drugs that wiII make you die.
I thought you wanted to die.
don't be scared.
it was a joke.
if you say you're going to die again, you'II get a beating, okay?
it'II reIieve aII your stress!
come this way!
grab the trigger and hoId the gun Iike this.
and then shoot.
I'II aim for you and you just shoot, okay?
I can't.
Yes, you can.
shoot again.
it was cIose.
what a great coupIe!
let me take your picture.
I'II capture a wonderfuI memory.
min, wait here. I'II be right back.
what are you doing? You were doing great.
she'II hate you again.
sadness foIIows happiness.
when it comes, it's very painfuI.
right?
you feeI Iike dying.
min!
sorry, I got caught up on my way.
it's okay.
since you promised to protect me anyway.
in your awkward BraiIIe Ietter.
show me something fun again.
a witch appeared.
the witch tries to kiII the princess, but the prince appears.
that sound's from somewhere eIse.
I know. Just get the expIanation right.
but that witch is reaIIy ugIy.
very ugIy.
and her cheeks are Ioose.
stay stiII, Iet me see your face.
it's different from the face I had imagined.
Yes, her temperature has gone down.
doctor, I did as you toId me.
Yes.
I understand.
good-bye.
wiII she be aIright?
it's nothing serious, but she'II need to go to the hospitaI tomorrow.
then I'II send the car to her first thing in the morning.
Mr. Oh, you seem to Iook after Min very much.
I'm sorry, I haven't toId you yet.
they'II get married soon.
why haven't you toId me before? I aImost mistook them.
it's getting Iate. You shouId get going.
I'II take her to the hospitaI tomorrow.
HeIIo.
so is this Ryu Jin?
nice to meet you. I shouId've greeted you sooner.
sorry we had to meet the first time Iike this.
what are you taIking about?
pardon?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember at aII.
do I know him?
of course.
but why can't I remember?
since when have you known our famiIy?
I must've aged a Iot.
think back carefuIIy.
my famiIy aIso knows you very weII.
no, I'm sure I don't remember.
stop it, Jin.
don't be mean to the Doctor.
forget it. It's okay.
he couId've forgotten. It's been a Iong time.
whether it's 10 or 100 years, I remember everything.
Mr. Ryu Jin.
now, Iet's go up.
where are your manners?
I guess we take after each other.
caII me. I'II be outside.
no, pIease go on with your business.
we have some other things to tend to.
okay.
pretty, huh?
but she has no brains.
what happened?
I thought you two were going to the hospitaI.
I don't Iike that famiIy.
Why? Something wrong?
they disgust me.
why are they having a fit over her getting a coId?
she's no paper doII.
they're better than a fake brother.
Yeah.
better than a fake.
Mr. Mustache is here again.
I toId you she's the wrong stone.
teII me the truth.
you Iike being her brother, don't you?
min, try on this wedding dress.
it's in a V-neck.
there's a ribbon here. It's a high waist styIe.
this is a siIver ring.
there's a smaII diamond inside.
you picked the cIothes yourseIf for the first time.
I just wanted to wear them.
a rich girI can't heIp being tacky, either.
I shouId've foIIowed my dad to the driving range instead.
think the driving range wiII heIp you improve your swing?
once this job is a done deaI,
I'II take you to Saipan.
you need to pIay goIf there to get better.
you're taking me, right?
stop the buIIshit.
just pay my money back.
Where's that Iady going?
to the bathroom?
who'd go to the bathroom with her bags?
min!
what if he's not her reaI brother?
pardon?
they found Brendan's car. - Anton was found in his trunk.
who the hell is Anton Bobek? - Boyd's Confidential Informant, and Brendan again.
I got a witness. - He said he saw two suspects put Brendan's body behind the wheel.
one white guy, one black guy.
we're investigating a murder in your neighborhood.
we're planning on opening up a small spot. - Your crew, they're welcome any time.
Hey. If you call Frank, you are dead.
where is she? - I drove her across the border to Windsor.
she's gone.
I want someone in particular.
Romanian.
light hair, fair skin.
green eyes.
uh... emerald eyes.
her name's Katia.
that's her.
I want her.
just coming.
she's not who I asked for.
she's a fun girl.
now something for me.
and I'll hold on to this for you, Frank Agnew.
come in.
I can open the curtains for you if you wanna see the view.
the curtains, I can open for you.
look, I'm trying to find someone.
a woman here in Windsor.
you don't understand.
that's okay.
no, no, no. Don't. No.
it's okay. Close.
go on, close.
you're very pretty.
would you like a drink?
we have alcoholic. We have nonalcoholic.
orange juice. We've got pistachios.
you like pistachios?
candy bar.
that's a great choice.
are you hungry? I can order room service.
what do you want? - No!
okay.
okay, no calls.
no phone.
no, no, no. That's not why I'm here.
listen to me. I won't hurt you. I need to know who controls you.
who controls you, girls like you here in Windsor?
who controls you?
Dmitry! - Shh. No, don't.
no shouting. Shh.
keep quiet. Shh. I won't hurt you.
breathe.
breathe. Okay.
breathe. That's it.
okay.
better?
you okay?
okay, good. Everything's okay.
Dmitry! - No, no! Shh.
No!
open the door!
open the door now!
you brought me the wrong girl.
you gonna sit there all day or are you gonna say something?
I prefer to speak with Detective Agnew.
I prefer to stick your head in the toilet.
just tell me why you're here.
I'll pass it on. - I'll wait.
homicide.
you're a weird dude.
he's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
detective Geddes. - You okay?
what happened?
what did she do? - Your daughter was picked up for shoplifting.
the owner wanted to press charges. I was able to change his mind, sir.
what the hell's the matter with you, girl?
maybe I wasn't raised right.
I don't have responsibility for her. Did you call her mother?
your daughter did, sir. She's on her way.
What'd she steal?
a bag of potato chips, sir, and a box of condoms.
condoms? - Yes, sir. Magnums, sir.
you're lucky I don't stick a Magnum-sized billy club up your ass.
get outta here.
and you, sit down.
you are not moving anywhere.
and if you wanna pee...
pee in a cup.
you're gonna treat me like a slave?
no, I'ma treat you like a criminal if that's what you wanna be.
add it to my file.
count it again. - I counted twice already.
so, count it again. What, you got someplace better to be?
maybe it was Poppa T and them.
maybe it was Poppa T and them what?
skimmed some. I don't know. No one's really watching them.
no one's really watching them?
I'm busy trying to run stuff, Mike.
money's your job. - There's a lot of closed-door transactions.
it's not so easy. - Hey, idiots, come here.
leave the brooms.
all right. From now on, we need to have eyes on Poppa T's crew at all times.
anyone that ain't one of us, ain't one of us.
do me a favor, count this.
I counted it twice already.
check this out.
she looks like she's 14 years old.
Hey, sweetheart.
who told you about this place? How'd you get here?
I don't know. I heard you can make some money.
Frank F'in' Agnew. - Hey.
I was in the area. - You work four blocks from here.
I got a craving for your coffee.
it's crap from a can. You look like you haven't slept in three days.
cream and sugar?
black's good.
Thanks. - Did something happen to Sean? Is that why you're here?
no, no. I haven't seen him.
he comes in every once in a while.
causes a scene.
throw us ass out every time.
Damon can't stand him.
well, I imagine he can't stand Damon.
Damon's not the one on the street.
that's all Sean. It's his choice.
I'm not here to talk about Sean.
can we sit down? - Yeah.
I'm here to talk about you and Damon.
official business, Detective? - As a friend.
did you hear about Brendan McCann?
well, it's all over the news. - Are you still paying off to Skelos?
we're in Greektown, aren't we?
this place, Maya, this bar was in the file that IA have on Brendan.
so much for not being official business.
why would Brendan come here?
it's not like it's a cop bar.
McCann used to stop in every once in a while for a drink.
other than that, who knows?
is Damon into something with him?
Damon hates cops. - Okay.
I just wanted you to know.
Maya, whatever it is you're into...
stop.
if you lost the key, I'm going to break your freakin' neck.
you used to so love handcuffs, baby.
does anyone have a key for these things?
I got the key. Don't worry, baby.
Joe's ex. - I'm not your baby, dickhead.
Boyd's been waiting for you. - About what?
he won't say. - Where you going?
I got an ID on this drug kid, Billy Hobson.
I'm gonna go ask around his neighborhood, visit his mother, see if anybody cares about him.
well, someone cared enough to kill him.
you riding alone? - I'm a big girl, Frank. Don't worry.
you still married to that old, fat man?
are you still living with mama? - My mama, she lives with me.
detective Agnew. - You're a child and always will be.
just give me a minute. - Still be a better parent than you.
deaf, dumb, drunk, and blind. - Ha!
anytime, anywhere.
how you been, Frank? - Yeah, good, you?
I'm great. Got a new husband. - Fat man in his 60s.
still with Susan? - Uh, no.
probably for the best. You know, cop's wife, all that.
april's gonna come live with me.
I'm her father and I got rights.
actually, you don't.
but she's all yours.
call me when he disappoints you too many times to count.
Hey, I don't wanna live with either of you.
now what?
what the hell just happened?
dad?
Hey, could you maybe just relax?
just for a minute, please.
excuse me.
I don't know if this is any consolation, but this reminds me of an experience I once had with a woman.
and - And what, man?
forgive me for having a moment of empathy.
your chopped-up body was last seen leaving a place called The Raven Lounge with an Eastern European hooker.
I got my daughter here.
this hooker will lead us to whoever killed Anton Bobek,
you ready, Detective? I'll drive.
so you have no recollection of seeing this white man, white woman?
we don't get too many whites in here besides Frank.
a couple others. - His name was Anton.
you don't remember that name at all? - No.
this is a homicide investigation, ma'am. Whatever you can remember.
he left with a white woman from Eastern Europe.
white's white. I don't care where you all come from.
if there were a prostitute working this establishment
what kind of place do you think this is?
hypothetically.
if a prostitute were working here and a john asked for a date, - are there rooms here? - This ain't no whorehouse.
no one's saying it is.
he's just asking if a man were to meet a woman here, pro, where might he take her when they leave?
I don't got the slightest idea. - There's no particular motel nearby or an apartment building?
I already answered that.
you could always ask him.
don't like cops much. Works the door most nights.
much obliged, ma'am. Anything you can remember at all.
Mm-hmm. - Thanks, Latrice.
I wasn't aware that you are a local. - I come for the music.
I need to take a leak. Give me a minute?
sorry about all that.
is Diamond around lately?
she should be in later tonight. - Okay.
do you know who your son Billy may have hung out with or the crowd he ran with?
crowd he run with?
that boy gay as them boys down in Atlanta.
what boys? - He wasn't gay, ma.
that boy liked my man more than I did.
what man are we talking about? - My man. Who you think?
boyfriend, 17, she used to bring around.
crackhead, drug-dealin', womanizin' little bitch.
turned out up north. - He ain't a drug addict no more.
he got his own church and everything.
do you know his name or where I can - How am I gonna know his name, woman? - His name is Daryl Singers.
he ran a little church off Gratiot and Six Mile ever since he found religion.
religion, my black ass. - Thank you for your help.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
you should be sorry!
children dying every day!
and where the cops be at till they already dead?
you see that little bitch, Daryl, you tell him I hope he burn in hell.
Latrice acted like she'd never seen a hooker there in her life.
we oughta kill that son of a bitch.
we're not killing Boyd or anyone else.
we're gonna question everyone Anton ever knew.
anyone shared so much as a cup of coffee with him.
same with McCann. We're gonna be good cops and we're gonna follow our leads.
what leads, Frank?
we're the ones who killed him.
I mean, Hey, now.
see that asshole?
home of the automobile and nobody's got a clue.
you see, we've gotta pin this on somebody. I mean, anybody.
pin it on him or her or whoever.
anyone! - No.
we're gonna do our work, we're gonna let this go cold.
Hey, come on.
I need to clear my head, man.
let's get back. Take care of your daughter. - No, I need to see my girl.
no, what you need is to act smart. All eyes are on you.
my ex-wife, my daughter, my moms.
what are you doing?
it's been a long-ass week, Frank.
where are you going? - Give me 15 minutes.
stop! Stop running or I'll shoot your ass.
not holdin', man, I'm straight.
straight, okay?
then why the hell are you running?
cause you're a cop, I'm not.
Yeah, well, you used to be. You should know better.
well, I'm happy now.
Oh, man.
you got a straw for the ground, man?
you imagine?
that's some rock bottom there, boy.
Yeah, I ain't that bad.
no? - No, man.
I'm just drinking these days.
I got my fireball and I'm all good, man.
it's all cinnamony and shit.
wanna try some?
got my own.
how do you expect to run a blind pig without underage girls?
with girls over 18, that's how. - This ain't a strip club, B.
underage trims half the draw.
Yeah, well, no underage here.
okay? Period.
then I suggest you get some more white girls up in here.
jump, bitch. Do something. - Scared-ass pussy.
I'ma burn this chicken! - I'll shoot! I ain't even playin'!
I'll shoot! I ain't playin'!
I'll shoot at every last one of you bitches.
Hey! Hey! Put it down! - Put it down.
put them down! Put them down!
bitch burnt my hand! - You weren't using them all day, playboy.
shut up! Shut your mouth.
this ain't right, B.
how we gonna make this right?
we're even.
he's ????? she is worse.
all right.
but maybe it's just the way God made 'em, you know.
maybe it's not his fault that he's a scumbag-lowlife-little prick.
she's the one who said...
I do" to that scumbag-lowlife-little prick.
Greek-ass chapels and death-do-us-part plans.
the same plans she made with me.
she's a heartless bitch.
kids and everything.
silly bitch.
come on.
I saw her, you know?
who? - Maya.
I just told you I don't care about her, didn't I?
I just thought you'd want to know.
she's a grown woman doing grown woman things.
I'm a single man, single. When'd you see her?
just recent. I was in the area.
you're always in the area. You work four blocks from there.
she seem okay to you? - She seemed fine.
that's too bad.
I thought you were gonna say she looked like crap and seemed even worse.
she looked like crap and seemed even worse.
I knew it! Yeah!
she ain't nothin' without me!
you know, I haven't seen her in a long time.
probably been about a year now.
you hear about Brendan McCann?
what about him? That prick.
he's dead.
line of duty? Heart attack?
someone killed him.
tried to make it look like a determined suicide.
come on. - Handcuffed him to the steering wheel of his car.
we fished him out of the river two days ago. - You're making this up.
found a chopped-up body in his trunk, too.
Jesus.
I'm supposed to be shaking the trees right now.
so why aren't you? - I just needed 15 minutes.
where you living these days?
just livin', brotha.
you know. - Can I help?
Nah, man, nah. I'm good.
Yeah. Look around.
good to see you, Sean.
Yeah, you, too, man. You stop by anytime.
Hey, Frank.
this stuff about McCann...
I never liked him...
but he was one of us.
I wouldn't know, miss. I've been out the game a while.
running favors for the Lord now.
he turned up dead, Daryl.
we found him shot dead in a trap house not a mile from here.
I didn't hear nothing about that.
I'm sorry, can I offer you something to drink?
a glass of water, iced tea maybe? - No, thanks.
cheese and crackers? - When was the last time you saw him?
since I was a kid, I've loved cheese and crackers.
somebody shot him, Daryl.
your friend Billy. - You can have a seat if you'd like.
somebody put a bullet in his head and left him to have his face chewed off by a pack of stray dogs.
your friend, Daryl. Billy.
fat, ugly white dude ran out of Greektown.
Billy and him...
they was real tight.
well, what did he say?
I told you.
he said there's a file on McCann and we're in it.
he said we're in it or the bar's in it?
baby, he said whatever we're doing to stop.
but he didn't ask about this kid Billy?
no, but - No, he's a Homicide cop, okay?
he didn't say anything about Billy and we didn't kill McCann.
everything's going to be all right, all right?
you're not a bitch.
I'm the asshole.
Hi, Brendan, it's Katia.
Yes.
Hi, Brendan, it's Katia.
Yes.
stop it or lower it.
okay, your grandma and me, we got rules.
routines and such.
and you need to catch on or get shipped back to that East Side asylum known as your mother's.
I didn't ask to stay with you.
Hey, I can take you back there right now.
just say the word.
you see, 'cause one bad thing, it leads to another.
the case I'm working right now- cop killer, worst of the worst.
probably started as a shoplifter like you.
it's a big case. It's a lot of hours.
I barely got time for anything else.
I guess you've been on it the last 13 years.
we don't need it, you know. - I know.
I quit.
since when? - It's not good to do around the kids.
how are they?
perfect.
do you ever miss 'em?
mommy, mommy!
you okay?
Oh, hey, baby.
where you been? I miss you.
I'm looking for a woman- white woman, who was here a couple of nights ago.
this woman, Diamond, she's in danger up in Windsor.
Oh, we all in danger, baby.
where would someone be if someone else didn't want that person to be found?
you asking as a cop or not a cop?
I'm asking as me, please.
I don't know it even exists. Only heard stories.
in Windsor...
ask around a place called Catacombs.
last stop on the pervert train.
this is the last place.
I want you to come with me.
Why? You scared?
I am sorry to disturb so late.
I'm Joe Geddes from DPD, Homicide Division.
don't you people communicate? - I'm sorry, ma'am.
that Chaldean cop lady. What I'ma tell you I ain't already told her?
sorry, uh...
who's that, your daughter?
Yeah.
show your face, girl.
come on over here.
pretty young girl.
so how you like I come around your house all hours when she gets shot dead?
Hey, whoa, whoa. Wait up.
are you saying your son is dead and that a Chaldean cop lady already came by?
what, you deaf, bitch?
that's what I just told you.
let's go.
I'm sorry for your loss. - Mm-hmm, that's what the last one said.
if Greek is what you seek...
??? - I don't speak that shit.
people who forget where they come from don't remember where they're going.
what do you want?
I wasn't invited to the big opening, or any of my men.
Yeah, well, I figured it wasn't really your scene.
do these monkeys buy drugs?
do they pay for these ugly women?
we're not in Greektown right now.
take your medicine, Damon.
pay your taxes, be honest, show respect.
why, so you can bleed me dry like you did with my dad?
Nah, nah. Your dad, nah.
your dad took everything personal.
he moped around, drinking, complaining.
that's because my father was a weak-ass bitch.
he was your father.
old-timer, you on the wrong side of town.
Yeah, must be...
there's too many of your kind in here.
you a cop? - No.
prove it.
I'm looking for a place called the Catacombs.
I ain't going to no Catacombs.
I just need to know where they are.
skelos was outta line, B.
old-timers.
you know they got that code, man.
you misrepresenting about them, perpetrating your affiliation.
funny thing is,
I would've pulled the same play.
youngblood step up, get his.
get us, me,
Reverend Lowdown.
here and now, B. We here now.
anything you want, no judgments, no rubbernecks, no cameras, no rules.
I just want to see a girl.
blonde, green eyes...
emerald eyes, named Katia from Romania.
I need to wash you.
then... whatever you want.
what's your name? - Katia.
what's your real name?
Why? What's yours?
come.
I'm sorry.
for what?
what color are your eyes?
what color do you want them to be?
emerald.
okay.
Oh, please.
I don't want you to be who you are.
I want you to be someone else.
I'm sorry. - Shh.
I don't want to be who I am.
we'll be whoever you want.
say your name.
say your name, please.
say your name.
go to his office.
it is just right through there.
Hey, how'd it go?
so, you'll never guess who I just met.
Billy Hobson's mother.
when, tonight? - Piece of work, that woman, right?
well, her son died. She's grieving.
didn't sound like grief to me.
Billy was on the list of associates of Anton in the trunk.
so get this.
mom and the sister tell me Billy was running with this ex-boyfriend, ex-con, of the mom's.
a guy named Daryl Singers.
I know him. - He says he found the Lord.
what, in the bottom of a crack pipe?
runs his game out of a storefront church on Gratiot.
I went to see him.
he told me he no longer works with Billy, but Billy was working with this fat guy outta Greektown.
Anton Bobek. - Seems like it.
Amen, Brother Daryl.
cause Billy links to Anton and Anton links to McCann and Dani Khalil just cracked this thing wide open.
if it's right, I got lucky.
no, if it's right, you get promoted.
you ready? - I've been ready.
well, grab your shit and let's go.
that's some good work, D.
we'll hit the ground first thing tomorrow.
I found you a new cat.
do you like it?
it's my neighbor's. - Oh, that sucks.
might I- Thought I'd found it for you.
I thought you quit.
every once in a while, no big.
you know I could've broke in, right?
broke a window or something.
but I didn't.
outta respect.
I found you a cat instead.
I thought I did.
thoughts count, you know.
Thanks.
where you been?
started to get worried. Hmm?
Windsor.
Windsor? For what?
there's nothing but Canadians up there.
I went to find someone.
you know, there's people here, too, you know.
not everyone left.
not yet, anyway.
I went to find a woman.
Yeah.
she got to me.
Yeah.
they got a way of doing that.
what's her name?
well, her name. The one that got you all messed up.
that's a nice name.
in the end, all broads are alike, you worry all the time; when they want to split, they don't give a fuck.
when it's over, it's over, "see ya," zero guilt.
with a certain pleasure, I'd say.
we were born to suffer.
this is bliss.
in 2 weeks, there are some French businessmen coming and I want to impress them.
it's a huge deal, you know.
you don't want the salmon mousse with that?
Saumon? - Yes.
Oui. - Yes, of course.
please, a salmon mousse for the lady
what were you saying?
I'm thinking 3, 4 times a week... If you could make it every day, it'd be great.
I'm not sure if 2 weeks will do.
what if you come along?
extra pay, of course.
I'd love to, - but I don't know if I'm up to it. - What do you mean?
you speak perfect French, in my humble opinion.
Merci.
you're very nice.
Merci.
you're beautiful.
and you'll save my life.
Merci.
I had to confront him.
I told him:
if you're so in love with that putaine, leave!
good; what did he say?
he left. Hasn't sent me a dime in 6 months.
c'est fini, dude. - You remind me of a tango lyric:
l can tell just by your looks that you haven't been well loved.
Oui. When shall we start? - Whenever you want.
tomorrow.
tomorrow. - Demain.
let's hear it. - Demain.
no, demain.
will you buy me a flower?
excuse me. - Where are you going?
don't. - What?
a little " romance"? - No...
Romantisme."
I'll make a quick call home to check on the kids.
my phone's been cut off. - How come?
they said something about not paying, screw them.
call from your cell. - No.
it only gets incoming calls.
shit! Bought this from a fakir?
Oh, you want it soft?
let me set the right mood... - You have the remote in the bathroom?
it's the only place where I can't reach the player.
turn that off! I beg you!
it's soul, man! It blows you away! - I'm already blown away!
okay.
you don't take your pants off? - No.
Why?
I need the padding. If not, I'll go to the club.
a little more sheet.
where are we gonna get 40 grand?
we should find out.
you gonna tell me what happened with Veronica?
I don't know...
do you smell what I smell? What a stench of cheesy feet...
you've got a zombie in the closet?
must be that anchovy cologne you wear!
it's these tennis shoes... they've rotten away!
I'd throw them away but they might be hazardous material.
so what happened with your wife?
don't know. She got an age attack. She wants romance, passion...
did she cheat on you? - No, you moron...
she met a guy, I don't know.
she's like... mesmerized.
but did she fuck him or not?
what does that matter? - A lot!
if she fucked him, you're screwed.
what if she just fell in love? - You're screwed too.
so, what does it matter?
let's follow them! Let me follow them! - Are you high? -Why not?
what for? - To shake things up!
to catch them in the act. Aren't you mad? -That's no use.
you think?
you know what she said?
that this guy...
makes her shake...
that he makes her feel things I don't any more...
I don't know.
she fucked him, what a bitch. - I'm going to the club.
what did I say? - She's not a bitch!
why not? - She's not!
she's lonely, doubtful... Unsatisfied. Maybe I didn't give her what she needed...
she's not a bitch. - When you look at it like that, poor girl.
are you crazy? First a bitch, now it's "poor girl"!
is it my fault now? - Let's not talk about Veronica.
Yeah, let's not. - No chick talk.
they mess with your head.
no more giris.
like that neurotic Cristina.
what about her? - I don't know, we went out a couple of times...
she was fine, very seductive, what have you.
then, I don't know.
I'm not her type...
she needs something solid and reliable to get her there.
give her Angelito's number; he sells a '79 Ford.
anyway, it made me re-evaluate my priorities...
yeah? - 'cause now I'm fine here.
I've got my guitar, my cable TV...
my boy.
don't bust my balls. I'm going to the club.
I knew it. - You need love. Come on, daddy!
at least, close the bathroom door, you pig!
Ms.Graciela?
Yes. - A call for you.
for me? - Yes.
Hello? - It's Julio.
Jules, remember?
where are you?
out in the dumps; I can't get used to it.
I liked you, but I'm not coming back.
what? - I'm sorry.
he could've taken me to an all-you-can-eat.
my card was about to be cancelled for lack of use...
I'll pay you back, I swear, slowly...
don't worry about it. - I'll pay you back.
what a moron!
how couldn't I tell? So obvious!
why would he take me as an interpreter? What an idiot!
it reminds me of... what's her name? The journalist. -Which one?
that broad... - Where does she work?
Lois...
she worked in that paper... - Delfino?
no... The other one... Lane. Lois Lane, she had Superman right next to her...
she didn't realize that just taking off his glasses...
she had him there.
anyway, Superman, another turd...
Hey, man.
Hey.
Hello, who is it?
Oh, hi, Cristina...
let me see...
come in.
Hey, man,
Amadeo, wake up.
wake up! Cristina's coming up.
what Cristina? - Cristina, you creep!
what are you doing? Why did you let her in? - She rang the bell!
at this time?
have her call me on the phone. - Your phone's been cut off.
give her your cell number!
hi... - How are you?
how are you?
sorry about the time. Is Amadeo in?
Amadeo?
Amadeo!
who is it?
Cristina.
Cristina who?
Cristina me.
well, he won't answer me.
I must've hurt him like hell with what I said...
I'll leave you this.
it's two rings...
same pattern as the bracelet. I made them with Brunito's braces.
hang on a second. - Well...
she wants to see you, look what she made.
what's this? Shit! I pricked myself!
what is it? - It's handicraft, don't be a coward, get out...
you shouldn't have let her in.
I'll beat the shit out of you.
come out! Now! - All right.
ladies and gentlemen...
from the top of this soapy pole...
70 years of history look upon us...
today we'll show the entire community.
we're not in decline,
that's a word we have to erase...from our vocabulary, by repeating words like...
don Aquiles.
since that remote night in which three Galician boys...
Bruni...
you know Mommy doesn't have a nickel.
it's not your fault; not my fault, - It's... whose fault? - Daddy's. -Good
three basic things: Don't borrow, buy or touch anything, ok?
okay, go, have fun!
and what can I do? - What can I do?
watch others have fun. Come, I'll teach you.
up, up, up, up, up!
come on, up, up, up!
we're doing this for the club!
one, two, three!
it's time to give the award for best teammate...in mini-basketball...And the winner is...
Ramiro Cohen!
whoever pays 1 peso can pay 1.20.
it's a 20% rise at once; outrageous!
we gotta make money; that's why we're doing this.
I'd been stalling some guys because of the club...
they're interested in buying the premises...
to open a recreational center with games of chance.
a casino. - Kind of...
it's not Vegas. - You drunk?
you want to open a casino? - Why not!
they take over the debt, and they offer 200 jobs to club members.
local businesses are very happy
you can't do that, the statute clearly says...
it says the club is sold if members want it.
it also says that the money goes to charity
but the jobs are for members; call an assembly
members won't close down the club.
call an assembly and listen to the people. People want jobs!
look, I need a hand...
use the one you have in the cake.
are you calling me a crook?
don't get upset. - A crook?
don't you know me?
enough, dammit!
I can't stand your constant fighting.
if it's not the ball, it's Veronica or a ridiculous photo...
the club is not for sale,
we'll save it with honest work. Or we'll go to Court;
and if honesty, work and justice are not enough, we'll get a lawyer.
let's get to work.
that's why you dumped your lD card?
because of the photo? - I lost it.
Hi, love. - Hello.
no, don't drink.
just a little, - don't be mean, just to wet my lips. - I'll wet your lips.
have a good seat?
where will you be? - Backstage.
then my seat is bad, I can only see the front.
we're giving an award too.
basketball 1st pitched in; it wasn't much: so it's a catch-all award.
best teammate, best sportsman, best vibe and worst breath for the glorious Amadeo Grimberg.
Amadeo! Amadeo!
here, dad will give you something.
Eduardo.
Hi. - Hi, how are you?
what a surprise.
how are things? - Fine, great.
if you'd told me, we could've met somewhere quieter.
it's Brunito who called me. - Did he?
watch the phone bill, sweetie; mommy pays it.
I'm joking, don't get mad.
I'm happy to see you.
see how spiffy daddy looks.
that tie... And I'm all shabby...
we have a sweet 16 party afterwards.
Bruno can't make it. - Let's get going, honey.
Oh, yes, love. Well...
Graciela, Heidi; Heidi, Graciela.
looks great, huh?
so this is Heidi.
and you would be "Grandpa."
funny, isn't she?
see you on Thursday? - Sure...
what time? Where?
in court. The hearing...
Bye, champ, stay well.
Bye. - Bye.
up, up, up, up...
Hello, good evening, how are you? I'm Cristina, the dance teacher; we prepared this show with the giris, for you to see our work, and though they beat me to the punch
I want to dedicate it to Amadeo, my love.
well, you must be somewhere,
I don't know. Are you there?
no.
well, sure you're not out there?
the table at the back?
well,
lights, please?
yes?
well, bye, thank you.
two giris dancing together?
Yes, I thought it would be sexier.
dear, this is Andalusian!
didn't you ask me for Spanish music?
a Galician or Aragonese dance, not this.
well, this is it. It has life and sex.
I'll be right back.
you should get them into the box. - Yeah.
this is my dad, Yanina. - How are you?
pleased to meet you.
got a second? - Hold on.
dari, how's your mom doing?
what about you? - Me?
how are you?
fine. Perfect. - Sure?
Yeah, why?
why not come with me?
me? No. - Yes.
no, not me. - Come with me!
no. Not me. - Why? What have you got here?
what? Are you nuts?
maca, all of this... - What about all this?
anyone made it to 1st division?
the club's ruined your life.
what did you amount to?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - I understand.
no, I'm sorry.
it's different now, you can call, chat, the lnternet...
it's not like with Don Aquiles.
it's different.
very. The ones we send out know how to read and write.
Amadeo?
what are you doing? - Resting.
come on... You've been drinking.
I'll help you. - I got it!
come on. - Let go!
let go! Don't bust my balls!
what's wrong with you?
you're busting my balls.
what?
nothing, get lost.
what are you looking at?
get lost!
what's with you? - Go on, he's drunk.
I'm not drunk. What are you looking at?
what's she looking at?
what are you looking at? - I'm looking at you, you son of a bitch!
why can't I look at you? Let go!
I did the show for you, asshole!
don't look at me. - Can't I look at you?
you can't! - He's drunk.
I know! No kidding!
I'm not drunk.
I didn't want to be with you. - Don't look at me!
you're so stupid!
how is it...?
who can't handle love?
he's drunk, leave him.
well, - C'est tout. - One more.
give me that.
people mean well, but have no means.
I'll put this in the safe. - Here?
they might steal it in the bank.
don Aquiles, what was that story about the...
galician boys? You're about to tell it...
I've told it a million times, no.
it's a good story. - Tell it again.
tell it! Tell it!
three Galician boys were coming back from playing a soccer game, and the Chevy they're driving broke down, out in the country.
I've told this other times. - But it's nice!
I never knew about the Chevy.
while one of them fixed it, the others tried to play a match.
little by little, they got used to darkness...
and you could see perfectly, just perfectly.
and there they saw it, a full moon barely touching the horizon...
huge, yellow.
in Galicia, among the mountains, you could never see that, so much light.
by the end of the match we thought...
it'd be good to have a place like that, where there's always light, a permanent moon...
seems foolish...
why not that same place?
it seemed like magic.
you built the club on that field?
no, in the end they opened a mini...
Minimart... - Minimart, yes.
the moon was never seen again, but we founded our own club.
well.
I don't know how to change.
we should find out.
I'll do whatever you want.
do whatever you can.
what happened?
a little heart attack.
we were having mate, and look...
can I come in? - Go ahead.
don Aquiles.
Roman.
what a scare, huh?
could you open the window a little?
there are no windows.
I want to see the moon.
it's cloudy, you can't see it now.
then don't worry,
I won't die today.
of course not, man!
are people from the club here?
Yes, sure. Everybody.
what about mom?
don't leave her alone. Don't let me down now.
no, of course not.
open the window a little.
the moon is not out yet. - Better yet;
I can see it come out.
I'm cold.
I'm cold here.
Antonia was right...
the Russian had told me:
come with me..."
there, to lmmigration, so he could say he was my dad.
imagine me...
at 8, alone, well, with my brother Miguel,
I only spoke Galician, with a Russian father...
we were terrified.
the bald guy at Customs looked at the Russian and laughed.
the Russian laughed too.
he let us in out of pity.
can't you open the window?
please, open it a little.
if you see the bald guy, give him my thanks.
she's precious! She's changed my life. I went to my first meeting...
what meeting? - AA.
Really? Great, man! See, ...a woman's a woman. You'd never listen to me.
a- ma-zing, Roman. Did you know there'll always be better days and worse days?
so no matter what, today's an average day
get out.
so much happiness is hard to handle, man. They warm you about that too.
you look good. - Yeah, I feel...
stop, cool it a little.
but you look good, that's great.
I can't reach.
right on, basketball!
in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
our Father who art in Heaven...
what are you doing? - You asshole!
don't do that in a cemetery! - Are you stealing flowers?
Graciela took the ones I brought.
and they were for Cristina.
you giving her flowers from a tomb?
is it my fault if Don Aquiles dies at my best hour?
are you nuts? It's profane.
are you a tomb raider? - You have to seize the day.
one day at a time. One day at a time.
look, you need...
serenity to change what can be changed;
wisdom to accept...
what cannot be changed, and courage to change what...
no, valor, valor to change...
how was it?
get back on the wagon, moron.
really, change matters.
I'm rethinking a lot of things, my relationship to the club...
what do you have to rethink about it?
nothing...
I'm asking... Is the casino a bad idea or an opportunity?
hold it; you kidding? - It's just an idea...
you know, now...
that I've changed, I'm with the woman I love,
I can build something stable...
is it bad to want to improve?
you're mixing things up.
no, I mean... I don't know...
Alejandro said I could do maintenance work.
you talked to him? - Yeah, the other day.
it's a scam. They'll just toss a few crumbs your way
I can't change that, I can change my life... That's it:
wisdom to know the difference.
you're voting for selling.
I can't go on doing odd jobs...
I want to start a new life. What do I say? A life, for the first time.
I want to take care of what I have...
Cristina...
please, help me.
if you help me, - I'll help you. - How can you help me?
I don't want to, let's go, - get me out of here. - no, grow some balls.
hurry, before the cops come.
no, I can't. - No!
balls, man! Bet on life!
the lotto is better. She respects me little enough.
woman don't forget... - I know the lyrics.
then go!
woman, woman, don't forget he who went and sang for you...
what if she's with him?
better! Balls! Faith and balls!
woman, woman, don't forget he who went and sang for you...
on full moon nights by the gate his love...
and when remembering the troubadour's elegant song
a window opens and a
thank you is heard
cut it out, will you? Are you nuts?
sorry, we screwed up, let's go. - No.
bet on life, handle love!
Roman!
Yes, honey?
Oh, how nice.
let's go to the living-room. - Maca might hear us.
what's up with this serenade? - Amadeo's idea.
it was lovely. I liked it, - Me too, me too. - I loved hearing it.
but,
I don't want to go back to the same,
I want a deeper change...
are you okay?
I'm a little nauseous. - Have an anti-acid.
you've only one left. - I have a fresh pack.
Thanks.
things are not working with... - Don't say his name.
weren't you my best friend?
who told you that crap?
okay, if things are bad and you need to talk...
no, things are not bad. - I'd rather not talk then.
it's that...
no one taught me how to start a relationship at 40...
that should be taught at school!
look at you... This guy shows up, you shake, throw up, shit on your pants...
he's like the Eboli virus! Plus you throw away everything we've got...
what's everything we've got? - The house, the kids... -See? That's it!
I was scared when you found out, you'd go crazy...
you'd kill me or him, a bloodshed... I don't know what I dreamt of!
something more...
but you didn't kill me, no blood was spilt.
you did nothing. - What did you want me to do?
the house, the kids. The kids will leave.
did you talk to Dario? - What do you want me to tell him?
what do you want to tell him? What do you want to do?
what do you want, Roman?
see what's happening?
we want less and less; that's why we have less.
and we want less, have less, want less...
until we won't want or have anything!
the house is falling apart...
I want something more...
something...
I know things didn't turn out as we dreamt, but if we figure assets and liabilities, the balance...
what? My life's not a grocery store. How do you open this?
where have you been these 22 years? You never dressed as a belly dancer.
who pushed me into taking the cab job?
who busted my balls with bills, the house, the kids?
in any case, we built this together. I didn't decide on my own.
I didn't fail on my own.
and if I did...
and you stood next to me doing nothing to help me then you're one damned bitch.
we built this together, it wasn't just me.
show me a pole that isn't soapy - Leave that, you... - Shit!
you scared me! - What are you doing?
I'm working on the files...
almost had a heart attack.
what were you doing here?
what were you doing?
told you; the balance. I was just leaving.
I don't have a dime,
I'm desperate.
I don't know what to do, I've sold everything.
I'm sorry, I beg you, forgive me, Roman, I'm sorry.
easy. - Don't tell anyone.
Roman, - Don't tell Bruno... - No, calm down.
look at me. Promise me, don't tell Bruno, I'm begging you.
no, calm down a little.
I swear I was going to give it back.
I wrote it down, I was gonna give it back...
I know, calm down.
I'm a piece of shit. - No, listen,
listen to me...
I know who you are.
come on, calm down.
how much do you need? - No, it's ok...
let them cut my power off... For what one has to see...
are you living in the club? - Who cares?
and now you're getting evicted? - On top of it...
can you believe this guy?
he grew up in there, now he's convincing everyone to sell...
what bugs me most are the kids.
what will they do now?
and you.
me?
you always ask what'll happen to the kids...
but what will happen to you if the club's gone?
well, -...shall we go to sleep? - Let's.
see you. Sleep well. - You too.
what do you think?
about what? - What will they vote for?
I don't know...
people are such turds.
you sleep comfortably at the club?
sort of.
no, because...
I don't know...
Bruno is at my folks'...
if you want to stay over, you can take his bed.
no, never mind, don't bother. Thanks, anyway...
sure? Well...
Bye.
I love you.
fell like doing something? - Yes, yes.
for the club, I mean. - Yes, that too.
do you want to stay -...and talk? - If it's okay...
I mean, we gotta think of something...
it's fine with me. - Yes?
Yes, let's think of something.
you're strong, Roman.
you'll convince them. - What should I do?
I don't know, talk to them...
don't let them win, because we're not shit.
no, we're not.
the hell we are.
we have to fight.
Yeah.
you've got to be hard.
I'm a little nervous.
I mean with the people. - Oh, yeah.
we're good people, right?
Yeah, we're great. - We are.
I'm still hooked on the turd...
and I on the bitch.
OK, as long as that's clear.
people have been waiting long, we've got to begin.
how can we begin without Roman? He's the main board member
doesn't matter.
Emilio, hi. - Hi, how are you?
I'm coming to vote. - Are you a member?
Roman wouldn't have given me children if I weren't?
Emilio, I'm starting.
firstly, I'd like to thank Mr. Bengoa... - Sorry, Bengoa who?
the one who bought the textile plant to dismantle it?
my dad is one of the guys who got the sack. He sends you a message:
fuck you, creep!
don't talk to me like that!
about time, man! What were you doing?
we got stuck... - Come on!
even though we're not all here yet...
I'd like to go over the proposal.
well, about time.
look at him.
sorry, go on.
I was saying... it's very simple.
200 jobs for all club members;
three bars, two restaurants...
this is a great deal for us...
for Avellaneda.
200 jobs, money that will stay in Avella...
what are you looking at?
her name's Dalma.
I'd like to... - Raise your hand.
Roman has the floor.
for that, the club must be closed down.
no, no.
the club Don Aquiles founded no longer exists... I think...
we know what you think. I want to know what the members think.
can those in favor of selling raise your hand?
you want to vote now? - No.
I want to know what they think.
raise your hand. It's not binding.
what? - Raise your hand just to see.
well, let's see...
Amadeo's made a mistake. Put your hand down.
it's not a mistake.
are you stupid? Put your hand down!
43 in favor of selling, - Let's face reality. - Give the award back, man!
the gentleman has the floor.
I owned the butcher's shop on Mitre, remember?
I ought to sell 1, 200 kilos a week to go by;
at least 800 not to starve.
you know how much I was selling? 500. I had to sell.
the shop was named after my two daughters...
you know what it's called now?
laughing Cow lncorporated."
it's not funny.
when things aren't working, you have to sell.
your meat was shoe leather.
what? Look what he's saying!
when you get to know this, you fall in love, right?
Yes.
it's all right.
it's all right.
let's see, Andrea.
it's hard for me, because here my mom...
won 1st prize for her geisha costume...
and that's a memory I can't erase.
we're starving, honey! - No, let's not give up...
let's do another festival.
we did one and nobody came... I ate pastafrola for two weeks.
this argument is upsetting me very much.
we are hurting each other, attacking each other...
it's disturbing, it's hell on me.
so leave! - Shut up, asshole!
let's say we can pay off the debt...
how do we pay for the leaking roofs or the falling ceiling?
are we waiting for the roof to fall on a kid to remember reality exists?
cement is real. - I have a counterproposal.
it's something Graciela and I worked on.
this assembly was called to discuss my proposal. The statute says...
we are here to decide on the life of the club,
I don't give a fuck about the statute, much less about what you say
we may be few, the walls may be falling down, but they were built by thousands over 70 years;
at least for their sake, you'll listen.
wait! Come in, kids.
I want the kids to witness what we'll do.
this is an assembly! Minors can't be here.
they're old enough to face reality.
tell us... How much do you get for this casino deal? For real.
they'll take the club like they took everything else.
ignorant! I bring a solution and now it's my fault.
don't insult the kid 'cause I'll bust your ass.
just when we're about to become champions!
go, go! Basketball!
go, go! Basketball!
is that your dream?
is thatwhat worries you?
that's your dream!
see, Roman, why we need jobs?
so that we can all dream big-time once again, not 3 or 4 loud guys; everyone.
I have a dream.
that every creep like you go to jail, and have your asses sewn up with cooking string!
do something, man!
you wanted to sell!
let go! This is my club! I wanna vote!
you took the ball away, asshole!
I apologize for Amadeo.
Alejandro's right. The club can't go on like this.
we used to be 8, 000 members, and now, well, - you all know. - That's what I say.
we have less and less, we want less and less.
this cannot go on.
my proposal, our proposal, sorry, is to have 8, 000 members again...
so I propose we double the dues.
you want us to vote on that now?
no, let me finish.
we're 60 adult members, plus 200 minors and those who don't pay. We're 392.
if we make an effort...
and pay 10 pesos instead of 5, we can get 300 others in for free.
if out of those, we can make just 60...
to love the club and pay 10 pesos, we can have another 300; that's 1, 000.
if each one of those brings just one other person, we'll be 2, 000 in a year.
2, 000 people.
sure, how didn't I think about that before? I didn't see it, what an ass!
we shall overcome because we're good people.
Iike those e-mails, right? To one friend, then 10, 100; 1, 000 and suddenly...
it's 40 millions asking Bush not to wage war on lraq.
the glitch is Bush doesn't give a fuck about the 40 millions...
because reality is a little more complex...
and delusions solve nothing. - It's not a delusion!
that's how the club was built! - It's a delusion!
it's total polyanna and naive...
I'd even say dangerous because it'll lead us to disaster.
the club was built surrounded by factories, with people who worked...
and earned well. Today the neighborhood is a concrete cemetery - Things have changed! - Let them change again!
it was done before, it's been done for decades.
people came to the club...
to meet friends, to care about each other.
they lived in the club. That's it, living, not surviving, that's the key.
now...
they throw us a bone and you expect us to be happy? They're buying us!
Yes. They're buying all we've left to sell:
our ability to work. Nothing wrong with that.
let's vote now!
please...
I want to say something.
the club is built. It was left to us.
we can't even keep it going?
it's a good deal!
a good deal? - A good deal, yes.
what's wrong with a good deal?
it's good deals that get a country going, and not some stupid romanticism that got us broke.
what romanticism?
romanticism, stupid or otherwise, has been out of fashion for years. Romanticism didn't get us broke.
let's do business, then. But let's do it ourselves.
teach classes, grow a community garden, build something.
why not? Remember?
I'd come home and tell Vero: today I made 100 fridges.
what do I tell her now?
bank won, player lost. As always.
I understand Roman's position, but Alejandro's, if we flesh it out a bit, can be flashier.
think about Dalma. - That's it, Dalma.
it may sound foolish;
but she's got a place here.
it's not foolish. - Yes, it is...
I'm sorry, but it is, because many will miss a chance to work...
because one girl likes ballet...
as if she were a big star
I stand for the same thing you, and you and most of you do ...but rationally.
don't the dreams of 200 guys about to get jobs count?
200 guys who have a club but can't use it, 'cause they can't afford sneakers, or it rains on them. What do we tell these people?
guys, easy, stay jobless, rest easy. Don Aquiles smiles upon you from Heaven.
we have to get back our dignity.
you don't do that playing cards, or making bracelets, or jumping around in tutus.
you get back our dignity with work.
he's right.
he's right.
you're right.
he's right.
I can't say anything.
let me make one thing clear, though.
here,
Dalma is a little more than a big star.
she's happy here.
address the assembly - They already know...
they know, but what is that worth rationally?
what is it worth to meet a man like
don Aquiles?
or to be friends with Emilio?
surely not as much as the job you offer.
one more little thing. I don't know about you...
but I don't have to get back my dignity, because I haven't lost it yet.
I was close, I admit it, but not yet.
cause when out there I bought the idea of the job I then lost...
or the blender that burned out...
or the VCR that ended up boring me silly...
in here, I kept being the same guy, and I felt...
the best friend, the most admired, beloved, just like Dalma, and all of us.
and that must be worth something, right?
because I've learnt a lot lately. the hard way, grant it.
I've learnt I can live...
with no cable, video, movies, health insurance, security, new clothes, power, gas, perfume, but I can't live without my wife's admiration, or my son's... my children's...
I can't...
I can't.
let's vote now.
Yes. - Let's vote now!
I want to say one last thing:
200 jobs...
go fuck yourself
well, we've got...
26 votes against selling...
and 33 in favor.
Where's Roman?
Roman!
Roman!
hang on.
hang on, Roman! Hang on!
it's me! Hang on!
meet me half way, honey...
enough. - Go on.
no, that's it.
I learnt the phonetics. The rest is harder
so, Emilio?
sweetbreads coming? - Coming expensive.
make do with chitterlings, some meat and innards.
let's have a toast.
a toast to the kids' trip.
that's it. - I won't toast to that.
what?
I won't toast to that!
Emilio, don't burst their bubble!
all right, let's drink to something else.
I'm selling the house.
I won't toast to that, either.
what's with you?
what did you come for?
to make the barbecue.
I can leave. I'm not celebrating everybody's leaving.
you treat me like a traitor.
you go to Spain, sell the house... Want me to dance?
it's not so simple, Emilio.
do I have to pass a test?
after all we did for 33 assholes to wreck everything?
shall I keep banging my head against the wall?
tell me.
and the other 26? - What?
nothing...
26 people voted against it.
they should take care of themselves, like I do...
with my family.
that's how it is.
it's all right. If it's what you want to do...
it is what it is.
we'll talk later, ok?
there's nothing to talk about.
we can toast to my pregnancy, then.
you're pregnant?
by whom?
Congratulations.
that's good...
that's good.
come here, come here!
come here!
don't make me go there!
that one's broken, Roman!
there's another one in the garage.
hurry, you'll miss the plane.
LlFETlME MEMBER
we hereby certify that...
maldonado, Roman...
is a lifetime member of this club.
Hey! What happened?
your suitcase is crap... Go help Roman in the garage.
shall we go?
how do we build a new club?
well, we should find out.
let the dance go on...
the dance of my homeland
see the black folk dance to the beat of the tambourine
delicious. I don't know, I wanted...
to start a new page. Let bygones be bygones, that's why I invited you here;
it's the best place in town.
lt'll cost you a fortune. - No.
I have no credit card. - It's OK.
they cancelled it two months ago.
don't worry; I'm doing great with the French lessons.
if you need any money, you ask me.
no, I'll let you know, but not now.
I don't want you to be in need...
waiter, another creme brulee.
and another Dom Perignon.
let's shoot the works.
you embarrass me. - Why?
don't be silly.
give me a cigarette. - I just ran out.
well, I'll go get some.
you're not buying me cigarettes.
Yes, why not?
I want it to be une nuit memorable.
pour moi.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Mr. Eduardo? - Yes.
telephone call.
for me? - Yes, for you.
thank you.

let me tell you.
not everybody is cut out for a marathon.
he could die!
lf he fails to pace himself, his heart will explode!
you want him dead?
Damn!
let's go.
so you should teach him right!
l'm sorry. l won't bother you again.

Hello?
Cho-won's mom?
he's not ready yet.
he can't pace himself alone.
you can run with him as a pacemaker.
I've only ever met one man i wouldn't want to fight when i met him he was already the best cut man in the business started training and managing in the 60's, never lost his gift.
I need to look at him.
he's fine, he's fine.
even if you dont stop this bleeding I give you one more round.
seconds up, lets go.
wwhat do we do? tell me what to do.
maybe you got a severed vein, or you just cant get the cuagulant deep enough.
the're all kinds of combinations you come up against down in the different layers of meat and frankie knew how to work every one.
people love violence, they'll slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies, same people claim to love boxing, they got no idea what it is.
boxing is about respect, getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy.
I'll warm up the car.
mr dunn?
I owe you money?
no sir.
I know your momma?
dont really know sir.
what is it you want?
I was on the inner card, i won my fight too, maggie fitzgerald.
well maggie fitzgerald, what's up?
did you happen to see it?
Nope.
I did pretty good, thought you might be interested in training me.
I dont train girls.
maybe you should, people seen me fight say i'm pretty tough.
girlie, tough aint enough.
it's a mistake.
car should be able to back up frankie.
just push will you?
what did HOgan want?
offered us a title shot.
bout time.
I turned him down flat, 2 or 3 more fights and you'll be ready.
been 2, 3 more fights for a long time now frankie.
look Willie, you've one shot at the title, you lose, it may not come around again 2 or 3 more fights and you'll be ready.
if you say frankie.
Frankie liked to say that boxing was an unnatural act, that everything in boxing is backwards.
sometimes best way to deliver punches is step back.
well dO your best lord, protect katie... Annie too, other than that, you know what i want, there's no use repeating myself.
but step back too far, you aint fighting at home.
father that was a great sermon. Every week.
what's confusing you this week?
Oh same ol one god tree god thing.
Frankie, most people figure out by kindergarden it's about faith.
is it sorta like snap, crackle and pop all rolled up in one big box?
your standing outside my church comparing god to rice crispies?
the only reason you can romance at me is to wind me up, it's not gonna happen this morning.
well i'm confused.
no you aren't .
yes I am.
then here's your answer, there's one god, anything else cause i'm busy?
what about the Holy ghost?
he's an expression of god's love.
and Jesus?
son of god, dont play stupid.
but who is he then, does that make him demi god?
there are no demigods you fucking pagan.
did you write your daughter?
Absolutely.
now your lying to a priest.
you know what, take a day off, dont come to mass tomorrow.
some People say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart.
Frankie would say, show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and i'll show you a man waiting for a beating.
think i've only ever met one fighter who's all heart.
my name is Dangerous Dillard fighting flipo bam bam ... out of Broward county Texas.
dangerous showed up a couple years back, it comes to everything to LA with errilville,... new boyfriend, apparently errilville got lost, and ended up back in Texas.
danger looked for him, bout a week before he introduced himself.
Hey, you know, I gots nothing against niggers.
well that's nice to hear.
Yeah, yeah lots of people where i comes from does, but My momma taught me not to cause hurt to no man, niggers or not.
you got a nice momma, anything there is i can do for ya?
just one of those questions you ask. But danger wanted to give it his best answer.
well sir i'd likes to become the welter weight champion of the world, and i challenge the motor city cobra, thomas evan earns to fight me for the welter weight championship of the whole world.
yo flip shut up man, you aint even ranked.
you gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.
hey i'll fight any man any time.
hey you a bad man huh? hey come on get in the ring, go a round with me.
Sherrile, leave him alone.
danger, your going back to training.
will do miss graff.
oww

I Give you that ass whoopping later olive oil.
hey bro, Those pants look real pretty on you bro.
give his momma back her tights.
Sherrile , had a left hook that would move a tank but he had a heart the size of a split pea.
Frankie...pit from bobby malone 17yrs ago.
Bobby wanted to move to florida and frankie wanted some security.
Bobby died while he was packing.
Frankie found out.
most gyms lose money.
thought i told you i didn't want danger working out here anymore.
Oh he aint hurting nothing frankie.
but he's hurting me, making my heart watching him punch the air like it's gonna punch back.
how many times do i got to tell you that bleach is bleach.
why can't you just buy the cheap stuff, you always have to buy the expensive stuff.
it smells better frankie.
bleach smells like bleach.
hey scruff...
heya mr buda.
big willie,
nice fight.
thanks man.
wanna talk?
what the hell kind of language is that?
what do you want?
I just thought you might like to know you got a fighter out there not talking to another manager.
not talking to another manager?
and not just any manager, Mickie Mac
you came in here to tell me that Big willie is not talking to Mickie Mac?
not a word, neither one of them.
I'm trying to read here.
if you think that is more important.
who's your new girl?
what?
Jesus Christ.
she keeps hitting it like that she gonna break her wrists.
your wasting your time, I told you I dont train girls.
thought you might change your mind.
there's dozen of trainers who train girls, you wont have any trouble finding one.
won't hardly need a dozen boss, you'll do fine.
Dont' call me boss now, i'm not your boss, and dont you be calling me that.
Willie you ready to work?
anytime.
if i stop calling you boss will you train me?
no.
then I might as well just keep calling you it.
she came from southwestern missouri, the hills outside
set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.
she grew up knowing one thing, she was trash.
it's for my dog.
she'd come 1800 miles but the was still just over the hill.
working the bag boss.
I'm not your boss and that bag is working you.
give her money back.
you sure?
how much's she paid?
6 Months.
Christ, no dont be a smart ass now will ya, woman thinks i'm gonna throw away 6 months worth of dues just to get rid of her she's out of her mind, but just dont encourage her, understand?
what's danger doing out there? What's he looking at?
looks like a bottle of water.
he pay his dues?
dues? boy can't afford pants, you want him to pay dues?
get out of my office.
can't think it was the bag.
I'm not a trainer but i can show you this too.
I appreciate any help i can get.
what you wanna do is take it to the mat see, he's constantly moving, moving towards you, moving around ya, and moving away from ya.
alright, now you dont want to hit him when he's coming toward ya cause what he's gonna do is just push you back and is gonna smuggle your punches take you by , so you watch him real carefully, keep rotating, that keeps your head moving and keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire power shot, alright now go ahead now, good good, keep rotating, keep moving, that's it, good good, keep that chin tucked in, come around keep moving, keep moving, good ...
yeah?
give it a few shots, tuck that chin in, tuck that chin in, that's good, that's good now you get this down we'll put you on a speed bag?
you do have a speed bag?
I'll just borrow it til i can buy my own.
go on home now.
I'll walk out with you?
no i am home, see.
it's nice, would it bother you much if i worked a little longer?
just pull the door closed when you leave.
thank you.
if there's magic in boxing, its the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked rips, ruptured kidneys and detached raetna's.
it's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody see's but you.
hey flip, hey flippie come here man, i think i found somebody you can beat.
I dont fights women.
why not boot, it's perfect boot, cause you know why, cause she are you, you could fight to him and then you could kiss to him, and then you fight to him one more time.
it's beautiful man, it's like poetry.
it's like poetry.
you've been reading that shit.
thanks boss.
that's a girl man? I'll be damned flipper.
think your right.
look at them itty bitty titties, there like mosquito bites, man there's barely even a mouth full.

I'll give you a ride.
Oh i can't frankie, middle's got a piano lesson, i told Grace i'd drive.
Oh, something wrong with Grace's car?
she hates that car, wants the old one back but dealer wont do it, says he already got a buyer.
Oh well maybe i should talk to the dealer?
I'd appreciate that.
OK.
Thanks.

little girl tends to be coming along.
Yeah, almost like someones been helping her.

I wonder How the hell she got that.
I wonder.
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

yes that bag, that's my bag and if your hitting it people will think i'm training ya.
is that such a bad thing boss?
Yes, yes it is everytime you touch it your losing me business out here.
I Got it embarassing myself.
well I can't just lend it to anybody you know.
I understand.
look you seem like a nice girl, can i give you some advice?
I'd appreciate that.
your gonna find a trainer either in this gym or somewhere else that's gonna wanna train a girl, it's the latest freak show out there, but the only trouble is your gonna be they're wasting your time because your too old.
I dont feel that old.
well neither do I but you don't see me fighting 21 yr olds do ya, it takes about 4 years to train a fighter.
how old are you?
31, until my next birthday.
well there you go. 31.
you wouldn't start traing to be a ballerina at 31 now would ya?
already been working it for 3years.
and you can't hit a speed bag?
what kind of training is that?
never had any boss.
well i hate to say it but it shows. SOmebody's gotta be honest with ya.
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.
ya, well sorry for using your bag Mr dunn.
your not gonna cry now are ya?
no sir.
ya, Here, keep the god damn thing.
no you need it.
no take the bag, haven't seen it in 20yrs anyway.
I've had 3 since then, just uh, just enjoy it will ya?
I'll just borrow it till i buy my own.
just dont lose it.
I know HOgan, your guy's the champ so we dont split 50's but if i dont see 40%, look you call me back with 6040 or dont call me back at all.
hey Willie.
hey Frankie.
is something wrong?
I'm sorry to come on your house like this,
I know you dont like people dropping in.
Oh your not people Willie, your welcome anytime come on in.
I wanted to thank you for getting Grace's car back.
Oh you dont have to thank me. Paying an extra 1000 dollars for your own car is a favor.
Gracey broke down crying when she saw it.
Really?
I also needed to talk with you about business.
Oh yeah well i just got off the phone with Hogan, we're all set for september, everything but the splinter.
I gotta leave you Frankie.
what?
Willie the title is just 2 fights away.
it aint that, it's like you said, i got one shot, if i win i got to make as much i can while i can.
I need somebody in the action that can make things happen, and i got to make a change before the fight.
only way this guy said he'd take me is if he took me to the title.
so i get to the title fight, and this guy takes you there.
only way he'd do it, i'm sorry Frankie, i'm no longer waiting on a title, I wish you could have been with me.
Mickie mac's a business man, he can't teach ya nothing.
you already taught me everything I need to know.
there's some things people just dont wanna hear.
and I challenge the motor city cobra,
thomas Hitman Earns to fight me for the welter weight championship of the whole world.
danger, i'm wearing these mits for a reason.
just working on my foot work mr .
danger you through a punch you get the hell out of this gym.
danger, i want you thinking bout that punch i'll brb.
I'm, i'm thinking how i'm gonna hit it hard for ya mr .
no one had the heart to tell Danger Earns retired years ago.
heard about Willie, it's cold, it's dead cold, plus it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.
yeah well at least i can see through both eyes.
Mmmhmm didn't do you a lot good tho did it?
well i got the gym, dont need to be training fighters at my age.
Willie tell you why?
cause Mickie, mickie's got the connections.
it aint about connections frankie, it's about you not believing in him.
well I found him, I stuck with him for 8 years how's that for not believing in him.
you could have gotten him a title fight 2 years ago, now he knew that i'm amazed he stayed around this long.
yeah well getting there and taking home the belt are 2 different things.
what was i supposed to do, just put him in over his head, not protect him?
Oh you were protecting him from the championship?
yea.
well Now that makes sense.
well What about you scrap, what did your manager do?
you were a hell of a fighter, a lot better than Willie, he get you a title fight or .
did he just bust you out banging your head against other people's fist until you lost your eye?
I had my shot, I went out swinging and no man can say i didnt.
ya well i remember, and excuse me,
if I didn't want my fighter spending the 2nd half of his life cleanin up other people's spit.
ya right, like your the smart one, your the one learning greek.
it's galac.
well you just protected yourself out of a championship fight, how do you say that in galac.
boxing is an unnatural act, cause everything in it is backwards,
you wanna move to the left, you dont step left, you push on the right toe, to move right you use your left toe, instead of running from the pain like a sane person would do, you step into it.
everything in boxing is backwards.
cheeseburger?
you bought me a cheeseburger?
ya.
I never see you buy anybody a cheeseburger.
well i couldn't eat it, and i ordered it. You want it?
well I guess I plan go back to spending.
did you watch the fight?
yeah I watched it. Willie did good.
that's what you got to say?
Willie won didn't he? He did good.
so you been working on yourself, learning to open up that's good work.
you watch it?
yeah i got HBO.
how could you afford HBO? How long have i been telling you to save your money?
ever since i fought Louis typhoon johnson at the stadium club in tupulo mississippi.
that ?
yeah manager ran off, left you and me to hitch home, don't you remember nothing?
well I remember walking half way and thinking i was gonna be lynched.
I remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station.
yeah well i got a ride, the guy took off before i hardly closed the door, had to walk back 2 miles.
your conscience got the better of you that's why.
what the hells that?
it's her birthday.
your not breathing right, that's why your pantering.
so it's your birthday huh, how olds that make ya?
I'm 32 mr dunn, and i'm here celebrating the fact that i spend another year scraping dishes and waitressing which is what I've been doing since 13, and according to you i'll be 37 before i can even throw a decent punch which i have to work on this speed bag for a month god's simple truth.
other truth is, my brother's in prison, my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive, my daddies dead, and my momma weighs 312lbs.
if i was thinking straight i'd go back home, find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some oreos, problem is this the only thing i ever felt good doing.
if i'm too old for this then i got nothing.
that enough truth to see to you?
this your speed bag?
if yours behind the counter, wish i could say wheres it at
hold it, hold it, i'll show you a few things, and then we'll get you a trainer.
no sorry.
your in a position to be negotiate?
yes sir, because i know if you train me right i'm gonna be a champ, i've seen you looking at me.
yeah out of pitty.
Dont' you say that, dont you say that if it aint true.
I want a trainer, i dont want charity, and i dont want favors, if your not interested than i got more celebrating to do.
stop stop stop, god damnit stop.
what the hell are you doing?
OK, if i'm gonna take you on...
you wont never regret it.
look just listen to me... If i take you on...
I'll promise I'll work so hard.
God this is a mistake already.
Mmm mmm i'm listening boss.
if i take you on, you dont say anything, you dont question me, dont ask why, you dont say nigger something maybe yes frankie and i'm gonna try to forget the fact that your a girl.
it's all i ask.
and dont come crying to me if you get hurt. Alrighty.
we got a deal.
no not quite,
I'm gonna teach ya how to fight then we get you a manager and i'm off down the road.
well i hate to argue.
dont argue with me that's the only way we're doing it I teach you all you need to know and then you go off you make a million dollars,
I dont care, get your teeth knocked out, i dont care,
I dont wanna hear about it either way, that's just the way its gonna be, its the only way i'll do it.
all right,
now one of the things i've noticed around the gym is you never move your feet.
you stand there just flat footed.
you gotta move your feet, that's one of the best things i'm gonna be able to teach ya.
so here's what you do,
you get yourself, bend your knees, get in an athletic position, look like your gonna hit something.
move em how boss?
just go hit the bag.
stop.
what i do wrong?
OK You did two things wrong.
1 is you asked a question and 2 is you asked another question.
now What i want you to do is not about hitting it hard, is how good you hit it.
so watch me, and you can count with me if you want, just count on a one count.
can you show me that again?
just say one please.
one.
OK one.
one.
OK Yeah just say one, thats good that's good, then i move over to my right foot, you see my weight is shifting to my right foot then i hit it with the back of my hands, thin ice, thin ice pick then i come over and i shift to my left foot, and i hit it with my right hand, ice picking it again...
just do it like that, keep practicing.
you show em how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.
to make a fighter, you gotta strip em down to bare wood.
you can't just tell em to forget everything you know, you gotta make them forget it in their bones.
make em so tired they only listen to you, only hear your voice, only do what you say and nothing else.
show em how to keep their balance and take it away from the other guy.
how to generate momentum off your right toe and how to flex your knees when fire a jab.
how to fight backin up so the other guy doesn't wanna come after ya, then you gotta show em all over again, over and over and over til they think they were born that way.
think i'm ready for a fight boss?
Hey, come here.
your not breathing.
hate to disagree with you.
everytime you get into pressure your holding your breath, now stop doing that.
OK, but other than that i'm doing pretty good right?
I mean for a girl.
I dont train girls.
think i might be ready for a fight boss?
you get a manager and we'll find out wont we.
I'd like to but you been keeping me too busy.
you got any family boss?
what?
you spending all this time with me I didn't know if you had any?
no, well i got a daughter, katie.
that's family.
we're not exactly close.
how much she weigh?
what?
trouble in my family comes by the pound.
Yeah, not very big, used to be real athletic, dont know if she kept it up.
so what do you think, Im ready for a fight?
hey Sally, come here for a minute will ya?
Frankie i need to see you in the back for a minute ok?
can i see you a minute?
Sally here is a real good manager, has a couple of golden glove boys, looking for a girl sally?
well Looking for a good one.
see there you go.
nice working with you girlie.
what you want?
nothing.
my my, i've been watching you work, you got a hell of a left.
thank you.
so You wanna give this a try see if it's a fit?
yeah sure.
good, cause i think your ready for a fight.
what am i doing wrong Sally? everytime Im gettin on me.
your doing great, your wearing her down, just keep punching.
I aint doing great, i'm losing.
your wearing her down.
nice night aint it?
Jesus Christ.
that's washington's girl, hell of a fighter, 11-0.
your lefts, keep your left up.
has a lot of good fighters, gots julia lightweight champ.
your left damnit.
wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight but Sally's a good manager, must think she can take her.
Jesus age, your left, keep your left up.
you thinks she can hear you from back here?
course if maggie loses, wouldn't mean a thing to Sally, might even help him on his card gets another win,
Lonnie might let Sally lightweight fight julia for the title.
Sally's trying to set a fight with julia?
hey what do i know, i just come cause i enjoy the fights.
my god.
hey come here, come here, your dropping your left hand, quit dropping your left hand.
hey frankie do you mind not talking to my fighter?
your doing a hell of a job of it sally, is this the way you advise your lightweight?
dunn, what the hell are you doing?
I'm talking, what you doing?
is this your fighter?
it's my fighter.
it aint fitting real well sally.
fine, you take her, she can't fight worth a shit anyway.
somebody tell me what's going on.
look I was late, Sally was just subbin for me.
you telilng me that this is your fighter?
yeah this is my fighter.
then you got 10 seconds.
OK, and then i throw a punch and it keeps dropping.
let it drop.
that'd be a lot easier.
she thinks she knows you that's all, everytime you drop it she comes right over the top, so you just wait for her you see, that's all she's thinkin about, and When she cocks that big right hand do ya hear me?
I hear ya boss.
when she does you step to the side, come over wit a goodnight hook. YOu got one?
got it right here.
fighter i'm calling it.
OK, go give it to her.
the body knows what fighters dont, how to protect itself.
a neck can only twist so far, twist it just a hair more and the body says hey i'll take it from here, cuz obviously you dont know what your doing.
neutral corner.
see the way she did that? Sugar ray would do that. Girls got sugar.
lie down now, rest and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses.
it's called a knock out mechanism.
Dont' get carried away now.
you uh, you forgot the rule, now what is the rule?
keep my left up?
is To protect yourself at all times.
now what is the rule?
protect myself at all times.
good good.
you gave me away how is that protecting me?
it wasn't.
it's ok, i'll work on my left boss.
drink your water.
other than that how'd i do?
fine, you did fine.
you gonna leave me again?
never, that place you worked today, have homemade lemon moran pie?
sure.
not the kind with the canned filling crap.
big can, yaaa size, says homemade on the label.
I want you to take the weekend off.
it's only thursday.
you gonna argue with me?
know better than do that boss.
well... good.
all fighters are pig headed someway or another, some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something.
can you uh spare a few minutes for the immaculate conception?
truth is, even if they're wrong, even if that one thing is gonna be the ruin of them, if you can beat that last bet out of them, then they aint fighters at all.
thought i said see you monday?
you Sure did boss.
was last night.
you said not to argue with ya.
damn woman wont do a thing i tell her.
want my advice?
what?
where are your shoes?
there in a feet.
you got big holes in your socks.
there only not that big.
didn't i give you money for some new ones?
these are my sleeping socks, my feet like a little air at night.
how come you are wearing them in the day time then?
cause my daytime socks got too many holes in them.
well if i give you some more money buy some new socks, please?
well i'd be tempted but, i couldn't say for sure, might find it's way to the track.
didn't take maggie long to hit a strive.
I've got the breathing thing down.
nah you aint breathing right, cuz your knocking them down in the first round, that's what.
I thought that was the point.
the point is to get good, you can't get good if you keep knockin em out in the first round, how am i gonna get you fights?
nobody wants to see their fighter embarrased.
why am i still doing 4 rounders box?
cause you haven't got the lungs for 6 rounds, that's why.
I do if i keep knocking em out the first round.
Frankie made her fight one more 4 rounder, just to let her know who was boss.
sorry boss.
Maggie left no doubt about it.
the first 6 rounder didn't go quite as smooth.
Maggie didn't knock her out til the end of the first round, after that no manager wanted to put his fighter in with maggie.
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get a decent fights.
sweeting the purse by paying managers on the side.
that only worked for so long, then frankie did something he hated doing, he took a chance.
he moved her up in class, that could have been a mistake.
damn, Damn, Damn, 2 seconds will ya, just 2 seconds. Your nose is broke.
dang, fix it.
I can't, i can't.
you can fix it.
I can't, i've gotta call it.
I've seen what you can do, fix it.
look i can snap it back into place but i can't stop the bleeding, the ring doctor's gonna call it.
please Frankie please stop the blood i can beat her.
by doing this.
inhale, inhale, breath in.
OK huh?
yeah it's okay.
alright You got 20 seconds before this turns into a geiser and it's gonna spray all over the front row.
20 seconds that's all you got, now get going.
what ya reading?
what she saying?
wants to know what your reading.
its Yates, keep your head back.
why won't ya talk a little yates to her, show her what a treat that is.
when the hell they gonna get to her?
I'm ok frankie.
what you learn tonight?
always protect myself.
whats the rule?
always protect myself.
margret Fitgerald?
here.
I'll be right here.
how you doing?
me?
yeah you.
I'm not the one who's hurt.
broken noise dont hurt that much.
why you telling me that?
no reason.
but some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone, and no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.
did you write your daughter?
every week.
I've no idea why you come to church.
get it together Teddy!
get it together!
it's just water.
it's a lot of water
come on.
you okay boss? -Yeah, i'm just...i just can't
I just can not stand on water.
you're my new partner? - That's right.
not the best way to know you half head in the toilet.
doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels: the man of legend, I'll give you that the Legend?
what the hell are you boys smoking out there in Portland anyway?
Seatle.
I came from the office in Seatle.
how long have you been with Marshals?
four years.
what about you? got a girl? Married?
I was.
she died.
Jesus ...Boss, i didn't... - don't worry .
there was a fire in our apartment building, while i was out.
four People died.
it was the smoke that got her not the fire - That's important. - I'm sorry.
where are my goddamn Cigars?
I have, have one of mine
I could swear that I have the clothes when I boarded.
government employees, rob you blind thanks
have you received any briefing about the institution befor you left?
all I know is it's a mental hospital
for the criminally insane.
well, if it was just folks hearing voices and chasing butterflies, i guess they wouldn, t need us - that's where we're headed? - Yap.
the other side of the island is rock bluffs all to ended in water
the dock, it's the only way on, or off we will casting off again as soon as you two are ashore i'd appreciate if you two hurry about it - Why? - Storm's coming.
I've never seen a marshal badge before.
I'm Deputy warden McPherson, gentlemen.
welcome to Shutter Island. I'll be taking you up to Ashecliffe.
your boys seem a little on edge Mr McPherson
right now, Marshal. We all are "Remember us for we too have lived, loved and laughed
electrified perimeter.
how you know?
I've seen something like it before.
all right. you gentelman will be accorded all the help we can offer.
but during the stay you will obey protocol, do you understand?
Absolutely.
the red brick bulding on my right is ward A, the male ward
ward B the female ward, is one on the left
ward C is that building on the bluffs
the most dangerous patients are there
admittance to ward C is forbidden without the written consent and physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly
is that understood?
you act like insanity is catching
you are hereby required to surrending your firearms
mr McPherson, We are duly apointed federal marshals we are required to carry our firearms at all times
executive order 319 of the Fedral Code of Penitentiaries states that when stays at Penitentiaries the office head of institutions has the final authority.
gentlemen, you will not be allowed to pass through the gate with your firearms ok, well that does for the official stuff, come on boys
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?
so when did she escaped? the prisoner?
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation
protocol.
Correctional officers at a mental institution that's a weired sight, if you don't mind me saying
it's the only pursuit of it's kind in the U. S
even in the world. We care only the most periculo and patients.
most of the other hospitals can not deal. And all because of Dr. Cawley.
it created something really unique here. Hospital, people who deal ...
ID's, gentlemen.
badges, gentlemen.
Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times - By Scotland Yard, MI 5, OSS ... - Why?
what do you mean?
why the intelligence agencies want to consult a psychatrist about?
I guess you'll have to ask him - Marshall Daniels. - I am Ted.
Marshall Aule.
thank you deputy warden, that will be all - Yes, sir.
pleasure, gentlemen.
he sure had a lot to say about you
McPherson is a good man. he believe in the work they do here.
and what would that be exactly?
a moral fusion between law and order and clinical care
pardon me Dr... a what between what and what?
these paintings are quite accurate.
it used to be that kind of patients we deal with here shackled and left in their own filth they were beaten as they put bloody drove screws into their brain, and submerged them into icy water to lose their consciousness
or even drown.
and now? - we treat them.
trying to heal, to cure.
and if this fails, we at least provide them with a measure of calm in their lives.
these are ...all violent offenders, right?
they've hurt people.
murdered them in some cases. - In almost all cases. Yes.
then personally Doctor, I'd have to say... screw their sense of calm.
it's my job to treat my patients not theire victims. I'm not here to judge.
so this female prisoner ... - Patient.
excuse me, patient. one Solando Rachel, - Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours. - Last night.
between 10 and midnight - Is she considered dangerous? - You could say that.
she killed all three of her children.
she drowned them in the lake behind the house.
she took them out one by one and held their head in water until drowned.
then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table and ate a meal before a neighbor dropped by.
what about her husband?
he died. On the beaches of Normandy. she is a poor widow.
she starved herself when first she came here she insist the children weren't dead - Sorry Dr wouldn't happen to have some aspirin? - Prone to headaches marshal
sometimes, but today ...
more prone to seasickness. -Ah, Dehydration ...
you allright boss? - Yes.
in that case you're quite right Simpler the better.
thank you so much
Rachel still believe her children are alived.
also thought that this is her home of Berckshires.
you are kidding.
in four years acknowldge that she is in an institution
she believe we're all ...
deliveryman Milkman, postal workers.
to sustain the Illusion that her children never died she created an elaborate fictional structure she gives us all parts to play in that fiction - so you searched the ground yet? - the warden and his man scoured the island, not a trace.
what's more disturbing, is that we don't know how she got out of her room.
it was locked from the outside and the only window is barred.
it's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.
brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in
I came back for midnight rounde and she was gone
seriously doctor, how is it possible the truth never gets through her?
she is in an institution mental illness, right?
seems like something you'de notice from time to time - How many pairs of shoes get patientsi? - Two pairs.
sanity is not a choice, marshal,
you can't just choode to get over it
so ... she left here barefoot?
come on Doc, she can't get ten yard in this terrain.
Marshall?
the law of 4. Who's 67?
that's definitely Rachel's Handwriting
I have no idea what the " law of 4" is, though - Not a psychiatric term?
I'm afraid not.
who's 67?
fuck if I know!
I'de have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion
so you think it's just random scribblings?
no, not at all. Rachel is smart . brilliant in fact.
this paper that could be important. - Excuse me Doctor, but ...
we need to hold onto this. - of course
the departure had to come through here.
after lights out, the orderlies play card in here
last night there were 7 man sitting at the base of the atairs playing stud poker
and yet somehow, Rachel has managed to slip by.
Why?
how? She turns invisible?
doctor, we need access to personal files of all medical staff of nurses, guards, orderlies - Everyone who worked here. - we take your request under consideration.
this is not a request, Doctor.
this is a federal facility and a dangerous prisoner ...
patient. - Patient ...
has escaped now. You can comply ... - All I can say is that I will see what I can do.
doctor, we'll need to speak with the staff, do you understand?
I'll assemble them in the common room after dinner.
if you have any further questions feel free to join the dwputy warden in the search
it's 11 miles to the nearest land and the water is freesing
the current was strong last night. the tide pushing in
she's have drowned or been crushed on the rocks, her body would have washed back onshore.
those caves down ther, have you checked them?
no way she could get there.
the base of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac and a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick.
you said it yourself marshall, she's got no shoes
all right, boys! Let's check the other side!
what's that tower? - An old lighthouse.
the quards already searching inside it.
what's in there? more patients? - sewage treatment facility.
it will be dark soon.
I'm calling this off for the night
let's go, boys!
you were watching the land, right? - Yes.
can't no one get in or out of their room in that corridor without me seeing
all right, Rachel Solando, who else does she had to pass to get down here?
me.
sir, I saw nothing. - And you were at your post all night?
Yes. But I saw nothing.
tell me the truth.
I'm really ... went to the bathroom.
what? You breached protocols? Christ ... - I was away only one minutes.
all right, I do not know what to expect here. Let's back up.
Mrs. Solando was put in her room for lights out.
does anybody knows what did she do before taht?
anyone?
come on, anyone. anyone anyone she was in a group therapy session
did anything unusual occur?
defines "unusual."
excuse me! - It's a mental institution, marshall, for criminally insane.
usual," isn't a big part of our day.
I will rephrase.
did anything happened last night during and group therapy, that was more...
let's Say, more memorable than ... - Normal?
Exactly!
no. I'm sorry.
did Mrs. Solando said anything during group therapy?
she was worried about the rain.
and she hates the food here.
complained constantly. Last night including
so ... you were there in the presence of a doctor?
Dr. Sheehan led discuses.
Dr. Sheehan?
Yes. He was running the session.
he's Rachels's primary
the psychaiatrist who directly oversees her care.
we'll need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
he left on the ferry in this morning His vacation was already planned.
he'd putting it off too long
you're in a state of lockdown.
a dangerous patient has escaped and you let her primary doctor leave on vacation?
of course, he's a doctor
do you have the phone number for where he's gone?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
is anyone there?
I'm sorry sir, but it all down. All the lines.
the storm's hitting the mainland as a hammer.
if you get it working come find me immediately. the marshalls need to make an important call
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar at my house around 9
if you like to drop by
good, we can talk then, right?
we have been talking, marshall.
gotta say, i'm thinking I went into the wrong line of public service
it is a little overwhelming. it was constructed during the civil war
the same time as the military fort houses, ward C
this building is the original commander's quarters It cost a fortune when uncle sam got the bill the commander was courtmartialed
I can see why
nice music. who's that? Brahms?
no.
it's Mahler.
quite right, marshall.
forgive me, gentlemen ... My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.
quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor.
your poison, gentlemen? - Rye, if you've got it.
soda and ice please, thanks
you don't indulge in alcohol?
I am surprised.
isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?
common enough. and yours?
I'm sorry? - your profession, doctor psychiatry ...
I've always heared it's overrun with booceys and drunks
not that i've noticed.
what's it? Cold tea in your glass?
excellent marshall.
you have outstanding defense mechanism.
you must be quite adapt at interrogation.
men like you ... are my specialty.
men of violence.
that's a hell of assumption to make...
no assumption. Not at all. you misunderstand me, I said you are men of violence
I'm not accusing you of being violent man It's quite different
please, please, edify us, Doc.
you both served overseas
not much of a stretch, Doc. for all you know, we were both paper pushers over there
no, you were not.
since the schoolyard, I would bet neither of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict
not to suggest you enjoy it but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option
wasn't raised to run doc
Ah, yes... Raised and who raised you, marshall?
me?
wolves.
very impressive defense mechanism.
do you believe in God, marshall?
I'm quite serious
that's rubbish.
have you ever seen ... a death camp, Doctor?
I have, I was there, for the liberation of Daqhau ?
your English is very good, almost clawless
your English is very good. You hit the consonants a tad hard, though
you're German?
is legal immigration a crime, marshall? - Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.
listen, we need the files of Sheehan and on the rest of staff as well
no such file will be released for you. Period.
we gonna need those files. - out of the question.
bullshit, there is no question. bullshit.
anyway, who is in charge here? huh?
dr Naehring is the liaison to our board of overseas.
he relayed your request and it's been refused.
refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither you, sir.
Marshall, continues your investigation and we will do all we can to help.
this investigation is over.
we will file our reports and handle it over ...
hoover's boys. - Hoover's boys, that's right.
we'll take the ferry back in the morning.
come on, Chuck
nice night.
you're bunking in the orderlies quarter.
hey boss? ... we really gonna pack it in?
Why?
I guess, i dunno, i just... never quit anything before.
we haven't heared the truth once yet Chuck
Rachel Solando did not slipped out of a locked room barefoot without any help.
I'm beginning to think alot of help
maybe Cawley sitting up in his mansion right now, rethinking his whole attitudes - Maybe in the morning... - You're bluffing?
I didn't said that.
I found a whole stock of these, Teddy.
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?
I killed alot of people in the war.
is that why you drink?
are you real?
no.
she's still here.
who?
she never left.
remember when we stayed at the cabin by the lake ?
we were so happy
she's here.
you can't leave
I'm not gonna leave.
I love you so much.
I am the bones in a box, Teddy. - No.
I am
you have to wake up.
I won't go.
you're here.
I'm not.
you have to face that.
but she is and so is he
who?
I have to go.
No! please... don't -Just a little longer. - Oh, Teddy ...
let me go.
I can not.
ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit
doctor.
doctor, Doctor.
we need to interview the patients who were in Rachel's group therapy that night
I thought your investigation was finished?
it's not like we can take the ferry and was Rachel recieving any other treatment for her illnesses?
do you know what the state of mental health field in these days, gentelmen?
no. We are not doctors.
war.
the old schools believes in surgical interventions
psychosurgery. The procedures are that the orbital lobotomy.
some say that patientsi are reasonable, Other essential say become zombies.
and the new school? - Psycho pharmacology.
a new drug has just been approved of autorities.
that relaxes psychotic patients some would say tames then - And which school are you in, Doc? - I?
I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient with respect and listen to him
trying to understand. you just might reach him.
these pacients? - My point is.
what should be the last resort, becomes the first response.
give them a pill and put them in a corner, and it all goes away.
Rachel Solando was a on a combination of drugs meant to keep her from becoming violent and it was only intermittently effective
the greatest obstacle to her recovery was her refusal to face what she had done "was.
is there a reason why you refer to your patint in the past tense, Doctor?
look outside, marshall.
why do you think?
next one is Peter Breen. Assaulted his father's nurse with a brocken glass.
nurse survived, but her face permaanently disfigured i can't wait.
she smiles at me. She was so sweet
but ... I could read in his eyes. she liked to be naked.
liked to suck cock
all right, Mr Breen.
and asked me if she can have a glass of water
alone in the kitchen? like that's no big deal?
why was that a big deal? - It was obvious.
she wanted me to pull out my thing so she could laugh at it
mr Breen, we need to ask you some questions, okay?
when I cut her she screamed
but ...
she scared me.
what did she expect?
interesting.
but we are here to talk Rachel Solando, OK?
did you know she had drown her own kids?
she drowned her kids
this is a sick fucking world we live in. i'll tell you that ...
they should be gassed all of them... the retards, killers the niggers, kill your own kids? gas the bitch
please. stop that?
a nurse? - Please. Stop that.
a nurse maybe. maybe she had kids.
a husband ...
trying to make ends meet, to have a normal life ...
assisting your father...
you tore her face off, didn't you
congratulations, no more normal for her, not ever again
do you know what she was afraid of?
you.
could you stop that, please?
stop that!
please ... stops!
you know a patient by the name Andrew Laeddis? - No! No!
I want to go back.
I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure I should
excuse me for saying it, - Miss Kearns ... - God.
Mrs. Kearns.
but you seem ...quite normal, ...
I mean in comparison with the other patients here
well, I have my dark days I suppose everyone does
differents is that most people don't kill their husbands with an axe
although personally I think if a man beats you and fuck half the women he sees and no one will help you axing him isn't the least understandable thing you can do
maybe you shouldn't get out.
and what would i do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore. They say there are bombs that can turn whole cities to ash
and what do they call "television" ...
voices and faces coming from a box
I hear enough voices already
what can you tell us about rachel?
no much, she... she keep to herself
she believes her kids were alive
she thought she was still living in Berkshire and we were all neighbours - milkman, postman - deliveryman,
dr Sheehan was there that night?
Yes.
he talked about anger.
tell me about him ...
what's he like?
I think e. .
OK... nice
not hard on the eyes just my mother would say
did he ever come passing you?
no.
no, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he wouldn't ...
could I have a glass of water, please?
no problem.
thank you, marshall.
I have just one more question Mrs. Kearns.
did you ever meet a patient named Andrew Laeddis?
no.
never heard of him.
she was coached
he used the same words as Cawley's and the nurse.
it's like she'd been told exactly what to say. - Who is Andrew Laeddis?
you asked every one of those patients about him. Who's he?
what the hell, boss, I'm your partner for the God's sake!
we just met, Chuck.
there are the job long.
you got a duty, a career and what i'm doing not exactly by the book.
I don't give a damn about the book, boss But I need to know what the hell is going on
when this case came over the wires, - I requested it. Specifically, do you understand? - Why?
he was the maintenance man in the apartment building where my wife and I lived
okay.
he was also a firebug.
andrew Laeddis lit the match, that caused the fire that killed my wife.
what happened with Laeddis?
got away. Laeddis got away and disappeared.
about a year ago I opened the newspaper and there he is.
he's an ugly son of a bitch.
he had a new scar in the right temple down to his left lip.
eyes different colors. not a type of face you forget.
he'd burned a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.
he said voices told him to do that.
first he was sent to prison and then he was transferred here.
then what? - Then, nothing.
he vanished like he never existed no records forever
I'm sure he's not in ward B that leaves ward C.
or he could be dead.
so could Rachel Solando. Lots of places to hide a body here only one place where no one really knows the patient , Bridget Kearne, when she sent me for water, she said something back to you, didn't she?
no.
come on boss!
she wrote it.
run .
boss!
we must get inside. It's turning into fucking Kansas out here...
all right. Now. Let's go!
watch out!
Jesus!
come on! Let's go back!
Jesus Christ! damn it!
are you okay boss? - Yes. that's all right.
so ... you think Laeddis is here ...
what are you going to do boss?
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.
if it were my wife I'd kill him twice.
when we got through the gates of Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.
the commander tried to kill himself before we got there ...
but he botched it took him an hour to die
when I went outside, I saw bodies on the ground.
too many to count too many to imagine.
so yeah
the guards surrendered, we took, their guns, lined them up ...
I wasn't warfair, it was murder.
I'm tired of killing.
that's not why I'm here
so what is it all about?
after Laeddis vanished,
I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe.
lot of people knew about this place, but no one wants to talk ...
like they're scared of something you know this place is funded by special grants from the house of American activities Committee .
great. And how exactly are we fighting the countries from an island in Boston Harbor?
by conducting experiments on the mind at least that's my guess
and you think thats going on in here?
as I said, nobody's talking, right?
until I found someone who used to be a patient here.
guy's name George Noyce.
nice college kid. Socialist.
he got an offer to get some money for some psych study. Guess what they were testing.
drug tests. - He started seeing dragons everywhere.
almost beat his proffesor to death End up appearing in Ashecliffe.
ward C.
they released him after 1 year, right? What does he do?
two weeks on a mainland he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death
his lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce ...
stands up in the courtroom and he begs the judge, for the electric chair, anywhere but not a mental hospital.
judge give him life in the Dedham prison.
and you have you found him? - Yes, I've found him.
he's a mess
but it is pretty clear from what he tells me, they're experimenting on people here.
I do not know, boss.
I don not believe a crazy - That's the beauty of it.
crazy people are a perfect subject. they talk, but nobody listened.
I stood in Dachau.
we saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right?
for Christ sake we fought a goddamn war to stop them, and now find out it may be happening here?
on our land? No.
what are you really here to do, Teddy?
I'm here to get the proof.
I'm gonna go back and blow the lid off this place.
that's it wait a minute.
you started asking around about Ashecliffe.
waiting for a chance to get out here then suddenly they need a US marshall?
I got lucky, A patient escaped, it was the perfect excuse.
no, no, no boss. Luck doesn't work that way.
the world doesn't work that way. They got electric fence around a septic facility.
ward C is inside a Civil War fort?
a chief of staff with ties to the SS Funding from HUAC?
Jesus Christ! Everything in this place stinks government ops
what If they wanted you here? - bullshit.
ask questions. - Nonsense.
bullshit? Where is Rachel Soalndo? Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?
I had to know where that will give me any. In any case...
while you were looking at that neighbourhood, they're looking at you
all they need to do is making a fake escape to get you here
and now they have you. they have us both, here, now.
Marshall, are you here?
please signal us, this is deputy warden McPherson.
Marshall!
how about that? They found us.
it's an island, boss. They'll always find us.
I know you are in there ...
we get out of this fucking island. You and me.
come on!
come on! - Go!
get dry off Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!
and hurry up, this thing is transforming to a goddamn hurricane!
I dopped those suits to be cleaned.
it should be ready by tomorrow.
if we don't all wash away first speaking of which, I'm afraid your smoke were pretty much done for
so ...
it's our only choice, right?
that's something really nice in prison already that ...
now that you mention it, it is just fine.
that's why i must repeat my insistence that all ward C patients be placed in manual restrains,
if the facility floods, they'll drown you know that - That would take a lot of flooding. - We are on an island, in the middle of the ocean, during a hurricane.
a lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility
it's a gamble, Steven. say the power fails there's a backup generators.
and if that goes? The cell doors will open
where are they to go?
they can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland over a weak havoc.
you're right. Probably responsible recovery right here on us.
if they're manacled to the floor, they die 24 human beings.
you can't live with that, can you?
frankly, if it were up to me , I'd put all 42 in ward A and B in manual restrains as well
excuse me Excuse me - marshall. - I'm sorry, I have one quick question.
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.
when we spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note the law of 4, I loved that.
you told me you had no idea what that second line could refer to
who's 67?
Yes, I'm afraid I still do not know. None of us knows.
nothing comes to mind.
nothing?
because I believed I just heard you say that there are 24 patients in ward C.
and 42 of patients, in wards A and B which would mean there are 66 patients here in this facility
that's correct, yes.
then it seems that Rachel Solando was suggesting you have a 67th paient, doctor - But I'm afraid we don't. - This Is ridiculous.
what are you doing here? - We are doing our goddamn job.
didn't McPherson tell you the good news?
no, what's the good news, doctor?
Rachel has been found.
it's here.
safe and sound
there is not a mark on her.
who are these men?
why are they in my home?
police officers, Rachel.
they ... have a few questions.
ma'am.
there's been a sighting of a known Communist subversive in this area passing out literature
here?
in this neighborhood?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
if you have tell us what you have done yesterday, where you were, it'll help us narrow our search.
yes ...
well, I ...
I made breakfast for Jim and the children, and then I ...
I packed Jim's lunch and he left.
then I sent the children off to school.
and then ...
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.
I see...
and after that?
after that ...
I thought of you.
I ... I'm sorry, ma'am.
I do not know what you talking about.
don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?
you're gone ...
you're dead.
I cry every night.
how am I supposed to survive?
God.
Rachel ... it will be all right.
I'm so sorry, but ...
everything will be all right? Okay?
I buried you
I buried an empty basket . your body was nothing but blood and chunke of..., eaten by sharks.
my Jim is dead, So who the fuck are you?
who the fuck are you?
who are you? Who are you?
I'm sorry about that
I didn't wanted to interrupt, I thought she might tell you something, but ...
we found her down by the lighthouse, skipping stones.
we have no idea how she get there. I'm going to ask you both to go down into basement.
we have food, water, and cots . it's the safest place to be when the hurricane hits.
are you all right? You look pale.
I'm fine, it's just ...
boss, are you okay?
it's so goddamn bright? isn't it?
photo sensitivity, headaches sometime? Marshal are you having migraine?
Yeah, right.
take these, marshall. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as bell.
you have a migraine. Imagine someone sawed open your head and filled it with razors then shook it as hard as they could
take these pills, marshall.
no ... not want. - It'll stop the pain. Take pills.
you'll need to lay down carefull. All right.
gonna be okay. Relax.
who is that? - He?
that's the warden.
do not worry about him, allright?
looks like ex-military prick.
you know I can not argue with you onthat.
you should have saved me.
you should have saved all of us.
hey buddy ...
Yes.
Hi, buddy.
no hard feelings, right?
no hard feelings.
little something for later.
I know how much you need it.
clock's ticking, my friend.
Wer're running out of time.
give me a hand here.
I could get in trouble.
I'm dead?
I'm so sorry.
why did not you saved me?
I tried, I wanted to, but by the time I got there, it was too late.
see?
it's not beautiful?
why are you all wet, baby?
Laeddis isn't dead.
he isn't gone.
he's still here.
I know.
we need to find him, Teddy.
find him and you kill him dead.
it's okay.
again!
Generaytor is faulty
are you okay boss ?
that goddamn Migraine !
back up generator failed. whole places gone crazy.
what do you want to do?
Christ!
no, no, no! Put it down.
now! Now!
you think the whole electrical system is fried?
I think that is a good possibility.
all electronic security system ...
fences, gates, doors
come on.
nice day for a stroll don't you think?
to ward C for example.
maybe you'll find Andrew Leaddis
the guy I told you about, George Noyce?
he told me this is where they keep the worse ones
the guys in the other wards are scared of
noyce did not say anything about the lab?
not really.
all that he remember was people scream day and night. There were no windows.
there were bars everywhere.
Jesus Christ!
first time on ward C, right?
Yes, yes ... - Yes.
yeah heard stories, but ... - Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.
we got most of the bugsies locked down now,
but some of them are still loose.
if you see some don't try to restrain him yourself
these fuckers will kill you.
clear?
well get your ass moving, then c'mon he's here.
I can feel him.
tag! You are it.
Hey, hey!
we're federal agents, we are not martyrs!
this is suicide!
she is just one of many abductions.
why is this abduction so special!
is it because she's a witness against the Torrez?
she is probably caught, and drugged.
we do not have to do this!
if not us...

I told you to stay still!
do not try to capture the Torrez!
turn around now!

why are you so insistent?
I own the entire force... And not just here in Mexico.
I own the DEA... I own the Marshals...
why can't I own you?
why don't you take the money I offered you to look the other way?
what's your price?
maybe I should ask your wife.
bring her in here.
No!
Sara!
your daughter... she's in school right now.
no?
I don't think so.
the honorable way to die... is to cut off your head.
but...
you don't deserve to die honorably.
burn it!
joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.
deputy Director of our local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.
thank you, pleasure to be here.
what steps are you taking to secure our borders?
ice is working with local law enforcement to improve patrols...
but there's over 2000 miles of border between Mexico and the United States and over half of that is here in Texas, so we need to attack the problem at it's source.
there's a whole support network that not only helps illegal aliens get across but is helping them get settled once they are here.
we need to uncover and dismantle this network.
it's a top priority and our most talented
ice agents are investigating them now.
agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for Operation Network.
network is suspected to be run by a woman named Loose.
codename: SHE.
tacos Cafe! TACOS!
loose operates a taco's truck at the labour site.

Jesus, Van! Can't you see she's been childed?
if it gets born here, it gets to be a citizen.
no different than you and me.
I know most people don't like us.
of course... Vigilante's
it's really about vigilance.
somebody's gotta keep watch on this great nation of ours.
otherwise...
Texas will become...
mexico once again.
who's gonna stop it senator?
I am.
welcome to America.
you catch all that?
burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters are going to like that!
a lot.
the infestation has begun...
parasites have crossed our borders...
and are sickening our country...
leeching off our system...
destroying us from the inside.
but state Senator John McLauglin has a plan of attack.
he'll fight to keep illegal immigrants OUT!
he support an electrified border fence.
no amnesty for parasites.
John McLauglin wants to protect you from the invaders.
vote to re-elect state Senator John McLauglin.
paid for by the committee to re-elect state Senator John McLauglin.
Hey!
ugly!
want to fight?
don't tell me you don't wanna earn $500 in five minutes.
that's my man!
Bet's! Place your bets!
fight!
Thanks.
can I get a couple of beans and cheese and a Cafe Ole?
ain't got no cafe Ole.
regular coffee then.
Oh! Hold the spit please.
why do you pretend to come here just for coffee?
I'm not pretending.
I actually like my coffee cheap and greasy.
I can refuse service to anyone.
still the American way.
Yeah, when they are citizens.
got your papers?
same as the last time you checked.
and the time before that.
and the time before that!
got yours?
same as the last time you checked.
you think what you do is right?
taking your brothers and sisters in?
deporting them back to their own personal hell?
it's the law.
there are many laws.
there sure are...
immigration fraud...
aiding and illegal entry...
insanitary food proc...
but you wouldn't know anything about that would you?
can I get my taco's?
who's SHE?
I hear she runs an underground network.
how the hell would I know?
I just make tacos and I sell them, to the workers of this road.
it fills their bellies with something other than hate.
funny.
sounds like something SHE would say.
catch you later.
in the race for State Senator...
latest polls are showing...
a sharp decline in support for incumbent John McLaughlin and his hard-line position on immigration.
get in.
70 dolars a day for gardening 100 for roofing 125 perceptive.
so, which?
you ever killed anyone before?
you know this guy?
senator John McLaughlin...
independent from cocksucker county.
built his reputation on being a hardliner against wetbacks.
gets worse.
yes... if he has his brothers, he'll send you back to old Mehico.
that's his platform.
ship them all back but first make them built a wall along the border for no pay.
thank you very much, get the fuck out.
but what the state senator fails to understand is...
the state runs the illegal labour.
thrives on it.
keeps costs down.
keeps the wheels turning.
we bust that up and we're fucked.
my words.
now I'm guessing you don't have papers.
as you well know...
illegal immigrants like yourself...
will be forced out of this country in alarming numbers.
so for the sake of both our people's, the senator must die.
and for that, I will give you 150 thousand dollars... cash.
get someone else.
no time.
this job has to happen tomorrow.
I want you to take this cash, do the job and disappear.
how long would it take you to get this kind of money?
5... 10... 15 years?
you can do a lot of good things with this.
you deserve it.
now I can't make you do this.
but I can make damn sure something happens to you if you don't.
are you in?
have a look at this...
straight line design,
laser designated scope.
you can shoot the pecker off a mosquito at a thousand yards.
and keep the balls unruffled.
machete? That's only good if you wanna make a brutal point.
but it's low tech. Completely unsuited to our purposes.
backup...
here's your backup.
me.
you call or text if you have any problems, or delays. You need to be on that roof by 1. 00pm sharp.
now put a bullet in the senator by 1: 04pm.
get up!
goddamn it, April.
my business partner have very little tolerance for bullshit.
that's the second operation in the last six months, that I have to close down because of your mentally...
I told you a thousand times.
you need something you come to me directly.
you do not go to these labs.
you got something to say to me?
sorry daddy.
what's this?
$150 thousand.
cash.
are you out of your mind?
the Network got me across once.
use this.
for the people you help.
I don't know how you know what you know.
but I'm glad I know you.
What'd you want?
here.
ladies and Gentlemen.
Mr. Senator John McLaughlin.
I want to thank you all for coming out today!
and I want to thank this forum from the bottom of my heart.
because we have been tested.
tested by fire!
our borders have been put to the test, and let me tell you, we have failed that test.
the aliens, the infiltrators, the outsiders...
they come right across by light of day, by dark at night.
they'll bleed us. They're parasites.
they'll bleed us until we as a city, a county, a state...
a nation until we're all bled out.
now make no mistake, we are at war.
every time an illegal dances across our border, it is an act of aggression against this sovereign state.
a covert act of terrorism.
everywhere I go in this glorious state, people are talking about change.
I say why change?
this is a great state founded on the principles of liberty.
I don't want to change that.
our rightful citizens are hardworking Americans, who have earned their paychecks...
by the grit of their gut and the sweat of their brow!
I don't want to change that!
change! That they want change!
change the law!
open the doors!
red rover! Red rover!
let the terrorist come over!
let me tell you what change that will bring!
68 cents!
the jingle jangle of the pennies in your pocket.
because the scavengers, the leeches, the parasites, are walking away with your money.
while you're left with the change.
so I wanna say one more thing.
who you gonna vote for?
there!
up there! I saw someone shot from up there!
get him to Fort Briggs!
Roger! I'm on my way.
go ahead.
shoot him Nacho.
cos right after that, the three of us are gonna shoot one of you.
shit!
try it.
go ahead... Pacho.
I'll grease your chips all over this fucking alley.
this is fucking big.
this guy took a shot at a representative.
No! A Senator.
the same fucking thing.
the guy can die and we caught him.
hell, yeah we did!
and they'll gonna hang your ass like Saddam!
look, I'm gonna call the boss unless you wanna do it.
Yeah, you go ahead.
Yeah, we got the Mexican black bird that fell off the rooftop!
bring him to the basement.
he stills thinks we're cops.
well of course he will think that.
we frisked him, we cuffed him, we throw him in the car.
apprehended him just like the real cops do.
I didn't frisked him.
Yes, you did.
man, I'm telling you I didn't search...
Oh! Sweet Jesus.
Oh! DAMN!
shocking news this hour.
senator John McLaughlin was shot in the leg this afternoon by an unknown gunman.
the Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital, where he was reportedly to be in good and stable condition.
video taken at the rally indicate that the gunman may have been of Mexican descent.
senator McLaughlin have been very vocal against immigration.
and campaigns for stricter border controls.
boss.
video.
you see what I am sending you, Mr. Torrez?
it's coming on my screen now.
that's campaign gold.
I thought my contributions were for the Senator's re-election, not his retirement.
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.
and in a new session as promised, he'll ramrod through everything we asked for.
Pause!
go back.
who's this?
nobody.
a day labourer from the streets.
he won't be missed.
is he dead?
dead or dying on a rooftop. That's what you mean.
what the fuck is it! Asshole...
dead or dying?
he'll be dead within minutes. I guarantee.
for your sake.
what?
it's me. It's done. I think he's toast.
don't think! Verify! Check the morgue, check the hospitals, check everywhere.
most do not give illegals standard treatment in hospitals.
but thou art with us.
nobody knows you're here.
you were brought here under the name John Doe, as a mere spectator.
is that him? - Yes.
Dr. Felix wants to see him.
quietly...
did you see where the bullet rebound?
it was stopped by another bullet that was fused and lodged there.
if he hadn't been shot before, he'll be dead now.
there's actually a lesson in there somewhere .
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.
woah, woah, woah, at least it's not on your colon.
well, actually did you know that the.
the human intestines is ten times longer than the length of the body?
wait!
so the human intestines is 60 feet long?
it's true.
the hero has awoken!
my friend! You are safe, they are from The Network.
they will take good care of you.
leave him alone.
Hello, what can I do for you?
what can you do for me?
I'm looking for a gentleman that was just brought in.
probably into ICU.
where might I find him?
you wanna go straight down the hall, to your right...
make a left, two rights and another left.
and you'll be right there.
you sure about that?
I'm going this way.
someone is coming.
we got trouble.
got another way outta here?
no other exits.
Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.
that's a skull scraper.
we use that to scrape the bones clean.
and those cut through flesh just like butter.
pass that tank.
hold it!
boss ain't gonna like this.
what are we gonna tell him?
Ooops.
Evana.
where are you, agent?
I'm on my lunch break sir.
lunch break is over. All hell's breaking loose,
some took a shot at Senator McLaughlin.
it was an illegal...
I'm watching it right now.
this amateur video was taken outside county hospital, just after the failed attempt to assassinate Senator McLaughlin.
authorities believe that this suspect is extremely dangerous...
son of a bitch... - If you intrude of this man...
No! Not you sir. - ... contact the police immediately.
I've seen him before.
yes sir. I'm on my way.
he maybe in this country illegally.
and that he is of course to be considered to be armed and extremely dangerous.
you're all over the TV! Cabron! Come on, get inside!
Hurry!
the shots fired on Senator McLaughlin today maybe just the shot in the arm his campaign needed.
new numbers indicate that he has now taken a commanding, lead in the wake of today's incident.
since the shooting, others agree that border security should be heavily enforced.
Yes, hold the illegals responsible! Close the border!
eh... yeah!
didn't you cross the border to get here, Jack?
well, we're almost there.
if they close the border, fine by me.
Nocha!
Cona" Opinions should be like.
Waay!
you didn't have a choice. Of course I believe you.
why else would you give me the money?
they'll be looking for your ass.
you'll be safe here.
try not to bleed on the bed.
are you "SHE"?
if I was SHE, do you think I'll be operating a Taco's truck?
she" brings hope.
she" rights the wrongs.
unfortunately, "SHE's" a myth.
just someone I made up to lead The Network.
at first, I just wanted to help people get settled, give them food, find them work.
now there's a war against us.
von and his border vigilantes.
hunting us down like dogs.
and there's no one there to stop them.
you can...
you're a fighter.
only when there is something worth fighting for.
is there?
always.
when the sun rises, you should be good.
don't start what you can't finish,
machete.
you know me?
I know the legend.
maybe the legend's better.
I'll be the judge of that.
where are you, Mr. Mysterious?
Oh my God...
codename: Machete Ex-Federale.
gunning the Senator down in the street!
what on earth were they thinking?
sometimes I worry about April and what kinda world we're living here.
a fucked up world.
I'd ought to wash your mouth out with soap.
give me another of that taco.
someone took a shot at a senator.
what kind of world would you call it?
a fucked up world.
like two peas in a pod.
so! Hmm...
I think David is going to ask me to marry him.
but I have my priorities.
school and a career.
salsa!
actually I was thinking more about my modeling.
you are a very pretty girl April, but that's a tough nut to crack.
I know all about cracking nuts.
do you even know how many hits I get on my website?
you own a website? She has a website? Do you know about this?
I know all about what the online public wants.
and they want me!
all of me!
that does it. I'm sending you to a convent.
what?
he's loose. He got away.
goddamn it! How hard is it to kill a goddamn day labourer?
you get to that corner where I picked him up.
you find him!
do it!
seen a big wagon?
no... No speak english.
speak. 45?
Where's the tacos truck lady at?
Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen her this morning. She's late.
she...
you know where she lives...
alright... go get him.
you're all over the goddamn TV.
get in!
Agent's!
you're the second beautiful girl that has picked me up today.
exploding houses!
bodies falling from the sky!
Jesus Christ Machete...
you're a walking shit magnet!
ya! I know who you are...
I'm Santana Evira.
immigration Customs and Enforcement .
ice.
fuckin' A! La Migra...
don't worry,
I won't ship you back, if you tell me what I need to know.
working my way up.
I can't be busting people like tacos stands anymore.
well, I'm probably related to half of them.
you need me more than I need you.
come on.
you know all the cops in this state are hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.
I wasn't gonna kill him.
just gonna shoot him in the neck, stop him from saying all those stupid things.
it was a set up.
there was another shooter there.
there was another shooter?
who?
drive!
drive.
I know what they did to your family.
and if I were you I wouldn't trust anyone either, but it's different here.
laws are enforced.
and people control them. Not drug lords.
the system works here...
says you.
I started working on the night shift taking out the trash.
but I worked my way up.
as translator, assistant...
now I'm special agent in charge of investigations.
sounds like they still got you taking out the trash.
let me take you in...
put you into witness protection.
all you got to do is tell me who hired you to take out the senator.
fine.
holy shit.
you mean to tell me that a Mexican daily is a goddamn federale?
that's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled in one mean fucking burrito.
is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?
Yes.
and so far you've failed.
so far.
I'm sorry to see you have such a high tolerance for failure Bon nita.
I don't...
not bad
the last time we spoke you could have mentioned that he was a goddamn federale!
God Dammit!
notoriously is hard to kill, trust me.
I've tried.
well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.
the very best the great state of Texas has to offer.
Osiris Amanpour.
if Machete is captured alive, he'll expose my entire operation.
you have 24 hours take him down, or I'll come over there myself...
and I'll kill him myself.
sorry, my friend.
my grandfather always says you can solve any problem with food.
and you my friend, have plenty of problems.
so who are you working for?
who wants the senator dead?
is it The Network?
Luz?
she doesn't know anything about it.
network either.
the man who hired me...
was a Mexican.
Really?
so he was just a random guy who says.
Hey, wanna kill the senator today?
and you are like cool?
I was afraid he wanted receptive work.
instead, he offered me $150, 000 to kill the senator.
that's a lot of money.
so that's why you did it?
for the money.
look, Machete.
you're not legal in this country.
and after what happened to you in Mexico, there is no way you're going home.
so basically, you're a man with no country.
and lucky for you, I can help you out.
look at me.
I can get you papers.
but you've got to let me bring you in.
I'm gonna find the guy who did this and bring him to you.
why should I trust you?
because we are both cops.
I'd tell you to stop, but I know you took the bullets.
Luz!
Luz!
you didn't think they'll take me down that easily did ya?
you're alive. But your house man!
it was small...
I've got something to show you guys, come on...
I told you they were gunning for us.
who knows what they'll gonna do next.
holy shit, Luz!
I didn't know that you were this loaded.
you got more heat than the Popos .
it's a good start, but we need a lot more.
need it for what?
la Revoluzion.
van and his men are coming for us.
we need to be ready.
I'm not gonna be around forever.
if anything happens, you need to tell Machete the people need him.
who exactly is this Machete?
that's him...
he's the one.
hands up!
against the wall.
all of you, move it!
Where's Machete?
shit. She knows. Man!
amigo's gonna deport our ass back.
nobodies deporting anybody.
machete already told me you guys weren't involved in the shooting.
although... I should probably check the "carnitas.
for lead!
what is this place anyway?
welcome to The Network.
these are some of the people that I've help.
help them cross, got them jobs, then make sure that they do their part.
and this?
these are the guys trying to stop us.
van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.
they started off with a couple of deer rifles and a warped sense of justice.
then in the past year they've grown.
more guns, more men.
who's funding them?
whoever it is, is making a mess of our operation.
and these?
missing!
they are supposed to have crossed. But I have no way to track them.
how deep does your operation go?
deep.
all types, all races. Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys...
that's why they call it "The Network.
the way we see it, people risk everything to get here.
the system doesn't work.
it's broken.
so we created our own.
you gonna burn us, huh?
turn us all in?
no.
I'm gonna walk away and pretend I didn't see any of this.
tell Machete I'm looking for him!
I am a man of faith,
I took a vow of peace.
and I don't shoot anymore.
and you don't shoot any less either.
I don't see you or hear from you in three years,
and now you want me to help you kill all these men?
Yes, brother...
I mean, Padre.
I'll see what I can do.
I want you to say 10 our Fathers and 10 hail Marys.
light a candle for mom...
for funerals. A little side business.
I have these installed when too many things started walking away from the altar and collection plates.
imagine if we have these kinda setup for all the federales.
this is how you get the bad guys now.
no, you catch them on video.
Cuban?
Mexican.
Yeah, I got some of that.
I've got something I want you to see.
rest assure he will be caught.
it is the first shot of the war that.
we didn't ask for.
nice way to find out your brother's in town.
these intruders they mean to have...
right there.
we can only hope that...
that's the guy that hired me.
michael Booth?
he's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.
you know him?
yeah... he comes in for confession all the time.
lots of impure thoughts.
mostly about his daughter.
I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink.
here's his file.
once he started talking about his connection to the cartels,
I figured, it'll come in handy.
I bet McLaughlin doesn't even know that most of Booth's, business are just a front for his drug trade.
what I don't understand is why would he hired you to kill his own boss.
don't know.
gonna find out.
it's not safe for you to be here.
not looking for safe.
no I mean it's not safe for me for you to be here.
I absolve you of all your sins, now get the fuck out!
okay, brother...
but I'm borrowing your car.
why are you complaining about a weak neck,
I'd said you should fucking do some sit-ups.
hey... hey, hey boss?
who're you?
the new gardener.
the gardener?
I'm just fucking with you, chief.
it's Hungarian, for I'll kill you, you little monkey.
you know what? There's a big pile of shit in the back, you can go and clean that up. Alright!
make sure you do a good job.
make sure you wipe those boots off!
he's carrying shit in the house.
did you ever notice that you let a Mexicans into your home...
just because he's got gardening tools?
I mean, no questions asked.
you just let him right in.
he could have a chainsaw or a machete...
God! Jesus!
stop it!
dammit, that hurts!
if your father ever saw me, 2 minutes.
mom, everyone is gonna see you do this.
it's the internet.
this is what my viewers wanna see online.
Hey! You're not the usual guy.
he looks good to me.
Oh don't be shy, come on in!
access denied.
what the fuck did you bring them here for?
didn't you hear a goddamn word I said?
want me to dump them?
what? No... no.
I would make good use of them.
the Church can always use good people.
June?
April?
Where's my wife and daughter?
Woah... one family at a time.
it's Osiris...
machete has a amano .
or should I say, Padre.
state Senator John McLaughlin took a vow to defend the Constitution of this State.
now...
he's taken a bullet for us.
and this is that bullet.
vote to re-elect Sen. John McLaughlin.
I'm John McLaughlin and I approved of this message.
paid for by the Committee to re-elect John McLaughlin.
sorry ma'am.
damn new phone.
I should put on the vibrator.
can you help me do that?
pervert.
yeah?
senator?
it's Van.
I hear you got a problem maybe we can fix.
don't call me on this line again. I'll call you.
now you said it yourself Senator war has begun.
helter Skelter is here.
your army awaits further orders.
got to be respectful now.
no shit slaves.
what about the shooter?
he's still out there?
there's nothing I'd like more, then to see that Mexican dance the bolero with the end of the rope.
he's gone underground for sure.
let's say we go underground.
and get him.
you find the Network and you find the shooter.
call our special friend.
tell him we're gonna need a helluva more firepower.
if he is serious about wanting that border shut down.
fix your damn gun.
Thanks.
our friend is up.
where the fuck have you been?
you could at least texted me.
machete don't text.
but Machete get evidence.
thanks for coming back.
there is no way that McLaughlin is getting elected, unless something big happens.
can you imagine if someone shot the senator and that someone was a Mexican
the public would elect him to be president.
it's not a sin if someone clinch the senator in the leg is it?
so, this is footage from your brother's confession?
there's no open commandant against "thou shall not wing a man.
is there Padre?
put these files over here, you got from Booth's office.
they're encrypted.
is my little girl April... I spent nights...
denied.
now, you don't think it's going to be that easy, do you?
I just wish that April saw me as more a real man.
holy shit...
you're right. The Network is not behind it.
this is something a helluva lot bigger.
you've got enough here to bring down everyone.
the Senator, Booth...
van...
look here.
there's Mexican drug money financing the Senator's campaign.
Rogelio Torrez.
Torrez...
he's the drug kingpin who's been trying to gain control of the drug trade.
this must be the border fence McLaughlin wants to build.
see this?
these markings show the weakest spots.
it all makes sense now.
torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin re-elected, so that he can build a border fence that he can control.
you did good work Machete.
I bet you're a great cop.
the best.
and modest too.
I'm dry.
get up.
Why?
because you're drunk.
come be with me.
speak english?
depends on the question.
we know that you hired that Mexican to kill our senator.
you the Network, ain't cha?
hell! You're behind everything.
that's not how we work.
but if you want war...
I will give it to you.
how about an eye for an eye?
you burned your last burrito.
you got to get better at this, Billy.
please, Father, have mercy.
God has mercy, I don't.
hello Padre.
the Blood of Christ? Taste like Merlot to me.
where is he?
he's everywhere.
talk Padre.
sing me one of those Mexican hymns like a chroming arch boy.
go to hell.
you want to be a martyr? I'm good at making martyrs.
like Senator McLaughlin?
that's right.
we've to get that Senator re-elected. Get that fence built along the border before it is too late.
you really hate our kind that much?
no padre, I hate declining profits that much.
an open border allows supply of flowing too easily.
drives our prices down.
restricted border, limits supply. Drives the prices up.
higher prices, higher profits.
you are drunk with power, even putting the hit on your own boss.
just to boost his election numbers.
last chance, amigo.
Where's Machete and where are my wife and daughter?
in hell.
then give them my best.
a real gentleman.
comfortable...
are they the same?
they want you dead too.
my brother.
wait!
how do you text with this thing?
I thought Machete don't text.
machete improvise.
Where're you going?
take out the trash.
machete sent me a text.
what's it say?
you just fuck with the wrong Mexican.
he's coming after us.
no, he's coming after you.
you got some news?
Yes.
his brother's is dead.
you killed a priest.
Congratulations.
that's right Booth, I'm in your town.
and I'm gonna kill Machete.
and you're gonna watch it happen.
and it will be the last thing you see.
wait a second.
there's a girl from ICE.
she's with Machete on this and they have a file on me, on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.
she can make things very difficult for us.
where is she?
you know, I've been thinking.
we let these people into our homes, watch our kids, park our cars.
but we won't let them into our country.
does that make any sense to you?
Hey! That wetback club us both over the head.
in case you forgot, he shot me in the leg.
I thought Jango shot you?
I don't want to hear that story ever again.
think about it.
he wasn't here for us.
he's here for the boss.
I've been watching the boss. This guy is a real scumbag.
Hey, hey, hey.
Where's your loyalty at?
did you hear that?
it's the weed whacker.
he's back! Spread out.
spread out now!
alpha unit, you copy?
I quit!
anybody, report. You hear me?
anybody?
Where's Booth?
the senator, he's with the senator.
I have a GPS.
tracks his limo.
Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it.
that's Spanish, "I let you live.
Thanks, Chief!
let me see if I am hearing you right.
one of the city's most prominent businessmen.
a Texas vigilante.
the most notorious drug kingpin of Mexico and a state senator, are all conspiring to enact stricter immigration laws?
I know how it sounds, but I have Booth on video committing a murder.
I have tons of confessions.
I mean it's...
listen to yourself, this man is an illegal alien,
illegal as in against the law.
well, there's the law and there's what's right.
I'm gonna do what's right.
we are live from the Church of Hope where just moments ago, Police discovered a gruesome murder scene.
the body of a priest was found nailed to a cross.
and witnesses descriptions of a man leaving the church match those of a gunman wanted for the shooting of Senator McLaughlin.
excuse me honey's, just shut the door and give us a moment.
on the street, they call him Machete.
who is he, what is he?
and will he ever be brought down?
where the fuck have you been?
this story is burning the whole fucking town to the ground.
it's giving us a war I want to know we can win!
he's a cockroach, sooner or later he'll be squashed.
Oh, oh, yeah! Well, this cockroach has got AK-47's and he's laying waste to everything that get's in his fucking path.
I'm taking care of it.
they scheduled me for release in a couple of minutes...
I can't walk outta here like a fucking piuata waiting to get whacked.
the man they are calling Machete...
we're ready for you Senator.
may have been involved in the killing of a priest.
it's show time...
you forgot your cane, sir.
ladies and gentlemen,
senator John McLaughlin.
thank you, thank you.
this freehold danzito is not any closer to justice.
I "urge" this criminal and those that are hiding him, to turn him in.
he's destroying us from the inside, like the plague that he is...
we must not let the terrorist win.
senator...
there are reports implicating, your advisors as having orchestrating the assassination attempt.
would you care to comment?
what now?
want to be a martyr? I am good at making martyrs.
like Senator McLaughlin?
that's right.
we have to get that Senator re-elected.
get that fence built along the border, before it's too late.
or do you care to comment, on the shooting. That happened on the border on the night of July 22nd?
who is gonna stop us?
I am!
welcome to America.
you catch all that?
burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters are going to like that!
a lot!
how about your connections with drug king pin Rogelio Torrez?
no further comment.
I'm sorry, I just...
or the border vigilantes involved in running drugs?
I think I'm having a heart attack.
God dammit if you don't relax, you will have one.
you jeopardize more than my career, we got to cut back.
he could have killed me.
not with that scope.
you stupid son of a bitch...
you pulled something like that without consulting me?
who the fuck do you think you are?!
I'm the one who got your campaign financed.
made you a major political powerhouse.
your own personal Jesus.
so, you better get down on your knees, and start praying for me to save your soul, because I'm the only one who can at this point!
get the fuck out.
God dammit man, why don't you just die?
it's gonna work.
we could have been rich.
Torrez, was stopping all those cheap shit from across the border.
did I tell you that?
can lead more than a tired pendejo with a dime bag and a dream.
so we financed Van.
give him and his men guns.
the Vigilantes.
our own little private border patrol.
but Torrez wanted all that chelada.
so I thought why not let politics do what guns couldn't.
funny things is, I thought it would be a more peaceful resolution.
none of that tortured taco.
wait, wait...
torrez is looking for you.
you find Van, you'll find Torrez.
please...
tell me...
where are my wife and daughter?
with God.
I guess I won't be seeing them.
fuck! My head...
what is this shit?
that asshole drugged us.
where are our clothes?
call daddy.
it's June, and April.
we're very sorry.
your husband is dead.
he's what?
senator McLaughlin shot him.
secure that weapon! Yeah!
vigilante leader, Van Jackson has refused comment, after startling revelations of their connections, to the Mexican drug cartels.
this is Van...
I'm coming in.
we're all over the news, senator...
you compromised everything we worked for.
there is only one way this thing is gonna end.
smoke em' out.
but I wanna put a bullet in his head myself.
and just how you're figuring on doing that?
I'm joining you boys for one last ride along.
machete.
Where's Luz?
she's gone, man.
Vigilante's got her.
and now they're after you.
you gotta lead us to fight, it's what Luz would have want!
not your war.
I maybe adopted as it is...
no shit.
what's going on is not right!
we just wanna help, brother.
I don't need your help.
not us?
then who?
whatever you need.
build it, strip it, chop it.
garage's is yours, Homez...
got guns?
Si.
we have missiles, machine guns.
we fight Van, we fight Torrez.
we take em' all down at once.
hey everyone!
listen UP! Now we got some work to do!
does anyone knows who's Machete?
does anyone knows who's Machete?
please.
machete needs your help or he'll be killed just like Luz, just like Padre.
listen to me!
Yes, I am a woman of the law, and there are lots of laws!
but if they don't offer us justice, then they aren't law!
they are just lines drawn in the sand by men who would stand on your backs, for power and glory.
men who deserves to be cut down.
it's time to erase the meyette the line!
and show these cabronese the meaning of true law!
we didn't cross the border.
the border crossed us!
viva la Machete!
viva la Machete!
you're Machete's girl.
I know, cause you're his type.
what type is that?
dead.
earlier today,
senator John McLaughlin allegedly pulled a gun, on his advisor Michael Booth, and shot him twice in the chest.
after an altercation following the disaster reveal earlier this afternoon of the senator's connections to the Mexican drug kingpin Rogelio Torrez.
network!
according to recent reports,
McLaughlin's re-election campaign has been funded entirely by Mr. Torrez.
Machete!
networks said the senator calling the vigilantes to kill you.
and Agent Santana, she's been captured by Torrez!
all hands and the armory to load up.
time to roll out!
give me a vest and a rifle.
my great grand daddy...
did not give his life at The Alamo so that we could sell out our nation to a bunch of backstabbing politicians.
what are you talking about?
you lied to us, you paid that Mexican to put on an act.
to fool the people.
and my pool of posse.
now he's on his way...
and no doubt bringing a whole mess of bean eaters.
you seem to be quite fond of Booth, Senator.
you've been in the desert too long amigo...
well let's see just how this blows your skirt up?
we're gonna simulcast your execution for the crime of treason.
no shit stains.
guys! They're on their way!
get to your posts!
time for your last testament.
no second takes.
just get your lines right.
hold the line...
I have desecrated the oath of our first...
and I am a traitor deserving death.
ready?
fucking parasites!
fucking terrorists!
aim.
shit!
two of you stay with him...
the rest of you outside.
Oh shit!
fuck em up!
how is your eye?
what eye?
if you want to survive your own war, you better become Mexican real fast.
you got enemies on all sides, Senator.
who can you trust?
you aim to take down those girls, boys?
then I'm with you.
take out that Mexican!
God Dammit!
van, we're fucked! We gotta get outta here.
get outta here!
sister...
please...
I've done wrong...
I haven't behave for life...
and I'm ain't from here. I hate Texas.
I hate the heat.
give me my last rites.
in the name of my father...
my father...
april.
I forgot the rest.
you never know how to stay down, Punieta .
so I guess I have to teach you.
got something to say?
now you got something to say?
back the fuck up and watch.
okay, Punieta!
Adelante .
we used to be federale's together, kanna ,
remember?
we were brothers...
but you...
...went for the honor.
pendejo .
then I went for the power.
we killed a lot of bad guys together.
now I'm the bad guy.
what do you wanna do, Hermanito ?
look at your Machete now, Cabron.
he's gonna kill him.
no, he's not.
he's Machete.
no point.
cap Puto .
you know, I could kill you right now, quite easily.
believe me.
this is nothing.
this ain't shit.
but...
I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.
so...
I think I'll say goodbye.
fuck it.
there's one!
goddamn cockroach.
can't speak english, can you boy?
welcome to America.
what, you wanna see my ID?
don't bother.
I've got something better.
I called in a few favours.
look at this.
got you all the right papers.
you can start over now.
be a real person.
why do I want to be a real person when I'm already a myth.
where will you go?
everywhere.
can I ride with you?
hold the doors, please!
thank you. Good morning.
good morning.
Draper has you in early, huh?
what's he up to?
I don't know. I kind of came in for myself.
okay.
honestly, I couldn't sleep. I'm just filled with nerves.
the service elevator is out. Do you mind?
I'm moving today.
I'm supposed to go by at lunch and supervise the movers.
probably lose the rest of the day watching other people work.
well, that is a big day.
what do you have to be nervous about?
nothing.
just, I think, mr. Rumsen is presenting my copy today to the belle jolie people.
a thing like that.
we really took the local, didn't we? It's 7 in the morning.
I'm very sorry, sir.
here we are.
I'm going to hop down for a coffee. Would you like some?
no.
are you sure?
come in here, please.
close the door.
there's no one here.
close the door.
Peggy, do you know how hard it is to see you walking around here every day?
your skirt. It's tight.
just pull it up.
be careful.
listen, maybe this isn't the right time to mention this, but I want to clear the air.
I know I told you I would read the copy that you wrote, but I haven't.
I'm glad.
I thought you just didn't like it.
that's too bad.
I know what you're going to say.
no.
you don't. You haven't been right once.
I have all these things going on in my head, and I can't say them.
do you think about me?
I'll be honest.
a few times.
you're only 20 yards away.
not right now.
I wake up in the morning, and I look into trudy's eyes, and I think, we're supposed to be one person.
but whatever I try, uh...
there are all these things going on in my head.
she's just another stranger.
you're not alone in this.
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.
it's okay.
hi ma
my love
ma, I'm at work
then don't answer the phone
tell them no calls from your mother
look who's off the clock again.
what's wrong?
what?
what is it, Ma?
the landlord changed the light bulb, but it's a darker light bulb.
ma...
it's different.
he's speaking italian to his mother.
ma, ma, I got to run. I love you.
Byebye, my little son
Ciao, ciao.
my stars.
two weeks in, and she's already a goner.
he talks to his mother a lot.
Mr. Crane?
I'll connect you.
because he's not married.
well, he's in the art department?
what does he look like?
did you see that movie marty with ernest borgnine?
he lived with his mother.
stop teasing her.
Yes, right away.
my guess is tall, dark, and handsome, but I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.
she is so thoughtful.
let me get my purse.
forget it.
Mrs. Sterling will be calling before lunchtime today.
please put her through directly to me.
done.
ask her. She'll know.
Salvatore romano in the art department. Do you know him?
handsome. Very debonair.
cologne, but not the cheap stuff.
something european, maybe.
you're so specific.
you have voices. I have other things.
thank you so much for holding.
good morning. - Good morning.
Mr. Cooper wanted to see you in his office.
tell mr. Sterling I'll be right there.
no, it's just mr. Cooper.
thank you, peggy.
what happened there?
I caught it on something.
I might start keeping a spare.
come on in.
I'd prefer you didn't smoke in here right now.
don, I am appreciative of your talents, and although that cannot be measured,
I have made an effort to quantify.
I, uh- thank you.
that's what you say.
have you read her? Rand.Atlas shrugged.
that's the one.
Yes. Yes, it is.
see, I know you haven't read it.
when you hit 40, you realize you've met or seen every kind of person there is, and I know what kind you are.
because I believe we are alike.
I assume that's flattering.
by that I mean you are a productive and reasonable man and in the end completely self-interested.
it's strength.
we are different
unsentimental about all the people who depend on our hard work.
take $1. 99 out of that $2, 500 and buy yourself a copy.
I will.
well, hello, there.
hello.
are you traffic, or are you here for casting?
I'm-- I'm not a model. I'm new.
excuse me, marty, who's doing the firestone comps, you or frank?
neither of us. Sal, we were talking to miss...
I'm new here. Switchboard.
uh, marty faraday.
why would they hide you?
Hi, lois. Duane davis.
sorry about the mess.
Oh, no, it's divine.
I work in a closet all day, so just to come out and walk around is wonderful.
is there anything I can do for you?
I'm such a featherhead.
I need to get my paperwork in to accounting, then find my way back to the switchboard room. Am I close?
no. You're not even on the right floor.
I'll walk you there.
no. Just point me there. I'm fine.
go upstairs, make a left outside of the stairwell, follow the wall past the ladies' room.
well, nice to meet you.
Ciao, ciao.
that ate up some time.
I like when they flirt with me.
she was flirting with him.
you know, I had the salesman pushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.
I'd have bought it right away if I knew it worked.
it's not the ties. They always talk to you.
they can tell you make money.
I told you, you don't need money to dress better than you do, duane.
Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.
what line?
light up a line, will you?
no, she's right here, in person.
send her in.
Hello, my love.
Hello, homeowner.
what are you doing here, lovely?
I thought I'd come get you and we could go together. We could even walk.
it's 30 blocks.
it's beautiful outside.
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.
well, then let's do this here.
I said I'd meet you there if my schedule allowed, and now it doesn't look so good.
no, you didn't, and I'm here now. What does it matter?
this is my office.
how do you think it looks?
like you are beloved by your wife.
you see what happens when you just show up like this?
we fight.
I came to celebrate us having our apartment, which I for one am happy about.
and you have ruined it.
I'm sorry.
I'm just busier than I thought.
let's have a glass of champagne.
I'm sorry.
we're going to live there a long time.
there's no point in being superstitious.
it's as simple as pluribus unum: From many to one.
from many shades of lipstick, one that belongs to her.
from a basket of kisses, she picks one.
it makes her unique. It colors her kiss.
and her kiss, well, it colors her man.
belle jolie lipstick.
mark your man.
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.
women want colors, lots and lots of colors.
mark your man.
it's pretty cute.
Oh, you like this?
well, maybe we should cut down to five shades, or one.
I'm not telling you to listen to anyone, but this is a very fresh approach.
it's okay, kenny. I don't think there's much else to do here but call it a day.
gentlemen, thank you for your time.
is that all?
you're a nonbeliever.
why should we waste time on kabuki?
I don't know what that means.
it means that you've already tried your plan, and you're number 4.
you've enlisted my expertise, and you've rejected it to go on the way you've been going.
I'm not interested in that. You can understand.
I don't think your three months or however many thousands of dollars entitles you to refocus the core of our business.
listen, I'm not here to tell you about jesus.
you already know about jesus.
either he lives in your heart, or he doesn't.
every woman wants choices, but in the end, none wants to be one of a hundred in a box.
she's unique.
she makes the choices, and she's chosen him.
she wants to tell the world he's mine.
he belongs to me, not you.
she marks her man with her lips.
he is her possession.
you've given every girl that wears your lipstick the gift of total ownership.
sit down.
No.Not until I know I'm not wasting my time.
sit down.
you know how to get back to the roosevelt?
we could have someone walk you over, or just meet you, if you're interested.
you're a troublemaker.
although it is a place to get into trouble.
they just did this incredible renovation.
it reminds me a little of a steamship.
and the people-- I was in the lounge last night, and I end up having a drink with robert mitchum.
actually, many drinks.
now you know we wouldn't steer you wrong.
nice work.
I think you may be right about this.
well, we'll never know, will we?
what?
it's not a science, hugh. We'll do our best.
that jesus thing.
I don't know what to say.
probably better than dangling him out the window by his ankles.
that's just a story.
don's never actually done that.
Ken, you will realize in your private life that at a certain point seduction is over and force is actually being requested.
Ah, he's a kid.
he thinks it's the other way around.
Peggy, ice! We'll need some.
should I just put it down?
how much ice?
how do you take it?
home run, ballerina.
go ahead, before joan holloway sees.
you call that celebrating?
the meeting was so long, I was worried.
we barely finished the presentation, and he bought it.
no, he's bring modest.
Donald walked around the village three times and then set it on fire.
Oh, my god. Can I see it?
it's marvelous.
I thought it was going to say it's the mark you make on your man.
was it, now?
you may be a writer, honey.
Really?
you're arrogant.
you want another drink?
I don't know.
not a writer. - Not a writer.
can I keep it?
no.
what are you doing?
don't ever put your name on a list.
they keep track of everything we do here.
have you never heard of joseph mccarthy?
it's the bowling team.
Oh, my god. It happened.
they loved it.
what are you talking about?
I'm heading out.
don't look for me. I have errands to run.
my belle jolie copy.
they loved it.
Congratulations.
that's so fascinating!
I'm glad your other work was suffering for a reason.
they poured me a drink.
who?
Mr. Draper.
Mr. Rumsen, mr. Romano, and- - oh, I'm so jealous.
don't be. I was just
I shouldn't be bragging.
they sold peggy's copy.
my word.
actually, they changed it a little bit, but it worked.
Oh, we're celebrating.
how about it? Five minutes to 5, we head to P. JClarke'S.
perfect!
it's going to be a hell of an afternoon traffic meeting.
champagne. When did that happen?
another grateful client stopped by.
I thought you were moving today.
I was looking forward to seeing you in coveralls.
Yes, well, I managed to explain to the concerned party that I already have a job.
do they ever stop asking for things?
hello.
hello.
Hildy, um, she must have gone to lunch already.
Congratulations. - Yes.
I hear you're quite the little scribe.
you can trust ken's opinion here. He's a published author.
but he can't write copy.
I don't like to limit my words that much.
I also hate puns.
come on.
Admiral: The television that won't go down the tubes.
shut up.
so you going to celebrate?
well, yes, actually.
a bunch of us-- just the girls so far-- are going to P. J.Clarke's tonight.
forget tonight. I heard cooper, sterling, and draper already left.
am I wrong?
what about mr. Rumsen?
freddie rumsen's at P. J.'S right now, and he doesn't know there's a party.
3: 00, after the traffic meeting.
Joan's a tattletale.
I don't know, peggy. I'm kind of senior ranking when those other men are gone.
speaker of the house. He'll be there.
I should probably go home, actually.
well, if we're starting at 3, you can go home at 5. It'll still be after work.
we all work so hard, I think we all need it.
why not?
Toodle-oo.
hello.
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch, but I have a phone call for you.
I'm glad I stayed in.
Oh, it's disconnected.
everybody's talking about the meeting.
miss olsen said your artwork was spectacular.
she did, did she?
anyway, a bunch of us are taking her out to drinks. P.J. Clarke's?
she deserves it.
you have to come.
this is lois sadler, by the way.
I know that. I'll be there.
good.
can I help you?
can I help you, sir?
it's don.
the ad man.
he's okay.
excuse me, fellas.
Oh, just because I can't call you doesn't mean you can't call me.
hello.
pack a bag. We're going to paris.
what? - Paris.
now?
Where'd you get that?
it's a bonus.
I'm not sure what for. - I bet.
what do you say?
I called idyllwild.
we can have breakfast at versailles.
I'm sorry.
I have a special night planned.
I thought you didn't make plans.
is he joining us?
Yes. He has to.
he looks kind of square.
kibby just came four days straight from juarez.
may I? I've been thinking about this since port authority.
stay. You'll love it.
we're going to get high and listen to miles.
that's your plan?
we can do this first and then do that.
it'll be a lot more fun.
sit down. Relax.
next to me, icky.
where did you find him?
you know you need to leave the village for a decent screw.
I'll take care of him.
do you like it?
I feel like dorothy.
everything just turned to color.
the words.
you are good with the words, man.
well put.
Kibby, why don't you make yourself useful and get me a glass of water?
my word, I need to get one of those.
no, thanks.
okay.
maybe.
we realize there's no music playing.
just the
good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm embarrassed to ask, seeing as we all have it hard right now, but is there any way I can trouble you for a meal?
I'm willing to work for it.
look around you.
we're not christians here no more.
that is not true.
fine, fine.
work will feed your soul, but there's no work left here today.
come back tomorrow?
nonsense.
you'll stay with us and eat with us, and work tomorrow.
I will have to boil those clothes, though, if you're going to sit at my table.
I'm not offended.
it would be a relief to me as well.
Dick whitman, stop digging holes.
build a fire under the cauldron.
Hiya, kid.
what did I say to you?
reminds me of myself.
that doesn't surprise me at all.
so we thank you, lord, for this bounty we are about to receive that we may share it with those in need.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
thank you again.
thank you so much. This smells delicious.
where are those manners from?
let him eat and be on with it.
I'm from just east.
about new york, originally, some other places.
Ah. New york.
it's how you took to being on the bum so easy.
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.
I'm just saying I bet he don't know which end of a weed to pull.
that's the truth, sir.
I only know some farm work, but I've seen mills and docks and factories.
I've been a worker.
are you a communist?
no.
Yeah, I imagine they're different, all right.
they take a club to the jaw like anyone else.
they are souls, but they can't be saved.
that's true.
my mom always said that life is like a horseshoe.
it's fat in the middle, open on both ends, and hard all the way through.
tomorrow...
when you've finished some work.
bless you.
I had to see this place for myself.
good.
it's something, huh?
no bob mitchum?
what are you drinking?
campari with a twist.
you know, when I mentioned the renovation, I didn't know if you heard me.
I've been curious about seeing this place.
I'm actually involved with architects on this department store.
signage, mostly.
I like this room, although I am its prime target: Traveling salesman.
in that suit?
I should say not.
no, I'm not one of those boys who looks forward to a business trip to escape the wife and kids.
I'm really a homebody.
but new york?
when you arrive, and that train starts slowing down and it gets all dark, my heart pounds, and I think, I'm going to climb that staircase and be in new york.
I take it for granted.
it is a masterpiece of some kind.
wherever I'm staying, I always demand a view.
it's building after building.
little compartments filled with possibilities.
what's that from?
42nd street?
what?
uh, no. No.
I'm just saying it's-- it's like you can do anything.
I'm two ahead of you.
I have to eat something, or I'm going to continue to rhapsodize.
what time is it?
I bet you don't have an expense account.
I'm not saying peggy doesn't have something upstairs.
I'm just saying at sterling cooper things are usually happening downstairs.
I didn't know that.
God, the whole office is here.
I don't see the art department.
what about those two?
I think I had too much to drink.
you are very petite.
going back to the well. Interested?
dance with me.
I don't like you like this.
literally, with flies.
the espresso beans mean health, wealth, and, um, happiness.
seems redundant, I mean, if you already have health and wealth.
so, are you happy?
I'm one of those people who thinks the minute you ask that, you're not happy, so...
no.
you're loud, but you're shy.
I feel like I'm getting my fortune told.
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's fine.
so what do you want to do?
uh...I don't know.
let me break off with one of the writers, have my own little shop where copy follows art and not the other way around.
no, I mean my view.
you have to see it.
it's all the way to the park.
of course it's dark now.
I don't know.
may I?
I...don't know what to say.
it's elliot.
and, salvatore, you don't have to say anything.
no, I-- I just-- no.
have another drink.
think about it.
Elliot, I have thought about it.
I know what I want.
I know what I want to do.
I know what you're thinking.
I'll show you.
what are you afraid of?
are you joking?
this... has been a pleasure.
don, are you all right?
I don't know.
it's always the same thing!
probably the student in 2f.
he uses his wife like a speed bag.
Oh, man.
I was going to truck down for some carrot juice.
wait, wait.
thank you.
smoke?
no.
Oh. He speaks.
I'm supposed to tell you to say your prayers.
praying won't help you from this place, kid.
best keep your mind on your mother.
she'll probably look after you.
she ain't my momma.
we all wish we were from someplace else, believe me.
ain't you heard?
I'm a whore child.
no.
I hadn't heard anything about that.
you don't talk like a bum.
I'm not.
I'm a gentleman of the rails.
for me, every day is brand-new.
every day's a brand-new place, people, what have you.
so you got no home.
that's sad.
what's at home?
I had a family once: A wife, a job, a mortgage.
I couldn't sleep at night tied to all those things.
then death came to find me.
did you see him?
only every night.
so one morning, I freed myself with the clothes on my back.
good-bye.
now I sleep like a stone: Sometimes under the stars, the rain.
the roof of a barn.
but I sleep like a stone.
so where do you go?
tomorrow I'll be leaving this place, that's for certain.
if death was coming anyplace, it's here, kid, creeping around every corner.
here.
you're an honorary.
this is how we talk to each other.
on the front gate of every house, there's a mark.
it's a code, just like you heard on the radio.
see...
that's a pie.
it means the food here is good.
this one...
that means watch out for the nasty dog.
this one here...
that means a dishonest man lives here.
and this one...
that means tell a sad story.
here.
don't be scared, kid.
you ain't a man yet.
of course.
what?
you two.
you're in love.
what?
that's ridiculous.
every day I make pictures where people appear to be in love.
I know what it looks like.
looks like a magazine.
love is bourgeois.
you're breaking my heart.
ad man's got a heart.
the grownups are talking.
don't defend him.
toothpaste doesn't solve anything.
dacron sure as hell won't bring back those ten dead kids in biloxi.
neither will buying some tokaj wine and leaning up against a wall in grand central pretending you're a vagrant.
you know what it's like to watch all you ants go into your hive?
I wipe my ass with the wall street journal.
how come every time we have a party, the ladies have to sit and listen to the men talk?
look at you
satisfied, dreaming up jingles for soap flakes and spot remover, telling yourself you're free.
Oh, my god.
stop talking.
make something of yourself.
like you?
you make the lie.
you invent want.
you're for them...
not us.
well, I hate to break it to you, but there is no big lie.
there is no system.
the universe is indifferent.
man, wman, why'd you have to say that?
Paris. Now.
let's go.
no, I can't.
buy yourself a car.
Oh, don.
the cops.
you can't go out there.
you can't.
good evening.
wake up, bobby.
come on, kiddo.
daddy.
shh, shh, shh.
your sister's sleeping.
ask me anything.
what?
anything.
I'm tired.
ask me.
uh, why do lightning bugs light up?
I don't know.
but I will never lie to you.
well, sir, I believe that does it.
I'll be on my way.
thank you, again, for sharing your home.
good luck to you.
be on your way already.
good morning, peggy.
good morning, mr. Draper.
kids, it' s time to go!
coming, Carla.
and I said I liked her name.
Cocoa' s a nice name. Isn' t it?
Yes, it is.
come on, Bobby. Let' s go.
all right. Let' s go.
good morning. - Good morning.
Peggy. - Good morning, Don.
good morning, Mr. Draper.
you hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.
it' s very upsetting.
I can' t say I'm surprised.
the few things I know about her.
you just don' t imagine her ever being alone.
she was so famous.
some people just hide in plain sight.
my mother and sister keep calling.
suicide is disturbing.
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.
we' re lucky Playtex didn' t go for that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.
we' d have to pull everything indefinitely.
Yes, that' s true.
I' ve never taken pills, even when I had a headache.
Mr. Draper, good morning.
would you like coffee? - I already had some.
they' re waiting for you in the conference room.
do you need to go home?
no. Of course not.
I have Warren, and I have Todd.
Todd is a mail boy. Why do you have him?
I' m paying him.
I' m sorry. I don' t understand this stupid blood drive.
you just hate that Media wins every year.
wins what? How do you win a blood drive? What do you win?
I don' t know. " You Are The Best" or something.
I' ll be lucky if Accounts can get eight people.
well, Campbell' s afraid of needles,
duck doesn' t give two craps.
good morning.
good morning, fellas. Is this program already in progress?
we' re expecting our most successful blood drive ever.
Yes. Tell me everything.
I think we' re very organized.
creative, our department, will be at 75 to 80% participation.
of course, I' m assuming you are in.
I am.
do Kurt and Smitty count as one person?
why don' t you bore me with the details?
we' re going to take the lockers out of the break room, put them in the hallway in the morning.
there will be two litters, three nurses, at least one old lady serving refreshments, and plenty of chairs.
Kinsey, I want you to pull every intern and lackey...
switchboard, elevator men.
find out who wants to be a copywriter for the day.
dollar a head. - That' s not fair.
you' re in accounts. You should have thought of it.
just to be clear, do I get the dollar for each person I get, or do they get it for giving blood?
the people giving blood.
this is for mankind, Kinsey.
that' s the money they'd make actually being in the art department.
so what is the prize?
helping another human being.
also, there will be women fainting.
I' d think you' d like that.
if this was a flat- out athletic competition,
accounts would win, without a doubt.
what an elegant surrender. And put up more posters.
I can' t believe I have to say that to you people.
apparently, if we get 100% participation, which Media will do its best to aid, they' re going to put us in the Times.
I booked a photographer, just in case.
good.
NBC' s having the Mitch Miller concert on Thursday.
any chance I could show you and Mrs. Draper off?
we' d love to, but...
my kid is sick.
you' ll know what that means soon enough.
shot down.
that was quick.
what do we have today?
the 10: 00 with Miss Holloway to go over traffic for new business, 4: 00 with Ron Venincasa from Ace Hardware, and Mr. Sterling moved the meeting with Boston Edison to 5.
I assume to have it bleed into the cocktail hour.
may I?
there was a bit of confusion last night.
I think I made a terrible mistake.
what happened?
your daughter called and asked when you would be back from your business trip because her mother wasn't sure.
you don' t have to tell me anything, but I didn' t know what to say.
I said Wednesday. I know I should have said I don' t know.
Mrs. Draper is working out some things.
I understand.
I'm sure it won' t come up again.
I thought it would be over by now.
Yes, and there' d be no need to...
I'm sorry about that.
it goes without saying that this is personal, and I' d appreciate your keeping it that way.
of course.
I' d also avoid giving me concerned looks.
Mr. Draper, I hope you' ve noticed I' m a discreet person.
I don' t know you at all, and this is personal, and it' s not up for discussion.
of course.
if you need anything, I'm right out there.
I' m at the Roosevelt if there' s an emergency.
in an interview just weeks before her death,
miss Monroe angrily protested to a reporter about attacks on stars.
" we' re what' s okay with the movie business," she said.
management is what' s wrong with the business.
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olsen and Mr. Romano are here.
send them in.
my oldest just turned 30, and she's had a string of bad beaux.
it' s very upsetting.
can I get you kids anything?
I'm fine. - I' ll have something.
they' re probably walking over.
dress rehearsal, Freddie.
I' ll do introductions.
Jeff Hartung' s wife just had a baby.
Oh. Boy or girl?
that' s good.
then I talk about Volkswagen.
no. Don said we only bring up Volkswagen if they don' t like what we' ve presented.
okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.
thank you, Freddie.
" I just got a brand- new Samsonite Silhouette, " and I hate it.
don' t get me wrong.
" I love the shape, the size, the color," and " I love the Silhouette because it 's a Samsonite, so I know we 're going to go lots of places together ,
see lots of things, collect a lifetime of memories. "
I hate my Silhouette because it's empty.
then Sal.
shouldn' t the artwork come first?
what about unveiling it?
you know how excited they get.
what the hell, Freddie?
what...
what were we talking about?
uh, two types of travelers.
Freddie, do you have another pair of trousers here?
Why?
Oh, Jesus.
Ah, Jesus.
I... I' ll fix this. I...
I need a... I need a minute.
I got to think.
is he dead?
no, he' s not dead. He passed out.
he' s fine.
the Hartungs are at reception.
we' ll be right there. Thanks, Abigail.
he can' t leave this room.
they' re all from Colorado.
I guess I could push it until tomorrow, book them another night at the Carlyle.
should I just cancel it?
I should talk to Don. - That' s not necessary.
I can handle this. - Fine.
Jesus. It' s a suitcase.
Peggy, you can do it, right?
you think it' s going to be better tomorrow?
shit.
it' ll be fine.
we' ll tell them Freddie' s sick.
it' s true.
I'll go to reception.
you two go to the conference room and act like you' ve been waiting.
but don' t look mad.
someone tell Freddie' s girl it' s cancelled.
I don' t want him wandering in.
it' s disgusting.
there' s no need for that.
can I speak to you for a minute?
I forgot you were coming by.
are you okay?
I haven' t been feeling well.
Oh, no, Betty.
you and Don are still coming tonight, I hope.
Oh, we' d love to. I just don' t think I' ll be up to it.
that ruins things.
well, you wanted to borrow the black chiffon, right?
come upstairs. Are you sure?
I don' t know who I'm going to talk to.
Raymond has to work these things.
and I got you out of bed? I am so sorry.
give me the black one, and I'll go.
nonsense.
I think my waist is higher than yours.
what do you have that' s generous?
I don' t know.
how about this?
you' ll look like sherbet. Long white gloves.
I can' t wear those after Gypsy.
think you' ll be better by lunch on Thursday?
I' m looking forward to it.
this is youthful.
it doesn' t matter. I'm invisible.
that's not true.
Raymond' s sweet about it, but he' s so easy to please.
that' s sweet.
it is.
I think, What did I do to deserve him?
then I spend his money on Dr. Weinberg.
I got my diagnosis the other day.
I' m bored.
that' s too bad.
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara, and I have been having ridiculous dreams since.
I wish you' d come ride with us again.
it reall takes the pressure off.
think you can carry this?
no, ma' am.
you shouldn' t talk to him so much.
I know. It' s embarrassing.
it' s a switch you can flip on and off, you know.
Really?
you don' t even think about this, do you?
don' s perfect.
can we talk at lunch?
I' m really not feeling well.
take... Take them all. - Oh, no. Just these two.
that' s it for today.
Many' s the time I' ve dreamed of finding you like this.
what are you doing here?
you' re right. I' ll just get all my belongings, and I' ll leave.
it' s 4: 30. You're supposed to be sitting in a bar somewhere waiting for Boston Edison.
how often do you come in here?
not that often.
what' s wrong, Red?
do you miss me?
she was so young.
not you, too.
Yes, I' m just another frivolous secretary.
it' s a terrible tragedy, but that woman's a stranger.
Roosevelt...
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.
a lot of people felt like they knew her.
you should be sensitive to that.
Hey. You' re not like her.
physically, a little, but don' t tell me that makes you sad.
it' s not a joke.
this world destroyed her.
Really? She was a movie star who had everything and everybody, and she threw it away.
but, hey, if you want to be sad.
one day you' ll lose someone who' s important to you.
you' ll see.
it' s very painful.
are you feeling better, Mommy?
Yes. I' ll join you next time.
I' m surprised Daddy let you in the car.
you kids should go to bed.
wash your face and brush your teeth.
I' ll tuck you in.
good night.
you just came back.
now you' re leaving again?
it' ll go by like that.
come here.
it won't be that long, Salamander.
go.
listen, she called my office.
she did? When?
Monday.
what do you want me to say?
I think she expected you over the weekend.
you said you didn't want me here, and then you do.
I didn't want them involved in this.
obviously, that' s impossible.
what do you want to do?
I mean, how long is this going to go on?
we have to tell them something.
like what?
okay. How about...
I' m working on an account. They' re putting me up in Philadelphia, but I' ll be home every weekend.
Jesus. Did you just think that up?
or I could just come home.
bets, what do you want?
listen, if your mind' s made up,
I' m not going to talk you into it.
I thought you can talk anyone into anything.
good night.
would you like coffee?
and a bear claw.
what' s this?
I thought you could use a few more shirts in your rotation.
thank you. Submit your receipt.
your correspondence is on your desk.
let me get your breakfast. I' ll be right back.
Oh. And Mr. Kinsey said that I have to drag you, if necessary, to the blood drive.
you' re not a fainter, are you?
I don't faint, but I might cry after.
Peggy. - Hello, Freddie.
How' d it go yesterday?
I left word with Abigail. They loved it.
good. Good.
I was thinking about letting you talk anyway.
I, uh...
I have to apologize for putting you in that spot.
Freddie, it' s over.
there' s no reason to talk about it.
of course.
did they, uh, ask about me?
we told them you were sick.
that' s good.
so, uh, on Monday, when they get back to Colorado,
I' ll give them a call and sew things up.
that' s a great idea.
Oh. Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry to bother you.
it' s okay, Carla.
it' s a beautiful day.
I' m going to take the children out again.
is that good?
whatever they want.
can I do anything for you?
if you want, I can draw a bath.
no, thank you.
I' ve been married almost 20 years, you know.
I really don't want to talk about this.
I'm sorry.
I' m s... I' m sorry.
Carla, um...
I haven't been sleep... sleeping very well.
you know what helps?
splash cold water on your face and go outside.
you' ll notice things are right where you left them.
I' m usually part of the meeting before the meeting.
relax, Don. Sit down.
this is all being done in the right way.
well, Don, I' m afraid we have some bad news.
we were on the launch pad yesterday for Samsonite, and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.
what?
he' s not talking about nerves here.
he' s talking about a wet pair of pants.
Really?
How' d the presentation go?
don, it' s conduct unbefitting.
we' re lucky Campbell here grabbed the controls.
he locked Rumsen up and threw Peggy Olsen in.
we' re lucky the bench is deep.
we have to cut him loose.
is that necessary?
the man is a train wreck.
we at least need to get him off this account.
they called already. They' re thrilled with Peggy.
no. I don' t want him on any of my accounts.
this could have happened in a meeting.
but it didn' t.
that' ll be all, boys.
thank you for bringing this to our attention.
we' re not doing him any favors keeping him around.
Duck' s a teetotaler.
he' s been gunning for Freddie since day 1.
he' s got a point.
we can' t even tall Cooper about this.
you know his whole thing with germs.
I don't think it' s in my contract that Duck can fire someone in my department.
you don't have a contract, and I can fire anyone I want to.
we really don't have a choice.
you can still get him to give blood.
the agencies will laugh about this, but the clients, they already think we' re all like that.
we' ll say it' s a six-month leave of absence so he can go for the cure.
he' ll know what that means.
you don't want to throw him away.
your loyalty is starting to become a liability.
let' s do this before he finds out.
we don' t need any more accidents.
dinner tonight.
you need to call the missus?
I' ll make it.
Mr. Case.
how are you?
it' s a beautiful day.
have you just ridden, or are you about to ride?
I can never tell whether you' re before or after.
I' m on my way out.
it' s good to see you.
how are your children?
they' re wonderful.
have you seen Sara Beth lately?
I think so. Monday, maybe?
that' s good news.
I' m glad she came.
Why?
nothing.
I had noticed she seemed distracted.
I shouldn't have said anything.
is there anything I can do?
no. But she' d be glad to know you're concerned.
I think you make her feel better.
she talks about you a lot.
I didn' t mean to embarrass you.
you know what?
the three of us should go to lunch and have some fun.
it would cheer her up.
it' s a great idea.
Thursday?
cafee Soleil in Old Town.
1899/12/31 0: 01: 00
I' ll pick up the check.
see you then.
that was nothing.
I' m thinking of doing it again.
you should smoke a cigarette right now.
I know they said not to, but I' m telling you, my knees buckled.
I thought I was going to perform a full Freddie Rumsen.
Ah, Jesus.
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.
turns out Hollis has a novel.
good.
too bad Freddie made his donation yesterday.
he' s a real wizz in advertising.
Jesus.
what are you doing?
what do you mean?
that' s none of your business.
freddie had a bad day.
can' t you find something else to do besides dining on the drama of other people' s lives like a bunch of teenage girls?
sorry, Don. It' s funny.
sure.
it' s just a man' s name, right?
could you leave us alone for a moment?
truth to tell, I was a little nervous.
I' d never given one of those funny speeches before where you say what you don' t mean.
Freddie, we' ve reached a decision.
you' re going to take a six- month leave of absence.
is that necessary?
the door will be open.
it was a snafu.
isn' t the embarrassment enough?
full salary, you dry out, come back, we' ll see where we are.
clients love me. I keep up with them.
we have laughs.
monday morning, I' ll be good as new, I promise.
there' s a line, Freddie, and you wet it.
you see? We're laughing about it.
what' s the big deal?
you remember Bob Peebles? How mean he was?
he fired his secretary, and he threw all her things out the window, including her keys.
that was good for morale.
what is this about?
he' s as dry as a bone.
he doesn' t understand this business.
Freddie, my father would have fired you for this.
your father drank more than the two of you put together.
he used to come in with his shirt on inside- out.
he admired you.
I, however, had different feelings at the time.
when we first met,
bonny Prince Sterling here thought I was a coward because I was in the Signal Corps.
I didn't know it was only for his last six months.
I thought he was a typist.
turns out before that, he was in charge of killing people...
and by people, I mean Germans.
it was a long time ago.
come on. Be proud.
what was it? Like 15 of them.
that' s impressive.
look, I can be completely in control.
my podiatrist went to Hazleton.
came back a new man with great stories.
only drinks beer now.
it' s the best thing, Freddie.
well, I guess you get dealt the hand you get dealt, right?
I can pull myself together. I got a great book.
maybe I' ll head to Philly or Boston.
they' re all dying to do what we do here.
you know I' ll recommend you.
fantastic. So this could be good.
there are a lot of great towns.
my father sold greeting cards.
he used to come into the kitchen, unroll this map on the table, and put a finger on a spot and say something like, " Memphis. Who wants to live in Memphis? "
I' d say, " Not me."
we had only been in Springfield for nine months.
meanwhile, here we are.
to New York.
come on. Let' s make a night of it.
Really? - Absolutely.
to Monday morning.
it' ll be here faster than you think.
hold off on the menus. We're going to take another lap first.
uh, bring some bread.
give me 5 bucks. - No. Sorry. Don.
can I help you gentlemen?
swordfish.
and who are you here to see?
you can't do that now. I just gave you the money.
come on. Do we look like cops?
sir?
I have a very good friend...
I can' t remember the guy' s name.
how about if I give you our names?
I' m Dick Dollars, this is Mike Moneybags, - and this... - Tilden Katz.
Ah, fine.
here.
that' s a 20.
gentlemen.
is it Milwaukee?
Yes, it is.
son of a bitch.
Ooh. The Chuck- a- luck.
going to need some cocktails.
Hey, isn' t that the champ back there?
for another couple of months.
you' re crazy. Nobody' s going to beat him.
Hey, loosen up.
everything' s going to be okay.
Oh. Just in time.
uh, Canadian Club neat, Wolfschmidt gibson,
granddad rocks.
Pete Campbell, huh?
I would have never thought I was in his way.
you know, you bet badly.
obviously.
no. I mean you win a few times, you got to start really putting it out there.
you kept betting the same thing.
you' re so good at this, why don' t you quit your job?
see? He' s having a great time.
Hello, there.
are we winners or losers?
uh, losers tonight, but winners in general.
you know, BBDO hired a colored kid.
what do you think of that?
I think I' m glad I' m not that kid.
I' m sorry. Can we get you a drink or something?
no.
I' m sorry. Were you interested?
no, I' m fine. Thank you.
I know what' s going on.
you come in too early.
you got dry cleaning moving in and out.
I can' t remember the last time it was you went out spur of the moment.
send off Freddie, I had to send off Freddie.
come on.
I' ve been in your particular situation.
I heard you chaired the blood drive.
where are you, the Stanhope?
the Biltmore? - Roger.
did she kick you out? You leave?
there' s nothing to talk about.
look, people make mistakes.
you feel bad about it. You think things over, and in the end you do the grand gesture for her.
it' ll be easy for you. You're creative.
Roger, will you stop?
all I' m going to say is do you want to be right, or do you want to be married?
I know marriage isn' t a natural state, but you do it.
Why? - I don't know.
kids.
again!
and don' t fool yourself. There are other things.
think about when you met her.
okay. I' m sorry. You're so secretive.
Hey, Don.
if it isn' t the man in the gray flannel suit.
what the hell was that for?
we' re going to go.
don't worry about it.
I' m sure it's not the first time he' s been punched in the face.
Hey, Floyd.
How' d I do?
I' m sure there are 20 people who want to thank you for that.
it wasn' t exactly a fair match- up.
I think that' s going to do it for me.
Yeah. Me, too.
it' s getting late.
this was a nice evening. - Hold on.
don and I are going to the East Side. You take it.
Absolutely.
I' d like to stay and get all sentimental with you, but...
I got to go and give a Chinaman a music lesson.
want to watch how I do it, unzipping the fly and everything?
Yeah. Go to hell.
take him to McCann.
this was fun. - Good.
I' m going to miss you.
you' re talented.
I don' t know.
thank you, Freddie.
it means a lot.
what am I going to do?
what am I going to tell Violet?
I don' t know. It sounded like you had a plan.
I' m not kidding, Don.
what am I going to do?
it' s not an ending.
it' s a fresh start.
if I don't go into that office every day, who am I?
where do you live, Freddie?
152 Riverside Drive.
apartment 604.
no matter what he says, take him there.
good night, Freddie.
good- bye, Don.
see, I find if I stick with the clear liquors, vodka, gin...
I know where I stand.
I' m the opposite.
so what do you think, because you gave blood, the whiskey made you a little angry?
that was a real Archibald Whitman maneuver.
who' s that?
this hothead drunk I used to know.
Jimmy Barrett' s a weasel. Enjoy.
so what' s going on with you?
I'm at the Roosevelt.
see? That wasn't so hard.
I really don' t want to discuss it, Roger.
why, because you feel so bad? I' ve been there.
no, I don' t feel bad at all.
I mean, sometimes...
mostly, I' m just relieved.
Really?
do you fall in love?
no.
that would be easier.
then I' d know what to do.
easier...
there' s some incredible woman, and someone' s going to end up with her, but it can't be you.
why not?
because we' re married.
I don' t know.
it' s your life.
you don't know how long it' s going to be, but you know it's got a bad ending.
you have to move forward.
as soon as you figure out what that is.
two coronaries.
got to move forward.
it' s your life.
I mean, this can' t be it, right?
we' re in it together, huh?
that' s true.
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
that was quite a presentation you gave.
the Samsonite people are thrilled.
Oh. That' s good to hear.
they' ve requested that you be reassigned as the copywriter on their account.
what about Freddie?
Freddie' s decided to take a few months off.
he did? When' s he coming back?
it doesn' t matter.
you' ll be taking over all of his business.
are you sure?
you know, I really don' t like walking into an ambush from Duck and Pete Campbell.
I don' t know why anyone had to know about that.
even me?
no, of course you, but...
I just thought that...
I love Freddie.
what' s your point?
don' t feel bad about being good at your job.
I wish it hadn' t happened this way.
that' s the way it happened.
Congratulations.
miss Olsen... - In a minute.
you couldn' t keep your mouth shut. - Mr. Campbell.
do you know what you did to Freddie Rumsen?
for just cause. - You didn' t have to tell Don.
you told on Mr. Rumsen? - Do you mind?
it would have gotten out anyway.
right, and he' d be some legend in one of those stupid stories.
you remember the guy who wet his pants before the big meeting?
instead, he' s finished.
why do you feel bad for him?
those people always blame their problems on society.
he did it to himself. Those people have no self- control.
if it wasn' t for him, I' d still be a secretary.
if it wasn' t for me, you' d still be a junior copywriter.
I refuse to feel bad.
we' re going to get raises. You could get his office.
now, I' ll go first.
congratulations, Peggy.
congratulations, Pete.
good to see you.
this is me.
it' s nice to see you.
what are you doing here?
Betty invited me for lunch, uh, but we're going to need another place setting.
we're going to be three.
Betty didn't say you'd be joining us.
I hope I' m not intruding.
she thought it would be fun.
it will be.
it's just gotten infinitely more fun.
I think I need whatever you're having.
it's a gin and tonic. Nothing special.
it's perfect.
keep stirring.
Bobby, go get two spoons.
so with Indian Point open now, we should be able to use even a modest safety record.
we were spitballing about a cartoon turtle.
kids... keeps it friendly and nature-loving, and then we just hammer the Ravenswood area until they're ready for the next plant.
you on board with that?
Yes.
I want to see schedules, and I want to see this turtle.
he doesn't want to be disturbed.
Hello, Don.
Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.
just stop.
what?
I don't even know what to say to you.
about what?
don't act innocent.
he' s leaving me for his secretary.
he' s in love, and you said it was great.
Mona, I didn't say anything.
it' s your life.
you have to move forward.
Mona, I didn't mean it that way.
25 years of marriage.
I want you to calm down.
don't make me make a scene.
we should talk about this.
you can talk to Margaret.
listen, Don, I can explain.
I want her off my desk.
I was expecting the Piersons as well, but they're not coming.
please.
Oh! My goodness.
of course. Here, take mine.
I appreciate that both of you are here.
what happened?
the children were at the water fountain during gym and Sally told Becky Pierson she should save some for the fish.
Becky ignored her.
Sally hit the back of her head and her face went into the spigot.
and then Becky went after her.
hair pulling, scratching.
she didn't need stitches in the end, I understand?
this girl-This Becky Pierson, Sally told me she's a bruiser.
she's heavy.
the children poke pencils into her sides when she's sitting because they think she can't feel it.
Sally doesn't do that, does she?
no.
but this bad behavior is new.
I know that you're expecting a child, but she already has a little brother.
I guess what I'm asking is, has anything changed at home recently?
my, um.
my father passed away last week.
the week before two weeks now.
I feel terrible for bringing that up for you.
well, it-it has not been easy.
is this grandpa Gene we're talking about?
Oh, that poor thing.
Sally didn't mention it?
why didn't you call us or send a note?
I don't think she missed a day.
did she go to the funeral?
why would we put her through that?
I don't think children belong in graveyards.
no, of course not.
now I realize why she was asking all those questions about Medgar Evers' murder.
she was?
I'm sorry.
I have to use the ladies' room again.
we can talk about this another time.
no, I'm not as upset as I look. I can't help this.
I am mortified.
it's not a good time.
no, and it really should be, shouldn't it?
Sally does need more attention.
she's grieving.
there is a very special pain to losing someone at that age.
I don't know if you can understand that.
I can.
Mrs. Draper, I was just talking to your husband and this really can wait.
are you sure?
because I just want to put it behind us.
I just really want everything to be okay when the baby comes.
it's going to be a beautiful summer.
hat-check tip 50.
dinner ，$19. 44.
it's better to have a bit of Don Draper than no Don Draper at all.
I'd like that in writing.
it seems strange that the two of you went on the same overnight trip and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.
if I were lying, wouldn't I have made it a round number?
not that Don's lying.
I signed his receipts, didn't l?
which brings us to the undocumented portion of my assessment.
the amount of pencils, pens, pads, paper and postage that are currently being consumed suit a company four times our size.
it has also been brought to my attention that a credenza has disappeared.
a theft that I believe necessitates a conspiracy.
people forget that Karl Marx was the greatest economist who ever lived.
and whatever you think of his solution, the problem he posed was about the catastrophic up and down of the marketplace.
tell the folks at admiral that Karl Marx says everything's okay.
boom and bust. Bull and bear.
I need a TV. I have a TV.
damn it, Paul, someone helped Ken cherry-pick all of Burt's successful accounts and I've been left with the dogs.
Admiral is not a dog.
sales are flat. It's all over their memos.
and now I have to look then in the eye with nothing...
except maybe new creative.
stop it.
now you're interested.
there are some areas of growth, and I mean literally areas.
atlanta, oakland, chicago, detroit, newark, D.C. Great jazz cities.
and I left out St. Louis and Kansas city-- Also growing.
what does that mean? - Great jazz musicians?
seriously, is it possible that these Admirals are being bought by negroes?
Lois caught her scarf putting paper in the xerox.
maybe when joan leaves I can finally get rid of her.
can you pretend like you're back in the media department and tell me what this says to you?
look at the cities.
is it possible that negroes are outbuying other people 2: 1?
you could jump to that conclusion, I suppose.
did you hear about Lois?
you've got a winner there, Kinsey. Did you see it?
I did.
so what's everybody doing tonight?
baby. Married. Kinsey?
do you want to go to the Mets game?
tickets and a watch.
why, thank you, birds eye.
does the watch say "birds eye" on it?
no, it says "hamilton electric."
what time is it?
what time isn't it?
Admiral is happy. We're happy.
they're not happy!
Morris, comma, in reference to retooling the factory for London fog children's and young adults.
I thought I'd bring you the minutes of the meeting, since you had to run off.
you're wasting paper.
I'd have to make 1, 000 to keep up with your department.
they waste paper because they throw out bad ideas.
they waste paper because they use it to sop up spilled drinks right after their mid-afternoon naps.
you came here because we do this better than you, and part of that is letting our creatives be unproductive until they are.
pennies make pounds, and pounds make profits.
Oh, I don't want to talk to you this way.
I've tried it before and it never works.
I'm not usually this emotional.
you want to make money?
start getting your nails dirty with Bert Cooper and Harry Cane.
clients love to pay for media and creative needs pencils.
I suppose I hadn't necessarily thought of it that way.
and lay off of expense accounts.
think of the men's moral, not just your own.
you've obviously seen "bridge on the river kwai.
I've seen everything.
you have my ticket stubs.
your uncle Herman is on the line.
he won't leave a message.
uncle Herman?
my goodness, is aunt Alice all right?
who is this? - It's Peter, Dottie's boy.
you called me. - It's duck-- Duck Phillips.
duck. - Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
I didn't want to set off any alarm bells.
my name is Herman, you know that.
except that I actually have an uncle Herman and he's 91.
that's a sick joke. I apologize.
it's been too long.
I don't know if you heard, but I'm at Grey now.
what's that like?
people walking around the halls all the time, laughing their heads off?
we're going to have lunch, you know.
I don't know, Duck.
it doesn't sound like a good idea.
Campbell, this is beyond "no hard feelings."
I won't waste your time.
haven't I always been on your side?
when? - I'll have my girl call your girl.
I'll say it's Clorox.
Hello?
anyone home?
I'll get it.
hello. - Mr. Draper?
Yes.
this is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher.
I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?
no.
I just felt I should call and apologize about our meeting this morning.
Why?
well, I..
what I mean is my father died when I was eight and I might have overdone it, relating to Sally in that way.
I didn't mean to upset your wife.
I guess I can get a little caught up in things and lose perspective.
I don't know why I'm calling.
I'm embarrassing myself.
no, you're fine.
if there's anything I can do-- - Don?
thanks for the call.
it's time to go.
okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.
they're in your hand.
Francine took the kids.
who was that?
no one.
if you're parked in emergency, you'll have to move soon.
of course, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.
this is my third time.
we sent you home before? - No, third baby.
your job's done.
the solarium's down the hall to the right.
hang in there, Betts.
I came in early to cover for a friend, so there's a chance I'll see you the whole way through.
daddy!
you can scream and yell as much as you want in this hallway, but we're about to pass the nursery.
of course.
excuse me.
I know it's silly, but I seem to be having trouble with this pen.
I believe it's empty.
I've gotta go.
are you planning to give the baby the breast?
no.
the last time you ate? - Lunch
toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.
pineapple?
what were you thinking?
anything else, sweetheart?
life savers.
has your water broken?
my water never breaks.
when will Dr. Aldridge be here?
I'm dennis hobart.
that's good to know.
I haven't seen anybody an hour.
what's going on?
well, we've had a shift change.
my wife Pam, Pamela Hobart.
she's fine. The baby's breech.
we're calling in a specialist.
what?
didn't somebody get your permission?
damn it, what is with you people? I don't know a damn thing!
please don't raise your voice.
now I apologize, but we need your permission.
do whatever you have to do.
we'll update you religiously. I promise.
this is not how I pictured it.
Where's all the backslapping?
you know, I brought this because I thought it'd be a party in here.
it's not, but I'll have one.
right now?
whenever you want.
I left work this morning.
I've been here all day.
I am so bored.
I even called in.
like the prison can't run without me.
have you done this before?
twice.
you know, I never thought to bring a bottle.
well, what are we supposed to do?
my daughter took forever.
I remember being pretty worked up.
the nurse said, "don't forget，your wife's in the boat, you're on the shore."
the other one a boy?
Yes.
you throw the ball around?
not enough.
all right, Mrs. Draper, I'm going to need you to get on the bed so I can prepare you for delivery.
this part should be familiar.
I'll shave you and then give you a quick low enema.
well, the good news is time has stopped.
I'd like to have a gold watch one day, but I can't, you know?
you don't want to have anything on you like that.
do they attack you?
I knew it was just a matter of time before you started with the questions.
I bet you have a nightmare where you end up in Sing Sing, right?
everybody does.
I do.
so what's it like?
you're outnumbered, but you've got the power.
kind of like being a king.
except your subjects want to kill you.
maybe, but they don't cause they know I'm dangerous and I've got a badge, which they respect.
how do they know you're dangerous?
well, they're not all bad.
there's extremes.
we've got death row and then we've got the baseball team.
in '29 they played the yankees.
everybody in stripes.
you're a funny one.
Oh, I tell a lot of jokes at work.
you hear some doozies.
I have to watch what I do when I leave work, be careful not to bring it home.
especially with a kid, right?
just yesterday I was in a block and I thought "every single one of these animals, their mother had them, they were a baby."
and I think, "there they are, on the other side of the fence."
and you know what?
every one of them blamed their mom and dad.
that's a bullshit excuse.
that's true, Don.
you have little veins.
breathe and think about the beauty parlor.
do you need to call someone else in?
it's in.
the medication will help with the pain and put you in a twilight sleep.
where is Dr. Aldridge?
he's in the city.
he went to mama Leone's for his anniversary.
isn't that sweet? - Is he drinking?
cause my aunt emma, her doctor was drunk, and he ruined her bladder.
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician, is on duty and will fill in.
I don't want him. I don't know him.
he's our top man. - I want Dr. Aldridge.
you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
I don't want another doctor. I want my doctor.
sit back. You're at 5cm.
that's halfway from here to the Hebrides and other mountain ranges which we are currently studying in chapter 12.
the doctor will be here and there.
the Hebrides are islands.
try it now.
thank you, sister.
what do you make her for? 16?
Pam was screaming at me in the car.
don't think that's unusual.
that's my girl in there.
if something happens to her, I just don't know what I'd do.
and then there'd be that baby. How could I love that baby?
our worst fears lie in anticipation.
you're so sure about that?
I want to go home, you bitch!
please relax.
let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don? - He's in the waiting room.
she can't hear you. - The hell I can't.
where is he? Where's Don?!
he's in the waiting room.
bullshit.
he's never where you expect him to be.
have you seen him?
have you been with him?
7cm. She's starting transition.
someone call him.
I don't want to be here.
a push of demerol, 25mg.
I'm just a housewife.
why are you doing this to me?
Mr. Hobart?
Congratulations. You have a little baby boy.
Oh my god.
your wife and your baby are doing fine.
can I go in? Can I see her?
not right now.
she lost a lot of blood and had a transfusion.
what? Oh, please, I have to see her.
please, she's in recovery, resting.
but you can go to the nursery and look in at your son.
it's just down the hall.
thank you.
a baby boy.
Congratulations.
you're all right, Don.
I'm sure yours is gonna be good too.
you know what?
I know it.
Thanks, Dennis.
you're an honest guy.
believe me. I'm an expert.
go see your baby.
why do they put up with us?
we don't deserve it.
this is a fresh start.
I don't know who's up there, so I'm saying this to you.
I'm gonna be better.
I'm gonna be a better man.
tell me you heard me.
I heard you.
don't fight the urge to bear down.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't do it.
either you can do it or we will, but it's going to come out some way.
daddy?
who are you? - It's me.
I don't know you.
it's me-elizabeth.
you do know me.
okay, so it's me.
what are you doing here?
I had to go away.
well, don't you Miss me?
of course.
listen.
nobody knows I'm here, okay?
am I dying?
ask your mother.
tell her, Ruthie.
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.
you'll catch flies.
I left my lunch pail on the bus and I'm having a baby.
do you see what happens to people who speak up?
be happy with what you have.
you'll be okay.
you're a house cat
you're very important and you have little to do.
she's beautiful.
that's a boy.
you look terrible.
how do you feel?
I need to put my face on.
you look beautiful, Betts.
what did you say?
his name is Eugene.
we don't have to decide that now.
did you get any sleep?
no, and I don't expect to for the next six months.
I wasn't sure where to put it all.
Mr. Draper's office.
please hold.
it's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?
daddy.
where are you? - Down the hall.
how's Betty? Did she perform like a champ?
she did. - I need his initials.
Jane's gonna put them on the back of her yacht or something for him.
no name yet.
there's a lot of guys twiddling their thumbs down in art.
why were you in the art department?
lane was.
apparently we're all backed up.
no one will move forward without your approval.
I missed half a day.
well, Betty had the baby, not you.
I'll see what I can do.
good.
that guy's a tick.
see you at the traffic meeting.
can I get some coffee?
you know what it's like in that office.
no one ever buys me lunch.
I like the turtleneck.
Really?
come. Join us.
what is she doing here?
don't worry about it. I know what I'm doing.
no, you don't.
have a nosh.
two months at Grey and you're already having a nosh?
I didn't know until I got here.
look.
I woke up one day and had a realization.
you two have a secret relationship.
what? That's ridiculous.
come on.
the way you handled that Freddy Rumsen thing so that she could move up?
I've been doing this a long time. I know what I saw.
that's not what happened.
you can be modest if you want to, but that kind of focused ambition is rare in advertising.
thank you.
I want to take you both with me to the promised land.
at Grey an account man is expected to have ideas, and creatives are expected to be geniuses.
you'll be sitting on velvet pillows, showered with riches, awards.
we're not going anywhere.
well, she can.
do we have to go together?
Pete, I know you have ideas and you're a risk-taker.
sterling Cooper is never going to reward that.
well, thank you.
anything else? - Don't be a baby.
you should be taking meetings like this twice a week.
if you want to woo me, you'll have to buy me my own lunch.
maybe I should leave too.
why would you do that?
you're so talented.
you should strike while they iron's hot.
what does that mean? - It means the sky's the limit.
no mortgage, no family.
you're a free-going career gal with great ideas.
am I wrong?
I don't know.
this is your time, Peggy.
let me ask you something, Hollis, what type of TV do you have?
an RCA. - Really?
color?
why did you get it?
to watch TV.
but why an RCA specifically?
I didn't see any difference, I guess.
16.0
good afternoon.
a lot of negroes prefer Admiral.
I've done research.
I have an RCA.
so do your friends buy Admirals?
I'm sorry, sir. I can't really say.
look.
this is important and I'd really like to have an honest conversation with you.
I don't want to get into trouble.
it's just us.
it's just hollis and-- - Mr. Campbell.
do you think I'm a bigot?
I just want to know why you bought your TV.
I don't know. I don't remember.
it's your TV.
it's a big purchase.
I don't even watch the damn thing.
Really? Why not?
why should I?
we've got bigger problems to worry about than TV, okay?
you're thinking about this in a very narrow way.
the idea is that everyone is going to have a house, a car, a television
the American dream.
it's my job.
every job has it's ups and downs.
you don't watch baseball?
I don't believe you.
what are you doing out of bed?
I smelled something.
what are you making? - A snack.
do you want some? - Uh-huh.
I didn't know you could cook.
mommy's much better at it.
are you looking for a chick?
I am.
miss Farrell told us about that when we went to the farm.
but she says that those eggs can never become a chicken, even though they come out of a chicken.
Why's that?
because they're from the store.
and you know what else?
if you hold an egg up and it has veins in it, you can shake it then eat it.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
it's called addling.
is the baby gonna live in grandpa Gene's room?
it's not grandpa Gene's room.
it's the baby's room.
I thought it was gonna be a girl.
well, I thought you were gonna be a boy.
not all surprises are bad.
everything's gonna be fine.
that's what miss Farrell said.
well, then I guess it must be true.
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified.
building security-- That's all I'll say.
confirm a couple of rumors.
did he throw a desk chair against a window only to have it bounce back and knock him over?
not that I know of.
did he make a #2 in a file cabinet?
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.
so Harry here is an expert in media.
Television-- The air, not the sets.
now Admiral television sales are flat...
we know that.
...but as we studied your indices we realized that they're not flat everywhere.
in fact, among negroes sales are actually growing.
we know that too.
you do?
no, of course you do.
these are your numbers, but I think we've discovered an interesting strategy.
this is "Ebony."
by negroes for negroes.
jet.
space in these magazines costs far less than what you currently spend
daily newspapers that go just to this market for pennies on the dollar.
And?
shift a portion of the media budget from lower-indexing white areas to this market where it can do more good.
they already like it and we can make them buy more by increasing the exposure.
a 5% sales bump in Detroit alone would make you the same profit as a 2% increase systemwide.
and ads on television geared to this market and white markets will have double the effect.
a negro ad and a white ad?
so, Campbell, you're making twice the ads for us now.
no, do them together.
integrate it.
I don't think that's legal.
of course it's legal.
look, this conversation is not worth having.
who's to say that negroes aren't buying Admiral televisions because they think white people want them?
miss Olson is here to see you.
send her in.
Oh, sorry.
I know he doesn't need clothes, but don't return it.
I'm the youngest. I never had anything new.
you didn't have to do that.
I did.
no one told me they were all going in on it together.
I heard you were back at work, but now I wonder if that's true.
I invited you in.
I don't know if this is the best time.
I don't know. It's kind of serious.
I've been thinking about my situation here and I'm so grateful to you for all you've done.
I just...well,you know I'm paid very little.
my secretary doesn't respect me because I make $71 more a week than she does.
maybe we need to get you a cheaper secretary.
paul Kinsey doesthe same work that I do, and not as well sometimes.
and I don't know if you read it in the paper, but they passed a law where women who do the same work as men will get paid the same thing.
equal pay.
it's not a good time.
it's not a good time for me, Don.
do you know how expensive the city is?
it's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.
I'm fighting for paperclips around here.
third time.
it must be old hat.
you're gonna be fine, Peggy.
I look at you and I think "I want what he has."
Really?
you have everything, and so much of it.
I suppose that's probably true.
what do you want me to say?
I don't think I could have been any clearer.
you see what's been going on here the last six months?
what if this is my time?
Hey.
where are you going?
to the ladies' room. You want to join me?
did you tell Don about Duck?
that's none of your business. - Sure.
they hear you're shopping around, they'll want you more.
but me, I'm sharing my job with Kenny.
I'm already redundant.
you have relationships with your clients.
that's leverage. - Did you say something?
it's my decision, Pete.
your decisions affect me.
if it isn't Martin Luther King, I shoud drop kick you off the roof.
Admiral television has no interest in becoming a colored television company.
but they are.
it seems illogical to me that they would reject an opportunity to make more money.
then again, I'm in advertising.
this is a sensitive issue.
businesses hate that.
let me put it in account terms.
are you aware of the number of hand jobs I'm gonna have to give?
am I being taken off the account?
I'm going to have to pretend I had you killed!
sales are flat. I had to do something.
I don't know if anyone's ever told you that half the time this business comes down to "I don't like that guy."
are we done with the flogging?
it's never as good as you think it's gonna be.
if I may.
Burt, Roger, it does seem as though there's money to be made in the negro market.
obviously not with Admiral, but I don't think it would be wrong of us to pursue it in some way.
Really?
I've just moved here.
I'm a stranger in a strange land, but I can tell you that there's definitely something going on.
we'll look into it.
you can go.
we're here! -she's here! - Mommy! Mommy!
welcome welcome.
mommy!
Ooh, careful.
here, let me take him.
I missed you so much.
wait till you see your fridge.
if there's a power outage, you can feed the entire street for a month.
Hi, baby. I'm your brother Bobby.
remember: you have to be careful.
how was it?
you know.
it Was all a fog.
you're making a mistake not forcing Carla to stay.
she's been away from her family, and I can manage.
I know some girls.
you want something to eat?
sure. - I've got it.
come on.
Hello?
do you ever pray on a difficult problem?
I had this revelation
new York city is not a domestic destination Like say Dallas.
I'm sorry. What?
you know, god speaks to us.
we have an impulse and we act on it.
that's very interesting. - How do we know to do it, Don?
how do we know too something?
instinct.
so you're just like a dog?
I knew the patina of the Waldorf Would shine over all my domestic properties,
but it hasn't worked abroad.
I know I just gave you New York, But can you help me with that?
you want me to take your international business, Connie?
I want you to earn it.
a little bit of "wow," As a lady friend of mine used to say.
let me think on that.
it sounds like pride, but I want Hiltons all over the world,
like Missions.
I want a Hilton on the moon. That's where we're headed.
okay.
america is wherever we look, Wherever we're going to be.
that's very good, Connie.
you're the one who said that to me.
well, I guess it's not that memorable.
write up a proposal for the New York Hiltons as convention spaces
and send it over to me by noon.
I'll take it on the plane. - Done.
goodbye.
I'm sorry about that. - It's okay.
I don't think the 4: 00 AM Feedings are over yet.
I want what I want when I want it,
and you don't care what it does to the rest of us.
like someone else I know.
the baby's up every three hours. Hilton only calls every four.
I think you like it.
what are you doing?
I can't sleep. I'm going in.
what are you doing?
I'm running. - In the dark?
it's cool, it's quiet
and no one bothers me.
you're wrong about that.
let me give you a ride. Where are you going?
I'm going home, And the whole idea is to run there.
well, take a break. Do you smoke?
take me up to Ross Lane.
don't.
when school starts, I'm going to read it to the kids the first day.
do you think they can understand it?
I think they already know it
and it'd be nice for them to hear an adult say it.
who are you?
I mean...
dumb or pure?
running out here in the middle of the night and I run into you.
how did that happen?
what are you doing on the road?
I don't know. I can't sleep.
right or left. - Just let me out up here.
it's a nice house.
I rent the apartment over the garage.
have coffee with me. - You'll be late for work.
I'm always late.
it's coffee.
maybe that's why you can't sleep
too much coffee.
good morning. - Oh.
sorry.
how long have you been there? I had no idea.
can you get me some coffee, please?
and I need you to type this up And get it to Hilton before he leaves for Europe.
actually, he's going to California.
he already left two messages on the service. Do you want me to get him?
this. Coffee. Hilton.
of course.
Mr. Draper usually brings this in.
he left early.
can we go outside now? - It's raining. Go upstairs.
I did not sleep last night.
go take a nap. I'll shop in the afternoon.
it could either be the view of the acropolis,
or just these big columns, like you're standing there.
then below it "your window on the world."
hilton, Period.
that window looks as old to me as those columns.
did anybody look at a picture of the Athens Hilton?
sliding doors don't read as windows.
and believe it or not, we're not allowed to pretend that
that's the view from the window of the Hilton, because it's not.
other than that?
the tag is flat.
well, that one's yours.
that doesn't make it good. If it's bad, don't use it.
what else? - Uh...
there are 16 graphically perfect Reduced photographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid,
a simple headline.
you go. We'll meet you anywhere.
now that I can finally understand you,
I am less impressed with what you have to say.
that's your work too.
who is "we"? - "We" are Hilton.
and how do I know that?
take out a magnifying glass and look at one of those tiny hotels?
I write "Hilton" very big under this Greek.
there is no deadline.
I want to see work as you think of it. Give me more ideas to reject.
I can't do this all by myself.
I'm telling you it's bad for me.
what's that supposed to mean?
and cut!
well, I think we've finally got it.
I told you-- You had it the first time if that's what you want.
and I told you I want what you want.
where is he supposed to be looking? - Onto the horizon.
we want people to focus on the lucky.
this is what your father signed off on.
let me see it again. - Nathaniel, again, please.
watch through the camera.
that's a good idea.
action.
I just don't know what he's looking at.
I want him staring right at us at the end.
there's a style for the draw on these spots,
and it's stop, inhale, thousand-Yard stare.
tell me what you think.
I think you're the client and we should do what you want.
it can make people very uncomfortable.
Walter Cronkite does it every night.
now let's take a risk together, shall we, Sally?
going again.
this time, Nathaniel, on the draw Look right in the lens.
we have to get a pencil case.
what's wrong with your pencil box?
how was the first day?
I wish I could've found the camera
just so we could see the difference on your face from when you left this morning to when I picked you up.
so you like your teacher? - She's okay.
it's Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.
is this today's mail? - Uh-Huh.
I'll get him. - Would you?
you're so quiet. You must be tired.
I'm not tired.
I really want a pencil case to put in my loose-Leaf.
we'll see.
cut.
so it's a rhythm? - That's true.
obviously it'll sound better with the announcer's voice.
it sounded like you had half of a pastrami in your mouth.
it's a scratch track.
I didn't know you were going to show it to the client.
I know I'm supposed to stay away till the screening,
but I am fascinated by this process.
Oh, you're thinking about getting out of cigarettes and into the movies?
not while my father's alive.
well, if we rerecord the sound tonight, We can probably finish this.
I heard you the first time.
I'll be in the booth.
I'd appreciate it if you'd...Forget all that nonsense I was saying before.
what are you talking about?
the movies, my father.
forgotten.
sorry, but I had a long, wet lunch.
Oh, really? Too much to drink?
and other things.
secretaries nowadays, they don't give you a choice.
you know what I mean?
I don't have a secretary.
how'd my shot turn out? - I'm not sure.
I think it's gonna feel strange.
lucky Strike has a way of doing things.
look at this.
hmm. Yeah, see?
I don't think that's so bad.
come on. He's not coming back for a while.
I'll lock the door.
I'm married.
so am I.
there's been a misunderstanding.
I know what I know.
Jerry should have the tracks done.
you can see the whole thing tomorrow or when it's done.
I'll probably be busy tomorrow.
I've got it. You're at work.
that's too bad.
Henry, I'm so pleased there's a place That I can write to you.
the children are finally back in school now
and I must admit that I like the idea of looking forward To the mail's arrival every day.
well, not every day. Ha ha.
I don't write many letters anymore,
so I apologize in advance If I'm unable to accurately express my thoughts.
but I do have thoughts,
and I suppose I wonder too much where you are and what you're doing.
we've only met three times, you know that?
isn't that strange?
I wish I had a clearer picture of you in my mind.
anyway, that's all I have to report.
I hope to hear from you. B.
don't touch it. - I've seen this one.
it whitens. - It's not about what you want to watch.
I have to make sure they run every commercial.
my mother-In-Law says I look like Perry Mason.
it's not a compliment. It means she thinks you're fat.
it's Lee Garner.
I knew you'd still be there.
you work hard, don't you? - For you? You bet.
look, I don't want to keep you, But I have a bit of a problem.
what's wrong?
it's that Salvatore Fella, the director.
he's no good. I'd like him gone.
Oh. What happened? - I can't work with him.
get rid of him.
well, I can't do that. - Excuse me?
no, I'm not-- Really, I can't.
Pete and Roger handle your account.
no, no. No, no, no, Harry.
I want you to take care of this
and I want you to keep it just between us.
crane, are you there?
listen, Lee.
I hope you know the commercial's turning out beautiful.
you really have an eye, you know.
I do, do I? - Are you enjoying the city?
I am. Plenty to do.
well, you have a good night.
I should get back to work. - Sorry to trouble you.
good night. - Good night.
what was that? - You don't want to know.
I think I do.
I can't tell you.
now I really do.
lee Garner Jr. Asked me to get rid of Sal.
what did he do? - I didn't ask.
he was drunk as a skunk and he's scary to begin with.
what are you gonna do, call Campbell?
that's the other thing. He said to keep it between us.
what are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna panic and do something stupid like I usually do.
that's a good start.
I can't really do anything, can I?
he was really drunk.
the show's on.
great, I missed all the commercials.
Hello? - Don, it's Conrad Hilton.
is it? - Now don't be like that.
I know it's a privilege to call you at home.
I don't think I've worn it out.
it's 11: 30.
it's not a problem, Connie.
can you come have a drink with me?
right now?
you can say no. I've heard it before.
and for all you know, you're not the first person I asked.
I'll be there.
give me an hour.
Hello?
so what is that, moonshine?
no, but it is from prohibition.
I have two cases and they both say "hair tonic" on the side.
I remember this.
I think you know I'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.
I didn't know that.
I think about my business day and night
and I'm a harsh critic, especially of myself.
and sometimes it collects and I feel bad.
and then I realize
maybe that's the reason I'm so lonesome.
you might be working too much.
I'm not working enough.
it's my purpose in life to bring America to the world,
whether they like it or not.
you know, we are a force of good, don,
because we have god.
the communists don't.
it's their most important belief. Did you know that?
I'm not an expert.
generosity.
the Marshall plan-- You remember that.
everyone who saw our ways wanted to be us.
I'm glad you're telling me this.
after all the things we threw at Khrush Chev,
you know what made him fall apart?
he couldn't get into Disneyland.
that's good.
you never heard that?
well, I did, but when I hear you say it sounds beautiful.
I don't want any politics in my campaign. You know that.
but there should be
goodness and...
confidence.
thanks for listening to me, Don.
you know, sometimes I look around here,
and I think "By golly, I'm king Midas."
stop it.
you're not.
you're my angel, you know that?
you're like a son.
in fact,
sometimes you're more than a son to me,
because you didn't have What they had
and you understand.
thank you.
I mean it.
come in, come in, come in.
I drove all the way down to get the mail, And then I turned around and I debated it.
I went past the exit a dozen times.
my girl is due back.
I know I shouldn't be here.
it's just I wanted to see you.
I wasn't thinking.
what do I say? Why are you here?
Oh, there you are.
Carla, this is Henry Francis.
he works for governor Rockefeller. - It's nice to meet you.
so anyway, I, uh
I think this is an excellent venue for a fundraiser.
Oh. Good.
I'll have to check with my husband. - Of course.
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out?
I think I left the bath running.
a pleasure to meet you.
I-- I can't get this. Lucy, do you mind?
Jesus. Knock it off.
it's a lucky strike commercial. It's got three cuts in it.
so the hillbilly says, "That aren't my finger."
I'm gonna have to hear the beginning of that joke.
what's going on? - I-- I have no idea.
does someone know what's going on? Speak up.
I know.
lee Garner Jr. Called me a couple of days ago. I'm sorry.
why is he calling you?
I don't know.
he did and he told me to get rid of sale.
what?
and you made an executive decision to do nothing?
he was really drunk. I thought it would blow over.
I didn't even think he'd remember.
when you get in trouble, you call mommy and daddy.
he told me not to tell you, so what was I supposed to do?
everyone's an account man. What exactly do you think we do here, Crane?
we handle clients.
he wouldn't say a word. He just left.
Sal, you're fired.
are you serious? - Lee Garner Jr. Wants you fired.
we're gonna find out what he wants to do with you, imbecile.
Oh god.
what the hell happened?
what is going on?
now you're gonna use your dying breath to tell Don to fix this.
lee Garner has a problem with creative, Let Don solve it. He does it all now anyway.
now!
what did Lee say to you? - Nothing. I have to talk to Don.
let me talk to Don. - I'm doing as I'm told.
is he busy?
I can see you and I can hear you. What do you want?
who died?
I... screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.
what? - How do I explain this?
he told Harry to fire me. - Harry?
I didn't, but now Roger did.
Roger did what? - He fired me.
Roger said to tell you to fix it. Those are his words.
fantastic.
that's a $25 million account you stuck your nose in, Crane.
just get out.
what happened?
lee Garner got drunk and he told Harry to fire me.
then Roger got angry and he did.
I think if I get away from Lucky Strike
and lay low from Roger for a day or two, everything will be fine.
I understand what just happened. What happened with the cut?
Oh, the commercial's fine.
Sal, something must've happened.
I can't help you unless you tell me.
we... had a misunderstanding.
Jesus. I'm not gonna ask again.
he was drunk and he cornered me in the editing room.
cornered you? - Yes.
and I backed him off,
I told him I was married, He was embarrassed and he left.
you must've been really shocked.
I was, believe me.
but nothing happened
because nothing could've happened because you're married.
don, I swear on my mother's life.
are you sure you want to do that?
who do you think you're talking to?
I guess I was just supposed to do whatever he wanted?
what-- What if it was some girl?
that would depend on what kind of girl it was
and what I knew about her.
you people.
I didn't do anything but turn him down.
he's a bully.
lucky Strike can shut off our lights.
I think you know that this is the way this has to be.
you'll do fine.
get me Lee Garner Jr.
I said I don't want salad.
watch your tone, young man.
Carla works for me, not you.
what do you want instead?
you might as well call it a day.
okay. Thank you.
Hi, daddy. - Hi.
how was your day?
not good.
I didn't want to bother you with it,
but that man dropped by today from the governor's office.
Carla met him.
Francine sent him over here.
they want to have a fundraiser, but her house isn't big enough.
I don't care, as long as I don't have to go.
when is it? - Well, I should be going.
soon. Next week, I think.
a fundraiser for Rockefeller.
for the campaign.
I'm gonna go lay down.
good night, Carl - Good night.
good night, children.
good night. - Bye.
good night, Mrs. Draper.
if you're here, do I have to be here?
because I'm leaving.
no, go ahead.
good night, boss.
Henry Francis. - Hello.
I thought I'd get the service.
this is Betty... Draper.
I know that.
listen, I shouldn't have come by like that.
I hope I'm not calling too late.
no, you're not.
I checked with my husband about the fundraiser.
the fundraiser?
Yes, we'd be glad to do that.
how's Tuesday the 17th?
can you make it then? Is that good for you?
okay.
I guess you're going through with this.
I had to.
I'll have my girl call you tomorrow to make it official.
I look forward to it.
let me know what's usually provided by the host.
sure.
goodbye.
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo are magnificent destinations
and that's really been the focus of almost every campaign You've had up till now
how to lure the American traveler abroad.
what more do we need than a picture of Athens to get our hearts racing?
and yet the average American experiences a level of luxury that belongs only to kings In most of the world.
we're not chauvinists.
we just have expectations.
well, now there's one word that promises The thrill of international travel
with the comfort of home:
how do you say ice water in Italian?
how do you say fresh towels in Farsi?
how do you say hamburger in Japanese?
it's the same in every language.
maybe fried chicken.
I don't like the sound of "hamburger" and "Hilton."
besides, "hamburger" is already a foreign word.
we'll see.
it's good.
very good.
it's clever, yet friendly.
it draws you in.
but what about the moon?
excuse me? - There's nothing about the moon.
well, right now, that's not an actual destination.
that wasn't the point.
I said I wanted Hilton on the moon.
I couldn't have been more clear about it.
well...
I'll admit I misunderstood that.
I'm sure there's a way to fit that into this.
well, isn't this something?
I'd like to speak with Don in private.
this is a good campaign-- One of the best.
it's modern, it's witty, it's eye-Catching.
it will change your business. - Calm down.
I'm going to speak very honestly with you.
I don't think folks do that often.
probably scared. - Or they trust my work.
you want me to just say yes to everything you do?
most ad men believe That clients are the thing that gets in the way of good work.
I've never experienced that.
you did not give me what I wanted.
I'm deeply disappointed, Don.
this is a great campaign.
fine.
what do you want from me? Love?
your work is good.
but when I say I want the moon,
I expect the moon.
I said if he ran, I'd support him.
I haven't decided yet.
I voted for Kennedy. I'll probably vote for him again.
what a nice turnout.
Where's Henry Francis?
I don't know. Someone's supposed to talk.
I don't know anything about Rockefeller. That's why I did this.
well, I want to know how he's going to deal with the south.
do you know how bad it must be for the negroes to descend on Washington like that just to be heard?
segregation is uncivilized. It's that simple.
you know what my father says about the south?
it's not 1963, it's 1863.
Oh, thank you.
uh, Mrs. Draper, I'm Elsa Kittridge.
I work with Mr. Francis. - Pleasure to meet you.
I assume he's been delayed.
actually he asked that I address the group on behalf of the governor.
Oh.
that's disappointing.
I mean, I don't think it's going to help your fundraising
when you promise one thing and deliver another.
well, perhaps you're right,
but he seemed to think I was a better match to the group.
and I am extremely informed.
in fact, I'm the person who briefs Mr. Francis.
I think you'll see I won't embarrass you in front of your friends.
please, begin whenever you want.
Oh no, you begin, dear.
excuse me, my name is betty Draper.
welcome to my home. We're going to listen to
Elsa Kittridge, associate in the governor's information office.
first I would like to dispel the rumor that there is a mandatory contribution tonight.
this is a taking of a pulse, An exchange of ideas.
please see that we're not disturbed.
Hey!
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?
no, Marjorie, I dropped something.
where were you last night? - Calm down.
why didn't you come? Why did you send that-- That woman?
I watched the door all night like a sap.
I'm sorry, but I wanted you to come to me.
Oh, the ego!
would you listen to me? You had to come to me.
and why is that?
because you're married.
no, Henry.
what's wrong? - Please.
we're locked in this office.
what? On the desk? On the couch?
we should get a room somewhere. - No.
it's tawdry.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry I started this.
I don't know what you want.
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.
send him in.
I heard Conrad Hilton left this building in a huff yesterday.
who told you that?
you've got your face So deep in Hilton's lap, you're ignoring everything else.
everything's under control.
you won't even let me meet the man.
what do you think accounts does, Besides limit your brilliance?
I'd tell you, but I don't want to hurt your feelings.
keep joking about it.
we've had two clients in one week leave here angry-- Important clients.
is that what you want this place to be known for?
that and some guy losing his foot in a lawnmower?
I want to put you on notice you are in over your head.
these children
Unoffending, innocent And beautiful
were the victims of one of the most vicious And tragic crimes
ever perpetrated against humanity.
you can leave it on your station. I don't mind.
it's all right. - What was that?
the funeral service for the little girls in Birmingham.
it's so horrifying.
are you okay?
do you need a day off?
no, I'm fine. Thank you.
I hate to say this,
but it's really made me wonder about civil rights.
maybe it's not supposed to happen right now.
Hello, Mr. Draper. - Hello.
you just missed bedtime.
they're probably still awake.
no, don't bother with dinner.
we've got Chinese takeout.
listen, Marty needs me to look over this work.
don't wait up for me.
I love you too.
what?
hilton just called.
I'm going in.
I didn't hear the phone.
go back to sleep.
someone's going to see you. - Then let me in.
this is nice.
what can I do for you?
I don't know. I wanted to talk.
right.
says the man as he unbuckles his pants.
what do you want me to say?
you've been flirting with me for months.
so what?
so I can't stop thinking about you.
because I'm new and different.
or maybe I'm exactly the same.
tell me you've run past that stretch of highway In the past two weeks and not thought of me,
not looked for me.
but then I have the luxury of that last half-mile home
where I go through every step of the future until it ends.
I know exactly how it ends.
so what?
you live two miles from here.
your daughter was my student. I've seen your wife in the market.
I don't think you've done this before this way.
I want you.
I don't care.
doesn't that mean anything to someone like you?
they sell it at Woolworth's.
there's a section that says "Halloween costumes.
you'll wear it once.
plus it's made out of plastic and it's crap.
I'm always gonna love Minnie mouse.
I'm gonna be an astronaut.
didn't you hear me? The luggage.
I'll go get it. - That's not the point. They Don't listen.
there's more? It's a week.
we're going for a week? Are we gonna miss Halloween?
they have Halloween there. You'll go with your cousins.
say goodbye to your father, then get the bags.
Ooh!
they have a Woolworth's in Philly, too.
I only have $40.
swing by the bank.
there should be at least $200 in your checking.
that's plenty. - You have no more money?
take care.
Roger, I think you remember... - Annabelle.
you look wonderful.
you look exactly the same.
this is Annabelle-- What is it again?
I can't tell if you two know each other or not.
don Draper. - Hello.
please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.
how the hell were you in town and not look me up?
I wasn't sure about coming back here.
I'm running the company now.
you divorced what's-His-Name? - No, David died,
and because of my father's will the company went back to me.
Oh, I'm sorry. - Mmm.
51 years old. Lung cancer.
that's too bad.
so-- - So yes, if you're open to it.
caldecott farms, I'm sure you've heard,
had a public relations crisis followed by disastrous sales.
I hadn't heard. - "The misfits," the movie-- Clark Gable.
it was about horses being turned into dog food.
there was an expose.
we were singled out. I don't know why.
you don't know why?
she owns a horse farm that makes dog food.
we had a 15% share of the market,
but now Benton & Benton has dropped us for gravy train.
well, that was a mistake.
well, people eat cow, but they call it beef.
chicken is poultry. Pig
we've got it, sweetheart.
well, there is no other word for horse-Meat.
I thought maybe you could invent one.
what do you think, don? - I think it's a tall order.
do you have to use horse-Meat? - All dog food is horse-Meat.
people eat it all over the world.
I've eaten it. It's delicious. It's like venison.
I've eaten it.
well, I'll tell you what I'm telling the avenue:
best idea gets my business.
how long do we have?
I'm in town until Friday, But only the big firms are rushing.
well, I'm not gonna sit here and brag about how big I am.
I have two simple rules.
I don't want to change the recipe. It's all meat.
and two, my father named it Caldecott farms.
don't change the name. Don't change the product.
got it.
walk me out?
we had their business before, but her father was a son of a bitch.
you know, people spend more money on dog food than baby food.
I'll put the fellas on it.
is that really necessary?
you've never walked in high heels.
no, coming in here.
what are you doing here?
I wanted to see you and I need something new...
I'll bet you do.
...for my business.
besides, you're married, aren't you?
I am. - Still or again?
you know it's again, and don't get cute.
I heard she's a teenager.
probably too jealous to let you have a business dinner with me.
gonna need a reason.
because I know you're good at this
advertising, I mean.
tomorrow night. Somewhere French.
all the lights were on. I figured you'd be home.
I knew you were coming over,
it might be dark when I got home
and I didn't want the Mckays to see you turning on the lights.
that's very thoughtful.
I'm making spaghetti with cream, butter and cheese.
and hot pepper? - Yes.
I had it like that in little Italy.
Oh. I love that place.
believe it or not, I get treated very well there.
Oh, I wish I could take you there.
I know.
don, I swear I'm not talking about our future.
I entered into this with my eyes open.
I pushed you.
what does it matter?
here we are, And I look at your life.
and even if I remove myself from the picture,
I see a man who is not happy.
I'm happy now.
what?
okay.
okay.
I'm going to lie down.
come get me when you want to.
why did I decide to leave surgery?
these last few months have been difficult,
but I found a reserve of strength in myself I didn't know I had.
I realized there are other ways to heal people besides cutting them open.
what experience have you had with psychiatry?
well, that's kind of personal.
Greg, remember what Steve said
this is a field about the most intimate details in life.
more intimate than their organs?
you know, I'm curious why you won't answer the question.
what is your experience with psychiatry?
none personally, but my dad had a nervous breakdown.
I didn't know that. - Yeah, no one was buying furniture.
my mom ran away for two weeks because he wouldn't get a Christmas tree.
a headshrinker got him through, but we weren't allowed to talk about it.
Greg, that's wonderful.
it was a lot of things, Joan.
no, answer like that. This is a talking profession.
the way you just were with me right now, so open,
he's gonna love you.
the most important thing about an interview Is to express enthusiasm in a believable way.
no self-Deprecating humor.
you're smart. You're funny. You're great to be around,
but you haven't decided if they're the right one.
this isn't a beauty pageant.
well, I've seen executives crash and burn.
I can't believe I never told you that.
Hey.
I just...
wanted more than I thought I would want.
but it'll pass.
actually, I know for a fact it will.
I don't want it to pass.
one day I dropped the kids off at school and I saw you in the yard.
I kept wishing for you to get in the car And drive away with me.
just let it go.
I'll clear my schedule.
we can go to mystic or something for the rest of the week.
I can think of someplace if you're serious.
I am.
okay.
Oh, damn it.
hello. - Roger, it's Joan.
Joan Harris. - Jesus.
you're lucky I answered. Ginger's not in.
I know. She has a hair appointment the last Tuesday of every month.
she does?
and I know that your lunch canceled. - What am I wearing?
so how are things?
Mr. Hooker has rearranged the secretaries In the pool alphabetically.
by cup size?
well, I know where you'd be sitting.
you're making me sorry I called you.
I need a favor. I need help finding work.
something happen with Dr. Cut up? - Not at all.
he's pursuing his dream of becoming a psychiatrist,
but that means more training and I just don't want him moonlighting all the time.
why does it matter?
it doesn't. None of my business.
why don't you come back here? - Roger, I've been replaced
and a secretary makes less money than if I was working at a department store.
I'm so glad you called me.
I'm sorry it had to be for a favor.
no, I like that you thought of me
you know, to ask.
you want to be on some people's minds.
some people's, you don't.
that's nice. - So do you miss it here?
are you asking if I miss you?
well, I guess I am, because everything else is different.
I should go. - Well, how do I work this
if I think of anybody? Just give them your number?
look at you, figuring things out for yourself.
bye bye, Joanie.
look who's here.
I'm sorry I missed the funeral. My grandson was graduating.
it was beautiful. - Mmm.
Judy fixed lunch. We don't have to talk right away.
I don't have a lot of time.
Betty wants to know what the house is worth.
I'm a lawyer. I'm not a real estate agent.
well, the house was left to both of us.
I don't understand why I shouldn't be able to buy it away from her at double what dad paid for it.
they bought it in the late '20s.
dad always said it was the top of the market.
your father intended you to get as much money for it as you could if you were going to sell it.
otherwise, somebody has to buy somebody out.
so basically dad gave it to Betty because he knew I didn't have any money.
this is ugly. You know that?
Milton, I need to speak to you in confidence.
I need your advice.
I need complete confidentiality.
it's my husband.
I just found out Some compromising facts.
he, uh-- He's been married before
and he
well, it's not even his real name and he bought her a house-- His ex-wife.
I-- I need to know what to do.
I don't know him, Betsy. I met him at your wedding.
I know your father didn't want him in the will.
so? - What do you want to do?
do you want a divorce?
in new York state you need to prove adultery. Can you?
maybe. - I mean prove it in a court of law.
that's hard to do.
unless he wants out, but you're not gonna get anything.
you won't even be able to buy William out of the house.
you'll have to sell it.
and he can take the children.
that's my legal advice.
do you want the rest of it?
are you afraid of him? - No.
is he a good provider?
well, he is, but that's not the point.
it's a lie so big, Milton.
I feel like I've been in some dream since I found out.
just saying it out loud to you
this is the first time I'm realizing it's true.
you have three small children together.
at least go home, give it a try.
that's what I'd tell my own daughter.
damn it, Betts! This isn't right!
look, he waited.
this is number three.
what do you want?
I'm going to have one of those lovely wines.
why did you have two? Are you nervous?
she'll have one of those lovely wines.
Bordeaux.
don wants to call in a focus group right away.
that's enough business.
I want to know everything that's happened In the last 20 years.
longer.
it wasn't until years later
that I realized you were the only person I could remember that time with.
what do you want to remember?
what I was like at that age,
Paris before the war,
eating in cemeteries.
people were jumping out of windows and we were on vacation.
I don't remember much.
are you trying to tell me when you saw "Casablanca" You didn't think about me?
you mean Peter Lorre?
you seemed so happy to see me and now you're just being... drunk.
we were not in "Casablanca.
the only similarity is that you left me for another man.
when she gets on the plane at the end?
that woman got on the plane with a man who was going to end world War II,
not run her father's dog food company.
you were adrift. You didn't do anything but spend money.
you walked around like you were hoping to be a character in somebody else's novel.
the boxing.
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to your reasons.
believe it or not, I still remember them.
Oh, Jesus, where's the wine?
I don't like the way you're looking at me.
how am I looking at you?
with pity.
I finally found a beautiful carefree girl unconcerned about the future.
I was more serious than you. - Well, I got mine.
I married Mona, joined the firm
and then I got shipped off to the pacific for the duration.
when I came home I went to work while you were watching "Casablanca."
and I got blamed when we lost the account.
all I heard was my father said Bert cooper had a screw loose.
look, you're rich.
let someone else take your horse-Meat and slap their label on it.
and do what?
Oh, I don't want a whole bottle. - I'll help.
and I told him the closest we ever got to Hemingway
was sitting in a chair he once sat in.
and that was in the '20s, not the '30s.
and then he said he remembered me
because I was the one who'd introduced him to peanut butter.
Yeah, I never understood that. They had peanuts in Europe.
no one ever thought of that?
look at us. - Oh, will you stop?
Roger, do I look like a widow?
you look great.
you still want me.
so what?
I'm married
Newlywed-- Honeymooning.
how could I have missed the window between Mona and her?
there really wasn't much of a window.
it kind of overlapped.
well, I was there first.
we'll just take this And tack it onto that.
I'm gonna get you a cab.
are you afraid I'll be disappointed? You were always good drunk.
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.
it's different with this girl.
I'm sorry.
good night.
how'd it go?
I screwed up all my answers
and I tried to talk about the articles, But I couldn't remember anything.
I made a fool out of myself.
I am sure that's not true. - You weren't there.
stop acting like you know everything.
you'll have other interviews. - I don't want them.
I don't want to be a psychiatrist.
it's not medicine.
I might as well work at a bank.
I don't care what you do as long as you do something.
we need money.
I did everything I was supposed to do,
everything they told me
college, med school.
I wanted to be a surgeon since I was that big.
I'm sorry, Greg.
maybe it's time to move on.
Hey, you don't know!
you don't know what it's like to want something your whole life,
to plan for it, to count on it and not get it!
okay?
Ah! Oh, shit?
what the hell?!
you're insane! You know that?!
why isn't he wearing a white coat?
he looks like a dog-food salesman.
dogs don't like uniforms.
well, we're lucky. Everyone has an appetite today.
they said we should bring them hungry,
but he does seem to like this.
how would you describe your dog's temperament?
she's picky, and she's nervous sometimes, - But she's very smart. - And yours?
he's independent, you know?
he knows what he likes. He's pretty hard to fool.
Oh my god, they're describing themselves.
this your first group?
what if I told you your dogs were enjoying Caldecott farms?
what's it called? - I wouldn't like it.
bingo, stop. - I've never heard of it.
well, you should. They make it out of ponies.
goodness gracious. That's this one?
this is the first I'm hearing of this. I wish you would've told me.
when people are protesting, I'm on board.
well, what brand does your dog prefer?
why would you do this to us? - It's inhumane.
bingo looks sick. - Turn it off.
could somebody get that? - I can't turn it off.
it's actually happening. - Turn off the sound.
I already know how people feel. It's your job to change that.
any agency that does not change the name is stealing your money.
the product is good-- It's high quality, dogs love it-- But the name has been poisoned.
that name got us where we are.
do you think that was just luck?
I'm not saying a new name is easy to find
and we will give you a lot of options,
but it's a label on a can.
it will be true, because it will promise the quality of the product that's inside.
well, I'm going to wait it out
and not for these morons, but for another agency to solve my problem.
Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.
the name is done.
it's unfair, but it's over.
Annabelle! - Are you ready for the next group?
I don't like the way you're speaking to me.
everybody out.
is this about last night?
I don't even remember last night.
Oh, well, you threw yourself at me and I turned you down.
I'm right. You want to hurt me.
no. No, I don't.
you want to know if it was a great time?
it was.
do you want to know if you broke my heart?
obviously.
well, it was a mistake.
it's nice to hear, but it doesn't matter anymore.
it does to me.
when I was burying this man,
all I thought was I'd have rather had My heart broken every day by you.
you were the one.
you weren't.
well, you're lucky you found her.
I think it's about four hours to Norwich,
but the Norwich inn might be a little past it,
and we can check in till midnight. We'll be fine.
I'll be right out.
daddy?
I'll be right back, salamander.
daddy!
I left my hat in the car.
get it later.
I need to talk to you.
go upstairs. - We want to say hi to daddy.
upstairs.
you're home early. What did William do now?
not right now, Don.
why didn't you just call the office?
I came home to feed the dog and change shirts.
I have a client dinner in the city.
I need to show you something.
what's going on? - Open this drawer.
Betts, that's my desk.
open the drawer or I will.
fine.
Betty, this is my desk.
it's private.
where did you get these?
you left them in the pocket of your bathrobe,
but I could've had a locksmith in here anytime I wanted.
I respected your privacy too long.
open it.
no.
you know I know what's in there.
I can explain.
you didn't have to look at my things.
which things, Don?
the pictures covered with other people's names?
is that you?
Dick-- Is that your name?
people change their names, Betts.
you did. - I did
I took your name.
and so did this anna woman, whoever she is.
I can explain. - I know. I know you can.
you're a very very gifted storyteller.
Betts, I
I need a drink.
are you thinking of what to say or are you just looking at that door?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll get you a drink. Just sit down.
you bought her a house.
where do you want me to start?
what's your name?
but it used to be dick Whitman.
and who's that woman? Your other wife.
it wasn't...
romantic.
I ended up married to her because I ran away to join the army.
there was an accident.
this guy was killed and I was injured.
but they made a mistake.
all I had to do was be him and I could leave Korea.
be who?
you took his name?
Yes.
isn't that against the law?
Yes.
I found out it was easier to be him than to start over.
it turned out he was married to that woman, so I took care of her.
and then I divorced her the minute I met you.
you divorced her on valentine's day, 1953
three months before we got married.
why didn't you tell me?
why couldn't you tell me any of this?
when? The day we met?
on our first date? On our wedding night?
why did you need to know? - You don't get to ask any questions.
you have a family.
no, I don't.
all this time I thought you were Some football hero who hated his father.
I knew you were poor.
I knew you were ashamed of it.
I see how you are with money. You don't understand it.
I was very poor.
did you see her when you were in California?
I did...
and she reminded me that I loved you.
what would you do if you were me?
would you love you?
I was surprised that you ever loved me.
am supposed to feel sorry for you?
I don't know.
you obviously wanted me to know this or you wouldn't have left your keys,
you wouldn't have kept all of this in my house.
say something.
I didn't think I had a choice...
and I don't know what the difference is.
this is our house and those are our children.
well, there's a big difference
you lied to me every day.
I can't trust you. I don't know who you are.
Yes, you do.
we're not done.
Betts, I'm in here.
how is he?
he kicked his blankets off.
sit with me.
this was my father, Archibald.
but this
that's not my mother.
my mother was a 22-Year-Old prostitute who died having me.
this woman
Abigail, Archie's wife
she raised me.
when I was 10,
arch died and we moved.
and Abigail took up with him
uncle Mack.
he was nice to me.
what happened to them?
they're all dead.
even Adam?
the little boy in all the pictures.
I assume he's your brother.
he was my half-Brother.
and he died.
he killed himself.
he came to me because he wanted help...
and I turned him away.
he didn't even want help. He just
he just wanted to be part of my life...
and I couldn't risk all of this.
he hung himself.
I'm sorry. I am.
Bob, how are you?
listen, I've got a favor to ask you.
I know this girl-- Actually you met her once
well, Harris. Redhead.
Yes, she's beautiful.
anyway, she's expensive, but you're always complaining About needing someone to whip your place into shape,
so think about it.
Yeah, I want to help her out.
she's important to me.
Oh, jane's fine. Thanks for asking.
don't be a stranger.
I'm sorry, Joanie.
and I'm gonna buy you another vase to put those in.
I'm gonna buy you a lot of things.
it's not about buying things.
I know, I know, but I've been an ass,
feeling sorry for myself because I couldn't solve this problem.
and it was so easy, Joanie.
the answer was right in front of me.
I joined the army, Joanie.
you're gonna be taken care of. We're gonna be taken care of.
and the best part is I get to be a surgeon.
they need them.
you joined the army?
I know I should've asked you, but I'll do six weeks of basic training. That's it.
I'll do my residency in new York.
and then what? - And then I might have to go somewhere.
west Germany, maybe Vietnam if that's still going on,
but a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere, especially if they have families.
and I'll go in as a captain. Do you know what that means?
you don't have to work anymore.
I don't know what to say. - Oh, Joanie, please tell me this will make you happy,
because it will make me happy to give you everything you want.
it's wonderful, Greg.
and no more soup.
get your coat. We're going out.
do you want something?
are you gonna have something?
daddy, are you going to "trick or treat"?
Yes, of course.
I'll see you tonight.
I didn't think you were coming in today.
I canceled my plans.
do you want me to reschedule Your lunch with Jeff Stansbury at united fruit?
no, I have plenty to do.
hello. - I stopped by earlier.
no one answered. - I was running all morning.
about last night-- - What happened?
did you get caught?
it's more complicated than that.
so I suppose I'm not going to see you anymore?
not right now.
no.
are you okay?
only you would ask about me right now.
do I have to worry about my job?
no.
okay.
I should go.
goodbye.
goodbye, Suzanne.
he's home! Let's go!
Shh. You'll wake the baby.
do I look like a gypsy? - Yes.
let's go, let's go!
do you want anything? - No.
should I take the carriage or just carry him?
it's cold out there.
you can stay here with him or I can.
no.
good.
what's taking so long?
trick or treat!
well, hello there. Look at this.
we've got a gypsy and a hobo.
and who are you supposed to be?
sorry I'm late.
that's okay. I was occupied.
how are you today, don?
I'm well, connie. Thank you. How are you?
I'm afraid I have some serious business to discuss.
have a seat.
I was at mccann erickson yesterday,
and they let me know
that effective January 1, They're buying putnam, powell & lowe.
what?
I'm sorry, but that means I'm going to have to Move my new york properties elsewhere.
Why?
because P.P.L. Owns sterling cooper.
you're all gonna be part of mccann.
so we're all gone.
sterling, I don't know.
Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.
but you're a prize pig.
you'll make more money, pick up stock.
you won't have to live and die with every account.
Bulls---.
it's a sausage factory. I turned them down three years ago.
this happens all the time, don.
it's business.
I'd ask them to put you on the caribbean hotels,
but I don't think I'm gonna stay there much longer.
you come and go as you please.
Yes, I do.
and you don't give a crap that my future Is tied up in this mess because of you?
you wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.
and you wanted to play with me
kick me around, knock me down to size While you called me son.
I get it now, connie.
it's business.
you know...
I got everything I have on my own.
it's made me immune to those who complain And cry because they can't.
I didn't take you for one of them, don.
are you?
some other time we'll try again.
Yes.
have a nice holiday.
69? A bushel.
that's half last year.
we ain't gonna make it.
it's as fair a shake as we could get,
considering that allotment act made no allotment for wheat.
you were supposed to get us a good deal.
there's a surplus. What the hell's he supposed to do?
well, I ain't selling at that.
you've got no choice. - Sure I do.
I've got a silo.
store it till winter when the price goes up.
how you gonna pay your mortgage? - That's none of your concern.
settle down. We're all in this together.
no, we ain't, thanks to you.
I take care of mine. You take care of yours.
damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.
no more.
now get out of my kitchen.
what's so urgent that you had to wake me?
Conrad hilton told me p. P.L. Is being sold and us along with it.
Oh.
so you knew about this? - No, but it makes sense
all that short-Term thinking.
so what do we do?
there's nothing to do. I have a contract.
you have a contract. Roger has a contract.
so that's it?
you're losing your business and you don't care?
I lost my business last year.
well, do something about it.
if sterling cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P. P.L?
we could put everything back the way it was.
young men love risk Because they can't imagine the consequences.
and you old men love building golden tombs
and sealing the rest of us in with you.
you're done. You know that, right?
so I should just throw away my fortune?
I don't have the rest of my life to earn it back.
I understand.
I'll let you get back to sleep.
why do you care?
because I'm sick of being batted around like a ping-Pong ball.
who the hell is in charge? A bunch of accountants trying make $1 into $1. 10?
I want to work.
I want to build something of my own.
how do you not understand that?
you did it yourself 40 years ago.
that's true.
but I'm not sure you have a stomach for the realities.
try me.
well, we're gonna need accounts.
american tobacco, that's most of sterling cooper.
but that's roger.
I understand that.
did hilton tell you when this blessed event is supposed to take place?
new year's day.
we have to talk to roger now.
you talk to him.
do you want to do this or not?
honey.
honey, he probably feels bad About the president getting shot on his watch.
now stop reading the paper.
she's obsessed.
it's the most intere That girl's ever had in a book depository.
McCann is buying P. P.L.
and is absorbing sterling cooper along with it.
what?
Conrad hilton told me this morning.
Christ.
from one john's bed to the next. What a joke.
don and I have been discussing the idea That we buy the company back.
Really? Why?
because we don't want to go to mccann.
and now you're sniffing around because I have A golden pork chop dangling from my neck.
it's more than that.
you know bert's done for.
now it's about bert, huh?
I want to see what you look like with your tail between your legs.
you sold your birthright so you could marry that trollop.
here we go. This is your pitch?
well, move along.
I'm not gonna throw it all away Because he doesn't want to work at mccann.
do you want to work there?
you don't value what I do anymore than they do.
I was wrong.
I learned that with hilton.
I can sell ideas but I'm not an account man.
you're not good at relationships because you don't value them.
I value my relationship with you.
you do now. - I do.
I'm sorry. I've got points, stock.
if I'm useless, so be it.
there's a deck chair somewhere with my name on it.
you're right, roger.
if you've lost your appetite, you should retire.
of course, I've seen that before, so have you.
men my age, even younger
they play golf, go on vacation,
lose their appetite.
in three years...
join or die?
Jesus, bert, he was doing better.
you know it's true.
you're still gonna outlive me.
we have to try.
so you do want to be in advertising after all.
go upstairs.
daddy just got home.
I'll be up.
do you want me to go too?
please sit down.
I made an appointment with a divorce attorney
and I suggest you do the same.
come on, Betts.
what are you doing seeing a lawyer?
I want to be civilized about this.
please don't act surprised.
you haven't been yourself.
maybe you need to see a doctor-- A good one this time.
because I'd have to be sick to want out of this?
you've had a tough couple of weeks.
we all have.
I've had a tough year.
I felt I should tell you Rather than just let you get a phone call at work.
well, forget it.
I'm not gonna let you break up this family.
I didn't break up this family.
lane, please shut the door and have a seat.
certainly.
we know mccann erickson bought P. P.L.
and we know that makes sterling cooper chattel.
who told you that?
someone outside of this building who knows.
well, they're wrong.
lane, we've worked next to each other for a year.
don't act like a stranger.
we've got tea.
well, I suppose you'll find out soon enough,
but your information isn't completely correct
only sterling cooper is being sold.
P. P.L. well, will remain p. P.L.
that doesn't change our plans. We want to buy back the company.
we're willing to offer the purchase price plus 12%.
it's worth more than that now.
what did you get? - I'm not going to say, but more than that.
I apologize you had to find out this way.
believe me, it wasn't my decision.
I've quite enjoyed it here.
well, they've only got me for a year.
you for what, three?
we'll make another run at it.
the only grounds for divorce in this state
are absence of a spouse, incurable insanity, Life imprisonment or adultery.
well, he hasn't been faithful.
do you have any witnesses or corroboration?
not really.
it wouldn't matter anyway with both parties at fault.
n-no.
we haven't-- We aren't-- - Ken. Ken, what are you doing?
you think the governor needs another scandal on the ticket?
I am sorry for presuming, mrs. Draper.
that was wrong.
so what do I do?
I know it's hard to understand,
but the state of new york doesn't want anyone to get divorced.
that's why people go to reno.
it's painless.
I met my second wife.
you stay there for six weeks to establish residency.
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,
just consent.
I see.
we need to discuss what you want in terms of settlement.
whatever I'm entitled to.
give us a second.
you don't need what he can provide.
Henry, I have three children.
I'll take care of them and I'll take care of you.
I don't want you owing him anything.
we want to get this done as soon as possible.
saint john, I'm glad I caught you.
what is it?
Mr. Sterling, cooper and draper have learned of the sale.
what do they know? - It was a mixture of truth and half truth.
they knew about mccann,
but they were under the belief that p. P.L. Was being sold as well.
and what did you tell them? - That they were wrong.
they even want e to bid for sterling cooper
12% above our purchase price.
listen, I apologize, Lane.
obviously the news is getting out.
what news?
P. P.L. Is being sold as well.
what?
why wasn't I told?
didn't seem pertinent.
trying to keep our company calm as well as theirs.
well, where's my place in this?
with mccann, I suppose.
there there, Lane.
they know you're essential to the transition.
and then what? - You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.
you always do.
yes?
don't be disheartened.
I'll put in a good word for you.
thank you.
no, thank you.
we've got a month till winter, then we'll be set.
this is what I showed the man from the bank today.
what are they gonna do, sell this place?
the bank's gonna get their payday right after me.
we got nothing and we're about to have less.
fine!
I'll sell.
I'll sell my crop for nothing.
what are you doing?
I'll drive it to chicago tonight.
you're drunk.
go. He can barely stand.
calm down.
whoa. Here.
calm down.
it ain't gonna rain.
daddy! Daddy!
your guests have arrived.
close the door. Have a seat.
what's he doing here?
you gonna read us your will? I want the cadillac.
I couldn't sleep.
and I thought, why don't we go to mccann directly?
because you can't. It's done.
you're not even gonna ask?
I did, yesterday.
and you were right-- P. P.L. is being sold,
so it seems we're all going to mccann.
they cut you loose.
I want you to find out what the price was and give us a shot.
enough.
I should fire you for even trying to involve me in this conspiracy.
go ahead. It's the only thing you did well here.
don, let it go. - I did a great many things here.
have another.
it's 9: 30 for god's sake.
Jes, that's right.
you have absolute authority to fire anyone.
fire us.
fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.
can you do that? - Why would I?
because once this sale goes through, you'll be thrown overboard
and you'll be a corpse knocking against their hull.
nothing good ever came from seeking revenge.
nonsense. We'll make you a partner.
I should think this is worth more than that.
so we're negotiating.
we'll put your name on the door. - I don't know.
do you know how to do what he does? - I don't.
it could be done,
but getting you-- us out of here isn't the difficult part.
we need accounts.
let's say we have lucky strike.
and although that's, let's see, - $23 million in billings-- - 24.
we'd still need another third for cash flow.
I can't take anyone else Or lee garner sr. Won't think that he's special.
what about Hilton? - No.
can we get any of our other accounts?
we'll get them.
if I were to send a telex in at noon today That you've all been sacked,
it's after close of business in london.
it would remain unnoticed until monday morning there-- 2: 00 a. M. Here.
that gives us today and the weekend
to first gather accounts and then a skeleton staff to service them.
and of course we would have to obtain all the materials Required for continuity of service.
obtain?
we he to steal everything.
anyone approached must be a certainty.
if news spreads, they'll lock us out.
do we vote or something?
well, gentlemen,
I suppose you're fired.
we'll, it's official.

first they're cleaning the carpets, now they're not.
why are you here?
um, work.
Hey, everybody, harry crane is here.
relax, Pete, we're expecting him.
what's going on? - Why are you here?
I'm sorry, what's going on?
P. P.L. Has been sold to mccann. We're starting a new agency.
we'd like you to join us as our new head of media.
are you kidding?
Yes. Yes, we a. Happy birthday.
we need your answer.
I should really call my wife.
Mr. Crane-- Harry,
this matter is secret and time sensitive.
if you turned us down and elect to be A mid-Level cog at mccann erickson,
we'll have to lock you in the storeroom until morning.
I'm sure you understand.
we were hoping you could decipher these job sheets.
where exactly are these materials?
I never look at these.
can't we just take everything?
that's good thinking, but we don't know where anything is.
no one knows how this works?
let me make a phone call. I'll take care of this.
no. No more conspirators. - I'll be discreet.
Where's Don?
what did we do?
nothing.
then why are we in the living room?
we want to tell you something because
well, it's going to be a little bit of a change.
your father is going to be moving out.
now, we'll still be living here And he'll come to visit.
then why is he going?
because...
it'll just be temporary.
like when you lived in the hotel?
Yes. - It'll be different.
is it because I lost your cufflinks?
no, it has nothing to do with you.
that's not what I mean.
I love you both. You know that.
then why are you going?
I'm not going.
I'm just... living elsewhere.
that's going. You say things and you don't mean them.
you can't just do that. - Sally, sweetheart
go away. - Sally, stop it.
you said you'd always come home.
I will.
it's just a different home.
will you be here for christmas?
you'll get to have two christmases.
I only want one.
did you make him leave?
no.
we both decided.
you made him sleep in gene's room, and it's scary in there.
listen to me, both of you.
I will be here.
you can call me, I will answer and I will be here.
let her go.
please don't go. I don't want you to.
nobody wants to do this.
I need you to be a big boy.
you look awful.
can I come in?
do you want anything?
Yes, I do.
you were right.
I've taken you for granted And I've been hard on you,
but only because I think I see you as an extension of myself.
and you're not.
well, thank you for stping by.
please.
sit down.
do you know why I don't want to go to mccann?
because you can't work for anyone else.
no.
because there are people out there who buy things,
people like you and me,
and something happened
something terrible.
and the way that they saw themselves...
is gone.
and nobody understands that.
but you do.
and that's very valuable.
is it?
with you or without you, I'm moving on.
and I don't know if I can do it alone.
will you help me?
what if I say no?
you'll never speak to me again.
no.
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.
what is she doing here? - I said I'd be discreet.
tell them what to do.
I made a list and I called some movers.
can you read these? Do you know where this stuff is?
Yes. Of course you'll need the job bags on all these accounts.
we'll also need logo files, all the film we can find
and negatives which aren't actually here.
there you go. - Very good.
now I can pack.
sorry I'm late.
Hi.
Joan. What a good idea.
well, you're here. Who did you bring?
north american aviation, secor, Jai alai, samsonite.
Clearasil. - Really?
I made it.
where do we start?
well, I'd start in the art department.
it's locked.
great.
I'll start in my office.
Joanie, I can't read your writing.
it's perfectly clear-- "Correspondence."
Oh, I'm tired.
Peggy, can you get me some coffee?
no.
did you wash your hands?
hold the elevator.
Greg is going to kill me.
I'm at the roosevelt, but I'll need you to find me an apartment.
furnished? - For the time being.
sorry. Good night.
go ahead, fellas.
how long do you think it'll take us to be in a place like this again?
I never saw myself working in a place like this.
don't bother.
we've been robbed!
he's waiting on the line. It's his third attempt.
saint John, how are you?
what in god's name is going on over there?
I think at this point it should be very clear.
you're fired.
you're fired for costing this company millions of pounds.
you're fired for insubordination!
you're fired for lack of character!
very good. Happy christmas.
Mr. Hooker.
I've been sacked.
please have my office and things put in storage at this address.
what's happened?
you're a sharp boy. You'll figure it out.
so let's see. I have Peggy and Pete sharing the desk.
don, we'll replace one of these couches with a table for you,
and we're adding two additional phone lines.
media will be in the bedroom with the television.
accounts gets the bed.
and no one is to come to this office.
if you have meetings, please take them elsewhere.
I don't want them in the lobby or the bar of this hotel.
well, look at that.
good morning.
sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. How may I help you?
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.
he didn't leave a note-- Nothing.
where is he?
I just heard from John Deere
Pete tried to poach them on saturday.
he must have gone with Draper.
damn it.
sure.
everything is exactly the same.
don and I will both be on the account.
Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye bye.
Hello, everybody. - Lovely, what are you doing here?
I brought lunch. There's every kind of sandwich imaginable - And a cake. - Thank you, Trudy.
isn't this exciting? - It is.
this looks great, Trudy.
I know how you boys and girls can be.
there's food. - Thank god.
Draper residence.
it's me.
I'm not sure where I'm staying right now, But I'll be working out of the pierre.
okay.
listen, Betts,
I want you to know I'm not going to fight you.
thank you.
I hope you get what you always wanted.
you will always be their father.
okay.
well, goodbye.
goodbye.
you know, if you leave your shoes outside The door here, somebody polishes them.
Hello, Don.
how was your morning?
very productive.
you stay away from her! You hear me?
don, are you ever gonna call back the American Cancer Society?
they've tried you twice this morning.
I'm not gonna run out of here crying tomorrow.
she's gone.
I know.
I think it's time for us to move.
meet me for dinner, in the open, wherever I want, because-- We can do that now.
Hello?
I still have to pack for a 7: 00 AM flight thanks to you.
will you at least put me out of my misery before you go?
stop it.
american Cancer loved the letter and they're gonna love you.
and then you're gonna stop working, take your kids to California and have a ball.
I have this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
listen, maybe it's not all about work.
maybe that sick feeling might go away if you take your head out of the sand about the past.
you know it's not that simple.
of course it isn't, and you don't have to do it alone.
but if you resolve some of that, you might be more comfortable with everything.
and then what happens?
and then you're stuck trying to be a person like the rest of us.
I'll call you Tuesday when you get back.
I'm gonna miss you, you know.
any outgoing?
just-- This.
don't post it. It's for you.
it's been discussed among the partners that you be promoted to Director of Agency Operations.
my goodness.
now it's a dreadful reality that we've not signed any new business in 10 weeks, so I hope you'll understand that this is a title only
for now.
well, it's almost an honor.
what made you suddenly write that?
well, most of it was in the letter, hopefully.
but I think in my heart it was an impulse, because I knew what I needed to do to move forward.
well, it was a gesture we hope will be useful.
we believe, obviously, that lung cancer is avoidable and can be thwarted with the right campaign.
but how?
we know frightening medical facts are useless.
half of us are smokers.
I'm a smoker too.
and you can forget about us. I've worked $10 million campaigns that can't even get people to change brands.
I can tell you from the inside that the business is really only about getting new smokers.
teenagers are a tough sell.
not to tobacco companies.
they play on a two-pronged attack, promising adulthood and rebellion.
but teenagers are sentimental as well.
have you heard their music?
I can tell you a little of what I have in mind.
I have to say it's very interesting.
go on.
what I'm suggesting is a series of commercials that run during "Bandstand" and the like.
show mothers and daughters or fathers and sons and that cigarettes are between them.
and you show with a walk on the beach, baking cookies, playing catch, that the parents are not long for this world.
but they hate their parents.
they won't be thinking about their parents.
they'll be thinking about themselves. That's what they do.
the truth is
they're mourning for their childhood more than they're anticipating their future, because they don't know it yet but they don't want to die.
if it helps, I can guarantee you that Lucky Strike will hate this.
how'd it go? - So did you get Cancer?
Megan, can you get Mr. Cosgrove?
we've got a meeting for another meeting.
they were eating out of his hand.
and even better, the board was loaded with fat cats just like you said.
don had a particularly empathic exchange with the CEO of Dow chemical.
Saran wrap would be nice.
I'll take him out on the links, let him beat me.
Roger, this is a philanthropic organization.
don and I think it best if we approach from the rear.
are we celebrating?
don got us to the top three.
stupendous. - Ken, sit down.
Everett Marlowe at Dow is a very charming fellow.
your father-in-law to be is at corning, right?
well, they must be quite acquainted.
I think that's likely.
well, I was thinking
wouldn't it be fun to have a foursome this weekend that includes your father-in-law, yourself and Mr. Marlowe?
doesn't that sound like fun?
I don't know.
Ken, there's no reason to be suddenly shy.
I'm sure if you impressed Everett this morning that should be enough to get him on the phone.
well, I just looked him in the eye and convinced him
I was some kind of idealistic businessman.
how is it gonna look if I call for a meeting?
pretty bad, I guess.
but I'm not Pete.
sorry about that.
no, you're obviously not.
Tom Vogel is our biggest client unless we sign Dow, which would be yours.
look, I love Cynthia's dad and I know that every account I have will eventually leave me.
that's awfully pessimistic.
well, it's not worth the risk.
Cynthia's my life. My actual life.
fine, if you want to tuck it between your legs, I'll call him, but I have to warn you, I'm going to drop your name.
you do whatever you want.
now if you don't mind,
I'm going to go service the 30% of this firm that are my clients.
Hello, Carla. Is Sally home?
she is, but you shouldn't be here.
are they moving today?
Monday. That's the Salvation Army.
Mrs. Draper's car is gone. I just wanted to say hi.
I don't know.
fine. I just want to say bye.
she's upstairs. Don't be long.
Mrs. Francis just ran to the store.
thank you.
it's Glen. Are you decent?
come in.
you really shouldn't be here.
so you're finally moving.
this weekend while we're in California with my dad.
jeez, is that where you're moving?
no, we're moving to Rye.
I'll be able to drive in a few years. I can come visit.
Really?
Absolutely.
I can send you postcards. I have your address.
it's not that big a deal. I say goodbye to people all the time.
okay. Are you going to Disneyland?
Yes.
get me something.
what are you doing here?
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
get out.
what are you waiting for?
why do you hate me?
you don't think I know what you're doing? You could be friends with anyone!
just cause you're sad doesn't mean everybody has to be.
I'm sorry. I didn't see the harm. He wanted to say goodbye.
did you leave them alone?
they're friends, that's all.
when did you decide that you're her mother?
it was a mistake.
there's no need for that kind of talk.
you know what, Carla?
I've been thinking
and the distance is...
I need someone new nearby, someone closer to the new house.
this should square us for the week.
do you think I enjoy doing this?
after all these years? I won't have it, Carla.
well, someone has to look after those children.
Really? And where are your kids?
are they all doctors and lawyers?
you'd best stop talking now.
where are you going?
I'm going to say goodbye to the children.
do you think that's a good idea right now?
it'll just upset them more. Some other time.
the bungalow in San Pedro netted you 10 grand in profit.
what's happening with the other house?
I have a listing appointment with the realtor when I get back from California, but I have no idea what it's worth.
it's Ossining, but I say you'll more than double your money, which is not bad for 10 years.
what about the loss for what I put into the company?
that's an investment. It's not a loss.
don't be impatient.
enjoy the harvest. Plant some seeds.
maybe get a place of your own.
don't you want to go home someday and see a steak on the table?
so, Mary Sunshine, what's the capital gains? 48%?
Mrs. Francis is on the phone. It's urgent.
you want me to go?
it's always urgent.
Hello? - I'm very sorry, and I know this will disrupt your plans, but I'm afraid I had to let Carla go today.
what? What happened?
don, I have the children 99% of the time.
this is a decision that I get to make.
well, can't I just hire her back for the trip?
no. I don't want her poisoning the well.
I told the kids she's sick.
so what the hell do I do, Betty, with no help?
I have meetings, two flights, diapers, for Christ's sake.
then don't take them! They're used to it.
we're going.
Hey, pumpernickel, there's nobody out front.
I already ate. - Me too, and I ran into someone I'd like you to meet.
this is Carolyn Jones, like Morticia;
Peggy Olson, advertising wunderkind.
pleased to meet you.
do you mind?
Carolyn was at a photo shoot modeling pantyhose of all things.
she got fired and she has to make rent.
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdown at Howard Johnson's today.
well hello, ladies.
Peggy, I needed to talk to you about my ABC meeting, but if I'm interrupting...
who is this lovely young thing?
Harry, this is my friend Joyce. I thought you'd already met.
Harold Crane, head of media.
Carolyn Jones. - No kidding.
she's looking for work.
that's hard to believe.
as an actress, model? What is your experience like?
well, I've been modeling, at least until this morning.
the Topaz people went nuts, fired the people who hired me and then me.
but you didn't do anything wrong, did you?
no, she didn't.
Peggy, do you think you can help?
maybe. I'm sorry. You said Topaz fired everyone?
they were very brusque.
people lose their heads.
I'm sure it was a mistake, dear.
we should be going, honey.
Yes. Yes, of course.
pleased to meet you.
we'll see what we can do, Carolyn Jones.
any luck?
the hotel has a service, but the girls who can take care of Sally and Bobby won't watch a two-year-old and vice versa.
so I've arranged for two girls to cover the two mornings you're working.
I thought you might need someone for Disneyland and maybe handle the Dodger game on your own.
does that sound like a vacation?
maybe it'll be an adventure.
how much do you make a week?
what if I were to double that?
I'll give you some nights free and you'll get to go to California.
swimming pools, movie stars.
I don't really have any professional experience.
you'll be great.
Sally loved you, Bobby likes a pretty face and the baby.
he's tough but he's fun.
I've never been to California.
I have a college friend who's been begging me to visit.
perfect.
call her up, pick a night, I'll foot the bill.
what do you have to lose?
please stop the advertising.
come on. Let's go to the room first.
let's go or we're gonna go back to the parking lot
and spend the weekend locked in the car.
art Garten. real name.
at topaz pantyhose called me back.
he was shocked and impressed that I'd heard about them firing Dupre.
it gets better. They already bought placement For the campaign that just fell apart,
and we've been invited in Monday to pick up the pieces.
I just told you that. - Monday's a holiday.
they're out of time. All we have to do is not throw up on our shoes.
do you want help? - He's not gonna be there.
good work.
okay okay, here he is.
that was great.
it's how we got Gene to sleep.
well, let's not wake him up.
they played in the pool for four hours
and bounced on the bed for another two.
I think everybody's gonna sleep very well.
I need you to come over at 7: 00 tomorrow to watch Gene.
I'll get these two breakfast on the road.
okay. Bonne night, Les animaux.
good night. - Good night.
you said you didn't have any experience and you're like Maria Von Trapp.

well, hello there.
Stephanie, this is Sally and Bobby.
hello. - Hi.
well, it's very nice to meet you.
how do you like California?
they love it.

four boxes. Good for her.
Oh, she wanted you to have something.
it's her engagement ring from Don.
don't you want it?
she wanted you to have it. You shouldn't play around with that.
besides, I don't believe in it.
so are you going back to school?
not for the moment.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
that's the best part, right?
got the rest of my life ahead of me. So do you.
now that's her.
who's that?
how was it? - Most of it was fun.
daddy, are you coming in? - I'm not wearing my bathing suit.
come in. You have to come in. I want to be a shark.
come on, daddy.
you swim all the time in New York.
I'm really beat.
Hey, should I throw some herring to you two?
Dumbo. Mad tea party.

gene can't go on Mr. Toad.
I'll get it.
he can stay with Megan while we go on the ride.
then Megan can't go.
Hi, Sally.
this is my friend Camille.
Camille, this is Don, Gene, Bobby and Sally.
Hello, everybody.
I just wanted to make sure you didn't need anything else.
no, I think we're okay.
where are you going? - The whisky a go go.
well, good night, everybody.
good night. Have fun.
what about Tomorrowland?
I don't want to ride an elephant. I want to fly a jet.
hello.
I'm in here.
I'm sorry. Everyone was late
and then it took three of them to light the pilot on the water heater.
Carla called looking for you.
Oh? And what did she want?
you know what she wanted.
you fired her and didn't tell me?
well, I am sorry. I didn't want her invoking your sympathies.
why did you fire her? - Because I don't trust her judgment.
what did she say?
she said you wouldn't give her a letter of recommendation.
how long did the woman work for you?
I know she doesn't steal. What did she do?
and don't tell me it's just about the neighbor boy.
Sally is not allowed to see him.
Carla said he's her friend. - "Carla said"? "Carla said"?!
I don't understand what you're doing.
you didn't want to move because you wanted the kids to have some stability,
and then you get rid of their nanny since they were born?
I wanted a fresh start, okay?
I'm entitled to that. - There is no fresh start!
lives carry on!
Jesus, Henry. Just once could you take my side?
no one's ever on your side, Betty.
just a minute.
am I bothering you?
no, I was out on the balcony enjoying the view.
I heard you come in and I wanted to go over The plan for tomorrow for Disneyland.
do you think I should be involved in such high-level decisions?
I can't turn on the TV. They're asleep.
there's nothing on TV.
come outside with me. It's so beautiful here.
did you have fun with your friend?
not really. She's not really my friend.
we just lived together during college.
my father's a Professor.
I think she liked him too much.
so why did you see her?
I don't know. She's an actress now.
she's in two episodes of "Hogan's Heroes."
she told me I could never do it because of my teeth.
she actually said that to me.
I don't even want to be an actress.
I love your teeth.
I took elocution lessons when I moved to New York.
the teacher said I had the mouth of a singer.
are you sure we should do this?
I've been thinking about you so much.
were you thinking about this when I asked you to come?
it was the first thought that went through my head.
I was gonna miss you so much, anyway.
you don't know anything about me.
but I do.
I know that you have a good heart and I know that you're always trying to be better.
we all try.
we don't always make it.
I've done a lot of things.
I know who you are now.
it's getting light outside.
I should get back before the sun comes up.
they're little roosters.
then you should go.
I don't want to confuse them.
I want to know if I can knock on this door again tomorrow night or if this is just what it is, like that night in the office.
I need to know. I don't know why.
because you're afraid?
you shouldn't be.
disneyland fireworks are at 9: 00.
how about dinner tomorrow night at 11: 00 right here?
we're gonna be together all day.
this is Art. Art, Ken Cosgrove and Patricia...
what was it? - Peggy Olson.
sit. I'd offer you coffee, but everybody's gone for the holiday.
the perils of being in charge.
so you can tell we don't have a lot of time.
I mean not just today. We're in kind of a bind.
we're no worse than we were before, and I hated those people.
do you have the old work?
somewhere. Look, it was a gorgeous girl...
high heels, jewelry...
pulling up this Cinderella gown to show the Topaz.
but she wasn't Cinderella and where the hell was she going?
we want something that'll stand out.
I don't care if it's a cartoon.
I don't care if it's Abe became wearing them.
we're a tiny company. We need to make a stink.
well, I've worn them but what qualities, in your mind, do they have that make them unique?
you're wearing them right now?
Yes, because I can wear Topaz pantyhose with anything.
I'm wearing them at work right now and I'll change everything but my hose before I go out tonight.
one pair... That's all you need with Topaz.
if we only sold each girl one pair, we'd be out of business.
topaz, the only pair of pantyhose you'll ever need.
bad for business. Good for you.
that's very funny, cause it says our product's so good, we're not even interested in ourselves.
okay, that's one. What else you got?
um, well,
I'd have to think more, but it might be great to show a bunch of different outfits...
one for formal, one for business, one a little sporty...
and something like "single pair, singular comfort."
it's got the word "single" in it.
that's two.
daddy, tell Sally that snakes used to have legs.
I don't know if that's true.
you know it's true in the Bible.
we learned that they used to be fish and he doesn't know - because he has baby science. - They found a skeleton.
where? You don't know.
you're a short stuff. - Okay, Thally.
shut up!
great.
we'll fix it. It's just a milkshake.
can you grab a straw or some napkins? This is my last dress.
I'm sorry. Is it late?
I wanted to let you sleep.
how long have you been up?
a few hours.
what's wrong?
I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about you.
well, I'm right here.
I don't know what it is about you but...
I feel like myself when I'm with you, but the way I always wanted to feel.
because I'm in love with you, Megan, and I think I have been for a while.
Oh my goodness.
open it.
it's beautiful.
when I saw you sleeping there, I thought...
I couldn't imagine not seeing you there every morning.
will you marry me?
Oh, I... I... I...
I don't know what to say.
this is all so fast.
did you ever think of the number of things that had to happen for me to get to know you?
but everything happened, and it got me here.
what does that mean?
I can't believe this.
Yes. Yes.
you have a ring? How long have you been thinking about this?
it's been in my family...
not my family, really.
it belonged to someone very important to me.
I don't believe this.
I have to call my mother.
I had this feeling and I called her from California - because I wanted it to go away. - I saw it on the bill.
sorry. I... I... I have to call her.
do you want me to call her from work?
no, call her.
what about work? What do we do?
we tell everybody.
Oh. Okay.
do you want me to leave you alone?
do you want me to talk to her?
Oh. Do you speak French?
mama, c'est moi. J'ai des Nouvelles.
va chercher papa, vite.
what the hell's going on?
I don't know. He wouldn't say.
look, it's you... Brown as a Berry. How was the coast?
wonderful.
Joan, could you shut the door?
I have an announcement to make and it shouldn't change anything here except for me and maybe for Joan.
but Miss Calvet and I are getting married.
who the hell's that?
Megan. - Really?
congratulations, Don.
I wish you the best of luck.
Megan out there?
Yeah, I know it's a surprise, but she makes me very happy and, well...
it's something we both want very much.
well, let's get her in here.
how exciting for you. - I know. I can't believe it.
congratulations, dear.
you don't say "congratulations" to the bride.
you say "best wishes."
congratulations, Don.
let's have a toast. Megan, could you get us some ice?
I'm teasing.
see, Don? This is the way to behave.
so when are you getting married?
I don't know. We haven't discussed it.
soon.
art Garten just called.
no. What did he say?
he said he liked ideas two and four and we've got a week.
shall we go rub it in?
after you. - You did it.
we've got some great news. - Are you two getting married?
what's going on?
they're getting married.
Really? - Oh, congratulations.
thank you. - It's incredible.
I know. It just happened.
that's incredible.
you must be so happy.
um, I'll get it.
we have some news too. Peg.
Yes, we signed an account... Topaz pantyhose.
it's a quarter of a million dollars. - How'd you do that?
Peggy found out about them and then we met over the holiday.
that's great news. We broke the streak.
what a great day. Good work, both of you.
so anyway, I guess we should tell everybody.
topaz needs work this week. - Great.
I hope you have all the happiness that Peggy and I had signing this account.
I'll be there in a minute.
Wow.
it's been going on awhile, but I appreciate your concern.
well, then I'm happy for you...
both of you.
she's very beautiful.
you know she reminds me of you.
she's got the same spark.
I know she admires you just as much as I do.
it was Dr. Miller again.
it's not gonna get any easier the longer you wait.
whatever could be on your mind?
can you believe it?
it happens all the time.
they're all just between marriages. You know that.
he'll probably make her a copywriter.
he's probably not going to want to be married to his secretary.
Really? Is that what he meant?
"she admires you"?
Jesus.
that's the way it works for some.
you know, I just saved this company.
I signed the first new business since Lucky Strike left, but it's not as important as getting married.
again.
well, I was just made Director ???
a title, no money of course...
and if they poured champagne, it must've been, while I was pushing the mail cart.
a pretty face comes along and everything goes out the window.
well, I learned a long time ago to not get all my satisfaction from this job.
that's bullshit.
Faye Miller. - Hi, it's me.
I was starting to worry you were ill or something.
I need to talk to you.
well, I was gonna come by at lunch anyway.
Oh, no, you shouldn't do that. Why don't we meet somewhere?
what is going on?
something happened and I'd like to talk to you about it face to face.
meet me for coffee.
okay.
you know what?
I'm not gonna have some conversation and have to sit through coffee afterwards.
just get to it.
well, I...
met somebody...
and we're engaged.
are you kidding me?
I know... I know, it's a surprise. It was for me too.
Jesus.
who is she?
what's the difference?
I fell in love.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
you've been very important to me.
so you're not gonna put an ad in "The New York Times"
saying you never liked me?
well, I hope you're very happy, and I hope she knows you only like the beginnings of things.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
goodbye.
I saw the light go off.
it's fine. It's done.
I love you, you know.
and he's smiling like a fool, like he's the first man that ever married his secretary.
she's 25, as if that's news.
so when are you going to tell them your news?
they'll know soon enough.
are you showing at all? The picture I have of you doesn't change.
I'll take a new one and I'll send it to you.
you know all I want to know.
Yes, honey, they're bigger.
Oh! Why are you torturing me?
I just woke up and it's already 90 degrees here.
listen, I've gotta go.
not yet. - What?
not yet.
now you listen to the doctor.
you have to eat. Don't worry about your figure.
I'll whip you and the baby into shape when I get back.
okay.
I'll call you Thursday night your time.
okay. I love you.
I love you too.
Hello?
Mrs. Truxton?
no, it's me.
what are you doing here?
it's Tuesday at 7: 00.
I thought I told you I had a listing appointment with the real estate agent.
Oh, I didn't realize that was today.
I forgot about the cabinets in the guest bath.
so you weren't that thorough?
I guess not.
do you like the new house?
I do. It's got a lot of character.
I'll probably have to tear out the kitchen.
remember this place?
I do.
it's different. That's for certain.
isn't that what you wanted?
I don't know, Don.
things aren't perfect.
so you'll move again.
so much change it's made everything...
difficult.
I have to tell you something.
I met someone.
I'm engaged.
Really?
no. Someone at work.
I'm very happy for you.
it's okay, Betty.
I don't know why I'm surprised.
is she your secretary? I know she watched the kids in California.
Yes.
so I will see you the weekend after next. What is that, the 23rd?
I think so.
wait.
Congratulations.
thank you.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379
he's coming
attention
salute
sit down
someone smoked here
no smoking in the classroom
however...
it is difficult to get rid of smoking
I am not excepted either
when I hear the bell in the faculty room
I try to leave...
but then I get the urge to smoke
I light a cigarette
soon I light another, then another
so you see, I am always 20 to 30 minutes late
but, professor...
what's with you today?
it is already 30 old years
since I've been addressed as professor
during that time...
as if watching water running from an open faucet...
it is like that after water has passed
students have drifted away in front of my eyes
it is impossible to remember each and very face
Ah, yes
there is one among them, though that I remember clearly to this day
the face belong to one...
who slept during class with his eyes open
Hey, Takayama
that dozing expert was your father
by the way, gentlemen
today is the last day for me to be called professor
as of today...
I am resigning my professorship
my books...
have somehow become salable
I can live by writing
I must admit, I don't dislike teaching
but as the say
he who runs after two hares will catch neither
I have decided to quit teaching
professor
even if you quit
you are our professor
my father, too was an schoolmate of this school
so were his friends
even to this day, they call you professor
they also say...
you are solid gold
solid gold
a lump of gold with no impurities
I means, you are the true professor
you are a German professor but...
you have taught us more
I feel...
you have taught us many precious things
tokyo, 1 943
this is the house our professor moved in
after he quit school
darling
ma'am, put the professor away somewhere
he's in the way
put that in the entrance hall
the entrance hall will be my study
at the same time, I will be the gatekeeper
to protect the house from invasion by the naughty crowd like you receiving days 1st & 15th month visitors on other days prohibited
I hope it is all right
what is?
this house
the rent is cheaper than I expected
I knew there was something fishy
when I went to order noodles today
the shop lady told me
this house has been burglarized quite frequently
so none have settled down very long
and it was vacant for a while
the heck with burglars
there's nothing worth stealing here
still I am somehow scared
don't worry
no burglar will break in
since I was a child
I've been so afraid of burglars
I've given much thought on how to prevent burglar
and I have hammered out a method to prevent them
did you really, professor?
Yes, I did 1 o'clock
bewitching hour for the burglars
I'll go over this wall and open the side door
sneak in from here
wait a minute
we're acting like thieves ourselves
we're only supposed to be checking his precautions after what his wife said
the only way to check is to...
sneak in like real burglars
take a look at that, what a laugh
don't worry he says
and he boasts about being an expert on burglars
burglar's entrance
burglar's passage
burglar's rest area
burglar's exit
that was a clean score
I had to steal this to get even
isn't that the professor's hat?
he wore it when he was teaching Army people
he won't need it anymore
it'll be a memento a family treasure
what's we do with the side door?
what'll we do with the side door?
what about it?
it's unlocked
it has to be locked
you'd better go over the wall
it's not safe
come down
what is it?
someone's coming
damn it, it's a cop
can we leave the side door like that?
sure, with those signs nothing will be stolen
our professor is something
Yes, he's a solid gold
professor
we have happily come upon receiving your invitation
come right on
we can't with you sitting there
you look like scribe or a fortune teller
literary men somewhat are the same
this must be a defense measure to keep away the visitors
beside who wants to stay
if he's reading this kind of thing
by Shokusanjin
annoyance is to have visitors
nonetheless this does not imply you
by the Host
delight is to have visitors
nonetheless this does not imply you
hello
come on in
is it all right?
there aren't enough cushions
so I'll be the one to use it
I think that's rude to the guests
but, oh, well...
what do you mean rude?
you barge into my house remove all the sliding doors
fine guests you are
professor
it's not a visiting day
what's happening today?
it's a special day today
a special day?
it's the day I have become a genuine old man
it is my 60th birthday
I have become 60 years old
is that true?
if we had known
we would have invited you to a great banquet
come, come, don't say that
it's wartime now
not a time for a grand celebration
I myself had completely forgotten
if not for some venison
my relatives back home sent me
I thought is was a good idea to exchange drinks with you over some venison
we brought beer and sake we've gathered
I appreciate that
by the way, how many of you are here?
there's 1 6, sir
do we have enough cooking stoves and pans?
if we don't, we'll go buy some
gentlemen
happy birthday, sir
make yourselves at home
I sit this way because
it's comfortable for me
please put the meat in
ma'am
ma'am, join us
don't worry
she's never eat horse meat
horse meat, sir?
isn't this vension
we received bulk of venison more than we two can eat
so I decided to invite you
but considering your appetite
so I decided to invite you
I realized that it's not enough for all of you
venison stew is rare and grand but adding horse meat should make to interesting blend
horse and deer mean stupid
I get it, sir
this means we are stupid
no need to be depressed
beef, pork and chicken are hard to come by nowadays
I happened to hear horse meat was available
I thought of a good idea of adding horse meat to the venison stew
I set out a butcher's quite distance form here and bought a horse meat
should bring ears to your eyes
for his loving student an old man whipping his old bones to buy horse meat
can you imagine that?
he's my beloved teacher thinking of his debt to our teacher
gentlemen
what is more, I feel myself in an awl situation
the horse was at at the Air... Acade where taught for some time
it stared at me with doubt eyes
as if saying what in the world are you buy there, sir?
I was so embarrassed
I wanted to hide somewhere
by the way, gentlemen, I never realise horse had such large eyes
well, let's eat
the meat should be ready
you certainly make it easy for us to eat with that story for us, professor
imagine it's all venison
beside, the two meats are mixed
you wouldn't know which is which
it's certainly delicious
if there is an air raid this stupid stew will turn into blind stew
I hate the raids
I've been afraid the dark since I was a child
I can't sleep in the dark, either
even now, sir?
aren't you afraid of the dark?
of cause not
we're grow-uns
what's so scary about darkness?
you gentlemen are impossible
why is that?
anyone unafraid of darkness has a vital discrepancy as a human being
you lack imagination
a proper human being even in the darkness in their imagination of darkness
which prevent you from seeing
whatever in the dark everything can be deadly
that's why we becomes scare
this is justified logic
in my case...
if I know it is here?
the neighbors hereby
seems like badgers
rather, I suspect the badger have disguised as humans
this is the nature of Human beings
it may be natural for you because you solid gold
to the solid gold professor
cheers
looking up to our teacher
thinking of our debt to our teacher
over the garden
countless years have already passed
so fast is the passage of time
the years and the months
our professor's house was also burned down from the air raids
this is the professor's house after that
Ah, won't go in
thank you very much
here Okay?
over here
ma'am
professor should love this
indeed like rain in drought
can I put the bag there?
Oh, that goes...
are you coming in?
I'll help
there are too many people
are you alright?
I can't budge
I now know
how canned sardines feel
anything to put over here?
this, please
please, yes, thank you
watch your head
ignore that head
would you take this, too?
ma'am, if you need anything, please tell us
thank you very much, everyone
we trouble you all the time
I want an umbrella
take this one, sir
our bath room is...
that new building over there,
I doesn't have a roof
therefore on rainy days such as today
we can't use it
what do you say?
to be honest this place is terrible
let's find someplace else
no, no...
coming across this house which miraculously survived was mere luck
besides, the owner is a baron I'm acquainted with
a baron?
peerage
lived in this house?
don't talk nonsense
this used to be an old worker for Noble old garden keeper
on the morning when both the barcon's house and my house were burnt down
the baron who come to
I found his estate
my wife and I found this shack
we were resting here and asked him if we can rent here
he said: go ahead
we were very lucky indeed
you know this, don't you?
HOJl-Kl
Yes, sir
books are heavy
I fled with only this book my favorite
the author of the book Kamomo chome
Iived the capital during the Heian Era
he experienced many disasters such as wars, fires and famines
Iosing all hopes in life be secluded himself in a mountain hermitage
I recently feel the same way as Kamono Chone must have felt
for the time being, I intend to some down here
to live some days like the hermitage he lived in
well, gentlemen, I wish I can invite you in but I'm afraid I can't
it's packed with my wife and I alone
don't worry
professor
please
many of the birds we kept were burnt
my wife instead on freeing them from the cages
if we couldn't take them
a bird treed from its cage at night
would only fly into the fire
if they are going to be burnt anyway they might as well meet their fate in their familiar cages
we left them
a neighborhood child found this silver-eye and gave it to us
it was fallen out of its nest it was just tiny fledgling at first
since she raised it from that time my wife strongly insisted and didn't let the cage go
we had no choice, but...
to escape with this little bird
the only resemblance this has with the hermitage in Hoji-ki is its smallness and without elegance decoration
there is no sound of clear water from the mountains running from bamboo pipes as at Chomei's hermillage
the only sound heard is that of someone urinating against the clay wall
I wonder why people take the trouble of always urinating at the same place
all people are the same
the sign of "No pissing" has no effect
even a picture of a shrine seems ineffective
but I came up with a brilliant idea
I painted a special incineration
I'm sure it works this time
go take a look at it
it's on the other side
it's ingenious
no pissing or cutting those committed
clever indeed
can't afford to get it chopped off
he's certainly a genius for such things
the rainy season may end
by the way how is the professor?
Where's the professor?
you see how it is
he's hopeless once it starts to rumble
that's why I must always keep ready this incense against thunder
we owned so many thing but none of them existed now human beings accumulate
so many things during their life
most of them were burnt during the air raid
but things have increase in this house again
I sometime hope the B29 will come pay us a visit
still we're glad the war is over
are you sure?
on the contrary
life has become worse
during the war, we at least had food rations without rations
we are reduced to live like beggars
long ago when I was a small child
we used to Built huts with bamboo and straw in the open air behind our house
I often went to our little hut and sit inside
when my grandmother caught me there. With tears she'd asked
what are you doing here?
he will surely grow up to be a beggar
she wept like a child
indeed
my grandmother's prophecy come true
professor
what are you saying?
you fancy yourself as Cheme?
did you forget his spirit?
it's not like you
the river runs on and on and the water is never the same
bubbles diffuse and appear in the water they never remain forever
in this world one's house has come pass as thus
I see
don't be grumbling like an old man
let me apologize
we are here about that matter, sir
we can't have you living here forever
we plan to build a house for you somewhere
nonsense, I won't let you
not immediately, sir
by the 1 st Masshakai next year
we'll have a concrete plan
what is that? This Maadhakai?
the name of your birthday party
we've decided on that, since...
it's not likely you'd die soon
Mouii Kai?
Madadayo
Maadha kai as in this
the characters are
ma from the God's name
and A and Da from the Budda
isn't it a great name?
is that right?
Maadha kai
you're back
here's a bottle of Jonney Walker
but the content is not real Jonney Walker
it's medical alcohol
I got it from a doctor I know
he made it by mixing tea and brown sugar
it tastes strange
but it's effective
I must say...
I'm beginning to feel good
professor
when we were students...
we often drank with you
when we got drunk you led us to a lot of muschied
we switched nameplates on houses
when you sobered up
you'd make us put them back again
thank you, Ma'am
professor
do you want your new house
japanese or western style?
as I already said...
I won't let you
leave it to us, professor
now that the war is over major publishers are reopening
one of them has offered to pay in advance for the right to publish your works
leave it to us
there is a piece of and we are considering now
we can build a small garden
what kind would you like?
I'd like to have a pond
a pond?
a garden pond?
there won't be space for a big pond but a small one will be possible
I don't want such a small one
I'd like to keep some fish but fish swim in the same direction
if the pond is so small they'd have to bend their bodies all the time
it'll be pathetic their back get bent
fish's backs?
what about this idea?
the whole garden is a pond
that's a lot of construction work
then make the pond circumference as large as possible
build an island in middle
make a doughnut-shaped pond
you come up with the weirdest ideas
you're beyond us mediocre men
he seriously worries about fish's backs
I must say, he's a genius
he's child, he never grows up
I got it
that's what turns you on
don't be silly
don't hide it
I realize that's what we like in him, too
that's why it's fun to be with him
isn't that right?
the moon is out
the moon is out...
round, round, perfectly round
I love old songs
like Henri Rousseau's painting so innocent and honest
I love songs of the good old days
during the war
we had forgotten about such nice things like a moon
the moon is out...
round, round, perfectly round
the moon is like a tray
many houses were demolished by wars
only the quiet places could remain without dread though small and poor
if offers a bed at night and a seat in the day
what more can one ask for in a shelter
the 1 st Maadha Kai
to celebrate our professor's 61 st birthday
we will open the first Maadha Kai party
due to the Ailied Occupation food and alcohol is not easy to come by
luckily, with the cooperation of all the members
we are able to hold this banquet
as the chairman
let me voice our appreciation to the officers who have done so well
professor, please said something and a large glass of beer
please drink up in one breath
then a toast in his honor
my friends and gentlemen
thank you all for inviting me here tonight
thank you for sparing time thought some are not busy from your busy schedule to attend this wonderful gathering
is this old goat still alive?
seems to be the motive of the Maadha Kai and that
you all have the desire to ask me Maadha Kai
I have come to say Maadayo
though it may be against the principles of this meeting ask me again next year and the year after
please ask me Maadha Kai
I promise that I will some day respond to you by saying Mouiiyo
I assure you I am well prepared
the person to my right has taken care of me for years
he is my physician Dr, Koobayashi
he will sign my death certificate
the gentleman on my left is one of the alumni
he used to look after his family business but now he is a priest of a temple
sev kamevama will hold the memorial meeting before I die
however
I will finish this beer at one time this big glass of beer even if I died there was nothing for me to worry
Madadayo
cheers
congratulations
gentlemen, while you are still free from the effects of the liquid
everyone must say something
make them short and simple
may the professor long life
that was so short
this is the best wish
it would be a lie if it is too long
I am deeply grateful to the professor
when we staged the opera Faust
in German under his guidance
I was given a wonderful role
I will always treasure that memory of sensation
did you play Mephistopheles?
no, sir
I played the eternal virgin Faust fall in love with Margerlia
I'm awkward with speech
I'll recall all the station name from Hokkaido to
are you catch the express train?
no, the normal one
this is a very special idea
Kushiro, Shin-Fuji, Ohtanoshige, Shero
Shiranuka, Onbetsu
forget it, next
I don't understand
what today is an auspicious day
probably because professor is still alive
I'm alive too, but there's...
I don't think it's auspicious
master
this make me embarrassed
so, senior monk
monk
it is so nice of you to call me that name
so I call you monk?
that is better off
how about your business?
are you busy?
very busy, thank you
that's why I'm not visiting you
I know I have to wait for a while
I don't mean it
you should be frank to say
how long could my life last?
let me see
if you follow my instruction
I guaranteed
shit
if he lived for so long
the men should be sentenced to death
Cheers, Professor
you're a executive
yes
have you ever thought of the meaning of killers?
nothing special?
that would be troublesome
even if we had the right to enforce the laws
it means the right to enforce, not to kill
it'd not be excluded, since you're a killer
this man is of no value
must be excused
have mercy on me, Sir
now that me turn has come I would like to say...
I owe it all to professor
thank you, professor
professor, you have taught us to drinking
but some only got drunk...
and will given you trouble
suo went wild swinging beer bottles
when Komura got drunk he'd hold and kiss anyone
even kissed me
shave off your beard?
yes
mustn't do such a thing without telling us
why not?
the beard was a part of your face for many years
we all recongnized you
it is because of your beard
now it's gone
I didn't recognize you at first
granted, the beard was yours, but...
I was also ours, so...
mustn't shave it off on your own
sorry, I'll grow it again
that won't do
if you grow it again
we won't recognize you
as you all know professor is indeed well read
one time he told us not to take for granted that ears are attached to the head
because Ampriobirs Spirias has ears on its feel
what?
what's Ampriobiris Spirias?
what is that?
it's Ampriobiris Apirias
please, Sir
gentlemen
don't crowd me like this
I can't cope with you all by myself
let's toast once again and we all enjoy the party
gentlemen, thank you
congratulations
thank you
drinking parties are intersection
at one time, all the members become intoxicated
it somehow reminds me of water in a poor coming to a boil
that is why
I still feel I am his student
be quiet, please
tada, you turn
the professor is great
right
I don't mean all the professors are great but a great men could be a professor only
professor is like the sun to us
over statement
that would be an exaggeration so I'll say he's like the moon
exaggeration
wait
there are half moons
or one-third moons
or at time no moons
like professor's lessons
this is why I call him to the moons
the moon is the sun's sister
the moon turns into the circle
the moon turns into the bow
spring, summer, autumn, winter...
she shines over entire Japan
the moon is out, the moon is out
round, round, perfectly round
the moon like a tray
the moon is hiding, hiding
behind black, black, jet black
clouds like black ink
the moon is out once again
round, round, perfectly round
the moon like a tray
gentlemen
remember...
one-two Mr. Pharmacist
let's do that
one-two Medicine is the best in Japan
one, two
buy One-two Medicine
one, two, one, two
the medicine cures... One, two
pyrosis, stomach trouble, diarrhea
dizziness before and after childbirth
asthma, headache, influenza
from here is my original
take the pace
medicine can cure numerous illnesses
but no medicine can cure a fool
foolishness is in heaps today
japan is blooming with fools now
suffer defeat held under occupation
but fools call it the end of the war
right about
advocating democracy loud and clear
only crooks throw their weight about
bribery and corruption currently pass with impunity
brazen fair and square
scandals, paradise, unfair judges
those naughty fools never learn
chirp and twitter all in unison
chirp, chirp, twitter twitter
the end
the House, the Rock, the lsland
the lsland
we're arrived
what? Where is everybody?
I don't know
have some more
could that be me?
it seems like it
Maadha Kai
Madadayo
Maadha Kai
professor's new house was completed
only this pair for men
the rest are for women
my garden doesn't need to be that wide
you would be used to it
in order to build the pond
we have to make the house smaller
when you imagine a house of match box
this is indeed as big as a palace
Really?
indeed it
we're flattered
I am also proud of this round fish pond
this idea is special
the Pacific may be vast...
but swimming straight...
you'll reach the shores of America
swimming round in this pond the distance is limitless
I want to keep carp in this pond
big ones you only see in dreams
they could be as big as rowboats
that's impossible
infinite this pond may be...
like in the expression...
and end up motionless
bad for their backs
I meant is as a figure of speech
like in the expression...
gray hair 3, 000-yard long in a Chinese poem
imagine a carp the size of a whale
by the way...
the Golden Pavilion is built in a pond and my house although small and and not sparking is quite like it
so put this up
Kinkakuji
this Golden Pavilion forbids such boisterous crowd like us
I'll use it as my study so I won't allow any guests
what do you think? Isn't this too small?
could be worked out with the plan
it's 49. 5
land for sale
it's 53. 5
tea is ready
the man who greeted you who is he?
the owner of that land
he came the other day to ask me if I'd buy that land
I don't have so much money
I have to refuse, but...
he was very courteous
approaching me so polite
I find it hard to tell him
seems he found the buyer
Yes, I'm glad
are you keeping that cat?
I call it Nora
because it's a nora neko
my wife gave it dried fish and it's lived here
besides, it has good physiognomy
cat physiognomy? Sound odd
how else can I say it?
but it does sound rather odd
any way this cat has well cultured
better mannered than you
excuse me
it's the man from next door
he wants to pay his respects to you
excuse me
what?
that's why I came to pay him my respect
but...
rot the but
I bought the land
it's my land now
I can build whatever I like
that's true, but...
you must think about you neighbor
building a 3-storey house next to their fence is unreasonable
unreasonable
the surveying proved the lot is smaller
another floor must be added to the 2-storey house I planned
if you do that
you'll be depriving them of the sun
so what?
that's none of my concern
please wait
the negotiation is closed
please wait
I've changed my mind
what?
I'm not selling
don't be ridiculous
now that the contract is made
I haven't signed it yet
it's still my land
I absolutely will not sell that land to you
excuse me
I'm grateful to you for being so considerate about us
I can't thank you enough
but wouldn't is put you in a bad spot?
as for my house even though there's no sunlight
if that's the case...
but what...
let's do it
professor, I must say this cat has good qualities
the cat was angry at that blockhead
but that landowner...
seems to be a good man
where does he live?
he lives in a shack at the base of that lot
we must be leaving
stay a bit longer
I'm still upset
let's drink
I've prepared some food and...
sorry, ma'am
I must go
so must
goodbye
Nanzanju
professor, what does this Nanzanju mean
long life of Nanzan
an express wishing long life
should be read Nanzansu
I hung it up
because I am reluctant to talk to visitors
Nanzansu is what you want
Nanzansu is what you want
the Courtesan used this expression during the Edo Era
of course, it's shed for nan-zamasu
it's prefect for that blockhead
right
Nanzansu indeed
my god, he's annoying
I detest that dear man
goodbye, sir
goodbye
something strange is cooking up
why did they hurry off like that?
good baby, good baby, dear Nora
let me hold, too
Hey, let me
come on
if you consent to it
thank you
I can buy a small house with this and send for my family
I don't know how to thank you
you can thank our professor
he truly is grateful to you
we understand how he feels
so...
if he finds out about this deal it'll be awkward
I know
please keep this secret from him
he'll know in time but leave the lot as it is until then
you all are such nice people
you're a nice person yourself
but the best person is our professor
we try as best to imitate him
goodbye
that was good
by the way
Nanzansu
let's drink
where shall we go?
to the professor's
great idea
that's a charming idea
professor's in trouble
what's wrong?
he isn't sick
the cat disappeared
madam called me
wants we to come
professor hasn't stopped crying since the cat disappeared
dear
please
we received a call from Madan
are you all right?
of course I am
nothing more than a cat
I am alright
beside this isn't the first time
Nora has disappeared before
he'll come back
thank you for coming
I would be grateful you could spare time to eat with me
you'd do me a favor if you could
since Nora disappeared
he's eaten almost nothing
you may think I'm stupid
no...
to be honest... I am stupid
I'm totally hopeless
since Nora disappeared
I can think of nothing else
I can't do anything
I only think about Nora
do you see that willow tree
Nora came through an opening in the fence there
since then he became a member of this household
since Nora disappeared
I can't help...
Iooking at the opening
Nora might come through the opening
I want to see it
the other day...
I finished the lecture at Kaozhou
on the way back
through the window
in the dark station, I saw Nora
it may sound strange, but...
I really saw it
I say the true
this makes me headache
when I reached Tokyo station
I called my house
as I thought...
that day... after nightfull
Nora wanted to go out
I picked him up and said
stay home, it's late
he wanted to go out...
so I took him outside
Nora grew impatient and wiggled until he slipped out of my arms
he went through the opening
after a while...
it began to rain
and later it began to pour
Nora probably couldn't return in that rain
on the bathtub cover
is Nora's bed
my husband sometimes goes there
looks at the cushion
he caresses it dearly and weeps
I really don't know what to do
professor
I'm ashamed to show my miserable face
I may be...
sentimental
or over reacting or weak willed or whatever...
I just can't help it
I try to forget but keep remembering Nora
then I feel so much pain, I can't bear it
professor, we'll find Nora
we'll organize search to find Nora
so please, professor
that's a dog we promised to find Nora, but...
we should try...
searching places saved from fire
why should professor suffer so much?
our professor is very special
he's not you and me
his sensitivity and imagination are beyond us
when he thinks of Nora he can picture every detail
what's why he suffers
can't just sit and watch
you're right. Let's try
dear Nora
this is our professor's diary which he wrote about Nora with affection
here
there are cats everywhere hundreds around
but simply has to be this cat
how come?
do you have a brother?
sure I do
he's still a baby
if your brother is switched with some other baby
that's terrible
this cat is my baby
I care for him like my child
that's why it has to be this cat
tell me if you find him
what is look like is written here and address is here, too
children
please find a cat named Nora
this cat seems to be around here somewhere
it's a male cat with brown and while coat
his tail is thick and twisted
if you touch it, you'll now
if you call out Nora
he will prick up its ears and stare at you
a reward will be given to whoever finds him
please help us
yes
since then we received many phone calls
that they have seen a cat like Nora
but...
professor eating much
I know
he eats and drinks very little
I can't sleep much either
that's terrible
since Nora disappeared
he hasn't take a bath
Nora's cushion is on the top of the bath
I must use the public bath far away
is it rain?
I used to love the sound of rain
not any now
when I think of Nora
it's pain
how about making flyers to insert in newspapers?
I'll take them to the newspaper distributor
that's a good idea
I never thought of it
what a fool I am
I really am
thinking of Nora's return
I wrote this announcement
I meaning Nora
I have been away for some time and I have worried my master terribly and given you a lot of trouble
I have safety returned
so please put your mind to rest
seeing my face
my master burst into tear
I write this letter in his place
to celebrate my return my master wishes to invite you all to a drink
please feel free to
waiting for Nora's return
professor has a cloth ready specially with their address engraved on it
but Nora still hasn't returned
I received a letter saying
I must wait eight months a stray cat to return
this cat was in the letter after eight months
we've received some calls
there're strange ones, too
the other day a person asked me if Nora mevis
I said yes
then he said doesn't he bark Hee, hee...
and hung up
has your cat returned?
no
he might have been stolen
ma'am, cats often get stolen
there're cat catchers
catch cats and sell their skin
the prices aren't bad
shamisen uses cat skin
you could be stolen
I'll check up on that
good bye
hello
dear Dear
dear, they found Nora
Nora was in such a place
it's Nora, it's Nora
Nora
Nora
Nora's friend, the fish manger's wife says
must be true
thank you
my wife will go, thank you
Hello, Takayama?
they found Nora, yes, that's right
it's positive
can you tell the other?
I saw a wonderful dream
I dream of feeding Nora
Nora will return
I was going to tell you... and...
I bought Nora's favorite fish
professor, congratulations
from my boss
thank you indeed
cat's do return
they were wrong
it wasn't Nora
I'll get it
yes
that's right
who the hell are you?
I'll smack you face
what's up?
damn
Nora's gone
already a Shamisen
saying so...
he sounded the Shamisen
come here
come here
this was intended for Nora
but it's yours now
go on, eat it
is it good?
like Nora, you seems to like baby macerate
that's a good cat
professor seems to have recovered
madam called
the cat...
found Nora?
Relaz, it's not Nora
that black and white, black on white
white, black
you relax
calm down
give me water
that's why...
that's why what? Calm down
what's this black and white cat?
Oh, yes remember that cat?
the one madam was feeding?
it's there to stayed
professor now picks it up
Kurz...
what's this Kurz?
did you forget that simple German word?
kurz it means short in German
it has a short tail
what tail?
the cat's tail
the black and white cat has a short tail
so professor named it Kurz
even named it
he said he's okay
I'm glad to hear that
she wants us all to come tonight
I'll catch Kinyama
you fetch Sawamura
phone them
Yes, the phone
the phone's here
relax
Kurz...
you're a good baby
leave it to my wife and Kurz becomes kuru
kuru is not bad
it's easy to pronounce
easy to pronounce
let it be at that
I really went into piece over Nora
and troubled all of you
because of that, I caused you so much trouble
I'm sorry
Where's Kurz?
sleeping in Nora's bed
I was so angry to myself
and I felt very regret
can you believe it? I still do that
not mosquito repellent
incantation to bring back missing cats
I still do such a thing
I'm disgusted at myself
but I'm all right now
I've always been a hare in the myth
saved by the Harves God
don't you all know
there was a white hare in lnaba
raw flesh with skin peeled off this song?
carrying a large bag over his shoulder
who can the Harvest God?
that's the fourth verse
this song has many verse
it's about an injured hare saved by the Harvest God
I am that hare
and who can the Harvest God be?
it is no other than you all
as far as Nora is concerned people who sent me kind letters people who called me all those who worried for Nora with me
the Harvest God is those people
carrying a large bag over his shoulder
the Harvest God's large bag is full of your kindness
that kindness saved me from despair
carrying a large bag over his shoulder
the Harvest God came around the road
there he sees the white hare of lnaba
row flesh with skin peeled off
the Harvest God took pity on the hare taught the hare to wash itself in clear water and wrap itself in reed mace cotton
as the Harvest God taught him
the hare washed itself in clear water and wrap itself in reed mace cotton
he was once again the white hare
gentlemen
who could the Harvest God?
towers in memory of Nora and Kurz were erected in the professor's garden
Nora was never found
kurz living a full life sleep here
and the willow tree has grown to this height
the 17th Maaoha Kai party
I can remember the time
when I became 60 years old
at the time
I thought I had become a genuine old man
but now that I have turned 77 to celebrate my birthday once again
I realize when I was 60
I was nothing more than a young punk
but now...
I have become a genuine old man
at one time, you confronted me with so many Maadha Kai calls that in response
I thought of hanging myself from the willow tree in my garden
so I can say Mouiiyo to you
in fact, this tree
that tree was small and weak
it could not be hanged
but now
the willow tree has grown
it is good enough for hanging
but I am still here
I must ask your forgiveness
my good friends and gentlemen
thank you for this occasion
according to our customs
I would drink this big glass of beer
this glass is smaller than last year's
is this your idea?
the glass gets smaller and smaller
it's no longer a large glass
even that is too big for you now
don't complain and drink up
Madadayo
let's toast for our professor
congratulation
after we have finished the ceremony
we will start the celebration then
the celebration of 77th birthday
first, the presentation of flowers
they're your students' daughters
next
a birthday cake from Maaoha Kai
Oh no
you'll have candles to equal my age and I must blow them out
I can't do it
mustn't treat an old man so cruelty
since we can't have 77 candles
only 7 candles
even 7 candles may be a burden
some of my teeth are missing
much of the air leaks out
these children?
they're their grandchildren
how lovely they are
I feel like eating them
I want to give the cake to the children who brought it
come here, children with the cake, there is something
I want to give you
let me say this
please find something you really like
find something you'd able to reassure
when you find it
you must work hard
to remember it in heart
at that time
you will have the treasure
you must work hard for
and will you are a career
you put your heart into
that is yours treasure
maybe it is too difficult
I'm sorry
take it
thank you
now, all you grandpas and grandmas
dads and Moms
let's drink and have a good time
professor
let's do One-two again
as you say there is many things in the world recently
many ridiculous things happened
graft bribery are at large One, two
let's go out dancing
professor
professor
as the professor's family doctor
I must say there is nothing to worry
it is just one of his chronic irregular pulse lits
I suggest he goes home and rest for a while
I'm all right
don't worry
Madadayo
we officers will escort professor to his house
don't worry and continue the party for his sake
professor
my husband's cane
you don't look like to care about it
damn monk
don't worry, he's not ready for me yet
all right
thanks
looking up to our teacher
thinking of our debt to our teacher
over the garden of teaching
years of time have already passed
so fast is the passage of time
the years and the months
nothing to worry
if he rest well tonight, he'll be fine
I'm worry about those guys
they may cause trouble
don't wake the professor and have a drink
you're joking
we'll hit the sack
don't wet the bed
that quack
mattresses are in there
shall l...
we'll do it, ma'am
there may not be enough
I hope it won't be cold
don't worry
if we have a drink
that's good enough
but...
like our student days
remember his speech?
we'll soon be genuine old men, too
thank you, ma'am
there's nothing
thank you, ma'am
I'll sleep in the Kinkakuii
if anything...
don't worry
it's Okay
you mustn't wake professor
yes ma'am
good night
it's great
what is it?
when we used to stayed over
he made us prepare for the lessons
no need for that tonight
no go to school tomorrow
we've passed all that
Madadayo
he's sound asleep
he must be dreaming
I wonder what kind of dream he sees
his dreams must be solid gold, too
Maadha kai?
Madadayo
Maadha kai?
Madadayo
Maadha kai?
Madadayo
Maadha kai?
Madadayo
wow...
looking good...
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.
that dress needs dry-cleaning.
here you go. - Thank you kindly, Monica.
Monica, Monica? Oh shit, Hillary!
okay...
Hi, Bill. - Oh hey Snowwhite.
Where's 11B?
Bingo!
what did you say that thing was?
it's time for a little action.
Monica... It's Bill.
I've got some dictation for you, Monica.
I've got a big secret for you, Baby.
how did you get up here so soon?
Monica.
Oh my eyes! I can't see!
who let you in!?
what happened... Where's Monica? What happened to Monica?
how did you get in here? - She told me where the key was.
I can't see. - Did she say it was ok to dry-hump her roommate?
she said, you would be in the library cause you were a geek...
I am not a geek! God!
my God. What was that, mace?
"Eternity," by Calvin Klein.
I gotta be so careful who I get into bed with from now on.
it would be a big adjustment for you, wouldn't it?
God!
I do that every time.
I've invented a solution for that. Seriously.
it is something that goes around the coffee cup, so you don't burn your hand.
I'm gonna call it "The Coffee Collar." Brilliant idea.
I know all about you. I know you whole wrap.
you do? - Yeah. You're a senior...
who prays on freshmen. You've slept with half my floor.
well, half your floor was female. - What ever.
and you once met Bono, which I suspect is total bullshit.
no, it's true. He signed my CD.
it's upstairs in my room with my...
"coffee Collar," if you wanna see it.
are you hitting on me? - No. I'm going of your look.
my look... - Yeah, doggybull look.
are you calling me a dog? - No, it's a theory I have.
Oh, Casanova has a theory. - Yeah. When a girl is attracted to a guy, she has a look. It's her tell, like poker.
it's the same look a dog gets, right before you put down the bowl.
you're offensive. And you're crazy. - No, I'm honest.
I believe honesty is the best policy.
alright... You want me to be honest with you?
sure. - I'm majoring in fine art.
right. - I'm studying the golden proportions of the human face. And you're nose is bent and and it drips down at the bottom. A feature that is excentuated by the thinness of your upperlip. And your eyes, are too far apart, but they have to be to accominate that bent nose. And I feel sorry for you, that you have to validate yourself through insatiable-meningless-ego-sport-sex, with insecure girls like my roommate.
I... Would never have sex with someone... Like you.
hey come here!
that was amazing.
what was? - The honesty.
that was better than sex without the... The crying.
actually it did feel pretty good. - Yeah, no one's ever been that honest with me before. - It's called a friend.
I'm Tom, by the way.
well, good night.
good night.
your hands, Clammy... - Well, I can see that you're knocked out.
Tom, is that you? Can I see your Bono-autograph?
she's all yours, friend.
Monica, get some sleep.
what time is it?
I'm late.
what are you doing tonight?
I don't do "back to backs."
isn't that what we were doing last night? - No, that was something different.
back to Backs" is seeing each other two nights in a row. You know I don't do that.
couldn't you just break one of your stupid rules? - No.
for me. - I'm sorry, but I don't break the rules.
I have a rule about that.
see you next week.
Thanks.
excuse me. - Sorry.
can I get a grande drip, and a decaff, triple grande, non-fat, extra hot, stirred milk como lafietta.
with whip cream, extra caramel.
fill that 70% of the way. Thank you.
here, let me put a "Coffee- Collar" on that.
thank you. - I hear that the guy that invented that gets a dime for each one used. - You're kidding.
I am not. That could add up.
I think I picked up yours by accident. Sorry about that.
that's alright. Thank you. - Any time.
Byebye.
Gloria.
morning.
good morning, Hannah.
coffee, the way you like it.
perfect timing. I just finished working on his balls.
that's eh... Yeah! So I made a reservation.
so what rule is this? - No "back to backs."
isn't that the same as the "no more than once a week"-rule?
no, the "no more than once a week"-rule works monday to fridays.
so theoretically you could have a sunday night and monday whithout breaking it.
exactly, you got it.
here we go. Hey, good morning.
can I get the steamed buns the scallaped steamed ducklings and the vegetarian and shrimp steamed...
thank you. - For what?
you know how much I love the fried stuff. You look after me.
Excelent. So, what did you say?
she was hurt, but you know... - But you where honest, right?
what? I was. I am. Always!
I know you are, but it's just shocking to see how you use it as a shield.
maybe I should lie. Be more like Dennis Philips, and say what ever it takes to get a woman into bed. - No, do not be like Dennis Philips.
he's so gross. - He only hit on you once.
at my fathers funeral!
okay, so he's not known for his sensitivity.
Oh, God. Anyways...
what? - Nothing.
I know that "nothing." It's not nothing, it's something.
Anyway...? - Anyway we both know, you don't need to lie to get a woman into bed.
Gloria.
I don't wanna lose that. Can I keep that? Thank you.
see there's another rule too. The 24 hour-rule.
I can't call her for another 24 hours.
cause then it appears that I'm too desperate.
you know, Dan sent me another letter?
asking you to move to Canada and marry him again?
a slice of apple-crum pie? - No, we did that last time.
you guys broke up like a year ago. - 19 months.
you're counting? - No! He is... It was in the letter.
lemon butter cream cup?
not feeling the cream cup today.
cranberry orange muffin? - Hannah, come on. You're losing it.
I know, I know... Okay. - Think about it.
come on. You're disappointing. - I got it, I got it...
Yeah! - Wait, I so have it...
cream cheese soral brownie.
you're so good!
what do you think of this? I think we should get this.
Tom, I am not going to another one of your fathers weddings.
thank you. Hannah? Please?
take one of the girls you've been rubbing up against.
no weddings or family events.
that's right. I forgot that rule.
it gives the wrong impression. - It does.
is this made with real alligator? - Yes, baby-alligator.
you should be ashamed of yourself. - Look at you.
hello there... And who would you be?
I love you. Yes I do. I love you.
you're so pretty. Yes you are. You're beatiful. Yes you are. Your beatiful face...
I love you, love you, love you.
you should try saying that to a human sometime.
what? A human?
to say it to a human?
you're sweet. Love you.
Hannah, please. Come to the wedding.
he gets married and I go. I go because he's my father and I care deeply for the man.
and everybody knows he doesn't love them, and they don't love him.
it's pathetic, it breaks my heart. I don't know what to say.
you know when someone's making a mistake and it's not your place to interfer,
you simply say: "I'm happy you're happy."
I'm happy you're happy. - Yeah.
okay. I'll do that.
I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you to come.
and then I'll find somebody else to come to the next funeral.
Hannah, please.
that's cute.
last time. - Thank you. Thank you.
she gets the appartment in the city, and 30 grand a month.
right. Right, okay.
you get the house in the Hamptons, she's asking for the appartment in the city, and 30 grand a month. - Thirty? But...
are you still negotiating a pre-nup?
now the party starts... My son is here!
dad, your getting married in 10 minutes. Dad, please, I can't breathe.
did you bring the lovely Hannah? - Yes, I did.
you know, if you don't act on that pretty soon, you know what I'm gonna do?
no. - I'm gonna make her my number 6!
seven... This is number 6.
Yeah. - My God, you are pretty.
dad!
I used to be that pretty once. - Dennis, look how pretty my boy is.
Yeah, he's beatiful. They won't accept a minimum of 5 times a week.
she promised 5, I want 5. - What did she promise you, 5 times a week?
4 times? - Two!
no, no... We're not done yet.
she says 3, with a by-monthly BJ. - This is disturbing.
4 and make it weekly.
wait, no... Driver go around the block. We are not even close...
what was that?
come on. Come on, tell me.
say what you gotta say. - I'm happy, If you're happy.
no, no... "You're too old for her dad."
she doesn't love you, this is embarrasing.
you're gonna rack up your fifth divorce.
sixth. - Sixth.
I'm happy, if you're happy. - Bullshit!
go for 4 if you excercise more.
she says you can't gain any more weight.
take it. Deal! - Deal.
I told her I weigh 10 pounds more than I do.

what's he signing now? His current pre-nup and his last divorce-papers.
that's just great...
your good. Thank you.
Cheers. - Cheers.
did you tell your dad you love him? - I told him I cared for him.
you can't even tell your father.
I don't get that. - It's a "Guy thing."
no, it's a "Tom thing."
you're an "I love you-slut." - Are you kidding me?
you say it all the time. To everybody.
Oh, this looks so good. - Yeah, it looks good doesn't it?
I should have ordered this. This look good. You always order better than I do.
it's lemon, right? It's good. I'm ordering that from now on.
no, you won't. - Why?
I need you to order the chocolate cake so I can have some.
there's my "son"! - There you go...
Oh, you're bad boy I'm gonna spank you.
you know what I would like to say to you? Is that...
I want you to listen to me, Tom. - Yeah.
if you need any advice...
or you need any advice... - Right.
or you got girl problems, I don't know...
I need you to think of me how you would a real mother.
yeah that's excactly what I... - Look at this beauty, will you?
Hello, Sweety

you are a bad influence on her. - Me?

Oh stop it. - I'm serious...

the last blog was a 2 page description of my face.
see, she doesn't think my nose is too bent or my lips are too thin.
who said that? - You did. When we met.
well, I lied. - What?
I thought you were hot. - Really?
well, you told me I looked like a dog.
that was just cause I was trying to sleep with you.
why haven't you since?
well... I like having you in my life.
... - Hi, Tom!
Oh, hi! - Did you see the new blog?
no, we haven't.
who's this? - This? This is my girlfriend.
why didn't you tell me you were seeing someone?
because I don't know you.
but we have a really, really open relationship...
Really? - You know? I wanted to talk to you about that, - princess. - Princess?
I... I don't wanna be with anybody but you.
I don't know if i'm really quite ready to make that commitment...
are you? - You know my rules...
I'm bit of an emonitional retard. - Yeah...
I think I need to start a new blog now.
that is so scary. - She's psychotic on top of P.
Oh, this is not good.
SAIA da minha frente. - Ei!
okay, good... She's gone. Perfect. Let's go.
good, come on. What?
do you remember that encestral home in scotland, with those amazing paintings I told you about?
it's all I think about. - Stop it, Tom.
I finally got the board to sign of on making editions to a permanent collection.
Really?
but they want me to go to Scotland for an aquisitionstrip.
when are you going? - A couple of days.
couple of days? For how long? - Six weeks.
that's a long time.
that's great. - You think?
Yes, it's a great opportunity for you.
you're like the "museum maiden of the Met."
it's got a good ring to it...
thank you. - Congratulations.
six sundays.
that is six sundays. - What am I gonna do without you?
I can just imagine.
yeah... - What are you doing?
I'm gonna jump! - No, no.
I'm gonna jump. - Jesus!
six sundays, how can I live without you?
can you not take anything seriously?
Yeah, I can. - Get down.
let's get you another drink. - I think I've had too many already.
thanks for coming too the wedding. - It was a ball, - I can't wait for number seven. - It's coming up soon, I have a feeling.
we also ask at this time that you turn off all your electronic devices.
please leave your cellphones turned off for the duration of the flight.
I'm not gonna be able to play today, man.
if we don't have a fourth, we are gonna end up playing with "Tiny-Shorts Guy."
so? - Hey, how's it going?
need a nother? - No, our friend Paul, - with longer shorts, is coming. - Right.
no, Jenny signed him up for some art walk thing...
art walk? Are you serious? Tell me something,
what do you think Jenny did with his balls when she cut them off?
come on, guys, marriage isn't that bad.
I agree. Without marriage there would be no divorce, and without divorce I wouldn't have my condo in Aspen.
bingo.
good one. - What is he?
I'm serious, man. Your missing out on the best parts of life.
the most important part of life. - This coming from the guy who's wife won't let him own porn. He's gotta wank off to the underwear section of the Sears catalougue.
I thought we weren't gonna talk about that?
what's the matter with you? You are single and you've been single, ever since... What was her name?
Sophmore year. - Plim... Pimpkin, Pimpkin, that's it.
Pimpkin dumped you for him.
Sophmore year, you've never been the same you haven't been able to sleep.
Scarred... - Yeah. You have no idea, how nice it is to have someone who is gonna be there, no matter what, what ever.
snaps to that. - And you don't know how nice it is to sleep with a different girl every night.
that's true. - Nice revital.
you got the best of both worlds, Tom.
no, it's true. I can sleep with whoever I want,
but I still get to hang out with Hannah afterwards.
perfect setup. - Yeah, well maybe not for Hannah...
what's that supposed to mean? - Come on, Tom. She's a woman.
Yeah, I got that.
you sure? - Yeah.
Tom, she's pushing 30. You think her idea of "Happily ever after" is coming home to you and hanging out after you got laid?
makes you think, right? - Yeah.
Hallo? - Hey.
Hi. - How's the weather in England?
it's great. Only I'm in Scotland.
right, right. So it's sunny?
it's 3 in the morning. - Oh, right. Sorry.
so it's dark. - Yeah.
have you seen the Loch Ness Monster?
I know, terrible joke... - Was there something important?
Yeah. You'll never guess what happened.
what? - They filled in the pot hole.
the pot hole? - On 83rd.
terrific... Hey, Tom? - Yeah?
I'm gonna go back to sleep now. - Ok. Sure.
love you.
good night... Call me tomorrow.
this stuff's all old... - Yeah, that's the point.
let's go to Fendi... - Fendi? No.
we're here, let's just stay here.
I'm not into old stuff.
why do you talk like a six-year-old?
I'm not.
the line is too long...
can't we just go somewhere else? - No.
this is the best bakery in the world. That's why it's worth waiting in line.
come on. We'll play a game.
wanna play a game? - Yeah, I can play a game.
okay. Good.
tell me what to order. - Why?
you'll see. It will be fun. Make a suggestion.
a cookie. - No, you have to be specific, like what type of cookie...
a really big cookie.
Tom, your phone's ringing...
hallo. Hallo?
Hallo...
what's wrong? - Just an important call.
that's because you are an important person.
wait! Hey...
we will have...
2 fried dumplings, 2 of the watons and 6 of the fried "pork-thingies."
Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy. - Oh, come on. Have some of the fried...
it won't hurt you.
thank you.
move, please!
God.
this is unbelievable.
Hallo? - Hey, hallo?
Hallo? - Hannah?
Hallo? - Hey.
Tom? Tom is that you?
Tom? - Hallo?
Hallo? You're cutting out, I can't hear anything you're saying.
Tom? I'm stuck in a thunderstorm.
I'm surrounded by a wall of calves.
I'll call you when I get to the hotel... - I can't hear you.
Tom?
hallo.
Hallo! Hallo?
Hallo?
I hate Scotland.
having a hard time? - We're having a hard time...
Oh yeah? Wan't a hand? - Thank you, sir.
Yeah. - We would love it.
you'd better sit down, sir. - ...
sit down. - Sit, sit, sit.
here we go.
thank you. - No, no, thank you.
thank you. - Have a good afternoon.
you were wonderful.
Desista enquanto pode. - Here we go.
come on, Scott. - Let's go.
what you got, Gar? What you got, Gar? What do you got?
come on. - What do you got, Gary?
foul! Foul, Tom! What the matter with you today?
ahh... I think I might have feelings for Hannah.
come on, come on... Let's just play.
it's just...
without her, somethings off, and it's got me thinking that maybe there's more to life than just sleeping around.
I don't understand... - I'm not following...
come on, let's just play. Come on.
I'll take it out. - I know exactly what you mean, Tom.
Thanks. Here you go.
I'm gonna tell Hannah. When she gets home,
I'm gonna tell her that i wanna be with her, not marriage, just be together.
Yeah, that's romantic...
>You have one unheard message <
Hey, Tom. I'm back. God, I cannot wait to see you.
I don't care what you're doing tonight, cancel it.
we're going to dinner.
meet me at that new trendy place, next to the small greek place we hated, that used to be the Thai-fusion place we loved.
meet me there 8 o'clock, I have so much to tell you.
Hey, what have you got? - Hey Buddy. I'll find you something.
alright...
here's something. How many do you want?
I'll take the yellow ones. - Good choice. Ten bucks.
here you go. - Thanks.
have a good night. - I will.
sorry, is she already here? - Over there.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, God!
Tom, are you okay? - I'm alright. Are you alright?
I think I have a broken rib.
your flowers, sir. - They're not mine! I'm fine, I'm okay!
I'm okay. - Are you okay?
I'm so sorry. - You alright?
here are your flowers. - What, what...
you had flowers? - They're not my flowers.
they're your flowers. - I didn't have flowers.
Hi! It's so good to see you! - I've missed you.
great. - Come here, there's someone I want you to meet.
Oh good.
it started pouring and suddenly it was just me in a field of cows.
and, of course we're in Europe so there's no street signs anywhere - and it's getting dark... - And then she thought she was in some bad whalewolf movie. "Stay off the moors, Lassie."
anyway... all of the sudden, out of nowhere, Colin comes riding up on horseback.
can you believe it? A horse. - Oh...
he asked me if I needed any help.
you were a "Lady in distress," what was I supposed to do?
it was right out of a Bront's novel.
so anyway... He shows me to this charming little Inn,
were he procedes to buy me the most awful dinner I've ever had.
it was pretty bad, even by scottish standards.
then we just spend the next month travelling around the country, getting to know each other, visiting museums... It was.
perfect! - Perfect!
so... When it was time for Hannah to leave, I just...
I don't know, I just... Couldn't let her go.
so I got down on one knee... - And he proposed. And I accepted!
Wow! That's just... Huge, it's... - So the wedding's coming together very quickly.
sounds like it. - We're gonna be married in Scotland, - At Colin's parents summer home. - It's gonna be a pretty small thing.
we can't expect too many people making the trip over sea, just for a night.
the Fourth? - Right.
that's two weeks! - It's crazy, isn't it?
have you ever been to Scotland, Tom? - You know, I haven't.
you should see the wee church we're gonna have. - It's the same one Colin's parent's were married in.
it's pretty spectacular, just a walk from my destillery.
Destillery? - Colin's famliy owns the largest whiskey destillery in Scotland.
Tom. Look, If you're getting married I expect to be your "Best Man."
Tom... Will you be my "Maid of Honor"?
your "Maid of Honor"?
sorry.
what is it with you, man? I didn't...
excuse me... Excuse me! Did you see that?
made of Honor"?
that's fun stuff! But you're a guy!
go ahead... Just get it out.
so, what did you say?
did you say yes? - No!
no? - I didn't know what to say. I told her I'd think about it.
you need to think about wether your dress is gonna make your ass look big!
give me a break, come on! - Okay. Alright, let me think.
is she really in to this guy? - You should have seen them.
staring at him all moony like he shits unicorns.
that's not good, man. I'm thinking you're gonna have to do this.
you're gonna have to be the Maid of Honer.
what? - Yeah, I'm serious. Think about it, this will give you an excuse to be around Hannah all the time.
helping her out, being "the man behind the curtain..."
you'll be her confident.
and you can use that time to point out to Hannah that this is really crazy.
and that she doesn't even know this guy at all! - No, I'm not gonna do that. No way.
what? - No.
look, I don't know what your other options are.
you got a better chance of stopping this wedding, from "inside" than from another continent.
and they say that you can shorten this and wear it again, if you like.
come on man. If you're serious and you really want Hanna back from this guy,
you're gonna have to do whatever it takes.
whatever.
the dress is beautiful. - Thank you!
I am so happy you're gonna do this! - My pleasure.
for this wedding, I am willing to do what ever it takes.
I'm so excited! - Yeah, me too!
so let me tell you who the other bridesmaids are gonna be.
okay! - Okay. Stephanie...
Stephanie, great. - And she loves you!
good! - And my friend Hillary, from camp.
Hillary, I don't know Hillary.
she's the best - Okay.
and Melissa. - Oh, no!
I had to, Tom, she's my cousin. - No, she hates me!
well, you broke her heart. - She broke my nose.
it was an accident. - She hit me with her fist!
I was completely honest with her. I said: "Look, nothing serious."
and she agreed.
so sometimes our hearts don't match our mouths.
that's good, you should put that in your vowes.
and, she's been wanting to be my maid of honor since we were 5 years old, so now she's really gonna hate you.
here they are now.
okay. Well as your Maid of Honor, I promise to keep the peace.
Oh, hi!
Yes! The bride to be!
Hello, you must be Tom. - And you must be Hillary.
you look gorgeous.
Stephanie, how are you doing? So good to see you.
are you kidding! - It's you, Melissa.
look at that...
this was great. - This isn't akward...
go on. I'm gonna be fine.
Tom, have you met Colin yet? - Yes.
isn't he dreamy? - Absolutely.
could someone please pass me the Splenda?
could someone who's not a masogenist, please pass the Splenda?
Hallo? - Thank you, Stephanie.
it's Colin, you guys.
Hi, babe! Just a sec... Hi!
so cute!
we only have 9 days before we leave for Scotland, - so we have to act quickly. - Excactly.
I've been a "MOH" 6 times, so I'll organize everything that needs to be done, even though I'm not officially the "MOH" here.
what is a "MOH"? - M-O-H.
maid Of Honor.
Yes! - Oh, yes. That's clever.
no, it's going great. Very smoothly.
so we got the bridal shower bachorlerette, dress fittings, - The "kilt..." - I'll do the "kilt."
okay... perfect. - Okay.
shopping for Hannah's true self...
that's gonna be great. - So, what is Hannah's true self?
it's lingerie. For her wedding night.
how do you expect to be a good "MOH" if you don't even know that.
she's talking to me. - No, I didn't!
you just did. - Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.
did I break a rule?
how about we focus on the wedding part?
good idea. - Just for now...
okay, I need, dress sizes.
I'm a four. - Okay.
eight. - Sorry?
you know, Hillary... Do you think that maybe you'd just be more - confortable in like a, twelve? - No, it will be fine.
I'm doing the Dr. Riverbed fast. - Oh, yeah!
Yeah. - What is that?
water, peachraisin/aplepect in shark extract,
and Lowry's Seasoning Salt.
what about food? - Look,
I'm going to look amazing in that dress, I am going to meet a Scottish man, and...
I'm gonna be happy! Write down an eight!
got it.
what's your dress size, Made Of Honor?
I don't know. What's your jock size, Melissa?
that's enough! Enough!
sorry. But will you guys look at Hannah, please.
she's happy, finally.
so please, for Hannah, let's all just get along, put a smile on our faces and pretend everything's perfect!
here she comes. - Okay. Fine.
what did he say? - He's so sweet!
isn't that great?
how's it going?
good, really good. - Fantastic.
and it's pretty much done. - Perfect, really?
Tom. - Yes?
here. - What is this?
she does bridal shower entertainment. And I hired her for Stephanie's sisters shower, and Hannah loved it. She reads Tarot cards and stuff.
that's great. Thank you, Melissa.
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it for Hannah.
okay. Thank you, for Hannah.
