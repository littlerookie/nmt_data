the a350 and the 787 are at the heart of the long-running and acrimonious dispute between boeing and airbus at the world trade organisation (wto) over state subsidies for large commercial aircraft.
the a350 family is set to hit the market in 2014, although it has faced rollout delays.
the a350 is supposed to be the company's answer to boeing's new twin-aisle 787 aircraft.
the a350 is the first airbus passenger jet to use both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, resulting in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance. This is where the comparison to the 787 dreamliner becomes apt.
the a380 began commercial flights in 2007 carrying around 500 people.
