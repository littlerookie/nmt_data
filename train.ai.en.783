or maybe she could, and she was just a b-i-t...
you were about to say "a very powerful woman who has worked hard for her success"?
I was about to say maybe she was a bit uneven.
life isn't black-and-white. Don't reduce daphne's.
I matched time code to office phone records.
thiss stephen burkett on the phone with daphne zimmer five days ago.
Oh, the assistant?
wait for it.
wait for it.
Oh, daphne's not the only one with anger issues.
nice.
Yeah, i kinda lost it. - Kind of?
I had plans to go to the shore that weekend.
uh, it was friday night.
daphne tells me that i have to get a scarf for the mayor's wife's birthday, and i spent my whole weekend chicago i'm sorry. Uh, time-out.
you went to chicago to get a scarf?
I... Daphne has a favorite designer there...audra avery.
it was friday night. She wanted it sunday.
express delivery was not an option.
that's the most ridiculous errand i've ever heard of.
I'd snap, too.
I might even ask myself how i'd get back at that person,
particularly if that person were keeping me from my higher calling...
uh, writing professionally, gaining recognition.
you think i killed daphne over a writing competition?
you had motive, opportunity, and...
plenty of anger.
you want to talk about motive?
do you have any idea how many rich people daphne's pissed off in this city?
still no d. n.a. On the hair from daphne's pool.
my guess is stephen burkett.
Daphne, uh, sent him to chicago to pick up some scarf.
he was really pissed off about it.
when did that happen? - He left four days ago.
then he didn't kill her.
after death, the cells break down and potassium levels rise.
daphne's potassium levels are way too high for somebody who was dead for only two days.
so you're saying that she was killed while stephen was out of town?
I will know for sure when we get a timeline from curtis' maggots.
meanwhile, look at this.
I sectioned a renal artery looking for the causes of her kidney problems.
you see that blue material? - Yeah, what is it?
old suture granulomas from kidney surgery, and this...
is an almost completely healed fracture of the cheekbone.
I think daphne's health problems started after somebody beat her up.
there's no hospital record.
she took care of it privately.
I'm sure there's a number of doctors who owed her a favor.
what are those? - Articles.
daphne took down some very big names in the past two years, so i'm guessing one of these guys was trying to get revenge.
how long ago do you think she was assaulted?
those suture calluses look about a year old.
september. A month prior.
so...
the department store magnate?
that affair was the talk of the town. Cost him $50 million.
I will look into him.
could you try not to enjoy that so much?
somebody's having a rough day.
it's just...
there's no roots on the hair, so no nuclear d. n.a.
it's the only evidence from the killer, and i'm a little stressed, so a little quiet would go a long way.
did you hear that? Eat quietly.
now i can try to extract the mitochondrial d. n.a. From the shaft.
what happened?
uh, it...it--it just-- it--it fell apart.
so the mysterious hair...
it's human, caucasian, and really weird.
traces of arsenic and lead.
the killer has two different kinds of heavy metal poisoning?
I tested it twice. It's...it's bizarre.
what about mitochondrial d. n.a?
samples are pretty degraded.
you know, bones, teeth, and hair are sorta your thing, so i was hoping you would not mind, uh...
do your job for you?
I'd settle for "with you.
okay.
why don't you just go to the club?
she doesn't want me there. She wants me there, in front of her friends.
well, maybe today, she just wants your company.
Luke tillman-- convicted ofssaulting daphne a year ago.
he only got three months.
how did he pull that off?
well, daphne refused to testify. Three months was all the d. a. Could get.
why would she refuse to testify?
it's public. When you're a power player, you can't afford to show your weakness.
so where's tillman now? - Dead.
shanked in prison. - Convenient.
too convenient. Tillman worked in shipping. Guess where.
Colin lloyd's flagship store.
how about that?
so he sends tillman to beat up daphne, and then a year later, he kills her?
you've never been divorced. - Amen.
so how do we get to colin lloyd?
Oh, don't look at me.
he'll be lawyered up to the gills.
Peter? - Yeah?
do you own a tuxedo?
here you goh, thanks.
it's been ages. - Oh, suzanne.
Suzanne, this is my colleague, peter dunlop.
Jim and suzanne pollato. They own nicoise restaurant.
Oh, right. - Colleague?
well, someone has to be.
what are you doing these days, megan?
you're a mortician, right?
uh, medical examiner, actually.
did you hear about daphne zimmer?
I'm working on her case.
Oh, good lord. I just decided to be cremated.
how about a drink inside, huh? - Good idea. Lovely to see you both.
do you see lloyd anywhere? - Relax. Act like you own the place.
I don't even own this tux, megan.
well, speak of the devil. There's colin lloyd himself.
and here we go.
Oh, my. Oh! Darling. I was sure you wouldn't come.
Oh, i was, too. - Hi. How are yohow are you?
and who's this? - Peter dunlop.
hello. - Hi.
well, he's marvelous.
we, uh, work together.
of course you do.
Brendan, i'd like you to meet my daughter megan.
Joan has told me a lot about you.
Oh, i'm sure that was excruciating for you.
only the good things, dear.
now there are so many people i want you to meet,
so-- brendan, do you happen to know colin lloyd?
Colin? Sure.
would you mind terribly introducing me?
not at all.
Colin. This is megan hunt, joan'saughter. - Oh, brendan.
Ah, how do you do? - Hello.
you're every bit as beautiful as your mother.
that's an amazing dress. - Oh, thank you.
would you mind taking a photo with me? - Absolutely. I'd be delighted.
what do you know about luke tillman?
what the hell? - He used to work for you.
what are you getting at? - You are aware that she was recently murdered?
Megan, what on earth are you - are you...are you excusing me?
she cost you $50 million. What happened? Sending tillman to beat her up wasn't enough?
who the hell do you think you are - a medical examiner,
and if i find out you had anything to do with her death, i'll nail you to the wall.
thank you for the invitation, mother.
I think we're done here.
Joan. - I...i don't know what to say.
you didn't have to make a scene back there just to get a hair sample.
uh, actually, i did.
I had to startle lloyd enough to get him to open his eyes.
which are common birthmarks, but his were rather large, so then i looked at his irises.
what are tho flecks?
Lisch nodules-- tiny benign growths on the irises.
they're associated with a disease called neurofibromatosis type 1.
now watch this.
they both have them.
I don't suppose that's a coincidence. - No, it is not.
Timmy akers, the intern at daphne's magazine, is colin lloyd's son.
you are colin lloyd's son.
Yeah. How'd you find out?
you have your father's eyes.
Akers-- your mom's maiden name?
that's right.
I want nothing to do with my father.
strange timing, you joining the magazine a year ago,
right after daphne's written that article skewering your father.
how do you think i got this job?
I was the one that came to daphne with the story on my father.
she gave me an internship in return.
daphne was assaulted after that article came out.
were you aware of that? - I had no idea.
but i wouldn't put it past my father.
you expensed travel to and from daphne's house?
you've been there dozens of times over the last few months.
you must know the house well.
hold on. You think i did it?
I liked daphne. She gave me a chance when no one else would.
she trusted me.
Why? Why did she trust you?
because i understood her.
she wasn't the monster people made her out to be.
she needed some help, so i ran some errands for her.
what kind of errands? - Anything she wanted.
food, if she was at home, or books, or heating pads, a space heater once-- she was always cold-- and bottled water.
she couldn't drink enough.
aches, chills, thirst-- they're all connected to her kidney damage.
I appreciate you teeing up stephen and lauren and timmy for me,
but you know what would be even more helpful? A cause of death.
hell, i'd even settle for a time of death.
believe me. No one is more frustrated than i am.
mom, what are you doing here?
it was graceless, insensitive, and wildly inappropriate.
I thought daphne was your friend.
and--and besides, colin lloyd--he had it coming.
you think this is about colin lld? You embarrassed me and yourself.
well, you know, i don't feel embarrassed, so i guess it's all about you.
no. It's about my friends. And daphne was my friend.
you know i owe her my career because of the article she wrote years ago.
you have no idea how i'm going to miss her.
what a lonely world you inhabit in that head of yours.
I feel sorry for you, megan.
you don't know what it's lik to have friends.
you know what? You're right. I don't.
cause after my accident, after i lost my profession, my standing...
where were my friends? Where were you?
I was right here for you. - No, you weren't.
you were embarrassed.
you were too worried about your friends.
they're all like this? - Yes.
thank you.
well, according to your analysis, daphne's killer is high on opium,
poisoned by various metals, and puts resin in their hair for reasons unknown.
it is an odd series of traits. - Odd? Yeah, the person is certifiable, ethan.
all right, let's look for any contamination and run another p. c.r.
let's try to get a match to some of our suspects.
you got it.
yes? - Nothing.
it's just, uh, you're being really nice to me...Which, don't get me wrong, it's...It's really great-- but...
it can't be because of me.
my private life is private. Let's leave it at that, all right?
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
can you fax that for me, please?
Hey. Where's ethan on the hair from the pool?
stuck. Uh, no matches to lloyd or anyone at the magazine.
so no signs of trauma, no drowning.
she was ill, but not terminal.
got something for you.
he went from stage two to stage three just a few minutes ago.
you got a time of death?
this little guy was id approximately 70 hours ago.
wait. So daphne was dead for two days after all?
Yeah. And there's something strange about this guy.
his growth is stunted.
is he diseased? - He's high.
I tested his family. They're alll of acetylsalicylic acid.
aspirin? That could spike her potassium levels.
the last thing you wanna take for kidney disease.
unless she didn't know she was taking it.
only two of these people had access to daphne's medical records.
and thanks to curtis' bugs, one of them... Just lost his 4-day alibi.
two days?
two days. You're positive now?
bugs don't lie.
so stephen had time to come back from chicago and kill her with... Aspirin?
daphne's system was extremely sensitive.
when luke tillman assaulted her, she sustained kidney damage, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to hypercalcemia, causing paranoia and mood swings.
but the kidney damage also elevated her potassium.
promise me when you tell him that, it'll actually make sense.
giving her aspirin was like throwing gasoline on a fire.
her potassium levels spiked, and her heart stopped like that.
daphne complained of headaches all the time. She wanted the aspirin.
aspirin or other painkillers?
I-I didn't know it was dangerous. - Oh, come on.
you screened every call she took, including doctors.
you mean to tell me you didn't know what aspirin would do to her?
no. I had no idea how sick she was.
Stephen... Help yourself. It's time for the truth.
you--you gotta understand.
every pill i slipped her was... A day of freedom from daphne hell.
she'd stayome, and i could get some writing done,
which is the only reason that i put up with her in the first place.
you never noticed, the more aspirin you gave her, the sicker she became?
no. Wait a second. I wasn't trying to hurt her. It was only aspirin.
that, my friend, is called involuntary manslaughter.
Congratulations.
I hear that stephen burkett's under arrest.
Oh, i thought that'd bgood news.
potassium-induced cardiac arrest is a diagnosis of exclusion.
we know her heart stopped. We don't know why. Aspirin's all we got.
it's all we need, along with stephen's confession.
if stephen goes to jail and the killer remains free because we couldn't find cause of death, - that's a triple tragedy. - Megan, it's all we have for the moment.
just try and take your mind off the job. Okay?
look, a bunch of us are going out tonight. 8: 00 at the j bar on south street.
why don't you come?
Oh, i don't know if i can. My mother called. She wants me to have dinner with her.
she wants a truce.
then you should do that.
why now? - What do you mean?
I mean, this is the first time you've ever invited me to anything.
don't look so shocked. We just wanna hang out with you. That's all.
that is it. - What?
you are a... Genius.
did i miss something? - No, i did. See those?
epicardial petechiae.
microbleeds around the heart.
from the aspirin, right? - Nope.
now look at this.
see those bands?
Myofiber breakup. It's extremely rare.
I've only seen one paper on it.
so what is it?
daphne's heart cells changed dramatically in the last seconds of her life, which means only one thing.
cause microscopic trauma, and pass for potassium-induced cardiac arrest, all without leaving a trace?
what?
daphne was electrocuted.
there's electrocution, there has to be an exit wound.
bring that light over here, will you?
everything's on.
it's not the pool outlets.
main outlets look fine. No sign of a power surge.
turn on the garden lights.
looks like a small bulls-eye.
that's where the current left her body.
her waterlogged skin hid the mark.
okay, so... What are these?
contact burns. Some kind of grill?
Timmy mentioned buying daphne a space heater.
find out what kind. - Okay.
alcohol, opium, and arsenic...
opium and arsenic.
wait a second.
bingo.
looks like charring.
this outlet's shorted out.
something was plugged in here.
finally have some news for you on that hair from daphne zimmer's pool.
it was chock-full of everything-- alcohol, opium, various metals.
we just assumed it was fresh hair.
trace alcohol was actually absinthe and the opiates were laudanum.
laudanum? No one uses that anymore.
add to that high concentrations of heavy metals, and your hair is over 100 years old.
possibly victorian. They used to put hair in jewelry as keepsakes.
okay.
I'll tell bud to get a warrant.
so, ms. Matthews, it doesn't look good for you.
we pulled this lock of hair from daphne zimmer's pool.
and once we match it to the locket you're wearing, we can place you at the scene of the crime.
we were friends. Daphne let me swim in her pool all summer.
I assume you have a key. - Yeah.
you wanna see it? - Where you going?
how many times a week did you, uh, swim...
this is dr. Hunt.
is your wrist bothering you? - Yeah.
Oh, that's a nasty burn.
Oh, yeah, i just burned myself in the kitchen.
no, you didn't.
you went to see daphne that morning.
you were pissed.
because you had to compete with interns for the journalism award.
I've worked foyou for 11 years. - I reward good writing, not seniority.
the two of you fought.
I trusted you! You witch! - Lauren, get out of here!
daphne grabbed your necklace, and the lock of hair fell into the pool.
you thought, 11 years of service overlooked.
you lost control, saw the space heater, and... Threw it in the pool.
No! Don't!
when you realized what you'd done...
I'd like to thk that you tried to save her.
you went to unplug the heater and shocked yourself.
and that's when you burned your wrist.
after the circuit was blown, you took it out of the pool, thought you left nothing behind.
but you were wrong.
rose gold contains copper. Copper conducts electricity.
that is an electromagnetic burn on your wrist.
I had, uh, gone there to complain, and, uh, she fired me.
it was an accident. She just
Lauren matthews, you're under arrest for the murder of daphne zimmer.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you can't afford an attorney, an attorney will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights?
good-bye, daphne.
where is kate? - She is not coming.
how about dr. Hunt?
well, i guess she can't make it either.
figures. Boys' night! - All right.
let's do it. - Yeah!
I didn't give up
I grew up not far from here.
Really?
I took you for more of an Upper Darby kind of guy.
the whole neighborhood backs up to the Wissahickon.
that park was my refuge.
from what?
Oh, ballet, pajama parties, Scott Baio.
three sisters.
Oh! You had it rough.
I survived.
I don't even know what time it is.
if you were on your lunch break, what time did you get back to the house?
he's in here.
what do we know, detective?
well, no sign of forced entry. He let the killer in.
my guess is, this was personal.
I meant about him.
his wife Jen found the body, called 9-1-1.
they were both home in the middle of the day?
he's a stay-at-home dad, makes custom furniture.
she works as an accountant.
says she came home at lunch to feed the baby.
did you find the weapon yet? - Not yet.
he's got defensive wounds on both of his hands, tan line - on his wrist, probably from a watch. - A beat-up Timex.
stainless steel, according to his wife.
Oh, maybe our killer took a souvenir.
did she touch anything besides the body?
just the phone... and the baby.
Why?
did she tell you anything else?
uh, yeah. Son Michael, age 15.
he's at football practice, doesn't know anything yet.
I'll go tell him.
please don't do that.
why not?
his father's dead.
he should hear it from his mother, not a cop.
all right.
I'll leave that part out.
Megan, we don't know where your mother is, so I'm just gonna tell you.
your father's dead.
can I help you?
Yeah, I'm... I'm looking for Dr. Hunt.
you have an appointment? - You her secretary?
uh, no, I'm her boss.
Oh. Sorry.
uh, Todd Fleming.
I'm her ex-husband.
and good luck with that. - With what?
no one's Megan's boss. - Todd?
what's wrong? Is Lacey okay? - Oh, yeah. No, Lacey's fine.
what are you doing here? - Always nice to see you, too, Megs.
she's all yours.
I'm here because I have a case going to trial on Monday, and I need a forensic anthropologist.
I'm not a forensic anthropologist.
I'm aware of that.
that's why I'm here to see Dr. Murphy and not you.
fine.
but I do, uh, I do need a favor from you.
I've, uh, I've got this huge mountain of preparation work to do, and I was wondering If you could take Lacey on, uh, well, tomorrow.
Yeah. Sure. - Yeah?
Yeah. - Well, she's at a slumber party tonight.
you can pick her up at 11: 00 tomorrow morning.
here's the address. - Got it. No problem.
okay? - Mm-hmm.
you sure? - Todd...
I'm just saying... 11: 00, okay?
thank you.
four stab wounds to the chest, uh, one the stomach, contusions on the chest and the arm, both look recent, and...
huh. There's something in the stomach wound.
looks like... coffee grounds.
it's from an ulcer.
the brown color is caused by the blood mixing with the stomach's acid.
the motion of the murder weapon brought it to the surface.
he's got ulcers from biting the inside of his cheeks.
and he's been bruxing, too.
this guy was stressed about something.
uh, Ethan, hand me the manganese solution, will you?
what are you doing?
I'm using manganese sulfate to test for hydrogen peroxide.
hydrogen peroxide interacts with the blood's catalase enzyme.
I saw that same reaction on the floor of the crime scene.
hydrogen peroxide, as in like... - Household cleaners.
wait, you're leaving? - Don't do anything more till I get back.
did your husband have any enemies?
not that I know of.
everybody loved Ed.
and we were doing so good, and then... then this.
Where's my son? Why... why isn't he here yet?
my partner went to pick him up. They'll be here shortly.
excuse me.
Dr. Hunt, hi.
she told you that she didn't touch anything but Ed's body - the baby, and the phone, right? - Right.
she's lying.
you told the police that you checked to see whether your husband was dead and then called 9-1-1.
Yes.
we found traces of hydrogen peroxide on your husband's face, and also in the blood on the kitchen floor.
Dr. Hunt thinks whoever killed your husband cleaned up after he was dead.
and you think I did it?
I don't understand what I'm doing here.
if someone broke in, where was my dad?
your mom will fill you in. Just here to give you a ride.
what position do you play?
benchwarmer.
asthma... hardly ever acts up, but they still sit me most of the time.
never made it off the practice squad myself.
it sucks. I love to play, though.
I'm in a touch league on weekends.
we got a game tomorrow. - Your parents ever come to see you play?
Yeah, right. Dad's too busy with the baby, and mom never leaves the office.
but your... mom comes home every day to feed the baby, right?
news to me.
but whatever.
the whole world revolves around Sophie now.
why would I hurt him? Everything was great.
well, I can pretty much guarantee, all was not well with your husband.
your husband had a bleeding ulcer and ulcerated gums.
what was he so stressed about?
money.
a new baby.
do you have any idea how difficult it is to work and raise a family at the same time?
but we were making it work, together.
what's going on, mom? Where's dad?
Oh, Mike.
your father's dead.
I am so sorry to keep you waiting this long. Kate Murphy.
Todd Fleming. Not a problem at all.
the office is never far away.
so... Megan's ex-husband, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm quite the curiosity, aren't I?
I looked at the file you sent over... Manny Santos.
Yeah.
not your typical "McKinney and White" client.
Yeah, I'm taking the case pro bono.
it's good for the soul. - Really?
I thought pro bono work was a bar association requirement.
kinda like your consulting fee.
Yeah, I'm not really sure how I feel about vouching for somebody accused of felony carjacking.
no, no, I... it was a joyride gone bad.
look, Manny is a good kid. He just messed up.
the problem is, the prosecution wants to try him as an adult, which could mean serious jail time.
he doesn't have a birth certificate?
no, he's illegal. - Ah.
his mom died about two years ago, - so he's been living with his uncle, who... - Also illegal. Got it.
so you need me to verify Manny's age?
all right. Why don't you bring him in on Monday?
actually, the trial is at 9: 00 that morning. How's tomorrow?
Lacey? Hi. It's me.
Oh, hi.
uh, I saw your father today.
uh, yeah. He told me you're picking me up tomorrow.
you are, right? - Uh, yeah. Are you okay with that?
Yeah, sure. - 'cause, you know, the last time we saw each other, you said I was pushing too hard.
you're just taking us to our riding lesson. - I'm what?
Yeah, me, Betsy, and Sarah, before Yearbook Club. Dad didn't tell you?
uh, no, but, um...
that's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
I know that look.
actually, so do I.
I just got off the phone with Lacey.
I thought I was spending the whole day with her, alone.
no.
you're providing transportation for your child and her friends.
it's called parenthood. Now if that's too much to ask...
no, no, no. I... look forward to meeting her friends.
okay, good. Good-bye, Dr. Murphy.
good-bye.
so correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you working tomorrow?
got it covered.
it appears Ed was an excellent father.
and yet, you still think his wife could've done this?
the stab to the left ventricle is what killed him.
the rest were postmortem, so Bud's right.
this was personal.
the wounds are 61/2 inches deep, cut by a unique blade.
uh, the surfaces were punctured at entry, not cut.
both sides were serrated.
what kind of knife is completely serrated?
ed made furniture, didn't he?
I walked in, and, uh, it was quiet.
and... I went to go...
check on Sophie.
and... and that's when...
and, uh, what did you do next?
I, uh, I knelt down next to him, and... he wasn't breathing.
and then I called 9-1-1, but I knew...
your son seemed a little surprised that you'd come home for lunch.
ed s... Ed said he was having problems with the baby, so he called, and I came.
do you come home for lunch often?
as often as I can.
it hasn't exactly been easy with the baby.
and Mike... how's he been?
you know boys.
they're not exactly baby crazy.
Mm-hmm. - But he's a great kid, and he's really gonna have to step up now.
all right, Jen. Thanks.
Mrs. Russell.
so she stabs him, he goes down, and then she stabs him a few more times for good measure.
okay, so now it's a mess, and?
voila, she grabs one of these to clean up.
and calls 9-1-1 before she's finished?
why clean up if you're gonna leave the body?
murder's not a clearheaded act.
Mnh-mnh. No.
she knew exactly what she was doing.
maybe she was covering for someone.
what do you got? - This can't be Jen's print.
no, but it could be her son's.
Mrs. Russell, answer our questions.
we know you cleaned up your son's footprints.
why did you think he killed his father?
ed had contusions from a recent fight.
was that with your son?
we confirmed that he skipped school yesterday.
Mrs. Russell, please, just tell us where Mike is.
I don't know.
am I under arrest?
sit on her till you hear from me.
she could be wrong, you know? - How's that?
Yeah, she cleaned up footprints she thought were her son's.
what if she was wrong?
but what if she wasn't? We gotta talk to Mike.
good luck finding him.
this is some way to grieve.
what do you expect me to do, sit at home with my mom?
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
unless you got something to feel guilty about.
anything you wanna tell me? I checked with your principal.
you neglected to mention you cut school yesterday.
I went to meet someone. - Who?
a girl. - She have a name?
Carla. That's it? Carla?
look, I don't know her last name.
we met online. I was going to meet her for real yesterday.
Where'd you go?
I didn't. I chickened out. I went to an Arcade instead.
look... don't lie to me, kid.
your father and you had a fight the day before he died.
What'd he do, ground you? - Yeah, so?
so maybe you snapped, went into the garage, - grabbed one of his tools, stabbed him. - I didn't kill my dad.
well, who did? Carla?
No! I... I don't know. I...
wait. There's this guy Jake. Sometimes he gets...
my dad hires him to help him with his furniture stuff.
he might have done it. - And let me guess...
this joke... you don't know his last name either, do you?
Hey.
any word from Bud on the son? - The kid gave him a tip.
he and Sam are on their way to bargain outlet, - looking for a day laborer who worked with Ed. - Good.
good? - I'm just... I'm having a hard time trying to imagine what would drive him to kill his father.
neglect? - He was a stay-at-home dad, and from what I can tell, a good one.
to his baby girl, but maybe not so much to Mike.
I mean, sometimes kids get lost in the shuffle, you know?
I know we're missing something.
what is that?
my mom taught me that the key to carpool is snacks...
pretzels, chocolate, gum.
I want Lacey to like me, not have her teeth fall out.
you'll thank me later on. - Mm-hmm.
shouldn't you be going soon?
Oh, damn it.
how many sisters?
three.
bring the bag.
so we're just supposed to believe this kid?
Mike's mom's clammed up.
we have no physical evidence saying it's him.
okay, so now what?
you hate your kitchen. - What?
look, you can hate your kitchen, or I can hate my kitchen.
like that's gonna work.
Hey, fellas!
I hate my kitchen.
who's gonna help me fall in love again?
Hey!
get up. Come on.
get up.
nice watch.
it was a gift! Ow!
worth killing for?
come on.
I don't believe it.
Hi.
hello. I'm Lacey's mom.
nice to meet you. - Hello.
Hi. - Hi.
you're late and working. - Uh, sorry.
okay. - Who are you?
I'm Peter. I work with your mom. - On dead people?
well, that's right. As a matter of fact, there was a guy killed yesterday named Ed Russell, and we're trying to find out who did it.
and, uh, you could give your mom a break.
okay, so... who wants a tasty cake?
ed gave me the watch as payment.
he was short on cash.
so why'd you run away?
who knows what you're trying to put on me?
you mean like, uh, burglary, theft, trafficking in stolen property? Read your rap sheet.
things have a way of going missing when you're around.
I didn't take anything from Ed. - Really?
because we found this rasp in your tool chest.
it's the same length as the one Ed was murdered with.
now we're about to send this to the lab to test for his blood, unless you wanna save us some time.
ed was my friend.
he knew I had some trouble in the past. He cut me a break.
I swear to you, I didn't kill him.
Hi. Todd Fleming. I'm here to see... - Good morning.
Dr. Murphy, hi.
how are you? - This is my client, Manny Santos.
Hello, Manny. - Hello.
well, establishing an exact age scientifically is problematic.
I mean, nutrition, genetics, childhood trauma... can all influence growth.
we can run an epiphyseal plate evaluation, but just by eye, I can tell you his subcutaneous adipose tissue appears prepubescent, as does his lack of facial hair and muscle definition.
of course, there is an easy way to determine puberty.
you want me to do what?
check the tanner stage of development of his you-know-whats.
this is way beyond my job description.
I need this determination as soon as possible.
then you check his you-know-whats.
you're a doctor. I don't see him letting me do it.
tengo que chequear sus cojones.
are sure you don't want one? The girls loved 'em.
Yeah, they loved you.
I thought you were with your daughter today. - So did I.
we heard that you might have the murder weapon.
Mm-hmm. - Looks like a fit.
Yeah, except forensics didn't find any blood.
hold on.
there's something in the subcutaneous tissue.
yeah?
they look like...
fish scales.
they didn't come from Ed, so they must be transfer from the killer, right?
well, I've heard of guys using a rasp to take off fish scales, so maybe he works in a supermarket, a restaurant...
pet store? Okay, maybe not a pet store.
guys, they're not fish scales.
they're flakes of human skin.
I think you'll be fine on your own.
get me an H&E stain and call me with the results.
so how was riding class?
okay.
how's your case going?
my what? - Ed Russell? Peter told us.
uh, the police think it was the teenage son.
what do you think? - I hate to think that any child could hate their parent that much.
go ahead, Ethan. - Okay.
I've got the stain. What am I looking for?
mild regular epidermal acanthosis with overlying hypogranulosis.
and... check...
and check.
do you see any plugging of the follicular orifices?
um, uh, hold on. Just, uh...
Yes. Yes, I do. Um...
but... but it's not eczema. There... there's no inflammation.
it's ichthyosis. It's a hereditary disease.
uh, you're gonna have to run the DNA to confirm it, but tell Bud whoever killed Ed Russell has peeling skin, like the aftermath of a sunburn.
okay, I'll let him know right now.
okay, I just gotta tell you, that was awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
okay.
drop 'em.
guess who diagnosed some ichthyosis?
I don't wanna know. - Ethan.
seriously, don't tell me.
shut up and get over here.
Hi.
what do you make of this?
you're gonna need a full body x-ray.
you can put it down.
roll up your sleeves.
don't you need a warrant?
no. We caught you with the dead guy's watch, and you're worried about a warrant?
Ed's killer had a skin condition called ichthyosis.
now roll up your sleeves, or the warrant I get will be for a cavity search.
have a nice day.
that's it?
Yep. Get him outta here.
let's go.
to your right, down the hall.
any other symptoms come with this condition?
sweating... the only way the body releases heat... some breathing problems... congestion, asthma.
asthma?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know where Mike is.
he didn't come home after his football game?
and I'm starting to worry.
that's why we got this warrant to search Mike's room.
Mike has ichthyosis, doesn't he?
what does that have to do with anything?
yesterday at the police station, you couldn't look him in the eye...
because you were looking at his feet to see if he had blood on them.
please, just stop.
I know this must be impossible for you.
Mrs. Russell, what happened?
why were they fighting?
ed wanted to take Mike's computer, and Mike was so angry.
I... I just can't believe that he would do something so horrible.
I hate him. I'd like to make him disappear.
okay. Here are all the posts between Mike and Carla.
uh, looks like they met on this site.
there's a lot of getting- to-know-you stuff at first, but then Carla wants specifics...
uh, school, grade, hair color, birthday...
pretty soon Mike's just pouring out his heart.
he's on my ass all the time. Can't do anything right.
wants to take my computer away.
which would mean good-bye, Carla.
and hello, motive. They've been talking about getting together and running away.
so Ed finds out, tries to stop him. That's the final straw.
Mike kills him.
and winds up missing his rendezvous with Carla. Look.
sent today... "Hey. Sorry I missed you yesterday.
are you still here? I'm ready to run.
they're meeting at 3: 00 PM today at Felicia's Coffee.
way to go, Neal.
I ask you for an epiphyseal plate evaluation, and you do a full set of body x-rays?
take a guess why.
Dr. Hunt starting to rub off on you?
no.
well, yes, actually.
take a look.
Todd, what happens if Manny is ruled a minor?
typically, six months in juvie.
but I'll be pushing for his - immediate release on probation. - And then back home?
Yeah, that's the idea. Why?
well, you can see from these growth plates, his leg bones haven't even begun to fuse like an adult's.
he's definitely a minor.
but he can't go back home.
I saw cigarette burns on his abdomen and upper legs.
the X-rays show recently healed broken ribs and a fractured humerus.
and it's all happened within the last two years, since he's been living with his uncle.
it's consistent with physical abuse.
we're not sending the kid back to his abuser.
wait. Hold on a second. Are you saying you won't testify?
you want him to go to jail?
of course not.
what we're saying is, figure something out.
any sign of Carla?
put that away.
you can never trust a woman's online profile.
Really?
how would you know?
is there sugar in here? - Nah.
I asked for sugar. - You're lucky you got coffee.
you mind?
may I help you?
can I just get a coffee, light and sweet?
Yeah, sure. Yeah.
what are you guys doing here?
I think you know, Mike.
so you got in a fight with your father the night before he died.
he wanted to take your computer away.
that doesn't mean I killed him.
this will, Mike.
Plus, we know you planned to run away with Carla.
and how do you explain this?
well, what am I sticking around for?
my mom's got a new baby.
my dad's dead.
nobody cares about me.
it's a shame.
ed Russell works his whole life to provide for his family.
this is his reward?
I'll never have kids.
I'll let you know when I confirm the DNA.
heard you caught the killer.
a 15-year-old stabs his father to death because he threatens to take away his computer?
and it eludes you, doesn't it?
Yeah. - Then figure out why.
I thought we didn't care about the why.
Dr. Hunt, Ethan is calling for you in the lab.
so that was quite something you did today... full body X-rays and an independent radiology report?
that's at least $1, 000 off the books.
he's a lawyer. I figured we'd stick him for it.
what's this?
don't tell anybody I gave it to you.
you'll ruin my rep.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah. So I ran Mike's DNA against the flakes we found on Ed.
it's a match, but it's only a partial one, so... so either the test failed, or the flakes are from Ed somehow, except... except Ed didn't have ichthyosis.
so how did his son get it if it's hereditary?
find Peter. Tell him what you did told me.
wait. What did I just tell you?
that Ed wasn't Mike's father. - Of course.
What'd you dig up on Jen Russell?
her real name is Jennifer Burke.
we ran her name wide and tracked her back to Arizona, where 15 years ago, she filed domestic abuse charges - against one Tim Scanlan. - Looks like she took off with baby Mike and changed her name when she married Ed.
detectives.
we've got Scanlan.
son of a...
he was in the coffee shop.
sitting right behind you, which makes him Carla.
I tracked back the IP address of their first communication about a year ago.
it goes to this halfway house in Flagstaff.
that's where Scanlan had just gotten out of prison on an attempted murder charge.
he's been on every major networking site ever since, posing as Carla, looking for a 15-year-old boy, - same description as Mike. - Where's Mike now?
he's still in custody. - What about Jen?
go away.
I... I tried calling. I... I need to talk to you.
ed wasn't mike's biological father, was he?
please leave me alone.
I think that his real father killed your husband.
W... wait. Do you hear what I'm saying?
Mike's innocent.
just tell me that I'm right, - and the police will release him. - You're wrong.
and I have nothing else to say to you.
W... Jen!
are you okay?
Mrs. Russell?
Philadelphia PD!
they're out back! Go! Go!
Ah! - Go!
Scanlan! - Over there in the woods.
he's over here!
Scanlan, show me your hands!
Scanlan, let her go.
Scanlan, show me your hands. Let her go.
it's over, Scanlan! - This bitch took my son away from me!
he'll never be your son.
I'm gonna break your neck.
come on. Show me your hands! Show me your hands, Scanlan.
cover me, Sam. - I got you.
you're under arrest for the murder of Ed Russell.
call an ambulance!
what happened with Tim was a lifetime ago.
it never occurred to me that he had found us.
and why target Ed?
he didn't.
he wanted Mike.
his plan was to lure Mike away from the house and then tell him he was his real father.
but Mike was a no-show, so Tim came here to the house.
ed was working when he arrived.
tim probably knew enough about your family to talk his way in.
good-looking kid.
I'm guessing that it was the photos that made him snap.
you came home, saw the footprints, and assumed they were Mike's.
how could you have ever known that they were his father's?
hang in there, kid.
your mom will be here soon.
what's this?
it's a children's home. One of my colleagues is on the board.
Manny will need a sponsor... a business professional who'll give him a part-time job.
you want me to hire him?
just put him to work a couple hours a week.
I don't know if my firm will go for this.
Aw, come on. It's great PR.
and it's not too bad for the soul either.
Yeah.
see you in court, Dr. Murphy.
you've been awfully quiet today.
I was mad at you for all those times before when... you didn't show up because of work.
but today... you did.
so was it the son who did it?
uh, no. It was somebody else.
did you catch him?
Yeah, with a lot of help.
my friends think you're cool, you know?
they do? Really?
it's kinda weird.
Yeah.
I know...
what it feels like to be forgotten.
and I'm sorry that I...
made you feel that way again.
you have every reason in the world to doubt me.
I just hope that...
you never doubt that I love you.
maybe you could do carpool again next Saturday?
I'd like that.
but no snacks.
does anybody know
how to hold my heart?
how to hold my heart?
cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon
I want to tell you so
before the sun goes dark
how to hold my heart 'cause I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you...
am I interrupting?
Lacey horseback riding.
I remember when a phone was just a phone.
you look well. - So do you.
and what's good here?
uh, blueberry scones. - Stains the teeth.
quiche. - Not a fan.
coffee?
would you put that thing down? This is supposed to be my quality time with my daughter.
I want to show you my favorite.
she looks just like you at that age.
I thought your father was out of his mind, letting you do that.
for god sakes, tell her to be careful.
you of all people should know how fast an accident can happen.
can I have my phone back, please?
a peter Dunlop just sent you a text message.
body on route 14. Chief wants u.
mom. - Spelled the letter "u," by the way.
just give me my damn phone, please.
I have to go. - Of course you do.
there's a dead body out there somewhere who's more important than I am.
as usual, you don't understand. - I understand, all right.
you care more about the dead than you do about the living because they can't talk back.
believe it or not, they have something to say.
you know that's Joe Salerno, right? He's one of ours.
he may be one of yours, but it's our scene until I say otherwise.
so say otherwise.
not until dr. Hunt gets here. - Yeah, that's right. Thanks.
we're joined at the hip now because of you.
why don't you go start a canvass? - Oh, really? Look for suspects?
why didn't I think of that?
Hey, you! Get back!
up that hill right now.
we have got spectators. Why all the attention?
victim's name is Joe Salerno--18-year vet of the force,
homicide detective for the past six.
whoever hit him didn't stop. The cops are out for blood on this one.
so was somebody else.
bruising in the joints, petechiae.
not much on the ground.
see something?
it's what I'm not seeing that interests me.
how long has he been here? - The call came just before daybreak.
his blood is not coagulating.
two hours. It should be molasses by now.
maybe the timeline's off.
something's off. Peter, get a sample, will you? - Sure.
I cannot stress enough the high-profile nature of this case.
Really? You sure you want me on this?
I know what you're good at.
an hour on the news, And the crazies are already calling in. Frank Rizzo did it.
traffic cam on the overpass is busted. Next one's a mile away.
too far to see anything, but at least we have some license plates coming and going.
let's start running 'em down. - Um, detectives?
we got the driver.
how did I know you'd be waiting?
cop killer. This is serious stuff. Can I help?
no. - Aw, come on. Throw me a bone.
taken from the scene. Label it "priority," run a
priority? Blood scraped off the Schuylkill expressway?
for all you know, this is half tire tread and motor oil.
maybe that's what I'm testing for.
you know how big this case is.
why test blood you know is contaminated with foreign matter?
why not take blood directly from the body?
I plan to do that, too. - Okay.
uh, the blood-- should i run it?
no. - Yes.
you may not have to. - Driver turned herself in.
24-year-old named Sara Gonzales, Was on her way home from the late shift at Harry's diner.
she heard it on the news.
claims she felt a bump. Thought she hit an animal.
an animal?
she didn't notice a grown man standing in the path of her car?
that's why we're here, to confirm her story.
well, the first thing I can tell you is, Sara Gonzales wasn't lying.
detective Salerno wasn't standing in the middle of the road when she hit him.
he was lying on his back.
are you telling me he was lying in the middle of the highway?
you okay?
we came out of the academy together.
rode the projects before Joey made detective.
does he have family? - Wife, Helen.
I set them up. They got an 8-year-old daughter.
what have you got, Ethan? - Not much.
just a wrinkled piece of paper with a green smudge.
the point of impact is here. You can see the gash
runs across the shin, not up the leg.
I assume that nobody knows what he was doing out there.
that's right.
well, he was run over by a car going at a considerable speed.
I can already tell you he's got massive internal bleeding,
but notice that there is not a lot of blood or bruising anywhere.
what are you trying to say?
he was already dead when the car hit him.
what are you doing here, Joey?
that's what we're gonna find out.
I met him working the Christmas murders back in '06.
I'm really sorry, Sam.
Yeah. Me, too.
so, you find anything on him that could help us?
wallet, pen, wedding ring, and that piece of paper with some green grainy material on it, but not enough to sample.
Mm. So what's your theory?
the tibia bones were driven into the bottom of the feet.
the heel bones were fractured bilaterally. The impact was vertical.
vertical?
Yeah, you see it with jumpers all the time.
Joe Salerno was no jumper.
you got that? - I wasn't saying he was.
he didn't jump, Sam.
my guess is he was thrown or pushed after he was already dead.
after? - So what did kill him?
I mean, his tox screen came back negative for drugs.
well, he's got intracranial bleeding, bleeding gums...
leukemia? Thrombocytopenia?
bleeding in the g. I. Tract...
hemophilia? Bleeding in his joints...
I'm running another blood test, aren't I? - Now, please.
our lieutenant said the mayor's called already.
he wants a swift resolute, as if we don't.
so what'd you find out?
when was the last time you saw detective Salerno?
I don't know. Uh, last summer maybe. Why?
he's been on desk duty for the last couple of months.
some drug dealer filed assault charges. He's under official review.
does that sound Joe? - No, no, not at all.
Joe wears you down. He doesn't beat it out of you.
let's go get this drug dealer.
Sam, maybe you should talk to Helen Salerno instead.
okay.
come with me. I think you should get to know joe before...
before you do what you do.
I'd like that.
and I'll go with you to interview the drug dealer.
that way, nobody else winds up on desk duty.
I got three pins in my elbow because of your dead detective.
is that why you killed him?
what do you think, I was driving the Schuylkill this morning,
hoping that Salerno would jump in front of my car?
that's not how he died.
somebody killed him and dumped him from the overpass.
well, it wasn't me.
so what happened between you and detective Salerno a couple of months ago?
I was on market one day, helping some old ladies cross the street and whatnot,
when, uh, a car pulls up. Detective roadkill
that's detective Salerno to you.
whatever. Comes chasing after me.
I don't have the info he wants, So he decides to crank my arm and bash me up against the wall.
yeah,'cause you're an angel, right?
look, detective Salerno can kiss my a
go easy, peter. Easy, peter!
what's with you cops? You all got a short fuse?
so what information did you have that Salerno thought you uld give him?
I don't know where he was last night.
that didn't worry you?
not these days. I figured he was on a case.
Helen, Joe wasn't on a case.
what do you mean by "these days"?
excuse me. I'll give you guys a moment.
all right, Helen, talk to me. What's going on?
I don't know.
Joe hasn't been himself for a while.
how do you mean?
in the last six months, He's been irritable, cranky.
I tried talk to him about it.
he just...
he'd just get sullen and removed.
we've barely spoke
we've barely spoken in the last month.
I started to think...
no way, Helen. Joe loved you and Becky.
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
we're gonna find out who did this to Joe.
I'm Megan.
I'm Becky.
Hi, Becky.
did you know my father?
no, I didn't, but I wish I did.
Wow. Those are beautiful.
did you make those all by yourself?
it's called origami.
my dad folded the paper. Colored them in...
until he stopped.
cause of work, I guess.
I'm making bracelet sow.
wanna help?
Dr. Hunt?
I gotta go.
Bye.
Helen Salerno thought joe was working a case.
I hope to god he wasn't having an affair. I wouldn't know how to break it to her.
he wasn't having an affair. He was freelancing an old case.
Lizzy Adler--student athlete, pen hill college.
murdered last year. Killer never found. Remember?
Yeah, sure. Star lacrosse player goes to team's end-of-year party, wanders off, and no one sees her again until she's found in a ditch in cobbs" creek park.
well, chuck foster was the prime suspect in the case.
he left the party at the same time she did.
you know, Helen said Joe had been acting moody and distant.
and then he assaults foster?
look, I didn't know Salerno, but that sounds like a lot of cops to me.
not joey.
everybody's got that one case they can't let go of.
anything new with our drug dealer?
Salerno suspected him of killing a girl named Lizzy Adler year ago, but he couldn't make it stick.
I'd like to see her autopsy report.
what's that? - I'm not exactly sure.
I found it in his heart.
is that some kind of stent?
Hey, you did that at the crime scene.
what? Is your paresthesia acting up again?
what is it with you? Every time I have a problem, you gotta point it out?
maybe because you never allow yourself to have a problem, Megan.
I had breakfast with my mother, okay?
my hands went numb, and I dropped my knife.
unfortunately, it didn't land in her jugular.
it's a complicated relationship.
it looks like it's an undigested capsule--At least half of one.
how did it end up in his heart?
the horizontal impact of the car pushed his ribs into his stomach and into his heart,
and this got caught along the way.
Zorpac. Is that a drug?
it's a brand name for a generic refillable.
so whatever he swallowed, it wasn't over-the-counter. It was homemade.
okay.
there you go. - Thanks a lot.
all right. I'll see you soon.
got any of these?
What--ow! Easy! Three pins, man! Oh, god!
want to go for four?
look, I'll tell you what I told Salerno a hundred times.
I was at the party. Lizzy was hitting on me.
okay, I was hitting on her. But then her coach stormed in, and that was it.
party's over. I never saw her again after that.
Really? You didn't follow her, take her to the park, Choke her, dump her in the mud?
Joe was getting warm, so you made up the assault charges just to keep him away.
did I make this up? A broken elbow? Three pins?
and, no, I don't want a fourth.
we found a whole pharmacy in your apartment.
you've been doctoring pills, And Salerno died with one of 'em inside him.
so why don't you save us some time and tell us what was in it?
look, I-I don't know. He tossed my place more than once.
maybe he copped some pills.
you seriously expect me to believe that Joe Salerno was stealing drugs from a maggot like you?
well, you asked for the truth, and I gave it to you.
and you, you're scaring me.
well, then we'll take you to the best place that's safe from cops--holding.
all right, let's bring it in.
I know you're not walking.
I'm detective Morris. This is my partner, detective baker.
Hi. Hal Davis.
I heard about detective Salerno this morning. Red somebody would be by.
why is that?
Lizzy Adler--it's been a year since she died, and he was still trying to figure out what happened.
you talked to him recently?
we-we've all spoken to him at one time or another.
he was here practically every morning for the last month.
What'd you tell him?
well, he was interested in the night of the party--Uh, who was there, what happened.
and that creep chuck foster.
that creeps says you ran him off.
well, it was an unauthorized party. I closed it down as soon as I found out about it.
anything else?
you want to say something, miss, uh... - Heather.
Heather clayton. - Heather, not your theory again.
Oh, you have a theory. Great.
I told detective Salerno.
Lizzy was a talker, especially about boys, but when she died, Uh, she was dating someone she wouldn't tell us about.
I'm not sure I follow you.
well, Penn hill has strict fraternization rules.
a professor gets caught dating a student--Well, it's a heap of trouble.
coaches, too, I assume.
was it the hair loss or the gut that made you ask?
what are you looking at me for?
have you been in the records room recently? It's a nightmare.
what are you looking for?
Lizzy Adler's file. I've been in there for 30 minutes, And I can't even locate the A's.
it's by medical examiner, then year, Then last name of decedent.
Lizzy Adler's autopsy was handled by Harold Robeson, who, as you know, is no longer with us.
this is about to turn into more work for me, isn't it?
Oh. Hey, detective.
you got the results from that second bloodiest?
uh, yeah.
then why don't I know about it?
well, I just--I just texted dr. Hunt my findings.
did you text it to me?
I'm--I'm not really supposed to do that.
I-I wish I could help, but...
just tell me what killed my friend.
uh, well, the first test was, um, A standard tox screen. Turned up nothing.
the second, because of all the internal bleeding, Was a specific test for anticoagulant factors.
turned up warfarin, delivered in this.
you know, it's a funny thing about warfarin--It was originally marketed as a rat poison until it was found to be effective at preventing thrombosis and embolisms in humans.
so you think this is funny?
no, no. Not funny ha ha, funny interesting.
look, he died from warfarin poisoning.
but there's no way a-a single capsule that size could do it.
I mean, he was dosed over several days, Which pretty much nails this as murder.
doesn't it?
so you think the same person who killed joekilled Lizzy Adler?
it's a theory. Whoever killed Lizzy wouldn't hesitate to kill the guy who was close to nailing him.
well, I finally found the original autopsy photos.
let's light 'em up.
Uh,"mud in nasal cavity consistent with suffocation in ditch. No evidence of any
wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
that's wrong. - What's wrong?
look at this.
tan lines.
apparently, what Harold Robeson thought, too, but look again.
contact pallor?
she came to rest on something hard--Presumably a floor, but certainly not mud.
but it's pink from blood refilling the area.
which tells us... - She was moved...
after she was dead, but before livor mortis set in.
so now what?
is there anything in that report about a mark on her neck?
no. - Okay, then. We have our reason.
reason to do what?
Oh, no. Don't even say it.
Curtis... We're exhuming her.
you want me to notify Lizzy Adler's family?
you are so much more persuasive than I am.
does the chief know about this? - What do you think?
Dr. Hunt? Uh, detective baker was here yesterday, asking -
did you tell her about the warfarin?
well, I know you prefer to keep results in-house unless you decide otherwise...
I do. - But I kinda sort of
but in his case, Salerno's her friend. You ever lost a friend?
keep her in the loop.
here. - What's this?
it's a number for Lizzy Adler's family.
I need you to call them about an exhumation.
me? - Yeah, you.
we never release autopsy results until our investigation is complete,
and certainly not in the case of a dedicated member of the Philadelphia police department.
our office will continue to work with the police for a swift resolution in this case.
Oh, deftly done. Face time on TV and a plug for the police.
glad you appreciate it. Where are we on our investigation?
Lizzy Adler wasn't killed in cobbs" creek park.
I meant where are we on finding joe Salerno's killer.
you may have noticed, he's the one on the news, Not Lizzy Adler.
her body was moved. Our only chance of finding out from where is to exhume her.
if we find her killer, I bet that we find Salerno's.
after a year in the ground with decomp and contamination?
we finally have a cause of death on Salerno. Just run with that.
that's what I'm trying to do.
get the body we have off the table before you put another one on, okay?
well, that's that.
that's not that, is it?
is it ever?
two mornings in a row. Must be some kind of record.
good morning, mother.
Victor, did you know that this is my daughter?
uh, good morning, your honor.
he's terrified of me.
you seem to be the only person who isn't.
if y're coming to me, something's wrong. You despise owing me a favor.
Lizzy Adler was just 19 when she was killed.
and now the man dedicated to solving her murder is also dead.
I would like justice for them and their families.
I know you can understand that.
and you notified the family?
happening as we speak.
uh, uh, she, uh, meets the burden, your honor.
she better.
you realize Elizabeth adleris buried in orchard brook cemetery?
thank you, mother.
sometime last year, Lizzy clammed up about her love life.
so Sam's on campus now, looking for any old professors that might want to keep an affair quiet.
in other words, you drew the short end.
Oh, no. I wanted to look at a girl who's been dead for a year.
didn't know you were such a wuss, bud.
what is that?
a ball? - A very old one.
the cover and the stitching are both animal.
see that hair sticking out there? That's animal, too.
what's it doing in the coffin?
well, you have this more than in hand, So I'll be on my way.
go with the coffin, will you? Make sure they're careful.
I don't want them compromising that fungal layer. - You got it.
okay, let's take her to the hearse. And you heard dr. Hunt-- gently.
any error could affect the case.
my dad.
how old were you?
Lacey's age.
how'd it happen?
suicide.
are you sure, professor?
no, I have never seen nor heard of Joe Salerno in my life.
have you heard of, uh, Sarah Kaiser or Anne Tanaka?
according to your dean, they both accused you of coming on to them.
girls get crushes.
some of them get vengeful when they don't like their grades.
you recognize this?
we did a little research.
it's a 19th century lacrosse ball made of hair and deerskin.
used by the, uh, Iroquois, apparently.
and whato Sarah Kaiser, Anne tanaka, And Lizzy Adler have in common?
it's your native American history classin which that lacrosse ball was a well-known visual aid.
you dug Lizzy up?
you know, "Tosca," Puccini's opera?
Tosca murders scarpia and then lays a crucifix on his body to appease her guilt.
wait a second. Wait a second. That's what this is about? You think that I killed Lizzy?
you two were sleeping together, weren't you?
we shared an admiration for lacrosse. That's all.
at her viewing, I slipped it into her casketas a memento of our friendship.
Oh, come on, professor.
she was having a relationship she was trying to hide,
and, you, the mention of her name, Can barely keep it together.
you two were having this thing, she wanted out, and you couldn't deal with it.
she didn't want out.
she was planning on taking me to dinner the night after she died.
is that so? - Yes, detective. I was out of town.
she wanted to welcome me home.
robson's report says Lizzy was suffocated in the park because of mud found in her nasal cavity, inhaled at the time of death.
but we now know the mud got in there when she was moved.
if we're lucky, we'll find, somewhere behind the mud,
what she actually inhaled when she took her last breath.
how'd he miss this?
he didn't. At the time of Lizzy's death,
any particulate matter in her nasal cavity would have been loose and uncollectible.
but over time, her body desiccated, And the foreign matter hardened into that plug.
stop what you're doing, immediately.
you just broke the law.
you are the deputy chief.
you're supposed to be the hammer when it comes to procedure and budget.
have you forgotten who you work for?
you. I know.
not me. The taxpayers.
and they're not paying you to flout regulations.
we have a perfectly valid court order.
forgetting for the moment that you disobeyed me - Which quite frankly, I'm coming to expect -
did you even bother to inform the family about the exhumation?
Ethan did. Didn't you?
I've been trying.
what? We broke procedure?
the Adlers moved to Miami. Their number's unlisted.
th-that philly number that Pete gave me, it's just a service.
which you would've known if you'd called it yourself or even waited long enough for Ethan to get back to you.
so now I get to explain to the family that we violated their right to be informed, for et and I really hope, you. So for your sake, explain that they don't want to file a formal complaint.
tell them we're trying to find their daughter's killer.
that'll be all, dr. Hunt.
sorry.
Ah, better that the chief tells them anyway.
but I'm gonna let you make it up to me.
find out what that is.
you called me? - Uh, yeah.
I, um...
I-I-I didn't have many friends as a kid. I had a couple.
well, none. None, really.
um, but I had a-a guinea pig named Kenny.
and, uh, one day, I left the door open at my parents' house, and the neighbor's cat--Wait.
hold on. Are you comparing Joe Salerno to a guinea pig?
Yes.
you see... It was the first time I ever experienced the death of someone I loved.
I mean, I cried for weeks.
but the worst part was, No one understood why.
Dr. Hunt wanted me to keep you in the loop.
all right, so what am I looking at?
the bottom layer is mud taken from cobbs" creek park, where she was found.
the top layer is crushed shale and brick.
from where Lizzy was killed.
Yeah. Now shale and brick are the most common constituents of clay -
the same stuff we found on that pie of papering detective Salerno's pocket.
Joe found the crime scene.
somewhere where you inhale green clay.
Penn hill's tennis courts.
Hey, detective? - Yeah?
I'm really sorry about your friend.
the party was in the field house over there.
and Lizzy's dorm was over there. Tennis courts are right in the middle.
it's the perfect place for someone to jump her. Chuck foster or the professor?
it wasn't the professor. He was presenting a paper in Boston.
the coach says that Salerno was here almost every morning.
was he that obsessive about every case?
no. But you never know which cases are gonna hit you the hardest.
he had a daughter himself.
Yeah, but if I had a daughter and I was on this case,
I'd want to be tucking her in every night.
what are you thinking?
I'm just wondering why a loving father and husband becomes ody and withdrawn, stops talking to his wife, and stops making origami for his daughter.
he was frustrated.
Yeah, I'm frustrated, too, But I'd be folding that par every day if I could.
I gotta get to the lab.
I loaded joe's neuropathology results.
you are looking for mething in particular?
run a D. N.A. Test for c. A.G. Trinucleotide repeats in chromosome four.
you know this has nothing to do with the case.
this man has a wife and daughter who think he abandoned them.
if it was your father, wouldn't you want to know different?
what are you doing?
I spoke with the Adlers. They gave their blessing.
you didn't think to tell me that?
how's that feel?
you know, I remember this case. I...
I remember her parents.
they were so distraught, they couldn't even look at the body. They had to ask a friend.
we're more alike than you think, Megan. I just follow the rules.
so you with me on this or not?
test body presents with a consistent fungal layer due to interment over the course of a year,
minimal decomposition, and...
conspicuous absence of fungus on the nape of the neck.
antifungal agent?
I can't make out the shape.
hold on.
is that what I think it is?
the hand of her killer.
our lieutenant said you had something for us to see.
a hand?
how is that possible?
Lizzy was pushed down and suffocated from behind.
whoever killed her was wearing antifungal agent.
the previous m. E. Had no reason to look for it,
but after a year, it has given us a hand impression surrounded by the fungus on the body.
an antifungal agent? Like, for athlete's foot?
wait a minute. There's more.
look at the impression.
what don't you see?
a finger's missing.
and at the end of that missing fingers a small little perpendicular scratch.
a finger splint.
and then look at this.
these pictures scroll backwards through time.
fall season...Spring...
and then the end of the regular season, Right before the national play-offs.
and if we zoom in...
I'll be damned.
all right, let's bring it in.
detectives.
something else we can help you with?
we need to talk to heather clayton.
okay. Uh, all right, the rest of you, running drills.
come on. Let's go.
yeah?
how'd you break your finger last season, heather?
uh, in practice. A girl ran into me.
it was an accident. It happens.
did you also split your fingernail?
wait. Hold on a minute. Excuse me. What's with all these questions?
hit him, peter.
I'm sorry. What? - Hit him.
lady, I don't know who you are, but
do I have to do everything myself?
Hey! Dr. Hunt, what the hell are you doing?
my job. Heather, after the party, you followed Lizzy back to her dorm, didn't you?
you were mad at her. You were angry that she broke your finger and blew your chances at the tournament.
you were also wearing a
it was on both of your hands, and it rubbed off on Lizzy's neck when you held r facedown.
what you didn't realize is, you were constricting blood to her brain at the same time you were compressing her chest.
and when you finally let go, it was too late.
whose idea was it to cover it up?
don't say a word, heather.
she couldn't move the body by herself. It was you, coach, wasn't it?
Yeah, you know, you're just making this all up.
do you have a rodent problem?
what?
hantavirus is carried by rodents.
rodents are killed by warfarin, otherwise known as rat poison.
have you been putting rat poison around your field?
you know what? Th doesn't prove anything.
Heather, I believe that what you did to Lizzy was a mistake.
but he convinced you to lie about it, didn't he?
and then he moved Lizzy's body and killed detective Salerno when Salerno started getting too close to the truth.
how long are you gonna keep covering up for him?
not a word, heather.
I wanted to report it, but he told me not to!
you idiot! Can't you see that she's bluffing?
Oh, on the contrary, coach.
you know, you look a lot paler than you do in your team photos,
and you're kinda losing your hair.
so?
so you probably thought that was due to stress, Stress from getting caught.
but stress didn't cause that.
your capillaries are rupturing, coach.
blood is pooling in your muscles and your joints--All from warfarin poisoning.
those capsules that you made to kill joe Salerno?
you exposed yourself lethally.
you are now dying the same death that joe did.
I-I-I still say you' bluffing.
Oh, really? Try telling me that when you go into hypovolemic shock and the pain is so intense, you can't even speak, let alone scream.
we have 72 hours to hold you until we figure out the charges.
that should be long enough for the poison to do its job, eh?
Oh, yeah, I'd say more than enough.
hands behind your head, coach.
Heather clayton, you are under arrest for the murder of Lizzy Adler.
you have the right to remain silent.
no, you--you have to help me.
you saw detective Salernostanding by the court day after day.
you knew he was closing in on heather and that she'd crack under the pressure.
Yes.
but I know Joe, and there's no way joe would ever do drugs.
they weren't drugs. I brought him some... Energy supplements.
he didn't know they were poison.
you killed a good detective, a better husband, And the father of a little girl.
do you really think I'm gonna help you?
I've been poisoned! The M. E. said so.
try this.
cranberry juice? - Vitamin k.
it was either that or spinach.
wait a second! That's it?
I confessed for a bottle of cranberry juice?
it leaves a bad taste, doesn't it?
Hi.
heard you caught the killer.
the news has been singing your praises.
now what particularly unpalatable favor shall I ask of you?
let's see. We could go shopping together, or we could try breakfast again,
or...I know.
one hour, no cell phone-- Sunday brunch at the club.
I will...
if you...
sign that.
this is an exhumation request for your father.
still looking for answers after all these years.
he killed himself, Megan. He took the easy way out, and he left me with his mess to clean up.
without a note and without a reason why.
which you think you're gonna find by digging him up?
maybe it--it was...
medical?
maybe he was trying to spare us? Cancer?
a degenerative disease?
we will not know until we...
look.
no.
why not?
because you are the only one that wants to look.
not everything is a mystery, Megan. Your father left us.
get over it.
I did.
Thanks, mom.
I got the C. A .G. Test results back.
Thanks, Curtis.
you're welcome.
good-bye, detective.
thank you for... Catching my husband's killer.
Helen, dr. Hunt has something to tell you.
Joe was sick, Mrs. Salerno. He had Huntington's disease.
it's a degenerative brain disorder that probably went undiagnosed for at least a year.
I don't understand. Why didn't I see it?
you did. It was everywhere
his... Emotional distance, His obsessiveness.
i-it even affected his manual dexterity.
that's why he stopped making origami for your daughter.
all of his behavioral changes were symptoms of Huntington's,
and there's no way you could've known that.
this is Lizzy Adler.
Joe's obsession solved her murder.
he's a hero, Helen.
you've got a lot to be proud of...
Hi, Becky.
I have something for you.
what's that?
something your dad made for you,
something he carried in his pocket every day.
I knew he didn't forget.
he never forgot.
what do you think?
Oh, amazing. That is so cute.
Oh, absolutely fierce.
can I borrow it?
that looks really expensive.
Oh, my God. - Um, Lace, is that your mom?
nice hat.
can I see it?
gotta go, Lace. Kisses. - See ya.
whoa. Cashmere.
this must have cost a fortune.
it was on sale.
you bought this?
well, you gave me a credit card.
for emergencies only.
this was a total fashion emergency.
and what made you think this would be okay?
you spend like this all the time.
have you seen your shoes?
Hey, I bought these shoes with the money I earned.
when you start making your own money, you can buy whatever you want.
but until then, you do not spend money without asking my permission.
okay. My bad.
mistakes were made. I'll pay for it.
how?
you're looking chipper this morning.
well, I'm just high on life I guess.
missed a button there, lovely boy.
Oh. How are you doing?
I had to return a hat that Lacey bought in Society Hill for $300 using my credit card.
Oh, 13... the age of independence and the death of reason.
at least that's what my sisters went through.
Oh, fantastic shoes.
Where'd you get 'em?
so this is where the free-for-all took place, huh?
Yep, courtesy of apartment 4-0-7.
you missed out. They picked the street clean.
no one saw the murder, though.
how much cash was tossed?
ballpark according to witnesses? Over $50, 000.
you'd never guess by this guy's apartment, though.
the tenant of this humble abode.
lived alone, kept to himself.
neighbors have no idea where the money came from.
that's it? That's all you got?
we have no wallet, no phone, and no murder weapon.
there is a gaping hole in his torso.
doctor, I believe that is your department.
no sign of forced entry.
he knew his assailant.
dented drywall and a broken glass.
looks like there was a struggle.
these lacerations look defensive.
slit-like wound, probably from a knife.
as C. S.U. found no knife, we're gonna need a detailed description.
simple guy.
nothing I'm seeing signs "50 grand out the window.
the money was real.
four years college tuition into thin air.
what cave have you been living in?
four years? Try two.
you're kidding me?
Yeah, and that's if your kid stays in state.
Oh, man.
you know, maybe the killer threw the cash out the window as a diversion and then escaped through the mayhem.
so Walt steals the money, killer comes to collect, Walt pays the price.
Mm. There's a whole lot of bruising here.
I don't think this was just about the money.
this was personal.
ready? Go.
Kimberly Gleason, female, 22 years of age.
attending surgeon, next of kin?
no, no, no, skip that part.
pathology records only care about the case.
circumstances?
three days ago, Kimberly presented to E. R.with a ruptured appendix.
12 hours after a routine appendectomy, she suffered pneumonia and tachycardia.
it's a fast heart rate.
last night, she crashed.
cardioversion was unsuccessful.
she was pronounced dead at 11: 35 P. M.
she was beautiful and young.
it's so sad.
Oh, a healthy college kid dies after a simple operation?
that's not just sad.
that's hinky.
so... how did I do?
Oh, my God. Verbatim.
yeah? You're so ready to be drilled.
Yeah.
Oh, good luck. Gotta run.
Thanks.
Dr. Ethan Gross, ready to be drilled.
Yeah, first things first. The Gleason family's coming in.
I want you to talk to them.
Yes. Uh, no problem.
all right, attending surgeon, next of kin?
what?
this bruise came from the hilt, so the blade went all the way in.
it's distinct, so it shouldn't take long to narrow down the weapon.
you're being unusually helpful.
and you're being unusually quiet.
Oh, Lacey rocked Megan's credit card.
Oh, macadangdang.
thanks for sharing, Peter.
on your way out, Curtis...
trace from the arm laceration and the bruise. - Mm-hmm.
Walter Brown is a common name, so employment and next of kin is still unknown.
he has no prints on file and no criminal history.
so this guy's like a blank slate.
deep calluses...
burn scars.
Walt knew an honest day's work, unlike certain prodigal offspring.
he's got a manicure, a full body tan, and porcelain crowns.
those things are like $2, 000 each.
corneal scar.
he's had Lasik surgery.
and that...
looks like a jellyfish sting.
portuguese man-of-war probably from the Caribbean?
tanning salons, expensive electrosurgery, and travel to the tropics.
who is this guy?
well, in northern liberties, with at least 50 grand in cash, the natives would call him a criminal.
that looks like a coal tattoo.
it's when coal dust...
gets trapped in an open cut.
there's no active mines around.
but I think there may be a coal-fired power plant on the river.
I'll make some phone calls.
Oh, my God.
this is what I call a locker room.
it's a hot tub.
Yeah, that's right.
can we help you?
Yeah, um, Bud Morris, Philly P. D.
what's going on?
do any of you recognize this man?
Walt Brown. He's my cousin.
he's a great guy.
worked with us for 20 years.
he have any enemies you know of?
no, you must be looking for a different Walt.
Walt bought everything you see here.
wait. Wait a minute. Walt paid for all this?
sure. - Yeah.
why do you think we retired his locker?
how exactly did Walt pay for all this?
you mean, you don't know?
Walt won $50 million in the lottery.
your cousin Walt away from work a multimillionaire, and no resentments?
Walt took care of everyone.
he treated his entire shift to a week in Bermuda.
every week, I played the lotto.
about eight months ago, I miss one day.
that same day, Walt, on a total luck, fills out the big ticket.
so, yeah, I resented him.
that doesn't mean I wanted him dead.
do you know what he was doing at his old apartment?
Walt loved that place.
we used to have parties there... beer and poker.
later he used it as a refuge.
he could have had enemies.
well, after he'd won, he had about 50 cousins show up he'd never met.
every one of 'em had his hand out.
Walt lived a pretty fast life after he won.
he'd hold huge dinner parties for his charities...
nursing home, food banks.
Walt loved making other people happy.
of course, some took advantage.
did you keep up with him?
I tried. It wasn't easy.
at the end of the day, Walt was a multimillionaire.
the rest of us had to go back to work.
start by alphabetizing these.
no texting, no wandering the halls.
but... mom, paper kills trees.
you should at least go digital.
Oh, that's a great idea.
scan them first and then file them.
this isn't fair. The punishment doesn't fit the crime.
at 9 bucks an hour, it'll fit eventually.
see you at 5: 00.
there are child labor laws.
federal Code, title 29...
don't even think about quoting grandma.
I looked it up myself.
we're not farmers, and I'm not an actor.
there are radioactive substances in this building somewhere...
Hey, I do not like this any more than you do.
the sooner you get started, the sooner you finish.
Hi. Uh, I'm...
what happened to Kimberly?
um, well...
we... we don't know yet...
isn't that why she was brought here?
will, please.
they told us she'd get better.
they told us she had pneumonia.
and now my little girl is dead, and you're telling me you don't know why?
to... to determine cause of death is a process...
I don't give a damn about the process.
can't you give us a straight answer?
Ethan, you're needed in the lab.
Mr. Gleason...
Mrs. Gleason, Maya.
I'm Dr. Kate Murphy. I'm the chief medical examiner.
we understand your frustration...
Hey, you.
afternoon, Alvarez.
we're looking for a razor-sharp, single-edge knife, probably cutlery, and all the blood from the fallen cash that we managed to recover matches Walt's.
so Walt threw out his own money?
the rich aren't like you and me, Megan. Well, me.
you know, they throw cash around like it's confetti.
they spend $300 on a hat.
that's why Lacey's here, right?
Hey, I'm new at this teenage discipline stuff.
you got any pearls of wisdom?
not a one.
what do you got?
well, Walt was an enigma.
he seemed to be enjoying himself.
those abrasions on his back are fingernail marks.
and somebody was enjoying Walt.
or pretending to.
and his fatty liver indicates a lot of drinking.
Amen to that.
stomach contents show a whole lot of red wine, plus aged Stilton cheese, caviar, beef carpaccio, and apple baklava, well within an hour of his death.
huh. You're Mr. Foodie. Any idea where he ate all that?
Oh, No. Way above my price range.
maybe Lacey knows.
so an instant multimillionaire is enjoying life to the hilt.
what's the riddle, huh?
Walt's big heart.
well, maybe he was generous.
as in 500 grams big.
whoa. That is a big heart.
way above average.
so nodular kidneys and hemorrhagic lesions on his adrenals indicate high blood pressure.
grinding his teeth and gastric ulcers point to high anxiety.
if Walt was having such a good time, what was he so stressed about?
how's the father-to-be holding up?
I am armed, you know?
well, the fellas and I have some surprises for you. Bell.
first the address of a Gladwyne Mansion under Walt's name.
he used to rent it out for charity events.
the D. N.A. from Walt's cut... a cow from Japan.
kobe beef.
identical to the meat found in his stomach.
so whoever cut Walt prepared his last meal.
Mm-hmm. And Walt was big into cooking, celebrity chef lessons to be exact.
there's one scheduled at the mansion today.
I'll head out there right now.
one more thing.
what's this?
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.
dare to dream. You never know. Look at Walt.
you mean the dead guy?
the one with the knife in his torso?
this is what I'm reduced to?
it... it's just a pipe dream. It's an addiction.
what's going on, Bud?
when my kid is 18,
I'm gonna be 66 years old.
and the pension that I have won't even cover a cap and gown.
you have 18 amazing years of parenting to worry about first.
you're gonna be okay.
uh, lungs are a lot worse off than radiology indicated.
uh, there's... there's multilobar, infiltrates, and, uh, alveolar hemorrhaging and...
I'm sorry.
I panicked, and people and... and their emotion...
Ethan, what happened is okay.
it's my fault for putting you in that situation.
you weren't ready.
got it.
necrotizing pneumonia?
how did that get missed in intensive care?
it's weird, right?
Yeah. I'll pay a visit to the hospital first thing tomorrow morning.
be ready at 7: 30 sharp.
are you here for the Leon Gould experience?
the cooking lesson?
Justine. Walt's event planner.
Oh, Peter, a friend of Walt's.
Oh. Have you seen him?
I have been looking all over for him.
not for a little while.
he throws quite a party, though.
well, when Walt gets into something, he gets into it.
next week he wants an 18th-century masquerade and then a Hawaiian luau with suckling pig.
he sounds a little manic.
you have no idea.
and what is today's theme?
a taste of Italy... comfort food and knife skills.
right this way.
well, welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
today's lesson is all about northern Italian cuisine.
and in northern Italian cuisine, there is lots of fresh vegetables that need to be sliced and diced.
now I'm gonna need a couple of volunteers to help me.
young lady, young man, come up here.
so we're actually gonna make a pan-seared snapper, with a potato and apple hash and some fresh zucchini...
very light, very simple.
sir, uh, your station's over here.
actually, uh, my station is downtown.
what's going on?
we're investigating the murder of Walter Brown.
murder? - Mm. He was killed with a single-edged Japanese chef's knife, kinda sorta...
Yeah.
exactly like this one.
it's easy to clean these knives.
it's a little harder to sterilize them.
in the hilt of this particular knife, we found traces of kobe beef.
it's actually wagyu beef.
you see, the cattle...
it's the same beef Walt ate an hour before he died...
your dish, Leon.
it's the same beef found in this cut in his arm, from your blade, Leon.
I do this knife flip.
Walt tried it. He cut himself.
so I give him a knife to take home and practice with.
how funny we didn't find one at his home.
witnesses say you left yesterday's party early.
Yes, I did, to look for Walt.
he said somebody was trying to crash the party and he was gonna go outside and deal with it.
do you have any idea who was outside?
no.
but I was worried.
Walt was in a bad temper, and it wasn't like him.
morning.
I saw Lacey heading out to scan some files.
she looks like a trooper.
she hates me.
enlightenment takes a while.
define "a while."
my sisters ran roughshod over my mom for decades.
Oh, that's so comforting.
cause of death is lacerated aorta.
Walt bled out in minutes.
letters and invoices from the last month alone...
Walt's staff overcharged him, distant relatives asked for handouts.
you know, any one of them could've been the party crasher.
leon said that Walt left the party angry.
his body said that he was anxious.
Justine said he was manic.
I mean, do you think his death is related to his behavior?
here as always to answer such timely questions is Dr. Curtis Brumfield.
trace came back off the chest bruises.
magnesium oxide.
that sounds like the power plant.
Colin certainly had motive.
Yeah, maybe, but magnesium oxide is a byproduct of tungsten welding.
impressed?
I got a list of toxins from the supervisor.
I believe that Dave had a welding visor on.
I'll get his address.
uh, this was waiting for you at reception.
are you okay?
my sister died.
dad's furious at everyone.
he wants answers.
the doctors don't care.
they don't listen.
I promise you, they do.
my mom's one of them.
I had a necklace with a picture of her.
we can't find it.
I thought it might be here.
so you checked Kimberly's hep-locks yourself?
my nurses do the hep-locks.
look, I know you mean well, but these are not really the most important questions for you to ask.
...see the charts.
are... are you questioning my judgment?
no, just your, uh, experience.
when was sepsis first discovered?
my head nurse reported it...
I'm not asking the head nurse.
12 hours post-op.
appendectomy complication rate?
less than 6% at her age.
so a complication was possible?
unlikely.
look, here's what I know...
her appendix ruptured, she went septic, we gave broad-spectrum antibiotics, and they failed.
Kimberly Gleason was given impeccable care.
okay, well, here's what I know...
your dead patient is now our case, and I need you to... - Doctor.
yeah?
may I have a moment? Excuse us, please.
can you fill this out at the lab?
it's for Kimberly's cultures.
wait. Am I done with... am I done with Faber?
it's a dialogue, Ethan, not an inquisition.
I'll take it from here.
excuse me. - Got a bit tense back there.
he's...
you gotta make sure you keep it out of the trees.
Mr. Stackhouse?
hello.
so what brings you down here?
we found magnesium oxide on Walt's bruises.
uh, hey, could you...
I believe that's a substance you're familiar with.
something you want to share with us, Dave?
Walt meant the world to us.
look!
he was an Uncle to my son.
that swing set was a gift from him.
everybody said he was generous with his winnings.
no, that came last year, before the money.
he could barely afford it.
after the money, everything changed.
he stopped visiting, returning phone calls.
when we did talk, he couldn't wait to get off the phone.
it was like he was giving up on us.
is that what the fight was about?
never missed Cal's birthday his whole life, until yesterday.
he broke my son's heart.
I was furious, so I drove over to his mansion only to find a bunch of strangers who would never look twice at Walt before the money.
he forgot about the people who cared about him.
it got heated.
then he drove off on his bike.
he had a motorcycle?
custom made.
the first thing he bought after he won.
there's no record of a bike like that.
I'm gonna put out an A. P.B.
I knew Walt better than anyone.
never thought money would change him.
I was wrong.
Hi.
good afternoon, Al... whoa!
you "Alvarez" me again, I will kick you bowlegged.
why are you being so weird?
Dani, we're at work.
it doesn't have to be this awkward.
Hey, I'm Dani.
nice to meet you.
maybe I'll see you at 6: 00?
here?
why are you looking at Walt's brain?
according to Dave, Walt's behavior became erratic after he won the lottery.
he became manic, paranoid, and impulsive.
is it possible that you don't want to admit that money can change someone completely?
Yes, I am worried that Lacey is changing.
but it is not a medical mystery.
it's called teenage rebellion.
what was his last meal again?
uh, red wine, stilton cheese, caviar, kobe...
tyramine. Yes.
they all contain tyramine.
it's not in his brain at all.
it's in his kidneys.
ha ha!
Yes, ye of little faith.
that is an enormous nucleus, which could mean only one thing.
Ah. A PHEO.
a what?
a pheochromocytoma.
Walt had a tumor on his adrenal gland, causing his system to flood with hormones and his blood pressure spiked, making his moods erratic.
Oh, so Walt became a teenager.
Yes, basically, and the tyramine in his diet did not help.
so when do you think it all started?
by the size of that tumor, I'd say over a year ago.
long before he bought the lottery ticket.
so Walt did not change because of the money.
he changed because he was sick.
and none of his friends recognized the difference.
turn it off and take off your helmet.
what's your hurry, sweetheart?
Walt gave me the bike. I swear.
unfortunately, Walt's not here to confirm that.
how long had you two been together?
do I need to measure your fingernails?
just over two months.
he was opening a nursing home in northern liberties.
I was writing a local piece.
we've been together ever since.
how touching and profitable for you.
look, I loved Walt.
he was kind, thoughtful.
he was also manic and anxious.
that was all the charity work.
Walt made it a full-time job.
or it was the endocrine tumor that had been affecting his behavior for months.
why did you run away from my siren?
I panicked.
I... I have been questioned about stealing from a client before, but it... it was a total misunderstanding.
like this one? Yes.
so am I in the clear?
hardly.
more?
you'll be saving a whole rain forest by the time you done.
no, no. She can't do this to me.
I have a life.
my friends are out of school this week, and they're talking about boys.
I... I'm missing out on my youth.
here you go.
go ahead. Open it.
you are cordially invited to the break room.
sorry. After you.
no.
why don't we share?
Oh, yeah. We could share it.
Yeah.
there you go.
enjoy.
thank you.
you should be using cloth napkins.
Yeah, you should.
I don't know how you guys do this every day.
I know we should say something wise, but sometimes, work is just work.
see?
sorry, Lacey.
look at that.
all it is paperwork.
no, it's not just paperwork.
it's being able to talk to somebody who needs your help.
see, this is what I suck at.
seriously. I was... I was talking to this family the other day, they just lost a daughter, and I'm s...
the Gleasons? That was you?
Yeah. Why?
I talked to their daughter Maya. She was really upset.
she feels like... like nobody cares.
of course I care.
look, they wanted an answer that I didn't have, that I still don't have.
you'll find a way to help.
I... I... I gotta go. G...
second body, same O. R?
Luisa Hernandez, 55.
hip surgery four days ago.
dead last night with cardiovascular collapse.
is this hinky, too?
uh, yeah, this is very hinky.
mottled skin, bloody sputum.
it looks like septicemia.
bacteria run amok in the blood stream.
it's nasty stuff.
Kimberly had it, too.
okay, this is not good.
I mean, what if the hospital missed something huge?
well, you'll have to go back.
Yeah, I... I don't think anybody's gonna let me talk to the living for a while.
so do what you do best. Talk to the dead.
come with me.
I have another assignment.
next time.
okay, it's just you and me, lady.
I got it.
I got it.
Hey, give that to me, please.
what's this... families reconnected?
Yeah, it's not important. Okay?
no, don't open it.
what's in it?
it's the name of my birth parents.
why don't you want to open it?
I'm gonna go check in on Megan.
Hey.
turns out the knife went all the way to the vertebra, leaving a 2-centimeter defect in the bone.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm listening.
uh, whoever killed Walt used a lot of force.
Yeah, but that's not all. Look at this.
see that tiny metal tip embedded in the bone?
so the knife got stuck in the spine.
could we get the tip?
Mm. We'd have to decalcify.
it would take days.
I think there's something else.
Megan, We... we've looked at the abdomen, like, a hundred times.
all right. All right. Let's look at the legs.
Oh, of course. Silly me. The legs.
look at that.
that's just the zipper from the body bag.
no, not the zipper.
look what's behind it.
get me a lateral image of that. Meet me in the morgue.
mom, it's almost 8: 00.
not done yet. Ten more minutes.
we found something else.
you already know what killed him.
Lacey, this man was very sick, and not even his closest friends knew it.
what happens when there are no answers?
what do you tell people then?
sometimes even the answers don't help.
ultimately, it's about giving comfort to the living...
any way we can.
how'd the knife fragment get in his thigh?
it was carried down the aorta and then lodged right here in the femoral artery, and.
the murder weapon.
even better... it's got trace on it.
Dr. Murphy, Kimberly had pneumonia and septicemia.
so did Luisa. - And check this out.
she also had red hepatization of the lungs.
it looks like a liver.
Luisa has it, too.
which means there's an infection in the O. R.
the whole hospital could be at risk.
two patients under your care died with identical symptoms.
somewhere, someone screwed up.
do you think we overlook hygiene?
well, I think you overlooked something.
let's go over the symptoms of both cases, last to first.
v-fib, before that...
tachy, pneumonia, fever... nosebleeds.
Ethan, now is not the time.
no, they were both nasally intubated in the field.
they both had nosebleeds.
my staff knows how to reintubate.
that's exactly what makes it weird.
they wouldn't have bled normally.
maybe... maybe the infection started in the nasal passages.
doctor, where are you taking us?
if the nasal passages were the first to be infected, we need to get to the E. R.
I was right?
coming through. Look out!
boating accident.
hypothermic.
hypotensive. O-2 down to 83.
okay, let's ventilate.
take the bag on the far right.
that's contaminated.
this filter needed to be changed.
the ventilation bags are hanging right by a wall light, giving bacteria a perfect place to thrive.
your nurses have been infecting patients as they come through the door.
doctor, I had no idea...
no.
I take full responsibility.
it's my patient. It's my watch.
that took guts.
I've been there.
have you?
two people are dead.
who knows how many lives you just saved?
in my field, the hardest thing is explaining to a family why you were wrong after it's too late to do anything about it.
all you can do is admit it and move on.
thank you.
it's my job.
you should be using a cloth napkin, you know?
save the environment.
has Lacey been talking to you instead of working?
Lacey's a smart girl with a good heart.
give her room, Megan.
she'll get there, just not on your timetable... ouch!
I'm trying to figure out how the knife thrust worked.
the killer held it with the knife edge up.
Ouch. Do I look like a Thanksgiving turkey to you?
but it was also a really hard upper thrust, hard enough to break the tip off of the knife on the vertebrae.
girl, you about to unleash the Kraken.
I just can't get over the force of the blow.
there is no way Justine could've done this.
not even a man.
here we go.
epichlorohydrin.
before it wound up in Walt, that knife had contact with epoxy glue.
I think we should ask Peter about...
where you go...
well, then give me one of these peppers.
Ooh, girl. That's good.
is that the exact glue you found on the knife fragment?
identical.
Dave didn't say where he was going.
I've seen this before, Mrs. Stackhouse.
you are stonewalling me.
look, I already told you everything I know.
Walt yelled at Cal a week ago.
Dave insisted he was sick.
Dave was right.
Dr. Hunt.
look, Dave loved Walt.
he'd never hurt him.
then I suggest you help us find him.
we've been short on cash.
Dave's at work. He took an extra shift.
thank you.
this is Philly P. D.
Dave Stackhouse, we have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Walter Brown.
what the hell is going on?
you have the right to remain silent.
put your hands behind your back. - Anything you say can and will... be used against you in a court of law.
Dave? You gotta be kidding me.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights...
you already admitted you were angry with him and you fought with him that night.
and now we have epoxy glue from your hands and on a fragment of the knife.
Walt wasn't himself.
look...
I called him out, and that must have shaken him up.
what happened afterwards?
Walt phoned, told me to meet him at his old place.
when I got there, he was in a rage.
he had a knife in his hand, and he was cutting open stacks of money, throwing 'em out the window.
he was saying, winning the money was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
so you decided to... liberate him of it.
no, he wasn't in his right mind.
I tried to stop him, but he had the knife, and...
and it was an accident.
doesn't sound like one.
you're under arrest for the murder of Walter Brown.
hold on. Hold on.
in case you hadn't noticed, we just got a confession.
Dave had an accomplice.
Really?
and who might that be?
push.
try to lift up your arm. Come on.
see?
he doesn't have the arm strength to inflict the kind of wound that Walt had.
he's faking it.
lift up your arm.
put your hand right there on his bicep.
feel anything?
other than you hitting his elbow? No.
those muscles should be twitching.
it's called severe bicep atrophy.
it's caused by a pinched nerve in the C-5 vertebra.
sorry.
which comes from hunching over a welding torch for years.
but you're right.
other than that, he's totally faking.
he could still stab a man. - No.
not with the force required to break off a knife on Walt's spine.
Walt was a big guy.
so you believe me?
I didn't think anyone would.
well, if it's any help, I still don't.
mm, and I'm with Bud on this one.
got a tough crowd here.
tell me exactly what happened.
Walt lunged at me.
we struggled over the knife.
I feel backwards, and he landed on top of me.
he impaled himself on the knife with the weight of his own body.
and then he went down, and there was... he was bleeding everywhere, and I tried to save him.
this was an accident. It wasn't a murder.
Where's the evidence?
lift up your shirt.
that bruise corresponds to the hilt of the knife that pressed into Dave's body when the two of them fell.
then why take the knife?
because my prints were on it.
I didn't think anyone would believe me.
I was just trying to get the knife away from him.
you were right to help Walt.
he was very sick.
and you're the only one who cared about him enough to know that something was very wrong.
acinetobacter calcoaceticus.
hard to say.
even harder to kill.
this was a bit tougher assignment than I'd hoped for you.
no.
listen, I don't want to put you through telling Kimberly's family.
that time will come.
Dr. Murphy.
it's my job.
Hi, mom.
your files, all scanned.
and your first week's pay, prorated.
$80?
it might not seem like a lot, but it will mean more to you because... you've earned it.
no, it's perfect. We have to go to the mall.
there's something I need to get.
families RECONNECTED
20 bucks.
I'll be damned.
I'm Sheila Temple, and welcome to the "Temple of Justice."
hillary Stone was released from prison today...
get back. Get back. after she was acquitted by judge Joan Hunt...
move! Move! of the brutal and senseless murder of her own 5-year-old son Simon.
and today, she's a free woman.
free to kill again.
you guys need to back up off the car! Stay tuned.
are you trying to create a circus atmosphere?
rain is still in the forecast.
and it will preserve the scene if the skies open up.
Where's your better half?
Sam's in Harrisburg at a wedding.
it's really too bad.
you know how much she loves the big top.
rain stopped at 2: 00 A. M.
jogger cutting through the site found the body at, uh...7：30
and how did you know that?
the sun has been up long enough to cake the dirt, but the work shift hadn't started yet.
that puts discovery at about an hour after sunrise.
got blood on the backhoe.
so the victim probably hit their head on it and then fell in the hole that it dug the day before.
all right. Let's dig him up.
we don't dig, detective.
we excavate.
Oh, God.
that's Hillary Stone.
I don't think anybody's gonna want to solve this murder.
may I remind you, she was acquitted?
that doesn't make her innocent.
people saw her on that bridge, they saw her drop the sack into the river.
come on. You know she did it.
all I know is, someone did this.
that's my only concern.
I'm Sheila Temple from "Temple of Justice."
in a shocking turn, Hillary Stone, who yesterday was a free woman, is now a dead woman.
we are here at the construction site where the body is now being uncovered.
and our chief medical examiner has just arrived on the scene.
Dr. Murphy, Dr. Murphy, - care to comment? - No.
not even about your choice of medical examiner?
Dr. Hunt is the best our office has.
isn't that the same thing that the mayor said about her mother...
judge Joan Hunt?
this is gonna be gold. This is gonna be gold.
Oh, and here come the news choppers.
choppers and an accused murderer under the big top...
still think this isn't a circus?
I've got lesions at the frontotemporal region.
so C. O.D. could be subdural hematoma.
there's also patterned bruising around the neck, which raises the possibility of strangulation.
1. 5 million.
what?
that's the population of our fair city.
that's how many suspects we've got.
we are now standing outside the offices of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner.
and guess who's been tasked to examine the body.
why, none other than Judge Joan Hunt's daughter...
conspiracy, conflict of interest, maybe a little bit of both?
stay tuned.
Ugh! Are you crazy?
you could've broken my nose.
and if I was carrying evidence or pushing a body, you coulda just broken a case.
actually, I just did.
that old woman that you posted... Doris Roth.
she died from complications of Crohn's.
great. Let me see it.
Ethan, this ain't my report.
this is the "Temple of Justice" web site.
well, I like to stay informed.
if following Sheila Temple means you informed, I don't want to know nothin' about nothin'.
you should bone up on this case, because it's about to become our nightmare.
Oh, you see. I got this.
Hey, boys, Dr. Ethan Gross.
how you doing? - Hell no.
let's go... - You can back your ass right back in that elevator.
Oh, come on, guys. Just a couple of questions.
Unh-unh. I got a couple of answers. - Just a couple of questions.
I'd love to. I just... - Say it walking.
Dr. Ethan Gross. - Move.
fine, fine. - I'm sorry.
move.
you know, you're a real people person.
it's your gift.
you might want to hold on to this.
this case is gonna suck you in.
chalk this up to a problem that solved itself.
what does that sign say?
this is where I get a lecture from "Dr. Megan Hunt." HIC LOCUS EST UBI MORS GAUDET SUCCURRERE TITEA
the... oh, I'm sorry. That's... it's...
this is where death rejoices to teach the living.
it is never a place where the living disparage the dead, so keep your opinions to yourself and focus on the facts.
both translations seem to work.
don't encourage him.
now... Yeah.
Dr. Gross. - Mm-hmm.
okay.
light, patterned abrasions on the right side of her face, cheek and orbit.
which means the killer might have worn gloves when he hit her.
a theory supported by the indistinct hand impressions on her neck.
contusions on the posterior lower back, bilaterally, and...
she has a 6-inch laceration on her left calf.
looks like there's trace.
get a sample and take it to the lab.
and get them to process a sexual assault kit.
we have a tear.
beaten down and possibly raped.
somebody really had their way with her.
you don't know the half of it.
she had dirt underneath her eyelids. So?
so that means she was blinking.
was buried alive.
the world's waiting on your determination.
Oh, great. You know how much I love publicity.
want me to take it?
additional findings support the theory that Hillary was beaten and then buried alive.
the only thing she doesn't have are defensive wounds.
it just freaks me out that this hand ended a 5 year old's life.
alright, Dr. Gross, since you are so fascinated by this case,
I would like you to section all of the organs and then write up the autopsy report.
get to know Hillary better.
trust me. I know her. - No, you do not.
you only know what's been said about her.
this is Hillary.
all right. Can we release cause of death?
my preliminary determination is asphyxiation contributed by agonal aspiration of gastric contents and dirt.
isn't Bud supposed to be present for this?
Yeah, he's heading downstairs. Hillary's mother's here.
ruth Stone has just arrived to identify the body of her dead daughter.
Philly P. D.
make a path!
I'm not gonna say it twice!
you all right?
they slashed my tires, cracked my windshield, egged my house.
lord knows what they're gonna do to me.
well, they'll have to go through me.
Mrs. Stone. - Come on.
Mrs. Stone, are you finally ready to break your silence?
please don't.
well, what are you feeling right now, Mrs. Stone, grief or relief?
we are so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stone.
may I see her?
no. I'm... I'm afraid that's not possible while the case is ongoing, but soon.
do you have any idea where your daughter may have gone after her release yesterday morning?
we were supposed to get together...
uh, on the weekend.
we hoped that the hubbub would've died down.
hil had a hard life.
she was always a little bit wild but sweet and joyous.
then she... entered high school and she met Craig.
he got her pregnant and led her down the wrong path.
I'm sure that you did the very best you could.
but sometimes, holding them close creates more of a distance.
I thought when my beautiful grandson Simon was born, maybe that would've grounded her.
now they're both gone.
what's she doing here?
uh, that is my mother.
your mother must be very proud to have such an accomplished daughter.
please know that I care about justice for Hillary just as much as she did.
if you'll excuse me?
have you read the paper today?
I've had enough of the media, thank you.
well, they wrote an op-ed about me, and it is not flattering.
mother, everybody knows you handled that case impeccably.
well, as usual, you've missed the point.
I came here to forbid you to talk to the press, either on your behalf or to defend me.
my election is tomorrow, and this case is poison.
Oh, my God. Just write a rebuttal.
get ahead of it.
that's exactly why I'm here, because you think that's a good idea.
no talking, no press.
okay?
got it.
always a pleasure, Joan.
judge Joan's bungling of the case left Hillary a free woman.
well, citizens of Philadelphia, let's give her a little brotherly payback.
her reelection's up... - Your mom's taking a bath.
I'm sure her opponent's thrilled.
she doesn't have one.
it is a yea or nay vote whether to reconfirm her for another ten years.
so she could lose to nobody?
isn't there something you should be doing?
Oh, finished sectioning.
uh, the organs are bagged and back in the body.
I'm just waiting for the lab to e-mail me the, uh, sexual assault results.
in the break room?
welcome to generation.
I mean, here I am, out of the office, still connected.
why does everybody keep doing that?
Oh, look, you got them five minutes ago.
and they are positive. What the hell, Ethan?
I'm s... s... I'm sorry.
no, you're not.
okay, well, maybe I'm not.
excuse me ? ???
hillary Stone killed her little boy.
she then put him in a sack and dumped him in the river.
now I know I'm not supposed to let my personal feelings seep in, but... it took a year for them to try to get justice for Simon, and then it didn't happen.
so what's another five minutes?
you may feel that way, but get over it. - Why?
because we don't pay you to waste my time.
so I'll call Bud. - No, you will not.
I'll do it.
I got Hillary's tox results.
I dug around into her personal history.
do you know, when she was 7, the police found her next to her mother's unconscious body?
her father's fists were so swollen, he couldn't turn the knob to let the cops in.
abuse does terrible things to people.
Yeah, and 99% of them channel their damage in other ways.
but they're still damaged, Kate, which is probably why we found booze and Diazepam in her system.
that explains why she didn't fight back.
this whole case just breaks my heart.
listen, Kojak.
I done it to that wraith.
first of all, my name is detective Morris.
and second of all, no, you didn't.
thank you. Thank you very much.
I took that bitch down.
I don't know why you ain't listening to me.
maybe because most killers don't voluntarily confess, you know?
well, it's my conscience. It's killing me.
detective Morris...
Oh, no, no. You got this one.
everyone becomes nut in the city and wants credit for killing Hillary.
Yeah, except for the actual killer.
Yeah.
sexual assault results came back positive on Craig Bena.
Ooh, the ex. Uh, I'll rustle up an address.
sadly, I saw a minute of "Temple of Justice" last night.
he's on her show today.
please, help me find the killer.
they're my family.
and they've been taken away from me.
and the killer is still out there.
what if the same person got both of them?
what if I'm next?
just wait right there. - Thank you. someone has to do something.
so please...
please...
if you know anything...
uh, Craig, here you go.
you accused the media of vilifying you, yet, here you are on my show, begging for sympathy over Hillary's death.
you invited me.
Oh, apples and oranges, Craig.
who accepted the offer, huh?
well, let's ask the pros.
Randy, can I have the mic?
thank you. Here is a man some of you may remember as gallantly protecting Hillary's mother this morning, one of Philadelphia's finest detectives.
and then we have Dr. Megan Hunt, daughter of the judge who helped create this mess in the first place.
what have you to say for yourself?
you missed a spot.
every bit as charming as her mother.
we'll be right back.
Ronnie, thank you. - And we're clear.
all right.
so...
are you here to finally give me the interview your mother wouldn't?
right.
well, whenever you're ready, you know where to find me.
Mm. Under a rock.
and until then, I think I'll just get back to my guest.
actually, uh, this interview is over.
what? Why?
because it's our turn to talk to the killer.
I am impressed.
take to the airwaves, profess your innocence, throw the guilt out there somewhere, except everybody knows that...
you know that Hillary killed your son.
that is not true.
Hillary's mom certainly thinks so, says you're the reason she went down the wrong path.
Yeah, and she always had it out for me, hated that I actually made her daughter happy.
do you think that, uh,
Mrs. Stone knows about yesterday?
because we certainly know you had sex with Hillary.
care to tell us how that...
came to pass, Craig?
the day she got released, she showed up at my place, had a few drinks, and then we made love.
love?
well, this...
doesn't look...
like love to me.
those marks look like your hands around her neck.
hil liked it a little rough.
buried alive is kind of rough?
I didn't kill her.
afterwards, we both fell asleep.
when I woke up, she was gone.
y... you want me to believe that she just showed up, had her way with you, and then just disappeared?
Yes. That was life with Hil.
I know it sounds crazy.
it does.
though little I've learned from your legendary teaching methods,
I know that only oxygen deprivation can cause darkened cells like that.
did I teach you that?
and, yes, the anoxic brain damage certainly supports asphyxiation.
but you're looking for bigger answers, aren't you?
not the cause of death, but the cause of life.
well, everyone says Hillary was such a monster, that she did all these horrible things without any bit of remorse.
even if that is true, maybe there's something identifiable in the brain.
sometimes crazy is just crazy.
it's just in the genes. - I cannot accept that.
I have the result from the trace on Hillary's leg.
it's a polyepoxide copolymer with a hint of...
wait for it...
triethylenetetramine.
that's a resin that's used as a sealant around the windows on boats.
did I teach you that, too? - No, believe it or not, my dad did.
well, get yourself to the marina, skipper, because there's one about a mile from the crime scene.
s... skipper.
go to work. Yes.
and why exactly have I met you here?
the cut on Hillary's leg is probably from her being put through a boat window, so if we find a broken one, we could possibly find the killer.
okay. - Are you the cop from TV?
Oh, yes, ladies, this is him, in the flesh.
I told you it was him.
you totally protected that old lady in her car, even though she raised that psycho.
are you looking for the killer?
girls, best just let us do our jobs.
okay? - Okay.
tweet you later.
bud Morris, you're a superhero.
Notoriety's a double-edged sword, my friend.
take that old lady who raised her psycho daughter and grandson and had both of them taken away.
what's she left with...
slashed tires, egg on her house?
a mother's love turns into a public's hate.
Hey.
you think I killed Hillary?
you're a prison guard.
I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but from where I sit, it looks pretty bad, Ms. Raymond.
look, we bonded during her trial.
that girl... she was innocent.
so I told her, if she needed a safe haven, she could find it on my boat.
well, it worked like gangbusters.
and then what happened?
two days ago, Hillary shows up.
I'm headed off to work.
she's messed up, definitely drunk.
Mm-hmm. - So I gave her a couple of sedatives.
I locked her in.
I... I love your concept of safe haven.
it sounds exactly like jail.
it was for her own good.
I didn't want her wandering off, finding herself in harm's way.
she must have woke up and freaked out.
you drugged her and you locked her in.
what did you think was gonna happen?
come on.
me and you, we... we're on the same team.
can't we just see eye to eye?
are you kidding?
we're processing your boat as we speak.
I'm still trying to figure out Hillary's actions on the day of her release.
she gets out, goes to see her ex-boyfriend, has sex with him, and then comes here.
Why?
combo lock.
it means that Hillary couldn't get out, but anyone who had the number could enter.
well, I bet somebody did, otherwise, why would you kick out a window with your bare feet?
okay, I've got what looks like epithelials.
collect, label, and let's get out of this dump.
you know what?
my dad would've loved to own a boat like this.
Really? - Yeah.
he really couldn't afford to have another kid.
I was adopted because he really wanted a boy.
some people are meant to be parents.
this case is really bothering you, huh?
the one that bothers me is the one we didn't get to investigate.
so the info about the boat is out there, on Twitter, as a matter of fact, with a hunky picture of Bud attached.
and the media is now trying to align you with your mother, which is doing this office no favors.
Sheila Temple's right outside, waiting for us to trip up.
uh, I may have something.
uh, the flakes on the pillowcase contain sebaceous secretions of malassezia furfur and tragacanth.
dandruff. Something that Hillary did not have.
maybe Tanya does.
no, she doesn't.
just came from holding where I personally checked myself.
we may have her on unlawfully restraining Hillary, but we don't have her on flaky scalp.
so who else was on that boat?
I'll be right back.
bless you, Amanda, - and thank you for watching. - Thank you.
all right? And good luck.
Mm-hmm, and thank you for coming by.
we'll be here all day.
ms. Temple.
Oh, are you finally ready for your interview?
uh, no, no, I would just like a moment in private, please.
well, whatever you say to me, you can say to my public.
are you rolling?
ladies and gentlemen, the interview that only I could score.
Dr. Megan Hunt... a name which may ring a bell...
because she shares it with the woman who let Hillary go free.
my mother adjudicated without bias or error.
Oh, come on.
including suppressing the bag that was found near poor little Simon's body, which had Hillary's D. N.A. on it?
wait. You mean the bag that the prosecution failed to disclose, then lost, then found again?
judge Hunt did her job, just as I am doing mine.
well, I'm sure that brings us all a great degree of comfort.
there has been a major break in the case.
evidence has been found linking someone to the disappearance of Hillary Stone and possibly her murder.
you heard it here first. Who is it?
you.
cut.
what is this, some kind of publicity stunt?
Oh, we don't need theatrics, Ms. Temple, because we actually have evidence to back up our claims.
like what?
you have eczema, which your makeup guy tried to cover, but, mm, really didn't do a very good job.
and because of that, you have to use natural hairspray like naturecoat, which contains tragacanth, flakes of which we found on Tanya Raymond's boat.
a lot of people use natural hairspray, Sherlock.
I would be very happy to scrape your scalp to confirm.
you see, Ms. Temple, we don't take callers or commercial breaks...
just confessions.
I had seen the shaky evidence against Hillary.
I knew the case would never make, but I also knew that Hillary would never grant me an interview when she got out.
so you paid her prison guard to get close to her, gain her trust.
that's really classy.
I offered incentives in exchange for drawing Hillary in.
imagine my delight when Tanya called me on the very day of Hillary's release.
we showed up at the boat with the cameras rolling, burst in.
al Capone's vault
I'm gonna need to see that footage, Ms. Temple.
it is your alibi.
fine.
Oh, my goodness.
the polls are open.
my condolences to your mother's career.
Wow. Big turnout.
I see you didn't take my advice.
you appeared on that show yesterday and again this morning, stumping for me.
both times, case related.
that's always your excuse, isn't it?
well, you just added fuel to the fire.
mother, you of all people should understand that I want justice for Hillary.
well, welcome to my world, darling.
the court of public opinion convenes and convicts before charges are brought.
you gotta be kidding me.
you really working that "woe is me" angle?
do I know you?
no, but I know you.
you put killers back on the street.
I got kids. I'd like them to be able to walk around without fearing for their lives.
okay, come on, mom.
no. No, Megan.
now hooligan is gonna scare me off.
you're going down, just like that bitch you set free.
behind this door lies an unsuspecting Hillary Stone.
well, Hillary, get ready...
for last call.
it is time to face the...
Oh, for the love of Pete.
she must have gone out the window.
well, cut, cut, cut.
I am so tired of this sugar!
you happy? - No.
I'd like to see everything you shot, please.
my first amendment rights...
okay, you say first amendment. I say obstruction of justice.
the judge will say contempt of court.
how long you gonna spend in jail?
well, you heard him, Mr. man. Scoot.
Yes, ma'am.
I used to watch you, you know, back when you were a real journalist.
Oh, past tense? Ouch.
what happened?
success.
bigger cases.
you see it, too, detective.
what we do isn't all that different.
Mm.
you're really gonna try that line on me?
you hate me, don't you?
no comment.
well, off the record...
I don't totally love who I've become either.
go back to journalism.
we could use you.
what's stopping you?
all cued up to the crime scene, Ms. Temple.
and here are your glasses.
thank you, Ronnie.
uh, actually, it's... it's Dan.
but you're welcome, Ms. Temple.
Darren, what are you doing?
I swear to God, the body's over there.
if you do not get me a shot of that body, you're gonna be back shooting bar mitzvahs next week.
could you stop it right there, please?
well, I'll be damned.
he was there before the story broke.
I told you, I did her. I want credit for it.
walk me through what happened.
uh, it's... it's, like, dusk.
I'm cutting through the site on my way over to...
it don't matter where.
I see this chick. She's kinda hot.
looks lost.
holy crap, it's that baby-killing skank.
so I took her down.
how? You hit her, kick her, what?
kicked her first.
where?
the left, on her left side.
and she bounced off that backhoe.
and then?
and then what?
she lay in the hole and dies like the dog that she was.
that's all I'm saying.
let's go.
gotta say, his story holds up.
his story is just what the media's been reporting.
Ah, but that's why I asked about the kick.
your preliminary autopsy report said that there was a kidney puncture and bruising on the left.
the media doesn't have that detail.
since when do you read the prelims?
it may surprise you to know, but always.
are you sure it was the left side?
I know your reports better than you do?
I didn't write it.
that doesn't sound like you.
you're right. It doesn't.
contusions and lacerations on the left kidney, just like Victor said.
something's not right.
what, like you being wrong for once?
I am never wrong.
the body is always right.
and I just don't know Hillary as well as I should.
left kidney, right kidney.
left's got the puncture.
Yes, but the rib is fractured on the right.
call Ethan.
Why?
because I'm gonna kill him.
what's up, guys?
I'm missing the last frame of league night.
tell me, Dr. Gross...
is it possible for a rib to jump across the body and lacerate the opposite kidney?
what? No.
then please explain your findings in the autopsy report...
mislabeled organs, misattributed injuries, and possibly, the entire case compromised.
left side triangles, right side squares...
you cut them into different shapes so you do not make rookie mistakes, which you did!
I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry. I'm gonna fix this...
no, you will not touch a thing!
I am sick of your damn attitude, your disrespect towards me, and especially, your disrespect towards Hillary.
Dr. Gross...
come with me.
please find a tech and pull Hillary's body out of the drawer.
Thanks. I thought I was about to end up on a table.
still with the jokes, really?
you know, Megan had every right to rip your head off.
what you did is either sabotage, incompetence, or at the very least, negligence.
d... it was one mistake.
on a case where you have made your opinion abundantly known.
Dr. Murphy, I'm so...
you know what, Ethan?
this is a big city. We're gonna catch big cases.
if you can't handle this kind of thing,
I can recommend a few fellowship programs in Allegheny County.
no, no, no. I love it here. It... I...
look, I don't know what it was...
the... the media, the pressure, I just...
I took my eye off the ball.
lame excuses aren't really helping.
okay. You're right. I...
I hate this woman.
I hate that we have to put somebody in jail for this.
so you think, sometimes, it's okay to kill?
well, no, but she...
she...
no, I don't.
I don't.
I'm gonna go apologize to Dr. Hunt.
no, Ethan, you're gonna take the night, clear your head, and we will see you in the morning.
what about you?
you think Hillary Stone killed her son?
Yeah, I do.
and it doesn't matter.
we'll see you in the morning.
Oh, damn it.
so you've heard?
I am so sorry.
I came to tell you myself, but I... I guess I'm going to have to learn that the media beats you every time.
you okay?
how does the Internet say I'm dealing with it?
mother, come on.
I never imagined that an entire career could be... undone by two days of bad press.
frankly, I'm...
I'm shell-shocked.
mom...
uh, Hillary's ready for you.
you said it yourself... I did my job.
now you go do yours.
I'm really sorry about your mom.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
my mother's tough, so I'm tough.
it's all in the genes, remember?
Ah, there's one.
two.
left kidney, no presenting damage, consistent with my original findings.
right...
lacerated and contused.
so Victor didn't do it.
he was just looking for a little fame.
and you were right, as usual.
no, I wasn't.
there is a perinephric hematoma around the vasculature that I missed before.
but a rib can't do that, can it?
no, it can't.
this is usually caused by a dramatic change in momentum.
like her fall out the boat window.
no, it would take more force than that.
probably all of the injuries on her left side are from the fall and on the right...
the broken jaw, the rib, the lacerated kidney...
that comes from some kind of rapid deceleration.
okay, so?
so this is the missing piece of the puzzle.
hillary didn't walk to the construction site.
she caught a ride with her killer.
we finally know the timeline of Hillary's last day.
after she was released, she went to see her ex-boyfriend Craig.
whom she slept with, and then for reasons unknown, left to go to Tanya's, where she was taken prisoner, drugged, escaped, and then someone, possibly a stranger...
or Craig...
or Craig drove her to the construction site, stopping suddenly enough to send her into the dash.
which is most likely the patterned impression we found on her jaw.
she was then dragged into a predug hole, which became her grave.
then we need to find that driver.
Dr. Gross, back in the house.
Dr. Hunt, I...
I apologize for my earlier transgressions.
let's find this tool.
knowing we're looking for a vehicle,
I focused on the tread marks from Peter's photos of the crime scene.
now after, uh, examining Hillary's momentum injuries,
I discovered that she had been traveling at about 35 miles per hour.
so you're looking for a short skid.
I found one.
two sets of tires, short skid.
could be the killer's car.
they're clean, unbroken.
it means the car didn't have antilock brakes.
one problem... skid marks don't give tire tread.
you have a shot just past the marks?
right there. That's the car driving away, and those are the treads.
Hey, Ethan. Zoom in.
enhance.
no, something's wrong.
one is very different from the other three.
now why would that be?
I might know.
this model doesn't have antilock brakes.
this tire's different.
after it got slashed, she probably got the cheapest replacement.
detective Morris, Dr. Hunt?
I... I wasn't expecting you, was I?
I think maybe you were, Mrs. Stone.
you drove Hillary to the construction site.
your tire treads will place you there.
you didn't come by the morgue to I. D. your daughter, did you?
you came to see her body after what you'd done.
may I see her now?
no.
I'm sorry. Not under these circumstances.
I'm gonna need to place you under arrest, Mrs. Stone.
please let me see her.
if you do, I'll tell you everything.
the day she was released, she called me in a panic.
I picked her up at the marina, and I was driving her home.
she told me about her day.
I couldn't... couldn't understand why... why she didn't stay with Craig.
Why?
then she said...
she didn't want to be with Craig.
she just wanted to sleep with him to have another baby.
that's what you said, isn't it, honey?
that you wanted to get it right next time?
and at that moment, I knew...
she'd killed Simon.
I must have...
slammed on the brakes.
Hillary... flew into the dashboard, and... and I reached out to...
to see if she was okay.
she looked at me.
she jumped out of the car and...
she was running away, and...
I tried to stop her, but...
she tripped and...
she hit her head.
and when I got to her, she was...
lying in that hole.
you weren't moving, honey.
and so I covered you.
we...
I wanted peace for you.
I'm so sorry, baby girl.
I'm so sorry.
it's over now.
it's over.
Oh, my baby.
yet another shocking turn in the Stone family murders, as grandmother and mother to the victims is arrested in connection with the death of acquitted killer Hillary Stone.
the very woman who sat behind her every day in court...
poor woman. - now sits behind bars...
we're gonna have to put her through the system just like her daughter.
I've been doing this job for many years, people, but today is different.
I've had a real wakeup call.
I may have made missteps...
professionally...
and personally.
I think I got through to her at least.
so...
I've taken a moment to reflect.
you may be right.
and I've realized that I am disgusted with the likes of Trent Wilcoe, who set his wife on fire... just because she burnt his roast.
reality check, people.
I'm not the bad guy. He is.
so join us next week for the trial of the century.
I called your office.
they said you were taking a personal day?
I recused myself from the bench effective immediately.
nobody wants a lame-duck judge.
mother, I... I am...
I'm really sorry if anything I said or... or... or did caused you to...
no apology necessary.
I'm making jam.
you are making jam.
Yeah, well, no time like the present.
after all, I need a new career.
mom...
you remember that accident that we had?
when I was about Lacey's age, you were driving me to swim practice, and you skidded on that patch of wet leaves.
Yeah, I hurt my knee because I rear-ended that pickup truck.
Yeah, but I was okay because you did that thing that you do with your arm... reach out and protect me.
do you know you did that yesterday when you stood up to that idiot?
I did? - Yeah.
you mean I still have some maternal instincts?
nothing stronger.
well, now there... there may be.
what, jam? It's mostly bourbon.
Oh, my God.
it's good.
I know. I've had it all day.
I am the same as any other woman here.
ladies, is that right? Do you find Ms Witham here to be one of you?
is this your security aprove? Kate, you need this to work.
het is not real. Kate Andrews doesn't exsist. It's no joke what happened to her.
but maybe now she'll get of her high horse and let me take her out.
fuck you!
we built a bad bomb, girls. Hee, your face... It's not so bad.
I mean, it looks like she made out with a cheesegrater.
men like Marco Moretti should not be working in the factory.
it's a disaster waiting to happen. Well then, Lorna, you'll get him out.
I will, just got to figure out how.
it says right here, Germans are slipping a noose around Leningrad.
can you imagine? They're facing a long, tough winter.
Russians are resilient. Have you watched the movie the Scarlet Empress?
I'll bet they'll be planning victory gardens out front the winterpalace.
Yeah, 'cause the rich just love to share. In times of trouble, we're all the same.
last pass. Four minutes to shift.
I'd give the people of Leningrad more credit.
you all live with six people in a small house through winter.
trust me, comes spring, Ruskies have been throttling each other.
no metal, make sure that goes into your locker.
what do you think, Mr Moretti? About what?
the Russian, under siege. Can they keep the line, altogether?
no point speculating, people always surprise you.
I don't see why we should feel sorry for Russia. -Of course, you wouldn't.
they were Hitlers allies only a few months ago.
but then, changing sides is something your people know all about.
my people? That Italian newspaper you got.
you know, I take it back, Lorna You're one person who never surprises.
they're bringing in who?
good God!
management is arriving for a spot and special. They've brought the colonel.
victory Munitions Matches
the department of defense knows all about our little hick-up with the 25 pounders.
which means the owners got us on the firing lane to prove were up to snuff.
what's going on? Inspection.
every line gets them. You just never know when.
no errors today! Make sure of it, Mrs Corbett. Yes, sir!
we know how to tow the line, don't we girls?
do they check our identity papers? Not if you don't give them a reason.
military being here doesn't make it any different.
don't forget, these inspectors they're on our side.
will they check our lockers?
don't worry, Kate. It's the same drill Lorna gives us.
checking for stray metal, maybe a tack.
easy fellow. I already got a date for saturday.
sorry to have kept you waiting, come right in.
I trust you check the mens lockers as well?
careless, Miss Andrews.
nothing here. This one's clean.
morning! How is the patient?
she'd crack you a big old smile, except her face might split down the middle.
I really could use a bandage. It needs the open air to heal.
and I'd kill for a decent nights sleep.
don't you get a pil at night? Doesn't do the trick.
I'll mention it to the doctor. Would you? That be grand.
the girls from Victory Munition have sent over another package.
any cigarettes? I don't think so.
get me a pack, next time you're out?
balloons need air, Vera... so do patients.
can't hide in here for ever.
so, we're all clear here? You boys find anything?
we're just inspectors, mam. Wanna dig? Then talk to the mayor.
miss Corbett? You wanted to see me?
I've found this locket on the clean site. Not where it should have been
I'm sorry. It says...
I found it on the street. I thought it was pretty.
miss Corbett? I hate to make trouble, but I believe one of the inspectors stole something from my locker.
it's my perfume, Fleurs de rocaille. My fiancee gave it to me.
I'm sure you know what is costs these days to get a luxury like that from Paris.
where is the sense in bringing it here?
the sense of smell, I suppose. How else does a girl cope with the cordite?
perhaps you should look in Mrs Andrews locker. I didn't...
I didn't take it. You say you've found this locket, but whose to say you didn't lift it from...
one of the Marions that work here, and now with an expensive perfume missing.
I'm sure it was one of the inspectors who took it. Likely for his girl, or...
I was there. With the inspectors.
miss Corbett? It's not a stolen locket.
then you have nothing to worry about. Do you?
we're under a microscope here, girls
I told you, it wasn't Kate.
since Miss Witham was a victim of theft...
my only choice is to dock the cost of that perfume from your pay check.
What?! That's not fair. Like I'd steal her stupid toilet water!
a bottle like that is about $40. More actually. We'd have to give up halfs a day pay!
please, it doesn't matter. It certainly does.
you might have been stupid to have brought it here, but that doesn't mean it's alright to take it.
I'm putting you in the storeroom to verify shipping lots.
by myself?
it's a change to ask yourself some questions, Miss Andrews.
look, these are wedding announcements, recepies, football scores.
don't spar with my intelligence, Mr Moretti, I'm not a fool.
if this were a fascist communique we've found in your locker, it would be in code. I've lived in Canada since I was two.
I have the right to work here. The factory vetted me.
mr Akins, you've hired an Italian to work in a munitions factory.
with all the men oversea, the pool is limited.
his family ran a fireworks factory before the war.
before the war was another world.
mr Moretti, you need to change clothes and come with us.
you're arresting me?
Harold, do something! Tell him. My hands are tied.
if you had done your job in the first place we wouldn't be dancing this Tarantella.
and now lets go!
steel yourself.
don't tell me. Your mother is out for blood.
don't, I smell of cordite.
someone stole my Fleurs de rocaille.
that stinks.
I'm not surprised. I'm sure the girls were sick with envy.
don't worry, I'll buy you another bottle.
except now my matron is docking their pay. They can't afford it.
if it's any consolation, I dont mind the smell of cordite one bit.
????
you're a peach.
what's got mother on the warpath? What do you think?
Ugh, don't tell me, our wedding?
best spray yourself with something, one sniff of that explosive and she'll burst into flames.
wedding invitations went in the post this morning.
and this afternoon at the club, Mary Kimbarr comes in to tell me about Dick Spencer.
who is Dick Spencer? James hasn't told you?
my cousin Richard walked out on his wife.
he bolted like a feral pig, with his children's nanny.
honestly, mother, there is a war going on. Men are dying, children are fatherless.
the whole of Leningrad is under a Nazi chokehold. We are under a chokehold too.
all eyes will be on this wedding waiting for any whiff of scandal and when you...
shake the hand of a men who sneared at marriage by running off with the staff...
you make a mockery of your own union.
mother, who cares what people think.
do you remember what happend at the Robinsons when they invited that pro-Hitler Brownchurch...
to their silver anniversary? Social exile.
I'll speak with Richard, we'll work out a solution. Splendid.
when you occupy the top shelf, darling, people are only too eager to drag you down.
queer way of serving your country, planting a newspaper in a men's locker.
he reads that rag every day. Time the authorities knew about it.
so you're watching him?
who knows what's in that newspaper.
gets worked up about what he reads. Decides to help the Nazi cause.
that's a man with a lot of explosives on his hands.
if he has done nothing wrong... then he has nothing to worry about.
you know I fought alongside some Italians in my war?
you fight with Marco Moretti. That's true.
but from what you tell me, he was...
just a kid at the time and already living in Canada, so.
since early September, German forces have surrounded the city, cutting off
this is what the doctor ordered.
leningrad from outline regions Your second sleeping pil.
this means the world. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
impossible. I can't believe it.
buster knew all about it. Said they took him last night.
took who? Where?
he's been taking to the internment camp in Petawawa.
seemed like such a nice man.
works just as hard as us, fighting jerries.
well, we don't turn folks for no reason. And if he's a risk, then good riddance.
you honestly think Marco is an enemy fascist?
don't forget your turban. No need.
I'm down in the storeroom again today.
I wouldn't care for that. It's the kind of place murders look.
isn't that a lovely thought? Something wrong?
my scarf, it was right here. Again?!
somebody has got it in for me.
did you tell Miss Corbett?
???
what are you doing?
lets just say I've learned a thing or two about how to catch a thief.
I got to admit... Since Marco started here, she never liked him.
it's hard to fight them overseas, if we're busy sharing biscuits here.
that's what I'll be living of, thanks to Gladys getting our pay docked.
I'm so sorry. I'll pay each and every one of you back.
think you can buy us off? What else am I supposed to do?
start by not ratting in the first place.
well, if something's missing, could be us next, lets not forget that.
I can't stop thinking about those internment camps.
they say it's worse then being a prisoner of war.
sure seems different here without him.
Hello?! Hello?!
if you're going to smoke that, do it away from the oxygen tanks.
hee, Vera. Hee, come on. I won't bite!
I'm dying for a cigarette.
it's nice to see a friendly face. At least, half of one.
hee... Vera...
if you can't laugh about it, I aint running after you, I promise you.
hee, look...
Vera... Lets come for a fire?
don't the Vic-Mu girls bring you cigs?
I can't stand hearing them go on about how sorry they are for me.
I know what that's like. I'm sitting here in pieces and you haven't even cracked a joke yet.
at least you can find the bright side.
which in your case, seems to be the left side.
I ought to clock you. Go ahead.
pu... pu... put me out of my misery.
hee... You got to laugh about it...
or you're gonna cry.
Yeah, except I only got one eye that works.
that's the spirit.
say, you fellows work the storerooms?
we work wherever you want, sweetheart.
I was doing inventory and I heard the singing.
that be me. Howdy, I'm Donald.
Kate, nice to meet you. Wherever did you learn to sing like that?
it comes natural. Way all good things do.
well, I just wanted to say it was very nice.
hope we can make music again sometime.
you, Hazel?
you're the thief?! You're nutty as a fruitcake.
Gladys, you've gotta be kidding. Her hands are purple.
I set a trap.
I poured silver-nitrate from the first-aid kit into my purse.
and look, our thief's hands are a telltale purple.
I've cut myself on a casing this morning. Is that a crime, disinfecting it?
Where's the bandage? Quit wrecking stuff.
maybe you did cut yourself, but you can't deny that smell is Fleurs de rocaille.
Fleur the what? Hazel is no thief.
colognes are all the same, roses and lavender. I could tell that smell anywhere.
let me get this right, You poured dye into your own purse?
like I said... a fruitcake.
nice pipes. Oh, Donald.
great river Valley. Is that your story?
is there a boy overseas that you're sweet on?
me? No.
it's just my mom and my brothers I miss.
how about you teach me? Oh. I uh...
couldn't teach anybody anything.
it's you I could learn from.
well...
first... we best gets the bellows flop.
I'm just trying to school you. Try again.
stop that!
come now, Katy, why did you bring me down here?
I didn't invite anybody! You work here!
please! Stop!!
relax, I won't tell anybody.
he had it coming.
is he dead?
he'll be back on his feet soon enough. Won't know what hit him.
if he thinks I did this, I can get into real trouble.
Dunn won't report nothing, it means he has to tell the boss what he was doing here.
he just said he was working. I'm the one stationed down here, not him.
so, that was you singing this morning?
you best get going, before he comes to.
it was your voice in the dark.
you're really good, you know that? And look at the trouble it got me.
what happened to Mr Moretti?
the girls are gossiping, I would like to make an end to their tall tales.
you can tell them that I am hiring a new materials controller.
shame too.
Moretti's experience was tailor-made for this place.
I'm sure you'll find someone else. I'll have to.
he'll be in turn now with his father. Rest of his family be going hungry.
I pushed his pay cheques through petty cash.
I can't send money through the mail. What do I want it for?
it needs to get to his family.
then you deliver it, You're the one who fired him.
he's not going to be happy seeing me.
well, he's not going to roll out the welcome mat for me either.
take this money. Give it to the Moretti family tonight.
I'll race you.
this day already got me beat and, now you're lining up to kick me in the dirt?
is your thief still at large? Yes and no. I caught the girl.
hazel McDugall, but you think anyone would believe me? You caught her?
well, no, she's added my new scarf to her cachet, but it's the one you gave me.
that's terrible. So now it's war.
I she thinks she can just take what's mine... she'll find her own ramparts getting stormed.
maybe you ought to step over this cesspool.
why would I?
you don't want to make waves, too many people find out you work on the factoryfloor.
James, I want you to help me not stop me.
it's just a stupid bottle of perfume. Yeah, from you.
maybe I'm a little old fashioned, but I don't like to share.
what are you doing here? I live here.
they said you were taken to an internment camp.
chained up deprived of food and water, is that what you were hoping? No, I... The internment camp...
was hear-say, just like the gossip that got the authorities swarming me.
????
.???
mr Akins sent this, it's you pay.
you planted that newspaper, didn't you?
they said to report any suspicious behavior.
the government cleared el chito di no caradese months ago.
but they came and arrested me anyway. Now my security clearance is shot.
mom ???
...??
me Lorna Corbett...
pay cheque... not... in... mail.
...???
???
...??
you... come... eat.
no, mamma. Oh, no, no.
no, thank you, I should go. No no no. Mama... Marco...
???
...??
??
okay... You have to stay.
your whole family... My sister and the kids are out.
my mother doesn't know that's my last pay cheque.
keep it that way.
go.
I'd wish you ran and found me. But I wasn't frightened.
not frightened?!
you watched a guy clobber your would-be rapist over the head.
maybe you're in shock. I would have been, except this man saved me.
Yeah, from himself. No, it wasn't like that.
the first negro I've ever spoken to, have you ever?
don't make a habit of it. Maybe he'll be in storeroom tomorrow.
then you be sure you aren't. It's my mess, he cleaned up.
I thought I'd be able to carry one thing from my past. This locket my mom gave me.
was I ever wrong.
that'll be Moira. She's on the rampage for some laundry soap.
Kate? It's Gladys Witham.
I've confirmed reports your inside this room. Gladys?
what a surprise! What the heck are you doing here?
so, this is where you live. I hope you don't mind I...
got Carol to look up your address. What brings you slumming?
I need help chasing down a thief.
we're having a quiet night in on the count that we don't have much spare cash.
if we find the culprit, your pay won't get docked.
do you really think Hazel took your things?
that scent is not something you can buy at your local Simsons.
we'll storm in like it's Leningrad. Catch her red handed.
or purple handed! Exactly.
come on, if we can find sniff out her loot, your name will be cleared.
beats a quiet night in, don't you think? Come on.
isn't this exciting?!
we're going to find the truth. That's what I'm afraid of.
sorry... I'm making such a mess.
???
mom says eat however ou like.
it's delicious.
eyes. Eyes.
always eyes.
that's how you trust. Trust.
my mom grows the seeds from herbs our relatives sent from Colombria.
italian seed in Canadian soil.
I wonder on whose side they're on
looks like you're taking a trip on the good ship "Could have been."
you're a mindreader now?
well... it aint a pretty voyage.
and it's hard to book return passage, but...
no worries... Archie is bringing you back.
I don't feel like it, thanks.
maybe I just leave you a few for later.
Oh, would you look at this? Who's been holding out on me?
Oh, Archie, don't! We've got a minnie the moocher here!
don't, leave it
you sure want to gasper now, don't you?
they upset my stomach, so I spit them out.
I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is. Get out of my room.
Vera... Get out of here now, this is my room!
you have no right barging in here.
wine every night?
you can't enjoy a good meal without it.
we like it so much, we have it twice in sunday.
you don't. Oh yeah, start first thing in the morning... at church.
no wonder there's so many Catholics.
you know, when I put that paper in your locker, I told myself...
that if you're innocent nothing would happen and...
and if you where guilty, then...
well, I have two sons in this war.
I tried enlisting.
the army said I would compromise troop cohesion.
so, I do my bit in the bomb factory instead.
at least, I did.
I'm sorry. My husband, he...
always tells me that I'm afraid of what I don't know.
so you come out swinging?
tell your mother thank you for diner.
you can try and hide it all you want, Lorna, but I know you have a decent heart beating in there. Tapping its secret code.
I don't have any secrets.
I'll walk home by myself.
goodbye, Lorna.
your friend Carol should stop giving out addresses.
hazel is about to get ransacked. We're not humiliating her, okay?
we have to scare her straight, Bets. I may be her only victim now, but who knows?
you may be next. There's the culprit.
where are you going? Hazel, you have to stop screaming.
you're making a mistake.
that's Hazel, spreading happiness wherever she goes.
wait, stop! Hazel, listen to me!
isn't that your fiancee?
you're an amazing woman. You're a beautiful woman.
there must be some explanation.
I need to know what's going on. I think you do.
I'm sorry, Gladys.
go get them.
how long has it been going on?
I told you, I never touched your stuff. Come on Hazel...
we both know you've had your paws on my perfume, my scarf...
and my fiancee.
do you still see him? You want to know?
ask James.
it's all love and roses, until the truth coms out.
don't worry, girls like you always get everything you want.
so you just took what was coming to you? Why should you get nice things and not me?
because I am his fiancee!
you know, all I have to do is tell Miss Cor... Go right ahead.
because all I have to do...
is stand outside the church on your wedding day
big smile... throwing rice in your face.
wouldn't your family love that?
there are two more Marions I need to talk to. Can I get their coordinates?
Lorna. Just who I was looking for.
going through resumes, looking for a new materials controller.
this fellow lists you as a reference. Me?
he says he knows your husband.
he drinks with Bob. Never seen the inside of a munitions factory.
there are better candidates.
Yeah. All overseas in uniform.
look at this geezer, born in 1880.
I doubt if he could move even one pellet.
and this blodger, great reference, his parole officer.
you do know...
mr Moretti was cleared of al charges?
so I can either fight with management to keep an able eyetie, or hire a useless canuk.
that inspection we just had. We both know it won't be our last.
you figure MOretti will only bring us more trouble?
actually, uh... I think he's our best change for passing.
Yes, Sir? Track down Marco Moretti for me.
I don't think I can afford them. I would love those
your scarf.
your perfume. What's left of it.
give this to Lorna. Make it right. And lose my job?
forget it. You've taken enough from me.
maybe he lied. Maybe you didn't know about me.
but this is your change to do the right thing.
don't think blues are shiftfree, Hazel.
no kidding.
thought for sure you were going to tear her up. Seems like someone else already did.
some of the girls are getting up a game. You want to come over?
I can't. James is taking me out for a late diner.
some new place. Supposed to be wonderful.
I hope it's not a grossly mess.
I wanted to thank you.
we never properly met. I'm Kate Andrews.
it was a thrill singing with you. It was just one song.
have a nice night.
I grew up in the church, singing hymnes all the time, but...
it's like you put the life back in it. How do you sing like that?
it's not for me to school you, Miss Andrews.
nice knowing you.
so.
you also answer to the new name you picked up off the streets.
it was just the sound.
I spoke to every Marion who works at Vic-Mu and none of them are missing a locket.
it also seems Gladys' perfume was returned.
yes... it's all worked out, hasn't it?
well, with this war on there's always something to keep your eye on.
your taste in women will get you in trouble, Leon.
you're the one got hurt. If you keep this up...
you'd wish you never met her. You touch her again, I will make sure...
you can't so much as push a broom around here.
do you understand me?
we'll see who's pushing brooms.
you want to learn something about singing?
get to know Billy Holiday.
leon says I have to meet some guy named Billy Holiday.
I can make the introductions.
a double dose of pills should have you sleeping like a baby.
you're an angel.
anything else? No that should do me.
good night.
thanks for not ratting me out.
who am I to tell a gimp how to run her life?
how many more do you need? Thirty.
you now, there are other ways.
factory takes care of you, you still have a job. I can't go back there.
not like this.
family? I told them I moved to Hollywood.
why give them the satisfaction they were right all along, that I'm nothing but a pretty face.
now I'm nothing.
and that aint even true.
you still got a killer figure.
and in all the right places. Beat it Archie.
we both need our beauty sleep.
good night Vera.
well, I just got my appetite. Right in time for diner.
what's that new scent? Soap and water.
why, how novel. Yes.
it seems we both like simple things.
something wrong, Gladys?
just the factory air. Sometimes it gets a little close.
I do hope they ventilate that office you're in.
I'd hate to think of you breathing the same noxious fumes as those floorgirls.
don't worry mother, they pipe in fresh mountain breezes from the Rockies.
you can't vex me tonight, dear. Not after your fiancees great deeds.
I'm afraid to ask.
James found his cousin an exceptable extrication from your wedding.
I told Richard that there was no way...
he is ruining my brides special day with some tardy show about his infidelity.
and so mister Spencer...
agreed to schedule a holiday during your nuptials.
how clever.
that way we can avoid any unpleasantness altogether.
you've got a great future in this town, James.
in fact, you've inspired another gambit of sorts.
I was thinking you might talk to John Abbly about his parents.
they're esteemed colleagues and competitors.
they begged off as they will still be in Barbados.
Gladys? What wrong now?
something has robbed me of my appitite. I'm sorry, James.
I'm not much up for a meal.
I may be a little overdressed for you.
Oh, the heck with you. I stole a recordplayer from Moira down the hall.
borrowed is probably a better word. Good point.
the pipes burst?
water everywhere.
you talked to him? I couldn't.
if I drive a crack in that wall now, the whole thing may come crumbling down.
well, you're here now.
that's something.
Billy Holiday too.
it was on special.
you don't really expect me to eat this, do you? You'll never know if you like it, unless you try.
is it supposed to be so mussy?
it's different Bob.
try something new.
not bad.
stop that!!! Please stop!!!
Yeah, when you add it all up this wars the best thing that happened to us.
writing letters to your own kids. Could you tell them daddy was shot down and died?
you could copy out what she's written, cost you nothing.
I'll walk home by myself.
who cares what people think.
when you occupy the top shelf darling people are only too eager to drag you down.
your fiancee? I need to know whats going on.
come on girls lets hustle. Betty we worked through lunch.
only 53 to go before we build Victory munitions millionth bomb.
we'll never make it before shift end.
yeah you're probably right, blue shift ain't the strongest.
you girls might stand a chance now. I'm collapsing when this is over.
no collapsing for me I'm coming back for movie night, I even booked a sitter.
be nice to see out.
and bring that husband of yours will ya, I'd like to meet him.
if our shift makes it we get to be in the news reel their making.
they'd better not be filming me.
you know I once made love to a woman without even touching her,
but even I can't shoot the millionth bomb from way up here.
only 25 bombs away. 976.
this is like shooting gold fish in a swimming pool.
worker safety comes first Mr. Joseph.
fine then let me shoot on Sunday when the line is down,
I need women rushing from the theaters to join the war machine.
only 20 to go. Don't you want to excite the nations ladies Mr. Aitkins... Huh.
Cordite, Amatol, they're explosives.
we'd use dummy materials no risk, just get me down there.
sir, blue shift is getting very close.
fantastic, alright now we start the story in the thick of it.
and there's our poster girl.
998. Oh we're so close.
ladies and gents may I present...
victory munitions millionth bomb!!
knew you'd come through in a pinch.
you did wonderful, very good, good job.
Lorna, congratulations.
you liked proving me wrong. Not at all.
when I think of her with James. Keep walking Gladys.
you already have it all you gotta take the millionth bomb from the reds too.
who's the thief now.
you know you swan around here like your the poster girl for happy engagement, but ask yourself...
if your fiancee loves you so much why'd he come wandering my way.
don't you're better than that.
allied forces have repulsed the siege to maintain full control of the strategic city of Tobruk.
that could be your son bombing Tobruk.
the letters he writes my kids are so real, it's like his over there.
Yeah, he was, last war.
tell him thanks.
it must be nice for your sons having his letters to lean on.
yes... it's a real comfort.
german forces are beginning to learn a hard lesson...
so I bought a Billy holiday record like you suggested she's aces.
could you teach me how she does her phrasing, it's like she's talking more than singing.
until you've been loved and left like Billy
I'm gonna get some corn.
are we listening to the same record, cause I hear a lady singing " don't judge me.
I found my star... Russell Joseph, your news reel director.
forget any close ups Mr Joseph, I can't be in your little movie.
wait, you have an elusive quality the camera would love.
well I'll be elusive right now and tell you to find another girl.
Goodnight.
rejections easier to take on a full stomach, won't you let me take you to dinner huh.
2 problems Russell Joseph, first, I'm engaged, and second, my mother told me never to go out with a man with two first names.
is he still looking at me? Oh he's eating you up with whipped cream.
Oh with all the good men off to war we're left with nothing but rogues and scoundrels.
it's just my luck, I finally have a shot at being a star and there's nowhere on earth I can shine.
my mother wouldn't be able to show her face at the club again which, almost makes it worth it.
Oh come on, the movies about to start.
Cary Grant as a bad guy, I just can't fathom it.
you'd be surprised what hides behind a good suit and nice manners.
looking for someone.
just keeping tabs.
you did very good work today.
rumor has it Mr. Hollywood is looking for a girl to feature in his news reel.
I'm hardly the type of girl they want for those things Mrs. Corbett,
which is fine by me.
seems a shame.
your the best worker we have.
upstairs now.
I shoulda known. Did you come lookin for me?
I'm here to see the girls are suitably chaperoned, that's my job.
this is just a lark for you isn't it?
I was just distracting myself Lorna. Truth is...
I will not be played for a fool Mr. Moretti.
seeing the film, all I could think of was James and that floosie.
watching Joan fontain almost die because she didn't have the courage to confront Cary Grant,
I couldn't help but think I'm doing the same thing. What in blazes are you talking about.
tonight's movie, Hitchcocks " Suspicion
were you watching it at all? I went outside to smoke, often.
I'm just like Joan fontain, living in my wild imaginings.
so talk to your fiancee Gladys, and straighten things out.
lets just say if we start throwing back the curtains I'm going to be the one with the sun in my eyes.
you got somin' to hide?
Gladys, aren't you the dark horse. Another man.
it was so foolish.
and a few other things too by the sound of it.
I didn't go all the way, what kind of a girl do you think I am?
tryin' to figure that out.
it's time to pay your fiancee a visit.
I'd tell you how late it is but I'd wager the neighbours already have.
I saw "suspicion" tonight.
Joan fontain marries Cary Grant.
he's a complete charmer who turns out to be a cows rake.
he gambles... drinks, betrays his friends.
it's hard to imagine Cary Grant as a cad.
he's good at it, surprisingly so.
he does such awful things his wife wonders if he ever truly loved her.
go on, your saving me 25 cents.
and Joan... she loves him so much.
Gladys whats wrong?
I'm an open book darling.
it seems another girls been thumbing the pages.
do you love her? I don't know who you mean.
please don't lie, it'll only hurt worse.
why would you do this?
why would you risk everything if you don't love her? It's not gonna happen again.
and I'm supposed to believe you. Yes!!
and digging this up, your making a mistake.
I guess I'm allowed a few.
lets not wake the neighbours.
Goodnight.
well what are we going to do, have all the girls try these on like cinderellas slipper.
we can't chaperone them every minute.
we could write up some rules, an employee code of conduct.
for gods sake I'll put some rubbers in the mens room.
this news reel's going to attract hundreds of new workers.
vulnerable girls, far from home,
without rules that's, it's a recipe for disaster.
you can't fight human nature Lorna.
we can certainly try.
your blood work shows no remaining infection, so this is our last treatment.
we've seen good results.
but in the future you may want to make use of prophylactics.
while they diminish pleasure they also eliminate pain, here, after wards.
you're an educated man Mr. Dunn yet, here we are.
trousers.
apologies.
this was some idiotic attempt to prepare myself for my wedding night.
you feel the man should be more experienced.
I expect my fiancee will appreciate it when the time comes.
well, young women these days can be more sophisticated than you think.
not Gladys, she's an innocent.
I tell you Gladys witham's our girl, what, a socialite working the bomb line, it's hollwood perfect, plus she's a stunner.
working here Harold your a lucky man.
I'm not certain she wants the job.
yeah well if she wants to work here she'll do her patriotic duty.
well that' settled now lets talk about the schedule, I suggest we start today.
Gladys is a wonderful choice.
there it is, a ringing endorsement.
of course I practically have to say that because she's my best friend.
Gladys is terrifically sincere it's just that she might put off a working girl.
she is a little on her high horse. I found her approachable.
just because you'd like to get her out of that uniform and into your little movie, doesn't mean the average girl will see her and think "that's me
madam I've been making news reels since Hitler strolled through the sudatanland okay,
I know how to sell this war.
to men... maybe!!
she's right, as much as it pains me I've got to stop you here Russell.
their our target audience, this time we listen to the ladies.
I expect you have a suggestion... matron.
miss Andrews, get outa here.
so I'm not the best singer in the world but hey, that's no reason to throw me the cold shoulder.
do you think your singing's the reason I won't talk with you?
no I think it's because I'm not...
like you and I'm just telling you,
I don't give a hoot.
truth is I can't be seen with someone who... .
sings from her neck.
that's where my throat is. But that ain't where the song is,
your keeping it trapped in that little box up there
when the feeling comes from here.
and your power from here.
Leon!!! I asked you to oversee clean up.
yes sir, spick and span.
it's awful, the things folks get up to down here.
I managed to choke out Hazel's name and James insisted it was over, then I ran, before the walls caved in.
did you tell him about your airman? I couldn't, it's a double standard.
men get to bring the bride home to dear old mom, and then run around back with a no account factory girl.
and if we do the same thing?
me?
your the one they chose.
you'll be a role model Betty
if we want good workers we need to show them what one looks like.
your the victory munitions girl? It's the perfect choice.
how fun, they'll film you on Sunday and before you know it you'll be on the silver screen.
you wait Betty, their gonna see what I see, a hero.
go ahead with your code of conduct.
that's wonderful. Just a brochure kinda thing.
all the do's and don'ts.
who should I get to write it? Well you.
sir I'm no writer.
yeah but you did marry young and I'm sure you know a lot about the pitfalls of budding love.
now I warn you,
I gotta say I sweated it a bit.
no, I'd say it's a fine trade.
those are beautiful.
I paint some toys for a couple of shops up town. Your kids must have loved that growing up.
they got the ones that didn't turn out right.
well your giving my skip and Daphne a real gift, with those letters.
they say it's like having their daddy back home with them.
I gotta tell you Mrs. Mccallum it doesn't sit well with me some days.
I mean it seems kinda cruel to keep pretending that their father is alive.
telling them the truth I... .
well if I'm going to write to them it would help if I knew what they like.
lately... kites at Willow park.
skip likes to pretend it's his daddy up there flying.
what a day, all I asked from management was set down some simple rules to keep the girls outa trouble and old snaky Aitkins has me writing it.
Edith. Lorna, hello.
she brought supper.
that was very thoughtful of you Edith.
no I'm not that hungry.
can we just leave.
not if we want reverend Fletcher for the wedding, he takes these lessons seriously.
will you?
you don't understand.
I know you must have felt something for Hazell.
or else why would you have been with her?
I met Hazell months ago. And what, she was your education?
in a manner of speaking.
why not come to me?
Gladys. Why, because I'm not that kind of girl.
Hazell McDougall gave you the clap!!!
I've taken a cure.
Gladys... Gladys You've never made a mistake.
I'm still a virgin if that's what your asking. Of course your still a virgin.
now I've supported you working in the factory and making new friends.
and you think I like that, no!! But I love you.
you can't cherry pick what suits you Gladys.
sure is strange being in here on a Sunday.
OK gals... gals hustle your cabooses into place here now remember never ever look at the camera. I'm gonna look, I just know I'm gonna look.
get a hold of yourself.
Rudi Valentino here has replaced the cordite with, with what is that string?
uncooked spaghetti sir.
that'll stop the place from exploding, right?
shut it smarty.
Betty, you look like movie star.
no I look like a clown.
you've got the whole system here backwards.
I've got shots to match killer, take a deep breath.
amazing how they take something fake and make it look like something real.
there's nothing real about turning our girls into sexpots.
all the more reason to have a code of conduct.
I give my draft to Mr. Aitkins today.
OK, stand by to do a take.
and action!!
that's it, that's it... ok now
that's it stuff that bomb like your slapping Hitlers face.
good, now smile like you love being here.
good, perfection, cut!!
OK, time for the close up.
now lets bring in that hand double.
your hands look nothing like mine.
that's the point killer. Alright roll camera.
kissing I can see, but holding hands. It's not appropriate work place behaviour.
you'll see the fine incurred is considerably smaller.
men rub up against the girls in the canteen line up.
I gotta say, this policy reads like the best bits of lady chatterley's lover.
we'll have to circulate your little publication in a plain brown wrapper.
I merely cataloged what happens here.
well you certainly done right by all the ways that men do wrong, but lets keep it simple Lorna.
lets focus on curtailing the uh private pursuits, storerooms, tunnels.
action, girls!
now give it your all killer!!!
this is for the news reels big capper.
more joy.
big smile.
Cuuut!!
cut cut. I feel like an idiot.
you are welcoming us into your home, it'll make sense in the edit.
I live in a rooming house. Yes and your little hovel wouldn't draw one girl out of a barn, we're selling the dream here.
that's you doll. Fix her lip stick could ya.
this whole thing is a cock up.
you'll see.
OK.
OK.
isn't it beautiful, imagine living here.
Yeah, I do... actually.
I've been saving for a place like this since I started working.
Why? That's what husbands are for.
didn't you ever want something of your own? We settled down some winters, shared rooms.
I just dream of a place of my own.
now thanks to the war I stand a chance of getting it.
maybe I should send a thank you card to Hitler.
course I'd need house mates, or at least one.
you're on.
places Betty, please.
I regret that your stuck behind the camera Miss Witham but the feeling was that you came off supra populi.
above the people.
you're quoting Latin and I'm the snob.
you could always lower your standards and debate this over a drink.
I'm still engaged Mr. Joseph. So I keep hearing.
you've gotta pull down on the string son, hard.
but I don't want it to crash. Go ahead son do what he tells you.
whoa mummy it's working, look.
if you give that kite a tug you tell it who's boss and it'll do your bidding.
well isn't this a surprise.
I hope lorna was okay with me dropping by, I did feel rather awkward.
she's fine, one less meal she's gotta make.
Where's your little girl?
Oh my neighbour and her little girl took her along to the pictures.
she's dying to see" Dumbo" The Skip here needs to run wild.
yeah my boys were the same. And how are they now?
your letters must be a real comfort to them.
I haven't written them yet.
I think he's got the hang of it.
you know I'm up most nights thinking of all the things I never told my husband.
don't wait Bob.
my daddy's in the war.
did you kill Germans too.
yes I did.
are you ready to talk to me now? We've done that.
all those nights at the lake railing against our parents, how we'd never be like them. We're not like them.
no?
flawlessly hostessing with a bottle for company.
people can't see that I'm American, that this is not my country's war.
they think I'm a coward.
an affair with hazel somehow proves that your not?
no, but it did make me feel like a man.
what if I were the one that strayed? That's different.
why should it be? What would you do?
don't make me answer that.
they were filming only a few days ago and they've already got a news reel.
if it takes too long it's not news right, it's history.
it's called "the directors cut,
they just bash it together, see what it looks like.
it's a great way to ring in the factory dance.
that's because alied firepower is unparalleled... and where do our munitions come from?
nice hands Edith.
from Betty the bomb girl and others like her who, in their way are tireless fighters in the battle for freedom.
rats I looked at the camera.
there's my back.
Betty works at victory munitions building bombs that will strafe enemy territory and win this war.
let's have you dress like that every day.
only six months ago she was pruning roses, now she just built the factories millionth bomb.
they gave me kids.
knowing she's done all she can to keep her precious darlings safe from Hitler
it's not just love of country that keeps Betty going, it's her love of a very special man.
he is alucky guy, Betty!
marry me Betty. Join this, and together we can win this fight.
produced and...
I never imagined they would do this.
shows you what a freak I am. they just make up a whole set of lies about me.
you listen to me Betty you are a skilled, hard working decent girl, and that's what women who watch this will see. That's what they'll wanna be.
nobody would want to be me Mrs. Corbett... Nobody
I thought you made news reel, not fairy tales.
I tell the story as people want to hear it, In this one you're the girl next door.
you're asking women to trust a lie.
look here killer, what women want is the lie, love, war the whole dammed thing. It's the lies that stitch it all together.
and I can tell from here you do your share every day.
ever take a night off?
the inks not dry. I'll be careful.
so many rules.
so many rule breakers.
rule number Five, men and women will occupy separate tables at the canteen.
the girls are uncomfortable is such close proximity.
do you really believe any of this?
we're fighting a war Mr. Moretti, people can't start losing their heads.
and I think you're fighting the wrong enemy.
nothing with people finding a little comfort, especially these days.
no doubt this war has been a lot of fun for you.
I've met some girls, but not as many as you'd think.
well victory girls always hit their targets.
I see your fiancee isn't about.
he's working.
a lie, there's hope for you yet.
what did he do? Betrayed me
isn't that what men do?
nobody's perfect, except maybe you.
does he know that?
girls these days... just too eager.
haven't figured that beauty's... in what a women hides.
sorry to drag you out of bed,
my rides still inside, on the floor.
what happened?
I'm fine James, it's not like I got sold into white slavery.
you're drunk, who did this?
nobody DID this, I came here with Russell. Who's " RUSSELL
and I met bohemians including his first and third wife, they're one and the same.
and I sipped Sazzeracks with the lady of the night, and I played strip poker.
you don't play poker.
which would explain why I lost. Get in the car.
that woman... his ex wife, you'd have said she was fallen
but she had more joy in her than I've ever known.
are you tellin' me that your unhappy?
you put me up on a pedestal James and when I fall
I'm gonna hurt something.
there's our little Gladiola.
yes he does, now what'd you do to her?
he was a perfect gentleman. I was very well behaved.
it's just that your little filly here was gaggin for a good time.
James, JAMES STOP IT!!!!
get in the car we're goin' home.
I'm so sorry. No I'm not.
that's a real modern marriage seminar.
I don't care what other people say I thought you were great.
except it wasn' me up there and everybody knew it.
so the director made a few things up, people just thought it was fun.
I looked like an idiot Kate.
did you see them laughing?
you wouldn't want to.
make so many things easier.
well look at you, you're here a month and already you fit right in.
stupid to think I could really do this.
you don't need everybody liking you, just the ones that matter.
I know your mother makes excuses for me, the truth is I was angry when you boys ran off to war, like everything I went through it counted for nothing.
you're late.
Now!!... you wrote them now!!!
what's wrong with writing my boys?
what's wrong is you waited too long Bob.
you're too dam late. Lorna what is the big tragedy here?
nothing I'm tired, I need to wash up.
I'm sorry.
a kite?
I spent all day in that factory breathing foul air, time to get up.
I've got ironing to do before shift. So do it tomorrow.
and shopping, you gonna run my errrands for me?
fine you win, it wasa stupid idea.
why are you doing this?
because it's a sunny day Lorna, It's a beautiful day and it might not be tomorrow.
thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
what are you doin'? Relax, I'm changing for work.
if I leave home with too little mother locks me up, if I get to work with too much, well I stand out.
so last night didn't inspire a change of career?
no, but I did decide something.
that treatment that cure your trouble Penicillin, the doctor assures me it's completly safe.
well I'd like you to get some more, for Hazell.
the doctor got you some medicine you can get some for her.
you see what I mean, you're too good.
I want you to see me across a room and waltz me into bed.
and when you get me there stop me talking.
yeah... Something like that.
drive me to the factory?
once more, once more!!
come on, let's get you ready for work.
here, hold the kite.
Lorna! No just do it!
got it?
ready? Ready.
son of a...
Lorna watch out!!!
babylon, 331BC 50 miles south of Baghdad 2339 years later
get down!
get down!
this sucks, man.
get down!
get down! Get down!
luck of the Devil himself.
try and think, Mum.
did anyone come here and ask you for your notebook?
cos if they didn't ask you, they stole it.
has, em...
has anyone been here asking about my mother's belongings?
or asking about me?
not that I know of, but your mother...
she wouldn't know even if they had, yeah.
I'm afraid not.
haven't you sold that thing yet?
Hey, babe.
you said we were going to France.
the Riviera.
you owe me, Jimmy.
Yeah,Well ,If i'm right about this thing,I'll buy you a house on the Riviera. How about that?
Oooh, I like that.
does it come with matching earrings?
get your paws off!
do you hear that? -What?
it sounded like gas escaping?
don't do that.
tooth picks.
4, 000 years ago the Egyptians were building cities of gold, the Greeks temples of marble.
what were we doing?
we were picking our teeth.
what about Stonehenge? -Stonehenge?
well, it's pretty impressive, isn't it?
a bit?
the Pantheon is impressive.
the pyramids at Giza, the Nabatean temples carved into the rock at Petra, they're impressive.
you want to compare these wonders to a rockery off the A303?!
here end of the lesson.
come on, let's get back to work.
come on, she tends to bite hardest on those she's most fond of.
then she must really love me.
I'm sorry. I'm trying, but it's not happening, Viv.
you don't give good "victim."
so, any more mysterious phone calls from anonymous men asking if I've received "packages"?
what did he sent you?
my mother's old notebook.
Really? Can I see it?
no.
and you're absolutely sure that you know nothing about the person who called?
No,Nothing, I swear.
OK, OK. You're not on trial.
you'll want to see this.
cultural delegation from Iraq.
doing the Grand Tour of our dismal wee island.
they're visiting the private Babylonian collection in Bath.
look at them.
government's latest poster campaign for the glorious new future.
doctors, Philosophers, Film directors, even a Child chess genius.
And?
and a doctor of archaeology turned peacemaking politician.
Oh, it's wonderful to back here, yes, I've been here a number of times.
no we hope to be able to place everything up.
Dr. Hammadi?
Rachel Highgrove, coordinating the visit from this end,You're late.
were you lost? -Only in thought.
Ah, very poetic ,but we must keep the delegation to the itinerary.
Dr.Hammadi!
Dr.Hammadi!
Allah uh Akbar.
can I tempt you to recite the talk you gave in Cairo on the Ishtar Gate?
it would coincide with the relaunch of my old DVD.
Oh, you may remember, when this arch was first installed here?
in which you describe Babylon as Alexander the Great's bisexual stop-off point.
well, one must have an angle, as the conqueror said to the catamite.
Kahmil! Behold the chess champion.
I feel a photo opportunity coming on. Would you come over here?
gather round please.
excuse me, mate，Ali!
no need for panic, everybody.
no need for panic, everybody, a slight fracas that's all.
she's a war orphan.
our Government had him assigned to protect her.
tell him we could do without the cultural histrionics.
I have to take this.
Beautiful。
so much history.
catalogue it.
archaeology - one part scrabbling around in the filth to ten parts book-keeping.
are we having fun yet?
we saw the saints coming back in the sun and dust.
Gregory. -You haven't aged a bit.
I bathe in asses milk.
and this is new intern, Viv Davis.
nice to meet you.
we were all students together.
Oh, well, 15 years ago? -A pleasure.
Kahmil needs our help.
here is one of many sad sights from modern Iraq。
a Hellenistic temple destroyed by mortar fire.
2, 000 years and now it's gone.
the bombs blow open the ground and bring new treasures to the surface, from when Iraq was Babylon and a wonder of the ancient world.
Yes，we were great once.
and of course the Baghdad Institute of Antiquities has an insidious enemy。
Night-? -Looters.
smuggling finds out of the country for private collectors.
excited by their American buster-browns!
now we've traced one of the nighthawkers back here.
we don't know his name.
what does he have to sell?
Oh, wow, a brick.
perhaps from the Hanging Gardens.
it's inscribed by the king who commissioned the building.
built by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.
Aw, come on. The Gardens are a myth.
he needs our help.
can I have a word with you, please?
excuse us.
Kahmil is loaded.
with his family connections he can sort out his own problems.
and if he's now this big peace-making politician why's he worrying about some brick?
if you ask me, he's got an ulterior motive.
well, maybe he just wanted to look up some old friends.
Oh, yeah I bet he was gagging to see me and Dolly.
Oh, come on, you used to value hooky gear.
you could look up a few old contacts.
Hey, I was a student.
I was broke, That was another time.
comes in here in his '90s suit and his gelled hair,He has gel!
you're jealous?
you and I split up, right, that's one thing.
my decision, given.
you were devastated, sorry!
but within six days... Six days and you are doing the fandango with him!
I was a kid, you'd dumped me, and he told me how well he could dance the fandango.
Oh, this is great A brick.
from the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon and you turn it into an episode of Hollyoaks!
so this is an academic decision?
Yes. -No.
the academic decision would be to focus on the dig we're being paid for.
neolithic toothpicks aren't glamorous but they pay the rent.
he doesn't!
this is fun.
check out the inscription.
Yes.
very good fun.
give you 200 for it, no more.
Ah! That's better... Babylonian.
4th century BC.
Tiamat, goddess of evil.
what a lovely bitch she is.
I could move this on to a German collector I know.
no questions asked. 15, 000.
I'm not done yet, Max.
I've never seen anything quite...
it's nice but my clients tend to prefer a little more, ahem, "bling."
job lot, 20K.
I'll give you the necklace and the brick, Max, but not this.
not at that price.
it's only a bit of old carved stone, Jimmy!
this is an ancient cuneiform script.
if you can't find the cash, I'll find another buyer.
so now you're reinvented in the world of politics, what are you trying to achieve back home?
later this week I will sit down in private with fundraisers for the Sunnis and Shiites.
I will be asking them to redirect their war-chests into unifying Iraq.
we must put an end to sectarian violence if we are to be a great nation again.
Yeah, well,good luck with that.
did you order food in?
cos it might take a while.
how long has Vivienne been working with you?
it's a temporary thing.
we don't really have the funds to keep an intern.
Oh, look, I've got it, I've got it.
dr .Colloway!
middle-eastern specialist.
Oh, but he only does Saracen stuff, first and second Crusades.
no, before he lost his college post he was writing a book on the sacking of Babylon by Alexander the Great.
well, thanks for everything.
what if you get caught in a compromising position?
such as?
such as beating the crap out of an antiquities thief.
is that likely?
you were always pretty quick with your fists.
we were kids, Ben.
the position I caught you and her in was distinctly adult.
well, then you shouldn't have let her go, should you?
Oi! What's wrong with you, girly?
me? Nothing.
well, do what you're best at and put the kettle on!
when they said archaeology was a science, I didn't know they meant domestic science.
that's it, this baby's going on the website, if Max won't pay, somebody will.
this Max Garris had better check out, Dr Colloway.
thanks for coming along.
you sure Scotland Yard have an Ancient Antiquities Division?
I'll bet they do.
anyway, it did the trick.
Max Garris, do you know him?
it doesn't ring any bells.
hopefully I can find an address from this name.
can I ask you something.
if you're organising your own little peace conference, then why are you wasting time chasing this brick?
one brick is how every city in the world begins.
Yeah, and many a mickle makes a muckle.
we get those Christmas crackers too.
we could find it for you.
in fact， I'd love to.
no, thank you again for everything, but I really must do this alone.
I'd love to, we could find it for you.
anyway it did the trick, Max Garris, do you know him?
I can find an address from this name.'
babylon, such a wealth of extraordinary history, and then Alexander ransacked it in 331 BC, uptight little bisexual.
of course he went on to rule just about everywhere.
including Babylon and its Hanging Gardens.
do you think Dr Hammadi was right?
about a brick from the Hanging Gardens?
well, my God, it would be a red letter day at Dolly Towers if it was true.
but I sense this isn't about some brick.
I sense he's after something else.
what, Gregory? -I don't know.
yet.
Amwar, it's your brother, I'm getting closer, I can feel it.
I have a name, Max Garris.
Gillian Magwilde is helping me.
where is she based out of again?
Wessex.
Yes. Right.
I feel bad keeping her in the dark.
first rule of business
keep everyone in the dark.
Yes, but this isn't business.
it's not even politics.
it's a matter of salvation.
you see that's when you start to worry me, little brother, when you start talking like a prophet.
did you get the messages that I sent you?
come back to New York.
but New York is not my home, Amwar.
I believe that Gillian thinks that I am looking for something more than a brick.
if the Tablet is half as important as you say it is, no-one can be trusted.
not even the wonderful Gillian Magwilde.
soon everyone will know what we have found.
Kahmil, even when we were kids you were the one with the wild stories.
you kept the family enthralled.
myths have their power but they can be used in many ways.
for now just see Gillian Magwilde in the same light, not to be trusted.
Kahmil comes from a prominent Baghdad family.
his brother is Iraq's answer to Rupert Murdoch.
media baron, lives in the States these days.
arab TV stations, websites, newspapers.
the Hammadis have incredible influence in both Sunni and Shiite worlds.
many think Kahmil should have a much higher place in the new Iraq.
think he's a lech?
did you see the way he was staring at me?
my dear, I beg to differ.
now, this is leching.
Gregory! Don't you dare!
no ,this.,What's this?
just some other stuff I found on Babylon.
apparently the latest evidence suggests there was a big meteorite crash in that region.
assyria.
four and a half thousand years ago.
is it important, then?
no, not to us.
but it might be to some.
Oooh, hive of activity I see.
Gilly. -Yes.
take this. -What is it?
I know this sort of development still matters to you.
you are still following the gleam, aren't you?
could meteoric iron have been used, to make...something else?
Hey-hey! Look at this!
is this yours Gregory?
Ah, indeed.
we were post-grads, uncovered a stockpile of Roman denari.
Oh, God，Hail, Caesar.
you were so thrilled.
I remember you hollering "Hail, Caesar!" at the top of your voice.
did he always take his shirt off?
can we just leave it?
Mrs Wilson, prepare to find your tabby swinging from his own entrails.
here, puss，Here, sweetie.
come to me, you little...
that's the way.
come to me,Come on.
a meteorite crashes in Assyria.
2, 000 years later, Alexander is in Assyria.
is it possible?
is this where it started?
is this where it was made?
Alexander's was the destiny of men.
in his sword and shield.
the stars gave him his weapon.
the stars.
the answer must lie in the stars!
or am I getting as mad as you, Mother?
gill, it's Kahmil, I need you to come to Max Garris's place now.
Oh, my God...
what happened?
he was like that when I got here.
what did this to him?
it's like he's been bitten by something.
look, I shouldn't have called you, it's not fair.
are you looking for the brick?
do you think it's still here?
no-one will know you were here.
what are you so desperate to find?
I have seen this before in Baghdad, Occultists.
if this was a robbery then why not take this?
it's solid gold!
look, it's not about the necklace and it's not about the damn brick!
I am here for something so important...
so important a man has died over it!
I'm not going to go away until you tell me what the bloody hell it is you're looking for!
do you see these?
Babylon had street lighting when your ancestors were still running around in bear-skins.
you know, we were the first people to irrigate our land.
to map the stars and name them.
we created the alphabet!
the days of your week are taken from our days.
we were the cradle of civilization!
and look at us now.
Ravaged,Burning, Dismayed.
what am I looking for?
I am looking for hope.
the hope of a nation to be great again.
and peace throughout the land?
ten out of ten for ambition.
no, English.
I need to do practice.
I like puzzles.
me too.
my mum used to set me puzzles to solve.
that's why I love history so much.
because it's a puzzle with lots of clues to find.
my mother is dead.
well, I'm very sorry about that.
I hear her voice.
I hear my mother's voice too.
I beat a Russian man at chess.
I made him cry.
result.
good night. - Good night, sweetheart.
good night, heavenly princess Khanna.
thank you, Gillian, but this is one puzzle you cannot solve.
I want to help you.
then leave.
before being with me gets you hurt.
Taxi!
the followers of Tiamat are here!
they killed a man!
fanatics. This is too dangerous.
Tiamat is a dark force with a long, dark history.
if these people really worship Tiamat they'll stop at nothing.
I will not be intimidated by superstition and occultists!
you don't have to be intimidated, they'll do all the work.
they'll kill!
your credibility as a political figure will seriously be undermined with these crackpots on your tail.
I can't stop now!
this is our country's future!
Kahmil, come home.
you're in New York.
well, I try to call it home.
I can't leave this to Gillian.
I know her...
she won't give up.
ms Highgrove represents the interests of the Iraqi delegation.
what is your association with Dr Kahmil Hammadi?
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Gillian Magwilde and you are in my lab.
Rachel Highgrove, Nice to meet you.
what is your association?
I was at university with him, er, we had sex.
twice. In 1992.
twice?!
once is never quite enough.
may I have a word in private?
twice?
Kahmil's an important man from an important family.
many people think his obsession with these ancient objects is just going to drag Iraq back into the medieval quagmire.
but what is it he's looking for?
I don't know.
or you won't say.
who killed Max Garris? Cultists?
maybe.
it's happened before in Baghdad.
you don't need to worry about Max Garris. It's a diplomacy issue.
our people can handle it.
look, I'm just trying to help Kahmil, he's a friend.
no, he was your friend twice in 1992.
we'll look after Dr Hammadi, you dig up your medieval buckets.
right. Yes, well ，I have a "bucket" waiting in the lab right now.
so I'd best get back to it.
Tiamat, the serpent who would enslave the world.
what is that?
do you know what, you used to be fun.
my god, it's beautiful.
Babylonian for certain.
Kahmil's after something else.
something much more important.
than this?
I think the contents of this box is what he's after, and that's why Garris was killed.
but he won't tell you what it is.
he doesn't want to draw attention.
they're interviewing the whole Iraqi delegation over Max Garris' death.
they're talking about cultists, says here that when Kahmil starts promoting Iraq's Babylonian inheritance, it draws out all these wackos who follow Tiamat.
Tiamat, that's like the...
that's like Babylonian devil-worshippers, innit?
I love it!
Tiamat!
Oops, I've set him off.
in Babylonian mythology there was Marduk, the god of goodness.
and the goddess of evil was Tiamat.
a giant serpent.
that's what this is.
and I would say Dr Hammadi is searching for something of great importance that has drawn out forces of darkness who are trying to stop him.
Babylonian legend says that the god Marduk took on human form and slayed the evil serpent God Tiamat and ruled over the Earth.
then Marduk dictated stone writings that told of his deeds, but also predicted the future.
how do we know? 《The Enuma Elish.》
ancient scriptures detailing the history of Babylonian gods.
it tells us of a tablet that has never been depicted.
the holy writings of a Babylonian god. Well?
sorry, I'm just trying to get my eyebrow to raise cynically.
no, no, Gilly, this is what our boy is after.
prophesies of a god.
he always liked to think big.
and you know, where there are gods there are always devils.
I'm sure we can come to some agreement, Jimmy, but the price has dropped, 'it's three, not five...'
three? Three.
Jesus Christ, man, I just came down to five.
it's all we can do, Jimmy, I'm sorry.
call me if you change your friggin' mind!
our looter found the Tablet Of Destinies?
the Tablet was hidden after Alexander entered Babylon.
it was supposed to have predicted many troubles.
the closest comparison I can make is that the Tablet Of Destinies is a Babylonian Ten Commandments.
this would be the greatest Babylonian artefact of all time.
no wonder Kahmil lied to us, he's after glory.
don't be so ridiculous!
if anything, he was trying to protect us.
from the cultists? -Or from himself.
you have to go.
not until we find the Tablet Of Destinies.
Kahmil, this is amazing.
it was put on the web anonymously.
he put these pictures up to attract buyers, I'm sure of it.
now, I have analysed every Cuneiform symbol I can see.
this thing talks of the rise of a tyrant from Tikrit.
saddam! It talks about the invasion from the West.
the Gulf War.，It gives dates, it's.
it's incredible, Gilly!
you can't really believe this is a genuine prophecy?
a person is supposed to rise at this time, our time, called "The Gate."
he will reunite the country.
I believe the other side of the tablet reveals who the gate is.
is this why you've been hosting peace talks?
that you will reunite Iraq?
do you get to wear a cape and a mask?
it's about hope.
our country has been raped and beaten into submission.
by Saddam,By the West,By insurgents.
this tells us who we were and who we can be again.
Kahmil, this is arcane stuff.
you want a modern Iraq. -I want a proud lraq.
my brother controls the media.
we have connections to both Sunnis and Shiites.
maybe, just maybe, people will believe these writings and that things can get better.
you'll get a nation of Muslims to follow the god Marduk?
Marduk? Yahweh? Allah?
there are so many different names but it all boils down to one God.
one hope, one chance, a unified Iraq.
Alexander's army was exhausted.
suffering from heat-stroke and the injuries of battle.
but this beautiful young god inspired them to march double-time across the desert, following him.
I don't believe it.
shout, "Damn that woman!" Expunge the bile!
she's not answering her phone.
go on, expunge!
I'd let her get on with it，She reckons she's so right all the time.
both of you ，Damn that woman!
if she's with him, then her life is at risk.
these photographs we found at Max Garris.
it makes sense that coming from Iraq they were taken by a photo-journalist.
Yeah.
these digital frame stock numbers, well, they'd be registered.
Reuters?
reuters, on their website.
if we can find a match then we'll get the name of the person who still has the Tablet.
here we go.
look.
Jimmy Paul, freelance photographer.
that's it, we have to stop the tablet getting .
what was that?
we've got a clear path to the door.
no, we'd be dead before we reached halfway.
get back inside, there's a killer snake on the loose!
I see you're in a hotel room with him.
not now!
no sudden moves.
so what do we do, stand here till it dies of boredom?
rudyard Kipling's gardener did it with a rake.
why don't you just kill it?
I'm a nature-lover.
we found out who's got the Tablet of Destinies.
right then, let's go.
Cleve Farm.
this is the contact address on the website.
look at this!
no!!
hang on a second, why have an all-singing, all-dancing electric oven installed and then boil a kettle on a butane stove?
Oh, my god, it's real.
please, please! Can I?
this section here was not on the photographs.
we must decipher it.
OK, now what happens is you give it back to me.
it was never yours.
look, mate, you stole it first, we steal it second.
call it quits, you can keep the box.
sorry, "mate."
what the.
quick!
come on, baby.
look! What the hell's he doing here?
he works for our Government.
he's been following me since I got here.
did you check his bag for snakes?
ali could be working for the cultists.
what, and he's in charge of the little girl?
little girl?
what little girl?
Kahmil， OK.，Let's go.
there's a little girl now?
Where's Ali? What's happening?
we need to get you somewhere safe, sweetheart.
ali is protecting me!
he keeps me safe!
we'll take her back to the university.
but Ali's my friend!
he said not to trust anyone!
least of all Ali.
when I meet Tiamat, I'll give her your best...
sir, it's me，Do you have it?
no, they're heading back to the city.
this is all so damn surreal...
look, I think you should just tell him, sir, before he winds up dead.
this doesn't make sense.
part of the inscription isn't in cuneiform.
is this thing really supposed to bring peace?
if it inspires my countrymen as it has inspired me, then yes.
it's brought precious little peace so far, hasn't it?
can we just get back to the lab?
look at it!
it's not every day you get to look upon writings dictated by a god.
right, let's clean it using low grade acid and then take a scan for a 3D model.
it gives a time when the gate will be revealed to the people...
talks of them walking through the gate with their new future.
but this side of the tablet I can't make out, it looks like some kind of code.
we should call the police.
we are in way over our heads.
but that would just undermine Kahmil further.
you don't really believe Iraq's answers lie here, do you?
his belief in this Babylonian prophecy is never going to be taken seriously, in Iraq or in the West.
you like him?
he talks about my country, but really he's talking about himself.
and these markings are so rare, they have yet to be deciphered...'
it's the same.
what's the same?
those squares on the statue.
they are like...that.
so the decipher mechanism for this code is etched into the base of a palace gate.
maybe it was hidden on all the royal gates.
now we have a problem, gaining access to these markings.
that's the main atrium of the museum. Not a problem.
the markings are partially clogged with stone fragments.
we'll need to clean that with low-grade acid or masonry bits.
Plus, we don't know how the cipher works.
I can do it.
maybe you can.
OK, so assuming no-one's brought their Invisibility Cloak with them, how are we supposed to excavate in a public museum without anyone noticing?
.Professor Mastiff is an acclaimed expert on Babylonian culture.
his DVD film on the fall of the city to Alexander has been re-released and I...I suddenly thought this was a good time to highlight not only his documentary, but also my personal mission to see greater cultural understanding between our two nations.
of course, all this is just a bit of fun.
the DVD points to a greater cooperation between the Baghdad Institute and British academics who wish to bring its treasures to a wider public.
and it's still at the special offer price of ?? 6. 99.
and to celebrate Anglo-Iraqi relations, the mayor will be holding a civic reception here tonight, before the delegation leave tomorrow.
are there any questions? -Arsenal.
I'm here in case the press want a little tour of the relics.
if they do come through, would you be across the security in a supervisory capacity?
I can spot a military man.
excellent.
??
for Kahmil? Iraq?
ourselves?
why go after toothpicks and medieval pots when you can go after prophecies written by ancient gods, eh?
??
now let's get out of here before Mastiff rides through those doors on his sodding chariot.
so, these are the missing symbols from the arch in the museum.
wow, well, it all joins up.
but what does it mean?
it's a puzzle. I am good at puzzles.
it's easy!
Oh my God.
arrows.
but what are the arrows pointing to?
no, they're only there to line up the code.
this is the cryptic code found on the tablet, and this, the section found on the stone arch in the museum.
when they have their new position, the words are in a new order, revealing a new text.
we've cracked it.
these are the words highlighted.
no, this is all wrong, we have to start again.
Viv, I need the toilet. -Sure.
I'll take you.
you bastard! She's just a baby!
Five，Four.，Three.
do you want to go to a party with Aunt Rachel?
Kahmil, whose identity is on that thing?
we need to go. Khanna and I.
we need to go right now.
no, no, no, not until you tell...
he's taken her!
we might still catch them.
where is she?
it wasn't him!
it was a white guy took Khanna!
the one that came with Rachel Highgrove.
ask him why he was at the caravan.
I protect Khanna!
I protect everyone!
you dangerous, that's why I followed you!
he didn't want your search to endanger the delegation.
that's why he's been tailing you.
you are dangerous to us.
don't be crazy.
no, no, he's right.
you pulled us into this based on your arrogant obsession.
don't take your eyes off him.
we're going to gatecrash Ms Highgrove's party at the museum.
you don't know what's at stake.
Kahmil, it's OK.
you don't know what I know.
the gate is Khanna.
now, I am leaving here alone, with the Tablet. I know what I have to do.
it's Dr Hammadi, I'm outside.'
I'll be right out.
I knew you'd understand what needs to be done.
may I, please, Doctor?
she's fine.
but if you don't hand over that wretched thing, who knows?
now what happens is you join the party and you tell everybody that you got caught up in a wild goose chase for a silly mythical artefact.
you realise in so doing you have belittled the contemporary political purpose of this visit.
who are you working for?
shall we?
please tell me that's not his phone.
he dropped it， I picked it up.
there's a message on here from his brother.
so what?
what?
it needs a security code word.
you should have known better, Gilly.
Kahmil was always arrogant, could always twist you round his little finger.
people change.
sometimes not that much.
pack that in, you little bitch!
now, we are gonna wait upstairs, well out of the way.
and if you're good, we'll play cards.
do you like cards?
we're going to break the news to Kahmil and get the tablet back.
hang on.
no.
surely she would never be that...
.stupid.
turns out she is.
Dr.Hammadi has been involved in the hunt for a spurious stolen artefact.
his actions have, as they have in the past, done nothing except provoke violence.
rather than inspire, Dr Hammadi has undermined Iraq and reminded us all that it can still be a country living in the Dark Ages.
doctor, would you make your statement now?
Dr. Hammadi's a crackpot obsessed with ancient curses and magic prophesies.
heavy stuff there, Rachel.
be warned, Doctor, you're on thin ice.
I live on thin ice, love.
I listened to your brother, Kahmil.
he likes to speak to you from on high, doesn't he?
I have painful news for you, my brother,
I did everything in my power to stop you from your quest.
you paid no heed to my warnings or to the occultist 'attacks that Rachel Highgrove stage-managed to frighten you away.
we have to talk, Kahmil, before any more die.
I have powerful reasons why it is best for the tablet to remain buried.
he set up these ritualistic attacks.
to so totally undermine you that your Sunni-Shia peace conference would be ruined.
he doesn't want a strong Iraq at all.
he doesn't want his Western interests disrupted.
he doesn't want his people to have hope.
it's bad for business.
WESTERN business.
the business he's invested in.
he set it all up, didn't he?
belittling your validity and the importance of the tablet.
the tablet was going to be your guiding light at the peace table.
you know, he's not the first to be scared.
there are records that show that Alexander's men found the Tablet of Destinies, but Alexander knew that it offered the Babylonians hope.
and the people with hope can rise up.
he didn't want his rule threatened, so he had the tablet taken back to its hiding place.
do you think your brother and his friends in the States really want everything to change?
Dr.Hammadi has brought this...this shame upon himself.
and he will be making a formal statement...to that effect.
my own brother would see me shamed and ruined, all to keep Iraq lowly and to preserve his business interests?!
whatever is written on this thing, it will either happen or it won't.
my little brother went in search of hope and found you.
a shame for both of you.
let's get it in the car.
ms Highgrove wants her...
we need to get her out of here!
wait!
wait.
bring me back Khanna or I will be forced to shoot you.
I'm sorry. -No!
why do people not want us to have hope?
Amwar? You're here!
Amwar, what are you doing?
stop, stop!
Oh, God, let her go.
please! Don't.
why, Amwar? Why?
not superstition.
not more beliefs.
they? Aren't you an Iraqi too?
you plan to do what Alexander did?
extinguish a nation's hope?
it can't be done.
one gate will close and another will open.
I mean, you are greedy, Mr Hammadi, and supremely manipulative and unimaginably selfish.
but you're not a child-killer.
are you so intent on going to hell?
hell?
Ah, Gillian!
I think we have a claim to hold onto the Tablet for a few months.
will you back me up?
no, but thanks for thinking of me.
we are going to tell all sides that there was once a prophecy about our country.
and it had a happy ending.
do you think a little girl really can help a whole country?
it's a puzzle. I am good at puzzles.
are you ok?
I'm sorry I stared when we first met but it was obvious to me.
I know， And you do too, don't you?
go well.
you too.
look, mate, you're loaded.
you could live anywhere in the world.
but you choose to live there.
and you choose to work with Gillian Magwilde.
which one of us is the bravest?
Bye, then.
that bumf about the meteorite in Assyria.
any help to you?
Yeah, maybe.
it may be the breakthrough your mother never had.
Oh, Dolly, why would I follow my mum's obsessions?
it was all madness, wasn't it?
of course.
come on, keys, come to Gilly.
very funny, Dolly.
I would love to talk to you.
by the way, I'm next door.
Hello?
Dolly, is that you?
because it's been a long day and I'm not in the bloody mood.
I should warn you, I've got an Etruscan spear in my hand and I'm not afraid to use it.
look at this.
first World War, Mark One.
I think it's been buried.
clear the area!
run, run!
Oh ,my God.
No! Marmite.
they're Germans, doesn't have to make sense.
the man on the right...
is that body there.
this isn't just a war grave, It's a war crime.
we've all got them.
these men were obsessed with Joan of Arc.
dr Magwilde, I need to have access.
hell of a thing, being around you.
I'm a hell of a ride.
between the hospice and the playground,Oh, God, you can see it in his eyes - jobsworth.
he'll be on our backs like a rutting grizzly.
on the up-side, there's a decent pub opposite.
so that's lunch sorted.
morning. - Morning.
this is what we found.
be reasonable, gents, we're putting up homes for people, now.
that matters more than a bit of history.
do you know what history is? It's layers.
the Romans make a layer.
the Saxons, medievals, Georgians, Victorians, your mum, my mum.
but these days layers require forms to show you're not building upon previous layers.
so we have to take a peek at the layers.
the layers. - And if there's nothing down there?
there's always something there.
we have a mystery.
Dirham. 14th century.
what the hell's a Middle Eastern coin doing in a park in Somerset?
so, what do you want to do, Gillian?
well, we have a medieval riddle to solve.
so we start digging.
Cheers.
excuse me, excuse me, - can you not, can you not do that, please? - What?
either get in the trench or stand away, but don't teeter on the edge, it erodes the section edge.
what are you, one of the Year 2s? - I'm Vivienne Davis.
I applied? - 0h, yes, yeah, gotcha.
nice to meet you, Vivienne.
Viv. just Viv.
we found evidence of military equipment, right here, and we've no idea whether it's a sword-smithy or even a battle.
map regression dates back to the 13th century and there's nothing to suggest a battle was fought here.
faith is a virtue.
faith is the gunpowder of humanity.
sack God, replace him with the Tooth Fairy, I say.
Viv, Professor Gregory Parton.
think of him as Google with a beer-gut.
call me Dolly. - Well, hello Dolly!
nice smile, inspirational chest.
Post-grad? - Durham.
I'm gonna leave old Durham town.
builders found it.
that's why we were called.
assigned to the Sultan of Mamluk.
the Mamluk Turks occupied jerusalem when the Christians were kicked out in 1291, when the Crusades went tits up.
what's it doing here?
we have no idea.
but the answer lies under that ground.
who's that trip-trapping over my bridge?
the witch of Arthurian legend.
damascene steel.
sword metal.
found beside Saracen coinage?
but they couldn't have been fighting Saracens here!
that's just nuts!
come on, give up your secrets.
Grub's up, my darling.
I've got the data!
it's right there!
they're people!
Bodies，under there.
better sink another trench, then.
everyone, come and check this out.
Oh, my God.
you beauties.
hacked to death!
they were hacked to death!
bloody gorgeous! - So who were they?
use your archaeological imagination.
this wasn't a couple of peasants having a scrap over a bit of skirt.
no, It appears to be a skirmish between professional soldiers and the Turks!
here in the heart of England. - 2, 000 miles away from the Crusades.
there's no record of any battles here between the Roman occupation and Cromwell.
he's right,This is re-writing-the-books stuff.
we have to show our faces at that faculty thing. - Pull a sickie.
I'll have the finds packed up.
we can get straight back. - Can you give me something to do,Dr.Magwilde?
I can help. - Vivienne, pretty young intern person.
when I'm impressed with you, I will ask for your help.
now, I have to go and put on a frock.
Tanya can show you how we catalogue.
it's a variation on Pitt Rivers， Techniques of Classification. - And Typology.
you got it. Everything packed in acid-free tissue.
you OK?
how am I going to impress her?
you'll think of something.
we all had to.
as your new Head of Archaeology, can I balance an academic commitment with being a media sensation?
there are benefits, 2% of profits from my latest book will be ploughed directly into this department!
one drink and we're leaving.
patients can't stop talking about it.
it's exciting.
are they really soldiers? - Either stand in the site or away from it, but not on the edge.
sorry. - Sorry.
I'm Helena. I work at the hospice.
Anyway.Sorry.
look at this.
soldiers put nails in the soles to get a better grip in battle.
see?
is that the other sandal there?
do you want to give me a hand? - Yeah,
OK. after three.
one, two, three.
look at your finger.
It'sjust a splinter.
thank you so much for coming. - Thank you.
get yourself a manicure. - I can't help it, Denn?
I'm just a grubby wee digger.
Yes, what is it you've found that the local hacks are buzzing about?
medieval soldiers. Slain in combat.
Yes, well, with military finds best to start with weapon identification.
analyse your sword sections.
well, with your permission, I'll get on it now.
well, take a copy of the book.
sex Rites 0f The Ancients, Nice title.
from Aztec nuptials to the virgin molestations of Caligula.
antiquity with titties and front-bottoms.
I read your last one, Napoleon Goes A-Bonking.
I merely outline a common truth, that history runs on the twin motors of human behaviour - sex and greed.
you're not shy in splashing yourself about.
not for money,Daniel?
there's a name for someone who does that.
your mother would never have exchanged such cheap barbs.
too sure of her brilliance.
how is she? Any change?
so can we go now? - Yes.
he's gotten to you already?
is that a record?
come on.
well, I hate to say it, but Mastiff was right.
now, look at that hilt, it's not from Europe at all.
well, that makes sense because a European broad sword could not administer that wound.
no, and I printed up a list of possibilities, look.
middle Eastern scimitar. - In the middle ofthe English countryside?
that doesn't make any sense at all.
hold the front page.
I've got the carbon-14 dating on the bone collagen.
our soldiers fell between 1300 and 1320.
Oh, this is more like it.
the ionisation from the chain-mail preserved it.
looks like your classic Z-spun medieval cotton.
let's clean it up and see what it looks like under UV.
looks like we've found the identity of our guys.
knights Templar.
James, if you want to get better, then you need to keep drinking.
come on, stay in bed until the temperature comes down.
come on.
when we were little boys, Colm.
what did the Brothers tell us?
that our founders were betrayed by those they had protected. - That our temple founders were butchered.
butchered by the enemies of Christ.
I've just been down the court house.
brother Laygass has been acquitted.
mr Laygass, - Yeah?
will Ofcom choose to close down your TV show?
well, I go out on a niche Christian channel so. .
you've been denounced by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
you said that this country is now at war for its Christian soul.
well, what I've said is that the day is coming when St Paul's Cathedral will be the Grand Mosque of London, yes.
but do your supporters advocate violence against non-Christians?
you are missing the use ofthe simile in one of my favourite hymns.
onward Christian soldiers, marching AS to war.
with the Cross of jesus going on before.
what about the allegations linking you with the recent hate crimes against Muslims?
any comment?
are we talking about THE Knights Templar?
Yeah, the Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ.
warrior monks charged with safe-guarding pilgrims on their way to jerusalem.
they were a monastic order, built hospitals and schools, but they were also the Church's SAS troops.
soldiering elite ofthe Crusades.
not to mention the mass slaughterers of countless Muslims.
two knights on the same horse.
poverty as a badge of honour.
our knights date back to the early 1300s.
that's when the Church turned against them, right?
the young lady with the proceleusmatic bosom is right.
the Templars were deemed too radical.
king Phillip of France outlawed them in 1307.
the arrests began on Friday the 13th. Hence that date is unlucky.
write it down.
impress your friends at parties.
so, our knights escape France.
they come to England.
but they're ambushed.
by Saracens, if you believe the coins, but that's patently craz.
I think they had a wooden cart or something with them.
I found this.
no, they were sworn to poverty.
even carts were a luxury.
what kind of wood is this?
I can tell you what it's not.
it's not sycamore or oak, or ash.
let's do dendrochronology on it.
dr Magwilde.
have you found the Templar Knights?
who is this?
I've been looking for them too.
a long time.
identify yourself, creepy caller.
and what about their precious cargo?
I don't know what you're talking about.
do you pray, Dr.Magwilde?
funnily enough I'm praying now, that you would bog.
hallelujah, it worked.
in my father's house there are many mansions.
Jesus, please be with jack at this time of his passing from the world.
lay your hand on him, Lord.
you who died for our sins, have mercy on this man.
be alongside him.
comfort him in his pain, for you know pain, Lord.
you who hung on a hill,and bled for the sake often world.
one of our pert little third-years pulled this out.
it definitely belonged to a Grandmontine.
well, the Grandmontine monks were the chroniclers ofthe Templar, so there's a good chance one was travelling with them when they were attacked.
why has he carved a snake and a sword on the back?
look how this seems to have been snapped, as though it were yanked from his neck by force.
So,Europe turns against the Knights, a small band flee France, and wind up here.
they head north, looking for a Templar church as refuge.
a Grandmontine monk is travelling with them and they're attacked by Saracens.
which is patently absurd.
what if the knights brought something from France?
a precious cargo.
and they're killed for this cargo.
the only thing precious to the Knights Templar were spiritual relics from the Holy Land.
what if jesus could be proved?
that would light a fire in all our hearts.
even in those who had no faith.
in my Father's house, there are many mansions, so said jesus.
wouldn't those mansions soon be filled with Christian souls?
the believers would drive out those who did not follow the truth, just as we did a long time ago.
when the call comes, I will be ready.
tea's up.
fantastic. - Biccies?
I'm so glad I've got a degree - Rich Tea or bourbons? - Never ceases to amaze me, all these centuries of bloodshed in the name of religion.
it's not always like that.
the nastier stuff always leaves a bigger impact on history, that's not how God works.
you were presumably brainwashed by God-bothering parents.
no.
I didn't know my parents.
but holy wars, Crusades...
it's the big stuff.
I always thought God was found in the quiet corners, in the little things.
in the little things,I like that.
right, are you ready for this?
first off, wood type is cedar.
Cedar?! - That takes it out of Europe.
the pattern of rings puts it at 32AD.
2, 000 years ago.
I found a match.
gundelia.
found in Syria, jordan, Israel.
the Holy Land, anyone?
a piece of 2, 000-year-old wood from the Holy Land.
carried by the Knights Templar, who were entrusted with Christian relics from jerusalem.
but that isn't the best bit.
there's organic residue in the wood, soaked in.
like blood.
mixed with metal traces.
OK. Gently, Bentley.
let's not get carried away.
I'm not getting carried away.
I'm telling you what I found.
evidence that 2, 000 years ago, someone may have been lacerated with a metal nail and bled into this wood.
we're under pressure for the construction company.
they want us to seal off the find, protect the site with concrete and let them build.
there could be something highly significant still down there.
as well as cedar wood?
0h, but you don't know if this is part of a cross-beam of a Roman-built crucifix.
we're walking geo-phys across that site looking for the rest.
there is another factor. Another potential buyer for the site.
someone who won't build on it, but has an interest in preserving it.
who?
do you in all seriousness believe that you have found part of the Cross of jesus Christ?
Daniel, look, let us walk out the site, sink another trench.
hold the developers and whoever else at bay for now.
please.
I've had word from Brother Laygass.
there's a dig happening in he West Country. Soldiers, medieval.
the location -it's the secret road from the coast.
we have to get word to the others.
be prepared.
for what? - For war.
so ,Mastiff said that you asked for a placement here and nowhere else.
this is where it's all happening.
you had the pick ofthe crop,Why here?
pin on a map.
OK, don't tell me.
but I hope you like getting into trouble, because Gregory's right about religious faith, it is the gunpowder of humanity.
if we do find what we think we may have found, then every zealot, crackpot and fanatic will be down on our dig site like a tonne of bricks.
what has happened to our Christian identity?
has it been eroded, or have we sold the Lord down the river to appease an ever broader stream of spiritual aliens?
no, you see, I'm looking for Monastic writings pertaining to the Templar exile from Europe.
the Grandmontines, yes.
can you e-mail me?
it's the thing you do with a computer.
well, I would have thought even you, Abbot, would...
the writings have come up for auction?
14th century.
no, Father, I'm fine.
this is me smiling!
thank you very much.
I have asked the Lord for one thing.
one thing only do I want
to live in the Lord's house all my life, to marvel there at His goodness.
in times of trouble He will shelter me,
he will keep me safe in His temple and make me secure on a high rock.
so I will triumph over my enemies.
with shouts of joy I will offer...
Gilly, you should see this.
I've never seen a patient recover when so close to death.
your colleague told us you came into contact with a piece of ancient wood?
Yes.
I told my colleagues that I helped a student archaeologist pull it out of the ground.
and is it true that this wood is Biblical?
perhaps 2, 000 years old? - I don't know.
would you describe what you saw today as a miracle?
how the hell did the press get on to this?
I didn't say anything!
you let a layman help you on a dig site?!
I...
I'm sorry.
Hayley, call the university.
any member ofthe rugger squad looking to earn cash, tell them to get down here.
dr Magwilde, a few questions? - Remove your stringy buttocks from my dig.
have your team uncovered part of the True Cross?
and is the rest of it still there? - Yes.
last week we tripped over the Holy Grail, next week Atlantis.
but that's the reputation that ruined your mother.
going after the exotic to prove.- OK, OK, look, we're very busy.
broke her career and broke her spirit!
dear Edward,
I know why we can't beat Bin Laden.
he and his lot have faith.
they may be wrong, but at least they have that.
whereas we have the True Faith in jesus, but we don't stand up for it.
and that is where the Muslims and others have us over a barrel.
james,We must test our resolve.
don't doubt, not for a second.
we must prove our faith.
the Knights awake.
excuse me, can we help you?
this is a place for Muslim study.
you're opponents of Edward Laygass. - Laygass?
he incites violence.
the White Wings Alliance is an evil... - Puts non-denominational Christianity at the head of daily life.
look, mate, the man's books and his speeches...
they encourage hatred. - You've invaded a Christian country.
I was born in Dudley!
soon a fire is going to be lit.
and everyone, everyone will flock to it.
so...
you work for Laygass. - We are the Poor Fellow Soldiers 0f Christ.
we work for Him.
this...
this is a Holy War.
look...
islam is a peaceful religion.
Allah is peace.
Where's this going to end? - With Britain Christian.
s0 RUN! RUN!
run!
I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough, Lord.
I... I didn't start this, honestly.
I didn't even think the piece of wood we found was special.
you're a believer, aren't you?
Jack was minutes away from dying.
I'm a Christian. I believe God sometimes chooses to heal.
excuse me.
I saw you on the news.
touch him.
sorry? - He has leukaemia.
could you touch him, please?
I'm not special. - What harm can it do?
bless you in jesus' name.
thank you.
you should get that thing removed.
they work themselves out.
these are the keys to my flat.
bring me some spare clothes, they're drying on the radiator.
touch nothing!
you've got company.
Oh, and you'll find a crossbow.
bring that too.
the other interested party.
he's bought this site for three times the premium.
it's his land now. - Why?
to declare it holy ground.
Daniel, this site and these finds are under myjurisdiction.
who the hell are we talking about?!
eminent Archaeologist in suicide attempt
after it, follow it.
follow the gleam.
what the hell is this?
he won't tell me who's bought the site.
I can't believe how quickly this is getting out of control.
everyone wants a piece ofthe Cross. They always have.
I'm not being funny or anything, but some men with medieval swords just broke into your flat.
are you OK? - Yeah. I found a way out.
how? - Through a window.
here.
I'd say they were looking for the wood sample.
yes? - It's Gregory.
I know who's taken over the site.
philanthropic right-wing Christian.
his father founded an outreach organisation using impressionable young boys from the orphanage.
has long held a belief that the country needs to restore the values and principles ofthe Knights Templar.
presumably without the burning and wholesale murder of Muslims, I assume.
Well,Hmm.
white Wings, publishing and television.
edward Laygass announces plans to lobby Parliament for the abolishment of non-Christian religions in the UK.
he's been disowned by every respectable priest and clergyman in the country.
here's a video stream from the White Wings website.
britain's green and pleasant land has been overrun by invaders from the East.
so what can we do about it?
do you want theirjerusalem or Christ's jerusalem?
Hello?
I've been waiting for you.
thanks for coming.
I think we should talk.
you know, I've met Muslims, good Muslims driven with that same look you have now.
mad with zeal, longing to make a difference.
but there is another way.
and if you follow it, you'll get closer to God.
don't make me go to the police.
stand down from this.
I don't want there to be any trouble.
you have guided my hand and given me my resolve.
I entrust myself to Your will.
Hello, nice to see you again.
nice to see you. - Nice to see you.
hell, How old are you now? - Nine?
I believe the Knights Templar brought the Cross of Christ to England.
if they were butchered then maybe the Cross is still here.
geo-phys hasn't uncovered anything else.
and anyway, wouldn't their attackers have taken it? - Not necessarily, no.
then why not let us find it?
why turn a scientific enquiry into a Cecil B DeMille film?
we are at war, Dr Magwilde.
and our enemy is winning.
God has forsaken us because we are a nation of hypocrites and we goto church to get married but we don't really believe.
we baptise our kids and renounce the Devil and all his ways, but really we're just counting the seconds until we can wet the baby's head.
I don't need a sermon from you.
the Templars had faith.
my favourite Bible quote, john 14 Verse 2, "In my Father's house are many mansions.
the most wonderful thing for me would be to see the rooms of Heaven filled.
and when we find the Cross itself, the Christian world will rally to it.
you got that nurse on television, didn't you?
you want to turn this place into your own version of Lourdes.
may I?
be gone by the time I come back.
did you break into my home, you bastard?
Laygass is going to twist all this into some kind of modern-day crusade.
what do you want to do, Gilly?
let him have the site.
well, you said yourself, geo-phys uncovered nothing new.
which means whoever killed the knights took the Cross.
all we have to do is find out where and get to it before Laygass does.
what have you found?
a Grandmontine monk was with the knights when they were ambushed.
we found his crucifix, the cross with the symbol carved into it.
Yeah, but he was killed along with the other knights.
his name was Stephen.
and this morning, I found him.
a Chronicle of Stephen, holy brother of the Grandmontine.
he followed them to England, escaping the persecutions.
his manuscript is vague,
I don't think Stephen was considered very reliable.
the ret ofthe order went out of their way to discredit him.
his full writings have been broken up.
some are in the Ecclesiastical Library.
I've sent Dolly there now.
but one manuscript appears to be privately owned.
any ideas by whom? - Edward Laygass.
Stephen's writings are in the past tense.
he must have escaped the attack.
he was the soul survivor of that attack.
he knew what the knights were carrying.
he knew what became ofthe rest ofthe Cross.
but if Laygass has these writings, then...
he has all the answers, he would know where the Cross was.
he has some ofthe writings, not all of them.
he must be missing a vital clue.
you are impressed. - I am because you are very clever.
what? What is it?
well, if and I only say IF
Laygass has an army of modern-day crusaders on his side, if they had the Cross, what would they do with it?
now then, where art thou, Brother Stephen?
Grandmontine Monks
brother Stephen travelled with our knights, as recounted in his Chroniculi minori.
their leader was a great Templar
jaques de Saint-Omar. - That sword...
why do you like that sword?
Ben, look at it.
Yeah, Can we stick to what we're doing, please?
I know you can see it. - What is it about this sword?
nothing, can we... - If I may resume？
the knights were attacked. - By Saracens?
they were dressed as Saracens, left Saracen coins, but Stephen knew differently.
english Mercenaries in disguise.
he says they stole a "most magnificent relic,
by which, ofcourse, he means the Cross.
he goes onto say, These thieves were in the pay ofthe Grandmontines themselves.
Why?
because the Templars were being wiped out.
the monks couldn't trust them with the Cross, so they made it look like Saracens had killed them and taken the Cross back to the Holy Land.
in fact, they would have taken it to their monastery at Creswell.
Creswell's been heavily excavated.
nothing doing.
they hid it somewhere!
if the answer was in that book, then...
Laygass would be lynching heathens and parading the Cross up and down Pall Mall by now.
where else could the monks hide it?
well, Laygass can only read the top-soil.
we know how to dig.
fancy a drive, Dolly?
pay a visit to Brother Laygass's place?
I'lljust put the kettle on.
dr Magwilde, Professor Parton.
Wessex University Archaeology Department.
we're here to collect Mr Laygass's notes on the Brother Stephen writings.
make this OUR Holy War
here's the book.
it's wired.
syria, jordan, the Holy Land, - Gundelia. - Good.
And?
look at us - we're so paranoid.
laterally cut, why?
pack everything up.
the finds, everything.
get it in the back ofthe truck.
go, go, go, go, go.
we haven't got much time. - There has to be a key.
why do people always say that?
no, there doesn't.
in my Father's house there are many mansions.
it's Laygass's favourite quote from the Bible.
my lady.
the beheaded body of a young Muslim student in the south of the city has sparked an outcry of anger and disgust among religious leaders across the country.
as the Bishop of Birmingham meets with Muslim clerics today, to discuss how.
sounds like Laygass's war is about to begin.
no wonder Laygass loves this thing.
brother Stephen talks about the Knights Templar rising again and crushing the heathens.
what are all those symbols there?
the animals and stuff. - Pictograms.
they reference different monasteries and churches, each one representing a particular place.
stop!
brother Stephen carved this symbol into the back of his crucifix.
why would he desecrate his own holy cross?
maybe it referred to a place that was extra special for him?
extra holy? - Where is that crucifix?
well, we packed everything.
Viv, you cleared out the office.
did you see it? - I packed it.
I'm sure.
I think.
no, he carved this symbol because that's where they were taking the Cross to.
the snake and the sword.
the Templar church at Garway, Herefordshire.
Garway. - Garway.
what do you plan to do with the Cross in the unlikely event that we find it here?
well, shall we find it first and procrastinate later?
you lost, eh? - We're looking for the church.
the church?
it's closed, though, for drainage works.
got the flagstones up, an' all sorts.
nothing under there then? - Like what?
Oh, I don't know, secret chambers, anything like that?
Thanks, anyway. - If you wanna sightsee, you can have a look at the dovecote.
Dovecote? - Built with the church.
it's in my garden. Come on through.
14th century, for certain.
if not earlier.
best one I've seen.
holy, ain't they, doves?
symbol of peace.
Dolly? - How many?
12 rows high, and I count 55 coops in one row, and six. . . 666.
the number of the Beast? - 666 doves to counter the power of Satan.
funny how folk tick, isn't it?
looks like they've blocked up a well mouth.
are you sure? - Yeah.
stop! Hang on!
do you know how to put this on?
come on.
OK!
these are Roman crosses, collected from the Crusades.
the Templars didn't know which was Christ's, so they brought them all.
and the piece we found?
it's from one of these.
be very careful.
what's going on?
once filled with pure white doves.
now teeming with grey, sullied scavengers from abroad.
how do we know which one?
it's all about faith, isn't it?
maybe we shouldn't know.
you're right.
we'll take one.
it'll stand as the True Cross.
it'll be a beacon of hope.
I don't think so.
come here.
what the hell are you doing?!
you're going to help me secure a cross.
you will help me, or I swear to God this child will die!
what have you done?
I'll find you!
What?! You gonna let them burn?
is that what jesus would do? - What do you know?!
we know Laygass brainwashed innocent children to grow up believing they were Holy warriors.
your knights, do you know why they kept doves?
to tax the farmers. - Liar!
the doves are a symbol of purity. - Doves would take the peasants' grain.
however much they took, the Templars would take the same. - They are holy birds!
James, we can't leave them to burn down there!
they'll burn anyway one day.
I don't have your strength. - Why?
because he's killed?
James, you've shown us you're brave enough to kill for the Cross, show us you're brave enough to save.
come on! Come to me.
help me save a cross. Help me!
help me!
kill her! Kill her!
it has never been about faith, it's been about power.
come on! Come on!
kill her!
No! I'm going down!
and did those feet in ancient times Walk upon England's mountains green?
God gave you that voice, sister.
but the Devil uses it.
I've got you, honey.
don't let go.
help... Help me.
I called the police! Anyone hurt?
it's over.
the Cross, it's gone.
you sang to him.
I just thought it might buy me some time.
you know what?
I'm impressed.
now, please, please, please, for the love of jehovah, may we go to the pub?
how's your miracle patient?
the remission hasn't lasted.
but he got to talk to his family one last time.
that's God's gift to him.
don't lose your faith, Helena.
it's working loose. I think I can get it.
let me.
God is in the quiet places and the little things.
Viv,Can I ask you something?
are you going to keep talking like a fortune cookie or are you going to get out there and start digging?
what's with the Cheshire Cat thing? - I'm just. .
thank you, I'm glad to be here.
you're very welcome, Viv.
you coming, boss? - Not right now.
there's something I have to do first.
don't worry, Mum,
I'm still following the gleam.
if you don't know your past how can you know your future.
slaves?
why is it every time we dig something up...
I shall do nothing to help you.
someone help us!
there's some powerful people who do not want a black man for President.
who's they?
it's a cover-up. - Bras off.
everything comes to he who fights.
you're not in America now.
I want to know who and why.
does anybody else have an underpant situation?
Temperance.
first card she turns over is literally your name.
are you gonna tell me that this is a coincidence?
Yes, a one in 78 chance.
it was on top. It's not really speaking to me.
okay, I see a sick man in a hospital.
he takes refuge in a dream life.
you're there in the dream, and you're helping him to create that dream life by telling him a story.
you're both so happy in the story, so happy it's almost sad when he awakens.
okay, no offense to you and your psychic, but I just got off a flight from Guatemala.
I want to go check in with Cam and then shower and change.
the man whose life you saved is really excited to see you again.
no, I don't save lives.
people are already dead when I get to them.
I'm pretty sure you saved somebody's life.
a man with the heart of a lion.
booth has a lion heart.
I do not like cats.
well, that's consistent with the person you were before your brain surgery.
I don't own a nightclub, I'm not married to Bones, you are not a singing bartender, and I hate clowns.
so can I go back to work now?
when our sense of reality is challenged, you know, really challenged, it can some take time to regain our footing.
look, it's been six weeks since they put my brain box through the blender, okay?
I am back, baby!
special Agent Seeley Joseph Booth.
have you been in touch with Dr. Brennan since you were released from the hospital?
uh, no.
she's, uh, you know, in Guatemala there, digging up Aztecs.
do you miss anything about the alternative life you experienced while in a coma?
Yeah.
the clothes. I miss those clothes. They were great clothes.
okay, I'm certifying you as fit for duty.
I am fit for duty. - That's what I'm saying.
Yeah, and what I'm saying to you is you don't have to certify me for anything, pal, because I told you, I'm back.
well, in fact, you had amnesia, slurring of speech, identity confusion, headaches, irritability and double vision.
so, yeah, as a psychologist, I do have to certify you for duty.
why... why are you arguing?
I'm not arguing.
this man was lost.
you brought him the light that showed him the way home.
without it, he would've died.
booth was in a coma. Brennan read him the book that she was writing.
when Booth woke up, he thought that they had a whole different life together.
he thought that they were married. He thought that for days.
you were joined at that time. You're still joined.
nothing either of you is saying makes sense.
were you pregnant? - What? No, of course not.
I mean, in your book.
no, I deleted the book. I - I'm tired, Angela.
I'm gonna go check in at the office and then go home.
nice to meet you, Ms. Harmonia.
her life is at a very critical turning point, between great happiness and the death.
Dr. Brennan! Would you care to hug?
Why? - Okay.
I'm good with that. Welcome home.
thank you.What - What did Booth do while I was gone, solve boring, normal murders?
he hasn't been reinstated yet.
the doctors told me that he'd be fine in a couple of days. That's why I went.
sweets is examining Booth today. Fingers crossed.
I'm happy to see you, too.
Oh, I'm happy personally and professionally.
you know, unsolved murders have gone up 1, 000% since you left.
I find that hard to believe.
rough estimate. Welcome back. - Thank you.
look at that. I'm reinstated on the day that you come home.
that's the weirdest coinky-dink ever.
no, it's not even the weirdest coinky-dink today.
if you were reinstated, why are you dressed like a furniture mover?
sweets, he just, um, cleared me, so I came straight over to tell you.
what took you so long to recover?
Oh, um... don't worry. Nothing's wrong with me. I'm 110%.
well, y - you know there's nothing more than 100%, right?
Hey, Brennan. Hey, Booth.
listen, guys, there are a bunch of bodies buried under the Teversham Fountain.
how do you know that? - Avalon told me.
who's Avalon? - Avalon is Angela's psychic.
see, even superstitious Booth doesn't believe in psychics.
that's interesting, because she says that you two were linked in a very profound and spiritual manner.
Oh, really? Well, she also says that in your weirdo alternate shared life experience thing that
Brennan was pregnant.
it's odd that neither of you mentioned that.
let's go check it out. - What? No. Why?
six weeks, Bones. I'm going stir-crazy here, okay? Let me suit up.
can I at least take a shower? - Yeah, I need to shave.
so, this ground-penetrating radar can really see things?
Yeah, a lot clearer than a psychic. You're dressed very oddly.
what do you mean? This is regulation FBI.
well, what about the garish socks and the gaudy tie?
what, you don't remember?
you resist regimentation with these tiny symbols of rebellion.
I remember. I remember, okay?
let me just re-acclimate myself at my own speed here, okay? What is that?
nothing. Because there's nothing here, because there's no such thing as a psychic.
in my coma dream, you were pregnant.
sweets said that your dream was nothing more than your comatose brain processing what I read to you from my book.
wait, the point is, how did the psychic know that if she isn't psychic?
the psychic was right. - What about us being linked in a very profound manner?
what is it? What do you see?
it's human remains. Lots of human remains.
what's that supposed to be?
bones says dead people. - At least eight, maybe more.
is there any chance these are very old remains of settlers or Indians, who should be left in peace?
Yes, except for that.
what's that? - A plastic disc.
okay, fine, listen, Bones wants to start digging,I want to go question the psychic who sent us here.
I did not hear "psychic." I heard "anonymous source."
just get Bones the warrant that she needs so she can start digging.
wow, you are keen to get back to work.
got something to prove, cherie?
Oh, it is plausible that Booth feels the urge to prove he's no longer brain damaged.
you can start. I'll get the warrant in ten minutes.
Yes, we're back.
you're the one who told me never to look happy at a crime scene.
right. We'll look happy after we find out who did this horrible crime and get them behind bars.
all right.
it's very hard for me to explain my process.
well, you're going to have to do better than, um, I'm a psychic.
you're the man that was in the coma, aren't you?
would you pick a card, please?
um, okay.
you're worried you lost something.
ms. Harmonia, I really don't need a tarot card reading right now.
what I need to know is how you knew that those people were buried under the Teversham Fountain.
it's all in the cards, Agent Booth.
you can't argue with what's in the cards.
you never lost anything in that coma, Agent Booth.
you gained something.
so the remains are all in the soil beneath the layer of gravel.
ten years ago, they renovated the fountain.
they raised it on hydraulic lifts, sunk a series of shafts, mucked out the clay, laid down a layer of gravel, and then poured cement over that.
so it's reasonable to assume that the bodies were tossed down the shaft before the gravel was dumped.
I've got samples of the soil, the gravel, scrapings from the cement and this.
if we're lucky, it's something the murderer left behind.
you might as well head back to the lab, start analyzing your samples.
Oh, my God.
this is like climbing down into a grave here.
isn't this great? We back together again, chasing criminals.
Yeah, pit full of mass murder victims -- what's not to love?
as soon as I get this skull free, I'd like you to start facial reconstruction.
sweetie, does the fact that Avalon was right about these bodies make you rethink her abilities?
Angela, I've met dozens of shamans and medicine men, so-called holy people over the years, and I've never seen any hard evidence that they were in touch with any spirit world where the laws of physics don't apply.
until now.
this is actual evidence, Angela, not some mumbo jumbo from a deck of tarot cards.
first drink since the brain operation?
Yeah, and since, uh, you know, getting back to work.
I'm honored. An auspicious occasion.
so, what do you want?
just want to share a drink, you know, with one of my closest and deest friends, who, you know, I can trust with, um, certain things.
Oh, God. - What?
there's lasting brain damage, isn't there? Something you haven't told anyone.
are you hearing voices? - No.
Seeley, if you're hearing voices, that's really serious.
nice. Thank you. I know. I'm not hearing voices, Camille, all right? Relax.
I just... Well, I did forget that I wore goofy socks, so we can do one for that, huh?
the things that make you a great cop have nothing to do with the socks.
what's really on your mind?
all right, um...
that, uh, place that I went to, you know, in my coma dream...
it was just, Bones and I, it was so real...
you're in love with Dr. Brennan.
what I'm wondering is, am I the same guy?
a sweet, kick-ass FBI murder-solver with hard fists and a lion heart?
Yeah, you're still him.
my advice, for what it's worth:
forget the bruise drain and go with your lion heart.
right. Right? Yeah, and tell Bones how I feel.
Yes. Except, be sure about your feelings, because if you crack that shell and you change your mind, she'll die of loneliness before she'll ever trust anyone ever again.
right.
Hey, Bones.
what time is it?
Oh, it's early.
what are you doing here?
I... I hate this part of the case.
you know, where you're doing stuff, and I'm just at home doing nothing.
I-I have something for you to do. - Right.
it's, um, the disc we saw on the GPR.
Yeah, uh, hey, look at that. Minidisc -- definitely '90s technology.
don't you want to go to breakfast? - No time. I got to, you know, get this to my people so they can find out the manufacturer and all that hooey and get it to Angela so she can get all the information she needs off this thing.
but no one is awake except for you and me.
Avalon Harmoa is her professional psychic name.
born Stephanie Susan Janes, no criminal history, no known criminal associations and, in my professional psychological opinion, not a nut bar.
law -abiding and sane does not explain 12 buried skeletons.
she honestly thinks that she's psychic. I mean, she really does.
if she's not psychic, then she's involved.
I don't believe in psychics.
well, neither did I. - Do I.
present tense. - She got to you, huh, Sweets?
okay, check it out. My dad's watch goes missing three months ago...
I have no idea where it is.
she tells me it's in the pocket of a jacket that I forgot I owned at the unclaimed goods at the FBI dry cleaner.
booth, how many fingers am I holding up?
Yeah, brain damage joke-- that's real funny.
what do you got?
what I got are multiple degrees in botany, geology and entomology which allow me to discern vital clues...
like this one.
what's that, a graph of Russian wheat production in 1955?
it's a microspectrophotometry scan indicating that the fabric we found with the remains is lint-free, static-resistant polyester.
it was designed for use in fire-hazardous, oxygen-enriched atmospheres.
u. S.Navy refers to them as "poopie suits."
right, you mean for submarine crews.
Yeah, exactly.
now, my conclusion is we have uncovered the anonymous grave of the crew of the super secret stealth submarine Hawkfish, which disappeared in the late '90s.
the U. S. Government denies the very existence of the submarine, yet I...
the way it works, Booth, is that I'm impatient and curt, while you somehow keep the squints motivated and productive.
right, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. - Good.
Hiya, Bones.
there's no sign of any violence on any of the skeletons we found, except for this one.
could the victims have drowned?
no, drowning leaves diatoms in the marrow, and Cam didn't find any. Why?
Hodgins said that they could've been a submarine crew.
preliminary histological analysis shows that the victims were of both sexes, encompassing Mongoloid, Negroid and Caucasoid features and ranging in age from the late teens to the early 70s.
that is a bullet hole. - No.
micro-fractures indicate that the projectile was moving much slower than any bullet.
also, I can't feel any beveling on the inside of the skull.
but there's very slight beveling on the outside.
he was killed from the inside out.
awkward. Awkward, awkward. Very awkward.
Angela, what is awkward?
the casing on the minidisc that you found at the dig was cracked, so there was damage.
I did what I could, but...
I got this one frame off the corrupted file.
what's so awkward about that?
this isn't the awkward part yet.
Glen Echo Car Rentals.
and a license plate.
I figure you have 12 bodies and this vehicle holds between 12 and 15, so...
Angela, you shouldn't feel awkward about this.
you should be very proud of your excellent work.
now comes the awkward part.
why did you make a picture of the psychic?
this isn't Avalon.
this is a facial reconstruction of the first fountain skull.
Hello, Seeley. Hello, Temperance. Nice to see you two together.
this is an official visit.
am I in trouble?
we just, uh, need you to explain a few things, that's all.
we're still trying to identify the 12 victims under the fountain.
you see, Dr. Brennan and her people were able to give one of them a face, and we need you to take a look at it.
Oh, no.
this can't be.
it can't be what?
it's my sister.
Avalon told me she had no family.
obviously telling the truth. Her sister's been dead for ten years.
Yeah, it's just, you'd think that that's something that would show up in the cards.
well, the future consists of the culmination of a near infinite number of variables.
turning over a card has no effect at all.
well, then how did the cards tell her where her sister was buried?
well, I'm certain that her knowledge of her sister's remains did not stem from pictures on a card.
so you're gonna have to work late tonight.
Oh, hello, Angela. You look so pretty today.
well, thank you, Booth. And hello to you, too.
Oh, she's being you and herself. I don't know why.
what do you want Angela to work on? - "Harbingers of a New Day.
right. Glen Echo Car Rentals, it went out of business, but we did find this guy who rented this van to the Harbinger group, and get this, the group never brought it back.
some kind of cult? - Exactly. And you know what?
angela is gonna get to work on the Internet and find out all the information for us.
Yes, sir. On my way. You bet.
all right, look, I'm sorry, Angela.
you know, it's... first case back. Uh, you know, it's been a long day.
maybe I got something to prove. Sorry.
you look... you look beautiful.
Oh, would you like me to kiss you on the forehead, too?
sure.
an ordered, clean society, where we will no longer live amongst the poisons and pollutants ...
okay, I managed to get a partial video file off the minidisc.
this... is Tom Fargood. El Supremo.
he sold places in a secret undersea facility he called Harbinger.
so these people are all nuts?
not at all. People pay a fortune to visit that giant, underwater hotel in Abu Dhabi.
Yeah, Dubai. There's another one in Istanbul.
key West, Sweden.
so where did Fargood locate his new Atlantis?
a secret site in French Polynesia.
buried under a fountain-- it's a bit of a come-down from Bora-Bora.
I count 14 people in this video.
we dug out 12 from under the fountain.
look at this.
is that Avalon?
no, that's her sister. - How do you know?
because...
that is Avalon.
they look like they were pretty close.
her sister ended up in a mass grave that she led us to.
not sure that adds up to "pretty close."
it was my idea to join Harbingers.
it cost every cent my sister Jenny and I had from my parents' insurance.
look, how much did Fargood get from you?
almost a million dollars.
what motivated you to join Harbinger?
Jenny suffered from MCS.
multiple chemical sensitivity.
allergic to the whole world?
Fargood put these gold seals on our diplomas whenever we passed part of his training.
this day was how to use a speargun to hunt fish.
fascinating. I need to know how you knew where your sister's body got dumped.
I think you're hiding something.
it rankles me,I'm rankled.
I suppose this whole time you thought your sister was living in a Yellow Submarine?
the Harbinger's facility, yeah.
why would she go and leave you behind?
you did something that got you expelled, didn't you? What was it?
I went to an outside doctor for my headaches.
it wasn't allowed.
we're gonna need a list of all these people's names.
and the name of the Harbinger doctor.
there never was any underwater facility, was there?
he just killed everybody for their money.
my sister was killed for money.
I'm Dr. Leacock.
uh, as you can see, I'm a little pressed for time.
we're here about Tom Fargood and the Harbingers of a New Day.
okay, he knows them.
would you like to come with me? - Okay.
Fargood wanted me to be the physician in his underwater utopia.
I declined.
why, because you thought it didn't exist?
no, I believed it existed.
but the idea of spending the rest of my life underwater babysitting a bunch of people who are allergic to the 20th century, I'm more useful here.
so, they all suffered from MCS?
Yeah, pesticides, power lines, incinerators, gas stations, fresh paint, even perfume made them sick.
these people are canaries in a coal mine when it comes to pollutants.
I always thought they'd head down there, move into some renovated Russian submarine, then come up and, you know, live happily in grass huts on a motu.
was I wrong?
well, maybe you've heard of the, uh, 12 human skeletons that were found under the Teversham Fountain.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
if you still have the medical records, it would be very helpful in positively identifying the victims.
of course. H - How did they...?
Dr. Brennan here is a forensic anthropologist.
she's still trying to figure out the cause of death.
if they had MCS, it should show up fairly obviously in their bones.
do you have a warrant? - Do we need one?
this is a state-funded clinic.
I have to abide by the letter of the law. I'm sorry.
all right. We'll be back.
Hey, can I ask... how you connected me to the group?
you see, we have our own rules.
Dr. Leacock was right to require a warrant.
right, and I was right to tell him that we have rules too, right?
Yeah, you know what? I'll have it for you in the morning.
great. That's all I needed to hear. Thanks, Caroline. You're the best.
whoa, easy, don't touch the bobblehead!
Hey, Sweets.
I'm working, everything's great.
look at me, I'm fine, my brain's feeling good so, bye.
well, I've been informed that your brain still thinks it's in love with Dr. Brennan.
great, Cam ratted me out.
no, I found out through Avalon. You told Cam?
great. She finds your watch so now all of a sudden you believe everything that she says?
okay, you just admitted that you told Cam you're in love with Dr. Brennan.
I...
you know what you're looking at?
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure you haven't been this close to one in a long time.
it's a PET scan of your brain.
hmm, then I was wrong.
this is called the ventral tegmental area.
this is the dorsal caudate body.
now, these two areas have been proven to be linked to romantic love and sexual arousal.
okay, if this is your version of dirty pictures, it's really not working for me right now.
now, this, uh, this scan was taken before your operation.
the green and blue colors indicate very low activity.
same scan while you were in the coma.
just lit up like the 4th of July.
you were dreaming of being in love. Of being married, right?
same scan... three days ago.
before your operation, you were not in love.
after your operation, you were.
conclusion: Your feelings are not real and will fade away, like every other symptom of your coma.
now, I think you and I both know that Dr. Brennan's hyperrationality is really just a cover for a very vulnerable and sensitive core.
Oh, great, so we're talking about Bones' brain, too, here?
so, if you breach those defenses and it turns out you don't really love her...
I left you hard copies.
based on the Harbinger video, Avalon's names, and Dr. Brennan's analysis, this is most likely Louis Lampcov.
the man with the hole in his skull.
the only victim we know for certain died violently.
my 3-D imaging suggests that a shaft shot from a speargun through the soft palate would've caused the wound.
I know how everybody else died.
not Mr. Hole-in-the-Skull, but the others.
that's the crystallized calcium oxalate you found in the soil.
right, minute amounts in the soil layer beneath each and every body.
well, is it poisonous?
no but it makes sense to ask ourselves what processes might result in crystalline calcium oxalate.
liver or kidneys.
kidney function would do that to plain old oxalate which is derived from glycolate.
Glycolate's poisonous.
glycolate is a conversion of glycoaldehyde via the aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver.
a poison that isn't a poison until it's metabolized?
ethylene glycol.
that's antifreeze.
sweet to the taste, easily disguised, administered over time which gives the kidneys time to crystallize the stuff.
it's virtually untraceable.
unless some brilliant bug and slime wonk finds it in the soil.
and that, ladies, that is why they call me King of the Lab.
nobody does that but you.
the early symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning: fatigue, nausea, headache.
indistinguishable from MCS.
Dr. Brennan's gonna want to confer with that Harbinger doctor.
is that true about the King of the Lab?
that only you care? Yeah.
I always thought Jenny was alive and happy somewhere.
some psychic I am.
look, I don't know if you're psychic or not.
then why would I send you to the fountain in the first place?
remorse.
neurosurgeons are telling me right here that this part of my brain shows love, and this... What?
let the neurosurgeons have your brain.
they know about your brain, they don't know jack about your heart.
here.
cut the deck. - Come on, what is this?
cut the cards. - All right, fine, I'll cut the deck.
she's in terrible danger.
you gotta go to her now. - Oh, come on, Avalon.
I'm still a cop. I know when someone's looking to escape here.
so chain me to the railing.
do what you gotta do, but you better go to her now, Agent Booth.
go to her now. Go to her right now. Go to her now. Now! Right now.
bones. - Go right now!
Hello?
Dr. Leacock, it's Dr. Brennan with the FBI.
Dr. Brennan, come on back to my office.
lock that door behind you, please.
this isn't the best neighborhood.
there's been an interesting development in the Harbinger case.
yeah?
well, it appears that the victims were poisoned.
is there any chance that what appeared to you to be MCS was actually a result...
he's shredding the Harbinger files.
bones, Bones, you all right? You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine, I'm okay.
bones, your arm, whoa... - Oh, God.
no, don't pull it out. Don't touch that! Bones, easy, I gotcha.
he tried to kill me. - All right, all right.
thank you. - Easy.
the ambulance is on the way, okay?
keep the pressure on the wound. - Okay, I got it, I got it.
just relax. Just trust me, all right? I'll take care of you. Shh, I got you.
I'll take care of you, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.
I got you. I got you, baby.
Ooh, that's a lot of blood.
I'm fine. This is Bones' blood.
that's supposed to be good?
she's fine.
they fixed her up and, uh, sent her home.
I should've been there for her.
you were there. You killed the bad guy dead.
I know you hate that, but it always makes me a little glad.
does that make me a bad person?
I guess that closes the case.
none of the remains have been identified as Fargood.
you think the bad doctor was working for Fargood?
Yeah. Used to be that my hunches were good enough to keep us working a case.
Cherie, they still are.
that means our little psychic friend is still a suspect.
and change your shirt.
Hello? Ms. Harmonia?
I'm down here.
Dr. Brennan.
how are you feeling?
well, they gave me medication, so I feel how I imagine people of average intelligence feel all the time.
I came here to see if you'd run away.
no. I'm here looking for clues.
something I might have missed.
what, in your cards? Because that is a waste of time.
you say that after I sent Agent Booth to save your life.
well, you knew where the bodies were buried.
you knew Dr. Leacock would attack me.
you were an abandoned child.
the world scares you so you wrap it up neatly in bonds of reason, education and proof.
all riddles are solvable to you. Except for one.
Yes. The riddle of how you knew where your sister was buried.
no. The riddle you can't solve is how somebody could love you.
well, I'm beautiful and very intelligent.
the answer to the question that you're afraid to say out loud is...
Yes. He knows the truth of you.
and he's dazzled by that truth.
Fargood's arrogant.
he'll think he changed his modus operandi, but it'll only be superficially.
what, so you think these keywords won't work?
no, not specifically.
by the time we finish a more general search, you'll actually have to shave.
okay, why is facial hair the marker of an adult male?
why not height? I'm tall.
right, keywords.
uh, well, Fargood targeted a group of people who were sick of the world, literally, and promised them a new life, right?
a life without suffering.
sick of the world, of course.
you know who you're referring to?
Yeah, people who are in pain, who lost hope, who are sunk in existential despair.
that's not literal enough, Sweets.
you're talking about old people who have nobody else to turn to.
Angela's right. The bone structure is a very close match.
see, we're trying to figure exactly when you changed your name from Tom Fargood to Alexander Gallo.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you're selling shares in a very exclusive retirement community.
very sound investment in your future.
I recommend you buy.
well, we won't be doing that anytime soon, Mr. Gallo, because a significant number of people who put down their nonrefundable deposits, they died before they moved in.
probably from ethylene glycol poisoning.
I want a lawyer.
and I won't be drinking anything from that glass.
you want my DNA, get a warrant.
well, there's no point in getting your DNA. We have nothing to compare it to.
excuse us.
alexander Gallo's identity is bulletproof.
I am certain that's Fargood.
see, she is certain. That is good enough for me.
we gotta keep this guy in custody, or he's going to run.
good enough for you is not good enough for a judge.
that man poisoned 11 people and used a speargun to kill a 12th.
look, we gotta find a way to hold him.
don't arrest him till shift change. - Right.
Why? - We'll lose him in the system.
FBI stall tactics, Bones. Thank you.
do not thank me. He'll be out of here in 24 hours.
and even if you prove that Gallo and Fargood are the same man,I don't see a shred of evidence proving that he killed those 12 people.
I need proofALCIre he was Gallo, our bad guy was Fargood.
so, I need the van.
what are the chances of finding a vehicle stolen ten years ago?
and I need this.
you want us to find a ten-year-old stolen van and a speargun all in the next...
12 hours, tops. - Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
go. Perform miracles.
you know what, let's see if we can get a make and model on that speargun.
I'm telling you, even miracles aren't going to help.
we can't prove that Fargood and Gallo are the same person. What is that?
Avalon's Harbinger certificate.
remember she said Fargood applied these seals himself?
the saliva on the seal is how we get Fargood's DNA.
but how do we get Gallo's? - Human nature.
human nature, Bones.
you found Tom Fargood?
well, that's what we need you to tell us. - Only if you're up to it.
why wouldn't I be?
well, because all these years you thought your sister left you without saying good-bye.
and really this man here murdered Jenny.
and then buried her in a mass unmarked grave.
why are you trying to make this harder for me?
is that Tom Fargood?
is this the man who murdered your little sister?
you killed my sister! You killed my little sister! - I got her, I got her.
you sit there so smug!
that is sneaky. - Is sneaky good or bad?
good, if it holds up in court.
next time, make it look more like you're taking advantage of a situation, not scripting it.
don't keep me hanging, people.
are Alexander Gallo and Tom Fargood the same person?
Yep. Perfect match.
well, your facial expression suggests that you are dissatisfied.
you proved that Gallo is Fargood, fine, but now you gotta prove that Fargood killed those people and dumped them under that fountain.
charge him with murder, give us time to find the speargun and the van.
Cherie, what are the chances of that happening?
a million to one?
Oh, we don't have all the variables, so...
you're not being precise, you're simply illustrating the difficulty.
everything maybe adds up all the time in the lab, but in real life, sometimes you lose one.
well, what should we do, kill him?
still in earshot, cherie, still in earshot.
Fargood is going to get away with mass murder.
you know, I don't want to talk about work.
well, what do you want to talk about?
you all right?
not really. I just...
I have something that I want to say to you from inside my heart.
blood is in your heart.
the idea that the heart is the seat of love and strength of character is ancient but metaphoric.
I mean, in reality, these qualities are based in the amygdala, which is part of the brain.
no, I been...
ever since I woke up from my coma I been wanting to say something to you about you.
well, why didn't you say something earlier?
because I just - I just wanted to finish this case.
you know, to make sure that I'm back. That - that, you know, that I'm me again.
well, does the fact that we didn't close the case give you doubts?
no, no, we did the best that we can. Hold on. You...
you don't think I'm fully back?
no, I know you're fully back. - You do?
well, you're wearing your socks.
Yeah.
Oh, no. Oh, no, he hates...
booth, do not kill the clown.
Hey, come here.
booth. You hate clowns. You do not think they're funny.
all right. Oh, before my coma, I shot a clown off an ice cream truck.
Yeah.
well, I'm... sure in a few weeks you'll hate clowns again.
be back to normal.
Yeah, a few weeks.
well, what did you want to tell me?
that I love you.
well, right back at you, Booth. I love you, too. Attaboy.
you two got a moment?
okay, what's going on?
I thought I'd give you the honor of arresting Mr. Fargood-- Alexander Gallo
whatever you want to call him. Hell, arrest both of him.
you said we didn't have enough evidence.
for murder. We didn't have enough to charge him with murder.
but murder isn't the only crime in the world.
it just seems like that around us.
grand theft auto regarding the rental van?
fraud by wire?
that man sold people a luxury hotel under the sea.
if he can't show it to us, then he defrauded them.
illegal wearing of the uniform.
those poopie suits were Navy issue.
these are just federal crimes, mind you.
I've got the District Attorney coming up with his own list.
what does this add up to?
about a hundred years, give or take.
he should be convicted of murder.
luckily, you two have me to pick up the slack when you fall short.
that's right, you should kiss me.
what's wrong with you, Seeley Booth?
on what charge?
Oh, a whole bunch of 'em.
I'm sorry we couldn't get him for killing your sister.
sometimes you gotta just settle for the second best situation.
I'm sorry, too, for how we manipulated you into scratching his face.
it was rational. - Yes.
and yet, irrationally, I still feel bad about it.
the cards say only your top layer is rational.
underneath, you're as crazy as I am.
and that's a compliment.
doesn't sound like one.
this is usually when we go and get a drink.
you two are going to keep doing things as usual.
sometimes you gotta settle for second best.
by the way, my cards tell me this all works out, eventually.
Really? - What all works out eventually?
what? What all works out eventually?
everybody, I've got fresh pineapples!
Hey, back off, sailor.
grabbing the gay guy's coconut boob-- real cool, Dad.
your old man is cool.
right, Nate?
massively cool, Bob.
you're a glacier.
aren't any of these nonalcoholic?
you know, it would do you some good to have a couple drinks, loosen up a little. All due respect, James,
I don't even understand why gays even want to get married.
the same reason we do: family, kids, the American Dream.
exactly.
thank you, Paula.
our house has been on the market for ten months.
nobody wants the American Dream anymore.
Elliot, you're gonna love the 'burbs once we have a couple kids.
what's goin' on?
that's coming from the luau pit.
Hey, Trey, what's that noise?
for God's sake, Bob, he's a gardener, not a servant.
he works for the Homeowner's Association, which means he works for us.
am I wrong?
maybe the, uh, pig's eyeballs explode when it's done.
it shouldn't be done for a couple more hours.
we should check and make sure it's not burning.
all right, stand back.
all right, look out, get back.
this is kosher, right?
Aw, yeah.
Elliot, will you get the meat thermometer?
Oh MY GOD
what, hon?
is that a person?
that's a person!
he's been cooked!
like a security guard?
Parker, hey!
Hi!
the remains we've been called to examine were apparently barbecued.
would you like to see?
Totally! No, no, no.
a person did not get barbecued.
did they, Dr. Brennan?
Yes. In a luau pit, which is why I'm surprised you'd bring Parker along.
no, I-- Rebecca and her boyfriend won a night at the Greenbrier, so little kid's with me.
I got him. Let's go see the cooked person!
geez, you know our deal. Well, what's your deal?
we're not allowed to talk about the bad parts of Dad's work until I have armpit hair.
you don't have any armpit hair last time I checked. Not for a long time, kid.
Angela, would you mind...?
Oh, no, sure.
I get the situation here.
you're with me, Parker.
I want to see the barbecued body.
well, I agree that does sound awesome, but I have face paints that your dad will never be able to get off, no matter how hard he scrubs.
they're basically tattoos.
okay, I'm with you.
you have a good time, all right?
I'll come pick you up in a little bit, all right?
have fun-- fun with the face paints, kid.
Hey, that's not true about the face paint, is it?
you're with me, Baby Booth.
ethnographic studies of the suburbs indicate a cultural impulsion toward overt displays of status.
of course, this competitive paradigm can often result in aggression and violence.
there was this guy on my street who cut his lawn on the diagonal.
the neighbors got angry.
someone set his garage on fire.
Oh, I mean, yards, sidewalks, you know, clean streets, birds flying by.
a dead body in the barbecue pit.
Oh. Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna go talk to the neighbors, to see if anyone who cut their lawn diagonally is missing.
I think those are reflective lenses that have fused to the supra-orbital margin.
Nate and I moved to Verbena Court about six months ago.
the luau pit came with the house.
we installed a lockable cover.
we don't want kids falling in.
we're good neighbors.
who has a key?
uh, just us.
and there's one with the Neighborhood Watch.
okay, uh, who put the pig in the pit?
me, Nate and Trey at 9: 00 this morning.
uh, Trey Jordan.
he's the gardener handyman for the Homeowner's Association.
stop staring at him, James.
you were just talking about him...
guys, guys. When you put the pig in...
we didn't notice anything down there but hot coals.
48 degrees Celsius.
that's, what, an hour after they drenched everything with a garden hose?
wish they hadn't done that.
well, it's human nature, Dr. Brennan.
you see someone on fire, you put 'em out.
prominent brow points to a male.
wear on his mandibular teeth puts his age at about 30 to 35.
we should remove the remains and then let Hodgins get down here.
we have the luau every year.
the pit was dug maybe...
four years ago. July.
same time we planted our hydrangeas.
that reminds me, we should spray.
Yeah, we all helped with the pit.
it's, uh, four feet deep and lined with brick; you burn the wood to embers. You cheat with charcoal.
don't call your dad a cheater, Paige.
anyway, tons of embers going, then you throw down a layer of wet burlap, then wet leaves, then wet burlap, chicken wire, then you lower the pig in and voila.
Yeah, you're forgetting one thing there.
I don't think so. Burlap, leaves...
he means the dead guy under the pig, Dad.
smart one in the family there.
so, what made you crack open the pit early?
we heard little explosions, like fireworks going off.
we found these in the pit.
reflective aviators.
those look like Mr. Bessette's glasses.
Oh, my God.
that's Kurt?
you must be mistaken.
Hey, everybody, looks like it was Kurt.
Oh, my God!
Oh, not Kurt. -Kurt...?!
who's Kurt?
he and his wife live over there.
that was creepy.
I warned you about the suburbs.
and you're certain it's Kurt?
I'm afraid so, Ms. Bessette.
his teeth match the X-rays your dentist provided.
Oh, God...
well, I already told the FBI guy and the scary lady everything I know, so I don't know what...
you mentioned that you and your husband didn't really fit in with the neighborhood.
uh, yeah.
uh, Kurt put up a solar panel and a wind turbine, and it made everybody mad.
they thought they were pretty ugly.
they said they ruined the neighborhood, you know.
but he just wanted to save the planet.
there's nothing wrong with that, right?
no, it's quite a noble cause.
but it can kind of rub people the wrong way sometimes.
when the gay couple's dog peed on the wind turbine,
Kurt gave the dog a laxative that nearly killed him.
well, that... that's not quite so noble.
neighbors don't forget a thing like that.
we got shunned.
found out what caused the mini explosions.
would it have anything to do with the pebbles embedded in the remains?
if by pebbles, you mean the rudaceous sedimentary stratified clast fragments, then yes.
now, based on the amount of pyrites,
I'd estimate the porosity at approximately 25%.
that's ideal for moisture saturation.
meaning the pebbles exploded when they got hot.
the pebbles, as you so quaintly call them, were all found on the same strata as the human remains.
most likely dragged from the murder site.
which explains why they were embedded in the remains.
Yeah.
all consistent in size and color.
decorative, perhaps?
I'll call you back.
these bones are not human.
I assume they're pig.
Yes.
time for prayers?
Yes, but I have a couple of minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Why?
as a Muslim,
I imagine you consider this work unclean.
Yes, well, as a Christian, I imagine you feel the same way.
four femurs, 12 phalanges, dozens of teeth, 12 canines.
luau custom says throw the pig bones back in the pit.
sorry, sorry. Pig bones.
God... I'm fine, Dr. Saroyan.
perhaps the killer assumed his victim's remains would never be noticed amongst the pig bones.
really, Arastoo, there's no reason for you...
I appreciate your concern, but I am fine.
no, really, most of us aren't devout here, and I respect your religion.
he hath forbidden you the flesh of swine, "but if one is forced by necessity, "without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then is he guiltless.
point is, you shouldn't feel forced...
I'm a scientist, okay?
just like the rest of you.
I can deal. So please just back off and let me do my job like anyone else.
Wow.
I apologize for my outburst.
Oh, you aren't even gonna try to un-ring that bell, are you?
I have to pray.
I found the rudaceous sedimentary stratified clast fragment mother lode.
uh, yeah, any signs of a struggle -in the pebbles? -No...
um, I call do-over.
they're covered in blood.
lots of blood.
my friend's dad just got a new girlfriend.
he goes with his dad to her place all the time to swim.
Oh, so he likes her.
well, that's good.
do you have a boyfriend?
no, I'm on a celibacy kick.
it's been five months and nine days, which in celibacy time is 400 years.
what does celibacy mean?
it's, um...
I don't have a boyfriend, no.
how about my dad?
I don't think he has a boyfriend either.
no, he really, really needs a girlfriend.
really. -Why?
to sex up.
that's very succinctly put.
could Dad sex you up?
don't think I haven't considered that, but I'm sort of on the sidelines for now.
but thank you for thinking of me.
okay. Ready?
Mm-hmm.
done.
cool.
how'd you do that?
I'm good.
how MUCH BLOOD DID FUCKER FOUND
plenty.
he estimates a fatal amount.
can you compare the blood to the cooked guy and see if it's his?
he's pretty cooked, but we'll try.
Hodgins also I. D.'d morning glory pollen between the victim's eyeballs and his sunglasses.
how is that relevant?
he said morning glories only bloom after sunup.
sunrise was 5: 47 a. m. so we're close to a time of death.
were you guys aware that Arastoo doesn't really have an accent?
Yeah, he does.
Yeah, it's thicker than Achmed the rug merchant.
was that racist? It sounded racist.
I knew that despite the fact that Arastoo said he was Iranian, his accent was Jordanian.
don't you find it odd that he was faking an Arab accent of any kind?
iranian isn't actually Arab.
what? Bones, it's weird!
now how is it any more odd than, say, shaving your face -or putting on makeup? -I'm not hanging up because
I don't have an answer to that. I'm just hanging up.
but... I had questions about the morning glories.
so, we understand that you and the deceased had an altercation over your dog?
you think that we cooked him because he poisoned our dog?
Kurt did not poison our dog.
Yes, he did.
rocky peed on his stupid windmill, so then he gave our dog chocolate laxatives.
dogs don't react to that the way people do.
it's very difficult to overdose on laxatives.
all that will happen is...
rocky died from cancer.
maybe.
we'll never know because someone wouldn't pay for a doggy autopsy.
Oh, my God. You won't let that go, even though the FBI thinks that we killed Kurt for poisoning our dog.
we don't think that he poisoned our dog.
he does.
now that I think about it... Rocky totally died of cancer.
can you see anything that would explain copious blood loss?
not so far. As you can see, here and here...
can it, bub. It's just you and me here.
this mark here on the scapula suggests a puncture wound.
and it's barely a poke, right?
it would've been painful, but no way it kills the guy.
here we see a bone laceration on the victim's proximal humerus adjacent to the greater tubercle.
staining suggests that the injury occurred before he died.
is that bone splintering?
Yes, micro-fragments.
I believe the laceration's the result of a blow from a reciprocating-type weapon.
like? -A saw.
I asked Dr. Hodgins to swab for particulates that may have been transferred from the blade.
here...
is the stab wound.
and the laceration from the saw.
neither blow's anywhere near a major vein or artery.
neither blow explains the amount of blood on the pebbles.
I ran a metal detector through all the crap we found at the bottom of the pit.
crap?! -Yeah, yeah.
technical term.
bullet.
is that a . 44 caliber?
Yep. This seems to suggest, rather convincingly,
there is a
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait a second.
you and Parker discussed my sex life?
well, we discussed your lack of sex life.
Angela, neither you nor him, especially him, know anything about my sex life.
well, he knows that daddy ain't getting any, and he's concerned.
he thinks you need a girlfriend...
to have sex.
he said that?
well, his exact words were, "To sex up."
I think you need to talk to him honestly about your love life.
you kidding me? No offense, but I'm not talking about that.
hey... What?
want to run our friendly neighborhood suburbanites through the National Gun Permit Database, see if any of them own a . 44?
Hodgins found that in the pit.
Hi, Dr. Saroyan.
do you have a boyfriend?
see? This is exactly how it started with me.
come on. Let's go. Come on.
I gotta get you back home, or your mom's gonna kill me, all right?
let me see this stuff.
does this stuff come off?
Oh, seriously. That's your big worry right now?
I hate Verbena Court.
every last thing about it.
it's artificial, soulless... that's why I'm trying to sell out.
it's ennui, Agent Booth, do you understand that?
looks kind of nice to me. It's good for kids.
they call it a cul-de-sac, but what it is is a dead end.
so why'd you move there in the first place?
wife wants kids; kids want lawns.
here. I got snookered in the math.
right. Thanks.
snookered enough, uh... to snap?
so I own a handgun. So what?
I have a license, it's registered.
we found this bullet in the pit with Bessette's body.
we checked out his bank records.
you wired $5, 000 into his account last month?
Verbena Court was built with a limited amount of phone lines.
Bessette bought them all.
I wanted to put in a second line.
your neighbor charged you $5, 000 for a phone line?
Yup.
then he spent the five grand on putting up the damn windmill.
okay, so he rips you off for five grand, you snap and you shoot him.
no.
I should've shot him.
it wasn't Kurt I shot, though.
I shot the pig.
the luau pig.
excuse me?
Bob Sayles and I found a farm in North Carolina and paid to hunt our own pig.
with a handgun?
I'll give you the name of the farm.
porky walked right up to us.
I popped him one between the eyes.
I barfed, Bob cried.
suburban hunters.
that's an oxymoron, my friend.
it's an oxymoron.
no, no, no, no, you can't just walk in here-- - Arastoo Vaziri, our Muslim intern-- he's been faking his accent.
at first I go where everyone else goes, you know-- terrorist.
wouldn't a terrorist fake not having an accent?
is it crazy or just weird?
weird, I can deal with, but crazy...
wait. What do you want me to do?
Oh, crazy is your department.
they went to a farm and shot an innocent pig in the head?
look, it's not a Federal offense, Bones.
there's nothing we can do about it now, okay?
so let's just focus on the murdered human.
okay, so far, we have a nick on the scapula, suggesting stabbing, and splintering on the humerus, which suggests sawing.
but neither explains bleeding out.
well, Sweets says he has something he'd like to share with us in the conference room.
why does he have to say "share"?
why can't he just say "show"?
what do you have?
Hey. Hey.
suburbanites tend to put too much emphasis on their outward accomplishments.
now, this creates a sense of detachment.
ennui.
very insightful. - That's right.
all right. The inherent uniformity and shared ideals of a planned community suggest that the neighborhood can be psychologically analyzed as a single, dysfunctional personality.
you mean you can look at it anthropologically?
Really? You're gonna shanghai my whole discipline?
you're tapping into what anthropologists call "lines of influence, dominance and suasion."
go on, Sweets. Just let him go on.
so we can look at the community as a single dysfunctional personality, dealing with sexual infidelity, indebtedness, resentment...
that's what I just said. -Both of you-- it's murder, okay?
we're either dealing with money or sex here.
that's what I just said.
and this is where psychology can provide an insight -that anthropology cannot. - I doubt that.
well, suburbanites will not only lie to outsiders, -they'll lie to each other and to themselves. -What Sweets means is that societal norms endemic to the suburban acculturation dichotomize exterior postures and clandestine protocols.
just give me one thing that's gonna help me catch the murderer-- just one thing.
all right, deal with these people as separate elements of a collective personality.
identify the threat that Kurt Bessette posed to their psychological equanimity, and the killer will emerge.
I agree.
it doesn't help me one bit.
Why?
you seriously believe all that hoo-ha?
it's anthropology, so, yes.
wrong "ology." Keep your grubby anthro hands off my psych.
listen, Bones, I'll meet you down in the car in five minutes, okay?
what?
five minutes.
what?
okay, look...
Parker has been asking all the women that I work with to be my girlfriend.
well, the women you work with are beautiful.
don't turn this into a conversation about sex, okay?
my kid is eight years old here.
Parker's pre-adolescent, but he's very concerned with sex.
what he's concerned about are shoes with wheels on them.
there are five stages of psychosexual development:
oral, -anal, phallic... -Whoa!
latent and genital.
now Parker's transitioning from latent to genital.
at the genital stage, he's learning to identify with his gender parent. That's you.
he looking at you to see his sexual future.
how do I get him to stop?
my advice is to let him see you interact with a woman.
easy! -No, not sexually. Socially.
show him you're comfortable with women so he can learn to be the same way.
okay. Okay? Just like that?
you're taking my advice?
no, I just don't want to talk to you about it anymore.
wait. This isn't my office.
don't try to fake romance... -What are you doing?
alibis.
hmm, it's very organized.
at the time of the murder, "Mary Kay Sayles was biking with James Perry and Elliot Lindbergh.
I'm thinking gay guy and 'burb hater' are out biking with church lady.
Oh, so you're thinking they're a sexual threesome?
what? Wow. No. I was just thinking that one of these cyclists was having sex with Kurt Bessette.
Oh. So we should find out where churchy lady's husband and gay guy's boyfriend and 'burb hater's wife were at that time.
Hey, if this turns out to be some suburban-key-party- threesome-revenge-slaying, it's gonna get complicated and I'm gonna get...
Hey, so I finally got through the particulates left behind by the saw.
three different organic remnants on the cut:
a hooked thorn from the Bougainvillea glabra, a haw from a hybrid Crataegus monogyna and nectar from a Syringa protolaciniata.
each plant was from a different yard.
but all on the same reciprocating saw.
Yeah.
? ? ? ? ?
so, my question is, did you kill Kurt Bessette on your own volition or did his wife talk you into it?
what? Bessette was attacked -with your hedge trimmer. - Come on.
young hot suburban gardener, bored suburban housewives.
you're an ethnological trope.
what? Come on, Trey.
iced tea is not the only perk here, is it?
look, I had nothing going with Kurt Bessette's wife.
let me make this a little easier for you, shall we?
which one of these people did you have something going with?
the church lady's daughter.
she's 18, she's legal... and, plus, it was her idea.
And?
Paula Lindbergh-- I think she was trying to get pregnant so her husband would stay in the suburbs.
so, you mind being used as a stud horse?
would you?
do these women know about each other?
not from me.
then from who?
Mr. Bessette caught me and Mrs. Lindbergh sloshing up her hot tub.
where were you between the hours of 5: 00 am and 8: 00 am the morning of the luau?
I've got a girlfriend.
I mean, back in my neighborhood.
a real one who I love. I was with her.
Wow. That cul-de-sac is like a sex camp.
what? There's a sex camp?
no, no, no-- listen, what were your anthropological lines again?
influence, dominance and suasion.
okay, look, we both know that the murder victim wasn't above shaking someone down for a phone line, so maybe he finds out that Paula Lindbergh is trying to make babies with the gardener; he puts the squeeze on her, she kills him and Casanova gardener boy helps out.
definitely fits the paradigm.
I was afraid this would come up when I heard you took Trey in for questioning.
you were right. So start talking.
I should never have made Elliot move to the suburbs.
in a way, I emasculated him.
Oh, God. She's a therapist.
she talks like a therapist.
what? You remove a man from an environment where he flourishes to a place where he feels impotent, he actually becomes impotent.
look, if you wanted a baby so bad, why didn't you just move back to the city?
we owe more on this house than it's worth.
and even if Elliot could sell it, we're stuck financially.
what happened when Kurt Bessette found you with the gardener?
nothing.
he smirked.
did Kurt threaten to tell your husband or blackmail you?
Oh, no. He wouldn't dare. Why not?
wait, you think that Kurt told my husband about the gardener, and so Elliot killed him?
Elliot puked when he shot a pig. Please.
interlocking lines of suasion between members of the collective result in multiple duplicities.
Oh, my God.
she's an anthropologist.
she talks like an anthropologist.
just answer the question.
why wouldn't Kurt Bessette dare tell your husband about the gardener?
I'm a trained therapist.
I looked at Kurt and Paige talking on the street.
I knew immediately that their relationship was clandestine.
probably sexual.
Kurt Bessette was sleeping with that 18-year-old girl.
I used that knowledge to ask for our five grand back for the phone.
Kurt wouldn't have agreed if it weren't true.
if I were you,
I'd be looking at Paige's father for this murder, not my Elliot.
Hey, Dad!
I'm going to kill you!
that never gets old.
okay, yeah, Kurt and I hooked up.
I'm of age.
he didn't break any laws sleeping with me.
so, what did you see in him?
Kurt wasn't like the other guys from here.
he wasn't just cute, he was committed to the environment, saving our planet. People hated him because he made them feel ashamed that they weren't doing more.
I think what they hated was the windmill.
you know, it's possible having sex with you killed him.
no, Kurt was in awesome shape.
no, I didn't mean that you gave him a heart attack.
what I meant was, it's possible that someone who cares about you killed him.
like my Dad, you mean?
or Trey the gardener.
but they didn't even know about Kurt.
well... what if they did?
is this an official FBI investigation?
do I need some kind of representation?
Yeah, the whole accent thing
it's kind of out in the world.
I figured.
this place, the Jeffersonian,
they see things in very black-and-white terms.
comes with the gig. We're scientists.
Yes, but unlike any of them, you're religious.
Muslim.
now, this man I see in front of me right now
rational, pragmatic, highly intelligent
that man might have to explain his religion to people like that every single day.
Whereas...
whereas a kid from the sticks of Iran, newly arrived in the West, it's no wonder he clings to his cultural superstitions.
there you go.
frustrating enough to drive a guy to fake an accent.
which, in my professional opinion, is not crazy.
you're a pretty smart guy.
but I don't need a scientist to tell me who or what I am.
and neither should you, Mr. Vaziri.
thanks for coming by.
thank you.
tox screen came back positive for potassium nitrate, which can be prescribed for high blood pressure...
...but Kurt Bessette was in very good shape.
Yes, we heard that from his teenage girlfriend.
enough to kill the guy?
Nope. He might have experienced some muscle weakness, but otherwise saltpeter is fairly harmless.
saltpeter is not harmless, okay?
I went to Catholic school.
that's a total myth, Booth.
no, Booth did actually go to a Catholic school.
no, no, no, the nuns-- used to put saltpeter in all the boys' milk at lunch so that we couldn't get...
so we could concentrate without...
you know!
Ping?
but how could you tell that it was in the boys' milk and not the girls'?
cause the boys' milk was always frothier.
and did it work?
well, not on me.
well, it didn't work on anyone, Booth.
why people insist upon believing that old wives' tale in the face of all evidence,
I'll never understand.
saltpeter acts as a blood thinner.
see? Thin blood could stop a guy from...
we've been saying that the two wounds we found on the victim's body wouldn't be enough for him to bleed out.
but with saltpeter, he could have bled internally from even minor soft tissue damage.
we'd never have seen the evidence of that after he cooked.
we got a probable cause of death.
now we just need to find out who fed Kurt Bessette the saltpeter.
I think you'll want to talk to the cheating bastard's wife.
I begged Kurt to stop cheating on me.
I did everything I could in the bedroom to make him stay.
I changed my hair. I went to the gym.
but when I went to work every day, it was a "cat's away, mice play" situation.
where did you get the saltpeter?
Oh. Um...
Nate and James have stump remover.
and that's 98% saltpeter.
I figured that might be enough to remove Kurt's stump from her garden.
who else knew he was cheating?
nobody.
unless her husband found out.
husband?
with the church lady, too.
do you think her husband is capable of murder?
Bob? No.
he's just a big dumb-ass knob who thinks Verbena Court is Heaven.
that was before he knew the neighbor was having sex with both his wife and his daughter.
I don't care how big of a dumb-ass Bob Sayles is.
he finds that out, he's going to want to kill her husband.
how did you find out about me and Kurt?
only the two of us knew and-and Kurt's dead.
you were not the only person that Kurt Bessette was sleeping with.
you mean, aside from his wife?
so I wasn't his only...
well, who? Who else?
he was sleeping with your daughter Paige.
you can understand why you were a suspect here.
Yes.
people kill out of jealousy.
I guess it won't matter if I deny it.
uh, but you're not our prime suspect.
you see, you have an alibi.
you were out biking with James Perry and Elliot Lindbergh.
so you think Kelly found out and killed her own husband?
my God, she's only 18.
you think my Bob found out and killed Kurt?
I found evidence of a homogenous mixture of oily and waxy long-chain, which are non-polar hydrocarbons in, uh, this fracture of the skull.
can't you just say lubricant?
isn't that much quicker?
Arastoo must be finished looking at the mini-fractures in that area, right?
where is he?
sorry.
sorry, I just finished morning prayers.
skull fracture is located high on the frontal bone, right on the midline.
Whoa!
who are you?
I don't have an accent.
I was faking it.
but I am devout.
I do pray five times a day.
now can we get back to work, please?
Oh, no. Definitely not.
how do we know you're not faking this accent?
does Brennan know about this?
Yes. She doesn't care.
she doesn't care.
the midline fracture...
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Arastoo, things will go a lot faster if you just explain.
when I speak as though I just got off the boat, people accept my religious convictions.
Plus, fewer terrorist jokes.
I don't know why. - 'Cause they're afraid of you."
you are so going to pay for this. - Yeah.
I have no doubt that is true.
now, this wound has a distinctive curve shape to it.
it doesn't look very severe.
corresponding microfractures to the posterior cranium indicate that Kurt was hit while resting his head on a hard surface.
so, a weak blow that was delivered when Kurt was already on the ground?
there's a concrete base on the wind turbine.
Bob Sayles is a big, burly man.
Yeah, but he's a decent guy.
well, what does that have to do with it?
decent guys, you know.
they have a harder time hitting a guy when they're already down on the ground.
so, not a weak blow, a half-hearted one?
this mark here could be congruent with a golf club.
it's curved and metallic.
I could run up an image.
most clubs have a brazing composition to secure the titanium alloy that's on the club head.
I can check on that.
so a reciprocating saw, a golf-club with some lubricant.
that just leaves the puncture weapon unidentified.
it takes a village, Bones.
uh, I beg your pardon?
a village to raise a kid properly.
you know, it takes a village.
but metaphorically; it doesn't mean we all must grow up in hamlets of 800 people or less.
Thanks, um... Will you be my village?
huh?
I-I need Parker to know that I lead a full and rewarding life.
but you don't. -What?
Yes, I do. - No, you don't.
you work too much, you don't socialize, all of which prevents you from having a full sex life.
okay, please, let's just take a hint from, you know, the suburbs and just make it look good.
you want to know if I'll help you fool your son into thinking your life is gratifying?
Yeah. Will you do it?
well, how?
come to dinner with us.
have fun. Laugh at my jokes.
that might actually turn out to be fun, thus becoming a self-fulfilling desire.
right. So, you'll do it?
Yes, I will be your hamlet of 800 people or less.
my village.
I was being amusing.
you should laugh at my jokes, too.
I'm laughing on the inside.
Hey, so I just told
Bob Sayles that both his wife and daughter were having sex with Kurt Bessette.
was he shocked? -Yeah, and he wasn't faking it.
well, you shouldn't say that like it's a fact.
in my opinion, his dismay was genuine.
however, it's difficult to say whether the shock was due to the sexual revelations or if we discovered information he was keeping secret.
I appreciate the distinction.
hold on to that for a second.
you do the best you can, you know?
you go to work, you bring home the bacon, you raise a daughter.
either of you got daughters?
well, that's the trip, man-- daughters.
I was so worried about Paige and that gardener kid,
I didn't see what was happening with Kurt.
but, I mean, what do you do, preach abstinence?
doesn't work in Alaska; why would it work on Verbena Court?
did you suspect anything about your wife?
I gotta confess...
if I'd have known any of that, I'd have killed the son of a bitch, bare hands.
and there's not a jury in this country that would convict me, either. That is untrue.
they most certainly would have convicted you.
you don't have an alibi?
I was home alone, sleeping in, after getting that pig pit all dug and ready and lit.
why would Mary Kay do this to me?
I've been a good husband, good provider.
I took two jobs.
two jobs?
we only have you down as a CPA for an airline.
Yeah, well, me and Kurt started a side business on the Internet.
you and Kurt Bessette had a business together?
Yep.
it was going good, too.
can you continue the business without him?
Nah. No way.
he was the entrepreneur.
I just handled the books.
what kind of business was it?
the only kind that's recession-proof.
sex toys.
guy goes into the sex toy business with another guy, who commences to nail his wife...
and daughter.
probably using some of the merchandise here to double the fun, huh, Bones?
bones, looks like we found the lubricant.
Oh... my God.
please tell me this has something to do with the case.
this comprises the contents of the Sayles' family garage.
Brennan asked me and Arastoo to look for possible murder weapons.
we did find the lube-- it's enough to make the whole neighborhood smile.
and there's this.
well, that looks... scary.
wasn't a golf club.
no brazing agent or titanium.
could it have been this?
Oh. Ouch.
what about this lubricant? - No, it's not the right lube.
the lubricant in the fracture contains hexane silicone, mineral oil and propellant.
same kind used to lubricate a bicycle chain.
I think I found the weapon.
this point matches the puncture wound.
there's one of those signs on every lawn on the cul-de-sac. Bob Sayles was the head of the Neighborhood Watch.
he's the one that distributed signs.
huh. You're gonna need to luminol every sign on Verbena Court.
you're gonna tell me to stop looking through all of this stuff now, -aren't you? -I'm afraid so.
I'll go tell Booth about the lube.
spoilsport.
finding likely murder weapons way too fast.
any blood, Hodgins?
nothing?
booth. -Yeah?
we're testing positive for blood here.
someone stabbed him with his own sign.
curved, metallic object
I thought might be a golf club?
her shoes.
silicone lubricant.
you kicked Kurt Bessette in the head while he was lying in the pebbles.
you were with James Perry and Elliot Lindbergh that morning.
the three of you each gave him a separate blow.
any one of you could have taken the saw from the gardener's truck. And the sign from his lawn.
we have alibis.
you're each other's alibis.
all three of you were together at the time of death.
your alibi just turned into an anti-alibi.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
take these three into custody, please.
Yes, sir!
got it!
hands behind your back now.
right now! Let's go!
three separate injuries to the body and... three suspects.
access to the luau pit.
the evidence indicates that we caught the murderers.
Yeah, I believe you did catch the right people.
okay, then what's your problem?
motive. James Perry was angry that Kurt poisoned the dog.
Elliot Lindbergh was ripped off for $5, 000.
right. My problem is, all these motives were a long time cooking, right?
these weapons
a sign, the hedge trimmers, kicking him
all suggest... heat of the moment, right?
not premeditation.
so you want to know why they all snapped at that precise moment.
Yeah, yeah. Now, picture it:
it's dawn; three cyclists are heading out.
they spot Kurt.
they approach him for some reason.
they argue, and then, with all this pent-up rage, they attack.
one slice, one jab, one kick.
they didn't know that he was full of the blood thinner, that he would die from the assault.
why does this matter?
we already have the people responsible.
cause it's knowledge, Dr. Brennan.
it's insight into humans.
it's why I do what I do.
it's a good answer, Bones.
it was a good answer.
fine. Okay, Kurt must have violated some ethos of the suburbs.
like cheating on his wife or ripping off his neighbors.
those are all accepted derivations of the suburban ethos.
cam said that one of her neighbors had his garage burned down for cutting his lawn on the diagonal.
the windmill.
it was the last straw.
it's ugly, makes a horrible sound, destroys home values
it's the diagonal lawn of Verbena Court.
okay, this is basically vodka with a very, very subtle hint of pepper.
none for me.
okay, it's technically illegal moonshine, but we are scientists honing our craft.
I don't drink alcohol. Okay, let's have it.
have what? -How do you balance an archaic religious belief with a life devoted to science?
this discussion is exactly what I hoped to avoid.
it's not our fault you let the accent slip.
there's no conflict between Allah and science.
Allah created the mystery of the world, and science struggles, and mostly fails, to explain it.
but the search for truth is honorable, and I honor Allah through the search for truth.
I get that.
but what's with the "Kill the infidel" routine?
it's times like this I wish I drank alcohol.
well, "Fight and slay the unbeliever."
I prefer the other option, which is to enslave the unbeliever.
it's a joke.
that was funny.
is this part done?
not quite. I have one more question.
if you took the all-time greatest Celtics players and put them against the all-time greatest Lakers, who would win?
including the years when the Lakers played in Minneapolis?
definitely the Celtics.
okay, I got one, I got one.
pit the all-time greatest Christians against the all-time greatest Muslims.
Oh, you just got smote.
Wow.
this is fun.
isn't it fun?
Yes. I'm having fun.
is he?
bones, you can ask him yourself.
Hey.
are you having fun? Milk shakes are fun, and I'm having a milk shake, so, yeah, I'm having fun.
that's an excellent syllogism.
she thinks I'm silly?
What-what's wrong?
he needs a girlfriend.
well, why doesn't he have one? I don't know.
that's another thing we can't talk about until I have hair under my arms.
I got a good idea: what do you say we all go bowling, get out of here, huh? Couldn't you be his girlfriend?
buddy, you really gotta quit that.
that would be inappropriate.
Why? Because...
...we work together.
that's a stupid reason. You know what?
bones, I'm really not comfortable with the questions that you're asking. Booth, could you maybe trust me for a second, trust that I can say the right thing?
in the time that I've been with you,
I've learned a lot about how to deal with people.
your father is very, very good with people.
then why doesn't he have a girlfriend?
and we're off.
okay. All right, all right.
can I ask you a question?
why do you think your father needs a girlfriend so much?
okay, look, Bones, there's a whole gender-parent dealy-bob thing going on here.
you're just going to confuse him.
so I can have a pool.
he doesn't sound confused.
a pool?
Lasky's dad got a pool with his girlfriend.
Oh, you mean Lasky with the, uh, third nostril?
Lasky's dad got a girlfriend.
then, they got married and moved to a house with a pool.
maybe, if you got married, you'd move to a house with a pool that I could swim in.
well, he seems extremely clear on why he wants you to get a girlfriend.
I don't know why you didn't just ask him.
so, the whole reason you wanted me to get a girlfriend was so that you could have a pool?
Mm-hmm. Why else would I care?
there is a pool in my building...
that the two of you can use as my guests anytime.
awesome. That's awesome, right, Dad?
no, not awesome.
simple Socratic method of solving a problem.
Nope.
Parker is right.
you're awesome, Bones.
Yeah.
I'm awesome.
Cheers.
sweetie, could you stop galloping for, like, two seconds?
better able to withstand peer pressure when you can't catch me.
call it a favor, okay?
how does me going to a company Christmas party do you a favor?
remember what happened last year?
I didn't go last year.
Yeah, exactly, And it took me weeks to collect all those photocopies.
I need you,Friends don't let friends photocopy their butts at company Christmas parties.
Hey, there's a Secret Santa.
I don't like Secret Santa.
the idea that we are forced by convention to exchange meaningless gifts.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
if you rearranged "Secret Santa" though, you get "Secret Satan."
what possible meaning could that have?
I've already had an eggnog, if you can't tell.
now how am I going to enjoy this party knowing that my best friend in the whole world is in the lab, eyeball to eyeball with Skeletor.
who?
he's a cartoon villain who looks like a...
you know, his name is self-explanatory.
would you please just come to this party?
20 minutes.
bones.
all right.
merry Christmas, Seeley.
what are you, an elf?
Yes,What's wrong with a little Christmas spirit?
what's the context?
federal property on Dupont Circle where Congress puts up visiting agricultural specialists or something like that, they're digging to put in a solarium, and they find a fallout shelter with a skeleton inside.
how long was it in there?
the shelter was built in the 50s, part of that whole A-bomb panic.
it's not a suicide,Why not?
hole in the head, you see the gun.
it's a suicide.
he shoots himself in the head and somehow his arm ends up across his chest?
bring the skeleton in,
I'll prove it wasn't a suicide.
merry Christmas, Bones.
come on, boys, bring it in.
Oh, no, we're going to the company Christmas party.
you go ahead, I'll do a cursory examination and I'll meet you in a few minutes.
all right.
there you go.
booth, will you escort Angela to the Christmas party and make sure she doesn't photocopy her butt?
Oh, no, I can't do that.
you see, I got some really last minute important Christmas shopping that I got to do.
it's not last minute until tomorrow.
come on, Bones.
bones...
just... I got to...
jeez.
stop.
stop.
turn.
your robot reminds me of you.
you tell it to turn, it stops.
you tell it to stop, it turns.
you ask it to take out the garbage, it watches reruns of Firefly.
after I fix the voice recognition protocols, this is going to blow those gomers at MIT away.
Hey, we've got about half a liter of pure alcohol here.
dump it in the eggnog, and we've got the best Christmas party in history.
I brought an eggnog.
I can't drink while I work.
good thing I didn't bring it for you.
crystal in accounting is after you, isn't she?
Oh, like Alien after Predator.
sit.
what do you got there?
two open tickets to Paris.
one way.
pan Transit Airlines.
they're blank.
pan Transit went out of business in the 60s.
I thought you were at the party.
it wasn't a party, it was a Star Wars convention.
this was still in the skull.
22 caliber.
it matches the gun he was holding.
did you open up the suitcase?
no, Why not?
could hold information that would compromise my objectivity.
Yeah, like a name and address?
I prefer to make unbiased, initial observations.
is that pure alcohol?
Yes, Dr. Brennan.
you really think Goodman's going to let you spike the eggnog after the Fourth of July fiasco?
we may have to rethink.
Zack, I need you to clean these bones.
now?
ha! Burned.
and I need you to search the clothing for insect evidence.
jeez, Bones, Merry Christmas.
MONTENEGRO: Okay.
you people listen to me.
there is a party going on upstairs, okay?
a Christmas party, We're going up there.
we're going to talk to some people, we're going to sing some carols, we're going to drink some eggnog.
you are going to kiss me under the mistletoe.
on the lips.
I might kiss you guys under the mistletoe, too.
maybe even you.
in a festive, non-lesbian manner.
but we are going to that party.
put on a mask, I'm going to take a couple core samples.
okay.
what's that?
biological contamination.
okay.
the doors seal automatically.
don't worry about it.
what do you mean don't worry about it?
there's no use panicking until we know what it is.
what what is?
uh, we might know.
I cut into the fallout shelter bones and the biohazard alarm went off.
were you conforming to autopsy protocol?
one of us was.
the other was drinking an eggnog.
and you didn't have your mask on?
Oh.
that pathogen is coccidioidomycosis.
valley fever?
it was picked up in the scanner in the discharge vent at Mr. Addy's station.
what's valley fever?
it's a fungus that can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, spontaneous abortion...
death.
the alarm sounded shortly after Mr. Addy cut into a human bone. That must've been the source.
was he following autopsy protocol?
of course. However...
I was drinking an eggnog.
and now he's there with you breathing the same air.
Hey, I got into the decontamination shower with Zack.
haven't I been through enough hell?
is he contagious?
Dr. Hodgins may have inhaled the spores, yes.
okay, it must suck to be Hodgins right now, but the rest of us, we didn't inhale.
so it's okay that I go, right?
Dr. Hodgins may have exhaled the spores all over us.
we have no choice but to impose quarantine.
valley fever can be fatal and we can't risk a pandemic.
just calm down and let us handle things from this side.
anyone besides me worried that a guy dressed like Santa is in charge?
merry Christmas.
okay, you know what, if this is fatal.
I will shoot both of you.
maybe you guys
I zapped the bones with ultraviolet light and arranged them in the isolation tables so we won't have to worry about spores.
in addition, I found this sewn into the lining of his clothing.
a woman's wedding band.
two tickets to Paris, a wedding band...
a picture begins to form.
we don't form pictures, we accumulate evidence.
dental work?
acrylic resins in the interior fillings from the 1940s.
childhood tibia break, bad enough that he walked with a limp.
also, he wore a toupee.
doesn't seem to have degraded.
it's made of a synthetic called dynel.
it couldn't have looked good.
this is a cocktail of four anti-fungal drugs including Amphotericin B fluconazole, and itraconazole.
that's great. Then we can leave?
we won't know for a couple of days if the fungus took hold in your system.
whoa, whoa, you're saying that we're stuck here over Christmas?
look, you know, I have.
places to go, you know, I have obligations.
we all have obligations.
I'm supposed to go to Quebec.
Hey, who's fault is this?
who forced me to go the party where I drank too much and had to hide from Crystal?
who never should've cut into a bone with a drunken fool in the room?
who brought us human remains just to ditch a little paperwork?
Oh, wait, you're saying that this is my fault?
you knew Dr. Brennan could not resist.
well, I'd have been able to resist
you're blaming me?
ladies and gentlemen, we'll have sleeping bags delivered.
please have your loved ones call me and we'll set up some kind of safe quarantine visit on Christmas Eve.
Oh, and be prepared for side effects.
nausea, fever, insomnia?
in very rare cases, euphoria, dream state, mild hallucinations.
I'll take that, please.
early symptoms mimic a common cold.
what if it manifests?
first treatment protocol involves extremely painful injections into the base of the brain.
you know what?
I've never realized
that is so not fair.
tomorrow I was supposed to leave for Quebec.
want to know the true meaning of Christmas?
it's being inside a 300-year-old inn with a French-Canadian masseuse when there's ten feet of snow outside.
Christmas is going home to Michigan and heading into the woods with your brothers to cut a 12-foot Christmas tree, and you all decorate it together, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews...
40 people who all love you and are happy to see you.
that, my friend, is the true meaning of Christmas.
Nah, I'm going to have to go with the masseuse on this one.
what are those little tiny lights dancing on the ceiling?
for the third time, those are minute firings of neurons on your optic nerve due to your reaction to the antifungal cocktail.
they're beautiful.
you are stoned, Agent Booth.
Oh, good.
let's hope it lasts long enough to keep this from being the worst Christmas of my life.
what are you complaining about?
I don't like to boast, but I am the spirit of Christmas in my house.
I have a wife and twin five-year-old daughters.
we have family traditions, the most important of which is being together for Christmas.
Wow. They're beautiful.
Yeah.
I have a kid, too.
his name's Parker.
he's four years old.
his mother wouldn't marry me, so my parental rights are totally...
vague?
that word's just a little bit more Christmassier than what I was thinking.
he's a fine looking boy.
Yeah, I get him part of Christmas day.
I get him an excellent present every year.
something really cool.
but, uh, this year...
Yeah, it's... this year.
what are those little lights on the ceiling?
I know it's against your nature, but I need your help.
for what?
to make Christmas.
Why? Because we're the girls?
Yes.
we have to decorate and we have to make our own Secret Santa.
you called it Secret Satan before.
it's all so tragic.
a cheap wedding ring sewn into a suit, two tickets to Paris.
it makes you wonder, who was the girl?
can you imagine what it was like for her?
waiting and wondering?
never knowing what happened?
I don't have to imagine.
what do you mean?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do for Christmas.
good. Thank you.
at last you decide to take part.
I'm going to solve a murder.
bones.
it's after midnight. Hmm?
Christmas Eve day.
both an eve and a day, it's a Christmas miracle.
still enjoying your medication, I see.
okay, so, what are we looking at.
there are traces of lead and nickel in the dead guy's osteological profile.
you don't seem too upset about missing Christmas.
indications are that Christ, if he existed, was born in the late spring and that the celebration of his birth was shifted to coincide with the pagan rite of the winter solstice so that early Christians weren't persecuted.
Mmm. What are you like the Christmas killer?
it's the truth.
well, it sounds like the truth cause it's so rational, right, but, you know, the true truth is that you just...
you hate Christmas, so you just spout out all these facts and you ruin it for everyone else.
I ruin the true truth with facts?
Yeah, and you ruin it for the squint squad, too, by making them work on a case about a guy who's been sealed up in a fallout shelter for 50 years.
okay, how would you like me to spend my Christmas?
Christmas is the perfect time to reexamine your standing with, you know...
a helicopter pilot?
Oh, right, right.
you can't measure the man upstairs in a beaker, so he can't possibly exist.
the man upstairs?
Mmm. You know, you don't know if you're sick, but you're more than willing to take drugs just in case.
seems to me you could give the man upstairs the same benefit of the doubt that you do an invisible fungus.
in some cases of valley fever, suppurating skin lesions appear.
could someone in a position of responsibility please order Zack to shut up?
coffee, coffee.
good morning, Ms. Montenegro.
where did this come from?
uh, hazmat team brought it over earlier this morning.
very... appetizing.
are you back with us?
Yeah. Think so.
since we're going to be stuck together for Christmas, we should make the most of it.
how?
we'll decorate this place and exchange handmade gifts.
an excellent idea, Ms. Montenegro.
I can get behind that.
I'm in. As am I.
how about Bones?
Mmm. Uh-uh.
Ah, come on. What's the deal with Bones and Christmas?
last night,
I spun a little story about two young lovers running off to Paris.
but the man never shows up, and the woman is left wondering what happened to him.
and I say, "Imagine what that must have been like.
and Brennan says, "I don't have to.
Yeah, I，I still don't get it.
Oh, my God.
what?
Brennan's parents disappeared just before Christmas when she was 15.
and she never knew what happened to them.
Oh, God. That explains a lot.
Yeah. All right.
we need a way to choose our Secret Santas.
I could build a random generator.
wouldn't it be better to match complimentary people in a premeditated manner?
I got five numbers in my head and five letters.
you tell me the number, I tell you the matching letter.
well, are the letters sequential, or the numbers sequential?
six. There's no six.
a" through "E" and one through five?
just pick a name, and if you get your own, put it back in.
Oh. that could work.
Yeah. That's good.
feds seized the house from a man named Gil Atkins in the 60s.
proceeds of crime from fencing, dealing in jewels, stolen art.
atkins built a fallout shelter in '51.
he sealed it in '58 and he died in '83.
what do you got?
Ah, nothing much special about our victim.
you know about the toupee?
below average height, below average weight.
a little frail.
had a bad back.
he had a hunch, maybe from paperwork.
so basically a wimp.
contents of his pockets.
Oh, compass, pen knife, some change.
listen, I got Goodman for this Secret Santa thing and I don't know what.
anthropologically speaking, gifts are a way of asserting dominance in a group.
now, imagine an entire holiday devoted to self promotion, especially in this materialistic culture.
how can you expect me to get behind that?
how can you get behind it?
Wow. That's deep.
that's a very deep pile of crap.
you came to me with information this morning, a peace offering, but it was to make you feel better, not me.
proves my point.
any idea what this is?
no.
me neither.
try Dr. Goodman.
you know, Bones, you make it very, very hard for me to be nice to you.
we have to be extremely creative.
maybe string a bunch of test tubes together, fill them with luminescent liquids.
nice. Very festive.
that would be fitting this Christmas.
tidings of joy, gentlemen.
tidings of joy.
decorations do not a Christmas make.
family and friends make Christmas.
we're friends.
or not friends.
we are colleagues, friends, coworkers, yes, but for a father like myself, like Agent Booth, a few glowing test tubes don't make up for missing Christmas morning with the children.
excuse me.
be kind, Rewind.
booth has a kid?
Ah. Well. Not common knowledge, I gather.
I, uh... see you've decided to help Dr. Brennan with the case.
Oh. You know, if Angela's right, sure. Why not?
and... something for Bones.
call it Christmas spirit.
my thoughts exactly.
um... I thought I might take a look at the contents of the suitcase with you.
Why?
it beats cobbling together Christmas decorations out of pipettes and graduated cylinders.
no, I mean, what makes you qualified to look at clues?
well, I'm an archaeologist.
I，I'm good with artifacts.
do you mind?
no. Archaeologist?
I thought you were an administrator.
Yeah, didn't start out that way.
he was fastidious.
everything neatly folded as though by a trained valet.
this man was by no means wealthy.
all the clothing is well used and mended.
see that? "Blackman and Ball, Fine Tailors.
washington, D. C.
rest of his clothes are all labeled from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
huh.
female handwriting.
how'd you get that?
after cuneiform, handwriting is a snap.
dearest Lionel.
no envelopes, no return address.
no signature, either. Just this drawing of a leaf.
they seem to be dated from summer of 1957 through to early winter of 1958.
with your permission, I'll read these.
Yeah.
bones thought you might know what this is here.
Oh. Hey, Rebecca.
Yeah, thanks for calling.
you heard what happened, right?
seems to be some kind of a pouch.
you don't have to see me.
Sid agreed to bring him by.
don't make me beg.
thank you.
everything all right?
Yeah.
puparia show Lionel had Valley Fever.
we sort of knew that.
Wow. Was that a shot?
because I apologized.
I mean, Goodman doesn't get to see his family.
Zack doesn't get to see his kids.
booth doesn't get to see his son.
at least I'm an accidental Grinch.
all due respect, you're the Grinch on purpose.
I have no idea what you're saying to me.
the Grinch is the relatively well-known creation of a children's author named Dr. Seuss.
listen, I got Angela for my Secret Santa thing, and what I want to do is blow up a microscopic image of a toxic mold-- Stachybotrys chartarum
because I know she's very interested in fractal imagery.
I thought that might appeal to her aesthetically.
do you agree? I'm not really who you want to talk to about gifts.
Wait,Booth has a kid?
you didn't know? No.
I wasn't the one who told you.
fall, 1958.
heavy weight suit.
kind of small, wool, black.
first name, Lionel. That's all I got.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
you know, it being Christmas Eve and all, I'll hold.
Lionel had a suit here made in town.
the tailor shop, it still exists.
his grandson owns it.
get this-- they kept the records.
we may be able to find Careful Lionel's last name.
careful Lionel?
Yeah.,Little guy, toupee.
drank a vitamin tonic.
carried his own compass, all of this stuff just so.
careful Lionel.
what was he so worried about? Well, considering how he ended up.
wait, you have a son?
Yeah.
you've never mentioned that.
well, nothing brings people together like a Christmas lung fungus.
Yes. That's great!
when?
great. Thank you. Merry Christmas.
okay, he picked up his new suit on November 7, 1958. He paid cash.
he was supposed to come back the next day for his shirt, but get this: he never showed up.
it was his wedding shirt.
Whoa! Bless you.
Uh-oh.
is that a cold, or Valley Fever?
bones?
so, so, if Lionel was a coin collector, that might explain the levels of lead and nickel in his bones.
when do they insert the needle into your brain?
I sneezed because the air is dry.
it's not valley fever.
any other symptoms? Headache?
any foul-smelling pustules on your shins?
look, she sneezed twice, that's it.
you find anything else about the letters?
quite a lot, yes.
they are very, very passionate love letters.
careful Lionel had a girlfriend?
a girlfriend who was in trouble. Pregnant in trouble?
whoa. Apparently, Careful Lionel wasn't so careful.
an unmarried pregnant girl?
in Oklahoma,In the late '50s?
do you suppose Lionel came up here to procure an abortion?
you know what? This isn't a very Christmas-Eve-type story.
of course it is.
the Christ myth is built upon the travails of an unwed mother.
okay, can we just stop bringing up the whole "Christ Myth" thing?
all right, some people believe it's more than just a myth.
well, who besides you?
GOODMAN: That would be me, Dr. Brennan.
I'm a deacon at my church.
I do.
Christmas and Easter, anyway.
although I believe organized religion is just another political movement designed to control the masses, it doesn't mean God doesn't love me.
Hey, I'm a rational empiricist all the way.
unless you talk to my mother, then I'm Lutheran.
I can understand why you'd be sensitive, Booth.
you have a child out of wedlock.
what?
um, the letters display a combination of both block and cursive.
a combination of printing and writing?
it would indicate she may have left school some time in the second grade.
most white children in those days would attain at least an eighth grade education.
she was African-American?
why, I believe so, yes.
is there any way Lionel was African-American?
no, no, he's definitely Caucasian.
a white man and a pregnant black girl in 1958 Oklahoma?
that was bad?
it was illegal.
in Oklahoma?
not just Oklahoma, here in D. C.
then why come here?
they were running away.
Lionel had two tickets to Paris.
where else in 1958 could a white man and a black woman get married and live together?
visiting hours, folks.
who's first?
well, as director of this institution,
I claim that right.
okay, brief announcement.
you guys might recognize my dad, but I don't really want to talk about it.
so, thanks.
okay. Let's go.
you like it?
it's very beautiful.
it's not done yet.
we can put our presents under there, and we can.
you think it's stupid.
no, Ange.
what were your Christmas plans?
my Dad and I get together somewhere quiet, exchange gifts, just the two of us.
since I was a kid, getting some time alone with my Dad was always difficult.
so what is it with you and gifts anyway?
I know your parents disappeared just before Christmas.
my brother, Russ, was 19, and we were still in the house.
that must have been strange.
Russ found our presents in my parents' room and Christmas Eve, when I was asleep.
he snuck down and made Christmas, trying to do the right thing for me.
Christmas for his little sister.
but when I came down and saw the lights and the presents.
you thought your parents were back.
I just expected to see them sitting there drinking their coffee, watching Russ and me open our presents.
Oh, my God.
I kind of lost it.
I refused to open the presents until they came back.
it was like I told Russ he wasn't enough family for me.
before New Year's, he went out West to work and I was in the foster system.
excuse me.
we have Lionel's missing person's file.
the tree is really, really beautiful, Ange.
really.
BOOTH: Lionel Little, born May 19, 1934, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
24 years old.
fits the remains.
according to the missing person's report, lodged by his boss in January of 1960,
Lionel Little worked as a lease inspector for Silver Cloud Petroleum out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
basically an accountant.
Yeah. You know what, you were right about Lionel's coin collection.
when Lionel vanished, so did most of his extensive coin collection.
that was attached to the file.
did the coins ever show up?
Yeah. Through D. C, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania.
the sales were traced to Gil Atkins.
Yeah, she made about $8, 000 selling those coins.
atkins killed Lionel for a coin collection?
$8, 000 in 1958 translates to roughly $64, 000.
careful Lionel gets a young black girl pregnant.
he sells his coin collection so he can move them to Paris and they can live together.
hmm, he offers the coins for sale to Atkins, who figures it'll be easier to kill the country bumpkin and steal the coins.
Oh, also, um, the last person to see Lionel was the woman who cleaned his office, Ivy Gillespie.
what's the significance of that?
does, uh, does this look like an ivy leaf to you?
race, Negro.
Oh, my God.
you have to find her.
Ivy Gillespie may not even be alive.
and if she is, this could be a reminder of an extremely painful time of her life.
what would we accomplish?
you have to find the girl and tell her what you know.
don't you see?
you can give her the answer that you never got.
I'm sorry, sweetie, but it's true.
you have a chance here.
to say what? "Merry Christmas, Ivy Gillespie."
your fianc was murdered "and your life was ruined, but hey, at least you get to know what happened to him.
don't you wish somebody had said that to you?
I realize it's Christmas Eve, but it's extremely important that I find Ms. Ivy Gillespie.
we know that she was a cleaning lady at the Silver Cloud Petroleum in 1958 and 1959.
after that, we don't know.
brennan: I wouldn't interrupt your Christmas, except this is very, very important to a friend of mine.
I don't want to take time from your family, but I have extremely important news for Ms. Gillespie regarding a loved one.
do you have an address or a place of work ,or anything?
I've made dozens of calls this evening in an effort to track this woman down, and it's that important.
assisted living?
is her last name still Gillespie?
Yes, yes. Merry Christmas to you, too.
hello.
Yes, I was wondering if you could tell me if you have any guests there, first name Ivy, born January 21, 1934?
she'd be African-American.
Yes, I apologize.
I should have started with "Merry Christmas."
brennan: Date of birth is January 21, 1934.
she's African-American.
Yes, Ivy.
her name is still Gillespie.
Yes, if her granddaughter is right there.
Yes, hello, I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institution in D. C.
I have information that might be very interesting to your grandmother.
I can be reached through the Medico Legal Lab here at the Jeffersonian.
and tell her Merry Christmas.
you found Ivy Gillespie.
in an assisted-living facility near Bethesda.
I spoke to her granddaughter.
thank you.
she might not get in touch with us.
she will.
because it's Christmas?
Yes.
did you find something?
two things that fit together.
angela sent me. She says it's Christmas.
okay. You still think there's more to learn about Lionel Little and Ivy Gillespie?
there's always more to learn.
Hey.
I'm sorry you didn't get Christmas morning with your little boy.
Thanks.
good.
okay, everybody.
stand over here.
close your eyes.
open your eyes.
are you listening? Merry Christmas.
Wow，Well done!
Oh, my God.
it's beautiful,What is it?
it's prettier if you don't know the details.
that is beautiful. Thank you.
Oh, my.
very impressive.
you made this? Yeah.
thank you.
I'm next.
it's from me.
it's my family.
and me.
thank you. You're welcome.
Scarabaeus sacer. Sacred scarab.
that is excellently rendered, sir,Thank you.
you're very welcome.
Zack, that's a...
ZACK: Self-propelled, non-autonomic unit.
it's a robot.
I thought if we get out of here in time today, you could give it to your son.
listen, Bones, here's the thing.
what if a gift goes both ways?
what's wrong with that?
look at this.
Yeah, it's a penny.
it's not just a penny, it's a 1943 bronze one-cent piece.
look, all I'm saying is that maybe the real gift is when you accept something with a little grace.
over a billion pennies were minted in 1943, most of them in steel to conserve copper for World War II, but...
a handful were struck in an old-style bronze planchet.
only about 12 of them exist today.
Wow. And this is one of them?
Yes.
huh. How much is it worth?
over $100, 000.
Lionel never showed Gil Atkins the best part of his collection.
atkins murdered him, and never knew there was a... fortune in his pocket.
well, it looks like Careful Lionel got the last laugh.
GOODMAN: Ready?
time for our test results.
green. Green. Uh, is that green as in "go."
or green as in "stick a needle in your brain"?
merry Christmas.
Oh.
go. Go have Christmas.
wish your boy a merry Christmas from me.
I'm at Wong Foo's if you decide you want company.
merry Christmas, Bones.
woman: Excuse me?
Hi.
my name is Lisa Pearce, and this is my grandmother, Ivy Gillespie.
are you Dr. Brennan?
Yes.
I gave birth to a half-white child in Oklahoma in 1960;
Lionel's daughter.
raised her myself.
no education.
I got her to college.
she died eight years ago.
and Grandma raised me after that.
her mother was a nurse and Lisa's going to be a doctor.
grandma, I can't afford college.
so Lionel was murdered.
in 1959, yes, by a man named Gil Atkins.
and you can figure that out all this time later?
he had these.
tickets to Paris.
grandma, isn't that what he promised you?
a life in France?
I thought the worst of him.
thank you, Dr. Brennan.
I have something even better.
what could be better?
you've given me back my life.
it's a penny.
there's something you ought to know about that penny.
drinks?
Ah, yes.
Christmas spirits, well, they come in many a guise.
Cheers. Ah...
Ivy Gillespie came to the lab after you left with her granddaughter.
don't you want to know what happened?
I know what happened.
you told her about Careful Lionel.
you showed her the letters, the tickets.
she cried, but you made her happy.
not to mention I gave her a penny worth over a hundred thousand dollars.
she won't care about that today.
you just gave somebody the best Christmas gift they could ever get.
who's the secret Santa now?
stop.
and that weirdo assistant of yours just made me the coolest dad in the world.
daddy!
come on! Daddy!
Hey, look.
look at this thing. Can it flip?
how cool. It can flip, trip, swim, whatever you want.
say "Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas.
even all these months after katrina ravaged the city of new orleans, human remains are being found in devastated neighborhoods around the city.
cadaver dogs are being used to search for 2, 300 people still unaccounted for.
makeshift morgues still exist in warehouses, schools and churches throughout the area.
officials are finally beginning to admit what many people have know since the levees broke long ago:
many of these people will never be found.
you look tired, Mike. Late night?
Oh, yeah. Late and nasty.
same kinky creature?
doc, the girl carries a serious perv swerve.
feeling wrong feels so good.
Hey, sorry, Dr. Brennan.
no, it's fine. Males often bond by exaggerating sexual conquests.
Oh, Mike's not exaggerating.
this girl is seriously turned on by coffins.
Mike'll take her into the cooler in...
doc. --Some libidos are enflamed by a proximity to death.
who's that?
my assistant, Zack. Back in DC.
congratulations on your coffin sex.
I've got work to do.
some of the information you've sent for analysis seems to have come from remains that have already been embalmed.
the bodies were unearthed by the flooding.
they have to be id'd and reburied.
could fly down there to help, Dr Brennan.
a: Tomorrow's my last day, and b:
the sex on the coffin thing is not guaranteed.
you know, there are reasons they call this the big easy.
even after hurricane katrina.
Dr. Brennan.
meet John Doe 361.
we found this one in the ninth ward, sticking out of the mud.
good afternoon, detective Harding.
male, 40s.
badly decomposed. Looks pretty banged up.
Yep. Be nice to know if it was hurricane, flood or foul play that killed him.
detective Harding, have you been into the cooler lately?
apparently, some libidos are enflamed by the proximity to death.
God, Graham.
thinking about sex in this place should be illegal, if it ain't already.
Oh, Sam, I'm going to need X-rays on this one.
uh, looks like there's something lodged behind his teeth.
you been working 48 hours straight.
you need an evening off.
I only have one vacation day left.
what are you, doing penance for FEMA?
why don't you let me cook you dinner tonight?
I don't know.
come on. I'm a southern gentleman, ma'am.
your honor will be respected.
tell you what, Graham.
we'll see what the X-rays tell us about this one and then, maybe...
we'll get a bite to eat.
dr Brennan, your airport shuttle is here.
what?
no, um...
my flight isn't until thursday.
today is thursday, Dr Brennan.
what happened to wednesday?
dr Brennan? Hello? Are you there, Dr Brennan?
looks like someone stole your earring.
ripped it right out of the lobe.
I don't know what happened to me.
it's a tough town.
we don't have that many cops anymore, and, uh, they were never that good to begin with.
shouldn't insult the ones that stuck around.
detective Harding, I didn't know who else to call.
I need blood samples on this clothing.
maybe we'll get lucky and they won't all come from you.
still hazy on the details?
not "hazy" on the details, I...
I don't remember anything.
nothing?
Dr. Legiere knocking over a tray of instruments at the morgue. Then...
nothing.
that was the day before yesterday.
I requested a rape kit.
no sign of sexual activity, forced or otherwise.
bones, you okay?
booth, I told you not to come.
who's this?
he's FBI. We're sort of partners.
guy flies down from DC? You're more than sort of.
Yeah, that's great. You remember anything?
a tray falling over.
why can't she remember anything?
well, it could be the head injury.
hairline stress fracture on my right distal radius.
concussion, slight fever, torn earlobe.
I lost one of my favorite earrings.
you're worried about an earring?
you should really be worried about losing a whole day.
I know, it's stupid, but these earrings were my mother'S.
amnesia caused by any traumatic event, injury or drug can erase memories before the event, not just after.
great, we'll just wait for a tox screen.
it's gonna be at least 24 hours.--24 hours?
well, most of the labs in the area were destroyed by the hurricane.
we'll find out what happened.
you justake care of your, uh, partner.
another present from the bayou.
I keep asking for a baby till that says "the big easy."
Oh, we're all hoping for that.
for you, I mean.
does our funding allow us to do Dr Brennan's vacation work?
uh, we're just doing what the feds didn't.
it's the yin-yang of government spending.
so we're sneaking?
that's what makes it fun.
John Doe 361.
well, bad things happened to Mr. Doe.
it'll come back, Bones.
you don't know that. Head injuries are extremely unpredictable.
I'm just being reassuring.
regarding the X-rays of John Doe 361.
John Doe 361?
Yes, you sent his X-rays.
I don't remember that.
you don't remember?
what about the X-rays, Zack?
male, late 40s, mixed race.
anomalies on his spine, which I'm looking into, but the point is, his death was not accidental.
I sent you the X-rays of a murder victim?
how'd he die?
is that Booth?
Yes.
you're hopping the streetcar named desire with Booth?
Oh, I love this.
obviously, they're working the murder of John Doe 361 together.
precisely. How did 361 die?
the pelvis shows crush fractures.
there's also what appears to be a bullet hole in the skull, but there's no exit wound.
okay, keep working on it.
you don't remember the case?
no. And it's a murder.
God, I'm hungry.
well, when was the last time you ate?
Oh, my bad. You have amnesia.
booth, I think I know a place.
all right, so what is the last thing that you do remember?
I told you, Graham: Dr. Legiere knocked over a tray of surgical instruments.
I want to talk to Legiere.
we must have been about to examine John Doe 361.
Dr. Brennan.
I thought you were leaving today?
Peter, this is my friend Seeley Booth.
my god, what happened to you?
I'm not certain, but the...the bruising suggests Tuesday night.
after you left here?
I was here Tuesday?--What time?
in at 8: 00, left at 9: 00.
don't you remember? You had dinner with Sam Potter.
we have to go back to the morgue, talk to Sam.
who's Sam? --He's an orderly. He practices voodoo.
Hey, wait up, Bones.
you invited me to dinner.
Why?
you found this in the mouth of a John Doe.
let me see that.
that's voodoo?
it's gris-gris bag. It's a mojo.
this one is meant to silence the dead so they can't speak.
well, usually dead people are pretty much silent on their own.
voodoo embraces the premise that spirits can speak to us from beyond the grave.
voodoo is all about the balance of the forces.
that wind, the flood, this death, it's all out of balance now.
katrina was armageddon for the ones who love balance.
some think it was secte Rouge that brought it on.
what's that, some kind of a gang?
the ones who follow evil.
some believe that they purposely angered the Sirens who sent the flood.
this, this is secte Rouge.
okay, so that's literally bad voodoo.
it's black gum root.
there's only one place you can find it:
a voodoo shop on pontchartrain avenue, run by Richard Benoit.
he's a good man. Maybe he can help you.
okay, thanks.
Dr. Brennan, a lost day?
perhaps a spell was cast on you as well.
no disrespect, Sam, but it's not my religion.
come on, Booth.
Voodoo-- who's gonna believe that stuff?
it's a religion, no crazier than...
well, what are you?
Catholic.
they believe in the same saints you do, in prayer...
what they call spells, you call miracles. They have priests.
Yeah, we don't make zombies.
Jesus rose from the dead after three days.
Brennan.--Jesus is not a zombie.
all right? Man. I shouldn't have to tell you that.
on John Doe 361, there's a narrowing of the disc space on l2 and l3.
congenital?
unclear.
extensive injuries consistent with a body being thrown around by a flood.
cross-reference what you know so far with the d-mort records of missing Katrina victims.
Hey, Brennan.
why haven't you come home?
pretty soon, Ange.
is Booth there socially?
of course not.
all right, what's going on?
Hey, Bones has amnesia because a voodoo murderer put a spell on her to keep her from solving the murder of John Doe 361.
that's a huge supposition.
that's fine if you don't want to tell me.
ha. Voodoo amnesia.
it's a good one.
Yeah. It's great. Brennan's fighting zombies in New Orleans.
and we're stuck here.
Oh, what's that smell?
I imagine everything smells in here.
please just tell me that that car survived Katrina.
we used it to evacuate.
did you restore it yourself, or did you use, uh, voodoo?
an unbeliever.
what can I do for you?
you, uh...you know what that is?
this is a dark spell. Forbidden magic, very strong.
this is secte Rouge.
I certainly wouldn't make anything like this.
but you have the ingredients here.
well, the individual ingredients are not malignant.
it is how they are combined and what intention they are used for that makes a spell good or bad.
do you recognize me?
no. Should I?
anyone else work here?
my daughter, Eva.
what is this about?
we're conducting an investigation.
Eva! What kind of investigation?
is it true that this is the only place a person can buy black gum root?
Yes. Most places like this are all gone now.
it's not a coincidence.
Yes, Daddy?
have you ever seen this lady before?
no. Why?
we need to know who's bought this lately?
don't they need a warrant?
Eva will pull up what you need on the computer.
what you said before. What'd you mean it's just a coincidence?
most places like this where a houngan, a priest, can get what he needs
they are all gone now.
because of the hurricane and flood.
which occurred because of a lack of balance.
Mr. Benoit, are you suggesting that secte Rouge somehow conjured up a hurricane?
secte Rouge voodoo is much more powerful than ours.
no, Eva. Not more powerful.
destruction is easier than harmony, but not more powerful.
there are a lot of misunderstandings about voodoo.
Yeah, I know that whole zombie stuff puts a crimp in your public relations, I bet.
these are the people who bought black gum root in the past month.
Graham Legiere, the medical examiner.
I tried to get in touch with him.
he was scheduled to be out in the field this week.
Graham? It's Temperance.
what if he's not here?
he's probably asleep. He's been working nights.
cracker.
Hey, that's not funny.
I think he invited me to dinner that night, or drinks. Can't remember.
you know what? Maybe he roofed you.
I'm sure he bought the black gum root to look into its medicinal qualities.
Yeah, because we all know how effective that is.
voodoo healing is quite effective.
no crazier than acupuncture or exorcism.
Hey, hey. Easy on the catholics. Okay? Just easy.
there you go again.
are you okay?
something bad happened here.
they got away.
something bad.
what exactly were you doing here?
it's Graham, isn't it?
tell you what, Dr. Brennan. I'm going to ask the questions.
Oh, come on, detective. She was working with the guy.
how closely?
what's that supposed to mean?
answer my question, please.
what brought you here?
was it a social call? Business? Revenge killing?
look, Legiere bought some black gum root from the voodoo store. We just stopped by to ask why.
Why?
that's what we came here to ask.
you want to look behind me and remind yourselves why I'm a little low on sense of humor?
what? That wasn't a joke.
all right, she's not wisecracking. She just tends to be a bit, you know, literal.
day before yesterday I showed a voodoo expert a mojo that Graham found lodged in the mouth of John Doe 361.
this, uh, voodoo consultation. Did it occur before or after amnesia?
the amnesia's real.
Graham purchased a rare ingredient at a voodoo shop on pontchartrain ave.
so Graham made voodoo spells, shoved them into corpse's mouths and pretend to be surprised when he found them?
what's that? --Split cast, huh? More voodoo, just like the symbol on the wall.
bag it as evidence.
secte Rouge?
what do you know about secte Rouge?
if you're done with us, detective, we're going to go.
I'm going to tear this place apart, and if I find one piece of evidence that ties you to the scene,
I will take you into custody.
do you really think someone could go into a trance, commit a murder like that and not remember it?
no, I don't.
but I sure as hell think someone can fake amnesia.
that's great. Thank you, detective.
these files are everything you and Graham worked on the day before yesterday.
James, meet agent Seely Booth.
Dr. Embry is Graham's second in command.
condolences on your sudden promotion.
how do you think the job had anything to do with Graham being killed?
bones has voodoo amnesia; Legiere is voodoo-dead;
and the last thing they worked on together was a voodoo ritual murder, so I'm thinking there might be some kind of a connection.
Legiere's body
is it, uh, bad as they say?
how bad are they saying it is?
no matter how bad they're saying it is, it's worse.
I just want to mentally prepare myself.
I-I start his autopsy in a few minutes.
the file I need is John Doe 361.
according to the records, these are the only cases you worked on the day before yesterday.
four sets of remains, two were easy ids, drown victims processed and booted for burial.
the other two were both males, John Does 349 and 350.
I sent 361's X-rays to the Jeffersonian.
well, I'll check again.
can I make a lifestyle suggestion here? --Go ahead.
you know, "vacation"--it's from the latin, vacatio.
it means "freedom" or "release."You might want to consider that next time.
learning latin?
this is the opposite of vacation.
I mean, the one that you snapped, went insane and totally lost your mind.
Oh, thanks for your understanding.
uh, Dr. Brennan. There's no John Doe 361.
then whose X-rays did I send to dc?
no, I mean the file is gone.
Oh... okay. I'll hold that.
Zack, it's me. Anything else on John Doe 361?
Yes, Dr. Brennan, we found some damage to the pubic bone, some kind of strike marks.
did you get Angela to reconstruct the pattern?
Yeah. Hi, sweetie. I'm here.
I tried to make a digital positive, but it didn't work.
Why? --It was voodoo, probably.
the extrapolation protocols can't resolve the gradient fluxes in the bone shadings.
what's that? --That's mumbo jumbo. It's scientific voodoo.
can you do them manually?
off an X-ray?
Mm... not really.
can you send the actual remains?
they don't exist.
that makes no sense.
it was probably voodoo.
voodoo?
okay, quit saying "voodoo."
Yeah, because, you know it's not a factor.
okay, let me know what you find. Bye.
how do we know this is not the guy shoving mojo bags into dead people?
those spells are the work of a sorcerer.
Priests-- houngans--can make healing motions mojoes, but I'm not allowed.
but snake shaking-- that's fine?
the snake pulls the evil out of the soul, freeing the spirit...
I must do what small things I can.
the floods washed away too much of what was good.
Hey, bones, how's about while you're a murder suspect, you, uh, act more like a normal woman and less like Lily munster, okay?
Bye. Good snake. Bye-bye.
you know, call me crazy, but I'm suspicious of snake man.
Oh! That's because you've been inculcated by the mainstream culture's prevailing Judeo-Christian tradition into instinctive skepticism of alternative mores.
Yeah. Thanks for that explanation.
I've been over every inch of these X-rays.
me, too.
there's evidence of particles on the bones, but there is no way for me to know what they are.
probably dirt.
Yes, thank you, Zack, but dirt is a meaningless word.
you can't see air on an X-ray.
what?
I never said you could.
what? I'm not even talking about air.
you can see a space where air might be, like a cavity, but not the air itself.
what I'm saying is that, yes, there are flecks on the X-ray that might be dirt, but that doesn't tell us anything.
is it sandy, hmm?
Silty, humusy?
is it clay? Is it more organic than mineral?
is it soil? Is it pulverized gravel?
what minerals are in it? Are the minerals crystalline?
see, these are all details a person cannot get off an X-ray no matter how long he stares at it.
sometimes a person should look for things that aren't there instead of things that are there.
you mean me?
in dirt?
no. Me.
on the X-ray. I've been looking for anomalies which exist instead of anomalies which don't exist.
if you are ever going to successfully mimic being human, you have to stop making everything about you, and feign interest in the other guy.
I've noticed that you try to look taller.
when?
around Dr. Brennan.
I do not.
and Angela, because they are both taller than you.
you know what?
I take it back.
don't take any interest in the other guy.
thank you for your help.
so, do you remember anything else that could help us out?
it could have been me.
you remember that?
look at it objectively.
Graham Legiere was killed between 11: 00 P. M Tuesday and 3: 00 A. M. Wednesday.
not only do I not have an alibi, I...
I can't even explain to myself where I was.
it could have been me.
no, it couldn't.
yes... wha...? How do you know?
I just know, okay? I'd bet my professional career on it.
I already did.
what? - Nothing.
what did you do? - Bones...
stop.
this is the last time and place that you want to be rational, okay?
let's just be wildly emotional and assume that you didn't psychotically murder a co-worker who invited you over for dinner.
what's that? - What?
that.
EW...
it's another voodoo dumpling?
it's some kind of flesh.
and these are seashells.
leather, I think.
is that a human tooth?
Yes. A canine.
put down your weapon, agent booth.
put down your weapon. There's no threat from us.
you're holding a gun on me.
Yeah, well, you know, my finger here is not on the trigger.
it's the best I can do under the circumstances.
holster your weapons.
I'm here to arrest Dr. Brennan for the murder of Graham Legiere.
Oh, that's not going to happen.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
I told you, Booth.
bones, please!
just once in your life will you be quiet?
that's good advice because everything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
what is that?
it's, uh... I found it on my pillow.
thank you, Dr. Brennan.
what's the probable cause?
traces of dr. Brennan's blood in Legiere's home, Legiere's blood on her clothing.
from the clinic.
is that it?
all I'm prepared to share with the federal government.
now, please, step away from my collar.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
bones! Geez!
it's better if nobody else dies while we get to the bottom of this.
uh! Well, you know what? I wasn't planning on dying.
Ow! It's not you I worry about.
Ow!
you're welcome to the room. It's paid for.
were you sleeping with Graham Legiere?
I don't...
I don't think so.
you don't think so?
I don't remember sleeping with him, and at the clinic, they said there was no sign of sexual activity.
I hope you kept your mouth shut.
okay, Temperance Brennan, Carolyn Julian.
she's your lawyer. She's from the us attorney's office.
she's the best there is.
you found a prosecutor to defend her?
interesting tactic.
I've told detective harding everything I know - so far. - She's a fool?
you didn't tell me she's a fool.
no, she's a brilliant forensic anthropologist.
well, I have three degrees.
I've pioneered research in...
what's that?
a gris-gris bag.
I found it in my hotel... room...
I'm assuming the person who left it there is trying to frame me, so the tooth is probably Graham'S.
three degrees and still a fool.
this interview is over, Rose.
I need to speak with my client alone before she gives herself a lethal injection.
of course.
of course.
it's nice seeing you again, Carolyn.
okay, Bones, what the hell were you talking to her for?
I was just trying to help.
you sew those lips together, girl, because there is no such thing as helping the New Orleans police.
they just want to close the case as quickly and easily as they can, and you are making it christmastime for them.
okay, listen, there's no way that Bones could have killed Legiere.
I mean, it's just not her. I mean, look at her.
I am doing you a favor taking this case, Booth.
but as the lady cop says, I'm a prosecutor.
and as it stands now, I could try this case in my pjs and still get a conviction.
well, shouldn't you get to know your clients before you make snap judgments?
fine. Stop me when I get something wrong.
trained in three types of martial arts, two assault charges, registered marksman with the nra, hunting licenses in four states...
you hunt? - Only for food.
shot an unarmed man.
he was trying to set me on fire.
all right, just...
just arrange bail for us, Carolyn, so we can get out of here.
sure, sure.
don't want to get this one mad at me.
bones, you just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you?
I can identify this guy.
you know, Angela isn't that much taller than me.
he had a shunt from his brain stem down to his heart.
it was removed more than a decade ago.
we both like Brussels Sprouts.
you don't like Brussels Sprouts.
a man can change, Zack.
what, a human tooth?
Yeah, it was some kind of... some flesh, some fabric; it looked like some kind of shell.
Yeah, sounds like to make you forget.
somebody doesn't want you to know what happened to John Doe 361.
booth, I'm not under a spell.
well, you forgot a whole day.
the spirits don't need you to believe in them, Dr. Brennan;
they believe in you.
see you back at work, huh?
how'd I get away?
you know, Graham got killed.
I got away. How did I do that?
you know, Bones, all those things that Carolyn mentioned, you know, the martial arts, the shooting, the assaults...
it's just you're just the type of woman that fights.
maybe they didn't expect it.
maybe they thought some kind of magic could hold you.
I don't believe in magic.
exactly.
you're a surprising woman. Sometimes that's enough for getting away.
why are you nice to me?
because. Because they think they get away with it.
what?
they burn their victim. They blow him up.
they toss him in the ocean.
they bury them in the desert.
they throw 'em to wood chippers.
sometimes, you know, years go by, they relax.
then they start living their lives like they didn't do anything wrong.
like they didn't spend somebody else's life in order to get what they got.
they think they're safe from retribution, but you know...
you make those bastards unsafe.
that's why I'm nice to you.
I couldn't do that without you, Booth.
Yeah.Um, you should be a little nicer to me, huh?
I really should. - Yeah.
I walk in on something?
beignet and a caf? - chef.
hospital records.
the tox screen was negative.
what?
that's impossible.
no rohypnol, no ketamine?
nothing but a touch of alcohol, not enough to affect a baby.
a jury is never going to believe this amnesia story.
well, but it's true.
maybe this is truetoo.
Legiere tried to rape you.
he was aotorious horndog.
we claim self-defense, cop a plea, you're out in three years.
no, I don't care what it looks like, or how you're reading the evidence, Carolyn, she didn't do it.
could be that's true, seeley.
you vouch for her, that's good enough for me.
but, Cheri, this looks bad.
all you've got on your side is proof you got roughed up.
these picture from the clinic, these X-rays.
new wrist.
the doctor was wrong.
he said this was a colles' fracture from a fall.
this break shows surface trauma on the outside of the bone.
this was either defensive, or someone slammed my wrist into something.
maybe because you tried to stab him in the heart with a knife.
no, think about it. If I'd alread stabbed the attacker, he wouldn't have been able to break my wrist.
I like this story.
what else? - There's the mojo bag.
I mean, someone was trying to put a forgetting spell on her.
booth. - Hey, I can work with that.
this is New Orleans, baby. and where's my beignet?
John Doe 361 is named rene mouton.
how can you be sure?
I looked for something that wasn't there, which turned out to be a shunt channel.
good work.
you understood that?
all Zack had to do was cross-check with d-mort.
I only thought of it because of Hodgins.
I can discern particulates on the X-ray, but I have no way of telling what they are.
some kind of dirt?
okay, everybody, the word "dirt" means nothing here in the lab, scientifically.
any progress on the design that was pressed into the pelvic bone?
I've tried three different computer programs.
I fed in the information into multiple impact scenarios, but this isn't going to work on x-rays.
I need the actual remains.
booth and I are looking for them as hard as we can.
or, better still, you could forget the whole thing and come home.
don't worry. I made bail.
bail? - Bail?
for what?
I told you. Don't worry.
the murder charge won't stick.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Murder charge?
Brennan, the next plane, okay?
the next plane, or I'm coming down there to get you myself.
everything's fine.
I'm healing up satisfactorily.
bye for now.
healing up?
you know what?
this whole state of affairs where Brennan just runs around fighting crime?
it's stupid.
it's nuts.
don't you agree?
go. Go.
I'll be... fine.
Brennan will be fine, angela.
she got bail and the murder charge won't stick.
what is going on with her?
she started to change the day she met you.
what? - Well, she sees how you do it.
all fun and involvement and pizzazz.
big, you know?
big life.
booth came along and gave her the opportunity, but she got the idea from you.
Brennan wants a big life like yours.
that's how it looks to me, anyway, but what do I know?
I'm a bug guy.
bug and slime.
and dirt.
Yeah. So...
okay.
according to bureau files, Rene Mouton headed up a small voodoo church.
by all accounts, he was a very good man.
he rescued scores of people during Katrina.
then he just disappeared.
some thought he was just swept away when the levee broke.
why would anyone murder him?
you know the chaos, during the evacuation.
could even have been for a bottle of water.
or because he was a priest.
the gris-gris box, the murder of dr. Legiere, your amnesia-- this is the work of a bokor, a secte rouge sorcerer.
rene Mouton was a houngan, a powerful and well-loved priest.
for secte rouge to claim his soul, this would give them influence on all the people that he influenced.
like a chain letter.
or in the real world, somebody who wanted his shoes.
no, Booth, it makes sense.
what does?
Graham and I were on the trail of a broker...
bokor.
and he found out, or secte rouge did.
all right, great. Then we just toss the ring into the molten river and blah, blah, right?
look, in the meantime, somebody here had the ability to hide Mouton's body and files.
me. - Mike Doyle.
say you wanted to hide a particular body and you didn't want anyone to find out,
where would you put it?
if I wanted to hide a body,
I'd change the nametag on the coffin.
not Mouton, too young.
he's buried and the evidence is gone forever.
female. Yoknow, I find that hard to believe that horny little Mike Doyle is a voodoo sorcerer.
Mm-hmm.
me, too.
speaking a devel
my doll, And he's not alone.
you said to avoid the police.
not cooperating is one thing, Bones, okay? Concealing a double homicide?
we might as well give them an excuse to hang us.
Dr. Embry says that you can identify the bag of bones, the skeletal remains belong to a man named Rene Mouton.
his skull is missing.
Lookto me like Mike Doyle was drugged; a spike was driven through his head during or immediately following sexual intercourse.
well, it appears that Dr. Brennan, Dr. Embry, and Sam Potter here are the three people who could have pulled this off.
Sam Potter brought us to the body; we called you in.
who does that leave?
Oh, please. There's no security in this place.
anyone could have gotten in here.
you said that Mike was having sex when he died.
James, he must have been killed by the coffin girl.
what? - What's her name?
well, I never got her name.
is there a mojo in Doyle's mouth?
I don't feel comfortable releasing that... - the girl is a voodoo sorcerer.
she works for secte rouge.
detective Harding, I know this is, you know, sounds superstitious, but...
three ritual murders and a world-renowned anthropologist, who can't remember how she ended up smeared with the blood of a skinned man, crucified to a wall with spikes.
call me superstitious.
excuse me.
may I scatter Fwan Ginea over mr. Mouton?
to purify his remains.
No! No more of this voodoo crap.
I don't want you contaminating the body.
what is it?
ashes from a ritual fire pit.
ashes from a dove's feather, salt mixed with holy water.
okay, okay, you know, we get the idea, just...
it should have no effect on the bones, detective Harding.
fine, fine, go ahead.
Whoa! Did you see that?
very interesting phenomenon.
the electrostatic charge of the particles reacted with the bone.
angela was unable to recreate that pattern from the X-rays using the best technology in the world.
electrostatic, my ass.
that was part of an emblem of a 1959 caddy brougham...
Oh, boy. - What?
the voodoo shop guy owns a 1959 Cadillac.
he's got a voodoo daughter.
you're taking my Caddy? Why?
Why? Because we have reason to believe that your Caddy was used in the wrongful death of Rene Mouton.
you think that someone did a hit-and-run on Rene Mouton in my Caddy?
Yes.
Mr. Benoit, does your daughter have a boyfriend?
Yeah!
this him?
Mike Doyle. Yeah. Why?
we need to speak to your daughter...
by which I mean detective Harding needs to speak to your daughter.
I don't know where she is.
Mr. Benoit, right now, she's a suspect in the murder of Mike Doyle.
why would Eva kill her boyfriend?
it's hard to explain.
she was involved in a hit-and-run.
when the body surfaced at the morgue, she asked her boyfriend to help her hide it.
he refused, so she killed him.
also, she's a member of secte rouge.
no, no, no.
I bet there are drugs in this shop that could knock me out, make me forget.
Eva is downstairs, praying.
Eva, open the door.
No!
could that be Mouton's skull?
Yes.
and this could be the spike that she used on Mouton and Mike Doyle.
this is the lair of bokor, someone who can call the dark spirits.
this is used for ritual animal sacrifice.
it was heated to red-hot first, to cauterize the wound so it wouldn't bleed.
what, she killed herself because she knew we were coming?
no, no, not my Eva.
she drove the spike through her sternum?
sternum, heart.
through the chest cavity, through the spine.
can I open this?
what?
this one holds the soul of Mr. Rene Mouton.
I believe this one holds the soul of the bokor.
why don't you just shut up?
I would like to release mr. Mouton's soul, so no other bokor can use it.
no, it's evidence. Don't touch it.
I raised my Eva to be a houngan, a healer.
how could this happen right underneath my nose?
rebellious adolescent?
do you remember how much of this spike was protruding through her back when we first came in?
six, eight inches.
would the fact that the spike was red-hot cause it to go through the body more easily?
no. It might even make it harder.
Eva Benoit did not commit suicide.
based on what?
this room isn't even 12 feet wide.
even if she ran at full speed and her aim was perfect, no way the spike would go through her spine, unless she was pushed onto it.
he is the sorcerer.
he believes he can bring her back to life.
okay, everyone, just simmer down, okay?
you're saying that he murdered his daughter thinking that he could bring her back to life?
you find her dead, you stop looking for Mouton's murderer.
an inch or two to the left or right, we would have never known it was murder.
it had to have been hard pushing her onto the spike, especially if she were resisting.
you'd have some wounds of your own.
there's your killer.
I'd really like to go home now.
Yeah, me too-- all right, my advice, cuff Mr. Wizard here, before he puts a spell on you.
what, no written confession?
you want a confession? Threaten to release his daughter's soul, he'll tell you everything.
Dr. Temperance Brennan.
you leave here, you go home, it does not matter. There are powers, dark powers to which distance makes no difference.
easy, buddy.
Hey, hey, hey!
I've noticed that very few people are scary once they've been poked in the eye.
Whew!
I got in the middle of a battle between two religious sects.
Benoit used hurricane Katrina as a diversion to take the soul of a voodoo priest.
and he killed his own daughter.
dark sorcerers suck, man.
Oh, but you know, he intended to bring her back to life.
there's not really any such thing as spells and magic.
what are you talking about?
they put a forgetting hex on Dr. Brennan.
it wasn't the spell that made me forget;
it was the drugs-- rohypnol.
blood test didn't find any.
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate?
not a trace.
sodium petathol?
Nope.
severe emotional trauma.
honey, even I think you're too strong-minded for that.
there were too many delays in doing my blood test
that, plus the adrenaline of my escape, the drugs were out of my system.
they put the voodoo on you, baby.
I didn't really mean to call you "baby."
you guys, stop.
now. I mean it.
you do believe in voodoo?
because even if a small part of you believes in it, then it has a grip.
I do not believe.
maybe just a little?
no. - Good, because, you know, if you have any doubts, we'll just have Benoit send you back one of those little satanic mojo pouches from prison.
booth, objects have no intrinsic power.
a person's future does not depend on some thin things are just things.
they do not have magical meaning or powers.
Where'd you get that?
what does it matter?
it's just a thing. Right?
my mother's earring.
no, uh...
magical power over your future.
does that prove something?
Yeah.
it proves something.
washed up on the bay. They think it could be Carlie Richardson.
and I'm supposed to know who that is?
Yeah. Disappeared a year ago, she was pregnant.
come on, Bones. You have to get a TV, you know.
or at least just thumb through a People at the checkout stand.
was it in the Journal of Forensic Anthropology?
Oh, you know, I forgot to renew my subscription. You know what, Bones?
you really need to take up some other interests.
I'm reading Ted Joya's History of Jazz. Was she mentioned in there?
or maybe in McGee's Science and Lore of the Kitchen.
or perhaps I should develop an interest in the mainstream media's exploitation of crimes for their entertainment value.
it's amazing, Bones. You can really be snotty sometimes.
so, Carlie Richardson?
Carlie Richardson, newlywed. Everyone assumed that she was murdered.
husband was cheating on her, there was evidence that they had a fight that day.
he was covered in scratches. Witnesses said that they saw him down by the marina.
but, hey, you know, without the body, they had to kick him free.
well, if she's been in the water for a year, the bones will be saturated.
I'll need nylon mesh bagging and...
cam's bringing in everything on the truck.
well, after a year, there's not going to be a lot of flesh for Cam to deal with.
well, you know, hey, Bones, you know, Cam, she's in charge now.
she runs the place, it's her call.
then let's hurry. I don't want my remains compromised.
okay.
I don't care if she's the boss.
the bones belong to me.
booth. Oh, yeah.
Rebecca. Whoa, wait a second. Slow down, okay?
this is my weekend with Parker, okay?
I am his father, all right?
Stu is your boyfriend.
we're gonna be in the water, Doc. Remember to bring Traxon and soluble tape.
does she think I'm new at this?
I developed the use of Traxon...
on the phone, Bones. - I know. Get off. We have to go.
Rebecca, he's spending a lot of time with Parker and I don't even know this guy.
she took Zack. Zack's mine.
because you know what?
I just want to make sure that he's a good influence.
the fact that he, you know, rocks, rocks your world, surprisingly that...
really, you know doesn't concern me.
I'll just meet you there.
doesn't concern me.
I got to run, okay, Rebecca? We'll talk about this later.
wait up!
why can't you go faster?
I don't see why I couldn't drive.
because you're agitated. - I am not.
you know what? You've turned this into a competition between you and Cam.
I just like to be first on the scene, that's all, to protect the evidence.
she's not going to disturb anything.
no, it's all tissue and blood and DNA with her.
she doesn't appreciate the skeletal system.
you could take the I-70. It'll be quicker.
don't backseat drive, okay?
Oh, I think I know who's agitated.
someone is annoying me, okay? That's different.
your ex. - Huh?
that's who's annoying you. Because she has a new man in her life.
that's funny, you know, okay? I am concerned about my son.
I want to know what kind of guy this new boyfriend is.
and you know what? If she's not going to tell me, I'll find out on my own.
are you gonna run a background check on him?
when you have kids, we'll talk.
it's a lot to ask for a little conversation.
if you make a right, we can cut through Grafton.
fine.
she beat us here and she was in a truck.
well, you know, you're the one who wanted to go through Grafton.
well, you could have used the siren. I mean, why do you have one if you're not going to use it?
Oh! What's that smell?
Zack, I need some sterile tubes before she's fertilizer.
okay, that's the smell.
Caucasian, female, 25 to 30.
barnacle and small mussel encrustation indicates she's been in the water for about a year.
no. They have.
God.
the size of the fetal bones indicates the fetus was viable.
how could someone do this to their own kid?
multiple fractures.
they could be from an assault or from being battered by rocks and debris while in the water.
stab wounds evident on ribs, manubrium and clavicle.
and ulna, radius, one to the sphenoid.
this was a very violent attack.
you find the murder weapon?
not yet. The scuba guys just got here.
tell them to look for a left leg and missing fetal bones.
looks like we finally get to put Richardson away.
I love being a hero.
a heroine.
mm, sounds too druggy. I'm going with hero.
whoa, what are you doing?
scraping the adipocere from the hands.
no, you could compromise the bone.
you should use suction back at the lab if you want a conviction.
of course, it's your call.
are we gonna have another murder here, or what?
no, no. I have the utmost respect for the doc.
glad she works for me.
good.
the clothes, they match the ones she was last seen wearing.
the rope could be a match of the type found in Richardson's house.
while you two do your thing, I'm gonna go bring the son of a bitch in.
Where's Richardson? - I don't know!
he saw this and then he took off.
I tried to stop him, but then he hit me.
he said he's never coming back!
sources indicate both mother and her fetus were stabbed to death.
Kyle Richardson remains the chief suspect.
is the evidence taken from Kyle Richardson's house a year ago.
so, we got rope, the plastic sheeting, knife set, one knife missing, Richardson's DNA results.
file says witnesses placed Richardson at the marina on the bay the night she disappeared.
looks like he's not walking this time, Seeley.
ironic since he's running now.
Hodgins, you know Booth is bigger than you, right?
right.
wasn't your fault, dude.
let's focus, people. This should be a slam dunk.
we screw this one up, I'm gonna look like a fool and someone's gonna have to pay for that.
we just started collecting evidence.
there are boxes of evidence. The remains are icing on the cake.
let's just hand the prosecutor what she needs so I can have a nice weekend knocking back shots and playing poker.
Yeah, that should motivate us.
I'm going to strip the flesh and adipocere, remove anything from under the fingernails.
here lies a dead fish in the plastic.
Ooh, and it's not even my birthday.
he saved the fish.
stomach contents and particulates could give us drift patterns, show where she was left before she washed ashore.
not much left of the organs.
looks like I can still find a few surprises from what's left of this lung.
looks like some liver here.
I'll take any tissue that stuck to the plastic.
there'll be sediment and organic particulates.
what do you want?
george Clooney naked on a white sand beach, but I can give you faces after the skull's reconstructed.
Zack will start on them right away.
after you've stripped any tissue,
I would like to reassemble the victim and the fetus.
sounds like fun. Let's do it.
it was male.
he, not it, Bones.
I'm going to go talk to his girlfriend. No mistakes on this one.
he always was a little touchy.
Yeah.
I didn't know Kyle then.
we started going out after his wife went missing.
Mm-hmm. Did he ever mention the night she disappeared?
of course. It was terrible for him.
I just tried to support him and help him get past it.
he looks like he had a lot of people to help him.
and he looks really, really broken up.
I know he dated other women, but he's not who you think he is.
no, of course not.
Oh, my God! - Agent Booth, is that necessary?
just trying to help her remember.
he would never do this.
he could never do this.
he hit you when he was leaving, didn't he?
I know. That is because I wanted to go with him, and he knew everyone would be after him.
he was just trying to protect me.
Yeah, he's a real prince.
if he contacts you...
call.
otherwise, you're looking at obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting, and I'm surewe can find a few other charges to make it worth the money you're paying your lawyer.
there's another gash on the second rib, right side, approximately 45 degrees, left to right.
why didn't he just divorce her?
why did they have to get married in the first place?
it's an antiquated ritual.
Carlie Richardson believed in it, trusted her husband, and look what happened.
so this is marriage's fault?
committing yourself to one person isn't in the interest of the species.
I mean, you have multiple partners.
don't say it like that.
I date.
the notion of a committed relationship's fantasy.
look at Booth. Fighting with his ex, his son caught in the middle.
we make our lives out of chaos and hope and love.
someday you'll meet somebody.
I don't need anything more than I have now.
talk about a fantasy.
the skulls are in multiple pieces, but the damage is from debris in the water.
then let's start on the stab wounds.
I'd like you to confirm the type of knife used in each of these.
Oh, these all appear to be from the knife that was missing from the set taken from Richardson's.
appear?
no conclusions without corroboration.
but Dr. Saroyan seems certain that Richardson...
seems? You're my grad student. You work for me.
remember, Doc, we're building a case here, not getting our rocks off on research.
rocks and sediment are Hodgins' specialty.
you're serious?
okay.
brought your hand back.
I found organic material under the fingernails. Should match Richardson.
and I found something else I'd like you to look at.
it's right here in the lung.
it's a locket.
must've been around her neck and melted into the lung during putrefaction.
before I remove it,
I wanted to see if any of your cyborgs can do anything with the photo paper.
there's not enough left. It's liquefied.
it's probably just another picture of the lovebirds anyway.
Oh, what's this?
Oh, no. - Who's Kenny?
I don't know. I don't want to know. I just want it to be Richardson.
that's right because of the drinking and the poker.
Yeah, I know there's a lot of animals at the zoo.
monkeys... monkeys are Daddy's favorite.
they're just like people.
actually, three million base pairs of the genome differ in protein encodg and other functional areas.
what?
genetic differences between chimps and humans.
I'm talking to a four-year-old, Bones.
Oh, yeah...
you're spending a lot of time with Drew, huh? Oh, that's great.
okay, you've got to go eat. Okay, go eat. Make sure... okay, I love...
Yeah.
her boyfriend spending a lot of time with your son?
Yeah.
so you got any, uh, new information for me, Bones?
I'm sorry. Nah, it's no need.
it must be hard not being able to see him when you want to.
you see, this is information that I already know, Bones. Why don't you
let's say we just discuss the case, hmm?
sure.
you know, I'm his father.
you know, Parker knows that.
I mean, that's-that's what's important, not some stupid trip to the zoo.
Yeah, absolutely. - Right.
Yeah. - Done. Of course. Boom.
well, we found this in her lung.
what?
her lung? - It was enveloped during decomp.
any reference to a Kenny in the case file?
no, but whoever Kenny is liked her enough to get her a locket.
maybe Kyle wasn't the only one who was cheating.
opens up a lot of possibilities.
I say we just go talk to Carlie's friends and see if they know who Kenny is.
the four of us got so close being in the same Lamaze class.
losing Carlie was like losing a sister.
it was her idea to start this baby group.
we all felt so connected, feeling someone growing inside, waiting to meet them.
do you have kids? - He does.
they make you feel whole.
it's just a release of serotonin necessary for the survival of the species.
huh?
never mind, um... we found this, uh... locket on Carlie's remains, it says, uh,"I love you, Kenny." Did she ever mention a Kenny?
Yes. She talked about Kenny all the time.
he's never mentioned in the police report.
Kenny was her dog.
her dog?
Kyle bought her the dog when things we better between them. She loved that dog.
there used to be a picture of the two of them in there.
Oh, where is her dog now?
it died. Mary took care of it.
I'm a vet; they brought it in a few months before Carlie disappeared.
Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.
Rlie always felt he did it on purpose.
he was a real piece of work when he got mad.
a dead dog? Excellent.
so, we're back to one suspect: Richardson.
I like this. Good work.
do you want children?
what? - Children?
maybe, if I could find one that sleeps late and cleans.
does this apply to the case in any way?
no, just curious.
most people think it's odd when a woman doesn't want children, but, obviously, you don't.
are you pregnant?
no... I'm not.
why are you looking at me?
well, as long as you're not leaving the lab every two minutes to pee.
no intention of it.
so all this back and forth was for nothing.
good to know.
now, unless the liver has a written confession in it by a pet parakeet, we should have enough to build a solid forensic case against Richardson for the prosecutor.
I found something that might put a new wrinkle in things.
great.
Oh, God.
the fish was a Pomatomus saltatrix, a bluefish, common to Delaware Bay.
and there were dinoflagellates consistent with the saltwater in the bay.
dozing off, Hodge-podge.
but I also found didinium, a ciliate, and oomycota, a mold, both of which are found in freshwater.
so, the body was in fresh and salt water.
exactly. Freshwater first for at least six months.
okay, now we have witnesses that put Richardson at the marina that night; there is no freshwater what's going on here?
richardson is the only logical suspect. Are we working for the defense now?
I'm working for the victims and we have to be open to the evidence as it presents itself.
the knife, the rope, the plastic sheeting are all from Richardson's house, that's been confirmed.
we're trying to build a case here, people.
we don't ignore facts just because they might change the outcome of a case.
not asking you to, Doc, I just want you to fill in the blanks.
there must be freshwater close enough for Richardson to have dumped the body.
it has to have the same sediment, larvae, archaea, helminths...
great. Whatever the hel- minths those are find them.
and if we find a body of water that matches, it has to be dredged for additional body parts.
we're still missing the left patella, tibia and calcaneus.
and the fetus is missing the... - Okay, fine.
just stop talking and do it.
Hey, so... is this the only freshwater near the bay?
the only body of water that might have algae and sediment that could match what we found on the remains.
Whoo! Seems to be a lot of gamophyta.
is that good?
I won't know until I compare it to the samples in the lab.
then why'd you act so excited?
I guess I just like gamophyta.
you know, you really don't have to act any geekier.
the whole outfit does it for you.
geek chic, dude.
agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.
how ya doing?
anything?
another Top-Flite.
you know, I went out with a woman who had a little kid once.
aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?
the kid hated me, you know, he said I used too many big words.
well, he got that right. - He hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.
I could never sleep with his mom again.
well, you know, at least the story ends well.
I was good to him, though, you know? I mean, I did not deserve an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.
Ooh, nematodes and planaria.
does that mean anything?
not sure.
anything?
bones. Could be from the fetus.
Hamate, triquetral, portions of the phalanges and another Top-Flite.
according to the reconstruction with these new bones, the fetus has seven fingers.
and two right hands.
I don't understand. Was there another victim?
double the magnification.
look at the structure of the phalanges.
the bones from the lake are from a raccoon.
the formation of the hands is almost identical to an infant's hand.
how did you do?
we found a raccoon, you?
the sediment and organic material from the lake doesn't match what was taken from the remains.
I have to look for another body of freshwater. I don't think it's around here.
what have you got?
nothing.
and the next body of freshwater that might be a match is over 60 miles away.
richardson couldn't have been there. It wouldn't match the timeline.
I've got the board of the Jeffersonian, the federal prosecutor and Nancy Grace ready to devour me if I don't hand them enough to indict Richardson.
well, if you want us to manufacture evidence...
no, I want us to find out who killed Carlie, and I'm pissed 'cause whoever did it is messing with me and I don't like that.
I like doing the messing.
then we have to determine whether we're wasting our time on Richardson.
tell me what you need.
his plates were found in a ditch on Route 432.
his car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.
he could be using another car or he could be hiding out.
can anybody I. D. him?
I've got I. D.s coming in from all over the place.
this is where the concerned citizens all come out for the reward.
excuse us, Agent Booth?
let me know if you find something. - Sure.
I'm Dennis Campbell. This is my wife, Patricia.
we're Carlie's parents. - Yes, I know. Please... sit down.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
well, at least now our daughter can rest with her baby and Kyle can never touch them again.
the reason we're here...
we were going through some photos for the funeral and...
we came across this one.
Kyle used to go out of town on business.
his firm had an office in Boston.
Carlie went with him once.
this is them with some people in Boston.
that woman on the news, Karen Tyler, she said she met Kyle after Carlie disappeared, but here she is looking at him.
he admitted to being involved with those other girls.
why did he lie about knowing her?
may I keep this photo? - Of course.
we need em to answer for this.
she was our little girl.
she wasn't supposed to go before us.
that's not the way it's supposed to be.
I know. We'll find Kyle.
I promise.
you want me to what?
stab the body for me.
we need match force with the injuries recorded on the remains.
okay, I'm stabbing the body.
well... it's a replica.
we're all going to do it, you're just the closest to Kyle Richardson.
okay, you know what, that's great.
I'll be there in 20, but in the future you just have to ask me differently, Bones, because you know what, come over to your place to stab a body, that is just freaky.
Seeley, you son of a bitch.
Oh... I, uh, Rebecca, wow, you look great.
Yeah, okay, save it, cause I need a lot more than compliments from you right now.
okay, just keep it down for a little bit, you know, cause I'm at work, all right?
you sent agents to investigate Drew because you're going to stop that now.
okay, listen, I'm just being cautious.
what do you really know about this guy anyway, huh?
I know...I-I-I know that he has a good job.
and I-I know that he fixes stuff around the house when he says he's going to.
and I know that Parker is crazy about him and he's not terrified every time he goes off to work that he's going to get shot and I know that I love him.
I love him.
and now everyone at work thinks he's a criminal.
well, he's been spotted with explosives.
he is a construction foreman, He does demolition,
I mean, you must've figured that out when you were doing all of your snooping.
look, I have a right to know who's hanging around my son.
all right, he spends more time with Parker than I do.
okay, you think that I would put Parker in danger?
let me ask you a question, Rebecca. Why is it that you keep all the men in your life such a secret?
because you always interrogate them or intimidate them and it freaks them out.
well, I mean, come on, a lot of them are a little strange, I mean, the guy with the tattoos on his neck.
hold on, I don't even have to let you see Parker, okay, not-not legally.
that's one of the upsides of not being married.
don't.
I'm a good father. You know that.
you have got to stop trying to run things.
I've got things in my life that have nothing to do with you.
all right, look. You know what? We are always going to have something to do with each other because we share a son.
drew's a good man, and you need to back off, or you're not going to see Parker again, I swear.
you back off.
here comes Kyle.
ha, ha, funny. Don't we have something to stab?
this. I hate my job.
from the depth of the stab wounds, we can tell the approximate force required in newton meters to inflict the marks we see on the bones.
so, we have to measure the amount of force generated when we stab to give us the the size, weight, and body type of the assailant.
you had to dress her up.
the clothes she wore figure in the resistance to the blows.
the knife is consistent with the one that caused the wounds.
we fitted it with an instrument and blade that will give us a digital readout of the newton meters of each stab.
it's a dual mass drop system.
all I hear is blah, blah, blah.
cliff Note's version-- we all stab, one of us is the killer.
thank you. Sort of like a real creepy party game.
the violence of the attack shows rage, so everyone should stab as hard as they can.
this better work!
that was weird.
okay, okay.
results?
the force used to make the injuries on the bones was 24 newton meters.
and the winner is, with 24 newton meters...
what?
Congratulations.
Really?
height and weight?
Oh, God. Uh, uh...
five, eight, one hundred and.
what? - 135.
it's all muscle.
five-seven and 132 pounds.
so, Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie so they can be together?
well, then, why did Kyle run?
maybe he didn't. It sounds nuts but if she's the killer, maybe Karen got rid of him, you're sure that there's no way Richardson could have made these wounds?
with his strength, the blows would have sliced deeper into the bone.
well, these seemed to go right through.
well, those were delivered after she was on the ground.
so, Karen does the killing because they know everyone will be suspecting Kyle.
I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.
there are particles in the knife marks.
when she was on the ground, the knife passed through the body and picked up sediment from the dirt.
the next stab imbedded that into the bone.
if I can get enough information from these particulates,
I might be able to locate the site of the murder.
DNA results came back. It was Kyle under her nails.
so he was there, too?
maybe. But we know he had a fight with her earlier that he admits.
fortunately, there was also the skin of somebody else.
test showed it was a woman.
we should get her DNA drawn as soon as possible.
smart. Let's go.
I didn't do it. I swear, I would never hurt her.
hmm. And the other day, you said you and Kyle didn't know each other until after Carlie disappeared.
because we both knew what everyone would think.
Karen, please don't say anything.
mm, even your lawyer thinks you did it.
Kyle thought we should separate and meet up in a few months, so, you know, it wouldn't look so bad.
well, that didn't work out, now, did it?
open your mouth.
do I really have to do this?
they have a warrant.
when you were sleeping with Kyle, didn't it matter to you that you're destroying a family?
we were in love.
Oh. Love. Sorry. Now it's a beautiful story.
open again.
Ouch!
Oops.
Kyle was going to tell her. We were going to be honest.
Mm,'cause you know you do that so well.
I would never hurt her.
and neither would Kyle.
right, the love of your life who no one has seen for two days.
can you see why I'm leery of relationships?
we hit paydirt.
actually, we hit silt containing the feces of the gypsy moth, some quartz, and mica.
that and the zinc levels in the dinoflagellates from the freshwater as well as the Pinaceae pollen led us to a patch of pitch pines outside of Gloucester City, New Jersey.
she was killed right here.
and when did they move her to the bay?
they didn't. They left her in New Jersey.
in the Rancocas Creek. She made it to the bay on her own.
Oh, what, she take the shuttle? - Basically.
two days after Carlie disappeared, there were thunderstorms in Central New Jersey.
heavy, heavy rains.
the body must have been flushed down the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.
th, she slowly made her way down the Delaware and into the bay.
the movement and the battering on the rocks loosened her weight, so she floated to the surface and washed ashore.
I'm pretty sure Karen didn't see that coming, hmm?
now you're sure this is it?
zinc, mica, feces-- this is the place.
uh, it's beautiful here.
Yeah, because, you know, that's important for a murder.
okay, the bodies were wrapped on the bank of the river.
sift the soil for the missing bones.
agent Booth?
over here.
look at that-- "C. R."
Carlie Richardson's initials.
you don't pack face cream and a nightgown if you're being abducted.
lot of vacation cabins nearby.
if she was upset, this would be a good place to unwind.
Oh, Karen Tyler said that she liked Carlie.
she could have befriended her to lure her up here.
maybe Carlie's friends knew that she and Karen were getting chummy.
did Carlie know about her?
I thought they just started going out.
no. They knew each other from before.
that bastard.
Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her. That's why they were fighting.
and why she didn't want the baby.
did she say that? - I don't care what's happening.
to say that you don't want your child when you're getting ready to give birth
it's not right.
I think I did see this woman.
I was driving home from work. They were in front of a Starbucks.
I'm not sure if it was the day she disappeared, but I'm pretty sure it was around the same time.
Thanks.
your kid's eating sand.
I don't know how they can do it.
self-obsessed. They have no conscience.
I don't know.
they destroy anything that gets in their way. They're not even human.
the mothers? - Huh?
well, I was talking about the mothers.
I'm talking about the killers.
I understand killers.
I just don't know how mothers can do it.
I mean, dogs can be trained in a couple weeks.
with kids, mothers have to give up their lives for years.
I don't know. When you're looking at your kid, you don't even feel like you're giving up anything.
so you'd do it again? - What?
you'd have Parker even with everything you're going through.
what kind of question is that?
wouldn't it be easier if Parker wasn't caught in this drama of yours with Rebecca, the new boyfriend?
God, no, no. Bones, he's my son.
whatever we're going through, it's-it's not about that. He knows that.
that's what parents say when they want to justify themselves.
you know, I haven't walked out on Parker, all right?
I would never have done what your parents did.
well, I didn't say you would. I just...
I don't know.
you're the father. I don't know anything about raising kids, so...
Parker's fine.
it's not Karen Tyler. - What?
the DNA from under Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.
and something else is weird.
tissue from the fetus shows evidence of escitalopram.
what's that?
it's a drug prescribed for depression.
it's not weird.
Carlie Richardson was having emotional problems with her husband.
Carlie Richardson wasn't taking the drug.
hold on. None of this is making any sense.
I agree.
the only way the fetus could have the drug in its system is if it were passed from the mother in utero.
or through breast milk.
how do you breast-feed an unborn child?
an infant skull is made up of several separate bones that are... eventually fuse together.
look at the molding here.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
okay. Now everybody knows but me.
this is not a fetus.
the skull bones have shifted and overlapped because this child passed through the birth canal.
this baby was born alive and lived about two weeks.
but Carlie was pregnant when she was last seen.
this isn't Carlie Richardson's child.
the escitalopram in its system came from breast milk.
then what happened to her baby?
the baby was cut out of her and stolen.
this child replaced it.
this child was dead before Carlie was murdered.
you can see the traces of blood pooling in the cranium.
abusive head trauma.
evidence of shaken baby syndrome.
Oh, God.
you said the little guy was only two weeks old.
whoever the mother was was probably taking the mediation for postpartum depression.
she got upset with the baby
crying's the most common cause
and she shook him to quiet him down.
it can take as little as five seconds for an infant to die by shaking.
five seconds?
the veins that attach the brain to the inside of the skull detach.
blood pools, the brain swells...
okay, I get it.
all right, so what you're saying is that the mother kills her own son and replaces him with Carlie's.
fits the pattern-- she feels the guilt about what she's done and needs to make it right, prove to herself that she's still a good mother, so she takes Carlie's child and makes it her own.
it's only been two weeks. Not many people have seen her kid.
who would know? - Yeah, but the stab wous?
all of Carlie's stab wounds are to the upper part of the body.
the killer was careful not to hit close to the uterus because she wanted the baby alive.
your report indicas there were knife marks on the lower ribs.
they seem to be made by whatever instrument was used to remove the child after Carlie was dead.
Yup. I'm working on identifying it.
we might be able to use the child's most prominent genetic characteristics to see similarities with the mother.
can you input the information from the infant's skull to give us a face?
sure.
Yeah. Right away.
they've found Kyle Richardson.
got to wonder if he even cared, you know, finding out that his wife is dead.
he didn't kill her. - No, but he ran.
how do you just cut your family out of your life like that?
well, what about Abraham?
Oh, you're going to throw religion in my face right now?
I thought you found answers in what you believe.
I mean, that's just one Bible story that I just don't like.
I mean, God commands Abraham to kill his own son, and he does.
no, Abraham does not kill Isaac.
but old Abe, you know, he had theintention.
I thought what he had was faith.
look, I have faith, but if God himself came down, pointed at Parker and said, "I want you to...
you know? That ain't gonna happen.
well, God's messenger stopped Abraham?
Yeah. You know, grabbed his hand at the last second, right before the knife was about to go in.
okay, then the lesson I would learn from this myth...
myth?
well, it fits the definition. - Okay, fine.
that when it comes to your children, your love has to be absolute.
the messenger represents goodness, what you know to be right.
ergo, you have to remain open to what you know is true.
are you sure you're not religious?
science all the way.
science all the way.
Hey, even an empiricist can have a heart, Booth.
too bad Richardson doesn't.
just lock me up. I can't go through this anymore.
we know you didn't do it.
what?
evidence doesn't fit you.
then who was it? Who killed him?
you ran. Seems like you'd be the one who'd know.
I would have told someone if I knew.
right, cause, you know, you're such an honorable guy.
the knife, the rope, the sheeting-- it all came from your place, and why didn't you tell the police it was missing?
Oh. What, you check out what's in your garage every day?
if you didn't know anything, why'd you take off?
because I'm a bastard.
I'm a selfish, pathetic bastard, and everyone had already decided that I was guilty.
that's true, Booth. - Bones.
no wanted to find another suspect.
I kept on insisting.
thank you.
I didn't do it for you.
you are a pathetic bastard.
your wife was having your baby.
look, I did want to leave her, yeah.
I was out that night, trying to figure out how to tell her.
what with the baby and everything.
but for God sake, I didn't want them to die.
so, you have no idea who did this?
I should, shouldn't I?
I mean,
I ignored her for so long.
it's like this whole thing is my fault anyway.
you know, if I had been there that night, maybe they'd still be here.
we think your child might still be alive.
I-I don't understand. The bodies you found?
that wasn't your child.
whoever killed Carlie took your child and left theirs.
Oh, my God.
so, where's my kid?
we don't know.
Zack is working on the other knife mark.
I saw some staining in the groove it left, so I did some tests.
the stain is from Betadine.
it's an antiseptic used to prep patients for surgery.
Oh, someone was being really careful when they were cutting her up.
it was the baby they were concerned with.
were you able to get enough detail from the skull for a digital reconstruction?
Yeah. Since someone this young is still being formed, the, uh, features are generalized.
the last place I worked had a drunk sketch artist.
Wow.
it's a baby. It looks like every baby.
that's why I ran the reconstruction through an aging matrix.
it posits the most likely growth pattern the skull would follow.
now, as it ages, the features become more distinct.
by the time he's about ten, he shows very definite genetic characteristics.
don't eat that, honey.
Hey, there you go. There you go, there you go!
the mark on the ribs was from a scalpel.
the woman is a vet, so she has medical training, which also explains the Betadine.
look at her, huh? Playing with the kid.
okay.
miss Corbus?
I'm gonna have to ask you to hand us the child.
what? Why?
I think you know why.
no. You want me to give you my son? No.
he's not your son.
we know what happened.
he is. Robby is my son.
we have a warrant to take a DNA sample from you, Miss Corbus.
it'd be pretty hard to argue with that.
she didn't want him.
she told me she wished she had never gotten pregnant.
it was wrong for her to have him.
and killing your own child wasn't wrong?
that was a mistake. I am a single mother.
I'm alone. I just... I just wanted him to stop crying.
it was just... it was just a few seconds.
the doctor said I was sick, but I'm all better now.
I know, sweetie.
miss Corbus?
you can't take him from me. I'm a good mother.
you can ask anybody. I'm a good mother.
give us the child.
I'm a good mother.
Mary Corbus, you're under arrest for the murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson and the murder of your son Robert Corbus.
no, that's my Robbie, that's my Robbie.
Oh, my God!
I'm a good mother. I'm a good mother.
he's fine?
he's perfect.
and you're sure... - He's yours.
when I thought he was gone, and Carlie
I wished I could have changed how things had been.
don't you want to hold him?
I don't know, um...
the kind of guy I am...
I'm no father.
you don't get to decide that.
you have a son.
step up. Take him.
Hey.
thank you.
thank you.
so you think Richardson can rise to the occasion?
be a decent father?
he's got Carlie's parents to help him and I like to think that people can change.
faith and hope, right?
right.
Ange will throw in love, too.
love is good.
daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Parker! - Look what I did!
wow, look at that.
um, listen, you stay here with Dr. Brennan, okay?
I'm going to go talk to your mommy, all right?
all right?
so this is how it's got to go down.
I've got to meet your boyfriend with Parker here.
look, man, we're here because we want...
I'm talking to Rebecca.
look, this was Drew's idea.
and, you know, I told him it was going to be a bad one.
dad, look. - One second, bud.
Parker wanted you to see what he made for school.
and he kept saying how much he wanted us to meet.
and we'd be friends.
look, I got a kid I don't get to see much myself.
I know what it's like.
and I swear, the explosives were for work.
okay, look, look, look, look.
we are what we are.
and you can fight it if you want, but you're just going to fight with yourself.
maybe this isn't a good time.
maybe later.
no, no, it's a good time.
let me buy you a cup of coffee, all right?
let's go grab a seat. - Seriously?
Thanks, man.
that's okay, Bones, you can stay.
it's a family thing.
Bye, Parker.
Bye. - Bye.
all right, what do we got here, huh?
a diorama.
it's the zoo. Drew helped me.
the zoo? I hoped you thanked him.
he did. Yes, he did.
we gotta go to the zoo.
he knows all the animals.
all the animals?
Wow. Okay, well, maybe afterwards we could all go out to dinner if that's okay with your mom.
Yeah, that sounds good.
my dad knows a burger place.
I used to take him there after his T-ball games.
tell Drew about the burgers.
he says they're as big as my head.
as big as your head. We can all go.
we can even bring Stu...
this cemetery has been connected to our parish for almost 200 years.
3:00 am the water main broke; felt like an earthquake.
coffins were bursting out of the ground.
are you all right?
I've had some stomach problems lately.
this isn't helping.
last person was buried here over 50 years ago.
I don't know how you're gonna figure out who's who.
with burial records, identification should be pretty straightforward.
all right, let's see.
female...
40 to 50 years old, severe osteoporosis, dress and jewelry place burial around the late 19th century.
this one's in pieces.
what's going on here?
Lorraine said you're giving them church records.
the burial records, Father, so they can identify and reinter the remains.
those records are my responsibility, Father Sands.
you're to go through me before allowing their release.
I'm sorry, Father. I saw no harm in it.
I still run this parish.
I understand.
I'm Father William Donlan.
this is Dr. Brennan from the Jeffersonian and...
they can't speak for themselves?
I'm Dr. Addy.
are you one of those priests who smacks schoolchildren with rulers?
that's not allowed anymore.
we do need those burial records, Father.
and since this is a federally protected historic site
fine. But I'll to show some respect for where you are.
this is consecrated ground.
when did you say the last person was buried here?
1951。
this is a male, buried no more than five years ago without a casket.
that's impossible.
there's evidence of trauma to the frontal bone.
looks like a fatal assault.
arrange for a forensic team.
Hodgins will want to collect soil for bugs and particulates. I'll call Booth.
I'm afraid your ground was consecrated as a crime scene, Father.
you know, the priest made a complaint. pl
he said that you made fun of consecrated grounds? No, I didn't.
perhaps I was a bit colorful. Colorful?
Writerly.
I am a best-selling author, Booth.
victim is 30 to 40 years old.
he's an old school priest, Bones.
so I'm supposed to walk on eggshells because someone believes that a plot earth has supernatural properties because they waved a wand over it?
there's no wand. The church doesn't use wands.
fine. Magic water. Magic...
holy water.
the terminology makes it real?
okay, you know, I can't work with you on this case.
what do you mean?
the victim was clearly murdered.
we investigate murders
together. There's evidence of blood pooling on the frontal bone, and an absence of concentric fractures.
that requires investigation.
I'm not working a whole case with you attacking my beliefs.
you should've just sailed off with your boyfriend.
funny. A man who believes in an invisible super-being wants to run my personal life.
death would have followed quickly, caused by craniocerebral trauma. By the way, 90% of the world believes in God.
and, at one time, most people were certain that the sun revolved around the earth.
you see what I mean?
I don't think that this is about religion at all.
we obviously have issues, okay, that are affecting our working relationship.
and you're afraid to deal with them, so you just lash out at my religion.
can't you just be satisfied that if I'm wrong about God, I'll burn in hell?
that's tempting.
good. Now how about we get back to work.
you know, I think we both still want to find out who killed this man.
???
the shovel was found a few feet from where the water main burst, buried in a colony of worms. And they say Christmas only comes once a year.
the metal shavings here match the shovel.
someone was digging in the cemetery, broke the water main, resurrecting the dead.
and why was someone digging up the cemetery at 3: 00 in the morning?
maybe he came back to dig up the victim?
move him to another location.
Yeah, or bury someone else.
dark.
Yeah, and this place is always so sunny.
here's our victim.
found casings from eastern tent caterpillars in his eye sockets-- means he was buried about three years ago.
he has kind eyes.
how do you know he had kind eyes?
I had to make a choice, so I chose kind. And you wonder why I love you.
is she not fantastic?
you aren't seriously asking me to be a part of this.
get your rendering over to Booth so they can show the priests.
I am going to go resaturate the dried blood, see if it's of any value.
murder?
I don't believe it was murder.
it's not a matter of faith, Father.
the injuries are definitive.
you ever hear of the sin of pride, young woman?
you could be wrong.
Dr. Brennan here, she's the best in her field.
he would have been buried about three years ago.
I've been here for 41 years,
I would know if someone had killed and buried a man in my cemetery.
you seem quite proud yourself.
I don't need to be insulted.
knock it off.
what? The rules don't apply to him?
have you offered your guests any tea or snacks, Father?
isn't that why you're here?
I see someone wants his roast dry and overcooked tonight.
Hi, I'm Lorraine. I'm the parish administrator.
I have some refreshments inside.
and Father Matt is there, if you need to talk to him.
nicknames for priests.
last Sunday, he had the whole congregation holding hands.
no wonder there's no respect anymore.
would you mind just taking a look at this sketch we have here, please?
so, do you, uh, recognize him?
no... no, I do not.
are you sure?
I'm not senile.
I can name every child I baptized, every person I gave the last rites to, every plant on these grounds-- over 200.
that's aconite.
and this is Origanum vulgare, and over there are yew trees.
you know, it was the Druids who first thought of the yew tree as sacred.
the Christians adopted the belief, claiming it as their own.
stop...
if there's nothing else,
I'd like to finish pruning.
you go have tea with the hippie priest.
I've been here three years.
the archdiocese was thinking of closing the parish;
sent me here to try and breath some life into it.
I started a sports program for the boys, organized singles' dances.
none of this is easy for Father Donlan to accept.
so you don't believe in all the supernatural mythology he does.
well, if you're talking about the Holy Trinity, the transubstantiation of the host, and the resurrection...I certainly do.
but you seem like such an intelligent man.
you have to excuse her, Father.
no need-- God has a soft spot, even for the atheists.
I'm telling you, this is fantastic.
what is it?
she's trying to concentrate, Booth.
it's an orange-berry pound cake.
I'm sorry.
I don't think I recognize him.
???
uh, I've been here...
23 years next month.
my mother died when I was 12; the parish took me in.
I've been the administrator for seven years now.
father Donlan basically raised Lorraine.
Hey, um... you're not going to eat that, are you, Father?
no, it's okay, my stomach hasn't been too fond of me lately.
then let's get out of your way.
perhaps a nap wouldn't be a bad idea.
is there anyone else that we can show the sketch to? Why don't you bring it to mass on Sunday-- we could pass it around.
some of the parishioners have been there a long time; you might have some luck.
are you sure? Agent Booth,
I'm trying to build a community here.
if we can't work together to help solve a crime like this, then I'm not doing my job.
it doesn't help the case for you to insult the priests.
we're supposed to be gaining their trust, so they'll help us.
Matt wasn't threatened; you were.
we're definitely not working well together.
because you are bossy and judgmental.
problems between people, it's never just one person's fault.
what about Hitler? He did pretty well on his own.
bones, just...
come with me to go see Dr. Wyatt.
just once.
No! Therapy is a vague and inexact process.
the man shouldn't even be called a doctor.
well, he helped me.
I mean, are you so threatened that, uh...
you can't even do a favor for someone that you call a friend?
I will speak my mind, Booth.
I will speak my mind. Okay.
it's 7: 30, Hodgins.
well, maybe the same shovel was used as the murder weapon.
the metal residue on the skull is some sort of silver alloy.
you said you were gonna be finished in a minute.
that was an hour ago.
if I can narrow down the smelting process of the silver,
I might be able to figure out what kind of weapon we're looking for.
I love it when you talk about smelting.
Oh, yeah?
move in with me.
what?
we already live together; just... just move in.
no, we don't.
you've taken over my closet.
it's over half-full.
and over half...
is the common law definition of living together.
I have my own place, Jack.
I need my place.
I need you.
do I have to throw cold water on you two?
we were, um, just...
I know. Just try and keep it off the Internet, okay?
so, I have bad news.
we've all been exposed to coccidioidomycosis.
a fungal infection from the graveyard dirt we've been breathing.
symptoms include nausea, weakness, fever... I feel fine.
Yeah, me too.
...decreased libido.
I'm listening.
we're all gonna get shots.
Yeah, that sounds good. Very good. Yeah.
thought so.
she refers to God as my invisible friend.
you're talking to somebody who isn't there. I'm sure the doctor questions your little fantasy.
my beliefs aren't at issue here, Dr. Brennan.
clearly, she's intolerant and it's affecting her working relationship.
Yes, he's very difficult to work with.
booth said that you could fix this.
so...?
what now is proved was once only imagined.
the rat, the mouse, "the fox, the rabbit-- watch the roots
the lion the tiger, the horse, the elephant
watch the fruits.
the cistern contains, the fountain... overflows.
what?
Oh, come now. Surely you get the reference.
william Blake.
Yes. Blake is telling us that we are all at the mercy of our fundamental natures.
which is nonsense, of course, but...
when we understand our natures, we understand the resulting conflicts.
what?
I hate psychology.
as do I!
it applies a patina of science over what is essentially a dark and complex set of roiling unknowables.
you see? What?
you weren't fighting about religion.
but, that's what Booth said.
religion provided the flash point you needed to expose an underlying issue.
I will find out what that issue is, help you to resolve it, and set right the balance of dark and light in the universe.
isn't he great?
Oh,God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind, we humbly beseech you for all...
well, shouldn't Brennan be here with you... Shh.
...instead of me?
we're dealing with a few work issues.
trouble in paradise?
we're just spending some time apart.
now if you don't mind, I'd like to pray.
thank you.
did you two sleep together?
do you see where we are?
you don't talk like that in church.
what does that lab do to you people?
it's just...
this feels like a couples thing, and now that Sully is gone...
it's not.
it's a work thing.
and so is us being here, so stay focused.
we ask all these things through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
I have a unusual request before I dismiss you today.
we have Special Agent Booth and Ms. Montenegro from the Jeffersonian with us, and they need our help identifying the victim found in our cemetery. Now,
I know none of us want to get involved in something so ugly, but as Jesus said, "Whatever you do for the least of these brothers of mine, you do for me," so please, if you recognize the sketch, let them know.
how about you, Enzo?
Enzo never misses Mass.
right, Enzo?
sorry, Father,
I can't help you.
um, excuse me.
could you give him a beard?
make him heavier?
Yeah,
I can manage that.
James was an altar boy here when he was younger.
I, I think...
does this look like Father McCourt to anyone else?
Yeah, that could be him.
someone killed a priest?
thank you, James.
father McCourt was here before me.
I replaced him three years ago.
I was told he left the priesthood.
well, I suppose it might resemble Father McCourt.
so much for that sharp memory.
father McCourt wasn't here for long.
and the eyes are wrong.
that's how you recognize someone.
father McCourt's eyes were hollow, cold.
I take it you two didn't get along.
I was his confessor. You know I can't say anything.
can you tell me anything?
just... he was very secretive.
he'd disappear for hours at a time.
some nights he wouldn't even come back to the rectory.
one day he was gone.
left a note saying he was leaving the priesthood.
all right, thanks.
I've identified some odd postmortem injuries on the old bodies.
snapped fingers, fractured wrists, abrasions on the ligamenta flava.
and I found traces of gold in some of the fractures.
I don't get it.
the person who ruptured the water main that night was a grave robber.
Dr. Brennan told me she saw injuries like this in Tibet:
broken bones and bone markings from yanking jewelry and valuables off the remains.
Yeah, which means McCourt cotd have been struck by a shovel, but also he could have been struck by one of the valuables the grave robber found.
so our grave robber comes to a nice, quiet graveyard, next to a nice, quiet church whenever he's in need of some extra cash.
only to be surprised one night by Father McCourt, ???
during the 19th century, it was customary
take photograph: before burya?
???
Gertrude Watters, died 1873, and Horace Rutledge, died 1901.
and their valuables were missing?
Yes. Dr. Hodgins believes the grave robber is working in sections, focusing on the oldest first where the artifacts would have the most value.
who takes care of the cemetery?
uh, a landscaper? Janitor?
father Donlan does all the gardening.
it's, you know, sort of his obsession.
other than that, the occasional parishioner will rake leaves or, uh, shovel snow.
you all right?
you know, I can't quite shake this bug.
and I've got a wrestling team to coach.
um, do you mind?
you were in close proximity with remains.
you were probably exposed to a fungal infection.
what? Is... is that bad?
no. Yeah.
it's nothing to worry about.
I'll have my office arrange for treatment.
thank you.
???
FBI is trying to track the jewelry to pawnshops and fences.
I'm checking online auction sites.
this stuff could net a fortune.
enough to kill a priest?
apparently.
Hey, have you noticed anything going on between Brennan and Booth?
this sounds good.
there is tension.
ever since Brennan let Sully sail off into the sunset without her.
no, I didn't notice.
hmm. But then again, I didn't notice that you didn't want to live with me either.
if you're getting cold feet...
you're the only one that would feel them.
we'll discuss it at lunch.
the Egyptian place?
just got off the phone with the CDC.
the fungal infection we were exposed to from the graveyard is rare enough that they'd have records of anyone who was infected, but
but I need your samples for the strain.
you got it. Yeah.
you know, I got no problem with this place.
it's where, uh, Bones and the squints get their answers.
see?
thumbs in the belt.
that's a very aggressive stance, very male.
crossed arms... defensive.
disdain.
but let's not worry about what you do with your hands.
what you must do is to recognize your negative feelings for what is, after all, Dr. Brennan's domain and verbalize them.
verbalize them. What, now?
this place is too, uh... it's too shiny, you know, too bright.
it's clean.
and clean is bad?
death isn't clean, especially murder, which is our business, all right?
this place is completely fake.
it's bogus.
you'd like to destroy the entire edifice.
Oh, I'd like to rip the whole edifice down with my bare hands, or set it on fire except, you know, there's nothing in this place to burn.
all the plastic and the metal and the flashing lights, you know, and arithmetic.
I mean, where's a guy
a normal guy who believes in intuition and the soul and good and evil...
and God? Yes, and God, too. Where is a guy who doesn't believe in all this arithmetic supposed to stand?
so your problem with Dr. Brennan is that you don't know what will or will not catch fire or where you stand.
what? That's good.
you know, that's, that's very good.
the CDC shows that you contracted coccidioidomycosis three years ago.
the only case in the area.
well, you know, I, I, I used to do a lot of odd jobs around the parish.
I'd help Father Donlan in the garden.
I'm sure that's how I contracted it.
nice try, Enzo, but your name also came up on the auction site that was selling jewelry from the graves. Which you might have gotten away with if you hadn't hit the water main.
I want a lawyer.
Yeah, nice way to get him to clam up, thanks.
so why'd you kill Father McCourt?
did he catch you? I didn't kill anybody.
Ah, there you go. He's talking again. What the hell is wrong with you people? You think that I'd kill a priest?
your record also shows that you were assigned to court-appointed drug counseling.
okay, look, I had a drug problem and, and I needed money.
I saw these pictures in the rectory.
jewelry just buried.
you know.
I figured no one would miss it.
I didn't kill anybody, okay?
father McCourt and me, we never had that problem.
I wasn't his type-- too old.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm pretty sure it's an implication of pedophilia.
I know, Bones, okay... But you just said...
who, Enzo?
who was his type?
talk to James, okay?
the kid who I. D.'d him.
is this really Cleopatra's bed?
mm, it's a perfect replica for the new exhibit.
we're just making it a little bit more authentic.
your feet aren't cold anymore.
nice try.
Hey, I thought I was successful, but if you want me to try harder...
we can't keep our hands off each other.
I think about you all the time.
moving in is the next logical step.
I have a lease.
I have an estate.
I'll buy out your lease.
we only have 15 more minutes.
you said that we would talk.
Yeah, well, guess what?
I got distracted.
I can't believe Father McCourt's dead.
I mean, I, I thought he just took off.
you two were pretty close.
Yeah.
I w-- I was an altar boy.
Yeah, so was I.
I liked our priest, too, but, um...
what?
you think what everyone else does, don't you?
I don't know; what does everybody else think?
because we spent so much time together, he was...
touching me and stuff.
Really?
because, you know, if he did and you got mad one day and...
and killed him?
you think I killed Father McCourt?
he never touched me, not once.
he was my best friend.
my dad bailed on us when I was three.
father McCourt came to my ball games, he yelled at me about my grades.
he was the only one who actually cared.
it doesn't matter what you think.
father Donlan didn't even believe me.
father Donlan?
Yeah.
about a month before Father McCourt disappeared,
father Donlan came to my house and said he knew what Father McCourt was doing to me.
he wouldn't listen.
he was screaming that Father McCourt was going to pay for his sins.
I'm telling you, it was scary.
that old priest was crazy.
???
???
I'm strict with all the priests who are assigned to my parish.
how strict, Father?
I'm not a New Age priest like Father Matt.
the Church should be firm and act as an immovable bulwark in the face of change.
actually, organized belief systems which fail to adapt to changing mores are demoted from religions to acknowledged metaphoric myth systems.
I mean, no one worships Odin anymore or Zeus.
Thanks, Bones, I can take it from here.
you're kicking me out? Yes.
all he can think about now is giving you catechism. I need him to answer some questions. Wyatt's psychology isn't working.
father, I contacted the archdiocese about St. Agatha's and they said quite a few priests have come and gone during your tenure.
given who they send me, I've done well.
who do they send you?
priests who need firm guidance, for the most part.
in 1997, a complaint was sworn against you for assault.
is that your idea of "firm guidance"?
it was not assault, it was corporal punishment.
I found an altar boy drinking sacramental wine from the chalice. And you caned him.
the charges were dropped.
I learned my lesson, and I have never struck anyone since.
father Donlan, in your opinion, did Father McCourt pay too much attention to James LeVay?
you should ask James. I did.
James told us that you suspected the worst.
he was frightened at how angry you were.
I regret scaring him.
???
there are greenstick fractures on the victim's left ulna as well as his fibula and some ribs.
probably defensive wounds received in the struggle.
there's no evidence of a struggle.
these seem to have occurred postmortem, when he was dragged-- probably for burial.
but even getting dragged over rocks shouldn't have caused those fractures.
the matrix of the bone was weakened.
the cause could be genetic.
or it could be some chemical or medicine that compromised the tissue.
I'll need samples to run some tox screens.
all right, see these tiny metallic fragments embedded in the victim's skull? It's silver.
then I'll assume he wasn't struck by a shovel.
the silver was smelted using the led reduction method.
the fluxes used indicate it's from the early 1800s, probably during the Napoleonic Wars.
one of our old skeletons was I. D.'d as a bishop.
Bishop Jursik, died 1889.
his robes were worth a fortune.
let's find out if he was buried with something silver.
a scepter or a shepherd's crook or something else suitable for skull cracking.
booth kicked me out of here.
for you to say "kicked out" means that you've acquiesced to the idea that this is his domain.
domain, yes.
he's good at questioning people.
he can... he can tell when they're lying.
can you?
I've learned a lot from him about people.
but...?
it's not that Booth has a sixth sense.
there is demonstrably no sixth sense to have.
obviously, he reads minutiae of body language...
pupil dilation...
Yes, you... you don't sound very satisfied with your own argument there.
booth likes to say, "There are more things in heaven and earth, Bones, than are dreamt of in your science.
that's, um... a bastardization of a writer named Shakespeare, from a play called Hamlet.
Yes, yes. I-I was, um...
I was aware of that.
so if you're so uncomfortable here, why come?
because...
something goes on in here.
he does something.
and you want to find out what it is.
dissect it so that you can do it yourself.
Yes. So that you can do it without Booth.
so that you won't need him anymore. No.
no? No,
I just want to observe.
surely if you want to observe, you can do that the other side of the mirror there, instead of insisting on being in this room with him, out of your element.
observation isn't just seeing, Dr. Wyatt.
it's experiencing.
ideally, I'd prefer being inside Booth's head... you know, seeing and feeling things the way he does.
then maybe I... I'd understand.
be one with him?
in a scientific sense.
booth needs me.
Hodgins has a line on the murder weapon.
ta-ta, then.
we're done here.
Thanks.
we need to know what artifacts were buried with Bishop Jursik.
you see, there was no photograph of his burial in the paperwork that we received.
well, I'm not allowed to pull internment records without
father Donlan's permission.
where is she going?
you are approaching the altar.
very sensitive area.
all right, listen, you must have known
father McCourt pretty well. Did him and Father Matt similar tastes?
look, the only similarity I know of was that they were from the same seminary.
same seminary?
look, Agent Booth, there's so much suspicion and innuendo these days.
this is a good parish.
the Father makes sure of that. What's that?
it's the chalice. Oh, no, it's, it's the vessel in which the wine is transformed into the blood of Christ.
don't touch it! No. It is going to be touched,
booth, it's silver and these little eagles are a common Napoleonic motif.
you're saying that it's, uh...
possible that this could be a murder weapon? Yeah.
can we take this with us or do we need to serve a warrant on God?
it's a match.
the silver fragments in Father McCourt's skull came from that chalice.
that officially looks the least like a murder weapon than any murder weapon I've seen.
the green bone response indicated the injury was inflicted perimortem.
that means he might've already been dead when he was struck.
so we have no cause of death? Yes, we do.
McCourt was poisoned.
an alkaloid called taxin.
could it have been accidental?
not at these concentrations.
well, I'll go compile a list of possible sources of the poison at the church.
so what if they went to the same seminary?
well, then why didn't Father Matt mention it, huh?
what else is he not saying? This is intuition, right?
you're subconsciously recalling pupil dilation or some pheromones?
you know what? We're not talking the same language here.
no, no, no.
that's not a Butcher. Come here, Tony.
why'd you always pick me, Father? Take Sam.
let's go. Watch.
now from here, Tony can reach around to my right arm. He uses his left knee against my left hip and...
okay? Tony's in control.
I'm helpless. And he can score some back points.
good job, Tony.
let me up.
that's the Butcher.
learn it, love it.
use it to smite your enemies in the name of our loving Lord.
pair up. Get it right.
kid took me down for real.
that shot must not be working, Doc.
so... what can I do for you today?
Yeah, Father, I... You and Father McCourt were in seminary at the same time. Right.
but I told you, I never met Father McCourt.
what, you guys never got together, compared wrestling moves?
I didn't know him there.
did you know everyone who went to your college?
you do know why Father McCourt was sent here.
Yeah, I've heard the rumors.
that's all.
do you base all your investigations on rumors,
agent Booth?
he has a point, Booth.
you know, St. Agatha's has been a dumping ground for troubled priests for some time, so it's reasonable to suggest that you're one of them.
I told you why I was sent here.
I got work to do.
so you still think that Father Donlan is the killer?
I mean, Matt...
could have killed McCourt and taken his post.
Why? Because McCourt was going to come clean about being a pedophile.
maybe accuse Matt, if they knew each other.
of course... there's no evidence of that.
I have no intuition.
none. Zilch. And you have no analytical skills. I mean, you're all about emotion and feeling. Well...
they say that means you have a well developed feminine side.
who? Who says that?
psychologists. Oh...
what? You're the one who believes in them.
let's just stick to the case.
we know that Father Donlan is this harsh, judgmental guy.
he keeps being sent these, uh, problematic priests.
there's McCourt, there's Father Matt... No proof.
Yeah, but Bones, it happens. All right? So, anyways...
father Donlan, he's getting old, he can't deal, so he takes action. Old Testament action?
all right, there you go again. You're attacking God.
I'm not attacking God. He doesn't exist. He's not scandals, okay?
quarreling?
Yes, of course you are.
uh, cup of coffee, please, Vera darling.
I am here to put right what has been rent asunder.
great. You've figured out our problem.
Yes. From three meetings?
I knew what your problem was right off the bat, if you'll forgive a cricket metaphor.
the meetings were for fun.
booth never knows where to stand when he's in the lab. Feels like teats on a bull whenever he's there.
Ditto Dr. Brennan in the interrogation room.
simple geography, sense of belonging, et cetera. But that's not the main problem.
he can't possibly know.
Yes, I do.
you're both afraid that the reason Dr. Brennan with her boyfriend Sully might have been because of her ties to Agent Booth.
you are both...
quite wrong.
why didn't I go with Sully?
how's he supposed to know?
Sully is perfect.
we communicated well. The sex was incredible.
he invited me to sail around the South Seas in a beautiful yac for a year.
I mean, why would anyone turn that down?
in my opinion, you are unable to lead a purposeless life at this stage in your psycho-social development. Which, by the way, is a issue you should address, because a certain amount of purposelessness is necessary to lead a full life. I hate psychology.
you don't like it because he's saying that all these tension between me and you is your fault.
on the contrary.
if anything, your issues are more pronounced given that your behavior has been affected by what turns out to be a quite irrational fear of being responsible for somebody else's destiny.
that makes sense.
Oh, now you like psychology?
I think you'll both be able to work together just fine now that your minds have been set at ease.
thank you, Vera.
Ta-ta.
you, uh... feel anything?
feel?
Yeah. You must...
feel something.
I do.
you know what I feel?
father Matt has been sick a long time.
he got treated for the fungus.
but he hasn't shown any signs of recovery.
so? I feel that's weird.
I mean, his symptoms should've cleared up by now.
I feel that since Father McCourt was poisoned...
we should have Father Matt checked for the same poison.
what? We're back.
we're back.
poisoned?
Yes, Father.
by something called taxin.
father McCourt was poisoned?
poison's easily derived from boiling yew tree needles.
we have yew trees at St. Agatha's.
symptoms include nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, stomach ache, diarrhea, spasms and death.
well, I have all those, except for death.
so far.
we suspect the poison weakened him, made him unable to defend himself.
defend himself from whom?
someone much weaker than himself.
say, an old man.
yellow.
yellow? What does that mean?
the good news is we know how to make you feel a lot better.
bad news is someone's trying to kill you.
so things are all right?
according to the psychiatrist, we were both concerned that Booth was the reason I didn't run off with Sully.
it wasn't?
no. It's because I'm currently unable to live a life without tangible focus.
so, you know, sailing around paradise with a man I adore...
you believe that?
well, if I expect people to defer to me as an anthropologist, I have to concede to their fields of expertise.
right.
and our working relationship has definitely improved, so...
maybe I should talk to this guy.
Why?
Hodgins asked me to move in with him, but I'm not sure.
I mean, what's the problem?
Hodgins is perfect.
I'm nuts about him.
I'll call the doctor.
I'm certain that I am innocent of whatever it is you think I did this time.
can you identify this clipping, sir?
taxus baccata
the European or common yew.
then you're aware that it's poisonous.
did you bring me here to test my botanical knowledge?
both Father McCourt and Father Matt suffered yew poisoning.
the hell you say.
is he allowed to say that?
Dr. Brennan's people can prove that the poison from the yew tree came from your own yard.
both Fathers McCourt and Sands?
it's why Father Matt has been so sick.
can you think of anyone else who'd want to poison these two priests, aside from you?
no.
no one.
I'm going to need a lawyer.
a damn Jesuit would be best.
are you confessing, Father?
Yes. I did it.
what?
when this goes to trial, Father...
you'reonna have to place your hand on the Holy Bible and swear to God to tell the truth.
you gonna be able to do that?
what's going on?
get me my lawyer.
see, I don't think you will.
Why?
you didn't do it.
see, it's time to render unto Caesar.
on one condition:
I take the confession.
I never set out to kill Father McCourt.
you poisoned him.
I saw the way he looked at James LeVay.
I tried to give him just enough poison to make him too sick to want to...
but he fell and hit his head.
he wasn't breathing.
I had to make sure he was dead.
I couldn't bury him without making sure.
and the heaviest thing she could find was the chalice.
and Father Matt?
wrestling.
boys were all over him.
and I knew better this time.
less poison.
father McCourt was a mistake, Father. I...
Lorraine, there was no proof that Father McCourt touched anyone.
only rumors.
and Father Matt...
you were so angry at Father Matt.
I see the way you look at him.
because he was sent here to replace me.
what you saw was my own pride, my own weakness.
father Matt is a good man.
I was trying to help.
I was just trying to help.
do you absolve me, Father?
we're not alone with God, Lorraine.
this is not that kind of confession.
excuse us.
Dr. Wyatt.
we need you to do it with her.
w-would that I could, but unfortunately, my heart belongs to another.
no, it's actually my... boyfriend asked me to move in with him, and I need to know if I should or not.
I told her to talk with you.
look, I absolutely refuse to be relegated to the role of some sort of advice columnist or daytime television shrink.
well, Brennan says that you're the only psychological type who's ever made any sense to her.
Yes, well, now, of course you're flattering me, so obviously I'm helpless.
all right, so what made you think you should move in with him in the first place?
the closet test.
over half of his closet is filled with my things.
I see. And what about your own closet?
it overfloweth with his things, does it?
uh, no.
it doth not.
well, then I suggest you wait until it does, thus rendering you manifest equals, tabling until that day the vexed question of who should move in with whom.
he is good.
I told you.
as a stopgap, you should remove enough clothing from his closet so as to occupy less than 30 percent of the space.
you know, the accent makes everything that you say sound really smart.
stopgap.
no, you're not leaving, are you, Dr. Brennan?
booth and I have to put our notes together for the prosecutor.
so...
so you and Booth, um...
you making any further assumptions about each other?
no.
no assumptions.
Thanks.
good.
well, look at that.
you fixed them, too.
all right, listen up,
Monty Python.
you got it right with Hodgins and I, that's fine.
but we both know that you are full of it on the other thing.
I have no idea to what you refer.
Brennan didn't run off with Sully because she cannot live a life without focus.
she stayed because of Booth.
Ah, now you're projecting, Ms. Montenegro.
agent Booth and Dr. Brennan are not you and Dr. Hodgins.
I stand by my diagnosis.
you stand by the FBI.
your first priority is to get agents back into the field, solving murders.
your romanticism is endearing, but as the Bard says, "Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, "such shaping fantasies, that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends.
he also says, "Journeys end in lovers meeting, every wise man's son doth know.
hm. Excellent.
you betcha... Monty.
so no one touched the body?
I don't know. We're going to need an ID ASAP.
could be dealing with a group that's acquired nuclear material.
it's actually glowing? - Oh, yes.
I'll need a video link with my lab. -Excuse me, Major.
the reactor at Kensington is secure.
all transports carrying radio active material have been halted.
Dr. Brennan's going to need a video link up to the Jeffersonian.
as soon as possible. The rain's really slowed things up.
all right, thanks. See, uh, bodies, they don't usually glow.
Yeah, well, that's why we're taking all these precautions.
all right, this is potassium iodide. These are your suits.
pills? - Yeah. It helps...
the thyroid block the absorption of radiation.
you know...
angela turned down Hodgins again. - What?
Hodgins proposed and Angela turned him down. - You really want to talk about that now?
why not? There's been no confirmation of danger. - It's just, you know, weird.
you know, talking about, uh, marriage when we're trying to avoid radiation poisoning.
what's weird is Angela thinking about marriage at all.
people fall in love and they get married, that's what people do.
you didn't want to talk about it. - I'm just saying...
you believe in love, don't you?
I believe that dopamine and norepinephrine stimulate euphoria because of certain biological triggers like scent, symmetrical features...
symmetrical features? -Yes, it's an indication of a good breeder.
you appear to be a very good breeder.
how long have you two been going out?
we're... -We're...
we're partners. - Partners.
me and my partner talk baseball.
you might not want to admit it, Bones, but there's some things, like love, that just can't be measured in your lab.
Oh, what's that mean? - 300 millirems.
well, that's perfectly normal.
if we get a reading of 3, 000 or more, then we worry. It could be a weapon.
nuclear? - The suits would be useless against that.
Oh, great, thanks.
the body's in there.
anybody getting an increase? - All clear here. No, nothing here.
female, mid-20s, early 30s, Caucasian.
looks like she's been there a while.
probably not that long; rats and weasels work pretty quickly.
there's no radiation in here.
then why the hell is it glowing? - I don't know.
but it's your problem now.
all right
multiple stab wounds.
why is she glowing?
I have no idea.
no idea at all.
nicks on the ribs and hemorrhaging in the adjacent intercostal muscles are consistent with stabbing.
repeated stabbing.
someone was angry.
incised cuts on the left radius and ulna are congruent with defensive injuries.
still no answer for the luminescent bones?
it's not like we get a human lightbulb in here every day.
I've got mature first instar Phaenicia sericata about to moult.
indicates she's been dead approximately 48 hours.
I've got to take more scrapings from the bones to analyze for luminescence.
you can scrape this area.
okay, squint squad, why does she look like a glow stick?
why does everyone think my job is so easy?
wow, you weren't kidding.
if we twirl her around, we can pretend we're at a rave.
what's the good word, Hodgins? - Hey, I am not a party trick.
are you okay?
the bones probably remind him of Waitomo Cave. - Not... true.
I've been there in New Zealand, it's filled with tiny glowing worms and in the darkness it looks like thousands of stars...
very romantic.
Yes, that's where he was going to take Angela for their honeymoon.
if she'd said yes... which she didn't.
okay, look, people, Angela and I are cool. Okay?
but she's complicated.
I will figure her out though, just like these electric bones.
so let's all just go back to work, okay?
all right. - Okay. Sure.
nice bracelet.
do you need the left hand? - No, too fleshy and no stab wounds.
just how I like 'em.
Oh... what are you doing? Plugging a dyke or something?
the left hand was lodged under the body.
a lack of exposure preserved some of the dermis.
we might be able to get a print. -From that? It's all shriveled.
can you pour fabric softener. - Yeah, sure.
my mom used to use this stuff. I didn't know it was so, uh, scientific.
say when. -That's good.
you think Hodgins is okay? - No, not at all.
well, they seem to be jumping each other like rabbits.
well, he wants more. - How sweet.
Oh, you think all a man wants is sex? -No, of course not.
beer, too. Chips, salsa...
Oh, come on, Cam, I mean, when we were together, you think that we could, you know...
get married? -No. Nah, me neither.
but wasn't there a moment, just a moment, where you felt... wow.
it's a finger again.
you know what I felt, Seeley?
I felt...
satisfied.
very satisfied.
and grateful that I had my own place, my own single life, and you were, too.
why are we even talking about this?
check this out.
whoa. - One perfect fingerprint.
unbelievable, all from fabric softener?
rehydrates dried tissue and fights static cling. -Eh, geez. Puffy soft, huh?
21 loads, look at that.
okay, Carly Victor, 29...
do you know her? - Yeah, she's that celebrity chef.
Carly's Table over on Calvert. Chef would explain the cuts to her left hand and the burns.
all right, this is her MySpace page.
is that the place with the famous mac and cheese?
Yeah, it's, like, impossible to get into. - Totally impossible.
you, too? - Mac and cheese, that's God's best handiwork.
she puts leeks in it and little bits of pancetta it was delicious.
how did you get in?
I'm a best-selling author, Booth I get in anywhere. I took Sully.
did he have...? -Said it was "the best he ever ate.
why are all those pictures on her page?
that's friends...different communities she's joined. blogs, her husband, cooking videos.
a lot of knives in the kitchen. Easy grab for one of these "friends" to stab her.
why don't you check the pages and see if anyone had a problem with her.
I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill Carly.
she came out to see if we were enjoying our meal.
we talked for a while, I was supposed to go back and see her next week.
are you okay, honey? - Yeah.
I'm just used to victims being strangers.
we should tell her husband, Booth. - Sure.
welcome to Carly's Table. Do you have a reservation?
like that's possible.
Oh, Dr. Brennan. I'm sorry I didn't see you there.
we're very crowded tonight, so you might have to wait for a few minutes.
you can walk in here without a reservation? - We need to talk to Dan.
Carly's husband. - Oh, just a moment.
she knows he's Carly's husband.
bones, Bones, Bones, mac and cheese, mac and cheese.
wow... that's amazing.
...awesome, we'd love to tell Carly.
she's a little slammed right now, but I'll be sure to pass on the compliments, all right?
all right, take care.
Oh, Carly's in the kitchen? - Yeah, she's back there 24/7.
you have to drag her out. Dr. Brennan, right?
Yes. This is my partner, Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Hi. -We know she's not back there, Dan.
I just can't imagine she's... she's gone.
I'm so sorry, Dan.
when was the last time you saw her? - Friday night.
a lot of the restaurants around here have been getting robbed, so...
Carly didn't want to leave the cash here.
she and Abby took the cash and drove it to the ATM.
who's Abby? -Abby Singer.
she and her boyfriend, Ben, are our business partners. They're friends first.
Abby organizes Carly's endorsements... I mean, it's...
it's not Abby as well, is it? - No, we only... we only found Carly.
has Ben heard from Abby?
Ben's -- he's in the Guard.
and, um, he's been gone for the weekend. He should be back in a couple hours.
help me understand something here, Dan.
your wife disappears and you don't report her missing?
she would take these spur-of-the-moment trips to Atlantic City with Abby to kind of blow off steam.
she wouldn't tell you first?
no, she wouldn't tell me 'cause she didn't want me to say "no.
listen, what kind of car did they leave in?
she, um... she had an old Volvo.
Abby did.
the picture was taken just before we opened.
I'll get a search team on it.
you find anything?
Yeah, jealous chefs, vicious critics, fans that were a little too in love with her.
fame is creepy. -They say chefs are the new rock stars.
they do deal with knives and fire and food.
it's pretty sexy. - Yeah?
well, then tonight...
I'll take a knife and fire, and make you an orgasmic grilled cheese sandwich.
Oh, suddenly I'm starving.
Oh, good Lord. You have to stop mounting each other in the office.
doesn't marriage destroy sex? Please, Angela, say yes.
we were working. - You were working it.
a little professionalism would be nice, people.
I found some organic material in a cut on her left hand.
I need to know what it is. - I'm on it.
and you? Anything? -Yeah, I found out how to make braised beef.
I found out that Carly loved sushi.
I found out... -My God...sushi.
Yes, that is it. You are brilliant.
you're my muse. Check out all the sushi restaurants on her site.
at least he didn't jump you. -True.
so you were with the Reserves -At Fort Eustis. Survival training.
you're sure Carly was murdered? - Yes.
I mean, isn't there anything I could be doing?
helping you look for Abby. I mean, I can't just sit here.
we're doing everything we can to find her.
and you're looking for whoever's been robbing the other restaurants?
we just don't have a description yet, that's all.
why didn't Dan report them missing?
he said that they would take off sometimes. Go to Atlantic City.
Yeah, but still.
the restaurant was booming.
I mean, he should have known that she wouldn't just leave.
listen, do you, uh...
you and Dan-- are you having problems? - What? No.
no. He just doesn't think sometimes.
I mean, we're not in school anymore.
I just would have done something, that's all.
look, here's Abby's picture if you need it.
just find Abby.
please.
the sushi got me thinking. P. phosphoreum.
it's a bacteria that grows in seafood.
a luminescent bacterium? - Exactly.
vibrio bacteria, which, when catalyzed by luciferase, causes the bones to glow.
so if the knife that was used to stab Carly contained P. phosphoreum, it would've entered her bloodstream.
and it would be left on the bones as the tissue decomposed and was stripped by the rats.
seafood. So that narrows it down... to every restaurant in the area.
no. The tissue Cam found-- it's Uni, sea urchin, a specialty in one of Carly's favorite sushi restaurants.
Carly's blog mentions an old friend who's the chef at a sushi restaurant.
SushiGuy23. How imaginative.
executive chef at Sushi Beat Restaurant.
and when we link to his page... -That's Carly.
with SushiGuy.
Yeah...and his knife -Can you believe this place? -Yeah. Fresh toro today.
cherry-picked the most marketable elements of a very complex and vibrant culture,
Yeah, well, so is murder, okay? So just stay focused.
Hey, Ernie, have a minute? - I guess.
can I get you anything?
no. We're just here to ask... - Oh, sure.
I mean, if you have some of that fresh toro left, that would be great.
what? Might as well eat lunch while we're here.
you and Carly Victor were high school sweethearts, right?
Why? What's going on?
uh, when was the last time you saw her? -Uh, Thursday of last week.
Why? Did something happen to her? - Do you serve sea urchin?
uni, yeah. It's one of my specialties. You want some?
sure. -No.
is this about Dan? Did Dan find out she was with me?
Why? What's going on between you and Carly? -Nothing.
we reconnected on MySpace.
she wanted to learn about Japanese cuisine, so I was teaching her how to make sushi.
secretly?
why, because Dan hated Japanese food? - Because he's so jealous.
everybody loved Carly. It drove him crazy.
Carly even left him once. - Why'd she go back?
delicious. - Thank you.
what's going on? Is Carly okay?
Carly's dead.
Dan? That son of a bitch.
we don't know who it was, but she was stabbed, Ernie, and we found bacteria associated with sea urchin in her system.
it can only enter the body through the bloodstream.
what, you think I killed her? Why would I kill Carly?
well, that's more his area.
you love her, she says that she'll leave Dan, she doesn't, you get mad.
she's got the fishy virus. You got all these fishy knives.
wait. Wait, wait. Last time Carly was here, she cut herself, and I wanted her to get stitches, but she wouldn't.
I'd like to borrow your knives, Ernie, and compare them to the injuries we found on Carly.
you know, a lot of people have knives like mine.
are you saying no? Because that really wouldn't look too good.
can I get a spicy tuna roll?
I fed the measurements of the knives into the computer
angles of the blades, thickness-- and compared it to the injuries we found on the bones.
none of them match the damage evident on the corticalsurface of the ribs or the defensive wounds.
no, but we do have one match.
this knife and the cut on her left hand.
they knife they used when preparing the Uni.
that must be how it entered her bloodstream.
SushiGuy23 was telling the truth. -So he's not a murderer.
we can still eat at the restaurant.
what? Booth said the toro was fantastic.
are you still torturing Hodgins? - He loves it.
－Just tell him no, put him out of his misery. -What if I want to say yes?
you? Get married?
sometimes your brain just shuts off because you're...in love.
one can't logically base a decision on momentary happiness.
haven't you ever just looked at a guy and said, screw it?
maybe not the best choice of words, okay, but...
like when you were with Sully.
don't you regret letting him go?
I made a decision.
regrets serve no real purpose.
if you want to be impulsive, why don't you just say yes?
because I've also got you in my head telling me that marriage will hobble my personal and legal freedoms.
you're a very difficult best friend to have.
I'll grab my things.
Ernie's story checked out.
Carly took out a restraining order on Dan, and Dan took out a $2 million life insurance policy on her.
see, marriage-- it... - Oh, just go.
I'm going.
you guys had to shut down, huh?
Yeah. Carly's without Carly doesn't make much sense.
Yeah, that's got to be rough.
I mean, you know, absorbing that kind of hit, financially.
look, man, his wife was murdered, and my girlfriend's missing.
money is the last thing on our minds.
Yeah, right, right, I-I... Yeah. I understand. It's just, I mean...
here you guys are just, you know, poring over the books.
most of our staff live paycheck to paycheck.
you know? We have to pay them.
where is the other knife? - I don't know. It's been missing for years.
Carly actually got it as a gift from the first chef that she worked for.
maybe it's just been missing since you found out about, uh, Carly and Ernie Summers.
Ernie Summers? The sushi guy?
I'd like to take this set of knives. -Sure.
No! - Hey, relax, man.
if you just let them take the knives... -These bastards cannot come in here and start accusing me...
Carly was meeting up with Ernie secretly. You assumed the worst?
that's not true. - You confronted her, one thing led to another.
Carly was involved with him?
maybe Abby heard you fighting, she tried to get in the middle of it.
you son of a bitch!
she got caught up in the middle. - Get off of me!
you know, I'd back down if I were you. He shot a clown once.
you're good? Good? - Yes, I'm good.
we know about the restraining order and your drinking.
what did you do, Dan? - Nothing, okay?
we had some problems. I went into rehab...
you were drinking last week, Dan, before I left. - A couple glasses of wine, okay?
the stress of everything. - And Carly?
Yes, and Carly. - Why didn't you tell us about that insurance polic
it was Ben's idea. This restaurant would be worth nothing without Carly.
we have investors. We had to protect them.
but if you had a problem with Carly, I mean, you wouldn't need the restaurant, still get your payday.
take the knives. Take anything you want.
you son of a bitch. You think that... - Where's Abby?
for God's sakes, are you people crazy? I-I... - Booth.
I loved Abby. I loved Carly. It was the four of us. - Thanks.
helicopter spotted Abby's car.
bones, stay back.
you- you should wait here until we can determine if she's in the car and... if she's alive.
did you find her? - No one's in the vehicle, sir.
what about the trunk? - I haven't checked yet.
give me a crowbar. - Come on!
she's alive! Get an AEREVAC here right away! -???
hang on, baby, please.
I don't understand. Why wasn't Abby killed, too?
funny, but I haven't found a written confession yet.
but she's a witness.
blood traces on the dashboard where the vinyl split.
lots of blood on the seat, the floor mats.
looks like Carly was definitely killed inside the car.
maybe whoever did this saw what he'd done and lost the stomach for it when it came to Abby.
hello. Possible semen and vaginal contributions.
cause this wasn't nasty enough.
Ooh! Smells like a urinal.
she was locked up for 36 hours.
I can tell you, all she was worried about was surviving.
sorry. I forgot you were buried.
look, if this is too difficult, Hodgins...
if I can help lock up this bastard that did this, at least someone gets justice, right?
whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. - What is it?
Ah! Unidentified particulates. The two sweetest words I know.
I don't even want to think about your pillow talk with Angela.
the missing knife??? utility knife, but sharp or dull, it couldn't have made those injuries you found.
so, the edge was even sharper? - Yeah.
how much can you magnify the cut to that rib?
I can go about 600 times before degrading the image.
most blades are irregular and pitted so they show on the bone.
this is a knife without imperfections on its edge.
do you really think her husband killed her?
I mean, it would make sense he would spare Abby.
I don't think I'm the person to ask about psychology of relationships.
you know, when I said before that you were the difficult friend inside my head, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Yeah, I know that sharing a strong emotional attachment with another human being can be a good thing, but there seems to be a disconnect between my mind and...
you know, I...I shouldn't have brought up Sully before.
I'm sorry.
it's just...
if a relationship seems more than casual,
I feel that I need to posit the potential problems, probabilities of success and failure or...
you get scared.
but I miss so much, don't I?
I want to say no, but yeah...
...you do...and so does whoever you're keeping yourself from.
I compared the hairline fracture on Carly's skull to the damaged dashboard.
the fracture was the result of her head smashing into it.
hemorrhaging indicates it was ante-mortem.
these white shards were found in the trunk and some were caught on her socks.
FBI techs also found similar shards in the old house.
so I'm running a chemical analysis, but I'd say this is some kind of ceramic.
what? Like pottery?
actually, ceramics are used in everything from semiconductors to medical implants.
this is a very hard ceramic. It's probably eight mohs.
yeah? - Yeah.
what's that mean?
that it was most likely used for industrial applications.
D--Mm. - What?
no, I'm not going to ask again.
about the ceramic stuff? - No.
no more. I'm done.
Oh. You're done with Angela? - No, but...
...hey, I fell in love with a free spirit and if getting married makes her feel trapped or something, then I-I'm just going to have to deal with it.
right, so you don't want to get married anymore? - Sure I do.
you know what? This whole ceramic stuff was making more sense to me.
but Angela doesn't, and I don't want to drive her away like you did with Rebecca.
Oh. I did not drive Rebecca away.
we both agreed that it wasn't right. - After you asked and she said no.
well, when you say it like that, it's...
if it had been right, it wouldn't matter if you were married or not, would it?
because you'd have a life together.
great, then why not get married? - Because then we wouldn't be able to be together.
see, this is all coming so clear now. - Ha, not really.
you put on that macho front, but inside you understand.
I don't understand. - That whichthe mind can't grasp.
all right, you know, I'm just trying to catch a murderer, but you seem to have gone way past that.
it means a lot, knowing that you get it, man.
most guys are not secure enough to admit that.
I have a headache. Booth.
Yeah, I'm on my way. Abby just... woke up.
I need you to figure out what that stuff is. Okay.
um, it's so much easier just to fight and shoot guns.
bones, she's awake! We're going!
uh... we had a lot of cash.
there had been robberies. Carly wanted to take the money to the ATM.
her and Dan fought about it, but Carly always did what she wanted.
he ran outside yelling. I didn't want to get in the middle of it.
y-you're sure? She was stabbed?
Yes. - What happened when you got in the car?
we didn't suspect anything.
he must have been hiding in the back seat.
did you get a look at him? - No.
he was wearing a mask.
I panicked. I,uh...
I tried to get out of the car, a-and he must have hit me, uh...
cause the next thing I remember...is waking up in the trunk, and, uh, you know, I......I thought I'd been buried alive.
do you have any idea what that feels like?
actually, I was buried alive in a car just a few months ago with a colleague.
we were able to use the airbag cannis... - Bones.
it's a rhetorical question.
I tried to fight. - It's not your fault.
was it...
did she suffer?
it was very quick.
the, uh...the four of us were planning on taking a vacation together after the cookbook came out.
I'm sorry.
I took a second look at Carly's cervical vertebrae.
the damage matches an acceleration flexion-extension neck injury.
whiplash. - Abby's car stops suddenly,
Carly doesn't have her seat belt on, she's propelled forward, slamming her head into the dashboard and injuring her neck.
exactly. - What about what you found in the back seat?
the vaginal secretions are consistent with Carly's DNA.
so she was raped before she was killed? - Any match on the semen?
I ran the seminal DNA through CODIS and the military database.
I found a match.
Abby's boyfriend?It would explain why he spared Abby.
Carly's husband said Ben was with the reserves when Carly was killed.
wonder how hard is it to sneak off base?
he wasn't on base. He was alone in the woods doing survival training.
he could go, rape and kill Carly, and no one even find out he left
you spoke to Captain Gerard? Why didn't you just talk to me?
your reserve unit spent last weekend reviewing survival skills?
Yeah. We were each dropped off at isolated locations, and given rudimentary supply and navigation kits.
so basically, you were alone for two days. No one to corroborate your whereabouts.
what are you saying? - You spent two tours in Iraq, the captain says you were one of his best men.
someone as well-trained as you would have easily been able to leave your assigned location and return to your rendezvous point, with no one the wiser.
but I didn't. - See, at first, I was wondering, "Why would a carjacker kill one of his victims and let the other victim stay alive?
that doesn't make sense. Hey, unless... maybe there's no carjacker.
what, do you actually think that I had...
the insurance money would've given you over a half million dollars.
you've killed before. I've been in the service.
some guys, they just numb to it. -What? This is insane.
then again, killing your meal ticket is one thing, and then killing your girlfriend, that's another.
so, you locked Abby in the trunk -No!
see, the one thing I don't understand...
the rape. -Yeah.
what? - We have your DNA, from the back seat of the car.
yours and Carly's.
so what was it, then?
did you get turned on thinking about killing her?
I want a lawyer. - I'll bet you do.
you know we'll get him, Bones, all right, don't worry.
we do this all the time. You know, I should be used to it.
it shouldn't bother me. - No. It should.
was she really going to teach you how to cook? - Yeah.
I've always understood the basics of cooking, the physics of it, but Carly said she was going to show me what it was really about.
to her, she said that it was a way of...
well, she said "loving," but then she was prone to hyperbole.
well, hey, I mean, that's what family dinner is all about, right?
those are some of my, uh, my best memories.
I'm not as cold as everyone thinks, Booth. -Okay, that was a leap.
just because I think marriage is an antiquated ritual doesn't mean that I don't want Angela and Hodgins to be happy.
I have an appreciation and a need for emotional and physical intercourse just like you.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, okay. Good for you with that.
did I make you uncomfortable? - No.
not at all. I just want to focus... Let's just focus on the case.
I did make you uncomfortable.
listen, Abby, I know it's hard for you to go through this again, but do you remember hearing the carjacker's voice?
I must have.
close your eyes for me, okay?
I want you to try and hear that voice again. Can you do that for me?
does it sound familiar?
someone you might know?
what are you saying?
we're just asking, Abby. - Why?
Ben's story that night...it might not check out.
what are you talking about? Ben would n...
we're like a family. It's not Ben.
Abby, it's just a question we have to ask.
do you remember the car making a sudden stop?
No...but I-I was unconscious in the trunk.
could that be how she broke her wrist? - Possibly.
or when she was dragged or thrown into the trunk.
Abby, may I have permission to review your medical records?
they could help us identify Carly's killer.
but...do you think it might really be Ben?
it's just a possibility we have to pursue, that's all.
okay. -Thanks.
I did it. I found the murder weapon. Or what's left of it, anyway.
I used the GC Mass Spectrometer to analyze the ceramic shards from the car.
the murder weapon was a ceramic bowl?
it's not just the bowl that's ceramic, the knife is, too.
booth mentioned that companies were sending her their products to endorse.
a ceramic knife?
Brennan. - The murder weapon was a ceramic knife.
Hodgins found the murder weapon. -Zirconium oxide-super sharp, but easy to shatter.
in this case, you shatter it into a million pieces, no one knows it's a knife.
except me, of course.
using Angela's program, I matched the wounds to the blade.
either that trunk was packed with invisible pillows, or Abby's lying to us.
Why? - Booth?
Yeah, Booth. Talk to me, squints. As close to English as possible.
according to the medical report, Abby's got bumps and bruises, yes, but, they aren't at all consistent with the way she would have been thrown around in that trunk.
she should have had more broken bones.
is there any evidence of Carly being raped?
none that I found. -Me either.
but...the wounds on the ribs, the, the directionality of impact was left to right.
of course. - It fits the scenario I was working out.
so obvious. - English, remember? Okay?
how does Ben figure in all this? - He doesn't.
the injuries fit, if Abby was driving when the sudden stop occurred.
Abby? - Yes, Abby.
why Abby? -Look, I'm Abby. You're Carly.
why am I always the murder victim? - Sit.
Zack's always the murder victim. -Now, I'm sitting to the left. Just driving along.
I undo Carly's seat belt, slam on the brakes. She goes flying into the dash.
go. Go, fly into the dash.
the concussion disorients me. - Okay, don't overdo it, sport.
okay, what are we missing here? - The Stooges.
Abby's scaphoid fracture was right to left, which means she could have received that break while stabbing Carly.
Yes. - I was wearing a punk bracelet, lots of metal.
that could easily fracture the scaphoid.
okay, what, look, we know Ahh. that Ben had sex with Carly in the back seat of that car.
but you didn't find evidence of rape. - So the sex they had was consensual.
this part will be left up to the imagination.
and, since there's no way to pinpoint the time the sexual activity took place...
Ben and Carly were having an affair. - And they did it in Abby's car?
no wonder she was pissed.
Abby is in charge of, uh, of all the equipment Carly is sent for endorsement, so she knows about the knife...
so, Abby kills Carly. - Yes.
Abby kills Carly, pulls her out of the car. - Oh, boy.
drags her into the old stone house. - I don't think this is necessary.
destroys the murder weapon, leaving us little tiny shards to find.
drives the car into the ravine, where she expects it'll be found quickly...
and locks herself in the trunk.
but there was no hikers in the area to find her because she didn't count on the rain.
let's go back, Booth.
Carly was my best friend.
she was my best friend.
Hey, what are you doing in here? I thought we were going for sushi?
it smells like sushi in here. - Yeah.
look, Angela, I've been thinking.
you're not like anyone I've ever known.
and I don't want that to change.
so I'm taking you the way you are. No strings.
and the smell? - P. phosphoreum.
Ugh, the fish bacteria? -Close your eyes.
be careful. - Yeah.
keep 'em closed.
okay.
Yes. Yes.
let's get married. - No.
no, no, no, this is not a proposal. -I know.
that's why I'm asking you.
what you said here, that we're enough, just this, no pressure for more...
that's all that I ever wanted.
Hodgins. Say something.
you're insane. - Is that a yes?
Absolutely.
okay, okay, um...All right, how, how about, uh... - Yeah.
italy, Italy in, in the spring. Um...Umbria. - No.
right away. Next week.
we cannot get a wedding together in a week. - We have to.
one week. I could change my mind.
it's up to you. - Okay, yeah, just a small little thing, then.
no big. I want a big one.
totally insane.
you know, you should let me help. - No.
cleaning up. You can do that. -Great.
Wow! Mac and cheese.
Wow! Bones, this... this looks fantastic.
yeah? Really?
wow, I mean...
...you shouldn't have. I mean, all this work just for me.
what? No, I mean...It's wasn't that much.
this is unbelievable.
you like it? - I'd like to be alone with it.
she said I could go with my instincts, so I put in a little fresh ground nutmeg.
well, she taught you well.
Thanks, Bones.
Yeah, well, you know, we have to eat, right?
aaron, where's Joey?
taking a leak.
buddy system.
come on.
which way did he go?
I don't know. Geez.
Joey's gotta whiz, like, every ten minutes and I...
SAROYAN: Trauma to the forehead.
BOOTH: Eyes full of maggots and all you see is the boo-boo on the forehead.
hands bound in front of him.
definitely not execution style.
what's the, uh, shiny stuff on the nose?
some kind of emollient.
it's around his lips, too.
you get anything out of the boy who found him?
BOOTH: Only thing came out of the kid was vomit.
brennan: That would explain the pervasive smell.
why am I here? SAROYAN: Dead guy.
foul play. It's your main function.
with... bones.
Th???
no, there's a bit of bone here.
and there.
and look at all the maggots.
bones," I said, not "bugs.
lividity looks fixed.
so, it's not a body dump-- he was killed here.
brennan: This is all flesh.
why'd you call me in on this?
is it because you're trying to think of excuses to put Booth and me together on cases?
I wouldn't do that, Dr. Brennan.
cause we worked things out and we're fine. Right?
Yeah. Hundred percent.
that's... That's not why I called you in.
then why?
feet are missing. Because his feet are missing, which suggests bone trauma, which immediately suggested you.
BOOTH: Oh, look at that.
blood.
do you think that's from, uh... the wound on the forehead?
no. Too much.
all right, looks like the blood trail stops here.
you want the honor?
the honor is all yours.
I got a foot...
me, too.
find a third one,
I estimate time of death and at or around four days.
Hodgins took a look at the maggots and agrees.
trauma to the frontal bone would have been fatal.
Yeah, and tissue damage indicates some kind of blade.
so does bone damage.
Dr. Brennan, you aren't being competitive between flesh and bone, are you?
it's possible.
absence of pronounced ecchymosis on the wrists indicates the hands were bound post-mortem.
consistent with the feet.
no hemorrhagic tissue.
they were removed post-mortem.
was that competitive?
no, I'm hearing a tone, but it could be my imagination.
Angela's going to be hypnotized.
Why?
she's going deep into her subconscious to remember her husband's name so we can find him, divorce him, get married ourselves and live happily for all eternity.
you won't live for eternity. I thought you knew his name.A name for what?
Angela's husband. Birimbau.
but our private investigator says it's a nickname.
well, you can't get much off a nickname.
birimbau is, uh, "little flute.Brazilian.
what?
I'm suddenly filled with a sense of well-being.
brennan: The jury is out on the efficacy and validity of recovered memories. BOOTH: That's great.
speaking of names,
I, uh, ran the vic's prints.
I got a hit.
Hodgins: The shiny substance you found on the victim's nose and mouth
it's sunscreen.
per the manufacturer, "it protects and maintains the natural color of coats, manes and tails.
coats, manes and tails. Oh, my god.
formulated for horses.
any human applications?
the manufacturer recommends against use on human skin.
guys, contents of the victim's stomach are corn, raw oats and dried molasses.
horse food? FYI.
there's such a thing as too much fiber.
all right, I can draw inferences from multiple equine implications.
BOOTH: What?
she's going along with the horsey theme. Incised wounds extending into the periosteum of the maxilla, between the molars and premolars.
what?
his teeth and jaw show evidence of a bit.
his name is "Ed.
why is that funny?
as in, "A horse is a horse...
all: Of course, of course.
???
brennan: Mr. Ed?!
orporate retreat in Orlando, Florida.
he's in marketing.
are you able to identify your husband's body from that photograph?
Yes, that's Ed.
I don't understand...
who could've done that.
we found your husband's body just outside Harrisonburg, Virginia.
Virginia?
did he, uh, mention any recent disagreements?
friends, co-workers, family members?
no.
ed was one of "those guys.
when we got married, we owned an apartment building.
if a tenant couldn't afford the rent,
ed would cut him a break.
that's how he was with everyone.
do you have a ranch?
own a racehorse, a pony ride, anything like that?
no. Why?
did Ed ever go to the racetrack?
Rodeos?
I'm not sure Ed even ever saw a real horse up close and in person.
Why?
I don't have anything concrete, right now, but when I do I'll let you know.
Hey!
hay is for horses.
Hey, that's funny, Bones.
I found it on this Web site about horses.
yeah? Where do horses stay in a hotel?
bridle suite.
that's correct.
so, did you find out anything useful?
the hooves of champion thoroughbreds are buried separately from their corpses.
the hooves represent "power
and are given their own resting spot.
our victim's feet were separated from his body.
the victim's wife said he was at a corporate retreat.
and his boss said he took time off to spend with the family.
he lied.
Yeah, they could all be lying.
how did you know the answer to the bridle suite joke?
I have a five year old son.
Hey, have you seen Brennan?
you just missed her.
booth tracked down the victim's last credit card purchase to a country inn in Virginia.
Why? Do you need her?
no, I was sort of hoping that she needed me.
well, I admire your work ethic but she didn't say anything to me.
what about you?
you need anything?
I am weighing human organs.
not really your thing.
right.
okay.
are you passing the time until you're hypnotized?
did Hodgins tell everybody? Oh, he's excited.
we all are.
delving into the subconscious to find the name of the mystery husband?
very romantic.
Yeah, well, it won't be so romantic when I divorce him. Romantic for you and Hodgins when you can finally get married.
you nervous?
no.
no, I'm annoyed.
I know about this hypnotism thing.
I was a magician's assistant at a little gypsy carnival in Brazil.
???
Ugh, Mysteria was really cute and I was younger then and...
the whole being sawed in half thing was actually kind of hot.
we were talking about hypnotism.
right.
well, this guy could rub an alligator's stomach so I could stick my head inside its mouth, but every time he hypnotized people, it was always a scam.
Angela, therapeutic hypnosis is a proven technique.
electroencephalography shows an increase in activity in the the cerebral cortex which opens the subconscious.
Really?
Yeah, it alters the alpha and the theta waves.
read the Stanford University study.
it's not a party trick.
you read that?
and I've been hypnotized myself.
Why?
I was in Vegas.
I got called up on stage, and apparently, I clucked like a chicken in front of 3, 000 people, but I have absolutely no memory of it.
was this little episode in the Stanford study?
no, it should have been.
for the next three days, every time someone said "coffee," I'd cluck.
awkward.
okay, why am I not feeling better about this?
trust me.
no crazier than you drinking kava and marrying a giant in Fiji.
and Hodgins seems to be pretty cool with that, so...
if he wants you to try hypnosis
I'd say get drowsy.
I guess you're right.
I've done crazier stuff than this.
Yeah.
what can happen, right?
there you go.
coffee?
kidding.
it's been two years.
so you say you're with the FBI.
that is the third time he's shown you his I. D.
why would I know this man?
because we have his credit card history and you're part of it.
sir, why are you being so difficult?
not difficult.
discreet.
what do you do? Run a service for cheating husbands?
call in the SWAT team.
theyre anything but discreet.
O-okay, okay, that's Mr. Ed.
a horse is a horse, of course, of course?
that's the general idea, yes.
come with me, please.
the Ambassadora is a place where people come to indulge in pony-play fantasy, 24 hours a day, without fear of judgment.
Mr. Ed is a pony.
is this some kind of sex thing?
how'd you get there so quickly?
the man said "fantasy." I just made the leap.
ed took off a couple of days ago, which was odd, since he pre-paid.
pre-paid for what?
Oh, we're, uh, we're in the middle of what you might call our convention.
so, unless this is really important, ???
well, two miles from here, in the woods,
Mr. Ed was found dead.
???
brennan: It's a fetish.
BOOTH: Uh, so the idea here is that one of them is the horse and the other one is the rider?
basically.
well, this isn't about the horses.
it's about a dominant versus submissive balance of power, a variation on sadomasochism.
those people are eating from troughs.
do you think that's sexy?
fetishism is a way of indulging in sexual activity without actually engaging emotionally with the other person as a fully formed human being.
okay, sex is all about engaging.
you don't want to engage, you just stay home and...
you know.
they have masturbation fetishes, often involving women's shoes or undergarments.
uh, can we just talk to Mr. Ed's mistress, dominatrix, whatever.
I'm going to have to talk to a few people and ask permission to "out" them.
e three lawyers, a half a dozen doctors...
excuse me, we need to speak with Mr. Ed's groom?
whoever... rode him last?
it's a great way to cut to the chase there, Bones, okay?
all right, FBI.
and, sir, could you turn your behind around so it's behind?
my name in the world is Anne Marie Ostenbach.
here, I'm Annie Oakley.
naturally.
so Mr. Ed is dead?
how well did you actually know him?
obviously, she knew him very well.
sexual fetishes are all about role playing.
she probably never knew his real name.
we met online over a year ago.
we were a match-- I mean, compatible in every way.
you have no idea how hard it is to find the perfect pony.
BOOTH: Don't look at me.
Mr. Ed was easy to handle, but he wasn't mindlessly obedient.
okay. And yes, we had sex, if that's your next question.
when did you first meet in person so that you could, you know, um... ride him?
six months ago.
I fell in love with him.
meaning, what, a little light whipping?
when I say "love," I don't mean romantically.
I mean the way a young girl feels about her first pony.
have you ever heard of anything like one pony fighting another?
no. No, pony play is not like that.
Mr. Ed's body was found only a few miles from here.
evidence on the body suggested an equine fetish.
so you understand why we might think that someone from your sex game community killed him?
you should talk to his wife.
his wife? Yes, she showed up here and the next morning, Ed was gone.
Oh, well, he didn't just run off and join a band of wild mustangs now, did he?
I'm speaking to you willingly, without a lawyer present, you could at least pretend to show me some respect.
Yeah, I'll try.
the night Ed took off,
I was in the stables with him.
I'd worked him hard that day and was rubbing him down.
which is when she caught us.
did you know he was married?
I didn't want to marry the man,
I just wanted to play with the pony.
how did he react when he saw his wife?
he never broke character.
what? He remained a pony.
I finished rubbing him down and I went to bed alone.
the next morning at breakfast, he was gone.
I assumed he went back to his wife.
BOOTH: Okay, I'd appreciate if you kept the fact that Ed Milner was murdered to yourself.
BOOTH: What's worse?
okay, finding out that your spouse is having an affair or finding out that he has a secret life as a pony?
pony fetishism has been around since the Greeks.
had to have been the wife, right?
aristotle extolled the joys of being ridden like a horse.
aristotle also thought that the purpose of the human heart was to solve math problems.
I'm surprised you know that.
Oh, it turns out I'm smarter than a fifth grader.
in Victorian England, scantily clad women put on erotic shows dressed as ponies.
just saying, wife sees some woman in a harness rubbing her husband down while he's nibbling on oats?
that's harsh.
in 16th century Turkey, the king kept stables of pony girls and pony boys for his pleasure.
okay, the king of Turkey was a freak.
why are you being so judgmental?
when you turn someone into an obeasure, it's wrong.
how do you know? It says in the Bible.
it does not.
then it got left out by mistake.
we are all hard-wired differently.
if someone needs to shout "giddyup" to heighten arousal, what's wrong with that?
aybe if Ed lived like a man, he wouldn't have died like a horse.
that's all.
brennan: You knew your husband wasn't in Florida.
Yes, I lied. Why?
I was married to Ed for nine years.
we have kids.
my first concern was to make sure thhey didn't find out their father was a pervert.
so his fetish was a surprise to you?
try a complete shock.
why would Ed do that?
we had a good sex life.
more likely, there was a part of your husband that could never have been satisfied by love alone.
bones, that's one of those
we... how did you track him down?
what? Well, I mean, you didn't just, you know, wander into his, uh, his stable, or paddock, or whatever.
no, I really did think he was in Orlando on a business trip.
I got a call. From whom?
a man.
he said Ed was with another woman and told me where I could find them.
he didn't mention the pony stuff.
did you recognize his voice? No.
anything distinctive at all?
an accent.
um, Australian maybe, English.
so, you walked in on Ed and his, um...
rider.
is that what they call it?
what happened next?
I got the hell out of there. I drove home.
did you hear from him again?
no, I engaged a divorce attorney right away, who said all communications should go through her.
did anyone see you come home that night?
why is that important?
I think you know why that's important, Mrs. Milner.
agent Booth, if I had killed my husband, then I wouldn't need a divorce lawyer, would I?
???
????
you don't think she did it, hmm?
no. You want to put that down?
why, because of the whole lawyer?
no, because of the feet cut off thing.
it was ritualistic.
the killer knew about horses.
or maybe she started cutting him into little bits to scatter across the countryside and it was too much workaybe it made her sick.
or he wouldn't fit in the trunk.
booth, we are immersed in a culture here.
pony play is a culture?
anthropologically speaking.
and not just because of the feet.
Ed's hands were tied together.
???
the front two legs of horses to prevent them from straying.
not to mention all the other equine attributes associated with this case.
Yes, this is a culture and we need to investigate accordingly.
do you still think she did it?
no, not now.
we need to find the mystery caller.
if he had a reason to contact Ed's wife, he had a motive to murder him.
right, so, what, back to the Ambassadora?
Giddyup. Yeah, um...
don't, don't say that.
???
of the wound, which suggest the tip of the blade was blunt.
I'm trying to determine the type of weapon.
fill the negative space with microsil, thus determining the approximate shape of the blade's tip.
Yes. Hmm.
you know, this guy got his rocks off pretending to be a horse.
Yes. I've never tried that.
I pretended to be a horse a lot as a child, but there was no sexual component.
what melon is in season?
Why?
once I've I. D.'d a possible murder weapon, we'll want to compare an exemplar to the entry wound.
cantaloupe.
okay, what is this, a sicko rodeo?
stylized movements, posturing as a kind of sexual signal.
who are these people? In real life, they tend to be very orthodox.
you heard what Lucky said, they're lawyers, judges, FBI guys.
Oh, this is not normal.
it's, uh... It's what, Booth?
you're not interested in, uh...?
pony play?
no, but I'm the first to admit that in sexual situations,
I have indulged in role playing.
brennan: And we were wondering if any of the riders or ponies has an accent.
woman: That's good.
you're doing good. LUCKY: He grew up in England.
brennan: With Annie Oakley? Yeah, that's right.
you know, I'm going to need Thor's actual, normal, human name. Calvin Johnson.
Calvin Johnson. That's great, come on.
Thanks.
woman: Come on! Higher!
we all indulge in role playing in sexual situations.
Oh, not me.
completely normal here.
booth, anytime you look at a woman and make the judgment that she's beautiful, you're objectifying her.
and anytime I put on lipstick and nice clothes,
I'm objectifying myself.
it's more subtle than what these people are doing, but otherwise, it's the same dynamic.
you wearing lipstick, Bones, it's not like this.
uh, Calvin Johnson?
he's wearing a bit gag.
could I help you take that off?
no, not until I say so.
well, we either talk to him here or we all go downtown and he misses a whole day of horsing around.
how do you release him from his pony personae?
is it a word or a motion?
Oh, just tap him on the forehead.
so what's up, then?
hardly even knew Ed.
never even spoke to the guy.
Oh, then why'd you call his wife?
well, I'm fairly certain you can't prove that was me.
she recorded the call.
we can do voice analysis.
you know what, and if you lie, we'll charge you with obstruction of justice.
and public display of sexual paraphernalia.
okay, then yes, I called her. So what?
why'd you call her, Calvin?
swap recipes.
brennan: He did it so that he could have Annie Oakley as his groom.
Oh, come on, ratting on a guy to his wife is hardly a federal crime, is it?
how'd you get his home phone number?
it was under "home" on hisone.
ed Milner's an idiot.
was an idiot.
now he's a murder victim.
so what happened there, Thor?
Ed's wife showed up, but to your chagrin, she left without him, so you do what you had to do in order to get your groom back.
Annie's one hell of a jockey, but she's not worth killing for.
I did not kill Mr. Ed.
I may enjoy being dominated by the ladies from time to time, that doesn't make me crazy.
might want to look in a mirror there, my friend Flicka.
whoa, oh, no.
I went to Stanford Law.
clerked for a federal judge.
might want to rethink your actions there, Agent Booth?
thank you.
Yeah, he's got motive.
he knows about horses.
what was with all the lying?
we've got voice tapes and public display of sexual paraphernalia?
it was role playing.
I was being all lard ass and good cop.
hard ass and bad cop, Bones.
hard ass and bad cop.
what's going on?
you first.
cantaloupes.
Zack and I need them for an experiment.
of course you do.
I talked to Dr. Jasper, that hypnotist.
yeah?
she asked me to bring in photos.
but all I could find are these.
I'm not sure those'll going to any help.
So,I was finding the wedding picture?
?you married in the morning at the beach where you did not know?
after I called Dr.Jasper
that somebody snappedsisisisisisisi a Polaroid of me right after I said "I do.
and I stuck it in a book as a bookmark, but I,
I can't find it.
you know, I really hate going through this story of marrying a guy.
I didn't even know his name.
people are looking at me like I'm nuts.
you are.
thanks a lot.
come on, Angie, embrace the irony.
this is yourself.
you married him, then you're going to marry me.
none of it makes any sense.
I'm supposed to take advice from a guy who's walking around with honeydew melons?
Cantaloupes, it's a common mistake, and hey...
you need to relax.
you want me there when you go under?
I can hold your hand or something.
I'm not "going under.
I'm being hypnotized.
okay, this is me walking away with my melons, so you can relax.
I love you.
psycho.
Ta-da! The weapon was blunt, an inch wide and curved.
that's unusual.
not if you're a horse.
I'm not a horse.
but the victim was.
at least he pretended to be one.
what is that?
a hoof knife.
they're curved to conform with the natural shape of a horse's foot.
could I have one of those honeydews?
it's a cantaloupe.
my research shows that ered by a single blow to the forehead. All right now,
I'm thinking that we should place the melons at exactly five-foot-11, which was the victim's height.
now, we should devise a plan to pull the cantaloupe away because he most likely saw the knife coming...
okay, fine.
you know, we used to think things through together.
Oh, I-I apologize.
it's possible that my time in Iraq transformed me into a man of action.
I'll watch out for that.
looks like we found the right weapon.
Mr. Ed wasn't just playing like a horse, and having sex like a horse.
he was slaughtered like one, too.
victim's hands were tied together like this with baler's time.
bales of hay baler's twine? Yup.
it's embedded with a UV protective filament that prolongs the life of the twine in sunlight.
the technology is patented, and they sell directly to the consumer.
they had only 228 sales last year.
booth can get a warrant to identify all the pony players and cross reference.
I'm on it.
is somebody there?
why don't you just open your eyes?
Ah, sweetie.
it'll break the spell.
what spell? Are you still hypnotized?
no.
it never took.
Why?
because that doctor said that I wasn't relaxed enough.
: can you believe that?
I mean, how would she know if I'm relaxed or not?
well, you're twisting your bracelet, your voice is half an octave higher than usual, and you smell like nervous sweats.
Oh, don't say that.
Really?
I'm going back there at 6: 00.
she says that if my pulse rate is still above 60
that she's going to push me off till next week.
rapid pulse rate, high blood pressure
they're indicators of emotional distress.
what, you think I don't want to be hypnotized?
I simply made a factual observation.
you think I'm afraid of disturbing old memories?
you think that somehow
I-I like this idea of Birimbau as some sort of untouchable fantasy figure, hmm?
that somehow finding his real name will just bring him down to earth and make this whole mishegas banal and uninteresting?
I don't know what mishegas means.
I'm not sure I know what any of that meant.
why do I feel like I need to apologize for something?
I'll be ready next time, okay?
you'll see.
could you excuse me... sweetie?
Hey, shut that door behind you?
you recognize that?
Yeah.
that'd be twine.
Yeah.
fairly specialized stuff, hmm?
doesn't deteriorate in the sun.
only the best for your pony clients.
you got it off one of my hay bales?
got it off the corpse of Ed Milner.
do I need a lawyer?
that's your call.
I didn't kill Ed.
we traced the owner of that twine to the Ambassadora Ranch.
any of my guests could have taken this twine off my hay bales.
your company used to be co-owned by your ex-wife till recently?
I paid her off in the divorce.
your ex-wife being Anne Marie Ostenbach?
rider named Annie Oakley?
ed Milner's sex partner.
you can see how things are starting to line up against you here, Lucky?
we aren't married anymore.
you're going to tell me that it doesn't bother you to see your ex-wife playing sex games with other men?
what's that?
it's a warrant.
I already told you, I've got that twine all over the ranch.
we'll be looking for a hoof knife.
I've got a hoof knife.
great. And it was stolen.
four days ago from my truck.
did you report the theft? Come on.
like the cops are going to care about a $10 knife.
think I know who did it, though.
I'm listening.
I have a rider client named Tom Mularz.
couple days ago, he starts passing out fliers advocating the consumption of horse meat, but what do you expect?
he's a butcher.
why did he break into your truck?
well, I took the fliers from him,
I tossed them in the truck, and I kicked him out of the convention.
so, he took back the fliers and that knief.
all I know is, I came out the next morning, the fliers were gone, so was the knife.
that is the same morning that Ed Milner was missing.
you just figured that out.
Oh, I found something very interesting. The victim's feet were severed from the body with remarkable skill.
excellent insight, Zack, but the polite response is, "Really, Hodgins?
what did you find?
there's a sharp force disarticulation from the distal tibia and fibula, passing cleanly above the talus.
no. I wasn't asking you.
I was telling you you should ask me.
really, Hodgins?
what did you find?
the feet were severed with the hoof knife.
I know. Because I told you.
no, because I examined the cuts under the confocal laser-scanning microscope.
how did you find out?
traces of steel left on the skull match traces of steel left on the feet.
same weapon.
same weapon.
you suck all the fun
I hate the smell of a butcher shop.
Oh, maggots and rotting faces and burst guts don't bother you, but the smell of a butcher shop does?
it's a very small step between selling dead meat and making meat dead.
I'm considering becoming a vegetarian.
not me.
Yeah, that's why I said, "I," not, "we.
Zack said that the killer was adept at cutting through bone.
like a butcher. Yeah.
horse Meat
sweet, Rich, Lean and Soft.
can I help you?
Yeah, we're looking to score some horse meat.
there's only two slaughterhouses in the U. S. and they don't export to Virginia.
Oh, that's a shame.
you Tom Mularz?
Why?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
this here... Oh.
go around, cut him off.
stop, or I'll kick you in the testicles.
you are strong.
well, you know, I try to stay in shape.
stop, or I'll kick you in the testicles?
it worked.
I'll tell you what-- you and me, we're going to work on the cop talk.
what didid you hit me with?
a building. You know what?
I've been thinking about the psychology of all this.
all right, you know, I know that you hate that, but just go with me here, okay?
Tom is a butcher.
he advocates the consumption of horse meat.
ed Milner was horse meat.
I can see that. Symbolically.
who's Ed Milner?
Mr. Ed ring a bell?
he's dead?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
he was a good pony.
okay.
did you ride Mr. Ed?
no.
no. I'm a... I'm a rider, but I prefer female horses.
I just...
I just admired his...
his style.
why did you throw me into a wall?
why did you run? Well, you're FBI.
Oh, I need a little bit more than that.
I'm a deserter.
they send the FBI after deserters.
a deserter from what?
the National Guard.
I signed up to save people from floods and earthquakes and stuff, but not to kill them
we found your fingerprints on Lucky's truck.
well, I broke into it to get my fliers back.
they're mine. Your horse meat fliers?
why can't they see that if we revere horses sexually, then eating their flesh is an act of holy communion?
you know what? There's crazy pony players, then there's really whacked out crazy pony players. Yeah.
what did you do after you got your fliers back?
I drove straight to my folks in Jersey.
when did you get there?
before midnight.
they can vouch for me.
and plus, I got credit card receipts from gas.
you deserted the National Guard.
I'm not a killer.
you're a butcher.
well, not a people butcher.
I am not a murder.
MONTENEGRO: How am I doing?
because the pressure of having to have a low pulse could be driving my pulse up, and I in no way want to be penalized for that.
58 beats per minute.
very nice, Angela.
I did some deep breathing.
you're not going to make me cluck like a chicken, are you?
sorry.
bombs away.
let's begin.
close your eyes.
take a deep, cleansing breath in...
and out.
very good.
take in another breath.
and out.
:Focus on your arms.
they're very heavy.
imagine them sinking into your chair.
got your page. What's up?
washed the maggots from the eye sockets, ???
no. Little buggers ate the eyes clean through to the bone.
I have an alternate explanation.
for the eyes missing?
check out the tiny nicks around the supraorbital process, the lacrimal bone, the sphenoid.
you think the killer gouged out the eyeballs?
probably the hoof knife.
the murderer, cutting off the feet, gouging out the eyes.
this was a bloody, violent killing.
killers are often driven by fury.
no, Dr. Brennan.
the feet weren't lopped off.
they were removed carefully.
the eyes were gouged out.
this was done by someone who was not squeamish about flesh.
the butcher's alibi checked out.
booth said some of those pony people were lawyers, judges and doctors.
you think a doctor did this?
someone who is good with a knife and not afraid of blood.
sounds like a doctor to me.
Annie Oakley is a doctor, and she was the victim's groom, but she wasn't the only doctor at the convention.
I found evidence of sperm in Ed Milner's urogenital track.
why is that relevant?
Annie Oakley claims that she rubbed down her pony and then went to sleep.
you think she had one last romp with the decedent?
if she lied about that, what else is she lying about?
Jasper: Very good.
we're ready now to begin the journey.
if you can hear me, Angela, nod your head.
very good.
you're on the island of Vatulolo in Fiji in the village of Nakavala.
MONTENEGRO: I'm pretty sure I'm on the Rialto Bridge in Venice.
Jasper: No. You're on the beach in Fiji.
in front of you is a red door.
MONTENEGRO: No.
there's not.
I need for you not to fight me, Angela.
do you see the door?
MONTENEGRO: I see the door.
Jasper: When you pull the door open, your husband will be standing in front of you.
when you see him, you will greet him by his proper name.
MONTENEGRO: I'm going to pull it open.
Jasper: Pull the knob.
: Angela, I'm going to count to three, and when I reach three, you're going to open up your eyes.
you're going to feel relaxed and refreshed.
you're going to remember everything, but you're not going to be scared.
one, two, three.
did it work? Angela, you need to tell me your husband's name.
I opened the door... and I saw a wasp.
a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?
no, a big, flying, stinging insect.
buzzing around your husband's head?
no, it-- no, it was the size of a, of a human being human being.
I see.
what does that mean to you?
nothing.
it must.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea.
well, you're not what I would call a compliant personality.
this is my fault? Well, perhaps another session, we'll explore this wasp.
Yeah, and next time I'll open the door to what, a giant snake?
I don't think so, Doc.
brennan: You're an eye surgeon, Dr. Ostenbach.
ed Milner's eyes were cut out of his head.
whoa. Don't you have to wait till I call my lawyer?
we have the right to execute the warrant.
you have the right to call your lawyer.
lucky, Sparkles is a litigation lawyer.
Oh, a lawyer named Sparkles.
now I'm, I'm shivering. Look...
...you're making a mistake.
I did not kill Ed Milner.
she actually killed her pony Mr. Ed.
look, I loved Mr. Ed.
but he didn't love you back.
I mean, not enough to leave his wife.
what happened, Annie, did he talk to you before you slapped him on the forehead and you turned him into a human being?
I knew nothing.
well, I'm pretty sure that he told you he was going back to his wife and you convinced him to engage in one last session of pony play.
BOOTH: You took Lucky's truck out to the pasture, you had sex with him, and you... finished him off.
hiding in plain sight.
thanks for making this part easy.
th-that's a hoof knife. So what?
your DNA will be on the handle and Ed Milner's blood on the blade.
Mr. Ed's blood.
your pony misbehaved, so you stabbed him in the forehead.
you cut off his feet, you bound his wrists, but his human eyes were staring back at you, so you gouged them out.
I left my husband for him.
I left Thor for him... and he was going to leave me?
what was I supposed to do?
so... I, uh, I looked up "wasp" in dream theory.
I love dream theory.
I know you do.
and guess what I found:
a wasp signifies anger and envy.
bees are good.
any chance it was a bee?
no, Jack.
a book about nuclear radiation creating a giant wasp.
I was reading it in Fiji.
I mean, between all the snorkeling and the...
sight... seeing.
let's go with that.
what's it mean?
look inside.
that's Birimbau.
his face is turned so there's still not much to go on.
the guy is a giant.
flip the picture.
Angie and Grayson.
his name was Grayson.
when I saw the name
the other informations were came out
you did it, Angie.
you really do want to find him.
I really, really do.
to divorce him?
I want a divorce.
and then I want a wedding.
so what?
there are many health benefits to being vegetarian.
it's a rational choice in a world where food supplies...
are affected by global warming issues.
what about national issues?
is that meat sweet, rich, super lean, and soft?
what? Does it taste like horse meat?
because you mentionedd consider horse meat. you should consider be a vegetarian,
I lost my appetite because you made me think about all those people parading around pretending to be something they aren't just so they could have crappy sex.
how do you know it's crappy?
gotta be, Bones.
come on, it's go why?
Why?
I'll tell you why.
here we are, all of us, basically alone, separate creatures, just circling each other, all searching for that slightest hint of a real connection.
some look in the wrong places, some-- they just give up hope because, in their mind, they're thinking, "Oh, there's nobody out there for me,
but all of us, we keep trying over and over again.
Why?
because every once in a while... every once in a while, two people meet and there's that spark, and yes, Bones, he's handsome and maybe that's all they see at first, but making love...
making love...
that's when two people become one.
it is scientifically impossible for two objects to occupy the same space.
Yeah, but what's important is we try, and when we do it right, we get close.
to what?
breaking the laws of physics?
Yeah, Bones-- a miracle.
those people with their role-playing and their fetishes and their little sex games, it's crappy sex, well, you know, at least compared to the real thing.
you're right.
Yeah, but...
wait a second, I just won that argument?
Yep.
avoid the creepies and the crawlies that live in every dark corner of the maze.
and the first one to reach the center and emerge alive will win the grand prize.
Oh, here we go.
where am I?
somebody help me!
right this way, miss.
now that is an excellent costume.
what are you wearing?
what? Now?
no, not now. To the Jeffersonian halloween ball.
what I always wear. Are you going this year?
I'm the official unofficial fbi liaison to the Jeffersonian.
of course I'm going.
we just passed the wolman.
go straight towards the guillotine and veer left.
it's a maze. What can I do?
Dr. Potoska, how were the remains discovered?
a kid passed out.
what killed him?
the kid didn't die. He just fainted.
then why am I here?
well, when Matty fainted, I was here with my own kids.
I'm a pediatrician, but I'm also the coroner.
small town.
Yeah, well, Matty revived easily enough.
uh, he's what you call a nervous type kid.
but then I saw what it was that made him faint in the first place and I almost fainted, too, because it was a mummy, which I told the sheriff, who called the fbi, who called the Jeffersonian.
and now here we are, lost in this stupid maze looking for the mummy.
a mummy?
Yeah, I do not see a guillotine.
a cowboy?
no, it's a scarecrow.
look, just keep turning to the right, all right?
let me know when you reach the dragon.
uh, dead end...
with teeth.
that's because you turned left at the goblin.
you were supposed to turn right.
look, when you say a mummy, you mean, uh...
wrapped in bandages, curse of king tut. You know, a mummy.
no offense, but I'm not certain a pediatrician is qualified...
pediatrician and coroner. See that? Yeah...
okay, we are at the electric chair.
there's an electric chair?
look, just tell the guy to throw his flashlight up in the air, will ya?
uh, the fbi requests that you toss your flashlight into the air.
Ten-four.
there it is.
Oh, let's see if we can get there this way.
guys.
after you.
what do you think, Bones?
ocular contents dry, leathery skin...
these are actual human remains.
a mummy.
how long will it take to get out of this maze?
not as long as you might think.
takes a steady flow of dry air over a long period of time to achieve this kind of desiccated mummification.
the incan ice woman of peru.
the tarim basin mummies of china.
the peat bog tollund man in denmark.
how old are we talking?
buttons... zipper, rivets...
she's probably wearing jeans.
so, freakozoid murder-mummification rather than fascinating history?
she?
shape of the innominate bone indicates female.
now listen, boys.
the Jeffersonian halloween party-- it's compulsory.
donors, patrons, angels, benefactors.
so we all show up in costume and do our duty.
I don't want any argument or I will be the back end of a cow.
so no costume.
Naomi from paleontology has agreed to be my front.
Ah, so many jokes, so little time.
it's fine. We're all in.
I'll be Edward John Smith for halloween.
ill-fated captain of the titanic.
what about Angela and dr. Brennan?
Dr. Brennan always wears the same costume to these things.
she loves it.
help me remove these.
Ooh, what's with the smell?
cedar oil?
also used in mummification.
what about this clear coating over the skin?
lacquer.
she was painted to death?
the clothing came from a church-run thrift store.
how could you possibly know that?
there is no bug or slime specific to church thrift stores.
you don't know that.
I'm the bug and slime guy.
you're just the auxiliary bone guy who dresses up like the back end of a cow.
free church of america thrift store, huh?
tell booth.
I knew it wasn't bugs or slime.
no you didn't, and that's what makes me king of the lab!
a loyal servant of the empress.
clothes from this ministry were found on a dead body?
well, I'm afraid that happens fairly often.
Why?
because we're a charitable congregation.
homeless people know that we'll provide them with what they need.
do you, by any chance, remember these specific pieces of clothing?
this is from your murder victim?
pastor Jonas?
do you have anything like this in red?
you're looking for something that screams satan, right?
basically.
I think we have a pink cape in the back.
maybe we can dye it.
what kind of church dresses kids like satanists?
let me show you.
at halloween we do a hell house.
fornication, theft, murder, gambling, usury, sodomy, abortion.
it's kind of horrific, isn't it?
well, abandoning the path of righteousness is horrific, dr. Brennan.
this is our way of remaking a pagan holiday
Halloween, into a positive celebration of christian values.
excellent prostitute, stephanie.
anyone ever dress like a mummy?
we've never featured a false idol room, though, now that you mention it, it's not a bad idea.
ancient egyptian religious beliefs endured for almost 4, 000 years.
twice the length of christianity.
look, any of your kids suddenly disappear?
no.
what if the children that you save from abortion grow up to be usurers and sodomites?
I don't respond to mocking semantics, dr. Brennan.
nor do I, but she's serious.
in that case, my serious answer would be that in being given a chance to live a life, the aborted soul will have a multitude of opportunities to repent for their sins and live bathed in the holy spirit.
thank you. - Thank you?
you're welcome.
my name is Amber Kippler.
I'm a senior investigator with Doyley private investigations.
Mr. Doyley assured me he'd be taking a personal interest in the search for ms. Montenegro's husband.
interest, yes.
but I'll be doing the actual footwork.
Mr. Doyley is taking a very personal interest.
only not from up close.
do you have a lot of experience at this kind of work?
angela Montenegro is not your birth name.
you changed your name on your 18th birthday becaus came to you in a dream.
you never told me that.
I never told anybody that.
if I can discover something nobody knew about a client,
I'm not being paid to investigate, imagine what I can do for real.
good point.
I never told anybody about that.
Yes, you did, actually.
a girl named Roxie whose heart you broke in second year art school.
what do you know about me?
wouldn't it be better if we got to ms. Montenegro's husband, grayson birimbau barasa?
you found something?
I found the actual human man.
in florida. In the keys.
no name key. Very remote.
did you talk to him?
absolutely not. - Why?
my instructions were to locate.
that being achieved, we can now discuss contact.
we want you to contact him.
him to sign the divorce papers.
by get him do you mean...
force him to sign them? - If necessary.
do you have a gun?
or just remind him of who I am and ask him politely.
what are you? Canadian?
we'll do this one step at a time.
didn't that pastor guy make you mad? - No.
he's a fundamentalist.
I appreciate consistency.
Oh, the consistency of trying to scare kids into christianity?
how do we keep kids from smoking?
we tell them it gives them cancer.
it does give them cancer.
according to science.
you know, that's all you care about is science.
in the end, even someone who believes in empiricism and science has to take a leap of faith.
what?
I believe in what I can hear, taste, see, touch and measure.
you believe in what you feel.
pastor Jonas believes that god speaks to him through a sacred book.
I feel like we're on the wrong side of the argument here.
it's cam. What's up?
I really need you to come back.
what's going on?
I got a couple here, says they think the mummy in the maze is their daughter.
Oh, that'd save us some time on identification.
their daughter only disappeared last week.
the remains we found were at least a year old.
look, I'm great with corpses, but when it comes to loved ones...
let's just say there's a reason why I'm not a pediatrician.
so if you got a siren, turn it on.
right.
Megan is 14.
she didn't run away.
something terrible happened.
she's a very pretty girl.
what makes you think the remains we found are your daughter?
the news said that you found the body of a teenage girl in a fun house.
I suddenly knew it was Megan.
suddenly knew?
Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, it wasn't a fun house.
it was a maze.
and the remains we found are more than a year old.
you're certain? - Yes.
I see.
I'm sorruse me.
I don't understand why you're disappointed.
your daughter might still be alive.
Megan is not still alive.
I just I can't explain it.
I'm her mother.
I'm sorry. Does this face mean anything to you? - No.
does she have something to do with Megan?
this is the girl that we found in the maze.
definitely not Megan.
yes?
great
what clown?
you? - Yeah - You - Sure
come on
what's wrong?
the phone rang.
it's cam on the phone. It's ringing.
coulrophobia.
the fear of clowns. Coulrophobia.
it may explain why you shot that clown last year.
look, I have no problems with clowns.
I can stand right here. See?
and the phone. Booth.
we got an id on our maze victim off of Angela's sketch.
great. Uh, details to follow?
I think you want to hear this now.
name's stella higgins, 15 years old.
disappeared a year ago today.
what's she saying?
ID and date of disappearance of our maze victim.
booth, stella was last seen at shoreline amusement park.
what wow?
more coincidences. thanks.
the maze victim disappeared from here.
so we just go right past the clown.
I can walk right past the clown, like she said.
just right...
torture dungeon.
Yeah. Okay.
clowns, scary. Not you.
Oh, gee. You're kidding me, right?
Oh, look at the eye, huh? It's a ping-pong ball.
not this one.
how do you know?
human remains, booth.
it's sort of my specialty.
this is a dead person.
the first thing booth needs to know is if this is Megan Shaw.
it is not Megan Shaw.
I agree.
it would be impossible to mummify a body like this in just a little more than a week.
dental records do not match.
lacquer and cedar oil.
looks like the same murderer.
that's leaping to a conclusion.
I said looks like, Zack.
looks like is not leaping.
her phalanges-- fingers-- are damaged.
metacarpals are... cracked.
you've seen something like this before?
in iraq, there were some remains...
they had been buried alive.
this person was buried alive?
I'm not comfortable...
it looks like this person was buried alive. Correct?
Thtattoo on the second victim's shoulder matches that of judith suzanne evans...
16 when she went missing.
how long ago?
two years, almost to the day. - From?
shoreline amusement park.
she was there with her big sister and a couple of her friends.
skin and hair removed from beneath stella's fingernails turns out to be her own.
also, the lacquer used on both victims is completely generic.
it's widely available.
she pulled out her own hair?
what makes somebody do that?
there are small puncture marks, hundreds of them, all over her body.
like insect bites, but larger.
in both cases, the lacquer was infused with a number of particulates including a spore i'm trying to identify.
are you ready to admit that it looks like both these girls were killed and mummified by the same person?
I'm not prepared to...
jump to that conclusion.
come on. You expect me to know when one body appeared in a pile of bodies?
that's not reasonable.
an actual, genuine corpse appears, and you don't notice?
the place is called dungeon of a 1, 000 corpses.
which is exactly why an entire fbi forensics team is sweeping this facility.
facility?
this hole counts as a facility?
I know you.
no. - Yeah.
you were at the maze the other night. Same costume.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. You're just recalling that, huh?
what's your name? - Gregg.
little hint.
FBI asks for your name, you give the whole name.
his name's Gregg Liscombe.
he's worked here three years.
you're not supposed to wear the costume to other gigs, dude.
dilutes the effect.
all the other bodies are fakes, agent booth.
okay. We'll just keep the entire fun house as a crime scene.
Yes, sir.
in that case, can I send my people home?
Oh, no. All your people have got to talk to my people.
and you're coming with me.
Why?
two places with dead bodies, and you're standing in the doorway dressed as the grim reaper.
it's my job, man.
it's not like I adopt the persona.
don't say anything without a lawyer, Gregg.
tell you what else, Gregg's got the keys to the place.
shut up, Dan! He's got keys, too.
and so does cleaning crew. And park security.
how about you? You got keys?
I've got nothing else to say withou okay, that's great, pincushion, 'cause you were practically invisible until now.
now you're bucking as number one suspect.
Judith Evans, age 16, our victim from the dungeon of 1, 000 corpses.
I've identified stress fractures to both tibias, as well as tears to the medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments in both knees.
catcher's knee.
there's nothing in the bio about Judith Evans being a baseball player.
compressions to vertebrae c1 through c7 indicate that her neck was bent like this.
but forced.
I am not liking the picture that's forming inside my head.
phalanges cracked, and her fingernails shredded, her head forced that way, her knees jammed up against her chest.
do we think Judith Evans was buried alive?
I, uh, I have... another bad image of how stella higgins died.
spiders. - Spiders?
tarantulas, to be specific.
poisonous spiders?
that's a common misconception, though the lack of poison doesn't make the bite any less painful.
this is an urticating hair from the theraphosinae family.
it appears to be barbed.
Yeah. It's very irritating.
Hey, little-known fact:
tarantula hair was the main ingredient in itching powder for decades.
is there any correlation between these hairs and the fact that stella higgins scratched herself so badly, and pulled out her own hair?
she's bitten all over.
there had to be dozens of tarantulas on her so, yeah, there's a correlation.
I was operating under the assumption that the mysterious spore was transported by the tarantula, but I was wrong.
how do you know?
because there's no tarantula hairs on Judith Evans, but plenty of the spores and particulates.
she has carcinogenic dibenzopyrene isomers, asbestos, po manganese and barium.
and steel dust.
which adds up to...
internal combustion engines.
traffic. Except for the steel dust.
I have no clue about the steel dust.
well, stella's tox results show chloroform, ephedrine, theophylline, clonydine and methamphetamine.
Judith's remains show trace evidences of the same compounds, but in different concentrations.
ephedrine is synthetic adrenaline.
most of those are heavy stimulants.
their metabolisms would race.
heart rates would accelerate dangerously.
spiders.
live burial. Drug-induced panic...
is our murderer literally scaring girls to death?
I always felt, somehow, that Judy was still alive, even after two years.
it's crazy, huh?
probably guilt, right?
for letting my little sister out of my sight?
look, you can't blame yourself.
did my sister suffer?
you know, we got the best people in the world figuring out exactly what happened that night.
so...
you and your sister went to the amusement park together?
its kind of the thing to do on halloween.
my mom made me take her.
I didn't want to.
I mean, I loved Judy...
but she was your kid sister-- pain in the ass.
she made me take Judy, even though I didn't want to, and mom never got over that.
how did you and Judy get separated?
Judy got scared.
she didn't want to go in the fun house.
Why?
there was this huge monster above the door.
Judy freaked.
she said go ahead, she'd wait outside.
Judy was claustrophobic.
how bad?
pretty bad.
she wigged out when we were driving down.
there were six of us jammed in a car.
we had to stop and let her out a couple times.
do you remember if there was a grim reaper that night at the entrance?
Yeah, there was.
could that be him?
Yeah.
when we came out looking for Judy, he told us she had taken off with some guy.
the police could never confirm that.
registered sex offender.
he was present at two places where the remains of young girls were found.
coincidence.
statistically improbable.
scientifically improbable but, in the real world, impossible.
do you recognize these two girls?
man, every girl that comes in there talks to me.
I don't remember them.
why does every girl talk to you?
cause I'm cute, scary.
Yeah, you do pretty well with the teenage girls, don't you, Gregory?
you get them all tingly?
all right, that sex offender thing? It's a joke, man.
look it up.
I got drunk, and I took a leak in a public fountain.
Yeah. We did look it up.
there was a group of schoolgirls on the other side of that fountain.
four times, you've been caught with your pants down, all around teenage girls.
coincidence?
two years ago, you told this girl's sister that she took off with some guy.
do you remember her?
Yeah, sure.
it's the girl that disappeared.
the thing about you guys-- you're all the same. You sniff each other out.
who was the guy?
Judith Evans disappeared october 24, two years ago.
Stella higgins, one year ago, a week before halloween.
so?
so, Megan Shaw vanished from the same place.
you can see the common element here, can't you, Gregg?
you. - Coincidence.
there are no coincidences in a murder investigation.
well, it's got nothing to do with me.
geez, you can'T... did you see that?
Hey! Megan Shaw was 14 years old.
understand me? Who was the guy?
good shot, Bones. - Thanks.
there was no guy!
it was Lola. - Lola?
the girl with the piercings? - Yeah.
what the hell were you doing with her?
it's not what you think.
the girls come with me, maybe we get it on a little... Lola likes that.
your girlfriend likes to see you with little girls?
she likes to interrupt.
you know, maybe smack them around a little.
smack around? - Yeah.
it gets Lola hot. For us. For later.
sometimes, maybe she goes a little too far.
how did you get to and from a remote, nameless florida key so fast?
it does have a name.
its name is no name key.
your confusion is natural.
uh, did you talk to my husband?
Mr. Barasa was very pleasant.
very pleasant.
I mean, wow!
he smelled exactly like a fresh wind just after a summer storm.
you smelled him?
part of the private investigator credo, dr. Hodgins:
insure that the client-- that's you
and him.
I'm paying.
the credo says make sure the client is committed to their objective at each step.
ergo, fresh wind after summer storm reminder.
despite the storm, I want a divorce.
in that case, the news is disappointing.
Mr. Barasa was nice, but adamant-- no divorce.
was it because he doesn't remember getting married?
Mr. Barasa totally remembers everything.
he built this for you-- a house.
a shack!
a whimsical cottage.
it's darling.
he built a house for me?
okay, let's be honest.
it's a shanty.
here's what Mr. Barasa said 100% verbatim, word for word.
verbatim means word for word. - What?
you sort of said it twice.
I quote literally to the letter:
ever has it been that love does not know its own depth until the pain of separation?
the guy writes poetry.
please.
he was talking about you, Ms. Montenegro, with tears in his eyes.
he should get a grip.
what would you like me to do next?
what are you gonna do here, ang?
this guy built you a house, he cried a little bit.
he smelled like a fresh wind after a summer storm, and you can practically see the lights of havana from the porch of that cottage.
I want a divorce.
if I'm gonna shack up with anybody, it's this guy.
we're gonna discuss this between ourselves, miss Kippler.
I'll let you know how we want to proceed.
okay.
did I mention he's the most beautiful man I've ever seen?
don't blame me.
P. I.Code: Keep it real.
that girl Lola gets off on inflicting pain.
were you gonna hit her, too?
no, not with a closed fist.
Why? - Why? That leaves a mark.
agent booth. - Yeah?
spoke with the Shaws.
asked if their daughter had any specific phobias.
yeah?
snakes. - Snakes.
one crawled up out of the drain of her bathtub when she was a child.
so since then... - okay, that's good.
just call all the pet shops, the reptile specialists
I don't know, the world of snakes
and see who's been buying 'em all up.
does Lola strike you as a snake person?
look, I'll deal with Lola.
you go back to the lab.
Why?
I won't hit her unless you say so.
look, I'll do my street thing, you do your lab thing, all right?
together, we catch bad guys.
that's good math.
the lacquer holds tarantula hairs, your mystery spores and particulates which suggest heavy traffic.
I'm aware of the parameters.
I told you all that stuff.
I'm thinking aloud.
it's a technique.
are you concentrating on the spores?
Yes, I'm looking at them now.
he's aware of the parameters.
and the unexplained source of the steel dust?
what I'd like is to look up from this microscope in about, mm, ten seconds and find myself totally alone and able to concentrate.
Oh, not nearly far enough.
not even close.
is that your costume?
uh, yeah.
it's sexually alluring.
thank you.
I'm catwoman.
the superhero.
one of the most powerful female superhero figures.
I don't think so.
are you kidding catwoman?
can you fly?
I have nine lives.
super strength, super speed, force people to tell the truth?
I think I'm pretty fast.
pretty fast is not super speed.
Hawaii.
Hawaii?
the spore is atronecium from the Haleahi Nebulae.
it's a hawaiian orchid hybrid.
the victims were mummified in hawaii?
how else would hawaiian pollen get absorbed into the wet lacquer?
remember me?
not one word passes through these lips without a lawyer's okay.
right, and if you can't afford one
which is my guess-- one will be provided.
probably a crappy one who studied law on the internet.
what do you want?
you attacked both of those two dead girls.
did Gregg tell you that?
Yeah, and this one, too.
I didn't kill anyone.
that's right.
it was Gregg who forced you to do that.
you know what, and if you don't tell me what I need to know in two seconds,
I'm gonna start removing your piercings and I'm not gonna start with the ones on your face.
look, I roughed 'em up, all right?
that's it!
I was gone. I was out of there, man!
why do you think i'm never charged?
Yeah, okay. - I'm gone, man!
just remember, maryland and virginia both have the death penalties.
keep that in mind before we find Megan's body. Let's go.
these are really tight, man!
don't you have to put on your costume?
I already did.
I got a profile of the killer from sweets.
you mean Dr. Sweets.
well, it's only theory, Bones.
I mean, it's what he's best at.
I mean, he's only 12.
sweets says the killer is definitely a male.
gregg is a male.
no, Gregg and Lola work their sick little thing together.
sweets says that the killer works alone and has a respectable blue-collar job.
in his public life, he's into saving people, he's unmarried.
Oh, he has a police or military background.
you do realize that sweets is describing you, right?
how do I look?
good.
Wonder-ful.
get it? - Yeah.
cause you're wonder woman. - I know.
what are you supposed to be?
Oh, I'm a nerd squint.
you, what is the rationale behind that conclusion?
that's not what they look or sound like.
you mean we.
that's not what we look or sound like.
okay.
you see what i did right there?
I corrected you, you know, in character as a squint.
angela and Hodgins have a few things to show us before we go to the party.
what?
what?
this marks the location of shoreline amusement park.
these are the locations of three pet shops the fbi says sold out of snakes in the last week.
how many snakes in total?
over a hundred.
let me guess.
they all paid cash - yep.
and the last place sold out about an hour ago.
an hour ago?
booth, Megan Shaw is still alive.
wait a second. Both Gregg Liscombe and Lola are in custody.
sweets was right.
they didn't do it.
Hodgins has been isolating locations where the dead girls could have been exposed to the metal particulates he found in the lacquer.
okay, how many?
126, not including hawaii.
126, that's not good enough.
Megan Shaw's still alive.
what do you want me to do?
he wants us to guess.
well, my guess is hawaii.
not hawaii.
well guess again, but better.
no, sorry.
booth, they don't guess.
who's they?
them. - Them.
well, that's just stupid.
we do not guess.
you know what? You're a horse's ass.
cow. I'm a cow.
see my udder.
I need Zack and Hodgins.
the rest of you can go to the party.
how can we go to a party when a 14-year-old girl's being tortured to death by snakes?
people like us can't work at full capacity with people like you constantly interrupting with irrelevancies.
it's true.
I love you, but it's true.
okay, we're out of here.
let's go, Cher.
okay, we'll just sit right over here in this chair and I'llt.
booth, no!
fine.
I'll wait outside, okay?
with this chair.
I'll be outside with this chair.
I'm worried that naomi from paleontology will feel strange being only the front half of a cow.
she got the good end of that deal.
who's stronger, catwoman or wonder woman?
wonder woman. - Wonder woman.
I concur vehemently.
all right, now, ignoring the hawaiian pollen, these 126 sites represent loci where the necessary concentrations of particulates can be found:
underground garages, tunnels, etc.
Dr. Sweets says we can assume that the murderer works for a living.
you want us to go on psychology?
let's assume the killer has to get back and forth from his...
in comic books, it's always called a lair.
from his lair in time for his job, sometimes during high-traffic hours.
can you remove the sites which make that improbable?
assuming he needs to sleep.
say, six hours a night.
12-hour shift.
leaving six hours for travel and torture.
at a maximum of two hours travel time.
so, what, remove everything more than a hundred miles away?
too simplistic.
if it's on a highway, it could be up to 120 miles away.
secondary roads, taking traffic patterns i depending on the time of day and weather conditions.
it'll go faster if you do the calculations in your head, Zack, and don't explain it to us.
thank you.
how many does that leave?
no. No way the police can hit all those.
not spread thin on halloween.
we can narrow it down further.
factor: Mummification.
Yes, particulates plus mummification requires...
a steady, continuous supply of dry air.
a large oven with blowers.
I'd like to assume that the automotive particulates arrived with the blowing air.
heated underground parking lots.
how is that not guessing?
einstein referred to such assumptions as acceptable intuitive leaps.
I acknowledge einstein as a scientific authority.
but he failed us this time.
the answer is in the anomalies.
the hawaiian spore.
and steel dust.
what makes it?
grinding, drilling, abrading.
raping, milling.
train wheels.
okay, intuitive leap.
when a train turns, it grinds the rails, creates steel dust.
Subways...
which also provide warm, dry air.
they're vented.
what we need now are florists who carry Hodgins' hawaiian flower which are situated directly over subway tracks.
Hey, where you going?
to get booth.
call me when you find the florist.
you're sure about this?
not at all.
because you guessed.
but we do not guess.
I think you did.
I dare you to put that lasso of truth around you.
now you're being completely irrational.
this lasso doesn't actually work.
these bracelets aren't actually made of amazonium.
they're stainless steel.
they can't stop a bullet.
okay.
aloha floral supply between friend ephedrine the store thank you dispatch units please repeat and a wonder woman and a wonder woman it's closed back dry air subway stay back okay, look could this other...other drugs.
I know who the murderer is.
who?
let's get out of here.
eats up the girls, leaves them bleeding.
who shows up to help?
access to drugs.
the emt.
smart.
you should wear a lab coat at all times.
puts them in the back of his ambulance, he knocks them unconscious.
just stay there.
screams are coming from inside.
can I shoot it? - No!
Geez! You shot me! - Sorry! Sorry, booth!
damn it! I said no! Don't shoot! No! - Are you all right?
I think the bullet bounced off my bracelet.
just like amazonium.
geez, Bones.
what are you doing?
they're not poisonous.
I know.
I know.
then why don't you come down?
it seems I'm not completely in control of my actions.
just get on my back.
God. Bones.
it's okay.
can you understand me?
my head.
just stop shooting at things, Bones.
he had a gun. - You stay here.
anyone comes through that door, you shoot their heads off.
except me.
my gun is too big for me.
I could've told you that a hundred times.
here, take mine.
guard Megan.
come on, Megan.
come here.
it's okay.
damn it.
how could a guy with military training miss with a scattergun?
what were you, navy?
infantry.
which is how I know you're carrying the 50-caliber 500.
well, that's five shots.
and by my count...
you only got one shot left.
that's one dumbass gun to bring to a shootout!
Where's your backup, booth?
shouldn't they be here by now?
you need to be quiet.
can you do that, Megan?
bones, you all right?
we're okay. We're okay.
he's using you to get to us.
not for long, booth.
I'm just gonna stick my scattergun in there and empty the barrels.
your girl is gonna look like hamburger.
one shot.
one hell of a now can you see why I hate clowns?
ms. Kippler.
ms. Montenegro, you look amazing.
Halloween, right?
look, Hodgins and i haven't really decided what we're gonna do next.
I tried to seduce him, you know.
no. Your husband.
I took off my top and everything.
Why?
I've been told i have alabaster skin that's really impossible to resist touching.
isn't that some kind of conflict of interest?
the pi code?
it totally for you, the client.
I was testing Your husband with my wiles so that I could properly advise you.
you are a very dedicated investigator.
which is why I have to tell you something i didn't want to say in front of dr. Hodgkins.
Hodgins. There's no K.
your husband is deeply, deeply in love with you.
also, he has incredible abs and forearms.
so what I'm suggesting is that I take you down there, mediate a meeting, and see if any old sparks don't flare back into life.
I'm in love with Hodgins.
now.
forever, ms. Kippler.
did I mention the little catch in his throat when he said your name?
look, all I want out of him is a divorce, okay?
so if you want to see him again and you want to rub your alabaster all over him and shake his snow globe, be my guest.
all I want is the divorce.
I hear you.
I believe you.
I just wanted to make sure.
and please don't ever say ew about hodgin beards. I don'T...like beards.
especially in conjunction with huge, blue eyes.
makes me feel like i'm staring into one of those russian religious icons.
Dr. Hodgkins.
were you just talking to Angela?
Yes.
I was telling her that her husband is extremely physically attractive.
okay.
enough with that now.
quit trying to drive a wedge.
it's a fact.
on a scale of one to ten, he's ten to the tenth power.
what am I?
you're a solid 7. 5 Which is quite respectable.
your job is to help me and Angela to be together.
Dr. Hodgkins, domestic issues make up the core of our business.
and I have to tell you, most of the time they go back.
they go back?
they g husbands or their wives most of the time.
it's a fact.
and you think Angela should go back to her husband?
I don't have an opinion about should or should not.
I'm more interested in will or won'T.
but in this case, in my opinion...
I don't think she's going back to her husband.
even after you practically threw him at her?
exactly.
aren't you glad I did?
now you can sleep like a baby because of my thorough approach.
thank you.
that's right, thank you.
where is everybody?
at the party, I guess.
we could still go.
Ah, we look like hell.
it's a halloween party.
we could be wonder woman and, um...
what's superman's secret identity?
Yes.
we could be wonder woman and Clark Kent after a really, really bad date.
Yeah, bad date because you shot me.
it was only a flesh wound.
and you dropped me on my head.
after you shot me.
okay, I think i got you on this one.
okay, wonder woman?
I'm sorry you had to kill someone.
I know you hate that.
Yeah, he had it coming.
you hate it.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
we saved the girl.
that's a pretty good date.
except not really a date. - I know.
it was work.
not a date.
really, really hard one.
and we're not really wonder woman and Clark Kent.
we're Brennan and booth.
look, you're the one who brought up the date analogy.
you hungry? - yeah
me, too.
okay, let's go grab a bite to eat.
what the hell are you doing?
nothing.
smokes out of the vents into the first four break rooms.
you're sure you turned the flame down last night?
totally, 100% guaranteed, positively sure.
alarm's gone off before, but the smoke was always gray.
one time, a possum got stuck in the shaft.
smoke came out like this.
Dr. Addy was conducting an experiment on a pig yesterday.
I told all them eggheads not to toss dead animals down the incinerator shaft.
since when do they listen to us?
holy crap!
definitely not pork.
at 400 degrees, bone chars in six hours, and turns to ash in eight.
charring, no ash.
six to eight hours?
dumped into the incinerator between 1: 00 and 3: 00 a. m.
Oh. Alive or dead before he or she went into the incinerator?
what's that? Guest log.
no visitors checked out after 9: 36 last night, no one checked in before 8: 02 this morning.
meaning the victim probably works here.
meaning the killer does, too.
pubic bone is female.
there's no carbon in the trachea.
she was dead before she was thrown down the chute.
extensive fissures, fractures and breaks to the entire skeleton.
I'll have Zack determine which were caused by heat and which by trauma.
they called Bancroft in from a hearing on the Hill.
who's Bancroft again?
God.
the Supreme Honcho of the Jeffersonian.
I think I met him once.
okay, I am ready to start the facial reconstruction.
I haven't put on tissue depth markers yet.
I haven't finished removing all the carbonized brain matter.
once you've done that,
Zack can clean the skull.
yeah?
are you all right?
what's wrong?
um...
um... I'm fine.
I'll start after the tissue markers are...
let me know.
what the hell was that about?
you won't like it.
like what?
I identified the victim.
that's impossible.
I told you you wouldn't like it.
there are no tissue markers.
you can't just look at a skull and see the person.
sweetie, I've done hundreds of these reconstructions.
the depressed glabella, the narrow nasal aperture, the chipped lateral incisor.
you can see a face from that?
when she was 16...
the chipped tooth was from a skiing accident...
Ange, you know the victim personally?
Kristen Reardon.
she's an intern.
we had coffee a couple of times.
she didn't want to be a scientist.
she wanted to go into design.
she was just here to make her father happy.
she was young and eager and keen and...
she was just really, really young.
wait. Reardon?
as in Dr. Ted Reardon?
Yeah. He used to work cre. e I took aoursfrom him in Ancient Pharmacology.
look, I know that we can't say anything until you do the tissue markers and we go through channels, but I'm telling you, I know that this is Kristen.
poor Ted.
you want to know something else?
she was seeing somebody who worked here.
is that relevant?
well, Booth will think so.
especially since it was a married man.
did she tell you who?
no. Just that they had their first kiss at the opening of that Egyptian exhibit, and that it had been hot and heavy ever since.
I'm sorry, Ange.
no, I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm just really freaked out by this one.
because you know the victim.
well, and the killer.
I mean, look around.
do you like thinking that somebody we see every day could have thrown Kristen into the incinerator?
how can I aid your investigation?
well, Dr. Bancroft,
I'd like printouts from the Jeffersonian Security detailing who was and was not in the building.
done. I'd also appreciate it if you would tell your people to cooperate with the FBI.
Yes. Of course, Agent Booth.
I don't know if you've had much cause to work with scientists.
difficult people by nature.
combative, skeptical, resistant.
I've noticed.
have you identified the victim yet?
unofficially, an intern by the name of Kristen Reardon.
no relation to Ted Reardon?
his daughter.
Dr. Reardon left the Jeffersonian for Georgetown University?
in the interests of full disclosure,
I was instrumental in that move.
you fired him.
I facilitated a necessary change.
necessary change? Excellent scientist, poor administrator-- does Reardon know about his daughter?
Dr. Brennan is informing him now.
I'd like to be kept in the loop on this.
within the constraints of the law, of course.
sure.
Ted Reardon? Victim's father?
Yep. Bones is telling him his daughter's dead.
rumor has it Bancroft banished Reardon from the Jeffersonian cause he felt threatened politically.
I know. Let's leave Bones to it.
would it be insensitive to mention that my father's 60th birthday is coming up?
60 already? Wow!
Uh-huh. We're having a big birthday dinner for him on Thursday night.
you give him my best.
do it yourself. You have to come with me.
what? No. Not your family.
I can't spend the night defending the fact that I still live alone to my family.
you never told them we broke up?
you want me to say it on his 60th birthday?
you want me to pretend that I'm your boyfriend?
Yes. Between 6: 30 and 10: 00 on Thursday.
Camille, you're an adult.
you can't live your life afraid of what your family thinks.
Seeley, it's not going to be like this forever.
one day, he'll die.
tough going in there?
I've never had to tell someone his child is dead.
I mean, I've been there when you did it, but to actually...
it's extremely unpleasant.
Yeah.
listen, did you get a chance to, uh, ask him about his daughter's love life?
Yes. He said, as far as he knew, she wasn't seeing anyone.
Kristen was lying to her father.
Dr. Brennan, is it true?
Kristen Reardon is dead?
Evan, Special Agent Booth.
he's in charge of the murder investigation.
Dr. Evan Klimkew-- Kristen Reardon's supervisor.
murder? Kristen was murdered?
what did Kristen Reardon do?
Authentications.
other museums and high-end collectors, use us to authenticate their acquisitions.
that a big department? Three to five interns, all doctoral candidates, my assistant and myself. That's it.
it's a competitive environment, right?
of course. You put a bunch of neurotic, type-A overachievers together, and you dangle a prize over their heads...
Dr. Klimkew is referring to the Bates Fellowship.
the top intern receives $75, 000
and a gold star on their resume.
Kristen was the front-runner.
I had heard that her heart wasn't in it.
didn't show in her work.
God, this is terrible.
does her father know?
who was her main rival for the Bates money? That would be Neil Tyler.
Neil Tyler. Where can I find him?
we're authenticating the artifacts in your serial killer vault.
so what does your wife think of these, you know, these late hours?
I'm separated.
that's your answer.
are you seeing anyone now?
are you serious?
it's a murder investigation, Evan.
no. I'm not seeing anyone.
thank you, Dr. Klimkew.
this spinner appears to be Masonic in origin
bloodstone, gold
but what's interesting is, in the center, instead of the traditional "G" for God, there's a skull.
Gormogon iconography.
we've been seeing a lot of that in here.
Gormogon? Okay, what's that?
it's an 18th century... It's an extinct group dedicated to eradicating the influence of the Freemasons and Illuminati in Europe in the 18th century.
that could be the largest collection of Gormogon artifacts in the world.
that's great. You and Kristen Reardon were here last night?
that's right. Kristen worked there.
I signed out around midnight.
Kristen stayed longer, like always.
okay. A little resentful there?
I worked my way through state college.
I've got a second job, which is why I had to leave early.
Kristen went to an LVY League school, and Dad's got connections.
who do you think needed the Bates Fellowship more?
Oh, the way I hear it, you're next in line for a big payday, pal.
I liked Kristen, and she liked me.
check the logs. I wasn't here.
do you know who Kristen was seeing?
you mean like romantically? No.
only that it was an older guy, and she said I was going to be really surprised when I found out who it was.
how about you? You married?
I'm gay, Agent Booth.
excuse me.
what do you got?
Kristen Reardon's bag.
Ah, cell phone...
logs.
the bag tells us that Kristen wasn't leaving the museum when she met with her killer.
look at that. A lot of calls to the same number.
booth... Let's hope it's our cheating husband.
...Kristen was authenticating artifacts from the Gormogon Vault.
let's not go there.
if Gormogon killed her, then Gormogon is one of us
somebody who works at the Jeffersonian.
you went there.
what?
you went there and you gave him a nickname.
that just happened, right?
you saw that?
who is it? Is he dead?
Yes, but only because he was never alive.
you got to be kidding me.
look at this.
the Gestapo's interfering with free inquiry.
guys, just let 'em go.
and if they try to escape, shoot 'em.
what's with the dummy, dummies?
not a dummy. It's an ersatz skeleton made from glass and reinforced nylon, which breaks exactly like human bone.
we threw it from the top floor.
explicate your process, please.
using bone density tables, we duplicated Kristen's exact height and weight.
for God's sake, why?
to prove that Kristen Reardon was dead before her skull fractured from falling down the incinerator chute.
we already know that.
we re-created her bone density and found that her skull would not have fractured in the way it did from a fall less than 25 meters.
Oh.
Oh," what? English, please.
that tells us the body was put in the trash chute on the top floor of our building.
the office suites. It's always the suits, baby.
Hey, I work suits.
Yes, yes, you do.
all right, that's it.
no shooting of the squints tonight. Sorry.
all right, good work.
let's go, Bones.
Kristen Reardon was stabbed to death.
aorta and left lung both punctured.
whoa. She bleed a lot?
through the wound, through her mouth.
copious amounts.
booth, everyone's coming around to the opinion that Kristen Reardon's death had something to do with the Gormogon Vault.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
see, we got-we got to squelch that one 'cause that will totally shift the focus of this investigation.
you might have noticed, but these people are tough to squelch.
you know what? They're always telling us not to jump to conclusions.
but when they do, it's called a "quantum leap.
jump, leap, tomato, "tomato,
what's the difference?
look, um, does the name Aldridge mean anything to you?
rings a bell, yeah. Why?
cause there was no blood near the incinerator chute on the top floor.
the body could have been wrapped in plastic or transported in a tub.
there's a Dr. Kyle ldrie, heads up the Middle East department. Why?
hmm, do they have offices in this building?
middle East department is in Building S, but it joins up to this building by a skyway. Why?
what floor does the skyway connect with?
top floor. And I'm gonna ask why again, and this time you're gonna tell me.
this guy Aldridge's number's all over Kristen's cell phone.
just hold on.
Yeah, it's Booth.
check out all the offices in the adjoining building on the top floor.
start with a Dr. K. Aldridge.
cam, this case?
Yes, you still have to come to my father's birthday dinner.
I didn't even bring that up. I'm just saying...
nice try. Nice try what?
zip!
I didn't even... Tzz!
Ah, the good life. Dr. Kyle Aldridge.
mansion next to Teddy Kennedy on Dupont Circle?
a 60-foot yacht and a vacation home in the Hamptons.
Wow.
I wish I'd paid more attention during science class.
intelligence is not a matter of will, Agent Booth.
so it's not a character flaw to be less intelligent than someone else.
Yeah. Listen, I appreciate the pep talk.
listen, our first suspect would usually be your wife, but since she's been in Venice for a month...
Venice.
so how is it that somebody who makes 80 grand a year can lend Ted Kennedy his lawn mower and afford to send his wife off to Venice?
my wife's family is very generous.
how generous do you think they would be if they found out that you were... boinking an intern?
they teach you that technique at Quantico?
spring vulgarities on the unsuspecting suspect, and he will confess all?
are you confessing all?
to the affair or to murder?
excuse me, Agent Booth.
there's something you're gonna want to see in Dr. Aldridge's workroom.
lights, please?
look at all that blood.
this cart explains how the body was transported over to the incinerator chute.
this must be where Kristen Reardon was actually murdered.
all right, put the lights on.
okay, Dr. Aldridge, I'd like to ask you a few questions about the murder of Kristen Reardon.
we gonna go willingly?
I never liked Kyle Aldridge.
he told me once that having a high IQ was no excuse not to bathe.
I don't believe it.
no, those were his exact words, "No excuse not to bathe.
what do you got?
consistent with the trauma to the left lung and aorta, the C-7 vertebrae and the fifth rib were both nicked at a 67-degree angle, suggesting a single point of entry.
through the back?
the serial killer eats human flesh.
Kyle Aldridge is a vegetarian.
so was Hitler.
we're calling him "Gormogon" now.
excellent name and historically accurate.
people, you have to stop assuming that Gormogon was in any way involved in Kristen's death.
Why? It's somewhere between a possibility and probability.
Kyle Aldridge is not a cannibal.
but he may have killed his girlfriend.
do you see the difference?
Mm.
so, eyes on the evidence, okay?
go.
Zack provided me with a fragment.
retrieved from the fifth rib.
running it through the GC mass spec.
what about the incinerator? I analyzed the ashes in the incinerator and found carbonized traces of Cedrus libani.
it's a species of cedar fir from Lebanon.
the Middle East is Aldridge's area of study.
and the Mesopotamians used cedar as an odor neutralizer during funerals to mask the smell of burning flesh.
can you see Aldridge committing a crime of passion and using his knowledge to cover it up?
I guess.
he's kind of...
exactly how well do you know Aldridge?
we had drinks.
I don't sleep with married men.
you're married, and you sleep with men besides your husband.
what's the difference?
Ow!
why do you want me to interrogate Aldridge?
because he thinks I'm stupid.
you're not.
Thanks, Bones, I know.
listen, during the interrogation, always refer to the victim by her first name.
well, you're the one that told me that personalizing the victim doesn't work with sociopathic serial killers.
they lack all empathy.
you told me that.
we are not looking for Gorgonzola today.
Gormogon. Gor-mo-gon.
we're looking for someone who murdered one girl and tossed her down an incinerator chute.
entirely different kind of a guy, so inside.
don't tell me... Don't...
you're not bossing me... Stop it.
Kyle Aldridge seduced my daughter?
that's what we hope to find out, Doc.
there's definitely Kristen's blood on your worktable.
that proves only she was killed in my workroom.
why am I talking to you?
what time did you leave the Jeffersonian that night?
shortly after 11: 00.
Dr. Brennan, surely I merit someone higher up the food chain than an FBI consultant.
Kyle, I know you get everything you want by flaunting your superior intellect, but that won't work with me.
why is that?
because I'm smarter than you are.
so why don't we do the rational thing and cut to the chase?
were you having an affair with Kristen?
I'm not willing to comment on that.
again, I know you were.
you first kissed at the opening of the Egyptian Exhibit.
obviously, Kristen was indiscreet.
if your wife knew about Kristen, she'd leave you, correct?
and you'd no longer be rich.
see, the FBI, they call that a "motive.
they think you did this, Dr. Aldridge.
and so far, the evidence is on their side.
can you tell me anything that would suggest otherwise?
Yes.
but first I need to speak with a lawyer and make arrangements with a federal prosecutor.
sounds like you want to cut a deal.
I've told you what I need.
so either have me arrested or let me make those arrangements.
all right, thank you, Doctor.
okay. Wow!
you look great!
I mean that objectively, not as your fake boyfriend.
thank you.
Hey, got your dad a universal remote.
even bought the batteries.
Oh. He'll never let us break up.
so, am I driving?
no, my sister's picking us up.
but of course, she's late.
okay. Maybe she's late because there was traffic.
maybe she's late 'cause there was a sale.
Oh, great.
it's gonna be one of those nights.
Hey, it's not me.
she's the jealous, competitive one.
okay.
you don't think so?
look, I'm thinking it's your family.
I am an innocent bystander with a universal remote and batteries trying not to get hit by shrapnel, that's all.
ready. Sorry. Dad is in the car.
okay, let me get my things.
there was traffic.
not that she'd believe me.
no, traffic, that's exactly what she said.
this is gonna be fun.
Yeah, everyone talking about how perfect Cam's life is.
no, Cam's life is not so perfect.
you have a lot going for you.
yeah?
Yeah.
what's not so great?
are you and Cam...
what?
no.
no, I should've never have said anything. Oh, you poor baby.
okay, Felicia...
you don't have to say anything.
I'm here, that's all you need to know.
okay.
let's go.
let's go!
Yeah, okay. You look great.
doesn't she look beautiful?
she looks beautiful! God, I'm so lucky to have you as my girlfriend.
easy, big guy, it's gonna be all night.
tell me about it.
you know, Jack, you are actually a better candidate to be Gormogon than Kyle Aldridge.
Really?
you're brilliant...
paranoid about conspiracies
I say that lovingly with limitless resources.
I'm not Gormogon.
I don't kill people and eat their faces.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not waging a secret war against anybody.
great. Now, if I can only get the other thousand or so people who work here to convince me, maybe I can sleep tonight.
Oh, I'll help you get to sleep tonight.
what's in your file?
GC mass spec analysis of the fragment we pulled from Kristen's rib.
it's 800-year-old copper.
wait a minute. The murder weapon is an artifact?
well, I thought we'd see if we can match any of the weapons in the Jeffersonian to the sample.
well, there is one item.
an 800-year-old copper spear tip.
the authentication department checked it out two weeks ago to a... Dr. Kyle Aldridge in the Middle Eastern Department.
checked it out from where?
the Gormogon Vault.
tell us about this piece, Dr. Klimkew.
the spearhead is genuine... decorative, probably brought back as a souvenir of the Crusades by a Templar Knight in 1200 or 1300 A. D.
go ahead, Hodgins.
what are you doing? -Did you see Kyle Aldridge the night that Kristen Reardon was murdered?
Yes. What is he doing with the spearhead?
it's phenolphthalein.
it won't affect the copper.
but if blood is present, it'll turn pink.
so, what time did you see the doctor?
uh, 11: 00... in the parking lot.
did you talk?
Kyle Aldridge doesn't really talk to anyone beneath him, which is everyone.
it's not the weapon we're looking for.
I'll put it back.
did you know about Aldridge and Kristen?
as a couple?
Yes.
Kristen told you?
no, I caught them making out.
frankly, I've been surprised ever since that Aldridge didn't use his friendship with Bancroft to have me transferred to some dig in Darfur.
help!
I need some help back here!
what?
hold on, hold on.
easy, easy.
