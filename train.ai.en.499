islamabad (reuters) -the suicide truck bomb attack that killed at least 53 people at the marriott hotel in pakistan's capital on saturday evening bore the hallmarks of an al qaeda operation, pakistani intelligence officials said.
islamabad complains loudly that it's excluded from the us intelligence loop.
islamabad has long insisted that the ring operated on a freelance basis without the knowledge of the country's leaders, but many western officials and analysts are highly sceptical of claims it was wholly independent of pakistan's government and military.
islamabad is keen to reject accusations that pakistani officials aided the us's public enemy number one, but has also expressed "deep concerns and reservations" about the unilateral nature of the raid that killed bin laden.
islamabad is using anxiety about china to keep us military aid flowing.
islamabad plays the two powers off against each another to get what it wants at lower cost and with less fuss.
islamabad prices are higher than any other country where the price from last year, december 40 pakistani rupees per kilogram, soared to 90 rupees.
islamabad reacted with fury to the attack.
islamabad remained relatively quiet on may 2nd.
islamabad responded with a warning that the u. s.risks losing an ally with such accusations.
islamabad's in full denial mode. They claim they shut down all militant groups.
islamabad's political realists may also point to a certain indignity at the heart of china and america's pakistani tug-of-war.
