and I just want to thank everyone in advance for helping me cope with my disability.
just bear with me.
well, uh, the January issue is our ready-to-wear issue.
our chief advertiser is Atlantic Attire, and we will be featuring the spring collection.
sorry to interrupt, Wilhelmina. Do you mind scooting down?
you know, so...
Oh.
of course.
you are the coeditors.
you know, you should get used to not having me around.
as we all know, in a few weeks,
I will be leaving "Mode" to help run Meade Publications and the Meade family.
so, uh, Sheila, uh, future creative director, why don't you just take it away?
Toodles.
what a pleasant surprise.
this isn't about the wedding, is it?
no, I came up to talk to you about my new position at the company.
now I'm thinking, after the wedding...
well, what...what's with that look?
Oh, I'm just a bit surprised, that's all.
I didn't think you'd be coming in that often.
Claire always spent her days... - drinking and murdering Fey?
well, your ex-wife and I are very different women.
in case you haven't noticed, I'm a career G.
you know I like to be hands-on.
and that's what I love about you. - Unh-unh-unh.
business first.
well, as cochair of Meade, you could have creative control of any magazine you like, - apart from... - "mode."I know.
Claire has made that impossible.
there are 22 other publications in this building.
well, perhaps I should familiarize myself with them.
Absolutely. Talk to the editors.
they're the people you're gonna be spending your time with.
now in the meantime, there is something over here that you could be a little more hands-on with.
and that's our travel feature for this month.
great.
so who's the cover?
well, actually, we might have lost Winona Ryder to a movie.
not sure whether she's making one or just going to see one.
I have an idea.
great. Alexis, let's hear it.
well, um, when I was at Hudson, uh, everyone was doing Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt.
we did Bill Murray right before "rushmore."
this is a great opportunity for a comeback.
Really? - Readers love the underdog.
listen and learn, people.
she's big.
she's sexy.
she's outrageous.
Anna Nicole Smith.
bam!
Hey, there you are.
are you crying? - I'm a girl. I'm allowed to now.
I made a fool of myself in there.
you know what?
maybe we are rushing this thing.
why don't you take tomorrow off?
but we have that photo shoot and the meeting with Atlantic Attire and...
something else. I forget.
damn it! I forget everything!
Hey, hey.
you're gonna be fine.
you need to trust your instincts.
you are doing everything right.
Oh, and by the way, you're in the men's room.
Daniel, I called Luke Carnes at Atlantic Attire, told him you'll be attending the meeting without Alexis.
here's his bio and all his previous advertising layouts.
also, your personal trainer got moved to 2: 00.
and you do know en I say "personal trainer," that's code for...
pedicure. - I know, betty. I invented the codes.
Oh, and one more thing.
I need you to read these female empowerment articles.
let me know what you think.
I heard the bear one's pretty good.
you know, I would do it, but I have my, uh, book club.
and when you say "book club," that's code for "hot date."
really, Betty?
I mean, what's the point in having codes?
so, uh, I have plans tonight, too.
going to my writing class. - Really?
great.
have fun. - I will.
you know, uh, reading my essay?
out loud, for everyone? - Cool.
I'm such an idiot.
your essay, of course.
it's great work. I gave you a gold star.
really loved it.
he hated it.
but I thought he said it was great?
what's the problem?
well, he did, but he gave me that fake smile and the thumbs-up.
he always does that when he's lying.
Hey. Call me later.
Oh, definitely.
did you read the quarterly competitive analysis?
riveting.
ready, slave? - Okay.
but I mean, this is Daniel.
he's not exactly the arbiter of great literature, is he?
let's face it. The only reason he's here is because of his dad.
well, maybe it started that way, but he's proven himself.
Daniel is very smart...
in a high five kinda way, and he's the first person who ever believed in me, so if Daniel thinks I suck, then...
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sure your story is lovely.
what's it about again?
I wrote about staying home on prom night.
Oh, wow. That sounds really sweet.
no. The professor wants grim and tortured.
damn it!
why do I have to be so sweet?
I saw the sun rise over the valley for the first time in ten years, and I knew I was home.
the end.
Yes, Jeremy, it is the end.
the end of literature.
Oh, God.
if only I hadn't blown that pulitzer money at the Indian casino.
let the torture continue.
you're up, crappy.
actually, it's...
clappy.
I hope your thoughts are better organized than your bag.
all right!
there aren't enough hours in the day!
when I saw my blood dripping off the bear's teeth...
you stop now?
for the first time today, I wasn't bored.
read.
read! Start with the title!
girl gone wild: How I survived a bear attack.
so if the hemlines in fall 2001 were 6 inches below the knee, and the hemlines in fall 2006 were 2 inches above the knee, what will the hemlines be in 2012, given the current rate?
who cares?
Oh.
I thought you liked all this fashion stuff.
uh...
let's find something else.
what...what are you into these days? - Not algebra.
okay.
well, um, good work today.
see you tomorrow.
so, Mr. Suarez, will Betty be home soon?
you're here for Justin.
let's keep it about that.
sure.
and as I write this,"pregnant...
with my first child...
I realize I survived for a reason."
That...was exactly what I've been looking for.
why can't the rest of you get attacked by a bear?
your assignment for this week is to live dangerously.
stop a knife fight. Take a bone from a pit bull. Now!
nice work.
it was worth almost having your ear torn off.
just out of perverse curiosity, - May I see it? - No.
I'm very self-conscious.
I thought it was your right ear. - It is.
when the bear was done with this one, he started nibbling on that one.
stupid bear.
stupid class.
you lying bitch.
Poquito?
is that you?
Yeah, that's right.
the bear's talking.
you didn't write that story.
you stole it. - I didn't mean to.
it was a mistake.
Betty Suarez is a cheater.
they laugh at me every day at "mode."
I didn't want them laughing at me in class, too, poquito.
wanna know what a bear attack really feels like, Betty?
Poquito!
No! No!
Oh, Marcie.
Yes, William?
fix your makeup, doll.
we're heading up to the executive suite, where every magazine in the Meade empire is coming to kiss the ring of the new cochair.
"adventure time" is extreme, extremely extreme.
it's base jumping off the space needle.
it's surfing a tsunami.
it's basically anything that breaks bones or cracks teeth.
our readers won't be satisfied until they've slammed into...
a chocolate souffl?
drizzled with a raspberry coulis.
Ooh!
and February's issue is devoted entirely to...
boobs.
that's what our 30-something straight male demo wants to see.
you're a talented lady.
you could do this in your sleep.
slap a hottie on the cover, throw in some articles on fast cars, video games and guns, and pop!
you're money.
Oh! The smell of Prada!
there's no place like home.
this isn't our home anymore, Marc. We have no home.
I'm gonna be stuck upstairs in that executive suite dealing with those commoners.
Willie, I think we may have made a terrible mistake.
I know. All I wanted to do was run a fashion magazine.
I was a simple girl with an evil plan.
fashion is our passion!
but Meade only has one fashion magazine, and it will never be mine.
Oh! We're doomed!
doomed!
off the floor, Marc.
no, your instincts were right. Fall again.
doomed!
I heard you're a cheater.
what?
I said, I'm out of sweetener.
can you grab me some downstairs?
Oh.
Yeah.
Hey, what's your bunny doing in the...
Daniel Meade's office.
this is Professor Barrett. Is this Betty Suarez?
no.
Yes. - Come see me at 2: 00.
we need to discuss your essay.
dy so, Luke, I'll talk to our advertisers, but I can pretty much promise Atlantic Attire ten pages in our January issue at cut rate.
good to be in business with you, Danny boy, and I like your style, too.
just one thing I need you to help me out with, though, before I sign a big, fat check.
anything. Hit me.
it's about your sister.
I didn't realize she would be coming back to work, after the accident and all.
Yeah, she really pulled through.
I mean, we're excited to have her back.
Yeah, see, that's the problem. Atlantic Attire is innocent.
I'm not sure we want to be associated with a magazine run by a cross-dresser.
are you kidding with this?
Aw, come on. Don't be all,"he's a hater."
I am the most tolerant man in town.
I got a black and a jew assistant, all right?
and the gays?
couldn't have an oscar party without 'em.
but I am a businessman.
I got a company I'm trying to brand.
I got a hundred stores I'm opening next month.
I can't afford to be associated with the whole he/she element.
are you asking me to fire my own sister to get your account?
dude, it sucks. I get it.
I had to give up the...
you know what I'm saying?
but these, my brother, are the sacrifices we gotta make for the bottom line.
you think about it and you get back to me.
ms. Suarez.
professor Barrett, I can explain.
it's very rare to find someone who can be so honest about their experiences.
this class is all about finding your voice, and, well, consider yours found.
it is?
your story moved me so much,
I just couldn't bear to keep it to myself.
and that was not a pun. I never pun.
so what are you saying?
I sent it to a colleague, an editor at "A New York Review."
he'd like to see you...
today.
well, well, it...
but...
but I...
you really do save it for the page, don't you?
I know you told me not to come in today, but after spending the day playing with makeup,
I think I finally got it right.
so I came in to show it off.
how'd the meeting with the advertiser go?
Yeah, great.
don't give me the smile and the thumb.
okay.
the truth?
I think I lost the account. - Why?
the guy had some issues with our staff.
what? With who?
doesn't matter. It's not his place.
Daniel, who are you protecting?
you.
me? What did I ever do to him?
Oh. I get it.
he doesn't want to sign with "mode"
because the coeditor-in-chief is...
like this.
Hey, hey. Where are you going?
maybe I should have just stayed home after all.
it's one advertiser. Don't let it get to you.
it's not worth it. - No, I'm not worth it.
look at me, I'm a mess.
I drove away that advertiser.
I practically killed us both in that accident.
I told you, that wasn't your fault.
Yes, it was!
I can't do anything right.
I can't drive. I can't do my job.
and I can't freakin' walk in these!
I'm okay.
come on, Halston. Help me out here.
I'm trying to find our daddy.
just bark if you see someone you recognize.
Ooh.
Mousse... the 'it' beauty product.
I heart the '80s.
what is it, boy?
editor-in-chief, Fey Sommers, and her assistant, Wanda, the palladium.
who the hell is Wanda?
okay, slim the nose, add about 20 years, a little botox.
Yes, yes.
Oh...
my...God, Ugly Willie.
what did you just call me?
you're saying no to "The New York Review"?
"the New York Review"?
do you have any idea how many doors this could open for you?
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't.
the truth is...
Hello?
Yes, I'm sitting with her right now. It's the legal department.
what? But no one's done anything illegal.
we don't need lawyers.
it's just a routine fact check on your piece.
Uh-huh.
no.
I haven't seen the ear yet.
now what do I need to do to convince you to let us print your piece?
sir, what I am trying to tell you is that...
I work at "mode."
that thing with the clothes.
Yes, and if I were to let a competing magazine print my article without giving them first look, then they would fire me.
definitely, they would fire me.
we couldn't let that happen to someone who's expecting, now - could we? - Expecting?
Oh! Yes, of course, my baby.
well, thank you.
that is very kind.
you're carrying low.
it's a boy.
I can always tell.
thank you.
interesting fact...
drop a penny and a blonde receptionist from the 28th floor, and they both hit the sidewalk at the same time.
I believe they call it, uh, terminal velocity.
okay, I think this is a really good time to point out...
that I am not a real blonde.
I thought I had gotten rid of all the pictures of Wanda.
apparently, I missed one.
I will never speak of this again.
I don't even remember what we're talking about right now.
okay, look, the only reason I was looking at old pictures of Fey is because I'm trying to figure out who my real father is.
even if I wanted to express sympathy, I physically can't.
okay, so...
if you're not gonna hurt me, then I'll just...
there's just one more thing.
according to the date on those photos, you were my mother's assistant during her pregnancy.
Oh, please, Wilhelmina.
you're my last hope.
is there any chance that you know who my father is?
april 26, 1981.
studio 54.
it was the early days of glam rock fashion.
Liza's between gay husband, and the party celebrating Fey's first issue of "mode" is in full swing.
it's snowing everywhere, and Fey's the belle of the ball.
I quickly lose track of her.
then I hear Fey's distinctive laugh.
I didn't see anything but the tweety bird tattoo on his ass.
I was conceived during Studio 54?
I knew there was glamour in my genes.
when Fey started puking up her breakfast, she was thrilled...
until she realized she was pregnant.
she swore me to secrecy, and in exchange, paid for my transformation from mousy assistant Wanda into supermodel Wilhelmina.
so you know who he is?
no.
Oh.
thanks anyway.
I've done a lot to put Wanda behind me.
your secret's safe with me.
I've put my blood, sweat and old nose into this place.
if I can't have "mode," no one else can.
Daniel, I want to talk to you about Luke Carnes.
I already know what you're gonna say.
I have no intention of asking Alexis to step down.
you underestimate me, Daniel.
I think we should lose the account. - - What?
we don't need Atlantic Attire or their money.
we have dozens of other loyal advertisers.
why would you back me on this?
Daniel, whether you like it or not, we're about to become a family, and family sticks together.
so Luke, let's talk about this account.
where do I sign?
actually, uh, you don't.
you see,"mode" doesn't need to be associated with bigots.
you're turning down ten pages for a man in a skirt?
that man is my sister.
dude,
I'm trying to help you out.
I don't need your help, Dude.
Oh! Betty. - Oh! Henry.
so I totally sucked at tutoring yesterday.
I referred to nine as a prime number. Can you imagine?
Nine...only divisible by one and itself?
I completely forgot about three.
Oh, no.
I know, but I am not giving up.
I stayed up all night, and I came up with some awesome new stuff.
you did?
I'm gonna dress up like pythagoras and teach him the pythagorean theorem.
that's so sweet.
thank you, um, for caring.
Oh, well, a boy needs his...
algebra.
okay.
catch you later, calculator.
Bye.
excuse me.
Hi. Can I help you?
you must be Betty Suarez.
Uh-huh.
I hear we have a lot in common.
first I was victimized by a grizzly and now you.
I'm not sure which is worse.
ms. Worthington, I can explain.
please explain why I got a call from my agent telling me the story
I submitted to "mode" ended up at "The New York Review" with your name on it.
well, I didn't mean for it to... - we'd be happy to.
Hi.
Daniel Meade, editor-in-chief.
nice to meet you.
you'll be the second person I name in my lawsuit.
no, Daniel, Ms. Worthington, this was all my mistake.
it was a big, huge mistake.
actually, it was mine.
see, I had two stories on my desk.
I must have mixed up the covers, because I sent the one I thought was Betty's to a friend of mine at "New York Review"
and he flipped over the story. Your story, unfortunately.
that is not the unfortunate part, if you ask me.
Yes, it is, because there is no way "mode" would let anyone else publish your amazing piece.
in fact, we're prepared to offer you double your fee.
I'm sorry. Talk into the good ear.
did you say double? - Absolutely.
well, I will think of something else for "The New York Review."
next summer I'm going diving in Australia.
lots of sharks there.
fingers crossed.
Betty, why don't you escort Ms. Worthington down and get the contract signed?
and when you're done, stop by my office.
we have to have a little chat.
Hello?
Hello?
what's your damage, you?
are you here alone?
you're supposed to be working on your algebra, not making out.
and...and I'm sure you're very nice, but you really shouldn't be wearing clothes like that until...
ever.
and you're drinking?
it's just beer.
beer is a gateway drug.
back off. You're not my dad!
what were you thinking?
do you know how much trouble "mode" could have gotten into?
how much trouble you could've gotten into?
I know!
I know. It was stupid, but I...
I got so nervous, and you read my story, and you gave me that fake smile and the thumbs-up.
wait. Does everybody know about that?
look, daniel, I know you didn't like it, so I read that woman's story, but I never thought it was gonna get so out of control.
you did all this because I didn't like your story?
Yeah.
I mean, your opinion means a lot to me. - That's crazy.
why do you even care what I think?
because you're the editor of "mode,"
and you're my friend.
you can't put me on a pedestal.
I mean, trust me, I don't deserve it.
you know as well as I do, the only reason I'm in this job is because of my father.
well, that's just what everybody else says.
everybody says that? - Daniel, it doesn't matter.
you are good at this, and you're getting better, and...
wait. This is supposed to be my pep talk.
okay, then you should have faith in yourself.
you're gonna get better, too.
I mean, maybe your story...
wasn't that great...
do you understand the meaning of "pep talk"?
maybe it wasn't that great, but...
there is a but...
it doesn't matter what I think.
it doesn't matter what your professor thinks.
do you like your story?
well...
the spelling was impeccable and there were some funny lines.
see?
I mean, there you go. It's okay to make mistakes.
you just have to learn from them.
I know I do.
guest list. Studio 54.
I was a good assistant.
and just so you know, Fey quit smoking during her pregnancy...
eventually.
now if that doesn't say love, I don't know what does.
Hey, whoa, whoa! Hey, buddy. Uncool.
it's just me.
didn't we just have the men's bathroom conversation yesterday?
I just heard what happened with Atlantic Attire.
I-I can't believe you did that.
you're the best brother in the world.
no, I'm not.
not even close. - Come on, daniel.
you totally stood up for me. - Look, stop it.
why are you being so weird about this?
you took care of me.
you've been taking care of me since the accident.
look, I can't do this anymore.
get out.
it wasn't your fault.
what? - The accident.
it was my fault.
I thought you said I swerved to miss a deer.
Yeah, I lied. I was drunk.
I was spun out on pills. You were speeding to try and get me to help.
as usual, I was the screwup.
I'm the reason you almost died.
it was my fault.
it was just an accident.
Hi, daddy.
Oh, and hello to you, too, pops.
Hola, papi.
you were all at Studio 54 that night, and I will find that tweety bird if I have to search every one of your asses.
I just talked to Tommy at Ralph Lauren who talked to Ralph at Tommy Hilfiger who slept with Calvin at Donna Karan who had drinks - with Karen at Calvin Klein... - point?
they all know about Atlantic Attire pulling out.
and now all those companies are talking about pulling their advertising, too.
people are saying that "mode" is in trouble.
wonder who started that rumor.
Oh, my god. It's happened.
the botox has finally seeped into your brain. What are you doing?
I took lemons and made a lemon martini.
so you want to destroy "mode"?
don't get me wrong, mad props on the evil, but I don't understand. Why?
follow the bread crumbs, Gretel.
there's only room for one fashion magazine at Meade publications, but if something were to happen to "mode,"
there would be room for...
holy Rosie, Oprah, Martha!
"Slater..."the fashion luxury magazine of the future.
it will rise like a phoenix from the ashes of "mode."
Henry, what's going on?
it's Justin.
he's a mess, and I can't do anything about it.
what are you talking about?
well, I got here tonight and found him kissing a girl...
with tongue...
and drinking beer.
are you kidding?
this is all my fault. I should have been here earlier.
Henry, it's not your fault.
Justin's going through some rough times.
he's gonna make mistakes. That's what kids do.
I didn't have a sip of beer until college, and I threw up all over the quad.
in fact, I hope he's up there throwing up right now.
Henry. - Well, it might be good for him.
maybe he'll learn his lesson.
or not.
I don't know. Tough love?
okay. Stop freaking out.
this is Hilda's responsibility.
well, I should know what to do, and I don't.
why do you need to know what to do?
because I'm gonna be a father!
Oh.
so the baby's yours?
well, how long have you known?
a couple days.
I didn't want to tell you because...
as long as you didn't know, there was still...
I don't know...
some fantasy where you and I could be together.
I'm sorry, Betty.
you should go.
sometimes we want things to be different.
we think maybe if we pretend that they are, fool people, that's enough, but it never is.
I know you all loved my last story, but the truth is, it wasn't mine, and all the wonderful things you said about it just made me feel awful.
so i'm sorry for lying.
and today I want to share with you my real story.
queen of my own prom.
maybe IF WE CAN FIND OUT WHO YOUR REAL FATHER IS...
he could be anybody.
they DENIED MY VISA.
I HAVE TO STAY HERE FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.
I MAY NOT HAVE "MODE," BUT VERY SOON,
I WILL HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING YOUR HUSBAND.
Alexis, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
why DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME ALEXIS?
it's ME, ALEX.
this WHOLE THING WITH HENRY, IT FINALLY GOT TO ME.
Henry's GONE.
I'm LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR MY KID.
Oh, GOD, HE'S GONE.
don't WORRY. NO ONE NOTICED.
and I WAS SAYING, "LIKE ALL GREAT FAMILIES,
we WILL PULL THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.
Brava! BRAVA!
Brava!
so THAT IS MY LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
commenting ON THE RECENT MEADE FAMILY MISFORTUNES.
um, I'M SORRY, BUT SHOULDN'T THE LETTER FROM THE EDITOR BE WRITTEN BY THE EDITOR-- DANIEL?
Oh, BETTY,

release, DWAYNE.
Whoa! EXCUSE ME! WHAT DO YOU WANT, BETTY?
I WAS JUST... COMING TO GET THE BOOK
so DANIEL COULD SIGN OFF ON IT.
tell DANIEL THE ISSUE WILL BE FILLED WITH PRETTY GIRLS WEARING SKIMPY LITTLE DRESSES.
that's ALL HE CARES ABOUT ANYWAY.
but I THINK THAT HE REAL-- BYE, BETTY.
but HE REAL-- GOOD-BYE, BETTY.
I KNOW THAT-- DWAYNE.
okay, OKAY. I'M LEAVING.
uh, CONFIRM MY LUNCH WITH NORA EPHRON
and MAKE SURE DWAYNE GETS A SET OF MY HOUSE KEYS.
Marc... OH.
you KNOW DANIEL NEEDS TO SEE THE BOOK BEFORE IT GOES TO THE PRINTER.
come ON. PLEASE. THIS IS MY JOB.
couldn't I JUST BORROW IT FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR?
what ARE THESE?
this SAYS "TO DANIEL MEADE.
they're JUST SOME NOTES FROM THE EDITORS.
don't YOU WORRY YOUR BUSHY LITTLE HEAD ABOUT IT.
Wilhelmina's ALREADY APPROVED THEM.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
now I REALLY NEED TO SEE THAT BOOK.
so I COULDN'T GIVE IT TO YOU EVEN IF I WANTED TO, WHICH I DON'T.
Oh, DWAYNE. IT'S A KEY. DON'T EAT IT.
Marc, I NEED TO FIRE CHLOE IN PRODUCTION.
I WANT YOU TO STAND NEXT TO ME AND NOD THOUGHTFULLY. MM.
Bye.
Hey, YOU.
Hi.
Henry. YOU'RE NOT IN TUCSON.
I AM. I-I MEAN, I WAS.
Oh.
a-and I'M GOING BACK.
Oh.
I-I-I'm REALLY SORRY ABOUT SANTOS.
Yeah, THANKS. I GOT THE FLOWERS. THAT WAS VERY SWEET.
so, UH, EVERYTHING WITH THE BABY AND...
Yeah. YEAH, IT'S ALL GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.
I've GOT MY BABY BOOKS,
I'm TAKING THE INFANT C. P. R. CLASS.
but, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
Henry, IT'S OKAY TO BE EXCITED.
I REALLY AM.
there's SOMETHING ABOUT BECOMING A FATHER.
you KNOW, I COULD WORK MY WHOLE LIFE
and NEVER BE THE BEST ACCOUNTANT,
but MAYBE I-I CAN BE THE BEST DAD.
I THINK YOU WILL BE.
listen, THE REASON I'M HERE...
I COULDN'T REALLY FIND A GREAT JOB IN TUCSON,
and THE MEADE HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD COVER
all THE MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR THE BABY, SO
Oh. SO YOU'RE COMING BACK TO WORK.
only IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU, BETTY.
if YOU THINK IT'S A PROBLEM, I'LL TURN DOWN THE JOB,
because I KNOW, IT--IT MIGHT BE WEIRD.
No! NO?
I MEAN "NO
not "NO," DON'T TAKE THE JOB. WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?
because WE GOT A LITTLE ROMANTIC?
we WERE YOUNG AND INNOCENT THEN.
Ah, YOUTH. BUT EVERYTHING'S COOL BETWEEN US.
we COULD JUST BE FRIENDS. BUDDIES.
buddies?
Yeah, YOU KNOW, LIKE, "HEY, BUDDY.
uh, "WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
uh, "WHAT'S THE DILLYO?
I CAN'T BE BUDDIES WITH HIM. AND HE WAS ALL LIKE, "OH, ARE YOU OKAY WITH ME WORKING HERE?
what AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY, NO?
no, YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY FOR YOUR BABY.
down WITH BABIES!
Betty, YOU NEED TO TELL HIM MAYBE THE BABY ISN'T EVEN HIS.
and MAYBE IT IS. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?
if CHARLIE WAS HAVING SEX WITH FARKAS,
she WAS PROBABLY HAVING SEX WITH A MILLION GUYS.
cause YOU KNOW SHE'S A SLUT. THE BABY COULD BE ANYBODY'S.
it COULD BE THAT GUY'S. HEY, DID YOU SLEEP WITH CHARLIE?
you MIGHT BE HAVING A BABY.
Betty, HENRY NEEDS TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
well, NOT FROM ME. I'M NOT BREAKING APART A FAMILY.
I've GOT ENOUGH DRAMA IN MY LIFE.
my DAD IS STUCK IN MEXICO. HE CAN'T COME HOME.
that's MORE THAN I CAN DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.
okay, WE'RE HERE.
what? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE'RE HERE"?
Oh, DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
we're BREAKING INTO WILHELMINA'S APARTMENT.
what?
now YOU NEED SUNSCREEN. HEY.
Betty's SON. NEPHEW.
so I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR... MOTHER? FATHER.
Yes, YES. WE SIGN SO MANY CARDS HERE.
so WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT "MODE"?
you AND YOUR LITTLE BAND OF RUFFIANS PICKING POCKETS?
my AUNT BETTY GOT ME A SUMMER INTERNSHIP.
Oh. GET THAT FOR ME
this COULD BE FUN. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING DONE?
Betty HAS ME SHARPENING PENCILS. I MEAN, I LOVE HER, BUT YAWN.
Yeah, HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THAT? LET'S SEE.
Wilhelmina NEEDS HER CONTACTS UPDATED.
any INTEREST?
this IS WILHELMINA'S?
Mm-hmm.
good AFTERNOON. I'M LOOKING FOR AMANDA TANEN.
I'm FROM RICHMAN, BRETT AND JACOBS.
the LAWYERS? WHAT DO I GET? AM I RICH?
I TAKE IT YOU'RE AMANDA TANEN.
Oh, MY GOD. DO I get this watch?
that IS MINE. PLEASE SIGN THIS.
what ABOUT THE CIGARETTE CASE?
please STOP TOUCHING MY THINGS.
so IT APPEARS MISS SOMMERS' TOWN HOUSE, WARDROBE AND AUTOMOBILES WERE AUCTIONED OFF AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH,
and THE PROCEEDS WERE GIVEN TO CHARITY.
you MEAN IT'S ALL GONE?
not EVERYTHING.
this IS FOR YOU.
Aah! WHAT IS THAT?
it's YOUR MOTHER'S BELOVED DOG HALSTON.
nice TRY, SLICK,
but YOU'RE NOT STICKING ME WITH THIS GREMLIN.
did I HAPPEN TO MENTION
there's A $1, 000-A-WEEK ALLOWANCE
for WHOEVER AGREES TO CARE FOR HIM?
Oh!
Oh, YES.
who's THE LITTLE BABY?
so YOU TOLD ALEXIS ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND FEY?
look, SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT MOM ON TV,
but I AM NOT GONNA BE THE ONE TO TELL ALEXIS
you DIVORCED MOM TO MARRY WILHELMINA,
or THAT YOU REJECTED YOUR OWN CHILD
because SHE BECAME A WOMAN.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM TELLING ALEXIS THE TRUTH.
then GREAT. HER ROOM'S RIGHT DOWN THERE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY IN LUCIFER'S CHAMBER...
BEELZEBUB'S LAIR...
the DEVIL'S RUMPUS ROOM.
Ooh, LOOK. A PHOTOGRAPH OF WILHELMINA WITH DICK CHENEY.
Christina, PLEASE STOP ENJOYING YOURSELF AND HELP.
we've GOT TO GET THE BOOK AND GET OUT OF HERE.
the BEDROOM.
Satan's BOUDOIR. VAMPIRA'S-- STOP IT.
10 BUCKS SAYS THERE'S A COAT IN THERE
made OUT OF DALMATIAN PUPPIES.
here IT IS. I GOT IT. HERE IT IS.
who IS THAT?
Wilhelmina's SUPPOSED TO BE AT LUNCH WITH NORA EPHRON.
that's NOT NORA EPHRON.
that's A MAN. IT'S MR. MEADE.
they're HERE FOR A QUICKIE, AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.
afternoon DE-- THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS?
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SONG TILL JUST NOW.
okay, UM, UNDER THE BED.
Oh, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'm SO HAPPY TO GET OUT OF THAT OFFICE.
this IS JUST SO DECADENT.
everyone AT THE OFFICE THINKS I'M HAVING LUNCH WITH THE GREAT NORA EPHRON.
little DO THEY KNOW,
Nora's BEEN COVERING MY DAYTIME ROMPS FOR YEARS.
you SEEM A LITTLE TENSE. HOW ABOUT A BACK RUB?
that's NOT MR. MEADE.
can I BE ON TOP THIS TIME?
don't BE STUPID.
well, THAT WAS RELAXING.
I DO LOVE AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT.
is THAT WHAT THAT SONG MEANS?
come, DWAYNE.
I THINK I NEED SOME PROTECTING IN THE SHOWER.
Oh, COME ON. THAT WAS A STRIKE, YOU IDIOT!
not INTERRUPTING, AM I?
just ANOTHER BLOWN SAVE.
Yeah, WE COULD STILL USE A GOOD CLOSER.
I SEE THERE'S SOME OF ALEX STILL IN THERE.
what WAS THAT?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
what's UP, DAD?
you HAVEN'T CALLED ME THAT IN YEARS.
well, I-I WAS A LITTLE HEADSTRONG WHEN I WAS ALEX.
maybe ALEXIS CAN HAVE A SOFTER TOUCH.
maybe I CAN, TOO.
okay, WILHELMINA'S CONTACTS ARE COMPLETELY REORGANIZED.
also, I INVENTORIED ALL THE GOWNS THAT SHE WORE ON THE RED CARPET LAST YEAR AND BOOKED HER TRAVEL TO PARIS
for THIS SEASON'S COUTURE SHOWS.
and WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
I DID IT IN UNDER AN HOUR.
an HOUR?
you WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING?
pricing WEIMARANERS, GETTING A PLUMBER FOR THE HOUSE IN BEDFORD,
sending WARREN BEATTY A 60th YEAH, RIGHT--BIRTHDAY CARD, TELLING DAVID SEDARIS
his 5, 000-WORD PIECE IS NOW A 50-WORD PIECE,
getting YELLED AT BY DAVID SEDARIS
and ASKING CHRIS ROCK TO WRITE A 10-MINUTE TOAST THAT WILHELMINA IS GIVING TO PATTY HEARST TO MARK THE 33rd ANNIVERSARY OF HER KIDNAPPING
and THAT IS ALL IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.
Wow.
Yeah, THAT'S HOW THIS LADY ROLLS.
hang ON. WILHELMINA SLATER'S OFFICE.
Oh, MY GOD.
it's COMING UP NOW?
the CONTRACT RIDER FOR SHAKIRA'S PHOTO SHOOT
is ARRIVING AS WE SPEAK.
in IT IS A LIST OF EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS FOR HER DRESSING ROOM.
ambitious SUCK-UPS!
I MEAN... INTERNS!
write THIS DOWN. EVERYTHING.
I'm DOING OKAY, PAPI.
I JUST--I MISS HIM SO MUCH.
I know, Mija,
but IT'LL GET BETTER.
Yeah. AT LEAST I HAVE HIS THINGS.
what THINGS?
I WENT AND I CLEANED OUT HIS APARTMENT.
a LOT OF HIS STUFF LOOKS REALLY GOOD IN OUR PLACE.
Really? I DON'T REMEMBER SANTOS HAVING SUCH GOOD TASTE.
you're crazy.
he HAD SUCH AN EYE. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
sweetheart, um,
I know everything holds a memory for you now,
but ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY?
when your mother died,
I couldn't let go of any of her things
her CLOTHES, HER KEY CHAIN.
I EVEN FOUND AN OLD RESTAURANT CHECK
from PIETRO'S IN BAYSIDE.
it WAS FROM THE NIGHT WE GOT ENGAGED.
your MOTHER HAD SAVED IT ALL THOSE YEARS,
and WHEN I SAW IT, I...
I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED ALL HER THINGS.
I HAD HER HEART.
so I KEPT THE CHECK...
and GOT RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE.
but WHERE IS IT? I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.
I'm LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.
I REALLY MISS YOU, PAPI.
I MISS U TOO.
sorry I'M LATE, MAMA. I'LL GET THE ENCHILADAS STARTED.
MIRTA'S NOT HERE.
thank GOD. ENOUGH WITH THE BEANS AND CHEESE.
you WANNA ORDER CHINESE?
beans, CHINESE?
are YOU OKAY?
I WAS JUST TALKING TO HILDA.
you GET LIKE THIS EVERY TIME YOU CALL.
your VISA WILL COME THROUGH. YOU'LL BE HOME SOON.
I'm SO TIRED OF HEARING THAT!
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANY LONGER, CLARA!
my DAUGHTER BURIED THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,
and I COULDN'T BE THERE TO HOLD HER.
maybe I SHOULD JUST GET THERE ON MY OWN.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? FORGET THE VISA.
I'll JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER ANOTHER WAY.
I've DONE IT BEFORE. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
treat ME LIKE A CRIMINAL, I'LL BE ONE.
I WANNA GO HOME.
well, THEN...
if YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY WAY,
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU.
Dwayne, PLEASE HURRY.
I SMELL A BURRITO.
this IS EMBARRASSING.
A. J. YOU WERE ASSIGNED NUMBER SIX ON SHAKIRA'S RIDER.
read THAT TO ME.
one BOX OF BENDY STRAWS"?
Uh-huh. BENDY STRAWS!
now LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU BROUGHT BACK.
okay, SO I'M SHAKIRA, AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DRINK,
so I TAKE A STRAW, AND I PUT IT IN MY CUP.
A--OH, BUT WHAT'S THIS?
it DOESN'T BEND? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
how AM I SUPPOSED TO DRINK? LIKE--LIKE THIS?
this ISN'T COMFORTABLE. I CAN'T DRINK LIKE THIS.
am I SOME KIND OF ANIMAL? NO. YO SOY SHAKIRA!
and I WILL NOT BE HOLDING MY DRINK DOWN AROUND MY CHIN LIKE SOME SAVAGE IF I'M THIRSTY!
now THIS STRAW DEBACLE IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
only ONE OF OF YOU-- ONE
got HIS LIST CORRECT.
the REST OF YOU CAN LEAVE.
Justin, YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.
awesome.
go.
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.
hmm?
I NEED DIRT ON BETTY SUAREZ.
I'm HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR, WILHE-MEISTER.
okay, CHOCOLATE ALMOND MILK.
I THINK THAT THERE'S A HEALTH STORE ON 59th.
Oh, PFFT! THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT.
I WAS JUST THINKING,
we DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OUR FAMILIES.
you GO FIRST.
I'm LOOKING FOR A PACKAGE FOR ALEXIS.
ironic, AS I SAY THAT OUT LOUD.
Oh! WHAT IS THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S THAT DOG.
it IS NOT THAT DOG.
it SMELLS LIKE ASS.
Yeah, AND WHEN YOU'RE 84, YOU'RE GONNA SMELL LIKE ASS, TOO.
leave HALSTON ALONE.
he WAS A GIFT TO ME FROM MY MOTHER.
I GET $1, 000 A WEEK TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,
which MEANS $5 FOR DOG FOOD,
and THE NEW BALENCIAGA BAG FOR ME.
is HE SUPPOSED TO TIP OVER LIKE THAT?
Oh, MY GOD!
Amanda! OH, THERE YOU ARE! IS DANIEL IN HIS OFFICE?
I DON'T KNOW WHERE DANIEL IS. I HAVE TO GO TO THE VET!
hang ON, HALSTON. DON'T QUIT ON ME.
well, IF HE WASN'T AT THE HOSPITAL,
then WHERE COULD HE BE?
Justin, ARE YOU DOING OKAY?
can't TALK. LOOKING FOR GUA JUICE.
why DO YOU CARE SO MUCH
if WILHELMINA'S BOINKING THE BODYGUARD?
because DANIEL IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
to INCRIMINATE WILHELMINA, AND HE COULD USE THIS
Oh!
good, YOU'RE BACK. WILHELMINA WANTS TO SEE YOU.
Oh, UM, OKAY, YEAH, GREAT.
I JUST HAVE SOME THINGS THAT I NEED TO FINISH UP,
and I'LL STOP BY HER OFFICE ON THE WAY OUT.
no, YOU WON'T.
she's WAITING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW... ON THE ROOF.
the ROOF?
the ROOF.
Hello?
I BELIEVE YOU LOST SOMETHING.
thank YOU, MARC. YOU CAN GO NOW.
you SURPRISE ME, BETTY.
stealing MY KEYS?
breaking INTO MY APARTMENT? TAKING THE BOOK?
good FOR YOU. YOU'RE... GROWING.
look, I WAS JUST THERE FOR THE BOOK.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HEAR ANYBODY HAVING SEX.
look, DWAYNE AND I ARE DEAR OLD FRIENDS.
that HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BRADFORD.
whom YOU LOVE, RIGHT?
because YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH.
whom I LOVE MADLY.
do WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?
Wilhelmina, I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
that MY LOYALTIES ARE WITH DANIEL,
so THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME.
it WAS VERY WONDERFUL TO SEE THE ROOF. THANK YOU.
pity ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
what ABOUT MY FATHER?
Oh, I KNOW THAT HE'S STUCK IN MEXICO.
shame. MY FATHER IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR.
he HELPS PEOPLE GET THEIR VISAS ALL THE TIME.
so WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
come ON, GIRL. I AM BLACK. YOU'RE MEXICAN.
let's NOT TALK AROUND IT LIKE A COUPLE OF DULL WHITE PEOPLE.
keep YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOUR OLD MAN COMES HOME.
so LIE TO DANIEL?
not LIE, JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
there's A DIFFERENCE.
you THINK ABOUT IT, BETTY,
and GET BACK TO ME BY THE END OF THE DAY.
no PRESSURE.
after ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.
Hey, BETTY.
what's UP, BUDDY?
Hey.
still NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT. HEY, I TALKED TO DAD!
Oh, UH, YOU OKAY?
okay? I'M GREAT!
it's JUST WONDERFUL TO KNOW I HAVE SUCH A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY AT A TIME LIKE THIS.
supportive?
he's TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE ABOUT ME BECOMING THIS...
with THESE.
will YOU STOP GRABBING THEM FOR A SECOND?
dad... SAID HE WAS OKAY WITH ALL THIS?
what ELSE DID HE TELL YOU?
and I GOT THE SEEDLESS GRAPES,
a TUB OF RED VINES.
the ONLY THING I COULDN'T FIND WAS THE SCULLY FOODS 100% ORGANIC, ALL-NATURAL SOY RICE CAKES.
Ah, THE RICE CAKE
the SCOURGE OF MANY A CELEBRITY ASSISTANT.
need I MENTION THE '88 MADONNA "SPEED THE PLOW" TANTRUM?
don't SWEAT IT.
you STILL HAVE 12 MORE HOURS
before YOU NEED TO BRING THEM TO THE SHAKIRA SHOOT.
Oh... MY... GOD.
I AM GOING TO THE SHAKIRA PHOTO SHOOT? YEP.
are YOU SERIOUS? THESE LIPS DON'T LIE.
this IS AMAZING!
I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL MY...
you OKAY?
Yeah, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
Hey, JUSTIN.
it's OKAY.
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT WITH YOUR DAD
and EVERYTHING, BUT...
it's OKAY TO BE HAPPY.
U DID A GOOD JOB TODAY.
enjoy IT.
Hi. HI.
I JUST MADE A LITTLE PERSON FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIS DAY.
I'm A GOOD PERSON. NO, I'M A GREAT PERSON.
does YOUR RAT HAVE A STRONG SMELL?
HALSTON IS SICK, OKAY? I JUST TALKED TO THE VET.
he NEEDS OINTMENTS AND PATCHES AND PILLS.
Oh, MY. SUDDENLY I AM A CAREGIVER.
me. THAT IS SO NOT WHO I AM.
tis TRUE. YOU ARE A BIT OF A MONSTER ON THE INSIDE.
this IS HORRIBLE.
it's ALMOST LIKE I'D BE BETTER OFF GETTING RID OF HIM.
how COULD YOU?
damn IT.
how COULD YOU LIE TO ALEXIS LIKE THAT?
did I? I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.
well, LET'S START WITH HOW YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
you'd REJECT HER IF SHE GOT A SEX CHANGE.
I THINK YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE, "YOU'D BE DEAD TO ME.
and YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER ABOUT WILHELMINA.
you're GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH, DAD.
you're RIGHT, DANIEL. I DIDN'T.
I SAW ALEXIS LYING IN THAT BED
and REALIZED I ALMOST LOST MY CHILD... AGAIN.
this IS A CHANCE FOR US TO START A WHOLE NEW RELATIONSHIP.
no WAY. YOU ARE NOT SCREWING WITH HER HEAD LIKE THIS.
if YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER THE TRUTH, I AM.
Daniel... YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO REWRITE THE PAST
I NEED TO FIX THE MISTAKES I MADE.
mija?
dad?
you ALL RIGHT?
dad, HELP ME! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Yeah, IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.
let ME TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
keep YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND GET MY ASS HOME FROM MEXICO.
but DANIEL'S MY BOSS.
Oh, YEAH? WELL, DID YOUR BOSS BRING YOU HOME IN A LITTLE BLANKIE FROM THE HOSPITAL?
did YOUR BOSS TEACH YOU HOW TO SWIM?
did YOUR BOSS PULL YOU OFF THE TRACKS SECONDS BEFORE A SUBWAY CAR WAS ABOUT TO CRUSH YOU?
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID THAT. I DIDN'T, THE FIRST TWO THINGS WEREN'T IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.
family, BETTY. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY?
I KNOW, PAPI, I KNOW. IT'S JUST...
it's SO WRONG,
and WE SHOULD JUST TRUST THE SYSTEM, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'LL GET YOUR VISA ON YOUR OWN.
and ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TELL THE TRUTH I HATE IT THAT I RAISED YOU RIGHT.
Ooh, THOSE SMELL GOOD.
can I HAVE SOME?
you're HELPING DANIEL.
get DANIEL TO MAKE YOU ENCHILADAS!
Hey, CHRISTINA, I WAS WONDERING...
did YOU KNOW IF, FOR SOME REASON,
Betty MIGHT BE MAD AT ME?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I MEAN, YOU DID LEAD HER ON, THEN RACE OFF TO TUCSON,
then AFTER A FEW WEEKS,
once SHE WAS STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER,
suddenly POP BACK INTO HER LIFE AGAIN.
I'm SORRY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. OH, HENRY.
she's NOT MAD, SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.
well, I'M CONFUSED, TOO.
I MEAN, I KNOW I HAVE THIS OBLIGATION TO CHARLIE
and I CAN'T WAIT TO BE A DAD, BUT...
I JUST... I REALLY MISS WHAT BETTY AND I HAD.
Henry, SHE'S MAKING AN UMPTY OUT OF YOU. AN UMPTY?
jackass. BETTY?
Charlie! HOW?
come HERE.
let ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BABY OF YOURS, 'CAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO.
okay, HALSTON, THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME!
isn't IT PRETTY? IT'S SO PRETTY.
so PRETTY.
can I HELP YOU?
Hi, I'M LOOKING FOR A NICE NEW HOME FOR MY SWEET LITTLE DOGGY.
Yeah, WE'LL TAKE IT. SIGN THIS FORM.
so IS THERE, LIKE, A BIG GRASSY AREA IN THE BACK
where THE DOGGIES CAN RUN AROUND? SURE, WITH PEANUT BUTTER
and A POOL SHAPED LIKE A DOG BONE.
Ah! REALLY?
no.
Hey, UH, CAN I AT LEAST SAY GOOD-BYE?
okay, HALSTON, I'M SURE SOMEONE WILL ADOPT YOU.
I DON'T KNOW. THAT IS ONE UGLY DOG.
pot, KETTLE, BLACK.
do YOU MIND?
this DOG BELONGED TO MY MOTHER.
does YOUR MOTHER KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS?
because I'M NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN.
my MOTHER IS GONE, AND THIS WAS HER DOG.
and SHE ONCE HELD HIM JUST LIKE I AM HOLDING HIM NOW.
you KNOW MORE ABOUT HER THAN I WILL EVER KNOW.
and SO WHAT IF YOU'RE MANGY AND DISGUSTING WITH A WEIRD RASH ON YOUR BUTT?
ORAYBE THAT IS YOUR BUTT?
but YOU'RE THE ONLY CONNECTION I'LL EVER HAVE TO MY MOTHER.
back OFF, CUJO. I'M TAKING HIM HOME.
hungry? MM!
I BROUGHT YOU BARROW STREET BURGERS.
you MAY NOT REMEMBER, BUT YOU ALWAYS LIKED IT.
Hey, I'M NOT PICKY.
up TILL YESTERDAY I WAS EATING OUT OF A TUBE.
Mmm! THESE ARE GOOD.
so, UM...
I KINDA WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT... DAD.
you KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINNG A LOT ABOUT HIM TODAY, AND YOU.
waking UP IN THIS BED,
thinking I WAS ALEX, I FELT ALONE.
but, YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT MADE IT OKAY
was KNOWING THAT YOU AND DAD ARE REALLY THERE FOR ME.
Yeah.
Yeah, WE WERE... HERE FOR YOU.
so LISTEN, I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU YET.
how DID WE EVEN GET INTO THIS ACCIDENT?
um... WELL...
Oh, GOD, DANIEL, WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME?
was IT MY FAULT? NO!
was I DRUNK? NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU--YOU WERE FINE.
uh, IT WAS JUST, UH...
a DEER.
it--it LEAPT OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAR,
you SWERVED... AND THAT WAS IT.
well, AT LEAST I SAVED A DEER.
dad!
so... HOW ARE WE?
we're GREAT.
I WAS JUST TELLING DANIEL I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU TWO AS MY FAMILY.
rice CAKES!
all RIGHT, UH... ANYTHING ELSE?
Nope. THAT'S IT.
Justin SUAREZ, RIGHT?
Yeah. HOW'D YOU KNOW?
I WAS AT YOUR FATHER'S FUNERAL.
you KNOW, HE SAVED MY LIFE, RIGHT HERE IN THIS STORE.
your FATHER WAS A HERO.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS WHERE... THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
you SHOULD KNOW, HE WAS A REALLY GOOD MAN.
I BET YOU'RE JUST LIKE HIM.
no... I'M NOT.
Thanks, BETTY.
Daniel, WAIT.
I NEED TO TELLOU SOMETHING.
Oh, UM... IT'S MY DAD.
can I TALK TO YOU IN A MINUTE?
Yeah.
Hello? BETTY?
dad? I'M COMING HOME.
what? DID YOUR VISA COME THROUGH? NO.
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE. THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS, A YEAR.
what ARE YOU SAYING? DAD, NO.
if YOU GET CAUGHT, THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU BACK IN,
and YOU KNOW HOW THEY PACK THOSTRUCKS WITH PEOPLE.
you COULD DIE. IT'S MY LIFE, BETTY. THIS IS MY DECISION.
no, THESE ARE OUR LIVES, DAD
yours AND MINE AND HILDA'S AND JUSTIN.
mija, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. I LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT.
dad, PLEASE, JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING YET.
I KNOW HOW TO GET YOU HOME.
let me talk to the lawyer one last time.
you DO LIKE TO CUT IT CLOSE.
Oh, AND THE PICTURES THAT SANTOS
took OF HIMSELF AT THE GYM DO NOT NEED TO BE FRAMED.
okay, SO I'M KEEPING ONE THING.
you SHOULD KEEP SOMETHING, TOO.
just LOOK THROUGH ALL THE STUFF
and FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY LOVE, OKAY?
okay. OKAY.
okay.
look, I NEVER SIGNED OFF ON BRIGITTE LACOMBE.
I THOUGHT WE AGREED IF WE COULDN'T GET MARIO TESTINO,
we WOULDN'T DO THE SPREAD.
I STILL LIKE THE DAVID LaCHAPPELLE
Chateau MARMONT PHOTOS WE COULDN'T RUN LAST MONTH.
you're RIGHT.
you're BACK, AND YOU ARE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.
I MADE A MISTAKE.
is THAT ALL?
uh, YES... THAT IS ALL.
Oh, BETTY, I HEARD YOUR FATHER'S COMING BACK ON THURSDAY.
please GIVE HIM MY REGARDS.
that WENT SO MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
Betty, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.
if YOU HADN'T GOTTEN THE BOOK,
she WOULD'VE DONE EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.
Oh, I'M JUST DOING MY JOB, DANIEL.
no, I MEAN, WHEN EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE,
you're THE ONE PERSON HERE
I CAN TRULY TRUST.
Yeah.
sweetheart?
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CAVALLI'S PEOPLE.
he IS DESIGNING YOU A CHARCOAL GRAY,
single BUTTON TUXEDO FOR THE WEDDING.
and HE'S FLYING HIMSELF IN FOR THE FITTING.
listen, DARLING, WITH ALEXIS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL,
I'm NOT SURE A GIANPARTY
would BE APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW.
well, YOU WANT ME TO CUT DOWN THE SIZE OF THE WEDDING?
I WANT TO POSTPONE THE WEDDING.
because OF ALEXIS?
I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HER. WE'RE STARTING TO BOND AGAIN.
well...
isn't THAT, UH, WONDERFUL?
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.
Alexis IS STILL COMING TO TERMS WITH THE FACT
that HER MOTHER AND I ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.
I'm AFRAID IT MIGHT BE A BIT MUCH FOR HER TO HEAR THAT I'M MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE.
you HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD HER ABOUT ME?
I WILL, WHEN SHE'S READY.
you STILL LOVE ME?
always.
uh, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GO CALL CAVALLI AND HAVE HIM POSTPONE HIS TRIP.
are YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?
I'm FINE.
Betty! PAPI JUST CALLED!
he GOT HIS VISA! HE'S GONNA BE HOME ON THURSDAY!
Wow! COOL. THAT'S--I'M SO HAPPY.
yeah? WELL, TELL YOUR FACE.
come ON! WE GOTTA PLAN A BIG PARTY!
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA WORK OUT.
Oh, I JUST KNEW IT!
so YOU GOT RID OF SANTOS' THINGS?
are YOU OKAY?
Yeah, I'M OKAY.
but YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE WITH THAT.
Wow. I LIKE IT.
strike.
I GOTTA GO PLAN THE MENU.
Ooh, DO YOU THINK IT'S WRONG IF WE ASK PAPI TO COOK?
hello.
Yes, CAN I HELP YOU?
you JUST DID.
Hello?!
who IS IT?
it's ME.
Christina TOLD ME ABOUT CHARLIE,
that SHE CHEATED ON ME.
the BABY MIGHT NOT BE MINE.
Oh, GOD, HENRY.
you've BEEN DRINKING.
Yes, I HAVE.
but... I DRANK MILK FIRST TO...
coat MY STOMACH.
Charlie WAS THE ONLY REASON WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.
and SHE'S NOT A REASON ANYMORE.
I WANNA BE WITH YOU, BETTY.
it's my baby.
I have to go to Tucson with her.
Dr. Farkas has been dating a girl named Charlie.
maybe the baby isn't Henry's!
you are Fey Sommers' daughter.
maybe if we can find out who your real father is...
he could be anybody.
they denied my visa.
I have to stay here for I don't know how long.
I may not have Mode, but very soon,
I will have everything else, including your husband.
Alexis, can you hear me?
why do you keep calling me Alexis? It's me, Alex.
this whole thing with Henry, it finally got to me.
Henry's gone.
I'm looking for something for my kid.
Oh, God, he's gone.
and in these difficult times which challenge us and test the strength of our character, I'm reminded that 'Mode' is a family, and like all great families...
don't worry. No one noticed.
and I was saying, like all great families, we will pull through this together.
Brava! Brava! Brava!
so that is my letter from the editor commenting on the recent Meade family misfortunes.
um, I'm sorry, but shouldn't the letter from the editor be written by the editor - Daniel?
Oh, Betty, dear, pie-eyed, pie-eating Betty.
his sister has lost her memory.
he's still in a wheelchair.
now I know he pays you for your south-of-the-border spirit, but let's give Daniel a break.
but he's fine.
he could totally do.
okay, people, we close the issue tonight.
let's get to work.
Dr. Fine, proctology. Dr. Fine...
partial retrograde amnesia the last thing Alexis remembers is mom's birthday party two years ago.
nothing since then. Blank.
she doesn't even remember becoming a woman. Look at her.
she's been doing that all night.
as far as Alexis knows, we're a happy family.
she doesn't know mom and dad are divorced.
she doesn't know mom escaped from prison, or was in prison, for that matter.
sorry. I was just trying to put myself in her shoes.
okay, are you ready to go?
no, no, no, no. I can't. I gotta stay with her.
I'm the reason she's here in the first place.
what? No.
Daniel, Wilhelmina has been running Mode by herself.
she hasn't taken any of your changes, and she wrote the letter from the editor.
the issue ships tomorrow. Don't you at least want to sign off on the book?
see, that's another thing.
how I am supposed to tell Alexis our father is marrying Wilhelmina?
so that's a yes on seeing the book?
Yeah, get the book.
is there something you want to tell me?
Claire Meade is still at large after escaping from Rikers three weeks ago.
Claire, if you're watching, lose the ankle bracelet.
chunky is out.
a lock of your hair in this one and a piece of Bradford's ear hair in this one.
how do you even know how to do that?
D. N.A. Testing? Oh, not the first time.
so in 24 hours, we will have conclusive proof if Bradford Meade is your daddy.
you okay?
I don't know.
I just stare at her picture all day, and then I stare at myself in the mirror.
more than usual?
Yeah.
I just wish I got to know her better.
Yeah, yeah, and I wish I got to know Marlon Brando before he got fat, but can we cut to what's important here?
there's a Fey Sommers estate out there with your name on it.
have you heard from the lawyers yet?
I should be getting the news later today.
just waiting to hear from the probate judge.
mom, all the boxes are still here.
Yeah, I know. I'm still going through them.
your father had a lot of great stuff at his apartment, like these.
you can't find these anywhere.
mom, we're in queens.
you can find those everywhere.
they were your father's. We're keeping them.
here's your lunch for your first day at Mode, Mr. Big shot intern!
you want me to bring my lunch?
mom, the famous Mode cafeteria?
where Naomi Campbell had a tuna melt and a meltdown?
they now have it on the menu - the Naomi Campbell tuna meltdown.
Yeah.
do you know I am so proud of you?
and I know your father would be, too.
that face!
and call Randy Dezerga.
see if he's free to shoot the Milan shows.
will do, Wilhe.
Oh, and I got a call from Alexa d-aah!
what is that did I forget to introduce you to Dwayne, my new bodyguard?
I can't keep checking over my shoulder to see if that crazy Claire Meade's running after me with a bottle of acid.
so he'll just attack anyone?
if he feels I'm in danger.
Oh, my God!
it's Claire Meade charging for us.
help!
release, Dwayne.
excuse me!
what do you want, Betty?
I was just...
coming to get the book so Daniel could sign off on it.
tell Daniel the issue will be filled with pretty girls wearing skimpy little dresses.
that's all he cares about anyway.
but I think that he real. - Bye, Betty.
but he real. - Good-bye, Betty.
I know that... - Dwayne.
okay, okay. I'm leaving.
uh, confirm my lunch with Nnora Ephron and make sure Dwayne gets a set of my house keys.
you know Daniel needs to see the book before it goes to the printer.
come on. Please. This is my job.
couldn't I just borrow it for, like, an hour?
get away from my desk, or I'll have Dwayne snap you in two.
what are these?
this says to Daniel Meade.
they're just some notes from the editors.
don't you worry your bushy little head about it.
Wilhelmina's already approved them.
no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. He hasn't even seen them!
now I really need to see that book.
look, it's at Wilhelmina's apartment.
so I couldn't give it to you even if I wanted to, which I don't.
Oh, Dwayne.
it's a key. Don't eat it.
Marc, I need to fire Chloe in production.
I want you to stand next to me and nod thoughtfully.
Bye.
Hey, you.
Hi.
you're not in Tucson.
I am. I- I mean, I was.
a- and I'm going back.
I-I-I'm really sorry about Santos.
Yeah, thanks. I got the flowers.
that was very sweet.
so, uh, everything with the baby and...
Yeah. Yeah, it's all going according to plan.
I've got my baby books, I'm taking the infant C. P.R. Class.
but, you know, whatever.
Henry, it's okay to be excited.
I really am.
there's something about becoming a father.
you know, I could work my whole life and never be the best accountant, but maybe I- I can be the best dad.
I think you will be.
listen, the reason I'm here...
I couldn't really find a great job in Tucson, and the Meade health insurance would cover all the medical expenses for the baby, so...
so you're coming back to work.
only if it's okay with you, Betty.
if you think it's a problem, I'll turn down the job, because I know, it- it might be weird.
No! - No?
I mean, no, it's not a problem, not no, don't take the job.
why would it be weird?
because we got a little romantic?
we were young and innocent then.
Ah, youth.
but everything's cool between us.
we could just be friends.
buddies. - Buddies?
Yeah, you know, like, hey, buddy.
uh, what's up, buddy?
uh, what's the dillyo?
dillyo?
I can't be buddies with him.
and he was all like, oh, are you okay with me working here?
what am I supposed to say, no?
no, you can't make money for your baby.
down with babies!
Betty, you need to tell him maybe the baby isn't even his.
and maybe it is.
I mean, who knows?
if Charlie was having sex with Farkas, she was probably having sex with a million guys.
because you know she's a slut.
the baby could be anybody's. It could be that guy's.
Hey, did you sleep with Charlie? You might be having a baby.
Betty, Henry needs to know the truth.
well, not from me.
I'm not breaking apart a family.
I've got enough drama in my life.
my dad is stuck in Mexico.
he can't come home.
that's more than I can deal with right now.
okay, we're here.
what? What do you mean, we're here? - Oh, didn't I tell you?
we're breaking into Wilhelmina's apartment.
what?
now you need sunscreen.
Hey.
Betty's son. - Nephew.
so I'm sorry about your... mother?
father. - Yes, yes.
we sign so many cards here.
so what are you doing at Mode?
you and your little band of ruffians picking pockets?
my aunt Betty got me a summer internship.
get that for me this could be fun.
do you need anything done?
Betty has me sharpening pencils.
I mean, I love her, but yawn.
Yeah, how do you live with that?
let's see.
Wilhelmina needs her contacts updated.
any interest?
this is Wilhelmina's?
good afternoon. I'm looking for Amanda Tanen.
I'm from Richman, Brett and Jacobs.
the lawyers? What do I get? Am I rich?
I take it you're Amanda Tanen.
Oh, my god. Do I get this watch?
that is mine.
please sign this. - What about the cigarette case?
please stop touching my things.
so it appears Miss Sommers' town house, wardrobe and automobiles were auctioned off at the time of her death, and the proceeds were given to charity.
you mean it's all gone?
not everything.
this is for you.
what is that?
it's your mother's beloved dog Halston.
nice try, slick, but you're not sticking me with this gremlin.
did I happen to mention there's a $1, 000-a-week allowance for whoever agrees to care for him?
Oh, yes.
who's the little baby?
so you told Alexis about your mother and Fey?
look, she found out about mom on TV, but I am not gonna be the one to tell Alexis you divorced mom to marry Wilhelmina, or that you rejected your own child because she became a woman.
I have no problem telling Alexis the truth.
then great.
her room's right down there.
I can't believe we're actually in Lucifer's chamber...
Beelzebub's lair...
the devil's rumpus room.
Ooh, look. A photograph of Wilhelmina with Dick Cheney.
Christina, please stop enjoying yourself and help.
we've got to get the book and get out of here.
the bedroom.
Satan's boudoir. Vampira's... - Stop it.
10 bucks says there's a coat in there made out of Dalmatian puppies.
here it is. I got it. Here it is.
who is that?
Wilhelmina's supposed to be at lunch with Nora Ephron.
that's not Nora Ephron.
that's a man.
it's Mr. Meade. They're here for a quickie, an afternoon delight.
afternoon de...- that's what that means?
I never understood that song till just now.
okay, um, under the bed.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm so happy to get out of that office.
this is just so decadent.
everyone at the office thinks I'm having lunch with the great Nora Ephron.
little do they know, Nora's been covering my daytime romps for years.
you seem a little tense.
how about a back rub?
that's not Mr. Meade.
can I be on top this time?
don't be stupid.
two hours.
I have to pee well, that was relaxing.
I do love an afternoon delight.
is that what that song means?
come, Dwayne. I think I need some protecting in the shower.
Oh, come on. That was a strike, you idiot!
not interrupting, am I?
just another blown save.
Yeah, we could still use a good closer.
I see there's some of Alex still in there.
what was that?
I need to talk to you.
what's up, dad?
you haven't called me that in years.
well, I- I was a little headstrong when I was Alex.
maybe Alexis can have a softer touch.
maybe I can, too.
okay, Wilhelmina's contacts are completely reorganized.
also, I inventoried all the gowns that she wore on the red carpet last year and booked her travel to Paris for this season's couture shows.
and what took you so long?
I did it in under an hour.
an hour?
you want to know what I've been doing?
pricing Weimaraners, getting a plumber for the house in Bedford, sending Warren Beatty a 60th...
RIGHT--BIRTHDAY card, telling David Sedaris his 5, 000-word pieces now a 50-word piece, getting yelled at by David Sedaris and asking Chris Rockto write a 10-minute toast that Wilhelminais giving to Patty Hearst to mark the 33rd anniversary of her kidnapping.
and that is all in the last five minutes.
Yeah, that's how this lady rolls. Hang on.
Wilhelmina Slater's office.
Oh, my God.
it's coming up now?
the contract rider for Shakira's photo shoot is arriving as we speak.
in it is a list of everything she needs for her dressing room.
ambitious suck-ups!
I mean... interns!
write this down. Everything.
I'm doing okay, papi.
I just- I miss him so much.
I know, mija, but it'll get better.
one day you're gonna wake up and actually forget to feel sad.
Yeah.
at least I have his things.
what things?
I went and I cleaned out his apartment.
a lot of his stuff looks really good in our place.
Really?
I don't remember Santos having such good taste.
you're crazy. He had such an eye.
you're gonna love it.
sweetheart, um, I know everything holds a memory for you now, but are you sure you're not getting a little carried away?
when your mother died, I couldn't let go of any of her things
her clothes, her key chain.
I even found an old restaurant check from Pietro's in bayside.
it was rom the night we got engaged.
your mother had saved it all those years, and when I saw it, I...
I realized I didn't need all her things.
I had her heart.
so I kept the check...
and got rid of everything else.
but where is it? I've never seen it.
I'm looking at it right now.
I really miss you, papi.
miss you, too.
sorry I'm late, mama. I'll get the enchiladas started.
Mirta's not here.
thank God. Enough with the beans and cheese.
you wanna order Chinese?
beans, Chinese?
are you okay?
I was just talking to Hilda.
you get like this every time you call.
your visa will come through. You'll be home soon.
I'm so tired of hearing that!
I don't want to wait any longer, Clara!
my daughter buried the love of her life, and I couldn't be there to hold her.
maybe I should just get there on my own.
what are you talking about? - Forget the visa.
I'll just get across the border another way.
I've done it before.
are you serious?
I have no other choice.
treat me like a criminal, I'll be one.
I wanna go home.
well, then...
if you think this is the only way, I might know someone who can help you.
Dwayne, please hurry.
I smell a burrito.
this is embarrassing.
A. J.You were assigned number six on Shakira's rider.
read that to me.
one box of bendy straws?
bendy straws!
now let's take a look at what you brought back.
okay, so I'm Shakira, and I would like to take a drink, so I take a straw, and I put it in my cup.
a- oh, but what's this?
it doesn't bend?
I don't understand. How am I supposed to drink?
like- like this?
this isn't comfortable. I can't drink like this.
am I some kind of animal? No.
SHAKIRA!
and I will not be holding my drink down around my chin like some savage if I'm thirsty!
now this straw debacle is just the tip of the iceberg.
only one of you- one- got his list correct.
the rest of you can leave.
Justin, you are in charge of everything.
awesome.
go.
I have a task for you.
I need dirt on Betty Suarez.
I'm hearing you loud and clear, Wilhe- Meister.
okay, chocolate almond milk.
I think that there's a health store on 59th.
there's plenty of time for that.
I was just thinking, we don't know anything about our families.
you go first.
I'm looking for a package for Alexis.
ironic, as I say that out loud.
what is that smell?
I think it's that dog.
it is not that dog.
it smells like ass.
Yeah, and when you're 84, you're gonna smell like ass, too.
leave Halston alone.
he was a gift to me from my mother.
I get $1, 000 a week to take care of him, which means $5 for dog food, and the new Balenciaga bag for me.
is he supposed to tip over like that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, there you are!
is Daniel in his office?
I don't know where Daniel is. I have to go to the vet!
hang on, Halston. Don't quit on me.
well, if he wasn't at the hospital, then where could he be?
Justin, are you doing okay?
can't talk. Looking for gua juice.
why do you care so much if Wilhelmina's boinking the bodyguard?
because Daniel is looking for something to incriminate Wilhelmina, and he could use this...
good, you're back. Wilhelmina wants to see you.
Oh, um, okay, yeah, great.
I just have some things that I need to finish up, and I'll stop by her office on the way out.
no, you won't.
she's waiting for you right now...
on the roof.
the roof?
the roof.
Hello?
I believe you lost something.
thank you, Marc. You can go now.
you surprise me, Betty.
stealing my keys?
breaking into my apartment? Taking the book?
good for you. You're...growing.
look, I was just there for the book.
I didn't mean to hear anybody having sex.
look, Dwayne and I are dear old friends.
that had nothing to do with Bradford.
whom you love, right?
because you're getting married in a month.
whom I love madly.
do we understand each other?
Wilhelmina, I'm sure you understand that my loyalties are with Daniel, so thank you very much for inviting me.
it was very wonderful to see the roof. Thank you.
pity about your father.
what about my father?
Oh, I know that he's stuck in Mexico. Shame.
my fatheris a United States senator.
he helps people get their visas all the time.
so what are you saying?
come on, girl. I am Black. You're Mexican.
let's not talk around it like a couple of dull White people.
keep your mouth shut and your old man comes home.
so lie to Daniel?
not lie, just don't say anything.
there's a difference.
you think about it, Betty, and get back to me by the end of the day.
no pressure.
after all, you're the one who's holding all the cards.
Hey, Betty.
what's up, buddy?
Hey.
still not very good at that.
Hey, I talked to dad!
Oh, uh, you okay?
okay? I'm great!
it's just wonderful to know I have such a supportive family at a time like this.
supportive?
he's totally supportive about me becoming this... with these.
will you stop grabbing them for a second?
dad... said he was okay with all this?
what else did he tell you?
and I got the seedless grapes, a tub of red vines.
the only thing I couldn't find was the scully foods 100% organic, all-natural soy rice cakes.
Ah, the rice cake- the scourge of manya celebrity assistant.
need I mention the '88 Madonna Speed the plow tantrum?
don't sweat it.
you still have 12 more hours before you need to bring them to the Shakira shoot.
my... God.
I am going to the Shakira photo shoot? - Yep.
are you serious?
these lips don't lie.
this is amazing!
I cannot wait to tell my...
you okay?
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Justin.
it's okay.
I know you've been through a lot with your dad and everything, but...
it's okay to be happy.
you did a good job today.
enjoy it.
Hi. - Hi.
I just made a little person feel better about his day.
I'm a good person.
no, I'm a great person.
does your rat have a strong smell?
HALSTON is sick, okay?
I just talked to the vet. He needs ointments and patches and pills.
Oh, my.
suddenly I am a caregiver. Me.
that is so not who I am. - This true.
you are a bit of a monster on the inside.
this is horrible.
it's almost like I'd be better off getting rid of him.
how could you?
damn it.
how could you lie to Alexis like that?
did I?
I don't remember what I said.
well, let's start with how you didn't tell her you'd reject her if she got a sex change.
I think your exact words were, you'd be dead to me.
and you didn't even tell her about Wilhelmina.
you're getting married in a month, dad.
you're right, Daniel.
I didn't.
I saw Alexis lying in that bed and realized I almost lost my child...again.
this is a chance for us to start a whole new relationship.
no way.
you are not screwing with her head like this.
if you're not gonna tell her the truth, I am.
you don't know what it's like to have a chance to rewrite the past.
I need to fix the mistakes I made.
mija?
dad?
you all right?
dad, help me!
I don't know what to do.
Yeah, it's a tough decision.
let me tell you what to do.
keep your mouth shut and get my ass home from Mexico.
but Daniel's my boss.
Oh, yeah?
well, did your boss bring you home in a little blankie from the hospital?
did your boss teach you how to swim?
did your boss pull you off the tracks seconds before a subway car was about to crush you?
I didn't know you did that.
I didn't, but I was worried the first two things weren't impressive enough.
family, Betty.
what's more important than family?
I know, papi, I know.
it's just...
it's so wrong, and we should just trust the system, right?
I mean, you'll get your visa on your own.
and isn't it more important for me to tell the truth. I hate it that I raised you right.
Ooh, those smell good.
can I have some?
you're helping Daniel.
get Daniel to make you enchiladas!
Hey, Christina, I was wondering...
did you know if, for some reason, Betty might be mad at me?
I don't know. I mean, what do you think?
I mean, you did lead her on, then race off to Tucson, then after a few weeks, once she was starting to feel a little bit better, suddenly pop back into her life again.
I'm sorry. I didn't understand you.
Oh, Henry.
she's not mad, she's just a little bit confused.
well, I'm confused, too.
I mean, I know I have this obligation to Charlie and I can't wait to be a dad, but...
I just...
I really miss what Betty and I had.
Henry, she's making an umpty out of you.
an umpty? - Jackass.
how?
mm, Henry...
come here.
let me tell you something about this baby of yours, because somebody's got to.
okay, Halston, this is your new home!
isn't it pretty?
it's so pretty.
so pretty.
can I help you?
Hi, I'm looking for a nice new home for my sweet little doggy.
Yeah, we'll take it.
sign this form.
so is there, like, a big grassy area in the back where the doggies can run around?
sure, with peanut butter flavored tennis balls and a pool shaped like a dog bone.
Really?
no.
Hey, uh, can I at least say good-bye?
okay, Halston, I'm sure someone will adopt you.
I don't know. That is one ugly dog.
pot, kettle, black.
do you mind?
this dog belonged to my mother.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
does your mother know you're doing this?
because I'm not going down that road again.
my mother is gone, and this was her dog.
and she once held him just like I am holding him now.
you know more about her than I will ever know.
and so what if you're mangy and disgusting with a weird rash on your butt?
or maybe that is your butt?
but you're the only connection I'll ever have to my mother.
back off, cujo.
I'm taking him home.
hungry?
I brought you barrow street burgers.
you may not remember, but you always liked it.
Hey, I'm not picky.
up till yesterday I was eating out of a tube.
these are good.
so, um...
I kinda wanted to talk to you about...dad.
you know, I've been think a lot about him today, and you.
waking up in this bed, thinking I was Alex, I felt alone.
but, you know, the thing that made it okay was knowing that you and dad are really there for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, we were...here for you.
so listen, I haven't asked you yet.
how did we even get into this accident?
Um...well...
Oh, God, Daniel, what are you not telling me?
was it my fault? - No!
was I drunk? - No, no, no, no, you- you were fine.
uh, it was just, uh...
a deer.
it- it leapt out in front of the car, you swerved...
and that was it.
well, at least I saved a deer.
dad!
So...how are we?
we're great.
I was just telling Daniel I feel so lucky to have you two as my family.
whenever, wherever rice cakes!
all right, uh...
anything else?
Nope. That's it.
Justin Suarez, right?
Yeah. How'd you know?
I was at your father's funeral.
you know, he saved my life, right here in this store.
your father was a hero.
I didn't know this was where...
that's all right.
you should know, he was a really good man.
I bet you're just like him.
No...I'm not.
Thanks, Betty.
Daniel, wait.
I need to tell you something.
Oh, um...it's my dad.
can I talk to you in a minute?
Yeah.
Hello? - Betty?
dad? - I'm coming home.
what?
did your visa come through?
no.
I can't wait anymore.
this could take months, a year.
what are you saying?
dad, no.
if you get caught, they're not gonna let you back in, and you know how they pack those trucks with people.
you could die.
it's my life, Betty.
this is my decision.
no, these are our lives, dad-- yours and mine and Hilda's and Justin.
mija, I've made up my mind.
I leave tomorrow night.
dad, please, just don't do anything yet.
I know how to get you home.
let me talk to the lawyer one last time.
you do like to cut it close.
Oh, and the pictures that Santos took of himself at the gym do not need to be framed.
okay, so I'm keeping one thing.
you should keep something, too.
just look through hall the stuff and find something that you really love, okay?
okay. - Okay.
okay
look, I never signed off on Brigitte Lacombe.
I thought we agreed if we couldn't get Mario Testino, we wouldn't do the spread.
I still like the David Lachappelle Chateau Marmont photos we couldn't run last month.
you're right.
you're back, and you are editor-in-chief.
I made a mistake.
is that all?
uh, yes...
that is all.
Oh, Betty, I heard your father's coming back on Thursday.
please give him my regards.
that went so much better than I expected.
Betty, I can't thank you enough.
if you hadn't gotten the book, she would've done exactly what she wanted.
Oh, I'm just doing my job, Daniel.
no, I mean, when everything's on the line, you're the one person here I can truly trust.
Yeah.
sweetheart?
I just got off the phone with Cavalli's people.
he is designing you a charcoal gray, single button tuxedo for the wedding.
and he's flying himself in for the fitting.
listen, darling, with Alexis still in the hospital,
I'm not sure a gianparty would be appropriate right now.
well, you want me to cut down the size of the wedding?
I want to postpone the wedding.
because of Alexis?
I spent the afternoon with her.
we're starting to bond again.
well...
isn't that, uh, wonderful?
I hope you understand.
Alexis is still coming to terms with the fact that her mother and I are no longer together.
I'm afraid it might be a bit much for her to hear that I'm marrying someone else.
you haven't even told her about me?
I will, when she's ready.
you still love me?
always.
uh, if you'll excuse me, I have to go call Cavalli and have him postpone his trip.
are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
papi just called! He got his visa!
he's gonna be home on Thursday!
Wow! Cool.
that's- I'm so happy.
yeah? Well, tell your face.
come on!
we gotta plan a big party!
I knew it was gonna work out.
Oh, I just knew it!
so you got rid of Santos' things?
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
but you're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
I like it.
strike.
I gotta go plan the menu.
Ooh, do you think it's wrong if we ask papi to cook?
hello. - Ignacio Suarez?
Yes, can I help you?
you just did.
Hello?
who is it?
it's me.
Christina told me about Charlie, that she cheated on me.
the baby might not be mine.
Oh, God, Henry.
you've been drinking.
Yes, I have.
but...
I drank milk first to...
coat my stomach.
Charlie was the only reason we couldn't be together.
and she's not a reason anymore.
I wanna be with you, Betty.
well.
and your bodyguard having sex.
keep your mouth shut and your old man comes home.
so lie to Daniel? - Don't lie. Just don't say anything.
I'm your husband." Bloody hell."
this is my friend.
my friend? - I don't think he's your friend.
I'm his boyfriend. Or should I say "was"?
cliff, I really screwed up.
I have hundreds of backstabbing, two-faced, superficial friends that are pouring in from all over the globe to be part of this wedding.
any of them would be thrilled to be my maid of honor.
you only have five months left with Henry.
go. The clock is ticking.
maybe we shouldn't tell dad.
I'm romantic, not crazy.
it was on and off faster than Lindsay's alcohol detection bracelet, but love has triumphed asilhelmina slater marries publishing magnate bradford meade this saturday...
Hey, shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
it's the countdown to the brad-elmina wedding.
it's a national holiday.
I don't even think there's mail today.
okay.
Betty, breakfast is ready.
I know you haven't had much of an appetite since this whole mess with henry, but I made blueberry pancakes.
no, thanks.
okay, but if you change your mind...
breakfast is ready. - Oh, good.
I love blueberry pancakes.
how'd you know I was making blueberry pancakes?
because you just said so.
somebody's getting old.
canadian bacon.
are you having a stroke?
that's theatnly thing that got betty's appetite baet after Joey Lawrence was kicked off that "dancing with the stars."
maybe that'll do the trick.
I gotta get a life.
mija?
okay, what would you say if I told you I was making your favorite?
canadian - B... Betty? - Aah.
dad.
Hilda. - Oh, man. Was I sleepwalking?
no, they were supposed to be dyed aspensummitwhite.
these are clearly picket fence white, thus destroying...The entire wilhelmina slater wedding palette!
Yeah, well, you better fix it by tomorrow, or I swear, as god as my witness, you'll be selling shoelaces on the subway!
you are so hot when you go into head voice.
I'm on my last nerve.
here, take these.
the bakery hasn't finished the cake, I still have to finalize the seating chart, and wilhelmina said if there's baby's breath in any of the floral arrangements, she's gonna sand off my nipples.
wow, cake and nipples.
I don't know which one to focus on.
okay, I'm on my way to graphics.
by the way, you don't happen to know where my brown blazer is?
Why?
I'm wearing it to the wedding.
that corduroy thing that's held together by cat hair and ketchup stains?
cliff, this wedding is so fancy, Armani is wearing Prada.
come on, I mean, do you really think that they're gonna be looking at me?
you have Rosie O'donnell seated at the same table as elisabeth hasselbeck.
what? Oh, my god! How did that happen?
okay, I've got too much to do today.
if you want to wear that jacket, go ahead.
seriously, you'd be okay with it?
Yeah, it's who you are, and the sooner I accept that you're a messy bessy, the better off we'll be.
thank you.
and I've told you, I prefer sloppy sally.
Congratulations. - Congratulations to you
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize we were getting drunk first thing in the morning.
little tribute to mom? - We're celebrating.
I just got off the phone with ad sales. They are very happy.
Oh, I didn't realize you'd heard.
heard? Look at these contracts...
Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Ralph Lauren...
your sister scored big.
it looks like she might have saved the magazine.
Yeah, um, did you see the contract I landed for us?
winthrop jewelry. That was mine. - Yeah, here it is.
they've taken an 1/8th of a page in March.
an 1/8th of a page? No... - Hey, that's great.
an advertiser's an advertiser, right, dad?
Yes, every little bit helps.
you know, Alexis, your dedication pleases me more than you'll ever know.
I realize that you have loyalty to your mother, but would you consider standing up with me at my wedding tomorrow?
Really? - Wait a second. I thought I was your best man.
who threw your bachelor party last weekend at scores, Mr."I need more singles?"
Ah, Cheyenne.
is she still there?
Oh, she was my favorite.
does she still do that thing? - Oh, yeah.
that's not free, by the way. You know what? Forget this.
you want to make Alexis your best man? Fine, do it.
well, why don't you both do it together?
you know what, dad? Maybe it's better if just Daniel stands up.
I... - No, no, no, no. Don't worry about me.
he obviously wants you around.
you really shouldn't disappoint dad.
it might kill him.
and you wouldn't want that, would you, Alexis?
coverage of the Wilhelmina Slater wedding continues with superstar maid of honor Victoria Beckham...
all right with the posing and the waving.
we all know you're strong enough to raise your arm.
She'smymaid of honor.
this is supposed to be about me.
Pish-tosh, it's Posh.
the Beckhams have conquered America.
accept it. They're our leaders.
so, Vctoria, how long have you and Wilhelmina known each other?
Oh, Willie and I go way back.
she's practically my second mom.
what? - Mum. It's a flower.
she thinks of you as a second flower.
it's a British expression.
what are you getting the happy couple for a wedding present?
Oh, something very special.
a gift from the heart.
a year's supply of beckham 24/7, our new energy drink, available at fine stores everywhere.
it's Beck-Mmm.
is she hawking her sports drink in the middle of my wedding interview?
okay, you're focusing on this way too much.
let's not forget that you're only getting married so you can take over meade and launch your own fashion magazine.
even that's off track.
I can't start my own magazine until we bring down "mode."
apparently the dynamic duo, Danny and the tranny, have gone and found some advertisers to save this rag.
Please."Mode" is far from being out of the woods, and once you take over the whole company, this magazine will go down faster than a crack whore at a prison rodeo.
I don't know what the means, but it sounds nasty.
Oh, it's nasty, Miss Jackson.
does anyone look as fabulous as posh feeding ducks in central park?
Incre . okay, I'm leaving to work now.
are you still not talking to me?
what more is there to say?
you've been sneaking out, seeing a boy who got another girl pregnant, who's moving across the country in a few months, and you're foolish enough to think this is some big romance.
Justin, go watch upstairs.
you see, dad? This is exactly why I didn't tell you. - Mom!
look, I love Henry, okay?
I've never felt this way before.
do you hear yourself?
you're talking like some silly 13-year-old girl.
use your head, Betty.
he's going to leave, and you're gonna have your heart broken.
well, that's my... - Can we just calm down, please, and discuss this?
don't think I've forgotten that you knew about this the whole time and were covering for her!
okay, I think the important thing here is that we focus on betty.
you want me to focus on Betty? I'll focus on Betty.
you're not seeing Henry again.
dad, I'm 23 years old. You can't tell me who I can see.
I can if you're living in this house!
then maybe I shouldn't be living in this house. - Betty.
Hey, there's the door! - Fine!
papi!
why is everyone in this family so freakin dramatic?
and today mayor bloomberg gave posh the key to the city...
where does he get off calling me a silly girl?
well, he says things.
Justin, go watch downstairs.
who does he think has been holding this family together since mom died?
he just scared for you. He thinks you're doing something that's a little bit crazy.
well, you know what, Hilda?
my entire life, I've been the sensible one.
I never even thought that I would ever get a chance at real love.
this might be it for me.
don't I deserve to do something a little crazy just once?
after Posh rang the opening bell, the dow soared to new heights...
ay, betty, please. Do you have to do this now?
it's his citizenship ceremony on saturday.
Yeah, thanks to me.
Betty, wait.
Justin... - You know what?
if there was ever an argument for me to have my own TV, this would be it.
what do you mean,"thanks to you"?
how do you think dad even got his visa?
the lawyers? - No.
the I. N.S?No.
it was me.
Wilhelmina's father is a senator, and let's just say, I totally betrayed daniel to get her to call in a favor and get dad home.
you did that? - And don't you dare tell him.
I don't want him knowing I did anything for him.
look at this "Classy, such as Donna Karan," Heidi Klum and Candice Bergen will be attending the Slater-Meade wedding.
I'm not even mentioned.
I'm Fey Sommers' daughter.
I'm as classy as they are.
I've got class coming out the pooper.
that you do, Miiady.
and you are supposed to be my P.R.Bitch.
my 15 minutes are almost up, Marc, and we've done nothing about them.
we talked about an amanda doll, maybe a singing career, rehab...
I know these are big dreams, but we've at least got to try.
Marc! My office! Now!
let me just get my oldest married off first, and then it is all about you.
uh, pinkie swear.
well, it better be, or I will twist off your nipples with a wrench.
why the sudden interest in my boys?
excuse me, love.
can you help a bloke out that's down to his last floggen?
Oh, my god. You talk just like someone I know.
wait, who is that?
don't tell me.
don't tell me...
well, wankle me bum.
I know, right?
and then he tells me that I'm not allowed to see Henry as long as I'm living under his roof.
so I said, "fine."
I won't live under your roof.
Oh, oh, crap! - You're telling me.
so I was thinking, do you think I could crash on your couch... - No, no, quick, this way.
what? Where are you taking me?
on you go. In. Quick, quick.
what...what is... never mind.
Hello?
Oh, my goodness, what is this place?
it's a sex room.
fey sommers had it built for her secret trysts.
get out of here.
Shh.
I don't want him to hear us. - Who?
my husband. - What husband?
the one I ran away from in scotland. He's outside.
you have a secret husband and a secret sex room?
Oh, my god. You just, like, totally trumped my whole dad thing.
I haven't seen stuart for fiva years, not since I told him I was going to the pet store to get dog food and I just...
kept going. - And you have a dog?
I don't even know you.
what do you think what he want - I don't know.
maybe he can't find the remote control.
well, you can't just hide in here, Christina. He tracked you down.
aren't you the least bit curious?
all right, everybody, let's give it up.
here comes the bride in a vera wang original.
I don't do that. - Oh, booty bop?
Wilhelmina get out here.
be still, my flaming heart.
damn, I'm good.
now, Vera, I'm not sure about this train.
now I was thinking... - This is major.
Oh, my god, it's perfect spice.
I have a new muse.
Hello?
anybody?
bride over here. - You really think it's okay?
Marc. - It's sbeyond "okay," I'm giving y a booty bop.
I'm sorry, Willie, but look at her in that dress.
she made me feel tingly where no girl has ever made me feel tingly.
Vicki, darling, I have a thought...
no, not Posh. Don't hurt her.
you know what, Vera?
I think we're gonna go in another direction, so you can leave now.
you're not serious? - You're right.
Marc, get her some flats.
goin' on a trip?
my father found out about Henry and me.
things got messy, so I moved out.
and I know you said from the beginning that it was a mistake, but I would really appreciate it if you didn't say,"I told you so."
Betty, who am I to be giving you advice on relationships?
have you taken a look at my family lately? - Don't even talk about family.
busting my ass for the last year to try to make...This magazine work. - I mean, I know that he's trying to protect me...
does he even once say, "nice job"? - But he can't just shelter me from the rest of the world.
he'll always see me as this little chubby girl... - I'll always be the irresponsible playboy - Who's gonna get asthma she runs too fast. - who blew through his trust fund in a year.
you know what, I don't care. - A joke is I still care what did he think.
I'm not going. - I'm not going.
what? - What?
I'm not going to his wedding.
I'm not going to his citizenship ceremony.
thank you for listening. - You, too.
Betty. - Hi.
Hilda called.
she told me what happened.
you're not staying with Christina.
you're staying with me.
it's been a long time, christina.
Oh, and no rush hurrying back with that dog food, by the way.
biscuit died three years ago.
what do you want, Stuart?
I want to say I'm sorry.
I know I wasn't a very good husband, Christina.
and you taking off like that was...
well, it was the kick I needed to get myself some help.
but part of me getting better is making amends to those I hurt, so here I am.
Yeah, I'm sorry I ran out on you.
I guess it was just easier to secretly put money aside for two years, hide in a neighbor's barn, then wait at the airport for four days for a standby ticket to new yor than it was to speak to my husband.
I hear that.
so do you think we can ever be friends again?
after we get you unpacked, we can go get some chinese food.
there's this really great... Betty?
come in.
you've been in my apartment before.
Oh, here's your key. - Oh, uh, I don't need a key.
you have to have a key.
but does this mean...I mean... I mean, what does it mean?
it means you can open the door.
Oh, and here...
and this empty drawer means you can unpack.
and that glass over there means you have a glass of water.
okay, uh, great.
uh, yeah, cool. Great.
why are you being so weird? - I don't know, It just... this feels different.
I think it feels nice.
and, you know, the good part all this stuff going on with your family is we don't have to hide anymore.
we can be a real couple.
Yeah, we can plan things. - Yeah, like Christmas.
Oh, where do you put the christmas tree?
right here.
there? - Yeah.
Really? Wouldn't it be so much better over here on this wall?
Yeah, but the radiator's over there.
over here, it's in the window. Everyone can see it.
but it blocks the window. If it was here...
Yeah, you know what? Forget Christmas. Valentine's day.
Oh, why don't we go back to that sushi restaurant where we had our first date?
it's a pinkberry now. - Oh, even better. I hate sushi.
Oh, um, this could be really fun... I heard Hall Oates are gonna be in town...
in april.
what?
uh, April. - Uh, oh.
Oh, god. Uh, that's right.
that was stupid. Forget I said it. Erase awkward moment.
um, no, I totally knew that you'd be back in Tucson by then. I just...
I'm just gonna go and unpack my toothbrush and my stuff in the bathroom.
um, I'll be right back.
Betty, that's the closet.
Oh, yeah, I know. I just, uh, need a minute.
you know, it's bad luck to see the bride on her wedding day.
not for the bodyguard.
so you think you might need some
mm, Dwayne, sweet, horny Hwayne...
beat it.
mama's weave can't get sweaty on her big day.
can I at least take a shower?
don't use the good shampoo.
this is room 1220.
I'd like my breakfast, please. - Yes, Ms. Slater.
last night victoria beckham set gotham ablaze.
posh wore her maid of honor gown for a night on, the town.
once again, Vicki B. has stolen the spotlight from wilhelmina, begging the question, whe big day is it?
okay, do I wear the flag tie, the flag pin or both?
if you wear a flag tie, I'm leaving the country.
pin it is.
unbelievable.
one of the biggest days of my life, and she doesn't even call.
ay, papi. You know Betty loves you.
she doesn't act like it.
she lied and disrespected me, and all I wanted to do was to protect her.
all she's thinking about is herself. - Okay,
listen, you have no idea what betty's done for you.
Hilda, what are you talking about?
I love that you've got a sex room.
you've really made it.
well, technically, it's not really mine, but it was convenient, wasn't it?
so was it, um, as good as you remember?
well, you didn't pass out drunk midway through, so I suppose it was a mild improvement.
I missed you, Christina.
didn't think I'd missed you.
but you did?
a wee bit.
I'm gonna use the loo.
do you know what - what?
I'd forgotten about good stuart.
Oh, good stuart was always there. He was just...
a little lost and a lot pissed.
well, just you remember...
good Suart remembers to put the toilet seat down when he's finished.
right.
bad, bad Stuart.
Oh, you're awake.
good morning.
I was gonna sneak out and brush my teeth before you woke up.
what? No, don't be silly.
you should be comfortable with who you are.
so listen, I am never in manhattan on a saturday.
and there's that brunch place on bank street that has the cute little baby ducks on the awning, and I have no idea what they serve, but the ducks are cute.
Betty, they serve baby duck. - What?
you're so easy.
shut up. So I was thinking... - Yeah.
after breakfast, you and I could go on a little adventure.
Ta-da. - New york transit museum?
well, I know what a fan you are of the subway system, and there was that faky third rail experience you had.
well, my glasses were foggy, but I do think I saw my nana down there.
Yeah, probably.
anyway, I thought it would be fun.
Yeah. - What?
what...What... What's with the face? You don't wanna go?
no, no, who wouldn't? It's just...
don't you think you should go to your dad's citizenship ceremony?
no. Henry, no.
I-I made a decision, and today is about us, and I wanna do something crazy and fun.
new York transit museum it is.
and we'll be back with a ticker tape parade...
in honor of Victoria Beckham.
Oh, I thought you were room service.
I want to talk to my father.
Bradford's suite is on the tenth floor.
separate rooms the night before the wedding.
you know what an old-fashioned girl I am.
that must be what he sees in you.
I want you to give these to him. I won't be attending the wedding.
Oh, what a shame.
I guess I'll have to do our mother-son dance with Aexis.
who is that?
spice girl can't handle spicy foods. Go figure.
I'll make sure Badford gets these. Bye.
later, Willie.
come on, I-I know I have that coupon for the transit museum somewhere in my desk.
you know, I really don't mind paying the extra 10 bucks.
I know, but you get this free subway map shower curtain with it, and Hilda could really use that because she still has trouble with the "a" line, and there's just no reason for her to end up at the bronx zoo as often as she does.
who's in wilhelmina's office?
Oh, Betty Henry, hi.
booze and pills weren't enough?
I see you've graduated.
I can explain... - No, don't bother.
I have had enough of your excuses.
I was so stupid to actually think... - I'm sick.
it's my liver.
all the drinking finally did me in.
that medication's just a band-aid.
so what exactly are we talking about here?
$100, 000 for an experimental treatment.
that's the reason I'm in new york.
and how are you gonna get that money?
I'm not.
good news is that in six months time, you will be inheriting my mom's spoon collection.
Oh, Suart.
I have always wanted that spoon collection...
jst not like this.
stay in new york. - Why?
I don't know how, but I'm...I'm gonna get you the money, okay?
Yeah.
and then I see her bodyguard leaving her room.
what else could it be, right?
um, yeah, I mean, that sounds suspicious.
did you hear anyone say anything at all?
do you know if... - no, no I don't.
I don't know anything.
but, Daniel, if...if you think that this is true, then you should go to your father and tell him before he marries that woman.
he knows how I feel about Wilhelmina.
I can't go to him without any proof.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Ah, don't worry about it, Betty.
it's not your problem.
although, I think I am gonna go to his wedding.
maybe I can get something out of the bodyguard. - Good idea. Yeah.
because that guy seems like a big dummy.
the other day he said something was a mute point.
that was me.
Moot,"mute..." I get it now.
Oh...Well, he's dumb, too.
I'm not making this better.
Hi, I'm Amanda Sommers.
I'm Fey Sommers' daughter.
Oh, Hi there. Hello.
I'm Amanda Sommers.
I am Fey Sommers' daughter.
Oh, hi.
being a celebrity is so hard.
everyone just want a piece of you.
Yeah, how about that? Hey, have you seen Cliff yet?
don't worry.
your wide load lover will be here any minute.
Amanda, no jokes. I'm freaking out.
I'm debuting him today as my boyfriend, and I have no idea what's gonna walk though that door.
sweetie, relax.
he can't fit through those doors. - Stop it.
Trans-Fatty...
more than meets the eye.
Aw, look at my boyfriend.
who knew there were hardwood floors under that shag rug?
hardwood floors!
that's my boyfriend. That's my boyfriend.
hardwood floors.
Hey. - So...
what do you think? - I can't believe you did this.
I knew what a big deal it was to you, meeting your friends.
I didn't want to be a jerk.
so how does it feel?
I'm sweating, my collar's too tight...and these shoes really hurt.
Auty is pain, Cliff...
and you are hurting me bad.
Betty, we can go to the transit museum another time.
today you're going to your faer's citizenship ceremony.
I already told you that I didn't want to be anywhere near here, Henry. Why would you do this?
because you're pretending you can live without your family, Betty, but it's just an act.
I' seen you guys together. You're like this...
and when I leave, they're gonna be the ones who are here for you.
rich old guy. Hot!
EW!
okay, this is weird, but has cliff been talking to that guy for kind oa long time?
is he sucking on that lamb chop a little...
Seductively?
seductively or disgustingly?
Hey. Hi. Come here.
Oh, he did not just give me the "one minute" finger.
Ooh, denied.
I hereby declare an oath that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen...
Gwyneth's wearing white to the wedding?
that is such a bitch slap.
that will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
hello. - Oh, hey, Marc, This is tony.
don't care.
that was rude.
so is tramping it up with that "hot ten years ago" cater waiter with clearly waxed eyebrows.
I knew they were waxed.
he swears that he was born with the perfect joan crawford arch.
Oh, please, not even Joan... wait a minute. I'm angry!
about what? - Duh.
Tony's a model I've worked with. We're just friends.
Oh, please. We're gay.
there's no such thing as just friends.
he's straight. - Uh, uh, a straight model.
well, I guess the world is upside down.
what is wrong with you? You're acting like a baby.
a baby abandoned in a dumpster while mommy explores her newfound hotness. Well, I've had it.
can we... - No
this thing between us is over.
say "cheese." - Hi.
can...
so, Dawg, what's up?
it's Daniel Meade. We met.
bodyguard, huh? That's an interesting line of work.
you must get a lot of action.
big, strong, good-Looking guy like you...
you hittin' on me?
no. No, no, no. No.
no, this is about you and Wilhelmina.
I just need a few answers.
I've got a blank check for some information about...
my checkbook.
Oh, damn it.
I left it on the dresser. I could see it right there.
well, well, well.
I thought I heard a meeting of the minds.
game over, Wilhelmina.
Dwayne just told me everything about you two.
mm, nice try, Daniel.
there's nothing going on between Dwayne and I.
but for argument's sake, let's say I was enjoying the pleasure of this tall glass of chocolate milk.
I would think you'd run straight to your father, but oh, wait, you can't, and do you know why you can't?
he has no proof. - Dwayne.
I was building up to that.
but he's right. You have no proof.
I will see you at the altar.
can you believe him?
suddenly he's the hottest guy in the room, and...
I'm not good enough.
Marc, I got to be honest with you.
I do like his new suit.
but seriously, he's only 15% hotter.
Oh, really? Then why is every waiter serving him food?
why is every bartender pouring him drinks?
Oh, my god, it's happened.
you're looking past the outside and seng what's on the inside.
you're falling for him.
you're falling for an average man.
Oh, god. I am.
I'm an average-man lover.
what do I do?
you accept it. You are deeper than you think.
it's okay. We all have flaws.
but I-I broke up with him.
then you get out there, and you do something dramatic to show that fatty how much you care.
like, you run through the airport, and you bust through security, and just as the doors of t plane are closing, you scream at the top of your lungs,"cliff!"
you calling me?
or you just go over there and talk to him.
I'm sorry I said those things.
and I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about me and henry.
it's just...Dad, you're right.
I'm doing something really stupid.
and you're gonna keep doing it, right?
Yeah.
and when he leaves, I'm gonna fall apart.
and I want you to promise me you'll be here to pick me up.
I'm your father.
where else am I gonna be?
you're still crying?
Yeah, first he became a citizen, and now Betty...
just watch your TV.
so this does mean you're coming back home, right?
Yes.
Hilda told me what you did to make this happen.
Hilda sucks at secrets.
Daniel's done so much for you, Betty.
you can't betray a friend for me.
dad, if I tell daniel about wilhelmina, she'll try and do something to mess up your citizenship.
I'm an American now.
let her try.
all right, people. Let's get this over with.
I mean, let's get me married off to the most wonderful man in the whole world.
actual, Ms. Slater, there's just one problem.
your maid ...
we can't find her anywhere.
Oh, Posh flaked?
Oh, darn. Well, I guess we'll have to go ahead without her.
poor thing, I hope she's all right.
all right, people. Focus on the joy.
flowers!
Hello?
anybody out there?
I think the door's locked!
this really is major.
dear friends, we are gathered here today to join in holy matrimony Wlhelmina Slater and Bradford Meade.
I object!
we haven't gotten to that part yet.
Oh.
Oh, I knew it.
I knew Wlhelmina was sleeping with her bodyguard.
when did you find out?
Daniel, it's not really important.
just go in there and talk to your father and stop the wedding!
no, no, no, I need more details. I mean, you're my only proof.
so did you find out on your own? Did someone tell you?
I saw them. - Wait, what? When?
um, four months ago when I went to wilhelmina's apartment to get the book.
four months ago and you waited till now to tell me?
no, Daniel, it's not what it sounds like. It's very complicated...
no. It's not complicated.
Betty, you know I've been trying to find a way to open my father's eyes about this woman.
but she was using me... - I don't want to hear your excuses.
Betty, you're the one person I always counted on being on my side, and you betrayed me.
for Wilhelmina?
how could I ever trust you again?
Daniel, please... - Just stop.
I can't even look at you.
you're fired.
do you, Bradford Emerson Meade, take this woman, Wilhelmina...
sorry, Do you... Do you need something?
I really need to speak with you.
Yes, just as soon as he takes me as his lawfully wife.
let's go, Bradford. - Really, dad. It's important.
just give me a moment.
well, I'll just go ahead and do my part while you're gone.
I do. - Oh, no. I-I'm sorry.
it really doesn't work that way.
something.
um, ladies and gentlemen, while we wait for the ceremony to resume, perhaps a song from our own Amanda Sommers, daughter of the late, great Fey Sommers.
your 15 minutes are almost up.
QuincyJones is in the fourth row. Now sing, bitch.
la, la, la, la, la
milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
you would say anything to try to poison this relationship, wouldn't you?
I've got to admit, I admire your tenacity.
look, I am not making this up. Betty saw them together!
Oh, really? Then how come Betty's not here telling me this?
she...she's gone.
how convenient. - You're unbelievable.
I am the only one willing to be honest with you.
will you at least consider the possibility...
I am not gonna throw away something based on some crazy accusation made by some assistant.
look at you. You're sweating, dad.
maybe.
I'm sweating because you are driving my blood pressure up by the minute.
that woman doesn't love you at all!
get out of my way.
Eything all right? - Yeah, fine. Please, continue.
do you, Bradford Emerson Meade, take this woman, Wilhelmina Vivian Slater...
as your lawful wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward in sickness and in health for richer or for poorer...
in good times and in bad...
for as long as you both shall live?
Oh, my god! - Dad!
someone call 9-1-1.
come on, dad.
don't you die!
don't you dare die!
come on, dad, breathe.
two. Three. Four Five. Come on, dad. Come on, dad.
I got it. Here it is.
who is that? You surprise me, Betty.
breaking into my apartment? I was just there for the book.
I didn't mean to hear anybody having sex. Dwayne and I are dear old friends.
that had nothing to do with Bradford.
keep your mouth shut and your old man comes home.
so lie to Daniel? Not lie, just don't say anything.
look, they're a family. Let's go to italy.
I object!
Edyou wait till now to tell me? You're fired.
that woman doesn't love you. Get out of my way.
from this day
dad!
someone call 9-1-1.
don't you dare die!
this is SuzukI st. Pierre with more Meade madness.
while there's no actual news to report on the condition
of publishing tycoon Bradford Meade
there's plenty of gossip and innuendo
and that's good enough for me.
Oh, my god, Alexis.
how are you? How--how's your dad?
he's, uh... He's still unconscious.
it was a massive heart attack.
Alexis, the doctor wants to talk to us.
Hey, thanks for coming.
of course, Daniel, i
it means a lot to me to have you here. Of course.
come on.
I don't think he saw you.
no, he saw me.
he hates me.
I really am fired.
what are you gonna do now?
clean out my desk.
um, hello?
Oh, hey.
I know you. Betty Suarez.
I'm L'amanda. Weekend security.
Mm-hmm.
that's funny, cse, uh, the girl who normally sits here,
her name is A-Manda. Well, I'm better.
so, uh, I see you the girl
that's Henry Grubstick.
you know, he sometime come in here on saturday
Yeah, I mean, I guess he's kinda my boyfriend.
he sure is sweet. I call him sugarstick.
like to lick some of that. You ever try?
um, well, we kiss...
and other things.
wow, uh, it's quiet here on the weekends.
just like I like it. Why are you in here?
Oh, I'm cleaning out my desk.
I got fired.
rough. Sugarstick know?
no, actually, I haven't told him.
Oh, well, I may have a shot.
men like a woman with a job.
okay, I'm, uh, gonna...
well, take care of your business, sister.
you've had a rough year at this place, too.
Hey, that's my bunny.
Oh, my god, it's me.
you're... Me.
I... I don't understand.
are you my ghost? Am I dead?
they buried in my poncho?
no, it's my first day of work
Hey, you're me in the future.
tell me what happens. Am I running the magazine?
no. You get fired and leave in disgrace.
Yeah, right. That's funny.
Hey, i've been looking for that.
I thought Amanda took it.
I just met her. She seems kind of mean,
but maybe she just had a bad day.
no, she's mean. But I need that back.
I'm packing all my things up. Hold on.
you mean you actually got fired?
how did that happen?
I lied to Daniel, and he found out.
you lied?
I had to.
Wilhe lmina caught me breaking into her apartment
to steal the book. Who, wait.
you broke into an apartment? And stole something? Look, I was just doing my job.
Wow. What's happened to you? I mean, you've changed.
I barely even recognize you except for the braces
and god, when are we getting those off?
look, I have not changed,
and gosh, you ask a lot of questions.
well, only because I can't imagine
how you're doing the things you're doing.
we're just not that kind of girl.
look, you're a sweet kid, okay?
but you're young and naive,
and it's a lot trickier than you think.
well, I don't see. What's so tricky about it.
I mean, if it's so hard to be a good person in this place
well, then maybe it's a good thing we're leaving.
Christina, are you real?
are we done with this game then? Yeah.
I came to help you pack up your things.
I thought this might be a bit hard for you.
Christina, have I changed...
since I first started at "mode"?
well, I think it's hard not to change.
I don't know. It's this place.
it does something to you.
can you believe this is even happening?
Bradford seemed fine. No, and he's still handsome
like, a sean connery kind of way.
why is it always sadder when tragedy strikes hot people?
no, I want you to get the hell out of here!
Daniel, let's not make a scene. Intensive care is for family members,
and since you never married my father,
you're not part of the family. Stay out.
I'm sorry you all had to see that.
I caught him poking around the morphine drawer.
I swear, underneath it all, he's still a good boy.
Marc, get the car. On it.
all right, people, get out of the way.
I got a very important person here.
come on, you wanna earn the badge? Let's go.
out of the way, looky-loos.
my name is marc st. James,
and I'm playing a part in this drama.
Bradford Meade's to-die-for cavallI suit
may have been just that.
the publishing tycoon was rushed
to st. Gavan's hospital following his collapse
but mr. Meade arrived sans said suit. Where is it?
rumors abound it's being auctioned on the internet
where bids are as high as $600, 000...
I'm just wanna check on the football score. Football?
Bradford Meade is in the hospital.
I'm sure all the games have been canceled.
hello. Any news on mr. Meade?
they still haven't found the suit. No, I mean, how is mr. Meade?
well, he's in a robin's egg blue hospital gown
with white piping.
they say he's still unconscious.
what is that? Uh, my things from the office.
Oh, my baby.
I'm so sorry.
I know how much this job meant to you.
it's okay, dad. I'm okay.
give me Daniel's number.
dad, no. Look, it's-- it's probably all for the best.
good for you, honey.
next, you join a gym and get smoking hot.
then when you run into Daniel,
he'll be begging you to come back.
that's the way I always play it.
mija, you okay?
I've just
I've been thinking about this last year,
and... Dad, i've done things that I never thought i'd do.
and I was the one person Daniel trusted.
I let him down.
Hello, Betty. So much for my nap.
Mrs. Meade, you're alive and in my bedroom.
actually, in our last hideout,
we had separate rooms and a fireplace.
um, okay, uh, I don't even know who you are,
but you can't be here.
Betty, I'm leaving the country tonight,
but I need a favor.
um, no. No, I can't help you get out of the country.
you're a felon. You could get us all in trouble,
and my father just became a citizen.
here, I can give you a hat. What about this sweater? I like this.
it's not for me. It's for my children.
I told you, they gon' be fine.
they white.
I need to find out if Bradford's changed the will.
if Wilhelmina got to him,
he may have left her the company.
and I can't disappear without knowing
my children are taken care of.
how am I supposed to know anything about Bradford's will?
I will tell you where it is and how to get it.
it's right in his office.
no. I don't know. Mrs. Meade, I don't know.
I mean this is exactly the type of thing
I need to stop doing.
why would you stop helping people you care about?
I thought you and Daniel were friends.
you're my only hope.
fine.
fine, I will do it, but for Daniel.
I owe him this.
I just spoke to Amanda.
no change. Bradford's still unconscious.
it was a beautiful wedding, willie,
right up until the heart attack.
Yes, and thanks to his inconvenient collapse,
now my future is in limbo.
Oh, I know you don't like the limbo
or the electric slide or any forced party dancing.
I was supposed to walk into that building on monday
as mrs. Bradford Meade, owning half the company.
without that ring on my finger, I don't know where I stand.
I know he changed the will.
I just don't know what it says.
for all I know,
he could be leaving everything to... Charity.
Marc, I think you know what we need to do.
find this chity person and kill her.
we need to get our hands on the will.
Yeah.
Hey, L'amanda.
I just forgot one thing. I need to scoot back to my desk.
sorry. Aah, excuse me?
you are no longer permitd in these offices.
now I have received word you are no longer an employee.
you received word from me. I told you that.
if I hadn't, you wouldn't know. Suarez, I have a gun,
and I will not hesitate to use it.
they give you a gun? No, girl, they didn't give me no gun,
but I swear to you, I will jump out this circle desk
and tackle you. It'll just be a second.
okay, here I come, cause see, you-- okay, okay, okay.
I'm going. Get on outta here.
that's right, and trust me, you don't want to mix up
with the weekend security, suarez.
respect yourself and get outta here.
I see u, suarez!
Hey, are you okay?
Oh, yeah, my father's upstairs fighting for his life.
I'm taking it out on this vending machine.
he's gonna be okay, Daniel.
you told everyone that yourself.
come on, Amanda.
what was I supposed to say, hmm?
it's just...
you always think you're gonna have more time with someone.
I never told him I loved him.
do you love him?
Yes.
Yes.
we were just never one of those families.
we never said it.
look, Daniel,
you may never have gotten his love or approval,
but at least you got his jawline.
Daniel, he's not gone.
he's right upstairs,
and you can still go tell him anything you want to.
Hey, L'amanda.
Hey, cutie-pie.
you just missed your girlfriend, Betty Suarez.
Ugh. Girlfriend. Please.
I don't know how many times I have to tell that girl,
that is not the way I roll.
Oh, really? Oh, no.
I'm sweet like sugar, soft like suede,
but unlike a piano, I never get played.
Ooh, honey, listen,
I will play you like stevie wonder
on a baby grand.
Sugarstick, where you been all my life?
math camp.
mm, well, 1 plus 1...
is 2.
I knew that.
I knew you knew that.
I'm glad you knew that I knew that you knew
that I knew that.
who the hell are you?
uh, cable company.
I didn't let anyone in from a cable company.
the cable company.
Seriously? Mrs. Meade?
how many homes did you break into
before you got caught? The cable company.
you tell me that I'm stupid... Why you got to be bustin' me out like that in front of people?
fish, don't do this, and fish don't do that. I told you this was not a good
you know exactly what you're doing... Everybody believes somebody came...
and you've known it from the very beginning. From the cable company. I told you.
Mr. Suarez, so nice to see you again. Hi.
I'm just saying,
you looked a little too into the whole sugarstick thing.
Hey, I let you slip past L'amanda
so you can get the key to the executive floor.
it's kind of nice having the sweetness recognized. I call you sweet all the time.
I know. I'm just playin' ya. Don't do that.
sorry. Okay, I'm gonna go in and look for the safe.
you be lookout. Oh, no, I wanna look for the safe.
no, you're lookout. Okay, you're acting sort of bossy.
Oh. Oh, god, I am.
I used to just be a liar and a thief,
and now I'm bossy, too.
sweetie, if it makes you feel any better,
you've always been a little bossy. Oh, thank you, sugarstick.
if I ate lunch,
now would be the time to lose it.
what are you two doing here?
I imagine e same thing you're doing here.
you're looking for a memento
to remember your dying husband?
Oh, um, technically fianc?
that's one.
Yes, uh, we are here looking for a memento, too.
Yeah, mr. Meade meant a lot to me,
being my girlfriend's boss' father.
well, don't let us stop you.
or us you.
Nope.
no memento there.
nothing in here, either.
what is it? Everyone's salaries. Nice, willie.
Oh, let's end this.
I can't stand another minute in this room
with tweedledee and tweedle diego.
obviously, you want to find the will for Daniel.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, Betty. We both want the same thing.
why don't we agree to find the will,
read it, shake hands,
wash our hands and go on with our lives?
please, do you really think
I enjoy scheming, lying, and scurrying about like some rat with great cheekbones? Yes, I think you do.
mm, maybe a little.
but seriously, I am tired of the drama.
so much drama.
the will is in the wall safe.
I have the combination.
I know ouyou'ren trble, mrs. Meade,
but I don't like it.
my Betty's doing things she shouldn't be doing. I did not force her to do anything.
she said she wanted do it for Daniel.
Daniel? After the way he treated her?
Why? What--what happened? I'll tell you what happened.
papi.
it's my other daughter. Hide.
she won't like this.
are you there?
what are you doing lying on Betty's bed?
Oh, nothing.
putting away some clothes and got tired.
who's she?
exterminator.
unbelievable.
Mrs. Meade?
you are the worst fugitive in the world.
okay, just so we're clear, we read the will,
and no matter who wins, we respect mr. Meade's wishes.
agreed.
I just want to be done here
and go back to mourning my late husband.
um, he's not dead yet,
and, once again, you're not technically married.
that's two.
just know, people don't make it to three.
okay, uh, here we go.
Oh, Al Capone's vault. It's empty.
Oh, balls.
the boat takes us to naples, we clear customs,
we start a new life in italy. If you make it.
we gon' make it.
you have passports?
Ooh, darn, we forgot the passport
Yeah, we got some passports. Show them.
I have the travel documents. She has the puzzles.
are you out of your mind? What?
well, she kinda looks like the picture
on her fake passport,
but, um, you don't,
and you're Claire Meade.
your face is everywhere.
if you wanna be "Maria Elena Sonzoni..."
you gotta look like Maria Elena Sonzoni.
I'm sorry, but i just haven't had time for a makeover.
Oh. Well...
lady fugitive, you have come to the right place.
the will's supposed to be in the safe.
I don't understand.
damn Bradford.
always so paranoid. Everything was such a secret.
secret. Secret?
secret room! Secret room!
what room?
what are you talking about? What's going on?
Oh, Betty, there's something on your glasses. Really?
Oops. Sorry.
Oh, my god, that actually worked.
come on, curly. Right behind you, moe.
Marc! Marc! Marc, no!
no, no! Marcmarc!
so what do you think?
sweet.
you know, you could do a lot of business
in the escapee community.
you look like Chita Rivera.
what?
no, no, no, that's a compliment.
he's really got a thing for Chitrivera.
it's okay, dad.
you don't have to fight anymore.
just know that I love you.
if you're ready, you can go.
what are you doing?
I'm helping him.
go. Go towards the light.
no, dad. Don't go to the light.
light bad. No light, no-will you stop?
the doctors practically told us
he's not going to come out of this. Dad
he is gonna die. Stay away from that damn light, dad.
Daniel, I am trying to help him find the light. Listen to me. What are you doing?
you're not helping him. Yes, I am helping him.
you're sending him to the light. He's not-will you two stop fighting?
dad? You're awake.
dad, can you hear us?
dad. See?
Mr. Meade and Fey Sommers had a secret sex room?
Yeah. I know about it. Marc knows about it.
that's where the will has to be.
does anybody else know about it? Um, yeah, christina. Oh, and I think Amanda.
Oh, so apparently everyone knew
about the big, fancy sex room, except for me.
it's like freshman year alover again.
what is going on? I keep calling
your girlfriend L'amanda to get us out of here,
and she's not answering.
what?
what are you looking at?
that grate.
it gets us into the vents and the vents go everywhere.
this could be our way out.
hold on, agent Bauer.
we are not wriggling through a heating system.
do you want to get that will or not? Now come over here.
I'll climb up first, and then i'll pull you up. Wow. Now who's the bossy one?
you know you love it. True.
Wow. I can't believe this even exists,
that Bradford was even into this.
he never invited me down here.
I can do that.
Ooh, I like this.
Ooh, I got it. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
what does it say? Well, give me a minute.
I haven't read that many wills before.
Oh! Okay, uh, uh, "and Wilhelmina slater will share my estate..."
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
including, but not limited
to the holdings of Meade publications. I'm getting a good feeling.
upon the pronouncement of our marriage.
and there goes that feeling. It's over. We're sunk.
upon pronouncement of our marriage.
Oh, I'm gonna have to go back
to dancing in a cage in my underwear.
hold on.
perhaps there's another option.
Oh, thank god, because to be honest with you,
I only had this one move.
there still might be another way
to legally become mrs. Bradford Meade.
is there water boiling underneath you?
cause I think I smell a plan brewing.
we're in a vent.
can you believe this?
we are actually crawling through a vent.
my mother never even let me put my feet on the sofa.
I can't believe you're enjoying this.
I'm hot, and I'm sweaty, and I give up.
Betty, come on. Tap in to your inner action hero.
okay, mexicans don't have action herry.
we have a speedy little mouse.
Oh, wait, wait. We're coming up to it.
Oh, thank god. If I didn't think we were running out of oxygen,
I'd kiss you. Now you said that the secret room
is right behind the closet, right? Uh-huh.
we went 30 yards at a 40-degree angle
from the elevator.
well, if my calcations are correc.
found it.
Oh, hallelujah.
Ooh, L'amanda. Yes?
I couldn't stay away.
when there's chemistry, there's chemistry.
you and I are like water and magnesium.
E-explosive.
I am gonna learn so much from you.
No! No.
L'amanda, I can't do this. I'm a dog.
I will break your heart. Let's never speak of this again.
no, but
Shh.
Shh. Shh.
but I like dogs.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Yeah, it's me, dad.
I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, me, too.
Alexis just went out to get you some water.
look, uh, there's something...
I-I've been wanting to say to you.
and it's, uh, just, it's hard for me.
I mean, we talk...
but we don't really talk.
I don't know why.
you're gonna be okay.
listen...
I'm just gonna tell the doctor you're awake
I love you, too, son.
Mrs. Meade, it's me.
I found the will.
And?
Daniel and Alexis are okay.
Oh, thank you. Oh, i'll never forget this.
can we please get out of here?
because I am really starting to lead L'amanda on.
I just need to do one more thing.
I need to leave a strongly worded note
to that jerk marc. Okay.
dear marc-no. Marc.
good.
Yeah.
please thank Betty again for me.
now I can leave in peace.
Yeah, cause crossing the atlantic
was it be a bitch if she was in one of her moods.
you have the travel scrabble? Yeah, I got it.
Hey, can I eat dinner in front of the tv?
they're doing an interview on christina aguilera
about the Meade wedding. I am such an ag-hag.
you look familiar.
she's just an old friend of the family.
can't quite place the face. A little Chita Rivera, right?
so can I eat and watch?
sure, honey.
Thanks. Love you, mom.
I love you, too.
you, uh... Have a very sweet boy.
thank you.
I can't do it,
not without seeing my children.
I have to get to the hospital. Would you please take me?
fish, no. Now you walk up in there, you caught.
I'll be okay. Now wait here.
we are going to italy.
but if I'm not back by 8: 00,
promise you'll go without me.
so in conclusion,
you are a weenie.
you're taking a writing class?
I repeated my thesis. He is a weenie.
and now I'm gonna put it where he can't miss it.
you know, Wilhelmina also locked us in there.
Yeah, but she scares me. Ah.
what is this?
it looks like marc's been ordained
to perform weddings.
for who?
Oh, god.
we may be able to perform surgery in the morning.
thank you, doctor. Oh, this is good.
I told you not to count out Bradford Meade. He's a redwood.
I guess you're right. He's stronger than I thought.
remember when he spent eight hours
trying to catch that marlin off of portugal?
God, that was a great vacation.
Yeah, I wish he'd taken us.
excuse me, Daniel, i
Mr. Suarez, what are you doing here? Come with me, please.
it's about your mother.
they're gone. Perfect.
I now pronounce you man and wife!
Oh, will you stop that? You're ordained, not magical.
do you have the papers? It's all right here.
okay, well, we need a witness, so find someone.
Oh, Bradford.
bradford, my love, I'm here.
my darling.
you're awake. I'm so happy.
and I have some wonderful news.
you and I can still be married.
I'm leaving tonight.
mom, you can't.
please stay. We just got you back.
we can find someplace for you to hide.
I can't live like that, sweetheart.
they'll give up looking for me eventually,
and we'll meet up somewhere.
now just remember,
you two need each other.
you're all you have.
mom, how is it that you're here? How did this happen?
Betty and her family.
and, Daniel, you need to know
why Betty didn't tell you about Wilhelmina's affair.
do you, Bradford Meade, take Wilhelmina slater
wait, wait.
Bradford what is it? You all right?
Danielold me that you slept with your bodyguard.
that's ridiculous.
you're not making any sense.
now, sweetheart, i just need you
to say two words, "I do,"
and then we'll get you some pudding.
I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me you didn't do it.
I never slept with him.
you never loved me, did you?
go on. Get out of here. I want to see my family.
go on.
Hey!
excuse me.
Mr. Meade, what happened?
tell me you didn't marry her.
Oh, no, I came to my senses.
I was a silly old fool.
Wilhelmina never loved me.
only pson who ever loved me is my wife claire.
why am I telling you this?
would you like to tell her?
Mrs. Meade, it'setty.
um, I'm here with your husband.
he wants to talk to you.
you're in the elevator?
mom, you can't be serious. I am doing this.
I would rather spend the rest of my life in jail
than give up the chance to see my husband one last time.
we'll walk you in.
no, I want to do this alone,
and I don't want him to see me like this.
isn't that Claire Meade?
Claire, come get a picture!
right here, claire.
you can't be here.
I don't care.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't...i
Shh.
Shh. Don't talk.
let's just sit here.
you know, on our wedding day,
when I was waiting to walk down the aisle to you,
I remember thinking,
someday that son of a bitch is going to break my heart.
and I did.
but i'd take that walk again tomorrow
if you could promise me another 35 years.
I've never loved anyone more than you.
thank you for giving me the greatest life.
I'll give you guys a minute.
look, I know why you couldn't tell me
about Wilhelmina's affair.
Daniel, all I care about
is that you know I'm on your side...
always.
I know.
I.I just...felt betrayed.
Betty, I would love for you to come back to work.
that means so much.
but I don't think I can.
what?
Daniel, this...this last year at "mode,"
it wouldn't trade that for anything.
I mean, you took a chance on me,
and it opened up a whole different world.
it totally changed my life,
but, I think, too much.
I'm changing into someone that I really don't want to be.
so you're leaving?
I think I have to.
it's your life, Betty.
you do what you have to do.
Oh! Please let me go see him one more
she's not resisting. Don't hurt her. Come on.
I'm not fighting you. Daniel, Alexis!
Betty, can you please stay with my dad? Don't hurt my mother.
no, uh, she left. It's Betty.
Betty, come here.
do you need a nurse?
are you all right?
I need you to do something for me.
what?
take care of Daniel.
I won't be here, and
no, mr. Meade. You're gonna be fine.
I remember seeing you
walk into the building that first day.
I had a feeling about you.
you're the only one who's ever been able to keep Daniel on his path.
he'd be lost without you.
now I need some water.
Mr. Meade.
Mr. Meade? Excuse me, miss. We need to get through.
there's no pul.
chairman of e Meade publishing empire
passed away at 10: 14 p. M. This evening
just a few minutes after his fugitive wife
Claire Meade was dramatically captured
outside his room at st. Gavan's hospital
Mrs. Meade has been missing six months ago since fleeing a prison transport van
Mrs. Meade stated that her fellow escaped
Amelia bluman, a car thief and con artist
also known as yoga,
died later from injuries sustained during the escape.
Mrs. Meade is now being transported to rikers island.
in a statement released just moments ago,
is this Bradford mea's body?
you look like a young doctor
fresh out of medical school.
you must have some loans.
I have a proposition you might be interested in.
gene Simmons is my father.
daddy? - Daughter?
I'm going to start a magazine-- "hot flash."
if I can't marry into the meade family, I will give birth to an heir.
we need to find a surrogate we can control.
do we feel pregnant yet?
how long am I trapped here for?
I'm Renee.
I'm Daniel. - Meade. I know.
I see you've met my sister.
you think it's too early to start planning family vacations?
you're a fool, Daniel.
you have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
you just really seemed to up your game when betty showed up. - What?
I don't think I'm the Suarez sister you like.
tell me who you're dating. - Henry from accounting. There.
more. - He got Charlie pregnant.
I know you're leaving in five months, and I know that I'm gonna get my heart broken, but maybe it's worth it.
what is this place?
where am I?
you're in the most amazing place ever.
happy birthday, Betty.
I don't understand.
we're here because you're going to have the best birthday of your life.
good morning.
there she is... - Good morning.
the birthday girl.
thank you, papi. - Happy birthday, chica.
Oh, I got something for you.
what? You want 23 more?
love the bag, Aunt Betty. Vuitton?
no, it's a fake.
I got it from some guy selling off a blanket on 6th avenue.
you know, you make it really hard for me to live vicariously through you.
so I know you didn't want anything special this year, but maybe before you head off for the poconos, some birthday pancakes?
daddy, I love your birthday breakfasts, but henry and I want to get an early start.
well, I hope you and Henry have a wonderful weekend.
and, uh, don't forget your cupcakes.
Oh, I won't.
it was nice of Daniel to give you the day off.
I know. He was great about it, except he says now I owe him one.
someone has a short memory.
okay, I know you told us not to, but...
a cell phone!
Justin, this is-- wait, is this my cell phone?
turn it over.
I love it.
fierce, huh? - Very.
don't do that.
no? - No.
no. Okay. - No.
uh, guys, I love you.
I'll see you sunday night. I'm so excited.
love you. - Love you, too.
Aw, they are gonna have such a good time this weekend.
papi, what's wrong?
she forgot the cupcakes.
just a minute.
did you shave your arms? They look bigger.
Daniel, I know we've had our issues...
you tried to ruin my magazine, destroy my family, marry my father on his deathbed
some bigger than others, but I never personally wish you any harm.
that's why I'm here to warn you about Renee.
Renee has a history with men.
she become needy, erratic, obsessive.
it probably has something to do with daddy withholding affection while we were growing up.
I mean, I've dealt with it well, but Renee on the other hand
stop. You don't have to say anymore.
I don't believe anything you have to say.
stony Brook. - What?
ask my sister about stony brook if you really want to get to know her.
how was I?
excellent. Sincere, but not condescending, just the right dash of menace and your breasts, of course, look amazing.
you've gotten under his pasty, hairless skin, woman.
well, I better. Renee's a loose cannon.
I can't have that, not with what I have planned.
Oh, god, this bloody window.
Oh, is a nice breeze too much to ask for?
I bet my sister had it bolted shut.
evil robots don't need oxygen. let me help you.
Oh, go on, please.
this should freshen things up a wee bit.
no candles... ever.
okay.
Christina, okay, wait. Repeat, please, and try to enunciate.
I'm saying there's something goin' on with her, and I am going to find out what it is.
with who?
Wilhelmi's sister--Renee. She's strange.
like, just now. Like, listen, I tried to light a candle...
and she totally freaked out.
what? A-a candy?
what type of candy? Why were you lighting it?
a candle.
I can't hear you.
Justin bedazzled my cell phone...
and I think there's glue in the circuitry.
I know. It's a mystery... but I'm gonna find out.
okay, I'll talk to you later.
Henry! Birthday girl in the house
I'm ready to get in the car, go on our adventure!
I love adventures. Where are we going?
I-I didn't even know you were in town.
well, you know, I've been trying for months to get into this parenting seminar with harvey karp.
he's, like, this amazing baby doctor.
he's, like, a baby guru genius. - Betty.
anyway, so I get a phone call yesterday, and they have an opening in a seminar this weekend, so...
this weekend?
c-can you just give us a minute?
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, of course. Sure.
baby kicked. Baby kicked. he's so excited to see his daddy.
Betty, listen, she just showed up.
I already told her she can go to that seminar without me. We can still go away.
no, no, no, Henry.
What--what are you supposed to do? It's for the baby.
but it's your birthday weekend.
I know. I know, but--but maybe we don't have to go away.
we could just celebrate here in new york. It's new york.
there's restaurants and nightclubs, and I will organize the ultimate birthday extravaganza, to which you are invited.
Betty, you're unbelievable.
only when I'm with you.
Henry, I can't find the toothpaste.
top left drawer!
I'll see you tonight. - Okay.
Alexis, I got the numbers you sent me on mom's magazine.
good. 'Cause we really need to talk.
Oh, my god. What are you doing?
trying on the new domingo line.
Oh, get over it. When we were kids, we used to bathe together.
yeah? Well, when we were kids, you were a boy.
so did you look at mom's budget?
Yeah, I did. I think she's finally lost it.
this was supposed to be a hobby to make her feel better, not a real magazine.
and check this out-- she wants to do an ongoing series about extreme adventure for the over-50 set.
it only adds $50, 000 an issue. You gotta talk to her.
no. You wanted to be in charge. This is your problem.
Oh, Amanda, hey.
so look, I know I'm not supposed to be here, 'cause it's my birthday, and I was going away for the weekend...
to Des Moines? - The poconos.
Oh, well, anyone who's anyone is going to Des Moines.
my dad, Gene Simmons, who's in the band kiss, is playing there tonight.
rock roll. I love saying that. It totally feels right.
anyway, uh, my plans have changedso I'm here, and I kind of have a problem.
Oh, right, 'cause you're turning 40? - 24
I need to plan a great new york birthday, and I figured, if anyone knows, Amanda knows.
where is the most romantic place to have dinner in new york?
Oh, my god. Right now the Pemberly inn is so hot.
if I could sit on the patio at sunset, I would make out with...
well... you.
okay. Pemberly inn. Got it. Thanks.
happy 50th.
good morning, Daniel.
I bet you're surprised to see me.
uh, should I be? Right. You weren't supposed to come in today.
look, I'm sorry. I've had a weird morning.
uh, glad you're feeling better.
I'm not sick.
it's sort of a special day today.
Oh, my god. Oh, of course. I almost forgot.
it's okay. - Renee's coming for lunch.
could you make sure and order us something really special?
um, okay. All right.
uh, now, invites for tonight, you have three options
uh, ooh, dugout seats to the Yankees game and drinks with Derek Jeter-- Fun
Moby and Natalie Portman's private reception for julian schnabel at the gagosian--cool
V. I. P. Tickets to the new york philharmonic in central park and fireworks
not really up your alley. I'll just get rid of these.
no, no, wait. Concert with fireworks...
I mean, that sounds kind a
dangerous, I know. I-I'm glad you're not going.
no, no, hang on. Maybe Renee and I could...
you know what? Forget it.
I really don't want to get grass stains on these pants anyway.
good point.
the whole weekend is off? What happened?
Charlie happened.
she showed up for a "surprise visit."
well, now we gotta do something for Betty.
no. She already made other plans.
she's going to a concert in the park tonight with Henry.
papi, you know how much it means to her to be with him tonight.
I know, but it means something to me to have the family together on birthdays.
Hey, what if I bring your cupcakes over to henry's, and then they can eat them under the stars tonight and, like, we'll be there in spirit?
getting eaten.
sorry about the outfit. I just came from hip-hop class.
I have big news. I found the perfect apartment.
Really? - Yeah. And guess where it is?
on spring, right around the corner from your place.
sou-sounds great.
okay, you're blinking a lot. What--what's wrong?
Oh, no, I--It's just everything's happening so fast. You know?
how well do we really know each other?
what are you saying?
uh, Wilhelmina stopped by my place this morning, and she said some things, and, um...
I'm just gonna ask you-- Renee, what is stony brook?
what is Stony Brook? - Yeah.
it's a state college on long island.
I went to school there, Daniel.
sure, I was a little wild. I had a few boyfriends.
you're not the only one who had a life before we met. - No.
I-I--I'm amazed th-that you would even care what my sister has to say after everything that's happened with you two.
Renee, I'm sorry. I just
no, I'm sorry. Why don't you call me when you're ready to trust me a little?
uh, yes, a table for two on the patio.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
um, no problem. Thanks. Uh, just--could you do me a favor?
could you tell your manager that "mode" won't be needing the pemberly inn for our big fashion week party, where we spend many hundreds of thousds of dollars?
Oh, what's that? Something just opened up? Great.
uh, it's suarez-- s-u-a-r-e-z. Thank you.
Gio... your hair.
summer's coming. You gotta let the head breathe.
so where have you been?
um, around. You know, just, uh, working, and, uh, living.
uh, yep, working and living.
so the Pemberly inn, huh? What's the occasion?
it's my birthday.
happy birthday. - Thanks.
so you going to dinner with Henry?
Yeah, uh, we were supposed to go away for the weekend, but, uh, Charlie showed up.
Oh, the baby mama.
Yeah, but, it--but, it's fine. It's fine.
Henry and I are gonna have a perfect night right here in manhattan
an intimate dinner, and then a concert and fireworks in the park.
you know, the only thing missing is a carriage ride. - Yeah.
wait, a-a carriage ride? - Yeah.
why'd you say that?
I don't know. It just seemed like something you'd be into.
it was good to see you. - You, too.
sorry we don't talk as much anymore.
Yeah, well, you know, just, uh, working and living.
Yeah. Working and living...
you bitch. - Well, hello to you, too.
why are you trying to break up me and Daniel?
Renee, we both know what happens to you when things get too serious with men.
this is nothing like Stony Brook.
good. It took a lot of work to clean up that mess.
I'm warning you-- leave us alone or you will regret it, Wilhelmina.
I'm sure I'm not the only one around here with secrets.
Yes, Amanda.
what's your favorite thing about getting old?
is it your hair thinning or when kids ask you about Vietnam?
can I help you with something?
Yeah, you know that guy you're always pretending is your boyfriend?
he's on line two.
Hey, birthday girl.
Hi, I'm so glad you called.
I have a surprise for tonight.
one word--fireworks.
that's two words.
no, technically, that's one word. - Nerdapalooza.
Amanda, get off the phone.
well, I have a surprise for you, too.
Oh, henry, I have to go. My day's about to get a lot better, but I'll call you back. I love you. Bye.
Daniel, this is so sweet.
Oh, good. I mean, it better be, 'cause I gotta tell you, Renee is really mad at me.
what is it with me and women, betty?
it's like no matter what I do, I'm always letting them down, especially the ones I care about the most.
can you just make sure she gets that as soon as possible?
okay, I'll send a messenger right away.
cupcakes?
Aw, that's so sweet, but didn't you hear?
there isn't gonna be a birthday date.
Oh, didn't you hear?
Henry and Betty have a whole new plan for tonight
fancy dinner, romantic concert in the park, and then afterwards, fireworks, if you know what I mean.
well, you know what? That's great for them.
that Betty, she, uh, sure doesn't let anything get in her way, does she?
no, she doesn't, but if it does, I got her back.
these are not just decorative.
see ya.
so what do you think?
wow, mom, it's so saucy.
I know...
and if you look closely, you can see a nipple imprint.
I've still got it.
so listen, mom, we need to talk.
Oh, that sounds ominous. What is it?
it's about the budget for "hot flash."
given the current realities of the market,
I just--I can't put any more money into the project.
you're cutting me off?
w-we haven't even launched yet, a-and I still need funding for a staff.
I'm sorry. - Don't do this me.
you're my daughter. - I'm also your boss.
let me help you with that.
I got it. Thank you.
wil said you'd be coming by.
she sure is working you with all this baby stuff.
I know, but it's nothing compared to what she must be going through, planning for motherhood and all to
where is she, anyway?
deep tissue massage.
Yeah, she skipped the baby C. P.R. Class and made Christina go alone.
of course she did.
well, maybe the massage will help circulate the ice in her veins.
did I say that out loud?
no, honey, please, it's okay. I know how my sister is.
so, it is, uh, happy hour.
I was just about to make myself a drink.
you like chocolatinis? - Liquor and chocolate?
Oh, gee, I don't know. Bring it.
Mrs. Meade.
I'm so sorry. I try to keep up the appearance that I never use the bathroom.
I hope you won't think less of me.
Oh, um, no. No. I really, really won't.
are you okay?
Oh, my own daughter just told me that she doesn't believe in my magazine.
Alexis said that?
well, not in so many words, but it was pretty clear.
she thinks the magazine is just a fantasy, a pipe dream.
so I have decided not to move forward with "hot flash."
I'm calling it quits. - No.
Mrs. Meade, so what if it is a fantasy?
that doesn't mean you can't make it come true.
ju-just today, all of my dreams were crushed, and I-I picked myself up,
I utilized my resources, and now things are gonna be even better.
Betty, what resources do I have?
everyone I know has turned their back on me.
but you're the most resourceful person I know.
you can do anything.
you're very perky, you know that?
I've heard that before.
so what dreams of yours were crushed today?
well, it's my birthday...
and there was a change in plans, but everything is fine.
Henry and I are going to dinner.
how do I look?
Oh, no, no. I couldn't. - Yes, you can.
Hey, it's Betty. Leave a message. I'll call you back.
Hey, Betty. I've got some bad news.
Charlie's not feeling well, so I'm gonna have to take her to the doctor.
don't go to the restaurant.
I'll meet up with you later.
Betty, I'm so sorry. Love you.
one unheard message.
Betty-- ... Go to the restaurant.
I'll meet up with you-- I love you.
um, Suarez. Reservation for two.
so Willie really got that girl to eat dog food?
Yeah, that girl was her best friend.
she called it a loyalty test.
portrait of a mean girl, age 15.
Wilhelmina's always been good at getting people to do things they didn't want to do.
she still is.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
how so? - Well, she practically forced christina to carry this baby so she could get the money to save her husband's life.
No! - Yes!
and when chriina finds out who the sperminator is...
I thought it was an anonymous donor.
it's Bradford Meade. - No.
she stole the sperm from his dead corpse, and when the bastard heir is born, she will finally get her hands on a third of the Meade empire.
Oh, I think I'm gonna vomit. Excuse me. Thank you.
are you ready to order?
um, actually, no, not yet.
or, you know what? Um, I could start with a...
the, uh... uh, the--the cheese fondue.
that dish is for two people.
Yeah. There will be two of us.
uh, my boyfriend is, uh, on the way. He's coming.
it is a lot of cheese.
we're hungry.
okay, one cheese fondue for you and your boyfriend.
okay. Okay, Henry. Thanks for calling.
Henry is canceling on Betty?
Charlie's not feeling well. - Yeah, right.
beeyotch.
what? You know you guys were thinking it.
all right, familia Suarez.
you know what this means.
I'll clear a dance floor.
and I'm making the cupcakes.
and I was like, "slow your roll, Mary-Kate."
you just can't call dibs on every hot piece of... pie." Gotta go."
that is so sweet of you. Thank you.
Yeah, well, it's for Betty.
what?
you just reminded me of a really funny story.
see, Betty's "boyfriend" called earlier, and he is totally blowing her off for their big birthday date tonight. See?
did you give her this message?
I'm a receiver, not a giver.
can I have that now?
how precious.
did you make it yourself?
it's a gift from Daniel, with all his love.
Oh, you're not gonna ruin this relationship, Wilhelmina, not unless you want your own dirty laundry out in the open.
whatever are you talking about?
I know about Bradford's baby, and your plan to g your claws into the Meade Fortune.
Oh, I know about all of it.
mm, you know nothing.
she stole the sperm from his dead corpse and when the bastard heir is born, she will finally get her hands on a third of the Meade empire.
Oh, I think I'm gonna vomit.
last time I checked, sperm-stealing was illegal.
I think this is all Daniel's gonna need to go straight to the police, unless...
unless what?
less you leave me and Daniel alone.
let me have what I want, and you can have what you want.
you really want to do this?
Oh, yes.
very well, then.
I'm gonna go spend the night at my boyfriends.
Mademoiselle, please. I'm only 24.
Yes, I'm so sorry.
see, it has been a while, and it is friday night, and we are very booked.
And?
there is a couple waiting for this table.
it is their anniversary.
it's my birthday, and--and my boyfriend
he's not here. We apologize.
may I offer you a doggie bag for the cheese?
what are you doing here?
and why are you in a carriage?
Henry left a message with Amanda.
he can't make it tonight.
so I'm not trying to take his place or anything, but when I heard you were on your own,
I remembered my cousin drives these things for tourists, and I thought, she deserves to have a little fun.
so what do you say? Want a ride?
I-I don't know, Gio. - Come on.
once around the block.
fine. Once around the block.
all right.
Willie, I know I screwed up, but breaking into Daniel's apartment, isn't that a felony?
I'm too pretty for prison.
they'll pass me around like a collection plate at a catholic church.
stop whining. You owe me.
and prison is exactly where I'll end up if they find out how this baby was really conceived.
I feel like you'd do well in prison.
I would.
now relax. You don't have to break in.
don't you think I would have had an extra set of keys made for daniel's apartment?
Oh, Marc, you underestimate me.
I hate myself even more.
okay, Willie, I'm going in.
but if I don't make it out alive...
we'll always have Bergdorf's, darling.
we all know what it's li to be ignored, taken for granted, not valued.
that is never going to happen to the staff at "hot flash" magazine because this isn't just a job.
it's a family.
speaking of family, I'd like to introduce you all to my beautiful daughter Alexis Meade.
hello.
can I talk to you for a sec? Mom, what's going on?
I thought I told you there's no money to hire a staff.
relax, darling, I don't need your money or anyonelse's.
I'm using my own resources.
turns out there's a work program for recently released inmates.
it's subsidized by the state, so my overhead is minimal.
they're prisoners? - Ex-prisoners...
like me.
mom, do any of them have any experience?
they have life experience, and that's what "hot flash" is all about
your life just changed. What do you do now?
I can't think of a better talent pool.
all right, let's get back to work.
anybody have a fan? It is hot in here.
and then the weekend of my 10th birthday, there was this blizzard, so no one could get to the party, and we couldn't leave the house, so we had to eat leftover cake for weeks.
well, that's not so bad. - Yeah.
why are we stopping?
snowflake has to take care of some business.
sorry. Not quite the birthday you imagined, huh?
eh, it's my own fault.
I had this stupid fantasy-- fireworks, epic romance...
like Romeo and Juliet.
Oh, you know those two ended up dead in a tomb, right?
Yeah, I don't like thinking about that part. - All right.
fantasies are fun, but we live in reality.
it's not perfect, but it doesn't mean it can't be pretty good.
I know. I know, I know, and--and--and it is.
I'm lucky, except for the part where Henry's leaving me after his baby's born.
it's getting late. I should get home.
no. You're not going home.
I'm not? - No. We're heading to central park.
we can still catch the end of that show.
Betty wants fireworks for her birthday, she's gettin' fireworks.
Hello?
hello.
Oh, Daniel Meade, you naughty, naughty boy.
what are you doing? - oh, god.
I, uh, I'm... I'm...
I want you. - Excuse me?
you, you big, sexy... magazine editor.
I want you. I love you. I've always loved you.
stop that. This smells like Wilhelmina.
no. It smells like the beginning of something beautiful.
I'm calling the police.
well, we'll always have this moment.
have you heard from Betty?
her phone's not working.
here comes somebody.
is it her?
no, I need more time. This banner is subpar.
ay, just hang it. Who cares?
it's not Betty.
thought you were at the doctor.
I-I was. Um, everything's fine.
they couldn't find anything wrong.
I think Charlie was just trying to ruin my night with Betty.
I can't believe I fell for it.
me, either.
but this is your baby we're talking about.
what are you gonna do, right? - Thanks.
just glad I didn't miss betty's party completely. Is she here?
not yet. Thank you.
I don't think we're gonna make it.
it sounds like it's almost over.
somebody had to stop for hot chocolate.
what? We're gonna make it, okay?
what was that? - Crap.
think I busted a wheel. I'm gonna try to rig something up.
Oh, okay. Well, here, I can help.
no, no. No. You stay in the carriage. I don't want you to dirty your dress.
Betty! - Oh, no.
you okay? - I'm okay.
Oh, no.
man, uh... I think I have a, uh...
napkin. Okay.
Thanks. - Yeah.
uh, I'm so sorry, Betty.
this night sucks, huh?
you're such a great girl.
you're so good and nice, and you deserve to have an amazing birthday.
Gio, it's not your fault. You did everything you could.
it's fine. - No. No, it's not.
I'm-- you know, I'm not a big believer in this whole fantasy thing, but I at least wanted you to have a little bit of yours.
I'm sorry. I wasted your whole night.
no, look. Look!
fireworks.
this smells like Wilhelmina.
Oh, my--That is exactly what I said.
you know, look, I stupidly let her get to me this morning.
I messed up. I am sorry.
no, I'm sorry, too, Daniel...
because I haven't told you everything.
you can. Trust me.
all right.
well, it was back in college at Stony Brook.
I had a breakdown, and I went to a treatment facility.
still see a shrink. And, uh...
I take these every day.
it was a long time ago, you know, but ...
I guess I'm still a little sensitive about it.
thank you for telling me the truth. - Yeah.
but if you think for a second that's gonna make me want to be with you any less, you're wrong.
Really?
don't take that apartment.
will you move in with me?
Oh, hell, yeah.
I wonder what Mr. Dull and sister crazy are doing right now.
Ugh, don't look at me. I don't get straight people.
who puts what where? It's all so confusing.
Oh, speak of she-devil.
Renee, what a surprise.
do you have a minute, Wilhelmina?
I'd like to rub something in your face.
well, someone's already doing that right now, but go ahead.
Daniel and I are moving in together.
Yeah, he's out getting champagne to celebrate as we speak.
hip hip hooray.
and, Willie, I know what you're up to.
did you really think I'd be so stup as to just leave that recording lying around?
well, you can't blame a girl for trying.
I'm not going away, so if you or marc interfere again,
I will release that recording to everyone, and it'll be all over for you, Wilhelmina.
like I give a tinker's fart about that recording.
no one's gonna believe the rantings of a drunken fool.
Hey, feelings. - out.
and no one's gonna believe a crazy woman, either. Show me.
are you sure those are the right pills?
they were the ones in that hideous green bag.
what did you replace them with?
your fat-blockers.
they were the only ones that matched.
Oh, Marc, we want her crazy, not crazy and thin.
Oh, right. - Well, no matter.
those pills are all that stand between my sister and the nuthouse.
in a few days, she'll start losing a grip on reality, and then my plan will be in motion.
sorry, Renee.
I' got too much riding on this. In.
you're home.
Hilda and Justin are asleep, and, uh, he wanted to wait for you.
I can't believe you guys did all of this and I missed it.
you didn't have to do anything special for me.
you know what? I think all of this was, um, more for me.
doing these kind of things makes me feel good, like I'm taking care of my lile girl.
but you're a grown-up now.
you don't need me making cupcakes anymore.
Papi...
there will never be a day when I don't need cupcakes...
or you.
actually, I could really use e of those cupcakes right about now.
well, I may have a few... dozen left in the kitchen.
Really?
Aah, you're the best.
he Willie, you know I've never been one to second-guess your choices, but can I ask you a question, friend-to-friend?
Marc, you know I hate when things get personal between the two of us.
I do. I do. I know, but it's just...
what we're doing... I mean, Nee's your sister.
there are things in her past, Marc-- Terrible things.
you have no idea what she's done or what she's capable of.
Renee and I were
I know you think I'm the evil sister, Marc... - Well...
but at least I stop short of murder.
this is the best birthday present I got all day.
Oh, I almost forgot...
what?
I'm supposed to make sure you get this.
Daniel? Wh-when did he
he dropped it off a couple of weeks ago.
he just wanted to make sure he didn't forget.
he remembered he'd forget?
Oh, I'm gonna call it a night.
happy birthday, sweetie. - Thank you, daddy.
I love you, too.
mm, Betty. You're here.
Yeah, I didn't want to wake you.
I never got a chance to tell you happy birthday.
thank you.
I'm sorry it wasn't perfect.
Yeah, me, too.
daddy? daughter?
I'm going to start a magazine-- "hot flash.
if I can't marry into the Meade family,
I will give birth to an heir.
we need to find a surrogate we can control.
do we feel pregnant yet? How long am I trapped here for?
I'm Renee. I'm Daniel.
Meade. I know.
I see you've met my sister.
you think it's too early to start planning family vacations you're a fool,
Daniel.
you have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
you just really seemed to up your game when Betty showed u?
what? I don't think I'm the Suarez sister you like.
tell me who you're dating. Henry from accounting. there.
more. He got Charlie pregnant.
I know you're leaving in five months,
and I know that i'm gonna get my heart broken,
but maybe it's worth it.
what is this place?
where am I?
you're in the most amazing place ever.
Henry.
happy birthday, Betty.
I don't understand.
we're here because you're going to have
the best birthday of your life.
good morning.
there she is... good morning.
the birthday girl.
Feliz cumpleas, my amor.
thank you, papi.
happy birthday, chica. oh, I got something for you.
what? You want 23 more?
love the bag, aunt bey. vuitton?
no, it's a fake. I got it from some guy
selling off a blanket on 6th avenue. you know,
you make it really hard for me
to live vicariously through you.
so I know you didn't want anything special this year,
but maybe before you head of for the Poconos,
some birthday pancakes?
daddy, I love your birthday breakfasts,
but Henry and I want to get an early start.
well, I hope you and Henry have a wonderful weekend. mm.
and, uh, don't forget your cupcakes. oh, I won't.
it was nice of Daniel to give you the day off. I know.
he was great about it,
except he says now I owe him one.
someone has a short memory.
OK, I know you told us not to, but...
Aah! A cell phone!
Justin, this is
wait, is this my cell phone?
turn it over.
Aah! I love it.
fierce, huh?
very. don't do that.
no? no.
no. no.
OK. uh, guys, I love you. I'll see you sunday night.
I'm so excited. love you.
love you, too.
Aw, they are gonna have such a good time this weekend.
papi, what's wrong?
she forgot the cupcas.
just a minute.
did you shave your arms? they look some bigger than others,
Daniel, I know we've had our issues...
you tried to ruin my magazine, destroy my family,
marry my father on his deathbed
but I never personally wish you any harm.
that's why i'm here to warn you about Renee.
Renee has a history with men.
she becomes needy, erratic, obsessive.
it probably has something to do with daddy withholding affection
while we were growing up.
I mean, I've dealt with it well, but Renee on the other hand
stop. you don't have to say anymore.
I don't believe anything you have to say.
stony brook.
what?
ask my sister about Stony Brook
if you really want to get to know her.
how was I? Excellent. sincere, but not condescending,
just the right dash of menace
and your breasts, of course, look amazing.
you've gotten under his pasty, hairless skin, woman.
well, I better. Renee's a loose cannon.
I can't have that, not with what I have planned.
Oh, god, this bloody window.
Oh, is a nice breeze too much to ask for?
I bet my sister had it bolted shut.
evil robots don't need oxygen.
Oh. let me help you.
Oh, go on, please. ohh.
Ooh. this should freshen things up a wee bit.
no candles... ever.
OK.
Christina, ok, wait.
repeat, please,
and try to enunciate.
I'm sayin' there's something goin' on with her,
and I am going to find out what it is.
with who?
Wilhelmina's sister--Renee.
she's strange.
like, just now. like, listen,
I tried to light a candle...
and she totally freaked out. what? a-a candy?
what type of candy? why were you lighting it?
a candle.
I can't hear you. Justin bedazzled my cell phone...
and I think there's glue in the circuitry.
I know. it's a mystery...
but I'm gonna find out. Ok, I'll talk to you later.
Henry!
I'm ready to get in the car, go on our adventure!
I love adventures. Where are we going?
Charlie.
Charlie. I-I didn't even know you were in town.
well, you know, I've been trying for months to get
into this parenting seminar with Harvey Karp.
he's, like, this amazing baby doctor.
he's, like, a baby guru genius. Betty.
anyway, so I get a phone call yesterday,
and they have an opening in a seminar this weekend, so... this weekend?
c-can you just give us a minute?
Oh, right. yeah, yeah, of course. sure.
baby kicked. baby kicked.
he's so excited to see his daddy.
Betty, listen, she just showed up.
I already told her she can go to that seminar without me.
we can still go away. no, no, no, Henry.
What--what are you supposed to do?
it's for the baby.
but it's your birthday weekend.
I know. I know, but--but maybe we don't have to go away.
we could just celebrate here in new york.
it's new york.
there's restaurants and nightclubs,
and I will organize the ultimate birthday extravaganza,
to which you are invited.
Betty, you're unbelievable.
only when I'm with you.
Henry, I can't find the toothpaste.
top left drawer!
I'll see you tonight.
OK.
Alexis,
I got the numbers you sent me on mom's magazine.
good. 'cause wereally need to talk.
Oh, my god. what are you doing?
trying on the new Domingo line. oh, get over it.
when we were kids, we used to bathe together.
yeah? well, when we were kids, you were a boy.
so did you look at mom's budget?
Yeah, I did. I think she's finally lost it.
this was supposed to be a hobby to make her feel better,
not a real magazine. and check this out
she wants to do an ongoing series
about extreme adventure for the over-50 set.
it only adds $50, 000 an issue.
you gotta talk to her. no. you wanted to be in charge.
this is your problem.
Oh, Amanda, hey. so look, I know I'm not
supposed to be here, cause it's my birthday,
and I was going away for the weekend... to Des moines?
the Poconos. oh, well, anyone who's anyone is going to Des moines.
my dad, Gene Simmons, who's in the band kiss,
is playing there tonight. rock 'n' roll.
I love saying that. it totally feels right.
anyway, uh, my plans have changed, so i'm here,
and I kind of have a problem.
Oh, right, cause you're turning 40? 24.
I need to plan a great new york birthday,
and I figured, if anyone knows, Amanda knows.
where is the most romantic place to have dinner in new york?
Oh, my god. right now the Pemberly Inn is so hot.
if I could sit on the patio at sunset,
I would make out with...
you.
okay. Pemberly Inn. got it. thanks.
happy 50th.
good morning, Daniel.
I bet you're surprised to see me.
uh, should I be?
right. you weren't supposed to come in today.
look, I'm sorry. I've had a weird morning.
uh, glad you're feeling better.
I'm not sick.
it's sort of a special day today.
Oh, my god. oh, of course. I almost forgot. it's ok.
Renee's coming for lunch.
could you make sure and order us something really special?
um, ok. all right.
uh, now, invites for tonight, you have three options
uh, ooh, dugout seats to the yankees game
and drinks with DeRek Jeter-- fun
Moby and Natalie Portman's private reception
for julian schnabel at the Gagosian--cool
Mm. v. i.p. tickets to the new york philharmonic
in central park and fireworks-- not really up your alley.
I'll just get rid of these. no, no, wait. concert with fireworks...
mean, that sounds kinda-- dangerous, I know. i-i'm glad you're not going.
no, no, hang on. maybe Renee and I could...
you know what? forget it.
I really don't want to get grass stains
on these pants anyway.
good point.
the whole weekend is off? what happened?
Charlie happened. oh.
she showed up for a "surprise visit.
well, now we gotta do something for Betty.
no. she already made other plans.
she's going to a concert in the park tonight with Henry.
papi, you know how much it means to her
to be with him tonight. I know, but it means something tome
to have the family together on birthdays. hey,
what if I bring your cupcakes over to Henry's,
and then they can eat them under the stars tonight
and, like, we'll be there in spirit? getting eaten.
whoa. oh. sorry about the outfit.
I just came from hip-hop class.
I have big news. I found the perfect apartment.
Really? yeah. and guess where it is?
on Spring, right around the corner from your place.
huh. uh... sou-sounds great.
OK, you're blinking a lot. what--what's wrong?
Oh, no, i--it's just everything's happening so fast.
you know? how well do we really know each other?
what are you saying?
uh, Wilhelmina stopped by my place this morning,
and she said some things, and, um...
I'm just gonna ask you
Renee, what is Stony Brook?
stony brook? mm-hmm.
what is Stony Brook? yeah.
it's a state college on long island.
I went to school there, Daniel.
sure, I was a little wild. I had a few boyfriends.
you're not the only one who had a life before we met. no.
I-I--I'm amazed th-that you would even care
what my sister has to say
after everything that's happened with you two. i'm sorry. I just
no, I'm sorry. why don't you call me
when you're ready to trust me a little?
uh, yes, a table for two on the patio.
Oh, ok. yeah. yeah, I understand.
um, no problem. thanks.
uh, just--could you do me a favor?
could you tell your manager that "Mode" won't be needing
the Pemberly Inn for our big fashion week party,
where we spend many hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Oh, what's that?
something just opened up? great.
uh, it's Suarez-- s-u-a-r-e-z.
thank you.
Gio... your hair.
summer's coming. you gotta let the head breathe.
so where have you been?
um, around.
you know, just, uh, working,
and, uh, living.
uh, yep, working and living.
so the Pemberly Inn, huh? what's the occasion?
it's my birthday.
happy birthday.
Thanks.
so you going to dinner with Henry? uh-huh.
Yeah, uh, we were supposed to go away for the weekend,
but, uh, Charlie showed up. oh, the baby mama.
Yeah, but, it--but, it's fine. it's fine.
Henry and I are gonna have a perfect night
right here in manhattan-- an intimate dinner,
and then a concert
and fireworks in the park.
you know, the only thing missing is a carriage ride.
Yeah.
wait, a-a carriage ride?
Yeah. why'd you say that?
I don't know.
it just seemed like somethin' you'd be into.
it was good to see you.
you, too.
sorry we don't talk as much anymore.
Yeah, well, you know, just, uh, working and living.
Yeah. working and living...
you bitch. well, hello to you, too.
why are you trying to break up me and Daniel? Renee,
we both know what happens to you
when things get too serious with men.
this is nothing like Stony Brook.
good. it took a lot of work to clean up that mess.
I'm warning you
leave us alone or you will regret it, Wilhelmina.
I'm sure i'm not the only one around here with secrets.
Yes, Amanda. what's your favorite thing about getting old?
is it your hair thinning
or when kids ask you about vietnam?
can I help you with something? yeah, you know that guy
you're always pretending is your boyfriend?
he's on line two.
Hey, birthday girl. hi, i'm so glad you called.
I have a surprise for tonight.
one word--fireworks.
that's two words. no, technically, that's one worl.
Amanda, get off the phone.
well, I have a surprise for you, too. oh, Henry, I have to go.
my day's about to get a lot better,
but I'll call you back. I love you. bye.
Daniel, this is so sweet.
Oh, good. I mean, it better be,
cause I gotta tell you, Renee is really mad at me.
what is it with me and women, Betty?
it's like no matter what I do,
I'm always letting 'em down,
especially the ones I care about the most.
can you just make sure she gets that
as soon as possible?
OK, I'll send a messenger right away.
cupcakes? aw, that's so sweet,
but didn't you hear?
there isn't gonna be a birthday date.
Oh, didn't you hear?
Henry and Betty have a whole new plan for tonight
fancy dinner, romantic concert in the park,
and then afterwards,
well, you know what? that's great for them.
that Betty, she, uh,
sure doesn't let anything get in her way, does she?
no, she doesn't,
but if it does, I got her back.
these are not just decorative.
see ya.
so what do you think?
wow, mom, it'sso saucy.
I know...
and if you look closely, you can see a nipple imprint.
I've still got it.
so listen, mom,
we need to talk.
Oh, that sounds ominous. what is it?
it's about the budget for "hot flash.
given the current realities of the market,
I just--i can't put any more money into the project.
you're cutting me off?
w-we haven't even launched yet,
a-and I still need funding for a staff.
I'm sorry. don't do this to me. you're my daughter.
I'm also your boss.
Ooh. let me help you with that.
I got it. thank you.
wil said you'd be comin' by.
she sure is working you with all this baby stuff.
I know, but it's nothing
compared to what she must be going through,
planning for motherhood and all to
where is she, anyway? deep tissue massage.
Yeah, she skipped the baby c. p.r. class
and made Christina go alone. oh, oh. of course she did.
well, maybe the massage will help
circulate the ice in her veins.
Oh, oops. did I say that out loud?
no, honey, please, it's ok. I know how my sister is. hmm.
so, it is, uh, happy hour.
I was just about to make myself a drink.
you like chocolatinis?
liquor and chocolate? oh, gee, I don't know.
bring it.
Betty.
Mrs. Meade.
I'm so sorry.
I try to keep up the appearance that I never use the bathroom.
I hope you won't think less of me.
Ohum, no. no. I really, really won't.
are you ok?
Oh, my own daughter just told me
that she doesn't believe in my magazine. Alexis said that?
well, not in so many words, but it was pretty clear.
she thinks the magazine is just a fantasy, a pipe dream.
so I have decided not to move forward with "hot flash.
I'm calling it quits.
no. mrs. Meade, so what if it is a fantasy?
that doesn't mean you can't make it come true.
ju-just today, all of my dreams were crushed,
and I-I picked myself up,
I utilized my resources,
and now things are gonna be even better.
Betty, what resources do I have?
everyone I know has turned their back on me.
but you're the most resourceful person I know.
you can do anything.
you're very perky, you know that?
I've heard that before.
so what dreams of yours were crushed today?
well, it's my birthday... oh.
and there was a change in plans, but everything is fine.
Henry and I are going to dinner.
how do I look?
Oh, no, no. I couldn't.
Yes, you can.
Hey, it's Betty.
leave a message. I'll call you back.
Hey, Betty. I've got some bad news.
Charlie's not feeling well,
so i'm gonna have to take her to the doctor.
don't go to the restaurant. I'll meet up with you later.
Betty, I'm so sorry.
I love you.
one unheard message.
Betty
...go to the restaurant.
I'll meet up with you
I love you.
um, Suarez. reservation for two.
so Willie really got that girl to eat dog food?
Yeah, that girl was her best friend.
she called it a loyalty test.
portrait of a mean girl, age 15.
Wilhelmina's always been good at getting people to do things
they didn't want to do. she still is.
Really? Oh, yeah.
how so? Well, she practically forced Christina to carry this baby
so she could get the mon to save her husband's life. no!
Yes! and when Christina finds out who the sperminator is...
I thought it was an anonymous donor.
it's Bradford Meade. no.
she stole the sperm from his dead corpse,
and when the bastard heir is born,
she willfinally get her hands on a third of the Meade empire.
Mm. oh, I think i'm gonna vomit. excuse me.
thank you.
are you ready to order?
um, actually, no, not yet.
or, you know what?
um, I could start with a...
the, uh... uh, the--the cheese fondue.
that dish is for two people.
Oh. yeah. there will be two of us.
uh, my boyfriend is, uh, on the way. he's coming.
it is a lot of cheese.
we're hungry.
OK, one cheese fondue for you
and your boyfriend.
OK. ok, Henry. thanks for calling.
Henry is canceling on Betty?
Charlie's not feeling well. yeah, right.
beeyotch.
what? you know you guys were thinking it.
all right, familia Suarez. you know what this means.
Betty needs a party. I got the pinata.
I'll clear a dance floor. and i'm making the cupcakes.
and I was like, "slow your roll, mary-kate.
you just can't call dibs on every hot piece of..." pie.
gotta go.
that is so sweet of you. thank you.
Yeah, well, it's for Betty.
ha. what?
you just reminded me of q really funny story.
see, Betty's "boyfriend" called earlier,
and he is totally blowing her off
for their big birthday date tonight. see?
did you give her this message?
I'm a receiver, not a giver.
can I have that now?
how precious.
did you make it yourself?
it's a gift from Daniel, "with all his love.
Oh, you're not gonna ruin this relationship, Wilhelmina,
not unless you want your own dirty laundry out in the open.
whatever are you talking about? I know about Bradford's baby,
and your plan to get your claws into the Meade fortune.
Oh, I know about all of it. mm, you know nothing.
she stole the sperm from his dead corpse
and when the bastard heir is born,
she will finally get her hands
on a third of the Meade empire.
Oh, I think i'm gonna vomit.
last time I checked, sperm-stealing was illegal.
I think this is all Daniel's gonna need
to go straight to the police,
unless... unless what?
unless you leave me and daniel alone.
let me have what I want, and you can have what you want.
you really want to do this?
Oh, yes.
very well, then.
I'm gonna go spend the night at my boyfriend's.
madam
Mademoiselle, please. i'm only 24.
Yes, I'm so sorry.
see, it has been a while,
and it is friday night,
and we are very booked.
And?
there is a couple waiting for this table.
it is their anniversary.
it's my birthday,
and--and my boyfriend
he's not here.
may I offer you a doggie bag for the cheese?
Cheers.
Betty.
what are you doing here?
and why are you in a carriage?
Henry left a message with Amanda.
he can't make it tonight.
Charlie.
so I'm not trying to take his place or anything,
but when I heard you were on your own,
I remembered my cousin drives these things for tourists,
and I thought, she deserves to have a little fun.
so what do you say? want a ride?
I-I don't know, Gio.
come on. once around the block.
fine.
once around the block.
all right.
Willie, I know I screwed up,
but breaking into Daniel's apartment,
isn't that a felony? i'm too pretty for prison.
they'll pass me around like a collection plate
at a catholic church. stop whining. you owe me.
and prison is exactly where I'll end up
if they find out how this baby was really conceived.
I feel like you'd do well in prison. I would.
hmm. Now relax. you don't have to break in.
don't you think I would have had
an extra set of keys made for daniel's apartment?
Oh, Marc, you underestimate me. I hate myself even more.
OK, Willie, I'm going in.
but if I don't make it out alive...
we'll always have Bergdorf's, darling.
we all know what it's like to be ignored,
taken for granted,
not valued.
that is never going to happen
to the staff at "hot flash" magazine
because this isn't just a job.
it's a family.
speaking of family,
I'd like to introduce you all
to my beautiful daughter Alexis Meade.
hello.
can I talk to you for a sec?
mom, what's going on?
I thought I told you there's no money to hire a staff.
relax, darling, I don't need your money
or anyone else's. i'm using my own resources.
turns out there's a work program
for recently released inmates.
it's subsidized by the state, so my overhead is minimal.
they're prisoners?
Ex-prisoners... like me.
mom, do any of them have any experience?
they have life experience,
and that's what "hot flash" is all about
your life just changed. what do you do now?
I can't think of a better talent pool.
all right, let's get back to work.
Whew! Anybody have a fan? it is hot in here.
and then the weekend of my 10th birthday,
there was this blizzard,
so no one could get to the party,
and we couldn't leave the house,
so we had to eat leftover cake for weeks.
hmm. well, that's not so bad. yeah.
whoa. why are we stopping?
snowflake has to take care of some business.
Oh. sorry.
not quite the birthday you imagined, huh?
eh, it's my own fault.
I had this stupid fantasy
fireworks, epic romance... like romeo and juliet.
Oh, you know those two ended up dead in a tomb, right?
Yeah, I don't like thinking about that part.
all right. fantasies are fun, but we live in reality.
it's not perfect,
but it doesn't mean it can't be pretty good.
I know.
I know, I know, and--and--and it is.
I'm lucky,
except for the part where Henry's leaving me
after his baby's born.
it's getting late. I should get home.
no. you're not going home.
I'm not?
Nope. we're heading to central park.
we can still catch the end of that show.
Betty wants fireworks for her birthday,
she's gettin'fireworks.
Oh, Daniel Meade, you naughty, naughty boy.
what are you doing?
Oh, god.
I, uh, I'm...
I'm...
I want you.
excuse me?
you, you big, sexy... magazine editor.
I want you. I love you.
I've always loved you.
stop that. this smells like Wilhelmina.
no. it smells like the beginning of something beautiful.
I'm calling the police.
Oh! well, we'll always have this moment. ciao.
have you heard from Betty?
her phone's not working.
ay. here comes somebody.
is it her? no, I need more time. this banner is subpar.
ay, just hang it. who cares?
it's not Betty.
Hi. thought you were at the doctor.
I-I was. um, everything's fine.
they couldn't find anything wrong.
I think Charlie was just trying to ruin my night with Betty.
I can't believe I fell for it. me, either.
but this is your baby we're talking about.
what are you gonna do, right? thanks.
just glad I didn't miss Betty's party completely.
is she here? not yet. thank you.
I don't think we're gonna make it.
it sounds like it's almost over.
somebody had to stop for hot chocolate.
what? we're gonna make it, ok?
what was that?
crap. think I busted a wheel.
I'm gonna try to rig something up.
Oh, ok. well, here, I can help.
no, no. no. you stay in the carriage.
I don't want you to dirty your dress. oh--oh!
Betty! oh, no.
you ok? I'm ok.
I think I have a, uh...
napkin.
Thanks.
uh, i'm so sorry, Betty.
this night sucks, huh?
you're such a great girl.
you're so good and nice,
and you deserve to have an amazing birthday.
Gio, it's not your fault. you did everything you could.
it's fine.
no. no, it's not. I'm
you know, i'm not a big believer in this whole fantasy thing,
but I at least wanted you to have a little bit of yours.
I'm sorry.
I wasted your whole nigit.
you're not here with me
no, look. look!
fireworks.
you found Marc with your underwear?
this smells like Wilhelmina.
Oh, my--that is exactly what I said.
you know, look, I stupidly let her get to me this morng.
I messed up. I am sorry.
no, I'm sorry, too, Daniel...
because I haven't told you everything.
you can. trust me.
all right.
well, it was back in college
at Stony Brook.
I had a breakdown,
and I went to a treatment facility.
still see a shrink.
I take these every day.
it--it was a long time ago, you know,
but I guess i'm still a little sensitive about it.
thank you for telling me the truth.
but if you think for a second
that's gonna make me want to be with you any less,
you're wrong. really?
don't take that apartment. will you move in with me?
Oh, hell, yeah.
I wonder what mr. dull and sister crazy
are doing right now.
Ugh, don't look at me. I don't get straight people.
who puts what where? it's all so confusing.
Oh, speak of the she-devil.
Renee, what a surprise.
do you have a minute, Wilhelmina?
I'like to rub something in your face.
well, someone's already doing that right now, but go ahead.
Daniel and I are moving in together.
Yeah, he's out getting champagne to celebrate as we speak.
and, Willie, I know what you're up to.
did you really think I'd be so stupid
as to just leave that recording lying around?
well, you can't blame a girl for trying.
so if you or Marc interfere again,
I will release that recording to everyone,
and it'll be all over for you, Wilhelmina.
like I give a tinker's fart about that recording.
no one's gonna believe the rantings of a drunken fool.
Hey, feelings.
out.
and no one's gonna believe a crazy woman, either.
show me. are you sure those are the right pills?
they were the ones in thathideous green bag.
what did you replace them with? your fat-blockers.
they were the only ones that matched.
Oh, Marc, we want her crazy, not crazy and thin.
Oh, right.
well, no matter. those pills are all that stand
between my sister and the nuthouse.
in a few days, she'll start losing a grip on reality,
and then my plan will be in motion.
sorry, Renee.
I've got too much riding on this.
in.
you're home. Hilda and Justin are asleep,
and, uh, he wanted to wait for you.
I can't believyou guys did all of this and I missed it.
you didn't have to do anything special for me.
you know what? I think all of this was, um, more for me.
doing these kind of things makes me feel good
like i'm taking care of my little girl.
but you're a grown-up now.
you don't need me making cupcakes anymore.
Papi...
there will never be a day when I don't need cupcakes...
or you.
actually, I could really use one of those cupcakes
right about now.
well, I may have a few... dozen
left in the kitchen.
Really? mm-hmm.
Aah, you're the best.
Hey, Willie,
you know I've never been one to second-guess your choices,
but can I ask you a question, -to-friend? Marc, you know I hate
when things get personal between the two of us.
I do. I do. I know, but it's just...
what we're doing... I mean, Renee's your sister.
there are things in her past, Marc
you have no idea what she's done or what she's capable of.
Renee and I were
I know you think I'm the evil sister, Marc... well...
but at least I stop short of murder.
this is the best birthday present
I got all day.
Gracias, Mija.
Oh, I almost forgot...
what?
I'm supposed to make sure you get this.
Daniel? mm-hmm.
wh-when did he
he dropped it off a couple of weeks ago.
he just wanted to make sure he didn't forget.
he remembered he'd forget?
Oh, I'gonna call it a night.
happy birthday, sweetie.
thank you, daddy.
te quiero. I love you, too.
mm, Betty.
you're here.
Yeah, I didn't want to wake you.
hmm. I never got a chance to tell you
happy birthday.
thank you.
I'm sorry it wasn't perfect.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm sick. What are we talking about here?
$100, 000 for an experimental treatment.
we need to find a surrogate we can control
someone who's desperate for money. We're almost done. Have a look.
I really like this girl.
I take these. If you think that's gonna make me
want to be with you any less, you're wrong. Really?
will you move in with me? I'm so sorry.
I really thought I was getting better. I'm sorry, too.
Charlie, I didn't even know you were in town.
Charlie's not feeling well,
so I'm gonna have to take her to the doctor.
Hi. I thought you were at the doctor.
I think Charlie was just trying to ruin my night with Betty.
I love you. That's all that matters to me.
I'll be loving you forever
everything's so nice and romantic.
to us, Betty.
to us,
and to making the inst of the time we have left together.
Yeah.
Uh-oh. Am I too early?
I am so sorry.
I swear, I stayed out as long as I could.
Really? 'Cause you only left 15 minutes ago.
Oh, I had no idea. I can't wear a watch
because my arms are so bloated from carrying your child, so...
Oh, whoa.
what? Are you ok?
Oh, whoa, whoa. Um, so-so.
I just think my blood sugar might be low.
what do you need? Some food.
uh... Oh, this will work.
what? Uh... Mmm.
she's a monster.
I mean, we're at the movies, she calls ten times.
we're at dinner,
emergency text-- "I need flaxseed right away.
pregnant women are difficult.
Oh, please. We're bitches.
plus she also has it in for you, 'Cause you did steal her man.
wait. She cheated on Henry.
she didn't love him. I love him,
and I've got three weeks left with him,
and she is making it impossible for us to spend time together.
well, what about lunchtime? Oh, I know.
you could rent one of these "by the hour" hotel rooms.
free movies.
this is a good idea.
Ooh.
not the smutty hotel room, The lunch hour...
and I think Charlie Is busy In her prenatal yoga class.
Mm. That reminds me.
I've got the baby doctor this afternoon.
it's the end of the first trimester.
I just hope the doctor's not gonna say
it's ok to go running' or swimming or something.
Hello? Are you listening to me?
Yep--baby doctor, Trimester, hate exercising...
I have lunch plans with Henry.
where is she?
eating with Betty.
Oh, great.
we need the baby to be healthy, not flabby.
don't worry.
we'll put It on a juice fast the minute It pops out.
Oh. Listen, everything's gonna check out ok with the doctor,
and then monday, all hell will break loose
as the exiled queens Of "Mode..."
make their triumphant return. How are we doing on the press coverage?
I've pitched it
as a major fashion world announcement,
so all the women-friendly networks are in a lather.
"the View" is doing a special live broadcast,
which they never could've done
if potty-mouthed Rosie was still around.
good. I want this moment.
I need this moment.
all eyes on me... me.
you.
as I march up the steps of the meade building.
it'll be the greatest comeback since...
Jesus.
Blasphemous...
and sexy.
Hey, what's going on?
uh, thought we had a meeting with a photographer.
we did. Amelie bissou, she canceled.
photographers... They are so flaky, huh?
Yeah, this flaky photographer
won't come out of her bathroom
because someone... who works at this magazine
slept with her and never called.
what a jerk, huh?
Oh, no. She-she never gave me her number.
ever since Renee, you have been on a downward spiral
out every night, missing meetings... we think you may need some professional help.
you mean like a shrink? No way. No. I'm fine.
the woman you fell In love with almost killed your assistant
and burned your apartment down.
you are not fine. You need to talk to someone.
another voice could help.
papi, I love you, But your handwriting stinks.
what does this say?
well, there was a message on the machine from Coach Diaz.
he wants to talk to you about Justin...
and this is perfect penmanship. You need your eyes checked.
Justin! What does Coach Diaz want?
remember when I told you that coach Diaz is a total jerk
and the meanest gym teacher I've ever had? Yeah, you told me.
you told everybody. Now he's gonna fail me in gym.
what about all those notes I wrote excusing you from class? He doesn't care.
he said that every student has to fulfill a "P. E.Requirement.
well, every student should... but not you.
you're special.
coach Diaz does not get me.
well, don't you worry. He is gonna get you,
because my taxes pay his salary, which means I'm his boss. OK.
Hilda, I don't think you paid any taxes last year.
so Amelie Bissou Is out of the bathroom,
and the photo shoot is back on.
that's great. It only took an hour on the phone with her agent,
tripling her fee,
and you are not allowed anywhere near the photo studio
on the day. Betty, you're the best.
Daniel, I know that part of my job
is following you around and cleaning up your messes,
but ever since Renee,
there just isn't A pooper-scooper big enough.
you've been talking to my mom and sister? As your unofficial, occasional therapist,
I think that it would be
a really good idea for you to see somebody.
I am not gonna go see a therapist.
I am doing fine on my own, Betty. According to reliable Internet sources,
the definition of an Insane person
one who or that which performs the same actions over and over again expecting different results.
insanity or optimism.
if you want things in your life to be different,
you must do things differently.
therefore, If your instincts are telling you
not to go to therapy, then go to therapy.
your appointment's at 2: 00 With Dr. WalLace.
I didn't say yes.
Henry, you ready for our lunch date?
um, I would be, but Charlie called,
and her yoga partner canceled.
so I have to
Betty?
you do realize she's doing this on purpose, don't you? Yes.
she's trying to get In between us because she hates me. No. No, no, no. She doesn't hate you.
look, Betty, I'm sorry.
I guess I hoped that you guys could be friends. Friends? Friends?
how can I be friends with her
when she is always trying to get in between us,
over and over and over again? I know.
she will never stop...
unless... Unless what?
unless I do things differently.
Where's Henry?
he can't make It,
so I'm here to be your yoga partner
and your friend.
Betty, no.
we can't be yoga partners or friends.
Charlie, don't you remember when we first met?
I bought you a brownie.
Charlie, we could go back to those times, the brownie times.
look, brownie!
well, I've got gestational diabetes,
so I could die If I ate that, OK? But thank you.
welcome to baby bump yoga.
let's start with downward dog.
so you're having a natural childbirth.
is that like a pool or a bathtub or-- Go away. Now.
Shh!
good job, guys.
excuse me. Are you coach Diaz?
Yeah. Can I help you?
you're the gym teacher?
Yes, and you are?
I am Justin Suarez' mother. I guess you heard he's failing.
I did hear, and I think there's been a big mistake,
because I have been sending notes
asking that Justin be excused from P. E. so...
you know, tell me, when you were in school,
did you get excused from math class with a note
or english class? Not officially because I would skip those,
is is not math... or english.
well, I believe fitness and exercise
are just as important. Yes, but my Justin is not really an athlete.
well, luckily you don't have to be an athlete
to be in my class.
he just needs to show up, make an effort.
okay, let's just... get right to It.
if you fail Justin,
I'm gonna talk to the principal.
great. You should swing by his office,
schedule an appointment. Hey, I am not joking here.
Oh, neither am I.
ms. Suarez, I have a master's in Wellness training.
I just happen to believe
that everyone can benefit from a gym class, even you.
whoa. What is that supposed to mean?
do not turn your back on me.
this is not over. I pay your salary, coach Diaz!
you know what?
I read that babies born in water
have higher I. Q.S than the babies
Oh, my god. Please stop.
okay, partners. Grab your mommy's waist. Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Betty, don't touch me! But that's what she told me
okay, you two with the bad energy--out!
you're still touching me.
I'm sorry.
I know that your situation at the moment is not ideal.
Oh. Oh, It Is far from ideal.
this weekend I was supposed to be at home In Tucson
having a baby shower with my friends,
so unless you want to-- Throw you a baby shower?
what? Wasn't that what you were jt about to say?
unless I want to throw you a baby shower? Do you want To throw me a baby shower?
um, yes. When?
tomorrow.
Wow. You're not at all what I expected.
when I heard the name "Dr. WalLace,
I thought it would be a guy.
but then I thought, No, don't be closed-minded.
it could be an old lady, too.
so what exactly are you hoping to get out of therapy? A date?
have you been depressed?
nothing a drink with you wouldn't cure.
get out. Wha--seriously?
I'm not In the business of wasting my time with patients
who aren't prepared to take therapy seriously.
when you're ready to face up to your emotions
and talk about them Like an adult, you can return.
until then, good-bye.
so?
everything's fine. The fetus Is healthy and growing,
and you'll be giving birth In six months. So I can go back to work?
Absolutely. You can work. You can exercise
let's just stick with the work.
so is it safe to start telling people we're pregnant?
sure. Tell whoever you want-- friends, family...
400 members of the news media. Thank you, Dr. Weiss.
Christina, put your muumuu on. We'll meet you in the lobby.
Oh, do you want a video of the sonogram? Uh, don't care.
Marc, call Barbara at P. M. K.
pretty Barbara, not freckly Barbara. On It.
quite a driven woman, isn't she?
she's a bitch.
that, too.
Oh. why does that say "Meade/Slater Baby"?
don't worry. That's just for your file.
I'm sure it must be strange
carrying the child of a dead man.
Betty.
Oh, Henry. Hey.
guess what?
for her shower, Charlie wants her favorite tamales
from this place in Tucson, and I tracked them down. Wait, her shower?
Oh, yeah, I'm throwing Charlie a baby shower,
so that she'll see me as a friend
and let you and I spend more time together.
you would do that? I am doing it.
get this--so Escobar's-- Do you know the place? Yeah.
well, they won't ship their tamales overnight
ruins the flavor--so I have to buy them a seat on a plane. It sounds like that's a lot of work.
it is, but I don't mind. It's for us,
and when you want something bad enough,
you work harder.
Oh.
Oh, thank you for calling me back.
it's Escobar's. I have to take this. Oh, yeah.
so, um, my first question is,
can the tamales fly coach?
look, I'm sorry about before.
it's just, I... I like to flirt.
and what do you get out of flirting?
I don't know.
is it approval? Yeah, I guess.
feels good to be wanted?
guess I need that right now.
Why?
there was this woman...
I just wanted so badly for things to be different,
for me to... Find something... Deeper.
instead I ended up with nothing.
I think this is something we should explore.
what is keeping her?
I'm due at SerGio Rossi to pick out new work shoes.
Oh, these scottish types-- No concern for time.
if Tilda Swinton says 7: 30,
do not expect her before 10: 00. Christina.
Johan, please come to the outpatient surgical center.
where is she?
maybe the bathroom? Ugh. These scottish types.
if Tilda Swinton says she has to pee
no. She knows It's Branford's baby.
she's gone.
they're arriving at LaGuardia on flight 47?
perfect. A messenger will be waiting. Thank you.
is It crazy that I'm flying In tamales from Tucson
because that's what Charlie Wants to eat at her baby shower?
okay, stop begging. I'll come. What?
huh? I didn't say anything. You just said You'd come to the shower.
why would I say I'd come to the shower? I don't know, Amanda.
do you want to come to the shower?
do I want to come to the shower
for someone I don't even know?
why would I do that? What are you serving?
well, tamales, a bunch of fun little appetizers,
and my dad is making empanadas.
okay, well, that's crazy.
don't cancel the shower just because I'm not coming.
let me see what I can do.
he gave you detention?
gym detention.
what Is "Gym Detention"?
it got Invented today for me.
I had to organize the equipment room.
there were balls and bats.
it was like a nightmare that would never end.
this Is all your fault. Well, I was just trying to help you out.
you came to my school and yelled at my teacher.
what did you think would happen? Okay, look. I can fix this.
please don't.
he might make me quarterback of the hockey team or something.
Hey. What if I change my approach?
Oh, my god, mom. No.
this is all getting very "Sweeney Todd" now.
so, Christina,
I would love to sit and chat
and clear up this whole misunderstanding.
call me.
I'm worried sick about you.
even I didn't believe that.
well, you are your toughest critic.
what a screwup.
remind me to get that stupid doctor's license revoked.
done. By the time we're through with him,
he'll be neutering dogs in Buffalo.
this is bad, Marc.
if she disappears,
if that baby disappears, we've got nothing.
no baby means no return to "Mode,
means no future for either of us.
Oh, Willie, why can't things just be easy for once?
on the surface, our plans are rock sid,
and we're both so attractive.
perhaps that's our curse, Marc
that and our humanity.
I was so stupid to trust her!
there's no way you could've known.
Stuart, this Is the worst thing that could happen.
Oh.
or Is It the best thing?
no, I'm serious.
we know that she was willing to pay all that money for this...
Yeah. Enough for my operation.
so?
so maybe she'll pay more.
you're thinking she's got you. I say you've got her.
when that thing inside you-- Stuart that "Thing" Is going to be a baby.
well, she needs it,
and when people need something,
that makes them weak.
okay, what just happened?
I looked over at you,
and there was a silence, anthe next thing I know-- You kissed me.
no, no, no, you kissed me. Doctor, you lunged at me-- Because you seduced me.
I didn't do anything. Oh, you can't help it.
you're a seducer. That's what you do. But it's not working for me anymore.
who are you calling?
my shrink.
but I--look, I'm so sorry.
I-I promise, I'll pay you for this. And now I feel Like a whore. Super.
derrick, I need to see you right away. I'm coming over now. I'm the one who needs help.
you showed me this. What am I supposed to do now? I don't know.
you're not my problem anymore. You'ren animal.
leave, please.
go out, find women and ruin their lives.
uh, listen, Ms. Suarez,
it's very nice of you to offer to cut my hair,
but I'm happy just to talk about Justin.
it's--it's my job.
Oh, please, it's nothing. It's nothing. Here.
it's just my way of saying we got off on the wrong foot.
you know, And I-I didn't mean anything
about you needing a gym class.
you got a great body.
not that I was looking at your body.
Oh, yeah, right. Right.
I mean, you're the parent, I'm the teacher.
I mean, I'm the parent.
Oh, gosh, sorry. I just-- I get a little bit worked up
over Justin sometimes. Hey, don't worry about it. It's your kid. I get it.
look, if it makes you feel any better,
I swear to you that I would never do anything
to embarrass him.
thank you. That does make me feel better.
Mm.
you were gonna
Oh, yeah.
okay. This is a great place.
Oh, thank you. Yeah, we just o-- Oh!
Aah!
Oh, my god! Let me see. No! Uh, no. Tha--I-It's OK.
let me get some alcohol. Oh, wow.
here. That's nail polish remover.
Yeah, but it--it--it sanitizes. It's OK. Don't worry about it. I'm fine, OK?
I'm just gonna go bleed at home. Oh.
Oh, man.
Oh. Ugh. Hilda.
um, no. No, I'm looking at the plates right now.
they are definitely not what I ordered.
these have father time on them
father time, not a baby.
he has a beard.
look, I'm sorry I'm being such a pain.
I am generally a much nicer person.
I just
my fault.
I know.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Meade.
Oh, Betty, it's fine.
it's a purse, not a baby.
once in Nantucket,
I dropped Daniel in a bucket of ice,
landed on his head.
okay.
uh, well, He should be fine now.
I got him to see the therapist.
I heard. Thank you for that. Oh, don't worry about it.
just another one of the many things
I had to do today.
Betty, when are you going to stop? I can't.
I agreed to throw this last-minute baby shower
for Charlie, Henry's pregnant ex-girlfriend. Oh, right. That ordeal.
Yeah. Well, It's not really an ordeal.
it's just, you know,
something I have to do to spend time with Henry.
I mean, he's leaving in three weeks and--aah. Ow!
why did you do that?
to get your attention. Wake up, Betty.
this relationship you are in has no future,
and the sooner you realize that,
the sooner you'll get back to living your life,
instead of planning baby showers
for your boyfriend's ex-girlfriends.
Henry, it's over.
Ugh. it just doesn't sound right.
I mean, this is Henry. I don't want it to be over.
this jacket makes me look like a nerd.
why do you need to apologize to this guy in person?
I can't just call Coach Diaz.
I nearly maid him for life.
and Justin needs to pass gym, so...
now I look like a slutty nerd.
I don't think this has anything to do with Justin.
what are you talking about? oh, come on, Hilda.
first, you pick a fight with this guy.
then you invited him over for a haircut?
you know what this is?
this is Hector Reale from nine grade all over again.
that is ridiculous.
I did not give Hector Reale a haircut. I know what you gave him.
come on, Hilda.
you totally like this coach guy.
what's his name? Coach Diaz.
what's his first name?
coach?
well, you should fix that,
because it's gonna sound really weird
when you guys are kissing
and you're all like, "ooh, Coach. ooh.
shut up! stop talking about it. "oh, Coach.
there's not gonna be any kissing.
ay, you're getting me all freaked out. Hilda.
I don't know, Betty. I just
I felt something when I was talking to him,
and it was just the first time since Santos.
you have a crush...
and I have Henry.
check us out.
who is that? I don't know.
it's--it's not time. we're not ready.
we need to talk.
all we've been doing lately is obsessing
about how little time we have left together.
I know, and it's horrible,
and it's so stressful for the both of us,
and I-I don't--I
that's why I'm here.
I think there's only one thing to do. oh, god.
we have to stay together forever.
Oh! that's not what I thought you were gonna say,
but I like it! go on.
my cousin Lance just got a new job at Transwest airlines.
he says I can use his friends and family discount.
I have to do his taxes for 20 years,
but I can see you every other weekend. Really?
and--and once in a while, you can come out and see me.
or we could meet in the middle.
Yes. yes. god, I love you.
the middle just happens to be springfield, missouri,
A. k.a. queen city of the ozarks,
renowned throughout america for having
the most varied weather in the nation. I love weather.
I know you do.
and in the meantime,
we can call or--or e-mail or video chat.
it--it's the 21st century.
we can see each other every day if we want to
Wow. you really thought about this.
you're the most important thing in my life.
Oh, god. it's 11: 00. Charlie--her baby shower.
Oh. I guess it's too late to call it off.
are you kidding? Now it's even more important.
Charlie will be part of my life forever.
Charlie, welcome to your baby shower.
Henry.
I was just leaving. You ladies have fun.
Bye.
I'm late because your directions were messed up.
Wow. I don't remember your house being so small.
something smells really funny.
come on in.
Stuart.
Stuartrt.
Hello, Christina.
how did you find me?
I called her. it was the right thing, Christina.
you don't have a lot of options.
nyet options.
but what Stuart was savvy enough to recognize
is you do have power.
I need this baby, Christina,
and I will pay to ensure you follow through with this.
what do you want?
nothing.
Christina
no. don't.
she'll be back.
she has nowhere else to go.
thank you.
Thanks.
welcome... Amanda.
calm down. I can only stay for, like, five minutes.
I have a million things to do today.
what's that?
uh, shrimp empanadas in mole sauce.
my dad made 'em this morning.
it's pretty good. wish I didn't have to leave.
is there more?
Betty? Hey, Betty?
yes?
what is that?
Oh, uh, that is a pinata.
I thought it would be really fun. Well, the plastic lining chokes the birds
that feed at the landfills. oh, uh
and I'm sorry,
but are these vegetables fresh cut?
because they sure don't look like it.
um, well, I could cut some now.
that'd be great.
why is everyone so fat at this party?
Betty, you don't seem like you're having much fun.
Yeah, well, I just gotta let that go,
because I'm the one who decided to throw Charlie this party.
besides, Henry and I have found a way
to make it work long-distance.
long-distance?
dad, I know that voice.
the skeptical, i-know-better-than-you voice
that you trot out every time you think I'm making a mistake,
and Hilda used to get it more often.
look, I'm sure you have a great plan.
all I'm saying is that long-distance is no replacement
for spending time together.
Henry will be back and forth all the time.
he said I was the most important thing in his life.
amor, the thing is, he's having a baby,
and once you're a parent,
nothing's ever the same.
it'll be hard work, but we can do it.
Daniel. can I borrow some money?
what are you doing here?
uh, therapy, uh, didn't exactly work out.
uh, y-yeah. I can see that. what happened?
I slept with her. then I went out.
I met this girl at a club,
went back to her apartment, where I met her roommate,
who took me out to another club,
where I met these russian ballerinas.
they turned out to be strippers,
and I woke up somewhere in queens,
um, and I lost my wallet. Betty.
Christina. um, I really need to talk to you.
um-- is there soy milk?
and why do these plates have an old man on them? ugh. uh, um, ok.
uh, Daniel, borrow cab fare from my dad.
dad, go to the market. get soy milk.
Christina, upstairs now.
sounds like you had, uh, quite a night.
Yeah.
wanna take a walk? sure.
good. come on.
and I-I don't know what to do.
Betty, she's done this to me before,
and I can't believe I've been so stupid.
okay, first of all, stop blaming yourself.
Ohh. This is Wilhelmina.
this is what she does. she uses people.
I know, I know, and that I can cope with.
but this time, it's not just me. there's gonna be a baby.
Christina, there is a difference between you and her.
Oh, is there?
Yes, you are a good person.
Really?
really.
Betty! are there tamales or not?
I'll be right there!
she is annoying.
you know what they say
about pregnant women being so beautiful?
well, I have a question.
what if you're already really beautiful?
is it possible to become too beautiful?
I mean, is it dangerous? Could you hurt someone?
ladies, straight from tucson, arizona
especially for Charlie
Escobar's famous green corn tamales!
no. Charlie?
here. take that.
this isn't the right tamale.
Yes, it is. I think I would know, Betty.
those are from escobar's. They wouldn't even ship them,
so I had to have them flown out. Then they got ruined on the plane.
they flew first-class. Well, they're soggy.
you know what, Charlie?
I have broken my back to try and make this shower happen.
Yeah, well, maybe that's the way you want it to look.
no, that is the way it is.
this isn't what I wanted, Betty.
well, I'm sorry that this isn't good enough for you, Charlie,
but I have worked really hard,
and now I feel stupid for even try to be nice to you
when you have been such a jerk.
and I don't know why
I'm letting your crabby little attitude get to me,
because Henry and I have already decided that
we're gonna be together even after he goes back to tucson,
whether you like it or not!
what? nothing to say?
no. my water just broke.
um, are you sure your water broke?
either that or I just peed my pants.
okay, I see how you're playing this.
I remember last new year's eve,
I was so drunk that my water broke, too.
Oh, I just had a contraction. good idea. stick with your story.
um, ok. uh, all right. um, everything's gonna be ok.
just, uh, sit. sit down and--and try to relax. okay.
breathe. okay.
Hi. how's your ear?
eh, just a couple of stitches.
the good news is, it doesn't stick out as far anymore.
I'm so sorry,
and I-I totally hear you about gym class,
so maybe Justin should go. Maybe I could meet you halfway.
what do you have in mind? He helps choreograph the cheerleading routines
for the rest of the year, he passes.
think he'd be into that? Are you kidding?
he calls espn "the cheerleading channel.
he's gonna love . Wow.
thank you, Coach Diaz.
you're welcome.
Hey, um, what's your first name, anyway?
Tony. I'm Hilda.
nice to meet you, Hilda.
you, too.
you know, Daniel, when I was a young man,
I was a lot like you.
well, maybe not as much like you
as I would have liked,
but it wasn't until I felt good about myself
that I met someone special.
so what happened?
mole happened.
is that a girl?
no.
it's a sauce that everyone makes with chilies
and garlic and peppercorns and chocolate and broth,
and that's how I would make it.
until one day I thought
I wonder how molasses would make this taste.
so I add molasses,
serve it to my boss,
eyes pop out of his head
the best thing he's ever tasted,
and I saan "i know.
because I knew that it was special, unique.
so what, you want me to cook something?
no way.
cooking was my passion.
it changed the way I felt.
what makes you feel good about yourself?
you're right. I don't have any options.
so I've decided to take you up on your offer.
there is something that I want from you.
and what is that?
this is the heartbeat of the child that I'm carrying.
I want you to watch it,
and for once in your monstrous life
for you to think about someone else,
because this baby is not just some instrument
for whatever wicked game it is that you're playing.
it's your child, and what I want from you is a promise
that you will love this baby,
and you will give it everything that it needs.
Ohh, god, this really hurts!
does it hurt?
I just said that it does.
you know, a few years ago, I had some work done on my nose.
it was not a nose job.
everybody thought it was a nose job,
but it was just to fix some breathing
had to get it done, not a nose job
and it was so painful. it was just like childbirth. I'm sorry.
are you gonna be here the whole time?
whatever you need,
because I know what you're going through.
okay, well, I'm kind of thirsty, so...
mm, that remin me-- I am starving.
okay, guys, uh, thanks for coming.
I just left Henry a message. he must be in the subway. okay.
Oh! oh, yes. taxi's here.
come on. let's get you to the hospital. no, no, no, no, no, not a hospital. no.
I'm going to a birthing center. I have a midwife.
you know, I want to do this all natural. no drugs.
I want to feel everything! oh, god!
okay, uh, well, then let's get you to the birthing center.
we just needo get you out the door and in the cab. okay.
look, you're doing it.
you're doing it. you're doing it.
I'm doing it. ohh, god! I'll call your midwife.
no, don't do that! why?
because I don't want her to hear me say this
I want the drugs. what?
I want the drugs, Betty. call the hospital.
call the ambulance. I want the drugs!
um, 9-1-1, we have a woman in labor.
she wants the drugs.
I don't want to be here when that thing pops out of her.
Bye.
Betty, is the ambulance here?
any second.
okay. okay, and Henry?
he's on his way.
hold my hand.
what?
hold my hand.
why'd you do it, Betty?
why did you throw me a shower?
because you're away from home, stranded
Oh, Betty, that is bull!
Ow! okay, maybe that's not why.
maybe I did it because I thought that if I was friendlier,
you would stop getting in the way
of Henry and I so much.
I'm so sorry, Betty. I am so sorry.
but do you know how hard it was watching the guy that I love
falling in love with somebody else?
is that why you cheated on him?
Charlie, I'm so sorry.
no, no, no, it's not your fault. I just...
I never thought it would be like this, you know?
I never thought I'd be having a baby... alone.
no. no, no, no, you're not alone.
hurry. right in here.
Oh, thank god. they're here. the ambulance is here.
what do you do with these? where do you begin?
I see exactly what you mean. the photos just sit there. yes.
they need a point of view. mm-hmm.
can I weigh in?
you look like hell.
Yeah, I know.
Ooh. these are not very good.
no. no.
we could saturate the colors, make 'em pop,
that way we focus on the outfits instead of the models... mm-hmm.
so it's strictly about the fashion. yeah, that's great.
I was also thinking,
we always put the photo essays in the back of the book.
why don'we move 'em in the front?
you know, stir things up a little.
well, look at you. what happened, Daniel?
I realized something.
I mean, I'm always looking for meaning in my life
everywhere but the place I can actually find it
right here.
I love this job.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're over 9 centimeters.
I don't think it's a good idea to move you. here. I'll get some towels.
Oh, god, this really hurts.
I know, but you're o far along for the drugs.
it's gonna be the old-fashioned way.
Oh, the old-fashioned way, just like you wanted.
Oh, shut up, Betty!
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. you know I don't really mean that.
I just can't believe I'm having a baby in your living room.
it's ok. it's ok. it's ok, Charlie.
Charlie?
Henry? Oh, thank you so much, Betty.
Henry, Henry, Henry. god, you have no idea.
Betty's kept me from totally freaking out.
Oh, my god. oh, my god. this is really happening.
okay. it's gonna be ok. it's gonna be ok.
no, no, no, no, no. stay, Betty. stay if you want. stay.
Yeah, Betty, please stay. no... you're gonna be ok.
it's good to have you back, Daniel.
to work.
to Meade publications.
to family.
what the hell is that?
that is a sonogram of my baby,
of your father's baby.
what are you talking about? I'm having your father's child.
Oh my god.
and I want you to know,
my only concern is protecting this baby
and giving it everything it deserves.
Yeah, and what would that be?
one-third of the Meade empire.
Oh, my god. ohh!
here you go, sweetie. no.
one hell of a baby shower.
it's a boy.
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
you're a papa now.
Oh, felicidades.
our baby.
you're the gym teacher? - yes.
is there any chance that you know who my father is?
I didn't see anything but the tweety bird tattoo on his ass gene simmons is my father.
daddy? - Daughter?
I'm having your father's child.
my only concern is giving it everything it deserves.
and what would that be?
one-third of the meade empire.
Henry, you're not in tucson. - I'm going back.
what?
my brother's totally macking on your girlfriend.
I'm not a big believer in this whole fantasy thing, but I at least wanted you to have a little bit of yours.
I'm lucky, except for the part where henry's leaving me after his baby's born.
all by myself don't wanna be all by myself anymore oh, god.
did you hear her crying last night?
ay, it's only been two weeks, papi.
she loved henry. She needs to go through this.
I just wish there were something we could do.
there is. You can buy more tissues.
Hilda, you're out of your puffy eye cream stuff. Sorry.
Oh, don't worry, aunt betty. I'm on it.
well, I hope you're hungry, 'cause you're just in time for "eggs a la hilda."
what's "eggs a la hilda"?
it's scrambled eggs.
papi, I don't want to hear it. You're sick. I'm making breakfast.
Hilda, I'm not very hungry.
you've barely eaten since henry went back to tucson.
it's true, aunt betty. You've been looking really skinny.
that's supposed to sound bad.
guys, you're all being so sweet, but I do not want you worrying about me, okay?
Henry and I agreed a clean break would be best.
you know, when I break up with a guy...
I like to get a little bit scary so he doesn't forget me.
all right, justin, come on. We gotta go.
I gotta get ready for the P. T. A. Thing this morning.
since when are you on the P. T. A?
since she has a crush on my gym teacher.
what? Who? Tony? He's okay. Why? Did he say something? Do you think he likes me?
what's not to like?
Oh, my god. He's such a good...
what Is this? - It's juice.
mija, you seem tired.
can't you take a little time off work?
no. Are you kidding?
work is the only thing that kind of keeps my mind off of henry.
I'm secretly hoping the "mode" drama doesn't end.
will the drama at "mode" ever end?
fashion diva and headline stealer wilhelmina slater is back on the scene with child...ish.
she'll be using an unnamed surrogate to birth the baby.
Wilhelmina... a mother again?
she's certainly been called one.
the babe was confirmed to be the spawn ofradford meade, who gifted wilhelmina with his frozen swimmers just before his death.
and they say romance is dead.
will la slater return to "mode"?
will the baby own a share of the meade fortune?
insiders tell me the meades are fighting her tooth and french tip nail with a legal decision expected this morning.
no, daniel is not available.
we will be releasing a statement this afternoon.
any news yet?
no, they're on the phone with the lawyer right now.
I don't know. Maybe the news will be good.
maybe wilhelmina will have lost.
Wilhelmina never loses.
Oh, why did I agree to have this baby?
Christina, you didn't have a choice.
you needed the money for stuart's operation.
Claire meade looked at me.
she hates me. I don't blame her.
she doesn't hate you.
and she'll totally understand. Look, look, look. They're coming out now. just take a deep breath...
look her in the eye and just explain it...
so. Is it bad?
it's terrible.
our father's will divided the company evenly among his children.
unfortunately, that includes future children?
none of this makes any sense.
Bradford never wanted to have another child, and now to have one with her?
it's happening, and until that kid turns 18, wilhelmina controls a third of this company.
so... that means?
Wilhelmina is back.
let's do this bitch.
if she tries anything, call security.
I can take her.
what? I can.
whatever happens, I'm right here.
family meade, I just want to say, how thrilled and honored I am to be back here.
today is a new day, and I hope we can all put the past behind us.
wonderful seeing you all.
Oh, now that was fun.
am I smiling? I can't tell.
I think you are.
Oh, willie...
it's so good to be back and to have health insurance again, because I have this weird mole thing.
but daniel still runs "mode," and alexis still runs meade.
what's our next move?
to divide the house meade.
we'll start with the weakest link.
did you see the look on daniel's face? terror.
if there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate fear.
you are a horror movie I wish would never end.
I can't believe this is happening.
I mean, I've had nightmares about her coming back.
they usually end with her stabbing me with a stiletto and turning into a--poof! Bat.
Daniel, keep it together.
how can I? She's been after my job since I started here.
well, she's not gonna get it, so stop panting.
Wilhelmina has no creative input here whatsoever.
she's nothing more than a chanel suit with an office.
Yes, but she's one-third of this company, and she's got the devil on her side.
Yeah, but the devil doesn't get a vote.
there's two of us, and there's one of her.
do you know what?- You're right. It's two against one.
exactly, so relax.
we won't make a move without one another.
Mrs. Meade, I'm taking lunch orders. Could I get you something?
actually, I was just about to call you.
there is something you can do for me.
you can write an article for "hot flash.
an article? - Yes.
I'm short four pages of content.
now I know "hot flash" is a magazine for older women, but you could give it its youth perspective.
300 words by tomorrow morning.
Yeah. Okay.
uh, I can do this.
so, like, when you say, "youth perspective,"
what does that mean exactly? - Betty, betty, you're the writer.
figure it out.
I'm the writer.
okay. Uh, okay.
Oh, and, mrs. Meade? Thank you.
you're welcome.
mad props on the dramatic entrance.
I wanted to use a strobe light as we hit the tube, but wil said it was over-the-top.
O-m-g, we have so much to catch up on.
I know. - Me first.
you know how I've been working with my father, gene simmons from kiss, on a new reality show?
well, prepare yourself.
this is the story, the story is true how I found my daughter, he never even knew she tracked me down with only one clue. it was on my butt that fateful tattoo on my butt. what? What?
daddy's little girl.
you're gonna be a reality tv star.
it's what every pretty girl with no specific talent dreams of.
I know, right?
and every episode, we do a new fun, father-daughter activity.
you know, like camping or riding bikes or trashing a hotel room.
Oh, you know what?
every successful tv show has a shticky, gay best friend sidekick.
no. No, no, marc. You can't be on the show.
come on. Why not? Marc and amanda. We're so funny together.
everyone says so. - Okay.
there's no other way to tell you this-- you know how, in real life, you're always so jumpy and bopping your head and moving around... like...
well, that makes you blurry, and on tv, people can actually see your face.
you're cute, but you're not tv cute.
I am so glad I got that off my chest. I feel so much better.
you wanna watch it again? - Sure.
okay, eight turkey, six veggie, four chicken curry salad and two salami.
man, you sure are hungry today.
Hey, that's the first time I've ever gotten a smile off that joke.
well, today has turned out to be not so terrible.
Claire meade asked me to write an article for "hot flash.
Hey, that's a big deal.
Yeah. I guess it is a big deal.
here, have a black-and-white cookie.
I haven't even told anybody yet.
Oh, I'm the first person you told, huh?
figures.
what does that mean?
you tell me everything. - No, I don'T.
Yes, you do. - No, I don'T.
Oh, yes, you do. - No, I don'T.
Oh, yes, you do.
you're always down here, telling me about your day, flirting, ordering sandwiches...
uh, it's a sandwich shop, and I wasn't flirting.
Oh, come on.
every time I turn around, you're there.
you know, you're kind of stalking me a little bit.
what?
you like me. There's nothing wrong with that. Just admit it.
you are insane.
come on. You'll feel better if you say it out loud.
you want me to be your rebound guy.
I came down here for sandwiches, and all of the sudden, you're my rebound guy?
Gio, I just got out of a relation
the youth perspective.
youth.
I wasn't flirting.
the Youth Perspective
guess who ordered the tongue at Gio's deli?
Betty whorez is out of control!
as far as the november cover is concerned, I was...
I'm sorry I'm late. I must not have gotten the memo.
no, wilhelmina. You weren't invited.
I realize that, and I was speaking to my lawyer, and apparently, I have every legal right to observe.
okay, fine, but you have no official capacity at "mode," and that means zero input.
I understand.
I'm merely someone who controls one-third of the parent corporation, which owns everything and everyone in here.
but you won't even notice me.
quiet as a mouse.
Oh, my god. It looks like she's eating him. I'm gonna pee.
she does realize that that's the sandwich guy and not an actual sandwich, right?
Oh, mandy, how I've missed this.
I know you two sent that picture around, and I just want to say
Betty, we are so glad you finally found a rebound guy.
I mean, you and henry?
mismatch one time I saw him changing his shirt in the bathroom, and I wasn't staring, and I definitely did not take a picture, but for a nerd accountant, he has body karate.
but gio smells like salami.
and he's perfect for you!
gio is not my rebound guy, and I have an article to write today, so I don't have time for your games.
if you could just write a retraction e-mail, send it out
Betty, gio loves you.
and that's a direct quote from the stall in theen's room.
now for the november cover, I was thinking we'd be a little bit more bold.
ladies, gentlemen, I give you...
the war-- the war issue-- the war issue.
sexy soldiers surrounded by danger.
definitely gonna keep the focus on fashion, but, uh, with a bit more political edge, as well.
I don't know. It seems a little too risky.
I think it's fantastic.
you don't get to talk.
uh, wait, uh, you think it's good?
I think it's genius.
in fact, it's so genius that "elle" is doing the exact same thing, uh, a month earlier, but I'm sure you've got some terrific backup ideas.
Yeah. Yes, I do. Of course.
um, we could...
the backup ideas for the cover...
we're thinking, uh, we might...
Yeah.
uh, why don't we, uh, just take five minutes?
uh, I'll be right back.
get it together, daniel. Come on.
aren't you supposed to be in a meeting?
Wilhelmina is in there, and she is freaking me out.
what are you doing in the men's room?
there was a graffiti situation.
marc wrote a very raunchy poem about me and gio.
it was more of a haiku, really.
anyway, I took care of it.
shouldn't you be writing your article?
how do you know about that?
did you tell your mother to give me that article?
I know I'm self-involved, but even I could tell you needed some cheering up...
and besides, you're gonna do great.
great? I haven't written anything yet.
I've had a few distractions.
well, stop that. Get back in there and start writing.
fine. You get back in there and run that meeting, and don't let wilhelmina get to you.
Yeah. We can do this.
Yes, we can.
uh, that was unexpected.
Yeah. Let's pretend that that didn't happen.
here you go.
Oh, hey, hilda.
what brings you by?
Oh, yeah, I was just doing a P. T. A. Thing this morning.
I'm really big on volunteering. Anything for the kids.
anyway, I got turned around in here. This place is like a maze.
didn't you go here?
you're so funny.
so what's up, tony? What's shaking? What's new?
just P. E.
fun. Fun. I love sports, you know?
too bad there's not a big game on tonight, 'cause I got nothing to do.
nothing. Nothing at all.
we're short a chaperone for the school dance. I...
Yeah, I could do that, totally.
anything for the kids, you know?
why di't you tell me there was a dance?
I'm not going.
it's tacky, and everyone dresses like they're going to a hayride.
of course he's going to the dance.
he's always dancing.
we got kicked out of church once cause he was doing the funky chicken.
never in my life have I done the funky chicken. - zip it.
so I'll see you both tonight then?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See you tonight.
God bless you.
Oh, no. God bless you, coach. God bless you.
I'll get right on it, ms. Slater.
all right. Let's talk cover... what's going on?
Wilhelmina just pitched a great concept. - What?
well, it's just a takeoff on your idea.
instead of doing the war issue, we're doing the peace issue.
that's not a takeoff on my idea.
that's the exact opposite.
Daniel, give peace a chance.
what about not makindecisions without each other? What about two against one?
you left the meeting.
I've got 20 other magazines to supervise, including mom's, which is going to tank unless she gets some advertisers.
look, it's starting again. Wilhelmina is taking over.
it was just one idea.
stop being paranoid.
Oh, great bracelet. J'adore. - oh, thank you.
the big story of the day was wilhelmina slater's triumphant return to "mode" magazine, where she greeted her former rival daniel meade with a hug.
uncomfortable.
threatened much, daniel?
she leaked that photo! - Looks like someone is afraid the diva will return "mode" to its former glory.
what? "Former glory"? Can you believe this?
now if "mode" does well, they're gonna think it's 'cause of wilhelmina?
Oh, my god.
I know, I know, but,--but that kind of makes sense.
I mean, I can totally see why you're worried.
is there something I should do?
you know what? Go home.
I want you to work on that article. I'm gonna handle this.
if she wants to spin the press, then we are gonna spin the press.
the official announcement, but I'll be happy to answer any questions.
just give me one minute, all right?
Marc, what are you doing here?
just wanted to see you in your element.
Ooh, pastries.
crafty is for talent only.
that's short for "craft serces," which is long for "food.
I'm sorry. It's industry lingo.
now, uh, just get out of here.
Why? Why can't I be on the show?
it's not me. I want you on the show.
it's, um, it's gene. He hates the gays.
no. - Yes.
okay. Now, um, please. It would be so much easier for me if you just left.
Hey, you and I come as a package...
so he is just gonna have to get used to it.
gene simmons? - Yeah.
I'm marc st. James, amanda's best friend in the whole wide world.
I'm here, I'm queer and I'm eating your pastries.
you're funny.
you ow, we could use a funny gay guy in our next segment.
uh, wanna be on the show? - yes.
this is fabulous. - Thank you.
what I was thinking...what? Tell me. Please, I'd love to hear it.
how you doing over there?
I can't concentrate.
Why? Is it henry again?
I keep trying to focus on my work, and then gio went and kissed me.
what? Gio kissed you? Girl, spill it! Can he kiss?
don't get excited. It was awful...
and I feel guilty.
guilty? Why?
because you liked it.
no, I just miss henry. That's all.
and...and I'm not even close to being ready to think about another guy.
it's not time yet. Is it?
Oh, god, I'm terrible.
ay, please. You think you can't have feelings for more than one guy at a time?
I know you lost henry, but you cannot plan when you're gonna start feeling things again.
big man on campus coming through.
it's an homage to "grease."
Danny zuko meets couture.
if I'm going to this tacky thing, I'll at least make a splash.
papi, will you get out of here before you get the rest of us sick?
you're already sick.
I am not. You are crazy. I'm fine.
but is it, like, 1, 000 degrees in here or what?
Hilda, you're burning up.
there is no way you're going to that dance.
no, tonight is the night that I find out if the coach likes me.
so help me god, I am going to that dance.
you want all those kids to get your cold?
to hell with theids. - Hilda!
what? Besides, if I don't go, then they're gonna be short a chaperone. Please.
I'll go.
what?
I'll go. I'll be surrounded by kids all night.
I can interview them. I'll get their youth perspective.
I'll build my article around their quotes. It's perfect.
I can't concentrate around here anyway.
do I still have to go? - Yes.
because you gotta spy on the coach. - Hilda.
I'm gonna go get ready.
I think I still have my homecoming dress.
no velour or lace or paiey.
better go up there.
here. - Oh, thanks, papi.
you know, from the first moment I looked into your eyes, it was like some kind of cosmic connection.
I... I don't know what it is, but, you know, I knew you were my daughter.
happiest day of my life.
gene, do you mean that?
I really do.
stand by. We have sound problems. Reset, everybody. Back in ten.
no, it's... it's okay. Um, hey, tell me about my mom.
can I have a water? Asap. Hello?
Yes, mr. Simmons.
did she ever contact you? - I'm so sorry. I've got to get this.
hello. Brian.
that was weird.
Oh, no. That's classic gene. He's always on his phone.
it's kind of a celebrity thing.
you wouldn't really understand it.
he was so sweet when the cameras were on, and then he did, like, a complete 180.
what do you mean?
180? It means, like, complete opposite.
no, I know what 180 means.
are you trying to say that what my father and I have isn't real?
this is exactly why I didn't want you to come here.
you...you are so jealous that I'm rock royalty.
well, what are you?
Oh, my god. Look at this place, all the decorations.
Yeah, it's still the gym. It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
okay, so I guess I should start getting quotes.
are you ready to have fun?
Yeah, but we're here. I'm gonna go find the coach.
okay. Hi, uh, could
excuse me, do you have a second? I just
excuse me.
I'm writing an artle for a magazine on the youth perspective.
as a young woman, what do you think about the older generations?
you know, like, what would you say to somebody who was 60?
like you?
um, okay. Let's try this a different way.
I know you from somewhere.
Nope. I don't think so.
Yeah, braces. You know my brother.
who's your brother?
I knew you were stalking me.
you are stalking me.
what are you doing here?
I'm a chaperone. - Well, me, too, but I'm also working, so if you don't mind...
Oh, I see. You get your kiss, and now you're blowing me off.
you kissed me.
Yeah, well, you kissed me back.
I even felt your tongue.
I was blocking your tongue.
you frenched me, suarez.
you frenched me good. - I did not french you.
I have an article that I need to write, and my deadline is tomorrow, - so please stop distracting me. - What?
I'm chaperoning here.
and who calls it "frenching"?
Hello?
is he there? The coach?
Yeah. He's talking to miss kazlauskas, the social studies teacher.
miss? Is she young? Is she pretty? Is she prettier than me?
uh, no competish. She has a lazy eye.
tough break for her, but yay for us.
so are you saying that the return of wilhelmina slater is not going to affect things at "mode" at all?
well, no, it's irrelevant.
as far as the magazine is concerned, wilhelmina is back in name only.
let's take some calls. Uh, burlington, vermont, you're on the air with daniel meade.
uh, I wanna know, why don't you give wilhelmina slater some credit?
isn't that a little sexist?
Oh, no. Not at all. I'm...I'm just here trying to set the record straight.
well, what about the photo where you were shoving her?
wait a minute. Do we...do we have that photo in the system?
uh, it's actually not me, uh...wait a minute. Wait a minute, daniel. There it I...whoa.
you are really shoving her there.
uh, do you have problems with successful women, or just women who don't want to sleep with you?
Oh, I know what this is. It's wilhelmina's assistant putting on a female voice. I'm sorry.
it sounds like a girl.
thank you, larry.
you're welcome.
uh, isn't it also true, wilhelmina put in 20 years of hard work while you got your job through nepotism?
fair question. - No.
it wasn't nepotism. My father gave me the job.
that's not what I meant to say.
I, um, I deserved it. And this call is a fake.
it's marc from my office.
and wilhelmina is a backstabbing, conniving, vicious little...
now, daniel, wait a minute.
my producer says that this call is coming from vermont.
beautiful foliage, uh, up there.
question- what kind of colorful phrases are kids using these days?
is it still "bling-bling" or is it just one "bling" or...
he'll be back.
I need your help.
Oh, I thought I was distracting you.
I don't have a single quote for my article, not one without profanity, anyway.
I literally have kids running from me, and you are surrounded by them.
how do you do it?
I just talk to them like a normal person.
they're pretty much the same as everybody you know.
I mean, look. There's a daniel.
and, uh, there's an amanda.
Oh, that kid is definitely me.
I hate that little kid!
I busted him twice tonight for defacing posters. - Yeah.
and now we know who you were in junior high school-- the girl who never had any fun.
um, I had plenty of fun. - Yeah.
I did yearbook and, uh, young environmentalists and...and multicultural club, and, you know, I don't like to brag, but in eighth grade, I did win the good citizen award.
of course you have a good citizen award.
well, I don't technically have it.
I gave it back so that everyone at the school could enjoy it, which kind of sucks, because I worked really hard for that award, and now I can barely see it through the trophy case, but that's okay, because giving back is what a good citizen does.
Oh, found her-- little betty.
she must be covering this thing for the school paper.
no.
she's waiting for someone to ask her to dance.
okay, I'll try again... your way.
I'll talk to her like a normal person.
I have heard that your advertising problems haven't gotten any better. May I suggest...
I'm really not interested in your opinion.
you would sabotage me in a heartbeat.
ancient history, claire.
why don't you just say what you're going to say and go?
have you ever considered giving away your advertising for free?
why would I possibly do that?
because advertisers are like sheep
you give free space to one "it" brand in exchange for a promise that they don't tell anyone else it's free, and all of the sudden, you've landed a big account, you're legit and all the other buyers are willing to pay top dollar to be in your magazine.
why are you helping me?
because I have a real stake in this company now.
your failure is one-third my failure.
good luck, claire.
Hey, gene. - Yeah.
I'm really upset.
I just had this huge fight with marc, and I feel terrible.
are you about to...are you about to start crying?
that's great. Just hold that thought.
Hey, pal, do me a favor. Would you come over?
no, no, no. Please, please no cameras.
I-I really just need a father-daughter moment, one-on-one.
okay. Okay. Calm down.
excuse me? Can you get that camera over here right now?
hurry up. - be right there, mr. Simmons.
gene, what happened to your tattoo?
it looks fake.
gene, are you my father or not?
what are you looking forward to most? - and now we have an oldie by special request.
graduation. - This one goes out to betty from gio.
all right, kids, grab that special someone and hit the dance floor.
so what do you say？
do you wanna do something crazy and actually dance at a school dance?
Aw, don't worry about her. I've got that covered.
do you wanna dance?
I don't know.
go. Have fun.
well, that was very nice.
come on. Take a break from your article.
I can't.
Oh, I'm fine. How are you?
I'm good.
you realize I didn't actually ask, "how are you?
Oh, I'm fine. thanks.
you're really good at hiding it.
Yeah.
it's just, I'm not the type of person who can have a boyfriend and forget about them...
especially someone I love.
loved.
what am I doing dancing with you, gio?
what does that say about me?
God, betty, it must be so exhausting...
always worrying about the right thing to do.
what do you mean?
didn't you give back your good citizen award because that's what a good citizen does?
and maybe you should stop worrying about how you're supposed to be, and just be.
I'm really sad.
well, sad I think we can work with.
talk to me.
I don't know what happened.
coach was standing by the bleachers, and then he disappeared.
I may have left my post briefly to dance.
you know what, sweetie? I am sorry.
I've been bugging you all night. Go have fun.
mom, you aren't bugging me.
I'm really glad you found someone you like again.
Oh, thank you, sweetie, but obviously, this wasn't meant to be, so I'll just see you when you get home, okay? Bye.
okay. Bye.
Hey, justin.
Hey, um, my mom would kill me for doing this, but she wants to know if you like her.
if I like her? - Yeah.
what is this, junior high?
actually, yes, and she totally likes you.
over my dead body.
mom, I'm sorry. It's done.
uh, what's going on here?
go ahead. Tell your brother.
I reinstated wilhelmina as creative director of "mode."
at?
do you know how much easier it was having her around today?
I mean, she saved your cover.
she helped save "hot flash" in under a minute.
she's the best in the business.
and she's a ruthless, immoral, ambitious snake.
that's what makes her so good.
what happened to not making any moves without each other?
like you going on national television making an ass out of yourself and this magazine?
this is damage control.
you're making a huge mistake.
no, I'm making a tough decision, which is my job as president of this company.
this discussion's over.
I can't steal my good citizen trophy.
Oh, come on. You know you want to.
it'll make you feel better, I promise.
okay. Yep. There it is. I can see it kind of.
all right. Maybe I could just hold it for a second, and then put it back.
or you could take a picture of me with your cell phone.
no, no. That could be evidence.
Betty, come get me. You worked so hard. I belong to you.
my trophy speaks with a mexican accent?
all trophies do.
okay.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I got it. I got it.
it's a lot lighter than I imagined.
stop right there.
principal hayward.
Betty suarez? Stealing?
you're a bad citizen, betty suarez.
Alexis may be onboard with you and your little act, but I am not.
I haven't forgotten who you are.
really, daniel? Who am I?
this morning, I was nothing at all, this evening,
I'm creative director, and tomorrow, who knows?
maybe I'll be editor-in-chief.
Oh, wait, that's your job, isn't it?
sweet dreams.
well, if it isn't miss fancy-pants celebrity back among the muggles.
stop.
Hey, if you're really such a celebrity, then where's youposse, huh?
Where's your hybrid? Where's your inappropriately named baby?
I'm sorry. I was mean.
look, if you think that you and gene have such a great relationship, fine.
it's none of my business.
Marc, you were right.
I didn't want you around, cause I didn't want you to see that he only loved me on camera.
it wasn't real.
he's not even my father.
what do you mean?
it was all a publicity stunt.
he needed a gimmick for his reality show, and I was just a gorgeous ingenue looking for a dad.
well, I didn't want to say this before, but I am so relieved.
I mean, thank god you're not related.
in ten years, that massive forehead could be you.
you're right.
but I'm sorry you still don't know who your family is.
Yes, I do.
who is it?
it's, um, tony diaz.
Oh, god. Just a second, okay? I'll be right there.
okay. - Oh, my god. Oh, god.
Tony. How are you?
I'm good. Missed you at the dance.
heard you had a nasty cold.
Yeah, you know, I just have a little bit of an...
tickle in my throat.
that doesn't sound too good. - no.
here. I brought you some soup.
what?
that is so nice.
I am so embarrassed. I look horrible.
Oh, no, no, no, what are you- no.
you...you look great.
do you wanna, um, come in?
uh, I, I think I should get going, but, you, um, you feel better soon, okay?
thanks for the soup.
um, whenever you're up to it, I don't know, maybe we could hang out sometime?
Yeah, I would like that.
Really? - Yeah.
okay. Good.
okay. Good.
all right. Enjoy the soup.
okay. Thank you.
he likes me he really li...
it'only a matter of time before I break this family apart for good.
I love this. You're back and wilhelmeaner than ever.
well, I couldn't have done it without your help.
I especially liked the caller on larry king from vermont putting daniel through the ringer.
well, he is a sexist pig.
brilliant move getting a vermont cell phone.
you told me to.
like I said, brilliant move.
so the principal turns to her and says...
Betty suarez, you're expelled.
no way. - Badass.
no, it is not badass to get expelled from school, so don't go gettin' any ideas.
too late. You're officially a bad influence.
okay, it's time for us to go inside.
your mom's probably waiting. - All right.
Bye. - Bye.
wait right here. I'm gonna go say a proper good night to betty, okay?
I'm sorry I got you into trouble.
don't worry about it. I had fun.
and besides, I figured out what my article's gonna be about
you can be young at any age.
I mean, I just had my first junior high dance, and I'm 24.
I'm glad I could help.
well, I better get inside and start writing.
right, right. The deadline.
good luck.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, crazy idea.
um, do you wanna, uh, maybe, uh, do something some- sometime?
what, like--like a date?
I don't know. Yeah.
Betty, um, I don't think so.
what?
I just--I don't think it's a good idea.
okay. I'm a little confused.
see, you kissed me, and then you danced with me, and you talked about being my rebound guy, so I mean, what was that all about?
well, that's just it.
I don't want to be the rebound guy.
I wanna be the guy.
you're dating a married man?
you think that doesn't tear me up? well, then walk away.
I can't. I'm in love with him. are you offering me a job?
Yyou will be my prot. but that's marc's job.
and now it's yours. stuart, what are you doing here?
what's wrong? I think he's doing drugs again.
what? I was on that trip with you in paris.
I remember you drooling all over his mother.
your son's grandparents in france
filed a claim for custody. I want to stay with my father.
I've made a decision. tonight we are welcoming back,
as editor-in-chief of "mode," daniel meade.
don't forget, I still own a third of this company.
you would be nothing without that baby.
you can't push me aside.
is that light really necessary?
sorry, miss suarez.
that's okay. believe me.
no one wants to know what happened to christina more than I do- about that...
do you have any idea where mr. meade was last night?
do I know where daniel was last night?
six hours earlier
Hi, dad. - morning, sweetheart.
are we gonna do this every morning?
Hey, I miss you at breakfast, but I'm sure
you're having a great breakfast in your own apartment. mmm. it's great.
I can't help it.
I still worry about you, by yourself in the big city.
you think you have enough locks on your door? I have plenty.
and I grew up in the big city, remember?
there's no need to be so protective of my umbrella.
why would I be protective of your umbrella?
no, I left my umbrella ouide my apartment,
and now it's gone.
amor, you're too trusting.
you leave your umbrella outside your apartment,
people will steal it. I'm sure somebody just borrowed it.
my neighbors are really nice.
it sounds a lot like your bike in the seventh grade.
okay, those guys totally said that they would bring it back,
and it's fine if someone borrowed my umbrella, cause I don't need it today anyway.
you look different. I'm wet.
big improvement. betty.
good morning, daniels.
what is popping, shorty?
super tight. I am outtie five, okay?
everyone at school listens to hip-hop,
so he's sort of been studying up.
Oh, well, he is a fast learner
all right, daniel, your first day back at "mode."
schedule... thank you.
mail. oh, that's it?
Yep, the rest of it got forwarded to alexis,
but I'm on it. don't worry. oh, and I also thought that I would go do a dry cleaning run for you. Since you're off the tracksuits. yay! great. oh. uh, can you have...
my raincoat dry-cleaned while you're at it?
Hello, dusty.
Oh, and I was supposed to get my mom home last night,
but I ended up leaving the party early, so if anyone asks,
you can just say, uh, we were, uh,
here late packing up at "player" magazine. but we weren't at player.
Oh, I know. I just thought it was the simplest explanation.
well, why don't you just say where you really were?
wouldn't that be simpler? because I would...
because it's not a big deal.
people! I have an announcement to make!
this is urgent! I have important news!
Wilhelmina slater is in the hospital.
it's okay. she's only there because last night
her surrogate, christina,
fell down the stairs and is unconscious.
what?
don't worry.
the baby and wilhelmina are fine.
Marc! what about christina?
I'm sure that she's...you know what? I didn't ask.
Christina...
Hi. it's betty.
Hey, betty.
are you all right? what happened?
I don't remember.
it's...it's a bit fuzzy.
I was leaving the party.
I'd had an awful time.
and... I was at the top of the stairs,
and...
and...and then someone pushed me.
what?
baby...
mama...
drama
rumors are swirling ever since the surrogate carrying wilhelmina slater.
fell down the stairs or was she pushed?And bradford meade's latent love child
with meade in the balance,
everyone wants to know who could have done such a thing
the millionaire playboy, the tranny c. e. o.
the angry matriarch acquitted of murder
or any one or wilhelmina's many close frenemies?
la slater lost no time
in trying to help authorities find the culprit.
I will not rest until the person who threatened the life of my unborn child... and others.
is brought to justice.
so I'm offering a reward of $100, 000
to anyone with information
leading to the apprehension of this monster.
this is a huge opportunity.
the more they talk about this,
the less they talk about the poor sales of my first issue of "mode."
still, willie,
doesn't it worry you a little, this whole situation?
well, of course I'm worried, marc,
but when someone gives you chintz,
you can do two things
a," whine about the fact that it's an upholstery fabric
or "b," turn it into a fabulous bolero jacket.
okay, you're a diabolical fashion genius,
and I'm delighted to be your first assistant again,
but your baby...
and others are in the hospital.
I- I- I- I know they're okay, but...
Marc, you're right.
at the end of the day, it's about my child.
now we'll have to make sure the press knows that.
we need speeches, vigils,
long nights at the hospital with our scottish rent-a-womb.
we'll have to make sure
they don't forget the real victim here. the baby.
me.
you.
hello. "mode" magazine.
you'll have to call back.
detective averaimo. I'm here to question people about...- I did it.
excuse me? and now you have to interrogate me for,
like, hours and hours,
and I do not break easy.
I am totally easy.
detective averaimo, betty suarez.
we're gonna set you up in the conference room.
Oh, but I'm guilty. where are you going?
just say you know, the victim,
Christina mckinney, is my best friend.
don't worry, miss suarez,
we're taking this case very seriously.
the attempted murder of a woman and her unborn child...
well, if there's anything else that I can do for you,
please just let me know.
Yeah, well, you can start by answering a few questions.
is that light really necessary?
sorry, miss suarez.
do I know...
where daniel was last night? um...
you know, after the party.
I'm not really sure.
you see, he sort of asked me to say he was working late.If anyone, you know, asked.
he asked you to lie?
uh... no, no. uh, not a lie.
more of a small untruth.
excuse me.
Yeah.
no.
I think I just found a very promising lead.
he said very promising lead,
and then he circled and underlined daniel's name.
it's all my fault. speaking of which,
I've been watching a lot of cop shows lately,
and that mariska hargitay wears some amazing pantsuits.
I'm just trying to keep things upbeat.
sweetheart,
I'm sure if he circled and underlined daniel's name,
the detective had a pretty good reason.
dad, he only thinks daniel's guilty
because of something I said.
it's not like daniel could ever do something like that.
well, if daniel's innocent,
then he has nothing to worrybout, right? right.
you're right. I'm worrying about nothing.
I better get going. trains take forever to come after 9: 00.
okay.
thank you for the italian burgers.
all right. bye. you're welcome. let us know what happens.
okay. hi. sorry I missed supper.
I'm sure you were busy. hey. listen.
we need to talk about me and coach, okay?
you're the only one who knows,
and I know you're still mad at me. hilda, I'm not mad.
I was just surprised yesterday.
I never thought you were the type of person
who'd do something like this. wait, wait, wait, wait. wait a minute.
I'm the same person. I'm your sister. have a little faith.
Tony's marriage isn't working, okay? he wants to be with me.
but getting out of a situation like that is a little bit complicated,
so that's why we were wondering if
maybe we could just borrow your apartment.
what? are you crazy?
no, hilda.
I'm not gonna let you turn my apartment into some sort of sex den.
Shh. it's not about sex. it's about love.
fine. then some sort of love den.
if it was just about that, then we could do it in his car.
but that is no place to talk about
whether or not we have a future together.
Betty, I'm trying to figure this thing out with him, you know?
and all we need is a place to talk. just talk. I promise.
I love you. thank you, mami.
well, before you talk to daniel, could you at least handcuff me?
Daniel, I have to tell you something.
I meant to tell you yesterday, but I thought I should do it in person.
you see,
I sort of might have maybe admitted to the police that you asked me to lie about where you were the night of the party.
wait. why would you do that?
I don't know!
I am not a very good liar, and I didn't think it was that big of a deal,
and then he... mr. meade, you got a minute?
I was wondering about something I noticed in your office.
are these your sneakers?
Yeah. uh, those are actually... they're bapes.
they're... one-of-a-kind.
Nigo hand-molded the soles for me and everything.
fancy. size 11, huh? mm-hmm.
I'm afraid you're under arrest. what?
wait.
what?
the tread marks here match the size 11 shoe prints we found in the stairwell where miss mckinney was pushed.
Betty, call my lawyer.
um, right. okay, I will.
ugly BETTY $200, 000 bail that almost seems cheap.
here comes the press. come on, guys.
has anyone talked to daniel jr?
I don't want him to see his father like this.
I've already handled it. I told him it's a meade thing.
see, grandma was in jail before, and aunt alexis may be in jail next.
seriously, mom.
we have to come up with a plan.
I think somebody's framing daniel, and I wouldn't put it past wilhelmina.
let's go.
thank you, betty.
we have nothing to say at this time. thank you.
thank you.
Wilhelmina! surrogate! right over here.
surrogate, pull the bandage down.
you're horrible.
why, because I care about the welfare of my unborn child?
that's right.
I care about the welfare of my poor, unborn child.
good. one more shot.
because you are using me and the baby as some kind of prop for a. p. r. Stunt.
Ugh. this pregnancy has just made you hysterical.
Oh. believe me. I understand.
it's hormones.
you just need a drink of water. nurse?
nurse, my...my surrogate needs some water.
She's...she's suffered so much already.
please. won't anyone help me?
can someone just give her some water?
all right!
Daniel, look.
I know this is my fault, and I really want to help you get out of it,
but you did tell me to lie about where you were last night.
I know. it's complicated.
more complicated than attempted murder?
look, you just gotta believe me, betty.
you know me. I didn't push christina.
but beyond that, the less I say, the better.
I promised betty we'd keep it clean in here.
Oh, that's too bad. I'm feeling dirty.
coach, what did I just say?
Mmm. seriously, I'm dirty.
water's out at work.
thank you very much, new york city public school system.
Yeah, I kind of need a shower.
okay, well, now I miss the sexy talk.
do you want to just take a shower here? oh.
I'll go get some ice cream, and then when I come back, we can talk. talk?
Mm-hmm. when I say "talk," I actually mean talk.
Oh, yeah. no. no. I know exactly what you mean.
Mm. I'll be back.
all right.
all clean, sexy ma--aah!
coach?
papi. tony. hilda.
papi, what are you doing here? I...I was worried about betty.
I came to install locks.
Oh, what'd you get, schlage locks? no, kwikset.
Oh, yeah, those are good.
you're married?
papi, papi, it's, it's not what you think.
I think I should go.
I don't know why daniel won't tell me where he was,
I don't think that he's capable of doing something like this.
I mean, it's my fault he's in this situation.
I have to prove that he's innocent, and you can help me.
well, what can I do?
I mean, I've already talked to the police.
I know,
but maybe there's something that you forgot or something that you didn't fully explain that could help us find who really pushed you.
I... never got around to telling you what happened with stuart.
what happened with stuart?
I saw him and... we fought.
you used me. you just wanted the money to buy drugs.
Christina- just get your hands off me!
I'm this close to calling immigration and having you deported.
Oh, my god. christina.
everyone's so fixated on who wants revenge on wilhelmina,
nobody's talking about who hates you.
I'm sorry. that came out wrong.
what did the police say about stuart?
I haven't exactly told them about it.
God, betty. this has just been so awful.
I mean, do you think that stuart could...
really have done this to me?
I don't know.
but you can't keep something like this from the police.
Christina, you have to tell them the truth.
I know.
Dr. parker to the o. r. dr. parker to the o. r.
any available i. v. nurse...
Stuart.
Stuart. hi.
what are you doing here?
well, I heard christina was in the hospital.
I had to come and see that she's okay.
Yeah, uh, it's just that, um,
they don't really want anyone in there who might upset her.
she told you about the fight, huh? nope.
maybe. what size shoes do you wear?
Why?
no reason.
size 14. the kids at school used to call me "big foot."
it was humiliating. now do you want to tell me why you need to know that?
well, the person who pushed christina down the stairs wore a size 11.
do you think I did it?
it breaks my heart that you think
I'm even capable of hurting christina.
I love her. well, what do you expect, stuart?
she gave up a lot for you, to save your life,
and now you're doing drugs again?
I'm in pain.
the treatment that christina paid for...it didn't work.
there's no cure, so I'm gonna die, okay?
I'm sorry. uh...
I had no idea.
are you going to tell her?
after what christina's done for me, to tell her it was all for nothing,
how am I gonna do that?
after all she's done for you, she deserves to know.
this didn't work in high school. why would it work now?
what, are you stalking me?
a married man, hilda? I thought you were better than this.
said the guy who had an affair with our mom.
no, that was totally different.
Oh, right, because you're a guy,
and you got that whole latino macho thing happening.
don't make this about that. this is about you.
you'd never say anything like this to betty.
maybe because betty wouldn't do something like this.
good afternoon. hi. I'm betty suarez.
I'm daniel meade's assistant.
I need the security tapes from two nights ago.
you want the security tapes, too?
like, I said, I work for daniel meade, as in meade publications.
the guy they arrested for pushing that pregnant lady?
that's the one.
that's crazy. you work for a murderer.
Ah. attempted murderer, and he didn't do it, and you work for him, too
Wow. I work for a murderer.
I hadn't considered that.
right, so if you give me the tapes, and we can prove he's innocent,
then we won't work for a murderer.
I can't do it.
the morning after your boss tried to kill that poor pregnant lady,
the tapes were gone.
what? well, do you know who took 'em?
I'll tell you what I told the police and that little blonde girl.
okay.
I have no idea.
wait. what little blonde girl?
so I asked about the tapes. so what?
I am not splitting wilhelmina's reward money with you.
Amanda, I don't care about the reward.
I just need to help daniel.
look, you know he's innocent, too.
I do. look, don't judge me, okay?
not that you ever really could in... that.
but I really, really need that reward money.
I'm having a little bit of a cash flow problem,
and I may or may not have maxed out a few credit cards.
how many? like... 15.
15?
Shh. I like nice things, okay? so what?
anyway, I'm not talking to my parents now,
so I'm kind of on my own with this, not that you'd care.
no, of course I care.
look, amanda, you were there the night christina got pushed,
so why don't you just tell me what you remember?
well, it was late.
that's when I usually try the credit card company's indian call centers.
they are so much nicer.
seriously, I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this, Rahul.
is it a crime to purchase things you can't pay for? no.
Amanda, have you seen the mustard?
I need it for my big, fat sandwich, which I'm always, like, Eating around you and making a total mess of myself.
I know. you always are, right? mm-hmm.
I do not always eat sandwiches, and I wasn't even there.
I'm just saying, it really does feel that way sometimes.
so anyway, I was back at my desk...
okay, if I pay my bill, then I can't pay my rent,
and if I can't pay my rent, then where will you send my bill?
see? this is actually all for you.
Christina?
I peered around the corner, but it wasn't a woman.
well, it was marc.
you will rue the day, wilhelmina slater,
that you decided to cross marc st. james.
I know all of your plans, and I will make you pay!
actually, I did push christina the other night.
what? oh, it's not what you think.
God, you people jump to conclusions.
and you...
you'd think someone with your skin tone
would be a little more sensitive to prejudice.
Marc, don't change the subject.
you just said you pushed christina,
and amanda said she saw you yelling at wilhelmina that night.
Oh. that.
well, that really wasn't anything.
then why are you hiding it? I'm not hiding it.
I just don't want anyone to know about it.
Marc, that's the same thing.
fine! do you want to know what I was doing? I'll show you.
you killed wilhelmina, and you stuffed her!
but you put her in tahari?
Amanda, it's a wilhelmina doll.
it's a wilhelmina mannequin.
she had it made for dress fittings.
now I'm not proud of this, and I will deny it if asked,
but sometimes when I'm angry at her,
I will pull out the mannequin late at night and... yell at it.
you will rue the day, wilhelmina slater,
that you decided to cross marc st. james.
I know all of your plans, and I will make you pay.
you slapped her?
hard core.
well, I apologized afterwards.
I mean, I know she's not real, but she still scares me a little.
Marc, you still haven't explained exactly why you were angry at wilhelmina.
Oh, I don't know.
maybe because I've been loyal to her for years,
and then in a matter of days,
she hires this little mayan fireplug and promotes her above me?
Marc, that again?
you may think that I lick willie's boots because I like it,
and I do a little, they're fancy... but
there is a reason why I put myself through it.
you're not the only one who wants to get ahead in the magazine world.
I have dreams, too. you never mentioned that.
anyway, I was a little worked up yelling at the wilhel-mannequin,
so I just wanted to go home...
but christina was blocking my way.
excuse me.
you.
you're carrying that thing... For her! aah!
so that's the last time I saw christina, with claire,
who seemed pretty pissed off at her now that I think about it.
Oh, my god. claire.
she had a motive, an opportunity
not to mention, She totally murdered my mom.
kind of.
all right, mrs. meade, if you could just tell us what you remember.
just so you know, if I had done it,
I would never let my son take the blame.
Oh, something you learned in prison?
there's two things they always tell you
do your own time and don't trust the popo.
okay. uh, so what exactly were you doing the night of the launch party?
well, you probably remember us at the party,
exchanging our usual pleasantries.
you can't push me aside.
don't you ever threaten my children, wilhelmina.
you have no idea the lengths I will go to protect them.
you're not doing a very good job of explaining how you're innocent.
Yes, well, wilhelmina has a way of getting me worked up,
I found myself needing a little something to take the edge off.
all right, you slipped up.
you had a drink. so what?
that's the thing.
I can't have just one drink.
I screwed up, betty.
Wilhelmina slater.
more like wilhelmina sluter. get it?
Oh, that's okay. I'm so funny.
Oh! god.
excuse me. oh.
you.
you're carrying that thing for her!
Oh! hold it！oh. ooh.
believe me I could... Yeah, I think.
Oh, mom. yeah, right here on the sofa.
mother, have you been drinking?
maybe.
well, t- the last one sort of ended up all over me, really.
thank you, christina.
Oh. thank you.
my mother has struggled with this one for a long time,
but I can't really blame her.
it's been a stressful week for all of us.
I was sort of dealing with my own problems that night.
you mean wilhelmina?
Yeah. wilhelmina? yeah.
let me remind you of my position at this company and then all of yours before I say, this doesn't go any further than this room.
okay. that's great.
we understand.
I work very hard to look poised...
but sometimes things slip through the cracks.
Oh, my god. what did you find?
facial hair.
facial hair?
I'd forgotten to take my estrogen.
I go to great lengths to maintain the illusion that I was born a woman,
but I wasn't.
I'll be honest. I didn't even notice christina leaving.
I guess she must have snuck out while I was helping my mom.
the rest of the night was spent trying to hail a taxi and keep my mom from getting sick on my brand-new donna karan.
I never knew alexis went through that or claire or you, amanda
with your credit cards.
I mean, you'd think there was an easy explanation for these things,
but there just isn't.
I know, but after talking to everyone,
it really does seem like daniel did it.
and I'm genuinely surprised.
no, daniel is innocent. I know he is.
maybe wilhelmina could help us prove it.
prove what? prove that daniel's innocent.
Oh, I didn't understand that part.
Christina was standing right here.
okay, guys. go ahead. throw the mannequin down the stairs.
I don't want to be critical here.
but we can't reenact this crime with that mannequin.
it's way too skinny -so true
we need something heavy
that can double as a convincing pregnant woman.
guys don't be ridiculous.
I'm not gonna let you throw me down the stairs.
just relax. you won't break anything unless you tense up.
Marc, I said let me go! aah!
are you guys crazy?
you could have killed us.
great. Can you have my raincoat dry-cleaned while you're at it?
Hello, dusty.
Oh, my god.
Daniel's coat.
dear,
I was talking to barbara walters' people
about setting up an inter- well,
I- everything all right?
emotional stress is not good for the baby.
Stuart came to see me.
his treatment didn't work.
and he's dying.
well, I suppose that's the danger of Experimental treatments.
can you just leave me on my own for a little while?
please.
Oh... what did I do?
Daniel! Hi! I was just looking for some paperwork.
Nope, it's not here.
Hey, I'm glad I found you.
I've just been wanting to tell you.
how much your faith in me has meant during this whole ordeal.
Yeah, of...of course.
something wrong?
no, nothing's wrong, why would anything be wrong?
I don't know, just kind of the way you said, "nothing's wrong,
it kind like you know sounds like there is something wrong.
Nope.
Oh, I gotta go.
Betty?
thank god you're here. I don't know what to do.
Hilda's having an affair.
coach diaz, he's married - I know.
wait. what? you know?
dad! enough with the spanish.
I think daniel pushed christina.
what?
I found this in his bag.
it's a security tape from "mode" the night christina got pushed.
he stole it.
do you think he's guilty?
I don't know. I don't... I don't know what to think.
I mean, I spent the entire day trying to prove that he's innocent,
and all I found out was that
everything is more complicated than I thought.
Betty, this is why I worry about you.
I know, dad. I know. you think I'm naive. I'm too trusting.
is it really naive to want to believe in people?
I mean, look at hilda. okay, so she made a mistake.
she's still a good person.
and I would say the same thing about daniel right before I found this.
that's not being naive, mija.
that's faith.
have you seen it?
no.
I don't want to know if I'm wrong about daniel.
what if you're right?
EW, Daniel. this is dirty...
and awkward.
but why would he want to hide that from the police?
it's complicated.
it's not that complicated, daniel. I've seen the tape.
Oh, god! not the...- yes, and I saw it with my dad.
okay. so...
the woman I was with that night, that was holly,
the state department liaison who's been helping me with my custody problems?
and you're sleeping with her?
no, no, that... that happened after she started helping me.
it wasn't like she started helping me because we slept together,
but if it ever got out I know that's what it would look like.
that's it? that's why you couldn't say anything?
what, are you crazy?
Daniel, you were arrested for attempted murder!
Yeah, which I didn't commit.
look, I had to believe they were gonna find the real culprit eventually.
besides if they ever found out where I really was that night,
Holly could have lost her job,
I'd lose her help and I could lose daniel jr. forever.
he's my son, betty. I'm not gonna lose him now I won't.
Oh, my god.
Daniel,
I have never been more happy to find out about one of your sleazy affairs.
Oh! I knew you couldn't have pushed christina.
I believed in you, and I was right. mm!
thank you, betty.
um, I'm...I'm sorry to do this right now.
I...I'm late to pick up d. j.
right. okay. yes. you should go.
would you mind giving that coat back to alexis?
what do you mean, give it back?
she borrowed it a couple days ago.
it looks better on her anyway.
Alexis?
I know you did it.
I don't know what you're talking about, betty.
Daniel's coat. you borrowed it.
it had dust from the bottom of the steps where christina fell.
so I got his coat dusty. so what?
it doesn't mean anything.
what about your feet?
excuse me?
there are a lot of things you can change about yourself,
but your shoe size isn't one of them.
men's size 11, just like daniel's,
same as the ones the police found at the bottom of the stairs.
you pushed christina, alexis.
what do you want?
what you did to christina was horrible,
but then you stole daniel's shoes and you wore his coat?
you framed your own brother, alexis.
I... I didn't mean for that to happen. I swear.
Yeah, well, that's what it looks like.
the night of the party, things were bad with wilhelmina.
I know we've had our differences, wilhelmina,
but we're going to have to find a way to work together.
Oh, spare me, alexis. you stabbed me in the back.
so let me give you fair warning,
my freakishly tall girlfriend,
you will never be rid of me thanks to this baby.
I know all your secrets, and when I get my chance,
you'll never see it coming.
I was so pissed off that I broke a heel. oh!
brand-new sergio rossis, too.
I knew he was my size so I went to see
if daniel might have a pair of shoes that fit me.
then I saw the facial hair.
and right after that...
I know it's not right,
but at that moment, I didn't see christina.
I saw someone else.
you'll never be rid of me.
she was right.
as long as christina was carrying her baby,
I would never be rid of her.
my mother passed out.
so I folwed christina out into the hallway.
and I can't explain it...
but when I saw christina then...
all I could think of was wilhelmina and
everything she's put our family through.
I didn't think. I just...
I ran to her afterward.
I made sure she was still alive...
and called 9-1-1.
I can't justify what I did.
and daniel, I never, ever wanted that to happen.
it was insane.
I just kept telling myself, "He's innocent. it'll go away."
Oh, god, betty.
if I could take it back, I would, but I can't.
what do I do?
no one else knows yet.
and I haven't told daniel
because I know you're a good person, alexis.
but right now, you're the only person who can prove that.
sorry I took your umbrella - Jesse
so her lawyers are negotiating the terms of her surrender.
Betty you think you know your own sister by now...
I know.
people can surprise you.
miss meade...
if you're ready.
dear?
mom, there's one more thing I have to tell you.
Could...Could you give us another moment please?
thank you.
when I was clearing out my office,
I accidentally opened up a piece of daniel's mail.
well, darling, given what we're dealing with here,
I think daniel's going to overlook that one.
no, no, he won't.
it was a paternity test.
I don't understand.
Daniel isn't daniel jr.'s father.
I am.
I love you.
I love you.
could you grab me my loofah?
what is that? I got it for Halston.
he's supposed to come anytime I ring it, but he's kind of a bad doggy.
not like you, Betty.
you're a good girl! No. No, don't do that.
look,
Amanda I'm really glad that you're getting so comfortable living here these past couple of weeks really, I am, but I think it's time you and I have a talk about something that really has been bothering me.
is this about that $60 that you left out for anyone to take in your bottom drawer?
it's time to let that go, Betty.
Amanda, you have this tendency to treat me like I'm your assistant.
what? give me an example.
well, for instance, you rang a bell to summon me.
you're constantly asking me to take your calls, -Write down your messages -oh, that reminds me.
what time's my massage tomorrow?
Oh, 6: 30. amanda! oh.
no. look, I am an assistant all day long at work.
I don't want to come home and be an assistant here, too.
but you like your job.
Yes, I do. t is a wonderful stepping stone.
however,
I don't think doing menial tasks for you is gonna help me get ahead in my career.
Hey, Betty,
is it possible you're taking your career frustration out on me?
I don't think of you as an assistant. I really don't.
I think of you as a roommate, and sometimes a maid.
would you grab me a coffee while you're up? that's not my job.
good morning, Betty. could I get a cup of coffee?
sure. that's my job.
Oh, Betty.
Nick pepper. what are you doing here?
Oh, you know, just visiting the old haunts.
I bet you've all been wondering what I've been doing since I left "mode."
you left "mode"?
Yeah, like two months ago, when alexis left?
Oh, right.
we really missed you. -Anyway, crazy story.
I get one job interview, and the next thing you know,
I am deputy culture editor of the "new york review."
boo-yah! -What?
you're an editor? I know. can you believe it?
no. no.
Ah, isn't life funny?
no, but seriously, how are you guys? things going good?
Oh, yeah, marc got engaged, but then he got dumped.
it was sad. mandy.
hold that thought, you guys. my assistant is texting me.
you have your own assistant? oh, yeah.
Hey, nick, just out of curiosity, how did you manage to get that job?
I mean, you weren't an assistant here for very long, and no offense, but you weren't really that good at your job either.
Yeah, but I also graduated from y.e.t. i.
last year.
y.e.t. i? young editors' training initiative.
it started a couple of years ago, uber-selective.
nearly everyone from my class has gone on to become an editor.
so what, there's, like,
this magical school where assistants go to get turned into editors overnight?
one doesn't become a ninja overnight, Betty.
the hard part is getting in. you need a sponsor.
you gotta present a whole magazine concept to a bunch of judges.
but once you get in-- if u get in--boom.
I got my brass ring, and I am running with it, baby.
talk to me. nick pepper, deputy culture editor.
Oh! daniel, great news.
you get to be my sponsor for y.e.t. i.
the young editors' training initiative.
great. uh, what does a sponsor do?
just write a letter about how great I am.
try and keep it under a page if you can.
Thanks, daniel. this means so much to me.
um, okay.
Oh, gross. look who's here.
Wilhelmina, good morning.
look who's here.
how are you?
very well, thank you.
and look at you, with your hair all up and everything.
aren't you coltish?
Molly was just dropping me off. -I've gotta run.
we're doing a big thanksgiving thing at school today.
I have a native american from the poospatuck tribe coming to speak.
mm, the life you lead.
well, it's always good to see you. likewise.
we'll have to do brunch. really?
I'd rather gouge my eyes out.
I will shoot you in the heart before I'll let you brunch with her?
I mean, she's a mousy schoolteacher.
and he is ambitis, he's shrewd, he's competitive, he's hot, he's...
he's me.
he's the me-a-mina.
well, why can't he see we'd make the perfect couple together?
maybe you need to spend more time with him, you know, one-on-one.
well, I do have that advertisers' meeting in florida.
maybe I could invite him. he could see me in action.
maybe he can see you in your underwear as well.
Marc.
it's not about the sex.
I can see a future with him.
and he could, too, with, me.
if he'd just get to know me, he'd see that we're the same.
okay, but if that doesn't work, you could always wah-wah.
cause you've still got it, lady.
well, it's always good to have a plan "b."
or a plan 34-c. uh-huh.
here at y. e.t. i. we see people as more than just assistants.
we see you as the future leaders of the publishing industry.
gosh, I feel like I'm dreaming.
this is exactly the opportunity that I've been looking for.
so here are your guidelines for your presentation.
you have to create a cover,
a table of contents and a letter from the editor for an original magazine concept that best describes you.
Oh, this application is for next year. I'm looking for this year.
the deadline for this year is just too tight.
Oh. well, I can't wait another year.
this is my future. I need to start my future, pilar.
my boss works under deadlines all the time.
I've done it before. I can do it.
I hope y're right. you are adorable.
thank you.
Oh, and so how tight is my deadline?
like a month, a couple weeks?
you have 48 hours.
to create a magazine?
good luck.
dad, please, you made the posole.
you don't have to clean up, too.
mija, you just stay right there and keep working.
we want you to get into this y.e.t. i.
I don't know how they expect you to come up with a magazine in two days.
well, luckily I know exactly what a fashion magazine is supposed to look like.
you're doing a fashion magazine?
what? well, stop looking at me. dad.
sweetheart,
I thought the assignment was to do a magazine that expresses who you are.
it is.
it is, and--and I have a million ideas that I want to do,
but they're all too big, and I don't have time, so I'm being practical.
I have the resources at "mode" to do a fashion magazine.
it just has to get me in. oh, I guess that makes sense.
you get your foot in the door,
and then you're on your way to doing your not-fashion magazine.
okay, mom. We have to go.
Randy's coming over to watch "little shop of horrors."
the high school doing the play tomorrow,
and randy thinks that he can see the play without seeing the movie.
I know.
crazy, right?
okay, please through out the garbage, and we'll meet you downstairs.
Betty needs to get back to work.
you, too. all right. god.
Hey, so justin's spending a lot of time with randy, huh?
Yeah. it's been great.
you know, they hang out all the time you know, ever since santos died,
Justin really hasn't had any male presence in his life.
Hello? I'm right here.
you know what I mean. bye. mwah.
love you. love you.
Betty, you're getting in. I know it.
well, I hope you're right.
papi, this could be the fast track to everything I ever wanted.
fashion.
Connor, hi.
Hi. listen, are you familiar with doral resort wear?
as in the largest resort wear label in the country?
that's the one.
well, they are interested in exclusive back cover spots through 2012.
that's huge.
well, we just have to persuade them to jump ship from "elle,"
and they can only meet tomorrow.
so, uh, will you join me for the meeting?
I'm supposed to speak at molly's school in the morning.
can we schedule it for the afternoon? oh, I forgot to tell you.
Doral's corporate offices are in key largo, florida.
uh, so you and I are going on a little trip.
right. okay, betty, which one of these vests do you want for your cover?
um, I like the spotted one.
Really?
well, I don't know. the... the blue one?
or I mean, does it even need a vest?
maybe a blazer or a bolero.
well, betty, now you're just saying words at me.
I just--i can't wrap my head around this letter from the editor.
Betty, how hard can it be? daniel does it. what do I do?
what don't you do?
thank you. christina, would you sign this out?
I'm not really feeling the red tie today.
what is all this?
Oh, uh, we're working on my magazine for y. e.t. i.
so you're doing a fashion magazine?
Mm-hmm. why?
great. yeah, so... carry on.
Christina, am I on the wrong track? no. no, no, no, no, no.
right now. come on. concentrate, missy.
which of these vests do you want for the cover?
that one?
Yes! that's my girl. all right!
it's easy.
so what do you think so far? I like it.
you know, the guy who plays the dentist is really good for high school.
you're as good as him. you could totally play that part.
you think so? mm-hmm.
Randy.
Hey, man, what's up? what's up, man?
what are you doing here? just watching the show.
Oh, the one about the singing plant? yeah.
it's pretty lame, dude. skip the rest. let's hang out. are you insane?
they haven't even done "suddenly seymour" yet. wait.
you guys are watching the show together?
Mm-hmm.
okay, man. well, have fun.
see ya. well, some people enjoy a musical, thank you very much.
come on. let's go back inside.
okay. betty, this is it. I think we've got it-- the winning look.
Christina... yes!
it's great.
Oh, I think my cover is gonna be amazing.
God, that took a really long time.
I guess choosing this stuff doesn't really come natural to anybody.
okay, write this down.
I need the elie tahari, mm, this dusty rose dior,
whatever this fabulous thing is, and, oh,
you know what would be gorge with this?
those amethyst drop earrings by pippa small. ooh.
Mm. we're signing all of this out. thank you. for what?
Marc's y. e.t. i. presentation.
what? marc, wait! marc!
you're applying to y.e.t. i? I didn't know that.
well, you know me. I like to keep a low profile.
I'm applying to y.e.t. i. too.
Really? you're my competition?
what's your magazine? what's your vision?
um... betty's doing a fashion magazine.
Really? oh, my god. brilliant.
I'm as good as in. betty, you know fashion means clothing, right?
Betty's magazine is gonna kick your magazine's ass.
Oh, really? what's it called, "clashing patterns digest"?
okay, okay. all right. no need to be so snarky.
we could both get in.
actually, that's where you're wrong, betty.
y.e.t. i. never takes two people from the same magazine.
Really?
Yep. so when it's this... against this...
in the fashion world, I think you know who the winner is.
good luck.
Oh, there's my baby boy.
I thought we talked about that.
Oh, right.
there's my big strong man.
how was the play?
you know, you'd think I'd be tired of seeing "little shop," after, like, 14 times, but you'd be wrong.
and how about Randy?
um, he liked it... I think.
he had to go home right after.
Mm. do you think Randy would like to go with you to a broadway show?
in the Heights,
winner of the 2008 tony for best musical? mm-hmm.
third row orchestra? mom, I'm goin' blind.
all right, all right. don't go blind. just have fun.
Randy's gonna flip.
Mwah. thank you.
all right. I love you. love you.
Justin, slow down.
mija, what a surprise.
Mm. papi, I need a pan of your capirotada and a spoon.
two spoons. I need one going at all times.
Uh-oh. two spoons. never a good sign.
did you finish your presentation?
no, I quit.
I can't do a fashion magazine.
told you so!
not helping!
and now I have to wait another year to apply to Y.E.T. I.
I was just kidding myself. It wasn't me.
sweetheart, that's the problem.
wasn't the assignment to do a magazine that shows who you are?
Yeah.
well, do that. -Dad, there isn't any time.
of course there is.
when you are passionate, you can do anything.
remember when your mother was in the hospital the first time?
you wanted her to know everything you guys were doing, so you made...
a magazine for her. remember? oh!
Oh, you saved "the betty review"? oh!
I save everything you girls do. oh!
look at this--articles,
pictures of all the things that are important to you.
look at my hair! I looked so good.
and as I remember,
you were able to make this whole magazine in one afternoon because it mattered to you. oh.
so why don't you just give them this?
this? you're not helping.
no, wait. that does help. that does help.
Hilda, thank you. papi, thank you.
okay, I'm going back to work now.
work? there's nobody at work.
doesn't matter. -What about the capirotada?
I'll eat it later.
morning, daniel.
got your phone sheet, your schedule and your coffee.
might have had a few cups myself.
uh, is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? good eye.
good eye. yeah.
I stayed up all night working on my Y.E.T.I.application, but I finished,
and I was wondering if you could maybe take a look at it, you know, like a dry run sort of thing?
it would mean a lot to me,'cause your opinion matters.
uh, sure. but I haven't even sat down yet.
right, right, right, right, right.
well, you know, settle in, take your time,
but just not too much time 'cause my presentation's at 2: 00.
man, I had a lot of coffee. -You okay?
borderline, on the edge-- the good side of the edge
so don't you worry about me.
Hey, did you finish my letter of recommendation?
uh, no, not just yet.
you forgot? -No, I didn't forget. just...
you know, if you're anxious about it, maybe you should write the letter,
and that way, I could sign it.
you can write whatever you want, make yourself sound great.
Daniel, have you got a second?
uh, yeah, sure. thanks, Betty.
so Wilhelmina and I are about to head off to Florida.
Oh, right, the doral account.
good luck with that. you'll definitely need it.
Thanks. yeah.
anyway, uh, I'm in a world of trouble with Molly.
I promised her I'd talk to her class today about the magazine business.
now feel free to say no to this, but...
you want me to talk to Molly's class?
I know she'd really appreciate it, and I know you think she's great.
no, I don't.
what? -no, uh, I like her, but I don't like her like you like her
uh, I'd love to talk to her class.
great. all right. I'll get you the details.
thanks for going for me, mate.
Yeah.
Daniel, are you going out of the office?
uh, when do you think we can do the dry run of my presentation?
Oh, I'm not gonna be gone long, hour, tops.
you got something in your hair.
Oh. I was looking for that.
if I get called out there and I don't make it back...
I want you to know, you have been an excellent teammate, Sherman.
red rover, red rover, send daniel right over.
okay. okay, everyone.
everyone, quietly, quietly get in line for potty break and juice.
go with miss Haskell, quietly in line.
great call with the red rover.
I knew I was in trouble when I asked them who wanted to be an editor when they grow up, and little Emmy said...
um, I want to be a dancer/monkey/ chinese person.
so you're good with kids.
Yeah, well, it's definitely something I've been thinking about lately, you know, starting a family.
Oh, come on. what? -No. nothing.
you are just not the Daniel Meade that you read about in the tabloids.
well, I'm just full of surprises. mm.
so what's next? um, finger painting?
macaroni art?
Hey, if you got the time, I got the pasta.
I guess that's that.
I've been an aistant to the editor-in-chief at "mode" magazine for two years now, and I love my job there.
but as we all know,
the goal of a fashion magazine is to create and sell an image that women will want to become.
I have imagined a magazine that celebrates what women already are...
a magazine for the young woman looking to be inspired beyond celebrities and clothing.
sounds like my daughter.
well, then your daughter might be interested in reading...
"B magazine," a lifestyle magazine for young women.
this magazine says that it's okay to get involved, to use your mind, be thoughtful, be confident, be yourself.
be thoughtful, be confident, be yourself.
b magazine.
nice, miss suarez.
let's hear your letter from the editor.
okay, okay, okay.
so how did it go?
I think I nailed it.
Yay! she nailed it! yes! my daughter!
shh, shh, dad. she's my daughter. this is my daughter.
dad, dad, shh.
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Andre, heather, emily,
Sven-- would you mind setting up the powerpoint screen in there, please?
thank you so much. you're the best.
Marc.
you brought a team.
Oh, just some of the interns from "mode"
helping out with the heavy lifting. no big whoop.
"a-list" magazine-- for all things fashion, fabulous and famous.
see that? all fluff.
you showed 'em you were smart. -A celebrity magazine?
I mean, hasn't that been done?
well, instead of just exploiting the celebrity culture, I'm commenting on it, ruminating on america's obsession with fame.
why can't we get enough?
that sounds kind of smart. -I know.
actually, david sedaris wrote a really great feature for us about--well,You know what? why don't you just take a look?
you can keep that. -Wait. you did an entire magazine?
Marc, sorry we're late.
there they are.
Suares, you're familiar with the super chic,
iconic stylings of fashion house badgley mischka.
meet mark badgley and james mischka.
Marc's y.e.t. i. sponsors. uh!
we read your magazine. it's so sharp.
it's right on the money. -Where has wilhelmina been hiding you?
Oh, mark, james.
marc st. james? -Yes.
Francesca. -james!
I didn't know you were a judge for this.
you're gonna love our friend marc. -Come in.
Yes. we're eager to see your presentation.
thank you.
there's my favorite girl.
Hey, are you applying to y.e.t. i. again?
I don't know.
Daniel, I've applied for 49 years in a row.
maybe if you finally gave me that letter of recommendation...
Oh, come on, betty. don't be such a nag.
Hey, would you mind grabbing me a cup of coffee?
that's my job.
don't run now.
wouldn't want you to hurt yourself...
because you're gonna be my assistant until your dying day.
you're my betty.
Betty.
sorry I'm late. I lost track of time.
I'm ready to help you with your y.e.t. i. thing.
Oh. excuse me.
you missed it?
Betty, why are you texting me?
can't talk to you right now!!!
hmm. all capitals, one, two, three exclamation points.
okay, I get it. you're mad at me.
look, I feel terrible.
is there something I can do, someone I can talk to for you?
too late. happy face?
that's supposed to be an unhappy face. -Ha! I got you to talk.
you can't go back now.
I'm shutting my phone off. listen to me.
Betty, I am sorry.
whatever, daniel.
recommendation letter, dry run-- none of it would have helped.
I'm not getting into y.e.t. i.
Daniel meade's office. how can I help you?
Yes, this is betty.
what?
wait. I got in? I got into y.e.t. i?
that's amazing!
Yes!
all right!
that's so great! should I come down there?
you were brilliant. ah.
you got that guy to lock in the premium rate for the next five years and make him think that it was his idea.
I thought I was pushing it.
well, sometimes people want to be pushed a little.
you were magnificent.
well, we certainly do make for a well-oiled machine
Yes, we do. so shall we go out and celebrate?
Yes. absolutely.
although the restaurant we passed on the way in had a sign in front that says, uh, "we've got crabs.
hmm. okay, what do you suggest?
well, believe it or not, this hotel is the best place in town.
maybe we could, um, order room service, a bottle of wine?
sounds great.
Yes, it does...
doesn't it?
okay,
so you are never gonna guess where we are going tomorrow night-- "in the heights" on broadway.
okay. you're speechless.
I was, too, but hello! four tonys, two tickets.
um, I can't go. I'm busy.
well, you're gonna have to cancel whatever you're doing,
because you don't even understand how great these seats are.
look, justin, I don't-- -What?
I don't think we should hang out anymore.
Why? is there something wrong?
dude, stop following me around.
it's pathetic. get a life.
see you in dance class.
Oh, man, what a loser.
Hi, marc.
Marc, isn't in right now, but if you leave your name and number,
he'll never speak toou again you odious sea cow, betty. beep.
okay.
obviously you got your y. e.t. i. news.
look, I know you must be disappointed but for whatever it's worth, I really liked your presentation.
it was really good.
only about a thousand times better than yours.
okay, well, I don't know about that.
look, maybe the judges just saw how much I wanted it, you know, how much I want to be an editor.
Mm-hmm. you're right, because I don't want to be an editor.
I didn't go to f. i.t.
or spend a summer abroad studying menswear in milan
or spend the last four years of my life slaving for the
best creative director in the industry, who doesn't even know and wouldn't even care that I applied to y. e.t. i.
okay, well, clearly you wanted it.
look, maybe they just liked my concept better or, you know,
who knows why they would pick me. i-- yeah, okay.
what? nothing. forget it.
no. what, marc?
you really think that what you did in two days is better than what I spent three months working on?
y-y-you're really gonna make me say it?
say what?
you helped them meet their quota.
what are you talking about?
I mean, they picked you, betty suarez of queens, becausyou're latina.
you're the token ethnic girl.
wha-- what? n-- they picked me...
that doesn't even...
wow, marc.
you have said a lot of really ugly things to me in the past,
but that is by far and away the ugliest.
well, I'm sorry, betty.
it may be ugly, but it's the truth.
surprise! surprise! you're in the y. e.t. i.
guys, guys, guys, guys, no.
no, no. it's not really a good time right now. what?
bui brought the capirotada. yeah!
yay, betty! she did it. ow!
God!
guys, I don't feel like celebrating right now.
Why? what--what-- what's wrong, mija?
marc told me that the only reason y. e.t. i.accepted me is because I'm latina.
what? sounds like sour grapes to me.
Yeah. yeah, well, I called, and they didn't exactly deny it.
who cares why you got in? you got in.
I care. look, you gotta take every advantage you get in this life.
when I have to go to the butcher shop, I put on my tightest tank top,
and thank you to the pointer sisters right here,
Abundio the meat man
is that fair? no. so what?
who cares? I don't care. thank you
I can never show my face in that butcher shop again.
please. betty, it doesn't matter.
when your mom and I came to this country,
we wanted to start a better life.
Oh, here goes the young immigrant story.
all over the city, I looked for woras a chef, but nobody would hire me.
one guy told me flat out, "puerto ricans don't touch the food.
you can wash the dishes.
I said, "i'm not puerto rican. I'm a maxican."
know what he said to me? "even worse."
papi, look, i-- all I'm saying is,
if being mexican helped this time, then good. take it.
no, papi.
I wanted to be accepted because I earned it.
you did.
so, wil... yes?
tell me, no mann your life, or are men just disposable to you?
well, yes, there's been men, but, uh... what?
well, it sounds awful, but they've all been such terrible disappointments.
Well，I've seeyou in action, and you are a very formidable woman.
I'm sure they find it hard to keep up.
so molly--um, she teaches children how to color?
Yeah, she's great.
Molly--she's, um, very free-spirited, very forthright.
you always know exactly what she's thinking.
Yes, yes, yes.
I met her. she's a peach.
but a schoolteacher doesn't seem like a natural fit for a powerful business mind as yourself.
well, I guess at first,
it was the differences that were challenging and exciting.
it was an aphrodisiac-- opposites being drawn together.
and, uh, now?
and now...
we're engaged.
let's, uh, have some more wine, shall we?
Justin, easy on the door. leave me alone.
excuse me.
lose the attitude or you're not going to "in the heights" tomorrow.
I'm not going anyway.
Justin, what happened? why are you so upset?
Randy doesn't want to be friends anymore. why not?
I don't know, mom. I don't know.
but I'm not going to the stupid show.
Justin, I'm sure that randy did not mom.
please stop. I don't want to talk about it.
dear, daniel, thanks for coming to our class.
you are old.
hello.
Oh, hey. uh, it's daniel. um...
just got your thank-you notes.
just calling to, um, thank you for those.
you're thanking me for thank-you notes?
it's kind of weird. I'm sorry.
um, i-i didn't mean to bother you.
you're not bothering me.
it's nice to talk to a grown-up.
Connor's still in florida, so I'm working late tonight.
by the way, the macaroni earrings you made are surprisingly wearable.
why is it that I'm stonkered and you're fine?
well, I guess I can hold my liquor better than you.
you know, wil, I disagree with everybody at the office.
I think you're great.
Oh, that reminds me of boarding school.
we used to play spin the bottle.
that sounds like a dangerous game.
well, no, it's harmless.
of course never wanted the bottle to land on me.
I was, uh, always afraid of just what might happen.
you are very hard to resist.
well, then stop resisting.
no.
stop.
Wilhelmina, I'm engaged.
you need to stop what you're doing and accept that.
here. you're in.
what?
you were right.
your presentation was better. so I dropped out, and you're in.
Betty, are you crazy?
I have been discriminated against my whole life.
if I was given an advantage like you, I would take it and run with it.
Marc, you're a gay man in the fashion industry.
you have plenty of advantages.
that gets me nothing.
Madonna--tickets, backstage passes.
Thanks, bitch.
okay, but outside the fashion world, it's a different story.
look, marc, at the end of the day, you deserved it more.
and I could just... apply next year. -I-I...
Marc, just--please, before I change my mind.
okay.
I'm sorry for the things that I said yesterday.
I hope you don't think I'm a racist.
just so you know,
some of the hottest guys I've ever dated have been Latino.
you're welcome.
thank you.
you know, you might feel better if you just tell me what happened.
I don't know.
I'm on your side.
well, one minute Randy's my best friend, and... now he-- he hates me.
that's not possible.
no, it is...
because... I don't fit in with his friends.
well, then that's their problem, because you're perfect.
Yeah, okay.
no.
sweetie, listen to me.
you are perfect.
but you're gonna meet a lot of stupid people in your life,
and they're just not gonna get you.
screw 'em.
all that matters is that you never, for a second, change who you are.
I know.
promise?
Yeah.
mom?
yeah?
did you get rid of the theater tickets yet?
no. Do you want to go?
I mean,
just because Randy's an idiot doesn't mean we have to waste perfectly good tickets.
Yeah, man.
I would love to see "in the heights."
are you kidding me? oh, my baby boy.
sorry. sorry. I know you don't like that.
it's okay. you know, I love you, mom.
Oh... I love you, baby.
so how was the trip with Connor? was there nudity?
did you get a look... down under? -It was a complete bust.
for some reason, he's completed devoted to that...
Molly.
Ugh. devotion.
does he see that she doesn't use eyeliner?
so what's the plan? what do we do now?
nothing. there is no plan.
I'm not gonna beg.
if he wants to marry that do-gooding gremlin, that's his choice.
I'm sorry, willie.
sorry for what?
Oh, and, uh, marc, I heard you got into the Y. E.T. I program.
I trust that's not going to interfere with your job here.
Oh, of course not.
good.
I can't think of anyone more deserving.
Congratulations.
Betty, can you come in here a moment?
Betty...
I know how important Y. E.T. I. was to you, and I dropped the ball.
it's fine. no, it's not.
and now I'm hearing you dropped out so marc could get in?
y. E.T. I. won't take two people from the same magazine.
Yeah, that's why I made a couple calls.
I just thought, you know,
they should know you worked at "player" this year, too.
just don't drop out this time.
did you get me accepted?
all you had to do was say I worked at "player"?
Yeah. now you and marc are from different magazines.
I'm sure this didn't hurt either.
I'm sorry it took me so long to write your recommendation.
Daniel, this is six pages.
that's short. you should have seen the first draft.
well...
I don't--i don't even know what to say.
uh, sorry about before?
look, I know you're going places, just--you gotta do me a favor.
try not to get there too fast.
I'd be lying if I didn't say I wish you were my assistant for the next 20 years.
but don't worry.
I know in 20 years, I'll probably be your assistant.
Daniel told me we both got in.
pretty cool, right? did you see the schedule of speakers?
Anna Wintour and Tina Brown in the same week. ah!
this is just the first step, you know?
we're gonna be huge.
Betty, phone. -Marc, where is my moisturizer?
coming, willie.
Daniel Meade's office.
Oh, thank you for calling back. I wanted to confirm...
her NAME IS JODIE PAPADAKIS, AND SHE'S MY IDOL.
I've BEEN FOLLOWING HER CAREER, LIKE, FOREVER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY GET TO MEET HER.
when I FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS RUNNING THE Y. E.T. I. PROGRAM,
I SCREAMED.
Aah! - AAH!
I SHOULD PROBABLY BUY MRS. BOWEN A GIFT.
okay, LESS TALKING, MORE TAPING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SET THIS PARTY FOR FRIDAY.
how AM I SUPPOSED TO GET ALL OF THIS DONE IN THREE DAYS?
that's WHAT YOUR FAMILY IS FOR.
don't WORRY. WE'LL GET IT DONE.
Oh, DID I TELL YOU THAT SHE STARTED OUT
as A JUNIOR ASSISTANT AT "THE NEW YORK OBSERVER"?
five YEARS, SHE BECAME THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.
she's A GENIUS.
Wow. AND YOU CHOSE US OVER HER?
no, TONIGHT'S JUST A MIXER. I GET TO SEE HER TOMORROW.
Oh, BETTY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IF, FOR THE REOPENING,
I HIRE SOMEONE TO DO MUSIC OR MAGIC OR SOMETHING
ma, NO MAGIC.
I TRY SO HARD TO GET THE BRIDGE AND TUNNEL OUT OF THIS FAMILY.
would IT BE TOO WEIRD TO ASK HER TO BE MY MENTOR RIGHT AWAY?
Betty, YOUR SISTER JUST ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
Yeah. HELLO?
right. YES.
do YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WOULD BE FUN? GIFT BAGS.
I CAN'T AFFORD GIFT BAGS.
I SPENT ALL MY MONEY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL SIGN
and THIS NEW MERCH.
that's SHORT FOR "MEHANDISE."
Hilda, IT WON'T COST YOU A THING.
mode" GETS SAMPLES ALL THE TIME.
I CAN JUST BRING SOME HOME TOMORROW.
Hey, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Hilda's BEAUTILITIES PLUS.
Oh, MY GOD! THIS IS SO EXCITING.
this PARTY IS GONNA BE LIKE MY VERY OWN BROADWAY OPENING.
Yeah, IT'S LIKE "SPRING AWAKENING," "AVENUE Q.
and "SOUTH PACIFIC" ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.
grandpa, NICE.
Hey, I KEEP UP.
Hey, SHOULDN'T THAT FACE OUTWARD?
I WASN'T DONE.
there IS NO OTHER WAY TO SPIN IT.
ELLE" KICKED OUR BUTTS LAST MONTH.
was IT CLASSY TO SHOW SARAH SILVERMAN ON THE TOILET?
no. BUT THEIR NUMBERS WERE WAY UP, AND A WIN IS A WIN.
so TRASHY. THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT "ELLE" ON MY WATCH.
weren't YOU AN INTERN? - SHUT UP.
guys.
anyway, WE ARE NOT GONNA LOSE AGAIN.
if WE DO, ONE OF YOU DIES.
I HAVE SOMETHING BIG PLANNED FOR APRIL.
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT JUST YET.
treat EVERYTHING WE DISCUSS IN HERE AS PROPRIETARY.
those COWS AT "ELLE" WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP TO.
on THE FLIP SIDE, IF ANY OF YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THEM,
there IS A VERY NICE BOTTLE OF WINE IN IT FOR YOU.
and MAYBE YOU'LL LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.
now GET BACK TO WORK.
I LOVE THE WHOLE GOOD COP/BAD COP THING
you TWO HAVE GOING.
it's NOT REALLY A THING.
it's MORE LIKE I'M NICE, SHE'S NOT.
can I HELP IT IF MY BALLS ARE BIGGER THAN HIS?
God, I LOVE THIS WOMAN.
Yeah.
will I SEE YOU AT MY PARTY ON FRIDAY?
I BUMPED GRAYDON CARTER FOR YOU.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT????
Molly HAS A SCHOOL PAGEANT THAT NIGHT,
but I PLAN ON TALKING HER OUT OF IT.
Oh, MOLLY'S COMING?
is THAT ALL RIGHT?
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO BUMP ANNA WINTOUR OFF THE GUEST LIST,
but, YOU KNOW, SERVES HER RIGHT.
I THINK SHE STOLE A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES FROM ME LAST YEAR.
good. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
this IS THE RECENTLY UNEARTHED HALSTON ORIGINAL FROM THE FIREWORKS COLLECTION.
that IS INCREDIBLE.
I FOUND THIS PRIVATE COLLECTOR WHO'S GONNA LOAN IT TO US FOR ONE SHOOT.
keira KNIGHTLEY WILL DO OUR COVER - IF SHE CAN WEAR THIS DRESS. - SHUT UP!
I MEAN, ON THAT COVER ALONE, WE GOT 30 MORE PAGES OF AD BUYS.
this COULD REALLY BE A BIG GAME CHANGER FOR US.
suck ON THAT, "ELLE.
go, DANIEL, GO, DANIEL - WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
I...
I NEED YOU TO ARRANGE TO PICK THIS UP FROM THE COLLECTOR'S LOFT TOMORROW.
here's THE INFO.
please, BETTY, KEEP IT HUSH-HUSH.
I FEEL LIKE AN INTERNATIONAL SPY.
except REAL SPIES DON'T ANNOUNCE THEY'RE SPIES.
Daniel, WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING INTO MY OFFICE?
I'd LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS HERE IN SECURITY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU AND MOLLY WERE SO CLOSE.
you're AWFUL.
perhaps IN THE PAST, BUT NOT THIS TIME.
look, THIS IS THE ONLY COPY. IT'S YOURS.
what DO YOU WANT? - NOTHING.
this IS A PERSONAL MATTER.
I UNDERSTAND.
she's ENGAGED TO YOUR FRIEND, OUR--OUR COLLEAGUE.
look, I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS,
but SOME THINGS ARE WORTH THE RISK.
we BOTH KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND LOVE.
it's-- IT'S NOT LOVE.
look, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS OR HOW SHE FEELS.
you KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
and IT LOOKS LIKE MOLLY MIGHT BE ON THE SAME PAGE.
don't YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANYTHING THERE?
you GAVE HIM THE DVD?
what THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH YOU, WOMAN?
and DON'T SAY, "NOT EVERYTHING'S A SCHEME, MARC,
because I WILL SLAP YOU.
not EVERYTHING IS A SCHEME, MARC.
okay, I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SLAP YOU.
sometimes HONESTY WORKS, TOO.
I GET IT. SO HONESTY'S THE SCHEME.
the OLD HONESTY SCHEME. YEAH! THAT'S A CLASSIC.
no, NO, NO. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE TIMES
where WHAT DANIEL WANTS AND WHAT I WANT INTERSECT.
now IF DANIEL AND MOLLY END UP TOGETHER,
where DOES THAT LEAVE... CONNOR?
heartbroken.
and THEN YOU'LL BE THERE TO PICK UP THE PIECES.
you KNOW ME. I'M VERY NURTURING.
Yeah, VERY NUR-- VERY, VERY NURTURING.
Betty SUAREZ, YOUNG EDITOR IN TRAINING.
this IS SO SWEET.
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOUR FIRST DAY.
just DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME WHEN YOU'RE A BIG STAR
and I'M STILL STUCK HERE IN MY TAILOR'S DUNGEON.
all RIGHT, I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF.
well, I'VE BEEN RELINING WILHELMINA'S DRESS FOR HER SUPER ELITE COCKTAIL PARTY,
even THOUGH THE OLD ONE WAS PERFECTLY GOOD.
and ALL THIS EXTRA BENDING DOWN'S MAKING ME FEEL DIZZY
because I'M CARRYING HER LITTLE RODENT,
which SEEMS TO BE KICKING ME IN THE GUT EVERY FIVE SECONDS TODAY.
and THE INTERNET HAS GONE DOWN.
sorry.
it's ALL MY HORMONES. JUST...
all RIGHT. OKAY.
you KNOW WHAT WOULD CHEER YOU UP?
what? WHAT? WHAT?
come TO HILDA'S.
she's HAVING THIS HUGE REOPENING OF HER SALON. IT'LL BE FUN.
Yeah, THAT DOES SOUND LIKE FUN. I LIKE YOUR SISTER.
she SAYS WHAT'S ON HER MIND, AYE? AND SHE DRINKS.
I USED TO DRINK.
Christina, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?
no, I'M FINE. I D-- I DO THIS ALL DAY LONG.
now GO. GO!
are YOU SURE? - I'M POSITIVE. GO. GO.
okay, BUT YOU'LL CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING?
Yes! NOW GO AND HURRY UP.
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
I AM. I AM SO EXCITED.
Christina, THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.
welcome TO THE FUNERAL.
the MAGAZINE BUSINESS IS DYING.
dying.
does THAT FRIGEN YOU? IT SHOULD.
it SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.
so... WHAT DO YOU DO?
do YOU GIVE UP OR DO YOU TOUGHEN UP?
when I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK WITH MY CURLY HAIR AND THIS VOICE,
do YOU THINK ANYONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY?
no.
they MOCKED ME.
so FROM THEN ON... I LOVE HER.
did YOU EAT ONIONS FOR LUNCH? - I MADE DAMN SURE
how CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE? I'M TALKING.
good. THANK YOU.

anyone ELSE HAVE A FAMILY OBLIGATION, A SICK HAMSTER?
no?

she's REALLY TERRIFIC.
Yeah. YEAH, SHE'S, UH, GREAT.
she CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH, THOUGH.
Yeah, WELL...
she WAS A LITTLE UNFAIR TO ME... YESTERDAY, 'CAUSE,
you KNOW, I SHOWED UP TO CLASS COMPLETELY PREPARED,
and THEN SHE CALLED ME OUT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T GO TO SOME SILLY NETWORKING THING.
well, NETWORKING IS ONE OF THOSE ANNOYING THINGS,
but IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR CAREER,
it's SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO.
well, I HAD A FAMILY THING, YOU KNOW?
I COULDN'T DISAPPOINT THEM.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY THINGS I'VE HAD TO MISS BECAUSE OF MY JOB.
you JUST ASK MOLLY.
Yeah, WELL, IT MIGHT NOT MATTER ANYWAY.
she TOLD ME THAT IF I CAN'T GET 40 NEW CONTACTS BY NEXT CLASS,
not TO COME BACK.
all RIGHT, BETTY,
you DO WHAT I DID WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
you FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY GOOD AT THE SUPERFICIAL STUFF
and YOU DO WHAT THEY DO.
my ANSWER IS NUH-OH.
Oh, MARC, COME ON. PLEASE. I'M SO DESPERATE.
okay. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULD DO THIS.
well, MAYBE BECAUSE IF I HADN'T STEPPED ASIDE,
you WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INTO Y. E.T. I. TO BEGIN WITH.
you're GONNA BRING UP THAT OLD CHESTNUT AGAIN. FINE.
you DO NOT GET TO PLAY THIS CARD AGAIN. OKAY?
meet ME AND AMANDA AFTER WORK. WE'LL TAKE Y TO SWILL.
everyone YOU NEED TO MEET WILL BE THERE.
great.
wait. NO, MARC, I CAN'T DO THAT.
I PROMISED MY SISTER I'D HELP-- - BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP, BUP.
don't CARE. YOU GOT ME TONIGHT OR NOT AT ALL.
Hilda, HI.
look, I'M SO SORRY,
but I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP OUT TONIGHT.
Oh, BETTY, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THESE GIFT BAGS TOGETHER.
I KNOW, AND--AND WE STILL ARE, JUST TOMORROW.
see, IF I DON'T DO THIS Y. E.T. I. THING TONIGHT,
they're GONNA KICK ME OUT.
fine. I GET IT.
we'll DO IT TOMORROW. BYE.
Bye.
sweetie...
if BETTY HAD A CHOICE, YOU KNOW SHE'D BE HERE.
Yeah.
come ON. WE GOT WORK TO DO.
all RIGHT.
thank YOU. - THANK YOU.
uh, EXCUSE ME A SECOND. MOLLY.
Daniel. HEY.
so DID THE DRESS WORK OUT?
Oh, YEAH. IT WAS GREAT.
you KNOW, IT WAS VERY, UH, GLAMOROUS.
actually, I JUST CAME TO RETURN IT, SO...
all RIGHT. UM, AWESOME.
you KNOW, I-- - DANIEL, CAN WE
I... NO, YOU GO. - GO AHEAD.
we JUST--WE NEVER...
got A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,
you KNOW, IN THE CLOSET.
Yeah.
I JUST--I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT
Hey, BABE. - HEY.
ready FOR LUNCH? - MM-HMM.
thanks FOR KEEPING HER COMPANY, MATE.
Bye.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
you KNOW, I-I'VE BEEN WITH A MILLION WOMEN.
every TIME I'M AROUND HER, IT'S LIKE...
I JUST ACT LIKE A STUPID TEENAGER.
because YOU CARE FOR HER.
God, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
Yes, BUT YOU'RE ALSO HUMAN.
you KNOW, I-I SWEAR MOLLY WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING IMPORTANT,
and, OF COURSE, THAT'S WHEN CONNOR CAME UP AND KISSED HER.
well, MAYBE "MODE'S" NOT THE PLACE FOR THAT CONVERSATION.
Yeah, BUT WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
well, YOU'RE BOTH COMING TO MY PARTY ON FRIDAY.
knowing CONNOR, HE'LL BE WORKING THE ROOM.
it AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR CONVERSATION,
uninterrupted.
here's MY CARD. M-MAYBE WE'LL DO BUSINESS SOMEDAY.
"the GORGEOUS GOURMET"-- THAT IS CATCHY.
here's MINE. - THANKS.
all RIGHT, TALK TO YOU LATER. - OKAY.
well? THAT WASN'T SO
terrible. - HORRIBLE.
could NOT HAVE GONE WORSE.
you SPENT 22 MINUTES AND 47 SECONDS TALKING TO A CATERER.
a CATERER. - A CATERER!
he WAS INTERESTING.
useless!
the POINT OF NETWORKING IS TO GATHER INFORMATION TO ADVANCE YOUR CAREER.
watch AND LEARN.
step ONE-- FORGE A BOND...
your NAME, WHERE YOU WORK AND ONE MEMORABLE FACT.
I'm MARC ST. JAMES. I WORK FOR WILHELMINA SLATER.
I ONCE HAD A THREESOME WITH JON HAMM AND MIA HAMM.
I CALLED IT THE NIGHT OF THE HAMM SANDWICH.
well, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
it's MEMORABLE. - BUT IT'S A LIE.
or IS IT? - IT IS.
step TWO-- GATHERING INFORMATION...
in ORDER TO GET INFO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE INFO.
do YOU KNOW WHY HEIDI KLUM NEVER WEARS OPEN-TOED SHOES?
the TRICK IS TO MAKE IT SOUND JUICY BUT REALLY MEAN NOTHING.
12 LITTLPIGGIES.
Oh, YEAH. IT'S DISGUSTING. I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING ABOUT THAT.
so WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT NEXT MONTH'S COVER MODEL?
and MOST IMPORTANTLY, STEP THREE--THE EXIT STRATEGY.
get IN, GET INFO, GET OUT.
see, I-I DON'T LIKE TO BE RUDE.
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU JUST STOP SOMEONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION WITHOUT HURTING THEIR
Betty, COULD YOU JUST HOLD ON ONE SEC?
okay, I GET IT. OKAY, AMANDA, I GET IT.
she's NOT COMING BACK, AND NEITHER AM I.
I've GIVEN YOU ALL I HAVE TO GIVE.
no, MARC, DON'T GO. I'M NOT READY.
Yes, YOU ARE.
you're A MEAN, NOT-SO-LEAN, CONTACT-GETTIN' MACHINE.
you're THE TERMINATOR. YOU'RE T BETTY-NATOR.
go GET 'EM.
okay, MEMORABLE FACT. I KNOW A MURDERER.
thank YOU.
here's MINE.
give INFO THAT SOUNDS JUICY BUT MEANS NOTHING.
Oh, WE TOTALLY HIRED THAT WRITER TO GO TO MILAN.
just FYI, HE HAS A PAY-PER-VIEW PROBLEM.
porn.
and WHAT DESIGNER DID YOU SAY YOU'LL BE FEATURING THIS MONTH?
that IS VERY INTERESTING.
get INFO, GET OUT.
actually, COULD YOU EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND?
you WERE VERY INTERESTING.
37, 38, 39. SHOOT. ONE MORE.
Hi. BETTY SUAREZ. YOU ARE?
exhausted. I HATE NETWORKING.
Oh, MY GOD. ME, TOO.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OKAY TO ADMIT THAT.
what's GONNA HAPPEN,
the NETWORKING POLICE ARE GONNA COME AND ARREST US?
Yeah, AND, LIKE, CHARGE US WITH "FAILURE TO CHITCHAT"?
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW KNOWING THAT THAT GUY IS INTO S&M IS GOING TO HELP MY CAREER.
especially BECAUSE THAT GUY ISN'T IN PUBLISHING.
he's A DENTIST.
I'm TERI, AND I'M NOT DOING THIS TO NETWORK.
you JUST SEEM REALLY NICE.
mode," "ELLE." HERE WE GO.
I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD BE USING EACH OTHER TO GET INFORMATION.
Yeah. NO.
I MEAN, WE COULD JUST TALK, YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH, HUMANS.
blue BRACES. BOLD.
I LIKE YOUR PINK STRIPE. IT'S COOL.
Thanks.
I MEAN, IT WAS 20 MINUTES.
that's NOT T LONG TO SPEND ON A CATERER, RIGHT?
hell, NO. PLUS, GORGEOUS GOURMET TOTALLY ROCKS.
they're DOING OUR HOLIDAY PARTY THIS YEAR.
I'm GONNA GO CLEAN THAT UP.
this ISN'T MY EXIT STRATEGY, BY THE WAY.
didn't THINK IT WAS.
you KNOW, AFTER ALL THIS FAKE NETWORKING,
it's NICE TO MEET SOMEONE IN THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY - WHO'S REAL. - YEAH. SAME HERE.
I'll BE BACK.
hold THE PRESSES!
I LOVE YOUR ENERGY, BETTY, BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.
I JUST FOUND OUT "ELLE" IS DOING THEIR CENTER SPREAD IS GOING TO HELP MY CAREER.
so BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
I KNOW. I HEARD. BUT GET THIS
ELLE" BOOKED JESSICA STAM FOR THEIR COVER SHOOT.
she JUST BROKE UP WITH HER ITALIAN BOYFRIEND
and REFUSES TO GO TO ITALY,
so THEY'RE MOVING THE WHOLE SHOOT TO PARIS.
you JUST EARNED YOURSELF A BOTTLE OF WINE.
I GUESS I'LL BE PICKING THAT UP FOR MYSELF?
thank YOU.
you KNOW, THIS WHOLE NETWORKING THING IS REALLY PAYING OFF FOR ME.
the ONLY WAY I KNEW ABOUT JESSICA STAM IS TERI,
my NEW BUSINESS CONTACT WHO WORKS AT "ELLE.
I MET HER LAST NIGHT. SHE GAVE ME THE WHOLE INSIDE SCOOP.
yeah? WHAT DID YOU HAVE????
that PETER FRANCIS IS HANDS-Y WITH THE MODELS.
everybody KNOWS THAT.
I KNOW.
Hey, DANIEL, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD JUST CUT OUT EARLY TONIGHT.
my SISTER'S GOT A THING.
actually, THERE IS SOMETHING.
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND NEUROTIC,
but IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF YOU PICKED UP THE HALSTON DRESS RATHER THAN SENDING A MESSENGER.
it's GONNA BE READY AT 5: 00.
is THAT A PROBLEM?
no.
no PROBLEM.
papi, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PICKING UP THESE SAMPLES.
tell HILDA I WILL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DO THIS SUPER SECRET TASK.
because DANIEL ONLY TRUSTS ME TO DO IT, AND, DAD,
I SWEAR, IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT, I WOULDN'T BE DOING IT.
well, YOUR SISTER WAS COUNTING ON YOU.
you KNOW, THE LOCAL PAPER'S COMING TO DO A FEATURE ON HER.
she's A NERVOUS WRECK.
she's GONNA BE SO GREAT. SHE'S SO GOOD WITH PEOPLE.
Hey, LISTEN. I COULD ALWAYS COME AROUND EARLY AND HELP,
if YOU--IF YOU WANT.
Christina WILL COME AND HELP. PERFECT.
Betty, ARE YOU GETTING HOW MUCH THIS RELAUNCH PARTY MEANS TO HILDA?
she's PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO IT.
now I REALLY HAVE TO GET GOING.
Christina's GONNA HELP YOU FINISH IN HERE,
and I WILL SEE YOU SOON. OKAY.
Yeah.
perfect. THANK YOU.
done.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THIS PLACE IS GONNA LOOK LIKE TONIGHT
the FOOD, THE DRINKS, THE NEW YORK MEDIA ELITE.
is IT AS MAGICAL AS IT SOUNDS?
Yes, YES, YES.
now THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GIVE DANIEL AND MOLLY SOME TIME ALONE,
so FIRST, I'LL PULL CONNOR ASIDE TO MEET ARIANNA HUFFINGTON.
I've ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET HER.
well, STOP HINTING, MARC. YOU'RE NOT INVITED.
now WHILE CONNOR IS OCCUPIED WITH ARIANNA,
Daniel WILL SWOOP IN,
take MOLLY INTO THE BEDROOM SO THEY CAN TALK.
juicy COUTURE.
and THEN YOU WALK IN WITH CONNOR AND SEE DANIEL ON TOP OF MOLLY.
no, NO, NO. MARC, I TOLD YOU. THIS IS NOT A PLAN.
okay, I AM JUST NOT GETTING THIS.
I-I-I--MAYBE I NEED TO BE HERE TO SEIT.
maybe NOT.
Oh, I TELL YOU, HILDA,
this IS A GREAT SETUP YOU'VE GOT GOING HERE.
you KNOW, YOU CAN SHOP, YOU CAN GET YOUR HAIR CUT.
throw IN A FOOD COURT, I WOULD NEVER LEAVE.
no, BUT, LISTEN, YOU MUST BE REALLY PROUD OF YOURSELF, THOUGH.
I AM. I AM. I'VE SCREWED UP A LOT,
and I FINALLY FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING MY ACT TOGETHER.
this IS THE BIGGEST THING I'VE EVER DONE.
not THAT MY SISTER'S NOTICED.
no. I THINK SHE HAS.
she's JUST BEEN REALLY BUSY LATELY.
Yeah, WELL, YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR WORK.
I'm REOPENING MY SALON TONIGHT.
I STILL GOT TO JUSTIN'S SCHOOL THIS MORNING TO HELP WITH THE BAKE SALE.
it's ABOUT BALANCE.
Yeah, WELL, BALANCE IS SOMETHING YOU LEARN WHEN YOU HAVE TO.
anyway, BETTY'S IN A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT NOW.
Yeah, I GUESS.
but WE USED TO BE SO CLOSE,
and NOW SHE'S LIVING IN THE CITY.
she's GOT THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE, YOU KNOW?
sometimes I JUST-- I WANT MY LITTLE SISTER BACK.
Yeah, I KNOW.
Christina. - OKAY. OH, GOD.
how DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN LABOR?
if YOU HAVE TO ASK, YOU'RE NOT IN LABOR.
right. OKAY.
excuse ME.
yes? YES?
Hi. UM, I'M FROM "MODE" MAGAZINE.
I'm HERE TO PICK UP A HALSTON DRESS FROM HIS,
fireworks COLLECTION.
Yes, YES.
someone FROM YOUR MAGAZINE ALREADY CAME AND GOT IT.
what? WHO?
Oh, NO. NO. I'M BETTY SUAREZ.
no, NO. SHE LEFT A CARD.
and SHE HAD A RATHER...
horrible PINK STRIPE IN HER HAIR.
Betty, YOU'RE FIRED.
you're NOT FIRED. DON'T WORRY.
don't WORRY?
because OF BETTY, WE ALMOST LOST KEIRA KNIGHTLEY AND 30 PAGES OF AD REVENUE.
I'm SORRY. I AM SO SORRY.
at THE CLUB, I GOT UP TO USE THE BATHROOM,
and TERI MUST HAVE TAKEN THE INFORMATION FROM MY BlackBerry.
I THOUGHT THAT... SHE WAS A FRIEND.
friendship IS THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK.
okay, LET'S NOT PANIC YET. "ELLE" MAY BE RIVALS OF OURS,
but THEY'RE ALSO BUSINESS PEOPLE.
we CAN MAKE THIS WORK, RIGHT?
Marc, SET UP THE CALL.
hello. JOE ZEE, ROBBIE, NICE TO SEE YOU BOTH.
thanks FOR TAKING OUR CALL.
anything for you, Daniel. - ROBBIE, I LOVE THE NEW DO.
all that height really makes a statement.
Thanks, Willie.
those earrings really make your face look small.
okay, so, uh, listen, guys.
we have reason to believe that one of your assistants...
may have taken a certain Halston dress we have on hold.
I don't know what they're talking about.
that's HER.
you're LYING, TERI, AND YOU KNOW IT.
Oh, yeah? Prove it, brace face!
your PINK STRIPE IS STUPID.
okay. ENOUGH. ENOUGH.
listen, LET'S CUT THE BULL. WE ALL KNOW YOU HAVE THE DRESS.
you're HOLDING IT HOSTAGE AND TRYING TO RUIN OUR COVER.
that's right. We heard you got Keira Knightley for the cover.
I hope this missing dress isn't gonna be a big problem for you.
nice talking to you.
consider YOURSELVES DISINVITED FROM MY COCKTAIL PARTY.
Yeah, they weren't coming anyway.
we're having our own party tonight.
Betty, call me.
I COULD MURDER SOMEONE RIGHT NOW.
come ON. IT WAS A MISTAKE.
people WHO MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT
don't BELONG IN THIS BUSINESS.
Daniel, I FEEL TERRIBLE. I'M SORRY.
this IS MY FAULT.
if IT'S ANYONE'S FAULT, IT WAS MINE.
I JUST SHOULD HAVE HAD AN EDITOR HANDLE IT.
no. LOOK, I COULD FIX THIS.
I COULD, UH, I'LL CALL THE COLLECTOR,
see IF HE HAS ANOTHER GOWN, D I'LL CALL KEIRA'S PUBLICIST.
I'm SURE IF WE GOT ANOTHER DRESS,
Betty, COME ON. GO HOME.
thank YOU SO MUCH FOR INTERVIEWING ME.
I've NEVER BEEN IN A NEWSPAPER BEFORE.
Yeah, WELL, 'RE GONNA NEED ABOUT 40 COPIES AND PHOTO APPROVAL, IF POSSIBLE.
that's WEIRD. WHAT DOES THE FATHER HAVE TO SAY?
not A LOT. HE DIED BEFORE THE BABY WAS CONCEIVED. OH!
what?
poor CHRISTINA'S GOING THROUGH THE PREGNANCY STORY AGAIN.
maybe YOU COULD GO OUT THERE, RUN INTERFERENCE.
no. I'M NOT REALLY IN A PARTY KIND OF MOOD.
are YOU STILL STEWING ABOUT THAT DRESS, MIJA?
you CAN DEAL WITH IT ON MONDAY. LET IT GO.
let IT GO?
dad, BECAUSE OF ME, "MODE" LOST BUSINESS TODAY.
you DIDN'T SEE THE LOOK ON DANIEL'S FACE.
it's LIKE HE'S LOSING FAITH IN ME.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I LET THAT TERI USE ME LIKE THAT.
in FACT, WHERE'S HER STUPID BUSINESS CARD?
I CAN'T STAND THAT IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR MY ORGAN DONOR CARD.
mom WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE CHEESE CUBES ARE
and CRAZY FINGERNAIL LADY WANTS TO KNOW IF WE CAN SPIKE HER CIDER WITH RUM.
here. TAKE THIS.
I'll TALK TO CRAZY FINGERNAIL LADY.
there YOU ARE, YOU BIG JERK, TERI.
thank YOU SO MUCH, MARC. I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
Betty, MY CLIENT IS DYING TO MEET YOU.
where ARE YOU GOING?
I'm SO SORRY, HILDA, BUT I HAVE TO GO.
I KNOW, BUT I THINK I FOUND A WAY I CAN GET THAT HALSTON DRESS BACK FROM "ELLE."
it's A LONG SHOT, BUT I'M GONNA TRY.
you KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE?
if YOU WERE EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING I WAS DOING FOR A CHANGE.
Oh, I AM. I AM I-I JUST
I JUST HAVE TO DO THIS REALLY QUICK. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
you KNOW WHAT, BETTY? DON'T BOTHER.
papi, CAN YOU TALK TO HER, PLEASE? SHE'S BEING RIDICULOUS.
no, SHE'S NOT. YOU ARE.
what?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD HILDA WORKED TO GET ALL THIS READY, BY HERSELF, I MIGHT ADD?
that IS NOT FAIR. PAPI, THIS IS MY CAREER.
I AM WORKING HARD TO TRY AND MOVE UP.
and IF THAT MEANS THAT I'M GONNA MISS A FAMILY PARTY EVERY NOW AND THEN,
well, THEN I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. I HAVE TO DO THIS.
you DO HAVE A CHOICE. YOU'RE CHOOSING TO LEAVE.
dad.
no, NO. NO ONE SUPPORTS YOU MORE THAN YOUR FAMIL
we ARE ALWAYS BEHIND YOU 100%.
but RIGHT NOW HILDA NEEDS YOU.
papi, I AM SORRY THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS,
but I HAVE TO GO.
so GLAD YOU MADE IT.
your PLACE IS AMAZING. WHAT A GREAT VIEW OF THE CITY.
Thanks. WELL, I LOVE LOOKING DOWN AT THE LITTLE PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR LITTLE LIVES.
Molly, DEAR, DO YOU MIND IF I STEAL CONNOR AWAY?
there's SOMEONE HE HAS TO MEET.
excuse ME.
Hi.
nice DRESS.
Thanks. IT'S NO CARLOS MIELE, BUT IT DOES THE TRICK.
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS. IT'S BREATHTAKING.
could...
I-I'd LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
do YOU MIND IF WE JUST GO SOMEWHERE A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE TO TALK?
okay.
Ryan, THANKS AGAIN FOR HELPING US GET IN.
Oh, NO PROBLEM.
you TALKED TO ME FOR, LIKE, 20 MINUTES AT THAT BAR.
nobody EVER TALKS TO THE CATERER.
tick-tock, BETTY. THAT DRESS AIN'T GONNA WALK ITSELF OUT.
thank YOU. - YEAH. GOOD LUCK.
okay. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO SAY THIS,
but. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ONE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND SINCE WE MET.
Daniel, I
please. J-JUST LET ME FINISH.
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
I KNOW IT'S--IT'S BAD AND TERRIBLE AND WRONG,
and I'M JEOPARDIZING A FRIENDSHIP AND A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.
I MEAN, YOU... CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY TIMES
I've TRIED TO TALK MYSELF OUT OF THIS.
but I CAN'T CHANGE THE WAY I FEEL.
I'm ENGAGED.
Connor AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS.
he HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH WITH ME.
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH. I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM.
neither DO I.
if YOU CAN HONESTLY TELL ME YOU DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME,
I'll LET YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR, GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
I'll NEVER SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THIS AGAIN.
I PROMISE.
so I LEAN ACROSS TO HER AND I WHISPER...
no, THAT'S AL PACINO.
she SAYS, "I DIDN'T ORDER A CAPPUCCINO.
Zac. IT'S THAT ACCENT.
I MEAN, WHO CAN UNDERSTAND A WORD HE SAYS?
who CARES WHAT HE SOUNDS LIKE? LOOK AT THE WAY HE LOOKS.
so, UH, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DATING?
no, NO. NO. - NO, WE'RE NOT.
We're--we're NOT DATING.
I'm SORRY. IT'S JUST--YOU MAKE THE MOST DIVINE COUPLE.
excuse ME.
for THE RECORD, I-I WAS EXTREMELY FLATTERED BY THAT.
any MAN IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD BE PROUD TO BE WITH YOU.
well, WE WOULD MAKE QUITE THE POWER COUPLE.
well, WE DEFINITELY GE WHERE EACH OTHER'S COMING FROM.
that CAN BE HARD TO FIND.
Connor, I, UM, I-I HAVE TO ADMIT,
ever SINCE WE HAD OUR BUSINESS TRIP,
I FIND IT HARD TO BE AROUND YOU.
I'm SORRY. I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.
do YOU MIND IF WE LEAVE?
no, NOT AT ALL.
thank YOU FOR THE PARTY. IT--IT WAS LOVELY.
Yes. THANK YOU.
have YOU FOUND IT YET?
Oh, WAIT. HERE. I FOUND THE LIGHTS.
there IT IS.
exactly WHERE I SAID IT WOULD BE.
thank YOU SO MUCH, MARC, FOR HELPING ME.
I'm NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU.
a BETTER CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM WILHELMINA.
that's THE SPIRIT. - OH, MY GOD!
they STILL DO THE UGLY WALL!
this WAS TOTALLY MY IDEA.
every DAY WE WOULD PUT UP PICTURES OF COWORKERS WE HATED
and THEN MAKE FUN OF THEM.
Oh, GOOD TIMES.
Hey, HURRY UP, SLOWPOKE RODRIGUEZ.
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT.
Yeah, WELL, THESE VINTAGE SNAPS????
and I DON'T WANT TO TEAR THE DRESS.
excuse US. PARDON US. EXCUSE US.
sorry, SORRY, SORRY. EXCUSE US. PARDON US.
we JUST HAVE TO GET HER TO A TAXI. SHE IS REALLY DRUNK.
excuse US. NO, NO, NO. THIS WAY. THE ELEVATORS ARE THIS WAY.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
we're TAKING OUR DRESS BACK. MARC, RUN.
you're NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
get OUT OF HERE.
hold THE ELEVATOR!
Hey, TERI! CALL ME.
thank YOU.
I TAKE IT YOUR CONVERSATION WITH MOLLY DIDN'T GO VERY WELL.
I GUESS WE BOTH LOST OUT TONIGHT, HUH?
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
come ON. I'M NOT STUPID.
I KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CONNOR.
well, WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT?
well...
once I REALIZED YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BUSINESS MOTIVE FOR HELPING ME,
I FIGURED YOU MUST HAVE A PERSONAL ONE.
and I'VE SEEN THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HIM.
well, THAT'S JUST-- - RELAX.
I'm NOT GONNA HOLD THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HUMAN AGAINST YOU.
your SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.
well, WELL, WELL.
I CAN'T SAY I'M NOT INTRIGUED.
I GUESS THE THREE OF YOU
may COME IN.
we're IN.
pinch ME.
don't TOUCH ME.
you GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
it WAS NOTHING.
well, IT WASN'T NOTHING.
well, EITHER WAY, YOU TWO SHOULD STAY, ENJOY YOURSELVES.
you DESERVE IT.
Oh, MY GOD.
this IS A DEFINING MOMENT. I'M THE FIRST ASSISTANT WHO'S EVER BEEN INVITED TO A WILHELMINA SLATER PARTY.
well, I'M HERE, TOO. - NOT WHEN I TELL THE STORY.
doors ARE REALLY OPENING FOR US, AREN'T THEY?
it's ALL STARTING.
Oh, MY GOD. THERE'S TOM WOLFE AND ZAC POSEN.
and... - JODIE PAPADAKIS.
this IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN AN ASSISTANT AT A WILHELMINA SLATER FUNCTION.
well, YOU KNOW, JUST, UH, NETWORKING.
I HAVE ALL 40 OF MY NEW CONTACTS, BY THE WAY.
do YOU?
tell ME-- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT
have YOU TRIED THE SHRIMP YET?
no.
they're VERY SPICY.
spicy!
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IF I LIKE THEM OR NOT.
I THINK I DO.
Jodie, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW,
and...
well, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD EVER CONSIDER BEING MY MENTOR?
let's START WITH ME NOT KICKING YOU OUT OF Y. E.T. I...
and WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.
Hi. BETTY SUAREZ, "MODE" MAGAZINE.
well, HOW DO YOU DO?
Oh, I'M A VERY BIG FAN OF YOUR PUBLICATION.
Hello?
papi?
Hilda, WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT HAPPENED?
we're AT THE HOSPITAL.
what?
Oh, MY GOD! DID CHRISTINA GO INTO LABOR?
no.
papi HAD A HEART ATTACK.
what?
you WERE RIGHT.
I CAN'T SAY I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.
I BROKE UP WITH CONNOR.
aunt betty...
Aarn it.
you're finally setting up a facebook page?
everyone at Y. E.T. I.is on it.
I'm trying to get a photo up before today's class.
Tina brown is speaking.
can you get her to sign my "Diana chronicles"?
Yeah. - Ooh, is that worth something?
because if we sell it, maybe we can redecorate.
some customers came in, said the place was looking raggedy.
don't even joke about my "Diana chronicles."
and they were talking about grandpa.
ay, with the robe and the moping.
you think Elena had been gone for a month.
so I'm a little down.
Elena's away. Let me feel the pain.
Papi... She has been in California for three days.
Oh, I miss her.
finally I understand what country music's all about.
dad, you haven't been in a relationship in a long time.
you'll have to get used to the ups and downs again.
Hi, Daniel.
Oh, Betty, I'm really sick.
I think I'm dying.
you always think you're dying when you're sick.
but this time I really am.
I'm all stuffed up, my heart is racing...
well, do you want me to call a doctor?
please. It just hurts to dial.
and do you want me to set up a room at the Amsterdam?
I'm already there.
Oh, they brought me cookies.
Daniel likes to check into a fancy hotel when he's feeling sick.
okay, I will send the doctor to you.
Daniel, you are going to be okay.
I'll call you from the office.
Thanks, Betty.
sounds like somebody's a big baby.
he just likes to be taken care of when he's feeling lousy.
it must be nice to be rich.
Oh, my god, the baby.
you looked so peaceful, so I thought I'd bring William in here and let you sleep in.
sorry.
maternal instincts.
I suddenly had the urge to strangle someone to protect him.
why don't you go back to bed? I got breakfast from payard.
what did I do to deserve this?
I wish I could just work, no one else, just... you and me and the baby.
well, better yet, what if we ran away somewhere distant and exotic, where no one could find us?
well, that would be fabulous.
if only those morons we work with could get anything right, then we wouldn't have to go in to work at all.
good morning, Amanda.
Betty, wait.
what?
I need to know that you know what you're wearing.
there you are. We're gonna be late for Y. E.T. I.
come on.
Marc, we've got, like-- 27 minutes and 15 seconds.
14... 13... chop, chop, slowpoke-ahontas.
I need to be on the street right now... hearing you gasp for breath behind me.
Ooh, Molly, hey.
did you get your leak fixed?
leak? - Your apartment.
Daniel told me that you had a leak.
Yeah, it's fine. Totally fixed.
actually, is Daniel in his office? I need to talk to him.
no, he's out sick.
you know how he gets. He doesn't really like people to see him
he's at the Amsterdam under the name "Mr. Sickington." Give our love to pasty-face!
Hey, Marc, Daniel's sick name is supposed to be a secret.
Really?
I am not missing Tina Brown.
I am afraid you're all going to miss Tina Brown.
she had to cancel.
I'll be honest.
last night, there was some drinking.
some things were said.
somebody's husband may or may not have grabbed somebody's boob.
but it's you people who suffer.
wow, that really sucks.
Tina was going to talk to us about how the economics in the business are changing.
so with that topic in mind, I have arranged a special surprise guest.
do you know who it is?
I don't know, but let us pray.
Graydon Carter, David Remnick, Anna Wintour...
who is he? Is he famous? - No. And he's old.
stanley was the head of accounting at hearst until 1985.
he's here to talk to you about... budgets!
kill me now.
thank you, Stanley.
you make amortization... sexy.
okay, homework.
I want all of you to get copies of your magazine's issue budgets for this year.
I've already e-mailed each of your bosses and okayed it.
learn those budgets backwards and forwards, because next class,
I want each one of you to do a presentation on them.
okay. That's it, go.
Hey, pretty girl... - Oh, so today I don't look like Dora the explorer?
did I say that?
that's funny.
what do you want?
well, I was thinking, since we both work at the same magazine, how about this?
I'll let you do the fun-fun numbers stuff, while I'll do the heavy lifting and come up with a colorful haout, put both of our names on it.
what do you think?
Marc, I'm not great at numbers, either, so why don't we just take this as an opportunity to help each other?
fine. But you gotta carry your own weight, Suarez.
that's it? You're not gonna make a fat joke?
we're progressing!
and it was right there. Oh, well, next time.
Hey, just happened to overhear that you are not very good at numbers, and I sort of have an M. B.A.
wow, Matt, you have an M. B.A?
also half a law degree.
and I almost became a large animal vet.
it's a long story, but, um, anyway, I was thinking maybe we could go out, grab a drink and talk budgets?
smooth.
Oh, that's so sweet. You know what? I think we're gonna be okay on this one.
thank you, though.
Betty Suarez, you saucy minx.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about tall, dork and handsome back there asking you out on a date.
Oh, no, he was just offering to help us with our budget homework.
it wasn't anything. - Are you serious?
it was like two of those weird show dogs trying to mate, and it's all wrong, like a greyhound and a chihuahua.
the poor chihuahua's-- okay, okay, I get the point! Thank you.
so what if it was a date?
well, so what if it was a date? well, do you like him?
well, I don't know. I mean, he's cute, and he's nice and all.
Oh, give him a shot at love, Tila Tequila!
Yeah, but what if it didn't work out? Then I'd have to see him, like, all the time.
speaking of which, is it gonna be weird for you going down to accounting?
no, why would it be weird?- Because it's where Henry, your former love, worked.
okay, to the word "love," and you're being ridiculous, Marc.
I'm totally over Henry Grubstick.
wow, it sure takes a while to get rid of cubicle nameplates, not that matters to me.
I mean, it's got nothing to do with me.
uh, so, Jenny, let's talk budgets.
actually, funny you should bring up Henry's old cubicle.
he was really the best at budgets.
he was, wasn't he?
uh, yeah, I remember that. So, uh, budgets
Hey, has anyone heard from good ol' budget-making Henry?
well, yeah, all the time.
he's on facebook.
he is?
sorry, you probably remember.
Betty's Henry's ex. She's a little obsessy.
I'm not obsessy.
is this fun for you? - A little.
Oh, if it helps, it seems like Henry's really happy.
he posted all these awesome pictures of him and his girlfriend in Peru.
no, I think this girl's named Samantha.
I just can't believe Henry's already in a serious relationship.
aunt Betty, you had a crush on your emo neighbor guy.
I know, I know, you're right.
you're right.
it's my crush was a crush. It wasn't a trip to Peru.
Well,people move on.
you are right. Justin, you're right.
okay, maybe it was a little hard for me to go down to accounting, but... I mean, I haven't even thought about him in, like, months, so why this is bothering me... I don't know.
you know what I do when I can't get my mind off of something or someone?
what?
I channel it into a project.
Hello? You think I really care about Macram?
okay, bad example,'cause I love Macram?
but you get the idea.
try these budgets.
you all right, Betty? You seem a little jittery.
Oh, I just had a little bit of coffee and an energy drink called viper strike.
have you seen those ads?"The drink that bites back!"
viper strike!
uh, have you tried tea?
are you--are you shopping for jewelry?
no.
Daniel, is that for Molly?
maybe.
that looks kinda serious.
okay, Betty, I'm dying.
I'm sure you didn't come over here to talk about jewelry and viper strike.
no. No, no, no, no. Okay, sorry.
look, I was up all night looking at the "mode" budgets for Y. E.T. I.
and kinda trying to keep my mind off henry and his girlfriend and facebook and
what are you talking about?
never mind, and it's a long story. Anyway,
I was trying to add up the quarterly budgets, and it kept coming up short.
like, by millions.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation. We're always moving money from one magazine to another.
I-I don't know, Daniel. It's just weird.
okay, Betty.
my doctor tolde to avoid stress if you really think there's a problem, talk to Wilhelmina or Connor.
he's our C. F.O. If there are any money problems, I'm sure he can fix them.
so you can understand why I was a little worried.
absolutely, Betty. Look, it's accounting 101.
corporations always move money from one division to another.
and Meade is a very large corporation.
uh... Okay.
it just seems like a lot of money to-- as amusing as I find this conversation
why am I being polite? It's not amusing.
leave.
darling, this isn't anything we should be concerned with, is it?
absolutely not. It's nothing.
Oh, we're so lucky to have you.
Yeah, hi. Account number 7-6-4-6-7. Pass code "Sydney."
I'm calling about some money transfers from Meade publications.
looks like I might have to make my next transfer ahead of schedule.
what do you mean you didn't finish your homework? I did.
and I managed to sneak into the soho house with my friend's membership.
Why? Because... Daniel craig does not just stalk himself.
well, I started looking at the budgets, and then I got distracted.
Oh, you got bored, huh?
I'm bored.
Oh, I know. Let's talk about who I slept t las night.
you guys will never guess.
what's up, Amanda?
it was him.
vanilla. - I know.
look, Marc, I really did want to finish the assignment, but then I noticed that there was something really weird about the numbers.
Really? Something that was overlooked by all of the accountants whose actual job it is to find weird things?
well, I don't know. It just-- it seemed serious at the time.
and I e-mailed a couple people at other magazines
Oh... I see where this is going.
yesterday in accounting, I thought it would be funny to tease betty about henry having a new girlfriend...
but clearly, it struck a nerve.
Henry has a new G. F?O. M.G!
no, Amanda, I'm fine.
look, okay, maybe it surprised me.
but I'm totally-- over Henry?
nuh-unh. She got upset that Henry posted vacation photos with his girlfriend on facebook.
can you talk to me, please?
you know what you need to do? Take all of your dirty photos of him and post them yourself.
I don't have pictures like that.
of course you don't.
but seriously, Betty, there's an easy remedy.
just find someone new yourself.
what, you actually think that would work?
Betty, there is a whole world out there of goofy, awkward and mumbly guys just waiting to love you.
Hey, how about that skinny thing from class who's trying to have your puppies?
call him. - Yeah.
Hello?
Hi, Matt. It's Betty.
Oh, uh, hi, Betty, How are things?
good, great.
good, uh, I--I'm still doing my Y. E.T. I.assignment and I'm
I just wanted to say thanks for that budget before.
I know it wasn't anything, but I appreciate your moxie.
uh, yeah, of course. Glad to help.
Hello?
I'm so sorry about that, Matt.
I was just wondering if I could ask you-- oh, Betty!
almost forgot. I need you to sign these for Daniel.
got it. - Thanks.
Hello, Betty. - Do you wanna go get a drink?
Yeah, I would-- I would love to. Um... oh, good.
forgot my pen.
Molly! Oh, no, no. I don't want you to see me like this.
I'm just--I'm miserable and-- and I don't want to get you sick.
I have soup.
okay. All right.
actually, Daniel, I was hoping we could talk.
all right, but I'm all stuffed up.
I can barely breathe. My head is killing me. I really think I'm dying.
you're not dying. - I have this weird rash.
it won't go away. It really itches.
look, I have something serious to talk to you about.
it's about us.
hang on a second. I'm sorry.
my ear hasn't popped yet.
I just wanted to, um...
sorry.
you obviously need to get better, and I'm not helping, so I'm just gonna let you rest, and we can talk about this some other time.
okay.
thanks for the soup!
don't be ridiculous. Of course I'm happy.
why would you ask me such a thing?
because of what you said yesterday, about living in that moment
just you, me and the baby.
that was a nice moment.
well, what if-- what if we went somewhere far away where we could live that moment all the time, would you consider that?
Absolutely.
uh, as soon as I put the june issue to bed, um, we'll go on a long weekend.
what about london? - No, Willie, I mean for real.
That's--what are you talking about?
I've got gaultier on the line, and he's all in a lather.
about what?
who knows? He's French, he's gay, anything could set her off.
Connor, I gotta take this.
of course.
Bonjour, Jean Paul.
all right, stop crying.
no, no, that doesn't sound crazy at all.
those quarterly budget numbers-- they should add up.
well, that's good,'cause that's exactly what I thought.
I e-mailed some buddies at a couple magazines ju to double-check.
well, I'll bet they'll tell you what I just did.
Oh, yes, that's right, I forgotyou have an M. B.A.
I do. - And half a law degree.
and what's the other one?
uh, I almost became a vet. - Big animals.
well, it's nice to see that you were listening.
I listen.
Oh, okay, okay, then what is-- what's my favorite movie?
um... wait, is that a trick question?
if you would've said something, I would've remembered.
but if I had to guess, I would say... "godfather"?
okay. That's spooky.
did I get it?
no. You just seemed so excited.
it's actually "wall-E."
I love "wall-E."
Eve-ah.
Wall-e!
e-mail. Someone probably answering my budget questions.
so what did they say?
uh, not about budgets.
is everything okay?
have you ever found out that an ex is dating someone new?
Oh, yeah. That-- that's the worst.
happened to me when Angelina started dating Brad.
Yeah, and I got dumped for J. Lo.
uh, no, I'm--I'm, uh, talking about Angelina Bromberg and Brad Fletcher.
well, I sort of just found out that this guy I was...
you don't want to hear about this.
no, no, please.
tell me.
all right, well... his name is Henry.
and then to make it worse, he just tried to "friend" me?
I don't--I don't know why this bothers me, anyway.
I'm gonna shut up. I've been talking forever.
I'm not gonna say anything else.
is it just me, or is it, like, freezing in here?
Oh, here, here, give me your hands.
better?
Hey, Matt, you know what? I should probably get going.
it's getting a little late for me.
it's been fun. Thanks a lot.
uh, uh, wait, Betty, I have to ask you something.
Matt, I like you, and you're a nice guy, but we're in class together, and it could get complicated, and I don't even know what I want right now.
okay, this is kind of embarrsing, especially since you just kinda confessed a lot, but... I sort of forgot my wallet.
what?
we're not going to do anything with this money.
it was a mistake, Hilda.
I'm just saying, mama could use a couple new pairs of shoes, a new hair dryer, maybe some rings.
maybe a new nickname that's not "mama"?
mama doesn't like your attitude.
this is crazy.
of course she has to give back the money.
we don't even know who it belongs to.
well, the bank told me it came from Meade.
so I'll just go to work tomorrow, I'll figure out what happened, and they'll fix it.
there you go. Yeah, and then on the way, maybe you stop at 5th avenue a couple of times.
okay, I'll stop.
well, look on the bright side.
at least it was a memorable date.
Oh, why did you have to say "date"?
now I'm thinking date.
I was supposed to lend him money.
that's why I went to the atm in the first place.
I forgot to go back.
he asked you for money, and you ditched him?
sounds like the kind of date I used to have.
Oh, gah, I never should've gone out with him. Now I have to see him in class.
well, you know what I always say-- don't... you know, where you... you know.
elegant, mom.
what? I'm just saying, after video store larry and the subway booth guy, I learned my lesson.
you're right. I'm just-- I'm gonna apologize and tell him it was a big mistake.
voice mail.
Hi, Henry, it's Betty. I mean, Matt, it's Henry.
uh, matt, it is Betty.
this isn't starting out so well.
Hey, Betty, a cute-ish boy is here to see you.
is he the one you're trying to sleep with to get over the other one?
um, I'm right here.
I know.
um, first of all, please don't listen to anything she says.
she's crazy.
and second of all, Matt, I'm so sorry that I didn't come back.
there was this problem with my bank account-it worked out okay, actually.
they started me a tab, and, you know, I've always wanted to be a regular at a bar.
so look, anyway, I just came b to say that I'm sorry.
for what? I don't know. For--for pushing you to go out with me.
I mean, you're obviously still hung up on this other guy.
no, I'm not hung up on Henry.
well, you talked about him for, like, a half-hour.
well, that's because you asked me to.
look, it's over.
that's done. We're both at Y. E.T. I. And we work in the same business, and that could just get complicated. It did with Henry.
it might, but it also might be great.- Matt
Oh, Betty, look, okay, my mother and my father-- they got married when they were pretty young.
they didn't have much in common except me, and now they're divorced, and they hate ch other.
the way I see it, two people work in the same business, maybe it's 'cause they share the same passion.
I think that's a good thing.
if you, uh, change your mind, you can find me at 1 oak.
guess I'm a regular now.
this is weird.
I don't know why that money would've been moved like that.
well, can't you just check who authorized it?
uh, let's see.
looks like it was... Suarez.
what? No. No, no, I'm B. Suarez, and I can't authorize that sort of thing.
I don't know what to tell you.
your name's all over this.
uh... so how was the date?
I want details. And by "details," I mean very few details.
I just ate.- Well, it went
so let me get to my real point-- did you finish our assignment last night?
no. Marc, something happened that distracted me.
did he... touch you?
no.
Marc... I found $100, 000 in my bank account.
I don't know where it came from. - What?
and accounting just told me that I'm the one who authorized it?
I don't understand.
I think I could be in some serious trouble here.
for what earthly reason would someone put that much money into your bank account?
I don't know.
Connor, I need to talk to you.
something very weird is going on.
what do you mean?
I mean someone transferred $100, 000 into my bank account from meade.
well, this is very serious, betty.
I know. Why would they do that?
the truth is, I heard about the transfer, and I know you authorized it. I saw your name.
no, but I-I didn't authorize it.
I grew up poor, Betty. I get it.
your father's sick. You had to move home to help with the bills.
no, I'm telling you that I didn't take it. You have to believe me.
Oh, I believe you.
but the people who'll investigate this sort of thing-- that's just the way they're gonna see it, I'm afraid.
did you put the money in there?
don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I didn't think you were until you said "I'm not gonna hurt you."
see, Betty, the thing is, I don't see why anyone has to know about anyone stealing from the company.
you've been... stealing...
you did this because of what I found in the budgets, didn't you?
Oh, you couldn't just drop it, could you?
no. You had to e-mail your friends , ask them if they thought what was going on at meade seemed suspicious.
how do you know about that?
I know a lot of things.
I've been watching you, Betty Suarez.
now the way I see it, if you keep quiet about this, well, there's no reason why anyone should know about the money in your account, either.
well, you don't know me very well if you think I would take your bribe.
Oh, but do you remember those papers I gave you for Daniel to sign?
the transfer to your account was linked to Daniel, as well.
Hey, look, it's very complicated, but basically you'd both go to jail.
actually, that's not that complicated.
well, no one's gonna believe that Daniel is stealing from his own company.
Charles Keating, Bernie Madoff?
Daniel certainly wouldn't be the first.
why are you doing this?
I have my reasons.
and remember, if you're thinking about telling anyone else, there are a lot more people you care about than just Daniel meade.
and I can ruin any of their lives with a couple of keystrokes.
I'm glad we could have this chat, Betty.
you want some privacy, huh?
Wilhelmina, I have to tell you something.
it's... bad.
very bad?
does someone need a spanking?
Willie, I'm serious.
I'm stealing from the company.
what? Is it a joke?
no. No joke.
I'm taking the money, I'm leaving the country, and I want you and the baby to come with me.
say something.
well, uh, what am supposed to say?
yesterday, you were gonna take me on a trip. Today, you're telling me you're a thief.
Willie-- Connor, what else have you lied to me about?
okay, look, just let me explain.
I think you better explain.
all right.
being nice to the Daniel meades of the world has served me well.
but I've had to hide how I really feel.
and how do you reay feel?
I hate the selfish son of a bitch.
always have. I thought I could get over it to work here.
and then he took from me.
what, he took from you?
are you still hung up on that-- that kindergarten teacher of yours?
look, it started with that, yeah.
and that's supposed to gain my sympathy?
Willie, I don't love her. I hate Daniel.
when I found out about them, I came up with a plan to-- to steal everything from that selfish brat, ruin him.
you're talking about stealing from Meade.
I own half of Meade!
your baby owns half of Meade.
and what, you think daniel wouldn't take that from you in a second if he could?
now you've wanted this company since the moment you got here.
now I'm telling you that I found a way to take all of their money, and I want to gi it to you... because I love you, Wilhelmina.
we have an opportunityere.
we can work for these people for the rest of our lives, or we can have a future together...
just you and me and the baby.
I... I don't know what to say.
say you'll come with me.
I've chartered a private jet.
tonight... I want you to be on it.
just promise me you'll consider it.
all right?
we need to talk.
this is crazy.
I cannot believe Connor would do this to us.
Yeah, and if we go to the police, he's made it so that we'll both be implicated.
Yeah, but we've got to tell someone.
I don't know, Daniel.
Connor knew about the e-mails I had sent.
he sort of threatened my family.
it was all kinda creepy.
you know, he's just trying to buy some time.
I'm sure he just wants to take the money and run.
so what are you saying? We should go to the police?
I don't know. I've never been embezzled from before.
I don't know who we can trust here.
well, there's people who deal with this sort of stuff, right?
you know what? I'm too sick to think.
call my mom, tell her we gotta meet and come up with a plan.
Willie, you're so mysterious.
grab all my things, bring them to my apartment.
buy yourself a prada belt.
I threw that last one in to see if you were listening.
Yes, yes, put it down there, please.
and you're not, which means I can now admit that I bought the belt.
Marc, ever consider giving everything up?
every time I step on the scale.
Willie, what's going on?
Connor is robbing the company.
he's leaving the country, and he asked me to go with him.
you're not joking.
no, I'm not, and I'm considering it.
you're what?
Marc, I love him.
that may be, Willie, but, seriously,"mode" is your life. - I know.
not to mention, there arr peotheople who have put a lot into your successes.
I have never felt like this with anyone.
I've never had this in my life before.
then again, let's not forget about the other people.
what if this is my only chance at love?
okay, I'm obviously bein I'm talking about me.
me, Willie, how could you leave me?
if you had the chance to have all the money you ever needed, be with the person you loved for the rest of your life, would you do it?
I don't know.
Willie, as your friend, I don't know what to tell you.
I checked with security.
no one's seen Connor for hours. Or Wilhelmina.
what, you think she's in on n this?
I did see connor with Wilhelmina right after he talked to me.
well, Daniel, are you really surprised?
I don't know. I just thought... she owns half the company, so...
maybe half isn't enough for her. - Yeah.
let's, uh, go into your office. I've got some more bad news.
what is it? - Let's into your office.
mom, what?
as of noon today, all of the meade accounts have beetotally cleared out.
and there's nothing left.
what's going on in there, anyway?
it's kinda serious, Amanda.
Oh, my god... is pink back?
no, wait, no wait, don't tell me.
I don't think I can handle it.
is everything... gone?
Yes.
I had no idea she would do something like this.
I thought she loved "mode" more than anything.
I gave her everything, Betty.
Marc, where's Wilhelmina?
cause if you know where she is, then we can just stop this.
you didn't get this from me.
what is this?
that's where she's meeting Connor.
if you hurry, you can still stop her.
Oh, good god.
what do you clowns think you're doing?
stopping you, Wilhelmina.
Where's your baby?
Oh, she wouldn't bring her baby.
she only needed that child so she could get her hands on the Meade Fortune.
you're all idiots.
you're gonna ruin everything.
I thought we agreed not to call the police.
I didn't call them.
I did.
you don't know me at all.
sorry I'm not there, darling.
I, uh, I thought you might change your mind, so I took an earlier flight.
Connor, I...
so you chose your career, huh?
I'm sorry. - So am I.
I wish you'd chosen differently, I really do.
I still love you.
coffee?
I can't imagine what you must be going through.
I don't need your sympathy.
no, I know.
but you loved him.
he asked me to choose-- him or my career.
I've spent my entire life building my career.
in life, you have to make choices.
you can't have it all.
well, I don't know if I believe that. I...
you are young, Betty... but you are a career girl just like me.
you'll see.
Justin, everyone in L. A. is wearing these.
open it, open it.
I am a big fan... of "bryant." He's the best.
Okay,Hilda, for you ooh!
thank you.
a tracksuit? It's perfect.
and I am juicy. You are, mama.
Mija! Elena's back.
and I brought presents.
I think I left yours in the kitchen.
come on.
here.
I figure a girl who's working all the time could use a little fun.
Aw, sandals, that's great.
thank you, Ena.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
no.
uh, everything kinda went wrong at work today.
like, really wrong.
like,"we might not have jobs" wrong.
Oh, my god, Betty, I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Hey, Elena, you've worked most of your life, right?
Yeah, of course.
so did you ever feel like-- like you had to make a choice, like... like work or a personal life?
what do you mean, like you can only have one?
Nena, if I thought like that, I would've never met your father.
what did I miss?
okay, here's--here's-- I'll tell you what I missed.
right here.
right here is what I missed.
Oh, Molly.
I have had the most awful day.
what's going on?
you all right?
I have something to tell you.
I was gonna write you a note.
is this about what you saw on my computer--the rings?
Daniel-- 'cause if you think we're moving too fast, we can slow down.
Daniel-- I just--I wanted to get you something, you know, to let you know we have a future together.
Daniel, we don't.
what are you talking about?
we don't have a future, because I don't have one.
I'm sick, Daniel.
it's cancer.
I beat it before, but it's back and it's worse.
you know what? I put connor through this a few years ago, and it was awful.
I can't do that to you. - No, no, wait, wait, wait.
What--what are you saying?
I'm gonna go stay with my family.
I'm sorry, Daniel.
no, no, you're leaving? Don't I get a say in this?
Daniel-- no, no.
no, I want to be there with you, to help you.
you can't drop this in my lap and just disappear.
that's not fair.
you don't know what you're asking me.
please, molly-- you know, I don't want you to.
Molly, come on. Molly! Wait
my dad makes the best breakfast in queens.
great.
well, not just queens--all of new york.
you haven't had breakfast at the four seasons.
neither have you.
I just know everything they do is first-class.
tell 'em, Matt. You're rich.
Justin. - No, it's okay.
I have had brunch there a few times.
Matt, you are going to love my Guadalajara scramble espectacul.
I dream about eating these.
and you'll keep dreaming.
only grapefruit and egg whites for you this morning, mist.
hot!
mija, where's the fire?
slow down.
I have to meet Daniel at the office.
on a Saturday?
he's working so hard to keep this company from sinking, and besides, Matt and I are going to a ranger game today.
I don't get hockey.
all that ice, and no one's figure skating?
Betty, I didn't even know you liked hockey.
no, she doesn't. Actually, I have to go for work and-- and I owe him.
he stayed in my office for, like, an hour when I worked late.
Yeah, I read every issue of "mode" over the last three years-- a lot of boobs.
I'm just saying.
Oh, don't forget to meet me at my mom's place.
um, I'm staying there while they fix my apartment.
moms love Betty.
they don't love me.
actually, we haven't even met yet.
well, she's away, but, uh, she is dying to meet Betty.
uh, she says Betty sounds like the daughter she never had.
it's, uh, 2921 madison avenue.
what apartment?
uh, the whole building.
how rich are you?
how much money do you have?
Justin! Hilda... - What?
anybody home?
Oh, crap. I forgot I have a haircut appointment.
Hi, Archie!
that's the councilman? - Yeah.
please come in, your excellency.
ignacio, I keep telling you, please just call me Archie.
no, sir, let me have your coat.
stay and eat. Then you can have a haircut.
he's cute, Hilda.
and he's single, and he likes her.
that's why he comes here every week to get his "haircut.
go out with him. - Yeah, I don't know.
he's nice, but he's missing something.
what, a wedding ring like your last boyfriend?
Oh, no!
okay, I'm leaving. Have fun.
behave. -Okay.
Hilda, he's a nice guy. Give him a chance.
don't. - Don't.
you're crazy.
Derek Jeter is a good-looking guy.
sorry, but he doesn't do it for me.
are you kidding me? That guy gets so much
don't be gross -Fun.
the guy gets so much fun, you wouldn't believe it.
I like fun.
I hate that you have to go to work on a Saturday.
I know, but until "mode" gets back on its feet, it's gotta be seven days a week.
you know, when you're gone, I think i'll take a little hike in prospect park.
no, no, no, no.
Hey, look, why don't you just hang out?
I'll bring you some soup, watch TV, you can stay warm.
I have cancer, Daniel.
it's not like a bowl of soup and a nap, and i'll be over it.
look, will you do it for me?
please.
okay.
your meeting with miles foster's at 4: 00. Wilhelmina's on the way.
I put out a spread in the conference room-- cheese, olives, salami
not the kind that makes you gassy.
Betty, that was once. It was a fluke.
yeah...I wouldn't risk it.
also, great news-- the doctor you want for molly is in town for the rest of the week.
here's his number.
Dr. Simon? That's fantastic.
Betty, thank you so much for everything today.
I know you're not getting paid.
Oh, stop, Daniel.
if you need my help, I'm always here.
and you get to go meet your boyfriend right now.
Matt is not my boyfriend.
if i've learned one thing from molly's illness, it's that if you have something good, you have to enjoy it.
I am enjoying it.
I just don't want to put a label on it.
you know, what's the point?
boyfriend, girlfriend-- What does that mean?
um, I think it means you're getting serious.
Daniel, all I'm thinking about right now oing to a hockey game.
go, rangers!
so I learned miles has wall-to-wall meetings with every editor in town.
well, no surprise.
whenever he shoots a cover, issues fly off the newsstands.
I know. We get him first, though. We have a good chance.
I'm afraid we can't afford him.
I know.
he costs more than our entire photo budget.
well, let's make it tasty.
promise him complete creative control.
Yeah, great. Make him want us more than we want him?
just make sure you play it cool in there.
I always play it cool.
well, right now you've got that upper-lip sweat you get when you're desperate.
it's water. I just washed my face.
if that's what you say.
we've got a lot riding on this, so let's make it happen.
miles, it is so great to have you here at "mode.
we're such fans of your work.
the "Brady Bunch"-inspired shoot you did with Brad and Angelina and the six kids--genius.
how on earth did you get Jennifer aniston to play Alice?
I don't know what's hip or cool.
I just...take pictures.
I'm trying to do something that makes me feel happy inside.
well, Wilhelmina and i would certainly love to make you feel happy inside.
sorry. Did that sound weird?
you know what I mean. - Yeah, yeah, no worries.
this all sounds good. Let's do it.
and you will have complete creative control with no editorial interference.
fantastic.
and we appreciate you taking a cut in your fee.
and it's off.
you, uh, you do understand that we're in a bit of a crunch.
so I have to suffer? Mmm-mmm sorry.
I am a freakin' genius, man.
you said it yourself.
I can go down the block to "vanity fair," and they'll pay my fee.
so listen. You have until Friday.
if you have the money, i'll sign the contract, and if n...
sayonara.
we need him.
Yes, we do.
so this is gonna have to come out of our own pocket.
Wilhelmina, if you want, I can cover this.
no, that won't be necessary.
I'll cover my half.
come on.
I have more resource than you.
I got this. No problem.
Hello?
Matt! Hello?
Matt! Hello.
Oh, good. Someone's here.
I'm back early.
left my bags by the service entrance.
if you could go and, uh, bring them in.
I'm Betty.
victoria hartley. I didn't realize you were new.
but I'm very good with names. I won't forget.
Oh, you'll enjoy it here.
the first, uh, Monday of every month, I give away my old shoes.
Oh, no.
um, I'm Betty...
I'm dating Matt.
Really?
mom, you're home.
uh, yes, I-I caught an early flight.
and, uh, Betty's here. Uh, have you guys met?
Betty, mom.
mom, Betty.
super.
let's, uh, head on out.
uh, not you, mom.
maybe next time.
it's nice to meet you, Mrs. Hartley.
Yes.
and nice to meet you.
Matt, she didn't even know who I was.
I-- she thought I was your maid!
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry.
why did you tell me that I was "the daughter she wished she had"?
Yeah, I don't know why I added that detail.
it's weird, uh, especially since I have a sister.
what? - No, no, I don't have a sister. It's a bad joke!
so what, were you, like, hiding me from her?
no, I was hiding her from you.
I-- look, my mom is tricky, Betty.
she's judgmental and controlling, and no one I date is ever good enough for her.
well, then why didn't you just tell me that?
moms love me, Matt.
she'll love me. She just has to get to know me.
you know, I just didn't want to have to put you through the Victoria hartley taste test.
but you have to put me through the Victoria hartley taste test. She's your mother.
and if my family didn't like the taste of someone I was dating, well, then that would matter.
can we drop the whole taste thing?
Yeah, let's. - Look, I'm just saying, it matters if your mom likes me.
it Matters for us, you know?
when can I meet her again?
Seriously?
Yeah. I can handle anything.
dinner, lunch, coffee-- I'm really good at coffee.
how about a party? She's having this...
thing on friday night.
I didn't get an invitation.
okay! Okay, okay.
would you like to go to a party with me at my mother's apartmen Friday night?
Ooh, Friday?
I think I have an online scrabble tournament.
I'm just kidding. Yes! Let's do it.
you're the best, you know that?
okay, let's go. I don't want to be late for the game.
keep the change, buddy. Thanks.
selling your possessions?
isn't that, like, one rung above appearing on a reality show
I have to, Marc. It's not just that photographer.
running Meade costs a fortune.
I can't let Daniel leverage me out of the company.
but you're rich.
in certain things-- real estate, clothing, attitude.
but Daniel has cash, and I don't.
your taste is extraordinary, Ms. Slater.
I know. That sable is spectacular.
is the lining hand stitched?
Oh, yes, by a seamstress from Paris whose great-great-grandfather was furrier to Napoleon.
Really?
how the hell should I know?
Hey, why can't you just ask one of your rich friends for money, like the Donald or Sumner or Martha?
and have one of those bitches own me?
no way.
my money, my equity.
wow, you're, like, the world's sexiest economics teacher.
Marc, if I panic now, I will lose everything.
so with a few short-term cutbacks here and at the office, i'll be fine.
ms. Slater, may I
let's cut the bryn mawr niceties, okay?
do you want my things or not?
we do.
don't worry, Ms. Slater.
we're very discreet.
good.
come back on Friday with the check for the down payment.
for god sake.
Marc, stop crying.
if you'd like, you may try on the sable...
one last time.
Hey, Betty, a little bird told me about your fancy dinner with your rich boyfriend.
Oh, was the little bird looking at the calendar on my desk?
well, what am i supposed to do?
you never open up to me anymore.
when we were roomies, we shared everything.
no. Amanda, you shared everything, and some of it was weird.
you know, B.
,you are playing this Matt thing perfectly.
a few more moves, and u will be in the gold digger hall of fame.
I am not a gold digger.
I could care less about Matt's money.
And...cut, print, Oscar. Don't change a word. You nailed it.
Amanda, I really like Matt, and he likes me.
and now I just need his mom to like me.
the show was tragic.
but if I know Henri, he'll be back on top in no time.
excuse me.
Marc! It's 4: 00.
I'm sorry, it's time for my afternoon caviar and champagne.
I'll have to call you back.
what the hell is this?
what is this?
it's an almond, and that's seltzer.
where is the beluga?
Where's the Krug?
we can't afford it with our new office budget.
I was worried that you might react this way, but remember, you said that you wanted to make sacrifices.
you're right, you're right.
this is exactly what I was talking about.
it's what we need.
so, um...
almonds, you said?
Yes.
almonds...
is there anything else that I can...
do for you?
I'm fine.
I have everything I need.
so...
eight years ago, Molly was diagnosed.
they didn't catch it early.
Yes, I can see the cancer was rather advanced.
that's why the treatment was so aggressive.
but it worked. I mean, look at her. She's healthy.
listen, all that matters is her ability to respond to my treatment, and based on what I'm seeing, there's only a small chance, but it is a chance.
I'm about to begin work on a new clinical study.
I will send the information to your office.
you'll let me know what you want to do.
could we have a couple of days to think about it?
Molly, no.
Dr. Simon, we don't need to take a few days.
we have our answer.
we're in.
Mrs. Meade!
I was wondering if you could help me with something.
Oh, you're worried about Victoria hartley's party.
Daniel told you?
he tells me everything.
Oh, by the way, Hilda should totally go out with that councilman.
so, uh, you-- you know Mrs. Hartley?
Oh, yes.
see, i've never been to anything this fancy.
what do I need to know?
Oh, Betty, please, you know which fork to use.
outside in.
and the bread plate is on... - My left.
and the big glass is for... - Red wine!
so you're fine. What's the topic?
uh, topic?
all these east side cows always have a topic of conversation they like to introduce during the meal.
last week, mine was the Romanov dynasty.
Oh, no, I don't know what the topic i what if it's something that I know nothing about?
well, do you have the phone number?
Yes. - Dial it.
we'll get one of the maids to tell us.
Oh, that's a great idea. Okay.
Hello, yes, may I please speak to Consuela?
there's always a Consuela.
Hola, Consuela.
that's all I got. You're up.
Hola, senora.
Hola.
me llamo Betty suarez.
por la fiesta esta viernes?
Oh, perfecto! Gracias!
torture!
the topic is torture! Isn't that great?
that's a little obvious.
Arianna did torture at her luncheon last year.
we waterboarded Liz smith.
I just read this article in "the new republic" about the ethics of torture.
Oh, I'm so happy.
thank you.
I'm so glad.
Hey, Willie, I just got a bulletin from engineering.
all the TVs need to be turned off. They're doing some sort of test or something.
no computers, either. There's a virus going around or something.
Marc, what is going on?
nothing, it's just tech stuff. It's completely normal.
don't read any papers tomorrow--bad ink.
don't make me hit you.
okay!
I got a call from my source at "fashion buzz," and there's a story going around that might have something to do with you.
but i've saved the best piece of gossip masquerading as news for last.
which fabulous fashion world editor,"mode"-ivated by a recent reversal of fortune, has begun to sell off her clothes willy-nilly?
her daily snack is now a healthy combination of food-stamp-friendly nuts and soda water.
it's all so delicious...
and humiliating.
I'd tell you more, but I'm on my way out to local thrift store to purchase one of Wilhelmina slater's former possessions.
did I say her name?
I'm sorry.
because you know I'd never mock someone when they're down.
I have no idea how it got out.
I swear I didn't tell anyone.
it's fine, Marc.
obviously, there's a mole here somewhere.
and I promise you, I will find it, and I will have it removed.
cancel my calls and meetings. I'm done for the day.
can I get you anything?
no, I'm fine.
Willie-- I said I'm fine.
there are some who would argue that under certain circumstances, torture is permissible.
but others would say-- ow!
Justin, that is tight!
don't you want to look good for Matt's mom?
Yes.
well, this is one of those instances sary.
good luck.
Elena, that's one too many plates.
remember? Betty's leaving.
Oh, that's all right. Just leave it.
no, i'll take it to the kitchen.
no, no, don't bother. It's no bother.
what is going on?
Hilda, remember how you asked me to let you know when you do that thing with your eyebrows that makes you look like the son of Sam?
Hey, everyone.
thanks so much for having me over.
Hey, Archie, great to see you.
councilman?
welcome.
Here--here, take the wine.
thank you. - It's so good to see you.
come on in.
Bye, Hilda.
im gonna get you for this.
Oh, come on, Hilda.
try and have a good time.
Archie is great.
you deserve a good guy.
Willie, the auction house people are here to do the pickup.
one second.
Wilhelmina, are you here?
Hello, Marc.
you know what?
I am not happy about this.
come on.
just give him a chance.
I hope you' hungry.
because Ignacio's been cooking up a storm.
well, I can't tell you how good it is to get a home-cooked meal.
really, thank you so much for having me over.
please, you must be always having dinner with mayors...
and governors and princes and bishops
no, it's more like Chinese takeout alone in my apartment, really.
he's so modest.
the man's a celebrity, and he's so modest.
papi, he's a Queens councilman.
he's not Justin timberlake.
thank you, Hilda, for keeping my feet on the ground.
you see that?
Hilda could be good for you.
excuse us for a second.
stop scowling.
I don't like surprises, Elena.
mom...
here's your medication.
thank you.
thank you. Enjoy.
everything's so fancy.
and everyone looks so...perfect.
Yeah, only 'cause they've had an army of people working on them all afternoon.
and you look beautiful.
thank you.
you look so...
Hello, honey.
don't you look handsome?
I love that tie on you.
Where'd you get it?
you bought it for me.
well, aren't I clever?
um, you've met Betty.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm, uh, I'm so happy that you could make it.
and I won't ask you to bring up any of my bags tonight.
Matthew, don't just stand off to the side.
make sure you circulate.
Edith, I love your new Labradoodle.
well, that didn't go so bad.
right, and remember, you still have "torture" to look forward to.
stuffed mushroom?
I'll be right back.
excuse me. Hello there.
Oh, uh, hi, judge Wincroft. - We're right over there.
he has an S&M dungeon in the basement of his weekend house.
this is great.
I'd like you to meet judge Wincroft.
it's very nice to meet you.
Matt, I don't know where my mushroom cap went.
excuse me.
dinner is served.
but first, I would like to introduce everyone to the newest piece in the Hartley art collection.
beginning in December, it will be on display at the Louvre.
but right now it is here in my living room.
what is an appetizer doing on my painting?
actually, miss-- it was me, mom.
that's my mushroom cap.
I was fooling around, tossing stuff at, uh, Mr. Randolph.
I-I apologize.
Oh, no, that's fine.
if the artist were alive, he'd get a good laugh, but he's dead, which is why it's so valuable.
into the dining room, everyone.
so unlike Matthew to do something like that.
I guess you bring out his...playful side. Hmm?
I'm so sorry.
it's okay. Don't worry.
Marc, I thought I would be fine, selling everything...
but I'm not.
so then don't.
but I need the money.
why, god? Why?
what have I done to anger you?
I just hate seeing you like this.
are you taking a picture of me on your cell phone?
no. No.
this is killing me as much as it's killing you.
do you think I like living without your luxuries?
that's just it, Marc. They're not just luxuries.
these things are who I am.
each fur tells a story.
each piece of jewelry is a piece of me.
it reminds me that i've achieved something, because, damn it, I have.
I came from nothing, and i've accomplished something.
but your father was a senator.
Oh, shut up.
it's the woman from the auction house.
what do you want me to tell her?
take it. Take all of this.
do with it what you want.
I don't care anymore!
just bring me the money!
Marc, do you like what you see?
well, get used to it, because starting now, mama is downsizing.
not where it counts, baby!
all right. So I am gonna run by the office, close the deal with this photographer.
then I'm gonna be back with a couple of steaks, bottle of wine.
you and I are gonna celebrate.
have you read about the treatment, Daniel?
some of these side effects are rough.
I know, but, I mean, Molly, it could work.
10% chance, and considering my history, more like 2%.
Yeah, but it's still 2%.
I mean, come on, think about our future.
there is no future, Daniel.
this, what we have right now, is our future.
don't say that. - I'm dying, Daniel.
No!
I realize that it's so hard for me to understand what it is you're going through.
Molly, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right by your side through all of this.
I promise.
please.
I'm sorry, honey. I know how I want to live the rest of my life, and it's not like this.
Molly, don't-- I can't do it.
so anyway, this council meeting went on forever, and it was just so hot in there, I actually fell asleep.
I mean, I even snored.
you didn't.
well, it could have been embarrassing, but I managed to turnmy snore into a "nay.
that's hilarious.
isn't that hilarious, Hilda? - Really.
Oh, yeah. That is funny.
well, I know I'm gonna hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna treat myself to one more new potato.
this was an incredible meal, Ignacio.
it was my pleasure, your honor.
I just hope we can make a habit of this.
right, Hilda?
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
you should just come whenever you want.
everybody, please be seated.
are you sure there's nothing I-- don't worry about it. It's no big deal.
Matthew, I thought it would be fun if we split couples up.
come. I want you back there with me.
um, mom, I want to sit with Betty.
no, stop. The name cards were placed hours ago.
it's all been settled.
it's okay.
ignacio, come help me with dessert.
Oh, yeah. Excuse us.
Oh, Justin.
I'm trying to enjoy my new potato.
excuse me.
so how awkward is this for you?
what? No!
why would this be awkward?
because they're woing their butts off trying to fix us up.
Archie, I'm sorry.
honestly, I didn't know. They just sprung this on me.
please.
it happens all the time.
I'm a reasonably attractive man in his 40s with a midlevel government job.
I'm a...
catch.
and you, your eyes have a story that they wish to tell, and I have my whole life, and I listen well.
that's a Justin timberlake song.
Oh, I'm so glad you got that, 'cause that would have been really weird.
thank you.
I'm so pleased you could all be here tonight.
there's just so much to talk about, so many interesting things happening.
but, um, you know me.
I like to stick to one topic, and it's something that has been, uh, much on my mind, because it speaks to how civilized people should live.
what is going to be...
the future of opera?
opera?
you have a thought, Betty?
I was just so excited to hear the topic. I'm sorry. Please gon.
Oh, no. Really, why don't you start us off?
everybody, this is, uh, Betty suarez.
she is a friend of Matthew'S.
please, Betty.
I'd be fascinated to hear your opinion.
the future of opera.
go.
well, um...
my experience with opera...
is not so vast.
so I guess my opinion...
is not so...
you know, fully...
you know, formed...
as...as some of you...
here.
opera is fashion.
Meaning?
meaning that the opera will thrive as any art thrives
uh, by evolving and embracing new ideas and, of course, by giving its audience a grander, more hopeful version of themselves.
that is as succinct and insightful a piece of criticism as I have ever heard.
do you mind if I use it in my next column?
but what do you mean when you say "fashion"?
well, I work at "mode.
I love "mode.
it's like my bible.
you know, and in some respec, what is more archaic than couture dresses?
like opera.
exactly, and eventually, these couture collections have an enormous influence on our modern style.
and opera can do the same thing.
absolutely right.
I saw "Don Giovanni" on the lawn last year...
here you go, councilman.
thank you for the takeout, Ignacio.
it was my honor. Who knows?
my cooking may be eaten by royalty.
well, I was thinking of leaving a little for my cleaning lady tomorrow.
Jusas good.
uh, honey, could you come help me in the kitchen with, uh...
you know.
Oh, yeah.
the "you know.
that--that thing.
uh, good night. Excuse us.
thanks again.
Yeah.
subtlety doesn't run in this family's genes, so...
I guess according to their plan, this is when I'm supposed to ask you out.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the plan.
well, good night. - Whoa, wait a minute.
you're gonna disappoint them like that?
my dad cooked you dinner.
Hilda, you're great.
and nothing would make me happier than to take you out on a real date
one that you know about.
that sounds good.
okay, guys. I asked her out, and she said yes.
what? Oh, my god! - What a surprise!
we had no idea!
Oh, we're shocked.
ay, please.
miles, what can I say?
we just couldn't live without you.
well, listen, I am so sorry about the way our last meeting ended.
I just hate getting caught up in all these messy business details.
and yet you do.
I know. I'm so cute.
so I guess we'll check in next week, start kicking around a concept?
whatever. I am easy.
love to you both.
air kiss. Air kiss. Au revoir.
so I see you put your money together.
Daniel, if we're gonna be partners, we need to be partners all the way.
so I did what I had to do.
you know...
I know you think I'm always looking for a way to muscle u out, but really, I'm not.
life is too short.
well, how about that.
Daniel meade is waxing philosophical.
just beginning to realize what's most important...
because of Molly.
she's just determined to live life on her own terms, even if it kills her.
Oh, Mrs. Hartley.
I was just looking at your pictures.
they're great.
so, Betty, where did you go to college?
um, Queens College.
Oh, lovely. And were you the first person in your family to go?
Yep. Yeah, I-I lived at home, and I worked the whole time, but I did it.
good for you.
that's wonderful. You're ambitious.
I can see you're going places.
Oh, wow. Thank you.
Yes. Uh, Matthew went to Yale.
he speaks three languages.
uh, he spent a year in Rome on a Fulbright.
have you heard him play the piano?
Nope, not yet, but I can't wait to.
Oh, well, he plays beautifully.
he took lessons for years at the Turtle Bay Music School.
do you know it?
no. I haven't heard of it.
Oh, it's a wonderful place. All the kids study there.
so, uh, tell me, what exactly do the two of you have in common?
uh, w-well, loads.
loads.
Betty, I have high hopes for my son.
he's been given every privilege, and I expect him to take advantage of that.
okay.
uh, I'm not sure i understand what you're saying.
what I'm saying is that, uh, I hope you enjoyed your meal tonight, but I don't think that we'll be seeing you again.
you know, if you're, uh, cold, you could just say something.
we have, like, 17 fireplaces.
your mother just told me that I'm not good enough for you and we don't have a future.
I'm leaving.
no, Betty, please, please don't go. Please.- Matt-- what if she's right, Matt?
what if it Matters that I didn't go to Yale?
it doesn't Matter. - This is too much for me.
I am not gonna come between you and your mother.
no, you won't.
I'd like to have you both in my life.
what, and just keep us apart all the time?
now, Betty, please listen.
look, I want this relationship to have a future.
you have to trust me, all right? Don't worry about her.
Oh, Matthew, dessert is ready.
come in afteyou say good-bye to your friend.
I'm not saying good-bye to her, mom.
I'm saying good-bye to you.
Betty and I are leaving.
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Just come
no, I don't know exactly what you said to her, but I can guess.
Matthew - Good night, mother.
I'm leaving with my girlfriend.
are you okay?
of course.
why wouldn't I be?
no reason. Nothing.
I just don't want our budget snacks to set off another one of your...
episodes.
I swear, Marc, if you took a picture of me on your cell phone, I will kill you and eat you.
but i've arrived at a better place, and Daniel helped me get there.
the boy blunder? How?
Molly wants to live her life till the day she dies.
and damn it, so do I!
but what about the cash? What about the equity?
I can live without the furs and the jewelry.
but to hell if I'm gonna sacrifice everything.
I've worked too hard to let it all slip away.
so...
how are you going to pay for it?
I will do whatever I have to do.
maybe i'll take out a second mortgage.
all I know for sure is, as god is my witness, I will never go without champagne and caviar again.
now pass me a Bellini, please.
and I know it's horrible, but I'm just so frustrated about it.
because she won't do the treatment?
I get what she'saying.
I do. It's just...
I've done everything right, and for the first time in my adult life,
I am really in love, and I don't want to lose it.
and--and this treatment, it could work.
but, Daniel - No, I know, I know I'm not the one with cancer.
of course it's her decision, but
look, she's just trying to give you the time she does have left.
but I want more.
sometimes you can't get more.
sometimes you have to take what you get.
Oh, hold the door!
Hi, Mrs. Meade.
Hello, Betty.
so did you wow Victoria hartley with your take on torture?
no, not quite.
she changed the topic.
Oh, that old trick.
and then she told me that I was completely wrong for her son.
she's really playing by the rich bitch handbook.
I keep thinking there's gotta be something I can do to make her like me.
Oh, please, Betty.
you're never going to win that woman over.
well, maybe that's true, but I just don't understand why.
well, grow up, because not everybody's going to like you.
you've just got to suck it up and embrace it.
there's nothing I can do?
hell, yes, there's something you can do.
you can throw it right back at her.
when one of those silk stocking hags stares me down, do you know what I do?
stare back?
you got that right.
Hey, it's cold out.
what's going on?
you want to live life? We're gonna live life.
put on your jacket.
we're going hiking.
and tomorrow, we're gonna go to the beach.
but it's freezing. - I don't care.
look, all I know is every free moment of every free day I have is gonna be spent with you.
you want to go traveling? You want to stay home?
you want to go to the movies? You want to ride around on the friggin' subway all day?
it doesn't Matter. All that Matters is,
I love you, Molly, and I'm gonna treasure every moment I have left with you.
you got a problem with that?
no problem.
good.
let's go play in the snow. - Okay.
Hey, where are you? I'm here.
well, hurry up. It's a beautiful day.
okay.
Hi, Mrs. Hartley.
waiting for my son?
he's on his way down.
Oh, that's right. Matthew's moving back in to his apartment today.
I won't apologize for who I am or what I think, Betty.
well, neither will I.
what can I say?
my judgments are severe.
it's just the way I look at the world.
well, I'm sorry for you.
but I might be around for a while.
ready to go?
all set. Want to get a cab?
no, let's walk.
it's a nice day.
so you play the piano?
Oh, no.
tylor is not who you think is
they are gone?
Betty you are great.
meanwhile, I haven't even posted in over a month because I've been so busy at work.
well, I hope. TO PLAN MY Bachelorette party this weekend.
Hey, Ti got my party planned
booze, boobs and a bus to Atlantic city.
you're TRAVELING? - Yeah.
why does he get to travel? I want to travel.
travels the part that you have a problem with?
like he's gonna do better than this? - That's right.
anyway, maid of honor, what fun thing are we doing?
well get ready.
because I have scored us.
tour at the met!
get OUTTA HERE!
that's a good one!
the MET! - The met?
that would've been the worst bachelorette party ever!
right?
I know!
I was keeping the real party a surprise.
Oh, okay, good.
you're gonna love it!
see YOU LATER.
Hey, Justin, you, uh, you want a ride to school?
no, sorry. I'm walking with Austin.
Justin doesn't walk.
he's told me a thousand times, "shoes are for fashion, " you know, we, uh, we used to be friends.
I don't know what's up .
maybe I did something wrong.
you're about to be his new stepfather.
that's gotta be weird for a kid.
you know what? This weekend, you guys go and do something fun together.
that's a good idea.
andthatis My parents in a nutshell.
I don't mean to keep harping on this, but you don't have any news tracking down my father, do you?
actually, I do.
I just learned that the rehab facility where we met shut down, and, uh, those records can't be retrieved, so we'll never be able to find him.
so sorry, Tyler.
Oh, it's okay.
so I was conceived at a rehab facility.
I, uh, guess I was destined TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC.
I don't think we should joke about that.
have you spoken to Daniel yet?
I tried...
he doesn't want anything to do with me.
I hate that you're leaving so soon, and you two never got to know each other.
it's fine.
I came to meet you, and that part worked out.
I could take Hilda horseback riding for her bachelorette party.
or, better yet, naked horseback riding.
you're welcome. - Gross. and ow!
well, I'm out of ideas then.
well, all of your ideas involve nudity.
you're welcome.
stop saying that.
an e-mail from the trapeze school.
$1, 000? Come on.
that was my favorite option.
this totally sucks!
are you talking to me?
no. I was talking to...
never mind.
Oh. so what sucks?
I have to plan the perfect bachelorette party for my sister, and nothing is working out.
it's just really disappointing.
Oh, well, I know disappointment.
my half brother hates me, and I have no hope of finding my biological father.
OK. perspective.
WELL...IF IT HELPS, I've known Daniel for years, and if you just give him time, he'll come around.
message from Daniel Why Are you talking to him!?!
if you'll excuse me, I have to go deal with something annoying.
I see you.
what, are you on team try now?
no. DANIEL, I'm not on team anyone.
Tyler is not a bad guy.
put yourself in his shoes.
more like smelly, old cowboy boots.
okay, you're 5 years old.
no, you're5 years old.
someone needs a nap. We'll talk about this later.
fine.
but I'm putting you down for team Daniel.
as requested, here is some clothes from The mall.
now I'm not one to pry, but you didn't exactly specify what this is all for.
it's for an important meeting that I can't be seen wearing cashmere and furs.
mysterious.
still not prying, but would this meeting have anything to do with your plan to overthrow the Meade's?
Yes. it involves Claire's recently revealed love child--Tyler.
Aw, he's such a rube.
and he's so hot.
must he be a part of all this?
he's just a pawn
the weak link in the Meade chain.
I gain his trust, everything else falls into place.
Willie's BEING All weird again.
- British.
I'm trying to look authentic for my trip to London with Daniel, but it feels like I'm missing something.
a riding crop?
a horse? dignity?
somebody's jealous. - Yeah jealous.
you get to go all the way to London.
I have to stay here and figure out who I'm gonna take as my plus-one to Hilda's stupid straight wedding.
why don't you bring your boyfriend?
I totally forgot I had that boyfriend Trey.
Troy.
I like Trey better or Trevor.
we'll talk about it. I'm sure he'll want to weigh in.
you're going to the London fashion week, Daniel, really?
no, there are some big designers there.
you call it "the training bra fashion and you're only ever interested in the big, sexy ones, so why are you going?
is this one of those times where you ask me a question that you already know the answer to?
the answer is You don't need to be there.
you're just going to avoid this whole thing with Tyler.
am I right?
you know what? I hate it when you know me.
so send someone in your place and stay here.
reach out to your long-lost half-brother who traveled across the country to meet you, who you've been nothing but a jerk to.
okay, FINE, FINE.
but who's gonna go to London, hmm?
you? - No, I can't go.
I have to stay and plan Hilda's bachelorette party.
I still have no idea what I'm gonna do.
she wants something big and exciting and fun, but with travel.
wait a second.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
a bachelorette trip to London I thought your party was gonna be so lameass!
Hey! - And it turns out it's gonna be badass!
Yeah! - Thank you, thank you, thank you!
suck on that, Talercio!
suck on it! ?
suarez sisters going to London.
Oh, MY GOD! We're in London.
ms. Suarez, welcome.
Oh, you know my name.
of course. we're very honored to have you here.
Oh, my god! You are totally famous here.
Oh, please wait. I'd like to, um, tip you.
I'm SURE I HAVE A FEW Extra pounds in here somewhere.

Hey！You are work in for her this week. can you be nice?
Oh, she looks so elegant! - I know!

Oh, they're good!
but they're at home.
so how soon can we get a drink in this mama's hand and get this hen night started?
well, there's an opening night cocktail party in, like, 30 minutes.
Oh, right-o!
Cheerio!
Oh, MY GOD.
I sound like a local, right? - Right.
let's GO. - Yeah, right?
Hilda, you're getting married!
these past few months have been the most challenging
away from home and my family and my routine.
I've actually been slipping up a lot.
and I've got to say that things can get pretty dark when I drink, but I'm thankful that I can come here for your support.
I see a new face in the back.
will you please stand and introduce yourself?
my name is WILHELMINA, and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, WILHELMINA. - HI.
you know I love hanging out at your house
playing video games, watching movies
but do you think we should go somewhere else sometime?
what, like your house?
like on a date.
is that weird? - No.
no, not at all.
I love it.
you know, our first REAL DATE.
how about tomorrow night?
what are we gonna do?
I'll surprise you.
Hey, WHAT'S UP, J. - Hey.
Hi, bobby.
um, you know that my mom is in London, right?
Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm here.
listen, I'm thinking we have a special bachelor party for me, huh?
suarez men only.
tomorrow night. - ALL RIGHT.
sounds like fun, but Austin and I have plans.
but don't let me stop you and grandpa from, you know, tearing up the clubs.
can you change your plans?
this is important.
uh, I don't really think - it's cool.
we can do it another time.
Hey, thanks, Austin.
all RIGHT!
tomorrow night, the three amigos versus the big city.
big city, look out.
Hey, where'd that bag come from?
I rifled through your stuff earlier, and it was nothing there.
the designer had it messengered to me.
I could get used to that.
Ooh, as the designated bachelorette, I call dibs on the next freebie.
so sorry to interrupt, I just had to tell you, I loved your last show.
thank you.
Cheers.
okay, that was, like, the third person who's come up to you.
do they think you're Judi dench?
I'm afraid not.
you see, I had a little show here about a month ago, and, uh, well, some people kind of liked it.
Oh, come on.
Christina, your dreams came true.
that's not what I saw for you.
Oh, I really need a break from her.
we're gonna go get a drink at the bar. - Yep.
here you go, my dear.
Oh, my god, Christina, that's Lindsay Dunne.
he's, like, the most powerful publisher in all of Britain.
Oh, my--he's coming this way.
dunne, good to see you.
this is my good friend betty Suarez.
she actually works at "mode" magazine as a features editor.
ms. Suarez, a pleasure.
no, ME.
I mean, I am the pleasured one.
Betty IS A rising star, actually.
uh, and she's clearly very excited to meet you.
well, I'm flattered.
I'm always on the lookout for a rising star.
okay.
would you be interested in an opportunity to do more?
more? what do you mean?
well, one of my fashion magazines,"Ultramod,
has lost its New York-based columnist.
being that you're familiar with the scene over there, would you have any interest in interviewing?
you can still keep your job in Mode
that would be amazing.
Yes. - All right then.
call my office and set up a meeting.
I HAVE MY WORK, Which I love, but it cannot fill the void of my estranged family.
thank you for sharing.
okay, everyone. See you next week.
ms. slater.
I had no idea.
Tyler, please call me Wilhelmina.
okay.
I guess my little secret is out.
I'd APPRECIATE IT If you would not s a word to Claire or Daniel.
of course. I mean, I know how tough it is when you need to talk, and you can't turn to the people around you.
well, thank god we have our sponsors.
you do have a sponsor, don't you?
actually, Since I've been here, really haven't been able to connect with anybody.
well, don't say another word.
consider Willie your sponsor.
would you like another scone?
no, I can barely eat.
I'm so excited to go to these fashion shows.
Hilda, a couple years ago, I was lucky to be standing behind a tent pole, and now-- I mean, I don't want to get my hopes up
but I might get a chair!
Ooh! A CHAIR. That means a gift bag, and as your designated bachelorette
your name is already on it.
okay, we really have to leave.
a waiter has just come up to Amanda and asked her if she wanted bangers and mash.
she followed him into the loo!
turns out, it's just food.
okay, bachelorettes, since I can't be with you,
I have planned out the perfect day. Itineraries.
maximizes historical sites.
Minimizes-- - fun.
I was going " they're just suggestions, and I promise,
I will catch up with you as soon as I can.
all right, but, betty, you better not be late for my party, or I'm gonna be pissed.
you know that here that means drunk?
that works, too.
Oh, Amanda.
take lots of pictures!
so how are things going with the Meade's?
I was so touched by what you shared about getting to know your family.
Oh, I'm actually, uh, going out tonight with Daniel.
he wants us to get along.
that's very noble of him.
what is it?
I've just known the Meade's for a lo time, and they're not .
forthcoming.
well, Claire's been totally straight with me.
I mean, just this morning she was telling me about my father
how they met in rehab and how she's done everything she could to track him down for me.
Tyler, can I be frank?
they're terrified of you.
what?
well, it's true.
as far as they're concerned, you're just other claim to their empire.
I just want to get to know my family.
well, I know that, but I'm not as cynical as the Meade's.
I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to pay you off just to get rid of you.
they wouldn't do that, would they?
I've held my tongue long enough.
I do own half this company, too, so it's time we talk about Claire's bastard child.
what are you talking about?
you think this hayseed crawled out of his corncrib and came all the way to Manhattan just for a family reunion?
look, I'm no fan of the guy, but I don't think Tyler's after our money.
Daniel, are you that naive?
take my advice.
take him out on the town with his new big brother, get him through a couple of velvet ropes and make him feel like a big shot.
then write him a big, fat check, and stick him on the first train back to Hicksville.
well, you're probably right.
even the Meade's would never sink that low.
sugar?
Trey, There you are.
Hi, Trey.
it's TROY, And you know I don't like when you pick new names for me.
actually, I didn't know that.
you're so complicated, Trevor.
I'm sorry. I have been so busy lately.
I got this promotion, but you are in luck, because I've got a wedding this Saturday, and you're my date.
actually, I'm seeing someone else now.
what? no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
do you really care? You haven't called me IN, LIKE, TWO MONTHS.
I said I was busy.
look I get it, I know I came across a little stalker-y, and you got freaked out, but you were my first boyfriend.
I WAS EXCITED.
you used to sleep on my stoop.
okay, that--that was one time, and that was because you kept saying, "one minute, I'll be right down," and you never
you DIDN'T SHOW.
so I'M PATIENT.
there are worse traits.
anyway, now I'm with Brian, it all worked out.
I'm sure you'll find someone, too.
my ears are still ringing FROM THAT PLACE.
I couldn't even hear myself think.
Yeah, well, hey, we got a great plan "b" though, right?
pizza, beer, great company.
yeah how about we find something to watch?
good idea.
Hey, Justin, you wanna help me pick out a movie?
Betty's got a lot of great musicals here.
hey Justin, stop texting and join the party.
Hey, one second.
I have to take this, but I think I'm just gonna go over to marc's so I don't bother you guys.
Hey. - HEY.
I'm here. I'm all yours.
no more work.
well, I might have to do a little bit of work tomorrow.
but who am I to complain? Work is work, right?
what are you guys doing?
we decided that every time you say "work," we drink.
okay. I get it!
tonight is about fun, NOT WORK.
drink!
I SAID IT AGAIN!
dare!
Ooh, a brave choice.
all right, all right, all right.
Oh, god.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want
flash THAT GUY!
No! - Yes!
go show him your Mayan temple.
go. - OH!
no, I can't do that.
Yes, you can. watch.
no.
okay, I am the queen. I declare it.
I want you to flash that stranger!
do IT. - NO!
Oh, come on, betty.
okay, fine! I'll do it.
everyone said, "when you go to London,
I'm just glad there wasn't a line.
this is-- - hilarious! hi, gio.
but I didn't get .
hi gio let's just get cheech and chong back out.
Yeah, uh, amanda! - Oh, no, no, no.
girls, girls, stop it.
turn around and let everyone HAVE A LOOK!
enough. Stop. enough.
I don't generally .
or ever.
Oh, wait a minute. You didn't go to Rome with me, did you?
egg salad.
Henry--and to be fair,
I really didn't choose either one of you.
what are you doing here?
layover.
on my way to Provence. A food and wine trip. and you?
mode" sent me for work.
work!
Hey, listen, I'd love to catch up, but I want to see the London eye before it closes, and I'm only here for one re night.
you want to check it out with me?
no I can't um, it's Hilda's bachelorette party,
like, TWO SECONDS?
two seconds--don't--don't go.
okay. WHAT ARE You doing?
go with him!
what? WHY?
Betty, you are on vacation!
you have been all about work since you got here.
you've got a really nice guy here who has always been crazy about you. Go have an adventure!
he does look sort of good, doesn't he?
Yeah, and you might have a plus-one for my wedding!
go! have fun!
okay.
good NEWS. Queen Hilda has granted me permission to go.
it's like a club in here.
Yeah, ACTUALLY It used to have a stripper pole, but I guess it was too hard to wear a seat belt and work the pole AT THE SAME TIME.
look, I just want you to know,
I'm sorry about the way I've been treating you.
it's just, uh, Kinda freaky to suddenly find out you have a half-brother.
tell ME ABOUT IT.
and then--my mom, your dad
that's an image I don't want STUCK IN MY HEAD.
wait. my dad?
Yeah, you know, I never got along with Hartley, but I shouldn't have taken that out on you.
so you know my dad? - Know him?
he was the biggest pain in my ass for, like, six months when he was trying to take over Meade.
mom told you all that, I'm sure.
I think we're here.
just hang on a second, all right?
I'm gonna go grease the bouncer, make sure we get V.I.P. treatment.
be right back.
Tyler, everything all right?
I think Claire might've lied to me about who my father is.
Really?
I mean, she's been so nice to me since I got here.
why would she do that?
Oh, I don't know.
but a lie of that magnitude?
if you could never forgive her, it would be completely understandable.
I'm out with Daniel .
all I can think about is taking a drink.
slipups are inevitable.
and it's okay.
I certainly know how tempting a perfectly mixed cocktail can be. I can...
almost taste it right now.
it's like A warm hug going down my throat.
what should I do, Wilhelmina?
Oh, remember, if you happen to slip up,
I am always here for you, because that's what a sponsor's for.
Oh, I really love it here.
at this one fashion show, they served a sandwich that was bread, butter and French fries.
that's disgusting. - It was amazing
carbs, fat and carbs. It was a miracle.
the miracle is, you still eat like that and look as good as you do.
Oh, thank you. you, too.
Mmm, it's so nice to actually see London.
I've been stuck indoors at fashion shows ever since I got here.
yawn. - No, not yawn.
I really enjoyed it. - DOUBLE YAWN.
I'm serious! I saw two lines that were completely innovative, and most of the rest of them were surprisingly on trend.
Ooh-ooh! look at you.
you are a "mode"-y robot.
you're a mo-bot.
I am not a mo-bot.
I am betty.
I am a mo-bot.
I'm ON TREND.
okay, I know what this is.
this is you doing your little button-pushy flirty thing just to get to me.
no, no, I'm not.
Yes, you are. You are flirting.
I'm not flirting.
I am Gio. I am flirting.
I'm not flirting. - It is okay.
I am flirting, too.
Betty, I'm engaged.
I am
what?
is it just me, or is it weird that you didn't ntion you were engaged right away?
Why?
you disappointed?
hurts a little you can't have me, doesn't it, Suarez?
No! it doesn't hurt.
I'm just saying that ii were your fiancée,
I would think it was weird that you picked up your ex-girlfriend at a bar and took her on a romantic stroll.
what? I did not pick you up.
you flashed me.
it was a dare, and I was supposed to be flashing a complete stranger.
why are you still working at "mode"?
what? What--what does that have to do with anything?
I thought you wanted to write about things that mattered, like that crap you put in your blog.
what do you know about my blog? What, you read my blog?
don't get all excited, but, yeah, I've read it.
at least I did until you stopped posting.
I know. I'm busy.
I'm an editor now.
and I'm interviewing to write a fashion column for another magazine.
that's A JOB You never dreamed of.
fashion has been good to me, okay?
and since I've been doing it for a while, people actually respect me
as hard as that might be for you to believe.
and, okay, you know what? The perks are nice.
so you've gotten comfortable?
I'm not comfortable.
Oh, you're comfortable.
stop. Gio, don't. Don't do that thing that you always do, - the "I'm Gio," - look, I'm just saying,
I'm just saying, what was supposed to be a stepping stone for you has completely become your path.
it's not my path!
it's-- everything that I'm doing is just so that one day,
I can create the magazine that I want.
you sure about that?
because from where I'm standing it seems like you're scared to focus on what you really care about.
and you're getting more and more involved in something that doesn't even matter to you.
you know what, Gio?
I haven't even seen you in, like, years, and you show up and you think that in one hour you know my entire life?
well, guess what? you don't.
I have to go back to my sister.
I THINK You'll like this place.
it's even better than the last one.
Thanks.
Hey, take it easy. That's 50-year-old single malt.
what, so I don't deserve the good stuff?
I realize you haven't had it easy, and I want you to know that there is no way we're gonna send you home empty-handed, okay?
what?
this is for you.
you gotta be kidding me.
no, no. I'm happy to do it, Tyler.
U-you're actually trying to buy me off, huh?
no, I'm trying to help.
Hey, what are you doing? - All right. guys, come on. Let's take it up the street, all right?
no, no. We're fine, we're fine. Listen
are you really that afraid of me, huh? - What?
think I'm gonna make problems for you, little rich boy, huh?
you're MISSING-- WHAT ARE YOU
no, no, no, no, Tyler, listen
Christina, You know what's really weird?
you're, like, a big, fancy designer in London, and I'm a big shot stylist in New York.
you're a stylist now?
well, not in the sense that I have any clients, but I do get to combine all of my favorite interests
criticizing people, shopping and promoting world thinness.
believe it or not, she really is talented.
it's true. I am.
Christina, this might be the beer and the Jager and the tequila talking, but I'm really proud of you.
no, you're a big success!
but, you know, I was really terrified
all of a sudden, I didn't have a safety net.
but do you know what it did?
it forced me to take a chance on what I really wanted to do.
Hey, YOU'RE BACK!
how WAS YOUR TIME With Gio?
it WAS A LOT... Of work.
Work!? - OH, DEAR.
here, eat this.
I can't. I drank so much last night.
I don't remember anything after getting back to the pub.
no, neither do I.
I vaguely remember calling Billy MacDuff 00 in the morning and telling him that our first kiss tasted of sauerkraut.
seeing Gio made us have this idea to start calling up all our exes?
doesn't ring a bell.
I have to meet MR. Dunne now.
are you sure you don't want to stay just one extra day?
sorry. miss my boys.
we're not gonna get into a big thing here.
we're far too good of friends to say good-bye.
now you go and kick ass.
I will.
Hey, just the guy I WAS LOOKING FOR.
I got a surprise for you.
three words-- BE-YON-Cé!
I scored two tickets for you and me to see miss bootylicious herself tomorrow night.
what do you think?
Thanks. I just can't go with you.
what are you talking about? These tickets are unbelievable.
I'm talking fifth row!
Yeah, it's just Austin and I already got tickets.
and we're actually doing homework right now, so I can't really talk.
Hey, uh, what if I got one more ticket, huh?
we could all go together.
look, I changed my plans last night for your bachelor party, and I don't want to change them again.
what's going on here? I mean, I thought we were cool.
are you, uh, going through some .
you mad that I'm marrying your mother?
it's not about you, it
I just-- I can't go.
honestly, I was surprised that she chose denim, seeing as it's an iconically American fabric.
but the way she cut it was completely European.
Suarez, your materials are impressive.
Christina speaks highly of you, and you're obviously passionate about fashion.
Yes, I do. I mean, yes, I am.
good.
this is the part of the jo that I love
making someone's dream come true.
you are going to have front-row seats to every show in new york and access to anyone you want to talk to.
go-getter like you should move up through the ranks in no time.
so how does it feel to be adding "fashion columnist" to your résumé?
ms. Suarez?
um, I'm sorry.
uh, I can't do this.
I'm-- I'm sorry?
fashion is not my dream.
well, it's an odd time to be mentioning it.
Yes, I know.
but the last 24 hours have been crazy.
I flashed my ex in a bar, and then he called me
and I thought he was wrong,
I think he's right.
I'm following.
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate this opportunity, but if you read my blog, you will see what I really want to be writing about.
and it isn't fashion.
thank you so much for your time.
Yeah, I just don't-- I don't get it.
you know, he used to like me.
why am I so bad to hang around all of a sudden?
there's no explaining teenagers, brother.
well, I even offered to take his buddy, too, you know?
I don't know why he doesn't want me there.
you're trying too hard, bobby.
Justin will come back to you when he's ready.
Yeah, you're right. You're right.
Hey, I'm gonna go talk to him.
Hey, uh, you know, I was thinking about the concert.
you know, I mean-- you-- you guys can go.
just please don't tell anyone.
no, of course no - not even my mom.
all-- all right. Yeah, I won't.
but, uh, yeah, I think she'd be cool with it.
I just don't want her to kw.
all right. It's just between us.
okay.
thanks for meeting me.
lucky for you, I try to get to the airport at the last possible minute.
Ugh, I hate that. I like to be there two hours ahead of time to reorganize my carry-on.
there SHE IS.
there's the Suarez I know.
look, I'm sorry about last night.
I think that I got a little overdefensive because you made a good point.
I know I did.
I didn't have to say that. - No.
that was annoying, isn't it?
I did what you said.
I turned down that job.
I know it was the right thing to do, but it's still scary.
I mean, what if my blog doesn't take off? what then?
I mean, maybe I was on the wrong path, but at least it was a path.
you KNOW, When you broke up with me, I thought it was me
that I had to change myself-- and I went wild.
I tried wraps, open-face, all kinds of crazy stuff.
but then I finally went back to what was important to me, and that was making sandwichs-- bread, meat, bread.
and then I met this girl
a baker who makes the most amazing rustic sourdough.
our business took off, we fell madly in love, all because we pursued our passion.
you seem happy.
I am.
but you were right, too.
I was flirting with you a little. - Oh, really?
now I didn't mean anything by it. I didn't!
it's just our thing.
and besides, I know there's only ever been one guy for you.
can we not go down that path again?
we were having a nice moment.
you'll always hold special place in my heart, b.
I CAN'T BELIEVE You and Tyler got arrested for fighting.
are you sure you don't know where he went?
look, someone bailed him out right before you got there.
I didn't see who it was.
how did this happen?
he just went crazy. You should've warned me he was such an ugly drunk.
you let him drink? He's an alcoholic! !
well, how was I supposed to know that?
did he say anything? What did you talk about?
his mother, his hometown, Hartley
what? - I told him about his father
how Hartley tried to take over the company, how we forced him out.
Oh, god.
what is it?
I swore to call that I would never tell Tyler who his father was.
so I made up a story.
I told Tyler I met his father in rehab.
now he knows I lied.
mom. - What?
I'm sorry, okay?
it's gonna be all right.
I promise, we'll find him.
Oh, feeling any better?
Yeah.
thanks for bailing me out last night.
well, I told you I would forgive you slipped up.
I mean, it-- it happens to the best of us.
Yeah.
you WERE RIGHT.
they tried to buy me off.
that I'm gonna try to take what they've got.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
my heart is breaking for you.
what are you gonna do?
I am gonna take from them .
my share in Meade publications.
and I will support you any way I can.
Marc, I'm back!
what happened to you?
everything-- Troy broke up with me, I e two slices of pizza, and now I can't stop thinking about him.
Oh, my god. you ate pizza?
I can't talk about it! - GOOD. 'CAUSE I HAVE Some really big news of my own.
I think it's time for me to make this stylist thing happen for real.
good, you're here. I was just dropping off my reviews of the shows.
thank you so much for sending us to London.
you can read all about it on my blog.
I just posted all the gory details.
gory, huh?
Yeah, I sort of dropped the ball on blogging for a while, so I thought I would relaunch with something juicy.
how did, uh, things turn out with you and Tyler?
um, kind of blew up in my face, but at least I'm talking to my mom again.
you flashed Gio in a bar?
but in my defense, I had been drinking.
and at least now I know that all of my ex-boyfriend craziness is behind me.
Hey, it's Betty! Remember me?
anyway, I'm in London, and I'm thinking about you.
sorry. That was a hiccup, not a burp.
anyway, Hilda's getting married, and I was just wondering if maybe you'd want to come to the wedding as my date.
call me.
booze and pills weren't enough?
I'm sick.
if I can't marry into the Meade family
I will give birth to an heir.
we need to find a surrogate we can control,
someone who's desperate for money.
I'm the editor-in-chief of "mode,
and this office is now a nursery.
but I'm your father, you are my son, and we're in this together.
you're telling me that you're married?
I just wanted you to know because I feel like I'm falling for you.
Betty, hey! Welcome to our new home.
I really want to take on more responsibility.
I just... I thought that that was going to be at "mode.
Daniel
when I said that "player" magazine should show women in a more professional light, this isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Betty, that's your concept America's hottest lawyers.
I fined America's top female attorneys.
look, I know this is "player" magazine,
but does every spread have to be women in skimpy bras?
you know what? You're right. I hadn't thought of that.
let's lose those bras, please. -lose them.
no, that's not what I meant!
that's not what I meant.
what are you working on?
nothing. Just doodling, you know.
is that "mode"?
no, it's just, it's just the mock-up for Wilhelmina's first issue, you know.
I knew it, Daniel.
a part of you wants to be back at "mode.
no, look. I just want to see what Wilhelmina's up to.
you know exactly what she's up to firing, scheming,
looking for a pup to kick.
well, then I'm happy to be away from it.
see? Happy.
it's Daniel's copy of the mock-up.
crap. I forgot we still send it to him.
I'll make sure we take him off the list.
no. That's not why I here.
you see, Alexis, there are a lot of notes in here, and they're good.
I'm sure he has a lot of notes.
it's Wilhelmina's first issue, and he hates Wilhelmina.
no, see,
these aren't the notes of somebody who wants to get to Wilhelmina.
cover is too obscure. Will it sell?
pull up key ads. Where is '"mode" girl on madison'?
Alexis, he cares about this magazine.
he misses "mode.
I mean, he won't admit it, but he belongs here.
I appreciate your loyalty to your boss, Betty,
but Daniel doesn't work at "mode" anymore.
okay.
well, thanks for your time.
what's wrong?
nothing.
what's more romantic than lunch on foot with a view of rikers island?
you know, you deserve better than week-old lamb.
Yeah.
how about...
a real date?
Really?
Yeah, Jill got called for a layover flight leaving Wednesday morning.
I'm thinking maybe Wednesday night, we could do something special.
Hey. What--what happened to the smile?
no, nothing.
I just try to forget that you have a wife, but... You have a wife.
and I told you how things stand.
coach,
everything that you said to me about us having a future together just be honest with me, is that for real?
I promise.
you're not the other woman.
you're the only woman.
but if you take this shot and put it right here,
it draws your eye right to the ad.
Alexis, we go to print tonight.
my launch party's in two days.
there's time. And what about this cover?
Angelina Jolie in a block of ice?
I mean, do you have a shot that's a little less arty?
or at least one where you can see who it is?
wait a minute. Those aren't your notes the rounded o's of a stunted adolescent,
the stiff t's of someone who's clearly overcompensating.
this is Daniel's handwriting.
accuse.
Yes, these are Daniel's notes, and I happen to agree with them.
why is he even giving you notes?
he isn't.
Betty found them and brought them to me.
now why don't you put your ego aside for a second and just admit that your issue needs help?
I mean, where's our "'mode' girl on madison" feature?
who cares what the average woman wears on the street?
we shouldn't be taking their pictures.
we should be throwing rocks at them.
I think our readers like it.
our readers like what I tell them to like.
look, we agreed that "mode" needed a kick in the ass.
I'm giving it a kick in the ass.
I never tire of you saying that.
just take a look at Daniel's notes.
of course.
well, she -I see someone's going to be a problem.
Daniel?
Daniel is an overripe cantaloupe tumbling toward irrelevance.
I'm talking about Betty.
she's trying to get Daniel back in here. She's the problem.
okay, lunch.
no burrito for you.
Marc, why did you do that?
you have a lunch date.
with you?
no. With Wilhelmina.
Mademoiselle.
look at us, two women of color out for a fancy lunch on the town.
isn't this fun, girlfriend?
I guess.
and that blouse is heaven.
where did you get it? I love it.
okay. No, you don't.
no, I don't.
it's hideous, like driving through Ohio.
look, let's cut to the chase, Betty. I need you.
what?
you kept Daniel's files.
marc can't make heads or tails of them.
okay. Yeah. Fine.
I'll ask Daniel for a little bit of time to come and work on them.
or you could recognize a career opportunity when you see one.
Betty, you were the assistant to the editor-in-chief at "mode" before.
I think it's time you return to where you belong.
are you offering me a job?
at "mode," working for me.
look, Wilhelmina, I'm not leaving Daniel, and to be frank
I don't really trust you.
loyalty and suspicion--two very admirable qualities.
Betty, you belong at "mode,
and I think Daniel would understand.
I think Daniel will say that you want to hire me to ask me to do very bad, bad things.
wrong, ugly or morally suspect.
wrong, ugly or morally suspect.
that's what I have Marc for, dear.
don't answer now.
but don't throw your future away at "player.
she offered you a raise, too?
a little one, yeah.
well, every bit helps when you have a new apartment.
dad, I am not going to sell out Daniel to pay my rent.
you're not selling anyone out when you're making a good career move.
aunt Betty, you have to go back to "mode.
player" gets me nothing.
listen to me. I'm already changing.
Oh, that reminds me.
Tony wanted to know if he could have one of those signed "player" covers with all the star athletes for the school auction.
Oh, sure. Yeah, Hilda.
I'll just ask Daniel right after I tell him that his mortal enemy offered me a better job with more pay.
opportunities are coming your way.
this is something to be proud of.
I don't think that's how Daniel's going to see it, Dad.
I feel like I was cheating just talking to Wilhelmina.
you're not cheating.
it's not cheating to explore other options because your situation is at a dead end.
I just--I care about you. That's all.
well, one thing is for sure.
I have to go in there first thing in the morning and tell Daniel that I spoke to Wilhelmina,
because secrets in that place have a way of going bad.
someone's working late.
Yeah. I just came by to pick up a little homework.
lucky I ran into you.
I want to make sure you're coming to my launch party.
well, I hadn't really wonderful you know, I'm so glad we're talking.
I know it seems like I'm trying to poach your assistant.
excuse me?
Oh, Betty did tell you we spoke about her coming to work for me, didn't she?
I mean, I know you two have no secrets.
Yeah.
good. It's all out in the open then.
of course it's out in the open.
I mean, everything's out in the open between me and Betty.
how could you hide this from me?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God, just the thought of it, you sitting at her desk,
rolling calls for her?!
Daniel, I don't want to leave you.
then why are you going behind my back?
it wasn't like that.
okay, well, tell me what happened, please.
you met with her, she offered you a job and you didn't say no.
Daniel, working at "player" magazine isn't exactly my dream job.
I'm not happy here.
I am.
are you?
just stop right now.
I'm not leaving. Do you understand?
this is what I want.
well, maybe it's not what I want.
look, you want to go work for Wilhelmina, be my guest.
Daniel, can we please just talk about this reasonably?
I am being utterly reasonable!
if you hate it here,
if you think you'd be so much happier working for Wilhelmina, go.
is that what you want me to do?
is that what you want to do?
Wilhelmina?
does the offer still stand?
Daniel's like a different person since he's been at "player.
all of the fight and ambition is out of him.
you can't make people change, Betty.
at some point, you've got to look out for yourself.
I know. You're right.
but I'm working for Wilhelmina.
I know, the wicked witch of the east side.
but you're a smart girl.
I am, and I know exactly what she's capable of,
so I'll just keep my eyes open at all times.
truth be told...
I'm glad you're back.
Christina must have a doughnut in her pocket.
Betty Suarez under my rule.
how I have longed for this day.
Marc, we don't want her to quit. Oh.
we just want her to stay away from Daniel for a while.
just keep her busy.
Betty Suarez!
our newest employee.
Marc.
complimentary mimosa? Really?
no, but if you get the filing right...
I won't beat you with a bag of oranges.
you be nice to her.
don't eat or drink anything that he gives you, okay?
Oh, don't be silly.
Betty's on team slater now.
ere will be no drugging of you.
okay, seriously, you can't touch my nose anymore.
I-I don't understand. What--a holdup?
I thought his immigration papers were going through this week.
I'm sorry, Mr. Meade.
your son's grandparents in France filed a claim for custody.
Oh, no, no, no. I--look, I talked to them already.
they agreed to the-- well, I guess they changed their minds.
they want him home. Well, he is home. I'm his father.
look, yo-you have to do something about this.
the state department has to be able to do-- your family connections at the state can help expedite immigration,
but they filed the claim in court.
this could turn into a real custody battle.
Daniel jr. Lost his mother.
he's not going to lose his father, too.
these things can get ugly.
your son is 13 years old.
maybe before you get involved in a big legal
battle you should ask him what he wants to do.
don't interrupt, be invisible, and if Penelope del Rios asks,
you're a huge fan of her cosmetics.
you can't live without them. I don't wear del Rios cosmetics.
hold on.
Yes, you do.
take a look, Penelope.
I think you'll agree the new "mode" is more upscale,
more chic-- exactly your demographic.
you'll kick yourself if you don't take another two pages.
Yes, but we've been advertising in "mode" for two years now,
and there's been no uptick in our sales.
I see no reason to spend more money.
Oh, no. That's for wilhe-- enjoy.
Ah! Thank you, Betty.
gracias. Not so fast.
tell me... Betty, do you use my cosmetics?
it's right on your...
no.
I'm s--I-I can't afford them. Sorry.
I do. I'd rather starve than go without your night creme.
we are coming out with a budget line, you know?
Really? Mm-hmm.
well, you should advertise that in "mode.
I very much doubt the del Rios budget customers
are poring through the high-end pages of "mode.
Oh, they totally do.
my sister-- she has a salon in queens, and all those women love "mode.
They--it's all they talk about.
all day long, rah. "mode.
they just can't afford anything in it. Ah.
isn't that interesting?
I think we just found a way to sell your new line.
this is good. I came in saying no.
I leave saying... Yes.
can you believe it?
my first day here, and I helped sell.
did you flip your wig? I told you to be invisible.
she asked me a question, and I was helpful.
don't you get it? Wilhelmina doesn't need help.
you never outshine the queen.
Yeah, well, she landed a major advertiser, and by the way,
Wilhelmina totally smiled at me.
she wasn't smiling. She was showing her teeth.
Betty!
in my office now.
Wilhelmina...
I just want to apologize if I spoke out of to in your meeting-- shh.
I need some things for the launch party.
run to dior.
Luke created a signature perfume for me.
bee pollen-- make sure it's African.
I need some cleansing milk from Diane Bouch?
I also need the tiara that Catherine
the great wore at her wedding to peter iii.
it's part of the permanent collection of the museum of Russian antiquities.
I want to wear it to my party. But do they even-- shh.
could you give me a hint? I-- shh.
seriously, Wilhelmina, how am I-- shh.
by the end of the day.
come on. Right here. Come on.
Yeah! All right! It's coming. Oh, no!
God, you're getting good at this, aren't you?
are you having fun? Oh. Good time.
well, I figured since you had to start school tomorrow,
we might get in one more day of hooky.
uh, hooky? Like, uh, prostitute?
no, no. No prostitutes.
only when you're older.
I mean... Not at all, son.
I just thought we'd talk, you know, about important stuff.
so...
you, uh, you have grandparents back in France.
do you--do you miss them?
Oh.
I love them very much.
maybe, uh, we can visit?
Yeah. Yep.
sure.
you, uh, don't want to talk more?
Nah. You know what?
I think that's enough talking.
come on.
I don't get it.
I totally helped her on that del Rios account,
and now it's like she's trying to torture me with a tiara?
it's like she wants me to quit.
what's the worst she could do?
well, they say she once beat an assistant with a car antenna,
but I think it's just a myth.
Oh, god, no. Stuart.
what? What's wrong? I think he's doing drugs again.
what? Oh, my god, Christina...
I took this from his stuff.
EW! Ew! Ew! It's gross! Put it away.
that's disgusting, but I don't think it means he's doing drugs.
I know, but it can tell me if he is.
I've sent some hair samples to a lab.
well, what can I do to help you? I need you at "mode," Betty.
you're the only ally I've got there.
so please, just--just don't get fired.
well, I can try.
miss, I need you to stand back, pleas miss! Oh!
I'm sorry.
um, actually, I was wondering, who do I talk to about renting this tiara?
I mean, you don't have to laugh.
I can't be the first person to ask that question.
is there somebody else I can talk to?
I know it's a crazy request, but she really, really wants it.
you know what?
never mind, you're probably just going to laugh at me, too, right? Okay.
I'm guessing that's a no?
this is my favorite part of the job
injecting deadly poison into my boss' head.
Mm. Well, it helps that you have really feminine fingers.
it's a blessing.
no luck with Catherine the great, Betty the mediocre?
you've been gone a long time.
I know. I'm sorry. I ran into a few troubles.
I had to go to three different stores to get your bee pollen,
but I got it, and your cleansing milk cost over $600,
so I had to call accounting first for authorization. Where's the tiara?
I don't have it... Ha!
but they do.
it turns out the curator's boyfriend dumped her just because she gained a little bit of weight due to an underactive thyroid.
I know. It's so sad.
so I just sat with her for, like, an hour,
and I think that's all she needed was someone to talk to, you know, to listen.
are we to understand that you got the tiara by being nice to someone?
well, no, not exactly.
we also have to give the museum a full-page ad in next month's issue,
but I already talked to ad sales, and we worked out a barter agreement.
we give them ad space, they give you the tiara for 48 hours,
and also Ed and Andy have to be within 20 feet of the tiara at all times.
if you ask me, it's just beginner's luck.
I mean-- -Marc, take off your gloves.
Betty will be doing my botox today.
don't you think a doctor should do this or at least a nurse practitioner?
Oh, I'm so numb up there
I wouldn't know if you hit bone.
Betty, do you know why I hired you?
to help with your files?
I always suspected you were the brains behind Daniel Meade.
uh, well, no. No, th-that's just-- that's not true.
Daniel is very smart.
Yes, yes, yes. Smart as a whip.
but let's talk about you for a moment.
Betty, you passed the test.
so the tiara thing-- that was a test?
because I thought that it was some sort of punishment for speaking up in your meeting.
on the contrary.
I was very, very impressed.
and it made me think that maybe...
you were...
the one.
like "lord of the rings"?
Betty,
there's only been one other person who's been able to get that tiara--me.
when I was Fey Sommers' assistant,
she wanted that tiara for her launch party of her first issue, and I did it.
of course my methods were a little less wholesome than yours.
but I proved to her that given a seemingly impossible task,
I could accomplish it.
so?
Betty, you've proved that you have rare potential that must be cultivated.
I am going to groom you.
and lord knows, you need some grooming.
you will be my prot
and you will start with taking over my launch party.
but that's Marc's job.
and now it's yours.
Betty, I'm offering you a future.
after being my assistant, you could write your own ticket in this town.
and who knows?
maybe you'll be the next Wilhelmina slater.
Marc?
look, I'm hoping-- -I would rather eat butter.
I haven't even asked you to do anything yet.
you bossing me around is a crime against nature.
Marc, you're being ridiculous.
Sorcerers!
you've taken away from me everything that matters.
Marc, look-- ugh.
I didn't try and take your job from you, and I'm so sorry about this,
but I have to try and make a launch party happen in less than 27 hours,
and there is no way that I could do it without you.
so if you could, please, please, please...
try and help me find a life-sized,
anatomically correct black vodka ice sculpture of you know who...
God!
and then she just waddles back in here like a helpless brown weeble,
and while I'm not looking, plunges my world into the darkness.
Oh. Poor baby. Come here.
hush little homo don't you cry
Mandy's going to steal you a Prada tie
you're nice, but don't touch the hair.
it's just how I like it. Okay.
Hi. I'm looking for Betty Suarez.
Hi. I'm Betty Suarez.
don't be absurd.
I'm Betty Suarez. How can I help you?
Yeah, uh, can you guys just page her for me? Is that-- oh.
Tony! Tony. Hi. Uh... Oh, hey.
sorry about them.
no, no. It's, uh, okay.
is this a good time to get that signed copy?
um, right. I'll go down to "player" and get it.
you wait here, just maybe not so close to them.
Yeah.
here you go.
Oh, very cool.
you see that super bowl?
if I say yes, will you take your shirt off?
okay, and thanks for coming, tony.
will you tell Hilda that I'll call her later today? -yeah. Thanks.
Bye. Whoa!
I need Mr.-sugar-pants- bedroom-eyes' number.
Tony? No. I'm no giving you his phone number.
I need to see him again to give him his phone, which he accidentally left here when It fell out of his pocket into my hand.
wait a second. You pickpocketed coach Diaz?
I was in a trance. I barely remember what happened.
but these pictures of him kissing that slutty stewardess are really dulling my tingle.
my sister is not a stewardess.
but it has to be delivered at 8: 00 p. m. sharp
sharp because it's an ice sculpture, and I don't want it to melt.
don't mind me.
I took a train for a half-hour from queens to
eat soggy dumplings by myself and watch you talk.
okay, I'll call you back in the morning. Thank you.
Hilda! I'm sorry. I have this launch party tomorrow.
it's driving me crazy.
okay, so I heard tony was sexually harassed by your coworkers.
Yeah, that happens a lot in that place.
Oh, before I forget, you have his cell phone?
right. Okay.
uh, so, Hilda, this is what I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, god. This is-- this is hard.
so I saw some photos on Tony's phone...
of him and another woman.
are you okay?
I'm so sorry, Hilda. Say something.
that's his wife.
what?
wait. They're, like, separated?
well, you know, it's complicated.
what, you're dating a married man?
see? This is why I don't tell you things. Because you judge.
Yeah, because, Hilda, that would be wrong.
well, I didn't know that he was married when we started dating, -and then-- -Hilda, what are you thinking?
you have to get out of this. This is just going to end bad.
well, who says it's going to end? We're going to make it work.
look, can't you just be happy for me?
no. He has a wife.
you think I don't know that? You think that doesn't tear me up?
well, then walk away.
I can't.
I'm in love with him.
I'm not hungry anymore.
like I said, uh, remember not to get too hung up on any one girl.
You're--u're young. You got to play the field. -quoi?
and listen in class, okay? That's what I told you.
Uuum, outer le teacher.
Oh.
Papa, uh, your French is, uh, how you say--sucky.
just have a good day.
Bonjour, Daniel.
you're a natural father.
am I being selfish?
his grandparents want him back in France.
I know he misses them.
well, he can miss them and still want to be here with his father.
he's in a foreign country.
he's away from everything he knows, everyone.
don't you think he'd be happier with them?
doesn't really matter what I think, does it?
I know.
I have to ask him.
I'm just afraid I'm not going to get the answer I want.
I don't want to lose him.
where do you want this ice sculpture?
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be here right now.
the party isn't till tonight. She'll melt.
Emily.
can you please take these guys down to the Italian restaurant and beg them to let us use their walk-in?
I don't care if you have to buy every pizza in the place.
just hurry. We don't want her to start sagging.
you guys, seriously, can you stop goofing around?
you know how Wilhelmina gets. -yeah, how does she get?
tell us. -yeah, tell us.
tell us.
little miss thing here has been working for Wilhelmina for half a minute,
now she's all up in her grouch.
I have been up all night, working on this party,
and there are still a million things that we have to do.
a million and one, actually.
Wilhelmina wants you to shred all this old mail into confetti.
I'm busy.
can you do it?
uh, let me think.
no.
just because you're running this
party doesn't mean you can boss me around.
and you may be in Wilhelmina's good graces today,
but that doesn't mean anything about tomorrow.
loyalty is not one of Wilhelmina's strong suits.
Oh, but, you know, I guess it isn't one of yours either.
what? I am loyal.
Really?
is that why you dumped Daniel the second
he got in the way of your career ambitions?
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
that's exactly what Wilhelmina would have done.
you two are a lot more alike than I thought.
happy shredding.
Betty, you've proved you have rare potential.
look, if you want to go work for Wilhelmina, be my guest. ...
maybe you were the one.
if you think you'd be so much happier working for Wilhelmina, go.
you two are a lot more alike than I thought.
I'm so numb up there I wouldn't know if you hit bone.
there you are, Madame editor. -thank you, Marc.
now be a dear and go fetch me some carrot shavings.
I'm feeling snack-ish.
what the hell are you all staring at?
don't you have some work to screw up?
look at me when I'm yelling at you! Don't look at me.
you--go fix your teeth.
You--stop eating that doughnut.
You--lose 10 pounds.
you're fired. You're fired.
you're all fired.
Hi, Betty. Uh, it's Daniel.
remember? We used to work together. -no time.
no, no, no. Betty, I just want to-- security!
no, no, no. Wait. Wait. W-wait. Wait.
no. I just wanted to ask you a question. Please.
what the hell is that?
not the puppy!
well, big date with the coach tonight?
not wearing that. Mom, leopard and zebra?
they fight each other in the wild.
you'll never survive the evening.
I think she looks beautiful. You know why? She's happy.
I'm not. Look, work with me here.
this is what I do.
okay. Thank you.
you're welcome.
and thank you, papa.
you deserve this, mija.
Yeah. I do.
I know you're tired of me saying this, but I have to.
you are wasting your time and your talent at "player.
you are a good editor. Betty. -I'm not finished.
you belong at "mode," Daniel.
it is the most important magazine at this company, your family's company.
you were good at your job, and if you don't believe me, then read these.
Wilhelmina had somebody hide all the positive letters to the editor when you were in charge.
she was going to have me shred them.
they're all positive?
all of them, and there are tons.
your June cover the one that she said was, -a pimple on the butt of fashion -oh. She said that?
not the point. These people loved it.
and "mode" girl on madison"?
some of these people said they subscribed just for that.
Daniel, you have to show these to Alexis.
come on. She doesn't care about me. -she cares about "mode.
Yeah. Okay, look.
I really appreciate what you're doing.
and, yes, of course I want to be back at "mode.
why do you think I got so mad at you, Betty?
because you're there reminding me of that every single day.
Wilhelmina won. I lost. It's over.
Daniel, anything you truly want...
has to be worth fighting for.
you used me! You just wanted the money to buy drugs!
Christina, that's not true.
Oh, I think it is, because I had a piece of your hair tested.
what?
they found oxycontin, heroin.
it's like rush Limbaugh fornicated with Amy Winehouse, -and they spawned you. -you had me tested?
Yes, I did. Why, have you got a problem with that?
you don't understand. Now just listen to-- just get your hands off me!
I swear to god,
I am this close to calling immigration and having you deported.
Aye. Right.
Oh, what? You don't think I would do it?
just you watch me.
Yes! Papa.
look I made it to the next level.
would you come here for a second?
there...
there's something I want to ask you.
it's important.
okay, so your grandparents want you to come live with them in France.
Comprend?
Oh, oh.
um, mais, uh, je veux...
que tu, uh, habite avec moi.
I-I-I want you to live here... With me.
look, I guess...
I guess what's m-most important here is...
what do you want?
you... are my father.
and... I want to stay with my father.
okay. Great.
good.
so we'll stay together, and, um, and we're going fight for that.
come on. Let's see how good you are.
did you get a drink?
are you having fun?
Betty, you've really outdone yourself.
this party is beautiful.
you're not wearing the tiara.
Oh, god, no.
I'm the editor-in-chief of a fashion magazine.
I wouldn't be caught dead in a tiara.
right. Of course you wouldn't.
well, this is for you.
it's my two weeks' notice.
I thought I could work for you, but I can't.
I do want to be successful, just...
not by hurting people.
I really misjudged you, Betty.
under those gaping pores and caveman eyebrows,
I thought you were smart.
you think life is all about who's right and who's wrong,
but history is written by those who win, not by those who are the nicest.
enjoy your party.
Betty, why don't you stay?
this party is about to get very interesting.
Hey, tony. Are--are you here yet? 'Cause I don't see you.
hey... Bobby. Uh, sorry I didn't call you back.
I had a family thing come up.
she didn't go out of town? You're not coming?
Yeah, that's right.
um, can I follow up with you tomorrow?
is she there with you now?
sure. Sounds good. All right, we'll--we'll talk tomorrow.
honestly, Alexis,
if this is about a bunch of ridiculous letters, -I can assure you-- this isn't just about the letters.
I'm not happy with the magazine.
I think your cover is cold.
well, I had a very specific vision.
I didn't expect you to understand it.
well, I guess it was lost on a few other people, too.
your first day sales numbers are in...
and they're not good. -impossible.
your relaunch of "mode" is our lowest selling issue in months.
while you're valued here as our creative director, I've made a decision.
if you'll excuse me.
ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention.
I'm happy to announce that tonight we are welcoming back as editor-in-chief of "mode" magazine--Daniel Meade.
Betty.
Marc.
well, here we are, as if nothing's changed.
you left those letters for me, didn't you?
you planned this whole thing so that I would be back
with Daniel and you could have Wilhelmina all to yourself.
don't be absurd.
I would never do anything to hurt Wilhelmina's interests...
unless they're hurting mine.
don't forget. I still own a third of this company.
your unborn child owns a third of this company, not you.
you would be nothing without that baby.
but don't worry. You're still our creative director.
Yeah, and I'm more than happy to have you come work for me.
you can't push me aside.
Oh, really?
you are going to regret this. I swear.
don't you ever threaten my children, Wilhelmina.
you have no idea the lengths I will go to protect them.
look, Daniel, I'm sorry. -look, Betty, I never wanted you to leave.
I would never even consider working for that-- -me first. Please.
thank you...
for having faith in me.
that's what friends are for.
you're coming back, right?
well, that depends on whether or not I can keep the raise Wilhelmina gave me.
we are talk about using the moment of your leverage.
it's good to have you back, Daniel.
it's good to be back.
now seriously, about the raise
you know, once you go there,
you can't really go back. Really?
Yes. I'm here right now.
no, I can't, at least not yet.
at some point, they're gonna figure it out.
I don't know. Maybe.
Liz, what's taking you so long?
okay, she's calling me, I gotta go.
coming! What are you doing in there? Stealing all my jewelry?
Yes, all of it.
okay. So here's what I am going for.
cute, but not glamous. Mm.
put together, but not like I tried too hard, and sexy, but not slutty.
okay. Basically a dress that says, "look at me, I am 90 days sober, and we're celebrating.
so...
I like it.
Sam, you can't just go for the first one.
besides, I'm don't really know if this my taste.
it's not. It's mine, remember? -Right.
Ooh, I like that color on you. - Mm, it's cute.
okay, that goes in the maybe pile.
honestly, I have no idea whose dress that is or how it got in my closet.
Oh, yeah, I think this is the one.
actually, I kind of need that.
you do? For what?
steven and I are going to San Francisco this weekend, and I wanted to wear it.
it's not for the hotel.
it's our Rutigliano's trip.
you guys still do that?
do you really need to keep celebrating your first date?
that's how we keep the magic alive.
Hey, honey. - Mm.
how was your workout? - It was great.
what is this, a dress sale?
Lizzy's 90-day sober ceremony is Sunday night.
Pleeease?
okay.
because you're my sister and I love you.
I'm proud of you.
thank you. We both are.
Yeah, come here. Oh, you are too sweaty.
I will get you later.
you guys are gonna be back, right?
you not gonna get roped into some hotel business while you're there?
of course, Liz. We are not gonna miss this.
Oh, thank you.
north Korea
unauthorized man on level 6.
what happened?
he get in with the entry code.
alert all personnel.
hurry.
can I help you?
there's been a breach in Lab C.
that is not my problem.
if you don't mind, we need to get back to work.
it's too hot in here...
...Someone should cheek the air conditioning.
go pack your things.
father, but...
hurry.
Okey
I leave tonight.
Yes, father.
you're late.
this is very dangreous. We're in trouble if someone sees us.
here is the money. I need a minute.
sun will make sure you are safe.
I'll send someone for you.
and they will bring you to me.
you have to be braw, May.
promise me you'll be brave.
promise?
I love you, father.
I love you, May.
we have to go.
goodbye, May.
about time.
how is it that even when you call us, you're still disappointed when we show up?
I thought you were room service.
I ordered a quesadilla 35 minutes ago.
look, Shaw, this thing the three of us got going on, it's working.
so when are you gonna stop wasting the CIA's money on hotel rooms and settle down?
I know this really nice place just near us.
my lodgings are not your concern.
that is.
brilliant North Korean particle physicist.
a crown jewel of North Korea's covert weapons program.
we've gotten word that he wants to defect.
your mission is simple.
facilitate said defection.
north Korea's not what I'd call a simple defection.
operationally speaking, North Korea is off limits.
shin Won will be attending a particle physicist symposium in Geneva.
geneva's nice. Glad you approve.
our latest assessment indicates that he might be carrying a prototype of the Delta, his latest invention.
what's it do?
war birds at the Pentagon say it has limitless weaponry applications in terms of changing states of matter.
he'll be assigned a handler.
which is exactly why you're going to go undercover as a fellow scientist.
your mission will be to infiltrate the symposium and facilitate an undetectable defection.
that would be my quesadilla.
transport plane for Switzerland leaves at 04：00 hours.
Hi, come on in.
these folks were just leaving.
this is like science fiction.
this Delta he created can apparently change the state of any solid form in seconds.
can you imagine the things this guy is capable of making?
he also created styrofoam.
and air.
Sam? - What?
Oh, sorry.
sweetie, I know you're upset about missing our trip.
I'm not.
this is clearly more important than our going to San Francisco, but I can't miss Lizzy's thing too.
look, we'll be back for Lizzy, okay?
and we'll go to Rutigliano's next weekend.
actually, we can't. We have a dinner party.
somebody booked us for a dinner party?
no, we're having a dinner party.
I told you about it. Couples night.
okay, first of all, just saying,"I told you about it
doesn't make up for the fact that you never told me about it.
and what couples?
we don't know a lot of couples.
we do know a lot of couples.
it's just that you always have some problem with one of the two people in the couple.
that's ridiculous.
it's Laurie and Ron and Joe and Patty.
Joe and Patty? Really?
what's wrong with Joe and Patty?
come on. I can't talk football with a guy who's still rockin' a jheri curl.
well, I guess you'll have to talk about something else then.
this is what normal people do.
they have dinner parties.
all right, we'll talk about it later.
this particle physics is tough.
I got eight hours to learn eight years of schooling.
have I ever told you how attracted I am to intellectuals?
have I ever told you about the string theory?
because I love...
these strings.
particles, atoms, whatever.
Bienvenue A Geneve
string, quantum, or particle?
string.
ray Parsons, Brookhaven National Lab on loan from Caltech.
Brookhaven? - Yeah.
so you must know Dr. Barnes.
Dr. Barnes-- head of Brookhaven's nano particle project. Of course.
wrote the paper on the higgs boson attraction.
his paper on the Higgs Boson attraction as it relates to dark matter is asinine.
this guy's asinine. I loved that paper.
he's just the reason I went into the field.
Oh, that's silky smooth, sir.
excuse me.
professor Parsons?
Louise Bergher. - Hello.
I'm with the symposium hospitality committee.
please follow me.
but of course.
hospitality indeed. - Thanks, honey.
shin Won's lecture starts in ten in the Savoy room.
should last about 20 minutes.
soon as he wraps up and heads to the elevators, we'll make the move to grab him.
you okay, Hoyt?
pulling up elevator control panels now.
I am liking the horn-rims, sweetie.
hmm, smart's the new sexy.
trust me, it's not.
chem engineering - poly sci double major, and, technically, I'm still a virgin.
there he is. Shin Won.
and that must be his security detail.
you know, if we wanted to, we could neutralize the guards and take him out right now.
let's stick to the plan, hotshot.
prying Shin Won away from those guards isn't gonna be easy.
where is the Delta?
only you and Shin Won were in the facility the night of the break in.
which means one of you took it.
you will twll me how you smuggled it out of the lab...
...and where it is. Now!
shin Won! He has it!
as you can see, by manipulating Quarks...
okay, agents Bloom,
operation Shin Won Defection is on.
after the Q&A they'll have to pass by you to get to the elevators to get downstairs.
on my way to the elevators now.
signal me when you're close.
in addition to the deviations from reflected radiation, this also involves both diffuse and spec
something's up with the guard.
any questions?
sorry. No questions. We got a problem.
what's going on?
the State is displeased.
come with me.
change of plans.
the guard's taking him the other way.
I'm checking the hotel floor plan.
if they're not going to the lobby, they must be going to the two service elevators in the back.
I'm on my way.
hold It!
thank you.
almost got control of the elevator, sir.
ten more seconds.
okay, buckle your seatbelt.
Hoyt, we're clear. Okay.
elevator doors unlocked.
let's go before anyone else shows up.
are you the ones they sent for me?
are you ready to do this?
welcome, sir.
how about an ice cold soda to commemorate this moment, huh?
okay. I mean, it's a good idea.
it's not even that cold, and I've obviously put my fingers in it, so I'll alert the debrief team.
I wish to modify the conditions for my defection.
Modify? How?
if you want to know where the Delta is, you must do one thing for me.
hold on. That was not part of the plan.
listen to me.
when word gets back what I've done, they'll try to find my daughter and use her to get to me.
I can't let that happen.
you need to go and get May for me.
she's the only reason I'm doing this.
I want her to have a better life.
we don't have approval to enter North Korea.
do you have children?
family then?
a sister.
if she needed you, you would do anything for your sister, right?
of course.
this is my daughter.
without her, I would have nothing.
get approval and rescue my daughter.
only then will I tell you where I've hidden the Delta.
a wrinkle?
you do have the asset, correct?
uh, yes. And the Delta?
that we don't have.
he says he'll only give it to us if we get his daughter out of North Korea.
no, absolutely not.
no, no. North Korea is not approved.
we cannot send non-U. S. government covered personnel into a denied area with the possibility of diplomatic repercussions. No!
sir. Sir, with all due respect, Steven Bloom, while his career was tragically shortened by a combination of marriage and catering, is a legend.
I'm talking Khartoum in '02.
that is superhero stuff. The Kozlowski Defection?
how could he be in six places at the same time?
hoyle, how would you like to spend the rest of your service as a cipher clerk in Botswana?
it's Hoyt, actually, but, no, I'm all set.
and as for Shin Won's daughter, that's a matter for the state department to sort out.
we can't risk the lives of agents on such an operation.
I repeat, any and all operations inside the DPRK lines are strictly forbidden without approval of NSC.
you will convince Shin Won that it is in his best interest to cooperate and hand it over!
do you roger that?
loud and clear.
I could check with accounting, see if we can bump up his resettlement package.
throw a car at him, let him have his pick of cities to settle in.
you know, a car's good.
maybe 20-inch rims, like, a house with a jacuzzi.
he's not going to forget his daughter for rims and a jacuzzi.
you got any better ideas?
as a matter of fact, I do.
Oh, no. Absolutely not.
absolutely not what?
we can't do that, honey.
we can. - What can't we?
I don't care what Shaw says.
she wants to go to North Korea.
the news has already leaked at home.
my daughter is in danger.
if the United States is not willing to help,
I'd like to leave.
we've been cleared to extract your daughter.
you have? - Yes.
we'll leave as soon as we can.
thank you. Thank you so much.
where is she?
in Pyongyang. I can give you the address.
she's safe for now, but it won't be long before they find her.
then we should get going. - All right.
check there bags.
passport, please.
what is the nature of your business?
food relief inspection.
come with now.
we are from Canada, guests of Minster Wang.
we have a letter.
Mr. Wang is a great and powerful man.
what business do you have with him?
we have come here to discuss a very important food matter.
why don't you call the Minister and ask him youself if you don't believe us?
I'm sure he would love to be botherd by you about this.
passport and cellphones.
you are free to go.
we will provide you with tour guide...free of charge.
that's not necessary.
we insist.
conditions of you stay.
thank you.
this guy shouldn't be hard to lose.
we don't have a lot of time.
how long can a 16-year-old girl hide from the North Korean police?
let's not find out.
police! Open up!
quickly, hide in the pantry!
captain Nahm: Office of State Security.
we know you're hiding Shin Won's daughter.
I don't know what you're talking about.
get out of my way!
shin Won is a traitor now where is his daughter?
I have a special hotel picked out for you.
tomorrow we will take the grand tour befor your meeting.
great.
anything you want, you just call and I'll be right there.
we'd like to drive around a little.
of course...
... I'd be honored to show you some of our beautiful city.
how long have you lived here?
me? I was born here.
we're in.
I knew it. Food programs are genius.
they have a transport plane leaving tomorrow night.
that is the last one.
you'll need to be on that plane with Shin Won's daughter, or you'll have to cross the DMZ, which I do not recommend.
got it.
our tour guide's on us like glue.
any idea where we can ditch him?
I understand, sir.
Where's a good place to lose somebody in the city?
lots of people.
Kangdong Market. It's always crowded.
they must hurry.
okay, Kangdong Market's your best bet.
tell him to take us to Kangdong Market.
we would like to see Kangdong maket.
I am here to assit but please, go quickly so we can get to the hotel.
I don't like what's going on.
we need to get out of here.
what do you have in mind?
see those crates?
I think that's our exit.
follow me.
Ooh, what are you gonna do, start stabbing people?
no. Create a diversion.
we need to move...Now.
where is your father?
we know he's been planning this for quite some time.
he didn't tell me anything.
you know what happens to family members of trators?
they get sent to re-ducation camp.
and never leave.
where is your father?
this is it, right?
Yep. This is the address Shin Won gave us.
let's hope we got here before anyone else did.
you know what I love about picking locks?
every country's a little bit different, but never gets boring.
I know. No matter how many times I do it, there's always something so satisfying about it.
hold this for a second.
I'll check in here.
I'll check in the bedroom.
we got company. - Police?
hope not.
who the hell are you?
what are you doing here?
probably the same thing as you.
looking for Shin Won's daughter.
we work for DGSE.
french intelligence?
you are CIA, right?
I'm Marcel Geffard.
this is my wife, Camille.
why so surprised?
didn't your supervisor brief you on who else Shin Won contacted?
no.
and it doesn't matter that Shin Won double dipped.
we have him.
it was our understanding that the Americans were unwilling to accept his conditions.
well, here we are, so your understanding is incorrect.
excuse me.
what does it say?
it's a name.
captain Nahm.
I spoke to Hoyt.
he confirms Shin Won called the DGSE because he thought we were saying no.
and they check out, but I don't trust them.
we should stay close just in case.
okay, here's the plan.
we find out where Captain Nahm's police station is, use the French as a diversion, break in, and extract Shin Won's daughter.
okay, hold on a second. You're doing this thing again where you're making a decision without consulting with me.
I do not do that.
you had our bedroom repainted when we were in Germany and planned a dinner party without telling me.
okay, I get it. I do that, but we're not leaving North Korea without her.
I know that.
I'm just trying to figure out what to do with these two.
look, we both want to get the girl and recover the Delta before it's lost.
instead of working apart, I propose a joint effort.
it will save us the trouble of wasting time keeping tabs on each other.
besides, I'm very familiar with Captain Nahm.
my ex-partner and I were here posing as journalists once.
we were pulled into Nahm's police station and my partner's cover didn't hold up under his questions.
he didn't make it out.
so you'll take us to the station?
Yes, but now we must hurry.
where Ru? ceremony? Remenber?
what is it?
we're missing Lizzy's ceremony, and I promised I'd be there.
I don't like lying to her like this.
look, I know it's hard, but she'll forgive you.
you know that.
maybe this time.
but what about the next time I miss something and can't tell her the truth?
it's just...
sometimes living this double life isn't so easy.
we'll figure it out.
come on.
that's it--the station.
that doesn't look like a police station to me.
you sure this is the right place?
shop in front, police station in back.
in North Korea, nothing is as it seems.
believe me, if Captain Nahm has her, she's in there.
so what are we gonna do?
we need a plan.
the interrogation room is near the rear exit.
they probably have her there.
guards? Three, maybe five.
that shouldn't be a problem between all of us.
I say we split up, go two in front, two in back, attack from both sides. Mm-Hmm.
we have no guns.
fine. We overpower a guard and get a gun.
we don't have time to waste here. Exactement.
we're talking about the North Korean police.
we can't just walk through the front door.
we at least have to wait till it's dark.
okay. We go in as the sun goes down.
okay.
are you read to tell me the truth?
I did tell you...
captain Nahm.
captain Nahm.
for Captain Nahm.
Hey! Where are you going?
get out of here now!
very important delivery for the captain.
go!
you can't be here!
go go now!
it's okay. It's okay.
your father sent us. Don't worry.
it's gonna be okay.
Where'd they go?
I thought they were with you.
they double-crossed us.
come on.
Hello?
we retrieved your daughter.
you have? Thank you.
can I talk to her?
father.
I'm in the car.
...I'm scared.
are you listening?
I look forward to cooperating with your country.
we're not so interested in that.
listen to me.
you will hand over the Delta to us.
I don't have it.
it's someplace safe.
you tell us where it is, you get your daughter back.
we'll be in Geneva in the morning.
Secheron train station tomorrow, 7:00 A. M.
we'll find you.
Secheron train station, 7:00 A. M.
good night.
6: 30 in the morning. Am I on The Today Show?
I thought you checked out the French!
I did. I did.
I checked them out like a library book.
as of yesterday, they were French agents in good standing.
Hey, did you bring any coffee or something?
or like a Danish-- Hoyt, so what happened?
okay, we'll talk danishes later.
best guess, they went independent, right?
capture Shin Won's daughter, leverage her for the Delta, which goes to the highest bidder, and then-- any contact?
not yet, but Shaw called.
he was not happy. Mentioned Botswana again.
Where's Shin Won? - Sleeping, although probably not after your husband slammed that door.
man, you slammed that so hard,
I didn't know what was happening.
Hoyt? He's gone.
now, when you say gone...
you must have missed the contact.
he could be anywhere.
please tell me you bugged the room.
sir, this isn't my first North Korean defector.
okay, it is. This is number one, but I did bug the place.
Hoyt's voice: Now, you're also gonna need a baseball team to root for.
I'm partial to the Cubs.
sorry.
just pretend like you didn't
I want my daughter first, then I will tell you.
Secheron train station, 7:00 A. M.
we have 20 minutes. I'm on it.
you and Hoyt need to figure out where Shin Won hid the Delta.
if I miss them at the train station, getting the Delta is our only shot at saving Shin Won and his daughter.
Hey. Be careful.
okay, are you sure he didn't have it on him?
100%. I tossed the room and his clothes when he was asleep.
he must have hidden it before we grabbed him.
he's only been to the symposium.
and I've been looking through security camera footage from there.
let me see. Yeah, smart. Fresh pair of eyes.
there.
there's nothing there.
hold on. Rewind.
look, the power point's being run off the laptop, right?
right. He uses the keyboard.
what does he need the remote for?
when he's taken off the stage...
no remote.
the remote's gotta be the Delta, and the Delta's in the podium.
it's the last day of the symposium, the first speaker is in 20 minutes.
Ah, Martin Vilner. His theory
Hoyt, Hoyt, Hoyt. Let's just go.
get in the car.
are you ok?
yes
I'm so relieved.
where is the Delta?
let her go, and I'll tell you.
you are in no position to negotiate.
do anything to me.
kill me if you want.
just let her go.
after we get the Delta.
nobody's going anywhere until we have it.
it's at the hotel in the conference room.
I hope you're not lying.
it's the truth. I hid it under the podium.
now let her go, please.
stay here. When I call...
...Kill them both.
electromagnetism is responsible for keeping electrons and protons inside atoms.
and we all know the implications of electromagnetism led Einstein's development of special relativity.
and this is brought on without altering fundamental force.
but let's take a look at what we have going on here.
what we have is, you'll notice the meditating gauge bosons reverse their current state.
now I will open the floor to questions.
Yeah, hi.
uh, I think there's a mistake with your third vector.
there is?
Yes, let me come up there and demonstrate.
get out of the way!
if you got a shot, take it! Cover me!
don't say a word. I'll do the talking.
you lying, conniving bitch!
don't even think about it.
give me that.
you should probably take it.
I'm so sorry I had to do this to you, May.
I understand. If was the only way.
you sure you're okay?
I'm fine. father.
everything is good now. Everthing worked out.
yes it did. We don't have to worry anymore.
you were so brave.
your mother would be proud of you.
I'm sorry, but we have to leave.
thank you again for helping us.
for saving us.
of course.
I don't know how I would survive without her.
you don't have to.
it's called protocol, folks.
this is why we have a chain of command.
you can't just infiltrate a totalitarian state without creating an international incident.
do you read me?
Yes, but
I have been on the phone 24/7, putting a spin on this little fiasco trying to save your sorry asses against my better judgment.
luckily, the North Koreans have yet to acknowledge
shin Won's defection for fear of losing face.
look, we acquired a strategic piece of equipment, successfully brought back a scientist, and brought a family back together.
doesn't that count for anything?
a regular life saver moment.
now if you'll excuse me.
come on.
good job.
I am so sorry.
you promised, Sam.
I know, and I feel terrible.
that hotel job was more important than being there for me?
of course not, Lizzy.
it's just, you know, with dad gone and mom who knows where, you are all I have.
you're my only family.
I know, and we have to look out for each other.
you're totally right.
and it won't happen again.
I promise you, nothing is more important to me.
I just want you to know how proud I am of you.
well, I know it's not San Francisco.
it's perfect, just the two of us.
feels really normal.
we are gonna do this, Steven.
lead a normal life.
and I don't just mean couples night or dinner parties or going to the movies.
I just want to feel that everything here's still real.
by the way, um,
I love the new color of our bedroom.
Thanks.
but I'll ask you next time.
no, you don't have to.
and if you want to have couples over, I'm good with that.
we can hold off on that.
the last couple that broke bread with us double-crossed us and tried to kill us.
good point.
dinner for two's all I need tonight.
Cheers.
buenos dias, Peru!
gracias.
today.
I come here humbled before you with you...
ready to lead Peru into a bright future!
three days earlier
Hey, I thought you were coming in early.
I'm sorry, honey. I did go to the gym and the Farmers' Market.
then I had a thing for the fentin-Brown wedding.
a thing? I thought that wedding was a month ago.
exactly a month.
mark wanted to make bob breakfast in bed for their anniversary, so I talked him through the frittata.
have I ever told you that you get way too emotionally involved with your clients?
Yes. All the time.
but it's hard not to care for the people you cook for.
it's really not that hard.
there is a client in the office.
she came through the back entrance and made herself very comfortable.
Jennifer anthony. She said she knows you, Sam.
Really?
Ah. It's like time stood still, and so did your ass.
this is Steven, my husband.
Hey, nice to meet you. -- This is Jennifer.
we went to yale together.
nice to meet you!
so Jennifer, it's really great to see you, but I assume you want to hire us for something.
I just got a job in L. A. Anchoring the local news, and I'm throwing a little party to celebrate.
and when I heard you became a cook here,
I knew I had to use you.
actually, I'm a chef.
she's also pretty brilliant.
no argument from me.
she was quite the star in J School. Journalism.
she was the only person professor Schilling recommended for the news corps internship in hong kong.
he must have freaked when you quit.
I heard he left Yale.
he did.
actually, he died a few years ago...
in a car accident.
Sam, we gotta go. Nice to meet you.
so sorry, Jennifer. We have another meeting.
but my sister Lizzy will take great care of you I promise.
Bye.
Apprenhended
are you familiar with Victor Guzman?
he's one of the most elusive hit men in the world.
not anymore.
several days ago, the Agency completed an eight-month operation and captured Guzman in Santiago, Chile.
Wow. That's pretty impressive.
I'll pass that along.
Guzman's capture is secret, and he has begun to talk.
after some persuasion, he admitted that he had recently gotten a new contract.
his assignment was to assassinate this man
alberto Loya, president-elect of peru.
won by a landslide by promising to take back Peru for the people.
the U.S. needs this man in power.
his death would result in political chaos, so we're getting involved.
did Guzman say who ordered the hit?
he didn't know.
he was hired by a broker. Mikhail Ivanov.
so Guzman was hired by Ivanov and Ivanov was hired by whoever wants Loya dead.
so we have no idea who's behind this.
could be Loya's closest advisor.
could be someone within the Peruvian government.
so we can't go in as CIA.
the Agency's Position is we must keep our involvement in this secret until we know more.
you will travel to Peru first thing in the morning, get in to see Loya, find out what you can.
we need to make sure this man stays alive.
Hey, where'd you get that?
wow, is that the new one with the locator beacon?
it's just a regular bracelet.
from my old Professor. Schilling.
he gave it to me before I left for hong kong.
I'd forgotten about it till Jennifer brought him up.
so Sammy really was teacher's pet, huh?
Schilling was different.
he had this passion that was just inspiring.
he made you feel like anyone could change the world if they tried hard enough.
well, he sounds pretty amazing.
he was.
on my first assignment in hong kong, I made so many rookie mistakes.
but when I called and told Schilling, all he said was,"tell me all the things you did right."
and when I did, I felt better.
that's the kind of man he was.
always supportive, always proud of me.
I just wonder if... I don't know.
if he'd still be proud of me.
are you kidding me?
you're an amazing chef and superspy.
who can beat that?
okay. There's a press event in lima tomorrow afternoon.
every reporter gets an exclusive ten minutes with Loya.
he tries to make himself available for anyone who wants to talk, which is kind of amazing.
Hoyt's working on getting credentials and an interview slot for me.
it seems like the best way of getting time with Loya.
so you get in to see him. Then what?
I don't know. All I have to do in convince the next president of Peru to tell a total stranger which one of his enemies would want to assassinate him.
simple.
lima, Peru
I'm about to check in.
everything looks good, Mrs. Agent Bloom.
or... Should I say Edna?
Edna? What? That's the best name you could come up with?
had a babysitter named Edna once.
Oh, Lord. -- She smelled like lilacs dipped in honey.
okay.
Edna Karter from the Kirkway News Agency.
is something wrong?
is... Something wrong?
you don't seem to be on the list.
Hoyt, what the hell's going on?
you cleared the name, right? -- Yeah, yeah.
here you are.
I didn't know it was Karter with a "K."
Karter with a "K"? Really?
that's how my babysitter spelled it.
Wow. Really?
I can see why that's a problem now. -- Yep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
I'm sorry. That sounded like a line.
I swear it wasn't. -- Oh, yeah, it was.
you know what else is a line? "I swear that wasn't a line."
clearly a line. -- I should write this stuff down.
I'm Matthew Hunt. I freelance for the ap.
Edna Karter. -- Pleasure.
first time meeting Loya?
Yes. I usually work in Asia, but I got this assignment to get some dirt on the new president.
but it seems like he's a saint in politician's clothing.
no enemies. No story.
trust me. There's always an enemy.
you just have to be the first person to find him.
I'm up.
good luck.
my early days.
to remind me why I chose politics.
and why was that?
to help people. To make a difference.
I've always felt that anyone can change the world.
I agree... Mr. President.
not Mr. President just yet.
so what can I answer for you, Miss Karter?
okay, Mrs. Agent Bloom, the diversion is on its way.
we haven't seen a response like this to a presidential candidate in years.
what do you attribute that to? --The Peruvian people.
they're ready for a different way of doing things.
Mr. President, we have a security issue at the entrance.
go. Ms. Karter and I will be fine.
you need to leave now, or security will escort you out.
I've been covering this campaign since the beginning.
my name is Robert Storm.
canadian Press Agency. Check again!
I do not need to check again.
is this 'cause I'm from Canada, huh?
I'm not going anywhere. Who's in charge of security here?
I'm Robert Freakin' Storm!
who's in charge of security? -- I am.
okay, who's next in charge of security?
your life is in danger. -- What are you talking about?
I know what this must sound like but I've been working on a story, and a reliable source claims this is a credible threat.
I'm a politician. There are many threats.
that's what my security detail is for.
I'm not sure you can trust them.
I can trust them with my life.
so if you have no other questions and you have no proof,
I think you should leave now.
please, I know I'm asking you to take a risk and trust me, but you'd be taking a bigger risk not trusting me.
you said you wanted to change the world.
you can't do it as a dead man.
and why do you so badly feel the need to save me?
because I know about you.
who you are, what you stand for.
I know you must be a good man and...
you remind me of another good man I used to know.
actually, you remind me of someone as well...
my daughter.
both very stubborn.
of course, she's only five years old.
I'm sorry, but -- But do you have any idea who would want to do something like this to you?
my platform has upset many people.
then would you consider canceling your public appearances - until the threat has been contained? -- Absolutely not.
I am many things, Ms. Karter. A coward is not one of them.
the interview is over.
it was nice to meet you.
and don't worry. Everything will work itself out.
good day.
Loya doesn't know anything.
he's not gonna change his mind. He's a strong man.
passionate about what he believes in.
it's actually inspiring.
you're doing it.
you're getting emotionally invested.
I am not. -- I heard you talking to him.
he's not your professor, Sam.
he only reminds of you Schilling because Schilling is on your brain.
but this is a mission. -- I know that.
so what now? -- I'll stay here in lima, see if I can find someone in Loya's inner circle and get close to him or her.
preferably her. -- I have an idea.
definitely risky. -- I'm good with risky.
ivanov lives on top of a nightclub he owns in Rio.
we should pay him a visit.
that's the assassination broker.
I know who he is, Hoyt. But he's not gonna tell us who hired him.
he probably doesn't even know. --You're right.
but what's the best way to stop an assassination?
to become the assassin.
it may be a long shot, but ivanov doesn't know Guzman's been captured.
so we just have to put the word out on the street that there's a new assassin in town.
rio De Janeiro the apartment's empty.
Ivanov's in his office, and he's not doing the books.
Wow. That is one hot woman.
who knew assassination brokers did so well with the ladies?
okay. That's enough.
so do you think Brazilian women are the hottest women on the planet too?
I read that in Esquire.
you don't really think I'm gonna answer that, do you?
have you ever gone out with a Brazilian woman?
well, it depends how you define "gone out."
Avoiding! -- Not avoiding.
nice! Hold on. Look at that.
he's got a wall safe.
fingerprint biometrics and a code.
I'm so jealous you can do that.
just put a handheld computer in there.
we have to look.
may have some info on the Loya hit.
Hoyt? I think he's headed to you.
Hoyt, are you there? Hoyt!
I am here and on it.
keep an eye out for Ivanov.
he's here.
do not lose him. We're on the move.
you.
stop
I don't know you.
I'm new here.
bring me another bottle.
Yes, sir.
got the prints.
I'm headed to Ivanov's office.
be careful, sweetie.
Mrs. Agent Bloom, we have a problem.
ivanov is on the move. Destination unknown.
Mayday, mayday.
everyone can put their guns away.
it's okay.
you're a vodka man, right? -- And who the hell are you?
I'm here on business. --We have no business together.
not yet. That's what I'm here to discuss.
bartenders can apply downstairs.
that's not what I had in mind.
that gun belonged to Yuri petrovich.
took me off the streets when I was 17.
trained me at his compound in Krakov.
taught me everything I know.
Yuri said you used to do business together.
told me to look you up when I was ready to take my career forward.
I don't hire strangers.
Marcus. Now we're not strangers anymore.
and then there's this.
where did you get this?
off Guzman's dead body.
I knew you were handling the Loya contract.
so I thought, hmm...
let's make sure there's a vacancy.
Guzman was your best guy.
and I'm better than anybody you could even think of.
be at cafe dos, 8:30 tomorrow morning.
sharp.
if I'm interested, someone will approach.
if not, don't ever show your face again...
or I'll kill you.
ivanov has no idea Yuri Petrovich has been in the Agency's pocket for years?
none. And if Ivanov calls, Petrovich has been told to confirm my story.
nice job taking care of that, Hoyt.
that means a lot coming from you, sir.
so if you can maybe say it again to my cell phone for a keepsake, that'd be amazing.
and we are rolling.
whenever you're ready. And go! Action. Go.
you know what? We'll do it later. I'll remember the phrasing.
so do we have anything off the drive that sam hacked from Ivanov's safe?
Yes, indeed. These photos right here.
San Martin Square, Lima, Peru.
site of Loya's inauguration in two days.
that confirms the when and where of the assassination.
so if we can get Ivanov to hire me, we control the how.
and we can control the how.
cafe dos. 8: 30.
you guys see anyone? -- No one yet.
you think Ivanov was playing you?
no.
here he comes.
that's just a waiter. -- I didn't order any tea.
I wonder what type of tea you send an assassin.
I bet it's Darjeeling.
it worked.
ivanov checked my story with Petrovich.
I just need to do one more thing, and the Loya job is mine.
great. What is it? -- A test to prove I'm bona fide.
I have to be back here in eight hours.
Why?
to kill someone.
here you go, Mr. Agent Bloom.
your target is Martine Redondo, 45. Lives on Sao Geraldo on the shoe store on Gon Calves Dias.
a shoe store? -- I mean, mostly shoes.
what else? -- Uh, maybe underwear.
why do you think Ivanov wants Redondo dead?
I doubt it's random.
gotta be a loose end he wants me to tie up.
hold the espadrilles, people.
Redondo used to go by the name Miguel Silva.
formerly an accountant. -- Yep. If I were to guess, he probably did some work for him at some point.
maybe he was embezzling Ivanov's money.
and now Ivanov is settling the score.
you have enough time? --I've done more with less.
and if this gets us closer to saving Loya, I'll do whatever I have to to make that happen.
Yeah.
because it's the job, not because I'm emotionally invested.
sure. -- Hey, we do have a plan, right?
I mean, we're not actually gonna kill this guy, are we?
Hoyt, what's with the police?
increased response to gang robberies, sir.
there was a huge article in newsweek.
I can send you the link if you want.
no, I'm good. Where's Redondo?
closing up shop as we speak. I gotta go.
he's headed west on Gon Calves Dias towards cafe dos.
coming to you, Mrs. Agent Bloom.
he's the one in the Italian loafers.
now.
Oh! I'm sorry!
let me just It's okay. -- Excuse me. Excuse me -- Thank you. -- I speak English.
I am so lost.
I feel like I've been walking in a circle for two hours.
I'm looking for the Central Terminal?
I can show you.
Oh, you don't have to. -- It's okay.
I'm headed there now. Come. I'll show you.
this way. -- Thanks.
well...
central Terminal. Right over there.
thank you so much.
I'd still be wandering around if it wasn't for you.
no problem.
can I at least... Buy you a drink?
to say thank you?
well...
who doesn't have time for a quick drink with a beautiful lady?
Yes.
they're in.
Hoyt, where the hell is Redondo?
we only got three minutes, and Ivanov clearly is a stickler for punctuality.
he just came out of the restroom and he's on his way now.
got him.
nothing. He's dead.
excuse me, Mister.
I think this is yours.
thank you.
was that enough for you?
I'm done proving myself. You can hire me or don't.
even though Yuri vouched for you,
I had to be sure.
be in San Marcus Square in Lima on sunday for the Loya job.
we're clear.
Wow! That mask was hot.
Leo, you cut it kinda close there.
I had to pee.
Wow. Where are you going?
the presidential palace. There's a party.
I have to talk to Loya again. Tonight.
we have less than 24 hours before the inauguration.
Shaw notified Peruvian Intelligence there was a plot against Loya...
without directly mentioning us being here, of course.
he says it would be political trespassing if they know.
at least we control the trigger.
today. I'm worried what'll happen after you don't pull the trigger.
we have to find out who's behind this.
he just wants to help people.
he's a good man. -- Yep. He is a good man.
that still doesn't make him your professor.
so you need to stop projecting before it affects how you do your job.
weak minibar.
remind me to talk to shaw about that.
anyhow, in all the mask-wearing craziness, I forgot to mention
I hooked up with a mega-babe when I was here, man.
said babe happened to be a member of Loya's administrative staff who just sent me a rather interesting email.
don't share your email with us.
Oh, come on, Stevie. Relax. I'm a classy guy.
I will obviously skip the graphic parts and go right to the speech
Boom-that I asked for.
Loya's inauguration speech? -- That's the one.
the same speech in which he reveals for the first time he's giving all oil pipeline usage rights to a Peruvian Company, I.G. H. And he's kicking out the current controlling company, Despina Oil
his first step to take back Peru for the people.
that pipeline is huge.
Despina oil's stock value will plummet.
this could be a disaster for them.
Yeah, I think we just found some enemies of the state to check out.
we find a Despina connection, maybe we find out who ordered the hit.
you guys work on Despina.
Edna Karter's going to the preinauguration party.
how's the story coming?
what story?
I barely have a hundred words.
and only ten of those are worth anything.
I know the feeling.
maybe there'll be something in the speech to write about.
who knows? He's promising a lot of changes.
incoming Call Lizzy
it's my sister.
excuse me.
Hello?
Loya is secure in the chapel.
Sam, your friend Jennifer is driving me crazy.
she's a nightmare. She can't decide what she wants, how many people are coming, whether the cake should say Jen or Jennifer.
just stay calm, Lizzy.
I'm trying, but I'm sorry.
I do not understand how you two were such good friends.
we weren't. We just had a professor in common, that's all.
can I just fire her? Please?
I gotta go. Good luck.
papi!
I'm sorry, Mr Loya, she wanted to come.
refused to sleep unless she saw you.
you should be in bed.
I know...I wanted to give you this before tomorrow.
for good luck, Papa.
what do you think you're doing?
you're not allowed in here...let's go!
it's okay.
miss Karter.
you know you should not be here.
you still working on that story?
Yes. And I think I know more about the threat against your life.
please... Just hear me out, sir.
the N.I.S. Has contacted me.
they're aware of the threats as well. So please, if you don't mind.
it has to do with your plans for the pipeline.
someone at Despina or someone related to Despina has to be behind this.
Despina? -- Yes.
I'm not actually a reporter.
I'm
what are you doing here?
I'm fine, Cortez.
ms Karter was just wishing me luck for tomorrow.
show her out.
make sure she gets out of here okay.
safely!
your stunt just cost you your press credentials.
if any of my men see you in the square tomorrow, you will be arrested or worse-got it?
I got it.
we got it. Who's that?
that's the guy that was hitting on you, right, Hunt?
Yes. But he wasn't hitting on me.
just see what you can find out about Despina.
I'm still working on it. Someone's hidin' something.
this is the only body.
problem with the clean up, sir.
I'm at the morgue.
Redondo's body isn't here.
the assassin isn't who he says he is.
I know I messed up with Guzman.
now this guy.
I came to Lima to help you.
I know people here.
I can even do the job myself if I
ma'am, take a look at this. I finally hacked into Despina's database.
I'm still working through all the executives, but I did find this.
a group photo. Is it from some sort of retreat?
exactly. The Despina group ten years ago at some resort, right?
but check this out.
Cortez. -- Correctamundo.
used to be Despina's head of security. Ran detail for the pipeline.
whoa, whoa, no, no, wait!
you stay here and we'll notify Agent Bloom and nash.
I have to warn Loya. -- Ma'am, you can't go out there.
Cortez will be looking for you. --Tell Steven what you found out.
I'm not letting a good man get killed again.
all right. I'm in place for the final call from Ivanov.
Hoyt's all set to trace it.
you ready out there, Leo?
I'm assuming that's rhetorical.
I need you to scan for sharpshooters.
Loya's people don't know I'm up here playing make-believe.
if they spot me, they'll arrest me.
or worse.
I guess you'd better stay hidden then, huh?
thanks for the advice. -- That's why I am here.
Hoyt. Call coming in.
you ready? -- Yes. Yeah.
and it looks like Cortez is our guy.
he was the head of security at Despina.
in place and have the package.
perfect.
now, listen to me and listen carefully.
who's this? I'm only dealing with Ivanov.
ivanov had a prior engagement.
you're working directly for me now.
do you have a problem with that?
not as long as I still get paid.
deal's a deal. I'll be in touch with final instructions.
I got a partial hit.
the caller is definitely in the square.
it's gotta be Cortez. -- It's not Cortez.
you sure? -- That was the client, and I saw Cortez while I was on the phone.
it wasn't him making the call.
unless he's a great ventriloquist, I am sure.
keep looking. -- Oh, and, um...
Mrs. Agent Bloom is out there trying to warn Loya.
what? Hoyt, I told you to keep her in the van!
listen, I tried, but she's a force of nature.
you can't control her.
she's also not thinking straight right now.
she said she didn't want to let a good man get killed again, whatever that means.
Leo. Go and look for Samantha before she gets herself killed.
I'm on it.
you don't understand, you have to -- I am sorry, Ms. Karter!
no press credentials, no entrance.
do I need to call chief Cortez? -- Cortez is the problem!
Oh, you need to leave right now.
Seguridad.
Hey.
Leo... Anything?
not finding her, Stevie.
keep looking. I know her.
she's not gonna stop until she gets to Loya.
sounds like you got a good lead on a story. Care to share?
Loya's in danger. There's gonna be an assassination attempt.
Wait-what? -- I need to get to him now.
whoa, whoa, just slow down. Okay? Slow down.
I need to warn him right now.
okay. I think I can get you near Loya and away from Cortez.
follow me.
happy holidays from the Despina family
what the hell?
Leo... Anything? -- Not yet.
I'll find her, Stevie. I promise.
you're never gonna believe this, but the reporter that was hitting on Mrs. Agent Bloom is part of the family that owns Despina oil.
it's him. I don't believe in coincidence.
gracias!
buenos dias, Peru!
Hoyt. Trace it. - On it, sir.
today.
I come here humbled before you
ready for final instructions.
just like you were ready to shoot that shoemaker in Rio?
that was very clever.
let's see what a good shot you are for real this time.
when Loya says,"I want to take Peru back,"
that's when you kill him.
and if I don't? -- Well, that's simple.
if Loya doesn't die, someone else does.
I believe you know her as Edna Karter.
today is the day we stop relying on foreign corporations, like Despina Oil.
your partner...
he'd better take that shot.
I don't know what you're talking about.
well, let's see, if he doesn't do it,
I guess I'm gonna have to kill two people today.
could you get any more on his location this time?
I'm on it now, sir.
there is a lot of interference.
humor me. Tell me the truth.
well, I,uh...I actually am a reporter.
and you work for Despina?
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that my family owns it.
anyway, this wasn't how we wanted to play this, you know.
Loya's the one that gave us the ultimatum
share the pipeline profits more equitably with the country or he'd revoke our usage rights.
and you chose to have him killed. -- Yes. We need him killed.
we'll get our man in as president, and all will be right again.
I mean, this is hundreds of millions of dollars you're talking about.
you'll get caught. --Really?
by who? Hmm?
you'll be dead.
and I'll be the hero who found the fake reporter who killed the president.
and after that stunt you pulled last night to sneak in to see Loya, I'm sure cortez will back me up on that one.
so you and Cortez are in this together.
Cortez? No.
he left the company years ago to work for Loya.
his mistake.
I believe in my country...
I believe in the people of Peru.
come on, come on.
hunt is calling from a building on the southwest corner of the square.
Leo. I've got a visual on Hunt.
he's got Sam in the tower in the southwest corner of the square. -- Got it.
today we begin investing in ourselves.
come on, come on.
we will control our own oil pipeline.
let's reclaim Peru!
you were right. There always is an enemy.
good luck with everything.
I don't know what you did today, but something tells me I'm alive because of you.
thank you.
you're welcome.
Despina had a deal with the Old Regime.
when they tried to buy Loya off with the same deal, - he wouldn't bite. -- What about Hunt?
he's been arrested for attempted murder and three of his family members for conspiracy.
Despina's rights were revoked, but more importantly the Peruvian economy is stable with Loya firmly in office.
or, more importantly, we saved a good man's life.
whatever floats your boat.
time for my thal massage.
would you pass the news on to Agent Nash, since, for some reason, he felt this meeting was optional?
will do.
and then Jennifer made a toast to herself about herself for the next 20 minutes.
she sounds fantastic.
but it sounds like you pulled it off.
I did, actually.
what is it that you do for the hotel exactly?
Oh, public relations.
I am a people person, you know.
Oh, right. -- Mind if I...?
no. Hey!
mom's home.
missed you at the meeting, Leo.
my bad. I thought we were meeting here.
so... Lizzy, how'd it go with Jennifer?
Oh, your little sis rocked it. --Yeah, I kinda did, actually.
see? Jennifer's not that bad.
Oh, no, she was horrible. But I totally overcharged her.
Oh, nice. Gimme some.
I'll talk to Leo, okay? I promise.
and I'll talk to Lizzy. Again.
how 'bout we take a break from Lizzy and Leo?
gladly.
you will talk to him, right? --Yes.
so what was going on in Peru?
you told Hoyt you didn't want to let a good man die again.
were you talking about Schilling?
we don't talk about the past, Steven.
I... Am not going anywhere.
okay. But this is big.
I've been wanting to tell you for a while.
it's about why I left the Agency.
was it about Schilling?
he wasn't just my professor at Yale.
he was the one that recruited me to the Agency and then left school to mentor me in the field.
he died five years ago.
it was my fault. -- What are you talking about?
the last mission that I had was with him, a routine meet in Telaviv.
simple. But something went wrong, and I ended up in the wrong place, or he did.
it's still not clear.
but by the time I got there...
a car bomb had exploded, and he was dead.
I'm sorry, babe.
Schilling's death really shook me.
you couldn't have stopped it.
that's why I guess I was trying so hard with Loya.
I - it felt like a second chance to save Schilling.
crazy, I know.
so what was he like?
he was brilliant.
and funny.
a little skeptical of you, though.
what? -- Said I could do better.
well, I guess he wasn't right about everything then, was he?
no, he wasn't.
thanks for being here.
anytime...
superspy.
it's the one.
what is all this?
it's a little something I put away for a rainy day, in case I couldn't get back home.
nobody even knows it exists.
so next week in Jakarta. - Yeah.
but you make certain you're not followed.
these people - They won't stop till they have a hold of this.
do you need me to do anything?
no.
everything's been taken care of. Come on.
are you ever gonna tell me what's in that folder, professor Shilling?
Sam, I'll see you in Jakarta.
I don't care whose authorization you need. Make it happen.
easy on the vendors - Got to work with them.
what was it this time - Chicken, beef?
tomatoes.
tomatoes.
I want three crates, and he's acting as if they don't grow on trees.
okay, don't take this the wrong way, but you seem a little more stressed than usual, and we are just talking about tomatoes, right?
how are we gonna run this place now that Lizzy's gone?
who are we gonna leave in charge?
all right, sweetie, I know it's not easy, okay?
I know you miss her.
it's not about that.
it's about how important she was to the business.
in that case, why don't we just start interviewing new kitchen managers?
let's not get carried away.
Lizzy still needs her job when she comes back.
what if she doesn't come back?
Steven, have you heard that band?
she's coming back.
the job stays open, end of discussion.
I know you think saying, "end of discussion"means we should stop talking, but it doesn't-Okay, then, fine. End of discussion.
what are these?
bookmarks?
these are plane tickets to Athens.
doesn't mean they can't be bookmarks.
okay, Samantha Bloom, what kind of craziness are you up to?
I'm apologizing.
you were right.
maybe I have been having a hard time with Lizzy being gone.
and maybe it is stressing me out, so I figured. Let's take a vacation.
and Shaw agreed to pay for it.
are you kidding me?
us, in Athens?
on the CIA's dime?
apology accepted.
move!
move, move, move, move, move!
go, go, go, go, go!
move! Get out!
move it!
get out of here!
get out!
let's stay in bed today, get room service
waffles with strawberries on top.
Mmm, my favorite.
so I'm in charge today after your creepy flea market yesterday.
that's fine with me.
four more days with no more catering company.
no CIA missions.
no shaw-I mean he who must not be named.
it's all right, babe. I'm so relaxed, his name doesn't even bother me.
is that you or me?
that was both of us.
Hello? - Hello?
you two are still in Athens, I presume.
Yeah, why?
good, you're close.
close to what?
Tel Aviv.
did you call to give us geography lessons?
we need you in Israel immediately.
terrorists have taken over a hotel in Tel Aviv.
we still don't know who they are or what they want, but there are a lot of guests in that hotel, including Americans.
there's a plane waiting for you.
you'll get more information when you land.
I hope you had a nice vacation.
reports say there are five hostage takers.
they immediately cut all communications
hotel phones, guests' cell phones, security cameras.
and, there are roughly 50 hostages, 14 of which are American citizens, and we believe they're being heldin the ground-floor ballroom.
did Shaw explain why exactly the cia is sending us in there?
come on, you know why.
if anybody can end this stand off, it is Steven Bloom, with a little help from Mrs. Agent Bloom.
you really expect us to believe that?
Yeah. That is the truth.
it's also true that you guys were right next door in Athens.
can I remind you that the clock is ticking on this one?
what clock?
the Shin Bet-Local law enforcement.
if Shin Bet goes in, they go in hot.
like Brazilian-supermodel hot.
even if we coordinate operations, Shin Bet isn't taking orders from us.
which is why-and you're gonna love this part, 'cause I think it's the best part
I plan on infiltrating their ranks, coordinate intel while you guys sneak into the hotel.
you really think you can pass for Israeli s. w.a. t?
Yes. Yeah. Yes.
I went through basic like every other agent.
and if that's not enough, in middle school,
I broke the pull-up record.
Really?
I didn't even come close.
but I did meet the minimum requirement for the presidential fitness award for the presidential fitness award, which is a huge deal.
all right, how do you want to go in?
one of us goes in through the front door, recons the terrorists directly.
while the other one smuggles in weapons so we can rendezv ous for a surgical strike.
everyone calm down.
I'm in charge until the Blooms come back from their vacation.
no need to freak.
you're in very good hands.
you're the reason everyone is freaking out.
Anna, it seems like you have a problem with authority.
stand down, slim.
Oh, no.
all of you need to leave, now.
you can't just waltz in here and fire everyone.
can you?
while I would like to send you all home with a one-week severance package, actually I'm going to send you home with a week's paid vacation-Orders from the Blooms.
wait, wait. What's the deal?
a scheduled visit by the health inspector.
and if he sees you sweating into the lobster bisque,
I don't imagine he will be handing out "a"s.
so leave.
all of you.
now!
done.
I'll stand by for further contact.
no contact yet.
keep all lines open.
what are you doing?
it's ok. I'm a cop.
gunfire
stay down!
you need to learn how to frisk hostages.
anybody else want to be a hero?
hello
yes...
she
you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
sweetie, look, come here.
you were trained in triage.
you can do it, all right?
I would put my life in your hands any day.
see you inside.
who are you?
I'm the doctor.
good. We've got an unknown number of gunshot victim son the first floor - Conditions unknown.
ours or theirs?
let me guess-unknown.
we are totally blind here.
we only know what the hostage takers are telling us, and they are not telling us much right now, except that they need a doctor.
have they made any demands?
what do you care about their politics?
sorry. Old habit.
I did my medical training in the defense forces.
Ah, good, because you'll need that training.
as soon as you cross that line, you're on your own.
let her through in
I'm inside.
forget about him.
he's dead.
I want you to save that man.
special agent Borow-Very excited to be part of the team, sir.
who the hell are you?
zev told me you guys were short, pulled me right out of security detail.
I've never heard of you, never heard of zev either.
no, no, no, you know this guy-buff, curly hair, smells like hummus.
when you see him, you know that's zev.
okay, maybe I'll call over to H. Q. see if there's some sort of mix-up.
Hey, I'm sorry.
is this some sort of joke?
because - Special agent Borow, we are in the middle of a hostage scenario in which lives have been lost and many other lives are in danger.
so when some snot-nosed special agent comes into my command and tells me he's a part of my team, expects my men to entrust him with their lives just because some guy named Zev vouches for him, that is a joke. Good-bye.
Yeah, of course. No, no, no.
it's nice to meet you, and I appreciate it.
what happened to going undercover with Shin Bet?
they weren't impressed with your push-up record?
it was pull-ups, actually- Totally different muscle group.
and my plan worked like a charm.
we are officially hot on local law's communications.
listen.
what are they talking about?
they're trying to find a way to breach the hotel without the terrorists noticing.
they're talking about zip-lining onto the roof.
they're just gonna zip-line across Tel Avivin broad daylight?
Yeah. - Are they insane?
where are the hotel schematics?
right over there.
I want to see what's underneath.
down further.
below the basement, keep going. - Okay, okay
listen, if we get any further down, we'll be in Jaffa, which is, coincidentally, the world's oldest port.
is this a? - It's a tunnel. Unbelievable.
they must have built it to run a data line.
it looks like the top of the tunnel is only a few feet from the bottom of the hotel's subbasement.
if I can somehow get through, I'm good to go.
wait, you're not thinking about drilling, are you?
I take it back.
zip-lining would've been a cakewalk compared to this.
sir, if it weren't for my dust allergy and my crippling claustrophobia,
I would be right by your side.
better you to stay up there and monitor anyway.
Sam. I'm in, Sam.
as soon as I get to the ground floor, we'll figure out a rendezvous.
how's it going on your end? - Good.
I patched up his brachial artery.
he's lost a lot of blood, but he should be okay.
when you finish sewing him up, go with the other hostages.
Steven, someone's headed your way.
what?
Sam, are you there? Sam?
damn it.
please, don't hurt me. Please.
okay, look, I'm one of the good guys, okay?
what are you doing here?
I was in my room, and I heard gunshots.
there were men with masks.
I- I-I hid until they were gone, and then I found the service elevator.
what's going on?
just calm down, all right?
we're not alone. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
who the hell are you?
I'm also one of the good guys.
quick, we have to hide the body before they send someone looking for him.
okay, how about before we hide any bodies, you tell me who you are.
Anderson. I'm CIA.
same as you, I'm guessing.
I hope you're not waiting for the secret handshake, mister...?
bloom. - Great. Nice to meet you.
we can catch up on agency Trivia later.
give me a hand.
so Kelvin sent you or Shaw?
Shaw. Who's Kelvin?
doesn't matter.
at least someone in the agency figured out my cover was blown.
you don't have any idea what's going on here, do you, agent bloom?
I thought I did. Sam? Sam?
you have a partner in the hotel?
upstairs with the hostages.
we were ordered to infiltrate the hotel and take care of the hostage situation.
you think that's your mission?
forget about the hostages.
why would the CIA send you here to protect civilians?
you're here for me.
just like these guys are.
