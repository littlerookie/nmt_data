why don't we take a deep breath and then both say what we think we should do.
you should shoot me... - I should shoot you...
on the roof of 30 rock!
I only ask one thing, sir.
make it quick.
I cannot promise you that, ken. i'm a horrible shot.
to the roof.
Hey, dummy.
Hey. You ready to sign that lease?
you know how we were talking earlier about me moving in with you and how hard it is to kick a tenant out in new york?
just think about it.
I'll make you chili every night.
I'll provide for you. I have a new business idea.
it's like netflix, but you go to a store, and you pick out your video from a limited selection.
it'd be like five years ago. - Exactly.
I can move my stuff in tonight, right?
I just have one duffel bag in a sidecar.
my motorcycle got impounded from being parked too awesome.
I just need you to sign this lease I printed up off the internet.
okay, I need a pen.
you don't have a pen? You're a writer, liz.
all I have is this kick-ass laser pointer that I point at nerds' crotches in the park.
Oh, wait.
all we have is this kick-ass laser pointer.
come on, baby. Let's go find a pen.
okay.
Oh, no.
let me introduce myself.
I am - Future jack, obviously.
is that what we're wearing in ten years?
more like 35 years.
you're 87 years old?
my god, I'm outstanding.
I like to think so.
I've come all the way from the future
which is a lot harder than coming from the past - Whatever, pops.
to warn you not to listen to the other jacks.
in the future, you're happier than you ever imagined.
you have grandchildren and a gorgeous polyblasian wife.
that's a new race that emerges in 2030.
they're incredible. - What happened to avery?
Oh, you'll see. It's hilarious.
Yeah, but what about his, your, our career?
don't we wanna be this dude?
younger me's, business is only a part of life.
real happiness- - Ah, shut up.
don't listen to his crap, jack.
if you choose my path, you'll be plenty happy.
you'll spearhead ge's development of the electric vagina.
you won't be married, but you'll have a house with a lot of glass, and it's cold. And you'll own the buffalo bills.
you didn't say it was the bills.
look, right now, liz lemon is downstairs about to sign a lease with dennis duffy.
if she does that, you'll lose her.
in three years, they'll be married and living in jacksonville, florida, where he operates an unlicensed alligator park.
Jacksonville?
her hair can't handle that humidity.
no, I don't care.
I'm tired of saving her.
to quote liz lemon,"opposite!
you'd be saving yourself.
the only way to get my life is to be distracted from your blind ambition, and you can't do that without liz lemon in your life.
Jack, this guy is just trying to justify his own bad choices.
go down there and fire liz.
okay.
we're obviously all thinking it, so I'm just gonna say it.
we're gonna have sex with each other, right?
Yeah, we are. Oh, my!
lemon, don't sign that lease!
why are you here?
just sign it, dummy.
it's a receipt for some lez pants you bought or whatever.
no.
if you have a problem, I will fight you, dennis.
that wouldn't be very fair.
I'm only trained to fight four or more men at a time.
there are three more of me upstairs, and I'd be happy to go get them.
I can't. I hurt my wrist.
Hey, people.
somebody sabotaged the gas line.
people could've died or had fights.
what? Who would do that?
Hey, grab that black guy.
it was you.
what are you, mad at me, liz? huh?
I did it for love. - You're insane.
Hey, hey, hey, guys. Hands off the jacket, all right?
it's from amar'e stoudemire's eveningwear collection.
if I ever see you again, i'll kill you.
please. You'll be back.
all right, the gas is clearing out.
it should be okay in time for the show.
according to my device here.
good work, jennifer.
Oh, my god, the show. I gotta load in an audience.
I gotta distribute scripts. I gotta change jenna's blood.
I need kenneth. - Forget about kenneth.
I told hank cooper that tracy jordan would be here.
where is the star of your show?
right here.
I know you're talking about tracy, but I don't care.
Tracy and kenneth went to the roof with a gun. why?
nothing to see here, mr. Man. - No, sir.
Hello, kabletown family members.
and my favorite actress, jenna.
when tgs gets cancelled, I mean if, when tgs gets cancelled, we need to talk about your future.
I know what my future holds, hank.
motherhood.
it's a surprise to me, but I have so much love to give.
well, why couldn't you be a mother and do a daytime talk show?
well, because the talk show will be my baby.
I'm not gonna be held back by some uterus turd.
let's call my agent.
Oh, my god. Your stomach.
for some reason, i'm starting to rethink this, sir.
we all have doubt, k - tel records. But we made a decision.
and we'll look stupid if we don't follow through.
okay.
just please tell my mother- - My bad.
that was an accident.
Tracy, stop!
don't startle me when I'm holding a gun.
use your head, liz lemon.
for god's sakes, tracy, give me that gun! ugh!
do you have any idea how much paperwork I would have to do if you shot kenneth?
I didn't know that, jack. I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get people to stop respecting me.
Tracy, you want to destroy the goodwill you have so you can go back to your easy tv job?
Yes, even more than I want to shoot kenneth.
then all you have to do is go back to your easy tv job.
what? - Do tv.
and no one will ever take you seriously again.
doesn't matter how big a movie star you are, even if you have the kind of career where you walked away from a blockbuster franchise or worked with meryl streep or anthony hopkins, made important movies about things like civil rights or pearl harbor, stole films with supporting roles and then turned around and blew them away on broadway.
none of that will matter once you do television.
you could win every award in sight and be the biggest thing on the small screen, and you'll still get laughed out of the vanity fair oscar party by greg kinnear.
Tracy, your career hit rock bottom the first time you decided to do tgs.
you want it to hit rock bottom again?
go on network television.
let's make some tv! - Yeah.
we have five minutes!
uh-uh, uh-uh. I'm sorry, folks.
while we were working on the gas line, we somehow broke the elevator.
she's an old building. You're gonna have to take the stairs.
I'm okay!
least I made it through my last day.
darn it.
excuse me. The elevators are out.
do you know how- - Shut up, garkle.
well, if it isn't jack and kenneth and tracy and liz.
Hey, I have a bone to pick with the four of you.
screw, williams!
Hey, get out of my home! - Sorry, recurring hobos.
I'm back, everybody.
you're welcome... For the adventure...
my absence...
whew... Provided. - 30 seconds.
Liz, I was checking the cue cards, and we have a problem.
it all seemed so funny when they were writing it.
during dennis' gas leak.
Yes, this'll work. Just flip the top of act two.
Danny can't make the wardrobe change that quick.
best show ever! - Yeah!
guys, I don't know about this.
Oh, my god. We don't have a show.
ten seconds. - Just start.
I should call dennis.
let's meet our contestants.
Dr. Steven poop is a homemaker and a centaur.
you did it.
you're picked up for a million more episodes.
where am i?
am I back in vietnam?
what charity are you playing for?
the grimace foundation, jeremy.
keeping milkshakes purple for over a million years. - Hold on.
Tracy's back on tv again?
Clooney, hanks. Actor emergency.
Tracy jordan's doing tv again.
I know, disappointing. Take him off the official a-list.
well, I don't have the password.
Pitt's our webmaster.
well, then, wake him up.
Oh, they're doing pam again? ugh.
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life go ahead with your own life leave me alone this may be the gas talking, but I was wrong about dennis.
you're the guy who never left.
and this is definitely the gas talking, but I'd be a lot worse off if I'd never met you, lemon, and I'm proud to have you as a mentee.
I mean, look at you.
endangering the lives of hundreds of people for a show that tv guide once called "still on.
I framed that article.
to 100 more episodes.
wow, five years. It makes you think about all the fun we've had together.
but you know the single most amazing thing that's happened over the last five years?
that is true, sir.
but today does make me wonder where we'll all be five years from now.
Caesar's CAMP IN GREECE
we COULD HOLD OUT UNTIL THE RAINS COME.
if WE GO EASTWARD, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CUT OFF HERE.
Oh, OF COURSE.
it WILL NOT DO.
ready.
maps NEVER REDRAW THEMSELVES,
if THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR.
- HE'S RIGHT.
we SHALL JUST HAVE TO FIGHT THE WRETCHES HERE WHERE WE STAND.
and BEAT THEM.
Oh, WE SHALL CRUSH THEM, DOUBTLESS.
dinner FOR WORMS, THE WHOLE DAMN LOT OF THEM.
dinner FOR WORMS.
try TO AVOID BLOODSHED THIS TIME.
wait A WHILE AND POMPEY CAN SHAVE YOU INSTEAD.
Scipio: TORQUATUS SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING, NO?
a PRAETORSHIP PERHAPS.
Cicero: IF TORQUATUS IS GIVEN HIGH OFFICE,
then VARRO MUST BE GIVEN SAME, ELSE WE'LL SEE NO END OF TROUBLE.
Cato: BUT THEN WHAT DO WE GIVE LABIENUS?
Macedonia? - Scipio: BYTHNIA. MACEDONIA TO LIBO.
plums FOR YOUR PEOPLE AND PORRIDGE FOR THE REST, EH?
macedonia AND BYTHNIA ARE NOT YET OURS TO BESTOW.
you ARE COOKING RABBITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT.
our PARTICULAR RABBIT IS CORNERED, STARVING,
and HAS LOST NEAR 2, 000 MEN.
Cato: I THINK WE MAY SAFELY SAY
that HERE IS A RABBIT READY FOR THE POT.
why SO MELANCHOLY, BRUTUS? - OH, DO I SEEM SO?
Pompey: MMM. - FORGIVE ME.
no, CAESAR'S DEFEAT IS A GLORY
we CANNOT ENDURE TYRANTS - BUT I CANNOT CELEBRATE IT.
he WAS AS MY FATHER TO ME.
I FEEL FOR YOU. WHEN DO WE STRIKE?
strike? WE HAVE ALREADY STRUCK.
we HAVE HIM DOWN, BUT HE IS NOT DEAD YET, EH?
when DO WE STRIKE THE FINAL BLOW? - THERE WILL NOT BE ONE.
if WE SIMPLY KEEP HIM BOTTLED UP A MONTH OR SO MORE,
the REMAINS OF HIS ARMY WILL DISINTEGRATE AND DISAPPEAR, - NO CAUSE TO US. - IS THAT HONORABLE?
Mmm? - Cato: CAESAR HAS DRIVEN US FROM ROME,
chased US OUT OF ITALY, KILLED OUR FRIENDS,
reset OUR REPUBLIC.
surely, DIGNITY AND HONOR DEMANDS WE WALK IN HIS BLOOD.
certainly, KNEE DEEP. - BUT YOU WOULD HAVE HUNGER DO OUR WORK FOR US!
we MUST ATTACK CAESAR AND KILL HIM UNDER THE EYES OF MARS, - ELSE OUR VICTORY IS EMPTY. - Cicero: HE HAS SENSE. THEY WILL LOOK BACK AND RETURN ONLY IF WE WIN BY FORCE
you ARE POMPEY MAGNUS.
you CONQUER AND CRUSH YOUR ENEMIES AS IF THEY WERE INSECTS.
people WILL BE DISAPPOINTED BY ANYTHING LESS.
news FROM GREECE.
mark ANTONY IS SAFE, BUT MOST OF THE SHIPS IN HIS FLEET
sent IN AID OF GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR HAVE BEEN LOST AT SEA.
Caesar IS NOW SURROUNDED AND SEVERELY OUTNUMBERED.
the FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC AND SENATE
and OF POMPEY MAGNUS CONFIDENTLY EXPECT
a DECISIVE VICTORY TO FOLLOW SHORTLY.
there YOU ARE. - HERE I AM.
I ASK TIMON FOR PROTECTION,
and HE SENDS ME A BUNCH OF HALFWITS AND CLOWNS!
dear ME. - CAESAR WILL SOON BE DEAD BY EVERY ACCOUNT,
and WE SHALL BE UNDEFENDED.
we MAY AS WELL BE LYING NAKED IN THE STREET!
you MUST GO TO SERVILIA AND ASK FOR A FEW OF HER MEN - TO STAND OUTSIDE FOR US. - WHY?
so THAT THEY CAN GUARD OUR DOORS IN HER NAME, SILLY.
I MEAN WHY MUST I GO?
well, AS IF I WOULD GO BEGGING SERVILIA.
I THINK - I'LL NOT BEGGING FOR YOU.
Oh, DON'T BE SO CHILDISH. IT'S NOT AS IF SHE'LL REFUSE.
you THINK? - WHY WOULD SHE?
those LOVELY GIFTS I GAVE HER?
what DID SHE SAY? - NOTHING.
nothing. - SHE SAID SOMETHING.
she SAID NOTHING.
you're VERY ARROGANT, THAT'S ALL.
think YOU CAN BUY HER FRIENDSHIP WITH STUD SLAVES AND TORTOISES?
and SIX BARRELS OF ICE.
I WOULD RATHER NOT GO.
you WOULD RATHER NOT GO.
you WOULD RATHER BE GANG-RAPED BY SLAVERING PROLES - WHILE YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE BURNS DOWN AROUND YOU. - FRANKLY, I'M PAST CARING.
day CAESAR IS WINNING AND YOU CROW HAPPILY,
day HE IS LOSING, AND I MUST GO A-BEGGING?
I JUST WANT THIS VILE WAR TO BE OVER, - ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. - OCTAVIA, IT IS OVER.
that IS WHY YOU MUST GO TO SERVILIA'S HOUSE.
it's A BORE, I KNOW, BUT THERE WE ARE.
Lyde.
very NICE.
don't.
I'm GLAD TO SEE YOU.
I've BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

I'm SORRY.

we CAN DRINK THEIR BLOOD.
too SALTY.

putrid BY NOW ANYWAY.
doesn't MATTER.
everything WILL BE FINE.
this IS WHERE WE DIE.
what ARE YOU WRITING?
a MESSAGE TO NIOBE.

good IDEA.
send MY BEST TO EIRENE, WILL YOU, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT
if THERE'S SPACE.
graces, DON'T WE LOOK LOVELY.
if I AM TO BE A BEGGAR, I WILL NOT LOOK LIKE ONE.
Oh, I AM NOT OBJECTING, MY HONEY,
though YOU WILL REMIND SERVILIA OF WHAT AN OLD TROUT SHE HAS BECOME.
I'm JUST HAPPY TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO PRETTY FOR ONCE.
you DO SO OFTEN INSIST ON PLAYING THE FRUMP.
I HOPE YOUR MOTHER THRIVES. - SHE DOES.
and YOUR SON? - ALSO.
my MOTHER SENDS ME TO ASK A FAVOR. - MM-HMM?
she FEARS THE CONSEQUENCES
of THIS LAST BATTLE IN GREECE.
understandably.
she HAS ENJOYED HER ASCENDANCY A LITTLE TOO WELL.
she ASKS YOU TO LEND HER SOME MEN
to PROTECT OUR DOOR IN YOUR NAME.
of COURSE.
ELENI, SEND AJAX AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS, - WHOEVER HE THINKS BEST. - THANK YOU.
it's VERY KIND OF YOU.
I TOLD MY MOTHER SHE SHOULD NOT PRESUME-- - PLEASE.
she SHALL HAVE WHAT SHE NEEDS.
forgive ME. YOU ARE SO GOOD TO US.
we DO NOT DESERVE IT. - DON'T.
I MU-- I MUST LOOK A FRIGHT.
no, NOT REALLY.

OCTAVIA...
thank YOU.

I HAVEN'T, SIR. NO EXCUSE, SIR.
Gracchus, SOUND ASSEMBLY!
have XENO SADDLE MY HORSE. - SIR!
- WE WILL ACCEPT BATTLE?
certainly. WHY NOT?
we ARE OUTNUMBERED.
three TO ONE ON FOOT AND FIVE TO ONE A HORSE.
what UNINJURED MEN WE HAVE
are SCARED AND HUNGRY AND DESPERATE.
that IS THE ADVANTAGE WE MUST PRESS HOME.
I WAS NOT AWARE IRONY HAD MILITARY USAGE.
we MUST WIN OR DIE.
Pompey's MEN HAVE OTHER OPTIONS.
goodbye, POSCA.
Caesar! CAESAR! CAESAR!
send TO ROME.
tell THEM CAESAR HAS WON.
sir! CAESAR'S MEN ARE COMING!
I've CUT MY HAND.
we HAVE TO GO, SIR! THEY'LL CATCH YOU.
it's NOT DEEP, BUT IT HURTS.
they WILL KILL YOU!
it's OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
our FORCES ARE ROUTED. WHAT ARE WE TO DO?
we SHALL FIGHT AGAIN ANOTHER DAY I DO NOT DOUBT...
and PREVAIL! - ...AND PREVAIL.
but FOR THE PRESENT WE MUST LOOK TO OUR SAFETY.
our SAFETY IS NOTHING.
we MUST LEAVE GREECE AND LOOK TO FRESH LEVIES.
d MAY ONE ASK WHERE? - AFRICA.
we MUST RALLY THE CITIES OF AFRICA.
africa. DEAR GODS,
and COIN!
we HAVE TAXED EVERY LAST COIN FROM GREECE
and SPENT IT ALL.
what SHALL WE USE TO BUY AFRICA'S LOYALTY?
seashells? - WE NEED BUY NOTHING!
we ARE SENATE OF ROME!
we ARE OLD MEN WITH MUD ON OUR SHOES!
we ARE NOT BEATEN UNTIL WE ARE DEAD.
the REPUBLIC LIVES AS LONG AS WE DO!
you MAY FIGHT ON AS YOU WISH.
as FOR ME,
I WILL GO HERE AND SURRENDER MYSELF TO CAESAR.
have YOU NO DIGNITY? NO HONOR?
some LITTLE I HOPE.
not SO MUCH AS YOU OF COURSE.
Caesar WILL KILL YOU. - THAT MAY BE.
I'm NOT AFRAID TO DIE.
I'm TIRED.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
Yes. MY FEELING IS EXACT
do NOT! DO NOT TALK TO ME OF THE REPUBLIC.
if I HAD KNOWN WHAT WRETCHED COMPANY
and ROTTEN FOOD I WOULD ENDURE,
if I HAD KNOWN WHAT AN OLD FOOL IS POMPEY,
I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT ROME.
forgive MY ANGER.
I AM NOT MYSELF. - THINK NOTHING OF IT.
I MERIT YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT.
I PROPOSE WE MAKE FOR AMPHIPOLI.
I HAVE MEN AND MONEY THERE,
and WE CAN GO BY SEA TO EGYPT.
ptolemy's CHILDREN ARE LOYAL FRIENDS OF MINE.
perhaps...
perhaps IT'S BETTER WE DO NOT TRAVEL TOGETHER.
perhaps YOU'RE RIGHT.
better.
no DOUBT - I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
something SHOULD HAVE TURNED UP BY NOW.
I'm NOT MEANT TO DIE THIS WAY.
you WERE MISINFORMED. - DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
still...
it'd BE GOOD TO SEE MY MOTHER AGAIN.
do YOU THINK THEY HAVE A SYSTEM - FOR FINDING PEOPLE? - WHAT?
in THE AFTERLIFE-- HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT FINDING PEOPLE?
there MUST BE MILLIONS OF THEM. - MUST BE.
she WON'T RECOGNIZE ME, PROBABLY.
I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN SHE DIED.
probably GIVE HER A BIG SCARE THOUGH, HUH?
big, UGLY BRUTE COMING ALONG AND GIVING HER A HUG.
look AT THAT. - WHAT?
that CORPSE.
the PLUTONIC AETHER INFLATES HIM.
what OF IT?
you've NOT BEEN DRINKING SEAWATER, HAVE YOU?!
husband, EAT. - OH, YEAH.
man: OVER HERE, MY DEAR.

we're ON AN ADVENTURE, EH?
the FIRST ONE TO SEE THE SEA AND CRY OUT
will HAVE A PEACH WHEN WE GET TO AMPHIPOLI.
you, YOUR NAME AGAIN?
LYSANDROS. - LYSANDROS, HOW FAR TO AMPHIPOLI?
Oh, VERY CLOSE. CLOSE.
we WILL CONTINUE THERE AS PLANNED.
you're NOT ALLOW TO ANNOUNCE MY IDENTITY TO THOSE THAT WE MEET.
and IF THEY ASK?
MELLA.
aeneas MELLA. - HEAR AND OBEY, CAPTAIN.
and WHO'LL PAY?
PAY？
you've BEEN PAID ALREADY.
for GUIDING, NOT FOR PROTECTION.
I HAVE MANY MEN AND SUPPLIES
and AMPLE COIN IN AMPHIPOLI.
you WILL BE PAID THERE. - NONE WITH YOU NOW? COIN?
none! I'LL TOLERATE NO MORE YOUR IMPUDENCE!
no DISRESPECT, CAPTAIN. ONLY ASKING.
we GO.
you DRIVE ME INSANE WITH YOUR WRETCHED MUTTERING.
what IS WRONG THAT YOU MUST HARASS THE GODS SO?
nothing.
well, STOP IT THEN.
Servilia SENDS TO INVITE YOU TO WEAVE WITH HER TOMORROW.
I CANNOT. - OF COURSE YOU CAN. I'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED.
I CANNOT! - I KNOW SHE'S TEDIOUS.
I MEAN REALLY, WEAVING,
but WE MUST KEEP HER HAPPY FOR THE TIME BEING.
but
both: THE SEA! THE SEA!
unison. YOU SHALL BOTH HAVE A PEACH.
look, MAMA. DEAD PEOPLE.
it's GOOD, HUH?
where DO YOU COME FROM?
Brindisi.
ROMES I KNOW YOU.
where DO I KNOW YOU FROM?
I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU BEFORE.
I'm SURE I'VE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE.
leave THEM WATER AND BREAD, WE NEED TO BE GOING.
leave THEM? WEAK AS THEY ARE?
Pompey: I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.
soon BE DARK ANYHOW.
we CAMP HERE, GET TO AMPHIPOLI IN THE MORNING.
I INSIST WE GO ON.
relax, OLD MAN.
we GET THERE.
you REST EASY NOW, BOYS.

you AND ME WILL BE GOOD FRIENDS.
Hey! YOU WANT MY COCK UP YOU
or ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD A DAMN FIRE?
Pullo: I TOLD YOU WE'D BE ALL RIGHT.
there's NO BLEEDING

why SO EARLY?
best TO, I THINK. IT'LL BE DARK . soon - WHO ARE THEY? - HOW SHOULD I KNOW?! WHO CARES WHO THEY ARE?!
sorry. SORRY.
I
all WILL BE WELL,
I ASSURE YOU.
all WILL BE WELL.
Pompey MAGNUS.
that MAN LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE POMPEY MAGNUS.
that's WHY I THOUGHT I'D MET HIM.
don't POINT.
never. - IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, EH?
Pullo: HIS WIFE AND SPROUTS TOO.
Caesar's GOING TO DROWN US IN GOLD.
what DO WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
thank YOU FOR COMING.
mother INSISTED.
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT ME TO DO SOME WEAVING WITH YOU.
I'm SORRY YOU ARE UPSET.
the LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER
it's OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
are YOU FOND OF WEAVING?
Servilia: SO DID I.
and HOW IS YOUR BROTHER?
is HE STILL IN MEDIOLANUM? - HE IS.
lovely TOWN, SO I'M TOLD.
healthy AIR. - DOMINA?
what IS IT, ELENI?
word FROM GREECE.
Caesar HAS WON.
and POMPEY'S ARMIES ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED.
and MY SON?
no WORD.
don't CRY.
Legionary: HALT! IN THE NAME OF ROME!
calls HIMSELF ROME, NOW, DOES HE? SHAMELESS.
who ARE YOU AND WHAT'S YOUR PURPOSE?
we ARE ROME, BOY,
what's LEFT OF IT.
come TO SURRENDER TO YOUR CHIEF.
Brutus!
Cicero!
how HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU.
sir, I
I AM COME HERE HONORABLY,
with NO REQUEST FOR MERCY,
to SURRENDER MY ARMS AND MY HORSES - AS IS-- - SSH. WE'LL HAVE NO TALK OF SURRENDER.
we've MERELY QUARRELED A LITTLE. NOW WE ARE FRIENDS AGAIN, EH?
that IS MOST GENEROUS OF YOU
and NATURAL TO YOUR MANLY NATURE, - BUT I CANNOT-- - MY POOR BOY.
I'm SORRY. I AM SO SORRY.
not AT ALL.
it IS I AM SORRY.
I PRESENTED YOU WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA.
you DID ONLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT HONORABLE,
I'm SURE.
I KISS YOU FOR IT.
thank YOU. I WILL NOT FORGET THIS PLACE
I WOULD SAY MY MOST GENEROUS
what OF POMPEY? TELL ME HE LIVES.
he LIVES.
thank THE GODS. WHERE IS HE?
he DOES NOT PLAN TO SURRENDER.
that IS INSANE.
he CANNOT ESCAPE. WHERE CAN HE GO?
is SCIPIO WITH HIM? CATO?
they HAVE FLED TO AFRICA.
what AM I THINKING OF...
asking YOU QUESTIONS WHEN YOU MUST BE SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY?
come.
come.
so WITH THIS HAND, OTHERWISE ENGAGED
I HAD TO TAKE THAT WORM AND BEAT HIM
with MY FISTS OVER AND OVER
and OVER AGAIN!
Pompey: HIS FATHER KING PTOLEMY AULETES THE 12TH
was A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE.
I WAS ALWAYS ASSURED A LOVING WELCOME
in EGYPT. I REMEMBER ON ONE OCCASION
I WAS OUT HUNTING WITH THE KING.
we WERE HUNTING LIONS, YOU SEE.
only THE KING WAS RATHER A POOR BOWMAN,
and WE COULDN'T TELL IF THE LION WAS WOUNDED OR DEAD.
Hello, FRIENDS.
feeling BETTER, NEH? STRONG?
strong ENOUGH.
tell ME SOMETHING. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT ROMAN?
his NAME IS, UH,
aeneas MELLA.
aeneas MELLA.
that's WHAT SAY
what DO YOU HEAR OF CAESAR AND POMPEY?
they FOUGHT, I HEARD.
And?
you KNOW WHO WON.
tell US.
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU IN ANYWAY.
what's HE TALKING ABOUT? - YOU BOYS ARE CLEVER FELLOWS, I BET.
know HOW TO FIGHT.
me AND MY BOYS CAN'T TAKE HIS PEOPLE ALONE.
I WILL COUNT YOU TOGETHER, IT'S NO PROBLEM
we GO DOWN MIDDLE ON THE REWARD.
not A BAD IDEA.
you CAN HAVE THE WIFE AND CHILDREN,
I TAKE THE SLAVES.
walk AWAY...
and DO NOT SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN. - I SEE.
think YOU DON'T NEED ME, EH?
think YOU CAN KEEP THE REWARD FOR YOURSELF?
fuck YOU. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. - DON'T.
fuck YOU! I GAVE YOU YOUR LIVES BACK,
I CAN TAKE THEM AWAY AGAIN, EASY.
when I AM FINISHED SPEAKING,
you WILL TURN AND RUN - THAT WAY. - THAT WAY?
what ABOUT THIS WAY?
do NOT STOP UNTIL YOU ARE OUT OF MT SIGHT
and DO NOT DELAY, OR I WILL KILL YOU.
what IS WRONG WITH HIM?
I AM FINISHED SPEAKING.
a BIT HARSH, ISN'T IT?
fair ENOUGH DEAL HE WAS OFFERING, I THOUGHT.
what IS THE MEANING OF THIS? - SIR
speak UP! THIS MAN WAS IN MY EMPLOY!
he PLANNED TO ASSAULT YOU. - HOW DO YOU KNOW?
he ASKED US TO PARTICIPATE.
you REFUSED, STABBED HIM TO DEATH ON MY BEHALF.
what IS YOUR NAME? - I AM LUCIUS VORENUS.
prefect OF THE EVOCATI OF THE 13TH LEGION OF GALIUS JULIUS CAESAR.
Titus PULLO, LEGIONARY OF SAME.
sorry, LUCIUS VORENUS.
I AM...
AENEUS MELLA - OF PERGAMUM.
AENEUS MELLA.
you MUST CONSIDER YOURSELF UNDER MY CHARGE.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
I'm JUST A MERCHANT.
we KNOW WHO YOU ARE, SIR.
I OWN YOU NOW, UNDERSTAND?
you, YOU, BURY HIM.
the REST OF YOU...
don't LET THEM LEAVE. - LUCIUS VORENUS.
I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU ALONE.
stay HERE.
Pompey: OF COURSE I DO NOT SAY I AM
who YOU THINK I AM,
but I HAVE SPENT SOME YEARS IN THE ARMY.
perhaps WE MET ON SOME CAMPAIGN OR OTHER.
perhaps THAT'S WHY I SEEM FAMILIAR.
perhaps.
I RECALL THE 13TH...
was AT ALESIA. - WE WERE.
there's A BATTLE I'VE ALWAYS WISHED TO HAVE SEEN.
25 MILES OF WORKS, WASN'T IT?
nearer 30. - 30?
how MANY MEN DID YOU HAVE? - 60, 000.
against-- WHOA
almost DOUBLE.
at LEAST DOUBLE
the BEST MEN OF EVERY TRIBE IN GAUL.
Caesar CAN FIGHT.
I'll GIVE HIM THAT.
I REMEMBER...
when HE WAS NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU.
I SENT HIM TO WINTER QUARTERS IN
in, UH...
where WAS IT?
no MATTER.
long TIME GONE.
I MUST ASK YOU, SIR, IF I MAY.
how DID YOU COME TO THIS ROAD?
surely...
Pompey HAD CAESAR AT GREATER DISADVANTAGE.
he DID.
he DID.
it DIDN'T SEEM POSSIBLE TO LOSE.
that's ALWAYS A BAD SIGN.
the BATTLEFIELD WAS ON A PLAIN
by A RIVER, AT THE FOOT OF SOME LOW HILLS
like THIS, YOU SEE.
my MEN HELD THEIR GROUND WELL,
so I SENT MY HORSES
at HIS RIGHT FLANK.

what's ALL THIS THEN, SOLDIER?
not MUCH OF A WELCOME PARTY.
Oh, YOU KNOW EGYPTIANS, SIR, IT'S JUST THEIR WAY. FUNNY PEOPLE.
they ARE WELL...
onward FRIEND.
I'm SORRY, SIR.
hard to believe it's been ten years, Mr. Hartwell.
not yet. Please. I need more time.
I'm generous with a lot of things, my friend, but that is not one of them.
let me tell you about a violinist I knew.
the hard truth was he just wasn't talented enough.
what do you think he would have given to be the best?
anything.
not anything.
everything.
I'm begging you.
please, just another year.
you signed a binding contract.
now it's time to settle up.
Oh, dear god, I thank you.
this is 995.
we're looking for 999 park avenue.
Oh, there it is. It's so beautiful.
yeah omg good
Oh, my.
Really?
alright excuse of is we did my grandma's package arrive yet?
Yeah, I'm on the phone.
he's so busy.
Mrs. Doran will see you now in the penthouse.
great. - Thank you.
hope you get the job.
higher. Get a bigger ladder. It needs to go higher.
uh, can I help you?
uh, we have an interview. Henry martin. Jane van been.
Oh, of course, for the manager position.
Yes. - Welcome.
I'm olivia doran.
um, can I get you an espresso? Sparkling water?
I- I'm okay. No, thanks. - Thank you, though. We're- We're good.
let me tell gavin you're here.
the resident manager handles the day-to-day running of the drake apartments
managing the books, collecting the rent, general maintenance and upkeep.
it's not full-time. Most managers keep their day jobs.
where you living now?
Queens. We have a sublet on a 1- bedroom, but it's-it's short-term, though.
we were looking for a new apartment on craigslist, actually, when we saw your ad, and thought, hey, we can do that.
we're responsible and - And hardworking, and...
handy. - yes.
well, she is.
I see you work for the mayor.
Henry was handpicked by the mayor's chief of staff right out of law school.
is that right?
it wasn't a big deal.
actually, it kind of was.
how about you, jane? Are you working?
presently, no.
I mean, I had a job lined up at an architectural firm here in the city- Nichols & rourke
but it kind of fell through at the last minute, so...
well, what can I say? This is new york.
not everybody gets to make it.
look, you're not the first people to come to this city with some grand ambition.
it's the essential truth of who we are. We all want something.
but to be blunt, I'm not in the charity business.
I need people who know what they're doing.
thanks for coming in.
thank you for having us.
I was wondering, when did you have the foundation retrofitted?
retrofitted? Why would I do that?
well, the drake was built in 1923, right?
and the mob controlled concrete back then- The morello gang, I believe
and they cut corners to skim a profit, like, with steel rebar, for example.
and you know this how? - Well
Oh, she has degrees in architecture and historic preservation.
she's kind of a nut about this stuff.
that's why a lot of new york buildings from that time now reinforce their foundations, just in case.
you know, if the city was ever hit by an earthquake or a hurricane or some other nasty act of god, well, shame on me if I didn't say something.
nasty act of god"?
heaven forbid.
maybe I dismissed you too quickly.
the drake's got 12 floors, with the dorans' penthouse on the 13th.
203 apartments full up - Some renovated, some not.
total of 388 residents in the house.
I thought every building around here had gone co-op.
we're the last rental building in the neighborhood.
Mr. Doran likes to approve every tenant himself.
obviously, whatever you guys said won him over, you know?
I was, uh, sort of lobbying for the job myself, you know.
sorry. - What are you saying sorry for?
Mrs. Doran's choice, not yours.
Hey, it's not like, uh, you took the job from me.
so a lot of families live here?
a few. Mostly yuppies like you two, some, uh, artsy types, and we got a few working-class folks living under rent control.
the trash chute's clogged again, tony.
I had to walk three flights.
Oh, I'll get someone right on that, Mr. Leonard.
our new resident managers jane and henry, meet brian leonard, our resident shakespeare.
nice to meet you. - hi.
Yeah. Congrats. Uh, we're up on six-me and my wife.
Oh, what do you write?
I'm working on a new play.
Broadway?
it's more off-broadway.
uh, yeah, well, let me get rid of this, but, uh, welcome to the building.
nice to meet you.
all righty. Here we go.
apartment 3b.
Oh, my god. - What?
living room, two bedrooms, two full baths, gas fireplaces in both the master bedroom and the living room.
are - Are you sure this is our apartment?
Yeah. Yeah, it comes with the job.
um, what happened to the previous manager?
Yeah, why would anybody ever wanna leave this?
as I understand it, Mr. Hartwell moved someplace warmer.
Arizona, I think.
anyway, i,uh, I gotta get back to the front desk.
your keys.
Oh, thank you.
enjoy the place, all right? - All right.
this place is definitely not futon-friendly.
welcome home.
can you believe this?!
the girl seems nice. I like her spirit.
and she's beautiful.
she's how we get henry.
I'm back.
Yeah, the 21 millimeter for the wide shots...
but I'm gonna shoot of lot of it with the 120.
she's gonna be wearing the marchesa for this.
Yeah. That's it.
uh, honey, will you get some soy milk when you go out today and some other things? I made a list.
Yeah, I wasn't planning on going out.
Brian, please. I don't have time.
uh, yes, the 2400 ringflash.
Yeah. Okay. bye.
you know I work, too, right?
I'm sorry, honey.
you're right. It's just- It's- It's a short list.
fine. I'll take care of it.
thank you.
Hey, I met our new managers when I was taking out the trash.
yeah?
Yeah. A couple, about our age.
do they have names?
Jane, uh... And, uh, and s-steve.
or-or harry? - Steve or harry?
you don't miss much, do you?
okay. Take the, uh, elevator up and start unloading. I'll close up.
all right. I'll have a beer waiting.
sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. i - I live here.
it's okay. Uh, I'm - I'm jane, the new resident manager. hi.
John barlow.
excuse me. I cut my hand.
W - Wash that with soap.
babe, he cut his hand. It happens.
it was covered in blood, henry.
I thought you said it was a little bit of blood.
well... It was enough that I noticed.
and then... He noticed that I noticed, and he looked guilty.
so he was drenched in blood and looked guilty?
what does guilty look like?
Yeah. Do you mind not being a lawyer for a second and parsing every word I say?
my point is, you tend to notice if you've cut yourself that bad.
you know, it's a different story when it's not your blood.
you know... We're not in kokomo anymore.
no, definitely not. This is way better.
God!
God, please forgive me.
my attorney's drawing up employment contracts for you and henry.
I'll let you know when I have them.
Tony, last maintenance report?
here you go, Mr. Doran.
Oh, and Mrs. Doran asked for both you and jane to come upstairs when you're done.
let her know we're on our way.
we have some ongoing maintenance issues.
I want you to do a full walk-through, and note any needed repairs.
sure. w - What's wrong with the elevators?
they can be a little temperamental.
the drake is an old building.
our water is still heated by gas boiler from 1952.
I'll be gutting the basement later this year and a few floors to modernize things.
let me know if you need any help.
I already have someone, but thank you.
sure.
ms. Leonard. Heading for the park?
one of these days, gavin, I'm gonna make you go for a run with me.
Hi. I'm louise.
Jane. Nice to meet you.
Oh, right. You're the new manager.
I think you met my husband brian- Glasses, kinda nerdy-cute.
he's a playwright, and I expect a successful one soon.
Yes, we did meet him.
you should stop by for drinks sometime. We're up on six.
sure.
it's a friendly building.
actually, i,uh, I met someone last night.
a man named john barlow?
Barlow. 8b.
an accountant.
his lovely wife mary died recently.
I'm sorry. That's... So sad.
Jane, you're here.
I am delighted you and henry are joining us at the drake.
what a beautiful necklace.
Oh, thank you. It was my grandmother's.
Oh, gavin, darling, the crawfords - They canceled on us.
I thought we could invite henry and jane.
well, that's a good idea.
tomorrow night, there's a cocktail party for patrons of the symphony and a performance afterwards.
it's black tie.
that sounds amazing.
uh, henry and I would love to go. thank you.
good.
Hey, babe.
we have a date saturday night.
we do?
with the dorans. a - A black tie thing with the symphony.
and I - I said we'd love to go because... Well, we'd love to go, right?
Yeah. Of course. I gotta dust off my tux first.
what are you gonna wear? - Hell if I know.
Oh, listen, babe, I gotta roll. But why don't you just go buy something?
because I have $11 in my checking account right now, henry. i
okay, well, I have... I have $7.
it is yours if you need it. I will skip lunch.
uh, look, i'll - I'll figure it out. Okay?
all right, I'll call you later.
Bye.
God!
sorry. you- you- You surprised me.
this place will keep you on your toes.
I'm nona. - Jane. Nice to meet you again, nona.
what's with the clipboard?
Oh, I'm just noting what needs to be fixed.
quite a lot, apparently.
Yeah. Washer number three is leaking.
anything else I should know?
well, there's a thief in the building.
it's not tvs getting stolen or anything. Just small stuff.
I'll keep an eye out.
I like your necklace.
Thanks.
God.
Oh, my god.
in here!
you wanna hop in?
I have some work to - Yeah, I do.
so I just ran into gavin in the lobby, and he asked me to go to the range tomorrow and hit golf balls.
sure.
Henry. - What?
I found something really cool in the basement today.
please tell me it was dripping with blood.
so what is this cool thing you found?
a mosaic in the floor.
I mean, it - It's dirty and covered with clutter.
obviously nobody's seen it in years.
but from what I could see, it looked like a dragon.
is it original to the building?
Well,"drake" means "dragon," so it's a good bet.
and it wasn't unusual for architects of that time to choose a motif, so...
why would they put it down there?
it depends on what that room was used for back then.
in 1923, who knows?
I'm gonna hit the library tomorrow and see what I can dig up.
you should tell gavin.
he kinda shot me down when I offered to help with the renovation.
I... I get the sense that he thinks i'm out of my depth.
so you're gonna prove to him that you're not, correct?
maybe.
you know, there are things about the drake that have been forgotten for years.
maybe... Maybe I can convince him to preserve some of it and not...
rip the heart and the soul out of this place.
okay, just don't get fired for being nosey.
this apartment rocks.
how you doing, john?
it's in all the papers.
they're looking for me.
we made a deal. You kept your end, I kept mine.
check the bedroom.
you came back to me.
did you?
not really.
Hey, look, it's okay. Look, I just... Have a lot going on lately.
you need a 12-step program for that thing.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't believe she did this to me.
what's wrong? - I don't believe it.
Amy just quit on me, in an e - mail. That bitch.
it's gonna be fine.
it's not gonna be fine, brian. I have my first cover shoot for "vogue" on monday, and my assistant tells me this morning that she's leaving me.
do you know how hard it was to get this job? I'm screwed.
Lou, you can handle this.
all right, listen, you have time to find somebody else.
and if you can't, I'm happy to help haul a camera case...
or change a lens, whatever you need.
you're all right.
after all the crap I give you, how can you be so good to me?
cause you're my wife and I love you.
I know I'm not easy to deal with sometimes.
Yeah, I could tell.
I gotta make some calls. - All right.
I bought the drake in '86, and its doubled in value, what, a dozen times.
my first property.
I was still resident manager then.
that is impressive.
Yeah, not bad for a college dropout, eh?
the drake's come a long way since then.
but then, so have i.
well, that's a serious swing. You ever play for money?
no. No, I'm not much of a gambler.
but you moved to new york, got a job in the mayor's office.
that's ambition. With ambition, there is risk.
so I'm-i'm gambling with my life?
always.
Jane. - Olivia. what a surprise.
the door was open.
I thought I locked it.
let's go. I am taking you dress shopping.
Oh, and get cleaned up, dear, and... Change your shoes.
Yeah, a- Actually, I was gonna hit the library first before
I am taking you someplace special, jane.
hurry. I only have the morning.
you're in my spot, doran.
Daniel stone, meet henry martin, a friend of mine.
nice to meet you. - How you doing, henry?
Hey, I hear you tried to offer $30 mill in a short sale with the bank on my waterfront property.
well, you were in a pinch, danny boy. I was just trying to help.
I don't want your help, gavin.
I want you to back off and let me work it out.
work what out?
I hear that the city is not budging on the environmental regs.
now you're overleveraged and hanging on by your fingertips.
I can help you.
I'd rather go bankrupt than sell to you.
suit yourself.
you seem like a nice kid, henry.
you should keep better company.
I'm sorry. W as he talking about the greenpoint towers complex?
in brooklyn. You know it?
Yeah. Uh, gavin, I work for city planning.
we're in a legal dispute with that property right now.
it's highly improper, possibly illegal for me to have any contact with Mr. Stone.
well, I didn't realize that. I'm sorry.
don't worry about it. you - You didn't know.
she'll try the two chanels and the other carlos miele.
any others you like, jane?
um, they're all so, uh, beautiful. I don't know.
you keep looking at the red one.
the mcqueen.
it's the best dress here.
that was sasha's favorite color. My daughter.
I didn't know you had a daughter.
she, uh, died a long time ago, in a car accident.
Oh, olivia, I - I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
that's all right. It... Snuck up on me.
I don't - I don't need to try on the red one.
Oh, don't be silly. See how it looks. I insist.
okay.
I'm sorry, olivia, but these just cost way too much for me.
Oh, please. I'm buying the dress for you.
you liked the red one, right?
no, no, no, no, really, I - I can't.
this costs more than my car.
well, then, I guess I'll let you find something more to your liking.
Oh, no, no, please - Please don't take offense.
why would i? I'm gonna be late for my appointment.
you'll find your way back to the drake?
I got that soy milk you wanted, lou.
had to go to two different grocery stores to find it.
Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant.
Hey, you found someone? see?
I knew you would.
Brian, this is alexis. An editor at "elle" hooked us up.
can you believe it? She lives in the neighborhood.
right across the street, actually.
Hi. Nice to meet you, brian.
Hi.
that cafe's where we had our second date. Do you remember?
you kissed me over dessert.
you were nervous.
I was a wreck.
you said you loved me, and I could see it in your eyes.
no one had ever looked at me that way before.
what's wrong?
I feel cold, john.
let me take you home.
what's happening to me?
Mr. Doran will know what to do.
I can't lose her again.
there's only one way to cheat death.
you mean I... I have to hurt someone else?
you only said one.
and now I'm saying another.
look for an envelope under your door.
you're only renting this life, my friend.
make the payment, or she's not long for this world, and
babe, you got 30 minutes to get ready.
have you, uh, have you seen my cufflinks?
is this what you're wearing?
Yeah. It was cheap. Does it look cheap?
no. No, it looks nice.
you're a lousy liar.
Hey, check this out. It's from 1927.
they were a fraternal brotherhood called the order of the dragon.
now look closer at the floor. See the mosaic?
that's right here in this building, henry.
great. So the basement was a man cave.
funny. See the door in the back wall?
compare that to this photo I took.
solid concrete wall. No door.
why would they seal it up?
well, I'm wondering that myself.
Oh, my god! I've only got 30 minutes to get ready! Why didn't you tell me?!
Yeah. Right. Shoulda mentioned it.
Jane, I'm serious. Have you seen my cufflinks?
Henry? - What?
what's this? - What's what?
it was sitting in the hall.
who's it from?
Oh, boy.
well done, my dear.
keep an eye on the clock. Our reservation's at 8: 00.
Yeah, I'm gonna wrap it up in a few.
sweetie, they're not gonna hold our table if we're late, okay?
so how'd you find alexis?
do you not listen to me, ever?
I told you, my friend maggie at "elle" magazine gave me her name.
and you're sure she's qualified?
Yes. I checked her out.
she's really got it together.
so why are you so interested in her?
cause she's so smokin' hot?
no.
you are such a liar, you know that?
Oh, my god! lou!
help! Hey, somebody help!
help!
help!
what's going on?
ambulance is on the way.
7 in a major"] \w i'm sorry.
I... I just couldn't... Do it again.
it's okay.
I think you have just become... A poster child for upper east side decadence.
apparently the, uh, the patrons circle like their cocktails quite strong.
unzip me?
Hey, you okay?
what's wrong?
I don't know. i...
during the concert, gavin gave me this... This look.
it was weird.
I - I don't know.
Oh, baby, you had a few drinks tonight. It's all right.
things have been really intense lately
moving to new york, getting this job, moving in here, meeting the dorans.
I mean, it's been wonderful and amazing, too, but...
it might be a little overwhelming.
are we gonna be okay here?
you disappoint me, john.
how did you get in here?
Where's mary?
she's going back where she belongs.
I certainly expected more out of you.
it's not right, what you do.
what I do is fulfill needs.
you wanted to be with your wife.
I made that happen.
I told you what to do to keep her here, but you didn't think the price was worth it.
your choice.
now it's time to settle up.
please.
Henry, did you hear that?
Hello? Somebody?!
Hello?
Mrs. Barlow?
Mary, please.
please, please don't.
you shouldn't have come here.
they're never going to let you go.
No!
how you feeling?
I... Like I need coffee.
you okay?
I had the strangest dreams all night.
this place seemed so, uh... So dark.
that's your guilty conscience telling you there's a lightbulb to change somewhere.
so I just went to the lobby to get the paper, and tony said there was an accident with the elevator last night.
um, remember that guy we met? Uh, the writer brian?
his wife got hurt. She's in the hospital.
Louise? Is she okay?
I don't know. I don't know. Tony said it was pretty bad.
we should go visit her, see if she needs anything. god.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, and gavin called.
1 uh, the contracts from his lawyer are ready for us to sign.
so we should, uh, we should go. You wanna hop in the shower?
Yeah. - All right.
it's fairly boilerplate.
standard 1-year with an option for another.
the second contract is your residential lease.
so we can quit any time without penalty?
quit or get fired.
all it says it that I don't have to pay you anymore.
I don't think we'll be quitting, sir.
Yeah. You and olivia have been very, very generous.
one more thing, jane.
Henry tells me that you've been studying the history of the drake.
digging deep" were his words.
I may have said something last night after some cocktails.
I've been doing a little research on the side, yeah.
I don't think these new plans preserve enough of the building's style.
I want the drake restored to its original glory, and I would be interested to hear how you would do it.
of course. Gavin, thank you so much.
good. Now sign the contracts and get out of here. You got a lot of work to do.
all right!
Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
no, but come on, we're off to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast, but this has gotta be some kind of a record!
Oh, you made it! - Hi.
how the hell did you beat us here? - We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
no, we took a cab too. But I did test runs...
Hey, you made it!
okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk. I'm gonna go have a baby.
okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene. I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so...
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private? We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
and, currently, they're all unavailable. - Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
yeah?
give her some money. - I really think they're out of rooms.
they're not, Ross. They're just saving them for important people!
okay? What if I was the president?
well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble. You don't know where any countries are.
okay.
say, would you mind checking again?
see if any private rooms may have opened up?
this is a hospital.
okay, I see. Could we please talk to the manager?
there is no manager.
just nurses, doctors and semi-private rooms.
okay, you know what? I have to say, I don't really care for your tone.
and this is not the only hospital in this city, and we have no problem... Oh, gosh!
what? What? - Contraction!
would you like to see a semi-private room? - Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

is labor really as painful as everybody says it is?
Oh, look at that. My beeper's going crazy.
Hey, don't... You know what? You're gonna be fine.
I guess we have some time to kill. - Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
never done this before.
don't feel good.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
thank you very much. I think we're ready to...
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay. Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
Hi, Julie. This is Rachel. - Oh, hi, Rachel.
is this your first? - Yeah, it is.
well, little Jamie here is our third.
so if you have any questions, or you need anything at all, just holler.
that's so sweet. - Yeah.
let me give you guys some privacy. - Nonsense. We're all in this together.
we are gonna share every moment of this with you.
I think we're gonna have some fun. - Yeah.
Oh, okay, I guess. - Hey, smile!
I don't know if... - I really don't want any...
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross! Here comes another contraction.
okay, just breathe.
Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too! - Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
here you go! - Oh, no!
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
the miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.
Hey, you wanna see something? - Sure. What?
this is gonna be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler.
honey? - Yeah?
listen, I've been doing some thinking...
...and I don't know whether it's because we're here...
...or Rachel's giving birth...
...but I think we should try to have a baby.
okay.
what's that now?
okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I think we're ready.
are you kidding? You think we're ready to have a baby now?
this is fun.
you're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
you said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird...
...like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
Yeah, but no one ever wanted to have one with me. I mean...
now I'm just gonna have a baby if I want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?
I'm sorry I brought it up.
okay, then, back off, mister!
because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
what? Are you crazy? - That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very... Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters. That's about four fingers!
doctor let me feel it myself. - Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
no, I don't... We're not gonna do that. - We won't be doing that.
well, if you like, you could feel Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
am I interrupting? - Yes! Thank you! Later.
no, you can't leave me alone with them. - Oh, I'm sorry.
no, Ross? Ross? Ross? My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I wish you'd called first.
that's all right. I'm coming back later with your father.
I needed to talk to you before the birth. - Okay. What's up?
Ross, I want to talk to you as your mother...
...even though I know that you and I are also very close friends.
I really don't know what you're talking about, but okay.
I brought something that I want to give you.
assuming, of course, that you want it.
ma, you're asking me to marry you?
this is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
mom, no. Come on. Thank you. - Just hear me out...
No! Okay? We've been through this.
we're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
you think young people use that word more than we actually do.
Ross, a child should have a family.
you know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
go... Hey, go talk to Monica.
she got a new haircut. You'll hate it.
just think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
give me.
Hi, dear. - Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
you wanna see something funny?
Monica.
okay. All right, stop it. You're freaking me out.
do it again. Do it again.
Hey, Rachel had the baby.
what? - Really?
no.
I don't know why I thought that'd be funny.
you said hi to Mom before she left, right?
I thought that was her.
Yeah, I called her name, and she ducked into a stairwell.
well, you know what? Consider yourself lucky.
she pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
Oh, my God. - How annoying.
Yeah.
why aren't you with Rachel? - You're kidding, right?
look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
and I know she's not just some girl I humped...
Oh, humped?
come on, Ross.
but it just seems that you two belong together.
okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
right. And with who again?
he's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
I know.
seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean, I know she turned me down...
...but if she hadrt and she wanted to be with me...
...I would take her in my arms and...
I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I?
Hey. - Hey.
who's that? - New people.
what happened to the Disgustingtons?
they're having their baby. It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.
Wow. Sorry.
so how are the new people?
well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard.
Oh, gosh, a contraction. - Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
are you looking at her? - No!
don't you look at her, you sick bastard! - Honey, I swear I wasrt looking at her!
she's in labor. You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna...
see? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
no, no. I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
you miss your girlfriend?
just ignore them.
you okay? - Yeah.
Ross. - What?
he's looking at me. - Hey!
you wanna live to see your baby?
don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
Oh, don't worry. These babies are far too ugly for us.
what is going on with you. Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
what?
we've always talked about having babies someday, not now...
...but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good.
we're really good.
we are pretty good.
but nothing has to happen until you're ready.
well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
what? It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!
what? - I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
so we're gonna try? I mean, we're trying?
we're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
so when do you want to start trying? - All right, hold on a sec.
period math? - Yeah.
well, we could start trying now.
right here? - No, not here.
maybe here.
it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill, and we're in a building that's full of beds!
and it's so clean!
come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
it ate your money? - No.
I'll see you downstairs then. - All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
Hi. - Hi.
Oh, up or down? - Oh. Down, please.
I hate to be a ball-buster, but can I just do it?
could you press up too? - Sure.
I feel bad. I broke my leg once too. - Yeah? How'd yours happen?
well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
how about you? - Car accident.
some idiot on a cell phone wasrt paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
sorry. - Oh, no. No, don't be.
nobody else got hurt. And I was pretty lucky.
well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
are you sure? I mean, you don't know me.
I could have been sent from another planet to destroy Earth.
CoulDrt press the "down" button. I think Earth's okay.
Oh, hey, that's me.
Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.
well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else...
Yeah, I would like that.
great. I'm in room... - Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
you gotta press the button.
the nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
she doesn't need to be. She'll still have the baby before I do.
Oh, Ross! Another contraction. - Oh, okay. Here, here.
that's it.
Oh, that sounded like a bad one. - Yeah, it was.
mine haven't been so bad. Oh, here comes one now.
Oh, that was a big one.
that was, like, the biggest one yet. Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay, honey.
well, I got some bad news. It gets worse.
and when you get to the end, they get really big...
...and they come, like, every minute.
well, mine are pretty close together. I think...
excuse me. - Yeah, that's quite all right.
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna. What's yours?
excuse me, could you help me with something?
I'm looking for a man.
well, who isn't?
you. You aren't.
good for you.
anyway, the patient I'm looking for has a broken leg.
he's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid-30s, very attractive.
even you would think so.
I know who you're talking about. - Great! What room number is he in?
I'm sorry. Patient information is confidential.
no, I'm not gonna bother him. We were talking earlier...
ma'am, I'm sorry. That information is restricted to hospital staff.
she's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray. - Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information. I'm a doctor.
a doctor at this hospital? - Damn it, we're losing precious time.
you want this mars blood on your head...?
hands. - Hands!
it is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in.
he's a patient of mine. I've treated him for years.
he's in room 816. - 816. Thank you.
and what is his name? - No.
I think we found a place. - Okay.
wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
not like that. - Oh, okay.
we'll dim the lights. - Okay.
or turn them out altogether.
no scented candles. Okay, here. There we go.
okay, okay. Making me sterile, but okay.
okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait. Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98. 6. You're gonna be fine.
this is it!
that's him! - Great. Go get him!
wait a second. Or maybe you could go in first.
he's not really my type.
not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him questions and see what he's like.
people tell doctors everything. - You said he was this great guy.
all the guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.
you do attract some stinkers. - Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
three women have come and gone with their babies.
you gotta give me good news. How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
three. - Just three?
I'm dilated three!
we are moving along just slowly. Don't worry, you're doing great.
I'll be back soon. - Thank you.
you know what? I'm not waiting. I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters. That's gotta be like this, right?
actually, it's more like this. - Oh, stupid metric system.
we're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh, for the love of God!
it's coming! It's coming!
and here it is!
Oh, come on!
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist. Just to be on the safe side...
...Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
that was a test. Good response.
all right. Full name? - Clifford Burnett.
date of birth? - November 16, 1968.
age?
can't you figure that out? - I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
I'm 33. - Okay.
and are you married? - No.
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues?
are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry. - Yeah.
I lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction.
a heart attack, doctor. - Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car...
are you experiencing any dizziness?
no.
has the pain been getting worse? - No.
do you sleep with women and never call them again?
no. - Excellent. Excellent.
and finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
No! - Wrong answer.
this room's available. - Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
since I have been waiting, four women...
...that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated...
...have come and gone with their babies. I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
if you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.
not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you. My husband is a lawyer.
Rach? - You get back on that case, honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
and yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great. We're gonna be baby buddies!
squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
Hi, sweetie! - Hi, sweetheart.
this is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it. I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
you have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
Oh, there you go. - Of course he is.
congratulations, you two. I didn't even know you got married.
Oh, we didn't. - What?
we're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
Why?
we're just not in that place, you know? But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
what else? What else? - He's 33.
a widower.
he seemed like a standup guy. And he's not into anything weird sexually.
enter Pheebs!
should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
we could. Or we could have sex in it.
well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!
okay, mister! Fertilize me!
does that sound like Janice?
if it's not, then there's two of them.
and that would mean it's the end of the world!
Hey.
Hey. - Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How you doing?
not bad. You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
and soon someone will call her "Mom.
weirdest thing. Did I hear...?
mother of God, it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Janice.
not just Janice. Janice in labor. Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis.
you remember, Chandler.
I feel so bad for you.
she's your ex. And I have Richard.
Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.
who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
it's you.
this is yours.
what?
look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
that's funny. Does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
okay, I've got one for you. If you had to, which would you eat?
a Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
Oh. Somebody went to college. - Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
Oh. I'll get it.
I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
relax. It's not like we're forking.
when. When.
thank you. Listen.
you seem to really know what to do with a utensil.
would you like to go to dinner sometime?
Yeah, I'd really like that. - Yeah?
Yeah. And I promise I won't make you eat any remarkable animals.
I was thinking...
...l'd kind of like to make a move.
but, you know, with the leg.
Oh, yeah.
maybe a little help.
okay.
let me fix your pillow.
cliff, you're so forward.
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
Sid!
that's the first time I heard her voice.
I didn't care for it.
Oh, that's five, Ross. Five women have had five babies...
...and I have had no babies.
why doesn't she want to come out?
you know what I think it is? I think you made such a nice home for her...
...over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
Oh, God. - Okay. Okay.
twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
doctor, you gotta do something! Get me drugs...
...or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!
actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
what?
ten centimeters. You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
you know what?
this one is.
Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.
well, it must be one of those closed-circuit hospital channels.
no, no. That's a soap opera.
this is a very dramatic hospital.
I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here...
...asking me all these weird questions.
okay, Mr. Percocet.
I swear to you, that's the guy.
okay, Cliff.
do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
what probably happened was you were watching this, you drifted off to sleep...
...and you dreamt he was here.
Rachel's having her baby!
which is of no interest to me as a neurologist. I...
that's him! You know him?
wake up, Cliff!
what is going on?
okay. Okay. I... Okay.
I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
if it... You know, if it helps, you came off great.
a lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was a fake doctor?
fake? Excuse me? Hello?
you tried making me think I was crazy? - That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
it's just that I liked you so much. Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
if I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
she was married to a gay ice dancer.
she gave birth to her brother's triplets.
her twin sister used to do porn.
we're trying to dial down the crazy. - Right.
we don't really know each other, so it'd be easy to forget about this...
...but there's something between us. I don't know about you...
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
it doesn't happen to me either. - Me neither!
the baby! Rachel! - Right, right!
Oh, I love this scene.
okay, look. I gotta go too.
but... What do you say? Can we just have that dinner?
the triplets.
you and your brother didn't...?
No! No, they implanted embryos.
then dinner sounds great. - Great! Okay.
all right, then I'll see you later.
our friend's having a baby.
her own? - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
no, she's really old-fashioned.
push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.
five, four...
three, two, one! Oh!
the next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
I can't push anymore! - You're doing great.
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
come on. - Push. Wait.
I see something. - What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
don't say "Oh, my God!" What?! - What is that?
the baby's buttocks. She's breech.
I thought she had two heads. - Oh, God!
is she gonna be okay?
she's gonna be fine. - Okay.
she's in a more difficult position, so you have to push harder now.
okay. - That's it. Push. Push.
you're gonna have to push even harder.
I'm sorry, I can't! I can't! - Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
I had no idea. Please, you do it for me!
let's go. One more time. One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
good.
keep pushing!
are you okay?
you have no idea how much this hurts.
keep going! Keep going!
here we go!
she's upside down, but she's coming!
Oh, God! - Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she's here.
Oh, she's perfect.
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
Where'd she go? - They're just wrapping her up.
okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
here she is.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. Oh.
she's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
do we have a name yet? - No, not yet.
that's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Greene.
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
Hello, Baby Girl.
can we come in? - Oh, come on in.
Oh, there she is. - Oh, she's so beautiful.
here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
it's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you...
...and then 47 hours later, here she is.
she looks so real.
you know what I mean.
she's this whole tiny little person.
and she already has eyelashes and knees and...
what? - Oh, no, no. It's okay.
for a second, I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand. So we're good.
okay, my turn. My turn. - Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
honey, what's the matter? - Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
the doctor said it's normal, with all the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
so. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Oh, God.
what's the matter now? - I was reliving it.
do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original.
actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
and you know what? I love them both. So just pick one, and that'll be it.
wow, okay. Everyone...
...this is Isabella.
Hi, Isabella! - Hi.
what?
that's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
so then I guess Ferdinand is out.
what was the other one? - Delilah.
Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
what are we gonna do?
it's okay. You'll find a name. - Easy for you to say.
you already know what your kids' names will be.
you do? - I had them picked out since I was 14.
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
well, tell us, what are they? - Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
and if it's a girl? - I don't wanna say.
Oh, stop. Tell us. We're not gonna want it.
okay. It's Emma.
Emma.
see, I don't want it.
do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?
take it. - What?
she's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
besides, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed.
Hi, Emma.
Yep, that's you.
you're our little Em.
what's that, honey?
what?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
you want a cousin right now?
do I look like a giant sperm to all of you, or...?
that was amazing. - I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
we may have started our family. In nine months we could be here...
...having our own baby.
and if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
I love you so much.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
you wanna do it again?
this time just for us?
probably.
aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
he's a keeper.
look at the little munchkin.
don't you worry. By the time you're old enough to date him...
...he's gonna have a different nose.
how you feeling? - Oh, I'm fine.
I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.
they all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
that's never gonna happen with Ross. - That's what I thought.
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father...
...and little Miss New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it...
...but, honey, you two are on your own.
well, that's... You know, that's...
we've been alone for the last 20 minutes and we're doing okay.
maybe we won't be alone.
because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.
and right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
so it might be the beginning of something.
Hey, Janice. - Oh, hi.
who's this little guy?
aaron, your future son-in-law. - Oh, no, no.
no.
I'm gonna leave you three alone. - Okay.
man, you see the kid on that nose?
you know what I was thinking about?
that kiss before we left the apartment. That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
but we... We gotta be careful.
we... You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
right.
we don't want to go down that road. - No. That's why I brought it up.
they didn't have any sodas? - Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse. Completely forgot.
and so it begins.
she in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.
isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful?
except that one.
what is this? A petting zoo?
look. Look at Emma.
I can't decide who she looks like, you or Rachel.
Oh, what, are you kidding? She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
no, I know. Because you're not in that place.
which would be fine, except you totally are.
it's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
you love her, you always have, you have a child together.
there's no right answer.
look, we've been together. Then apart. Then together, then apart.
and now we have a baby.
it's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out...
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world thinking everything... Now me.
what, do they put something in the water here?
it's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.
I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.
Yeah, exactly. - Right.
or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
Hey.
I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.
it is like a freak show up here.
what's the matter? - Nothing.
what is it? Hey.
really, it's nothing. I'm... - Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
what are you talking about? What about Ross?
please. He'll be with his real family. The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know...
...someday Ross is gonna meet somebody...
...and he's gonna have his own life.
right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
that's pretty dumb, huh?
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
you are never, ever gonna be alone.
okay? I promise I won't let that happen.
Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
you don't have to worry about that, okay?
could you grab me my other box of tissues?
they're under Ross' coat. - Sure.
Oh, my God!
Joey?
Oh, my God.
okay.
Taxi!
excuse me, do you have a light?
and an extra cigarette?
Thanks.
there's nothing like a morning cigarette.
coffee and cigarette.
you wouldn't believe this dream I had.
I dreamt I was back home with the missus, and I'm sitting in the kitchen next to her...
Taxi!
... drinking my coffee, smoking a cigarette.
and the missus says, "Bunny, why don't you stay home from work today, and we'll be together, just the two of us, like this?
she's not alive anymore, but...
a coffee would be nice, just like in the dream.
Oh...
listen...
you can have all my money.
I only have 50... - Hey!
if it's not enough, I'll go with you to an ATM, but please don't kill me.
I have two children. - Man, relax.
I was just gonna ask you for a buck for coffee.
I wasn't robbing you. This isn't even mine.
Oh.
so, may I ask whose it is?
I don't know.
I found it under my cardboard this morning.
you scared the shit out of me.
so... how about it, sir?
would you give me a buck for a cup of coffee?
Oh, so, that's your drill.
you scare the shit out of people, and then they're so grateful you're not really robbing them that they give you the money.
mate, you got it all wrong.
wrong, huh?
so, why the hell did you take that gun?
actually, I thought to myself
I'd ask the first person I saw for a coffee and a cigarette.
and if that person said no?
then, I might as well join the missus.
so, how about that coffee? - Or what?
you'll shoot yourself?
you know, in my field, you see a lot of manipulation.
but you?
you're the king! - Is that a yes?
what you're doing here is completely, I mean, completely, unfair.
if you have to shoot yourself, it's tragic, but...
it has nothing to do with me.
you hear? I'm not responsible.
you're absolutely right.
here's what we're gonna do...
you're gonna put the gun down and ask for that buck like a normal homeless person, and I'll answer what I answer with no connection to your situation or this gun or anything else.
okay. - Okay, what?
would you...
please... give me a dollar for a cup of coffee?
I'm sorry.
if I give you the money, I'll feel manipulated.
I'm just gonna go now, okay?
okay.
maybe tomorrow.
thank you, anyway.
you're welcome.
this city!
everybody is crazy! I swear to God!
W... what's all this blood?
are you okay?
what are you doing here?
I was cleaning the waffle maker.
what happened to the interview?
I didn't get the job.
Dave!
they said I didn't have the necessary experience.
is... is that your blood?
how much experience do you need for telemarketing?
that's what they said.
and what did you say? - Thank you, anyway.
thank you, anyway?
didn't I tell you that nice guys always finish last?
so... whose blood is this?
a nice guy.
I don't know his name.
I have to get to work, Dave.
do you feel like walking me out?
Passive-aggressive!
what's not to understand?
dad, I'm sorry about the interview.
well, what does it even mean?
passive, as in "even if I live to be 100,
I'll never wash a cup.
and aggressive, as in "I'd rather eat my own nuts than have dinner with your parents.
Oh, the mouth on her!
she reminds me of your mother.
I really think you should ask your brother to put in a good word with his boss.
it just seems so embarrassing going into peoples' homes, taking their stuff.
you're talking as if he's a burglar, Dave.
repossessing is a respectable job.
Yes, still...
well, just think about it. - Okay.
and, in the meantime, I'll go over the mail, vacuum, and cook us dinner.
how do crabs with cream and truffles sound?
great.
I will need 10 bucks for truffle shavings, though.
I didn't know that truffles shaved.
nice move!
thank you.
have you ever wondered, "What's the meaning of life? Why do we exist?
the answer to this vexing question is now within your reach!
you'll find it in a small, amazing booklet, which will explain in easy to follow, simple terms your reason for being!
don't patronize me!
the booklet, printed on the finest paper, contains illuminating, exquisite color pictures and can be yours for a mere $9. 99.
I'm not screaming!
Yes, you are.
I'm not!
I'm just talking very loud.
I don't get it.
I said I wanted to marry you.
no, no.
you said you're willing to marry me.
it's not that I'm against it.
I just... don't think that it's important.
marriage isn't important.
a baby isn't important.
a career isn't important.
what goes on in the world isn't important.
what is important?
marriage, kids...
listen to yourself.
you sound like an old maid.
Ron, I am an old maid.
we don't all manage to stay 15.
are you all right?
Yes. Why?
you've been crying.
no, it's just allergies.
I know how it is.
I have a lot of those, especially to cats.
not the cats themselves... their hair, actually.
not even their hair, but the saliva on their hair.
it's a shame, because I would really like to have one.
they're so cuddly.
you are crying.
here, have a cookie.
soccer Jack passes from the left...
let me help you.
I'm fine, thank you.
Hi, Dave. Would you like a cookie?
Oh, sorry, Mr. Kweller.
I have to run to the post office.
so, have one for the road.
they're very good.
Thanks.
you know, I once had a cousin who worked for the post office.
he wasn't exactly my cousin... - I'm sorry.
maybe you can tell me about your cousin some other time.
and that's the thing. He wasn't really my cousin.
his grandmother and my grandmother were sisters.
I'll have... two Sub-Zero Mocha-Blizzard Extravaganzas, one coke, and two of your Gigantic Chunky Chocolate-Chip Surprises.
sure, no problem. - Take away.
do you want one?
they're gigantic.
$8. 50 please. Thank you very much.
can I have one more of your mega, super-sweet teary-eyed smiles?
they are really great.
look, you seem really nice, for a repossessor... Lenny, but I'd rather be alone.
why, because I'm a repossessor?
come on. We're not that bad.
we're just like Robin Hood, only in reverse.
what's your name?
sorry.
good morning. What can I get you?
good morning. - An unplanned child?
Oh, no, not him.
Mr. Kweller! Hey, how are you doing?
Ah, you're the Pecks' boy!
I just saw your brother...
now, Mr. Kweller, have you met my fiancee?
what did you say your name was?
actually, we have met.
I saw her in the lift earlier.
she was crying.
Yeah, she's very emotional.
sometimes I think we're not gonna make it.
are you leaving, too?
I must. Duty honks.
say hello to your parents for me.
sorry. I mean, to your father.
there's no need to apologize, Mr. Kweller.
you're not the one Mom ran away with.
Lenny! - Yes, Sir.
look at him go! Pure lightning!
he turns into a... goal!
Zacky, I got you something.
soccer Jack?!
no, not Soccer Jack, but I'll tell you what we'll do.
each time you finish your milk,
I'll give you 50 cents to put in this piggy bank.
and when it's full of coins, you'll get your what's... his... name action figure.
is it a deal?
I know you're disappointed now, but I'm doing it for your sake.
how come?
because in life, you don't always get what you want.
you have to work hard for it.
kids who don't learn that grow up to be criminals because they're used to getting everything the easy way.
but remember, if you throw up...
... no money.
congrats! Who's the lucky bitch?
easy, Bisley. Don't insult the man.
why insult? I meant a hot bitch.
where?
so, when's the wedding?
no wedding. She just left.
even better.
just say the word, and Drazan here will arrange for three surfer babes who will get in line to blow you.
who are you?
who am I?
did you hear that, Stanton?
tell the man who I am.
why, he's Bisley. - Who?
king of Banana Beach.
I'm Scuba Stanton.
and this is Drazan. We go to Uni with him.
do you mind not smoking in here?
Michelle's allergic.
who the fuck is Michelle?
my fiance.
not anymore.
Hey, can I see the ring?
Thanks.
whoop! Hup!
isn't she beautiful?
you really love her.
Hey, Drazan... give it here!
Yup!
Bisley 1, bitch ex-girlfriend: 0!
what the fuck are you doing?
what's eating you?
pick up that glass now!
or what, Lover Boy?
relax, man. He didn't mean it.
I don't care. He broke it, he'll pick it up.
whoa, whoa, whoa! I say let the cards decide.
four rounds of poker.
if the big guy wins, you make like a cleaning lady and pick up the glass.
and if I win? - We'll think of something.
hmm.
the Pecks' world... famous crabs with cream and...
And?
and I spoke with Lenny about the job.
that's great news.
they have a repossession in our building tomorrow.
his boss said I can try out.
wow, the Peck boys are riding together.
I'm telling you, if I were 20 years younger,
I would quit my job and come work with you.
imagine, the three of us in a van together.
well, it's only a try... out. - I'm sure you'll do great, partner.
I ordered this book today, about the meaning of life.
the catalogue says... - How much was it?
9. 99
that's pretty cheap for nothing. - You haven't even read it.
and I thought your mom was the only one in the world who believed in those catalogues.
and look where it got her.
where?
I don't know.
you'd think she'd at least send a postcard.
Ah, it's from the gas company.
hello.
good day.
I'm calling for Quick-Pulse Surveys.
do you have time to answer a few questions?
Quick-Pulse?
that's a beautiful name.
thank you, Sir.
Albert.
my name is Albert Kweller.
okay.
Mr. Kweller, how often do you travel?
overseas or domestic?
either.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not much of a traveler.
the last time I left home was 41 years ago.
are the rest of your questions about traveling, too?
I'm afraid so.
my wife could have answered all of them.
she really loved traveling and hiking and dancing.
me... I can't hold a rhythm...
but my wife... well, you should have seen her dance!
you can't, of course. She died.
hit by a tram. The driver cried like a baby.
they took his tram license off him for life.
well, not that it matters... They don't use trams anymore.
well... I'm sorry to have bothered you.
no, no. You didn't bother me.
I really liked talking to you.
I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk.
another round?
no more cards.
I meant beer.
check out the hot chick on TV!
first Bank.
when it comes to banks, think First, because life doesn't give you a second chance.
put the gun down!
no, don't!
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.
I was.
I had a bad dream. - What did you dream about?
bad things.
enough of those to go around lately.
good night, son.
dad...
don't you ever ask yourself...
... about life? - You're a good boy, Dave.
you have a big day tomorrow.
sleep tight.
as we're nearing the end of our broadcast,
I'd like to leave you with this message...
speak, and the Lord will listen.
open your heart and pray to the Lord, and He will answer your prayers.
you're listening to GOD Radio, 91. 6 FM.
good night, and God Bless.
may I? It's very windy in your stairwell.
I think I'm getting bronchitis again.
please come in.
can I get you something warm?
Yeah, a 12... ounce, medium... rare steak with chips and salad.
or a tea.
I have Earl Grey, peach, chamomile...
Whichever, as long as it's hot.
Hey! - Sorry.
are you an angel?
no. I'm a giant talking pigeon.
is there a God?
is there a God?
are you one of those atheist, nihilistic, good... for... nothing, left-wing Communists?
God, no!
I was just very curious about Him.
is He tall?
I had a vision once...
tea first, visions later.
I'm dying here.
Ron? Hi. It's me.
it's really early. I guess you're sleeping.
I'm not.
call me.
Bye.
message deleted.
and there are no poor people in heaven?
poor people?
everyone in heaven has a limo.
and who drives their limos?
all sorts of people.
especially foreigners without visas.
and the houses? How do the houses look?
have you ever been to the Sunshine Coast?
no.
well, you must.
it's something else.
and heaven?
exactly like the Sunshine Coast.
to be honest, that's a bit disappointing.
that's because you've never been there.
and the people? Are they lonely?
it's a real shame you don't have doughnuts.
the cookies aren't tasty?
tasty?
tasty? It's not a matter of taste.
it's a matter of volume.
do you want me to go get doughnuts?
no, I wouldn't want to impose. I'll go.
would you happen to have 5 bucks?
maybe 10. I'll get cigarettes, too.
and you'll be right back?
so help me God. - When will you be back?
in a while. I have some errands to run.
good deeds and such?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
next time you try to pull off something like this,
I'll see to it that you get fired.
come on, Sammy. The man was blind.
how could I take his TV?
fuck him! He's blind! He doesn't need a TV.
okay, man. My mistake.
Lenny, if you want to be a professional...
okay, I got it.
you know what your problem is? - Hi, Lenny.
who the fuck are you?
it's my brother.
you said he could come try out with us today.
Hi. I'm Dave. - Did I say that?
now, where does this loser live?
I hope it's not someone we know.
Hey, do you know where Marcus Portman lives?
do you have a light?
and a cigarette? - Huh?
give me a cigarette, and I'll tell you where he lives.
and if I didn't have cigarettes, you wouldn't tell me?
wow, you're the sharpest tool in the shed!
menthol? What are you? A woman? - Give it back!
Hey, hey, chill out, Sammy.
it's not worth it.
Yeah, Fatso. Listen to your friend.
Hey, kid, do you have a real cigarette?
sorry.
next time we meet, it'll be in your living room.
I'll repossess stuff you didn't even know you had.
I'll peel off your bathroom's ceramic, tile by tile, you hear?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, look, Sammy. Portman, 6B.
who is it?
shit, it's like smoking chewing gum.
am I right? - Mm?
do you know this man?
didn't I tell you not to talk to strangers?
are you listening?
and throw that away, Zack. It's dirty.
so, you got yourself in big trouble, huh?
not me. A friend. I cosigned his loan.
a cosigner?
man, you are in big trouble.
do you mind? - No, no, no. Help yourself.
Dave?
there's also fruit in the bottom drawer.
eat some. It'll make the fridge lighter on the way down.
Oh, that's very kind. I hadn't thought of that.
Oh, it's flat.
coke?
can't you see I'm working?
how many inches is the screen?
screen?
which screen? - The TV screen.
in the box in the living room.
22 inches, but you can't take it. It's not mine.
it's a gift for my father. He's turning 80.
did you buy it?
Yes, I did, but...
my friend, if you can't pay your debts, don't buy presents.
excuse me. It's Mr. Portman's dad's birthday.
shut up.
Lenny, how about you move your ass and start taking things down to the truck?
maybe you can get your dad a book about the meaning of life, instead.
I just ordered one.
they're not as expensive as you'd think.
can you please come with me to the living room?
what's this?
it's my magic trunk.
right! I knew you were familiar!
you're Marcus Pokus.
you were on that TV show with the curly-haired guy and the dog.
truly! Woof!
Oh, they're here. Thank you.
Hey! - Hey.
this isn't my microwave.
I bet yours is much nicer.
are you from Samson Movers?
sorry.
I can't believe how late they are.
Yeah. Never trust movers.
and repossessors?
we're always on time.
what do you think you're doing?
alla shazam!
alla shazoom!
Wow!
you bring that TV back right away, you hear?!
I've already made out a receipt for it!
what's your name? - Dave.
keep an eye on this creep. I'm going to the police.
if anything else disappears, write it down.
with the unicorn?
no, I haven't seen that one, but from the second I saw you,
I could tell that you were a supermodel.
I better call again...
...to find out where my stuff is.
can I have your number? - My number?
you don't even know my name.
I was gonna call you and ask you what your name is.
I want to see him laugh when his cellmate decides he needs a wife.
Hey, Sammy, have you met... ?
well, you'll have to call to find out.
come on. We're going to the police.
wait! Sammy!
Oh, mate, this is going to take us all day!
jeez, what's in this thing? - Buggered if I know.
Lenny!
wanna see a cool trick?
Drazan, I told you a thousand times...
fart torching is very dangerous.
no, no, something else.
that's a good one!
Shh.
Hello? - Hi, I'm calling about the car.
sorry. Wrong number.
Oh, sorry. Thanks.
you're welcome. Bye.
ha ha! You thought it was her.
don't be an ass.
fuck her! You got us.
here you go.
wish your dad a happy birthday for me.
Thanks.
Hey, Marcus!
alla shazam!
alla shazoom!
excuse me, do you know where Dave Peck lives?
I'm Dave.
sign here, please.
Thanks.
Wow.
Wow.
you know what this book is?
fuck off!
Thanks, Dad.
it's so simple.
dad, I read the book.
what book?
why are you back so early?
the book about the meaning of life.
what's so funny?
that people always think that there's just one meaning when actually there are six.
Dave... look at me.
did they fire you?
I don't think so.
maybe.
Why? What did you do?
nothing. I helped this guy from the sixth floor.
Mr. Pokus.
and that's why they fired you?
don't lie to me.
you know, the book says that people never lie.
it's just that sometimes reality...
stop that, all right? Stop it!
Where's Lenny?
I think he went to the police.
the police? Is he in trouble?
no, no. It's just that he went with his boss to press charges against Mr. Pokus.
Pokus? That's the guy you helped.
Yes.
Dave, did you do anything illegal? - Maybe.
maybe?!
no, it's nothing like that...
I don't think I wanna hear anymore.
but...
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm bored.
Why?
now that you've put the queens down, it's starting to get intriguing.
I'm depressed.
do you want a cup of tea?
I want something exciting to happen!
hello.
good evening.
I'm calling for Quick-Pulse Surveys.
do you have the time to answer a few questions for me?
go for it.
assuming there is no substantial price difference, would you prefer an ozone-safe product?
no.
are you in any way biased against cosmetic companies who experiment on animals?
no.
would you consider boycotting a company that operates sweatshops?
guess.
no?
Oh, baby, baby, you must be the quickest jumping-bean in the race.
thank you.
I just have two more questions.
I have a question for you.
if I stopped eating meat, would you hide my salami?
I'm feeling a little better.
who is it?
it's me. - Lenny!
what's your name, kid?
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to talk to strangers.
nice flowers, huh?
who are they for?
Oh, this model. First date.
model?
it's like a girl...
...only prettier.
Oh, Uni years are the best!
it's all downhill from there.
that's why you have to be extra careful not to graduate.
I never finished.
I'm missing a couple of courses.
I told you... he's the man!
first-year Engineering and... something else.
Engin-eer-ing.
we've got a mid-semester exam tomorrow.
we better go study.
Engin-eer-ing.
you'll be back tomorrow, right?
you bring the beer, we'll bring more beer.
no, I don't know what the meaning of life is, but whatever it is, it's not about getting your big brother into trouble.
I didn't...
sure, you didn't.
you should have seen Sammy with the cops.
he didn't even have the receipts to file charges.
and who had the receipts? - Listen, Lenny, you're...
look, I know you're a good person, but getting fucked over by a good person hurts just the same.
how can I stay mad at someone who makes such good cheesecake?
dad isn't talking to me.
he's been in the shower over an hour now.
don't worry.
one bite of this wonder cake, and he'll forgive you.
you're not gonna finish it?
I'm supposed to have dinner in 15 minutes.
how do I look? - Good.
good enough for a supermodel?
think positive.
okay, I'm leaving.
Hey, you can't go before you hear the meaning of life!
hear it?
I'm on my way to meet it.
it's 30 seconds to full time.
the Socceroos are trailing 3-4.
all eyes are to Soccer Jack.
he's stealing the ball, passing two defenders.
Jack is nearing the goal.
the crowd jumps to its feet!
will he do it?
time for bed, Zacky.
Hello?
good evening.
I'm calling for Quick-Pulse Surveys.
do you have the time to answer a few questions for me?
sure.
what is your current job?
I'm unemployed at the moment.
how would you define your current mood?
excellent, good, neutral, bad, or awful?
Oh...
I guess I'm okay.
okay?
so, I'm putting down "good.
is there a job you would prefer to your current job?
I'm unemployed.
right. I'm sorry.
what job would you like to have?
I wanted to work as a phone surveyor.
I said I was sorry. No need to be sarcastic.
no, really.
I had a job interview a couple of days ago.
but they said I wasn't qualified.
trust me, you wouldn't want this job.
but why?
I really like talking on the phone with people, asking them all sorts of questions.
what's your name?
Camille.
Hi, Camille. I'm Dave.
Camille...
can I ask you some more questions?
have you ever wondered about the meaning of life?
you're funny.
no, no, seriously.
I discovered it in a book.
it's very simple.
it all began with the very first molecule.
listen, I would love to hear it, but if my supervisor catches me having a personal call,
I'll get into trouble.
but it's far from being personal. It applies to everyone.
I guess, but I'm not sure she'll be able to make the distinction.
it was nice talking to you.
Bye.
Bye.
Ouch, ouch! Have mercy!
Helga wins! You lose.
another game?
no, I need time to mourn the old guy.
something to drink?
excellent idea.
Helga is a grand champion.
you must...
so, you don't believe in solids, huh?
I've been anorexic since childhood, but my contract with the agency prevents me from getting psychiatric help.
Really?
no.
Helga is a grand champion!
how do you like your steak?
well-done Steakhouse.
Hi, it's Tanita Sparks calling.
I'd like to order two Carnivore Supremes.
Lenny was here. He says hi.
he was on his way to a date.
want a piece of cheesecake to go with your coffee?
maybe later.
more wonderful books from our publisher...
tired of spending a fortune on plumbers?
now you can swim like a dolphin.

people won't listen to you?
your family, peers, and acquaintances don't understand you?

dad?
what?
nothing.
I'm sorry, Ishmael.
the steak...
what? - was overcooked.
I was looking for a flaw in our date.
it was almost perfect.
almost?
it's my fault.
my skin... it's very sensitive to... stubble.
do you have a razor?
ready for school?
good morning.
good morning.
great cake.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
it's not your fault.
maybe you were right.
you know, when I was in the army, my lieutenant used to say, " There's no such thing as a bad soldier, only a bad commander.
I guess the same goes for fathers.
and husbands. - Oh, Dad.
raising you and your brother after your mother left me wasn't easy.
but I'm not... I'm not looking for excuses.
you did a great job.
I look at you and your brother...
both single, one unemployed, the other...
I mean, I always say repossessing is a respectable job, but I wished higher for the both of you.
dad, you're not really looking at things from the right perspective.
life is not about... - Yeah, yeah. What can you do?
your dad is old and foolish and late for work.
I'll see you tonight.
go on.
this is my piggy bank.
I don't know his name yet.
every time after I drink my milk, I get money to put in his back.
he's nothing like my other toys. He's much calmer.
he doesn't have batteries, and you can't fill him with water.
well, you can, but it's not a good idea.
dad says he's educational because this way I won't grow up to be a thug, but I think the coolest thing about him is his smile.
look. I'll show you.
I put 50 cents in his back, and he smiles... like this!
I put 20 cents in, and look... he smiles exactly the same!
and now for the best part.
I'm putting no money in at all, and... he's still smiling!
Hey, Ron. Wait, wait!
do I know you?
Lenny... Jim Peck's son. You live right next door to my dad.
have a cookie!
all right.
Wow.
it does look weird.
but what are you gonna do?
my girlfriend, she, she likes me smooth.
you know what they say... without love, you're nothing.
you have a girlfriend?
fiance.
she's sexy? - She left me.
you know what they say...
good things never last.
hi there.
if I can't come to the phone, it means I'm somewhere wonderful, doing something really, really fun.
leave me a message, and I'll tell you all about it, unless it's something really...
did you hear that?
hear what?
how can you people stand living like this?
like how?
cooped up in these tiny flats, hearing what's going on with the neighbors.
this is a good-size apartment.
wait till you see the open luxurious spaces in heaven.
I don't mind small spaces, but do you think that I will get to see my wife there?
off the record, I don't think so.
but why?
I don't know.
my wife went 10 years before me.
and since then, I ate so much shit, I tell you...
but I did my best to be a good person.
I was sure she went to heaven.
I had to do everything I could to join her, and then instead of getting to see her, I got a pair of wings and some perspective.
it is somewhat small.
Somewhat? It's tighter than a sardine's asshole.
we can go up onto the roof if you want.
the view is nice.
I used to go up there with my wife to relax.
what are you...? What are you thinking about?
work.
you don't look like someone who's thinking about hauling a refrigerator.
you're thinking about me. - Yep, I was thinking about you.
what about me?
I don't have the words.
I thought you always had the words.
me too. - Let's start with the details, then.
what's your favorite part of my body?
your eyes.
that's corny! - It's true.
this isn't working.
God, this city is ugly!
what?
you've never been to heaven, have you?
can you believe it? They sent me straight here.
so, why did you say it was just like the Sunshine Coast?
because I've been to the Sunshine Coast.
on my honeymoon.
even their tap water smells nice. Not like this skin rash of a city.
but earlier you said it was nice up here.
earlier I had cucumbers on my eyes.
why don't you fly a little?
I bet it's very relaxing.
no.
people might see me.
come on.
I'd love to see you flying. Do it for me.
that's fine. I bet you can't fly, anyway.
sure I can.
I just don't want anybody to see me.
Oh, look there!
hmm?
so, what do you like about my eyes?
you were great in Show & Tell.
I wish I knew your name.
Kweller!
Oh!
I heard you breathing on my answering machine, you know.
you weren't home.
you were out at... great places doing all sorts of fun things.
that was just a message.
I'm really sorry.
I want to grow up.
don't.
you've been very helpful, Sir.
can I go now?
sure. You had a rough day.
Hey, buddy, can you spare some change?
go on, mate.
Oh, good on you, Bill.
Hey, wait! It's too much!
where are you going?
your driver's license...
excuse me, Officer. - Yes, Sir.
I want to confess to the murder of...
murder?
wow, I don't even know his name.
the angel?
that's the thing. He wasn't really an angel.
he was just a liar with wings. - Whichever.
he fell from the sky. Case closed.
I pushed him.
sir, I've seen it a hundred times before.
whenever there's a corpse, someone always feels guilty.
but I am guilty!
are you a believer, Sir?
Yes.
I'm sure that God forgives you. Have a good night.
careful, Kweller!
you ready for bed?
Ah, what are you drawing?
that's you, me, and Mom on a boat trip.
that's nice.
dad, you're making Kweller nauseous.
he's not making any noise, Zacky.
you know what that means?
tomorrow you'll get your Soccer Jack action figure.
that's great, Dad.
just put Kweller down.
you're making him feel bad.
the big moment has arrived, Zacky.
are you excited?
sure.
but what's the hammer for?
well, it's for you. Just be careful.
Zack?
I'm careful, Dad.
well, break the pig open. - Kweller?!
Kweller?
Yeah. Go on. Break it.
you deserve the doll. You worked hard enough for it.
I don't want Soccer Jack.
Kweller is good enough.
you don't understand.
it's really okay. It's educational.
come on. I'll break it for you.
dad!
Yes, Zacky?
50 cents tomorrow to put in his back, after the milk, and then we break him.
tomorrow.
another 50 cents.
for a rainy day.
Yes.
a rainy day.
Hey, you've reached Lenny's mobile.
Yeah, the brand-new, shiny model with the car-gadget thing, so eat your heart out...
Hey, it's Dave.
it's after 8: 00, and Dad isn't back from work yet.
it's probably nothing.
I bet he'll show up soon.
okay, give me a call when you get this.
Bye.
someone left you a message.
Uh-huh.
what if it's important?
it's not.
I love touching you.
just like a baby's bottom.
what?
nothing.
your eyelash.
then, make a wish.
Lenny?
Lenny, where are you?
I'm in the bathroom.
don't worry, Kweller.
it's only a tiny jump.
we'll do it on the count of three.
one...
three!
Bye, Kweller.
pigs love parks, especially ones with lakes.
you'll be happy here.
dad?
a package for Dave Peck.
Thanks.
there you go. - Thanks.
have a nice day.
dear Valued Customer,
unfortunately, we are going out of business.
consequently, the book you've ordered,
how to Make People Listen, has been out of print for a while.
we're reimbursing you $9. 99
and sending you a copy of another of our wonderful books.
swim Like A Dolphin?
Mr. Kweller, let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you.
where are you going?
I'm going to the Sunshine Coast.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
are you going to meet someone there?
maybe. Is everything okay with you?
my dad's missing.
Ah, I saw him yesterday evening.
he gave his wallet to a homeless man.
did you see where he went?
towards the park.
dad!
Hi, Dave.
come sit next to your dad.
feed the ducks.
you were here all night?
no, no, no. It was too cold.
I slept in a tool shed, and in the morning the gardener came.
he gave me some bread.
are you okay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I remember once your mom and I went to the park to feed the ducks.
it was so much fun.
and now I don't feel a damn thing.
well, maybe the ducks... - It's not the ducks.
it's everything.
you know, my office... 30 years, no windows.
I know life is supposed to be full of joy and sorrow.
it's just that the joy part...
don't say that.
let's just do something fun.
like what? - Anything!
there are a million fun things to do!
name one.
Oh, Smoothies.
take the edges out of your life with Dr. Nabotny's revolutionary...
bone...
removal system.
this almost painless technique will smooth...
painless? Ha!
I wouldn't say painless.
you're such a ninny, Max.
you're a tough motherfucker now, but I bet when they took out your ribcage, you cried like a baby.
the skull is the worst.
they pull it through one of the nostrils, you know.
no, I didn't realize that, no.
if you're stressing out about the nostril bit and you're not a cheap, whiny wuss, you can pay a little extra, and they just zap it out with a laser.
hmm. - Yeah?
but even with the laser and everything, why would anyone want to do that?
love.
back and forth, like a whip through the water.
Aw, son...
I don't think it's working.
no, Dad, I think you just need to loosen your knees and breathe through the nose.
come on. Try it.
don't you have in one of these books of yours something a little less physical?
Yeah, well, I have the one on the meaning of life.
I can read from it for you.
Oh.
breathe through the nose.
wings? - Yes!
but he fell like a ton of bricks.
you would think someone with wings wouldn't have that problem.
you don't believe me?
hon, can you get the cheese?
Oh, yeah. Those little matchboxes where you kept your eye drops fell when I took the butter out.
so I threw them away. - What, the beers?
no, not the beers, silly.
the bottles you kept in the... - All three cases?
Aargh!
the guys will kill me. - Which guys will kill you?
they were imported from Belgium.
Ron, I'm sure they weren't beers.
they were eye drops. - How do you know?!
did you taste them?
Ron, have you been smoking pot again?
one small joint.
a really... really small joint.
all three cases?
Yup.
and she really called you "a delusional fucker" ?
I've never seen her that angry. - One expensive lay.
I hope it was worth it.
fuck the beers. At least now she's gone for good.
it calls for a party.
hey D. J. put something good on!
Ooh, hmm.
Whoo!
Oh, did you see that? - Yeah!
that wasn't bad!
Hi. - Hi.
I missed you.
we have a son together.
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.
if we're gonna be together... - wait. You want to be with me here?
you're kind of an amazing kiss .
I'm a cop, you dumbass!
I want back on the lacrosse team, Mr. Matthews.
I'm gonna have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence.
this is my job, harry. What are the students gonna think?
Jason broke up with me. My boyfriend from back home.
I don't think we can be friends if you're with Ethan.
I don't want to keep us a secret anymore, Ethan.
guys, guys, I heard they met over the summer.
Yeah, she's hot. I would definitely hit that.
her? What about him?
he's actually cute, in a... just-walked-off-a-catalogue kind of way.
they know? How do they all know?
didn't you get the text blast from George?
George? I blocked his number in eighth grade.
look at that - What's up, everybody -Dude, that's nuts.
when did this happen? - After Silver's party.
how much did you see?
I want details you - Dorks can't handle the details.
Oh, my god. George, you are so pathetic.
why don't you go back to rehab?
all right, people. Let's settle.
everybody take their seat. - So, Mr. Matthews has taken A... - Student's virginity?
leave of absence till we find a suitable substitute, I am your new teacher.
I understand we are working on Madame Bovary.
anybody want to tell me where we are? Anybody? Has she tried to kill herself yet?
Oh, God. Are you serious?
what? Are you serious?
um, when did this become the new principal's office?
Annie, thank you for joining us.
take your seat, so we can get started.
Annie. - Yeah?
you and me have to chat after school, okay? - Okay.
okay, then, Madame -- Right, it looks like we are on part three - I thought you were coming back tomorrow. - Uh, I took an earlier flight.
how are you? - Good.
aren't you supposed to be in class?
I have last period study hall.
and you're studying...
the hallway architecture. Thought it'd be a great art piece.
you know, the labyrinthine nature of the high school experience.
so? How was it? How's Dylan?
here, hold this for me.
well, Dylan is Dylan. You know, nothing's changed.
same cheekbones, same sideburns, same perfectly messy hairdo,and same cmitment issues.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
how are you doing? - Actually, really good.
I'm okay with him being there and me being here.
just gonna leave myself in to all possibilities, you know look at you with your advanced self-understanding. - I'm impressed. - Don't be.
I'm still a work in progress.
Hey, I saw that Harry was teaching Ryan's class. Is he out sick or something?
Yeah. Um, you missed some stuff when you were go.
Mr. Matthews, what do you say about the allegations?
no comment.
sir, I'd just like to hear your side of the story.
Navid, I respect your perseverance. okay, I really but I said no comment, and I meant it.
now go back to class before I break your camera.
I'm sure that's not the best way to rehabilitate your image, sir.
Navid, you want to give me a brief quiet, turn that thing off
Ryan... it isn't true, is it?
it's complicated.
no, it either is true or it is the guy I knew before I left wouldn't do something like this.
I just want you to tell me the truth. I don't want to believe the rumors.
why are you just running away like this?
I don't know what else I can say. Sorry.
so Dixon tells me you're rockin' the karaoke at your birthday party. I'm so gonna make him sing.
cool. Whatever.
yo, what's you doing - Nothing.
nothing. I'm just... I'm supposed to meet Naomi, so...
chill. She doesn't know anything about you and Ethan.
you know? How do you know?
I saw you guys at my party.
Naomi was going to walk in on you and the jock strap, but I distracted her. You're welcome, by the way.
wait, wait, wait, how do you know that she didn't. Because you're still alive.
you got to tell her soon.
I mean if she finds out from some random, it ain't gonna be pretty.
um, Naomi, I...
I'm a mess. I'm sorry.
my parents... my mom filed the divorce papers today.
it's official. -- I come from a broken home.
um, I'm so sorry.
my parents throw in the towel, my relationship with Ethan is over.
I swear to god, if I get another piece of bad, and I'm going to lose it.
I'm going to really lose
is there anything that I can do at least I could use the support of my friends right you guys feel like hitting up Robertson this afternoon.
I actually have to go blog about professor pervert, you know, but...
maybe some other time? - Later.
how about you, Annie?
get our hairs did, followed by some retail therapy?
sure, ok. - thank you.
you really are a good friend.
Hey, girly.
poker game at Meaghan's house tonight. Are you in?
Oh, sounds like fun.
Oh, that's cute in a Hannah Montana on acid kind of so 16, huh?
God, you've had an intense year.
Oh, it's been a seriously crazy, new world, new school, new friends - No boyfriend.
Yeah. I have to talk to you about...
that's a really hard thing. Trust me, I know.
I mean, since I broke up with Ethan, I've been so lonely.
what were you saying?
I really don't like this dress.
so, did you break up with Jason before you left wizard of ox ?
no, after I got here.
Oh, were you the dumper or the dumpee?
it was mutual. I mean, you can't fight geography, right?
that's too bad.
sounds like you guys didn't really get a chance to see what would have happened.
I mean, maybe you'd still be together if you hadn't moved out here.
maybe.
I don't know, part of me felt like the break up wasn't real, you know?
when things end because of distance and not because of some big relationship problem it's kind of hard to get closure.
be great if you could get closure and maybe see him again, yeah, I guess.
that's the dress.
that's the dress you should wear to the birthday you'll never forget. Guess who?
soft hands...
velvet voice...
Oh, my god! So...
I've been thinking. - About?
about you and me. And the fact that we are an "us" now.
"us"? That is my new favorite word.
we should do something together. Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.
What'd you have in mind? Like lunch? maybe a movie?
I was thinking maybe something a little bit more private.
well, uh... That's... that's really not going to work.
why not?
I have a lot of footage to edit. And, uh, it's about Mr. Matthews. It's, it's a really, really big story.
Oh, well, then I'll help you.
that way we can be hanging out together.
well, the only thing is, um... I can't have anybody else around when I'm doing this.
I kind of need to focus.
okay, so I should just go, then?
I'll call you later, right? - Okay, yeah.
Thanks. - Have fun.
Matthews dips in the kiddie pool?
I think it's my best blog yet.
and I love it when my readers quote it back to me.
you're just biased against Matthews 'cause he dated your sister.
well, yeah. It's like, what if Ethan rebounded with someone from junior high?
why do I care who Ethan dates?
it's not like he's with...
Ethan's with Annie?
Yes, but Dixon, I'm the only one that knows.
you cannot tell her that you know or she'll think that I told you, you know?
and besides, they haven't told Naomi yet, and if she hears from somebody else...
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ethan, so I was thinking...
I don't know what you're getting Annie for her birthday, but let's make sure she has an amazing day, okay?
I don't want to give her a chance to miss Jason.
uh, why would she? They're broken up.
Yeah, but it sounds like Jason's a really great guy, and they were really close, kind of like you and me, so...
Yeah, she seems to be doing okay.
Yeah, that's what i thought until yesterday.
what happened yesterday?
we were shopping, and she could not stop talking about jason.
I guess because the breakup was long-distance, they just didn't get closure. i don't know.
I just don't want her to feel alone on her 16th birthday, so let's make it extra special, yeah?
cool.
Yeah, you gave me the facts this morning, but did you really have to fire him?
I had no choice.
did he admit anything? -it doesn't matter what he said.
how could it not matter? it's his reputation on the line.
Kelly, allegations were made. as principal, i had to act on them.
you're telling me that you believe that ryan slept with a student?
I can't get into this right now, kelly. you have to trust me.
uh, is this a bad time? i can come back later.
no. kimberly, i was just...leaving hi, kimberly, nice to meet you. please sit down.
apparently, i'm not allowed back into any more classes until you sign this.
uh, yes, i wanted to talk to you. please sit down.
if this is about mr. matthews, i'm fine. everything's fine.
an aura of fineness surrounds me. -i'm glad to hear that.
but, given the situation i have trouble believing that you're really okay.
that's your problem, not mine.
are you angry at mr. matthews?
did he give you a bad grade, maybe fail you on some test? -no.
were you in a relationship with him?
why are you asking me? i had nothing to do with this.
maybe you expressed some feelings that he didn't return.
sounds like you're speaking from your own experience.
I mean, it would be understandable.
everybody in your class loves him. he's young, dynamic, not unattractive.
okay, i don't want to talk about this anymore.
can i go?
if i'm late for mr. hunt's class one more time, i'll be in detention for life.
come back if you want to talk some more.
hello.
Hello?
yoo-hoo, annie!
boy, do we have a surprise for you. -hey, guys.
Annie, you will never guess who's here.
Jason hi, annie.
you could crush mint on those abs.
happy birthday.
jason...in california. right here in our pool.
um, what are you doing here?
I was hoping to meet lauren conrad.
are these the right hills?
I would hug you, but i wouldn't want to get you all wet.
I wouldn't mind. -tabitha.
surprise!
what a surprise it is.
do you like your birthday present?
he's from you? you're from her?
no, i'm from kansas, but naomi paid for the shipping labels.
your sweet 16 birthday is the most important day of your life, second only to your wedding day, of course.
and no girl should spend that day without a man by her side.
Yeah, but...
I-I told her that we weren't together, but when she called, i just couldn't resist a chance to be with you on your big day.
well, it's all right, it's very good to see you.
well, i'm gonna get going. i know you guys must have a ton to catch up on before dinner.
dinner?
Yeah. i figured you would want jason to meet all of your friends, you know, before the big day and everything.
you and silver are in, right? i have to call ethan.
I think that's about it. i'll take care of everything. don't you worry about a thing.
you are so lucky to have made such great friends here.
Yeah. so lucky.
Adrianna. hi.
Hello, half of navid's face. is the other half home?
it's not a good time.
well, then when is?
I've called you a couple of times. i've texted you.
tried to hook up at school.
you've gone all woodward and bernstein 'cause of this whole matthews story.
can we talk about this later, please?
no, we can't. you've been acting really weird lately.
wait.
is... is there someone there?
Yeah.
my baby sister iman.
Adrianna, uh...
iman, this is adrianna. -hi, sweetie.
Navid. is this the young lady you told us about?
welcome, adrianna.
we've heard wonderful things about you.
come on in. please, please.
dad, no farsi, okay?
she's pretty, navid. way too pretty for you.
please don't embarrass me. keep your voice down, okay?
Adrianna, it's so wonderful to meet you!
come in, come in. will you join us for dinner?
Oh, mom, i think adrianna already has plans.
Yeah. i wouldn't want to impose.
Oh, nonsense. you have to meet atoosa's family.
this is shah-lah and masood. -nice to meet you.
my cousin alex and my beautiful daughter shar-joon.
hello.
Hi. i'm adrianna. -anoosh, his cousin.
Oh, just shoot me now. -my brother-in-law iraj and his wife roza.
you hanging in there?
Oh, you know. just, uh...walking roxy.
nobody else wants to be around me right now, so...
I'd be there if i could. -roxy, come here.
but i guess i screwed that up for both of us for a while.
I really didn't think it was going to turn out like this.
I mean, i didn't... i didn't think.
maybe i deserve it. -no, you don't.
in a moment of extreme masochism, i decided to read silver's blog.
you want to know the worst part, aside from the grammar?
these kids...
they think i'm a sleazeball. they really do.
you know the truth. that's what matters.
I don't know how you do it.
how you spend your life letting people think you're something you're not.
look, ryan, i know you've risked a lot for me.
I swear to you, i'm going to close this case as fast as i can.
then everything will be back to normal.
I'll be around.
do you guys always eat dinner like this?
no. not usually this small.
can i tempt you with some more khoresht?
dad, please. she's had enough. -no, thanks.
I couldn't possibly eat any more. i'm stuffed.
but you're so small! you need to put some meat on your bones!
thank you.
so, navid, why didn't you tell me you play the drums?
or the doumbek? right?
Oh, and he sings, too. -what?
Oh, yes. -really?
when he was little, he'd sing all day long.
please tell me you have pictures.
better. we have video.
you wouldn't want to see them because they're poorly edited, and you'd be wasting your time.
honey, he's right.
what are we thinking, talking about movies in front of such a talented actress?
we should be asking you for details of your exciting childhood.
more importantly, adrianna, how are you doing since leaving rehab?
mom.
it's fine.
I know that must have been very difficult for you.
I'm great. i'm fine. really.
thank you.
mom-mom, do you happen to have any dessert? maybe something to tempt ade with?
of course, of course. lydia?
bring the desserts, please.
I'm sorry. -it's okay.
I will have an iced tea and the Japanese pear salad with tiger prawns dressing on the side.
always.
those little details, you never seem to forget, do you?
I still remember the way Ethan takes his coffee.
you guys dated? - Yeah, for a long time.
we managed to stay friends like you and Annie.
of course I stayed friends with Annie.
I mean, it's not just any girl whose idea of having a good time is sneaking into a jayhawks game.
Hey, just that once.
I thought security was going to throw us out on our asses but she managed to sweet-talk the guard into letting us stay
by saying that I was a foreign exchange student that was leaving in the morning.
true story.
seems like the silliest moments between couples are the ones that linger the longest.
so, Jason, is this your first time to California?
Yes, but, hopefully, not the last. I'm actually thinking about going to UCLA.
you would be in L.A.
Yeah. I'm going to check out the campus while I'm here.
just like we talked about.
that was a long time ago.
don't you have two more years before college? What's the rush?
I thought I told you. I'm a senior.
I need to decide soon.
Yeah, UCLA is almost impossible to get into, though, dude.
I mean, you have some backup schools lined up?
Jason is top of the class, all-state football.
ucla is his...
backup school - You're smart, handsome and athletic.
distance wouldn't be enough for me to let go of this one.
I'm parched. I'm just going to go check on that iced tea.
so, more details.
how long have you known Annie? - Since grade school.
we lived right around the block from each other.
seems like our lives always seemed to cross.
that is so sweet!
I got to go to the bathroom. Excuse me, please.
so, uh, anything new back home?
I know. I'm sorry.
Naomi planned this whole dinner before I knew anything about it.
I thought you weren't even in contact with Jason anymore.
I haven't been since we broke up.
did you guys actually break up or just take a break?
we broke up cross my heart. I was there.
then why is he considering colleges based on where you live?
look, we started dating in junior high.
Jason probably just assumed that we'd always be together.
and maybe because of the fact that we broke up on the phone, he didn't get enough closure.
Yeah, so I've heard. did you get enough closure?
Ethan, I want to be with you, nobody else.
then I think you should tell him about us.
I don't want to hurt him.
and he's only here for a couple of days and then he's gone. Why make him feel bad?
because I want him to know that we're together.
and I wanted Naomi to know the same thing, but you didn't want to upset her.
how is that different?
Hey, is everything okay? - Yeah, great.
good, well, your iced tea has arrived, so you don't have to really wait here for it anymore.
great.
you are becoming one of my all-time favorite customers.
Aw, aren't you sweet?
you're under arrest for drug possession with the intention to sell.
you gotta be kidding me.
come on. after all those times I hooked you up?
just can't trust anyone these days.
so do you want to do the ten years I can nail you on right now,
or do you want to vouch me to your boss?
give me a sit-down and let him know how I'm your newest dealer?
fancy meeting you here.
I know, nine bedrooms in the house and I still have to share a bathroom with Dixon.
Oh, poor Dixon, 'cause as I recall, you were never really good at sharing.
Hey, only where French fries are concerned.
you know, this isn't how I pictured us on the eve of your 16th birthday, but I'm glad I'm here.
it was nice of you to come.
Yeah, but weird, too.
Yeah, right? - Yeah.
I'm, I'm sorry. Does that mean...?
no, not at all. Actually, it's exactly what every ex-boyfriend / houseguest want to hear.
well, you know, even with all the weirdness,
I'm just glad to have someone to hang out with who doesn't make me feel like I have to try so hard.
what do you mean?
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just I feel like I need to be so on all the time.
I mean, if they saw me hanging out in plaid pajamas, It'd be, like,"ooh, social suicide"
I'd forgotten how much fun you were to be around, Annie.
you're sweet.
you know what? That's a lie.
I didn't forget. I tried.
believe me, I tried.
but Annie, our relationship...
it was something special.
yo, Jason, Come on! let's go!
Hey, come on. I already set the game up.
we're battling some dudes from Michigan, and they already talking trash.
come on, man. let's do this.
good night.
Jason, can I get you anything else? - No, ma'am, thank you.
you know, when you're at UCLA, you should really come by and see us. - Absolutely.
now, do you need any recommendations? I'd be happy to write you one.
there is the birthday girl!
happy birthday. - Thank you.
I cannot believe that you are 16 years old.
okay, I am late for a photo shoot. Happy birthday.
good-bye, my love. Bye, sweetie.
Bye, Jason.
I got an early meeting as well. Happy birthday.
love you, too, baby. Nice to see you.
good luck on your tour. -Thank you, thank you.
uh, what are you gonna do, one of those star homes tours?
campus tour, UCLA.
if we're living close to each other again. Maybe things might work out a little different for us.
um, Jason, Um, I mean, who knows if we'd still be together if I hadn't moved?
maybe, Sure.
but we broke up, and I moved on.
so we're really over. - Yeah.
what about the kiss? I...
you totally took me by surprise.
and I am so sorry if I misled you in any way.
okay.
maybe I'll just go home.
no, please, Don't. stay.
I mean, the truth is, we were friends for a long time before we started dating, and I want all my friends at my party tonight.
so, come on. you can't deny a girl's birthday wish, right?
I'm sorry. I was awkward last night.
no, no, no, I'm sorry.
my mom had no right to bring up that whole rehab thing.
Yeah, she did. your parents paid for it.
but it's bad enough that they had to bore you with those stupid stories.
it was cute.
but how many servings of khoresht Do they expect one person to eat, right?
see, this, this is exactly why I didn't want you to meet my family because they can be lame at times.
well, actually, I thought they were lovely.
you're just saying that to be nice.
no, seriously, I wish my family was that big and close.
yeah?
so, yeah, obviously, I was a little embarrassed when your mom brought up the whole rehab thing.
but the fact that they knew the entire time,
and they still treated me like a member of the family.
that was incredibly cool.
so we are good.
I like you, Navid, okay? And the more I know, the more I like.
you just have to be honest with me.
about everything?
everything.
can you do that?
I'm a virgin. - What?
What?! - See, funny, right?
I didn't want to disappoint you, okay? 'Cause I figured you'd bolt, so, uh...
so you've been keeping your distance. - Yeah.
I wanted, I wanted it to be special.
I thought you expected something different, and you are so...
I'm not expecting anything.
no? - No.
except, um, A little less of that, um -- What's your mom's favorite dish?
Khoresht. -Khore, khore...
I can't say it! -Back of the throat.
Khoresht. Khoresht.
you got it.
Hey, Annie.
so, Jason seems like a pretty awesome guy.
he's clearly still into you.
maybe you guys should give it another shot.
Yeah, um, Naomi, about that, thank you so much for flying Jason in.
Hey, let's go out again tonight. It was so much fun last night.
we can go to the beach, maybe surfing.
let me get back to you on that.
Hey, are you still mad about last night?
define mad.
look, I know the whole having my current boyfriend go to dinner with my ex-boyfriend
when my current boyfriend isn't really a boyfriend at all. Thing is beyond the charts strange, but...
no, what's strange is being in a situation that's so complicated that we can't even tell people we're together.
does that make you happy? - No.
me, either.
I've done complicated, Jnnie, I didn't like it.
I want things between us to be simple, you know?
I want that, too.
great, then let's clean this whole mess up and tell Naomi and Jason the truth.
what?
I just, I just want to wait until Jason gets home to tell him.
Why? You don't still have feelings for him...
no, no.
um, no, but I think he still has them for me.
okay, don't freak out, but Jason kissed me last night.
perfect, yeah.
come on, Ethan. It just happened.
you know why? ' Cause he thinks you're still available.
I didn't kiss him back.
that was big of you. Have fun with Jason.
I never thought my star detention guest could be on time for anything.
only when it's important. This is important.
you know, you seem like a good kid.
seriously, dude, I don't want to hear it.
all I want to do is make some cash. - Get a job at Starbucks.
look, if you're not sure about me, then just say it.
Eric said he'd vouch for me and that you'd hook me up.
but if you bailed, then tell me now 'cause I got clients waiting.
you have no idea how long I've waited for this.
it takes a special kind of sleazebag to sell drugs to kids.
you're under arrest.
hands where we can see them.
thank you. No, no, seriously, thank you, Annie.
happy birthday. You're the best.
thank you, thank you, everyone for being here to celebrate my darling Annie's sweet 16.
Annie, I know this isn't the ordinary birthday dedication, but you're not ordinary girl.
that's why I love you.
Oh, my god, she is so amazing.
Oh, I know, right? She's totally rocking it.
Annie, I told you we should have gone first.
now we're going to get a vocal beat-down by grandma Wilson.
let's go find a song.
we'll be back. - We're gonna go make out.
darling. Karaoke...a surprising smash, Kansas.
so where's Ethan?
he must be running late, I guess.
you should call him. -No. um, don't worry about it.
gee, you'd think he'd be here.
okay, where is Ethan, anyway?
um, he might not be coming. We got in a bit of a fight.
but it's your birthday. - Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna go get some air.
don't you have a party inside?
I'm not really in the partying mood.
listen, I'm... really sorry, Annie.
you were nothing but honest with me about that kiss, and...
I was a jerk.
I would have gone with jackass, but okay.
the truth is, I had no right to get mad at you when I was the one who got us into this whole mess
by saying that we should keep Naomi in the dark.
Yeah, well, you didn't do it alone.
I tried to tell her a bunch of times and just totally chickened out.
and I guess I didn't have to hook up with you the minute you were on the rebound.
that's true. But I am glad you did.
there is going to be a cake soon, and on it, there will be 16 candles for me to blow out.
and my only wish is to be with you without all these secrets.
that's what I want, too.
Jason told Dixon he's going to leave on the red-eye tonight back to Kansas city.
so I kind of wanted to tell him the truth before he's gone.
and Naomi, too. - Okay.
happy birthday.
is it the pentapus?
so much for the element of surprise.
well, you know what, I'm kind of over surprises, so...
well, then I should probably just tell you that I'm about to kiss you.
you have to see this. Come here.
she really has moved on.
Annie swore to me that they weren't together. I can't believe she would lie like that.
I just... I can't believe...
I'm sorry.
looks like I caught you on your way out... of town.
what are, what are you doing here?
Harry called me.
so you know I'm not the devil.
I never thought that.
are you sure? 'Cause most people did.
so where are you headed? - Honestly, I don't know.
I'm just going to go to lax and let the fates decide.
Ryan, this will all blow over, you know that, right?
your real story will be in the paper. It'll be all over the news.
and you can go back to teaching.
I just need to get away, you know, take some time and clear my head.
you know, get out of town and figure out what I'm doing.
but thanks for stopping by. It was good seeing you.
maybe when you get back, we can get together.
kimberly, hey. - Hey, Kelly.
I can call you Kelly, right? - Yeah, of course.
am I interrupting something? - No, no. I was just leaving.
have a nice trip. - Thanks.
how are you doing? - I'm good.
do you think Naomi's up here? - Jared saw her go upstairs.
Oh, my god.
I...I... I can't believe this. How could you do this to me?
how could you do it to me is the question, Annie.
I saw you making out with Ethan at school.
wait, you...you knew they were together?
so, I just figured. Hey, if my good friend Annie, who I specifically asked not to date Ethan,
could make out with my ex. What's stopping me from fooling around with hers?
payback's a real bitch, isn't it?
An-Annie, wait!
you pathetic bitch.
after this, my mother's going to do her big closing number.
I think we should pull the plug on karaoke, and get out the cake.
Oh, but the kids really seem to be enjoying her. I mean, how bad could it be?
I think that it involves pasties.
I'll get the birthday girl.
I'm sorry, but I saw you and Ethan outside kissing, and it just freaked me out a little bit.
I mean, you could have told me that you guys were together.
why'd you hide that? - I...
I didn't want to hurt you.
so instead you played Naomi's game?
the girl that I knew back in Kansas was above that.
you don't understand, okay? The rules are different here.
but that doesn't mean you have to be.
I get to the airport.
I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday.
all right, everybody. Nicely done.
time to sing to the birthday girl.
sweetie, are you okay?
you... outside now!
any requests?
just so I am clear. Everything you have done-- the whole shopping trip,
flying Jason out here, all of that was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?
Absolutely. But if you want Ethan, you can have him.
I wanted to see you miserable and I got my wish. - That's sick.
Oh, don't give me that holier-than-thou routine. You're no innocent here.
okay, I should have told you about Ethan. I will grant you that.
I wanted to tell you. - But you didn't, did you?
no, instead you tried to play me for a fool. You backstabbing, duplicitous bitch!
okay, I was trying to spare your feelings!
I knew you would be upset, and so I was trying to find the right time.
but you didn't even like Jason, you just went after him to hurt me.
you deserved it.
I am so sick and tired of all you people who won't tell me the truth.
first it was my dad and his mistress, And then my mother with her son...
none of that was my fault.
all I know is that before you moved here, my life was perfectly fine!
no, before I moved here, you were just lying to yourself and getting away with it.
you'd rather have people fear you then be honest with you.
you're manipulative and cruel and the only person that you should be blaming for feeling so alone right now is you.
that all you got, Kansas?
listen to me.
being your friend -- I'm over it.
I already beat you to it. - Excuse me.
sorry to bother you ladies.
who are you? - Who are you?
my name's Sean. I'm the son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark.
your father called us yesterday.
my stepdad.
he requested your records.
he's looking at military schools.
I'm in a bit of a pinch financially.
I went through a lot of money very quickly.
I'm glad to help.
I got, like, 20 cases of beer and topher's brother brought over vodka, gin, whisky, bourbon.
thank you, Phoebe Abrams.
I am really stoked about the afterprom party at Phoebe Abrams's house tonight.
I will be there with the Beverly Hills police department.
who the hell told him?
I know who it was.
why did you tell your dad about my party?
is that what everyone thinks?
they don't think.
they know.
you're a rat.
the sophomore prom queen is Erin Silver.
I don't know exactly who I am.
but I do know who I am not.
some weird zombie prom-loving loser.
why did you get me this corsage?
you looked in my facebook page, didn't you?
you like me.
dude, I'm so sick of looking at you.
y water just broke.
I think I'm going into labor.
so, anyway, his dad left when he was a kid.
it was just Liam and his mom against the world.
she was a housekeeper for this billionaire family out in long island.
whatever. Long story short.
last year, Liam walked in on the billionaire screwing his mom.
Oh, how awful.
I know. Right?
then she marries the guy.
turns out he's a complete son of a bitch.
I mean, no wonder Liam has trust issues.
are you listening to me?
Absolutely.
Liam sounds great.
you had me at trust issues.
no, Jen.
you don't get it.
tonight, everything changed.
everything.
well, honey, that's great.
total emergency.
not only has my party been ruined, thanks to principal loser, but now nobody's stepping up and they're.
uh, and that's a good thing since after proms are highly illegal and will lead to suspension, which will lead to missing finals, which will lead to summer school.
did you fall on your head?
what?
Jen's not a grown-up.
she's my sister.
Jen, Phoebe.
Phoebe, Jen.
Hey.
um, Jake Manditsky said that he could have the party at his house, but then his parents said at the last second that they're not going to their beach house and now.
well, there's no parents at my house.
I'll throw it.
I don't think so.
sweetie, I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm going to have a bunch of high school kids trashing my house, spilling beer all over my furniture and vomit wine coolers on my rugs.
it's actually my furniture and they're my rugs since I'm paying for everything.
what's that supposed to mean?
in fact, since I'm the only one paying rent, it's actually my house.
if I feel like throwing a party at my house,
I'm going to throw a party at my house.
but you are more than welcome to come.
you don't want to do this, Naomi.
so. Let's do it!
afterprom party at my house.
spread the word.
party at 174 west hollybrook.
party at my house tonight.
keep it on the D. L.
Benedict Annie is right there.
drop it, Penelope.
Annie's not the one who told.
don't worry about her or them.
I like that wrap, by the way.
you look really good tonight.
I mean, like a model-- a really, really short model, like, a regular model standing in the distance-- but you look good.
well, thank you, Naomi.
Oh, my god.
everyone who's anyone is going to be at my party tonight.
Oh, my god.
what?
ade just went into labor.
Oh, my god.
Oh, I have to get to the hospital.
Yeah.
please, you have to take care of my house.
you have to be the hostess.
make sure that nobody vomits wine coolers on the rugs, okay?
Absolutely. Don't worry.
thank you so much.
okay, got to go.
go.
go, go, go.
Oh, is this it?
no, wait.
ours had different rims than this one.
man, is it just me, or do most limos look very similar?
we'll find it.
eventually.
yo, congratulations, prom king.
Thanks.
Dixon, why do you have to be like that?
you can be enjoying the fact that you won.
whatever.
what does that mean?
nothing.
it's just hard to enjoy something when your girlfriend thinks it's stupid.
guys, guys!
Adrianna is having her baby.
now?
Yeah.
Navid is with her and Naomi is going to meet her at the hospital.
we've got to get to Naomi's 'cae I promised that I would take care of her house, and there's, like, 200 people on their way there now.
we got to hurry, guys.
all right, but the only problem is someone stole our limo.
Navid and Adrianna probably took it.
can we get a ride, man?
Yeah, no problem, man.
hop aboard the white stallion.
you are the man, D.
wait!
she's coming?
I don't want that rat in our limo.
Phoebe, I swear I didn't tell anyone about your party, okay?
I swear.
come on, Pheebs, be a sport.
they need a lift.
Yeah, if you could just drive me to my house, I could get my car.
it would be so great.
fine.
just don't talk to me or look at me.
honestly, phoebe? - You're talking and looking.
thank you.
sorry I have to abandon you.
I mean, on prom night and everything.
don't worry about it.
I'll see you later tonight.
you'll go to the party?
well, it's your party.
of course I'm going.
you know what's crazy?
what's that?
my mom has been sending me to this therapist for months now.
this chick costs $200 an hour, and I've barely said five words to her.
I spend one night with you,
I end up telling you my whole life story.
well, 500 bucks, we'll call it even.
this probably goes without saying, but that stuff that I said-- that was private.
of course.
doctor-patient confidentiality.
cool.
come on, man.
move the car.
Oh, finally.
Oh, my lord!
that is just crazy talk. - Excuse me?
Yeah, I thought so.
I told Karen I thought so.
ma'am, this is pretty urgent.
what's the matter, kid?
you get in a fight on prom night?
well, I feel your pain, but it's not urgent, okay?
so take a seat and I'll get to you when I get to you.
anyway.
what? - She said I never said a word to her, which is ridiculous.
cause I can remember the exact second I told her.
Oh, my god, Navid, what is taking so long?
my girlfriend is having a baby!
she's having a baby?
Yes, she's having a baby.
Yeah, I am having a baby.
I am going sprinkles, heath bar, chocolate chips, chocolate fudge, yogurt- covered raisins on top.
diabetic coma.
you think I should lose the yogurt raisins?
Yeah, that's the problem.
who knew you were such a sugar fiend?
what can I say?
it's the only vice I have left.
left, really?
what vices did you have?
a huge barbecue chicken problem.
but that's a conversation for another time, when there aren't so many impressionable minds around.
sounds intriguing.
all right!
let's give it up for the Wildcat crooners.
Hey, hon!
Hey!
will you save my spot in line?
Yes.
so, what do you think?
Oh, it's great.
everyone looks like they're having so much fun.
Yes, they are.
Hey, how come you're not wearing your t-shirt?
Oh, shoot.
I completely forgot.
Hey, what are you doing?
you lost our place in line.
I just a text.
Adrianna is in labor.
Oh, guys!
what on earth are you doing down there?
I'm cleaning.
Naomi asked me to keep an eye on the house.
unbelievable.
she throws this party, and she's not even here.
what are you looking at?
if you're supposed to be cleaning, clean.
I'm going outside to resist taking up smoking again.
it's never easy.
me and Silver-- it.
I don't know.
relationships are work.
that's what they always say, right, man?
well, this one is a lot of work.
I mean, sometimes I just wish I had a regular high school girlfriend who liked stuff like prom and going to see her boyfriend play lacrosse and didn't think walking on the third street promenade meant she was a consumerist sellout.
silver isn't easy, man.
of course not.
I mean, who wants some boring regular high school girl?
I mean, Silver's got spirit and attitude.
life-force.
you know?
all I mean is.
I think you and Silver are great.
and everything worth anything just takes work and patience.
Yeah, yeah.
I hear you, man.
but what can I do? I mean.
I love her, man.
I mean, when she's across the room, I miss her.
you know, speaking of which,
I'm going to go see how she's doing, all right?
go, man.
I'm going to run to Adrianna's room.
can you hold this?
sure, okay.
we'll wait here.
I can't believe we haven't heard from Annie or Dixon.
well, I'm sure they're on their way.
Hey, where'd you get those, piglet?
I may have snuck them out of the postprom-a-palooza.
come on.
share.
after the piglet dig?
okay.
Oh, thank you!
I'm not ready.
it's too soon.
I'm supposed to have three more weeks.
it's going to be okay.
Greg and Leslie aren't even here yet.
they're getting a flight.
they'll be here at 5: 00 A. M.
get Ty.
I need him to sign that parental waiver.
he hasn't signed it yet.
I will call him.
I will get him down here.
have you call mom your aunt's.
she'll be here soon, okay?
I don't even have a toothbrush.
don't worry.
your breath doesn't smell that gross.
did you get a hold of Brenda?
no.
I left her a message.
she must still be in China.
what is she doing in china?
she's supposed to be here.
it's too soon.
see? I'm not ready.
nothing is ready.
calm down.
what happening?
I don't know.
the baby's heart rate's dropping.
what does that mean?
we need to do a c-section now.
just stay calm.
you're gonna be okay.
just go.
OK, he watch the jackets!
and go!
go!
Ryan. what are you doing?
it's you. Erupting like a volcano.
is the lava not reading?
maybe I need to do some more crosshatching.
she's beautiful.
do you want to hold her?
come on, Ade.
just take a look.
no, Navid.
just take her out of here.
okay.
just get some rest, okay?
Hey.
it's a girl.
she's great.
healthy.
six pounds, two ounces.
18 inches.
how's Ade?
she's, uh, good.
she's.
she's fine. She's resting.
can we see the baby?
Yeah, sure. She's down the hallway in the nursery.
I'll go with you guys.
Hey, Navid, quick question.
do you know where Dixon and, and, uh.
do you know where Annie and Dixon are?
me? No.
you don't think they're still at your house?
my house?
Oh, right, right, yeah.
uh, my house.
they might be, yeah.
I'm gonna go see the baby, okay?
clearly, they lie.
looks like it.
do you really think they went to an afterprom party?
Yes.
they must have.
well, how are we gonna find them?
they're not answering their phones. - I don't know.
maybe we should get in the car and drive around.
drive where?
I don't know.
Oh, man, suddenly I am so tired.
why are you laughing?
Oh, my god, the way you yawned!
like, like, like a lion.
did you just.
I did!
did you just make yourself yawn?
I did!
I did.
now you have to try it.
come on.
try it. Make yawn.
Oh, man!
I feel weird.
me, too.
almost like I am stoned or something.
Yeah, at's how I feel.
I-I keep losing my train of thought and I have the munchies!
the brownies!
you think they were.
pot brownies?
Seriously?
Oh, my god!
uh, where's Dixon?
in the other room deejaying.
always the life of the party.
can I ask you something?
sure.
what do you think about me and Dixon?
I think both of you guys are great.
no, I mean, like, as a couple?
we're just so different.
he's, like.
prom royalty, you know?
and I'm not.
actually, technically, you are.
come on.
is that who you think I am, what, a prom queen?
no, no, and I'm glad that you're not.
Dixon loves you, Silver, and prom is like a once-a-year thing, which means there are still 364 non-prom nights where your differences won't seem so drastic.
so you think we work?
Yeah, I think you guys make a great couple.
good.
okay, I just needed to hear that.
are you wearing Dixon's jacket?
you must have picked up his jacket by mistake.
Yeah, I guess.
I got you, man.
Hey, Dixon, I think we, uh, mixed up our jackets.
Oh, uh, man, I knew this felt a little tight.
you know, with my broad shoulders and everything.
Thanks, man.
Hey, um, you want a song?
uh, no.
no, man, you're doing great.
good job, man.
all right, thanks, man.
you see, the problem is we can't drive anywhere because we're stoned.
right.
maybe we should call a cab.
okay.
should I call one or should I put on the list to call one?
why are we whispering?
I'm not sure.
Hey.
everything okay?
just making a list.
fine. Good.
it's good.
should we tell her?
Yeah, okay.
I grabbed a few brownies from the post-prom-a-looza, and we suspect that they contained cannabis.
now, see, that you should have whispered.
what?
the nerds had pot brownies.
so, you two are high?
Yes, we are!
we are!
and it, it, it couldn't be worse timing because we cannot drive to find the kids.
where would you drive exactly?
I have no idea.
okay.
everything is gonna be okay.
you have great kids.
I'm sure they're safe.
there's nothing you can do.
can we at least get some snacks?
Yes, I will go to the vending machine get you some snack.
I can't be sure they're gonna have barbecued chicken, but maybe they'll have barbecued chips.
Oh, barbecued peanuts, pork rinds?
she has a crush on you.
Yeah, right!
I'm serious.
that is the pot talking.
it makes you paranoid, remember?
you see that guy over there?
15 minutes ago, I thought he was the narc that was onto us.
is he staring at us?
Yes.
Hey, uh, are you okay?
Oh, look.
Annie the rat.
I'm cool.
Oh, okay.
I'm fine.
I'll just head home.
how you gonna get home?
I guess I'll walk.
I don't know.
can you drive me?
Yes, I can drive you.
all right.
okay, come on.
wrap around.
let's go.
okay!
having fun?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Really?
cause you look bored.
you caught me.
I'm, um, Naomi's next-door neighbor.
what's your name?
I'm Liam.
why do I know your name?
cause I just told it to you.
I know.
I heard a crazy story about you.
Yeah, you're the one whose mom was a maid, right?
until she ended up shagging her boss.
where did you hear that?
Oh, just a bunch of girls were gossiping about you.
is it true or was Naomi just exaggeratg?
because she does have that tendency.
I mean, you know.
she's your girlfriend, right?
no.
Naomi is not my girlfriend.
you know.
I think that you and I could find a way to make this night a lot more fun.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Brenda! Hi.
Hey, sweetie.
you're here.
I thought you were supposed to be in China.
my show got extended.
I leave for beijing tomorrow.
but when I heard that you were here,
I rushed right over right after curtain.
you're playing Cleopatra?
that's crazy. I just played Cleopatra.
well, that doesn't surprise me.
you and me, we're two of a kind.
I mean, think about it.
we both love drama.
we both live pretty dramatic lives.
Yeah, we do.
how's the baby?
fine.
healthy, you know.
she's.
she's fine.
do you want to go for a walk?
um, I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that.
who's gonna stop you?
you are with the Queen of Egypt.
okay.
let's go to the cafeteria.
maybe get some Jell-O.
jell-o?
I love Jell-O.
me, too.
see?
we are two of a kind.
that's not a relative of yours, is it?
Yeah, that's my father.
he's dying, actually.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, you know what I hope they have?
jell-o with those little marshmallows.
your dad's dying?
could go any minute.
but shouldn't you be with him?
too painful.
of course, it's painful.
I'm just not ready.
but you'll never be ready, will you?
I-I just think if you don't say good-bye, you're always gonna regret it.
have you met my dragon?
handsome, isn't he?
Yes, sure.
you have to say good-bye, Brenda.
if you don't, you're gonna always regret it.
always!
good-bye.
I've got to go to China.
I want to hold my baby.
okay, on three.
so, how long have you had a thing for my girlfriend?
what?
the way you're looking at her, man.
now?
no, I wasn't looking at Silver.
I was just staring off.
I think, actually, something got caught in my contact lens.
the way you were talking about her before.
well, come on, man, I think Silver's great, you know, but as a friend.
and as my friend's girlfriend.
you swear?
of course.
so why do you have a picture of her in your pocket?
well, I.
I got it for you.
you're lying to me.
Dixon, just let this go.
so you're, you're just gonna lie to me?
I thought I was your friend.
I am your friend.
and I didn't do anything, so just back off.
but you wanted to.
you wanted to do something.
says who?
just admit it.
admit what?
okay, you guys have to come swimming.
the water's fine.
what's wrong?
don't lie to me, man.
drop it, Dixon.
admit it.
drop it.
I mean, you're king jock, right?
so, man up!
admit it!
fine!
I like you, Silver.
what?
thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
you sure it's okay if I go?
come on.
you've been here all night.
and you have about 200 people waiting for you at your house.
mm, okay.
I'll be back here first thing tomorrow.
and by "first thing," I mean mid-afternoon.
definitely before dinner.
we'll be here.
here's the form.
Thanks.
I also want to give this to you.
a cigar?
Yeah, it's what they give new fathers, right?
so here.
you're a good guy, Navid.
you've really been there for Adrianna, which I respect.
I also respect your left hook.
Yeah, sorry.
Thanks.
Thanks.
trail mix?
Oh, no, I'm good.
you sure?
it's really good.
I'm sure it is, but I'm not high.
Oh, yeah, right.
it's weird.
I forgot how this makes you feel.
hungry, paranoid.
you know, earlier, I actually thought you had a crush on my husband.
what?
Oh, I know, it's insane.
just, we women, we get a little jealous, and, well, add pot into the mix.
Debbie, I.
Oh, I know.
it's me. I'm stoned.
that's why I swore off this stuff in college.
Hey, Savanna, have you seen Liam?
Oh, my god, this party is a-ma-zing!
thank you.
Liam?
I think maybe he went upstairs.
Thanks.
you're back.
what have you done?
who is she?
she's nobody.
and she's gone.
I don't ever want to see you again.
golly, my sister can be so high-strung.
and she has such hilariously bourgeois ideas about fidelity.
now, where is my Louboutin?
here we go.
your sister?
are you kidding me Naomi is your sister?
Yes.
she was getting a little full of herself.
she needed to be knocked down a peg.
trust me: It's good for her.
you used me.
it's not like you didn't have fun, right?
if I were you, I'd consider myself lucky.
but she is your sister.
I mean, she's gonna hate you.
Oh, she'll never know it's me.
I mean, you're not gonna tell her.
because she'd be devastated.
and you're just not that cruel.
give me my shirt.
I forgot how cute teenage boys are when they're upset.
you are a bitch.
don't be vulgar.
and yes, I am.
only when it's absolutely necessary.
how could you?
what?
you slept with Liam in my bed.
no.
W-what are you talking about?
don't lie to me.
Naomi, I didn't do anything.
what is this?
it's my wrap.
which I found in my room.
how did it get there?
I don't know.
I haven't even been in your room.
must have been somebody else.
I was with Phoebe Abrams.
Oh, right!
she hates you!
no.
look, I know she does.
but she got so drunk so I had to drive.
stop lying to me!
stop it!
Naomi, I wouldn't do that to you.
what are you talking about?
you already have!
what?
Ethan ring a bell?
and I forgave you 'cause apparently I was an idiot!
okay. Naomi, please stop, okay?
this is crazy.
she acts like she's this innocent girl from Kansas.
that is not what she is!
maybe at one time.
not anymore.
she ratted out the party.
no, I didn't!
no one wants you here.
why are you still here?
get out of my house, Kansas Skank!
that's for Charlie.
get out!
get out!
screw.
screw you, naomi!
screw all of you!
Hi, um, I was calling.
I was concerned about some underage drinking going on at a party near my house, 174 West Hollybrook.
the house belongs to Naomi Clark.
Where's your dragon?
honey, did they give you painkillers?
wait.
am I awake?
no, I am not awake because you're in China.
okay. I got back a couple hours ago.
I'm real.
sorry.
Ade, she is beautiful.
it's hard to believe it was her all this time.
you know?
inside me.
pretty amazing.
Yeah, really amazing.
uh, sorry to interrupt you guys, but, um, Greg and Leslie are here.
already?
Yeah, they're parking downstairs.
see, this.
this is why I didn't want to hold her.
this is why.
this.
now I have to say good-bye.
how am I gonna say good-bye?
how?
look, I know that this is tough, and this is your decision.
all I can say is that adoption is a wonderful gift.
and I' speaking from experience.
that's why I was in China.
I adopted a little girl.
Really?
Yeah.
she's with my mom and dad right now, and I cannot wait for you to meet her.
trust me, that couple you chose, you are making them so happy.
and they're gonna make her so happy.
Yeah. I know they are.
you're gonna be really happy, okay?
thank you.
you're gonna be happy.
what was that?
I never wanted to say anything.
I don't know what to do with this, okay?
I mean, you're one of my best friends, but that's it, right?
we're just friends.
I don't think we're just friends.
no.
and I don't want to be just friends.
I don't think I could take it.
I want to be something more.
or I don't want to be anything.
it's up to you, Silver.
just think about this: Why are you out here talking with me instead of inside talking to your boyfriend?
it's okay, darling.
it's okay.
I'm here and I'm gonna take good care of you, I promise.
I promise.
you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
thank you.
what's her name?
that'a really pretty name.
good-bye, Maisie.
good-bye.
I did the right thing, right?
you did a really good thing.
Hey, Naomi, it's Liam.
look, I know I messed up.
I need to talk to you.
get out of bed! Get dressed!
what the hell?
you're coming with us to Stembrook.
it's a wilderness therapy program.
now get dressed!
mom!
you can't make me do this!
Yes, we can.
your stepfather's fed up!
we have been dispatched to spread winter cheer.
and to tell you all...
the Winter Wonderland Dance is near.
you don't want to go to the dance, do you?
whatever. Sure, I'll go.
so what if I felt something when we kissed? That doesn't change the fact...
silver, you just said you felt something when you kissed.
this is my sister Savannah back from boarding school.
for the life of me, I can't remember why I ever let you go.
do you still have feelings for Naomi?
Yeah, I do.
I got a text from Ivy saying I had to come over here--at you had something you wanted to tell me.
I know this guy's a drug dealer.
what proof do you have?
I've been buying from Jasper the last month.
look, Annie... - No, don't. Stay away from me.
Why? You've made mistakes, but I don't judge you.
what are you talking about?
and you accidentally ran over my uncle.
I'm gonna read War and Peace.
Oh, yeah, one of my New Year's resolutions.
I mean, why not? You know, it's like it's really long, okay, but it's not in Morse code or anything.
I can read it.- Uh-huh. Send.
you're so not listening to me.
sure I am. I'm just texting Liam.
okay, for my New Year's resolution...
he's surfing. And he misses me.
I have so much to tell him.
Aw, she just turned down La Cienega.
somebody's text-whipped. - She's cute.
Oh, he is cute. We're cute. This is so exciting!
so nauseating.
"Irritating" is the word that came to mind.
Aw, don't be a hater.
I'm not being a hater. I'm happy for you, actually.
I'm happy if you're happy, all right?
so did Naomi say anything about Silver in those texts?
no. What's up with you two, anyway?
I can't believe you guys kissed.
I know. It was out of the blue.
it was amazing, man.
can't wait to talk to her tomorrow at school.
I just really hope Dixon feels the same way.
see you later, boy.
all right, brother.
wow, look at all this.
well, I figured we had cause to celebrate.
it's a new year. Annie comes home tonight.
Oh, and did I tell you that she called to say she missed us?
Seriously? - Seriously.
and last night on the phone, she was even laughing.
and it wasn't that snarky, derisive laugh.
it was the good kind.
it's a miracle I still recognize it.
who knew Vegas was the answer?
two weeks on the Strip would have driven me crazy, and that's even if my mother wasn't living there.
Harry, is this that same boosters reception we went to last year?
Yeah, yeah, I think it is.
well, did you not tell me about this earlier because you knew Kelly would be there?
no.
look, I-I...I didn't want you to be uncomfortable.
should I be uncomfortable?
no, sweetheart, of course not.
you know, I mean, I've barely exchanged ten words with Kelly since we realized she had a crush on me.
since you realized she had a crush on me.
but trust me, I've done everything I can to avoid her.
well, I am not interested in avoiding anybody.
and I'm certainly not going to let Kelly determine what school functions I attend.
I'm going to this, Harry. Just like I did last year.
great.
and if I think about it, I can't even remember why me and Silver broke up in the first place.
well, wasn't it because she liked horror movies and you're afraid of the dark?
okay, very funny. All right.
look, me and her, we both did our thing.
she's changed. I've changed.
now maybe we can get back together.
I'm gonna talk to her tomorrow at school.
definitely before U. S. History though.
cause then she just gets hopped up on conspiracy theories and then there's no talking to her.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. I just...
I'm really not looking forward to going back to school tomorrow, that's all.
look, it's not going to be as bad as you think.
I mean, you already did the hard part and broke up with Jasper, so...
it's already better than it was.
Yeah.
I'll be right down.
welcome home, I missed you so much. Love, Jasper.
Okaye you sure I look tan enough in this shirt?
because at home, I swore this was a blue-white, but now it's looking more like a yellow-white.
Yes, Naomi, you look incredibly tan.
in fact, you look tanner than you did yesterday.
how is that even possible?
well, I may have gone to the tanning salon last night.
What?! Okay, I really want a "wow" effect when I walk into Allison's sister's 21st birthday party.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry.
everybody's going to be like,"Wow, you've got leather skin."
Oh, that's like 20 years away.
the party is tomorrow night.
it's going to be a total blowout.
she rented out the beach club.
I cannot...hey, guys.
Hi. Hey.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Oh, no, you didn't.
how-how was your break?
it was good. You know, just laid low.
how about yours? How was St. Barts?
wow, you look really tan.
Yeah, yeah, it was great. - Tan-tastic.
that's great.
um, I should probably get going.
- Okay.
Yep, yep, what did I tell you?
Ah, so, I didn't know if it was going to cold, - but it wasn't bad. - It wasn't.
and I got the 3. 2, so it was all right.
yo.
Hey, what's up, dudes? - What's up, kid?
so Northern California was cool, huh?
Oh, dude, it was awesome. I really like Berkeley. Cool place, man.
I even brought this, uh, this really cool souvenir.
Navid, is that...?
Navid, what the hell are you doing with cocaine?
okay, um... I think you need to put that away.
what the hell is wrong with you?
will you just relax? - We will not relax.
what are you doing with... cocaine?
you don't do drugs. At least I hope you don't do drugs.
of course I don't do drugs, man.
I was going to plant this in Jasper's locker. - Oh, come on.
and then I was going to call that anonymous tip number over there.
they'll find the stuff. It'll be all buh-bye.
just like the poster says. I'm not a rat.
I'm a hero. - Yeah, well, you're not a hero.
you're an idiot.
seriously, Navid, this is a really bad idea.
it's even worse than your Boys of the Blaze fund-raising calendar.
okay, look, Jasper is already a drug dealer, okay?
I'm just bringing that to the attention of the powers-that-be.
it's simple.
all right, fine.
how do you plan on getting in his locker?
okay, well, there's this, you know, master list of all the student locker combinations on file in the principal's office.
me? - Yes.
no, no. Sorry.
I understand. You want... you want to think about it.
no way, all right? I'm not helping you with this. It's stupid.
Dixon...You're on your own, kid.
it's your funeral. man.
dude, it's not that big of a deal.
did you get my flowers?
Yeah, look... - Look, I really missed you.
Jasper, stop. We're not dating.
what are you talking about?
I'm breaking up with you.
you don't mean that.
Yeah, I do.
Annie... - It's over.
then I'll tell.
what?
I'll go to the police and I'll tell them what you did.
all they need is a lead in the case.
you know, they'll probably start combing through your Internet history.
see if you have any... special interest in the case.
Annie, I'm guessing that it's not going to be that hard to find evidence.
I mean, you probably took the car to a local body shop that night, right?
after you ran over my uncle.
why... why are you doing this?
I love you.
you love me. I know you do.
look, we've both made mistakes, but I want to put them behind us.
just say you can do that, and I'll keep your secret.
okay?
come here.
Hey. Well, if it isn't the fancy Caribbean jet-setter.
Oh, yes, that is me.
so, look, I want to talk about what happened at the dance.
Yeah, um, yeah, me, too.
look, it was obviously a mistake.
Yeah, exactly. That-that's exactly what I was going to say.
Yeah. We broke up for a reason.
I mean, like you said, you could never really be yourself around me.
that-that's what I said.
I think I was just feeling vulnerable.
I mean, I was feeling rejected by Teddy, and when I saw him with that other girl, but...
the truth is... maybe I just jump to conclusions.
you know, maybe that girl was just his friend.
anyway, I'm going to talk to him and see if we can figure things out.
Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
so I'm going to let you get back to work.
and I'll talk to you later?
Yeah. - Cool.
Hey, Ives. What you reading?
uh... The Violent Messiahs.
right.
it's actually really rad. It's Lieutenant Major Cheri, who's apparently, like, a schizophrenic now, and she's chasing down this gnarly masked villain...
whoa. Spoiler alert.
um, so listen. I wanted to thank you for sending me that text the other night after the dance.
Oh, please. That was... That was nothing.
it wasn't nothing. You guys were, like, together.
what, me and Liam? No. Please. That was...
that was nothing serious. And I knew he liked you, so...
well, it meant something to me.
and in appreciation, a little thank you gift from St. Bart's.
Yeah, you really didn't have to do that. That's...
go ahead. Open it.
it was not easy shopping there, by the way.
everyone kept yammering away in French, but I found that if you spoke loudly and slowly enough, you could eventually get through to them that you did not want their island junk.
I hit the jackpot at Duty Free.
Wow. Wow. Um...
isn't this something?
I hope you don't have one already.
Yeah, no. Definitely not.
but, you know, I've always wanted a, um, pocketbook.
Oh, it's a Fendi baguette.
but it's the least I could do. Anyway. Thanks again, Ives.
all right, I'm not saying,"kick him in the groin,"but near the groin...
...would be great.
Um...So, how was vacation?
Oh, a blast. Time of my life.
aspen, right?
so, we're really gonna pretend everything's fine here? I saw you kiss Silver at the dance.
at least man up. That was a lame-ass move, bro. You know I liked her.
Oh, come on, man. It can't be that big of a deal.
I bet you got over it pretty quickly in Aspen, right?
no, I didn't just get over it 'cause I like Silver.
I thought I'd made that fairly clear to everyone by the night of the dance.
if there's something going on between you two,
I think I deserve to know.
okay, I'll-I'll be straight with you.
I don't think me and Silver are over yet.
you know, what happened the night of the dance? It just happened.
will it happen again? Probably.
look, we're trying to keep it on the DL, but, you know, between me and you, we're talking about getting back together again.
come on, man.
Hey, Annie.
Hey.
how was... How was your break?
it was good. How was yours?
Ah. Too short. You know?
Yeah. I hear you.
so, listen, um...
we haven't really talked, you know, since the dance.
wondering what's going on with you and Jasper.
Annie, please tell us you broke up with him.
it's complicated.
what's complicated about it? He's a drug dealer.
and he lied to you, Annie.
he's a really bad guy.
and he's pretty greasy-looking, honestly.
stop. Okay? Please just stop.
you don't... You don't get to do this.
Annie... - Leave me alone, all right?
it shouldn't be hard. You've done it before.
Hey, you.
silver. What's up?
not much. Um, I want to talk to you about what happened at the dance.
because, uh...
I thought about it a lot and I...
Yeah, about that.
you know, you were right about me all along.
"once a player, always a player. " Your words, right?
I can't be tied down to one person.
it's just... It's not in my DNA.
why are you telling me this?
because you saw it before I did.
I mean, I can't even decide who to take to this Beach Club party on Saturday.
I mean, Emiko's hot, but, God, Alisa's...
she's easy.
dilemma, right?
Yeah. I'm sure you're going to figure it out, though.
Hey, Jasper! How's it going, man?
Dixon! Wait! I need to talk to you.
what's up?
it's about Annie.
she's still dating Jasper.
What?! - Yeah.
I saw them in the hallway holding hands. I went to talk to her about it but she said it's not my right to interfere. And she's right. It isn't.
but maybe you can do something about it. You're her brother.
maybe she'll listen to you.
okay.
Hey, you.
Oh. Hi, Gia.
um, I didn't know you were in AA.
Yeah, that's sort of what the "Anonymous" is about.
it was a joke.
right. Right. - I was kidding.
a couple of us always go bowling after the meetings. You want to come?
um, I don't think so.
you sure?
last week we had a down-to-the-last-frame match with some dentists from Culver City. Very exciting.
that sounds tempting.
but the thing is, AA is a part of me, but I don't want it to be my whole life.
you know? - Yeah.
I-I just like having friends around who kind of understand what I'm going through. I mean, I figured...
my friends do. Or... they did.
things are kind of weird with us right now, but I'm working on it.
thanks anyway.
well, if you change your mind or if you ever want to talk, or anything, give me a call.
I'll see you around.
thank you.
Thanks.
Wow. This is great.
well, I've been planning this night for a long time.
I wanted it to be perfect.
well, good job.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
Thanks.
what was that? -Terry - Sorry. Uh...
nothing. I... Yeah.
well, here we are. At last.
I know, right? Finally.
so, how was vacation? - So how was St. Bart's?
sorry.
now, I was just... - I was asking you about St. Bart's.
did you have fun?
Yeah, it was gorgeous.
did you go snorkeling?
um, no.
well, how about parasailing? I hear they have amazing parasailing there.
no, I really just kind of laid by the pool thole time.
Oh. Well, sounds fun.
Yeah. It was great. What about you? What did you do?
well, I worked on the boat.
um, the hull's been planked and ribbed, so I've just got to finish the framing, sheathe the deck panels, you know...
and this is boring.
no, it's not boring. Deck panels are rad.
so, um, what's w with you?
um, I'm redecorating the house. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I'm working with this feng shui expert.
at first I thought it was another Chinese scam like tai chi or acupuncture.
but I really think she's on to something.
she's helping me remove all signs of Jen, so...
that's good. - Oh.
Yeah, well, that makes sense.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned Jen.
no, it's okay.
no, it's not. Um...
I just want to really forget about her and everything she did.
look, I'm-I'm really sorry again. I just...
can we not talk about it? Please.
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Sorry.
have you seen the waiter?
you will love this.
okay. So, see? Now you shake, and it's gone.
so Dad can't bust me for reading about Jude Law's latest love child instead of writing my Hamlet paper.
though, technically, because Jude Law is playing Hamlet on Broadway, can't you just argue that it's research?
not bad.
Hey, um...
so, I heard through the grapevine that you're, um, back with Jasper.
Dixon, stay out of it.
Annie, look. I just don't get it.
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
look, that guy is bad news. You got to see that.
Yeah, look, stop. Okay, seriously,
I don't want to talk to you about Jasper.
and we've been getting along lately.
let's not mess it up. Okay?
okay.
I'm sorry.
I actually kind of like that.
I'll talk to you later.- Good night.
Hello? - Hey, Navid.
Yeah, yeah. It's Dixon. Um...
about the Jasper plan? I'm in.
Liam! What's up?
Hey.
so, how are things?
good, good.
go on. How was the big date with the big "N"?
what? - Nothing, just...
isn't it kind of weird?
can we talk about that?
uh, no, not for me.
Liam, get over yourself 'cause I did.
seriously, what, you think I'm in love with you or something? Get real!
whatever. I'll just ask Naomi myself.
you know she gave me a pocketbook?
Seriously? - Well, yeah.
we're, like, buds.
okay, look, between you and me, the date didn't go so well.
you serious?
Yeah, it was awkward and just... weird.
wow, I'm sorry, man.
Yeah, it sucked.
okay, but you know you win some, you lose some.
it was worth a shot, I guess.
Yeah. - Right?
it was worth a shot.
I got it.
Hey, Mrs. List, do you mind if I go leave a note on my dad's desk?
go right ahead. - Cool.
I'll wait right here for you, bro. - Cool.
uh, nice blouse, Mrs. L.
okay, files... files.
the paisley's really working for you.
all right.
Hey, have you seen Silver?
um, no.
Oh, shoot. I really need to talk to her.
is everything okay? - No, it's not.
what's going on?
come on. You can tell me.
I had my first date with Liam last night and it was terrible.
Oh, no. - Oh, yeah.
we had absolutely nothing to say to each other. I don't get it.
how could things between such good-looking people be so boring?!
you're probably nervous. And he was probably nervous.
you both just wanted it to be perfect, you know? - It wasn't perfect.
it wasn't even passable. I think we lost our spark.
maybe we have no chemistry anymore.
don't give up. This is Liam we're talking about.
you've waited so long.
maybe we waited too long.
maybe we missed our moment.
I don't believe that.
I think there was just a lot of build-up. That's all.
and if chemistry is what you're worried about,
I think there's a pretty clear way to test that out.
Oh. Well. You could be right.
Thanks, Ade.
of course. Anytime.
Hey, Silver and I are going to Allison's sister's 21st birthday party.
I think you should come with us.
I'd love to.
good.
come to Papa.
whoa, whoa, look who's here.
uh, Principal Wilson in the house. Hey, yo.
looks like you lost some weight. Am I right?
Yeah, could bed a couple of pounds.
well, wow, you look fantastic, just, uh... fantastic.
well, yeah, thank you.
thank you.
Hey, Dad!
um, I was just about to leave you a note tell you I was going to Navid's house, but you know, you're here.
guess I don't have to.
uh, see you later.
okay.
and we'll see you later.
get it? - Yeah.
Bye. Bye.
Annie, hey.
all right, you ready to do some sucking up to the superintendent?
I'd be delighted. - Okay.
hey.- Hi.
Hello, Kelly.
quite a turnout.
Yes, this is quite a turnout.
definitely.
um, you know what? I was just on my way to talk to some boosters.
so I'll see you guys later.
see? That isn't so bad, was it?
no, it wasn't.
but I'm gonna go talk to her.
what?
happy Birthday!
can I take your coats, please?
uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.
aren't you gonna be warm?
uh! I'd feel naked without it.
Why? - Because I'm naked without it.
Nao... What?! - Really?
okay, Ade and I came up with this master plan to test mine and Liam's chemistry. Didn't we, Ade?
this was your idea?
not exactly.
I mean, did you even ask Liam if he was coming tonight?
why wouldn't he be?
um, because he's not exactly Mr. Social.
okay, something tells me Ade's plan was not completely thought through.
Ade's plan?! I did not tell her to come to the Beach Club naked!
Yes. You practically did.
shut up! - Drinks!
to enforced dress codes.
Oh, my God, there's rum in here. - Yes, there is.
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
are you okay?
Yeah. Totally. I'm fine.
I mean, it happens.
so, no Liam?
no, I haven't seen him.
shoot. I'm getting warm.
keep the jacket on.
uh, I'm going to run to the ladies' room. I will be right back.
we'll be over here.
hello.
Hey. It's Adrianna. - Oh... hey.
look, something just happened, and, um...
I was wondering maybe you'd want to meet up because I could really use someone to talk to.
sure. - I'm at a party at the Beach Club.
well, you're in luck. Nice sweater. It looks good on you.
everything okay?
I don't know.
I accidentally drank some rum and Coke.
just a sip, but the taste...I'm freaking out.
of course you are. It triggered something.
I mean, you start second- guessing yourself, you know?
did I know there was alcohol in the drink?
did I want to screw up?
I took a sip and I'm still here. It's not the end of world.
okay, stop torturing yourself.
no, I should have been more responsible.
this is my fault.
I'm at a party where people are drivking.
look, this whole sober living thing- it's a process.
it's going to take some time, okay?
thank you.- Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
can I borrow you for a second? I would love to talk to you alone.
excuse me.
let's talk about that little crush you have on my husband.
okay, look, there is no reason for you to feel threatened.
no. I'm not threatened.
I'm annoyed.
I'm sorry that you're annoyed. That was not my intention.
well, enlighten me. What was your intention?
what, to-to break up my marriage?
no, absolutely not.
I...I've been through a lot with my mom lately, and Harry ended up being someone that I could talk to.
someone that I could lean on.
and you're right. I shouldn't have.
but you have to know that the minute I felt that there was anything like a crush.
I hate using that word...
...I steered clear of him.
I did not want to cross that line.
you have to believe me.
I'm not that person anymore.
you see that buoy down there?
damn. That was close.
not really. - Okay.
you try.
I don't want to throw rocks.
okay.
you want to go see a movie?
they're playing this Bollywood movie Three Idiots.
since when? - Since forever.
I like to watch movies, not read them.
Oh, you should have told me. I mean, we've seem so many foreign films.
whatever. Now you know.
Oh, and just so you also know, uh, most of the movies that we have seen, I actually kinda hated.
I guess I was trying to impress you, but I just found them incredibly boring.
I mean, the plots are all convoluted and pretentious and.
just stop it. Just-just stop!
I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to pick a fight.
but it's not going to work. Okay?
I'm not going to fall for it.
I just...Annie...
I love you no matter what movies you like. Okay?
because we're not like other couples.
I mean, we're soul mates.
and you know what that means?
well, it means that soul mates...
...they're forever.
forever.
wait, aren't you forgetting something?
see you at school.
you know what we need to do?
we need to find you a nice, available guy.
Yeah.
preferably not an actor. - Hmm.
or a teacher.
and ideally...
straight. - Straight.
Yeah, that's not gonna be easy.
there's this great yoga class you should try.
in fact, I might go tomorrow morning if you want to come with me.
sure, I'd love to.
good, because I think I have someone you just might be interested in.
hmm, you work fast.
okay, three letters- WTF- spring to mind.
what?
what the frick just happened?
Oh, it turns out her crush wasn't about you at all.
well... it had to be a little bit about me.
Nope. Could've been anyone.
could've been you, coach Cooper.
Lou, the gardener.
Lou has the mind of a child.
it's not even the worst part. Naomi, okay, she unbuttons another button because now she's sweating.
Oh, no. - Yeah!
I know!
I'm, like, please do not let the AC go off tonight.
this girl, I swear, she is...
silver, you okay?
look, it's gonna be okay, all right?
Hey.
I didn't see you at the Beach Club.
so, I figured I'd come here.
Oh, cool.
is it, uh, is it hot in here?
uh, yeah, maybe a little.
let me see if the heat's on.
uh, I can easily turn it off.
that was, whoo. - wow.
I know, right?
So,- um. Anyway.
hmm? - No, what were you saying?
no, nothing.
you?
nothing, um...
and if you like country music, they have sober line dancing.
Plus, sober roller-skating and sober bar hopping.
Really?
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I was gonna say!
are you feeling any better?
I'm feeling much better. Thank you so much for everything.
my pleasure.
Oh, no.
what?
my ex-girlfriend just walked in with the new girl she's seeing.
Oh, no.
I can't believe this is happening. She's totally flaunting that she's moved on.
God, I must look like such a loser.
trust me, you don't look like a loser.
but...
but what?
your ex looks jealous. I think she thinks we're together.
I'm sure she doesn't.
I bet she does now.
why'd you do that?
I don't know.
you helped me out tonight, and I wanted to help you.
I can't believe I was actually thinking about giving him another chance after the break.
why can't I just get it? He's a player.
silver, wait, um...
look, there's something I gotta tell you.
the truth is...
I like you.
what?
look, when I said our kiss didn't mean anything,
I was lying.
I couldn't stop thinking about it during the break.
Dixon... - No.
anything and everything I said during the breakup, just forget about it.
because I'm crazy about you.
can you just give me another chance?
Japser: I love you. Always, and forever.
I think you're gonna like Kai.
he's very cute, very available.
and very coming towards us right now.
Debbie. How are you?
Hey.
I noticed you weren't in class yesterday. Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, it's fine. Harry and I just had a function.
kai, I want you to meet my friend, Kelly.
this is Kelly's first time here, but I told her all about you.
nice to meet you, Kelly.
so, have you given any more thought about the Ojai retreat?
cause I think you could really benefit from those classes.
you know don't think I'm gonna be able to swing it, but Kelly might be free that weekend.
cool.
I better start class.
well, cute, right?
totally, yeah, but he's obviously way into you.
Oh, no, no, don't be ridiculous.
well, he's a little touchy-feely, but that's just his yoga shtick. He does that with everybody.
let's all take our first position, please.
arms to your side.
let's close our eyes.
breathe in...
out.
breathe in.
out.
what's going on?
apparently they're doing random locker searches.
something to do with drugs.
huh, now what do you suppose could have prompted that?
no idea.
this one's clear.
uh, 143...32-37.
found something here.
wait a minute.- Navid, is this your locker?
well, yeah, but that's impossible.
you better come with us.
no... Come on.
let's go.
come on.
no, sir, let me explain. I can explain.
we got the weather, we got the palm trees with the more palm trees.
more palm trees.- More palm trees.
you had, like, a million friends.
back home.
and they all knew about the whole adoption story.
Ethan, this is Annie, the new principal's daughter.
Annie, my boyfriend, Ethan.
Yeah, well, actually, yeah, we-we know each other.
we met, like, two summers ago?
Hey, Ty.- Yeah. You want to grab dinner tonight after rehearsal?
ya - You can spence anybody.
I wanted to bring you these.
if you guys want to grab some food, I can watch Sammy.
you just got here.
don't worry, I'll be here for a while.
I went to dad's office last night, and I saw him there kissing another woman.
I'm gonna take you home, okay?
okay. It's okay.
in eighth grade, my dad had an affair.
I had to tell someone, so I told my best friend, Naomi.
she promised me that she wouldn't tell anyone.
so she told everyone.
well, I got some bad news.
I just got off the phone with your drama teacher.
got a family emergency in Atlanta and she is taking an indefinite leave of absence.
so what does that mean?
you're not canceling the musical, are you?
well, if I can't find somebody else I don't know that I have a choice.
dad, no!
we've been rehearsing for weeks and the show is amazing.
can't you just find someone to supervise us?
Harry, how hard could it be to find an acting coach in L. A?
I mean, I could throw a rock out the window and hit an actor.
fine. I'll do it.
what?- What?
I'll direct the musical.
uh, but... but, grandma, uh... you're so busy writing your memoir.
sweetheart, when the theater is in pain, I come to mend the wound.
o... okay.
Tabitha, that is a very nice offer.
Annie, you are very lucky.
I'm so excited.
I'm excited, too.
I have to remember some of those breathing exercises I used to do.
I had a director who'd say, if you're not breathing from your ass and reaching to the skies, the back row won't hear you.
I slept with him.
now I know you don't love it, but it's great, and, hon.
mom, okay, stop?
I think that your foundation's a little dark.
it's the same one I use every single day.
merry early christmas, everybody.
both my girls look beautiful.
why are we shooting the christmas photo without Jen?
we're gonna photoshop it in.
what? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
can we just shoot this, please?
all right, everyone get in real close.
Linda and Bob are gonna start renovating.
so I was gonna offer them the beach house.
I've already offered for the same reason.
Charles, would you mind turning towards Tracy?
there's a big space right here between you two.
I wish I could live at the beach house.
what does that mean?- Tracy, you're looking a little stiff.
Charles, can you put your arms around both ladies, please?
Naomi, can I get a smile?
and, Tracy and Charles, can I get a little kiss between you two?
could you hurry up, please? It's really hot out here.
it's an out-of-town emergency. Give me a second.
why do we even bother?
it'll be just a second.- Okay.
Dixon, your mom is driving me to school.
you can take my car.
sweet.
you call the realtor this morning?
only one couple looked at the house this month.
not surprising.
tough market.
what's going on?
we're having trouble selling the house in Kansas.
is that a bad thing?
it's not a good thing.
we're paying a mortgage on a house we're not living in.
it's not like we're paying rent here.
Yeah, but we still got expenses.
we got moving expenses, gas priceshey, hey, don't worry about it.
we're fine.
Hi, mom.
where are we going for dinner tonight?
I made reservations at Craft.
is dad coming?
he has a meeting.
is that code for "sleeping with his girlfriend"?
Naomi... - mom, how can you live like this?
how can you just accept that dad's with another woman?
how is that okay? Can you explain that to me?'Cause I just don't get it.
it's just a casual fling, that's all.
she doesn't even live here.
so what, mom?
he's still cheating on you.
this is between me and your dad.
stay out of it.
I'm not discussing this with you again.
do you understand?
perfectly.
I wish we could've done breakfast at the Peach Pit.
I hate early morning meetings.
don't worry about it.
I'm getting a kick out of being here.
I can almost still hear the chanting.
Donna Martin graduates.- Donna Martin graduates.
that's crazy.
Oh, thank you very much. Now that's gonna be stuck in my head all day.
speaking of, have you seen Donna?
Yes. And, oh, my god, her baby is so cute, I can't stand it.
I know. How's the play?
it's good. I mean, the Taper just went through a renovation so it's a really nice house to perform in. You're gonna come see me, right?
of course. I wouldn't miss it.
so... dirt.- What?
Ryan.- Ryan. Okay.
um... he's nice.
I like him.
we work together, so it's awkward.
and he's ten years younger than me, which makes it bizarre.
I asked him where he was when Kurt Cobain died and he said he was watching cartoons.
does he know about Ryan?
why would he need to know?
it's none of his business.
well, it may be his business if things get more serious with ryan.
you know, because of Sammy.
well, let me worry about that.
fair enough.
Ethan, I'm a mess.
I'm freaking out.
my family is so fake.
I mean, my sister's being photoshopped into the christmas card from paris.
my dad is kissing my mom while having an affair.
look, I don't... I'm sorry you're going through this.
thank you.
but, look, Naomi... - I know.
we're not together anymore.
but it's really good to talk to you.
Oh, damn.
why were trying to fit that tank into a compact space?
uh... I thought I had room.
do you know how much parts cost on German cars?
a lot?
just give me your insurance info.
um... listen, uh... do you think there's any way we can handle this between us?
Oh, you don't have insurance.
no, no, my dad does, but I don't want him to find out.
you know, he won't let me drive the car anymore.
I can get you the cash.
I'm good for it, I swear.
it's not like you don't know what school I go to, man.
it's not like I'm gonna disappear or anything.
just please do me this solid, man, please.
my dad's away on business for a couple weeks.
I just need the cash before he gets back.
Hey, Kelly.
um, so about Saturday.
there's a new pizza place in Silverlake. And apparently it's good, like New York good.
Oh, Ssaturday, I can't do it because silver's not going to be around to help me with Sammy.
how about Brenda?
she has a show that night.
Sammy's dad, does he ever take him?
what?
Sammy's dad. Did I... did I say something wrong?
no. No, it's fine.
um... he just... he doesn't live here.
where does he live?
all over kind of.
Yeah, he's, uh, he's a do-gooder.
he's actually halfway across the world right now doing charity work.
Impressive.- Yeah.
well, maybe we can do Sunday, okay?- Okay.
I'll see what I can do.- Great.
Hey, Annie, I haven't seen you around.
I've been around.
busy with the play.
so how's Naomi?
uh, just a lot of really intense stuff going on with her family.
Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it.
so are you guys like...?
no, no, no. No, uh...
she was just flipping out and I know how to deal with her.
right.- What about you and Ty?
what's up with that whole...?
Ah... nothing really.
well, I had a lot of fun hanging out with you the other night.
me, too.
well, good. Do you want to maybe do that again?
like Thursday?
uh, Thursday night I have nothing going on.
uh, cool.
well, I'm with my brother all afternoon, so you want to just meet at the Peach Pit like around 6: 00?
Yeah. Cool. See you then.
awesome.
so, the other night, I left without saying good-bye.
I'm sorry about that.
Oh, no, it's no big deal.
well, I think it's a big deal 'cause I didn't get to hang out with you.
anyway.
vampire weekend's playing this secret show at the avalon and my cousin got me vip tickets.
it's Thursday.
you want to go?
Oh, I can't.
I have plans.
okay.
uh, is it like a group hang?
cause I don't have to go to the show.
my cousin's in the music biz and hooks me up all the time.
um, it's-it's not really a group hang.
it's more of a one-on-one kind of thing.
got it.
I'll see you around.
silver... hey, hey, Silver.
can I talk to you?
headphones.
you have a nanosecond.
please don't blog about my dad's affair.
you thought my family problems were gossip.
why shouldn't I treat yours the same way?
look, I've said it before, but I'll say it again-- I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, okay?
because I get it now.
I know what you were going through.
what I did was really messed up.
Yeah, it was really messed up.
no, stop.
my ears are bleeding.
you have no passion, girls.
you got to sing like your privates are on fire.
for god's sake.
just because you're a bunch of rich brats doesn't mean you can't have angst.
channel it.
this is a song about your mother.
she's been lying to you about sex, and it pisses you off.
you're all teenagers, so I know you hate your mothers.
I hated mine.
use the anger.
I will show you how it's done.
grandma, maybe I... - Annie, I'm not your grandmother here.
I'm the director.
everyone.
you've got to move from the hips and claim the stage!
dad, you know how very much I love grandma, and it was a nice idea.
but you have to, have to find a new director for the musical.
I cannot replace her.
you have to, okay?
Yes, you can. She...
she makes me do these crazy heavy breathing exercises all the way to school.
and she's so embarrassing.
sweetheart, just one more week.
there you are, Harry.
excuse me, darling.
when you have a moment, I need to go over the theater budget with you.
the lights need new gels and the costumes are not up to par.
is that coffee on your tie?
what?
great.
you're seriously arguing with me?
uh, hello.
my mother... - saw the whole thing.
Hey, now you know how Annie feels having you here.
you know people in the entertainmed inustry, right?
anybody who might be able to direct a musical?
I think I might know someone uh, here.
Thanks.
you caddied at a country club in Wichita, cut grass, shoveled snow...
and this would be your first real job?
Yes, sir.
you go to West Beverly?- Yes, sir.
I once hired a kid from West Beverly.
a long time ago.
he was a good, good egg.
tell you what, I'll try you out.
you don't mess up, you got the job.
thank you, sir.
stop calling me sir. The name is Nat.
Thanks, Nat.
mom?
like to introduce you to somebody.
this is Brenda Walsh, a West Beverly alum and a very big fan of yours.
Really?
well, it's nice to meet you.
it's an honor to meet you.
I've seen every one of your films.
not every film.
there were some real stinkers in the '80s.
well, you were wonderful in all of them.
also I saw your Hedda Gabler at the Ahmanson.
that's the greatest part ever written for a woman.
I got to play her.
not as well as you, of course.
Oh, you're an actor.
Yes.
mom, opening night is around the corner.
there's a lot of work left.
so I thought you could use some help, and Brenda offered to assist.
I thought I was handling this all rather well.
Oh, well, I've seen the original production of Spring Awakening.
and I always think it helps to have an extra pair of eyes.
wonderful.
fine.
great.
all right, explain to me, why didn't you say yes to Ty?
I mean, it's vampire weekend.
it's a secret show.
it's Ty Collins.
Ethan asked me out.
no.
no Ethan.
what is wrong with you. He's off limits.
Ethan and Naomi are over.
they are never over.
let me explain something to you.
Naomi and Ethan have this thing, right?
it's like they're in this bubble-- this impenetrable bubble.
a bubble?- And no matter how hard you try you can't get in and you don't want to get in.
trust me, I stand beside the bubble and I'm scared.
well, the bubble has popped.
no, no, you see, you just think it has.
silver, I am going out with Ethan and you cannot talk me out of it.
and I'm not scared.
I'm going to buy you a box of tissues.
so... what can I get you ladies?
wait, you're working here?
Yeah.
are you trying to make me look bad with mom and dad?
no, I'm trying to make me look good.
I've been messing up since I got here, so, you know,
I'm trying to do something a little more responsible.
kiss ass.
Hey, you shouldn't be talking.
so can I get you anything?
the digital proof is in.
come take a look at this.
I think I'm going to order 500 more.
at least. I think you look beautiful.
thank you.
gross. I look terrible.
well, you've been outvoted, kiddo,'cause Jen likes that one, too.
I think you look great, honey.
great? I look high.
no, you don't. Were you high?
Oh, that's the office calling.
give me a second. Yeah, I'll be there at 8: 00.
outside's in control... that's funny.
you're home late.
uh, yeah, I got a job at the Peach Pit.
what? W-when did that happen?
just today.
they said they needed help.
and, dad, you know girls in Beverly Hills.
they like expensive stuff and expensive places.
Yes, they do.
I want to roll in style.
maybe one day get a nicer car.
no... no offense.
none taken. It is a piece of crap.
Yeah.
Dixon... having a job, good thing, but I wish you would've discussed it with us first.
you guys don't want me to take it?
no, you can. You can.
uh, but I don't want it to interfere with your schoolwork or lacrosse practice.
it won't.
mom, I'll be right down. I'm just saying good-bye to dad.
bon Ami Beverly Hills, this is Gail.
how can I help you?
Hello? Hello?
again. All right, all right, focus.
all right. Okay.
which organ produces bile?
the pancreas.
liver.
all right, name the three classes of digestive enzymes.
I know this one. I know this one, um...
Lipases, uh, amylases and... and, um...
And?
and I'll study again after work.
those dimples are not going to get you into Harvard.
I think Mrs. Schwartz is going to give us a pop quiz.
I'm gonna study after work.
I promise. I promise. I'm sorry.
Ethan, I'm freaking out.
Naomi, now is not a good time, okay?
Why? What's going on?
it's Steven.
I told my mom that I'm watching him so she could have some time to herself and he's just having a bad day.
that's all right. Let me help you.
we have a new cleaning service and I forgot to tell him not to touch the furniture.
he's been rearranging it all afternoon.
I've tried everything that usually works to get him to change his focus but nothing, and I really need him to stop before my mom gets home.
Hey, it's all right. I'm here. Okay? I'll help.
Hey, Steven.
Hey, man. Naomi came to see you. How cool is that, huh?
the couch is in the wrong place.
Oh, I can see that. You want me to help you out?
no.
I got it.- Okay.
well, you know what? I was actually hoping maybe we could pop some popcorn and watch a movie.
what do you think about that?
I came all the way from my house just for you.
Oh, it sounds good, right? You love popcorn.
I like popcorn, with butter.
a stick of butter, two teaspoons of salt and a pinch of pepper.
that's perfect.
that's exactly how I like mine, but we need the couch to sit on to watch the movie, okay?
so why don't you come with me and we'll get some popcorn.
hold my hand. Here we go. Okay.
Annie, your posture is horrid!
pull your shoulders back.
you're singing from the throat.
Annie, what is wrong with you today?
okay, guys, how about we take five?- thank you.
Hey, Dixon.
Hey, what's up, man?
uh, so look, my dad's trip got cut short, which means,
I need the money by the end of next week, and I got the estimate.
it's $500.
are you serious?
we can still go through insurance, if you want.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
um... I'll get you the money, man.
I'll just pick up some extra shifts, you know?
okay.
Yeah, yeah. All right, cool, man.
you're singing from the throat.
I need diaphragm.
Annie, what is wrong with you today?
I always learn a lot watching my rehearsals on tape.
helps me tweak things.
like did you notice that Jill was off-key in the second verse?
and Adriana, she needs some refocusing.
you know, Brenda, that... was very helpful.
eye-opening.
I'm gonna go talk to her. I know where she works.
you really want to do that?
it's my family. I can't just sit back and do nothing.
I just think there might be a better way.
and what way is that?
did you like when your parents got divorced?
you would have stopped it if you could have, wouldn't you?
I mean, look what happened to Silver and her mom-- their whole lives fell apart.
what are you gonna say to her?
I'm gonna tell the bitch to stop sleeping with my dad and back the hell off.
my dad's obviously going through a mid-life crisis and she's probably just some slut.
if I can get her to leave him, then everything will go back to the way it was.
but I need your help.
will you please go with me?
Yeah. I'll go.
well. That's your fourth dr. Pepper.
how late is Ethan?
half an hour.
did you call him?
not answering.
maybe he forgot.
that really doesn't make me feel better.
Oh, crap.
Hey, Dixon, can I grab a coffee to go, please?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.- Thanks, man.
so... these were your plans?
I'm waiting for someone.
right.
I will hope you have a good time.
Coffee?- Thanks, man.
thank you.
I am such a ginormous idiot.
Yes, you are.
he's a pretty good tipper.
ty is cool and sweet and he really likes me and I'm sitting here waiting for a guy I might not get.
a guy in a bubble.
an impenetrable bubble.
look, Annie, you're holding on to a crush you had on Ethan, what, like two years ago.
you need to go for the guy who treats you good, not the one who gives you grief.
yo, Willie! Burgers for table five, man. Come on.
can't make it , so sorry explain later, yeah.
lots of grief.
thanks for helping.
the kids can play it, but they can't arrange.
sure, sure. I would add a little percussion to the bridge here.
that sounds great.
so... do you want to play with the band?
I was hoping for a fuller sound.
Yeah, I don't think so.
um... by the way, Kelly asked me if I could babysit on Sunday and I don't think I can.
I have a lot of catch-up work to do with this.
all right. No worries.
do you know Sammy's dad?
I do.
he sounds like a cool guy.
traveling the world and, uh... helping people.
you know, I don't really feel comfortable talking about Kelly's personal life.
if you have questions, you should just ask her.
Yeah. No, you're... you're right.
should I have questions?
there's just a long history there.
you want me to go in there with you?
no.
just wait here.
I'll be here.
we're closing in ten minutes.
are you gail?
Hi, Naomi.
you know who I am.
of course.
why are you here? You're supposed to be in Denver.
why aren't you in Denver?
I just moved here.
Naomi, I... - you know what, stop. Just stop.
leave us alone.
leave my dad alone, leave our family alone.
go away-- my dad doesn't love you.
you're just a fling.
I'm gonna lock the door for a minute.
do you want some water or something?
no, I don't want any water, and I don't want to be locked in here with you.
I want you out of our lives.
why don't you go after someone who's single? Try that.
I've asked myself that same question so many times.
there are some things that don't make sense just because they don't.
I guess somehow it's worth it to me.
Oh, really?
why might that be?
because I love him.
Oh, my god, I've heard enough!
that's the address to my beach house. Are you Gonna move there?
your break's over in five minutes, Dixon.
I don't care about the same stuff kids in Beverly Hills care about.
hip nightclubs.
trendy purses.
I just like doing my own thing.
so, you're trying not to fit in?
I just like being different.
it's how I'm made, you know what I mean?
do I know what you mean?
I'm a black kid living with a white family.
doesn't get more different than that.
right.
is that weird?
you know, they're my family, and I love them.
they don't care that I'm black.
I don't care that they're white.
but, you know, sometimes, like, when we're eating dinner or if we're talking about something or even laughing, then just for a split second... I feel like I don't fit in.
then, just like that, the feeling goes away, - but... - somehow, it's still there.
Yeah.
so, when are you gonna ask me out?
maybe I don't want to ask you out.
Yeah, you do.
Oh, you're so sure?
Uh-huh... I bet you that you do.
wait... that means if I do ask you out, then I'll lose the bet.
Oh, there's no losers here.
all right, I like the way you think.
dad said you're quitting the play.
Oh, well, I couldn't work under those conditions anymore.
the acoustics in that auditorium are atrocious.
and the stage is literally falling apart well... thank you so much for all your help.
you're welcome, darling.
you're in good hands with Brenda.
you are doing a wonderful job in the musical.
you are very talented.
thank you, grandma.
mom.
I went to see Gail.
I talked to her.
why would you do that?
because I want her out of our lives.
you have no business getting involved.
mom, it's not just a casual fling with her and dad.
he's moving her into the beach house.
dad lied.
what?
mom... - No.
I'm sorry.
Oh, god.
no.
Hey, teach.
you look tired.
up all night thinking about me?
uh... yeah, I wish.
no, I was... up studying bio.
all right, everybody, let's focus. We got tests coming out.
Test?- Yeah.
bio's tomorrow.
flannery O'connor short stories today.
no, no, no.
Hey, Annie, listen, I am so sorry about standing you up.
this whole thing with my brother... - don't worry about it.
it's not like it was a date or anything, right?
I got to go.
so, do you think you could score some tickets for the sea wolf concert this weekend?
I heard they're playing Spaceland.
Yeah, I have tickets for that show.- Cool.
I'm already going with someone else.
later.
so, I can't do pizza on Sunday.
I just can't get a sitter-- everybody's busy.
okay.
what's the matter?
look, I don't know what the story is with you and Sammy's dad.
it just feels like there's unfinished business.
and what would give you that idea?
well, I was talking to Brenda, and...
wait, wait-- you were talking to Brenda about me?
I'm just trying to get to know you.
look, Kelly, I just want you to feel like you can talk me, you know, like you can tell me anything, and if there is something going on with you and your ex, then... I'm a big boy... I can handle it.
there's nothing going on with me and my ex.
uh, what did you say to Ryan?
about what?- About me.
not much.
you shouldn't have said anything.
okay, Kelly, any guy that dates you is gonna have questions about him.
you should just get your story straight.
my story is straight.
you know, you get really emotional when you talk about this.
I wonder why that is.
what are you saying?
I'm saying that you still have feelings for him.
of course I still have feelings for him-- he's my son's father.
Kelly, come on, you know there's more to it than that.
no, there isn't. Because it can't be;
because he's not here, and I deserve to be with somebody and be happy.
Oh, give me a break.
you are never gonna be happy with somebody else, because you're still in love with Dylan, and you know it.
dad, what are you doing here?
hear they have great coffee.
well, you came to the right spot.
Mr. Matthews told me that you got an incomplete on the test you took today.
I'll make it up.
look, Dixon, I like that you have this job, but I told you I didn't want it to interfere with your schoolwork.
dad, look, I-I need this job right now, you know?
after next week, you know, I'll cut down on a few shifts, but...
why next week?
um... because I, uh...
accidentally knocked off someone's side mirror when I was parking the van and wanted to pay for it myself.
you should've come to me.
but, dad...
your insurance would've went up, right?
and I heard you and mom talking about money problems.
so I wanted to take care of this myself.
I don't know many other kids who would've gotten a job.
I mean, hell, I never did.
you're already ahead of me.
look, uh, I'll-I'll pay for it now, and you can pay me back in time.
how's that sound?- Thanks, dad.
leave a tip.
I got your tip: Don't get any more bad grades.
do you like it?
Oh, I love it.
I think I'm gonna wear it to school.
Oh, you would not. I dare you.
come on, get into the video.
all right, all right, all right.
you look pretty good with a monkey on your head.
Oh, yeah? Well, you look good with a tiger on your head.
thank you, thank you.
this is the best day ever.
I love you, Ethan Ward.
I love you.
you're not cotton candy.
yo, Dix.
here.
thanks for helping me out, man.
no worries.
so, listen, my dad has a hookup with the Lakers.
we got courtside tickets, but my buddy bailed on me.
so you interested?
for real?- Yeah.
Kobe?
hell, yeah, I want to see the lakers, man!
you hit that guy's car, almost got him in trouble, and then he asks you to a game?
it's nothing.
I've seen guys fistfight, and then five minutes later, they're hanging out.
that's crazy.
Yeah, you know, guys aren't like girls.
we don't hold grudges.
life is way too short.
look...
I'm not gonna post anything on my blog about you.
okay.
thank you.
just thought you should know.
okay.
so see you around?
Yeah. See you.
all right, man, so I'll just catch you later.
what's this?
snickerdoodles. They're apology cookies.
when I do something screwed up, I bake.
uh, you know, just forget about it.
I can't forget about it.
I'm an idiot, Ty.
I like you. I want to hang out with you.
well, you really haven't been acting like it.
I know. I know I messed up.
and-and I am so hoping that I'm not too late to fix it.
am I too late?
look, I-I spent the whole night making you these cookies.
so eat a snickerdoodle; they're really good.
I really don't think cookies are gonna do it.
you haven't tasted one yet.
Annie, I don't have to. I just...
that's way better than cookies.
I'm sorry. Really.
you know, if you weren't so freakin' adorable,
I wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.
can we start over?- Okay. Yeah.
so you want to go out this weekend?
Yes, I would.
I remember that hat.
l. A. Zoo.
still cute.
how you doing?
I'm all right.
I realized, can't always get what I want.
no matter how bad I want it.
can't fix my parents' marriage.
can't make my dad love my mom.
I'm sorry.
you've been wonderful through all this craziness.
thank you.
think we can start over?
what do you mean?
all I know is I miss those two people who went to the zoo and ate cotton candy and were silly and happy together.
so you saying... you want to get back together?
I'm saying take it day by day, see what happens.
I can do that.
come here.
so cute.- Yeah? Still cute?
still cute.
Mr. Matthews?
class, this is Kimberly Mcintyre.
she's transferring to west beverly, starting today.
please make her feel at home.
Thanks, Harry.
uh, welcome to west bev.
you can have a seat right there.
y.
hey can I just say that I was the new girl up until.
right now, so I totally know how you feel.
well, I guess you weren't very good at it 'cause now I got the job.
that's cute.
uh, you want to tell us a little something about yourself, Kimberly?
well, why don't you just take whatever the old new girl said about herself and just make it better.
well, that's tough, because the old new girl is from Kansas, and it just doesn't get any better than that.
there's no place like home.
right.
okay.
so let me just talk about myself without feeling totally awkward.
don't worry, everyone in this class has had their awkward moments.
I'm Kim.
I'm from Las Vegas.
I wear size eight shoes.
I have three piercings, but I won't say where.
and I like tacos.
great, I also like tacos.
welcome to the school.
any piercings?
moving on.
this has always been one of my favorite experiments.
you'll be paired off into couples, all with different socioeconomic backgrounds.
by the end of the experiment, you'll have taken care of your real care baby and also managed the family budget that you are each given.
uh, that's women's work - I mean, whoever I get paired up with better recognize.
Mike, you'll be paired with navid.
what?
that's right.
you are a same sex couple, and Navid is the breadwinner.
um, I usually go for blondes.
with boobs.
Annie and Ethan, you are married.
Annie works.
Ethan is a stay-at-home dad.
do I have, like, a hobby?
your hobby.
is your baby.
your unique wireless I. D.
will track your baby care.
the baby must be fed, burped, rocked and diapered around the clock.
if you shake the baby, do not support the baby's head or mishandle it in any way.
it will register as abused, and you will fail.
Half-birthday?
Mm-hmm, it's the six month mark between you know how when you're a kid and you're all like,,"
"I'm four and three quarters," or,"I'm five and a half"?
it's like every single milestone is such a big deal, and then at some point, you just stop counting all those little in-between markers.
Yeah, not me.
I will always celebrcelebrate my half-birthday.
you are a very strange girl.
yeah? Well, I'm a strange girl who's gonna have the most rockingest half-birthday ever.
come on - psycho at a cemetery?
how awesomely perfect.
okay, tell me you you're into Hitchcock.
I don't do horror movies.
why, are you scared?
you scared, you scared?
no. I just think they're stupid.
sometimes that's the beauty of them.
clearly, you just haven't been initiated properly.
well, uh, maybe you can initiate me the right way.
okay.
okay, um, since I am a high-powered attorney, the teacher says, you can take the baby during business hours.
no, don't. Don't you have day care at your fancy office?
no.
no, I don't.
so, uh, hey, how's.
how's my nephew?
your nephew is a girl.
that's what I meant.
um, I think you guys have things in reverse.
first, you date, then marriage, and then a baby, but, you know, whatever works for you.
no, me and Ethan, not so much.
he is in rebound city, plus I take my relationships seriously, and from what I've seen, clearly he does not.
I need a guy who's dependable, who I can count on, you know?
I feel you.
well, hello, stranger.
Hey-hey-hey, what's up?
not much.
I just haven't really talked to you in a while.
how you been?
sit.
so?
so, how's Mommy Dearest?
you know, desperate to be Dina Lan and making me suffer for every second that she's not.
how you holding up?
I'm fine.
yeah there's just a lot of.
talk going around, you know?
I hear this talk, and I worry about you.
Yeah, well, that's all it is, is talk.
rumors.
good, good.
the only problem I have is her.
she's the one who got me kicked out of the play.
she's the one running to principal daddy with lies.
today after school, she's auditioning against me for a movie.
how messed up is that?
weird.
whatever.
okay.
I just.
you know, I hear things, and I know things.
and I see you putting eye drops in your eyes, and I.
all right, it's called allergies, Naomi.
can we not do an intervention in the quad?
seriously, I'm fine.
let's do five minutes on you.
um, Ethan and I broke up.
my parents are getting a divorce
my whole world is just basically a disaster, and I don't know, I just kind of need my best friend right now.
I'm sorry.
okay, I've just been really wrapped up in auditions.
I'm here.
always.
how about we hang out after school today?
pinkberry and shopping?
ragging on our parents?
good times.
all right, wish me luck.
I need a lot of it.
good luck.
Hey, in fact, it's been.
it's been a while, but, um.
switch?
switch.
it has been a while.
for luck - for luck.
now, you're definitely gonna get it.
great, so I'll get the invitations printed, and I'll call you when they're in.
I think it's gonna be the best fund-raiser we've had yet.
I have no doubt.
I want to thank you both for your help.
thank you.
I'll see you soon.
talk to you soon.
Harry, can I talk to you for a second?
sure, yeah.
it's about our son.
I mean, you know, do you think about him?
do you wonder what he looks like, what his interests are,
Yeah, yeah, but that.
I'm just trying to figure this all out.
I mean, I'd like to know that he's okay, but.
knowing that he's okay isn't good enough for me, so I've decided to do something about it.
which is?
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.
please, please don't kill me.
I am so not ready to die yet.
I haven't even been to prom.
,I.
I haven't been asked, actually, but I heard that Rick Bartley's gonna ask me, and I.
he's...he's Rick Bartley.
you...you wouldn't want to take that away from a young girl in her prime, now, would you?
please don't kill me.
I'm not, um.
please don't kill me, I'm not ready to.
I haven't even.
I haven't even gone to.
okay.
damn it!
please don't kill me.
that was great, Annie.
thanks for coming in.
thank you for having me.
sure.
you can go now, Annie.
right-- leaving.
Hi, Adrianna.
ready. Adrianna?
I'm ready to rock it.
hello.
we've only just been broken up for a few days, and you already have a baby with someone else?
that's impressive.
Yeah, we're just doing a project for Miss Wells' class.
you two are doing that project?
that's cute.
Yes, we are married for the project.
this is our baby.
how nice for you.
I don't care.
I've moved on.
Ethan and I are over, and he is more than welcome to have as many babies as he wants with whomever he pleases.
well, I am off to meet Adrianna.
you guys have fun.
enjoy your little baby.
Bye-bye.
and.
awkward.
you okay?
Yeah, good times.
you know, it's not like you guys are gonna stay broken up, right?
no, actually, we are.
Yeah, well, I've been here six weeks, and you guys have already broken up and gotten back together three times, so.
that's the point.
I...I can't do it anymore.
we've been through this so many times, and it didn't even hurt this last time.
I don't want to be in a relationship where I just keep breaking up with the person.
in this room.
I'm painting this wall black.
just one wall?
Yeah.
I think it makes a statement.
well, what's the statement, I ran out of paint?
you know black's my favorite color.
I like that, but, uh, what about Kelly?
she doesn't strike me as a "wall painted black" kind of girl.
that's the beauty of paint, right?
you can just paint over it later.
man, so you're staying here by yourself for two weeks.
you aren't scared to be here all alone?
I need you to relax and just.
embrace the awesomeness of this situation.
me, your girlfriend, has a house all to herself.
point taken.
so, uh, this is definitely gonna become the new party house.
I think I'm gonna charge a cover.
you gonna charge me?
you'll work it off.
I like the way you think.
but right now, you're gonna lay back, take off your shoes and get ready for something you've never done before.
in my hands, I have the three greatest horror movies ever.
we're gonna have a major movie marathon, my friend.
you have some nerve accusing me of doing.
I have some nerve?
Tabitha, you have some nerve. - Hey, what's going on?
Harry, it's my pool, and I'm going to do what I want when I want!
did I miss a segue here?
your mother flashed the gardener again.
I never flashed Mauricio.
I like to swim naked.
I like know it feels when the water glides off my ass.
why should I give that up?
mom, Mauricio comes once a week.
do you have to swim naked at that exact time?
Harry, don't be such a prude.
I'm letting my freak flag fly, and there's nothing you can do about it.
Yeah, and-and speaking of odd women, omen, uh, Tracy was at school today, and she completely blindsided me about.
about?
about wanting to hire a P. I.To find.
our birth son, and she wants my okay.
did you give it to her?
no.
I mean, I don't know how I can stop her if she wants to.
just time-out.
I get the feeling the only thing holding you back is how you think I'm gonna react.
no, that is not the only thing.
I mean, that's a big thing, but.
the kids, too.
do you want to find him, Harry?
Yeah.
I do.
I was thinking that I could write a letter, register with the adoption agency, and someday, if he wants to find me, or us, he can.
okay, well, I think that sounds like a good plan.
you.
are amazing.
Yeah.
tomorrow?
um, that's kind of sudden, isn't it?
I thought you guys were going to scope the place out first.
I'm so glad you came by, Naomi.
gosh, every time I see you,
I think it's such a shame you're not trying to be actress like Ade.
you've got such a look.
although, you know, I prefer when you wear your hair straight.
so much prettier.
so, is Adrianna here?
she must be celebrating.
she got the movie.
that's incredible.
she must be so thrilled.
we are.
especially after she botched her last couple auditions.
it's about time she got her act together.
so, you don't have any idea where she's at?
I mean, I was supposed to meet her today after school.
I called a few times, and she hasn't answered the phone.
I'm a little worried, so, I.
she probably just got so excited about getting the part, she forgot.
Yeah, she's just.
she's off celebrating.
it's an homage to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the character of captain Spalding is a total satire, but at the same time, he's terrifying.
can you believe that Rob Zombie directed this?
Dixon, wake up!
the call's coming from inside the house.
how long have you been sleeping?
I don't know. I was asleep.
what time is it?
my god, I got to.
I got to go.
glad you enjoyed the movies.
look, if-if I don't want to watch one movie, what makes you think I'm gonna sit through three?
I-I got to go.
I got to go.
grandma, you don't see me.
you just forgot to take your blue pill.
did all the blood rush away from the part of your brain that allows you to tell time?
I was just, um.
sneaking in.
were you with a girl?
I want all the deets.
don't worry. I won't tell your mom and dad.
Thank-thank you so much, grandma.
I meant, I won't tell them if you were with a girl.
they know you're not home.
your mother's halfway to calling the police.
I am so furious with you!
where have you been?
Hey, your mother was freaking out.
silver made me watch a bunch of whack-ass horror movies, and I fell asleep!
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wasn't doing anything fun.
trust me. - Still unacceptable.
can somebody shut that baby up, please?
I'm trying!
Harry, relax.
he fell asleep.
it's not like he spent the night in Tijuana with a couple of Laker girls and a goat.
I really hope I get the wording right when I repeat that line to my future therapist.
Annie, the baby.
I can't find her.
some parent you are.
Hey, this cannot happen again.
it won't.
where was your cell phone?
it-it died.
so, uh, where was it?
in the bathroom.
corner.
under my jeans.
nobody puts baby in the corner.
no.
good night.
Hey, how's it going?
missing my sis?
feeling a little blue?
actually, I,uh, already started dating.
okay. That was fast.
Yeah, well, did you think I'd stay on the market forever?
kind of, but that's great.
you should bring one of the lucky ladies to the Hollywood forever cemetery tonight.
they're showing Psycho.
Yeah, great.
no, I'll do that.
I'll bring one of the, uh, lucky ladies to the cemetery.
that I will do.
see you.
cool.
so, did you get in trouble with the rents?
Yeah.
they're pissed.
so pissed that they insisted on going to Hollywood forever tonight just to make sure I make curfew.
all right, well, look, um, last night I was trying to show you something important to me.
a house of a thousand corpses is important to you?
I was trying to share something that I like with you.
all right, all right.
I'm sorry.
it wasn't intentional, all right?
yo, be careful.
what? It's not real.
I don't want to fail.
show me one person who's ever gotten lower than a b in health class, and.
I don't even have to finish that sentence, because it has never happened.
so, you guys are coming tonight, right?
not only is it the most kick-ass movie ever to show at a cemetery, but they also have a Jonny Ramone tribute statue that I am dying to see.
Yeah, me, too.
shut up. You're making fun of me.
so, you guys want to ride together, or just meet there?
I.
uh, yeah, I suppose we could both go, you know, as parents, with the baby with us.
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh.
it sounds like a-a plan.
great. Let's do it.
Hey, Wilson, go long.
Hey, no, don't go long!
Hey, it's a baby!
I know it's a baby.
so the concept of the totalitarian authority in Orwell's book really coined the now ever-so-popular term "Big Brother."
what does totalitarian mean, Mr. Matthews?
you look wiped.
late night?
Yeah.
very.
someone knows how to party.
no, I was actually on baby duty.
baby duty?
once again.
am I boring you?
I did see the movie.
not the same thing, and the questions on your test will reflect the book, not the movie.
so, if you'd stop wasting my time, I could maybe.
excuse me, Mr. Matthews, but if I'm here, and you're here, doesn't that make it.
nice reference, Spicoli, but didn't you graduate in 1982?
thank you. I'm here all week.
and you're going to be here at lunch, too,'cause you just got a detention.
so, Debbie and I have lked, and we have decided to go forward with this.
Yes!
hold on a second, trace.
I'm-I'm not into the whole P. I.Thing.
I mean, we're not chasing somebody down here, so.
you know, we're gonna have to write a letter to the adoption agency.
Yeah, whoa, whoa, Harry.
I already hired a P. I.
what?
what the hell did you do that for?
look, I've waited for 22 years.
besides, you know, I just kind of figured that you'd come around, so I went ahead and did it.
come on!
Tracy, that's not what we talked about.
you come on, Harry.
I know you.
you want to know how he's been doing.
this has been killing you.
tell me I'm wrong.
okay, yeah, I feel bad about the whole thing, but you should not have done this.
now, look, Harry, I get it.
this whole thing is a shock to you, but I've been dealing with this every day since I was 19.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.
it's really nice to finally hear you say that.
Hey, it's okay.
Yeah.
Y.'s oka whoa!
I'm going to pretend that that never happened.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I hear this is where the party's at.
uh, that's right, so you can sit down and pour yourself a tall glass of shut up and don't speak for the next hour.
does that come in diet?
cause I'm kind of watching my figure.
and that ends the conversation portion of this detention.
I know you love my company, but this is getting a little old, Mr. Matthews.
the fact that I made out with you in the fifth grade makes me want to cut my tongue off.
do you have a girlfriend?
that's none of your business.
are you gay?
you seem kind of gay.
Yeah, about as gay as your dad.
my dad's dead.
hmm, well, I think your dad's about as dead as I am gay.
touch?
Yeah, good luck with that.
starting to see why you got kicked out of your last school.
you two sound like my mom and my old soccer coach.
before the unpleasantness.
Mr. Matthews, do you have a second?
Yeah, I do.
I'm stepping out for 30 seconds.
George, I'll give you a dollar if you keep your trap shut, and two if you learn how to read.
I can read, Mr. Matthews.
I'm ignoring you.
so.
detention. Bad kids, any idea where a girl can score some party favors?
I waited for you last night.
I'm happy you got the part, but why you didn't call me?
you heard?
isn't it awesome?
I was driving over to see you and then I got the call that I got the part and so I had to call my mom, d th anen I had to go home and celebrate, and it was just.
that's not true, Adrianna.
I was at your house last night and you weren't there.
why are you lying to me?
can you just take one minute and be happy for me?
I got the movie!
looks like our lucky necklace switch worked!
I think you can have it back now.
what-- wh-wh-wh-whoa, what?
are you kidding me with this? Really?
I know this lipstick container, Adrianna.
are you kidding me? What do you care?
it was yours. - It was mine.
not anymore.
I experimented and I stopped.
like you supposedly did.
give me a break, Naomi.
No! No, I won't give you a break.
okay, I'm your friend.
and I may come off as annoying or whatever you think I am, but I care about you.
and I'm worried about you.
I'm fine.
you're not fine.
and don't, don't.
don't walk away from me.
I can help you, okay?
I can help you deal with this, but you got to let me.
my god.
my god!
okay, you're right.
all right, I'm using, but it's.
it's not like I'm addicted.
I could stop whenever I want.
I'm just like, I'm just under so much pressure from my mom to get a stupid job.
I finally work super hard to get something and I'm gonna get busted.
I'm gonna get kicked out of school.
I'm gonna lose the movie.
I'm gonna lose no, no, no, no.
everything! - No!
no, you're not. - Give it to me.
what? - No!
just give it to me.
stop whatever you're doing!
Where'd you find it?
the coke was in the lipstick.
we'll cop you on the police report.
what the hell, Harry?
isn't there a better way than busting kids?
it's a little extreme, don't you think?
I don't want drugs on this campus.
and neither do I.
but you get one chance to earn these kids' trust.
what, are you defending drug dealers?
not everyone is a dealer.
please.
these kids have rights.
they don't have right to bring drugs to school.
this isn't China.
it's Beverly Hills, all right?
this isn't cool, Harry.
not interested in being cool.
or in your opinion, Mr. Matthews.
that was brutal.
big time.
those weren't her drugs, Ethan.
I know.
come on, Adrianna.
leave me alone.
did you see her get busted?
they took her down to book her.
Yeah, well, her dad will get her out of it.
Yeah, and then what's her dad gonna do to her?
she's probably gonna get suspended no matter what.
maybe even expelled.
she shouldn't be in this situation, Adrianna.
you need to step up and admit the drugs were yours.
says who?
says me.
I saw her take the drugs from you.
well, for your information, Naomi's the one that initiated me into the c&c club.
c&c club?
cocaine and champagne.
Yeah, but she grew out of it,'cause she realized how stupid it was.
you can't just let her take the rap for you.
what do you care about Naomi?
you're already practically dry-humping her boyfriend.
ex-boyfriend.
and she does care.
we both care.
now, if you care about Naomi-- you'll prove it.
mom, what are you doing?
I'm doing what I should have done a long time ago.
I'm acting like your mother instead of your sister or your friend.
you kidding me?
dad, she's tearing my room apart!
if I wasn't bailing you out, I'd be doing it right along with her.
great.
you guys!
there aren't any drugs here.
I don't do drugs!
well, you just got caught red-handed.
come on, mom.
you know I don't do drugs.
what is this?
no, I know that you dabbled with Adrianna over a year ago.
what I don't know is if your father leaving has made you start again.
that's nice, Tracy.
why don't we just lay off the digs and deal with the issue here?
this is the issue, Charles.
you don't think there's consequences for what you did to this family?
okay, stop!
daddy, you can fix this.
you can get me out of this.
can you just make it go away?
I don't think you get how serious this is.
I may not be a to.
sit down.
what?
sit down.
you're doing this to get attention?
no.
you're doing this 'cause you think you're gonna get your mom and me back together?
no.
well, I'm not just gonna be able to write a check - not for this.
this is gonna go on your permanent record.
you're gonna have to be drug-tested, make court appearances.
listen, if there's anything that you want to tell us, you should.
now.
God.
I know.
look at this.
I'm in a lot of trouble, Ade.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I.
I thought your dad would be able to get you out of it.
Yeah.
me, too.
apparently he can't.
well, maybe he can figure something out.
he's got to figure something out.
look, I-I want to help, but I.
but what, Ade?
I mean, no offense, but this should be you.
I don't think you're grasping how totally screwed I am right now?
I could go to jail.
you won't go to jail.
you don't know that.
look, I-I need you to tell them that the drugs were yours.
it's gonna suck.
I'm sorry.
I'll lose my movie.
no.
you'll get another one.
okay?
you'll get another one when you're clean.
babe, you got to get help.
you really have to stop.
you need to go to rehab.
Hey, maybe it could be a good career move?
what do you know?
sadly, that's probably true.
look, I had your back.
you've got to have mine now, okay?
we're going to my dad's office to meet with his attorney.
come with me.
maybe he can help you, too.
okay.
okay, yeah.
my mom is totally gonna freak out.
give me an hour or so to explain everything.
of course.
you'll meet us there?
Yeah.
I'll see you in a bit.
I'm really sorry.
we're gonna sort this out, okay?
okay.
mom?
there's my star!
this cake is just symbolic - so I don't want you eating it or anything.
calories.
Hey, mom, can we, um.
you did it! You saved us.
could we talk?
we were about to lose the house.
we were gonna lose the house?
well, I didn't want to frighten you or put pressure on you or anything, but, yeah.
I mean, I've been literally packing the last few days when you weren't home.
but we're good now!
and it's only up from here.
bigger and brighter.
cause all of our problems are solved.
all because of you, baby.
it's crazy, right?
couldn't sing.
wasn't handsome.
but still became a rock star sex symbol.
now, that was a cool guy.
this is Jonny Ramone?
thought it was Howard Stern.
all right, all right, take my picture with it.
all right, come here. Get him in there.
Yeah!
all right.
I mean, I guess they were pretty influential to a lot of bands that came out after them.
you know? I heard a green day cover of one of their songs.
well, look at you. You're a Ramone fan?
well.
you like them and I like you.
so, you know, I downloaded a couple songs.
okay, that was really cute.
can I just say I have had the day from hell, and you have completely turned that around.
honestly, I was a little nervous.
I just, I've just heard a lot of horror stories about people meeting online.
I do it all the time.
yeah?
you are so cute.
I'm so used to guys not looking like their pictures.
like at all.
well, you are quite attractive yourself.
honestly, prettier than your pictures.
Really?
Yeah.
you're right, though. I totally need new headshots.
you're an actress?
in L. A? That's rare.
Really? God, I find there are actors everywhere.
Yeah, no, I was, I was.
never mind.
um, would I have seen you in anything?
well, I was a corpse in csi, but I look all dead, so it's not a very good example.
I was in a commercial.
O-m-g!
this is the funniest story.
so it was for this medicine, and I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was like a vitamin or something, but then they tell me what it is.
and at first I didn't want to do it because I didn't want everyone to think that I had herpes.
but then I just did it, because it was a national commercial and I was all,"whatever"!
now, did you have to, uh, do a lot of research to get into character for that or.
what do you mean?
you know,'cause.
cause.
do you want to grab a seat?
Yeah!
it's good that we got here early,'cause we can scout a good spot.
and there are Hitchcock fanatics.
I hear some guys actually dress up like their mothers.
you would never catch me in a dress.
but you have such amazing legs.
thank you.
what's up, half birthday girl?
I see dead people.
we didn't get you a gift.
we figured that our presence was gift enough.
Yeah. It'll do.
Naomi's off the hook.
Adrianna's gonna admit the drugs were hers.
that's great.
you know, it was, it was really cool of you to still care enough about naomi to help her.
I'd be there for anybody who was important to me.
Ethan Ward-- never fails to surprise.
Hey, uh, I think I'm gonna get some drinks.
anybody want anything?
I-I'll go with you, man. Let's do it.
thank you.
okay, why does this suddenly feel like a double-date?
chill, it is not a double date.
okay?
we're going to have fun; it's going to be awesome.
what's up, guys?
very cute couple.
funny.
happy half birthday.
why, thank you.
why does this baby only cry whenever I'm holding him?
dude, have you looked in the mirror?
your hair, it looks like a medieval weapon.
this relationship is not working.
all right, here, take, take the baby.
dude, you're the caretaker.
come on. You're my bitch.
okay, so just one thing.
you cannot make out with Dixon while Ethan and I are sitting there or I will kill you.
okay, okay.
well, then, I'm gonna make out with him over there, so just shut your eyes.
look away, okay?
she kissed you?
Yeah, but sweetheart, I want you to know that this was all her.
I-I didn't.
Harry, my god, she's an even bigger nut job than I thought.
sweetheart, you understand that this woman has issues.
well, she's about to have some even bigger issues.
see, I knew you'd be pissed.
I just wish she was out of our lives.
Yeah, so do I, but.
she's in our lives.
Yeah.
I miss Kansas.
I miss my friends.
I know.
I know.
Hey, well.
at least you're not six feet under.
she kissed you?
okay, everybody, we'll start the movie as soon as it gets dark.
like it matters.
I mean, they take one look at your head shot and decide if they're gonna hire you or not.
seriously, who cares if I do gymnastics, you know?
you do gymnastics?
I used to.
I can still do the splits.
wow, that.
that is good news for everybody.
wow, that is good news.
Hi, I'm kim.
Hi.
I'm Jacqueline.
you Ryan's girlfriend?
no, uh, she's not my girlfriend.
who's this?
uh, this is a student, a very annoying student who was just leaving.
so what do you do, Jacqueline?
I'm an actress.
in L. A?
Really?
that's rare.
OMG, he said the exact same thing.
don't you guys know L. A.
is the capital of Hollywood?
OMG, I didn't know that.
good luck with your career.
I loved you in the herpes commercial.
thank you.
charming student.
popcorn?
if she confesses, if the drugs are hers, it should help, but you know there's no guarantees.
what I think we can do is.
I understand, Mr. Owens, but.
Adrianna is going to be here if we just give her a few more minutes.
Naomi, please let him finish.
okay, all that said, if your friend doesn't confess and this ends up on your record, it is, it's gonna be harder for you to go to college, to get a job, and you may have to go to jail, which in your case would be a juvenile detention.
happy half birthday.
thank you.
what the -?
told you it was good.
maybe one day I'll be in a movie.
that's projected on the side of a mausoleum.
one can only hope.
dude, I'm telling you, that is so her.
look at her - blonde hair, the Angelina Jolie lips.
can I get you a coffee or.
Yeah, yummy.
so, because it's a first offense, and because of the small amount,
I may be able to get you probation.
but it's going to be stuck on her record.
how could you be so stupid, Naomi?
I know you're upset, dad, but she's coming.
she said she'd be here.
she promised.
I'm a little disappointed in you, Matthews.
I mean, that's your type - self-absorbed and stupid?
no, listen.
that was incredibly inappropriate.
that's how I roll.
listen, I don't want to assume anything here, but I've been through this with students before, so if you're having any kind of feelings.
I'm your teacher, you're my student, and I'm a lot older than you.
I mean, I'm not a lot.
dude, chill.
I just didn't want you to catch her stupidity.
I hear it's contagious.
and I hope you didn't think I had a crush on you because.
gross.
gross, exactly.
Yeah.
get over yourself.
I am going to be right back, okay?
okay.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
your department made quite the scene today.
we did what we had to do.
I've already made contact with one of the smaller dealers, but you know we're after the supplier.
the supplier is not going to come anywhere near school after that bust today.
wrong.
we did this now because then they'll figure the bust already happened, and now they're safe.
and Harry, we've been over this.
don't make contact in public with me again.
let the precinct do their job and let me do my job.
I wonder, like, how and when our baby was made, you know?
your dad never had that conversation with you?
I mean, like, overseas or something.
woah, then we'd be like Brangelina.
you can totally get that.
it's not like this is a date or anything.
well, I don't know, we're watching a movie, we have a baby to take care of.
whoever it was can wait.
okay.
this is Ethan.
leave a message.
it's complicated.
and you're right, you know, about this not being a date.
YeahI know, that's why I said it wasn't a date.
Yeah, right, I.
even though, I mean, it kind of, kind of feels like a date.
Yeah, I know, right?
it's not.
no, no, it's not.
cause if it was a date.
I'd do this.
my god.
did you guys see that?
scared the crap out of me.
Yeah.
you should have seen your brother.
what a wuss.
Hey, but I wasn't the only one who jumped.
I jumped, man, I jumped.
Yes.
no pulse.
get th epi.
I don't know what happened.
I cannot believe you did this to me.
you were the one person that I thought I could count on, that I could trust.
it was you, Adrianna, you were it, and you can't even do so little as pick up your freaking phone!
amazing, way to go.
we need to talk.
we have a son together.
I'm Ozzie. - now that I know who you are,
it's gonna sting so much more when I never talk to you again.
I am tired of pretending that everything is okay
when it's not - we need to tell the kids
about your birth son sooner than later. no, no, no.
I caught her buying drugs.
I'm a cop, you dumbass.
how old are you, anyway? - I'm 25, why?
I would literally do anything for you. - oh, my god.
you paid for my rehab? -yeah, I did.
I don't think we can be friends if you're with Ethan.
I know that I can't stop him from dating other people.
it just can't be you.
so.
so...?
so, I have something
that I would like to discuss as a family.
when I was in high school, I dated Tracy Clark.
uh - I'm sorry.
that was just disturbing.
it was a long time ago.
when I was in high school, I dated Tracy Clark,
and at the end of senior year,
she... got pregnant.
very surprising, and obviously
a big deal, but, um...
well, Tracy and I, we weren't... Right for each other as a couple
and weren't ready for the responsibility that a child would entail, so,
we decided not to keep the child.
the baby.
Tracy was gonna not have it.
so, basically, I went away to college
and that was that.
only that wasn't that.
apparently Tracy... didn't
not have it.
she had it.
a baby boy.
she put him up for adoption.
you have a son? - no.
another son. a second son.
I already have a son.
exactly how long have you known about this second son?
not long at all
we found out about two months ago.
you've known about this for two months?
all I can say is that I love you guys.
I love this family,
and this news doesn't change any of that.
I have no interest in digging up the past.
so why are you telling us now?
because Tracy Clark Is interested in digging up the past.
she's already hired a private investigator,
and she is planning on telling Naomi.
so you wanted to, you know, fill us in on your little secret
before the whole world knew.
no secret.
you are my daughter.
you are my son.
this is my family.
this is what is important to me.
I'm just really hoping that
this doesn't affect us in any way.
okay?
so?
so...
Dixon, what are you thinking?
well, ac-actually, I'm thinking I gotta go to school.
Annie?
Yeah. school.
better go.
so? So.
how do you think that went?
um... it... could've been worse.
Ugh! What?!
I-I'm really hoping that this doesn't affect us in any way.
it's like, what did he do?
did he practice last night in front of a mirror?
like, really?
maybe he was, you know, nervous
about it or something, you know? Yeah.
well, he had about two months to prepare for it.
come on. cut the guy a little bit of slack.
face it-- dad's a hypocrite.
he tells us not to have sex, but when he was
in high school he got Tracy pregnant.
okay, plus, did you see
the way he kept, like, glancing at mom the entire time and what was she doing, holding his cue cards?
all right, um...
for the record here, I just need to know.
are you mad at him because he rehearsed what he was
gonna say, because he has a son?
because he's a hypocrite? Or, and, all of the above?
doesn't this bug you? At all?
it's freaky.
all right, but I'm cool.
so, half your brother, and half Naomi's?
Yeah, but it's not like he's half her and half me.
you're making it sound like some weird mythological creature,
like a minotaur or mermaid or something.
well, it's weird, though.
Yeah, it's a hundred percent weird,
and it certainly complicates things between Naomi and me
which weren't not complicated before.
I mean, she asked me to not date you at homecoming.
well, it's none of her business who you date.
Yeah, I know, but...
well, we're kind of at a fork in the road here. I mean...
should you and me be you and me?
or should we be you and me?
you know what I think?
what?
maybe we should try to keep our relationship on the d. l. for a few weeks.
you want to hide that we're seeing each other?
look, I want us to be you and me,
but I think if we act like we're just you and me
for a little while, it'll make things easier with Naomi and that'll give her time to hook up with some other guy
and she'll forget all about us.
okay.
Yeah, that's another path... in the road.
think about it this way.
we'll get to make out in secret places.
Ethan.
Oh, it's killing me. I'm so close to you, yet
I-- sss!-- can't touch you. shut up.
Hey, you want to hang out after school?
we can be you and me after school.
I really want to be you and me, Annie.
me, too, Ethan.
all right, fine. go away.
I'll see you later.
Hey, there. hi.
don't tell me you're trying to be the rebound girl.
with Ethan? me?
no. no rebounds.
not me. I'm going to let that ball bounce right off the hoop.
smart.
smart girl.
so Dixon told me about the new brother.
that's intense.
understatement.
well, I figured maybe you want
to blow off some steam, get away
from the parental units for a night?
Mmm. What you have in mind?
well, Kelly's coming back this weekend,
and I have to take advantage of my last nights of freedom
so I'm thinking - slumber party at my house.
all right, I mean, it sounds a little pg-13, but...
No! no, it'll be fun, and I would love to get away
from it all - and by "it all," I mean my family.
I'm definitely in.
so how are we doing?
great. except,
everyone's staring at me like I forgot to wear pants.
I went to rehab. Now I'm out, so what's the big deal?
I think they're just checking out your cute hat.
Thanks.
it's uh... very Pete Doherty.
in a, in a, in a feminine , non-skanky
uh, British guy sort of way.
Thanks, Navid.
jelly beans?
you brought me jelly beans?
Yeah. I was just feeling that, you know, you might...
deal with today better if, you know, you had some jelly beans.
either that or you'll just get high off the sugar.
I-I can't believe
I just said "high" be-be-because you,
you wouldn't get high.
it's okay.
I like jelly beans.
what's your favorite flavor?
popcorn.
the most disgusting jelly bean
ever known to mankind?
uh, it's buttery and delicious.
okay, I was just about to say "just like you,"
and then I changed my mind.
and then you somehow managed to say it anyway?
true. Ah...
Mmm. Isn't that yummy?
I gotta go to class.
buttery and delicious.
seriously, Navid, "buttery and delicious"?
that's all you could think of?
Hey. can we talk?
Annie?
Naomi! - Oh, can't talk.
geometry quiz. Gotta figure out why a square is a rectangle
but not every rectangle's a square.
so. Your dad and my mommy,
doing the nasty...are you as grossed out as I am?
Yeah. I'm guessing I'm a little bit more grossed out than you.
so when did she tell you?
Oh, you know, at breakfast.
she was all, "darling, good morning."
could you pass the probiotic yogurt?
Oh, and by the way, you have a brother.
parents are clueless.
no kidding.
Hey, you bummed out about it?
it's just... whatever.
well, you know what helps me when I'm bumming?
Jimmy Choo.
chinese food?
Oh, god.
Oh, Kansas.
no. Jimmy Choo shoes.
Oh. god's gift to women.
what are you doing after school?
today? Um... today after school, I, me, um...
today I'm, I'm, um...
are you okay? Are you having a stroke?
no, I... I...
have no plans at all.
no plans? What happened to "you and me"?
Yeah. I guess I panicked. I mean, all of a sudden
my mind was just a snowy snowscape of blank.
and, I don't know... maybe this d. l. business
just isn't my cup of tea.
no, no, it's cool, it's cool.
you just got to be prepared
in case Naomi asks you to do something.
you're an actress.
let's rehearse, okay?
okay, I'm, I'm Naomi.
why, Naomi, you're looking rather butch today.
okay, shh...
just give me a second while I get into character here.
Naomi.
okay.
Hey, Annie, what do you say after school
we, uh, hit up the polo lounge
and you can watch me blow off David Spade for the 80th time?
no, Naomi,
I'm sorry.
I'm busy.
see, there it is, there it is, okay.
so next time it's you and me.
I invited Adrianna, by the way.
I don't know if she's gonna come, but...
that's very sweet of you.
trying to be a girl's girl.
it's a little new to me.
Hey, Naomi,
do you want to come to a slumber party
at my house tonight?
Kelly's still out of town,
and we got to take advantage.
a slumber party?
how retro of you.
what are you gonna do, braid each other's hair
and put on face masks?
well, you don't have to come if you don't want.
Oh, no, I'll be there,
I'm just gonna bring my own face mask.
these pores deserve the very best.
Plus, I really have to get to know
this family of mine, don't I? Right, sis?
you can wear your new Jimmy Choos.
sure, -sis...
Hey, we should totally play truth or dare.
that way, I can get to know everything
about this new sister of mine.
penny for your thoughts.
a penny... in Beverly Hills?
we're in a recession.
come on. What are you thinking about?
about my dad's laugh.
is that a poem or something?
cause I like it.
whenever Annie laughs, you know, people always say, "oh, she sounds just like her mother."
well, now I know that somebody out there...
who has your dad's laugh?
I don't need his laugh. I got my own laugh.
Yeah, and your laugh probably sounds like your birth dad's.
Yeah, maybe.
you know,
I've been wanting to ask you about your adoption,
but I never really knew when was the right time.
well, I don't feel bad talking about it.
I used to live with my grandmother in Brooklyn.
dad wasn't in the picture...addiction problems.
so when my grandmother died,
I moved to Kansas to be with my mom.
so you knew your birth mother?
unfortunately, she was crazy.
not so big on taking medication, so long story short,
social services came
and took me away.
do you ever want to see her again?
Nah.
I know the feeling.
come on now. it's cool.
I'm not about to play myself a violin.
I mean, look where I live.
look where I go to school.
my super-hot girlfriend, hmm?
and my family, I mean, come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I guess
the wilsons saw how special you were.
they knew they had to have you.
so, uh, when you gonna realize that you just have to have me?
Ooh, I don't know, soon.
shut up.
punctuality. I like that in a student.
thought I could get a couple seconds alone with you.
Yeah, we can't really be alone here.
you know,
it's getting harder for me to see you every day in school.
how do you think I feel?
I'm supposed to be completely focused on this case,
and here I am thinking about one of my teachers.
uh, that is why you can do the extra credit
to make up the assignment.
that blows, Mr. Matthews.
that's life, Kimberly. take a seat.
so... I'm working on getting you
those "party favors" you mentioned.
cool.
I'm, uh, looking forward to "celebrating."
I don't love slumber parties.
you still have to come, Ade.
I don't know. I got my meeting
students against destructive decisions.
it's one of my preconditions for coming back and...
Sadd?
sadd is right.
okay, so you'll come after. Fantastic.
I don't know, though.
if you guys are drinking,
I don't want to be the downer.
you're being a downer now.
the party's not gonna be all booze.
it's about ice cream and cookie dough and face masks.
it'll be really cute.
there you go! Hey!
these are for you.
I sorted out just the popcorns.
you sorted jelly beans for me?
Yeah, well, I'm a man of many talents,
the majority of which are rather useless.
uh, I'll see you later?
okay, this took hours of freaky jelly bean sorting. hello?
he's either OCD or he wants to sleep with you.
he's just being dorky Navid.
Oh, yeah, well, dorky Navid paid for your rehab.
he wants something from you, clearly.
whatever.
you're so going to have to use
your powers over him
to get him to sort my closet.
color code.
Naomi, Que pasa?
what are you doing tonight?
Oh, I have a date. Mama Celeste.
you're eating pizza?
Mm-hmm.
and you can't reschedule?
Oh, no, it would have to be something really special.
you're making that guy run in so many circles
he's gonna get dizzy.
Mm-hmm, and I'm not stopping till he's sorting
the mikes from the ikes and the goods from the plenties.
Hey, got a call from our credit card company.
they said there was some unusual activity on the card.
quite a significant amount of unusual activity.
you know anything about that?
sounds unusual.
I kind of bought some boots.
Annie, that's an emergency card.
I really needed boots?
these?
items of footwear?
they cost as much as a small car.
what is this? Where are you going?
silver's having a sleepover at her sister's house.
I thought Kelly was still out of town.
no. no, you can't stay there
if there's not going to be an adult around.
Oh, come on, dad!
sorry, no party.
it's a slumber party.
it's a bunch of girls sitting around watching movies
and eating pizza - I'm nearly 16 years old!
when you were my age, you were making babies.
Annie, you are not going to the party.
rules are rules.
and, and these boots, they're going back.
no way!
yes... way.
are you stalking me?
because I'm over this whole "finding stalkers attractive" thing.
no, no, no, I thought
that maybe you'd want to go get
something to eat after your meeting.
Yeah, I don't know. Come on.
give a guy a break.
those were gourmet jelly beans
and I got carpal tunnel from sorting. you owe me.
right. I owe you.
Annie!
that's the second time she snuck out since we moved here.
we know she's at silver's.
let her stay there for the night.
no way. We didn't give her permission.
we just dropped a huge bomb on her.
she's acting out.
she won't talk to me.
Harry, when she's ready to talk to you, she will.
we have to trust her.
Cheers.
Yeah!
lime!
Mm...
way to go, Kansas.
you sure you don't want another one?
I am done for the night.
okay, Annie?
mm, s-t-l me.
we're out of lime.
then just "t" me, I guess.
it works.
all right.
Cheers.
we so should do this at my birthday party.
what party? My 16th birthday party.
my folks said I can invite anybody that I want.
I don't think the 'rents meant that you could invite
Mr. Tequila here.
Yeah, no.
Ooh, I got it.
we should play a game. here.
twister! Lame.
Hello? You don't play twister unless there's guys around.
why would you entangle your limbs with another girl's
unless a boy's watching?
Hey, I'm glad you could make it. Thanks for coming.
Adrianna!
you have to come to my birthday party, okay?
drunk?
getting there.
I never.
what are you talking about?
you've been drunk, like, a million billion times.
okay, Kansas, "i never" is a game.
all right, so, I say
something that I've never done
and whoever has, takes a drink.
I'm gonna start.
I have never... had sex before.
okay, what are you waiting for? Dixon's adorable.
okay, Dixon's sister
in the room and getting nauseous.
I'm just waiting for the right time is all.
Oh, please, it's not like angels start singing.
right? You go.
okay, my turn. I've never...
I have never been in love.
Really? Never?
Nope. Don't get sappy about it.
Annie, your turn.
I... I've never been drunk.
drink, drink, drink, drink.
you know, when Dixon first came to live with us,
I completely flipped out.
I actually fantasized
about putting him in a cardboard box
and mailing him off to Taiwan.
I don't know. I guess I thought, like, my parents
would love him more or something.
I still feel crappy about it.
meanwhile, my darling sister won't even answer my calls.
it's awesome.
I was kind of hoping to start fresh
with that new brother of ours.
what?
you know, my dad's been
cheating on my mom for a few years.
my mother tramps around like a pussycat doll,
and god forbid I'd ever want to talk to my sister about it.
I was kind of hoping to have a relationship with someone
who doesn't make me
want to scream all the time.
sometimes, I just, you know, feel so alone.
Hey, you're not alone. you have me.
and these bitches, right?
holy moly!
my shirt totally matches your nail polish
perfectly!
holy moly, Kansas!
you're right, it does.
let's trade shirts.
okay.
yours... and mine.
all right.
Hey, hey! whoa!
come on. Annie, shirt on!
no boys!
what, uh, kind of party is this?
Dixon!
zip me.
I am so sorry that I wanted to mail you to Taiwan.
are you drunk?
S.t.l. baby! whoo!
Hi, Ethan! hey.
okay, um...
are you gonna come to my birthday party next week?
everybody's invited!
Yes.
Yes.
you're a mess.
Hi.
word on the street is there's a party going on.
did you tell people I was having a party?
Naw, I just told Navid and maybe a couple other people.
Oh, there's boys
now I have to give a crap what I look like.
you made it.
I got your text.
I'm not one to miss a party.
thought you might be thirsty.
I thought you were going to find me something stronger.
uh, yeah, no trouble, no trouble.
I got you covered. Be right back.
Hey, Adrianna.
so...
we should celebrate.
celebrate what?
your testicles have finally dropped?
no.
you getting out of rehab.
so, you just couldn't stay away from me,
could you?
you know it's like mother hubbard territory in here, right?
this girl's got nothing to eat.
what, so you're a food snob or something?
I prefer epicurean.
and you're cooking?
Yeah. you just gonna stand there or you gonna help me out?
yo, Ozzie.
Naomi, this is my buddy, Julio.
Hey, what's up? Hola.
who was that?
Naomi, it's Ozzie.
Yes, it is.
and that's Julio, his friend. Hi.
and this is us going.
excuse us for a second.
darling, listen. Very important.
Julio is Ozzie's as his wingman; I need you to be my winggirl.
okay, um, you want me to be your ring girl...
no, no, no, wing... winggirl.
okay. listen.
Julio's cute, right? He's cute.
you're single. help me out here.
um, he's cute, and I am very single.
not a boyfriend in sight.
perfect, fabulous. Okay, so what you're
going to do is keep Julio very busy while naomi get's Ozzie alone.
okay. I am her winggirl.
just winging it. Hello.
what's up, Adrianna?
okay, I hope this doesn't come off as totally tacky,
but could you hook me up with your dealer?
I don't do drugs anymore.
so you don't really need your dealer's number, do you?
fine.
I heard the slumber party turned into a party party,
so I thought I'd come by and check it out.
how are you doing? I'm cool.
okay, uh... do you want to go somewhere
a little more private like upstairs?
fine.
Yeah, let's go.
okay... cool.
Mmm. This is the most amazing
grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.
you're just drunk.
no, I'm not, actually.
so, who taught you how to cook?
my dad.
he worked in a bunch of kitchens,
saved his money and opened
a hole in the wall in echo park.
now that hole in the wall just got written up in la weekly,
so we're booked six weeks in advance.
awesome.
you know, you're not like anybody at school.
I'm like a lot of people at school.
just not people you hang out with.
you should travel outside your comfort zone.
Oh, is that what you're trying to do?
throw me off my game?
revealing choice of words.
you like games, huh?
Oh, you know, they're... pretty entertaining.
I don't like games, and I don't like people who play games.
yo, this party's dead, let's bounce.
what happened to Annie? Your girl?
dissed me - let's get out of here.
all right. let's get out of here.
Annie.
Annie!
I'm really supposed to be chatting with what's-his-name right now.
which what's-his-name? huh?
who? Julio.
who's Julio?
what's-his-name.
Naomi I am so happy
you decided to come to my party.
I've really missed hanging out with you.
well, that's pathetic... uh, but sweet.
I've missed you too.
awesome. Hey. why don't you catch me up on everything that's been going on, yeah?
you're sexy. Yeah.
I'm sleepy.
great.
okay.
okay, I'm... I'm gonna get you some water.
water sounds delicious.
I'll just be here... waiting.
I think I have a condom in my purse.
I didn't think that was going to happen tonight.
okay, let's do this.
what's going on?
you wanted to have sex; let's have sex.
but it's like you're not even into it.
come on, Navid.
I wasn't born yesterday.
you covered my rehab, so I'm paying you back.
is that what this is about?
there's no such thing as a free lunch.
okay, so because I paid for your rehab you think I expect sex?
is that the kind of guy you think I am?
kiss me.
Oh my god.
you know what? No, I'm done.
Navid, wait!
no, I'm out of here.
sorry to waste your time.
there you are!
I'm warning you, this floor is very wobbly.
um... okay, what happened?
I thought you were going to be my...
wing girl.
I'm sorry, Naomi.
it's okay.
I just don't get Ozzie.
he's so weird.
one second, we're flirting,
he's cooking, and everything's cool, and then...
all of sudden, he says, "i don't play games, I'm out of here."
I think I'm gonna try something radical with Ozzie.
what's that?
honesty.
it's not exactly me, per se.
but I am sick of the lies.
I mean, my dad's having an affair... no one tells me.
apparently, I have a brother.
no one tells me.
everyone's so full of it.
I'm really sick of being lied to.
I feel terrible.
I know. You do?
about your dad? Yeah.
sure, I get it.
I mean, it seemed like you really looked up to him.
Yeah.
I did.
when I was little, I thought he was just like superman or something.
and he turned out to be a liar like all the rest.
Yeah. I don't like liars.
Yeah, it's a bummer.
well, any-whoo,
I'm going to go fix my makeup.
apparently, there are still a bunch of boys around here.
excuse me coming through. Hey, cutie...
I heard there was some shirt swapping
going on earlier tonight.
you want to switch shirts with me?
only if I can do your nails and makeup first.
if that's what you're into.
Oh, my god, get away from me.
we need to talk.
Yeah, I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I've been talking and thinking
and we need to talk.
I can't lie like this.
listen, Annie, let's talk about this tomorrow when you're sober.
I'm not drunk.
actually, I think you are.
actually, no I'm not.
I'm totally not.
wait... hold on.
thanks for coming to get me.
how was the party? Was it ragin'?
things were starting to get pretty wild.
should we do something about it, or...?
I already called a colleague.
Hey, look at you everybody, listen
party's over.
let's go. Um...
come on.
Hey, um, dad...
got a call from a colleague.
said this party was out of control, and that Annie was inebriated.
Annie?
drunk? What?
uh, Principal Wilson, we collected everybody's keys, and already called a bunch of cabs.
Oh, honey.
Oh, daddy...
I drank too much.
Yeah, I can see that.
Oh, sweetheart, you stink.
I threw up.
Yeah, I figured.
you okay?
no.
no. I'm not okay.
it's your fault.
I'm not okay with you having a son.
and I'm not okay that you kept him a secret from us.
and I know... I know you didn't want it to affect us, dad, but it...
it affected me.
and you weren't honest.
for two months you were a liar.
and now i have to be honest, and I have to tell you that it made me so mad at you for not being honest, because secrets
they just make me feel so sick...
and wobbly.
and everything's a big mess now.
and I have vomit boots!
you have "vomit boots"?
Ah, you have vomit boots.
Oh, Sweetheart, I'm sorry that I wasn't honest.
and I'm sorry that I acted like it wouldn't be a big deal.
tried to do the right thing, and I didn't.
I'm not perfect, Annie.
I make mistakes.
that's okay.
are you going to let me get you out of here?
Yes, please.
we're going to have to stand up.
Hey, daddy, tell me the truth
am I in big trouble?
well, we all make mistakes.
Hey, dad, I made another mistake.
I cannot return these vomit boots.
Yeah, I kind of figured that.
Hey, dad...
you know who you remind me of?
who?
Superman...
only not so big into the tights, thank goodness.
I want back on the lacrosse team, Mr. Matthews.
my six-week suspension is up.
that's true, George, but your grades are down, right, and you know the school policy.
you need a 3.0 or higher to get back on the field.
then give me an "a" in your class.
why would I do that?
Oh, I can think of a pretty good reason.
he only saw us in a car together.
teachers cannot be alone off campus with students.
right, but...
kim's not a student.
I am as far as the kids know.
if anyone finds out who I am, I could be in serious trouble.
I'm sorry, Ryan, but I'm gonna have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence, effective immediately.
this is my job, Harry, my reputation.
what are the students going to think?
we will reinstate you as soon as Kimberly's work is done here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too, Ryan.
this is not fair.
you know, you got to take responsibility for your actions here.
what you did - it wasn't illegal, but...
it wasn't quite appropriate either.
can we talk?
Yeah.
look, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
okay?
it's just nice guys aren't usually interested in me, and I thought...
that I was a sleazebag.
Yeah. You know how many directors have lied to me and used me?
they act like these nice guys and...
you're a nice guy, Navid, and I guess I got scared.
Hey, that's terrible, but sometimes a nice guy who acts like he likes you is just a nice guy who likes you.
but you paid for my rehab.
because I care about you.
no, I, I know that now.
I just - I guess...
if we're going to be together...
wait.
you want to be with me?
well, yeah.
I kind of like spending time with you and you're...
kind of an amazing kisser.
I am?
but you don't, you don't have to do this.
you can, you can walk away right now.
how about we walk together?
that was pretty sappy.
Yeah, it's one of the side effects of being a nice guy.
I think I still have a hangover.
Yeah, you were a little...
a lot.
was a lot.
so you wanted to talk?
Yeah, um...
I don't want to keep us a secret anymore, Ethan.
it's wrong to lie to Naomi over and over again, and I think we just need to tell her and we just need to accept whatever consequences are going to come.
please?
okay.
if that's what you want.
Yeah, that's what I want.
Hi.
what's up?
I don't want to play games with you.
that's crafty.
the "I don't want to play games" game.
I'm serious.
ozzie, I like you.
I'll tell you what. ？This is my number.
you call me.
don't wait three days, don't wait a week.
just call me.
okay.
Hello?
Hello?
in memory of Ronn Cooney 1937-2008
we have a son together.
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.
if we're gonna be together... - wait. You want to be with me here?
you're kind of an amazing kiss .
I'm a cop, you dumbass!
I want back on the lacrosse team, Mr. Matthews.
I'm gonna have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence.
this is my job, harry. What are the students gonna think?
Jason broke up with me. My boyfriend from back home.
I don't think we can be friends if you're with Ethan.
I don't want to keep us a secret anymore, Ethan.
guys, guys, I heard they met over the summer.
Yeah, she's hot. I would definitely hit that.
her? What about him?
he's actually cute, in a... just-walked-off-a-catalogue kind of way.
they know? How do they all know?
didn't you get the text blast from George?
George? I blocked his number in eighth grade.
look at that - What's up, everybody -Dude, that's nuts.
when did this happen? - After Silver's party.
how much did you see?
I want details you - Dorks can't handle the details.
Oh, my god. George, you are so pathetic.
why don't you go back to rehab?
all right, people. Let's settle.
everybody take their seat. - So, Mr. Matthews has taken A... - Student's virginity?
leave of absence till we find a suitable substitute, I am your new teacher.
I understand we are working on Madame Bovary.
anybody want to tell me where we are? Anybody? Has she tried to kill herself yet?
Oh, God. Are you serious?
what? Are you serious?
um, when did this become the new principal's office?
Annie, thank you for joining us.
take your seat, so we can get started.
Annie. - Yeah?
you and me have to chat after school, okay? - Okay.
okay, then, Madame -- Right, it looks like we are on part three - I thought you were coming back tomorrow. - Uh, I took an earlier flight.
how are you? - Good.
aren't you supposed to be in class?
I have last period study hall.
and you're studying...
the hallway architecture. Thought it'd be a great art piece.
you know, the labyrinthine nature of the high school experience.
so? How was it? How's Dylan?
here, hold this for me.
well, Dylan is Dylan. You know, nothing's changed.
same cheekbones, same sideburns, same perfectly messy hairdo,and same cmitment issues.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
how are you doing? - Actually, really good.
I'm okay with him being there and me being here.
just gonna leave myself in to all possibilities, you know look at you with your advanced self-understanding. - I'm impressed. - Don't be.
I'm still a work in progress.
Hey, I saw that Harry was teaching Ryan's class. Is he out sick or something?
Yeah. Um, you missed some stuff when you were go.
Mr. Matthews, what do you say about the allegations?
no comment.
sir, I'd just like to hear your side of the story.
Navid, I respect your perseverance. okay, I really but I said no comment, and I meant it.
now go back to class before I break your camera.
I'm sure that's not the best way to rehabilitate your image, sir.
Navid, you want to give me a brief quiet, turn that thing off
Ryan... it isn't true, is it?
it's complicated.
no, it either is true or it is the guy I knew before I left wouldn't do something like this.
I just want you to tell me the truth. I don't want to believe the rumors.
why are you just running away like this?
I don't know what else I can say. Sorry.
so Dixon tells me you're rockin' the karaoke at your birthday party. I'm so gonna make him sing.
cool. Whatever.
yo, what's you doing - Nothing.
nothing. I'm just... I'm supposed to meet Naomi, so...
chill. She doesn't know anything about you and Ethan.
you know? How do you know?
I saw you guys at my party.
Naomi was going to walk in on you and the jock strap, but I distracted her. You're welcome, by the way.
wait, wait, wait, how do you know that she didn't. Because you're still alive.
you got to tell her soon.
I mean if she finds out from some random, it ain't gonna be pretty.
um, Naomi, I...
I'm a mess. I'm sorry.
my parents... my mom filed the divorce papers today.
it's official. -- I come from a broken home.
um, I'm so sorry.
my parents throw in the towel, my relationship with Ethan is over.
I swear to god, if I get another piece of bad, and I'm going to lose it.
I'm going to really lose
is there anything that I can do at least I could use the support of my friends right you guys feel like hitting up Robertson this afternoon.
I actually have to go blog about professor pervert, you know, but...
maybe some other time? - Later.
how about you, Annie?
get our hairs did, followed by some retail therapy?
sure, ok. - thank you.
you really are a good friend.
Hey, girly.
poker game at Meaghan's house tonight. Are you in?
Oh, sounds like fun.
Oh, that's cute in a Hannah Montana on acid kind of so 16, huh?
God, you've had an intense year.
Oh, it's been a seriously crazy, new world, new school, new friends - No boyfriend.
Yeah. I have to talk to you about...
that's a really hard thing. Trust me, I know.
I mean, since I broke up with Ethan, I've been so lonely.
what were you saying?
I really don't like this dress.
so, did you break up with Jason before you left wizard of ox ?
no, after I got here.
Oh, were you the dumper or the dumpee?
it was mutual. I mean, you can't fight geography, right?
that's too bad.
sounds like you guys didn't really get a chance to see what would have happened.
I mean, maybe you'd still be together if you hadn't moved out here.
maybe.
I don't know, part of me felt like the break up wasn't real, you know?
when things end because of distance and not because of some big relationship problem it's kind of hard to get closure.
be great if you could get closure and maybe see him again, yeah, I guess.
that's the dress.
that's the dress you should wear to the birthday you'll never forget. Guess who?
soft hands...
velvet voice...
Oh, my god! So...
I've been thinking. - About?
about you and me. And the fact that we are an "us" now.
"us"? That is my new favorite word.
we should do something together. Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.
What'd you have in mind? Like lunch? maybe a movie?
I was thinking maybe something a little bit more private.
well, uh... That's... that's really not going to work.
why not?
I have a lot of footage to edit. And, uh, it's about Mr. Matthews. It's, it's a really, really big story.
Oh, well, then I'll help you.
that way we can be hanging out together.
well, the only thing is, um... I can't have anybody else around when I'm doing this.
I kind of need to focus.
okay, so I should just go, then?
I'll call you later, right? - Okay, yeah.
Thanks. - Have fun.
Matthews dips in the kiddie pool?
I think it's my best blog yet.
and I love it when my readers quote it back to me.
you're just biased against Matthews 'cause he dated your sister.
well, yeah. It's like, what if Ethan rebounded with someone from junior high?
why do I care who Ethan dates?
it's not like he's with...
Ethan's with Annie?
Yes, but Dixon, I'm the only one that knows.
you cannot tell her that you know or she'll think that I told you, you know?
and besides, they haven't told Naomi yet, and if she hears from somebody else...
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ethan, so I was thinking...
I don't know what you're getting Annie for her birthday, but let's make sure she has an amazing day, okay?
I don't want to give her a chance to miss Jason.
uh, why would she? They're broken up.
Yeah, but it sounds like Jason's a really great guy, and they were really close, kind of like you and me, so...
Yeah, she seems to be doing okay.
Yeah, that's what i thought until yesterday.
what happened yesterday?
we were shopping, and she could not stop talking about jason.
I guess because the breakup was long-distance, they just didn't get closure. i don't know.
I just don't want her to feel alone on her 16th birthday, so let's make it extra special, yeah?
cool.
Yeah, you gave me the facts this morning, but did you really have to fire him?
I had no choice.
did he admit anything? -it doesn't matter what he said.
how could it not matter? it's his reputation on the line.
Kelly, allegations were made. as principal, i had to act on them.
you're telling me that you believe that ryan slept with a student?
I can't get into this right now, kelly. you have to trust me.
uh, is this a bad time? i can come back later.
no. kimberly, i was just...leaving hi, kimberly, nice to meet you. please sit down.
apparently, i'm not allowed back into any more classes until you sign this.
uh, yes, i wanted to talk to you. please sit down.
if this is about mr. matthews, i'm fine. everything's fine.
an aura of fineness surrounds me. -i'm glad to hear that.
but, given the situation i have trouble believing that you're really okay.
that's your problem, not mine.
are you angry at mr. matthews?
did he give you a bad grade, maybe fail you on some test? -no.
were you in a relationship with him?
why are you asking me? i had nothing to do with this.
maybe you expressed some feelings that he didn't return.
sounds like you're speaking from your own experience.
I mean, it would be understandable.
everybody in your class loves him. he's young, dynamic, not unattractive.
okay, i don't want to talk about this anymore.
can i go?
if i'm late for mr. hunt's class one more time, i'll be in detention for life.
come back if you want to talk some more.
hello.
Hello?
yoo-hoo, annie!
boy, do we have a surprise for you. -hey, guys.
Annie, you will never guess who's here.
Jason hi, annie.
you could crush mint on those abs.
happy birthday.
jason...in california. right here in our pool.
um, what are you doing here?
I was hoping to meet lauren conrad.
are these the right hills?
I would hug you, but i wouldn't want to get you all wet.
I wouldn't mind. -tabitha.
surprise!
what a surprise it is.
do you like your birthday present?
he's from you? you're from her?
no, i'm from kansas, but naomi paid for the shipping labels.
your sweet 16 birthday is the most important day of your life, second only to your wedding day, of course.
and no girl should spend that day without a man by her side.
Yeah, but...
I-I told her that we weren't together, but when she called, i just couldn't resist a chance to be with you on your big day.
well, it's all right, it's very good to see you.
well, i'm gonna get going. i know you guys must have a ton to catch up on before dinner.
dinner?
Yeah. i figured you would want jason to meet all of your friends, you know, before the big day and everything.
you and silver are in, right? i have to call ethan.
I think that's about it. i'll take care of everything. don't you worry about a thing.
you are so lucky to have made such great friends here.
Yeah. so lucky.
Adrianna. hi.
Hello, half of navid's face. is the other half home?
it's not a good time.
well, then when is?
I've called you a couple of times. i've texted you.
tried to hook up at school.
you've gone all woodward and bernstein 'cause of this whole matthews story.
can we talk about this later, please?
no, we can't. you've been acting really weird lately.
wait.
is... is there someone there?
Yeah.
my baby sister iman.
Adrianna, uh...
iman, this is adrianna. -hi, sweetie.
Navid. is this the young lady you told us about?
welcome, adrianna.
we've heard wonderful things about you.
come on in. please, please.
dad, no farsi, okay?
she's pretty, navid. way too pretty for you.
please don't embarrass me. keep your voice down, okay?
Adrianna, it's so wonderful to meet you!
come in, come in. will you join us for dinner?
Oh, mom, i think adrianna already has plans.
Yeah. i wouldn't want to impose.
Oh, nonsense. you have to meet atoosa's family.
this is shah-lah and masood. -nice to meet you.
my cousin alex and my beautiful daughter shar-joon.
hello.
Hi. i'm adrianna. -anoosh, his cousin.
Oh, just shoot me now. -my brother-in-law iraj and his wife roza.
you hanging in there?
Oh, you know. just, uh...walking roxy.
nobody else wants to be around me right now, so...
I'd be there if i could. -roxy, come here.
but i guess i screwed that up for both of us for a while.
I really didn't think it was going to turn out like this.
I mean, i didn't... i didn't think.
maybe i deserve it. -no, you don't.
in a moment of extreme masochism, i decided to read silver's blog.
you want to know the worst part, aside from the grammar?
these kids...
they think i'm a sleazeball. they really do.
you know the truth. that's what matters.
I don't know how you do it.
how you spend your life letting people think you're something you're not.
look, ryan, i know you've risked a lot for me.
I swear to you, i'm going to close this case as fast as i can.
then everything will be back to normal.
I'll be around.
do you guys always eat dinner like this?
no. not usually this small.
can i tempt you with some more khoresht?
dad, please. she's had enough. -no, thanks.
I couldn't possibly eat any more. i'm stuffed.
but you're so small! you need to put some meat on your bones!
thank you.
so, navid, why didn't you tell me you play the drums?
or the doumbek? right?
Oh, and he sings, too. -what?
Oh, yes. -really?
when he was little, he'd sing all day long.
please tell me you have pictures.
better. we have video.
you wouldn't want to see them because they're poorly edited, and you'd be wasting your time.
honey, he's right.
what are we thinking, talking about movies in front of such a talented actress?
we should be asking you for details of your exciting childhood.
more importantly, adrianna, how are you doing since leaving rehab?
mom.
it's fine.
I know that must have been very difficult for you.
I'm great. i'm fine. really.
thank you.
mom-mom, do you happen to have any dessert? maybe something to tempt ade with?
of course, of course. lydia?
bring the desserts, please.
I'm sorry. -it's okay.
I will have an iced tea and the Japanese pear salad with tiger prawns dressing on the side.
always.
those little details, you never seem to forget, do you?
I still remember the way Ethan takes his coffee.
you guys dated? - Yeah, for a long time.
we managed to stay friends like you and Annie.
of course I stayed friends with Annie.
I mean, it's not just any girl whose idea of having a good time is sneaking into a jayhawks game.
Hey, just that once.
I thought security was going to throw us out on our asses but she managed to sweet-talk the guard into letting us stay
by saying that I was a foreign exchange student that was leaving in the morning.
true story.
seems like the silliest moments between couples are the ones that linger the longest.
so, Jason, is this your first time to California?
Yes, but, hopefully, not the last. I'm actually thinking about going to UCLA.
you would be in L.A.
Yeah. I'm going to check out the campus while I'm here.
just like we talked about.
that was a long time ago.
don't you have two more years before college? What's the rush?
I thought I told you. I'm a senior.
I need to decide soon.
Yeah, UCLA is almost impossible to get into, though, dude.
I mean, you have some backup schools lined up?
Jason is top of the class, all-state football.
ucla is his...
backup school - You're smart, handsome and athletic.
distance wouldn't be enough for me to let go of this one.
I'm parched. I'm just going to go check on that iced tea.
so, more details.
how long have you known Annie? - Since grade school.
we lived right around the block from each other.
seems like our lives always seemed to cross.
that is so sweet!
I got to go to the bathroom. Excuse me, please.
so, uh, anything new back home?
I know. I'm sorry.
Naomi planned this whole dinner before I knew anything about it.
I thought you weren't even in contact with Jason anymore.
I haven't been since we broke up.
did you guys actually break up or just take a break?
we broke up cross my heart. I was there.
then why is he considering colleges based on where you live?
look, we started dating in junior high.
Jason probably just assumed that we'd always be together.
and maybe because of the fact that we broke up on the phone, he didn't get enough closure.
Yeah, so I've heard. did you get enough closure?
Ethan, I want to be with you, nobody else.
then I think you should tell him about us.
I don't want to hurt him.
and he's only here for a couple of days and then he's gone. Why make him feel bad?
because I want him to know that we're together.
and I wanted Naomi to know the same thing, but you didn't want to upset her.
how is that different?
Hey, is everything okay? - Yeah, great.
good, well, your iced tea has arrived, so you don't have to really wait here for it anymore.
great.
you are becoming one of my all-time favorite customers.
Aw, aren't you sweet?
you're under arrest for drug possession with the intention to sell.
you gotta be kidding me.
come on. after all those times I hooked you up?
just can't trust anyone these days.
so do you want to do the ten years I can nail you on right now,
or do you want to vouch me to your boss?
give me a sit-down and let him know how I'm your newest dealer?
fancy meeting you here.
I know, nine bedrooms in the house and I still have to share a bathroom with Dixon.
Oh, poor Dixon, 'cause as I recall, you were never really good at sharing.
Hey, only where French fries are concerned.
you know, this isn't how I pictured us on the eve of your 16th birthday, but I'm glad I'm here.
it was nice of you to come.
Yeah, but weird, too.
Yeah, right? - Yeah.
I'm, I'm sorry. Does that mean...?
no, not at all. Actually, it's exactly what every ex-boyfriend / houseguest want to hear.
well, you know, even with all the weirdness,
I'm just glad to have someone to hang out with who doesn't make me feel like I have to try so hard.
what do you mean?
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just I feel like I need to be so on all the time.
I mean, if they saw me hanging out in plaid pajamas, It'd be, like,"ooh, social suicide"
I'd forgotten how much fun you were to be around, Annie.
you're sweet.
you know what? That's a lie.
I didn't forget. I tried.
believe me, I tried.
but Annie, our relationship...
it was something special.
yo, Jason, Come on! let's go!
Hey, come on. I already set the game up.
we're battling some dudes from Michigan, and they already talking trash.
come on, man. let's do this.
good night.
Jason, can I get you anything else? - No, ma'am, thank you.
you know, when you're at UCLA, you should really come by and see us. - Absolutely.
now, do you need any recommendations? I'd be happy to write you one.
there is the birthday girl!
happy birthday. - Thank you.
I cannot believe that you are 16 years old.
okay, I am late for a photo shoot. Happy birthday.
good-bye, my love. Bye, sweetie.
Bye, Jason.
I got an early meeting as well. Happy birthday.
love you, too, baby. Nice to see you.
good luck on your tour. -Thank you, thank you.
uh, what are you gonna do, one of those star homes tours?
campus tour, UCLA.
if we're living close to each other again. Maybe things might work out a little different for us.
um, Jason, Um, I mean, who knows if we'd still be together if I hadn't moved?
maybe, Sure.
but we broke up, and I moved on.
so we're really over. - Yeah.
what about the kiss? I...
you totally took me by surprise.
and I am so sorry if I misled you in any way.
okay.
maybe I'll just go home.
no, please, Don't. stay.
I mean, the truth is, we were friends for a long time before we started dating, and I want all my friends at my party tonight.
so, come on. you can't deny a girl's birthday wish, right?
I'm sorry. I was awkward last night.
no, no, no, I'm sorry.
my mom had no right to bring up that whole rehab thing.
Yeah, she did. your parents paid for it.
but it's bad enough that they had to bore you with those stupid stories.
it was cute.
but how many servings of khoresht Do they expect one person to eat, right?
see, this, this is exactly why I didn't want you to meet my family because they can be lame at times.
well, actually, I thought they were lovely.
you're just saying that to be nice.
no, seriously, I wish my family was that big and close.
yeah?
so, yeah, obviously, I was a little embarrassed when your mom brought up the whole rehab thing.
but the fact that they knew the entire time,
and they still treated me like a member of the family.
that was incredibly cool.
so we are good.
I like you, Navid, okay? And the more I know, the more I like.
you just have to be honest with me.
about everything?
everything.
can you do that?
I'm a virgin. - What?
What?! - See, funny, right?
I didn't want to disappoint you, okay? 'Cause I figured you'd bolt, so, uh...
so you've been keeping your distance. - Yeah.
I wanted, I wanted it to be special.
I thought you expected something different, and you are so...
I'm not expecting anything.
no? - No.
except, um, A little less of that, um -- What's your mom's favorite dish?
Khoresht. -Khore, khore...
I can't say it! -Back of the throat.
Khoresht. Khoresht.
you got it.
Hey, Annie.
so, Jason seems like a pretty awesome guy.
he's clearly still into you.
maybe you guys should give it another shot.
Yeah, um, Naomi, about that, thank you so much for flying Jason in.
Hey, let's go out again tonight. It was so much fun last night.
we can go to the beach, maybe surfing.
let me get back to you on that.
Hey, are you still mad about last night?
define mad.
look, I know the whole having my current boyfriend go to dinner with my ex-boyfriend
when my current boyfriend isn't really a boyfriend at all. Thing is beyond the charts strange, but...
no, what's strange is being in a situation that's so complicated that we can't even tell people we're together.
does that make you happy? - No.
me, either.
I've done complicated, Jnnie, I didn't like it.
I want things between us to be simple, you know?
I want that, too.
great, then let's clean this whole mess up and tell Naomi and Jason the truth.
what?
I just, I just want to wait until Jason gets home to tell him.
Why? You don't still have feelings for him...
no, no.
um, no, but I think he still has them for me.
okay, don't freak out, but Jason kissed me last night.
perfect, yeah.
come on, Ethan. It just happened.
you know why? ' Cause he thinks you're still available.
I didn't kiss him back.
that was big of you. Have fun with Jason.
I never thought my star detention guest could be on time for anything.
only when it's important. This is important.
you know, you seem like a good kid.
seriously, dude, I don't want to hear it.
all I want to do is make some cash. - Get a job at Starbucks.
look, if you're not sure about me, then just say it.
Eric said he'd vouch for me and that you'd hook me up.
but if you bailed, then tell me now 'cause I got clients waiting.
you have no idea how long I've waited for this.
it takes a special kind of sleazebag to sell drugs to kids.
you're under arrest.
hands where we can see them.
thank you. No, no, seriously, thank you, Annie.
happy birthday. You're the best.
thank you, thank you, everyone for being here to celebrate my darling Annie's sweet 16.
Annie, I know this isn't the ordinary birthday dedication, but you're not ordinary girl.
that's why I love you.
Oh, my god, she is so amazing.
Oh, I know, right? She's totally rocking it.
Annie, I told you we should have gone first.
now we're going to get a vocal beat-down by grandma Wilson.
let's go find a song.
we'll be back. - We're gonna go make out.
darling. Karaoke...a surprising smash, Kansas.
so where's Ethan?
he must be running late, I guess.
you should call him. -No. um, don't worry about it.
gee, you'd think he'd be here.
okay, where is Ethan, anyway?
um, he might not be coming. We got in a bit of a fight.
but it's your birthday. - Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna go get some air.
don't you have a party inside?
I'm not really in the partying mood.
listen, I'm... really sorry, Annie.
you were nothing but honest with me about that kiss, and...
I was a jerk.
I would have gone with jackass, but okay.
the truth is, I had no right to get mad at you when I was the one who got us into this whole mess
by saying that we should keep Naomi in the dark.
Yeah, well, you didn't do it alone.
I tried to tell her a bunch of times and just totally chickened out.
and I guess I didn't have to hook up with you the minute you were on the rebound.
that's true. But I am glad you did.
there is going to be a cake soon, and on it, there will be 16 candles for me to blow out.
and my only wish is to be with you without all these secrets.
that's what I want, too.
Jason told Dixon he's going to leave on the red-eye tonight back to Kansas city.
so I kind of wanted to tell him the truth before he's gone.
and Naomi, too. - Okay.
happy birthday.
is it the pentapus?
so much for the element of surprise.
well, you know what, I'm kind of over surprises, so...
well, then I should probably just tell you that I'm about to kiss you.
you have to see this. Come here.
she really has moved on.
Annie swore to me that they weren't together. I can't believe she would lie like that.
I just... I can't believe...
I'm sorry.
looks like I caught you on your way out... of town.
what are, what are you doing here?
Harry called me.
so you know I'm not the devil.
I never thought that.
are you sure? 'Cause most people did.
so where are you headed? - Honestly, I don't know.
I'm just going to go to lax and let the fates decide.
Ryan, this will all blow over, you know that, right?
your real story will be in the paper. It'll be all over the news.
and you can go back to teaching.
I just need to get away, you know, take some time and clear my head.
you know, get out of town and figure out what I'm doing.
but thanks for stopping by. It was good seeing you.
maybe when you get back, we can get together.
kimberly, hey. - Hey, Kelly.
I can call you Kelly, right? - Yeah, of course.
am I interrupting something? - No, no. I was just leaving.
have a nice trip. - Thanks.
how are you doing? - I'm good.
do you think Naomi's up here? - Jared saw her go upstairs.
Oh, my god.
I...I... I can't believe this. How could you do this to me?
how could you do it to me is the question, Annie.
I saw you making out with Ethan at school.
wait, you...you knew they were together?
so, I just figured. Hey, if my good friend Annie, who I specifically asked not to date Ethan,
could make out with my ex. What's stopping me from fooling around with hers?
payback's a real bitch, isn't it?
An-Annie, wait!
you pathetic bitch.
after this, my mother's going to do her big closing number.
I think we should pull the plug on karaoke, and get out the cake.
Oh, but the kids really seem to be enjoying her. I mean, how bad could it be?
I think that it involves pasties.
I'll get the birthday girl.
I'm sorry, but I saw you and Ethan outside kissing, and it just freaked me out a little bit.
I mean, you could have told me that you guys were together.
why'd you hide that? - I...
I didn't want to hurt you.
so instead you played Naomi's game?
the girl that I knew back in Kansas was above that.
you don't understand, okay? The rules are different here.
but that doesn't mean you have to be.
I get to the airport.
I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday.
all right, everybody. Nicely done.
time to sing to the birthday girl.
sweetie, are you okay?
you... outside now!
any requests?
just so I am clear. Everything you have done-- the whole shopping trip,
flying Jason out here, all of that was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?
Absolutely. But if you want Ethan, you can have him.
I wanted to see you miserable and I got my wish. - That's sick.
Oh, don't give me that holier-than-thou routine. You're no innocent here.
okay, I should have told you about Ethan. I will grant you that.
I wanted to tell you. - But you didn't, did you?
no, instead you tried to play me for a fool. You backstabbing, duplicitous bitch!
okay, I was trying to spare your feelings!
I knew you would be upset, and so I was trying to find the right time.
but you didn't even like Jason, you just went after him to hurt me.
you deserved it.
I am so sick and tired of all you people who won't tell me the truth.
first it was my dad and his mistress, And then my mother with her son...
none of that was my fault.
all I know is that before you moved here, my life was perfectly fine!
no, before I moved here, you were just lying to yourself and getting away with it.
you'd rather have people fear you then be honest with you.
you're manipulative and cruel and the only person that you should be blaming for feeling so alone right now is you.
that all you got, Kansas?
listen to me.
being your friend -- I'm over it.
I already beat you to it. - Excuse me.
sorry to bother you ladies.
who are you? - Who are you?
my name's Sean. I'm the son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark.
I'm pregnant.
I just need some time to think, all right?
the doctor is gonna want to know
who the father is.
guess who?
ty.
some things you say
have the power to hurt people, you know?
Yeah, I think I do.
so I'm gonna break up with you.
you should audition, too!
come on. otherwise,
we'll never get to see each other.
I'm really not for the cast-and-crew dinner.
the whole point of me doing this play
was so we could hang out together.
you go ahead.
I changed my mind.
all right. be there in two.
Ethan?
Ethan! We already go down this hallway?
I think we already been down this one.
slow down slow down -Mom, I can't, okay?! what if he's not okay? -hang on, hang on.
we are looking for Ethan Ward.
he would have been admitted about an hour ago.
Ethan, oh, my god, you're okay!
are you okay? you look okay. -yeah, i'm fine.
I'm so, so glad.
are you in pain?
just when you squeeze that tight.
Oh, I'm sorry.
you had us worried, buddy.
I... yeah, I'm sorry.
no, it's okay. we're just happy you're all right.
I am. just bruised and shaken,
but the woman in the other car,
Rhonda Kimball, I guess is her name, she's in surgery.
and if she doesn't make it... -no, stop.
I'm sure she's gonna be okay, too.
do you mind if we just wait here.
Yeah. -that's fine, yeah.
of course.
it's gonna be okay.
you have to tell Ty.
he's responsible, too, Ade.
I'm just waiting for the right moment.
Yeah, well, the right moment was about two hours ago.
and two lamb schwarmas ago.
stop eating that crap.
Hey, i'm eating for two.
I'm aware of that. but tell him.
Hey, Ty.
there's my leading lady. -Hi.
Um...do you have sec?
for my queen? come on.
so, what's going on?
there's no easy wayto say this.
I'm pregnant.
and it's your baby.
what?
Yeah.
I though you were, you know, on the pill?
well, yeah, sometimes I took those pills.
sometimes I took other pills.
you'll just...get it taken care of.
it's too late for that...medically.
great.
anyway, I thought you'd like to know.
this can't be happening.
I can't believe I didn't see that stop sign.
Hey, it happens. that's why they call them "accidents.
I-I wasn't paying attention, and I was on the phone. -with me.
I shouldn't have called.
okay, stop it, you two. this isn't helping anybody.
I'm looking for the family of Rhonda Kimball.
that's us.
your daughter has a collapsed lung.
she'll make a full recovery.
she's stabilizing now.
looks like she's gonna be okay.
you ready to head home?
uh, you guys go.
my mom's on her way, so I'll just wait for her here.
we'll wait with you then.
actually, I wouldn't mind having a few minutes alone.
I have to apologize to Rhonda.
I gotta figure out what to say.
okay.
we'll see you later.
well, call me after you talk to her, okay? -yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. sorry. Gentle.
Hey, uh, is he okay?
Yeah. spooked, but fine.
thank god.
guess there's, uh, something in the air tonight or something.
what do you mean?
uh, just really hasn't been a good night.
you want to tell us what it is or should we play charades?
all right. Me and Silver broke up.
what? -why?
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
it's-it's cool.
you know, i'm...really not into that whole unrequited love thing.
you know? so I had to get out before one of us got hurt.
or more hurt.
but, anyhow...
I don't want to talk about it, so that's it.
I'm glad Ethan's okay.
and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
all right, buddy.
good night.
night. -Good night.
it's a proven fact that male brains mature slower than female brains.
trust me, ty's, like, 11 in girl years.
I don't know what I expected him to say...
Oh, are you gonna finish that?
Ade, you gotta tell your mom.
listen, if perez hilton has taught us anything,
it's that you can't hide a baby bump forever.
I'm not gonna hide it forever.
just until I figure out what I'm gonna do.
well, maybe she could he -my mom?
Yeah, right.
she could surprise you.
she'll surprise me if she doesn't kick me out.
I'm practically her personal atm.
and something tells me
I'm not gonna be booking a lot of parts once I start to show.
that's totally gonna suck.
I don't know what's gonna be worse, like,
my mom finding out or everyone at school.
Oh, everyone at school.
I mean, it'll be a constant barrage of whispers and rumors,
and this is not helping. I'm sorry.
no, it's true.
it's... it's gonna be totally humiliating.
like, i just, i just finished being rehab girl
and now I have to be pregnant girl.
I'm just so sick of reading about
how screwed up I am on the bathroom walls, you know?
Adrianna?
mom, hi.
I've spent all day picking up after people at the restaurant.
I hope you don expect me to clean up this mess.
no, i'll clean it.
Hello, Constance.
Hi, Naomi.
don't you have a curfew?
I'm staying at the hotel, so, no.
so, did you hear about the toothpaste commercial?
Yeah, i did.
I didn't get it.
but I got the lead at the school play.
damn.
that was a national spot.
well, i-i know. I tried.
Yeah.
I can see all the effort.
laying around eating milk and cheese.
body weight rise bofore success
thanks for coming.
I just wanted to apologize for my reaction last night.
I was in shock.
and from what I remember, i didn't handle it very well.
it's okay. I kind of blindsided you.
no, Ade, it's not okay.
I should be more sensitive to
what you're going through and how you're feeling.
how are you feeling?
emotional.
hungry all of the time.
well, look, I talked to my parents last night.
you did?
well, sure, I mean...
well, sure, I mean we can't get through this by ourselves, right?
right.
what did they say?
well, they were shocked and mad but after two very dry martinis,
they calmed down a bit and decided they'd help us figure it out.
what did your mom say?
um, pretty much the same thing.
well, my parents want to have you guys over for dinner.
me and my mom?
Yeah, I don't know if that's really a good idea.
well, they're very insistent.
they want me to take responsibility and so do i.
we're in this together, Ade.
all right.
now, if I order some chili cheese fries, would you share 'em?
Yeah. -all right.
I'm starved.
you know what we to get over Silver and Adrianna, right?
Yeah, i know exactly what to do.
find a rogue scientist who's willing to experiment
with the whole eternal sunshine thing?
no.
the only way to get over a girl .
is to get a new girl.
hell to the yes.
Oh, man, who am I kidding?
I'm never gonna get another girl.
dude, dude, what is wrong with you?
I'm bad at the whole dating thing, man.
Nah, no, you're not.
it took me 11 years to get up the nerve to ask out Adrianna.
Yeah, that is a little pathetic.
you know, maybe the whole mind-erasing thing isn't such a bad idea.
just, dude, i'm just saying, you know? 11 years?
nice. - Geez.
Rhonda?
Ethan Ward is here to see you.
Hi. - Hi.
look, i know this sounds weird to just come out and say it,
but I'm the guy that hit you, and I'm so sorry.
and I know that doesn't mean anything,
but I just wanted to say it.
we talked to the police.
and we're not gonna pursue any legal stuff,
if that's why you're here.
no, no, it's not, but you could if you wanted to
because it was totally my fault.
I was on the phone and I didn't see the stop sign, and...
you know, the important thing is that we're both all right.
you have a punctured lung.
honestly, it sounds a lot worse than it really is.
I promise.
Thanks.
I should really be thanking you.
I mean, you got me out of
this killer math test on wednesday.
Oh, yeah?
what, what school do you go to?
what?
you're in high school, right?
Yeah.
I go to west beverly.
I'm in your french class.
Oh, i'm really sorry.
sorry for what?
sorry for not knowing who I am?
why would you?
I'm not cool.
I'm not popular.
you obviously just livein your own little bubble,
where people like me don't even register.
that's not true.
when was the last time you talked to somebody
who wasn't running for homecoming queen
or didn't play varsity sport?
we exist, Ethan.
and some of us are really interesting people.
I'm not like that.
I'm getting really tired, you should probably go.
mom, dad...this is Adrianna.
Louise Collins. it is so good to meet you.
nice to meet you, mrs. Collins.
please, call me, Weezy.
Mrs. collins is my mother-in-law,
and between you and me, she's a real pill.
I heard that. Wlliam.
thanks for coming by.
well, thanks for having me.
Where's your mother, dear?
Ah, she wanted to come,
but she couldn't get off work last minute.
we'll meet another time, i'm sure.
sit. please.
Yes, make yourself comfortable.
we're still a few minutes from dinner.
so...
what does your mother do?
she's, uh... in the restaurant business.
tough work. long hours.
I used to bus tables at the club in high school
hardest job I ever had.
y-y-you were a busboy?
why is that so hard to believe?
Oh, because neither of us
has ever seen you pick up a damn thing in this house.
So...shall we get down to it?
sure.
how are you feeling, dear?
Oh, um... I'm okay.
good, because that's the most important thing
you have to take care of yourself.
do you have a good doctor?
not yet. but I went to a clinic, and everything looks fine.
first thing, we'll have to get you a doctor.
and don't you worry. we'll take care of the cost.
don't argue with him, dear，he's very stubborn.
we want to help you, Adrianna.
you're only 16, you shouldn't have to deal with this alone.
dinner is ready.
Oh, terrific. shall we?
let's...
real insight into character isn't found onstage.
it's found in rehearsal.
therefore, you will only be allowed one absence. one.
Oh, i'm sorry.
uh...you guys are using this room.
I-I forgot.
sorry.
I'm passing out schedules.
please commit them to your brains and your blackberries.
any conflicts, say them now.
or forever hold your peace.
so when are you meeting my mom?
in an hour.
will you call me after?
So...do you think I should talk to her or no?
who? - Miss Casey.
I-I want to ask her what I did wrong in the audition,
but I'm afraid that if I ask her,
she'll think that I thought that I should get the lead,
which, which I did not think,
and I don't want her to think that I thought.
what do you think?
I think that you're over thinking it.
Really?
should I send her balloons?
to miss Casey?
no, no. Rhonda.
I mean, to apologize for yesterday.
balloons?
what's wrong with balloons?
nothing.
um, just kind of impersonal.
well, how am I supposed to get her something personal?
I don't know her.
Hi, Adrianna.
I'm dr. Klein.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
and you must be her mother?
uh, no. my mom had to work, so she couldn't make it.
I'm a close friend. - Gotcha.
it says here, there's a history of drug abuse.
um, yeah, but I'm clean now.
even so, i'd like her to have an amnio, though.
what's an amnio?
under local anesthesia, we run a thin needle
into the amniotic sacand extract a little fluid.
and from that fluid,
we can test the fetus for abnormalities.
normally we don't do it for a girl your age, but...
with your history, i really think it's a good idea.
I mean, god forbid any thing's wrong, we'll know.
okay. - Great.
first things first.
you need an ultrasound.
lift up your shirt.
okay, Adrianna, there's your baby.
those are the legs...and the arms.
that's the nose...and an ear.
it just... it just... didn't seem real before.
I know.
I know.
thanks for all your help, Ty - My pleasure
thanks again for all the maternity colth.
you're welcome, honey.
before you go, i wanted to give you this.
peaceful vista? - It's in new mexico.
once you to start to show, you can go there,
and stay until you deliver the baby.
it's supposed to be gorgeous.
a friend of a friend's went,
and she said it was like a spa vacation.
it looks beautiful.
Oh, and this is for your mother, dear.
it's a legal contractjust laying out
the terms of our financial commitment.
it says we'll pay for your stay, and after,
we'll arrange for the adoption of the child.
the adoption?
well, there are a lot of deserving people
who can't have kids, and what other choice is there?
I guess I hadn't really thought about it.
well, i guess it's time to start.
have your mother look it over.
and if the terms are agreeable,
which I'm sure they will, then that will be that. okay?
okay.
what are you doing here?
well, last time I was here, you were watching tv,
but there was nothing on, so...
I'm loaning you my dvd player.
but then I ran into a problem
when I was trying to pick up movies
because I didn't know if you would like action-adventure
Or...comedy,
or romance, or horror... or, uh, romantic horror,
which isn't a popular genre,
but apparently, it does exist,
and apparently, the swedes have mastered it.
and oh, i wanted to get you snacks,
because movies without snacks suck,
but I didn't know if you like sweet or salty,
so I got you pretzels and... chocolate.
I also got chocolate - covered pretzels
in case you like sweet and salty together.
Ethan...
what is this about?
I'm... I'm just trying to get to know you.
so, what's it going to be?
uh, "mission impossibleor the wedding planner"?
uh, "the wedding planner."
and maybe some chocolate-covered pretzels.
want to stay and watch?
Oh, you have somewhere to be.
just play rehearsal.
but we're allowed to blow one off,
so yes, i'll stay.
as long as you're okay with the occasional "this-is-such-a-lame- chick-flick" commentary.
Yeah.
when you meet a girl, you need to passively insult her,
thus actively demonstrating your disinterest, "Which has the effect of elevating " Said girl's interest in you.
are you kidding me with this?
that book worked for my cousin, avi.
he's swimming in chicks.
and he is funky-looking.
uh, all right.
mm, i'm gonna give it a try.
do your thing, bro.
do my thing, bro.
Hey, what's up?
not much.
you know, you'd be really beautiful if you didn't have that bad hairdo.
get lost, dweeb!
amazing.
amazing.
I wish I had it on video, so I can put it on youtube.
shut up.
what was that all about?
um, well, Navid has a book.
dude, don't sell me out.
the credo?
you did not read this disgusting, insulting book.
no. Navid, have you met Christina?
no.
Hi. - hi.
nice to meet you. - nice to meet you.
so you're trying to meet a girl?
well, if you want to meet a girl, don't trust that.
you know, you should trust someone who kind of knows how a girl thinks.
me.
Oh, you two are really clueless.
you need to come to my friend's party.
hot band, hot girls-- I'll hook you up.
no, mm-hmm. hold on. wait a minute. no, just him.
I don't need your help with no ladies.
believe me, if Dixon wants a girl, dixon gets a girl.
and not if "Dixon" talks in the third person like a tool.
Yeah, right.
touch? fair enough.
hot stone massages.
they have hot stone massages.
have you looked at this? - no, not yet.
Ooh, they have, like, a ski resort, like, half hour way
I don't think you'd be doing a lot of skiing during your third trimester.
you might be right, but I would be doing a lot of seaweed mud masks, though.
sure, you'll just have to sign away all rights to said issue.
there are a lot of deserving people who can't have kids.
Yeah, i know. I saw juno, too.
look, this has a nondisclosure agreement.
this says you can't talk about the fact that ty's the father.
I guess that's okay.
it also says that you can't talk about
the events and circumstances leading up to
and including the pregnancy and birth of said issue.
ever.
basically, what we're doing now--totally illegal.
I'm sure that's just overzealous lawyer talk or something.
I don't know, Ade.
this thing reads like a friggin' gag order.
I mean, it has serious damages if you don't comply.
what is your problem?
okay, this is a plan, finally.
why do you have to be so negative?
I'm not being negative.
I don't want you to be taken advantage of.
Yeah, well, the collinses aren't like that.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna clear things up.
Hey, Ty, it's Ade calling.
you're probably in a fierce game of dragon fury right now.
but if you can just tear youself away for just a minute that would be great.
uh, there's just some things in the contract that
I find a little weird. Um, not a big deal.
I just want to clarify them, so, um, give me a call.
and yeah.
Oh, say hi to your parents for me.
okay, bye.
happy?
don't-don't push yourself, okay?
who are you, usain bolt? you just had surgery.
I got to pass the old guy.
Ah, the competitor kicks in. okay.
no, his gown keeps opening and I'm sick of seeing his ass.
Oh, all right. yeah, no, you're right.
all right, let's pass him on the outside,
and pretend it's like the last minutes of the game, okay?
I should tell you that sports talk is pretty much lost on me.
I've never been to a game or a match or anything sports-related.
so, uh, maybe I'm not the only oneliving in a bubble then?
you're right, but no more.
what, all sports all the time?
all new experiences all the time.
you know how they say your life flashes
before your eyes in an accident?
mine did, and all is saw was a bunch of jazz band rehearsals.
Yeah, all I saw was one long sportscenter reel.
there's so much more out there.
there's things I haven't tried, things I haven't eventhought about trying.
Yeah, I always wanted to learn to play the guitar.
then you should.
and go skydiving?
let's sign up.
I've always wanted to go camping.
Oh, that's easy enough.
I know, i just...i always assumed there'd be time, you know?
I'm not gonna live like that anymore
I'm gonna live like there's no time and that every day could be my last.
carpe diem.
exactly.
miss Casey. hi.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that ethan wasn't at rehearsal today.
he must have lost the rehearsal time oh, it's fine. everyone can miss one.
is that all? - yeah.
no, no, um...it's not that I expected to get the lead in the play
because I absolutely did not, but I love acting,
and I really want to get better because this is really what I've always wanted to do.
well, your passion will certainly work in your favor,
and an acting class will help as well.
you have talent, annie.
it's just that acting is craft.
you know, just like anything else, like blacksmithing.
you know, you're not born knowing how to be a blacksmith, right?
you have to study, learn your craft.
I'll make you a list of some good acting classes, okay?
have a good night.
thank you.
Weezy, hi.
Adrianna, hello.
what are you...doing here?
well, ty said you called with some concerns.
so I thought it was time to sit down with your mother.
I was going to leave her a note with my number,
but I saw her car, and I thought perhaps she was home.
Oh, you know, it's just... it's not really a great time right now.
you must be Constance
sorry to just drop in on you out of the blue,
but I thought we should talk about the situation the kids are in.
especially since it is rather pressing, don't you agree?
certainly seems that way.
it is... it is pressing.
Um...because, uh... well...um...
because the baby is due in five months.
naturally, i was a little surprised
when adrianna said she had some concerns about the contract.
remind me about your specific concerns.
um, well, the collinses have been so nice.
they've offered to pay for the entire stay at peaceful vista.
and the place looks great.
and from what I hear, new mexico...seems nice.
it's just not being able to talk about what happened,
that part of the contract seems kind of severe.
Adrianna, you and Ty have your whole lives in front of you.
this is not something we want to follow you around.
I mean, do you really want everyone to know what you've done?
well, no.
but I'm not exactly sure what "done"is going to be yet.
I mean, i'll probably give it up for adoption.
probably?
you're a 16-year-old girl. what other choice is there?
let's look at the facts. you had a drug problem.
you got yourself pregnant.
then you put us all into a position where it was too late to terminate.
do you really think you're responsible enough to be a mother?
that's not fair.
Yes, i did those things, but that's because I was using,
not because of who I am.
I'm actually really responsible.
Adrianna, stop talking.
my daughter is someone who has been bringing home
a paycheck since she was five years old.
someone who didn't know how to ride a bicycle,
but when the role demanded that she ride one,
she learned in an hour.
and yes, she had a drug problem,
but she also kicked that drug problem, and cleaned herself up
and stayed in school and got the lead in the play.
so let's just be clear.
she is very responsible.
and listen to me this is not your choice.
it's hers.
please, spare me the supportive mother act.
you didn't even know she was pregnant five minutes ago.
Adrianna, sweetheart, don't be foolish.
don't you want your child to have a better life than you have?
that's it.
we're done.
pardon me?
take your notes and your contracts and
your superior attitude and take a hike.
wow, that was... - i just need some time to think.
Hey, what can I get you?
um, a turkey burger.
Hey, is dixon working today?
no.
is that for here or to go?
to go. thanks.
mom, i'm so sorry.
no, i'm sorry.
that woman was right about one thing.
I've been a pretty crap mom.
no, you haven't.
I mean...you have sometimes, but...you've done good stuff.
you bought me a sled. remember?
and you said there wasn't going to be any snow.
so I begged and begged for it, and for christmas, you got me a sled.
Yeah, well...I could have taken you
to where there was some snow.
sledding in grass was fun.
it's just sometimes
it's like you don't see me as a daughter.
more like a cash machine.
you got to understand it's been hard.
raising you alone is not how I wanted to do it.
and when you started acting
I mean, you liked it,
and things just got so much easier
once you booked jobs.
doesn't matter.
just trust me, I understand
why you didn't want to tell me.
I wanted to tell you.
I just... I thought you'd kick me out.
Yeah, well, you are not going anywhere.
cause you and me...we're in this together.
Really?
and at first, you know, I was all insulted.
I mean, blacksmithing?
but-but then I got over myself and I
looked at the classes she suggested
and they're actually taught
by all these incredible teachers.
so anyway, I filled out the application last night, and...
Annie, there's more to life than theater.
Yeah, I know that.
but I love it.
Yeah, but I mean maybe you'd love other things, too.
I don't want to love other things.
Ethan, where is this coming from?
I've been talking just with Rhonda
about how short life is,
and how there are so many options out there.
you know, things we never even consider doing
because we pigeonhole ourselves
at such a young age to...
Yeah, well, I like my pigeonhole.
all right, that's... that's fine.
then I won't talk to you about it.
no, you can talk to me.
it's just the accident...it changed things.
I mean I feel like it woke me up or something.
like it jolted me out of my bubble.
um, bubble?
the bubble that I'm still in.
come on, Annie.
I'm just saying... I feel different.
but good different, though. -Okay.
well, I'm glad that you feel good different,
And...but anyway, um,
I got to get to play practice.
so I'll see you at 6: 30 for the eunuch scene?
Yeah.
yo, how'd your friend
get Carolina liar to play?
her sister dates Eric, the bass player.
so, you two see any ladies
you're interested in?
I'm looking. I'm looking. Don't rush me.
she looks pretty. And not pregnant.
preg... pregnant? - No, no, no.
I meant she has a good body.
uh, do you know her?
Oh, Nika Raygani? she's cool.
talk to her. And be yourself.
trust me. I can't do that.
that's why I have the book.
dude, look. You can do this. All right?
Hey, if I can do this, I need a wingman.
fine. If I'm going, then you gotta go, too.
come on.
Hey, Nika. - Hi.
I'd like you to meet Navid and Dixon.
they're friends of mine.
Hi. - Hi. - Okay.
Hi. - Hi. What's up?
I'm really uncool. - Excuse me?
I-I've been racking my brain back there
to think of something cool to say,
but, uh, Christina right here told me to be myself,
so the truth is I'm just really uncool.
so, i'm not the kind of guy
who's gonna say some sarcastic,
ironic comment, right?
and I don't even know
the best restaurants, right, buddy?
Yeah.
and I might even drop an
occasional world of warcraft reference
before I remember that, not, you know,
everybody plays massively
multi-player online role-playing games.
so, I just want you to know
what you're getting yourself into.
so, that way, if you do decide
you want to talk to me--well, us...me.
um, you can adjust your expectations accordingly.
as long as I get to be a seventh level mage,
I'm in.
marry me. - Okay.
come in. Door's open!
Oh, hey, silver.
I thought you were the dishwasher repairman.
Yeah, not so much.
um, is Annie here?
no, she's not.
okay.
I think she went to some party
at a cheerleader's house.
Oh, no, you know what? That was Dixon.
okay. Gotcha. Thanks.
Bye, honey.
last time. Catch the clap!
really, Danny? After five rounds, it's still funny?
Oh. uh, sor... sorry.
okay, okay. Let's just dive into the next scene.
Where's my... where's my eunuch?
Ethan Ward?
has anyone seen Ethan Ward?
all right, Here we go.
okay, just give me one second here.
put that up there.
all right.
easy. Here, here.
okay.
I'm sorry I'm so pathetic.
no, no, no. You're a trooper.
just get some rest and...
I will be here for as long as
it takes for you to get better.
okay.
Bye, Ethan.
so, what gives?
I thought you were the pro at picking up girls.
Oh, um, I am. I am and I will.
when the mood strikes.
not over silver, huh?
I mean I want to be.
that girl, man, she's... all kinds of trouble.
well, don't rush it.
I knew you weren't a lesbian.
excuse me? - Silver, wha...?
she was just pretending,
so you could cozy up to him.
Dixon, get your girl.
no, no, no. 'cause I'm not his girl.
because he dumped me.
out of the blue. Why would you do that?
I mean, what kind of "love" just stops like that?
and doesn't call or-or-or even care?
I mean, you go to parties
like it never even happened!
um, silver... - No!
um, I should... - Go. Just go.
Hey, silver! silver, what was that?
I don't know.
nothing. I don't know.
I just... it's too much.
what is?
seeing you here, with a girl...
she's just a friend.
Yeah, okay, maybe she is.
but someday, someone's not going to be,
and I'm gonna have to watch you and
I can't handle it!
you knew what?
this being in love stuff-- it's making me crazy.
So...you love me?
I didn't say that. - Yes, you did.
you said this being in love stuff
is making you crazy
ergo, you love me.
fine.
ergo, i do.
well, I ergo you, too.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just don't get why you're doing this.
are you trying to ruin my life, Ade?
Yeah, I'm trying to ruin your life.
okay, look. Assuming it's mine... - Assuming?
Oh, come on.
obviously, we're testing for paternity.
that's why we insisted on an amnio.
my parents want to make sure
they're paying for my problem.
well, it's definitely your "problem.
what happened to this all,
Like,"we're in it together" stuff?
it's hard when you're fighting us.
my parents are trying to help make it go away.
no, this is what you're not getting.
it's a way for me to go away,
not for "it" to go away.
if I go to New Mexico,
I'm still going to be pregnant with "it.
I'm just going to be pregnant with "it in New Mexico.
I'm going to give birth to "it" in new mexico.
it'll" always be a part of me.
but the contract doesn't allow for that,
like I'm not...going to even
be able to talk about "it.
what's there to talk about?
it's humiliating.
Yeah, it is.
but it's also happening.
I have to deal with the situation.
and luckily, I'm getting pretty good
at dealing with humiliation.
just ask your Mom.
sorry to interrupt.
um, I was hoping
I could get your help with something, Navid.
so, look, I don't really want to
spend any more time doing things
that I'm not into.
and this whole play thing, I don't know.
it's just... it's just not me.
okay.
uh, but it wasn't about the play, right?
it was about us spending time together.
and we will.
just not on a strict Miss Casey schedule.
Hey, everyone.
it's Adrianna Tate Duncan,
and I have something to announce
because you will all know soon enough
and I really can't deal with all
the behind-the-back whispering.
so this way, you can all be shocked at once
and hopefully, you'll be able to deal with it.
like I'm doing.
so, anyway...I'm pregnant.
and yes, it happened during my drug period,
Which...you all clearly know about.
so that's about it, folks.
Oh, and as for the father...there isn't one.
it was an immaculate conception.
okay. I'm done.
Yeah. I know.
thank you
my dad says I have to live at home.
stay at my house.
as long as you want.
Liam, I'm not going to be your booty call.
girl: Hello, silver.
Hey. I saw your movie on youtube.
I can't go back to school.
I'm enrolling at St. Claire's.
I just need a fresh start.
you don't have to give your baby up if you don't want to.
what are you saying? We should get married?
Yes. Yes!
uh, married. Sure.
Yeah, okay.
we're getting married.
freshly pureed carrots coming on up.
who's hungry?
I think I know who's hungry.
organic vegetables coming in for a landing.
open up, Hannah.
that's an odd name for a boy.
well, she's not going to be a boy.
Oh, please. The way you're carrying? She's a boy.
he's a boy.
I will call him Habib.
Really?
do you want him to be teased mercilessly?
come on. Kids in beverly hills are used to all kinds of names.
not by kids.
by me.
Habib's a good name.
very masculine, yet sensitive.
Navid: Which is the kind of kid he's going to be.
rugged but soulful; athletic, but not jocky.
intelligent, but not nerdy.
Oh, and you know what I bet he's really going to be into?
chess.
Adrianna: Babies do not play chess.
Navid: Oh, if any baby could, ours could.
I'm telling you, our little guy is going to have the best of everything.
I made this bassinet, you know.
I know and I love it.
but babies do not play chess.
Navid: Well, not at first, I guess.
when he's older.
I'm telling you, he's going to be a prodigy.
well, I don't need a prodigy.
I just want a healthy baby.
come to mama.
we better get to school.
who's going to take care of Hannah?
my parents.
Hello!
Yeah, if they're on board.
of course I'm on board to raise our grandbaby.
what?
they don't even know I'm pregnant.
Yeah, because you keep avoiding them, which you can't keep doing.
because unless you have the gestation period of an elephant, the cat is going to come out of the bag soon enough.
not to mix my animal metaphors.
I know that they need to know.
I just...
I thought maybe you'd want to tell them by yourself, while I go hide under a bed.
no, it's not going to be that bad, I promise.
in fact, I can tell you exactly how the whole thing is going to go down.
at first, yeah, they'll explode with anger.
my mom's going to start to cry.
Oh, she cries when she burns dinner.
while mom is crying, my dad will rant about how we never should have moved to america.
he'll say random things about, you know, the dangers of video games or processed sugar.
he really hates processed sugar.
and then... -The's more?
well, then they'll start to calm down.
my dad will begin to shake his head.
my mom will start to sigh repeatedly.
but the worst will be over.
and that's when I'll bring in the clincher.
I'll suggest, if they don't want to help take care of the baby, maybe we'll get a nanny and my mom will be like,"shirazis don't use nannies!
are you crazy?
family takes care of family."
and then it will be all hugs and kisses and halva from there on out.
I'm sorry.
don't you think they're going to totally freak when they find out you're not...
the biological father? -No.
my mom was raised by her stepdad.
it's her favorite person in the whole world.
it's not going to matter to them who the sperm donor is.
I'm going to be Habib's father.
I'm going to be the one to build his bassinet.
well, habib is a very lucky kid, despite his unfortunate name.
what about this?
are you and liam grabbing a drink or applying for a second mortgage?
you're right. It's ridiculous.
it's just, tomorrow's our first official date, and I want him to take me seriously, you know?
I really like this guy.
I mean...
he's smart, interesting, deep.
I want him to know that I have substance, too.
I don't want him to think I'm just someone he has sex with in the woods, or in cars, or in your bed.
what? -Laundry.
Oh, it's a figure of speech.
maybe I can find something to wear in here.
so, listen, Naomi, I know you're going through a difficult time...
cause my dad's a pervert and the newspapers are comparing him to clarence thomas?
whoever that is.
it's been tough.
Yeah, I bet it has.
but are you even talking to your father, trying to come up with a solution to this whole living situation?
his solution is that I move back in with him and play the role of, "the good daughter," and make nice with his skanky girlfriend.
my solution is that he take his solution and shove it uhis ass.
the only compromise we came to is that I stay here until the sexual harassment case blows over and seriously, thank god you guys are letting me crash here.
I am so grateful. You have no idea.
Yeah!
thank you so much, mom.
you're welcome.
wait, could you iron this, por favor?
you are the best.
really.
Oh, my god, I'm so mad right now!
take it easy!
I can't!
he makes me crazy!
Who-who?
he cancelled our date again.
I swear, I'm going to rage out right now! -No raging out!
but why did he do it?
Why?!
did he meet someone else?
or is he sick?
why don't you just ask him for an explanation?
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, my god!
I love living with you.
okay.
what do you think?
I think you look like you're going to catholic school come on, Dixon, doesn't seeing me in this uniform make you feel a little bit better?
not really.
don't tell me you have a yeshiva fetish.
okay, I will try to grow out the little curls and wear a fur hat in the summer.
I just think it's a little extreme.
wearing fur hats in the summer? Yeah, I agree.
no, I'm not talking about fur hats.
I'm talking about catholic school.
I mean, you're not even catholic.
it's pretty much like any other school, with the occasional mass.
it's the only place that would take me mid-semester.
you have to understand.
I can't go back to west beverly.
I'll always be "crazy bipolar girl who made a sex tape.
silver, that's not true.
everyone there know what I did.
I walk in that building, people are going to stare and whisper and...
I just can't take that.
I can't.
I need a fresh start.
and I need you to be supportive.
Kelly got on board.
why can't you?
because kelly's still going to see you every day.
I mean, you won't come hang out with me at the peach pit anymore.
and you're not going to be in school. That's all...
you're still going to see me all the time, I promise.
can't you try to accept this?
for me?
does the outfit come with the knee socks?
I'd like you all to welcome a new student who will be joining our homeroom.
please introduce yourself.
Hi, I'm-I'm Erin.
and what brings you to st. Claire's, Erin?
well...
uh, the academics mostly.
I-I hear they're really good here.
and I like what you have to offer in terms of, you know, god.
and morals. I'm really excited to be around people with good morals.
and that's pretty much it.
well, we're pleased to have you.
tell me, are you familiar with the catechism?
um, I'm...
no, not really.
not a problem.
why don't you have a seat, Erin?
would anyone like to help erin brush up on the...
okay, Angela.
but remember, not everyone is as pious as you are.
so go easy on her, okay?
I will, Sister Mary Elizabeth.
all right.
let's begin with our morning offering.
Oh, jesus, through the immaculate heart of mary,
I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day.
Adrianna: What the hell?
you okay?
dahlias are out of season.
No!
I'm having dinner with navid's parents tonight and dahlias are his mom's favorite flower.
but the only florist that has them right now is up in santa barbara.
do you think I should ditch school and drive up there?
um, I'm going to go with no.
what are you nervous about?
his parents are in love with you.
Yeah, but...
but what?
okay.
I was going to wait until tomorrow to tell you this.
but, well, navid and I are getting married.
what the hell?
okay. Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for.
I'm sorry.
I'm just.
Why?
well, we're going to keep the baby.
you're going to keep baby?
Yeah, I am.
navid's going to raise it with me, which is why we're getting married.
I don't understand why you have to get married to keep the baby.
or why you want to keep the baby, for that matter.
I'm keeping the baby because it's my baby.
I want to raise it and I didn't think it was possible before, but now, because of navid, it is.
I want to be with him for the rest of my life.
and he wants to do this with me.
he's so amazing.
Yeah, he'd have to be pretty amazing to be okay with raising ty's baby.
Oh, he still thinks the dad's some guy from rehab? Ade!
you know, it didn't seem that important when I was set on adoption.
if you can't be honest with navid, do you really think you should be marrying him?
it's complicated.
it's not.
you're afraid if you tell him the truth, your perfect little marriage fantasy will end.
look, don't judge me.
if you love him, you need to tell him.
what's that I smell?
are we, perchance, having salmon for dinner?
we are.
three times this week.
you guys take that omega-3 propaganda seriously, huh?
no, mom makes salmon because she knows how much I like it.
maybe you should think about what the other family members might want.
: kobe beef.
: just kidding.
Filet's fine.
so, how was your first day without sier?
well, it...
Oh, poor Dixie.
he's bumming hardcore.
long distance relationships blow.
stop calling me Dixie.
and, uh, yeah, they do blow.
you're not in a long-distance relationship, Dixie...
silver's just going to another school.
you'll have to put in a little extra effort.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
got a feeling it's not gonna work.
Hey, there, easy on the pepper, mama.
so what do you kids have planned for the rest of the day?
you're not gonna stand around watching me cook, are you?
I'm going to the gyno.
Aw, geez, Naomi!
what?
it's time for my pap.
Oh, hey, annie, you know about hpv, right?
cause it doesn't matter if you have your little v card, all it takes is some genital contact...
Naomi! -Please?
what?
ask me how I know that. -It's okay, really.
super hot gyno. He talks, I listen.
anyways, I'm off.
have fun.
Oh, believe me, I will.
so, salmon, huh? Yum.
Dixon, where are you going?
um, not really hungry anymore.
okay, the catechism is arranged into four principle parts.
I'm assuming you know the lord's prayer?
not a problem. We'll go over it.
cool. Thanks.
of course. My pleasure.
so, you went to west beverly, right?
well, I know what you meant by wanting to be around people with better morals.
I don't know how you survived west beverly.
it's like sodom and gomorrah over there with...
with all the sex and drugs, so much money and excess, and no moral compass.
sometimes I'll see those west beverly kids at the movies, and they'll buy a medium soda and then just keep going back for refills.
and it's not like they got the jumbo which comes with free refills, you know?
and they could totally afford the jumbo.
Yeah, um, that's why I left.
things like the soda stuff.
should we get back to the catechism, though?
cause I just have so much to learn.
of course.
now, I know this can be overwhelming.
try not to think of it as work, okay?
think of religion as like...
the best extracurricular activity ever.
okay.
decided to do a little shopping after the gyno.
what do you think?
so cute!
good, it's for you.
try it on.
what? Why?
so I can see if it fits. Go. Shoo.
Yeah, I know, but why did you buy me a gift?
to thank you.
that advice you gave me about confronting liam, ask him why he canceled?
genius.
he told me the reason.
we came up with a solution, and voila, we're back on for tonight.
and so why did he cancel?
Oh, his cousin came up from san diego. He had to hang with him.
does it fit? -Perfectly.
I just need help with the zipper.
wow, it oks amazing on you.
try these on with it.
you got me shoes, too? What, Naomi?
put them on.
so are you gonna hang out with this cousin, too?
Yeah, we're gonna do the double date thing.
with who?
well, seeing as you're already dressed...
Naomi, I hate blind dates.
please?!
you know how important tonight is to me.
okay, I'll go.
uh, hey, so thanks again for everything today, and I'll see you tomorrow.
all right, have a good night.
you, too.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I called kels and I told her I was gonna pick you up. So, okay, well, um, let's, let's go, all right?
everything all right?
you shouldn't have come.
I'm trying to keep a low profile.
I wasn't exactly making a scene.
I know, I just, I don't need people here knowing things about me.
I told you, I'm trying to make a fresh start.
so that means you can't have a boyfriend?
no...
I just...
I want to keep my personal life separate from school, okay?
so what does that mean for us?
I mean, you don't want to go anywhere we might run into anyone from west bev;
you don't want me near st. Clare's;
so where does that leave us to hang out?
I don't know my house, your house.
are you serious?
look, this is just what I need right now, okay?
Hello, Navid.
Thanks, Jackie.
it's gonna be okay.
Hi, guys.
Hey, you two!
Adrianna, we are so glad you're having dinner with us tonight.
we keep telling navid to bring you by, but you know how he is, so private.
well, thank you so much for having me.
these are for you.
Oh, I love peonies.
that's so thoughtful. Thank you.
: it's gonna be okay.
so, how have you been?
well, this is an outrage. This is just outrageous.
look, I know, I know this is a shock, but we're in love, and, we're getting married.
married?!
16 and you're having a baby?!
this is an outrage!
I knew it! -I try to be a good mother!
I knew we should have never moved to america!
I knew it was a mistake! -What did I do wrong?!
mom, dad, we came to you because we have a plan and we want you to be a part of it.
you have a plan?
what kind of plan could you possibly have?!
we thought we could live in the guest house.
we still want to finish high school and go to college.
of course, we'll, we'll maybe have to hire some help.
maybe we'll get a nanny?
our family doesn't use nannies!
are you nuts in the head?!
your cousin ravi will watch the baby two days a week.
I'll take care of the others.
family takes care of family.
Thanks, mom.
what did you expect?
this baby's blood.
uh, just so you know not at this matters but, um, the baby isn't, you know, technically your blood.
what-what do you mean?
whats "technical" here?
just that it's not my baby biologically, but you know, I don't even care, so.
you mean you didn't get her pregnant?
well, no, not technically.
um, but that's not the point.
the father's out of the picture and I'm here, so I want to raise the baby as if...
what are you talking about?! Mom was raised by her stepdad!
end of story.
but dad, you don't -End of story!
Hey, you two.
I'm Naomi.
you probably heard a lot about me.
this is Annie.
Annie, this is Liam.
I'm Bru-dog. What up?
sorry?
old surf name that stuck.
and you are a hottie, annie-dog.
so, this is where you woo the ladies.
don't do too much wooing...
unless the ladies insist on being wooed.
well, it's a cute place.
two-dollar beers.
what's better than that?
one-dollar beers.
so how was your day?
not bad.
you know, I was actually thinking about bung a new car.
maybe you could advise me.
didn't you just get a new car?
so, what kind of car were you thinking?
I want a hybrid.
I'm pretty pro-environment.
maybe you could get a bike then.
are you kidding?
I can't tell if you're kidding.
I'm kidding.
right, yeah, funny. Me on a bike.
Ah, Nancy Sutley would be into it.
totally, yeah, I know.
you know what? I am going to run to the little girls' room.
remind me to give you my nancy sutley story when I get back.
another one coming up.
you got someplace to be?
Oh, no.
this is fun.
you don't like me, do you?
Oh, no, I like you just fine.
don't lie.
honestly, people who grunt one-word answers aren't really my cup of tea.
but whatever floats your boat.
okay, look, I have a confession.
I'm pretty shy around strangers because, when I was a kid, we moved around a lot.
I was always meeting new people, and they would mock me and...
make me feel insecure.
I understand.
I am probably bringing my own baggage to this.
see, I once dated this guy named Carl-dog, d anhe had this cousin who was a real ass, you know?
he would try to screw with people and make them feel uncomfortable.
I guess it was just to make himself feel better.
really quite pitiful andvery traumatic for me.
Naomi: Well, I'm back.
what were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, Nancy Sutley.
good choice for Obama.
she's such an expert on california's water and air problems.
good point.
Hey, look, sorry I was being short earlier.
I was just getting my bearings.
so how was your day?
good.
not bad. I mean, I was completely consumed with this novel.
I was almost late coming here.
I just threw on whatever and dashed out the door.
Well,"whatever" looks good on you.
Brewskis from the Bru-dog.
navid: They're gonna come around.
I don't know.
they will.
they have to.
I...
much fun with you today.
Bru-dog: And next, I'm gonna hit oaxaca.
they're running rad double overheads with barrels big enough to drive a truck through.
that's...
that's just rad.
Naomi, time to go home.
right.
heel, boy.
later.
Bye, guys.
Hey, so, you were right.
I was being a jerk earlier.
not gonna argue.
come on.
can't you give me another shot?
fine.
I will give you another shot.
over dinner next week?
just the two of us.
you cannot marry Adrianna and raise the child.
not in our guest house, not with our support.
that is so hypocritical.
our family is full of step-kids.
honey, you're 16.
I know the timing's not perfect...
Navid, it's not up for discussion.
our decision is final.
this doesn't mean that your relationship will end.
you can still date Adrianna.
just because you're not getting married, doesn't mean that you'll break up.
I know this is hard.
your heart's in the right place, navid.
Adrianna will understand.
I'm just saying that if you end up with Bru-dog and I end up with Liam, we'll be cousins-in-law.
I am not ending up with Bru-dog.
you never know, Annie-dog.
you know, I'm beginning to think that liam is really taking me seriously.
going on an actual date is a really big step forward in our relationship.
um, look, uh, I have to tell you something, and I know that it's really going to upset you, but we said that we would be honest with each other, so...
Liam asked me out.
what?
Yeah, um, when we were saying good-bye.
it came completely out of the blue.
well, you musthave misunderstood.
Yeah, but I didn't.
what did you say?
nothing.
I-I just left.
I would never do that to you.
not never.
never again.
the guy's a jerk, naomi.
well, thank you for telling me.
I appreciate it.
I'm sorry.
I know how much you like him.
it happens.
can I just get a little privacy tonight?
Yeah, sure, of course.
I'll find somewhere else to sleep.
like my grandma's bed or something.
Thanks.
Hey, stop that.
I'm doing the dishes, and you're just making them dirty again.
how am iupposed to eat?
Debbie: You're not. We already ate.
guys, can we keep it down a little bit?
I'm doing my homework over here.
why don't you go upstairs and work in your room?
Naomi's upstairs.
she'll try to teach me how to french braid her hair...
no, no, sorry.
annie: Hey, mom, do we have any extra blankets?
grandma's room is drafty and I'm sleeping there tonight.
Why? -It's no big deal.
na omi just had a really tough night and she needs some privacy.
what? I said it was no big deal.
look, sweetheart, we know you want to help her out.
Yeah, I do.
she's going through a really hard time.
Harry: And we're sympathetic. But her living here...
just not a long-term solution.
Amen!
what? What?
you remember those jeans of mine that she didn't like?
she cut them up.
into a million pieces.
that's not normal behavior.
Yeah, well, she probably thought that she was doing you a favor.
she threw away my frozen salmon and filled the fridg with kobe beef.
so let's try the kobe, see what all the fuss is about.
what about the whole "principal boxer-shorts" nickname?
you should have worn a robe!
in my own bedroom?
she was looking for toothpaste.
come on, you guys, where is your compassion?
she has nowhere else to go.
Debbie: I know that, honey.
and we're not saying we're going to kick her out right away.
we're not?
Debbie: No, but we have to figure out a solution for her sake as well as ours.
okay.
so when is she leaving?
shut it, Dixie.
Liam, did you do it?
did you ask Annie out?
Yeah, I did.
what were you thinking?
she's my friend. She'd never go out with you.
look, that's who I am, Naomi.
a huge douche bag?
basically.
I don't do the whole boyfriend thing.
which is why you should get out now.
what?
nothing.
why don't you let me take care of myself.
who knows maybe I have a little thing for jerks.
Hey, Erin.
it's funny you looked familiar to me yesterday, but I couldn'tquite place you.
and then, when I saw you with your boyfriend, it all came together.
you're the whore from the video.
Oh, no, please, don't take any offense to that.
I didn't mean it in a derogatory way at all.
you know, some people think that mary magdalene was a whore, and she was one of jesus's best friends.
people can repent, Erin; they can.
okay.
well...thanks.
you know, I was so shocked when someone forwarded me the videoast month.
you'd think catholic school people would be above that sort of thing, but they're always forwarding me things just trying to get my goat.
of course, I turned it off when you and your boyfriend began to fornicate.
why did you really come to catholic school?
well...
I made that video during a difficult period.
and afterwards, I just wanted a fresh start.
that's totally understandable.
thank you.
and now I know why god brought us together.
I am going to help you save your soul.
first step: You have to tell everyone about your checkered past.
okay, yeah, actually, that's...
I really would rather not.
no, I know you don't want to, but I guarantee you'll feel better if you come clean.
pretending to be someone that you're not it's basically lying.
and god knows, because god is everywhere.
okay, well, I'll think about it.
lies separate us from our relationship with god.
and, Erin, I care about you.
you know what?
I'm going to fast.
what?
I won't eat.
and I will pray every minute of every day until you come out of hiding and admit who you are and what you've done.
okay, that is a little bit extreme.
I know it is, and the nuns, they may say I'm overzealous, but I feel anything I can do to help you get to heaven...
Oh, I have to do it.
silver: It's your fault.
she knows, and it's your fault.
well, hold on, wait.
slow down.
who knows? What are you talking about?
she knows about the movie.
she saw it online last month, but she didn't put it together.
except then, she saw you yesterday, and now she knows that it was me...
all right, silver, relax, calm down, all right?
are you having another manic episode?
No!
I'm allowed to have a bad day, okay?!
I'm allowed to be upset that a video of me having sex went viral!
I'm sorry.
I know.
I just wanted a fresh start, and now that's ruined because angela knows about the movie and she's fasting.
wait, hold on. What?
she says that she's not going to eat again until I come out of hiding, and I tell everyone about my "checkered past.
because that's going to bring me inner peace."
Really?
Yes. It's ridiculous.
not that ridiculous.
what?
well, the fasting stuff is, obviously, but the stuff about how you have to stop hiding it's what you've been doing, Silver.
you're working so hard to keep this whole thing a secret.
Oh, I'm sorry.
what do you want me to do, send out some mass e-mail telling everyone, "hey, I made a sex video because I'm bipolar"?
I'm not telling you to send out an e-mail.
but you're going to have to do something to stop this girl from fasting.
right?
no.
you're just going to let her keep going?
I'm not in charge of her.
there's no end to what you'll do to avoid dealing with this.
but you know what, I'm not even surprised.
you already transferred schools.
you're afraid to leave the house.
you don't know what it's like.
I don't?
I have newfor you.
I was in that movie, too.
only, instead of hiding, I dealt with all the whispering and all the looks.
which wasn't easy, by the way, but I did it.
and you're going to have to figure out how to do that, too, if you're ever going to move on.
I'm not surprised, Navid.
I mean, weere asking a lot from your parents.
I'll just... I'll figure something else out.
what are you doing?
I chose you. -What?!
Navid, they're your family.
they're not going to opyou're all that I want, and...
wait, wait, this is not how it's supposed to go.
how what's supposed to go?
well, our proposal was such a non-proposal, you know?
so I was going to get my great-grandmother's ring after we told my parents.
but plans changed, so this is from a pawnshop.
I've loved you since the first time I saw you in the second grade.
you had this ponytail, and all I ever wanted to do was pull it.
and when you got the fifth grade, and you got your braces...
Oh, wow, let me just say, my heart stopped.
but that's nothing compared to our first kiss.
which is bigger than the ponytail and the braces combined.
I believe in us, Ade.
I can't imagine loving anyone else as much as I love you.
or feeling as close as...
as I feel with you.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, ade.
and the rest of habib's life.
will you please marry me?
I want to.
I love you so much.
but, could you...?
I have to tell you something first.
and I know that this might change everything.
and you might not want to marry me.
but I have to tell you, because you're giving up so much and...
and you deserve the truth.
what are you talking about?
the father of the baby...
isn't a guy from rehab.
it's Ty.
no, I-I-I I can't believe it.
I-I was so scared.
I thought that if I told you, you would just leave.
no, y-you lied to me the whole time!
I just, I...
I've been walking around west beverly, talking to that guy.
you know, every time I pick you up from play practice, I'm like,"hey, ty, what's up?
like a fool!
who else knows?
just-just ms. Taylor and Naomi.
Naomi knew?
I've given up everything for you, Ade. Everything! My family...
I know!-No, it's the fact that you could lie to me to my...
I know! I am so sorry, okay?!
I don't know what to say except that I messed up.
which I used to do a lot of.
and now I do a lot less because you make me a better person.
okay, but I-I still mess up sometimes.
and yes, this was a big one, okay?
and there really is no "and" except I am so sorry!
I'm sorry!
I told you I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Ade...
so don't ever lie to me again.
and put this on your finger...
and don't you ever take it off again.
okay?
okay.
okay.
okay.
I love you so much. -I love you so much.
Naomi: And I don't know why mrs. Jackson was so upset.
I was very discrete when I gave her the number for my waxer.
it's not like I said,"you got a moustache, get it fixed.
Yeah, I guess some people are just ultra sensitive about that kind of thing.
sometimes school is just too much.
Oh, Liam doesn't like you, by the way.
what?
Oh, he's gun-shy about relationships; he's freaking out 'cause he's so into me.
classic self-sabotage stuff.
he admitted that?
Oh, he didn't have to; it was obvious.
psychology 101.
all right, well, honestly, naomi, I think he might just be a creep.
I know that's what he wants me to think, but I'm onto him.
okay.
just be careful.
he's the one who should be careful.
he doesn't think he's boyfriend material, but he's gonna be my boyfriend sooner or later.
annie: Who's this?
this is my sister!
this is Jen!
well, don't just stand there. Grab some glasses.
okay. - Come on.
let's have a toast.
: I'm baaack.
Jen: The whole thing was so last minute.
Naomi left me this frantic message about our father, so...
I immediately hopped in a friend's private jet and voil?
here I am to rescue her from bourgeois hell.
Naomi: I know we all wish I could stay here forever, but it's just not practical.
we totally understand.
totally.
actually, we don't smoke in here.
me neither.
cigarettes are for losers.
I quit.
thank you for helping naomi cope with this dionysian debacle that is our father.
I'll take it from here.
I have a town car outside and a hillside bungalow at the chateau marmont that'll do until we can find more permanent accommodations.
Ciao.
can you help with my...
getting your stuff. -coming right up, well, I'm gonna miss you around here, you know.
Yeah, I do.
Oh, hey, one thing.
if you guys ever do a remodel around here, you might think about fixing the air ducts.
sound really travels.
trust me, someday Dixon will be grateful that I cut up those awful jeans of his.
God, you heard?
is that why you called your sister?
well, I can't live with you guys forever, plus I needed help with my debacle of a dad.
and I was starting to get mercury poisoning from your mom's salmon fetish.
Santa monica high school has a teen parenting program.
I could apply to go to school there.
they have a day care on site.
that sounds perfect.
Oh, and I was thinking about getting a job at the peach pit.
perfect.
okay. Anything you don't want, throw out.
we're gonna have to clean out that guest room to make room for the kid.
and you better be getting a job.
you are not living here rent-free, that's for sure.
I wouldn't dream of it, ma'am.
Adrianna: Who knew she'd be the parent that came through for us, huh?
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
no, it's okay.
I mean, it's true, right?
damn, who knew bassinets were so complicated?
Navid, are you sure that you're okay?
I'm positive.
all I need is you.
and maybe a handyman to help me build this thing.
Angela, would you like to solve for x?
no pulse.
angela is dead.
she died for your sins, Erin.
all: She died for your sins.
she died for your sins.
she died for your sins.
bipolar.
which means...
apparently that you're a sex maniac.
why'd she send this e-mail?
still crazy, I guess.
speak of the devil.
there's the slut.
Angela: Erin!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
you did it. You came clean.
and quickly, too.
I mean, it took me five days of fasting before deb murphy admitted to cheating in earth science.
my stomach was growling like a grizzly bear.
anyway, I'm just thrilled to the gills.
you must feel like a huge weight has been lifted.
actually, what I feel is humiliated and ashamed and sad.
you wanted me to get into heaven?
well, thanks to your extortion, I feel like I'm in hell.
so, does west bev look different?
sadly, no.
not at all.
Mr. Matthews, wait.
this is my sister Jen.
this is the awesome english teacher I always rave about.
nice try, but, uh, you're not getting an extension on that paper.
Hey, Jen.
so you're the reason my little sister ends so many sentences with dangling prepositions.
about what are you talking?
grammar jokes.
hilarious.
right. Well, I got to get to class.
you coming, Naomi?
if you insist.
see you around.
it was nice to meet you.
so I'll pick you up at 3: 00.
my friend's docking his yacht in the marina, so we'll grab an after-school drink.
sounds perfect.
Ciao. -Ciao.
you're back.
I sure am.
how long are you staying?
we'll see.
don't worry.
I'll never tell Naomi that I was your first.
what kind of movoviesdoes your dad produce?
porn. He's the biggest producerof x-rated movies in the world.
I found this homeless guy.
he'd been mowed over by a hit-and-run driver.
doou rememberyour first time here?
sort of.
we both ended updown here, andbefore we knewwhat was happening.

so, you dj? -i do
you know, I'M.
I'm in the music business.
I didn't want to tell naomiwhat happened between us, because she was donewith me, but she's not.
and she needs toknow the truth.
and when I deny it, who doyou think she's gonna believe?
what do you two want?
Naomi, we needto tell youthe truth about that night--we totally slept together.
back on menow.
No! NO! -naomi, she's lying to you
might wantto click that,'cause we're going to napa.

Hey.

Oh, don't get me wrong. Love working weekends.

Oh, man.

I'll pay you backfor the couples' massage, all right?
but I'm telling you, it was worth it.
Navid, my friend, I am living the dream.

if-if he, like, interrogates me, if he interrogates me, I will so give you up.
Navid! -I don't do well under pressure.

I get all hivey and honest.

I mean, after all, you were the one whodiscovered his body.
Yeah, well, I was surprised.
I mean, a hundred grand, that's pretty generous.
I thought he wasjust a homeless guy.
I'm sorry.
just a homeless guy"?
okay, that didn'tcome out right. I meantan"abode-challengedindividual.
do you thinkbeing homeless is funny?
don't you?
look, they livein cardboard boxes, use grocery cartsas means of locomotion.
I'm kidding.
why don't you go down tovenice boulevard to do that set?
I mean, maybe youcan start off with:"Hey, I'm teddy.
my dad's a major movie starand I'll never haveto work a day in my life.
all right. All right, I get you.
it was in bad taste. -Whatever, um.
can you dothe interview, please? About joe herman?
i..you know what? I can'T.
no, thanks.
no, thanks"?
you got to leave meout of it, okay?
all right, look, maybe you saw somethingthat you don't thinkis important.
look! I can't do it, okay?
got it.
you can jokeabout the homeless, but you can't devotea single secondof your precious timefor one of themwho was murdered.
it's fabulous.
has anyoneseen adrianna?
Navid, do youknow where she is?
I think she'sat a doctor's appointment.
sweetie.
come sit downover here with me.
there's somethingwe need to talk about.
I have to tell you something.
something that'sgoing to upset you.
what is it, jen? You're scaring me.
the thing is, naomi.
I'm married. - What?
well, it was allquite impulsive, really.
we met last year and two monthslater we were married.
his name's olivier. He's french.
why didn't you tell me?
because...
because right after we weremarried,
I walked inon olivier in bedwith another woman.
and I left him. - Oh, my god.
there's more. - What more?
well, when I told youmy money was"tied up" in europe, that wasn't exactly true.
the truth is that.
I spent it allbefore I met olivier.
and now I'm broke.
I've been paying for everything:
the rent, your clothes, your car, your twice-weekly appointmentsat the face place.
what were you planning to do, live off me forever, jen?
no, of course not.
and I haveevery intentionof paying you back.
I just needed to get outof europe anclear my headand figure out what to do.
there's onlyone answer.
I'm going back to olivier.
what? - I can't live off you anymore.
I-I just can'T.
it won't be so bad.
olivier wants me back and.
I think I can livewith an open marriage.
an open marriage"? ! Jen!
what, are youout of your mind? No!
I have too muchpride anyway.
maybe it'll be good for me, in some sort of spiritual sense.
and plus, when I'm backwith olivier,
I-I will pay you backright away.
you'll haveyour trust fund back.
I'm not worriedabout my stupid trust fund.
I'm worried about you.
look, look at me. You.
okay, you're not goingback to someloveless marriagewith some loser who willcheat on you likedad did with mom.
no way in hell.
maybe if I justgo back with olivier.
over my dead body. Stop it!
I don't want to hearanother word about it.
I didn't know joe myself, but I've had a chance nowto talk to some ofhis teachers and fellow studentswho knew him whenhe was here at west bev, and this is whatI've discovered.
Joe loved earth science.
he petitioned the schoolto buy an electron microscope.
his sophomore year, he playedvarsy soccer for three years.
Joe also participatedin two school plays.
he was artiein the house of blue leaves, and he was the narratorin our town.
Joe herman was a west bevstudent, like all of you.
like I was.
he was one of us.
look, I'm getting youto geoffrey's before sunset.
I don't care howmany tickets I get. You hungry?
no, I'm starving, and excitedabout eating at geoffrey'S.
Yeah, there's nothing like a little herb-crustedsalmon by the sea.
you know, I gottatell you something, dixon--I'm not really usedto this whole fancy cars, fancy dinners thing.
honestly, I have, like,$100, 000 in student loans;
I-I have a roommateand, most nights, when I'm notwi you, I.
I eat ramen noodles.
Sasha, it... - no, I know, I know, I know.
I probablyhouldn'tbe telling you this, 'cause L. A.Is allabout appearances, but.
I don't know, it'S.
when I'm with you, it's, like, I feel like I can be real.
you know? I feel likeI can tell you anything.
Hey, sasha? - Yeah?
all right, what were you likewhen you were younger?
when I was younger? - Yeah, like,, high school.
Oh, man, that wasa long time ago.
um, I guess likeevery other high school kid.
dumb as dirt.
thought I knew everything, really knew nothing.
I mean, but, you know, there-there are some high schoolkids that are mature, right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm surethey think they are.
I mean, but, come on. How mature can they really be?
they haven'tdone anything. I mean, come on.
think about how differentyou are since you graduated.
Yeah, worlds away, right?
Yeah, yeah, I-I guessyou're right.
and so, I said to warren beatty,"back off man.
I'm hitting on this girl.
and I told you, he's getting out of it.
he just, he needed to makesome money to payoff some debt.
but porn? I mean, that doesn'tbother you at all?
I swear, if itwere any other guythen, yeah, it probablywould be a deal-breaker.
but dixon is special.
he's sweet andunderstandingand, oh, we haveso much in common.
Oh, yes, the orange sherbertand roy campanella and you even havethe same cell phone, which is why youmixed them up.
how adorable.
I thout dixondrove a lamborghini.
well, he probably justhas a few different cars.
who is thatwhite womanand why is she huggingyour boyfriend?
um, thanks for coming over.
Yeah.
I wanted to tell youthis in person.
tell me what?
um. I turned down the part.
and my agent'sdropping me, but it's fine.
you know, I'm totally, I'm totally taking the year off.
we have been through so much.
I just, I don't want any moretemptations right now.
I love you so much, ade.
I am so in love with you.
um.
so, my mom isworking late tonight.
we have the whole placeto ourselves.
I think we've waitedlong enough, don't you think?

mm, who says thatthere's no reason?

Oh, yes. Uh, champagne tuesdayat the clark residence.
so, how was your day?
Ugh, hideous.
high school kidsare so annoying.

Jen: Naomi will neverbelieve that we slept together.
I Will keep the baby.

Serena, we need to reestablish Alpha Base...
...before we can proceed with the mission.
how you feeling? Any better?
I-I got some good news.
I talked to your coach.
I explained you've been dealing with a lot these past few weeks.
threw around some pretty serious principal rank, and guess what?
you're back on the surf team.
Thanks, but, uh... I'm not going to go back on the team.
why not?
because I missed the practices, so I should suffer the consequences.
there were extenuating circumstances.
Yeah, Sasha was pregnant.
and instead of supporting her, I fought with her.
man, I've been...
I've been trying to call her and see if she's okay.
she hasn't returned any of my phone calls.
Yeah, well, you know, that's...
that's probably 'cause she's... she's trying to move on.
it's because she's devastated.
I know it.
and I'm supposed to just go on with my life like nothing happened?
just go surfing while she's suffering, right?
how is that fair?
Thanks, but no thanks, Dad.
system is off-line and a lockdown protocol is in effect.
if we rebuild, the lockdown will end...
honey. Hmm?
I'm really starting to worry about Dixon.
I mean, he seems miserable.
Harry, he'd be more miserable if he knew Sasha manipulated him and lied to him.
he'd be heartbroken. He'd feel like a fool.
I don't know.
well, I do.
I was right about Sasha, wasn't I?
Yes, you were.
okay, so trust me.
it's only been a couple of days.
he'll snap out of it, and then we can all just move on and put this behind us.
Rosie really wants... blueberries.
excuse me?
um, Rosie really wants blueberries.
red, red, white, blue.
of course.
can't take it on an empty stomach, though.
here's some electrolytes.
and while you drink that, let's go over tomorrow's schedule.
all right.
but I told Linda that she could swap with her for next Tuesday.
anyway, uh, Janet's gonna take you to the oncologist at 11: 00, which is all written down right here.
you're scheduled to have a CBC to check your platelets and your fibrinogen levels.
and for medications for tomorrow, everything is written down right here according to what you take, what time and with or without food.
so if you have any questions just refer to the binder.
sound good?
what?
when did you get so organized?
uh, I've always been organized.
you? Yeah.
remember in fifth grade,
I-I organized a class trip to the San Diego Zoo.
I passed around that petition listing all the reasons why we deserved to go see the giant pandas.
well, plus, I mean, you've got to be organized to be a stage manager.
I... I...
I did stage manage every school play since like seventh grade.
sure.
um, well, anyway, the point is,
I'm organized, and it's helping now.
so, come on.
Rosie really wants her blueberries.
this history homework is killing me.
I'm so over the Battle of the Bulge.
if you were dating Jamie, you would so not be over the battle of the Bulge.
you're disgusting.
you're jealous.
Oh, Jamie wants to know if I can to to his frat party Saturday night.
no, right?
uh, you tell me.
well, it's your half-birthday. What time is the party?
Oh, right. Um, I'm actually not going to have a half birthday party this year.
just, you know, everything going on with my mom, there's just not a lot of time.
Hey.
look who's here.
Oh, thank God.
I was getting worried.
Hey, guys.
Hey, you. Hey, how you holding up?
um, I'm actually doing a lot better.
that's good. That's so good.
I'm sorry I was such a mess.
are you kidding?
you had every right to be a mess.
you-you made a stupid mistake, and you lost the guy you loved, and...
I am not helping.
I'm sorry. No, that's okay.
I'm okay.
that's good, Ade. And it's good to see you.
I got to go, but I'll see you all at lunch?
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.
how's she doing?
Oh, I don't know
okay... she says she's okay, but she doesn't want to celebrate her half-birthday.
what?
well, that would probably help her take her mind off her mom.
right?
whatever. I'm not done working on her.
no matter what, we have to get her a gift.
Oh, maybe a massage.
Oh, that sounds perfect.
uh, but I'm actually running a little low on funds.
Oh, my God, don't even worry about it.
you go pick up the gift certificate, we'll call it even.
okay.
what do you think?
that's so cute.
it's silly.
happy Half-Birthday.
$150-- that should do it, right?
Yeah.
perfect.
good to have you back, Ade.
it's really good to be back.
Hey, man, I want to talk to you.
look, I didn't hit on Jen. Okay?
and honestly, Mr. Matthews, that woman is a psychotic bitch.
Yeah, enough, okay?
well, she is.
you know what, I'm starting to think your stepdad was right, okay?
maybe you are a bad seed.
okay, so John Campos dares me to eat ten packets of butter this morning.
don't mean to brag, but I ate 11.
the kid had five. I swear he was gonna hurl all over the cafeteria.
that's great.
is everything okay? Just fine.
Really? 'Cause you don't seem fine.
what's wrong? Nothing.
well, obviously it's something.
what's going on?
Liam, dude, what is it?
just back off.
all right?
you're not my girlfriend.
okay, another reason to have your half-birthday soiree
I just bought a ridiculously hot dress, and you'll get to see me in it.
tempting, but I'll pass.
pass on what?
hmm, seeing Naomi look ridiculously hot.
silver's half-birthday party, which she's trying to cancel for the first time in years.
Oh. Okay, I got to go.
Jamie's here.
listen, just promise you'll think about it.
my dress is... picture lots of cleavage, excellent ass.
it's amazing.
hmm, we'll find another occasion for it.
maybe bowling or something.
half-birthday party, huh?
you so don't seem like the type of person that would make a big deal out of their half-birthday.
Yeah, well, it's a long story.
it's a long walk to class.
okay, for my tenth birthday, um... Mm-hmm.
...all my friends and I were gonna go camping in my backyard.
I was super excited.
I mean, like, counting the days excited.
um, and then on my birthday my mom got trashed and I had to cancel the party.
she'd missed birthdays before
she'd gotten drunk or just forgotten-- but I don't know, this one, this was the last straw, I...
I just gave up on birthdays in general.
I... too many expectations.
and half-birthdays?
if you don't have high expectations then you can't get let down.
so what does one get a person for their half-birthday present?
a half-DVD? Just special features?
a half-bottle of champagne?
I know.
a half-bikini.
perv. No.
okay, all right. Um...
how about a half-spring break trip?
it wouldn't be so bad.
a one-way trip to Cabo.
despite the recent overdose at Malibu Canyon High, the students are seemingly apathetic.
teen drug use has reared its ugly head at West Bev before.
was the case at Malibu Canyon an isolated incident, or an indication of a larger, yet uncovered problem plaguing the Los Angeles school system?
Hey.
Hey.
look, I don't think we've, uh, officially met.
I'm Navid.
so why would you tell Annie I'm a drug dealer?
um, look, that's-that's what I heard.
from who?
a friend of mine.
she said you sold to a friend of hers.
I assume you didn't talk to this friend of a friend?
well, no, but...
right, 'cause if you did, you would have realized that it's not true.
I mean, come on, man, don't you check your sources before you publish your stories?
Yeah, of course. Of course you do?
well, I wish you'd give me the same respect, that's all.
look, for the record,
I'm not a drug dealer.
I'm just a guy who doesn't have a lot of friends here.
never have. I'm not a popular kid, and because of that, people like to spread rumors about me.
I-I-I...
I guess I should be used to it by now.
people gossiping, you know, but... uh...
it still feels crappy.
Hey, you. I missed you all morning.
I missed you, too.
you want to go to Quality for lunch?
sounds good.
look, I have some pretty big news.
Really?
what?
how do you think we should get to Quality?
Beverly or Burton?
now, wait, I was thinking Beverly, but Beverly can get so busy this time of day, so...
what's the big news?
well, you know, sometimes I take Olympic-- once in a while
and I mean, it's like smooth sailing, completely.
Uh-huh. What's the news?
Oh, that?
well...
I cut a few scenes together from my movie and showed it to my father.
now, granted, the guy, he produces big-budget movies, most of which are completely soulless.
But?
but still...
he... responded to it. He liked it.
Oh. Oh, that...
that-that's great.
Yeah, but that's not even the best part.
what?
there's a Shia LeBeouf movie. There's a small part.
my dad's producing.
and I got you an audition.
Oh, my God. Are you-- are you serious?
I'm dead serious.
look, you just have to promise me that when you're a big movie star, you'll still have time for me.
Oh, I promise.
cause I mean, after all,
I'll still need someone to get me coffee.
what up, guys?
Hey. Hey. What's up?
Where's Liam? Is he coming to lunch?
don't know. He was in a nasty mood.
bit my head off earlier.
is it true you downed, like ten butter packets this morning?
11, actually.
so, uh, what do... what do you guys think's going on with him?
who knows?
Ooh, we've got curly fries.
Yeah! Ooh. See, I'm more of a tater tot man, myself. Mmm.
dude, you can't say "tater tot" and "man" in the same sentence.
well, did you ask him what was wrong?
Liam? No.
well, why not?
dude, Liam's not the "talk about your feelings" kind of guy.
Yeah, okay. But what if something's actually wrong?
I haven't smelled any dead bodies coming from his car, so...
that is a good sign.
Yeah, it is. Good point.
guys, this isn't a joke.
okay? I mean, he's obviously really upset about something.
and I think it's kind of sad that the people who are supposed to be his friends don't even really seem to care.
excuse me.
I swear, every year, I forget about the Santa Anas and then one morning, I'll wake up...
and I'm boring you.
no.
okay, maybe a little.
I'm sorry. I'm nervous. I just, um...
I know that you saw me with Teddy, and I wanted to explain.
I wanted to talk to you about it earlier, but since everything that was going on with your break-up, it... the timing wasn't right.
Teddy and I are...
we're friends and I feel so badly about that because of everything that happened between you two, but his mom...
she had cancer, too, and he's-he's been really helpful.
so I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner, but uh, if you don't want me to be friends with him, then I won't.
that's what I'll do. I-I will stop being friends with him.
I just want you to be happy.
so, if being friends with Teddy is going to help you deal with your mom, go for it.
Really?
really. I'm fine.
Ade, thank you.
Thank-Thank you. Of course.
okay, I'll be right back. I got to go to the bathroom.
there's no way that your office can deliver the records to our house?
no. Uh, no, that's-that's okay.
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Hi.
I don't usually do home deliveries, so this will be extra.
your homework. Oh...
and a black coffee.
Oh, thank you so much. I needed this.
everything okay?
Yeah. Um, it's just, my mom has to see this new doctor tomorrow and she needs her medical records, which I was going to pick up after school, but then her nurse had a family emergency. I'll pick them up.
that's sweet, but you can't. I have to sign for them.
then I'll stay here with your mom while you go pick up her records.
um, I don't... It's not...
I have plenty of experience with sick moms.
trust me. I got it covered.
30 minutes?
Ah, thank you so much.
I'll just add it to your tab.
you okay, man?
Yeah. Uh...
thinking about Sasha, huh?
Yeah. You know...
I just wish she knew how sorry I am.
I hear you, man.
uh, speaking of apologies, uh...
catch you later, okay?
Yeah, cool.
fancy meeting you here.
Yeah.
I want the same stuff I got last time, but I only have 20.
so, could you just sell me a few pills now and then I'll buy the rest later, or something?
sorry, this isn't an a la carte service.
why don't you call me when you have the money?
no, Wait, wait. Um...
here.
that's more like it.
you know where to find me.
Really? Oh, so you don't like it.
not this time. You going to take it?
I think I will take my chances on lady luck.
Oh, and it's a good thing I did.
Ooh. Oh, careful there. Your suits are showing.
you're throwing down a six?
Ooh, bad move.
next hand, double or nothing.
you are on, sucker. Hey.
Hey, you. Hey, your mom is going down.
Oh, boom!
no way!
how's that for bringing it, hmm?
what you got now?
Hello?
Hey, it's, uh...
Oh, I know.
right.
Hi.
I didn't think you'd be calling.
but I'm glad.
Ade, I saw you buying drugs today.
what?
why would you start using again?
I'm not.
I saw you in your car with Jasper.
okay, look. Whatever you think you saw, you were wrong.
Ade, are you serious right now?
why are you even calling?
I thought I wasn't your problem anymore.
come on. I still care about you, okay?
Hey, uh, I'll be back in about an hour.
I got to go run by Sasha's. What?
I just want to go over there and make sure she's okay.
you know, apologize face to face.
uh, Dixon,
I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.
you know, it may not be, but I still got to try.
you know, I got to let her know that I'm here for her.
well, that's all well and good, but I think it's obvious that Sasha doesn't want to see you right now.
Yeah, because I was being a jerk and I made her feel like she was alone, which is why I have to go apologize.
Yeah, but now is not the time.
we're about to sit down for dinner.
okay, fine. Then I'll go after.
honey...
what? Why are you guys making such a big deal out of this?
Dixon, sit down.
I have something to tell you.
Sasha didn't have a miscarriage.
what?
she wasn't pregnant.
well... I-I-I don't understand.
what-what are you talking about?
I had some suspicions.
a lot of what she said didn't add up, so I went to see her and I caught her in some lies.
I guess she said she had a miscarriage to save face.
so, she wasn't really pregnant?
no, she wasn't.
wait. And you guys knew about this all along?
look, your father wanted to tell you, but I... I wanted to protect you.
I didn't want you to get your heart broken and not trust women.
well...
now I know one woman I can't trust.
no, it doesn't hurt.
why should it? Go, go, have a great time.
I couldn't care less.
that was great.
you are incredible.
that's a lie. I know I'm not great.
I wish you could see yourself the way that I see you.
you'd never have a moment of self-doubt ever.
no, I'm serious.
you're beautiful, talented, soulful.
sometimes I just,
I can't believe how lucky I am to have found you.
okay, back to work.
where were we?
um, But I won't have a great time without you.
don't you understand?
I'm asking you to come with me.
I love you.
that's not your line.
I know.
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have said anything.
clearly, you don't feel the same way.
no, Annie...
it's just that I wanted to be the one who said it first.
you scumbag.
whoa. Good morning to you, too, man.
no, I saw you with Ade.
I saw you selling to her.
look, whatever you think you saw...
no, you went into her car, and you came out with cash. What else did I have to see?
I spotted her lunch money.
told her it was on me.
she insisted she pay me back.
she's a nice girl, you know? Why'd you two break up?
you just stay the hell away from her, all right?
or what?
look, I'll say it one last time:
I'm not a drug dealer.
but if I was, I wouldn't be the kind of guy you'd want to mess with, would I?
you threatening me?
not at all. Like I said, not a drug dealer.
who are those guys?
I don't know. They must've heard the waves are breaking out here.
Yeah, well, this is our beach.
better not get in our way.
dude, chill.
you chill.
and can you not use all my wax?
yo, everything okay, man?
Yes! I'm fine.
I tried.
silver? I'm in here.
happy Birthday!
Oh! What? I don't understand.
I missed so many of your birthdays,
I wanted to make it up to you before it was too late.
so, welcome. You're seven, by the way.
when I wanted to be an astronaut.
now come here.
Oh, my God, a fishbowl space helmet? Really?
put it on.
you might not think this is as exciting at my age, but it totally is!
would you like a glass of Tang?
uh, kinda hard to drink through the helmet.
now I'm not sure the constellations are accurate.
it's incredible!
there's so much more to see.
there's more? Are...?
like I said,
I missed a lot of birthdays.
I must be 12, when I was obsessed with the '80s.
Oh, duh!
Oh, radical, dude! Yes!
how did you do all this, Mom?
I had a little help from the nurses.
but the biggest help was Teddy.
he was here for hours with one of his dad's fancy-schmancy set designer friends.
Wow. I mean, this is... this is all so, so wow.
honey? Dixon, I understand why you're upset.
my intentions were good, but, but obviously, I was wrong.
I can't believe you.
Dixon, please?
Dixon, stop. I just want to talk to you.
Hey, Dixon!
come on. I know you're upset with your mom.
whatever, it's not like she's my real mom.
so, what made you want a camping party in the first place?
horror movies.
in every good horror movie there's always a scary camping scene.
I'll never understand where you got your love of being terrified.
it gets you out of your head, you know?
I mean, the scarier the movie, the more I could just forget all my problems.
me.
Y-You...
you were just never there.
which was hard.
you not coming to the plays that I stage-managed...
worrying about you when you didn't come home at night, just hoping that you were okay.
honey, I am so sorry.
which makes up for nothing, but...
no, it does.
this does.
I was so scared that you, that you would die and I wouldn't have anything good to hold onto.
and now I do.
I mean, now I have my tenth birthday party where we went camping.
Oh, honey...
enough of this sappiness.
eat your marshmallow.
well, just remember to save your appetite.
tomorrow is your official half-birthday.
all your friends are coming over for a big barbecue.
are you serious?
you've been celebrating your half-birthday for years, and I am glad that I finally get to be a part of it.
me, too!
Cheers!
awesome.
Hey. Didn't think you'd make it.
you've been a little M.I.A. lately.
Yeah, I get alerts on my phone that let me know how the waves are breaking.
so you know I couldn't resist when I heard about these swells.
Plus, you know, I just had to get out of the house.
everything okay, man?
turns out Sasha wasn't really pregnant.
what?
Yeah. She lied about the whole thing.
man, man, I wish I'd get alerts that let me know when crazy girls are approaching.
they probably got an app for that.
Hey!
and I bet it beeps nonstop.
Hey, what the hell, man?!
you tell me, dude. That was my wave.
like hell it was. Don't push me!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on!
get off me! He's a punk!
we're leaving.
no, we're not. Yes, we are.
dude, what the hell? Relax!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, what was that back there?
that guy was being a jerk!
you were the jerk!
what the hell's going on, man!
nothing. No, it's not nothing.
you nearly got us in a fight back there, and you're gonna tell us why.
back off, man.
or what? You gonna hit me?
try it. You can't take both of us down.
make that all three of us.
what is your problem?
we don't have a problem.
Liam, we're your friends.
friends tell each other what the hell is going on.
so come on. What the hell's going on?
someone's been telling lies about me, all right?
who, Liam?
Jen, Naomi's sister.
that super hot Amazon chick from the N. E.R. D. party?
sorry, she wasn't that hot.
What'd she say?
Oh, she told Matthews that I hit on her.
she told my mother that I was stalking Naomi.
all sorts of stuff.
what? Why?
forget about it.
we'll wait you out, man.
and believe me, we can wait all night.
tell us why, dude.
last year, at the after-prom party, she was the person that I...
that I had sex with.
so, wait, so, so, it wasn't Annie?
I told you it wasn't. I know, but I still thought...
you had sex with Naomi's sister? No, no, it wasn't like that.
she told me she was her neighbor.
she's full of lies, this woman, and she's been trying to destroy me since last year.
that's messed up.
I'm gonna destroy Jen before she destroys me.
I just don't know how I'm gonna do it.
it's not how you're gonna do it...
it's how we're gonna do it.
hell, yeah.
that Amazon bitch ain't gonna know what hit her.
get her right in the kneecaps.
you guys, you... you don't have to do this.
we know we don't have to.
but we're your friends, remember?
later, Liam.
Hey.
Hey. What's wrong?
I just got the call; I didn't get the part.
my dad is such an idiot.
look, I know you were so much better than all those other girls.
Yeah, well, apparently not.
you ever hear of Johnny Weissmuller?
no?
exactly.
but Clark Gable, he lost the role of Tarzan to him.
you will get your part, Jane.
Yeah, maybe.
no maybe.
you will.
you're a star.
you're an old-fashioned star.
you're so talented, it's incredible.
not to mention beautiful.
you're an extraordinary person, Annie.
you're so vulnerable and yet so strong and...
so innocent, but also wise.
I mean, you're-you're Annie.
thank you.
yeah?
I love you.
I love you, too.
and I... I want my first time to be with you.
are you sure that you're ready?
positive.
Hey.
so, look, um,
I owe you an apology.
Oh, no.
dude, I totally get why you snapped at me.
you've obviously had a lot going on.
no, no, no, about what I said in the hall.
about you not being my girlfriend.
I... I...
I know you don't think you're my girlfriend.
Yeah, no kidding.
we're just having fun, dude, that's all.
so we're cool?
Yeah. Totally.
good.
Hey, do you maybe want to grab something to eat?
see who can, uh, scarf down the most ketchup packets?
cute.
um... maybe another time.
all right.
catch you later.
Hey.
you know what?
I'm pretty hungry, so what the hell?
what a you in the mood for?
um, tacos.
Really?
tacos and ketchup?
Thanks, anyway.
no luck, boss.
I just talked to my friend Jennie, the one who said she bought drugs from Jasper, and she won't help us.
we have to find a way to prove it.
I want to bring this dirtbag down.
Hey.
Hi.
look, I-I-I just came to apologize.
you know, I should have trusted you when you told me...
is this about the fact that you called Jasper sketchy?
n-no, actually.
of course not.
whatever.
I don't even know why I care what you think.
I mean, you're clearly not a very good judge of character.
what's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
your girlfriend faked a miscarriage.
sounds like a real winner.
go to hell.
Hey, what's wrong?
I went to, um, the spa to buy the gift certificate for Silver, and I got out of my car, and out of nowhere, there was this guy.
and he grabbed my purse.
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Yeah.
he took everything.
you know, my credit cards, the-the money for Silver's gift, everything.
I don't care about the money, I care about you.
did you call the police?
Yeah, they came, and I filed a report.
but they can't do much because I didn't see the guy.
it just happened so quickly.
it was so scary.
Oh, I'm sorry.
it's going to be okay.
did I wake you up?
actually, yes.
good. I wanted to be the first person to wish you a happy half-birthday.
thank you.
for-for everything.
um, hey, last night with my mom, it was, it was perfect.
I'm glad.
so I'll see you at the barbeque?
Yeah, can't wait.
Bye, Teddy.
mom...
it's time to wake up.
it's my half-birthday! Mom.
mom? Fine. You don't have to get up 'cause it's my birthday, you got to get up to take your pills.
mom?
mom!
mom. Yeah, I need an ambulance.

I want the same stuff I got last time. - You had sex with Naomi's sister? - She told me she was her neighbor.
I'm going to destroy Jen before she destroys me.
I just don't know how I'm going to do it.
I'm not giving up, you know?
not until Naomi knows the truth.
how you lied to me that night.
you turned me against her!
I'm sorry. I never even thanked you for your help.
you were great.
whoa. We're in public.
don't worry about it. It's not like anybody saw us.
I found this homeless guy.
he'd been mowed over by a hit and run driver.
before I fell down the stairs,
I was pushed, and I know who did it.
we have been dispatched to spread winter cheer.
and to tell you all, the Winter Wonderland Dance is near.
Thanks.
winter Wonderland Dance...
I bette dust off my princess crown.
you don't want to go, I get it. - You do?
I just... I used to love going to dances.
you know, getting ready and going with someone that I liked, seeing my friends all dressed up, but whatever, that was another lifetime.
well, we couldn't go even if we wanted to, right?
since your dad's going to be there, chaperoning or whatever.
well, actually, he's going to be away at a conference.
but it's no big deal. Like I said, school dances, another lifetime.
I would, however, like to see that princess crown of yours sometime though.
I'll be right back. Wait for me.
Annie, wait.
I need to talk to you.
look, I understand why you haven't returned my calls.
I wouldn't return my calls either, if I were you.
I made a huge mistake when I accused you of sleeping with Liam.
it was my sister.
Yeah, I heard.
I'm so sorry, Annie.
I-I should have just listened to you.
I don't even know why I didn't.
maybe, maybe it has to do with my own insecurities or what happened with Ethan, I don't know.
anyway, it doesn't matter.
when I think about what I put you through...
hell.
you put me through hell, Naomi.
I can't go to the police. What am I supposed to say?
that I think he pushed me right before I fell down the stairs?
tell them you saw a pair of black combat boots.
so? Half the school wears black combat boots.
Yeah, but half the school didn't threaten you.
Yeah, it's not enough.
look, I might not be able to prove that Jasper pushed me, but there's got to be a way to get proof that he's a drug dealer.
Lila, hey! Just the person that I wanted to see.
guys, this is Lila, my star reporter.
Yeah, well, your "star reporter's" hit a road block.
kids who do drugs don't exactly want to advertise it in the Blaze.
who cares about the Blaze?
I just need to find someone who is willing to tell the principal that Jasper dealt to them.
Oh, the principal. Why didn't you say so?
that should be easy!
no, I need that proof, okay? And once I get that proof,
I can go to the administration and then the authorities.
and once I'm done with that dirtbag, he won't even know what hit him!
dude. Careful with that pool cue.
right, uh... sorry.
jeez, watch where you're going, freak.
man, do you kick babies and puppies, too?
whatever, you cannot pay me enough money to wear a tutu.
or go to a West Bev dance, huh?
actually, I don't know, I'd think it'd be funny to just go and, you know, like, see what all this hype's about.
throw some pig's blood on the ballerinas...
right, come on, Liam. I wouldn't do that.
I'll get us a table, guys.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
Hey, you. - Hey.
would you like to sponsor me?
I'm doing a 5K run to raise money for breast cancer research.
Yeah, sure.
what's up with the T-shirt?
Oh, uh, I'm a Ford Warrior in Pink.
it's in honor of my mom.
all net proceeds go to the cause.
you know, I think you should really get one.
maybe a pink jacket. Really bring out your eyes.
I'll think about it. Anything for the cause.
that's the spirit.
so listen, um...
you going to the Winter Wonderland Dance?
Yeah. Naomi and I are gonna stop by for a few hours before we go to St. Barts.
so, you're saying I'll have to one-up St. Barts if I want you to ditch Naomi and go with me instead?
are you asking me to go with you?
like... on a date?
I sure am.
Yeah, right. Come on. I know your idea of a date.
you show up with one girl, leave with another.
whatever. Anyway, here is a form in case you want to sponsor me.
so, I was like, "Look, dude, you are way out of line, douchebag."
you said that to Mr. Huang?
well, in my head I did.
Yeah.
Hey, I should talk to Naomi.
see if she's okay.
I haven't spoken to her since the races, you know?
right. Sure.
Hey. - Hey.
I just wanted to check in. Make sure you're okay.
you know, right after everything happened,
I wanted to thank you.
Oh, no, it's all right.
let me finish.
that's how I felt right after everything went down.
but as I've had more time to think, I've gotten more and more upset.
you could have put a stop to this months ago, Liam.
why didn't you tell me what happened prom night?
look, I wanted to.
I didn't think you'd believe me over Jen.
so you just kept it to yourself?
Naomi, you don't understand.
Oh, you're right. I don't understand.
Naomi! - No, I'm okay. I'm...
when am I going to stop liking him?
no, you just tell, just tell Liam how you feel.
no. I can't tell him how I feel.
he should have told me the truth and he didn't.
and I don't want to be involved with someone like that.
besides, it doesn't matter anyway.
I saw him kissing that barefoot surfer chick.
apparently, he likes the smell of B. O.
they were kissing? When?
at the races.
whatever! I just need to stay strong and find some St. Barts hottie to take my mind off of everything.
how do I look?
I'd ease up on the lip gloss a little bit.
Oh, be quiet! I look fantastic.
all right, let's get out of here.
blue 42, hut-hut! Hike!
go deep! Go deep!
that's what I'm talking about, baby!
all right, it's a go for Troy Polamalu.
let's do this. Dude, Polamalu plays defense.
dude, you seriously need to give your man card back right now.
whatever, toss the grapes.
so, uh, you gonna ask Ivy to the dance or what?
what are you talking about?
come on. She was throwing around hints like crazy yesterday.
at least you know if you ask her to the dance, she'll say yes.
I got shot down yesterday.
by who? Angelina Jolie?
I, um, I asked Silver.
to the dance? - Yeah.
man, I'm sorry. I should have run it by you first.
no, no-no, no, no, it's cool. Seriously.
not that it matters. She made up her mind about me.
so?
you can get someone to see you in a different light, bro.
how's that?
are you seriously asking me for advice on girls?
Oh, man card, back in the pocket!
all right.
so what do you think I should do?
you have to prove to her that you're not a player anymore.
gotta let her know that you're serious about being with her.
show her your heart.
show her your heart?
do you want to burn his man card or should I?
so we can totally go topless in St. Barts.
please, don't go topless in St. Barts.
Oh, don't worry. I've been tanning my tatas in anticipation.
Hey.
Hi.
Naomi, I heard what happened with Jen.
if there's anything you need... - Yeah, I'll pass.
you're not exactly someone I can rely on.
I cannot believe I missed the grape-tossing contest, 'cause I'm pretty much the champion.
of course you are.
I'm being serious. Here, watch and learn.
you don't want to go to the dance, do you?
Why? Are you, like, asking me?
you know, but if you don't want to go that's cool.
no, I mean, whatever. Sure, I'll go.
cool. - Cool.
I'm just gonna get some books from my car.
but you're more than welcome to follow me there, if you'd like.
Nah, I'm just...
I'm waiting for you to mess up.
and when you do, I'll be there.
Wow. Just like Batman.
I know you pushed me down the stairs.
look, I...
I know you suffered a head injury, but I didn't know you were suffering from delusions.
you talked to your doctor about that?
Oh, I know you did it.
all right, and I'm going to bring you down.
well, let me know how that goes, Batman.
I need your help.
so, I know who pushed me down the stairs.
who? - Jasper.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I saw him right before I fell.
or I saw his shoes, but I know it was him.
but why? Why would he do that?
because I told him to stay away from you.
the thing is, I can't prove it.
what I can prove is that he's a drug dealer.
if someone will come forward and say that he dealt to them.
come forward?
and I didn't know if I could ask you because things have been weird between us, but I've tried everything else.
Navid, I really wish I could.
but I'm still on probation.
can I do it anonymously?
I can't go to the administration with an anonymous source.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I get it.
Yeah, I'll just, uh, hey, I'll figure something else out.
okay, you want me to kick your butt with the blue ball or the orange ball?
Seriously?
you took me out of school to play mini golf?
come on, this used to be our thing.
remember that summer we played mini golf every day?
Yeah, I was ten.
well, I wasn't, and I still had a good time.
course that might've been because I schooled you--mom-style.
Swishin' and swashin' and dishin' it into the hole.
Dixon... - What?
how long are you going to stay mad at me?
can we just go home?
Yes.
after I beat you.
Oh, God.
can I talk to you?
free country.
look, I owe you a huge apology.
I should've told Naomi who I slept with.
Yeah, no kidding.
at first, I didn't want to hurt Naomi.
then I was gonna tell her, but her sister, Jen, threatened me.
what's going on?
Hey. - Hey.
anyway, I just wanted to apologize, that's all.
I'll see you around.
Yeah, right.
like an apology is gonna make it better.
whatcha thinking?
nothing, just that...
Naomi's sister sounds like a sociopath, that's all.
I mean, it's crazy. At the end of the day, she's the only reason why we all fought, you know, she is the only reason why none of us are friends.
if it was me, I would keep thinking about the fact that...
they should've believed you in the first place, you know.
Yeah, no, that's true.
I just, sometimes I miss...
what?
I don't know...Everything.
well, whatever you do, I'm here.
and, uh, by the way, what time should I pick you up for the dance?
what?
if you used to have fun at dances, well, then
I see no reason why we won't have fun together.
but dances are not your thing.
making you happy is my thing.
look, I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to protect you.
it came from a good place, but I was wrong.
but you owe me an apology, too.
what you said about me not being your real mom that was incredibly hurtful.
I was just mad.
well, it was a low blow.
I remember when you first came to live with us,
I would watch you sleep at night, wondering if you would ever let me in.
you were so quiet and so withdrawn.
I didn't know what to say.
I mean, I went from sharing a room with my grandmother, praying that we'd have enough money to keep the heat on to this big house in the suburbs.
I knew it would be a hard adjustment.
I just... I don't think I knew how hard.
everything was different.
everything.
I mean, it was like I woke up one morning surrounded by white people I was supposed to bond with...like that.
I never thought I would though.
I kept telling myself, "Dix, just hang in there until you're 18, get yourself out of there."
I kept telling myself, "Just keep trying and maybe one day he won't look so miserable.
you got used to Annie first.
she wouldn't leave me alone.
she kept coming in my room telling me how super-duper it was to have a big brother.
I would watch you with her laughing and I would be so jealous of my eight-year-old daughter.
you know, sometimes I...
I think about my life now, in Beverly Hills, how I got from there to here.
it just doesn't make any sense.
but one thing I never question...
is that you're my mom.
excuse me, everybody.
sorry to interrupt.
I just have a little announcement to make.
and I thought making it public would be a good way to let a certain someone know I'm serious.
I'm done dating.
totally done.
because I met someone very special.
someone I want to commit to.
I mean it, Silver.
I like you more than I've ever liked anyone.
and we're friends which is not the way I've started relationships in the past, clearly.
but with you, everything feels different.
and if you give me a chance, I promise I won't let you down.
so, will you go to the dance with me?
please?
no.
what?
Teddy, stop.
it's not gonna happen.
all right, guys, everyone who already has tickets to the left and if you still have to buy them to the right.
my right, your left.
unless, of course, you're walking backwards.
but, uh, please, don't walk backwards, that would be foolish.
I wanted to say I'm sorry that I believed Jen.
Oh, man, it's okay.
I'm just glad it's over, you know?
thank God, we're rid of her.
Yeah, thank God.
Hey, go, enjoy.
all right, see you later.
two tickets, please.
how you doing, Ade?
fine.
Hi, Annie.
Hi.
how do you guys know each other?
we have gym together.
ade here is quite the newcomer player.
Oh.
are you two dating?
we sure are.
we will catch you later, Ade.
weird.
so, this is what people do at a dance when they don't have dates, huh?
we can go get some more food.
I don't know, I'm not really hungry.
me neither.
she looks beautiful, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, she does.
wish me luck.
uh, hey.
no phones. You're my date.
I just want to confirm our flight 'cause-- oh, my God!
what? - Oh, my God, I'm wearing white and I left the pink shell on my cell phone.
please, let me have put the white one in here!
baby blue, kill me now!
I'd like to.
Oh, thank God!
Amen.
dance with me?
come on, one dance. Between friends.
fine, between friends.
you know, I probably shouldn't leave Naomi for too long since she's my date and all.
I'm sure she'll survive.
Yeah, of course. Of course she will.
is it, is it snowing?
Oh, my God, yeah. I think it is.
that was awesome.
you're ridiculous.
you love it.
these are actually really cute.
how is it...
if you can honestly tell me you didn't feel anything,
I'll stop trying.
you know what?
I-I'm done.
okay, Teddy is officially an ass.
are you okay? What happened?
he says he wants a friendly dance.
we go out there and he tries to make it all romantic.
okay, so what if I felt something when we kissed? That doesn't change the fact...
you just said you felt something when you kissed.
okay, yeah.
so what if I did?
what difference does it make? He's still a player.
but he seems to really, really care about you.
and if you feel the same way, then you have to go for it.
otherwise, the moment could pass.
and the guy you like will end up with some she-male who only has one pair of shoes.
you want to dance, don't you?
no, no, definitely not.
okay, maybe a little bit, but, um, you know, it-it will pass.
let's do it.
are you sure?
just one problem.
I don't know how.
at all?
I've never been to a dance before.
okay. Well then, I am honored to teach you.
all right, so, just put one hand here.
and the other hand here.
and we just move back and forth.
Oh, you're doing it.
with you, I can do anything.
Ugh, awful right?
I swear, I'd be doing her a favor if I vomited on them.
what are you talking about?
Vicki Rosen's shoes.
isn't that what you were looking at?
no, I was watching Annie dance with a drug dealer.
that guy's a drug dealer?
has anyone told Annie? - Yeah, she won't listen.
this is all my fault.
I took away all her friends when I sent that naked text around.
I made it so that she was completely alone.
of course she would end up with a guy like that.
we have to do something, Navid.
Yeah, we've tried. Nothing seems to work.
well, we have to try harder!
Teddy, there you are!
this is my sister, Savannah. Back from boarding school.
this is Dixon. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too.
so, what are you doing here?
well, after getting some of the saddest texts I've ever read,
I wanted to make sure you were okay.
so, come on. Who's this girl that's breaking your heart?
so, one is coconut, one is lemon.
I forgot which is which.
is everything okay?
look, Liam, just be real with me, okay?
do you still have feelings for Naomi?
what? - Dude, do you?
come on, I'm a big girl.
it's not like I'm gonna go cry into my pillow at night if that's what you're worried about.
but...
but I do deserve to know.
Yeah, I do.
that's what I thought.
so, what the hell are you doing hanging around me?
why don't you just go tell her how you feel?
because she doesn't want anything to do with me.
I'm really sorry.
like I said, I'm fine. I'm...
fine.
I'll take that.
look, I have no idea how this got in here.
I know, I confiscated it earlier from some kids.
you know, why don't you take off?
you did a good job tonight.
okay.
have a nice break, Mr. Matthews. - You, too.
I'm just saying, you are quite the natural dancer.
I'm just saying, you're a good liar.
I'm gonna go get us some drinks, I'll be right back.
okay.
uh, Annie. I need you to come with me, it's an emergency.
is everything okay?
no, uh, come on.
what's going on?
Annie, we're here because we care about you.
Annie, Jasper's a really bad guy.
what the hell?
look, we don't want you to get hurt.
what is this? Some kind of misguided intervention?
no, we're just worried about you.
Annie, this is all my fault.
I completely alienated you and I'm so sorry.
but you deserve better.
I can't believe this.
he's a drug dealer, Annie.
he's not.
he is.
and I'm pretty sure he pushed me down the stairs.
what? That is, that's absurd.
no, it's not absurd.
look, I don't know what you think about him but it's not true.
you just have it out for him for some reason.
and you've started a rumor.
a rumor that the rest of you are choosing to believe.
the way that you chose to believe a rumor about me that was not true.
Annie, it's not a rumor. I know this guy's a drug dealer.
what proof do you have?
we don't have proof, per se.
that's what I thought.
I bought drugs from him.
what?
I've been buying from Jasper for the last month.
and I'm willing to come forward.
I'm willing to tell the administration that I did it.
Annie, wait.
look, I just...
I need to be alone.
so, are you seriously willing to go to administration?
he's a really bad guy.
and seeing him with Annie made me realize I have to do something.
that's really selfless.
what if you get suspended, Ade?
well, I hope you don't.
Yeah, me either.
maybe when we get back from St. Bart's...
we can talk and stuff.
I'd really like that.
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
guys, have an amazing trip.
have a good holiday. - Merry Christmas.
what? Oh, my God.
I don't want you to go to the administration.
what, why?
the important thing is that Annie knows the truth.
I'll find some other way to bring Jasper down.
but I could just go...
no, if you come forward, you'll be expelled, Ade.
maybe not.
I'll explain to them that I'm clean now.
no. - No, Navid...
I'm willing to take the risk.
Yeah, you might be, but I'm not.
look, despite what happened between us,
I still care about you, okay?
okay.
Hey. - Hey.
whatcha doing?
uh, I came with Naomi and she had to do something.
so, called a cab and just waiting for it.
cool.
tense night, huh?
Yeah, no kidding.
everything okay?
come on.
I mean, we're friends, right?
it's Teddy.
he's been asking me out.
no kidding.
Yeah, and...
I was actually going to tell him that we should give it a shot.
but I saw him with this blonde girl and...
you were there, actually.
she was gorgeous and in this red dress.
Oh, yeah. - I don't even know why I'm surprised.
I mean, the guy is a huge player, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.
but, hey, I mean, at least you realized it before it was too late, you know?
definitely.
still hurts, though.
look, Silver,
Teddy's my friend.
but, you, you...
you deserve way, way better.
I mean, come on. You're amazing.
stop.
no. You are.
and for the life of me, I...
can't remember why I ever let you go.
what's wrong?
there she is.
the girl I can't get.
let's just get out of here.
what was that?
I, I don't know.
that's my ride.
we, we should talk.
when I get back from St. Barts?
Yeah. Definitely, we should.
Hey, you. How was the dance?
Oh, uh, it was... interesting.
any way I can get half?
you sure can.
Thanks.
you know, I've got to tell you.
I'm so glad we finally got a chance to talk.
I've been thinking about it all day.
Yeah, me, too.
and everything that we talked about.
I hadn't thought about the adoption in a while, you know?
Yeah, me, neither. - And, you know, talking about everything made me realize something.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
I think it's time for me to see my birth mom.
can I come in?
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.
what's that?
nothing. So...
what's going on?
you tell me.
Ivy sent me a text telling me I had to come over here.
there was something you wanted to tell me.
she shouldn't have done that.
well, she did.
and I'm here and I'm about to take off to St. Barts soon.
so what is it that she thought you wanted to tell me?
I don't know.
Why? Is there something you want to tell me?
I asked you first.
and I came over here, Liam.
exactly.
What'd you come over for?
I don't know.
I guess I thought things were going to be different.
you would be different.
but you know what, you're not.
you're private and secretive, just like you always were.
that was the whole problem all along.
you'll never be able to open up.
I mean, you can't tell me what's under your stupid tarp.
whatever. I'm done.
wait.
I'm building a boat.
Yeah.
Why?
things are...bad at home.
they told me at the Wilderness Program to redirect my anger, so...
whenever I get upset, I just come out here.
and I build.
why a boat?
I used to sail.
with my dad before...
before he went away.
Naomi, I'm so sorry.
I should have told you about Jen.
after prom, she came up to me and she told me she was your neighbor.
and all the personal stuff that I had told you, she said she overheard you telling your friends about it, and laughing.
what?
afterwards, when I found out she was your sister,
I realized she lied.
but by then, it was too late.
I didn't want to hurt you.
and like you said, I'm private and secretive.
but I don't want to be.
and if you give me another chance...
I won't be.
Hey, there you are.
I've been looking for you for, like, 45 minutes.
babe, are you okay?
you're a drug dealer.
what are you talking about? - Don't...
don't deny it.
ade told me that you sold to her. I know it's true.
okay.
it is true.
but I, I only sold to people who were going to buy it anyway.
stop. - No, babe, it's all to finance the film.
just stop.
I don't even know who you are.
that is not true.
you know me, Annie, and I know you.
you pushed Navid down the stairs, too, didn't you?
no... - No more lies.
okay, please.
just no more lies.
I didn't push him down the stairs.
I pushed him, then he fell.
look, Annie.
no, don't. Stay away from me.
you don't mean that.
Yeah, I do.
Why? Because I've made some mistakes?
you've made mistakes, but I don't judge you.
what are you talking about?
I accidentally pushed Navid down the stairs.
Finn Court please.
not here. - Excuse me?
checked out about an hour ago.
you know, you really should be a little nicer to me now that I'll be handling your finances.
I know you can take this tennis all the way.
no more distractions, no more girlfriends.
break up with her, Teddy.
I believe in you, and to see you like this, all depressed and down on yourself, it hurts... the worst feeling in the world.
seeing you happy... that means everything to me.
a beautiful girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend?
uh, no, I don't.
there's no one, no special guy, no one.
so, what movie are we going to see, guys? - I don't care, as long as it's not some stupid pop culture piece of crap.
you know, I mean, just because something's popular doesn't mean it's any good.
no, in fact, sometimes, sometimes it's the exact opposite.
lots of people like cigarettes, but they cause cancer.
you have any idea what he's talking about? No.
Yeah, stupid pop culture cancer...
that's what I'm talking about.
dude, what is your problem?
you want to know what my problem is, man?
you want to know what my problem is?
I'll show you my problem.
that.
this right here is my problem.
Hey, can you get out of here, please?!
I'm tired of looking at his face!
aren't you guys broken up?
I know that already, okay?
but maybe I don't want to be.
well, have you told Ade that you ended it with Lila yet?
no, I didn't tell her yet.
dude, that's the first step: you're supposed to tell her.
Yeah, and step two: let her know you want her back.
and step three: Cut a single, become an overnight teen heartthrob.
does he kiss like a teen heartthrob or not?
I don't know. We've been on, like, two dates.
if you guys come to my gig on Friday, you can meet him.
he'll be there.
Aah, Ade, it's your first gig!
I'm so excited!
um, miss, do you have another card?
this one's been declined.
why were my cards declined?
fix this, please.
Oh, let me take a look and see.
they don't work because I canceled them.
you've been spending entirely too much money and, well, you're on a financial diet now, consisting of low-denomination greens...
that's fives and tens, little sister.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, would you excuse me?
I have to sign a check for my shrimp vendor.
I'll ask if he's hiring.
hello.
Hi. This is Jay Boyd.
I don't know a Jay Boyd.
what are you doing?
that's my phone.
hello.
Hi, yes, this, this really isn't a good time.
can I call you back?
okay.
what was that all about?
none of your business.
look, now that I'm in charge, things are going to change... a lot of things.
frugal is the new black.
do you really have to go to Australia all summer?
I mean, I'm gonna really miss you.
you should come.
to Australia?
I mean, if you wanted to.
no, no, I... I want to.
Really?
Yeah, I really want to.
cool.
so I've got an idea.
what if we start our presentation by playing Vivaldi for, like, ten minutes?
which means we'd only have to talk about Vivaldi for, like, five.
Yeah, I think Matthews had something a little more interactive in mind.
but we could do an interpretive dance - while the music plays... - Yeah.
hmm, yeah, and I'm serious.
bring the ballet slippers next meeting.
okay.
so... when did you get out of the hospital?
couple days ago.
my doctors think I'm ready to reintegrate into West Bev, so here I am.
Reintegrating.
well, that's great.
and, um, are you... better?
Yeah. I feel better.
or at least I will, once I say to you what I need to say...
look.
Annie, there's no excuses for what I did.
but I need to explain.
you don't have to.
I do.
I was always an outcast.
and then you came along.
and I saw how much my uncle's death affected you, and I took advantage of that.
I didn't think I was gonna fall in love with you.
but I did.
and then, when you threatened to leave me,
I panicked.
whatever.
I'm not here to make excuses.
I'm here to apologize.
you're one of the good ones, Annie.
if there's any way that you can forgive me, maybe we can be friends.
Jasper, stop.
I can forgive you.
and I do.
you do?
but we can't be friends.
there's just too much that's happened.
I understand.
thanks for listening to me.
okay, so what's the difference between a big tennis practice and a regular tennis practice?
well, a big tennis practice comes before a big tennis tournament.
which I'm gonna win, by the way, earning myself #1 rankings in nationals.
hold your applause.
I can't. Look. I can't.
so, then, you better go.
Yeah, I should definitely go.
Yeah. - Yeah.
okay. Okay.
go.
what?
has Teddy dipped his pen in the OL' inkwell recently?
dipped his pen...?
have you done the mattress mambo?
no, okay?
no, we have not had sex.
but I want to. I really want to.
it's just... okay.
the only time I've ever done it,
I was going through a manic phase.
so, now... I don't know...
I feel like I'm a virgin again, or something.
you know?
I just want it to be right this time.
but how do you know when it's the right time?
I think you'll just know.
what are you doing here?
every now and then I like to stop at high schools and get a little ego boost.
I just wanted to see you.
come. I have a special night planned for us.
um...
I am really not dressed.
I had my assistant pick up a dress and shoes. I hope that's okay.
Oh... are you serious?
is that a yes?
Yes.
let's go.
this is amazing.
you're still pushing your forehand a little.
everyone's an expert from the sidelines.
well, but I know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you got a text from, uh, Silver.
hmm.
still having a little trouble accepting it's over?
actually, uh, it's not.
over.
I thought we decided you were breaking up with her.
hmm. No, you... you decided.
I decided I... I didn't want to.
I love her, dad.
I'm not breaking up with her.
you're not thinking straight.
you got to focus on your tennis right now.
I am focusing on my tennis.
I can do both, okay?
what?
I don't know.
I thought you were different.
I thought you were going to be the one kid of mine that was a success.
uh, hey. Is this a good time?
sure.
Yeah. What's going on?
Ivy and her mom are going to Australia this summer, you know.
just for some fun. And, um, they invited me, so...
absolutely not.
no. Dixon doesn't deserve a trip right now.
what do you mean, he doesn't deserve a trip?
I mean, he's not going.
shouldn't this be a discussion?
you know, um...
it's okay.
no, no. It's not okay.
I happen to think the trip sounds like a really great opportunity if there's parental supervision.
it's not gonna happen.
and in case you've forgotten, I have a say in this, too.
really, please, um...
just forget it.
no, no. We're not going to forget it.
your father and I will discuss it like a couple.
and then we will get back to you.
Hello?
where are you?
Hey, isn't this theater amazing?
please, sit.
what's wrong? You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
uh, Teddy, I don't think you're fine.
come on. What's going on?
it's my dad.
he is such an ass, I swear.
sometimes the only place I feel like I can breathe is here with you.
I mean it.
you make me so happy, Silver.
me, too.
you make me so happy, too.
I thought you wanted to wait.
I did.
now I'm ready.
it just feels so right.
can you believe Jen?
she sent my Mercedes back and is making me drive that hunk of junk.
there was a lot of smoke coming from the exhaust.
I'll take a look at it.
I'm poor, Liam.
what is there to live for?
I have to get my money back. I have to.
I think Jay Boyd is the key.
who's he?
that's the problem... I don't know.
there's like a dozen Jay Boyds in the phone book, but I have to find the right one...
the one that made Jen all jittery and suspicious.
or you could just wait until you turn 18 when you get it back anyway.
are you insane?
I can't live like a pauper for six months.
come on, you're not exactly a pauper.
I can't shop. I can't spa.
I might as well eat fast food out of the trash can.
Naomi, come on.
Oh, my God, I cannot believe you're being so unsympathetic.
I need your support.
I need you to be here for me.
you have got to be kidding me.
all I am is there for you.
in fact, if anyone hasn't been here, it's you.
what are you... what are you talking about?
the fact that you have no idea what's going on in my life for the last month... none.
so for you to say that I'm not there...
whatever, Naomi.
Hey, you ready for bangers and mash?
that's Australian for sausage and hash browns.
you know, you better get used to the lingo, because if you can come up with the money for a ticket, you are going.
to Australia?
you got it, mate.
um, so are you going to talk like that until I leave?
I'll give it a fair go.
Yeah. Thanks, mom.
you're welcome.
Yes!
wait, why is everybody staring at me?
Oh, I don't know.
could have something to do with the limo that pulled up to school yesterday.
which brings me to my next question.
would you be open to doing an interview with the Blaze about what it's like recording with Javier?
Lila was going to ask you to do the story,
wait, Navid and Lila broke up?
Yeah. When?
I don't know... like a week ago.
why wouldn't he tell me that?
why would he tell you that?
no, you're right.
I guess there's no reason to...
okay, what's going on?
do you like Navid? Again?
it doesn't even matter. No, it doesn't matter.
Navid and Lila have been broken up for over a week and if he liked me, he would have told me.
okay.
well, well, well.
if it isn't Mr. Hollywood sign.
Hey, welcome back.
really, we've all missed you.
well, not me, but I'm sure some junkies missed you.
what, they put a straitjacket on your tongue in the nuthouse?
he is crazy.
I wouldn't be surprised if he killed his uncle.
what is wrong with you?
you're pathetic.
you two belong together.
you didn't have to do that.
I did.
Jasper, all of this, everything that's happened...
I mean, it all started with me and your uncle...
Annie, it's not your fault.
it is. If I hadn't...
it's okay.
how can you say that?
you forgave me.
and I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Mr. Montgomery. Hi.
Spence. Please.
Spence. Okay.
are you looking for Teddy?
because he's not here right now.
no, actually, I'm here to talk to you.
Oh, okay.
well, come in.
would you like something to drink or to eat?
I don't actually think I have anything...
I'm fine. Thanks.
I'd like to ask you a question.
how long have you been going out with my son?
uh, officially?
a couple months, I guess.
do you know how long he's been playing tennis?
since he was four.
Wow. That's a long time.
long time.
now he's got this one chance to go pro.
one chance.
do you want to be the one that ruins that for him?
me?
Yeah, your relationship is starting to get in the way.
he's losing focus.
so tell me something. How much is it going to cost to get you to walk away?
what?
100000
$150?
no, no, I think...
I think you should leave.
please.
if you love my son, don't get in the way of his dream.
looks good.
Thanks.
look, Liam, you were right.
I've been entirely too wrapped up in my own life.
but I want to be here for you. I do.
I screwed up.
but I'm here now.
and I promise it will not happen again.
come on.
tell me what's going on.
my dad came back.
what? I thought he was in...
he got out.
early parole.
he just showed up here talking about how he wanted a relationship.
he did?
what happened?
he took off.
I'm sorry, Liam.
whatever. I'm fine.
I know you're fine.
I can't believe I wasn't there for you.
it's okay.
it's not okay.
but like I said, it won't happen again.
you can trust me.
poor people tend to be honorable.
dude, you've got to stop torturing yourself.
romantic night for Javianna.
Javianna? Really?
Hey. Hey.
what's up?
um, nothing.
I was just looking for Silver.
Oh, uh, she's... she's not here.
Oh, okay.
Thanks. - Yeah.
um, so I hear you and Lila broke up.
Oh, uh, yep. Yeah, that we did.
no, but it's cool.
you know, I'm glad to be free.
you know me, I'm not one to be tied down.
so, how about you?
Oh, my God, you saw that?
no, I didn't.
no, I did.
because Dixon showed it to me.
so yeah, I did see it, indirectly.
let me just say that I'm really happy for you, Ade.
I mean, Javier...
Javier... he seems like such a terrific guy.
talented, handsome.
he seems like one of those guys with the, uh, washboard abs. Am I right?
um, yeah, I guess so.
dude, I knew it!
you go, girl!
uh, tomorrow is my first solo show, so in case you want to come.
Oh, cool.
Yeah, I'll run it through the, uh... old calendario.
okay.
Bye.
what the hell is wrong with you?
did I let on that I had too many feelings?
no, no, not at all.
you let on that you have feelings for Javier.
and his washboard abs.
dude, she... she doesn't like me, all right?
see, how can I compete with a guy like that?
I can't serenade her in some fancy theater.
my rabbi made me lip-synch the Torah portion at my bar mitzvah.
all right. Look. I'm sorry.
but you have something that Javier can't sing about, man.
you have a history with Adrianna.
dude, you guys were in love, man.
so tap into that.
and, uh, make your play already.
Yeah.
Yeah.
good game.
let's go. Let's go.
dude, I can't go any lower than 200.
look, look, man.
this represents two years of my life.
carefully cultivated.
all right, I got a playlist for every occasion.
and I'm throwing in my dock, dude. Come on.
Annie's sweet 16 party mix.
Yeah, that was me.
Ah, what the hell?
thank you, man. - Yeah.
what... what was that all about?
making money, baby.
$600 in a day, to be exact.
why are you selling all your stuff?
for our trip to Australia.
my parents said if I could come up with the money for the ticket,
I can go, so, uh...
I'm coming up with the money.
by selling all your stuff?
look, honestly, this trip to Australia is the only thing I'm focusing on right now.
I mean, with everything going on with my parents, going on this trip and, uh, spending my summer with you...
it means everything to me.
I'm so sorry.
I just lost my #1 ranking, which means I just screwed up my draw at nationals, which means I just threw away everything
I've been working for for the past three years.
I shouldn't have lost.
I mean, I've beaten that kid twice.
maybe... maybe he got better.
no.
I shouldn't have stayed up so late last night.
I should have gone to bed.
this isn't working.
our relationship. It's...
it's too much for me and...
it's gotten too serious. It's not what I wanted.
I've been thinking about this for a while, and I just wanted to wait until after your match.
I'm sorry.
no. Silver, wait!
you're gonna knock 'em dead, you know?
thank you.
Oh, my God. Stop kissing or I might take a picture and send it to Perez.
okay, well, on that note, I should probably go.
wait, what? You're not staying for Ade's first real gig?
javier has to go to New York.
he has a gig tomorrow.
good luck.
thank you.
it's a full house out there.
Really? - Yes!
so, uh, um...
did Navid come?
I didn't see him, actually.
Oh, no.
Navid again? Really?
no. There is no "Navid again."
I mean, he's moved on.
and so have I.
dude.
what took you so long?
dude, I had to pick this up.
listen. Um, Navid, look. Uh, I like you, but me and Ivy, we kind of got a good thing...
just shut up.
it's for Ade, okay?
bro.
like you said, we have history.
I just, uh, need to remind her that no one else knows her like I do.
so, uh, here's the 11 and a six because we first kissed on the sixth of November.
and here's her favorite flower.
a little tulip.
and, uh...
her favorite food: a little hamburger with tiny, tiny pickles on it.
cool.
just do me a favor.
when you actually give it to her, lose the baby voice.
gotcha. But I'm not gonna give it to her.
I'm going to put it in her dressing room while she's performing, with a note on it that says, "meet me on the roof."
why the roof?
well, Ade's favorite movie is an affair to remember.
and there's this, like, super-romantic scene where they're supposed to meet on the roof of the Empire State Building.
how cute is this?
a little, mini empire state building.
dude. The voice.
uh, yeah. Whatever.
uh, wish me luck, bro.
gotcha.
Hey, you.
uh... what's wrong?
okay, look. Dixon. I've just...
I've been thinking, and I really don't think you should be selling all your stuff to come to Australia.
I just think it's a little extreme, don't you think?
I mean, how else am I going to get the money?
we're not all rich, you know?
and what do you mean by that?
are you, like, implying that I'm spoiled or something?
no. No. That's not what I meant.
that's kind of exactly what it sounded like, Dixon.
I mean, I'm sorry that my mom has money.
and I'm sorry my parents don't.
you see? This is kind of exactly why you shouldn't be selling your stuff.
I'm sorry. What?
what do you mean,"what"?
Dixon, look at us. We're fighting.
Yeah, because you're being all judgmental.
Oh. Okay. So now, all the sudden I'm judgmental?
you know what? If that's what you think, then you just really shouldn't be coming to Australia at all.
fine. Then maybe we shouldn't be dating at all.
Wow.
okay.
okay, so, for the visual part of the presentation,
I thought we could use some visual aids.
I mean, obviously, we'll use a portrait, but maybe we could actually take one of Vivaldi's scores and blow it up really big.
what?
look, I don't know if this is my place or not, but I saw you with Jasper the other day...
Annie, the guy is a psycho.
no, he's not. He just...
he snapped.
but everything's okay now.
all right? He apologized to me.
you can't really be serious.
look, please, just let's not talk about Jasper.
I know what I'm doing.
so, will you, um, pull up the written part on my laptop while I look through our notes?
Yeah, sure.
What'd you call it?
uh... "Vivaldi," I think.
well, here's a, uh, untitled document.
what just happened?
nothing. Um...
look, I don't feel like doing work anymore, okay?
okay.
that's fine.
I'll just get out of here.
having fun?
uh, not really. No.
me and Ivy just got into a fight.
and, um, I think we broke up.
me and Teddy...
we kind of broke up, too.
Really?
I'm sorry.
it sucks.
Yeah. It really sucks.
Hey, Dixon!
my man! Your music library?
it's friggin' awesome, dude.
and I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm drunk.
uh, good to know, man.
but I am!
I'm seriously wasted!
you guys want some vodka?
sure. Why not?
okay.
Mademoiselle?
sure.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Hey. What are you doing out here?
okay. What's wrong, hon?
I broke up with Dixon.
what? Why?
last I heard, he was coming away with us.
I know, I know. But, you know, then he starts selling all of his stuff to pay for his ticket, and...
And?
and I don't know.
it just suddenly became, like, the biggest thing in his life.
you know, it was all he could talk about.
I mean, what if we get to Australia and, you know, we don't even get along?
well, then, we'll just have to drive him to the outback and ditch him.
it's not funny.
or we could take him to the airport.
you freaked out, huh?
I totally freaked out.
I get why you're freaked out, but, Ivy, sweetie, instead of picking a fight, you know, maybe you could have talked to Dixon about how you were feeling...
right?
are you sure the bathroom is this way?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
no clue?
not a one.
not a one.
Oh, wait.
here it is! - Ah!
ladies first.
Thanks.
Dixon, one question.
huh?
what is it about this place that says "ladies' room" to you?
what?
it's a broom closet!
you sent me to go to the bathroom in a broom closet!
okay, okay, guilty as charged.
let's, let's go. - Wait... wait... wait.
can I say one thing before we leave our broom closet forever?
forever!
Ivy's an idiot for breaking up with you because you, Dixon Wilson, you are a great guy.
Oh, stop.
thank you. - Yeah.
and, uh, I mean, I have to say, too, uh, Teddy is a complete idiot because you, Miss Erin Silver...
you are a great girl.
thank you!
no problem, no problem.
listen...
no, no, this is a total... It was a mistake.
total, total mistake 'cause...
Yeah, yeah.
we're both drunk.
exact. Totally drunk, and, um, to... totally idiotic.
totally idiotic! So it never...
Yeah, yeah, nothing.
never happened.
never happened.
okay. - Yeah, uh, ladies first.
all right.
Hey, Dixon, can I, um...
can I talk to you for a second?
I'll see you later.
sure.
okay, look, I messed up, okay?
I know. I just...
I don't even know.
I guess I'm kind of this...
you know, no-strings-attached kind of girl, and, and somehow in my mind,
australia just kinda became like this marriage.
no offense or anything, but to me, it was just a trip.
right.
a chance to get away for a summer with a cool girl and maybe see a kangaroo or something.
I know. I just freaked out.
but...
I do really want you to come if you still want to.
come here.
Hey. Good job.
Hey, you were great out there.
thank you.
amazing!
what are you still doing here?!
I thought you had to catch a plane to New York.
one of the perks of private planes.
I stayed for the first song, and I just couldn't leave.
Oh, stop it.
no, really.
which got me thinking.
and perform our duet onstage?
you're kidding, right?
no, there's a car outside, but we have to leave now.
now? As in now?
as in five minutes ago now.
what about my stuff?
my assistant will pack your dressing room and make sure everything is in the hotel, and anything else you need we'll just buy in New York.
you in?
Yeah, I'm in.
I am totally in!
let's go.
we're off to New York! Come out and see us there!
Bye.
Hey, Dixon. - What's up, dad?
how could you even ask if you could go to Australia?
what were you thinking?
well, look, I thought it would be a great opportunity, and mom told me that you and her talked about it...
Yeah, yeah, we did, and of course, she said you could go because she doesn't know what happened.
she doesn't know about the gambling, about the breaking into school.
well, then maybe you should tell me about it.
how's the surfing going?
how's it going?
Yeah, I mean, have you learned any new tricks recently?
I mean, I don't really do tricks.
what's all this interest in surfing?
Ooh, potential housekeeper.
I'll call her back after lunch.
what do you mean?
we have Rosa.
why would we need another housekeeper?
Oh, we, uh, we had to let Rosa go.
what? Why?
she stole some coins from Jeffrey's collection.
I...
I don't think that could be true.
I mean, it can't be.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
look, can I see you?
I really need to talk.
Yeah, listen, um... can we talk later?
I'm actually in bed.
I think I have the flu.
are you okay?
do you need anything?
just rest. I'll call you back, okay?
all right.
up yours, loser!
listen, I'm really sorry that I butted into your business last night.
no, no, um, I'm sorry I overreacted.
I was just in a bad mood.
no, it's fine.
it happens.
listen, I could really use your advice.
can we meet in the park? - Of course.
all right.
Bye.
uh, what are you doing here?
more to the point, what are you doing here?
Oh, so you must be Jay Boyd?
are you having an affair with my sister?
God, no.
no offense, sweetie.
Naomi, this is my new assistant Leo.
well, who's Jay Boyd then?
why'd you act like you were hiding something when he called you on the phone?
Dr. Boyd will see you now.
okay, thank you.
because, Naomi, I was hiding something.
you got me.
Jay Boyd is my OB.
surprise!
you're gonna be an auntie.
what the hell?
is he stalking you?
maybe we could be friends.
there's just too much that's happened.
I got this for Ade.
I'm gonna put it in her dressing room while she's performing with a note on it that says,"Meet me on the roof.
we're off to New York. Come out and see us there.
you know how long he's been playing tennis?
since he was four.
do you want to be the one that ruins that for him?
our relationship - it's too much for me, and this isn't working.
it was a mistake. - Totally idiotic.
I've been thinking about the tackle shop.
just gonna take some time. Maybe I can help speed things up.
we had to let Rosa go.
Why?
she stole some coins from Jeffrey's collection.
look, can I see you? I really need to talk.
Yeah, listen, um, can we talk later?
I'm actually in bed. I think I have the flu.
I could really use your advice.
who's Jay Boyd then?
why did you act like you were hiding something when he called you on the phone?
Dr. Boyd will see you now.
surprise!
and there's your baby, Jen.
Oh, my gosh. Oh. Can you believe it?
um, no. Not really.
it's just Jen's hardly human.
who would have thought she could reproduce?
what's the matter, Naomi? Are you disappointed that I'm pregnant?
I bet you were hoping I was having a love affair with a coke-addled chimpanzee.
sorry, hon. Nothing that blackmail-worthy.
I don't know. I'm not ruling out the whole chimp thing.
what do you mean you don't validate?
I don't have money for this. What am I supposed to do?
get a job.
at 24 weeks, you'll be feeling some kicking.
Oh, please. She's a regular David Beckham.
all right.
excellent...
so you'll need to see Dr. Boyd in two weeks.
so, are you going to tell your step-dad that you were the one that took the coins?
if I do, he'll send me away.
or I-I don't know. Press criminal charges probably.
my life, school, surfing, friends
I mean, all that would be over.
I would never see you again.
or, you know, see anyone from West Bev.
well, um, you know, Maybe you can make this right.
maybe you could earn money and send it to your housekeeper, or you could help her find a new job or something.
maybe. I don't know. I just. .
I messed up, and I hurt someone.
Yeah.
well, you're lucky.
you know, you've got options.
sometimes you mess up, and there's no way that you could ever fix it.
you were amazing. - You were amazing.
we both were amazing.
that was so amazing.
what is all this stuff?
um, just gifts from my fans.
chocolate, stuffed animals. I don't know.
underwear.
I don't know.
uh, some of this stuff is from the L. A. show.
Really?
this is not exactly my style.
Oh, I think it's sweet.
you keep it.
Really?
it's my gift to you.
can you help me put it on?
Yup.
what's up?
you want to walk me to class?
sure.
want to go to this party thing?
what, that thing? What is this?
well, actually, it's like a tradition.
you know, uh, it's like the senior class passing the torch down to the junior class.
the guys wear tuxes. The junior girls wear red.
senior girls wear white. Food, dancing. Should be fun.
right, because school-sanctioned dancing sounds like a real hoot.
okay, you know what? Get down. - What?
Oh, you know you have a bad attitude.
I forgot to tell you.
so the water in Australia goes down the drain counterclockwise.
I'm sorry. I think that's rad.
what?
we're going to Australia.
I know. I'm so stoked.
and Dixon, I got to tell you, I'm so glad we got over that stupid fight thing.
I definitely learned my lesson, and as long as we're honest with each other, it's all good.
Yeah. Totally. Come on.
let's go. - Yeah.
we all know the universe is expanding, but is it slowing down, or is it accelerating, hmm?
I want you to partner up and start plotting the supernovae redshift data.
and maybe we'll figure out what's going on with this universe of ours.
dude, Mr. Reiss is so high.
it's like his mind supernova-ed from thinking about the universe too much.
uh, yeah.
look, I have something I have to tell you.
I mean, I-I can't not tell you.
remember that day that we broke up at Adrianna's concert?
Yeah. What, for, like, two minutes?
um, yeah.
I ended up kissing Silver.
now, look, we were both sad and-and drunk, and I swear, from the bottom of my heart, it didn't mean anything. All right?
I don't like her; she doesn't like me;
but I can't keep a secret from you.
I have to be honest.
man, you know what?
Dixon, you know what?
screw you. - What?
I don't need to play second fiddle to another girl anymore.
I have gone on that ride, and I'm done.
you're not playing second fiddle.
Yeah. Right.
known for his scathing yet romantic depiction of frivolous upper-class Americans...
... F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered unparalleled in the elegance and grace of his fiction.
you recognize that?
Yeah, well, that's from my paper.
no, that is from a per that Ms. Genlow pulled off a Web site called Greatpapersforcheap. com.
I'm sorry. What? - You know what?
I don't think you know what's going on here.
with this infraction, you're going to get an F in English, and with an F in English, you're not going to graduate this year.
Yeah, I just...
you know, I don't think it's gonna be that bad.
I feel fairly confident that you can talk to Ms. Genlow and convince her to look the other way.
Ah. Why would I do that?
well, because otherwise, I'll tell the superintendent how you covered up the fact that your son broke into the school the night of the vandalism.
I'll do it, too.
come on, people. Let's hustle!
Hey. Oh, my God, when is Obama gonna outlaw gym class?
I mean, Guantánamo Bay-- yeah, that's great.
what about phys ed? Seriously. Am I right?
what's going on?
why haven't you returned my calls?
how are u feeling?
fine. I mean, fine.
you know, considering I was pretty sick.
it wasn't the flu, actually. It was, uh...
it was food poisoning.
serves me right for eating the cafeteria sushi.
just stop. Stop lying.
I know you weren't sick. I heard a car honking.
you were driving, and you pretended you were in bed.
or maybe the sushi thing happened afterwards, and I wasn't exactly in bed per Se.
you know what? Naomi, I'm... It's over.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
I mean, we never had much in common; you're self-centered;
and you lied to me too many times.
I mean, I forgave the Cannon thing, but I just needed to talk to you, and you pretended you had the flu.
it's just too much. I'm done.
Oh, my God!
like you're so perfect.
like you always do the right thing.
no. I don't.
but this-- you and me-- we're done.
so your singing career has really taken off, hasn't it, Adrianna?
it's been amazing.
uh, I was recently signed by Laurel Cooper at Witgate Records, and it's been so great.
word has it that you just did a duet in New York with Javier.
Yes, I did. It was crazy.
and I think that all of West Bev is extremely proud of your accomplishments.
so, you and Javier are dating. Am I right?
tell us what's it like to date someone so famous and successful.
uh, it's been good.
I mean, he's a really sweet guy.
we've just started to get to know each other, but...
okay, uh, cut. Uh, I'm sorry. We, uh... we need to cut.
uh, this is The Blaze: Live Edition, Navid. We can't cut.
Yeah, we can if I say we can. And the-the lighting looks weird.
and-and-and I want to discuss wardrobe and, um...
I need to talk to Adrianna right now.
no. Can you just please go?
okay.
Navid, what's going on?
okay. - Look, can I, uh...ask you a couple of my own personal questions?
like, for instance, uh, I don't know
where did you get that bracelet?
it was a gift from Javier. - From Javier?
Yeah. Javier gave me this bracelet. What?
and so Javier happens to know that your favorite flower is tulips.
Oh, and... and Javier also knows that, uh, you love butterflies and that your favorite food is hamburgers, right?
Oh, and there - the 11 and the six.
javier also, uh, coincidentally put those on there because he knows the first time you and I kissed - was on November 6. - November 6.
this is from you?
what's going on?
looks to me like it's The Blaze: Live Edition.
uh, you-you can date Javier.
uh, you can fall deeply in love with him.
a whole brood of-of-of Javier Juniors with amazing abs.
uh, you can do that for the rest of your-your-your entire life.
you can do all that.
but you can't do it wearing my bracelet.
who didn't turn off their camera?
not I.
my bad. Navid yells, I... I panic.
give it back, Ade.
can you give it back? Give me back my bracelet.
I don't want to give it back, Navid.
Navid! - Leave us alone, Silver.
what do you mean you don't want to give it back?
I don't want to give it back.
I didn't think you liked me, all right?
okay, I know I am a lot of drama, and I-I just didn't think that you liked me.
well, I do.
yeah?
I like you.
but I know you're dating Javier, and he's famous and sexy and famous and...
I'm just Navid.
I can't begin to compete with that.
no.
that's where you're wrong, Navid, okay?
no one can compete with you.
I'm so happy for them.
you okay?
no. No, not at all.
Liam just broke up with me.
Oh, sweetie, come here.
the surface of this crème brulée, it isn't hard enough, okay?
crème brulée -- well, it's like a woman.
it should seem impenetrable and then tap, tap...
Ah, mm, and you're in.
Comprende?
can I talk to you?
Yeah, uh, okay. Tio, thank you.
is it true?
are you pregnant with my kid?
who... told you that?
I saw a paternity test.
how did you even... ?
how did you get my DNA?
you left your gnarly hairbrush at my house.
Oh, my God.
so it's true.
I'm gonna be a father.
you know what?
I'm not going to mess this up.
I'm going to get my life back on track.
I want to be there for my kid. I do.
I don't make a lot of money, but I have some savings, and the good thing about my job is I get summers off, and...
look, basically, Jen, I want to do whatever I can to help raise this baby.
our baby.
I don't need your help.
thank you very much, Ryan.
I'll he nannies and baby nurses for that kind of thing.
wait, no, but this is my baby too, Jen. I have rights.
which I will fight you for in court.
look, just give up, Ryan, okay?
my baby doesn't need a public schoolteacher as a father.
wait.
if you will excuse me, I have a prenatal yoga class.
what's going on?
you owe me an explanation.
he came over-- your dad.
he, uh, he offered me money to break up with you.
150000
I hate him!
I mean, he thinks just 'cause he has money, and he's Spence friggin' Montgomery, that he can do whatever he wants.
God, he's a jerk!
Yes, yes. Okay, he's a jerk.
Yes. I'm sorry.
if you... if you didn't take the money, then why did you break up with me?
cause your dad's a jerk, but he's also right.
I was getting in the way of your tennis career.
I care about you too much to be the one to stand in the way of that.
I'm not going to.
if you care about me so much, then why won't you listen to me?
I want you in my life.
I need you in my life.
and-and I can do both.
I can have tennis and a relationship with you.
I'm sorry.
it's over.
okay, I'm ready to leave.
Oh, no. Shut up.
just because we are single does not mean we can't have a fabulous time.
Yeah, I don't think being single is what's holding me back.
Oh, yeah? Well, what is?
I don't know-- being in a horrifically crappy mood.
I don't get it. How come you're not in a crappy mood?
because Liam is a loser. And I'm fantastic.
and I'm going to meet someone like a thousand times better.
and we just have to keep our chins up so people don't pity us, and as a bonus, we won't get that whole pelican neck thing in our photos.
come on.
come on, sing with me, Silver. What?
what are you staring at?
Ah, Teddy.
can I ask you a question?
why did you break up with him?
you know why. I just want what's best for him.
and how do you know what's best for Teddy?
isn't that the same patronizing attitude his father has?
shouldn't Teddy get a chance to make decisions for himself?
there you are.
Hey.
um, I have something to tell you.
no, wait. Me first.
I want you to open for me on tour.
what?
it'll be a huge opportunity for you.
and we'll get to travel together, and...
stop.
I got back together with Navid.
Why? - I love him.
I'm so sorry, Javier.
Hey, getting ready to sing for these lucky kids?
Yeah.
what's wrong?
Adrianna just broke up with me.
but it's not over till it's over.
there you are. Wow, you're dressed up.
Yeah, well, I was getting ready for the party when I got your text.
but it's cool. I got time. What's up?
um, well, I came clean.
I told my mom that I stole the coins.
you did?
Yeah, and when my step-dad gets back from Miami, I'm going to tell him, too.
at which point, my life will essentially be over, but...
no, which brings me to my point...
and my text.
I'm so glad you made it because I really wanted you...
I wanted you here for this.
for-for what? What-what's going on?
take a look.
Oh, my gosh. Liam, it's your boat!
it's on the water! I mean...
it floats. Yeah, I know. - Yeah!
Oh, it's amazing, Liam.
so does it work? I mean, does it sail?
let's find out.
okay.
I can't believe you did this.
man, I'm gonna get out of here.
sorry for the interruption.
would Ivy Sullivan please report to the planetarium?
Ivy Sullivan to the planetarium, please.
Ooh... Oh, shut up.
Hello?
Hello?
early astronomers believed in the geocentric theory that the earth was the center of the universe
but in the 16th century,
copernicus presented evidence for the heliocentric theory that the sun was the center of the universe
but recently, Dixon Wilson has come up with a new understanding of our universe, he calls...Ivy-centric.
you're it, Ivy.
you're the only girl in this world for me.
I mean, you're the center of my universe.
please forgive me.
God, you're crazy, Dixon.
crazy about you.
and also a little crazy, you know.
man, I've been working on this nonstop ever since we fought.
turns out Mr. Reiss has some connections here, so, uh...
if you don't take me back, hopefully I'll at least get a little extra credit.
so what do you say?
okay.
okay, what?
okay...
I would really like to be back with you.
and it'd be nice if you'd still come to Australia 'cause I'd really like you to.
for real?
Yes, for real.
better get home and get your bags packed.
we leave tonight.
go.
and have fun.
I was wrong.
I love you and I want to listen to you, and...
if you think that you can play tennis and be with me, then it's your decision.
Hey, you want to dance with me? - Sure.
howdy, Laurel and Hardy.
how are we?
Ryan, you're in a good mood.
not really.
Yeah, actually, feeling more like a piece of trash 'cause I, uh, was excited to be a father, you know, not just a father figure but, like, a father.
you're wasted.
no, what's the matter?
I mean, I thought you were down with the fun, baby.
R-Ryan, you need to go home.
you need to go home and you need to sleep this off.
go home.
the West Beverly Hills High School class of 2010 hereby passes the torch to the class of 2011.
ladies and gentlemen, the class of 2011.
Hey, I need to get back to the school.
I can't believe they made us take shuttles.
ridiculous.
well, you just missed one.
so drive me now.
next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes.
15 minutes?
I'm sorry you missed the party.
Ugh, I'm not.
Hey, how come you didn't name the boat?
I thought I knew what I wanted to call it, but, uh...
I changed my mind, so...
I guess the future is still unwritten.
what are you thinking?
I just-- I can't believe that you're going to tell your stepfather the truth.
I mean, it's going to be rough.
Yeah.
so why?
I made a lot of mistakes in the past.
I've done drugs, I've been violent.
I didn't tell people the truth about what happened with Jen.
I'm really sorry about that, I...
but this year has changed me.
I became someone who really wants to do the right thing.
so yeah, yeah, it's going to be tough when I confess, but if I didn't, I don't know what that would do to me.
I don't think I'd be able to live with myself.
Yeah, well, you're a better person than I am.
Nah, you would do the same thing if you were in my position.
no, actually, I've done far worse and I haven't come clean.
I was the one who killed Joe Herman.
Naomi had that prom after party last year, and I was really upset and drunk.
and I drove like that.
I was coming down Mulholland when I hit something, and I just panicked.
I didn't even get out of the car.
I couldn't get out of the car.
I just drove home and secretly got the car fixed the next morning, and I hoped that, you know, it was a coyote or something.
but it wasn't.
I-I found out online that I had hit a person.
a man.
and-and he was in a coma and then he died.
and his name...
his name was Joe Herman...
and he was a...a human being and I killed him.
what are you doing?
packing.
why are you staring like that?
what makes you think you're going to Australia?
nobody said I couldn't.
Oh, well, then let me be clear
you can't. - What? !
Dixon, when I said yes, I had no idea the trouble that you'd gotten into.
mom, I've been planning this for, for ages.
I already promised Ivy.
look, this is an opportunity for me to go to Australia. Please.
no.
so what, I'm supposed to stick around here all summer and listen to you and Dad fight?
the decision is final, Dixon.
where were you?
I had a meeting with the superintennt.
at this time of night? What were you doing?
getting fired.
what? !
there's some kid in the senior class that tried to blackmail me for trying to protect Dixon.
and I had to go to to Ms. Angus and tell her the truth;
it was the only thing to do.
and they let me go.
do you have anything to say on the subject?
maybe you shouldn't have lied.
that's all you have to say - maybe I shouldn't have lied?
I lose my job-- everything and all you can say is, maybe I shouldn't have lied?
you want some words of wisdom from me?
some advice? Well, it's too late.
maybe you should have come to me before you made our lives a total mess.
I made a total mess of our lives?
I was doing what I thought was right!
I was protecting our son!
who said that's what Dixon needed? !
what about consequences?
he needs to learn that actions have consequences.
and, yes, you, you did make a mess of our lives.
how can you say that?
Oh, God-- don't you get it, Harry?
we don't have anything!
you don't have a job.
we don't have savings.
and we don't love each other anymore!
is that true?
