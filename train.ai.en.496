the adb expects these dynamics to change as the year progresses, as exports fall and capital flows abate with a return of risk aversion.
the adb has accelerated private equity fund (pef) investments since 2003 and now has stakes in about 40 funds.
the adb has been criticised by other multilateral agencies after haruhiko kuroda, the president, recently blocked the unanimous recommendation of a board committee to extend the term of the director-general of the bank's operations evaluation department.
the adb has twice downgraded its growth estimates as the sorry truth comes home that, if westerners are not spending, asians have little cause to make things for them to buy.
the adb has warned before of the dangers of growth fuelled by natural bounty and cheap labour.
the adb instead recommends governments focus on policies that lift the incomes of the poor, such as improving rural access to health, education and social protection.
the adb is also prepared to take a small equity stake in private sector ventures.
the adb is likely to increase its asian region growth estimates when it publishes an economic update next month.
the adb notes, however, that the value of total merchandise trade between east asia and south asia increased eightfold between 1990 and 2007, with each region exporting according to its comparative advantage.
the adb pared the growth outlook for south-east asia from 5.5 per cent to 5.4 per cent this year as downward revisions for malaysia and thailand offset upgrades for the philippines and singapore.
the adb plays a complementary and growing role to the world bank in providing development assistance to africa.
the adb presidency is 'that of the japanese,' said bambang brodjonegoro, acting head of fiscal policy at the indonesian finance ministry, this week.
the adb regularly publishes estimates for how much it will cost to build world-class infrastructure in the region.
the adb report also repeated earlier calls for emerging asian economies to review ways of controlling destabilising swings in capital flows, including minimising speculative investment from overseas.
the adb report notes that by using spending between$ 2 and$ 13 a day as the gauge, the world bank's martin ravallion puts india's middle class at 264 million.
the adb report says that, even if the markets may have reached bottom, the eventual recovery could still be drawn-out.
the adb stressed: "it is sub-optimal for developing asia to continue to invest all its reserves in safe and liquid but low-yielding assets."
the adb warns that "inadequate" and "uncompetitive" transport, communication, and logistics sectors, coupled with high fuel prices, mean that businesses in asia face high costs relative to other parts of the world when they try to move goods into, out of, and around the region.
the adb's comments come as beijing considers demands from washington for a revaluation of the renminbi, which is regarded by many lawmakers as heavily undervalued against the dollar.
the adb's economists find that trade in parts is much less sensitive to changes in the real exchange rate than trade in finished products.
the adb's estimates take into account falling stock market valuations and losses in the value of bonds supported by mortgages and other assets, though not financial derivatives.
the adb's warning comes as global risk appetite, including for asia, has been damped by the eurozone's travails.
