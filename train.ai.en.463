I can't even hear this anymore. Alex!
no matter what we do, it's.
no matter what we do, none of us can say we will surely succeed, because there is no such thing as plain sailing.
no matter what we do, she's always two steps ahead of us.
but until today, I didn't realize
and he swore to tell the truth.
and he sworehe'd never do them again.
and he swung in by the gate and stopped.
to be honest, I was glad to get your call.
I thought... What the hell?
I can't even hear what you said. What did you say?
right. What other reason could you possibly have
I can't even hear what you said. What did you say?
I can't even hear you.
I can't even hear, mate? You're making my head hurt.
great. A little cold.
and he swung me across the room, and it went off.
to be honest, I was glad to get your call.
I thought... What? That I was fucking him?
that's none other than
no matter what we do, there's always another body.
no matter what we do, we'll always be Japs to them.
no matter what we do.
no matter what we find in there,
is he always like that?
I can't even hear, mate? You're making my head hurt.
I can't even hit a target in daylight.
to be honest, I was surprised he knew where I was, we moved so often.
to be honest, I was talking about you.
to be honest, I was talking about you.
that's none such an entirely bad little man with the red head, he has some spunks of decency.
right. What pub? I forget.
right. What song is that from?
right. What the hell, then?
right. What the hell.
is he always like that? Like what?
great. A little higher on the boom.
great. A madman in my kitchen!
great. A maid gets a millionaire, my daughter gets a chauffeur.
great. A sex party, and we're sending in pat Boone.
I can't even hug you, what if you need a hug?
I thought... When I'm gonna die, where's my soul?
I can't even hug you?
I can't even hurl myself!
right. What was it?
is he always like this on a stakeout?
is he always like this when he loses?
is he always like this?
great. A take - out ghost.
that's nonsense.
no matter what we have to do.
I thought... You could help me overhaul my own image.
but until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
but until toxicology comes back, which could take weeks,
but until tunisian companies themselves start investing in these marginalised parts of the country, foreign investors will likewise hold back.
right. What we need is someone who is high ranking in the Miami beach government.
I can't even identify a brand.
is he always like this? Actually, this is quite charming.
great. A welcoming Committee. What are we gonna do?
great. A welcoming Committee.
and he sympathised with Goethe's feeling for nature as an organism,
and he take... Oksana
and he takes advantage of women, so, as a friend...
when you forget about what's up there...
but until very recently science was
to be honest, I wasn't craving pie, I was craving company.
to be honest, I wouldn't put it past any of them.
to be honest, I'd be rather reluctant to see a film.
is he always like this? Always. Yes.
when you forget to give me something for my birthday,
when you forget your pain and think or theirs,
no matter what we say he keeps on harping on the same string.
when you forgive some other guy,
and he takes all our money home?
and he takes an instant dislike to you?
and he takes cash.
and he takes his claws, and pushes the soil out of the way.
and he takes his job very seriously.
and he takes his pistol and he points it at this man,
great. A wise - ass.
that's nonsense. No, everything is just fine.
that's nonsense. Without money, I would be so sad I would commit suicide at once.
that's normal - sometimes this test causes vertigo.
when you forgive you do not only release the other person. You set yourself free from all of that agony too.
but until we can confirm your story,
when you forgive you do not only release the other person. You set yourself free from all of that agony too.
to be honest, I'd rather this be off - camera.
to be honest, I'm a little afraid to think.
and he takes it for the out.
when you forgot about everyone else in your life, who did you come to for help?
is he always like this? Does he ever speak?
when you forgot about everyone else in your life, who did you come to for help?
no matter what we say or do, it will hurt.
when you form a conclusion about people <
right. What we need is someone who is high ranking in the Miami beach government.
right. What were the pictures for?
right. What you bring to the party.
right. What you got there is like a, it's more like pasta right?
right. What'd he tell her?
right. What'd he tell her?
right. What's happening?
great. A woman, I hope.
great. Accept the challenge.
no matter what we say.
when you form a family of your own,
but until we can determine exactly what... Yes, of course.
when you form a family of your own,
and he takes it for the out.
and he takes me for a fool, too. Maybe it is too original.
right. What's he doing here? Uh, he can't sell his house
is he always like this? How can you stand it?
that's normal because of the blood pressure medicine.
that's normal commercial practice.
that's normal commercial practice.
that's normal for a shopping mall. Why?
but until we can determine the severity of the stroke,
I thought... You could help me overhaul my own image.
I thought... You have such a great look
and he takes responsibility in open court.
right. What's my motivation?
right. What's on the cover?
I can't even identify the purse snatcher.
I can't even imagine - the perks gotta be great.
I can't even imagine Adam
to be honest, I'm glad you called.
I can't even imagine Adam
I thought... You know, I didn't agree with all of it.
I thought... You know, I didn't agree with all of it.
and he takes some of the columns, actually steals some of
right. What's on the cover?
is he always like this? Yeah, he is.
right. What's that goofy thing again?
right. What's that one called?
that's normal in Guatemala.
right. What's that supposed to mean?
to be honest, I'm having a struggle with the denouement.
to be honest, I'm just happy you got him to join in the game.
to be honest, I'm meeting him soon.
to be honest, I'm meeting him soon.
and he takes the earring.
no matter what we think, she has that right.
is he always like this? Yeah. Did you bring it?
is he always on the phone?
but until we can figure out a way
that's normal in new York. Many broads are like that.
that's normal under extreme stress events.
I can't even imagine a scenario where this works out well for us.
I can't even imagine a world without her in.
I thought... You know, we're talking about swagger,
I thought... You must be hiding something.
and he takes the stage tonight.
no matter what we went through.
is he always so changeful and abrupt?
is he always so charming?
is he always so charming? Oh, he's just a lazy mall cop.
right. What's that?
great. Accommodations were wonderful.
to be honest, I'm not sure.
I can't even imagine doing what you're doing.
I can't even imagine explaining that to the judges,
when you fought in the swamp, why didn't you kill him?
and he takes us on this endless ride, up through the mountains.
no matter what we're afraid of finding or how much it may hurt.
no matter what weird thing you ever did,
is he always so cold?
that's normal, believe it or not.
great. Actually, it's very, very good.
to be honest, I'm not sure.
to be honest, I'm not that keen on domestic duties.
I can't even imagine getting married without you.
I thought... You said you were playing bridge.
and he takes us to, like, these amazing places.
no matter what wilson savs, I'll post the letter.
no matter what word you use, you know that you're talking about treasure.
is he always so...? Clark - like?
that's normal, but in a movie, it isn't right.
that's normal, killing them
that's normal, they're pregnant.
that's normal. I hear the Jonas brothers get scared before every concert.
that's normal.
that's not - He does it better.
that's not - I -
and he takes you hostage.
to be honest, I'm overwhelmed.
and he takes.... I took a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.
to be honest, I'm overwhelmed.
and he talked about how he felt he was recovering,
to be honest, I'm pretty tired of her.
and he talked about how on the one side,
is he always such a hard-ass?
is he always that fired up?
is he always that friendly?
right. What's the pitch?
that's not - Why I'm freaking out.
I can't even imagine how bad that shit must sting.
and he talked about how people suffered and died for Jesus.
no matter what words you use,
great. Alert.
I can't even imagine how hard it must be
is he always that intense?
I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you.
that's not -
that's not - I have to go.
that's not - I wouldn't say burnt.
that's not - answer the question.
and he talked about the different timings of fever.
no matter what wrong I've done.
when you foul up, and you will foul up...
when you found Colonel Sumner.
right. What's the point?
when you found her, had she tied her hands and weighed herself down?
I can't even imagine how terrible it must have been for you.
when you found her, had she tied her hands and weighed herself down?
to be honest, I'm pretty tired of her.
to be honest, I'm quite surprised by it.
to be honest, I'm quite surprised by it.
but until we can figure out this soul business of yours,
I can't even imagine how terrible it must have been for you.
great. All I need is one.
is he always that rude?
right. What's this, uh -
right. What's weird...
I thought... You thought?
I thought... You were starting to open your heart to me,
I thought... You were starting to open your heart to me, like I was to you.
to be honest, I'm really surprised this is your first time.
no matter what year it was.
no matter what you and I ever do in our lives,
no matter what you and I think.
no matter what you and I think.
no matter what you and mom think.
no matter what you and your pen - pushing immigrant boy scouts might think.
no matter what you are before entering university, being a child of a wealthy family, a son or daughter of government officials, or a student from a major city, you are expected to meet the same criteria there: to learn specialty knowledge, to cultivate moral character and to accumulate humanistic thoughts.
no matter what you are fishing for whether it's bass, bluegill, trout, marlin, tuna or shark, there are only three basic kinds or reels.
no matter what you believe, you don't want all those innocent people to die.
to be honest, I've been struggling to understand all this.
but until we can get something definitive,
I can't even imagine how you must feel, but I just...
great. All I've had is fruits and vegetables...
I can't even imagine how you must feel. don't worry about me.
and he talked about the future of the world
no matter what you call what words you use,
no matter what you call, the E.R.'s gonna win.
no matter what you can't turn back.
no matter what you celebrate,
no matter what you celebrate, the holidays should be spent with peoplyoyou love.
but until we catch this cab driver, my phone's not going to stop ringing.
that's not - it's not what I meant.
that's not - she - she held me up there for weeks.
great. All right, 8:00?
when you found her, what was she doing?
when you found her, what was she doing?
no matter what you choose to experience while visiting Springdale, you can count on the comfort and convenience of the BEST WESTERN Zion Park Inn.
no matter what you choose...
no matter what you decide to do.
but until we catch this cab driver,
is he always this funny...
is he always this funny? Not always.
is he always this gullible? Oh, heads up.
is he always this impatient?
great. All right, gang here's the scene.
that's not - she's - okay.
that's not - that's not better. No, what I meant is -
that's not - that's the world you've chosen.
right. What's your real name?
but until we come up with a better system, if I have brain surgery, I want it done by a doctor who went to an amazing medical school.
I can't even imagine how.
is he always this juvenile?
I can't even imagine if...
I can't even imagine it,
I can't even imagine looking into the eyes of the person you love...
I can't even imagine looking into the eyes of the person you love
right. What, are you moving to Paris?
right. What, you just came to check up on me, or...?
I thought.... England.
I can't even imagine my baby being 21.
but until we defeat the overlords...
I can't even imagine that.
is he always this late?
I can't even imagine that. This is a small town.
that's not - well, Lorraine, you do me right,
that's not -
that's not Blackwood.
right. What, you think I'm lying?
and he talked her into building this motel.
and he talked me out of doing something really stupid.
and he talked to a priest.
but until we devise a way of communicating...
I thought...... I thought that you meant drug drugs.
is he always this qulet?
I can't even imagine two mornings each week to myself. Yet here it is.
that's not Christmas, honey.
that's not Churchill, my old mum.
that's not Ellis, Adele.
great. All right, gang here's the scene.
great. All right, get to it. All right, me on.
great. All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
great. All right, last stitches in.
great. All right, let me go unpack my sch nibs.
when you found her, why didn't you call the cops?
is he always this stupid?
I can't even imagine what he'd think of you right now...
no matter what you decide...
I can't even imagine what it must be like in the bedroom.
that's not Eve happened before?
and he talked to me like a guy talks to a girl that he maybe might like.
and he talked to someone else?
and he talked you and Stan into it?
great. All right, let me go unpack my sch nibs.
to be honest, I've been struggling to understand all this.
to be honest, I've been trying to escape it as well.
to be honest, I've heard enough.
right. What? I don't know.
no matter what you did or how bad you think you messed up...
I can't even imagine what it must be like in the bedroom.
I thought...... you were dead, briseis!
I can't even imagine what it must be like in the bedroom.
when you found him by the river?
I can't even imagine what it must feel like to save someone's life.
is he always this sweet?
to be honest, I've never been so scared,
right. Whatever that means.
no matter what you did, don't give up. Do not give up.
that's not Gaius.
but until we do your only option is to sacrifice Chappelle.
but until we do, these people are a part of that system...
but until we do, these people are still a part of that system...
but until we do, these people are still a part of the system and that makes them our enemy.
but until we do, you'll have two police outside your door 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
but until we do...
but until we figure out what we must do, we can start by prudently deciding what we must not do: allow ourselves to be driven to war by unreflective, overweening moralism.
but until we find a sustainable solution to stockpiling the fuel, it will remain an illusion: we will merely be shifting the problem elsewhere.
but until we find out what happened here...
no matter what you did, he's an idiot to let you go...
great. All right, let's get out of here.
no matter what you did, he's an idiot to let you go...
great. All right, let's go.
and he talked youand stan into it?
I can't even imagine what it must feel like to save someone's life.
I thought....
I can't even imagine what it'd be like if she was on a different continent.
that's not I need to sing and enjoy marriage.
no matter what you do -
great. All right, love.
right. Whatever, scrotch. You can't get your fist pregnant.
and he talking to police?
and he talks about relevance.
and he talks in detail about.
and he talks it out.
and he talks like that? Mom, they are from me.
and he talks real big, I want to take him down.
and he talks to it.
and he talks to you. I have heard him, yes.
and he talks, and not a little.
and he taped my mouth.
is he always this violent?
but until we find out who the winner is, we have one last job for you.
I thought: "he looks like me when I was a fraudster." I really felt bad for him.
I thought: "lfIf he's nineteen hundred how could he know new Orleans?"
I thought: "my time has come. If I'm gonna die, it's gonna be now.
I thought: "what if Colin does it"?
I thought: 'This cannot be happening, somebody must be playing a joke'.
I thought: I can crack a good joke, I know how to shoot a hoop, and I'm a cheerful person (but not in an annoying way).
I thought: I had been blessed with 53 more years of life than he.
I thought: if you can get enough blood through a small butterfly needle filling a small tube to do the necessary tests, why must we jab big needles into adults and fill comparatively huge tubes to do the same assessments?
I thought: it can't just flow like this.
I can't even imagine what it'd be like to be the last one of your species.
to be honest, I've never really enjoyed spending hours looking through someone else's family photo albums-and I get the feeling I'm not the only one!
to be honest, Jessica, I don't really care if we get caught.
to be honest, Lex...
to be honest, Mr. Jackson, some of my ministers...
to be honest, Mrs Patmore, I'm not sure I can manage much longer.
great. All right, mark, that's good. That's good ball - handling.
I thought: maybe she's ugly under her mask?
and he tapped
right. When I came.
I can't even imagine what it's going to be like here without him.
I can't even imagine what it's going to be like here without him.
I can't even imagine what it's like in Mexico.
to be honest, TV show, charity, whatever it is.
to be honest, TV show, charity, whatever it is.
great. All right, so, yeah.
no matter what you do on the stage
no matter what you do or feel for her, she's not gonna be here long.
no matter what you do or may happen
no matter what you do or say or plot...
no matter what you do or who you are,
no matter what you do to me, that's not gonna change.
no matter what you do to them, you understand?
I can't even imagine what it's like in Mexico.
I thought: my life should be twining without any deliberate arrangement. Faced with difficulties, I do not have too much time to think about the solutions. My life should be long and complex, but it is destined to be extraordinary!
I thought: she's even lonelier than me.
and he tasted it.
right. When I first heard my voice on speakers,
right. When I first heard my voice on speakers,
no matter what you do with quantum cryptography,
no matter what you do, I love you.
no matter what you do, I will always find you.
great. All right, well, make yourself comfortable.
to be honest, Tom, your guess is as good as mine at this point.
I can't even imagine what must be on all these.
is he always this way?
right. When I see them
but until we find out who,
but until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.
but until we find someone, you'll have provisional command.
great. All right, why don't you try some of that? Here.
to be honest, an average student reported the most difficult!
I thought: she's not coming back.
I thought: take this job.
I thought: that's how the game is played.
is he always this...
right. When I see them
no matter what you do, I'll find you.
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here.
but until we find the real source of the trouble,
that's not I'm saying
that's not Internet dating.
that's not Irish. I think he's black.
that's not Jacob wells.
that's not Jamal.
I can't even imagine what she has on you, but it must be something huge.
is he amenable?
I can't even imagine what she's dealing with right now.
but until we find who did,
I thought: you're dying, just as I will die.
I thoughtI said no having sex with her at this house?
I thoughtI'd find you all here.
to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of 10,000.
to be honest, at the moment,
is he amiable? - who?
no matter what you do, do not fall into the trap of being compared to your predecessor.
great. All right.
when you found him, he wasn't dead, he was unconscious.
when you found me at mine in metropolis...
when you found me in Chicago,
that's not Katherine anymore
that's not Kawasaki's.
that's not Keiko.
that's not Kevin, is it?
that's not Kurtzman.
that's not Lord Akira!
that's not Luke. Luke, are you all right up there?
that's not Mel anymore, Chad.
but until we get a cleanup crew out there, it's not safe to go outside.
and he tastes every dish -
right. When I want to make a first - year teacher's salary.
I thoughtIthought I would take you to dinner
when you found me in your garage,
is he amiable? Who?
when you found me that morning
to be honest, at the moment,
to be honest, because if you look at the overall figure,
but until we get new information,
and he taught him a lesson.
and he taught me and said to me, let your heart hold fast to my words; keep my commandments and live;
and he taught me how to box.
I thoughtMy dress looked new and fresh
that's not Milo Boyd.
is he among you?
no matter what you do, don't stop squeezing.
no matter what you do, feed these poor things first.
no matter what you do, girl
no matter what you do, give him a call.
no matter what you do, in 40 years we'll both be dead.
no matter what you do, it is important that you have moralistic principle.
great. All right. Get you a set of keys.
to be honest, because if you look at the overall figure,
I can't even imagine what that was like.
right. When I want to make a first - year teacher's salary.
right. When I was in college,
right. When I was in college,
and he taught me so many things...
right. When do you meet?
I thoughtMy family was dysfunctional.
great. All right. Go ahead. Shoot.
to be honest, blood is thicker than water when it comes to the relationship between han and tibetan, and when the real enemies come, the only strong backing you will have to fall upon is the people's republic of china.
that's not Mr. Perfect.
that's not Nick Fisher.
that's not Oz. Who the hell is that?
but until we get that chance,
no matter what you do, it's -
but until we get that chance, we really want you to have it.
no matter what you do, it's never enough.
no matter what you do, it's never just a job if you are a believer.
no matter what you do, just keep me in the loop.
great. All right. Good to see you.
to be honest, everything was a bit of a blur at the time.
is he an MD doctor?
that's not Parkinson's.
that's not Paul Torres,
that's not R ght wisely
and he taught me that I could chart my own course.
no matter what you do, most of the audience will basically tend to ignore you like an ad (with very few exceptions to brands like apple or lolcats).
I can't even imagine what that was like.
I can't even imagine what that would be like.
I can't even imagine what the two of you must be...
I can't even imagine what the two of you must be
that's not SSM in your voice. it's -
that's not Sean.
but until we go viral, it's best if we -
I can't even imagine what this place is gonna look like tonight -
great. All right. Have a good night, guys.
great. All right. I'll be in touch. Okay.
no matter what you do, never lose heart.
I can't even imagine what you are going through.
to be honest, he acted like an ass.
to be honest, he acted like an ass.
to be honest, he lobbied for the assignment. Really?
that's not Spanish. Let me see it.
but until we have more information, it will be...
and he taught me that sometimes
and he taught me to play when I was young.
and he taught those hard lessons to so many of us here.
and he taught us how to celebrate Hanukkah by drinking gin and tonicas.
and he teaches a very, very few people.
is he an acquaintance? Friend? Are you in love with him?
great. All right. Let's do it.
is he an addict?
great. All right. Maybe six years, out in four.
is he an alien too?
great. All right. Maybe six years. Out in four.
is he an angel or a demon?
that's not a "no"! Okay!
but until we have proof to the contrary,
to be honest, he lobbied for the assignment. Really?
I thoughted of my niang, thought of etc. she go home every day and night after night.
right. When he goes into his committal -
great. All right. Thank you. All right.
right. When is he clearest? - I don't...
is he an animal?
when you found me that morning
and he teaches at my school.
but until we have proof to the contrary, let's try to be optimistic.
I can't even imagine what you must be feeling.
to be honest, he's a boring little bugger at times.
I thoughthaving time on Springer would give me a chance
I thoughthe police should know about it.
great. All you got to do is come up with a good idea.
right. When is he clearest? I don't...
that's not a "nothing's wrong" face, addie. What's wrong?
is he an ass?
when you found me, you told me to have faith,
and he teaches music, just like my father.
but until we know more -
I can't even imagine what you'd be like.
to be honest, his movie for it tried to present china's image on the international scene, but I think it's too old fashioned and always about old things on the subject of traditional china.
to be honest, if it be possible
I thoughthe was hurting you.
great. All you got to do is come up with a good idea.
great. All you. Guys, round 'em up, please.
great. Amazing.
is he an egghead? Because he seems very roll - up - the - sleeves - y.
that's not a "nothing's wrong" face, addie. What's wrong?
that's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K - flex.
but until we know more,
and he teared up and left the room.
to be honest, it makes me uncomfortable to even answer this question for a couple of reasons.
I can't even imagine what you'd be like
I thoughticould, too.
right. When she has appointments without her mom,
right. When we get in there, let me do all the explaining. OK?
right. When you include
is he an electrician?
when you found me,
when you found out I'm...
and he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night
when you found out about me...
when you found out about me...
when you found out he was being satisfied by another woman, you wanted revenge.
when you found out he was being satisfied by another woman, you wanted revenge.
great. An alcoholic. He's not an alcoholic.
when you found out it was rock week,
that's not a bad breathing space.
is he an ex-boyfriend or something?
is he an ex-boyfriend?
to be honest, it really wasn't about you.
and he tells her on her birthday.
no matter what you do, no matter how you're tempted...
no matter what you do, no matter what life brings you,
no matter what you do, nothing is going to change it.
no matter what you do, snow white will have her happy ending.
great. And Friday maybe we could go the theater.
when you found out something about me you didn't like, you judged me and bailed.
when you found out something about me you didn't like,
when you found out that Elliot wasn't yours.
but until we know more, I would ask that you consider
when you found out that kid who you were paying to mow your lawn was doing your wife,
and he tells me I am his own.
and he tells me he loves me, and that he's thankful.
I thoughtifthought if I got a crew together, maybe I could, you know, move up the ladder,
I can't even imagine what you're going through.
