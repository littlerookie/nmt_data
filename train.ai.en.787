all right, let's go in here.
Oh, come... the interrogation room? Really, Booth?
come on, we got to do things by the book. You understand.
do you really think that I killed Leona?
no, of course not. But you did have a motive.
because I hated her? I told you that, Aubrey.
come on, Booth, this is dumb. I mean, you know me.
listen, the prosecutor gets copies of everything that we find, okay?
they're gonna need explanations, Hodgins. So, have a seat, sit down.
so, we sit down, we have a little conversation, and you explain yourself. Come on!
so, woman steals your invention, makes millions...
Yes, $4 million. It's a lot of money.
but I was worth billions at the time. But you're not anymore.
now you could use that money. Some might say that could make you lose control, lash out.
wow, and I thought I was gonna like you, Aubrey.
Hodgins, he's just asking questions. He's got to do his job, okay?
the prosecutor is gonna see the money thing as a motive.
there's also some hard evidence, might raise a few red flags.
okay, all right. This should be good, since I'm the one sifting through that evidence. Please.
it was a Band-Aid, piece of a Band-Aid that was found on the body with your DNA on it.
Yes, because I cut my finger this morning.
this one. - That's a good one.
right there, okay?
I was making Michael Vincent's lunch, I cut myself, put a Band-Aid on it.
by the time we got to the convention, it stopped bleeding, so I took it off, I threw it in the trash.
Yeah, but it wasn't in the trash, it was on the victim.
Yes, because the killer tossed a load of trash onto the victim to confuse us.
the crime scene was staged, Booth, okay? Whoever did this knew what they were doing.
someone like you... Okay, that's enough.
what? I like the guy, too.
but it's like you said-- we got a job to do. The DOJ's gonna think we're playing favorites here.
he answered your questions, right? Yeah.
Yeah, okay? So he can go.
you can go.
I can leave? Yes, you can.
Really? Yeah.
listen, I know what it's like to be innocent, and have a bunch of circumstantial evidence, you know, stacked against you. Thank you, Booth.
and I really do think you're a good guy. Yeah, great.
so please don't be the killer.
stop, all right. Really?
Yeah, sure.
the indentations on the right side are deeper than the indentations on the left side.
what does that mean?
it indicates the disambiguation of a right-handed assailant, because these blows show more strength.
the fatal blows to the left side are weaker and not as specifically placed as those on the right.
indicative of someone who is not used to using his left hand.
he was trying to confuse us. But he wasn't successful, was he?
sorry, um... I have an appointment.
the clinical trial?
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. I- I can cancel if you...
you're of no use to me if your cancer returns and you die, Mr. Bray.
I can manage until you come back. It usually takes about an hour.
I-I get the medicine, they take my blood...
I know. I'm happy it seems to be working.
Thanks, Dr. B.
I have got some good news for you. You're back-- that's excellent news.
Yeah, well, there's more. So, the stomach contents turns out there was wine sediment in the mix, made from a very rare, almost extinct French grape called carmenere.
can you trace it? I already did.
it was only used by four French vintners-- Pauillac, Margaux, Latour and Lafite.
all very expensive wines.
Yeah, exactly. And the mass spec also identified strawberries and chocolate.
sounds like our victim had a little romantic dinner on her last night.
with someone who really knows their wine. So, we have to trace Leona's last steps in order to...
no, actually we don't. So, I called the room service manager at the hotel.
the night before Leona was murdered, a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries was delivered to a guest along with a thousand-dollar bottle of Chateau Margaux.
let me guess, the hotel guest was Leona Saunders.
no, it was Dr. Edward Harkness, the director of the Forensic Science Convention.
we know that Leona Saunders was in your room at 3: 00 a. m. on the morning of the day she was murdered.
because the Jeffersonian found the sediment from the Margaux in her stomach, correct?
correct.
Yes, I was expecting this.
a great, a good and a right mind is a kind "of divinity lodged in flesh.
sadly it is always the flesh that gets the better of us.
Seneca.
Ah! You know your classics, young man.
Mm-hmm. Bravo.
ironically, my relationship with Leona started at the convention last year.
as you, well, may be aware, conventions usually devolve into carnivals of indiscretion.
and even I, the ringmaster, fell victim to its hedonistic pleasures.
so, you cheated on your wife, now you've turned it into a poem.
that's great. Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Leona was the love of my life. So, what's the story?
did she meet somebody else at the convention? What?
no, I was not the jealous one.
there was another woman before Leona.
she hired me as a forensic research consultant for a book she was writing.
we started seeing each other. But when I met Leona, I broke it off.
she never forgave me for leaving her.
and your other woman? Tess Brown.
Hey, Dr. B. So, I identified some particulate matter I found in the remains.
it was in the stab wounds. What is it?
obsidian. Oh, obsidian was used as early as the Acheulean Age for weapons.
Yeah, well, I think it's still being used for weapons.
how much did you find? About 600 grams.
sufficient mass for an obsidian knife.
and a magnesium fire would melt an obsidian knife, leaving only traces of a murder weapon.
Tess Brown used an obsidian weapon in her first novel.
I'll check the bones for other fragments. Okay.
Hey, I thought Wendell was helping you out. Oh, he had an appointment for his clinical trial.
he should be back...
actually, he was supposed to be back by now.
I thought he said that he was just going to get a quick injection.
should we be worried?
of course not. No, I'm...
there's probably traffic.
Yeah. Yeah.
I talked to your publisher-- he dropped you.
because of a video where I said a few inappropriate things.
right, like calling your fans "idiots.
I have a neighbor who reads your books, she's definitely an idiot.
right. So your publisher gave you another shot because you had another big idea for a book.
Yes. Which you titled Hotter than My Heart.
kind of a crime in itself.
murder at a forensic convention with, uh, cops and experts.
that's ironic.
there's no crime in being at the right place at the right time.
no, it is if you were lying about where you were.
we have video evidence that proves you were never in the ballroom like you said you were.
do you think I'd commit a murder to get a book deal?
Yeah, I do. I actually think you would.
but, you know what, that's not why you killed Leona.
why don't you tell us about your relationship with Dr. Harkness?
I hired him as a forensic consultant on one of my books.
he read my manuscript, gave me some notes.
it was purely professional.
purely professional." Do you hear that?
I'm sure he gave you lots of information on how to commit a murder, that must have been really helpful.
we also have evidence you and Dr. Harkness spent time together at several hotels in Miami, Las Vegas, Hawaii.
Hawaii. Aloha e.
what did Edward say? That stumpy little toad.
well, he said that you became very, very jealous after you found out about, uh, Leona.
right now, he's looking pretty credible.
you know... I hired another consultant.
an attorney. And I'd like to call her right now, if you don't mind.
any word from Wendell? Not yet.
do you think we can call the doctors who are administering the trial?
maybe something happened to him. I did.
they wouldn't tell me anything. Confidentiality.
I can barely work. But we have to, don't we?
there's a slight discoloration on the ilium I didn't see before.
the victim showed symptoms of arthritis.
it could have been from minocycline use. This is localized to the ilium.
we've been working under the assumption that the killer used gasoline to ignite the magnesium strips.
but what if that were a mask for a third accelerant?
do you think Tess Brown would be able to engineer something that complicated?
Dr. Harkness is quite brilliant in his field.
if he were her mentor, it's a very real possibility.
so, we're looking for a third accelerant, something that the gasoline could obfuscate.
I can't tell you how flattered I am that you asked me to be here.
the Jeffersonian is the pinnacle... Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?
can we get back on track? Uh, yes, of course.
looks like sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate.
Yeah, now that is the perfect recipe for igniting magnesium strips, don't you think?
Yes, perhaps, but sulfuric... Excuse me, Dr. Hodgins?
I'm Aldus Carter, I'm not sure if you remember.
uh... What are you doing here?
I think the real question is-- what are you doing here?
I was asked to help because of my world-renowned expertise in arson.
Expertise"?! His lab was shut down for starting a fire in his apartment building.
didn't tell you that, did he?
okay, stop. Both of you, stop it.
now, how did you get in here? Magnetic coding is just one of my many specialties.
if you'd let me help you, perhaps I could undo whatever damage this idiot has no doubt done...
why you arrogant little...
Hey, hey, hey, break it up! Hey, break it up.
what the hell is going on here?
I asked him to come. And he just showed up.
this is a restricted area. You're both going to have to leave.
now.
can you please escort these men out of the building?
okay, okay.
compliments of Carter Forensic Devices.
are you out of your mind? You didn't even check with me...
Yeah, I... S-Sorry, sorry.
it was my bad, Cam. But that just gave me a great idea.
wait, look at this. So, sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate, they react violently when put together, right? Just like those two.
but what if the potassium chlorate and the sulfuric acid were separated by layers and layers of aluminum foil, which I also found on the murder remains?
the sulfuric acid would eat through the foil.
Yeah, that's right. But slowly.
here, put these on. Because the foil would create an ignition delay...
Yeah, a chemical timing device. Got it.
that's pretty cool, right?
so the killer wouldn't need to be in the plumbing and electric room when the fire started.
then all the timelines that Angela worked out, that cleared some of the suspects, are meaningless.
which means none of the suspects has an alibi.
including you. Including... me.
I tried to call Wendell, but there was no answer.
I'm really starting to worry.
don't. Booth heard from him.
he's fine.
then why isn't he here? I'm sure Booth will be able to answer that.
I'm trying to determine why there's a puncture on the anterior surface of the left fifth vertebral rib.
Perimortem? Yes.
it lines up with the obsidian knife wound on the fourth sternal rib on the left side.
but this one has no traces of obsidian in it.
so the obsidian knife must've been used to cover up the initial stab wound.
Yes. Note that no other wounds were deep enough to leave traces on the vertebral ribs.
the killer probably thought we were going to stop at the obsidian knife, and not search for another weapon. A very misguided assumption.
I will make a mikrosil impression of the injury and give it to Dr. Hodgins.
perhaps he can identify the weapon.
people don't know how to drive in this city. What's going on?
you good? Yeah, I'm good.
all right. Uh, sorry, I shouldn't have called you, man.
you're-you're... you're busy.
come on! What are you talking about, huh?
you can't call your... your hockey teammate, who can you call, right?
not sure I'm going to be playing much more hockey anymore.
Oh. Why is that?
did, uh... it come back again?
not mine, no. But, uh...
one of the guys, uh, in the clinical trial
uh, Ben-- has two little kids, four and a one-and- a-half year old.
died on Tuesday.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, I- I...
I saw him four weeks ago, and he was doing well, you know, just like me.
then, out of nowhere, the cancer started spreading and...
he was a good guy. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Me, too.
I really thought I was going to get better.
wait a second-- just because one person in your group doesn't get better, doesn't mean you're not gonna get better.
I mean, come on. How do you feel?
I feel good. But so did he, a month ago.
you know, Wendell...
you know, back in '02, we had to secure this ridge in Ghazni...
before our major forces came in.
little did we know the Taliban had already been there.
and they pinned us down for about six days, and they kept picking us off one by one.
15 guys went up to that ridge, and only three came out.
I know what you're trying to do, Booth.
I-I appreciate it; the doctors tried to do the same thing. No, you don't.
I don't think you know what I'm talking about, and I don't think you appreciate what I'm telling you right now.
what I'm telling you is that I saw 12 of my brothers killed in front of me.
twelve.
you got dealt a bad hand. Deal with it.
sorry.
enough with the apologies. Okay, Wendell?
stop feeling sorry for yourself, man, and keep fighting.
I don't need to see another brother die.
so, I have a match for the puncture wound you found in the rib.
Aldus Carter's thermocouple?! He did it?!
you're absolutely certain it's this one.
his thermocouple has this unique tip that matches the mikrosil perfectly.
didn't he say this records data each time it takes body temperature?
Yeah, he did. Hey, so if Aldus used this as a weapon, then that data should be stored here, too. Well, that should be easy to download.
there'll be one reading that's from me, the rest will be his.
okay...
huh. There's only one entry.
that was mine, when I used it.
so he must've erased it. Wait, hold on, there might be another way.
I found traces of nano-composites with the nitrile rubber on the remains.
the examination gloves? Could be.
I mean, it's a superhydrophobic coating, for sure.
I'll need to do some tests to be certain, but...
okay, well, check it out and call me back.
great. Thanks.
okay, so what do we have?
Aldus Carter placed an order for a piece of obsidian from an online flintknapping store a month ago.
Flintknapping?! Making ancient tools and weapons out of flint and obsidian.
lots of people do it. Just weird people, probably.
right, okay-- was the piece he ordered big enough to make a knife?
Oh, yeah. If we get a search warrant, I bet we'll find the knapping tools at his place.
the hard hammers, soft hammers-- everything that he would've needed to make his weapon.
okay, well, bring him in. All right, great.
why are you following me?
I can't believe this.
after all that I've done to help you with your investigation, you're accusing me of killing this woman?
I... I don't even know her. What possible motive could I have?
well, getting rid of Leona Saunders gave you an opportunity to showcase your products.
which led to a substantial order from the Jeffersonian and other contractors.
I would never kill for money. We have the murder weapon.
and it's not the obsidian knife you burned on the remains in an attempt to mislead us.
my thermocouple.
but Dr. Saroyan is the one who planted those prongs into the corpse, not me.
Yeah, but you thought that you could erase, you know, the memory of this "thermal-cuppus.
thermocouple. It's a thermocouple.
and you thought you could cover your tracks.
but... you forgot about these. Those.
we found traces of nitrile rubber with manganese oxide polystyrene nano-composite fused to the burned flesh of the victim. I can tie them to you.
Oh... that's impossible.
the rubber is an exact match for your patented and, well, quite excellent non-stick gloves, Mr. Carter.
couldn't do better with a fingerprint. And do not compliment the murderer.
sorry.
handling a corpse with nitrile rubber does not leave trace evidence, all right?
that's why my gloves are so good.
true, unless you were also handling razor-sharp strips of magnesium which cut the glove and, in this case, left traces of your DNA on the rubber.
that's brilliant.
this has been a worthy defeat.
that's it? Well, there's nothing more to discuss, actually.
bones, there is a lot to discuss here. What about Leona?
why her?
because of a video spectral comparator I was developing.
I found out she was stealing my designs and that's the only reason she was sleeping with me.
you... and she was... wow.
well, that... Okay.
Oh. Well...
Yeah. Um, sorry, one more thing.
um, I will still be able to work on the comparator in prison.
I think it could be very valuable to your team.
I look forward to seeing it. Really, Bones?
really. No.
what? No!
he still does good work.
I can't believe Dr. B. was worried she'd look foolish in front of everyone.
she's the best, man. Sometimes people doubt how strong they really are.
Hey, brother.
you're back. Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm still in remission. Sorry I missed work.
I was dealing with some stuff. It won't happen again.
Hello, everyone.
thank you, thank you very much, thank you. Okay.
yesterday, I tried to introduce our keynote speaker, when all hell broke loose here at the National Forensic Sciences Convention.
but within 24 hours, this incredible woman and her team not only conducted a complete forensic investigation, they also solved the murder.
therefore, and particularly in light of this remarkable feat, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the remarkable Dr. Temperance Brennan!
thank you, thank you very much.
the great Dr. Erwin Schrodinger gets pulled over for speeding.
Oh, no.
the police officer says, "What's in the trunk?
Schrodinger says, "A cat.
the police officer says, "Let me see,
and he opens the trunk and says: "This cat is dead.
and Schrodinger says, "Well, it is now.
Hey, that worked!
which reminds me of an astronaut I know who told me about a restaurant he visited on the moon.
great food," he said, "but no atmosphere.
Yes! That was...
I thought it was funny.
why can't I feel my legs?
your legs had to be replaced.
Aah!
Jaime, tell everyone Sarah Corvus says hello.
you live with me. That's the way it is.
you're never gonna live with dad.
I just feel like I hold you back sometimes.
you're the only thing in my life that makes any sense right now.
Sarah Corvus is still alive.
and you came all the way here to tell me that?
good - bye, Jae. Please give my regards to will.
tell him daddy says hello.
we are gathered here today to honor William Anthros.
this is hard. - Listen, I'm gonna go back to my life, and my job, and pretend none of this ever happened.
why did Will have a file on me this thick?
I found it in his apartment, and it started two years before I met him.
what are you people?
we're a private clandestine group dedicated to stopping rogue organizations from ending civilization as we know it.
who are you? - I'm Sarah Corvus.
the first bionic woman. Ta - da.
push it, Jaime.
I CAN'T DO IT.
I guess I'm not used to thinking of myself as artificially intelligent.
that's not what I said.
I said part of your programming includes artificial intelligence , the ability to learn.
more importantly, to unlearn.
here we go.
you see how you always defend the same way every time?
one more time.
you can't be too predictable, Jamie.
you can circumvent the programming, go way beyond what it intended.
you're telling me I can hack into myself, change the information?
all it takes is practice.
how's your salad?
it's great. It's a salad.
you want to split a sundae?
go to the movies later?
what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy back your love because I've been working so much.
it's gonna cost you a lot more than lunch.
okay, you know what I want.
I'm NOT.
how?
JIAME THEY MAKE ME.
you CAN.
what about your new job?
I mean, shouldn't consultant pay more than bartender?
okay, if you can't buy those jeans, I think you need to renegotiate.
that's not the point. The point is, you're 15 years old.
I'm not buying you $170 jeans.
Hey.
I need you to do something for me.
can't. I'm out with my sister.
who is it? - It's work.
ask for more money.
I know where you are. That's why I have something for you to do.
you know where I am?
$50 million, you didn't think we'd throw in a GPS?
wait a minute, you have a tracker on me?
no one said anything about a tracker.
what tracker? - Nothing, it's nothing.
a block up the street, a guy with blond hair, green jacket, and glasses.
he's eating a falafel.
who is he?
suffice it to say, he's a very bad man.
he's a bad man? - Who's a bad man?
somebody's sleeping with somebody else at work.
this is not a good time.
it never is. You want to have lunch with your sister or save the free world?
didn't you just give me a big speech about how I'm not ready for any of this?
you're not, but you're the closest operative I have.
all you have to do is make sure he doesn't leave.
sit on him if you have to. We'll be there in five minutes flat.
what happens if he gets away?
ask for more money.
mass casualties.
listen, in the future, we really can't stop to chit - chat like this.
here's how it works. I say do something, and you do it.
no, don't tell me you have to go back to work.
no, I don't.
you know what? I think you should get those jeans.
early christmas present.
I'm not gonna have to, like, clean the bathroom for the next year, am I?
just go. I'll wait for you here. Go.
Bye. - Bye.
Hi, I'm new in town, and I'm a little lost.
can you tell me where the museum of modern art is?
sorry.
Oh, because there's supposbe this incredible Basquiat exhibit.
okay, listen. I've been asked to make sure you don't go anywhere, okay?
so is there any way we can wait here for five minutes until backup gets here?
feel free to turn the radio on.
okay.
plan B.
you were supposed to get one pair of jeans.
I know, but they had all these shirts on sale.
I got you one.
and you were supposed to be here when I got back.
Where'd you go?
bathroom.
what the hell. Let's go catch that movie.
Yeah.
I love you, I honestly do.
you're what gives my life meaning.
you're the only thing worth living for. Without you, I think I'd die.
amazing.
no flutters, nothing.
we've got to find a way to teach this.
how do you do it, anyway?
I've been married.
what time does Sommers come online?
not my department.
I was never into voyeurism, remember?
can you explain the obsession people have typing little messages to each other with their thumbs, as if it's somehow more convenient than just talking?
you've got some bad ideas in your head these days, don't you, Sarah?
feelings you don't understand.
impulses to do things that fighten you.
it's the bionics, isn't it?
they've changed me, turned me into this thing.
I can't help you until I have more information.
what information?
meanwhile, I want you to take this.
it's for your nerves.
it'll calm you.
is the same thing going to start ho her?
I don't know.
the only way to be sure is to evaluate Jaime Sommers in person.
if you found differences, could you help me?
unlikely.
but not impossible.
you gotta trust me, Sarah.
I can make you feel better.
at least for the time being.
just bring Jaime Sommers to me.
Jonas, we need to talk about this tracker thing.
how do you feel about canadians?
don't change the subject.
so you thought it was okay to put a tracker inside my head?
well, since we're on the subject, we're also streaming video from your head.
streaming what- - what?
so there's a video camera in my eye?
it's in your brain.
I don't know where to start. I want it out.
I want it all out of my head.
well, you see, the whole thing's grafted onto your cerebral cortex.
we could take it out, but then you wouldn't be able to move the left side of your body.
this is an invasion of my privacy.
it's stripping me of my dignity, and it's a little pervy.
pervy? - It's perverted.
it's for your own safety. - That is crap.
it's so you can watch me and watch your investment.
that's also true.
this conversation is not over.
okay.
so why are you asking me about canadians?
this is eHaven Von Fleet.
she's the daughter of a major canadian defense contractor.
she's gonna be visiting the U. S. for three days.
Canada? Do they even have an army?
of course they do. They're a country.
okay, so what's it got to do with me?
heaven's father sells arms to the Bosnians, which pissed off the Serbs.
there's been a threat made on his life, and he's insisting his daughter get 24 - hour protection while he's here.
so what are the chances of the Serb militants coming over here and taking out this little, rich Canadian girl?
zero, but we do business with the guy, and he's pulling a favor.
and this involves me how?
just make sure nothing happens to her.
nothing is gonna happen to her. - Exactly.
so what? I'm a bionic babysitter?
that's right. Come on, Jaime, sometimes you get a softball.
instead of complaining about it, just enjoy it.
I'm glad you could come by and meet Heaven.
tomorrow, I'll need you here at 9: 00 to pick her up.
sure.
Oh, and one more thing.
I should probably mention that my daughter is a little spirited.
that's great.
what I mean to say is, while she's under your watch, she is not to get a new tattoo, a new body piercing, consume any alcohol, or take any drugs.
uh, you know, my understanding was my job was just to keep her safe.
Yes, well, I've provided millions of dollars in revenue to Berkut.
I don't think that's a relationship you want to screw around with.
young lady, there is to be no smoking in this house.
shut up, dad. Get out. Get out!
get out of my space!
I merely want to introduce
the goon? I see her.
this whole thing is stupid, dad. It's just a way of you trying to control me.
I hate you.
Hi, I'm Jaime Sommers.
I don't need to know your name.
don't talk to me. Walk five steps behind me at all times.
great. I'll see you tomorrow then.
I don't know who you think I am wow, I cannot believe you've never had a lesson.
I don't know who you think I am what's up?
it's nothing.
it's nothing.
everyone's already there. You always do this.
we always miss the fun stuff because you're too slow.
don't tempt me.
sissy.
give me a sip.
Oh, one sip, for god's sake, come on.
Hey, one.
come on, Anne, don't bogart.
there's only one gulp left.
there's at least two.
you're not really gonna drink the rest of it, are you?
you don't know me very well, do you, Sarah?
I can't believe you let mom get rid of Kurt.
first of all, what kind of name was that for a pet?
Oh, he was adorable.
second, he was by far the stupidest animal i've ever seen.
all he did was lick himself all day.
Yeah, well, you know what they say.
Becca, don't.
if people coulddo it- - Becca.
they'd never leave the house. - You're
my god, Becca.
like, how long did it take you to do all this?
Oh, I'm not finished yet.
mom kept all the really cool stuff from that year we spent in D. C. before she died.
you really are the family packrat, aren't you?
think about it, Jaime. It's our family we're talking about here.
I mean, if there weren't pictures, no one would ever know we existed.
Oh, here, let me show you something.
check this out.
wow, that's mom's grandma, right?
Yep. It was just before she found out she was dying.
Oh, well, she made it to 92 eventually.
and later they discovered it was some kind of genetic disorder.
she was 25. Just a year older than you are now.
tick - tock.
not funny.
how do you know all this stuff?
I mean, why is it important to you, digging around, learning all this stuff about our family?
I guess I just want to know the truth about everything.
I don't like secrets, Jaime.
we are the only two people with sub-retinal charged coupling devices implanted in our optic nerves.
but our human brain still filters out things it doesn't want us to see.
don't let it!
see everything, Jaime.
we know what each other's thinking... if we want.
wake up, jaime.
don't even try it, honey. I know how you think.
having only one bionic arm shouldn't be such a predictable weakness, Jaime.
the metal tip on that comb.
the phone cord. Ooh, there's an idea.
the scissors in the desk.
I know your instincts, Jaime.
we have the same baseline programming.
I know you better than you know yourself, but not well enough.
what is it this time, Sarah?
I see they have you lojacked.
so that gives me, what? A coupledred seconds before they show up?
I can talk fast, but not that fast.
sir, there's been a breach. Bathroom apartment window.
this is why I said we needed 24 - hour surveillance.
well, sir, you also said to hold off on that. Something about her right to privacy.
situation one, now.
I need you to help me.
I need you to come with me so that
you tried to kill me.
you killed the only man i've ever loved.
did you know I was pregnant?
did you know you murdered my unborn child?
glad to see there are still some things that can shut you up after all.
and now you break into my house, threaten my family?
tell me again how much you need me, you psychopathic freak.
I need you to believe me. This wasn't ever about you.
Oh, just collateral damage, huh?
do me a favor, Sarah. Try not to make it worse by apologizing, okay?
I am not here to hurt you or your sister, and I promise I won't, but in exchange, I need you to trust me this once.
meet me tomorrow, noon, sulfur plant. It's by the ocean.
it's the only place we can talk where they can't corner me.
I need you to come alone.
no back - up.
whether you know it or not, you need me too, Jaime.
let's see if the trust works both ways.
I want her under lockdown now.
I want this entire organization on full alert.
I want Corvus found and brought in, dead if necessary.
Roger that.
I want her streaming optical interface tracked permanently.
I don't want her to make a move unless we know when, where, and why.
Jonas! - What?!
I'm not doing any of that.
I'm not hiding, and I'm not running away.
and you talking about me like I'm not even in the room, like my opinion doesn't matter, not exactly the attitude adjustment we talked about.
it's true, sir. We did talk about you change
all right. All right.
I'm sorry.
then here's what I think we should do.
I'll draw Sarah Corvus out.
but you've got to promise to let me talk to her before you bring her in.
let me get close to her, find out what it is she wants.
no, no.
we have experts in that category.
great. I'm sure your experts have a lot to talk about.
fine, fine. It's a deal.
you keep your appointment with Sarah.
we'll be close, but we'll stay back until you give us the signal to move in, okay, dirty Harry?
look, I think she's in pain.
you need to promise me if you bring her in, we're gonna help her.
don't make a liar out of me.
consider it a promise.
she lost a sister. You know that, right?
car accident. Sarah was driving.
she pretty much went scorched earth after that.
if Sarah Corvus wants something, she'll tear through a wall to get it.
just make sure that wall isn't you.
size 0. I told you size 0.
now!
I think it's outrageous that in spite of the Sarah Corvus situation.
I'm still expected to babysit this little monster.
Hey, you're bionic, babe.
Nathan, what I'm looking for here is a little sympathy, okay?
I just want you to agree with me.
I'm trying to be your friend, dummy.
okay, um, you're right. They're wrong.
um, would it be, uh, inappropriate of me to ask you out for drinks?
Yes, completely inappropriate. God!
Oh, so you want me to be, like, one of your girlfriends.
I have an idea.
why don't you put me in a dress and a wig and call me Stephanie , and we'll have
Oh, this is great. Just great.
I gotta go.
hello.
why aren't you on your way in? You're supposed to meet Sarah in two hours.
I'm on my way.
so how's it going with the girl?
great. I'm all over it.
Really?
cause it looks to me like you lost her.
okay, you know what? This camera in my eye, it sucks.
it's not a camera, it's a total violation of privacy. You know what?
I'm gonna call somebody. The Justice Department or Hillary Clinton.
she'll get to the bottom of this.
Jaime, just go find Heaven so we don't have to go to war with Canada.
I want it on my back.
I'm thinking between my shoulder blades.
somewhere my father will see it.
what?
come on. Is this punishment? Is that what you're doing?
Yeah, it's punishment.
Ooh, I'm really scared.
Oh, you should be.
what is she doing here? This is a top secret facility.
am I supposed to be impressed?
I'm going out for a few hours. This is Ruth.
she's gonna run a few tests on you.
is she a lesbian?
have fun.
Hey. - Hey.
I'm going to see Sarah Corvus soon.
I'm feeling a little in the dark.
what does she want with me?
we think Sarah Corvus might be working with Anthony Anthros.
will's father?
he escaped from prison. Treason.
he tried to sell bionics to the highest bidder.
apparently, you and Will didn't talk very much.
so what does he want with sSarah?
he created her. He designed her.
he and Will.
so what do they want?
if I had to guess, I would say you.
okay. So I'm here.
talk.
I'm sick.
and I think you're the only person who can help get me well.
what do you mean, sick?
I don't know what they told you, but I've done some bad things.
a few years ago, I
I know, Sarah.
Jae shot me, and as far as the world was concerned, I was dead.
he raised you from the dead? How did he
I don't know, but whatever he did changed something in me.
but it's like my emotions were gone with it.
I felt like a pure machine, like I could do anything, and I loved it.
so why do you need me, Sarah?
I'm losing control again.
just take your medicine, Sarah.
you know it'll make you feel better.
whatever will did to save me was temporary, but your implants, the way the anthrocytes interface with your body, it's more advanced.
if we can isolate those properties, we can make those adjustments in me.
you can save my life, Jaime.
let me ask you something.
how well did you really know Will?
how sure are you that the only reason you became a bionic candidate was because of the accident?
will didn't have any way of knowing you were gonna slam that truck into me, okay?
so your conspiracy theories don't have any weight.
how do you know I didn't just expedite things?
how do you know you weren't being primed anyway?
used by a man looking for the next candidate to serve up.
we're finished talking.
I don't need you, Sarah.
you need me.
I expected more from you, Jaime.
shame on you.
run!
move! Move!
see anything?
I have no visual on her, sir.
we lost her.
didn't we have a deal?
is this the way things work around here?
you were listening to everything big - brother style, right?
so what was Sarah about to tell me that you didn't want me to hear?
am I a ticking time bomb too?
I'm going after her, and if we can, we're gonna help her.
she killed 14 of my men, Jaime. You know that. Good men.
and that was a tragic thing. But that wasn't her, and you know it.
Oh, so you're a supporter of the insanity defense?
no, I just think there's a difference between going crazy and having your identity stolen from you.
which reminds me, your little video tap, I want it turned off.
nice move.
interesting things start happening once you learn to let go.
you think Sarah Corvus is gonna bring gloves to a fight?
no.
something tells me that she's gonna leave her little pads at home, and what we need to find now...is the animal.
now we all know that if your training is worth a damn, by now, I should be able to take this crowbar and swing it as hard and as fast as humanly possible and never get within an inch of you.
that's right, boys and girls.
I'm about to get analog on your ass.
so what do you say, Sommers?
are we ready to find the animal?
bring it on, bitch.
are you insane?
you're not finished!
Jaime! Enough.
there's the animal.
now she thinks I betrayed her.
you did betray her.
so what now? You know her. What's she gonna do next?
I don't know. What I do know, she holds grudges.
that's great. That's awesome. That's super helpful, Jae.
listen, you're on the grid now. You have 24 - hour security.
you're not in this alone, okay?
I guess that helps.
I gotta go. I'm on an assignment.
heaven needs a pedicure.
now, let's move on to your mother.
does she infantilize you also?
I'd really like to stop now.
that door is locked.
sit.
how was it?
I'm really sorry about ditching you at the store.
I'd really like to leave now.
okay.
thank you, Ruth.
that's the second time. You suck!
I'm sorry.
what was that?
what are you doing here, Sarah?
getting a pedicure.
red, please.
can I have a water?
of course.
you're looking better.
it comes in waves, honey. Today is a good day.
who's that?
they got you on baby detail?
look, Sarah, I'm sorry I brought Berkut with me before, okay?
you killed 14 people. You were lurking outside my window.
can't you see this from my side?
Yes, I can. I see everything from your side.
that's the point. We need each other.
I don't think I need you, Sarah.
are you sure about that?
because there's four Serbian gangsters coming up to the salon right now, and I don't think they're here to get their nails done.
better watch out for the little princess over there.
everybody out. - Heaven!
everybody out. - Get up!
now!
I don't suppose we could talk about this.
I don't think so.
how about a little help over here?
I thought you said you didn't need me.
okay, okay, I need you. I need you!
what's the magic word?
please.
bionics are great and all, but nothin' beats a little firepower.
rock, paper, scissors for the last guy?
I'm not sorry Will's dead.
but I didn't know you were pregnant, and I am sorry about that.
but I need your help, Jaime.
I'm dying.
your bionics are the only thing that can save me.
what just happened?
a bunch of Serbian dudes walked into a nail salon and tried to take you out.
nice. Look, you're gonna be okay.
berkut is gonna follow us. It won't make any difference if we move.
I have this tracker in my eye.
what are you talking about? You're starting to scare me.
get in the car and shut up.
you haven't figured out how to disable their GPS yet?
you can do that? - You have to.
those Berkut guys look at you in the shower, you know.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, don't even get me started on how objectifying this whole bionic woman thing is.
they don't tell you anything.
that's why you and me. We need to stick together, maybe form a union.
Sarah, I have a lot of reasons not to trust you, and that's not gonna change just because you say it should.
here's how you do it. It's like hacking into your own computer.
you need to concentrate really hard, and visualize it.
we should get out of here now.
adults are talking.
focus. And visualize.
that sounds awfully new - agey.
look, Jaime, you can do this.
they don't want you to know how powerful you are. Just trust me.
hack into your ocular tracking device in your cerebral cortex.
visualize the tracker.
disable it with your thoughts.
I just did it.
and you just got back a little dignity. How's it feel?
why is your nose bleeding?
why don't you hang yourself or something?
look, let me cut to the chase.
I want something from you.
I want you to come with me to see Anthros so they can study your technology and update me.
when they put the bionics in me, the system, it wasn't perfected.
what is she talking about?
shut up!
I will die within the year if you do not come with me and help me.
save my life, Jaime.
you're a good girl. You like to help people.
help me. Help me save my life.
I can't. I can't go to Anthros. I will not get cut up by Will's father.
besides, if I go with you, Jonas will wipe out the compound with you and I in it long before your health improves.
come to Berkut. We'll do it there.
and who's gonna do the surgery? Jonas?
Antonio? The janitor?
will's dead. There's not a surgeon there. You have to come with me.
I can't. I'm sorry. I wish I could, but I can't risk it.
it's not just about me, Sarah. I have a sister. I'm her guardian.
you know, our dad's a flake. Our mom's dead. We have no one.
yada, yada, yada, whatever.
so you're saying no?
I have no choice.
okay, then. Good luck.
where are you going, Sarah?
I'm gonna go lay down on the sidewalk and die.
you don't have to be so dramatic.
don't I?
cause I thought I was just told by the one person who could save my life that she's got better things to do.
that feels pretty dramatic to me.
not that I can actually feel anything, but I can intellectually imagine that that feels pretty dramatic.
she's scary.
Yeah, I know.
daddy, I love you.
thank you. I'm so gonna take up karate.
take care.
hello.
Hey, Becca, it's me.
Hey, okay, these jeans are, like, life - altering.
I'm on my way home. How about I pick up some chinese?
Yeah, sounds good.
Bye.
you're losing control, Sarah.
your denial will work with the others.
it won't work with me. I see you.
you don't see me.
no? What am I missing?
that you had a history of sick behavior even before you became a bionic candidate?
before you killed your sister?
stop saying that!
okay.
maybe it's true.
maybe Jaime Sommers really can help you get better.
but you're never gonna be able to trust her until she can truly relate to you.
she's never going to trust me.
I can't reach her.
she'll trust you when she can connect with who you are.
when she gets to feel what you felt.
you don't know me very well, do you, Sarah?
grab your chopsticks, woman. Kung pao is in the house.
Jaime, this is our new neighbor Sarah. She's moving in downstairs.
it's so nice to meet you, Jaime. I love your sister.
what a sweetheart.
welcome to the building, Sarah.
I love the building, and the apartments are great.
and these windows are awesome.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, you don't see moldings like this everywhere.
great moldings, great moldings. Do you love the moldings?
I do.
and the best thing is, is the neighborhood seems really safe.
Yeah. I like to think that it is.
it's okay.
just a little something I put in the tea.
don't worry.
she's not dead... yet...
as long as you come with me to Anthros.
otherwise, I may have to take her out of the picture so you don't feel so torn.
please don't do this.
I know what it feels like to lose a sister.
I killed mine.
Oops. It sucks.
but I feel like there's a silver lining.
you'll lose a sister, but you'll gain more of me.
you and I will be even more connected. It'll be fun.
we could even wear matching outfits.
how do you look in capris?
you don't want to do this.
you don't want to kill her.
I know you think you're this pure, aggressive animal, but that is not all of you.
I know you loved Jae and he loved you.
I know you loved your sister.
there is some humanity left in you.
I can see it.
please.
I'm sorry.
you bitch.
they're gonna be here any minute. Get the hell out of here.
you chose berkut over me.
you're going to have to live with that.
they will destroy you!
if you ever come near my sister again, I will kill you.
you know Will?
the guy you were in love with?
did you know that he studied you like a lab rat?
that he cased you, worked you, set you up?
there was never any reality to any moment you ever thought you shared with him.
every look, every kiss, every word, every night.
it was nothing.
so remember that the next time you feel like you're trusting someone.
you meant nothing to him.
it's gonna be okay.
I promise, it's gonna be okay.
what are you doing? Who are you?
where the hell are my parents? Get dressed!
why are you doing this?
I wasn't gonna do it!
we're trying to help you, Danny.
here's a list of allergies and things he can't eat.
crystal Kid. Excellent.
excuse me.
can l help you?
Uhhuh. I was in here last week.
l bought this. You said it was new.
when l opened it, it was scratched.
well, if it was sealed when you bought it,you probably shrinkwrapped it yourseIf, you needledick!
this place is a fraud, okay?
you don't wanna buy anything here!
I'm a little upset... Take the register.
that's enough.
this way. Let's go.
Needledick?
shut up. Like you didn't like it. Maybe for ywo seconds, but l work here. l need this job. Mmhmm.
so are you coming to Liddy's party tonight?
I don't think so.
well, I'll be there. It'll be fun.
all right. I'll meet you there at, what, 9: 00? Okay.
Bye. Bye.
another satisfied customer.
Mmm. I'm gonna pay for this all week.
ladies... Tadah!
okay, who's drinking what?
I'lI have a scotch, please.
for you, Bob? Taking the high road...
listen, the threestrikes law works.
drugs are a plague on society.
if you can keep the criminaIs off the streets, it's good for everyone.
Amen to that.
you know there were 2 million incarcerations last year?
we've got to be doing something right.
uh, excuse me, Karl?
how many strikes am l up to now?
is there something you want, Sophie?
you know, what concerns me more than drugs is the plague of corrupt politicians.
were you looking for this, Karl? No?
sorry, everyone.
mom? Anyone?
Sophie hasn't been herseIf lately.
come with me, honey. You know, I don't understand why you have to search my goddamn room every single time Sophie, that is enough!
what? No?
what is wrong with you?
what, Karl? Huh?
three strikes and I'm out?
you ran out of strikes a long time ago, lady.
Hey, where's Sophie?
uh, late.
I want to love you ln my room
I want to take off
all your clothes I want to see you in the daytime
I want to see you in my room
I want to have you
when the sun shines ln between the blinds
so f'lne do it here in the daytime What, what, what?
okay...
I'm sorry.
it's okay... It's okay... I can...
it's torture, but, uh...
I can wait. Oh, thanks.
Hey, what's this? It's nothing.
what is it? Nothing. l swear.
it's nothing. l just, uh...
Karl and my mom just raided my room again.
it got a little heated, that's all.
you like to mess with him, don't you?
no. No, I don't.
will you do something for me?
Yeah, sure. Anything.
what?
marry me.
Hehheh. Yeah, okay...
this must be good weed.
no, no, no, no. Look at me.
seriously.
l looked into this. I don't have to be 18 to legally be married in Nevada.
I can finally get away from Karl and my mom and you and l can just be together.
please.
my dad left us a trust fund, okay?
we can use it while you go to college Whoa, slow down.
you don't wanna marry me? No, it's not that.
it's not that I don't want to marry you or...
okay, if we ever do get married, it can't be for legal reasons.
it's got to be just about us.
you know, like, you, me...
love.
okay.
Sophie Bauer?
who the hell are you?
Hey!
we have parental consent to take you.
get off me!
consent, my ass! Get the fuck off of me!
we can do this the easy way or the hard way!
Ben!!!
Sophie!!!
Ben!
okay, kid, you asked for it.
Ben!
Sophie!
she needed help, Ben.
where the hell is she? She's away, and no one can see her. For how long?
perhaps a year. It's part of the program.
a year? The program? Your own daughter?
what have you done?
she was hurting herseIf.
destroying our family. It had to stop.
you're wasting your time and ours.
why don't you just go? Screw you.
l told her to take it easy on you, but she was right.
you're a prick.
all right, kid.
I'm calling the police if you're not off this property in 20 seconds.
is this really what you want?
Hey!
where are you taking us?
Hey?!
Hello?!
they won't answer you.
where are we?
Fiji.
where the hell is Fiji?
Oh, fuck...
Hey!
it'll be all right. Let's go!
everybody, get off the boat.
Hurry! Move it!
it's a long hike. Okay!
let's go, let's go!
let go of me.
let's go, let's go. Come on!
come on, get up!
Ow! Goddamn! You Bitch!
get off!
you dick.
keep moving.
come on, get up.
come on, come on, let's go!
move it!
Wilcox, Jack. Portland.
excuse me, why are we even standing Is your name Jack? No.
then shut up!
Wilcox, Jack!
cold turkey's on the menu here, boy.
hope you got an appetite.
Randall, Daniel. Chicago.
quiet type, huh?
Bauer, Sophie. Denver.
okay, so since you know who we are, who the fuck... Argh!
get off of me!
my name's Logan.
I'm in charge of security here.
you'll come to appreciate me in due time.
this isn't a prison camp.
you'll notice that there are no walIs here.
we don't need them.
if you leave the camp's perimeter, your sensors will tell us.
and if you think you can swim for it, take a look around.
you're on an island, surrounded by ocean, surrounded by more ocean.
and if the undertow doesn't get you, the sharks will.
take off any jewelry or personal belongings.
let's go!
you'll get it back.
well...
now we're gonna educate you on how to be strong and how to follow the rules.
the faster you learn, the sooner you can go home.
ln the meantime, enjoy your stay.
Oh, my God! What the fuck? You're kidding, right?
l mean, we can't stay out here all night!
you a good swimmer, Jack?
Ah... !
Ah!
each morning when the sun rises, this land is the first place on Earth to receive its rejuvenating rays.
we are truly blessed, and for that we should give thanks.
I'm Dr. Arthur Hail, founder and director of Camp Serenity.
please come and join me.
faggot.
Jack, right?
Jack, we don't allow those kind of words within the camp grounds.
what grounds? We're on a beach in the middle of fucking nowhere!
it wasn't a very friendly welcome!
chaining us to cement blocks and nearly haIfdrowned!
each one of you have emotionally, psychologically, and even physically kept your parents chained to a block of concrete day and night for years now.
so we think it's only fair to let our newcomers experience what it feeIs like to be in your parents' shoes, if only for one night.
come along now.
you can now count yourseIf as proud members of ASAP.
advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me to help troubled teens as yourseIf to avoid the negative patterns in our society that can destroy your ambitions, your education, your families, their future.
you sick freak!
what the hell is this shit?!
Hey! You motherfucker! What the Argh!
taste that, huh?! Ah... !
huh?
go on, have a good taste!
get up!
you're coming with me.
here, in this beautiful, serene environment, those sensors and these boundaries symbolize a conflict with the world.
you can have all the freedom you want.
it's all here for you. Accessible.
at the same time, it's all out there, in your everyday world.
the program requires discipline, dedication and some hard work.
as young Jack just displayed, some of my new admissions can't help but to give in to rage.
we're not here to deny your feelings, rather to explore and examine them and hopefully express them in a more constructive manner.
and l will help each one of you to achieve your goaIs.
this is where our adventure begins.
and here we have Ellen, one of our finest members.
she will get you settled in.
follow me.
everyone starts as a black shirt.
it symbolizes your confused emotional state.
as you work the program, you progress, first to yellow and then to white, like me.
if you work the program, it will work for you.
the program must've really worked for you.
Hey, how'd they suck you in?
bribed by Twinkies?
I'm going home in ywo months.
the only way you're gonna get out of here is with a white shirt and a smaller chip on your shoulder.
let's go.
have a seat, Wilcox.
Trina!
done!
show Sophie your space.
Randall!
Lnside.
you okay?
our world isn't exactly designed for your comfort, you know?
it's either this, the floor, or the cement blocks on the beach.
hurry up. Let's go.
come on.
it's weird, huh? Looking at those clothes and thinking about the ones you used to wear back in your neighbourhood? l had some real nice stuff.
but now it's just the same old shit every day.
well, l highly doubt she came here in a hot little party dress.
no. Sweatsuit and about 30 pounds heavier.
like, a real fatass?
skinny little bitches like you used to make fun of me all the time.
so I was a cutter.
no one makes fun of me anymore.
so... who's our new arrival?
miss Hail, this is Sophie Bauer.
welcome... Sophie.
hail? Dr. Hail's sister.
let's get you ready for your BCS.
body cavity search.
just in case you're concealing any Twinkies?
sorry for being so late, Ben. Thanks for coming.
thank you, Mrs. Bauer.
have you heard from her?
no.
but you've got to stop calling the house.
is that why you asked me here?
it won't do you any good.
if you care about my daughter, you won't pursue this.
I don't believe this is what you wanted.
I can appreciate your feelings, but I know what's best for her.
do you know how much she needs you?
ever since her father died, you're all she has.
me?
Yeah.
maybe it's not my place to say, but she thinks you don't care. l mean the only thing that matters to you is this Karl.
you're right, Ben. It's not your place.
Mrs. Bauer, she means so much to me.
is she at least safe?
there's a camp.
serenity SomethingorOther.
it's in the South Pacific.
they're gonna help her, Ben.
thank you.
really too late to call
so we wait for
morning to wake you
it's all we got Ben!
to know me as hardly golden Marry me.
is to know me all wrong
at every occasion
I'll be ready for a funeral So, what, they don't work?
they're just making sure we don't steal shit.
hmm. So the inmates are running this, huh?
hail gives them a little more power, a little more freedom, extra food...
it seems to work.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think l'd rather be hungry.
Thanks, though.
Jesus Christ.
how can they get away with this?
I don't want to do this.
a clear conscience is to your soul what good heaIth is to your body.
you agree?
Trina's been with us for 6 weeks now.
she's from New York.
this is her first session.
so give her your support.
why are you here, Trina?
I don't know.
she don't know.
so you have nothing to tell us?
you can tell us why you're here, can't you?
you have nothing to confess, nothing to say?
no? You can say it out loud.
you can say it to us. Come clean.
just say it.
I don't know, sir. Honestly.
I'm very disappointed in you, Trina.
l thought it was time for you to advance.
me! Me! ...
Gildner! Foster!
Madison!
Murphy!
you sucked dick for money, didn't you?
to buy drugs, you sucked dick, didn't you?
didn't you? Didn't you?!
that's all you are, a fiIthy whore.
a little junkie whore!
you stole, didn't you? Did you steal from your mother?
No! Bitch! Did you?
you turned their life into hell!
bitch! Junkie!
did you?
liar! Liar!
No! Stop!
you go live with my parents!
with their religious Jesus bulIshit!
their Bible and their curfews!
I couldn't take it anymore! l just couldn't!
I made a bet with my friends, you know.
see who could do the most guys.
that night.
and l went for it. l really went for it.
I slept with...
... seven...
... 7 or 8.
and every time, l wished that they could see me.
and it made me feel so damn good to see how much it would hurt them!
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
we love you, Trina.
we love you.
our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us...
God, give us the serenity to accept what we cannot change, the courage to change what should be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference.
hook me up.
Hey, Ben? You pick up Dad's cleaning?
I forgot. I'm busy.
Hey, what's all the excitement?
it's chicken. Once a month.
but there won't be any left for us.
Oh, Trina...
Trina, Trina...
it's just a piece of chicken, Logan.
you know the rules here.
right?
why should you get an extra piece of chicken and no one eIse?
what makes you so goddamn special?
I'm not special.
you know that this could keep you a black shirt forever?
I can't.
you know, I was ready to recommend that we move you up.
unless...
unless, of course, you want to make a deal.
hmm?
I can't. Please.
please.
no...
it's terrible out there.
Oh, it's not so bad.
come on! Quick!
get out!
everybody, out!
look at them, the way they react.
shouldn't we help them?
be my guest.
let's all move inside!
Trina's still in there!
Trina!
Trina, come on! Trina!
Trina, come on!
get up!
girIs, here! Now!
I'm in charge of work detail today.
we're rebuilding these tents.
what about the boys?
Hey, it ain't my logic.
we just do the work and get it done. That's it.
all right! Let's go! Come on!
excuse me.
come on! Take the bottom!
okay, now take the back. Okay, pick it up.
pick it up!
what are you doing?
resting?
get up! Get going!
Trina, I'm tired, okay?
Trina, please just stop.
I get it, okay? Just let me rest.
you're not the only one who's tired. Get up!
please just let me rest for one second.
get up, rich girl!
keep going!
I'm really, really tired...
if you don't work, we all get punished.
we have to learn to work together. Don't make me do this.
go ahead.
too soon.
I don't think so.
come on.
Ahhh!
come on!
kick her! Please, I can't!
kick her! Kick her!
okay, so maybe I was wrong.
every time we give these kids the proper incentive, they will rise to the occasion.
liar! Liar! ...
how long have you been hooked?
a couple of months.
that girl out there, she's in rough shape. I'll be the judge of that.
their files.
sorry for the inconvenience.
with the storm, we're rebuilding.
I will never forget the day l climbed on top of that sand dune and l saw this old, brokendown service camp for the first time.
well, lucky me.
just imagine, if you hadn't, l'd be home with my boyfriend right now.
you see, all around us is a protected area.
the Fijians found an ancient civilization here.
a wellorganized society.
can you imagine?
cookies and milk?
come on. You've got to be kidding.
okay...
so what's the big idea?
the idea?
I'll give you one cookie.
ln return, you open up and tell me all your deep, dark secrets.
well, here's a deep, dark secret for you, Doc.
I hate cookies.
all right, then. Let's get started.
you hate cookies, you don't care about ancient civilizations, you have a boyfriend back home...
... and you hate your mother.
no, I don't.
she hates you.
what loving mother and father would send My father's dead.
Karl is not my father.
all right, then.
what loving mother would sign over the care of her only daughter to a monster like me?
okay, listen, Dr. Shrink,
I don't know what your game is, but I'm not playing it.
you might have all these monkeys believing that you're some kind of leader and healer of this grand utopian society, but I have to tell you something.
I'm not buying it.
so you know what? Have your milk, and l hope you choke on your cookies.
Roberts.
Gibson.
Richards.
Hey, fuckstick!
I'm talkin' to you.
you got something to say?
let me tell you how things work around here.
Jack... it's your time.
we're about to eat.
well, enjoy your cookie.
everyone eIse, get your asses to dinner!
Ben...
look, I have so many things I have to tell I know.
how did you get here?
they're going to help her, Ben.
where is it, jackass?!
Henry, he's killing him! Do something!
you touch that phone, he's dead.
he's a maniac!
you better give me that money by Monday!
I'll handle it. What do you owe money for?
it was the only way to make them believe this was all real.
you...
it's only saline solution.
I just burst a couple of blood vesseIs.
we're gonna get out of here.
all right?
okay.
okay.
move it! Back to camp!
come on!
let's go!
you wanna be strong?!
Yes, sir!
let's see some balIs! Come on!
let's go, ladies! Come on, move it!
come on, Richards! What are you doing?!
get up! Don't pussy out on me!
all right, ladies!
do you want to be strong?
Yes, sir!
do you want to get off this fucking island?
Yes, sir!
get in the water, ladies. Yes, sir!
let's go! Move it!
come on, you little fishies!
let's go.
get up!
you're weak, Randall!
head home, ladies!
I have an announcement to make.
for her hard work and team spirit,
Trina has been awarded a yellow shirt.
you should all keep up the good work.
it's the only way to get home.
I'm very proud of you, Trina.
stop jerking off! Let's go!
go, Sophie!
Sophie's been with us for over a month now.
you're wasting your time.
I got nothing to say.
that's fine.
let me say a few words anyway.
Sophie's a...
young, beautiful woman.
she's smart, doesn't like cookies...
... and she has some unresolved issues with her dead father.
would you like to tell us about it?
no?
anybody eIse?
me! Me! ...
Foster!
get up!
you little bitch!
she's a pathological liar.
you think you're better than everyone eIse!
tell them it's a lie!
stupid liar! Nobody loves you!
liar! Liar! ...
stupid bitch! You little bitch!
get out! Get out now!
now!
say it, huh? Say it!
you think you're better than everybody eIse.
don't you? You know that!
stop!
I'm sorry!
excuse me, l really want to apologize for the scene l caused earlier.
I shouldn't have acted that way in front of Karl and my mother.
it's just that I've been in a highly agitated emotional state.
you see, ever since Karl married my mom, he's been coming into my bedroom every night forcing me to have sex with him.
you little bitch! Tell them it's a lie!
l lied, okay?
l lied.
I'm sorry.
it's just me.
I got a plan. We're gonna get out of here.
there's no way out.
I got it all set up.
trust me.
look, l lied, okay?
l fucking lied.
I am ashamed and I am humiliated.
and if l didn't fuck up, neither you nor l would I don't care!
forget it! We all make mistakes.
I'm not gonna make one by letting you stay here.
hail said this is a good place.
maybe this is the right place for me.
hail doesn't know what he's talking about.
he's not even a real doctor.
he got his PhD on the lnternet. Okay, okay...
I'm sorry. You're right. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Sophie...
today, I want you to write an imaginary letter.
to who?
to you.
from your parents. I want you to write the letter you'd like to receive from your parents if they could write to you here.
what do you think your parents would tell you?
dig into your psyches. It's a good exercise.
you better focus, unless you want to stay here overnight.
now!
let's go! Let's go, let's go!
ln ywo months, it could be me on that boat.
I can't imagine being here for ywo years.
it's like a lifetime.
it's been the most important and fuIfilling ywo years of my life.
Hut!
stay down, pretty boy.
easy, Jack. It's just touch.
Yeah. You need to cool it.
you gonna cry now? Let's go.
line up!
you wanna piss off Jack?
lateral it back to me, then go long.
got it? Got it.
okay, watch your man!
yeah... All right!
watch him! Let's do this!
go! Go!
get him, get him!
he's going deep! Fuck!
get back in there! Move!
1024 is cleared and secure.
all right, let's play ball.
Hut! Hut!
too rough for you, pretty boy?
what's wrong? Can't breathe?
stay down.
Nick is leaving us after ywo years.
he's another great example that our program can reform even the toughest case.
I'm so proud of him and his achievements, that I'm gonna bring him with me to my seminar in Los Angeles.
are you ready to put the past behind you and forgive your parents?
Yes.
I thank you for that, sir.
I know exactly what to do with my life now.
we have all given him the tooIs to achieve this great leap forward.
we gotta get out of here.
remember how you said you had a plan?
okay, I'll tell you when.
we should probably do it when Hail's out of town.
'Dearest Danny, " if you get this letter, it means it's a fake, " because we would've never written to you, not in a million years. "
Yeah, I know.
we're not getting through to him.
not yet. Next.
'my sweetest girl, " I've been dead for a few years now, " but I know you'd rather hear from me " than anyone living, " because no matter what you do, I'll always support you.
'Don'tjudge your mother too harshly.
she loves you dearly and is doing her best. "
sounds like the beginning of a breakthrough?
I don't think so.
she's too smart a girl.
just trying to curry favour, manipulate me somehow.
you kind of set the program up that way.
thank you for the insight, Rhonda.
I know how much you resent the parents, but most of them have tried their best.
every time you go back, it takes such a heavy toll on you.
what's the matter with you?
the seminars are a crucial part of my program.
educating the parents is as vital as educating the students.
don't you forget.
l just worry.
the court cleared us, you remember?
but if that girl hadn't died...
we wouldn't be here?
she did.
just worry about our children.
come on, come on...
come on...
we go tonight. What?
I'll pick you up.
let's go.
where are we going?
the main island. There's a resort.
please settle into your seats.
no taking no notes, recording, photographs, cell phones.
thank you, and welcome.
the Advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me, was designed to give you back your lives, and to ensure a positive future for your sons and daughters.
and I'm very grateful, because you have trusted me with your children.
now it's time to make sure that you can be trusted when they return back home.
you see, your children work hard at Camp Serenity.
but they can't return to the same home environment from which they left.
and it's important you remember now that you share equal responsibility for the state that they were in when they first came to me.
when did you first realize that you couldn't trust Ben?
it was only a short while ago.
frankly, it came out of nowhere.
that's why it was so painful for us.
he told us that his girIfriend dumped him.
Sophie.
that's right.
he took it real hard, and before that, we never had any problems.
Ben convinced us your program would help him.
l understand.
come on!
what happened?
Ben!
Ben, what's going on?
Ben!
hang on!
we have a reservation, under my name.
is room 14 ready?
Oh, my God!
Oh, you're a fucking genius!
Shhshhshh. No, no, that's great.
that's absolutely perfect, thank you.
plane leaves tomorrow morning.
what do you want to do till then?
strange are the things
that draw me to you
do me a favour
once in a while Young love...
what a wonderful sight.
remember it.
welcome back.
Ben and Sophie betrayed us all.
ln the world we live in, the actions of one person affect the lives of others.
it's time you understood your responsibility towards other people.
we will alI have to pay for Ben and Sophie's seIfish behaviour.
so for the next three months, no breakfast and no time off.
you're dismissed.
awesome.
l hate breakfast anyway.
you fucking watch yourseIf.
good morning, son.
come on, Danny, save yourseIf.
from who?
l made a mistake.
why do I have to be held responsible for my parents' denial and paranoia?
Danny, you can't shift the blame of your behaviour.
l accept no blame.
I don't recognize my parents' right to put me here.
I don't recognize the legal system that allows you to keep me here until I'm 18.
and l certainly don't recognize your fucking credentiaIs!
do you recognize you were gonna kill your family?!
parents, friends, your teacher! Huh?!
Murdurer! Murderer! ...
murderer!
l would never murder anyone.
l created... a character...
... to piss off my parents.
you created your own world, didn't you?
misunderstood doctor who cares only for broken children?
teach me.
come on, Doctor!
teach me, Doctor! Show me where l went wrong!
Nooo...!
liar! No...!
all right, Romeo.
let's go. Hail's waiting for you.
you weren't hard to find.
how's that? It's a small island.
we knew you stole that fishing boat.
pretty stupid.
you didn't try to stop me.
what for? What would you have learned?
no, you had to go through it.
ln order to end up back here?
why did you come here, Ben?
I think by now it's pretty obvious.
love? Admirable.
but you decided to express that love by almost drowning Sophie, destroying whatever progress she'd made so far, subjecting her to humiliation, only to end up in your present state of mind.
was it worth it, Ben?
what?
going through this whole charade.
you sacrificed your relationship with your own family and jeopardized the progress of every kid in my program just for your own personal desire.
what now? You gonna send me home?
Yes.
no.
there's a plane leaving the main island on Thursday.
so in three days, I'll be free of you, and you of us.
if you step out of line,
I'm gonna make Sophie's life a living hell.
Hey.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Ben.
Ben!
what if Hail's right?
what are you talking about?
I shouldn't have come here.
it made things worse.
what?
l almost got you killed out there.
we could've died.
so?
Hey, listen...
at least we tried, right?
the only way for you to survive here is to be part of the program.
me?
what?
you just said the only way for me to survive here...
Ben?
Ben, what's this really about?
he's sending me home.
listen, you can't leave me after all we've been through.
say you want me.
say it.
say it. Huh?
I've seen the way you look at me.
no. Yeah.
I know you want me.
no, we had a deal.
listen, l make the deaIs, slut!
No! Stop! Stop it!
No!
No! Stop!
No!
No...!
Ahhh!
No!
shut up.
No!
shut up!
I knew you wanted it.
Jesus, Trina, what happened?
get out of here!
Jesus Christ, Trina. What happened to you?
No! Get out of here! Leave me alone!
l swear on my father's grave, l won't say a word.
what happened?
he promised me he'd help me if l...
he raped me, Sophie.
he raped me.
Oh, my God, Trina.
Trina...
I'm so sorry.
and now...
he's gonna be the asshole l remember forever.
come on.
rule number one!
obey the rules, sir!
number ywo!
discipline, sir!
number three!
leadership, sir!
all right, you know the drill!
Ben!!!
what are you doing, Randall?!
let go of that buoy!
come into shore now, goddammit!
what are you doing?!
help him! What the fuck are you doing?!
he's drowning! He can't swim! Hang on.
I got him.
come on, Danny!
come on!
get off him!
get out of here! You don't know what you're doing!
come on, breathe!!
breathe!
come on, Danny!
you killed him.
you fucking killed him.
he was trying to escape. Of course he was!
no, he wasn't! It was bulIshit! You killed him!
he couldn't fucking swim! We alI know that!
he was waiting for his opportunity and was gonna make a break for it.
you saw it! l didn't fucking see him!
l tried to get to him! You killed him!
he was trying to escape!
don't you fucking defy me!
you back down unless you want to spend ywo weeks in that fucking hole!
Yes, sir?
all right, let's take him back.
he drowned trying to escape.
you got him?
Yes, sir.
what happened?
what's going on over there?
I don't know. Did you see?
you ruined everything that I've been working towards.
there will be an investigation and civil suits.
I don't see how I can keep you on here, Logan.
you can't run this camp without me.
I can do whatever I want.
don't you think the U. S. Army would like to know where you've been the last couple of years?
one call. That's all.
so what should l tell them?
who's that?
the kids.
my kids.
you see, they won't let us get away with this.
and l certainly won't take a hit for you.
what do you want me to do, sir?
don't say a word until l tell you.
that's all. You're dismissed. Yes, sir.
not a word.
why not?
you see what's happening?
you're losing control, just like before.
you're trying to play God, and the harder you try to hold on, the faster it's gonna fall apart. Just like before!
shut up.
he's graduating early after all.
could he swim? I don't know.
thank you, Dr. Hail.
as you know, we've had a tragedy.
Danny Randall was fighting his own demons, and today they won.
l feel the same pain losing Danny as l would losing my own son.
l devoted my whole life to prove that if we work together, we can reach a common good.
and there's not one person in this room who could honestly say that I haven't given my heart and soul to each and every one of you.
this is bulIshit.
I want you all to know that here at Camp Serenity, justice works for everybody.
it's equal for all.
it's time for Logan to atone for his sins.
atone for my sins...
ln front of all these spoiled little brats?
all right.
let's go.
say it, Logan!
you killed Danny.
fucking say it!
Danny, when he was drowning, that little guy had to dig down deep to find the will to live.
unfortunately, you know what he found?
nothing.
what are you all afraid of?
hmm?
hmm? What are you afraid of?
how many other girIs did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan?
what's that, Trina?
how many other girIs did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan?
Yeah. How many?
how many, huh? Tell us.
how many, huh?
how many?
you were willing to do anything for that yellow shirt.
we made a deal. It's really simple.
a deal? Yeah.
Really? Yeah.
was rape a part of that deal?
l gave this slut what She's a fucking child!
you raped her.
and then you killed Danny.
she's a kid! Look at her!
stop it! Stop!
if we do this, we belong here!
you belong here because your parents have given up on you.
you realize that our parents pay him to take responsibility for us?
I don't mind. Take a look around you.
you come here broken and l put you back together.
and I've saved thousands of children!
yeah? What about the girl who died in your camp in New Mexico?
Yeah.
and God knows how many more.
is that why we're on an island haIfway across the world with less rights than prisoners on death row?
who says we need to be torn down, tortured, humiliated, in order to find the greater good within ourselves?
who decided that makes us better people?
who?! Yeah! Who?
who?!
shut up! That's enough, Ben.
Yeah, you're right. That is enough.
this system does not work.
it never has. It never will.
if we don't stop it, right now, tonight, then Danny wilI have died for nothing!
we can't let that happen!
come on! Come on!
grab those.
come on!
we've got to call for help.
they're completely out of control.
what have you done, Arthur?
I'm not going to let them destroy my camp.
let's go.
we gotta stop this.
Ben, do you realize that by your actions here tonight, you've completely justified my method?
frightened parents will always need to find a way to deal with outofcontrol kids like you.
what are you gonna do now? Shoot us?
perverted piece of shit!
Jack, no!
Ben?!!
one way or another, this had to end, Arthur.
we'll see what the authorities have to say.
you know how it goes, Dr. Hail.
full circle.
that's it.
what are you doing? Who are you?
where the hell are my parents? Get dressed!
why are you doing this?
I wasn't gonna do it!
we're trying to help you, Danny.
here's a list of allergies and things he can't eat.
crystal Kid. Excellent.
excuse me.
can l help you?
Uhhuh. I was in here last week.
l bought this. You said it was new.
when l opened it, it was scratched.
well, if it was sealed when you bought it...
you probably shrinkwrapped it yourseIf, you needledick!
this place is a fraud, okay?
you don't wanna buy anything here!
I'm a little upset... Take the register.
that's enough.
this way. Let's go.
Needledick?
shut up. Like you didn't like it. Maybe for two seconds, but l work here. l need this job. Mmhmm.
so are you coming to Liddy's party tonight?
I don't think so.
well, I'll be there. It'll be fun.
all right. I'll meet you there at, what, 9: 00? Okay.
Bye. Bye.
another satisfied customer.
Mmm. I'm gonna pay for this all week.
ladies... Tadah!
okay, who's drinking what?
I'lI have a scotch, please.
for you, Bob? Taking the high road...
listen, the threestrikes law works.
drugs are a plague on society.
if you can keep the criminaIs off the streets, it's good for everyone.
Amen to that.
you know there were 2 million incarcerations last year?
we've got to be doing something right.
uh, excuse me, Karl?
how many strikes am l up to now?
is there something you want, Sophie?
you know, what concerns me more than drugs is the plague of corrupt politicians.
were you looking for this, Karl? No?
sorry, everyone.
mom? Anyone?
Sophie hasn't been herseIf lately.
come with me, honey. You know, I don't understand why you have to search my goddamn room every single time. Sophie, that is enough!
what? No?
what is wrong with you?
what, Karl? Huh?
three strikes and I'm out?
you ran out of strikes a long time ago, lady.
Hey, where's Sophie?
uh, late.
I want to love you in my room
I want to take off
all your clothes
I want to see you in the daytime
I want to see you in my room
I want to have you
when the sun shines ln between the blinds
so fine do it here in the daytime
what, what, what?
okay...
I'm sorry.
it's okay... It's okay... I can...
it's torture, but, uh...
I can wait. Oh, thanks.
Hey, what's this? It's nothing.
what is it? Nothing. l swear.
it's nothing. l just, uh...
Karl and my mom just raided my room again.
it got a little heated, that's all.
you like to mess with him, don't you?
no. No, I don't.
will you do something for me?
Yeah, sure. Anything.
what?
marry me.
Hehheh. Yeah, okay...
this must be good weed.
no, no, no, no. Look at me.
seriously.
l looked into this. I don't have to be 18 to legally be married in Nevada.
I can finally get away from Karl and my mom and you and l can just be together.
please.
my dad left us a trust fund, okay?
we can use it while you go to college...
whoa, slow down.
you don't wanna marry me? No, it's not that.
it's not that I don't want to marry you or...
okay, if we ever do get married, it can't be for legal reasons.
it's got to be just about us.
you know, like, you, me...
love.
okay.
Sophie Bauer?
who the hell are you?
Hey!
we have parental consent to take you.
get off me!
consent, my ass! Get the fuck off of me!
we can do this the easy way or the hard way!
Ben!!!
Sophie!!!
Ben!
okay, kid, you asked for it.
Ben!
Sophie!
she needed help, Ben.
where the hell is she? She's away, and no one can see her. For how long?
perhaps a year. It's part of the program.
a year? The program? Your own daughter?
what have you done?
she was hurting herseIf.
destroying our family. It had to stop.
you're wasting your time and ours.
why don't you just go? Screw you.
l told her to take it easy on you, but she was right.
you're a prick.
all right, kid.
I'm calling the police if you're not off this property in 20 seconds.
is this really what you want?
Hey!
where are you taking us?
Hey?!
Hello?!
they won't answer you.
where are we?
Fiji.
where the hell is Fiji?
Oh, fuck...
Hey!
it'll be all right. Let's go!
everybody, get off the boat.
Hurry! Move it!
it's a long hike. Okay!
let's go, let's go!
let go of me.
let's go, let's go. Come on!
come on, get up!
Ow! Goddamn! You Bitch!
get off!
you dick.
keep moving.
come on, get up.
come on, come on, let's go!
move it!
Wilcox, Jack. Portland.
excuse me, why are we even standing...
is your name Jack? No.
then shut up!
Wilcox Jack!
cold turkey's on the menu here, boy.
hope you got an appetite.
Randall Daniel. Chicago.
quiet type, huh?
Bauer Sophie. Denver.
okay, so since you know who we are, who the fuck... Argh!
get off of me!
my name's Logan.
I'm in charge of security here.
you'll come to appreciate me in due time.
this isn't a prison camp.
you'll notice that there are no walIs here.
we don't need them.
if you leave the camp's perimeter, your sensors will tell us.
and if you think you can swim for it, take a look around.
you're on an island, surrounded by ocean, surrounded by more ocean.
and if the undertow doesn't get you, the sharks will.
take off any jewelry or personal belongings.
let's go!
you'll get it back.
well...
now we're gonna educate you on how to be strong and how to follow the rules.
the faster you learn, the sooner you can go home.
ln the meantime, enjoy your stay.
Oh, my God! What the fuck? You're kidding, right?
l mean, we can't stay out here all night!
you a good swimmer, Jack?
Ah...!
Ah!
each morning when the sun rises, this land is the first place on Earth to receive its rejuvenating rays.
we are truly blessed, and for that we should give thanks.
I'm Dr. Arthur Hail, founder and director of Camp Serenity.
please come and join me.
faggot.
Jack, right?
Jack, we don't allow those kind of words within the camp grounds.
what grounds? We're on a beach in the middle of fucking nowhere!
it wasn't a very friendly welcome!
chaining us to cement blocks and nearly haIfdrowned!
each one of you have emotionally, psychologically, and even physically kept your parents chained to a block of concrete day and night for years now.
so we think it's only fair to let our newcomers experience what it feeIs like to be in your parents' shoes, if only for one night.
come along now.
you can now count yourseIf as proud members of ASAP.
advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me to help troubled teens as yourseIf to avoid the negative patterns in our society that can destroy your ambitions, your education, your families, their future.
you sick freak!
what the hell is this shit?!
Hey! You motherfucker! What the Argh!
taste that, huh?! Ah...!
huh?
go on, have a good taste!
get up!
you're coming with me.
here, in this beautiful, serene environment, those sensors and these boundaries symbolize a conflict with the world.
you can have all the freedom you want.
it's all here for you. Accessible.
at the same time, it's all out there, in your everyday world.
the program requires discipline, dedication and some hard work.
as young Jack just displayed, some of my new admissions can't help but to give in to rage.
we're not here to deny your feelings, rather to explore and examine them and hopefully express them in a more constructive manner.
and l will help each one of you to achieve your goaIs.
this is where our adventure begins.
and here we have Ellen, one of our finest members.
she will get you settled in.
follow me.
everyone starts as a black shirt.
it symbolizes your confused emotional state.
as you work the program, you progress, first to yellow and then to white, like me.
if you work the program, it will work for you.
the program must've really worked for you.
Hey, how'd they suck you in?
bribed by Twinkies?
I'm going home in two months.
the only way you're gonna get out of here is with a white shirt and a smaller chip on your shoulder.
let's go.
have a seat, Wilcox.
Trina!
done!
show Sophie your space.
Randall!
Lnside.
you okay?
our world isn't exactly designed for your comfort, you know?
it's either this, the floor, or the cement blocks on the beach.
hurry up. Let's go.
come on.
it's weird, huh? Looking at those clothes and thinking about the ones you used to wear back in your neighbourhood? l had some real nice stuff.
but now it's just the same old shit every day.
well, l highly doubt she came here in a hot little party dress.
no. Sweatsuit and about 30 pounds heavier.
like, a real fatass?
skinny little bitches like you used to make fun of me all the time.
so I was a cutter.
no one makes fun of me anymore.
so... who's our new arrival?
miss Hail, this is Sophie Bauer.
welcome... Sophie.
hail? Dr. Hail's sister.
let's get you ready for your BCS.
body cavity search.
just in case you're concealing any Twinkies?
sorry for being so late, Ben. Thanks for coming.
thank you, Mrs. Bauer.
have you heard from her?
no.
but you've got to stop calling the house.
is that why you asked me here?
it won't do you any good.
if you care about my daughter, you won't pursue this.
I don't believe this is what you wanted.
I can appreciate your feelings, but I know what's best for her.
do you know how much she needs you?
ever since her father died, you're all she has.
me?
Yeah.
maybe it's not my place to say, but she thinks you don't care. l mean the only thing that matters to you is this Karl.
you're right, Ben. It's not your place.
Mrs. Bauer, she means so much to me.
is she at least safe?
there's a camp.
serenity Something or other.
it's in the South Pacific.
they're gonna help her, Ben.
thank you.
really too late to call
so we wait for
morning to wake you
it's all we got, Ben!
to know me as hardly golden
marry me.
is to know me all wrong
at every occasion
I'll be ready for a funeral
so, what, they don't work?
they're just making sure we don't steal shit.
hmm. So the inmates are running this, huh?
hail gives them a little more power, a little more freedom, extra food...
it seems to work.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think l'd rather be hungry.
Thanks, though.
Jesus Christ.
how can they get away with this?
I don't want to do this.
a clear conscience is to your soul what good heaIth is to your body.
you agree?
Trina's been with us for 6 weeks now.
she's from New York.
this is her first session.
so give her your support.
why are you here, Trina?
I don't know.
she don't know.
so you have nothing to tell us?
you can tell us why you're here, can't you?
you have nothing to confess, nothing to say?
no? You can say it out loud.
you can say it to us. Come clean.
just say it.
I don't know, sir. Honestly.
I'm very disappointed in you, Trina.
l thought it was time for you to advance.
me! Me! ...
Gildner! Foster!
Madison!
Murphy!
you sucked dick for money, didn't you?
to buy drugs, you sucked dick, didn't you?
didn't you? Didn't you?!
that's all you are, a fiIthy whore.
a little junkie whore!
you stole, didn't you? Did you steal from your mother?
No! Bitch! Did you?
you turned their life into hell!
bitch! Junkie!
did you?
liar! Liar!
No! Stop!
you go live with my parents!
with their religious Jesus bulIshit!
their Bible and their curfews!
I couldn't take it anymore! l just couldn't!
I made a bet with my friends, you know.
see who could do the most guys.
that night.
and l went for it. l really went for it.
I slept with... seven... 7 or 8.
and every time, l wished that they could see me.
and it made me feel so damn good to see how much it would hurt them!
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
we love you, Trina.
we love you.
our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us...
God, give us the serenity to accept what we cannot change, the courage to change what should be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference.
hook me up.
Hey, Ben? You pick up Dad's cleaning?
I forgot. I'm busy.
Hey, what's all the excitement?
it's chicken. Once a month.
but there won't be any left for us.
Oh, Trina...
Trina, Trina...
it's just a piece of chicken, Logan.
you know the rules here.
right?
why should you get an extra piece of chicken and no one eIse?
what makes you so goddamn special?
I'm not special.
you know that this could keep you a black shirt forever?
I can't.
you know, I was ready to recommend that we move you up.
unless...
unless, of course, you want to make a deal.
hmm?
I can't. Please.
please.
no...
it's terrible out there.
Oh, it's not so bad.
come on! Quick!
get out!
everybody, out!
look at them, the way they react.
shouldn't we help them?
be my guest.
let's all move inside!
Trina's still in there!
Trina!
Trina, come on! Trina!
Trina, come on!
get up!
girIs, here! Now!
I'm in charge of work detail today.
we're rebuilding these tents.
what about the boys?
Hey, it ain't my logic.
we just do the work and get it done. That's it.
all right! Let's go! Come on!
excuse me.
come on! Take the bottom!
okay, now take the back. Okay, pick it up.
pick it up!
what are you doing?
resting?
get up! Get going!
Trina, I'm tired, okay?
Trina, please just stop.
I get it, okay? Just let me rest.
you're not the only one who's tired. Get up!
please just let me rest for one second.
get up, rich girl!
keep going!
I'm really, really tired...
if you don't work, we all get punished.
we have to learn to work together. Don't make me do this.
go ahead.
too soon.
I don't think so.
come on.
Ahhh!
come on!
kick her! Please, I can't!
kick her! Kick her!
okay, so maybe I was wrong.
every time we give these kids the proper incentive, they will rise to the occasion.
liar! Liar! ...
how long have you been hooked?
a couple of months.
that girl out there, she's in rough shape. I'll be the judge of that.
their files.
sorry for the inconvenience.
with the storm, we're rebuilding.
I will never forget the day l climbed on top of that sand dune and l saw this old, brokendown service camp for the first time.
well, lucky me.
just imagine, if you hadn't, l'd be home with my boyfriend right now.
you see, all around us is a protected area.
the Fijians found an ancient civilization here.
a wellorganized society.
can you imagine?
cookies and milk?
come on. You've got to be kidding.
okay...
so what's the big idea?
the idea?
I'll give you one cookie.
ln return, you open up and tell me all your deep, dark secrets.
well, here's a deep, dark secret for you, Doc.
I hate cookies.
all right, then. Let's get started.
you hate cookies, you don't care about ancient civilizations, you have a boyfriend back home and you hate your mother.
no, I don't.
she hates you.
what loving mother and father would send...
my father's dead.
Karl is not my father.
all right, then.
what loving mother would sign over the care of her only daughter to a monster like me?
okay, listen, Dr. Shrink,
I don't know what your game is, but I'm not playing it.
you might have all these monkeys believing that you're some kind of leader and healer of this grand utopian society, but I have to tell you something.
I'm not buying it.
so you know what? Have your milk, and l hope you choke on your cookies.
Roberts.
Gibson.
Richards.
Hey, fuckstick!
I'm talkin' to you.
you got something to say?
let me tell you how things work around here.
Jack... it's your time.
we're about to eat.
well, enjoy your cookie.
everyone eIse, get your asses to dinner!
Ben...
look, I have so many things I have to tell
I know.
how did you get here?
they're going to help her, Ben.
where is it, jackass?!
Henry, he's killing him! Do something!
you touch that phone, he's dead.
he's a maniac!
you better give me that money by Monday!
I'll handle it. What do you owe money for?
it was the only way to make them believe this was all real.
you...
it's only saline solution.
I just burst a couple of blood vesseIs.
we're gonna get out of here.
all right?
okay.
okay.
move it! Back to camp!
come on!
let's go!
you wanna be strong?!
Yes, sir!
let's see some balIs! Come on!
let's go, ladies! Come on, move it!
come on, Richards! What are you doing?!
get up! Don't pussy out on me!
all right, ladies!
do you want to be strong?
Yes, sir!
do you want to get off this fucking island?
Yes, sir!
get in the water, ladies. Yes, sir!
let's go! Move it!
come on, you little fishies!
let's go.
get up!
you're weak, Randall!
head home, ladies!
I have an announcement to make.
for her hard work and team spirit, Trina has been awarded a yellow shirt.
you should all keep up the good work.
it's the only way to get home.
I'm very proud of you, Trina.
stop jerking off! Let's go!
go, Sophie!
Sophie's been with us for over a month now.
you're wasting your time.
I got nothing to say.
that's fine.
let me say a few words anyway.
Sophie's a young, beautiful woman.
she's smart, doesn't like cookies and she has some unresolved issues with her dead father.
would you like to tell us about it?
no?
anybody eIse?
me! Me! ...
Foster!
get up!
you little bitch!
she's a pathological liar.
you think you're better than everyone eIse!
tell them it's a lie!
stupid liar! Nobody loves you!
liar! Liar! ...
stupid bitch! You little bitch!
get out! Get out now!
now!
say it, huh? Say it!
you think you're better than everybody eIse.
don't you? You know that!
stop!
I'm sorry!
excuse me, l really want to apologize for the scene l caused earlier.
I shouldn't have acted that way in front of Karl and my mother.
it's just that I've been in a highly agitated emotional state.
you see, ever since Karl married my mom, he's been coming into my bedroom every night forcing me to have sex with him.
you little bitch! Tell them it's a lie!
l lied, okay?
l lied.
I'm sorry.
it's just me.
I got a plan. We're gonna get out of here.
there's no way out.
I got it all set up.
trust me.
look, l lied, okay?
l fucking lied.
I am ashamed and I am humiliated.
and if l didn't fuck up, neither you nor l would
I don't care!
forget it! We all make mistakes.
I'm not gonna make one by letting you stay here.
hail said this is a good place.
maybe this is the right place for me.
hail doesn't know what he's talking about.
he's not even a real doctor.
he got his PhD on the lnternet. Okay, okay...
I'm sorry. You're right. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Sophie...
today, I want you to write an imaginary letter.
to who?
to you.
from your parents. I want you to write the letter you'd like to receive from your parents if they could write to you here.
what do you think your parents would tell you?
dig into your psyches. It's a good exercise.
you better focus, unless you want to stay here overnight.
now!
let's go! Let's go, let's go!
ln ywo months, it could be me on that boat.
I can't imagine being here for two years.
it's like a lifetime.
it's been the most important and fuIfilling ywo years of my life.
Hut!
stay down, pretty boy.
easy, Jack. It's just touch.
Yeah. You need to cool it.
you gonna cry now? Let's go.
line up!
you wanna piss off Jack?
lateral it back to me, then go long.
got it? Got it.
okay, watch your man!
yeah... All right!
watch him! Let's do this!
go! Go!
get him, get him!
he's going deep! Fuck!
get back in there! Move!
1024 is cleared and secure.
all right, let's play ball.
Hut! Hut!
too rough for you, pretty boy?
what's wrong? Can't breathe?
stay down.
Nick is leaving us after ywo years.
he's another great example that our program can reform even the toughest case.
I'm so proud of him and his achievements, that I'm gonna bring him with me to my seminar in Los Angeles.
are you ready to put the past behind you and forgive your parents?
Yes.
I thank you for that, sir.
I know exactly what to do with my life now.
we have all given him the tooIs to achieve this great leap forward.
we gotta get out of here.
remember how you said you had a plan?
okay, I'll tell you when.
we should probably do it when Hail's out of town.
'Dearest Danny, " if you get this letter, it means it's a fake, " because we would've never written to you, not in a million years. "
Yeah, I know.
we're not getting through to him.
not yet. Next.
'my sweetest girl, " I've been dead for a few years now, " but I know you'd rather hear from me " than anyone living, " because no matter what you do, I'll always support you.
"don't judge your mother too harshly. She loves you dearly and is doing her best. "
sounds like the beginning of a breakthrough?
I don't think so.
she's too smart a girl.
just trying to curry favour, manipulate me somehow.
you kind of set the program up that way.
thank you for the insight, Rhonda.
I know how much you resent the parents, but most of them have tried their best.
every time you go back, it takes such a heavy toll on you.
what's the matter with you?
the seminars are a crucial part of my program.
educating the parents is as vital as educating the students.
don't you forget.
l just worry.
the court cleared us, you remember?
but if that girl hadn't died...
we wouldn't be here?
she did.
just worry about our children.
come on, come on...
come on...
we go tonight. What?
I'll pick you up.
let's go.
where are we going?
the main island. There's a resort.
please settle into your seats.
no taking no notes, recording, photographs, cell phones.
thank you, and welcome.
the Advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me, was designed to give you back your lives, and to ensure a positive future for your sons and daughters.
and I'm very grateful, because you have trusted me with your children.
now it's time to make sure that you can be trusted when they return back home.
you see, your children work hard at Camp Serenity.
but they can't return to the same home environment from which they left.
and it's important you remember now that you share equal responsibility for the state that they were in when they first came to me.
when did you first realize that you couldn't trust Ben?
it was only a short while ago.
frankly, it came out of nowhere.
that's why it was so painful for us.
he told us that his girIfriend dumped him.
Sophie.
that's right.
he took it real hard, and before that, we never had any problems.
Ben convinced us your program would help him.
l understand.
come on!
what happened?
Ben!
Ben, what's going on?
Ben!
hang on!
we have a reservation, under my name.
is room 14 ready?
Oh, my God!
Oh, you're a fucking genius!
no, no, that's great.
that's absolutely perfect, thank you.
plane leaves tomorrow morning.
what do you want to do till then?
strange are the things
that draw me to you
do me a favour
once in a while
young love...
what a wonderful sight.
remember it.
welcome back.
Ben and Sophie betrayed us all.
ln the world we live in, the actions of one person affect the lives of others.
it's time you understood your responsibility towards other people.
we will alI have to pay for Ben and Sophie's seIfish behaviour.
so for the next three months, no breakfast and no time off.
you're dismissed.
awesome.
l hate breakfast anyway.
you fucking watch yourseIf.
good morning, son.
come on, Danny, save yourseIf.
from who?
l made a mistake.
why do I have to be held responsible for my parents' denial and paranoia?
Danny, you can't shift the blame of your behaviour.
l accept no blame.
I don't recognize my parents' right to put me here.
I don't recognize the legal system that allows you to keep me here until I'm 18.
and l certainly don't recognize your fucking credentiaIs!
do you recognize you were gonna kill your family?!
parents, friends, your teacher! Huh?!
Murdurer! Murderer! ...
murderer!
l would never murder anyone.
l created a character to piss off my parents.
you created your own world, didn't you?
misunderstood doctor who cares only for broken children?
teach me.
come on, Doctor!
teach me, Doctor! Show me where l went wrong!
Nooo...!
liar! No...!
all right, Romeo.
let's go. Hail's waiting for you.
you weren't hard to find.
how's that? It's a small island.
we knew you stole that fishing boat.
pretty stupid.
you didn't try to stop me.
what for? What would you have learned?
no, you had to go through it.
ln order to end up back here?
why did you come here, Ben?
I think by now it's pretty obvious.
love? Admirable.
but you decided to express that love by almost drowning Sophie, destroying whatever progress she'd made so far, subjecting her to humiliation, only to end up in your present state of mind.
was it worth it, Ben?
what?
going through this whole charade.
you sacrificed your relationship with your own family and jeopardized the progress of every kid in my program just for your own personal desire.
what now? You gonna send me home?
Yes.
no.
there's a plane leaving the main island on Thursday.
so in three days, I'll be free of you, and you of us.
if you step out of line, I'm gonna make Sophie's life a living hell.
Hey.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Ben.
Ben!
what if Hail's right?
what are you talking about?
I shouldn't have come here.
it made things worse.
what?
l almost got you killed out there.
we could've died.
so?
Hey, listen...
at least we tried, right?
the only way for you to survive here is to be part of the program.
me?
what?
you just said the only way for me to survive here...
Ben?
Ben, what's this really about?
he's sending me home.
listen, you can't leave me after all we've been through.
say you want me.
say it.
say it. Huh?
I've seen the way you look at me.
no. Yeah.
I know you want me.
no, we had a deal.
listen, l make the deaIs, slut!
No! Stop! Stop it!
No!
No! Stop!
No!
No...!
Ahhh!
No!
shut up.
No!
shut up!
I knew you wanted it.
Jesus, Trina, what happened?
get out of here!
Jesus Christ, Trina. What happened to you?
No! Get out of here! Leave me alone!
l swear on my father's grave, l won't say a word.
what happened?
he promised me he'd help me if l...
he raped me, Sophie.
he raped me.
Oh, my God, Trina.
Trina...
I'm so sorry.
and now he's gonna be the asshole l remember forever.
come on.
rule number one!
obey the rules, sir!
number ywo!
discipline, sir!
number three!
leadership, sir!
all right, you know the drill!
Ben!!!
what are you doing, Randall?!
let go of that buoy!
come into shore now, goddamm it!
what are you doing?!
help him! What the fuck are you doing?!
he's drowning! He can't swim! Hang on.
I got him.
come on, Danny!
come on!
get off him!
get out of here! You don't know what you're doing!
come on, breathe!!
breathe!
come on, Danny!
you killed him.
you fucking killed him.
he was trying to escape. Of course he was!
no, he wasn't! It was bulIshit! You killed him!
he couldn't fucking swim! We alI know that!
he was waiting for his opportunity and was gonna make a break for it.
you saw it! l didn't fucking see him!
l tried to get to him! You killed him!
he was trying to escape!
don't you fucking defy me!
you back down unless you want to spend two weeks in that fucking hole!
Yes, sir?
all right, let's take him back.
he drowned trying to escape.
you got him?
Yes, sir.
what happened?
what's going on over there?
I don't know. Did you see?
you ruined everything that I've been working towards.
there will be an investigation and civil suits.
I don't see how I can keep you on here, Logan.
you can't run this camp without me.
I can do whatever I want.
don't you think the U. S. Army would like to know where you've been the last couple of years?
one call. That's all.
so what should l tell them?
who's that?
the kids.
my kids.
you see, they won't let us get away with this.
and l certainly won't take a hit for you.
what do you want me to do, sir?
don't say a word until l tell you.
that's all. You're dismissed. Yes, sir.
not a word.
why not?
you see what's happening?
you're losing control, just like before.
you're trying to play God, and the harder you try to hold on, the faster it's gonna fall apart. Just like before!
shut up.
he's graduating early after all.
could he swim? I don't know.
thank you, Dr. Hail.
as you know, we've had a tragedy.
Danny Randall was fighting his own demons, and today they won.
l feel the same pain losing Danny as l would losing my own son.
l devoted my whole life to prove that if we work together, we can reach a common good.
and there's not one person in this room who could honestly say that I haven't given my heart and soul to each and every one of you.
this is bulIshit.
I want you all to know that here at Camp Serenity, justice works for everybody.
it's equal for all.
it's time for Logan to atone for his sins.
atone for my sins...
ln front of all these spoiled little brats?
all right.
let's go.
say it, Logan!
you killed Danny.
fucking say it!
Danny, when he was drowning, that little guy had to dig down deep to find the will to live.
unfortunately, you know what he found?
nothing.
what are you all afraid of?
hmm?
hmm? What are you afraid of?
how many other girIs did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan?
what's that, Trina?
how many other girIs did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan?
Yeah. How many?
how many, huh? Tell us.
how many, huh?
how many?
you were willing to do anything for that yellow shirt.
we made a deal. It's really simple.
a deal? Yeah.
Really? Yeah.
was rape a part of that deal?
l gave this slut what She's a fucking child!
you raped her.
and then you killed Danny.
she's a kid! Look at her!
stop it! Stop!
if we do this, we belong here!
you belong here because your parents have given up on you.
you realize that our parents pay him to take responsibility for us?
I don't mind. Take a look around you.
you come here broken and l put you back together.
and I've saved thousands of children!
yeah? What about the girl who died in your camp in New Mexico?
Yeah.
and God knows how many more.
is that why we're on an island haIfway across the world with less rights than prisoners on death row?
who says we need to be torn down, tortured, humiliated, in order to find the greater good within ourselves?
who decided that makes us better people?
who?! Yeah! Who?
who?!
shut up! That's enough, Ben.
Yeah, you're right. That is enough.
this system does not work.
it never has. It never will.
if we don't stop it, right now, tonight, then Danny wilI have died for nothing!
we can't let that happen!
come on! Come on!
grab those.
come on!
we've got to call for help.
they're completely out of control.
what have you done, Arthur?
I'm not going to let them destroy my camp.
let's go.
we gotta stop this.
Ben, do you realize that by your actions here tonight, you've completely justified my method?
frightened parents will always need to find a way to deal with outofcontrol kids like you.
what are you gonna do now? Shoot us?
perverted piece of shit!
Jack, no!
Ben?!!
one way or another, this had to end, Arthur.
we'll see what the authorities have to say.
you know how it goes, Dr. Hail.
full circle.
that's it.
I've been concerned any improvement is likely a placebo effect.
was Tom Kane admitted to your clinic? I need to know.
Yes. We treated him.
that bag you dropped was light at least five grand.
mayor Rutledge is in the hospital. - How can I help?
Emma is upset. I want you to take her home. You're stronger than this.
had you previously been unfaithful? I'm not going to answer that question.
don't you think we deserve to know who our elected officials are?
I made a fucking mistake.
when I become the next governor, you and I will seldom coincide legislatively or otherwise.
we are fast approaching the annual vote to cover the city's expenditures.
there can be no push-back.
it pains me to be the bearer of bad news.
is this really the legacy you want to leave behind, Mac?
allowing the state's largest city to go under?
this bond acquisition vote provides you an opportunity to stimulate a wind of change.
sacrifice the castle to take down the king.
castles can be rebuilt. Men cannot.
voting will now begin. Alderman Ross? I vote nay.
out of the way! Out of the way!
with a tally of 41 nays, this measure is denied.
McGantry, everything you need you have.
I fully expect you to lock him up before I hand this slam-fucking-dunk case over to the Feds.
time. I want it.
don't have it to give, Tom.
while I appreciate you coming to Springfield in your off-hours to ask, there's nothing I can do.
financial chicanery could have lasted only so long.
and it's to your credit that for over a decade it did.
but without the state bonds, without your own council's support, the city is about to default on some hefty loans.
who do you think you are? I've called for an emergency manager.
the advance team will be there... Who the fuck do you think you are?
the governor of the goddamn state, that's who.
you... have no idea.
how is he?
I'm not sure you have the right to know.
excuse me?
I spoke to his nurse. Nadeem, I believe.
he suggested you could have had something to do with it.
that, for whatever reason, you may have withheld your grandfather's medication, causing him to fall.
is that what you call it? Medication?
the doctors can't say if he'll ever come out of the coma.
hard enough seeing him live through a stroke.
you mean the one that you caused?
sorry? His stupor. It didn't just happen.
it was induced. And you kept him that way with all the bulbocapnine you keep giving him.
I don't understand what you're suggesting. - Why did you do it?
for his money? For his power? For your husband?
Borden. B-O-R-D-E-N? Great. Thanks.
credit reports, disciplinary actions if any, who his family members are... that's what I need.
a real background check. - Got it.
sussing out a source or a date?
this detective I met with called, said he had information for me.
might be moot. Cullen's named an emergency manager.
the city's days from defaulting on its financial obligations.
when it does, Elizabeth Borden takes over.
the attorney who whipped Detroit into shape? Ran it for over a year.
mayor's cutting after-school programs to bridge the budget gap.
nice. How's he gonna pay for the other five billion?
exactly. If Kane can't stop the bleeding, Borden's gonna take him down before you do.
they're here.
hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing.
how many?
dozens.
when can we expect you in? - Soon.
kill all residential streetlights.
let this message be heard.
corruption, political or financial, will not be tolerated by my office.
take a couple questions.
morning. - Morning.
...was taken into custody outside his Gold Coast penthouse.
he was a necessary evil, but known and without association.
I'll make the call.
even my father had to ask for this type of help from time to time.
how is he, by the way, the old man?
unchanged.
Emma, however, is becoming increasingly unstable.
and made accusations last night about the stroke.
she got physical.
Tom, I want her out of this house.
will it be enough to keep the city from going under?
if not, the public wants to know what's next.
I would ask that you endure for a few more days.
how long...
before they try and wrest it from you?
sir, we're ready in your office.
what the fuck are you looking at?
our phone lines are flooded with complaints about the closures.
parents, teachers, conservancy groups, park and rec workers.
temporary inconveniences which must be abided.
sacrifices must be made, particularly in those wards which don't provide enough tax revenue.
nonexistent in the 21st.
then shutter its day care facilities, shelters, and community centers.
sir, I understand your hostility towards Alderman Ross, but his ward's already stretched in terms of public services.
and he no longer has to provide them to residents of Lennox Gardens, because there are none.
at the moment.
I'll notify DFSS about shuttering those agencies right away.
smaller measures like these can help, but, with all due respect, they're a drop in the bucket given the city's deficit.
what we really need is a federal bailout.
which is why I want you in DC.
I need you to push for TARP funds. Get the Treasury to buy our debt.
that's just what I was about to suggest. Take the next plane out.
I'll make some calls, get you in front of the right people. Yes, sir.
Ian, it was a bit chilly when last I visited the conference room.
make our guests more comfortable.
it was sound advice and I took it.
to great success, as it turns out.
congratulations on that McGantry arrest, by the way. Timing could have been better.
we barely made it one news cycle before the budget crisis became a bigger headline.
true, but it's all of one piece, fall of the status quo, ascendency of new leadership.
what can I do for you, Mr. Zajac?
double down.
help me further separate myself from Tom Kane by providing your full power of your field operations.
got to love a man with confidence. If he gets wind of this...
in a few days, he's a nonissue.
city goes broke, it'll be up for grabs.
pretty big takedown. His biggest PAC contributor for years.
he must have done something huge to piss Kane off this much.
like contribute to my campaign. Might not have been Kane's play.
God knows the State's Attorney will do anything to get into the papers.
no, I'm pretty sure Doyle got this handed to him on a silver platter.
Kitty, you give your old boss way too much credit.
and anyway, McGantry is yesterday's news.
today is all about the fact that Chicago's been run into the ground by the bad guys.
we're ready. In here.
and you work for the good guys now.
have a driver meet me at the gate.
I've got my RFP responses here, but I need my PowerPoint overnighted.
I'll call you from the cab.
good a time as any to leave town.
I'm flying to DC, trying to mitigate some of the damage you've done.
it's not my fault the city can't meet its obligations on loan interests.
Kane's been working this Ponzi scheme for years.
by the time the receiver gets it straight, his term's over, and you're out of a job.
should have stuck with Mr. Ross here.
FYI, if Borden takes over, your boss loses, too.
unlike our mayor, I can rise again.
seems like your name may not be worth so much after all.
no. No. No.
No! No! No!
you can't fucking do this! Fuck you!
fucking bitch! Let me out!
sweat it out, bastards.
the city has a pension payment tomorrow of over half a million dollars.
we could save that by shutting down select transit lines between 7: 00 P. M. and 5: 00 a. m.
it'll buy us some time, anyway.
do it, but don't spare rush hour.
not a cut the public will respond well to.
perhaps you should make a statement.
last thing I want to do is become the official face of this crisis when it is the council that is wholly to blame.
I just wish some informed insider would say the same to the press.
sir?
you heard me.
after all these years, I can't believe I've never seen your home.
we don't entertain here often.
well, this is a special occasion, then.
John, my husband's trust isn't easily earned.
I've noticed.
my family's made more than one overture.
Yeah.
but at the moment, Chicago is experiencing financial difficulties.
and you see an opportunity.
I do.
does the mayor even know that I'm here?
he does.
but this was your idea? - Mm-hmm.
Yes.
well, allow me to be the first Vacarro to contribute to Tom Kane's PAC.
John, now is not the time to think small.
no more cutbacks! No more cutbacks!
no more cutbacks!...
this is Ian Todd. Leave a message and I'll call you back.
it's Emma.
you need to come here right away.
they've locked me in. I have to see you. I need you.
if you are satisfied with your message...
no more cutbacks! No more cutbacks!
no more cutbacks! Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd!
any comment on the deficit that stands to bankrupt the city?
um, yes.
I do, actually. Having worked with several council members, I'm struck by the lack of responsibility being taken by its leadership in this crisis.
no less than a month ago, all 50 aldermen approved pay raises for themselves.
but when the mayor needed help in balancing the budget, they refused.
now they're off the radar while public services are cut, citizens suffer, and an emergency manager with a six-figure salary is appointed.
Where's the democracy in that?
excuse me. No more cutbacks!
what qualifies someone, do you suppose, to run a city?
Mr. Kane, out of respect for your position, I came here after hours so as not to cause any...
did you study law?
economics? Get elected?
my team is here to ensure a smooth transition of power.
the fact is, no matter how much money you move around or how many light switches you turn off or jobs you eliminate, the city will default.
and because that is the reality of the situation, I wanted to give you the opportunity to speak with your unions before I cut pensions and cancel contracts.
do you really think I'd allow the likes of you to take this from me?
a bean counter? A shyster?
someone who has more regard for the almighty dollar than the people of this city.
short of a miracle, I'll be back in two days.
I'll see you then.
hope to be your next governor. Your campaign's been on quite a roller coaster.
with the positive press you've gotten since your mea culpa interview, think you still have a shot at winning the office?
Absolutely. Because I still care about Illinois.
which is why I didn't approve the mayor's request for a state-funded bailout. Thank you.
Mr. Kane's played a big part in your candidacy.
has that changed? - Well, he knows, as State Treasurer, I have a fiscal responsibility to each and every taxpayer.
so in good conscience I can't saddle them with a debt incurred in a single city.
and how are the people of Chicago supposed to feel about that?
well, they should be angry. And I don't blame them.
they shouldn't have to feel the pain of mismanagement.
and people can think what they want about me personally, but my record will show I have tremendous fiscal discipline.
Hi, how are you? Thank you so much. Good to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you. Thank you so much.
Hi, how are you? - Hi. Good.
thank you so much for your support. - Nice to see you again.
Yes, great to see you. Thank you for your support.
thank you so much for your support.
let's wrap this up, okay? Thanks, folks.
see you at the polls. City's closing this line down anyway.
what you're suggesting is unprecedented. Worked for the auto industry.
that was corporate.
you are talking about using TARP funds to buy up municipal debt.
the mayor's hoping the Treasury will be pragmatic.
we go down, it's not just Chicago that feels the pain.
not pragmatic to open the door, allowing every distressed city to claim our limited funds.
Illinois' 20 electoral votes.
it is unclear that a weakened Kane can deliver that.
can we get the mayor on the phone with the secretary to discuss our proposal?
why don't you just fucking roll over and die? - Sorry, I told him...
nice to see you, too, William.
you want this city to suffer, at least have the decency to spread it around, not just gut my ward, which as you know, don't have much to begin with.
Why? - Why what?
this?
don't you care about your constituents? The people you were elected to serve?
do you want to see them at the mercy of an outsider?
as opposed to you?
you are not that petty or stupid.
your time has come.
our time.
years of bloody battle between us, now we both lose to a third party.
you're the one who pushed it over the edge.
with that.
that, Alderman can save us both.
Hey, Roxie.
a little bit of this for a little bit of that?
it's Meredith Kane. How are you?
I'm just fine. Thanks for asking.
funny you should call. The wife asked about you just last night.
Oh, give my best to Edie.
mac, I know you're busy, but if at all possible, I'd love to meet you for lunch.
you here in Springfield? - No, in Chicago.
but I could have you flown in on a friend's private jet.
we could chat.
last time we did resulted in a steep National Guard bill.
no, this won't cost a thing.
I'll have you back in Springfield in a couple of hours.
there's someone I'd like you to meet.
never pass on a free lunch.
wonderful. I'll see you soon.
you really do smooth out my rough edges, don't you?
Hello?
you weren't lying when you said someplace out of the way.
well, I can't be too careful with the goods that I got. I like the sound of that.
your suspicions about Ezra Stone are not unfounded.
meaning it was an inside job. Gotta be some terms here if you want the full story.
you know, last time I saw you, you were barside with Kane's pal from the O'Hare ceremony.
kind of seemed like you guys were part of the same fan club.
past tense.
look, CPD's been doing Kane's dirty work for years.
then he turns around and scrapes Royczyk like shit from his shoe.
now he's eyeballing our pension funds to keep the city from going belly up.
you'll go on record? For 10, 000 bucks.
we don't pay for stories. Well, you don't get 'em this good, either.
what, toxic waste in Bensenville? Please.
the "Sentinel" is a paper of record, detective Dinovo, not a tabloid.
Yeah, and I'm a man without retirement pay who needs to leave town if I go public.
I'd say 10 grand was a bargain. Take it or leave it.
there's more to tell.
...that's not what she said to me...
Hey, I don't blame you. Afternoon, gentlemen.
Mr. Taylor.
come here, man. It's good to see you, man.
it's good to be seen. - Yeah.
how you doing?
fine now that charges against me got dropped.
I'm grateful for everything you did in that regard.
you kept your head when you were in custody.
that kind of loyalty is something I very much value.
of course it is.
so the Gardens are done for a while, but I'd imagine you still need some help in the field.
I understand young brother covered for me while I was gone, but...
Trey, go down the hall, get us some ice.
I want to fix the ward boss a drink, catch him up on things.
all right.
how your family, man? Everybody good? Everybody's good.
you had sex with Treasurer Zajac?
oral. In his office.
that part was okay with me.
but then he eliminated my internship, which was way not okay.
and when I saw him on the street, he pretended he didn't know me.
he's just a hypocrite, telling people he's only had one affair.
it's a lie.
Patty, I get why you want to hold him accountable.
I do. It's a completely healthy reaction.
but if you go public with this, you will be savaged.
you will be painted as a slut.
he will deny it, say you're delusional, and everyone will believe him.
don't throw your future away on this. He's not worth it.
I really thought you'd be on my side.
I need a breakdown ward by ward.
get me the southeast first.
I am. Just sleep on this, okay? Give it some thought.
call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it.
okay.
so what was that all about? Oh, she used to work for Zajac.
she's looking for a new job, but we don't have any space for her.
getting too old for this shit.
description, location, compensation.
tonight.
I'm meeting with Senator Carter later.
if we can get assurances that banking won't go after them, maybe we can get the Fed to help.
good, keep at it. How are things going there?
a day from shutting down schools.
I'll keep you posted.
you may be my only hope.
Mac's quite affable, though he and my husband have had their moments.
which is why you're here and not the mayor himself.
as you can imagine, he's quite busy.
and I do play a role.
Oh, it's quite clear how much political power you have, Meredith.
a fella could get used to this.
mac, this is John Vacarro.
so, what's for lunch?
let's go.
I'm not much of a gambler myself, but the track has proven to be a solid investment.
bought it several years ago.
put in a global pari-mutuel betting system.
been a moneymaker ever since. Very nice. As is the box.
nothing quite like it in Springfield.
excuse me.
Mrs. Kane.
Meredith, are you all right? Yeah, I just needed to sit for a second.
shall we cut to the chase before the horses do?
Absolutely.
McGantry's property surrounding Lennox Gardens.
now owned by the state. - Go on.
I buy it at market value plus 5%.
do you? Shouldn't that be phrased as a question, Mr. Vacarro?
we both know market value these days is a turd with a price tag.
three years ago, McGantry bought that same real estate for a hell of a lot more than that. That was then, Mac.
and this is now, I suppose.
we take the guarantee to the banks as collateral for emergency loans.
you come out looking like the savior of Chicago.
Jesus. Someone get me a pair of tights and a cape.
is that my new identity since the riots? - Why not?
think I'll get a chance to place a bet before I have to go?
hard man to find, huh, cuz?
just been working in different places, man.
hmm, sound about right.
you wouldn't be thinking of running off on me now, would you?
I will find you. - I ain't going nowhere, bro.
I'm just building my business back up.
I got a little now if you want it. - The fuck is that?
5K is some serious paper, man. And I ain't got 10 years to wait on you.
have all my money today or we got issues.
you know I ain't got that shit, man.
Hey, look, tell me something, man.
really.
that little white girl worth all this?
man, I'm done with that bitch.
look at the man. He done with her and yet the debt remains.
so tell me, what we gonna do about that?
what's up with the Zajac volunteer?
Oh, she was inexperienced. We don't need her.
you're lying. Why?
I'm not.
if another one's come out of the woodwork, why aren't we running with it?
Catherine, it's gilding the lily. - Not when he's trending up.
proof that it was more than one affair could finish him.
if you've got something on Zajac, I want it.
so either he banged the fat chick or she's mad he didn't bang her. Which is it?
she's just a kid, okay? If we go public...
this is my fourth run.
I don't give a shit about collateral damage.
but the meeting was set.
he can't see you. I'm sorry. - Can't or won't?
Carter's been waiting 15 years to get the gavel on banking.
he's not gonna give it up for this. - He owes his career to Kane.
you think he can get by without Cook County next primary?
look, everyone's watching Walsh/Zajac and thinking maybe Kane's finally irrelevant.
she wins, his pull evaporates.
people forget a fundamental truth.
Tom Kane always finds a way. The further you back him into a corner, the more painful the cuts when he fights his way out.
I'm sorry.
after all this, I'm getting no?
welcome to politics.
you might wish you'd stayed out.
Thanks, you two, but I need to get going.
need to check in with Borden before it gets too late.
sorry you couldn't stay longer, Governor. - Yeah.
Ah. With only a few months left in office, I'm sure Mac wants to make the most of them.
tell Tom I wish him the best with this thing.
I really do. - Will do.
which way to the jet?
tell me.
he's not on board.
they say a mule will labor 10 years willingly and patiently for the privilege of kicking you just once.
he wants more than that.
Yeah. Speak later.
payroll for sanitation won't be met without more cuts.
at this point, we're at mandated furloughs for nonessential city workers.
any word from Mona? - Nothing encouraging.
sir, is it possible that...
will we lose control of the city?
I want this delivered by hand to Governor Cullen.
I believe Governor Cullen is out of the office until tomorrow.
then deliver it as soon as possible, God damn it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Mayor, just thought you should know, the emergency manager is meeting with her advance team in the conference room.
10% across-the-board layoffs aren't enough.
we'll need at least 18.
it has not been two days.
you are interlopers here because of my hospitality. I want you to leave now.
first off, this advance team is here by order of the state.
and in 24 hours... - Get out!
you!
you're postponing the inevitable.
she's wrong.
are you out of your mind? - I wanted to see you.
here, in the middle of nowhere, after not calling me for days?
Yeah, I know I've been out of touch.
no word, no explanation. Nothing.
Kane has a brain disease.
I was tracking that before Rosebud came along.
reason I was over the border when you called? That's where he was during the riots, an experimental treatment center just outside of Toronto.
my gut says that Stone knew about the illness as well, saw that Kane was unfit for office, so he leaks the Bensenville story under the name Rosebud.
Kane ultimately finds out about it and kills him for it.
that the burglary gone bad, which every other paper in town seems so ready to print...
I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it.
now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.
we've got Kane by the balls. - We?
Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.
I did not. I told you it may be Stone.
may be. And I told you, Sam. No one else.
so don't even fucking think about using my name, okay?
look, he can't touch you from a prison cell. That's exactly where he's going.
you think Kane is blinded by ambition? You may want to take a look in the mirror.
Oh, Jesus. Fucking me isn't enough? Now you're gonna analyze me?
excuse me?
look, I didn't mean that.
don't use my name.
I'm gonna use your name anyway. You'll be subpoenaed.
do it. I'll deny everything.
Oh, and by the way... fuck you!
you know, you just... you can't trust her.
I think we can.
defending that kid today was a big move for her as a person.
since when do you give a damn about Kitty as a person?
take it easy.
good news is, we want another Zajac scandal, we got it.
Yeah, no thanks to her.
I need a cigarette. - No, you don't.
sit down. Sit down.
she knows people, so what?
she does. You know me.
I'll be back in a minute.
senator Walsh?
just wanted to say congratulations on your campaign.
voted for you every election.
well, thank you so much. Let's see if we can make it to the governor's office this time, huh?
Yeah. - Thanks again.
are you planning on leaving soon?
no. - Would you mind if I...
go home.
would you like me to arrange for your car to...
it's a sailor's term for being overtaken by misfortune.
hard up in a clinch and no knife to cut the seizing.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Where's Trey?
I don't know, man. But he asked me to talk to you...
to what? - Waste my fucking time?
a few weeks in a suit and he's a player now? Tell him...
hold up, nigga. - I'm here to tell you something, man.
that right? - He wants you gone, right?
so we got one way you can do it, or we got another.
are you serious?
you think you can just get up in my car and threaten me?
I'm trying to do you a favor here, bro.
and I'm gonna do you one by not punching you in your goddamn face.
get the fuck out. - If you don't do this, he'll kill us both, man.
I promise you that. - I ain't scared of that motherfucker.
and sure as hell ain't scared of you. - Keep talking.
give me a goddamn break. Think I don't know who you are? Huh?
darius, the one who's been banging Kane's daughter.
shut the fuck up! - What's this, some kind of joke, man?
Trey trying to punk me out with this shit?
send me some weak-ass, punk-ass, bitch-made puss...
okay, we got to get ready.
they're picking us up in 30 minutes.
come on, baby. Wake up.
okay?
come on, lazy girl.
come on, Tina.
come on, you...
I need medical help!
now! Tina.
sweetheart. Tina, you...
can we say "dead lesbian"?
EMT hinted it was a drug overdose, maybe ketamine.
what about Walsh? Anybody know if she was under the influence?
or should we just write, "Woman found naked in her bed"?
where the hell is Miller? - He's not answering his phone.
track down that EMT. You, don't say lesbian.
or ketamine.
dead woman found in hotel room with Walsh, possible overdose.
I'm going to the hotel.
breaking news...
senator Walsh's top aide was found dead early this morning in the senator's hotel room.
we're going now live to the scene.
was it an overdose? A suiside?
were you doing drugs with her? - What's the nature of your relationship with the dead woman?
why are you afraid to come out of the closet? Is your campaign now over?
how long have you known the deceased?
senator Walsh... senator can you tell us, are you dropping out of the race?
was she just your lover? Is it true you were in bed together?
senator Walsh, did you love her? - Are you a lesbian?
what's the best look for taking over a city?
stripes read serious.
I don't know why everyone's so surprised.
worst-kept secret in Springfield, Walsh being a muff diver.
this just came for you from Mayor Kane's office.
last pitch for clemency?
what is it?
get the mayor on the line.
why didn't you answer? Why didn't you call?
this is dangerous, what we're doing. - They won't know.
this isn't about your parents. It's about you.
are you okay? - I confronted her about everything.
we have to get you out of here. - What, do you think I want to stay?
tell me. Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
well, what if your father negotiated a deal with the State's Attorney?
you'd have to plead guilty. Emma, listen to me.
you'd have to play the part.
I'm not one of their employees. I don't have to eat their shit.
you're right. So forget about what you have to do.
what do you want? I want them to pay for everything.
so put on a dress, paste on a smile, and take the long...
the long view? He'll be dead soon.
what?
lewy Body Dementia.
maybe that's justice enough.
you... you won't tell anyone? You can't.
of course not.
more layoffs are planned as the city's economic picture worsens.
governor Cullen is said to be en route to City Hall where he's expected to make an announcement.
Elizabeth Borden, the emergency manager appointed by the governor, could not be reached for comment , but observers expect her to join the governor for that briefing.
anything at all? - Sir, I wasn't able to...
I'm sorry.
I'm on my way in from the airport.
don't bother coming in.
I want to. - Suit yourself.
no, everything's about to change.
in fact, hell's about to freeze over.
I've got to go.
we heard from Kenya? - Hasn't come by, hasn't called.
this motherfucker gonna miss out on all the fireworks.
what brought you out here today? - They closed the day care. I work all day.
where am I supposed to put my children?
the city's on edge as the deadline approaches for Mayor Kane...
they got here this morning before I did.
what do you think he's doing about all this?
no idea. All I know is how he spent the night.
he come out at all? Make or take any calls?
no. One from the governor, one from another, that's it.
yes?
Cullen's on his way up.
we'll need the briefing room.
please do what you can to make it look presentable. Thank you.
this is it.
you gonna let him know this is going down?
get the press room ready.
sir?
excuse me for interrupting. - I wish City Hall was a taller building.
or closer to the water.
be nice to see the lake.
the governor's arrived.
presumably to hand control to Miss Borden.
some believe you think more clearly near water.
have you heard that?
Mr. Mayor, I cannot express to you strongly enough the urgency of the situation.
I don't want to see you surrender. Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
good man.
another day.
ready?
Emma, please.
I don't feel well.
I know.
brought you some tea.
I'm sorry.
you were right. I have been using again.
made me a little crazy, I guess.
but keeping me in my room kind of forced me to get sober.
and I'm glad.
and I'm gonna be good now, Mom, I promise.
good.
I heard on the radio there's a press conference. What's going on?
I don't know exactly. Kane's in with Cullen.
do you have anything? Should I stop them?
no, we're radioactive.
Ross is here. Fucking vulture.
I'm almost there. - Hurry, they're about to start.
I haven't seen Borden go in yet. You? - No.
what's he doing here?
to the people of Chicago. I'm sorry.
we've suffered together, tightened our belts, made sacrifices.
we can tolerate no more.
and we don't have to.
along with my colleague in the council Alderman William Ross and entrepreneur John Vacarro, we have put together a coalition of leaders from both business and government to build a dazzling complex on the grounds formerly known as Lennox Gardens.
a project to revitalize the city and bring in tremendous revenues, licensing fees, jobs, and tourism.
I present to you The Gardens Convention Center and Casino.
projected income... $2. 6 billion in the first five years, 1. 1 billion in taxes.
a crucial percentage going towards schools, libraries, parks, streets, transportation.
because of our coalition, we are in receipt of this letter of credit allowing the city to borrow against the promise of this epic venture.
and who better to oversee such an undertaking than outgoing governor Mac Cullen, who will serve as chairman for the Chicago Gaming Authority at the end of his tenure.
ladies and gentlemen, we're back in business.
now there are many, of course, behind the scenes who helped bring this project to fruition.
but I would like to thank one in particular.
one who has been a tireless advocate and a driving force in the redevelopment of Lennox Gardens.
got a hit on this aged-up Boetker photo.
this was less than a mile from the site of the shooting.
only partial plates. I assume you're running them now.
so I would ask that you come back to me with the full story, Detective.
seems the budget crisis is over.
public response to the mayor's casino plan has been largely positive.
with the promise of this large a cash infusion over the course of the next several years, several banks have agreed to provide low-interest loans and the emergency manager has been sent packing.
a goddamn casino. With everything that implies.
well, now we know why he wanted us to prosecute Babe McGantry.
Kane just sold the land we seized.
I took the fucking bait for this lawyered-up piece of shit.
fucking fuck!
yes?
what is it? - I just...
very well played, sir.
and I can't begin to tell you what an honor it is to be in your service.
well, considering the way things went today, that could be the case for a long time to come.
I certainly hope so.
and suddenly he's the messiah.
he's untouchable now, Sam.
you know that, don't you?
you all right?
I don't know what I am any more.
I'm assuming that they weren't into recreational drugs... Walsh and...
I heard it was probably ketamine. Is it possible?
could he be that evil? Could he have done this?
can't imagine it was anyone else.
Catherine wasn't going to work for him.
ever.
see, that's what I don't get.
I was still in this race. I could have won it on my own.
not what he wanted. And you weren't gonna win, Ben.
we all but bought Cook County.
what'll she do? Walsh.
open a homicide investigation. Not much else she can do.
you're gonna be the next governor.
he owns you.
there you are.
so, what do you want to do?
you know what I want.
not this.
what do you want to do now?
those TARP funds you had me chasing, we were never gonna get them, were we?
you just wanted me out of the way so you could do this.
you have a daughter, yes?
mine's 10.
it always mattered very much to me that she was proud... of me.
what I do.
and yet, I'm still here.
so I must be lying to someone.
and what about you?
who are you lying to?
there was no political upside to the promises you made.
so either you give a shit and you pussied out, or you're a motherfucking lunatic!
which is it, Tom?
your naivete was charming for a time, Ms. Fredricks, even enchanting.
I wondered what it would feel like to bask in the admiration of someone so pure of intent.
it was nice.
but now I know.
don't bother to collect your things. I'll have someone send them along.
Oh, and give my best to Bitsy.
I'm sure she's very proud of you.
miss.
yes? - If you wouldn't mind.
what is this about?
get in!
now!
aren't women just the best?
you've been through wives before, Denny, five of them.
she's the one. She's the one.
after five or six wives, you still believe in the one?
Denny, you're glowing.
she's an amazing woman, Alan.
mad cow. Mad cow. Mad cow.
like I'm remember it. Mad cow. Mad cow.
love is an ugly busine, my friend, ugly business, ugly business.
- It's 10: 00. - Are we not on?
it's supposed to be tuesday at 10: 00 every week.
we've been moved.
we're wednesday at 10: 00.
nobody called me.
they told Howie in word processing.
they called Howie in word processing?
are we wednesdays at 10: 00 from now on?
no, we're off next week, then on for the following two wednesdays.
what about next year?
best to just keep checking in with Howie.
excuse me, are you Denny Crane?
Denny crane. What can I do for you?
let me rephrase. What can we do for each other?
I'm Sunny Fields of Sunny Fields farms.
I'm in love.
- You're cute. - That, too.
- You eat meat, Mr. Crane? - My place or yours?
I'm a cattle rancher.
the F.D.A. is about to sign off on cloned meat.
once they do, the floodgates are gonna open.
I need a lawyer to stop that flood.
are you that lawyer, Denny Crane?
there's never been a dam or a damsel I couldn't plug.
marry me.
I'm confused. Are you cloning the meat?
no, no, sweetheart.
the biotech companies are cloning the meat.
I'm the one that's trying to stop it.
I believe that procreation should happen the old-fashioned way.
when can we get started?
how far are we away from cloned animals actually being a reality?
Oh, hell, honey. They're already here.
they have hundreds of pigs, and some of their piglets have already made it into the food supply, by the way, and now they're trying to use beef.
my question is, who put the mad cows in charge of the asylum?
Hey, hey, be nice.
they have a moratorium on using cloned animals, which is about to be lifted.
that's why I would like to move fast.
Denny, you don't need me on this.
Carl, uh, I need a heavy hitter.
I thought you were a heavy hitter.
I am, but I'd like to do my hitting on her.
I'm in love with her.
look, Carl, this is a great opportunity for you to be a consumer advocate here, which the country needs because Nader is, uh, running for president again, and, uh, well, I'd ask Alan, but he's busy.
please.
I'm just gonna say this, uh, and let me preface it by admitting I know this is a crazy notion.
okay.
I want to sue my nephew.
okay, what's he done?
it's not what he's done so much as what he's planning to do.
and what does he plan to do?
vote for Obama.
I could be wrong, but I believe he has that right unless there's some fine print in the patriot act.
Alan, he is a delegate.
he plans to vote for obama at the convention even though his congressional district voted for clinton, as did Massachusetts.
well, can he do that?
well, yes. That's the dirty little secret no one's talking about.Even the pledged delegates can ignore their constituencies.
uh, it's unethical in my opinion, and if the rules allow for that, then the rules have to be challenged.
and by "challenged" you mean the little-used act of anarchy known as suing the nephew.
Alan, this nomination could very well come down to a handful of delegates.
poached delegates, I might add.
every vote counts, including my nephew's.
sue.
I'm really quite shocked, aunt Shirley.
I've been taken completely unaware.
how can you sue me?
Mitchell, Mitchy.
you don't think it's wrong that your entire district voted for Hillary?
it's funny how a plurality can morph into an entirety.
must be that Clinton math.
I think your aunt's point, uh, Mitchell, is that Hillary won your district as well as the entire state of Massachusetts.
you have a duty to represent your constituency at the convention, do you not?
well, I'm not duty bound, Mr. Shore.
delegates are more like duty urged.
Mitchell, you're 22 years old with less voting experience than ...
I'll say this for her, she is a bulldog.
excuse me for a second.
probably calling to say she found her voice again.
you have got to be able to stop him.
I don't see how. As he says, he's within party rules.
I...I can't bear it.
well, there's only two other options.
you could stuff him in a barrel and send him out to sea.
or?
you could sue the democratic party.
you can't sue food or drugs.
how can anybody sue food or drugs?
we're suing the food and drug administration, your honor, the F.D.A.
what the hell is that?
that would be the agency in charge of your meds, judge.
and, in fact, I would suspect somebody very much like yourself or Denny is in charge of that department.
Mr. Sack, flattery has no place in this...
that would be a courtroom, your honor.
your honor, this should be in federal court.
they are suing a federal agency, jurisdiction.
Oh, next he's gonna play the sovereign immunity card. It's a dodge.
stop with the jibber-jabber.
jibber-jabber has no place in my courtroom.
do you understand, Mr. Sack?
Yes, your honor, jibber-jabber and flattery.
may I call a witness to lay out my case?
silence. I will decide how to proceed. I am the decider.
call a witness.
thank you, your honor.
I call Sunny Fields.
how we doin' today, judge?
well, aren't you adorable up close?
the motion is filed. We're in at 2: 00.
we're actually suing the D.N.C?
Yes. I also subpoenaed Michy. We'll need him as a witness.
you realize the media will pounce on this.
I've practiced law for 38 years, and never once have I done something stupid.
well, now you're being hard on yourself.
I've seen you be stupid many times.
I sit here in my tastefully decorated office and watch you go about tilting at windmills, many times beating the windmill.
well, it's my turn.
it's my turn to stand up and make a complete idiot of myself and do something that leaves this nation a slightly better place.
that, and a chance to paste your annoying phew.
Yeah. I can't pass that up.
it's settled then.
we are off to sue the democrats.
I know the science, darling.
I also know that most of the scientists who did the thing were hired by the cloning companies.
the science on this is in the bag.
a lot of people have no problem eating cloned meat.
well, most people aren't even gonna know. That's the worst part.
the F.D.A. doesn't even require that the cloned stuff be labeled.
I don't think I'd want to know.
uh, have you any evidence that cloned meat is unsafe?
no. Well, it's too early to tell either way, but if it's not natural...
would you eat it?
all the F.D.A. studies have concluded that it's safe.
honey, the F.D.A. said that vioxx was safe.
isn't the real issue here that you're a cattle rancher, and you don't want the competition?
no, I'm more concerned about animal abuse, darling.
animal abuse? - Yes.
the surrogate mothers are pumped up with high levels of hormones.
the clones are often born with compromised immune systems, which require massive doses of antibiotics, which, by the way, opens up the door for the veterinary pharmaceuticals to enter into the human food supply.
there is no evidence that cloned meat poses any health risk.
darling, cloning increases the risk of foodborne illness.
even the national academy of sciences says so.
once you take nature out of the process, which cloning does, it destroys the natural barriers against disease.
now that poses a health problem for cows and people, like you and me.
Mr. Shore, Wolfgang Blitzkreig with the best political news team in television.
I have no comment yet.
ms. Schmidt, Wolfgang Blitzkreig with the best political news team in television.
could I get you to talk just for a second with the best political news team in television?
go away.
this has been Wolfgang Blitzkreig with the best political news team in television.
you only got it here.
this is... outrageous.
we had a feeling you'd say that, judge.
but we actually do have a case.
no, you do not.
the democratic party is a private organization.
we make what rules we want.
not when it violates one man, one vote.
what is it you're asking me to do?
we'd like a court order, judge, that says that pledged delegates have to vote for the candidate they're pledged to, certainly on the first ballot.
you want me to tell the democrats how to run their own party?
somebody's got to.
give me one good reason why I shouldn't dismiss this right now.
okay. Uh, you're a fair and open-minded jurist.
give me another reason.
okay. As long as there are only two political parties, the public only has two choices for president.
one of them is being picked by delegates like Mitchy Weston, that toddler over there, whose vote is worth 13, 000 times the vote of you and me.
you're talking about a process that's been in effect. - I know what process I'm talking about.
and it's about time it be exposed for the fraud that it is.
fraud? - Yes, fraud.
if the primaries really don't count, then they are just a sham.
they count, they're just not binding, snidey-butt.
I want it on the record that I've just been called "snidey-butt" by a person whose vote is worth 13, 000 times more than mine and yours and your honor's.
that's enough.
we'll adjourn until 9: 00 tomorrow morning.
I'll conduct a full evidentiary hearing.
okay, Shirley, you're up.
ms. Schmidt, Wolfgang Blitzkreig with the best political news team in television.
we really are the best, by the way.
can you tell me, has this case been politicized?
Oh, you were brilliant.
honey, I'm always brilliant.
I don't just jump into bed with any woman, you know?
actually, I do.
but this time it's different.
I...I think we should be together.
you're sweet. - No, I mean it.
I'm falling in love with you.
honey, I think you're cute like a button.
but I tend to treat men like horses.
I ride them hard and then I turn them out.
I'm okay with that.
truth is, my tawdry affairs tend to last longer than my committed relationships. But this is different.
I feel a real connect.
Denny Crane, I'm a cattle rancher.
you think a big city slicker like yourself would be happy living on a farm?
I love horses. I love cows. I love sheep.
especially sheep.
I'm an all-or-nothing kind of girl.
if you're with me, you gotta be on a farm.
I'm there.
you're out of your mind.
Oh, this woman, Alan. she's the one. I know it.
in just one day? - In ten minutes.
Oh, come on.
it was like a movie. A glance here, a look there.
has that ever happened to you? - No.
she's a goddess, Alan.
you really are smitten.
so is she. I could see it in her eyes.
did you know that I'm as cute as a button?
Denny said this with love and the spirit of friendship.
the idea of you on a ranch... - what?
well, you're a little... - A little what?
roly-poly. In a good way.
I'm a rugged man.
Yes, and cute as a button.
Ah, dear.
the best political news team ever assembled in the history.
the rules may technically allow the pledged delegates to ignore the mandate of the popular vote, but that's certainly not what the democratic party advertises.
people go to the primary polls under the assumption, an assumption cultivated by the D.N.C.,that whatever candidate wins that primary, he or she will get the delegates.
let's put our cards on the table, Ms. Schmidt.
you're for Hillary. - I am.
and you want your nephew to vote for Hillary.
I want the delegates, especially the pledged delegates, to give the primary some meaning.
it should probably also be said, we're in a time of war.
what do you mean?
well, the country needs stability.
it needs to count on its bedrocks, its established traditions.
for 20 years now, we've only had 2 families in the White House.
just the first a Bush then a Clinton, then, uh, Clinton again, then another Bush, then that Bush again. It's time for another Clinton.
we simply cannot afford to experiment in such uncertain times.
what the hell was that about?
what?
you totally politicized this. You practically stumped for obama.
I did no such thing.
I just happen to be a big fan of dynasties and monarchies. Oh, I love monarchies.
this is not to be turned into your political forum, Alan.
look, Sirley,I'm as a friend, one who can hold you on the bad days and spoon you on the good ones?
Alan, this is a good thing for you, what's going on here.
how so? - Well, you want Hillary, right?
consider Hillary's behind in the count.
she can't possibly be the nominee unless she poaches some of Obama's pledged delegates.
and if delegates are bound to the mandate of the voters, that may be good for democracy, but it would be very bad for Hillary.
so you need to just chill out, relax.
if anybody's gonna hijack this thing, it's gonna be the Clintons, so just chill.
if you even think of using this case to plug obama, you're using it to promote hillary.
I am promoting the process.
a process that can only spit out Clintons or Bushes who have experience..
Oh, aren't you sick of experience? - The only reason your guy is senator is because the incumbent was caught in a sex scandal. - Oh, please. She was a first lady.
she didn't. Oh,now you're gonna play the sex scandal card? - She was not just a first lady.
doesn't the script call for you just to keep repeating she is a senator, a committed lawyer.
Reverend Wright, reverend Wright?
except when she's finding her own voice, which is crybaby. - Turns pretty phrases and say "yes, we can..."
Shirley, I'm telling you, if she gets the nomination,I'd sooner vote for the dead guy from Arizona. - Not to mention, he looks like a girl. - On top of that, she looks like a man.
listen to us.
we've knocked to the level of presidential candidates.
hug?
don't try anything.
you can ride, Denny Crane.
Yes, I can. I'm an old farm boy.
I can see that.
can we stop?
I'd like to check out the scenery.
that, and my balls hurt.
it's beautiful, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.
if this cloning thing becomes a reality, I'm gonna be outta business.
let me ask you a question.
you got, uh, what, a thousand head of cattle here?
what's your control, really?
I mean, how do you safeguard against, uh, the, uh, the mad cow or any other disease?
it's not like you can vet every animal.
well, if I had a mad cow, I wouldn't need a vet to tell me.
my daddy said that the other cows take care of that.
they shun the afflicted animal.
well, even so, uh, can't you make beef more pure using high-tech methods, like cloning?
no, if I believed that, I wouldn't be fighting this.
I really wouldn't. I mean it.
what?
I've never mentally undressed a woman chaps before.
come on over and meet the livestock, Denny Crane.
and I don't want you flirting with any of them.
Hello, my darlings. This is your lawyer.
he's a sweetie pie.
well, that wasn't very good manners, was it?
it's as if you had mad cow, Denny Crane.
don't be ridiculous. You can't be diagnosed by a fellow cow.
I can. They know.
Oh, come on. And they told Sunny to be shunned by your peers like that.
will you listen to yourself?
come on, Alan. You've seen the studies where dogs can smell cancer.
the animals, they sense things.
the whole herd...
my condition was obvious to them.
am I that far gone?
okay, look, you've known you have issues. It's no big deal.
it's a big deal because I love Sunny.
and she's not gonna let me be around her livestock if she knows I've got the, uh, the, uh mad cow, mad cow.
you're tinking like a crazy person. - That's not gonna help.
Denny, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this sudden and profound love you have.
that's because it's never happened to you.
it's happened to me, I tell you.
you just met her.
Alan, we need to go.
Denny, we'll talk later, okay?
what's wrong?
his client's cows are on to him.
you realize, Mr. Weston, that your congressional district and the state of Massachusetts voted for Hillary Clinton?
I do realize that, yes.
your own constituency thinks that what you're doing is wrong.
well, to quote the vice president when told the American people don't want to see more soldiers die, "so"?
he really said that. I kid you not.
Mitchy, as a result of the Massachusetts primary results, you became a pledged delegate to Hillary Clinton.
Yes, but according to the D.N.C. rules, I'm not bound by that.
no, I am not.
who does that remind you of? I did not have sex.
look, I am entitled to vote my conscience.
that's what I'm choosing to do.
your conscience won't allow you to vote for Mrs. Clinton?
look, I happen to think that she is a brilliant woman, and brave, too.
she took all that sniper fire for us, she and Sinbad.
why do you feel compelled to vote for Obama? We need a new America. Hillary Clinton is old America.
I think the time has come for us to bridge the gaps on the senate floor.
Yes, we can.
we're not just democrats and republicans.
we're Americans. Yes, we can.
it's time for all people to come together-- black, white, yellow, red.
Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.
Oh, all right.
you sound like the little engine that could.
how great that you have an opinion.
do you think it's fair, though, for you to exalt your politics over the will of your district?
I have a dream where people of all creeds and yes, what if all the delegates had a dream that it should be Kucinich in July?
that would be okay, then, within the rules?
let me ask, how did you even get to be a delegate?
I did a lot of volunteer work.
I was rewarded for my efforts and made a national committee man.
and how old are you?
I'm 22.
Mitchy, have you ever actually spoken to Hillary Clinton?
Yes, she and Barack both dropped by.
dropped by your house? - Yes.
isn't democracy swell?
objection. - Sustained.
do you think it's possible that your conscience has been corrupted？
no, I do not!
you listen to me.
I am proud to be a member of the democratic party.
I take my cues from the chairman of the democratic national committee.
and he says that I can vote my conscience.
I will follow his lead, not yours.
that of the chairman of the democratic national committee? - Yes.
and that would be, uh, this guy?
and we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan, and then we're going to Washington D.C. to take back the White House!
he is a beacon.
I've tracked the safety of cloned meat and milk in past 6 years.
and it's not only safe, but very likely more safe than products from naturally bred livestock.
it is also of much higher quality.
how so?
well, some cows are simply better than others.
we clone the top breeders, the prize winners, in fact, which gives us a consistently higher grade.
what's the problem with labeling it then?
honestly? - That'd be nice.
the yuck factor.
people hate the idea of cloning.
if we were to label cloned food products, we'd never be given a fair chance by the American public.
so better to deny the people a choice, like you did with vioxx?
Oh, god. I'm sick of everybody throwing vioxx in our faces.
well, yes.
it's just those vocal few opposed to heart attacks and strokes.
how about bextra?
Oh, bextra got bias, I admit, but zelnorm, baycol, palladone, tysabri, neutrospec, cylert, permax, all those drugs were approved by the F.D.A.
only to be withdrawn after they caused serious, sometimes fatal side effects.
which particular failure would you prefer having thrown in your face?
special orders don't upset me.
he's good.
may I say something?
who are you?
left-wing liberals love to dump on the F.D.A.
it seems to be the new sport.
but the public knows damn well, we are a thoroughly competent organization that serves Americans.
this would be a different public than the one polled by the wall street journal,which found that 70% of American adults are skeptical of the F.D.A.'s ability to protect them.
we're to trust polls now?
you prefer testimonials.
I would call your attention to a "60 minutes" interview with Dr. David Graham, a senior scientist at the F.D.A., who blamed the F.D.A. for allowing dangerous drugs to stay on the market.
this case is about cloning.
which has been deemed safe by a horrendously and famously inept governmental administration which shamelessly bends to the will of the pharmaceutical companies.
move to strike.
if there is nothing to hide here, why not label?
move to strike. - Silence.
I can't keep up.
the democratic party is a private organization.
we can adopt whatever run rules we want.
nobody is required to be a member of any party.
Mr. Duprey, don't feed me that.
there are only two real parties in our country.
they've picked our presidents for a hundred years.
and it's worked well for a hundred years.
Really? Even lately?
Oh, sit down, you.
these rules are designed to provide a checks and balances, if you will.
what if the public, in some protest of sorts, voted for a comedian?
you remember that Pat Paulsen ran in 1968.
what if Roseanne Barr or George Carlin or Carrot Top captured the popular vote?
could be an improvement, certainly over... - down!
the delegates and superdelegates, as a matter of conscience, have to be allowed to say, "Whoa!"
Oh, so you admit it's not really a democracy then?
classically speaking, no.
I mean, suppose we were in the same situation as the republicans, for example, and suppose John Mccain, before the convention, succumbed to old age or senility.
you mean he hasn't?
should we stick in Mike Huckabee because he would be the leader in delegates?
can you imagine?
the rules that we have in place are to effect a choice from the people to be affirmed or not by the delegates and superdelegates, and it is not automatic.
well, then what's the point of the primaries really?
is it just a guide?
if the delegates are free to ignore the popular vote, then does that not violate one man, one vote?
well, it's never truly been one man, one vote in this country.
let's face it.
look, I grew up in California, my wife in Wyoming.
now in my home state, there are about 15 million registered voters.
in my wife's, maybe 250, 000.
both states have two senators, which means my wife had about 60 times more voting power than I did in any senatorial election.
is that fair? I think so. Perfect? Of course not.
democracy isn't, nor is the democratic nomination process.
nobody here is denying that.
but let's remember, if it wasn't for delegate independence, it's possibility of backroom deal making.
the nominee for president in 1932 for the democratic party would've been Newton Baker.
instead, we got Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
my mother's, uh, friend Vivian, uh, once told me, "there are only two kinds of people in this world, Alan, them that drink coke and them that drink pepsi."
Vivian got that notion, of course, from coke and pepsi.
there may have been other colas, but coke and pepsi were the giants.
billion-dollar behemoths, who, in their own advertising, would each refer to the other guy as the only alternative.
just so long as people keep on gulping down one or the other.
make you kind of wonder if they're in cahoots.
Mr. Shore, as much as I enjoy listening to you go on and on and on, could you get to your case?
when it comes to presidential elections, we again have only two billion-dollar giants in control.
the American people might get to vote for commander in chief, but they only get two choices, your honor, choices selected by two very private organizations, who are both are in bed with big oil, big tobacco, big pharmaceuticals, big banking... Every big you can think of.
and as a result, we only get the candidates that big business and the two parts decide to favor us with.
so where's the democracy?
the sad fact is, it seems that democracy has lost its way, and as long as we remain a two-party system, we'll forever be denied a taste of that delicious R.C.Cola because coke and pepsi have cornered the market.
no more soda pop.
Yes, let's let the democratic national committee make whatever rules it fancies, never mind that delegates like Mitchy can ignore election results.
who cares that states like Florida and Michigan are discounted?
big deal that in Iowa, the democrats don't get to cast secret ballots, or that in Nevada, the caucuses were on a saturday, which meant observant jews couldn't vote.
Hey, it's kind of fun.
this year, the democratic nominee might be decided by super-duper delegates,
political insiders who don't have to listen to the voters at all, insiders who, according to D.N.C. rules, are allowed to and do accept money from the candidates, insiders who, in fact, have accepted over a million dollars from the Clinton and Obama campaigns.
do we have to sit here and listen to this wonkish analysis?
there are dire consequences here, Mr. Duprey.
presidents get to start wars, and kids, the innocent kind, die in them--lots of kids. There are consequences, and as long as presidents get to start wars and pick supreme court justices, as long as they represent the american people to the world,
a world which increasingly loathes us because of our presidents.
we the people should get to weigh in.
look at the choices this grand two-party system has produced this year,
a grumpy old man who wants to stay at war for a hundred years versus whomever the democrats pick, a choice which may very well come down to Mitchy.
snidey-butt.
I'm going to sit my snidey-butt down now after one final thought.
maybe it's time for us to take a little break from Iraq anstart spreading a little more democracy at home.
so what happens now?
well, we have a drink, maybe a little sex.
although, it's only been a day, and I'm still in refractory mode.
no, I mean about the case.
Oh, uh, well, uh...
sack will give his summation tomorrow.
it'll be boring, full of legal stuff I never listen to.
the judge will rule, and then we'll, uh, marry.
you're even a good kisser.
you've been regarding my flirtations as, uh, foreplay. It's more than that.
when a man loves a woman, when god didn't pick little green apples...
whatever.
Oh, denny.
well, you get the idea.
sunny Fields, will you marry me?
Oh, Denny.
we haven't even been out on a real date.
Oh, we got plenty of time for that.
Denny, I love you.
I'd go to the ends of the earth for you.
well, you sure make it hard to say no to, I can tell you that.
can I think about it overnight?
you can.
and I'll see you tomorrow?
I promise.
good night, Denny Crane.
I agree with Mr. Shore.
whatever one wants to call this nomination process, it's anything but democratic.
two political parties pulling the strings...
it's like going to a fast-food restaurant and being told you can eat whatever you want.
the menu is fixed.
that having been said, being a private organization, the D.N.C. is free to set its own rules.
the only real recourse the people have, I suppose, is to vote republican.
and everyone wonders how we ended up with the likes of George Bush?
motion denied.
everybody loses.
Oh, well.
the one time I get out of my tastefully decorated office to tilt at windmills, and I lose.
I'm sorry.
first of all, I reject the idea that cloning meat is abusive to cows.
Why?
it's meat. The animal's already dead.
no, your honor, it's the cow being cloned to make the meat.
did I skip over that?
dead meat is dead meat. - But...
judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
Oh, there you go.
what? Judge, we had the same concerns over artificial insemination and all the perceived horrors, and nothing bad happened.
judgment for the defendant. - What?
no. No, no, no. Technology has not improved the food supply.
plaintiff's motion granted.
wait. You said the defendant's. - Sustained.
this guy's worse than me.
I am the decider.
adjourned.
who won? - I have no idea.
so you have no idea if you won or lost? - No.
I still got the girl, though.
when do I get to meet her?
well, she's due any second, Alan.
I popped the question.
you did what?
I love her.
you asked her to marry you?
life is short.
no, Denny, life can be very long, especially when you're bound by law to the wrong woman. You can't.
she's the right woman.
you just met her. - I have a feeling.
Yes, the same one you have about Bev and five other right women who turned out to be total disasters.
knock-knock.
can't. Still in refractory.
you must be Sunny?
Oh, my Sunny.
this is Alan Shore. He was just leaving.
howdy, Alan. - Howdy.
well, we'll well talk later.
I really think we should talk... - No, no, no, later.
have we figured out whether we won our case yet?
not yet.
so did I win the girl?
Denny, were you serious when you said you'd go to the ends of the earth for me?
I was.
how about Montana? - What?
I'm moving to Montana in a month.
I would've told you sooner, but things we going so fast between us.
Montana?
I bought a farm there, 6, 000 acres of land.
I'm gonna move my ranch there and really make a go of it.
Montana? - So the question becomes
are you really that much of a cowboy, Denny Crane?
what?
well, uh, my life is here.
well, one day you will have to go to pasture.
maybe now's the time.
ride into the sunset with me, Denny Crane.
see, if it's, um, it's not the job. It's someone else.
someone else?
uh, my best friend. You that was him you just met.
are you serious?
see, um...
we meet every night for, uh, cigars and a scotch.
it's a standing.
why don't you stay here?
I just bought a business.
I have to go.
if you'd rather stay and drink scotch and smoke cigars, well, maybe that tells us something.
this has no bearing on my love for you.
it's just your love for him.
I can't go to Montana.
just like that, it's over?
she turned me down. What can I do?
I'm sorry, Denny.
no, you're not. You're relieved.
well, that, too, but...
if you truly loved her, then I am sorry.
there's no need to be sorry, Alan.
love, even when it's fleeting, even if it's for a day or two, it's...
it's everything.
don't you agree?
I do.
I actually think it's why I'm still single.
every morning, I get to wake up and wonder, will this be the day?
every night, I put my head on my pillow and I wonder, will I meet her tomorrow?
I imagine what she'll look like,
her smile, the way she does her hair, how she laughs,
the contour of her breasts, neck.
the promise of love can be everything.
it's a magic you rarely find in marriage, so maybe you lucked out.
you don't believe married people can stay in love?
I believe they can know even more profound joys, be it with children or the depth of the relationship itself.
it can evolve into something they can't possibly live without.
and yet, it's something that doesn't quite so resemble love, at least not the romance of love.
I never knew you to be such a romantic.
my problem is I'm too romantic.
no woman can possibly measure up to the promise of tomorrow that love holds for me.
what about me?
well, it's not the same.
you know one thing I do love about you?
tell me.
while many people embrace the promise of tomorrow, too few celebrate the joy of now.
and nobody does that like denny crane.
well, let me tell you something, when you've got polar ice caps melting and breaking off into big chunks, and you got osama still hiding in a cave planning his next attack, and when you got other rogue nations with nuclear arsenals, not to mention me whack job, homegrown, who can cancel you at any second, and when you got mad cow,
now gets high priority.
and when you're sitting on the balcony on a clear night,
sipping scotch with your best friend,
now is everything.
here's to now.
here's to now.
I'll just have a drop of coffee.
please leave room for milk. - Okay, sure.
don't you want anything?
Oh, no, thank you. I've already had a coffee.
a cup is enough.
to be honest, I don't really give a crap about those interests.
if he can't get a loan, he will go to bankruptcy.
that investor has enough money.
let him go cry on the shoulder of his, trophy wife.
screw him.
Yeah.
it's a private conversation, snoopy, mrs. snoopy.
Yes, I'll have a 2% latte and a blueberry muffin, please.
so what do they want from me, Mike?
6 points?
Really? that's fair.
thank you.
Yeah, okay, then you're out of your minds.
Ooh! I apologize.
Oh, do you want to apologize?
why not look where you're going for? That might help.
how about you demonstrate a modicum of courtesy?
that's a nice accent.
what is that, French? - Poop-head.
come on, Jerry.
sorry. Some memento and his nurse.
winds up for the pitch...
sorry.
Yes!
Yes!
don't you like it?
well, I'm not saying it's a bad look, but Gerry Once dresses like this all the time, and he wins almost all his cases.
so do you.
Gerry Spence is a country lawyer.
he tries his cases in Wyoming.
are those guns load? Yes.
paintball.
Denny, it's good to have a Gerry Spence, but we certainly don't need two.
Plus, we need Denny Crane.
Mr. Shore?
Yes.
my name is Wanshu Jin.
I need a lawyer.
let me guess.
they want to take back your gold medal, but you really are 16.
I don't have a gold medal, and I'm only 15.
how can I help you, Ms. Shu?
I'm pregnant.
I can't have an abortion without parental consent.
my father's dead.
my mother won't give it to me.
I need something called a" judicial bypass," and for that, I need a lawyer.
well-- uh, hold on.
Alan, I don't talk about this much, but I'm an icon.
Yes, you and Gerry Spence both are.
and icons, well...
I like to pretend that everything I say and do is on television for the whole world to see.
it's just a little game I play with myself.
And?
and who's gonna watch a show about abortion?
it's not fun.
well, denny, you and i could make it fun.
I don't think so.
try to look at it as a challenge.
consider it your Emmy episode.
well, yeah, but then there's the other thing.
what is it?
well, look at her, Alan-- a sweet, cute little kid.
if we help her get an abortion, she's gonna burn in hell forever and ever.
we'll represent you.
I can hear them changing the channel.
what are you looking at?
Hey, don't start with me, mack.
I just stunned a person, there are two things you need to know.
it was fun, and the day's just getting to start.
I've posted bond.
arraignment's in half an hour.
let's go.
is there a particular reason your mother opposes the abortion?
Oh, please.
besides it not being fun.
she just doesn't believe in abortion.
she's very pro-life.
when I was a kid, we'd just go down to Mexico.
God doesn't care what happens in Mexico since it's already a kind of pre-hell, which is why they wanna come up here illegally.
what?
okay.
obviously, it's in our best interest to get just the right judge.
what about the baby's best interest?
does that matter?
don't shove me!
you listen to me right now.
if you're gonna spew your politics all over this, i..
politics? a baby's politics?
Denny, I respect your position on this issue.
you need to respect the party. - No, I don't. She's a kid.
nevertheless, she has the right to choose-- - The right?
how about her responsibility?
Look--How about the baby's right?
the fetus doesn't have any legal-- - "fetus."
can such a name indicate that it is not human?
does that make it easier like calling it a procedure instead of an abortion, or what really is it?
Mr. Crane.
no disrespect.
but you're fired.
I told you it wouldn't be fun.
he beat a man up?
him?
what surprises?
I beat a person up.
your honor, it was an altercation.
two people were fighting.
after he committed the initiating assault, he threw a muffin.
he provoked the fight and broke a man's nose.
many witnesses have saw it.
him?
it's an aggravated assault, judge.
with baked goods? - With a fist.
it's what he said, judge.
a 1-day case.
let's just get it over with.
we can't be serious.
it' s simply a dispute.
the defense stands ready for trial.
make my day. - Jerry.
I want my day in court.
fine.
10: 00 tomorrow.
adjourned.
what are you doing?
and I'm representing myself.
don't be ridiculous. - I am.
you can second chair if you want, but I'm defending myself.
it's what I did in that coffee shop, and it's what I'll do here.
for you.
what's this?
subpoena.
you're a witness for the prosecion.
judge Peyton?
do you know where she stands on abortion?
she's a woman.
Alan, many women are pro-life.
this doesn't split along gender lines.
she should be a good judge for this.
why do you need me? it seems because i want a woman at the table i don't know if i'm your woman.
Mr. Shore?
Yes.
my name is Wanshu Ming.
I believe you're representing my daughter.
I am.
please.
this is Shirley Schmidt.
hello. - Hello.
if i may...
I would ask you to respect that this is a family matter.
I do respect that, Mrs. Shu.
but liket or not, at your daughter's instigation, this has now become a legal matter as well.
she's a child.
legally...
your daughter has a right to ternate this pregnancy.
this requires parental advice, and I don't agree.
or she can do it by getting legal aid.
they are almost always granted.
have you ever had a child of yours terminated, Mr. Shore?
I suspect if you have, particularly if you participated in that decision.
miss Shu, this is not my business.
and I must respectfully say, it's not your business.
she's my daughter.
I know her and you not.
and I know that if she makes this decision, she'll never forgive herself.
you need to defer to her mother on this.
you mind getting down?
certainly.
Katie told me all.
it seems that you got a little emotional.
you know, conviction for aggravated assault is more than just an inconvenience, jerry.
it could affect your bar status.
you also run the risk of serving time.
Jerry, look at me.
let me defend you.
no.
first, he collides with me in line.
I'm not sure it wasn't intentional.
then he throws out some hollow apology, you know, like..."sorry."
then while i'm ordering my coffee, i get hit with a muffin right in my face.
I approach him to say, "What's up with that?"
and he hauls off and slugs me, knocks me out.
do you really believe i collided with you on purse, sir?
Hey, I wouldn't know.
you're clearly a vicious person.
move to strike.
Oh, sorry.
you stepped into that.
did you not refer to me as a demento?
no, I did not.
liar.
see? He was making funny sounds at me like that.
you didn't say to the person you were speaking to on the phone that i was a demento out with my nurse?
no, i did not. - liar!
Mr. Espenson!
did you not come to attack me after i threw the muffin?
I was angry, but I wasn't going to attack you.
liar, liar.
Hey, you can try and make me out to be the bad guy, but, uh, I am not violent, I've never been arrested like you have.
I am a law-abiding person who was simply looki to buy a cup of coffee.
and look at me now?
my nose is broken.
you all set?
kim is waiting by the elevator.
OK.
what's wrong?
Alan, this--this does feel like a family matter.
Shirley, you realize massachusetts has one of the more restrictive policies on abortion.
in this state, girls need attorneys more.
is the case for you all right?
well-- - is that how it works?
as soon as a client walks in, you start preparing your closing argument?
that's not fair.
fair?
you've never been a parent.
I am one.
and an attorney running interference with a parental-child relationship hardly feels fair.
if it were my daughter, and the lawyer...I'd want to throttle him.
and i can also tell you from personal experience, anyone who has an abortion-never get over it.
trust me.
regardless of how to endorse the legalization of abortion...
are you saying that undage girls should be forced to carry a baby to term if the parent so orders, Mrs. Schmidt?
no, I'm not saying that.
well, then perhaps all you can really do here is advise of my legal rights and represent those rights in court.
Kim, any decision you make here will follow you forever.
I came to this country three years ago for two reasons.
Stay.with my mother and to become a citizen in a country that prioritizes individual freedoms.
my understanding is that attorneys are in the business of safeguarding those freedoms.
Mr. hellman was carrying on a rather loud and abrasive conversation on his cell phone.
we turned to look at him while in line, and he then assaulted us verbally, referring to us as Mr. and Mrs. Snoopy, I believe.
then what happened?
then after Jerry placed his order, he turned and inadvertently collided with Mr. Hellman.
and Mr. hellman reacted in a threatening and discourteous manner.
then，Jerry has some verbal ticks.
Mr. Hellman proceeded to ridicule him for that.
as we were heading off, he did refer to Jerry as a demento.
are you a close friend of Mr. Espenson?
I am.
in fact, you're testifying today only under subpoena.
that's correct.
but you appreciate your obligation to tell the truth.
I do.
what happened next, Ms. Loyd?
well, we proceeded to go and wait for Jerry's order.
he was becoming increasingly upset over Mr. Hellman's discourteous remarks.
and then he tossed a blueberry muffin at him.
tossed it or threw it?
threw it.
threw it quite hard.
it was only a muffin.
and then what happened?
Mr. Hellman charged at Jerry.
both appeared to throw punches simultaneously.
Jerry's fist arrived first.
Mr. Hellman was rendered unconscious.
and then what?
uh, that's pretty much it. - Really?
what did Mr. Espenson do after he knocked Mr. Heman out?
did he go to his aid?
no.
what did he do?
he danced.
he danced?
Yes.
what kind of dance?
it was...
celebratory.
did he yell anything?
he yelled, "yes! yes!"
anything else?
he inquired as to whether there were any other takers.
does it mean that anyone else wants to do one with him?
I suppose.
anything else?
he sang.
he seemed to enjoy the whole thing?
he did.
I hardly think she was deliberately trying getting you convicted.
Yes, she was. I heard it.
Jerry, you never should've represented yourself.
I mean, you never should've thrown a muffin.
fine. Take her side.
I'm not taking her side. I'm just saying-- - why am I not surprised?
Yes, you are! - Stop yelling at me.
Hey!
he's losing?
it seems so.
Alan, if you don't mind, I'm going to withdraw from this case.
I do mind.
Why?
I'm not comfortable arguing...
I--I'm going to just pass on this case.
Shirley, you suddenly quit, how does the judge think?
we haven't even gone to court yet. - I need a woman at the table.
get another one. - I just want you...
you don't have to-- - Your credibility...
what's your problem, Shirley?
I told you my problem. I'm not comfortable.
are you comfortable with the government legislating abortion?
check that--Abolish it？
that's the next step.
Oh, please.
the Supreme Court has already voted on this law.
Stevens has been 88 years old already.
once he passes by...
this is not concerned with politics, Alan. - Of course it is.
when-- No, it is not.
when did you have your last abortion?
don't dare to slap on me or anyone else unless you have experienced it yourself!
I know what goes with it!
obviously I haven't experienced the physical part, but I know the overwhelming emotion that goes with it.
I know the sense of loss, the doubt, the guilt, all feelings.
so please don't...
Shirley, did it ever occur to you that one of the reasons I wanted you on this case is precisely because...
maybe we should both get out.
no, we shouldn't.
we're lawyers here first.
W young girl has come to us for help to fight for a legal right that we both happen to believe in.
Shirley, we separate ourselves from our emotions all the time.
it's our job.
it's what we have to do here.
what?
how's the case going?
surprising difficult, you'll be happy to know.
something happened.
what do you mean?
I mean the situation is coming, Denny.
I can just feel Roe vs. Wade being chipped away at this parental consent law, the judicial bypass hoops.
the wall is coming down. I can feel it.
uh, may I say something, between friends?
you pro-choice people...
you need Roe vs. Wade.
you're desperate for it, not because you're sure of your opinion, but because you're not.
you need to cling to that ruling as moral validation for a position you're not entirely comfortable with the position that you really want to face in your heart.
I don't know exactly what he plans to do, but it's not going well at all.
does he plan to testify?
he has to, otherwise...
why don't you throw me under the bus?
and then back up over me.
I did not throw you under wheels.
Oh, you certainly did.
Ow. hey!
he asked me questions, I have sworn.
so what should I do now?
thanks a lot.
OK, my partner.
Hey!
what did I do?
Ow!
how dare you attack me like that?
how dare you?
I thought we were friends.
should I do perjury?
you didn't have to relish it.
I did not relish it. - Yes, you did.
there is something in your words, Katie.
you have been throwing out judgment from the start, instead of having my back or surpporting.
Jerry, you went bonkers!
you launched a muffin, knocked a man unconscious, provoked everyone in the store, and then you dance to yourself.
it was grotesque.
if anything, I've underplayed my dismay.
and by the way, what if you hadn't stumbled him?
maybe the countryman will go to me.
you might've put me in danger.
can't you take some responsibility?
how about an apology?
poop-head!
poop-head yourself!
let me tell you.
if you can't stand the stimulating point...
I don't think there is anything to bear with the stimulus.
and do not ever call me "hot cakes."
here's my problem.
on the one hand, you're telling me she just had an impulsive lapser of judgment fo months ago, and yet, you are maintaining that she has the maturity to make one of the most important and far-reaching decisions that any person could be called upon.
your honor, this is abortion. Let's not coax ourselves.
even if we assume that you know her better than her mother, it will have an impact on her future life.
I'm considering the impact of a teenager having to raise a child.
she doesn't have to raise it.
the law gives her the right to terminate this pregnancy.
no, only with parental consent, which she does not have.
however, the aid...
come on.
let's at least wait till the supreme court repudiates Roe vs Wade.
why rob them of all their fun?
Mr. Shore...
your honor, this bypass requirement is unreasonable, perhaps even unconstitutional, as is the requirement of parental consent.
the reality is, most kids won't tell their parents.
many kids will resort to unsafe methods.
some just secretly have the child.
Mr. Shore,
if we're really going to exalt human life here, it should be pointed out that death associated with childbirth is ten times as high as that associated with abortion.
that's mother, you say.
the death rate of the unborn child is 100%.
a fetus is not-- - Hey, hey.
I don't listen to this.
as you say, Mr. Shore, let us not step on the supreme court's moment.
all I care about is whether Kim is mature enough and what is best for her.
may I be heard on that, your honor?
please.
this is a young lady who is in love with a boy one day, and then forget him.
last week, she was going to be a marine biologist, and as of this morning, she planned to invent software games.
she's only at the beginning of discovering who she is, like any teenager...
but that process could be nipped in the bud if she becomes a teenage mother.
I know the values she was raised with.
I know her values.
and I feel that she will evolve to be a person who is very much pro-life, and this decision might emotionally devastate her.
you do not know her.
I do.
may I respond, your honor?
okay.
I know I'm just a kid.
I had unprotected sex.
what better example is there of immaturity or recklessness?
but I also know my family is poor.
I will likely have to go on welfare like nearly 80% of teen mothers are forced to do.
I will not be able to continue my education.
I will not be able to provide for my child, give her a good education.
I know the conditions are bad for me.
I also knew that if I gave birth to her, it would be bad for the child.
and I believe terminating this pregnancy is in my best interest.
this is very difficult.
you do strike me as a conscientious and mature young woman.
and yet, I find the mothers of 15 year olds typically know those 15 year olds better than those children know themselves.
I'm gonna take time to think about this.
we will adjourn until 2: 00.
mom, please.
you need to listen to me, not Jim.
Mrs. Shu, as odd as the sounds, I'll ask you not to talk about this to my client.
why don't you talk to her, Mr. Shore?
do you think you know what's going on?
you have no idea.
my suggestion would be to let Carl step in.
let him mitigate some of the damage.
it's a little too late.
he could certainly help you with your testimony.
I'm gonna testify in the narrative.
it'll also be my closing case.
think I can be more compelling that way.
more convincing?
that would suggest you've been the least bit compelling so far, but you haven't.
I don't mean to come in here driving a bus.
you know i'm on your side.
if you want to save yourself from sin, you can't just stand up and say that the man asked for it.
there are disagreements, disputes, altercations every day.
adults have a way of dealing with adults.
they do not throw cakes, they do not wave their fist, and they certainly will not dance to victory for their fallen opponent.
I think you should find out the root of your behavior and let the jury want to forgive you for this very unforgivable behavior.
it's not that I don't think it's her right.
I do.
and god knows she seems smart enough to make the decision...
But?
but as someone who's exercised that right...
this girl just strikes me as too struggle-free.
did you say she was raised in China?
until three years ago, what's up?
and the baby is female?
don't be ridiculous.
Shirley, female infanticide in china has been going on for a thousand years.
well, in China, yes, but...
also here.
I don't believe it.
in the united states?
I can show you the studies.
since China's "one child per family" policy was introduced in 1980, sex selection spiked.
they want boys.
Ultrasounds?
it's not a good thing for female Chinese babies.
he started the altercation by throwing the muffin.
he ended it with a vicious punch, shattering the victim's nose, knocking him unconscious.
and instead of showing any concern or contrition, he danced, did a little jig, sang a song and said to the bystanders, "Who's next?
violent, unrepentant, criminal...
that's the only way to describe the conduct of the defendant.
the legal definition would be aggravated assault.
I have various emotional deficits, some of which are consistent with asperger's syndrome, others simply reflective of my lack of social development.
even in my late 40s, I am often childlike.
all my life, I have been picked on for being...weird.
about being bullied...
it stays with you.
I...I certainly don't mean I think about it every day, but it's there.
and when I picked on now, today, as I was by Mr. Hellman, it wasn't just his actions that were causing me to boil up and react, but the actions of many over many, many years, because...
it never goes away.
most victims...
cower, run away.
I always did.
I probably would've here except this time, the abuse happened in front of somebody i'm...
well...
so I threw a muffin.
a small sture, but for me...
then suddenly Mr. Hellman came charging, and I had to defend myself.
something I had never done, something I thought myself incapable of doing.
I squeezed my palm tightly into a fist and then punched.
it's a wonder I hit him-- I had my eyes closed.
and by some miracle, the bully went down.
for the first time in my picked-on, ridiculed, taunted, laughed-at life...
I had stood up for myself.
and it was joyous.
it was a feeling that...
Yes, I sang and I danced and I challenged everybody else, quickly, before they tumbled to the truth that I was afraid.
I, um...
I certainly regret the celebrating.
I wish I could take that back.
but I will never take back that punch.
it was a punch that had been coming for over 40 years.
Shirley, we're due back.
come in for a second.
sit down, Kim.
your mother told Alan in court that he had no idea what was really going on here.
what did she mean by that?
I don't know.
she was probably just being a little irrational.
mothers are like that.
she didn't strike me that way.
why are you having this abortion, kim?
I think I've been clear on that.
clear?
Yes.
is it truthful? I wonder.
Shirley, what's going on?
you refer to the baby as "she." Is it a girl?
I don't know.
I was just saying "she" instead of "he" or "it."
does it matter?
tell me.
Shirley, unless it's a monday crossword, I'm lousy at puzzles.
kim's culture has a prerence for male offspring.
your mother did not tell us, but at least she didn't tell us directly.
you're aborting this baby because it's a girl, aren't you, Kim?
I'm asking you a question.
the reason I want to terminate this pregnancy has no legal relevance.
I suspect if the clinic learns that this is about sex selection, that they'll...
not for this reason.
I'm a teenager. I'm simply unfit to be a mother.
my personal reasons are none of your business.
we're gonna be late.
Mrs. Shu, admittedly, I cannot possibly know your daughter as well as you do.
but as I said, I cant help but be impressed by her apparent clarity on this.
and as a judge, as a woman, I simply cannot impose upon her the duty to carry through.
your honor-- - Shirley.
in addition to being Kim's advocate, I'm also...
well, a woman.
thank you, Ms. Schmidt.
I suspected, but one can never be too sure.
it is my opinion that my client seeks to terminate this pregnancy because the child she is carrying is female.
that isn't true.
is it true, Mrs. Shu?
as a matter of public policy...
this is not your call.
the abortion laws were intended to liberate women, eradicate them.
ms. Schmidt, I think you're out of line.
your honor, sex selection, at least for this purpose, it should shock the sensibility of this court.
this woman is fired as my attorney.
Kim, I'm going to say something that perhaps only a mother should get to say.
sit down and be quiet.
in India, almost half a million female fetuses are aborted every year because...
the gender is considered inferior.
in china, it's become epidemic, and according to our own census polls, u. s.-born children of chinese parents tend to be male.
it's female infanticide.
it is sexism. It is vile, and I am not going to be part of it. I...
I'm not going to stay silent while we let the abortion license be exploited to accomplish the holocaust of women.
if that gets me disbarred for betraying a client or revealing a privilege...
so be it.
and what do you propose we do, Ms. Schmidt?
that we add to our current abortion law the right of the government to investigate why a woman chooses to terminate her pregnancy?
do you really want to solve the problem in that direction?
subject pregnant teens to interrogation and discovery?
I admire your moral instinct here.
but it is logistically unenforceable.
I am convinced that the minor is mature enough to make the decision, and the bypass is granted.
unbelievable.
at sounds promising. - Not necessarily.
alan told me he was bullied as a kid.
the judge?
by his mother.
Mr. Espenson, please rise.
Mr. Foreman, the jury has reached a unanimous verdict?
we have, your honor.
what is it?
in the matter of "the commonwealth vs. Jerry Espenson "on the charge of aggravated assault,
we the jury find the defendant Jerry Espenson...
not guilty.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service.
adjourned.
Wow.
well, a little dance would certainly be in order now.
I think I'll pass on that.
thank you, Katie.
if I hadn't taken your littllecture to heart, I might not have closed that way.
thank you.
so how do I invite you to dinner to celebrate?
I accept it.
lesson to you, Bub.
tell a friend.
not necessary.
you did win.
did she have the procedure?
I don't know.
you know, denny...
I am very pro-choice.
I believe it's a woman's right.
but from a sentific and human perspective, it's hard to argue that life doesn't begin at conception...
even if it's only in organism form.
I suppose I am...
the desperate desire for Roy's decision continues to have legal effect.
in part, maybe to reaffirm my own moral position.
how many times have you experienced abortion surgery?
twice.
and they, um...
haunt you?
let's just say they weigh on me.
do you really think...
will Roy's verdict be overthrown?
I don't know.
you know, sarah palin talks about how proud she is of her teenager for choosing to have the baby, but the truth is, if sarah gets her way, her daughter won't have a choice at all.
if it comes before the supreme court, probably it's game over.
probably.
but they do purport to be tough on crime.
what does that have to do with that?
well, it's possible Roe v. Wade has brought our crime rates down.
how do you figure?
well, roe became law in the 1970s, and studies have shown that the typical child that went unborn after roe was more likely to have come from poor families, single parents
the very children most likely to grow up to become criminals.
after Roe became law, many of those children were being aborted.
the would be criminals of the 1990s weren't around because they were never born in the 1970s.
you're making all this up.
I'm not making it up.
there's a book-- Freakonomics.
read it.
you still don't reading?
just newspapers.
it's anti-American.
so legalized abortion might actually bring down the crime rate?
Wow.
does that make it easier for you to feel ease about your procedures?
no.
I HAVE AN 80% CHANCE OF GETTING ALZHEIMER'S?
have YOU BEEN FEELING OTHER SYMPTOMS LATELY?
sometimes I FEEL A LITTLE FOGGY.
I DON'T SEEM TO ALWAYS GET THINGS.
we ALL KNOW IT, WE LAUGH IT OFF,
we SAY, "ISN'T THE MAD COW CUTE?
at WHAT POINT DO WE ALL ADMIT THE MAN NEEDS HELP?
the FIRM IS GOING BROKE? -WE MAY HAVE TO SHUT OUR DOORS.
did I KNOW THIS AND FORGET?
you've BEEN ALMOST LIKE A BIG SISTER TO ME.
if YOU KNEW THIS CRAZY CATHERINE PIPER...
do YOU THINK THEY CONSIDERED ME SANE?
if ONLY THEY COULD KNOW YOU LIKE I DO.
Hello, DEAR.
may I HELP YOU?
Yeah, I'M LOOKING FOR A LAWYER.
uh, YES, I SUSPECTED AS MUCH.
you're IN A LAW FIRM.
uh, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, DEAR?
well, I, UH, I GOT INTO HARVARD, AND THEN
a PRETTY LITTLE THING LIKE YOU? OH, PLEASE.
who'd WE DO, SWEETHEART?
then THEY RESCINDED MY ADMISSION,
and NOW I WOULD LIKE TO SUE THEM.
of COURSE YOU WOULD.
um, KATIE, BE A DEAR AND HELP THIS YOUNG LADY.
uh, KATIE WILL HELP YOU, DEAR.
why DON'T WE GO TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM?
okey.
hello.
who ARE YOU?
uh, I'M CATHERINE, HONEY. D
who ARE YOU?
Carl SACK. MAY I HELP YOU?
I DOUBT IT. UH, YOU STRIKE ME AS PUSHY.
may I ASK,
and I THINK I MAY, BEING, UH, A SENIOR PARTNER,
just WH-WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WORK HERE, DEAR.
you WORK HERE?
Yes, DEAR. WHO HIRED YOU?
Shirley SCHMIDT DID, DEAR. SHE'S MY OLDER SISTER.
I THINK IF SHIRLEY SCHMIDT HAD HIRED YOU, -SHE WOULD'VE TOLD ME. -REALLY?
does SHE TELL YOU EVERYTHING?
did SHE TELL YOU SHE WENT TO CABO FOR THE WEEK?
she DID,
and SHE LEFT ME A CONTACT NUMBER...
if YOU CAN IMAGINE.
well, THAT'S LOVELY.
did SHE TELL YOU HER CALLS
were BEING FORWARDED TO HER YOUNGER SISTER?
hello. WHO'S CALLING, PLEASE?
is IT THE PUSHY MAN?
okay, DENNY, I WANT YOU TO COUNT BACKWARDS
by SEVENS FROM A HUNDRED.
Why?
it's just a test.
uh, 86.
4--4, I meant to say.
4. UH, 1984, like the Orwell
who THE HELL WROTE THAT?
no, no, you were down to 74 not 84.
W-WHATEVER.
continue, please.
hell OF YEAR--'67. THE SOX WON THE PENNANT.
Jimmy Lonborg pitched a 2-hitter second game, and Yaz plunked two out. Hell of a game.
who PITCHED THE FIRST GAME OF TT WORLD SERIES?
jose Santiago against, uh, Bob Gibson.
Gibson pitched, uh, three times, won the series.
who's THE BEST PITCHER FOR THE SOX THIS YEAR?
don't tell me. Uh... uh... Josh Pecker.
hell of a pitcher, Pecker.
who's the best hitter?
uh, THAT'S, UH, THAT BLACK GUY-- UH, THE, UM
he's half Black, half Mexican, half Dominican.
who's the president of the United States?
barack OBAMA.
he's half Hawaiian, half Kenyan half Black and half,
uh, HALLE BERRY.
it HAS PROGRESSED.
last YEAR, WE WERE AT STAGE,
which IS BASICALLY MILD COGNITIVE DECLINE.
now IT'S MORE LIKE STAGE 4, WHICH IS MODERATE.
talk TO ME LIKE I'M IN THE ROOM, WOULD YOU?
I AM.
you REMEMBER YESTERDAY VERY WELL,
but FORMING NEW MEMORIES IS OBVIOUSLY MORE DIFFICULT.
cut TO THE PUNCH LINE.
you're IN THE EARLY STAGES OF ALZHEIMER'S.
we're NOT TALKING ABOUT PRECURSOR'S ANYMORE.
it's HERE.
academic DOPING?
Yeah. YOU FIND A FRIEND WITH A PRESCRIPTION
for RITALIN OR ADDERALL,
and YOU POP SOME PILLS TO HELP STUDY AND STAY FOCUSED THE DAY OF THE S. A.T.
and YOU DID THIS? -YEAH. IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.
and HOW'D YOU DO ON THE S. A.T?
I GOT A PERFECT SCORE.
and I WAS ACCEPTED TO HARVARD...
which IS FAIRLY NEWSWORTHY
given I WENT TO YOUR AVERAGE SMALL-TOWN PUBLIC SCHOOL.
I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LOCAL PAPER...
where I WAS QUOTED AS SAYING
ritalin WAS A GODSEND WHEN IT CAME TO TEST TAKING.
and THAT SPARKED A WHOLE DEBATE IN THE COMMENTS SECTION
is IT ETHICAL, IS IT NOT
and THE BOSTON PAPERS PICKED IT UP,
and SUDDENLY I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONTROVERSY
that HARVARD WANTS NO PART OF,
so THEY RESCIND MY OFFER OF ADMISSION.
well, I BELIEVE TAKING A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
without A PRESCRIPTION ACTUALLY IS ILLEGAL.
no, IT'S A STUDY AID,
just ONE STEP ABOVE POTENT COFFEE.
so WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE US TO DO?
get ME REINSTATED AT HARVARD.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO DESERVE THIS.
I MEAN, THEY'RE SINGLING ME OUT,
and NOW NO SCHOOL WILL TAKE ME.
where ARE YOUR PARENTS WITH ALL THIS?
beyond DEVASTATED.
it WAS THEIR DREAM TO SEE THEIR LITTLE GIRL GO TO HARVARD.
I HAVE TO FIX THIS.
I SCREWED IT UP...
and I HAVE TO FIX THIS.
what ARE YOU DOING AT MY DESK?
Oh. OH. I-I WAS JUST STRAIGHTENING UP.
that's WHAT ASSISTANTS DO.
you're NOT MY ASSISTANT.
Yes, I AM, DEAR.
no, I HAVE AN AS-- WHERE IS SHE?
Oh, FRANCINE? -MM.
I FIRED HER. -YOU
too PRETTY, TOO YOUNG-- SHE'S A DISTRACTION.
all RIGHT, I'M CALLING SECURITY.
look, HONEY, YOU SURE YOU WANT TO MAKE TROUBLE
for SHIRLEY'S SISTER?
I MEAN, AFTER ALL-- -YOUR NAME IS CATHERINE PIPER.
you WERE FIRED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BEING PSYCHOTIC.
I ALSO HAVE CANCER, DEAR.
there. IT'S OUT.
I AM DESPERATE FOR A DISTRACTION,
anything TO OCCUPY MYSELF WHILE...
I'm SORRY. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO INDULGE...
you HAVE CANCER?
not REALLY, BUT I COULD GET SOME IF YOU'D LIKE.
Oh, 9-1-1.
look, IF I COULD JUST WORK HERE ON A TEMPORARY
Oh, SORRY.
what's THE EMERGENCY?
how DID...
I'm AFRAID THEY SAID NO.
but...
did YOU POINT OUT
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY VIOLATE ANY POLICY OR
they're CITING HONESTY, MORAL CHARACTER.
uh, EVERYBODY'S DOING IT.
I REALIZE THAT, BUT-- -BUT YOU WENT PUBLIC, MARGIE.
we CAN TAKE IT TO COURT,
but I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
Oh, WE--WE HAVE TO TRY.
I HAVE GEARED MY WHOLE LIFE TOWARD GOING TO HARVARD.
I JUST...
I NEED TO TRY.
please.
I DON'T KNOW, JERRY.
you SAY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PRESCRIPTION.
all THE KIDS ARE DOING THIS, ALAN
Geing IT WITHOUT PRESCRIPTIONS.
well, THAT'S NOT MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT.
you COULD ARGUE THAT RESCINDING HER ADMISSION IS ARBITRARY
since THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL POLICY.
Oh, ALAN. UM, HEY, JERRY.
Alan, THERE'S A DRUG
it's CALLED, UH, DIMEBOLIN, SOMETHING LIKE THAT
and I WANT IT. MY DOCTOR WON'T GIVE IT TO ME.
it's FROM RUSSIA. IT STEMS OFF ALZHEIMER'S.
Denny, SLOW DOWN. I CAN'T AT THE MOMENT.
I've TAKEN A LITTLE TOO MUCH ADDERALL.
Adderall?
see? THAT'S WHAT MARGIE TAKES, THAT AND RITALIN.
Ritalin. I LOVE RITALIN.
Denny, WHAT DID WE AGREE ON REGARDING YOUR MEDICINES?
I WOULD BE IN CHARGE.
Yeah, YEAH, YEAH, BUT I'M THE ONE WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S.
I'll TAKE WHAT I WANT, AND RIGHT NOW, I WANT DIMEBOLIN.
and YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME GET IT.
you OKAY, JERRY?
academic DOPING...
it HAS SUCH A STIGMA TO IT.
what ABOUT EMOTIONAL DOPING?
what DO YOU MEAN?
that's WHAT I DO-- EMOTIONAL DOPING.
I TAKE MY LITTLE HELPERS TO...
do YOU THINK IT REFLECTS POORLY
on MY MORAL CHARACTER?
no.
what's THE DIFFERENCE?
well, YOUR MEDICATION IS PRESCRIBED FOR ONE THING.
mostly.
and SECOND, YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC, DIAGNOSED CONDITION, JERRY
asperger's SYNDROME.
three YEARS AGO, YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE EYE CONTACT.
I TAKE PILLS THAT AFFECT MY BRAIN
to HELP ME PERFORM BETTER.
Jerry, I'M THE FIRST ONE TO SAY
we HAVE AN OVERMEDICATED SOCIETY.
we've GOT 3 YEAR OLDS ON ANTIPSYCHOTICS.
people WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE HIGH CHOLESTEROL TAKE STATINS.
people TAKE SLEEP AIDS WHEN MAYBE THEY SHOULD JUST
read A BOOK OR MASTURBATE.
I-it's OUT OF CONTROL.
but THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT MANY DRUGS DON'T DO A LOT OF GOOD.
they SAVE LIVES.
people NEED DRUGS LIKE INSULIN OR BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE
to SIMPLY MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH.
and DRUGS HELP SOME PEOPLE TO LIVE NORMAL, PRODUCTIVE LIVES
who MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT.
you FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.
popping PILLS TO...
get BETTER S. A.T. SCORES
that's... SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
you ARE NOT WORKING HERE, CATHERINE.
that MUCH HAS BEEN DECIDED.
well, THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING IN YOUR OFFICE,
behind CLOSED DOORS...
where YOU COULD SEXUALLY RAVAGE ME
with NO WITNESSES TO SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN?
we're HERE BECAUSE I'M TOLD YOU'RE A FRIEND OF ALAN'S.
and AS A COURTESY TO HIM AND YOU,
I THOUGHT I WOULD AT LEAST GIVE YOU
an OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.
I'm DOING IT BECAUSE I'M OLD
and I'M BORED.
all MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD.
it's NOT LIKE I COULD GO SKIING
or--or MOUNTAIN CLIMBING OR...
honestly, A-ASSUMING I WERE QUALIFIED TO BE YOUR ASSISTANT,
uh, WOULD YOU EMPLOY SOMEBODY MY AGE?
probably NOT.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
I GOT THAT ON TAPE, DEAR.
now I CAN E YOU FOR AGE DISCRIMINATION.
best YOU KEEP ME ON, AVOID THE CONTROVERSY.
get OUT, CATHERINE.
I DIDN'T CHEAT. I TOOK MEDICINE
to HELP MY BRAIN FUNCTION AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL.
you DIDN'T HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE MEDICATION.
a DOZEN FACULTY MEMBERS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
admit TO TAKING UNPRESCRIBED ADDERALL
to IMPROVE THEIR OWN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE,
but NOBODY'S EXPELLING THEM.
they're CLAIMING IT SHOWS POOR MORAL CHARACTER.
and I REJECT THAT.
helicopter PILOTS TAKE PRESCRIPTION STIMULANTS TO STAY ALERT.
medical INTERNS TAKE DRUGS FOR NARCOLEPSY
so THAT THEY CAN WORK ALL NIGHT.
should WE INDICT ALL OF THEM AS WELL?
all THEY'VE DONE IS USE A PHARMACOLOGICAL TOOL
so THAT THEY COULD DO THEIR WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY.
certainly YOU'RE AWARE
that HARVARD HAS EXTREMELY HIGH STANDARDS.
of COURSE.
John F. KENNEDY WAS A GRADUATE.
as WAS THE UNABOMBER.
F. D.R. -HITLER'S FOREIGN PRESS SECRETARY.
numerous LITERARY FIGURES
emerson, THOREAU
and THE CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP
who SHIELDED CHILD MOLESTERS FROM PROSECUTION.
for FACULTY,
you HAD TIMOTHY LEARY AND HIS L. S.D. EXPERIMENTS
ms. COGGINS, DO YOU WANT TO GO TO HARVARD OR NOT?
Yeah, I DO...
desperately.
my POINT IS... HARVARD'S NOT PERFECT,
but NEITHER AM I.
but AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY,
I ENDEAVOR TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION OF MYSELF.
and THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING BY TAKING RITALIN.
the EARLY TRIALS HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING.
it's IN THE STAGE 3 TRIALS NOW.
I WANT IT.
well, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.
why NOT?
because IT'S NOT F. D.A. APPROVED.
this DRUG IS A LONG WAY-- -I DON'T CARE.
Mr. CRANE, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE THIS MEDICATION.
and EVEN IF I WERE AND DID, YOU STILL COULDN'T GET IT -SINCE IT HASN'T BEEN-- -HOW LONG BEFORE
it's AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC?
my GUESS IS AT LEAST TWO YEARS, PROBABLY THREE.
the F. D.A. HASN'T EVEN ANALYZED -I-I'LL--I'LL BE DEAD -THE DATA OF THE TRIALS-- -IN THREE YEARS.
Where's THE DRUG? WHO'S GOT IT?
well, PFIZER JUST BOUGHT THE RIGHTS,
but NOBODY CAN JUST SAY, "OKAY, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
it WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO
unless YOU GET YOURSELF ENROLLED IN A CLINICAL TRIAL,
but I THINK IT'S FULLY BOOKED.
let's BE FAIR.
it's NOT JUST THE S. A.T. THAT GETS A PERSON ADMITTED.
of COURSE NOT.
Margie, IN FACT, IS ALSO A NATIONAL MERIT FINALIST,
captain OF HER SWIM TEAM, CLASS VALEDICTORIAN.
we GET APPLICATIONS
from THOUSANDS OF NATIONAL MERIT FINALISTS,
thousands OF CAPTAINS AND THOUSANDS OF VALEDICTORIANS.
but THIS ONE, YOU OFFERED ADMISSION.
Yes, UNTIL SHE ADMITTED SHE HAD USED BRAIN ENHANCENT DRUGS.
as DO THOUSANDS OF OTHER STUDENTS.
do YOU HAVE A WAY TO WEED ALL OF THEM
out OF YOUR APPLICANT POOL?
no.
and THERE'S ACTUALLY NO POLICY AT HARVARD
explicitly FORBIDDING WHAT YOU TERM "ACADEMIC DOPING,
is THERE? -I THINK IN FUTURE
so YOU INTEND TO ENFORCE FUTURE RULES AGAINST HER.
do YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR?
we CONSIDER HER ACTIONS TO BE IMMORAL,
and WE RESERVE OUR RIGHT
to MAKE OUR ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ACCORDINGLY.
I've DECIDED NOT TO SUE YOU.
how SWEET.
listen,
th-that PART ABOUT ME BEING DESPERATE FOR A DISTRACTION,
that WAS TRUE.
I HAVE MY HEALTH
a-and MY MIND IS AS SHARP AS--AS...
well, YOU PEOPLE COME UP WITH ALL THIS MEDICINE
to--to--to KEEP US ALIVE,
even THRIVE,
and YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH US.
I WAS THINKING... IF I WERE TO COME UP
with SOMETHING I COULD SUE FOR,
something LEGITIMATE,
and IT COULD MAKE THE FIRM MONEY
uh... I SUPPOSE
if YOU HAD A LEGITIMATE CAUSE OF ACTION,
then WE WOULD
drugs.
uh, OKAY, THEY MAKE THEM TOO EXPENSIVE, -WHILE IN CANADA, YOU CAN-- -NO.
inflation.
uh, OUR SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS -DON'T KEEP PACE-- -NO.
Oh. LOOK, SOME JOBS STILL HAVE A MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE.
no.
these ARE ALL LEGITIMATE.
Catherine, YOU HAVE TO HAVE STANDING.
it HAS TO DIRECTLY IMPACT YOU,
harm YOU.
look HOW INSENSITIVE YOU'RE BEING.
th-this IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM.
we're JUST SHOVED ASIDE AS A NUISANCE.
I CAN'T EVEN WATCH TELEVISION SHOWS, FOR GOD SAKE,
because THE NETWORKS CONSIDER ME IRRELEVANT.
you'd THINK THEY DON'T PROGRAM FOR ANYBODY OVER 50.
is IT ANY WONDER
I'm OUT KNOCKING OVER CONVENIENCE STORES?
you ACTUALLY MAY HAVE SOMETHING THERE.
the NETWORKS
they're SUPPOSED TO SERVE THE PUBLIC.
okay, CATHERINE...
we'll TAKE THAT CASE.
Really?
I'm OVER 50 MYSELF...
and I WANT SOMETHING TO WATCH.
how WE DOING?
fine.
I GOT A HEARING BEFORE JUDGE PEYTON TOMORROW.
we'll TAKE OUR BEST SHOT.
Shirley's AT THE FAT FARM. YOU HEAR?
Why? SHE'S NOT FAT.
you KNOW BRIDES.
they LIKE TO GET ALL SKINNY BEFORE THE WEDDING.
it's ALL ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK IN THEIR DRESS.
you KNOW THE BEST PART OF HAVING, UH... MAD COW?
sometimes...
not OFTEN...
I THINK WE'RE STILL TOGETHER.
as DELUSIONS GO, IT'S ONE OF THE BETTER ONES.
you GONNA BE OKAY, DENNY, ATTENDING HER WEDDING?
Yeah. WELL...
what I'M NOT OKAY WITH IS...
sitting ON MY ASS WHILE MY BRAIN ROTS.
I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT, THOUGH.
we GO BEFORE JUDGE PEYTON IN THE MORNING.
Yeah, YOU TOLD ME.
you GONNA STAY HERE ALL NIGHT, JERRY?
it's NOT EVEN CLEAR
those DRUGS GAVE HER ALL THAT MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE.
she SCORED 99th PERCENTILE ON THE PRACTICE TEST,
which SHE TOOK WITHOUT THE DRUGS.
Jerry, SHE CHEATED. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.
most KIDS GET A BIGGER ADVANTAGE
by TAKING THE S. A.T. PREP PROGRAM.
they ACTUALLY CAN BOOST SCORES BY 150 POINTS.
those PROGRAMS ARE LEGITIMATE.
and NOT AFFORDABLE TO KIDS LIKE MARGIE.
let's FACE IT, KATIE.
the RICH HAVE SUCH A LEG UP IN THIS COLLEGE RACKET.
according TO ONE CHANCELLOR, IN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS,
poor APPLICANTS REALLY ONLY GET A SHOT AT 40% OF THE SLOTS.
the REST ARE RESERVED FOR FAMILIES OF PRIVILEGE.
but JERRY, YOU CANNOT BE A FAN OF ACADEMIC DOPING.
I'm JUST SAYING...
life ISN'T AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD,
and FOR THOSE WHO ARE...
weaker THAN...
meaning YOU?
Jerry, YOU'RE NOT WEAKER THAN. YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S.
you HAVE NO IDEA HOW AFRAID I AM
to LEAVE MY APARTMENT.
every DAY...
every MORNING,
I ACTUALLY WONDER, WILL I GET OUT THE DOOR OR NOT?
it SEEMS YOU WIN THAT BATTLE EVERY DAY.
yeah... ON DRUGS.
you CAn'T SUE THE NETWORKS.
the AIRWAVES, JUDGE, ARE A PUBLIC TRUST, AT LEAST AS FAR
as THE BROADCAST NETWORKS ARE CONCERNED.
that's WHY THEY'RE REGULATED. -IT'S STILL A BUSINESS.
I MEAN, BUNGEE JUMPING MIGHT BE REGULATED.
are YOU SAYING THAT THOSE OUTFITS
would HAVE A DUTY TO SERVICE THE ELDERLY?
no, THAT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE.
but TO REQUIRE A BROADCASTER TO PROGRAM FOR EVERYBODY ISN'T.
Mr. SUCK.
your HONOR, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME
when IT MADE PRACTICAL BUSINESS SENSE TO EXCLUDE THE OLD,
but NOT TODAY.
americans OVER 50 MAKE UP THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET.
it's ABOUT MONEY, NOT HOW MANY
Really? GEE. I WOULD'VE NEVER GUESSED THAT.
the BABY BOOMERS, NOW ALL OVER 50,
earn $2 TRILLION IN ANNUAL INCOME.
that's TRILLION.
Madison AVENUE IS AFTER THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDER.
Yes, AND PEOPLE OVER 50 ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF THAT, TOO.
choose YOUR STATISTIC. GO AHEAD. I'VE GOT YOU.
we've GOT MORE MONEY. WE SPEND MORE MONEY.
we WATCH MORE TELEVISION, GO TO MORE MOVIES.
we BUY MORE CDs THAN YOUNG PEOPLE DO,
and YET WE'RE THE FOCUS OF LESS THAN 10% OF THE ADVERTISING.
all THE NETWORKS WANT TO DO IS SKEW YOUNGER.
kid SHOWS FOR KIDS.
you KNOW, THE ONLY SHOW UNAFRAID TO HAVE ITS STARS OVER 50 IS "B
gee, I CAN'T SAY IT. IT WOULD, UM, BREAK THE WALL.
Oh, MR. SUCK. IT'S STILL SACK.
I CAN'T TELL THE NETWORKS WHAT SHOWS TO MAKE.
no, BUT YOU CAN ORDER THEM NOT TO DISCRIMINATE.
what THEY'RE DOING INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDES A CLASS OF SOCIETY.
that's BIGOTRY.
you KNOW, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN ON OUR DAMN TELEVISIONS
and SEE SOMETHING
other THAN REALITY SHOWS AIMED AT FOURTH GRADERS,
games SHOWS AIMED AT THOSE
slightly SMARTER THAN FIFTH GRADERS
and SCRIPTED SHOWS
with DIM-WITTED, SEX-CRAZED 20-SOMETHINGS
running AROUND IN SUITS OR DOCTOR SCRUBS.
old PEOPLE, THE ONES WITH INTELLIGENCE,
don't WANT TO WATCH THAT CRAP. WE'RE FED UP!
you KNOW, THE NETWORKS MIGHT THINK WE'RE DEAD, BUT WE'RE NOT.
we're VERY MUCH ALIVE WITH WORKING BRAINS.
give US SOMETHING TO WATCH, DAMN IT!
you READY, DENNY?
what's WRONG?
I MUST HAVE NODDED OFF.
I WAS...
dreaming ABOUT SHIRLEY.
we WERE ON A BENCH.
she ASKED ME TO MARRY HER.
what A DREAM.
were MY EYES CLOSED WHEN YOU CAME IN?
Yeah.
you MUST HAVE NODDED OFF.
you READY?
we're DUE IN COURT.
Mr. SHORE, THE SUPREME COURT ALREADY RULED ON THIS VERY ISSUE.
no, THEY DIDN'T, JUDGE.
the SUPREME COURT, IN FACT, REFUSED TO RULE ON IT.
they COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EVEN HEAR THE CASE.
I'm SURE IF ONE OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE DYING,
we WOULD'VE HAD A DIFFERENT RESULT.
Oh, COME ON.
why CAN'T MR. CRANE TAKE THE DRUG AND SIMPLY ASSUME
all THE INHERENT RISKS IF HE SO CHOOSES?
because WE DON'T LET PEOPLE TAKE DRUGS
while THEY'RE STILL IN THE INVESTIGATIVE STAGE,
and WITH GOOD REASON.
think OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE.
potential FOR ABUSE?
what's THE DOWNSIDE? HE COULD DIE?
he's DOING THAT ANYWAY.
no, HE ISN'T. HE COULD LIVE -A LONG TIME WITH ALZHEIMER'S. -WHICH COULD BE WORSE.
and IT'S POSSIBLE THE DISEASE COULD TAKE YEARS TO PROGRESS.
he COULD HAVE MANY HEALTHY YEARS WHILE WE
there ARE ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES AND CHOICES.
why CAN'T THEY BELONG TO THE PATIENT?
there IS STILL SO MUCH
that IS STILL SO UNKNOWN ABOUT DIMEBOLIN THAT
Yes, AND WE'LL ASSUME ALL OF THE RISKS.
do I EVER GET TO SPEAK? -I'D PREFER YOU DIDN'T.
we're WASTING PRECIOUS TIME. -MR. SHORE,
I AM A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE.
I HAVE TO TAKE MY CUES FROM THE APPELLATE COURT.
on THIS ISSUE, THE LAW IS CLEAR.
a PATIENT, EVEN A DYING PATIENT,
has NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT.
now DO I AGREE WITH THAT PRECEDENT? NO, NOT REALLY.
so THIS IS WHAT I WILL DO
I'll CERTIFY IT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME COURT.
maybe THEY CAN FIND THE AUTHORITY
to GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.
we ARE ADJOURNED.
so NOW WHAT?
we GO TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT.
there's NINE OF THEM.
let's HOPE THAT AT LEAST ONE HAS A RELATIVE
who HAS AN INCURABLE DISEASE.
when WAS THE LAST TIME A PRETTY LADY SAT NE TO YOU
and SUCKED ON YOUR EAR LOBE?
and DON'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES
you HAD TO PAY FOR IT.
how DARE YOU?
I'm EATING MY LUNCH.
Oh, COME ON, SWEETHEART. THROW AN OLD LADY A BONE.
you ARE...
a SHOCKING WOMAN!
look, JUDGE, I KNOW THIS IS--IS EX PARTE
or SOME--WHATEVER, UH, UH,
some LATIN TERM THAT MEANS I CAN'T GUM YOUR BODY PARTS.
but WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING GOOD TO WATCH ON TV?
I MEAN, THE AIRWAVES ARE A PUBLIC TRUST. AM I RIGHT?
uh, CATHERINE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
she's TRYING TO SUCK ON MY EAR.
that's WHAT SHE'S DOING.
outrageous! -CATHERINE,
go INSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.
I'll MEET YOU THERE. NOW.
Ahem. I APOLOGIZE, JUDGE.
you ASK ME,
your CLIENT ALREADY WATCHES TOO MUCH TELEVISION.
Ah. -AND THAT SMUTTY MOUTH.
sex, SEX, SEX, SEX.
that WHAT YOU WATCH?
Silence!
uh, WELL, YOU KNOW, JUDGE,
in ADDITION TO THERE BEING LITTLE FOR US TO WATCH,
most OF IT STINKS,
and IT'S PARTLY THIS THING'S FAULT.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
well, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ON IT WHILE THEY'RE WATCHING.
they NO LONGER GIVE TELEVISION THEIR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.
we're EITHER ON THE PHONE
or WE'RE TEXTING OR ON THE INTERNET.
so THE PRODUCERS, THEY DUMB DOWN THE PLOTS,
make IT EASIER TO KEEP UP WITH WHILE THEIR VIEWERS MULTITASK.
Really?
kids NOWADAYS WATCH AN AVERAGE OF THREE HOURS OF TELEVISION A DAY.
that's WHILE BEING DISTRACTED.
people OVER 55, WE WATCH 6 HOURS A DAY.
and WE REALLY WATCH.
so WHY AREN'T THEY PROGRAMMING FOR US?
you KNOW, COME ON, DO THESE IDIOTS A FAVOR, JUDGE.
send THESE NETWORK BOZOS A CLUE. BE A LEADER.
and WE CAN'T WAIT FOR CONGRESS AFTER ALL,
because, WELL, THEY'RE BOZOS, TOO.
these ARE THEIR MINDS THEY'RE MESSING WITH.
we DON'T EVEN KNOW THE LONG-TERM DAMAGE.
now OBVIOUSLY,
short OF REQUIRING URINALYSIS AT THE S. A.T. s,
we CAN'T MONITOR WHO IS OR ISN'T USING,
but WE CAN TAKE A STAND AGAINST THE ONES
who ARE BRAZEN ABOUT IT,
who DEFEND IT AS ACCEPTABLE AND FAIR.
simply PUT, WHAT MARGIE COGGINS DID
was DECIDEDLY UNFAIR.
it's CHEATING.
not IN KEEPING WITH THE IDEALS OF HARVARD.
I GOT INTO HARVARD.
most DON'T.
harvard REJECTS OVER 90% OF ITS APPLICANTS.
that's 90% OF THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.
the REST DON'T EVEN BOTHER APPLYING.
the PROBLEM IS,
every PARENT WANTS THEIR KID TO GO TO HARVARD.
parents PUSH, NUDGE. SOME KICK.
look AT THE CLIMATE WE'VE CREATED.
80% OF HONORS
and ADVANCE-PLACEMENT STUDENTS CHEAT,
not ONCE OR TWICE, BUT ON A REGULAR BASIS.
she DIDN'T.
she DIDN'T GET THE TEST ANSWERS AHEAD OF TIME.
she DIDN'T COPY HER NEIGHBOR'S PAPER.
she USED HER OWN BRAIN.
Yes, SHE USED A PRESCRIPTION STIMULANT TO STAY FOCUSED AND ALERT.
at LEAST 30% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS ADMIT TO DOING THE SAME THING.
not ONLY ARE THERE CURRENTLY NO LAWS AGAINST IT,
there ARE CURRENTLY NO RULES.
these KIDS GROW UP IN A PERVASIVE DRUG CULTURE.
we've GOT MEDICATIONS NOT JUST TO TREAT DISEASES,
but SIMPLY TO HELP YOU DO THINGS BETTER,
be IT SEX, URINATING, DIGESTING.
we've GOT SOME TO BOOST ENERGY, OTHERS TO HELP YOU SLEEP.
better LIFE,
more PRODUCTIVE LIFE THROUGH CHEMISTRY.
the DRUG WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE
is USED OFF LABEL BY MANY TO BOOST BRAIN POWER.
personally...
I've TRIED MEDICATION TO HELP WITH MY ASPERGER'S.
some WORKED.
they MADE ME FEEL SAFER EMOTIONALLY.
should I NOT GET THAT RIGHT?
or ARE DRUGS FOR EMOTIONS OKAY, BUT COGNITION, NO?
or SHOULD THE RULE BE FOR DISORDER, YES,
but ENHANCEMENT, NO?
where DO YOU DRAW THAT LINE?
she DIDN'T HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ONES SHE TOOK.
true, BUT MANY KIDS DO THIS. SHE'S NO DIFFERENT.
except SHE GOT CAUGHT. -SHE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.
she WAS SIMPLY HONEST ABOUT IT.
HONESTY--THAT'S THE INFRACTION
that's GETTING HER BOUNCED ON MORAL CHARACTER GROUNDS.
hypocrisy MIGHT BE A BETTER WORD.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I'm GIVING THE BRIDE AWAY, REMEMBER?
Oh. -I'M PRACTICING.
I WANT TO GET IT RIGHT.
and SHE'S GONNA MAKE A MAGNIFICENT BRIDE...
for THE SEVENTH TIME.
Yeah.
need SOMETHING?
Denny, THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME COURT,
they SAID NO.
Oh, JEEZ.
any APPEAL?
well, TO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT,
but THEY'VE ALREADY REFUSED TO HEAR THIS VERY ARGUMENT, SO...
so NOW WHAT?
I'm NOT SURE.
we CAN TRY TO GET YOU INTO THE CLINICAL TRIALS.
we COULD GO TO RUSSIA. -WE COULD.
or WE COULD GO TO ATLANTA.
I HEAR THE RUSSIANS HAVE KINDA TAKEN OVER GEORGIA, -SO WE COULD GO TO ATLANTA. -IT'S ANOTHER GEORGIA
that THE RUSSIANS HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH
then WE'LL GO TO THE REAL RUSSIA.
they GOT MAGNIFICENT SALMON STREAMS
and NO FISH FARMS.
what A ROAD TRIP.
can YOU IMAGINE YOU AND ME ON THE LOOSE IN RUSSIA?
that WOULD BE SOMETHING. GO FLY-FISHING WITH PUTIN.
look HIM IN THE EYE, SEE HIS SOUL.
tell HIM TO KEEP HIS BIG, UGLY HEAD OUT OF ALASKAN AIRSPACE.
right AFTER THE WEDDING.
off TO RUSSIA.
all RIGHT.
I CAN'T SOLVE THE BRAIN ENHANCEMENT DEBATE
with ONE RULING.
but IN THIS CASE,
the PLAINTIFF DIDN'T HAVE A PRESCRIPTION.
what SHE DID WAS ILLEGAL.
I AM NOT ORDERING HARVARD TO REINSTATE HER.
we're ADJOURNED.
wh-what DO I DO NOW?
what's THIS?
well... THIS...
would BE... A-A LECTURE, I GUESS.
you SAID YOU GEARED YOUR WHOLE LIFE
toward GETTING INTO HARVARD.
and NOW YOU THINK IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD
that...
it's THIS VERY UBER-SUPER-COMEPITITIVE MENTALITY THAT CAUSED YOU
to TAKE THE PILLS IN THE FIRST PLACE, MARGIE, AND
Mr. ESPENSON, YOU DID GET INTO HARVARD.
and IT CHANGED NOTHING.
I STILL POPPED, PURRED, HOPPED.
I WAS STILL RIDICULED. HARVARD DIDN'T CHANGE IT.
but I WAS SO SURE LAW SCHOOL WOULD,
because EVERYBODY RESPECTS LAWYERS.
so I STUDIED, STUDIED, MADE TOP OF MY CLASS.
it CHANGED NOTHING.
but I WAS POSITIVE MAKING PARTNER WOULD.
well... GUESS WHAT.
none OF IT CAN GIVE YOU SELF-ACCEPTANCE.
for THAT, YOU NEED
a DIFFERENT UG?
exactly. AND--NO. NO!
for SELF-ACCEPTANCE, YOU NEED TO GO TO A FAR DEEPER, PERHAPS DARKER,
certainly SCARIER PLACE.
your PROBLEM, MARGIE, IS YOUR PRIORITIES.
harvard ISN'T GOING TO GIVE YOU WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IN LIFE.
trust ME.
at FIRST, I THOUGHT THIS CASE WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER CASE
brought BY THIS... RIDICULOUS LAW FIRM
ridiculous AND OUTRAGEOUS.
but I CAN'T IGNORE,
ageism IS ONE OF THE LAST SOCIALLY CONDONED BIGOTRIES.
and IT IS RAMPANT IN THIS BROADCAST NETWORK BUSINESS.
they CONSIDER THOSE OF US OVER 50 TO BE IRRELEVANT.
how IS IT POSSIBLE
that WE ARE NOT EVEN A PART OF THE TARGET DEMO
when WE WATCH THE MOST TELEVISION
and SPEND THE MOST MONEY?
my GOD, THERE ARE 87 MILLION OF US,
and THAT NUMBER WILL GROW BY 31 MILLION MORE BY 2020.
are YOU REALLY TELLING ME THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
to MAKE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT WE WANT TO TCH?
if I AM TO ASSUME
that THE INDUSTRY IS NOT RUN BY A BUNCH OF IDIOTS,
then I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THAT IT'S DOMINATED BY PREJUDICE.
the CASE STANDS.
adjourned.
well, WELL, WELL.
congratulations, CATHERINE.
you KNOW...
old PEOPLE HAVE ACTIVE SEX LIVES, TOO.
my TRAILER OR YOURS?
you ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME
Oh, HEY...
uh, I WAS, UH...
just PRACTICING.
I-I WANT TO GIVE HER AWAY RIGHT.
listen, I, UM...
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SUCH A...
well, A GREAT SPORT ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW THAT ON SOME LEVEL, IT
What?! OH, MY JIMINY CHRISTMAS!
Denny! DENNY! WE'RE GOIN' BACK! WE'RE GOIN' BACK!
we're GOIN' BACK! -WHAT ARE YOU TALK
the CASE! THE CASE! THE CASE!
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE CLERK'S OFFICE.
the MASSACHUSETTS-- -SLOW DOWN.
we're ON OUR WAY! -R-RUSSIA?
not RUSSIA. -ATLANTA?
no, WASHINGTON! THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME COURT,
on THEIR OWN INITIATIVE,
petitioned THE U. S. SUPREME COURT.
this TIME, THEY AGREED TO HEAR IT.
hear WHAT?
our CASE! -WHAT?!
we're GOING BACK TO THE SUPREME COURT! -WHEN?
next WEEK. -NEXT WEEK?
next WEEK! -OH!
supreme COURT! SUPREME COURT! SUPREME COURT!
sorry, CARL. DON'T MEAN TO EXCLUDE YOU.
supreme COURT! SUPREME COURT! SUPREME COURT! SUPREME COURT!
working LATE AGAIN?
it's A MYTH THE WORKLOAD DROPS WHEN YOU MAKE PARTNER.
get OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN.
Jerry, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
your COMMENT ABOUT YOU BEING WEAKER THAN...
I've BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT, AND I DISAGREE.
I QUITE THINK YOU MIGHT BE
the BRAVEST PERSON I'VE EVER MET.
Why?
just THE WAY YOU TAKE ON YOUR VARIOUS CHALLENGES EVERY DAY.
there AREN'T MANY MEN LIKE YOU, JERRY.
Thanks.
how ABOUT WE GO FOR A DRINK?
we HAD A GOOD DAY.
we ACTUALLY LOST, COME TO THINK OF IT. ALL THE MORE REASON.
shall WE? -AS COLLEAGUES?
Jerry, LET'S GO FOR A DRINK.
I'll MEET YOU BY THE ELEVATOR?
do YOU THINK THE SUPREME COURT,
when THEY AGREED TO TAKE THIS CASE,
knew IT WAS US?
I DON'T KNOW.
maybe THEY WANT A REMATCH.
ha! YOU'LL KICK THEIR ASSES AGAIN.
they'll HAVE TO BRING IN MORE JUSTICES.
I THINKn THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWED THE NINE.
Hey, MAYBE I'LL RETIRE AFTER THIS.
don't BE RIDICULOUS. -WELL, WHAT BETTER WAY TO GO OUT?
my LAST CASE--IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT.
now THERE'S A FINALE, ALAN. THEY SHOULD PUT IT ON TV.
we'd GET RATINGS. IF THEY PROMOTED US,
of COURSE, I THINK THERE'S A LAW AGAINST PROMOTING US.
seems TO BE.
what WOULD YOU DO IF YOU RETIRED, DENNY, SERIOUSLY?
fish.
every DAY?
not EVERY DAY. I'D HAVE SEX SOME DAYS.
maybe I SHOULD INVITE RUTH BADER GINSBURG
to COME TO NIMMO BAY WITH ME.
what ABOUT ME?
you CAN BORROW MAGAZINES FROM CLARENCE THOMAS.
Oh, WON'T THEY BE SO HAPPY TO SEE US AGAIN?
the REMATCH. -THE REMATCH.
grand FINALE. -SPECIAL 9: 00 START TIME.
I MADE ANOTHER DECISION TODAY.
which IS?
I'm NOT DYING.
I LIKE THAT IDEA.
I'm GONNA GET MY HANDS ON THIS DRUG ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
hell, THIS IS AMERICA. IF WE HAVE TO, WE'LL
bribe.
damn RIGHT.
and EVEN IF I FAIL,
they SAY IF YOU KEEP GETTING EXCITED ABOUT LIFE,
the BLOOD RUSHES TO YOUR BRAIN BETTER.
I'll LOVE LIFE, ALAN,
even IF IT KILLS ME.
I'll FISH, I'LL BE WITH YOU.
I'll LOVE LIFE, ALAN.
and NEXT WEEK, I'LL LOVE LIFE IN WASHINGTON
in FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT.
and AFTER THAT, I'LL LOVE IT IN--IN NIMMO BAY
with RUTH BADER GINSBURG. -SHE WANTS ME.
I SAW THAT.
Hey, MAYBE SHE PERSUADED THEM TO TAKE THIS CASE.
to BE CLOSER TO YOU.
Oh, RUTHIE, RUTHIE, RUTHIE.
here WE COME.
have you been feeling other symptoms lately?
sometimes I feel a little foggy.
I don't seem to always get things.
we all know it, we laugh it off, we say, "isn't the mad cow cute?"
at what point do we all admit the man needs help?
the firm is going broke?
we may have to shut our doors.
did I know this and forget?
you've been almost like a big sister to me.
if you knew this cra catherine piper...
do you think they considered me sane?
if only they could know you like I do.
Hello, dear. May I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for a lawyer.
uh, yes, I suspected as much.
you're in a law firm.
uh, what have you done, dear?
well, I, uh, I got into harvard, and then
a pretty little thing like you? oh, please.
who'd we do, sweetheart?
then they rescinded my admission, and now I would like to sue them.
of course you would.
um, katie, be a dear and help this young lady.
uh, katie will help you, dear.
why don't we go to the conference room?
hello.
who are you?
uh, I'm catherine, honey. D-- who are you?
Carl Sack. May I help you?
I doubt it.
uh, you strike me as pushy.
may I ask, and I think I may, being, uh, a senior partner, just wh-what...
what are you doing here?
I work here, dear.
you work here? - Yes, dear.
who hired you?
Shirley Schmidt did, dear.
she's my older sister.
I think if Shirley Schmidt had hired you, she would've told me.
Really? Does she tell you everything?
did she tell you she went to cabo for the week?
she did, and she left me a contact number...
if you can imagine.
well, that's lovely.
did she tell you her calls were being forwarded to her younger sister?
hello. Who's calling, please?
is it the pushy man?
okay, Denny, I want you to count backwards by sevens from a hundred.
Why?
it's just a test.
uh, 86... 81... 75...
4--4, I meant to say. 4...
uh, 1984, like the Orwell
74...
who the hell wrote that?
no, no, you were down to 74 not 84.
W-whatever.
continue, please.
74... 67... Hell of year--'67.
the Sox won the pennant.
Jimmy Lonborg pitched a 2-hitter second game, anyaz plunked two out.
hell of a game.
who pitched the first game of tt world series?
jose Santiago against, uh, Bob Gibson.
Gibson pitched, uh, three times, won the series.
who's the best pitcher for the Sox this year?
don't tell me. Josh Pecker. Hell of a pitcher, pecker.
who's the best hitter?
uh, that's, uh, that black guy-- uh, the, um--Oortiz. David Ortiz.
he's half black, half mexican, half dominican.
who's the president of the United States?
barack obama.
he's half Hawaiian, half Kenyan half black and half, uh, halle berry.
it has progressed.
last year, we were at stage, which is basically mild cognitive decline.
now 's more like stage 4, which is moderate.
talk to me like I'm in the room, would you?
I am.
you remember yesterday very well, but forming new memories is obviously more difficult.
cut to the punch line.
you're in the early stages of alzheimer'S.
we're not talking about precursor's anymore.
it's here.
academic doping?
Yeah. You find a friend with a prescription for ritalin or adderall, and you pop some pills to help study and stay focused the day of the S.A.T.
and you did this? - Yeah. It's not illegal.
and how'd you do on the S.A.T?
I got a rfect score.
and I was accepted to Harvard...
which is fairly newsworthy given I went to your average small-town public school.
I did an interview with the local paper...
where I was quoted as saying ritalin was a godsend when it came to test taking.
and that sparked a whole debate in the comments section
is it ethical, is it not-- and the Boston papers picked it up, and suddenly I'm in the middle of this controversy that Harvard wants no part of, so they rescind my offer of admission.
well, I believe taking a controlled substance without a prescription actually is illegal.
no, it's a study aid, just one step above potent coffee.
so what would you like us to do?
get me reinstated at Harvard.
I didn't do anything to deserve this.
I mean, they're singling me out, and now no school will take me.
where are your parents with all this?
beyond devastated.
it was their dream to see their little girl go to harvard.
I have to fix this. I screwed it up...
and I have to fix this.
what are you doing at my desk?
I-I was just straightening up.
that's what assistants do.
you're not my assistant.
Yes, I am, dear.
no, I have an as
where is she?
Oh, Francine? I fired her.
too pretty, too young-- she's a distraction.
all right, I'm calling security.
look, honey, you sure you want to make trouble for Shirley's sister?
I mean, after all
your name is Catherine Piper. You were fired for, among other things, being psychotic.
I also have cancer, dear.
there. It's out.
I am desperate for a distraction, anything to occupy myself while...
I'm sorry. I didn't come here to indulge...
you have cancer?
not really, but I could get some if you'd like.
Oh, 9-1-1.
look, if I could just work here on a temporary-- oh, sorry.
9-1-1. what's the emergency?
how did...
I'm afraid they said no.
but... did you point out I didn't actually violate any policy or
they're citing hones, moral character.
uh, everody's doing it.
I realize that, but-- - but you went public, Margie.
we can take it to court, but I wouldn't expect to be successful.
Oh, we--we have to try.
I have geared my whole life toward going to Harvard.
I just...
I need to try. Please.
I don't know, Jerry.
you say she didn't have a prescription.
all the kids are doing this, Alan-- getting it without prescriptions.
well, that's not much of an argument.
you could argue that rescinding her admission is arbitrary since they have no official policy.
Oh, Alan. Um, hey, Jerry.
Alan, there's a drug-- it's called, uh, dimebolin, something like- hat- and I want it.
my doctor won't give it to me. It's from Russia. It stems off Alzheimer'S.
Denny, slow down.
I can't at the moment. I've taken a little too much adderall.
Adderall?
see? That's what Margie takes, that ainital.
Ritalin. I love ritalin.
Denny, what did we agree on regarding your medicines?
I would be in charge.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm the one with the Alzheimer'S.
I'll take what I want, and right now, I want dimebolin.
and you've gotta help me get it.
you okay, Jerry?
academic doping...
it has such a stigma to it.
what about emotional doping?
what do you mean?
that's what I do-- emotional doping.
I take my little helpers to...
do you think it reflects poorly on my moral character?
no.
what's the difference?
well, your medication is prescribed for one thing. Mostly.
and second, you have a specific, diagnosed condition, Jerry - Asperger's Syndrome.
three years ago, you couldn't even make eye contact.
I take pills that affect my brain to help me perform better.
Jerry, I'm the first one to say we have an overmedicated society.
we've got 3 year olds on antipsychotics.
people who don't even have high cholesterol take statins.
people take sleep aids when maybe they should just read a book or masturbate.
I-it's out of control.
but that's not to say that many drugs don't do a lot of good.
they save lives.
people need drugs like insulin or blood pressure medicine to simply maintain their health.
and drugs help some people to live normal, productive lives who might otherwise not.
you fall into that category.
popping pills to...
get better S.A.T. Scores-- that's...
something different.
you are not working here, Catherine.
that much has been decided.
well, then what are we doing in your office, behind closed doors...
where you could sexuallrava me with no witnesses to say it didn't happen?
we're here because I'm told you're a friend of Alan's.
and as a courtesy to him and you,
I thought I would at least give you an opportunity to explain why you're doing this.
I'm doing it because I'm old and I'm bored.
all my friends are dead.
it's not like I could go skiing or--or mountain climbing or...
honestly, a-assuming I were qualified to be your assistant, uh, would you employ somebody my age?
probably not.
I didn't think so.
I got that on tape, dear.
now I can sue you for age discrimination.
best you keep me on, avoid the controversy.
get out, Catherine.
I didn't cheat.
I took medicine h to help my brain function at its highest level.
you didn't have a prescription for the medication.
a dozen faculty members at cambridge university admit to taking unprescribed adderall to improveheir own academic performance, but nobody's expelling them.
they're claiming it shows poor moral character.
and I reject that.
helicopter pilots take prescription stimulants to stay alert.
medical interns take drugs for narcolepsy so that they can work all night.
should we indict all of them as well?
all they've done is use a pharmacological tool so that they could do their work more effectively.
certainly you're aware that Harvard has extremely high standards.
of course.
John F. Kennedy was a graduate.
as was the unabomber.
f.d.r. - Hitler's foreign press secretary.
numerous literary figures - Emerson, Thoreau
and the cardinal archbishop who shielded child molesters from prosecution.
for faculty, you had Timothy Leary and his L.S.D. Experiments
ms. Coggins, do you want to go to Harvard or not?
Yeah, I do...
desperately.
my point is... Harvard's not perfect, but neither am I.
but at every opportunity, I endeavor to be the best possible version of myself.
and that's all I was doing by taking ritalin.
the early trials have been encouraging.
it's in the stage 3 trials now.
I want it.
well, you can't have it.
why not?
because it's not F.D.A. Approved.
this drug is a long way - I don't care.
Mr. Crane, I'm not allowed to prescribe this medication.
and even if I were and did, you still couldn't get it since it hasn't been
how long before it's available to the public?
my guess is at least two years, probably three.
the F.D.A. hasn't even analyzed the data of the trials - I - I'll - I'll be dead in three years.
Where's the drug? Who's got it?
well, Pfizer just bought the rights, but nobody can just say, "okay, I'll give it to you."
it would be illegal to do so unless you get yourself enrolled in a clinical trial, but I think it's fully booked.
let's be fair. It's not just the S.A.T. That gets a person admitted.
of course not.
Margie, in fact, is also a national merit finalist, captain of her swim team, class valedictiaN.
we get applications from thousands of national merit finalists, thousands of captains and thousands of valedictorians.
but this one, you offered admission.
Yes, until she admitted she had used brain enhancent drugs.
as do thousands of other students.
do you have a way to weed all of them out of your applicant pool?
no.
and there's actually no policy at Harvard explicitly forbidding what you term "academic doping," is there?
I think in future
so you intend to enfortu fure rules against her.
do you think that's fair?
we consider her actions to be immoral, and we reserve our right to make our admissions decisions accordingly.
I've decided not to sue you.
how sweet.
listen, th-that part about me being desperate for a distraction, that was true.
it isn't fair, Carl.
I have my health a-and my mind is as sharp as--as...
well, you people come up with all this medicine to--to--to keep us alive, even thrive, and you don't know what to do with us.
I was thinking...
if I were to come up with something I could sue for, something legitimate, and it could make the firm money
I suppose if you had a legitimate cause of action, then we would
drugs.
uh, okay, they make them too expensive, while in canada, you can
no.
inflation.
uh, our social security payments don't keep pace
no.
look, some jobs still have a mandatory retirement age.
no.
these are all legitimate.
Catherine, you have to have standing.
it has to directly impact you, harm you.
look how insensitive you're being.
th-this is exactly the problem.
we're just shoved aside as a nuisance.
I can't even watch television shows, for god sake, because the tworks consider me irrelevant.
you'd think they don't program for anybody over 50.
is it any wonder I'm out knocking over convenience stores?
you actually may have something there.
the networks-- they're supposed to serve the public.
okay, Catherine... we'll take that case.
Really?
I'm over 50 myself...
and I want something to watch.
how we doing? - Fine.
I got a hearing before judge Peyton tomorrow.
we'll take our best shot.
Shirley's at the fat farm. You hear?
Why? She's not fat.
you know brides. They like to get all skinny before the wedding.
it's all about how they look in their dress.
you know the best part of having, uh...mad cow?
sometimes... not often...
I think we're still together.
as delusions go, it's one of the better ones.
you gonna be okay, Denny, attending her wedding?
Yeah. Well...
what I'm not okay with is...
sitting on my ass while my brain rots.
I have a big problem with that, though.
we go before judge Peyton in the morning.
Yeah, you told me.
you gonna stay here all night, Jerry?
it's not even clear those drugs gave her all that much of an advantage.
she scored 99th percentile on the practice test, which she took without the drugs.
Jerry, she cheated. Let's not kid ourselves.
most kids get a bigger advantage by taking the S.A.T. Prep program.
they actually can boost scores by 150 points.
those programs are legitimate.
and not affordable to kids like Margie.
let's face it, Katie.
the rich have such a leg up in this college racket.
according to one chancellor, in Ivy League schools, poor applicants really only get a shot at 40% of the slots.
the rest are reserved for families of privilege.
bu Jerry, you cannot be a fan of academic doping.
I'm just saying...
life isn't an even playing field, and for those who are weaker than...
meaning you?
Jerry, you're not weaker than. You have Asperger's.
you have no idea how afraid I am to leave my apartment.
every day...
every morning, I actually wonder, will I get out the door or not?
it seems you win that battle every day.
yeah... on drugs.
you can't sue the networks.
the airwaves, judge, are a public trust, at least as far as the broadcast networks are concerned.
that's why they're regulated.
it's still a business.
I mean, bungee jumping might be regulated.
are you saying that those outfits would have a duty to service the elderly?
no, that would be unreasonable.
but to require a broadcaster to program for everybody isn'T.
Mr. Suck. - Sack.
your honor, there may have been a time when it made practical business sense to exclude the old, but not today.
americans over 50 make up the fastest growing market.
it's about money, not how many
Really? Gee. I would've never guessed that.
the baby boomers, now all over 50, earn $2 trillion in annual income.
that's trillion.
Madison Avenue is after the discretionary spender.
Yes, and people over 50 account for half of that, too.
choose your statistic. Go ahead. I've got you.
we've got more money. We spend more money.
we watch more television, go to more movies.
we buy more cds than young people do, and yet we're the focus of less than 10% of the advertising.
all the networks want to do is skew younger.
kid shows for kids.
you know, the only show unafraid to have its stars over 50 is "b"
gee, I can't say it. It would, um, break the wall.
Oh, Mr. Suck. - It's still Sack.
I can't tell the networks what shows to make.
no, but you can order them not to discriminate.
what they're doing intentionally excludes a class of society.
that's bigotry.
you know, we should be able to turn on our damn televisions and see something other than reality shows aimed at fourth graders, games shows aimed at those slightly smarter than fifth graders and scripted shows with dim-witted, sex-crazed 20-somethings running around in suits or doctor scrubs.
old people, the ones with intelligence, don't want to watch that crap.
we're fed up!
you know, the networks might think we're dead, but we're not.
we're very much alive with working brains.
give us something to watch, damn it!
you ready, Denny?
what's wrong?
I must have nodded off.
I was... dreaming about Shirley.
we were on a bench.
she asked me to marry her.
what a dream.
were my eyes closed when you came in?
Yeah.
you must have nodded off.
you ready? We're due in court.
Mr. Shore, the supreme court already ruled on this very issue.
no, they didn't, judge.
the supreme court, in fact, refused to rule on it.
they couldn't be bothered to even hear the case.
I'm sure if one of their friends were dying, we would've had a different result.
Oh, come on.
why can't Mr. Crane take the drug and simply assume all the inherent risks if he so chooses?
because we don't let people take drugs while they're still in the investigative stage, and with good reason.
think of the potential for abuse.
potential for abuse?
what's the downside? He could die?
he's doing that anyway.
no, he isn't. He could live a long time with Alzheimer'S.
which could be worse.
and it's possible the disease could take years to progress.
he could have many healthy years while we
there are all kinds of possibilities and choices.
why can't they belong to the patient?
there is still so much that is still so unknown about dimebolin that
Yes, and we'll assume all of the risks.
do I even get to speak?
I'd prefer you didn't. We're wasting precious time.
Mr. Shore, I am a superior court judge.
I have to take my cues from the appellate court.
on this issue, the law is clear.
a patient, even a dying patient, has no constitutional right to experimental treatment.
now do I agree with that precedent? No, not really.
so this is what I will do-- I'll certify it to the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
maybe they can find the authority to give you what you want.
we are adjourned.
so now what?
we go to the state supreme court.
there's nine of them.
let's hope that at least one has a relative who has an incurable disease.
when was the last time a pretty lady sat near to you and sucked on your ear lobe?
and don't count the number of times you had to pay for it.
how dare you?
I'm eating my lunch.
Oh, come on, sweetheart. Throw an old lady a bone.
you are...
a shocking woman!
look, judge, I know this is--is exparte or some--whatever, uh, uh, some Latin term that means I can't gum your body parts.
but why don't you just give me something good to watch on tv?
I mean, the airwaves are a public trust. Am I right?
uh, Catherine, what are you doing?
she's trying to suck on my ear.
that's what she's doing. Outrageous!
Catherine, go inside the courthouse. I'll meet you there. Now.
I apologize, judge.
you ask me, your client already watches too much television.
and that smutty mouth.
sex, sex, sex, sex.
that what you watch?
Silence!
uh, well, you know, judge, in addition to there being little for us to watch, most of it stinks, and it's partly this thing's fault.
what are you talking about?
well, a lot of people are on it while they're watching.
they no longer give television their undivided attention.
we're either on the phone or we're texting or on the internet.
so the producers, they dumb down the plots, make it easier to keep up with while their viewers multitask.
Really?
kids nowadays watch an average of three hours of television a day.
that's while being distracted.
people over 55, we watch 6 hours a day.
and we really watch.
so why aren't they programming for us?
you know, come on, do these idiots a favor, judge.
send these network bozos a clue. Be a leader.
and we can't wait for congress after all, because, well, they're bozos, too.
these are their minds they're messing with.
we don't even know the long-term damage.
now obviously, short of requiring urinalysis at the S.A.T. So, we can't monitor who is or isn't using, but we can take a stand against the ones who are brazen about it, who defend it as acceptable and fair.
simply put, what Margie Coggins did was decidedly unfair.
it's cheating.
not in keeping with the ideals of Harvard.
I got into Harvard. Most don't.
harvard rejects over 90% of its applicants.
that's 90% of the best high school students.
the rest don't even bother applying.
the problem is, every parent wants their kid to go to Harvard.
parents push, nudge. Me kick.
look at the climate we've created.
80% of honors and advance-placement students cheat, not once or twice, but on a regular basis.
she didn't. She didn't get the test answers ahead of time.
she didn't copy her neighbor's paper. She used her own brain.
Yes, she used a prescription stimulant to stay focused and alert.
at least 30% of college students admit to doing the same thing.
not only are there currently no laws against it, there are currently no rules.
these kids grow up in a pervasive drug culture.
we've got medications not just to treat diseases, but simply to help you do things better, be it sex, urinating, digesting.
we've got some to boost energy, others to help you sleep.
better life, more productive life through chemistry.
the drug we're talking about here is used off label by many to boost brain power.
personally...
I've tried medication to help with my asperger'S.
some worked. They made me feel safer emotionally.
should I not get that right?
or are drugs for emotions okay, but cognition, no?
or should the rule be for disorder, yes, but enhancement, no?
where do you draw that line?
she didn't have a prescription for the ones she took.
true, but many kids do this. She's no different.
except she got caught.
she didn't get caught. She was simply honest about it.
Honesty--that's the infraction that's getting her bounced on moral character grounds.
hypocrisy might be a better word.
what are you doing?
I'm giving the bride away, remember?
I'm practicing.
I want to get it right.
and she's gonna make a magnificent bride...
for the seventh time. - yeah.
need something?
Denny, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, they said no.
any appeal?
well, to the U. S. Supreme court, but they've already refused to hear this very argument, so...
so now what?
I'm not sure.
we can try to get you into the clinical trials.
we could go to Russia. - We could.
or we could go to Atlanta.
I hear the Russians have kinda taken over Georgia, so we could go to Atlanta.
it's another Georgia that the Russians have gotten involved with
then we'll go to the real Russia.
they got magnificent salmon streams and no fish farms.
what a road trip. Can you imagine you and me on the loose in Russia?
that would be something.
go fly-fishing with Putin. Look him in the eye, see his soul.
tell him to keep his big, ugly head out of Alaskan airspace.
right after the wedding.
off to Russia.
all right.
I can't solve the brain enhancement debate with one ruling.
but in this case, the plaintiff didn't have a prescription.
what she did was illegal.
I am not ordering Harvard to reinstate her.
we're adjourned.
wh-what do I do now?
what's this?
well...
this... would be... a-a lecture, I guess.
you said you geared your whole life toward getting into Harvard.
and now you think it's the end of the world that...
it's this very uber-super-comepititive mentality that caused you to take the pills in the first place, Margie, and
Mr. Espenson, you did get into Harvard.
and it changed nothing.
I still popped, purred, hopped.
I was still ridiculed. Harvard didn't change it.
but I was so sure law school would, because everybody respects lawyers.
so I studied, studied, made top of my class.
it changed nothing.
but I was positive making partner would.
well... guess what.
none of it can give you self-acceptance. For that, you need
a different drug? - Exactly.
AND--NO. No!
for self-acceptance, you need to go to a far deeper, perhaps darker, certainly scarier place.
your problem, Margie, is your priorities.
harvard isn't going to give you what's most important in life.
trust me.
at first, I thought this case was like every other case brought by this...
ridiculous law firm-- ridiculous and outrageous.
but I can't ignore, ageism is one of the last socially condoned bigotries.
and it is rampant in this broadcast network business.
they consider those of us over 50 to be irrelevant.
how is it possible that we are not even a part of the target demo when we watch the most television and spend the most money?
my god, there are 87 million of us, and that number will grow by 31 million more by 2020.
are you really telling me that it doesn't make sense to make television shows that we want to watch?
if I am to assume that the industry is not run by a bunch of idiots, then I can only conclude that omin's dated by prejudice.
the case stands.
adjourned.
well, well, well.
congratulations, Catherine.
you know...
old people have active sex lives, too.
my trailer or yours?
uh, I was, uh...
just practicing.
I-I want to give her away right.
listen, I, um...
I appreciate you being such A...
well, a great sport about this.
I know that on some level, it
what? Oh, my jiminy Christmas!
Denny! Denny! We're goin' back! We're goin' back! We're goin' back!
what are you talk-- - the case! The case! The case!
I just got off the phone with the clerk's office. The Massachusetts
slow down. - We're on our way!
R-russia? - Not Russia.
Atlanta? - No, Washington!
the Massachusetts Supreme Court, on their own initiative, petitioned the U.S. Supreme court.
this time, they agreed to hear .
hear what? - Our case!
what? - We're going back to the supreme court!
when? - Next week.
next week? - Next week!
supreme court! - Supreme court!
sorry, Carl. Don't mean to exclude you.
supreme court! - Supreme court!
working late again?
it's myth the workload drops when you make partner.
get out while you still can.
Jerry, can I say something?
your comment about you being weaker than...
I've been thinking about it, and I disagree.
I quite think you might be the bravest person I've ever met.
Why?
just the way you take on your various challenges every day.
there aren't many men like you, Jerry.
Thanks.
how about we go for a drink?
we had a good day.
we actually lost, come to think of it. All the more reason. Shall we?
as colleagues?
Jerry, let's go for a drink.
I'll meet you by the elevator?
do you think the supreme court, when they agreed to take this case, knew it was us?
I don't know.
maybe they want a rematch.
you'll kick their asses again.
they'll have to bring in more justices.
I think they're only allowed the nine.
Hey, maybe I'll retire after this.
don't be ridiculous. - Well, what better way to go out?
my last case--in front of the supreme court.
now there's a finale, Alan. - They should put it on tv.
we'd get ratings.
if they promoted us, of course, I think there's a law against promoting us.
seems to be.
what would you do if you retired, Denny, seriously?
fish. - Every day?
not every day. I'd have sex some days.
maybe I should invite Ruth Bader Ginsburg to come to Nimmo Bay with me.
what about me?
you can borrow magazines from Clarence Thomas.
Oh, won't they be so happy to see us again?
the rematch. - the rematch.
grand finale. - Special 9: 00 start time.
I made another desion today.
which is?
I'm not dying.
I like that idea.
I'm gonna get my hands on this drug one way or another. Hell, this is America.
if we have to, we'-- - bribe.
damn right.
and even if I fail, they say if you keep getting excited about life, the blood rushes to your brain better.
I'll love life, Alan, even if it kills me.
I'll fish, I'll be with you.
I'll love life, Alan.
and next week, I'll love life in Washington in front of the supreme court.
and after that, I'll love it in--in Nimmo Bay with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
she wants me. - I saw that.
Hey, maybe she persuaded them to take this case.
to be closer to you.
Oh, Ruthie, Ruthie, Ruthie.
here we come.
all set for your testimony, Renee?
I'm nervous. I'm not as funny when I'm nervous.
she's very odd, Jerry.
I lost my cherry.
it was with Dana?
of course it was with Dana. She's my girlfriend.
Jerry's girlfriend. - What about her?
I didn't entirely give up the brothel business.
I'm not gonna date a call girl.
when I tell you I love you, that isn't a lie.
please leave.
Denny, if you were president, seriously, you would nuke Iraq and Iran?
then what, North Korea? - Okay.
Pakistan? - Why not?
Afghanistan? - If there's time.
tap dancing?
I used it before to battle stage fright when I first went into litigation.
but it's also effective for stress therapy.
a trained therapist actually suggested this?
is it too weird?
well, yes, Jerry.
the hopping, the wooden cigarette, the ticks, all of this I understandand even appreciate, but
Dana. Hello. Welcome. Not.
Hello, Kerry Katie.
listen, uh... how do I say this?
there's nothing to say, Dana.
I made my position clear. I am finished.
read my... lips!
Hello, Lorraine.
you were my next stop.
I'm not here to ask you to take me back, Jerry, as much as I'd like that.
I was arrested last night.
one of my clients-- one of your clients is an undercover agent working for the Boston police department.
I'm in a little bit of trouble.
I'm here in need of a lawyer.
she's a call girl?
can you believe it?
first Lorraine than this girl--hookers wherever you look.
and have you seen this girl Dana? My god. She's so beautiful.
and to think, she's only a credit card away.
well, well, well.
finally come to pay your bet.
how are you, Denny?
$10, 000 richer, I hope.
alan Shore, Paul Cruickshank.
I beat his ass in golf for 5 grand, then kicked what was left of it in the courtroom for another 5, 000.
the bet was, you were supposed to come crawling in with your money.
I'm not here about the bet, Denny.
what is it then?
it's extremely confidential.
we're married.
may I speak to you in private, please?
I'm assuming your office isn't bugged.
it might be. Why do you care?
once I tell you why I'm here, you'll realize this visit pains me far more than it does you.
let's get to that part then.
you know I'm on the republican national committee.
what do you think, honestly, of John Mccain?
Yes, that perception appears to be shared.
next question--do you know how W. got to be president?
his S.A.T. scores?
we picked him, not because of his intelligence... - Gee.
or that he was a great speaker... - No?
but because he tracks.
he was a cowboy. He was somebody we could sell to the American public.
John Mccain... isn't.
get to the punch line, Paul. I'm not feeling your pain.
because I have a relationship with you, I've been asked to ask you...
how would you feel about running for president?
there. I've done my duty. Just say no. I'll be gone.
president? Of the united states?
I can tell them you passed then?
commander in chief.
I like it.
don't be ridiculous.
they're considering me and ten others.
evidently, my appearance on the Larry King Show went through the roof.
the public loves me, as expected. - Denny
I'm not supposed to be telling you anything, by the way.
you know nothing.
do they know you have mad cow?
they're looking for the next Ronald Reagan, and he had it at the very end.
ronald Reagan didn't have a hooker fetish.
please. I'm an emperor.
Denny, no offense, but this is beyond preposterous, beyond.
Why?
bigger nut jobs have been floated in the past
lee Iacocca, Donald Trump, Jesse Ventura.
why not me?
Denny, you don't think before you speak.
you barely speak the English language.
you always have to get your way.
you'd never get along with other countries.
for god sake, what would possess the republican party
heir apparent.
this must be a joke.
I'm being vetted by six committee members this afternoon.
I pass that test...
top secret.
hello.
Hel-hello.
m-may I help you? - You may.
my name is Renee Winger.
I was denied employment by a company guilty of pervasive and systemic gender bias.
might I count on you to be my attorney?
may I ask, what company are you looking to sue?
the archdiocese.
the archdiocese of Boston?
Yes. I seek to be a priest.
don't we all.
you are a woman.
okay, thank you.
now will be fine.
no arraignment yet.
the D.A. wants to meet.
which means they're willing to make a deal.
Dana, I don't think we can represent you.
they'll most likely ask you to flip your employer, and that would be Lorraine.
I don't plan to flip anybody.
I told Lorraine I'd preserve her confidence. I keep my word.
spare us the self-righteousness, Dana.
you kept from me you were a call girl.
look, folks, come on.
they got us here dead to rights, flat as a pancake, done, finis, sacre bleu, kaputski.
Jerry, we agreed we'd leave out the foreign languages.
may I have a word with Jerry, please?
I don't expect you to be able to reconcile how a woman can have sexual relations with one man while being committed to and completely in love with another, but
I really don't want to go there.
I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
could we maybe go to dinner and just talk?
I'm seeing somebody. - Who?
an inflatable doll, if you must know.
Patty wasn't inflatable.
this is just a cheap, transitional thing, not that you weren't.
give me a break, would ya?
let me acknowledge from the outset, this is a long shot.
okay.
for whatever reason, your public appearances, most recently on Larry King, have been very winning with our base.
you also have a bit of a wild west profile that John Mccain...
doesn't, but there are sues.
you recently appeared before the supreme court opposing the death penalty.
hired gun, just in case.
I am for the death penalty.
always have been, always will be.
I'd like to play a political rorschach test, a, uh, word association game.
shoot.
I'll throw out a word. You say the first word that pops into your head.
shoot.
homosexual. - Shoot.
abortion. - Murder.
the war. - 9/11.
economy. - Democrats.
John Mccain.
immigration. - No mas.
Hillary. - Pull my finger.
that was very interesting.
can we turn to your personal life? - Please.
our background check reveals you enjoy spending time with prostitutes.
who doesn't? I like sex. I like women.
I'll hump anything in a dress.
I'll even get down on the floor with you right now if they'll turn off the lights.
but know this, the American public will find it refreshing to finally get a republican candidate who's not a moralistic, sexually repressed, crusading hypocrite who cruises airport mens' rooms late at night.
Denny Crane rides high in the saddle.
I'll go into office with my boots on, I'll die with my boots on. Next?
alan Shore. - What about him?
he expresses many anti-American views.
which I disagree with most of time, but I won't throw him under the bus to be president.
what else you got?
we're prepared to go forward this year without the blessing of the christian right, but we cannot and will not abandon the values of our most valuable and precious republican base.
I speak, of course, of the N.R.A.
bring it on.
we have taken many ridiculous cases, but suing a church
that's guilty of gender bias.
what, are you saying we should have a woman pope?
there's evidence of a female pope called Joan around the 9th century.
records of her were destroyed by subsequent popes.
Carl, it's not a ridiculous case.
and since it could be perceived as runaway feminism,
I really, really think it's important that we have a man at the table.
No! No, no, no.
it's the right thing to do.
and you know what?
I'll bet a reasonable judge will agree.
of all the ridiculous, sacrilegious, blasphemous acts of her ever I've heard.
as for the unreasonable ones...
you want me to order the archdiocese to ordain a woman?
we are simply asking you to deny their tax-exempt status if they continue to discriminate.
ms. Schmidt, the first amendment to our constitution has something in it called - the establishment clause. - Yes, I've read in your honor, I would refer you to the case against Bob Jones University, where a religious institution does not allowing terracial dating or marriage, and so they were denied tax exempt status.
Bob Jones was sued as a school, not a church.
they were sued as a religious educational institution.
there are many religions that restrict the priesthood, counsel
orthodox Judaism, Islam, Mormonism, orthodox Christianity.
and if they do so solely on gender, they're committing a civil rights violation.
well, have you got a witness?
Yes, I'm so glad you asked. Renee.
you're going to like her.
God beckoned me.
hello. My name's Katie Lloyd. This is Jerry Espenson.
hello. Welcome.
well, thank you for coming in.
I'm sure you can guess what's on my mind.
we can.
good. Here's the offer--she tells us who runs the ring, agrees to give testimony against this individual or individuals, we'll dismiss the charges and give her transactional immunity.
I'd first need to see a copy of the incident report together with a proffer of your agent's testimony so we can know what we're dealing with in the way of evidence.
no problem. We'll get that to you right away.
thank you.
it doesn't strike meas airtight.
the language is ambiguous.
no sex actually transpired. - Lorraine.
I don't see how I can recommend anything other than she accept this offer.
otherwise, she's looking at jail.
and if she does take the deal...
well, it's not like I never thought this day could come.
may I ask why?
you've established yourself as a first-rate attorney.
why continue with this brothel business?
I did get out for a while. - And?
I missed it.
what do you mean," it's on "?
I got past round one.
and what's round two?
we meet with a bunch of donors, test the waters to see if we can raise money.
can you imagine? - No.
Denny, would you even want to be president?
think of it, you and I on the oval office balcony, scotch, cigars, maybe even an intern.
Denny, your balcony days would be over.
there'd be sniper assassins to worry about.
Oh, please. Look, I know it's not really gonna happen. I'm not kidding myself.
But?
but just to be considered, to be on the short list, even for a day, that's something to tell your grandchildren.
I may have a few, by the way. You should check on that.
we are. We'd need to do a background check on you as well.
me?
you're his best friend. We'd need to vet all of his
if you've gotten this far, you've already vetted me.
will you get serious?
to think I could have my finger on the button...
my own nuclear bomb.
you want to withdraw because your advice would be to take the deal, and you don't want to act agains Lorraine's interests.
basically, yes.
well, I don't want the deal.
you don't have to do this for me.
I'm not doing it for you.
when I made my choice to go into this profession, I did so without shame.
I reject the notion that it's immoral, and I won't be judged for it, especially by you.
you'll be judged by the law, Dana, which criminalizes
a law which is as unreasonableas it is archaic, and I'd like to challenge it.
you can't mean that.
I do mean that.
is there a mechanism for challenging the validity of the law itself?
well, our best bet would be to get the matter certified to the Massachusetts supreme judicial court and
that's what I want to do.
we'll take our shot here and then decide...
please stop looking at me like I'm a sexual deviant.
could you do that, Jerry?
but you are a sexual deviant, Dana.
you engage in sexual conduct for a fee.
that's as deviant as it is immoral.
I do judge you, and I'll ask you to stop looking at me for either approval or sympathy.
pending a motion before the S.J.C. should we lose, you can expect to be formally charged tomorrow.
okay.
I'd like you to argue it, Jerry.
me? Why?
please.
hello. - Denny.
hello. Pick a card, any card.
we could meet after work, have a wine spitzer.
had six wives.
none of them understood me.
many of the church's doctrines have nothing to do with divine law.
for example?
well, celibacy F. one priests were not required to be celibate until 1139, before which they were allowed to have families, usually quite large.
celibacy was a functionof economic pragmatism, not divine law.
I would probably not be celibate.
I am sexually rambunctious.
and may I ask, is this something that's important to you?
Yes.
when I was young, people considered me off.
I was shunned, ostracized.
as you can see, it's still very difficult for me to talk about it now.
the Catholic church reached out to me.
they were a source of great comfort.
I would like to extend the tolerace and compassion to others that was so greatly afforded to me in my time of...
I apologize.
I didn't mean to get emotional.
what are you doing?
here, take a look at this if I did run, I couldn't lose.
look at her eyes. Mad cow, man.
Oh, come on.
what else could it be?
makes sense. I'm pretty sure Bill's got it.
could be post-traumatic stress.
remember the Whitewater rafting trip with Kenneth Starr?
and she took a lot of sniper fire in Bosnia, bullets sailing over her head as she ran for cover.
surprising Bill in the oval office-- that had to be some shock and awe.
her problem with Bill is she isn't pretty enough.
she needs to be prettier, like him.
you think he's pretty? - What? What are you talking about?
he used to be Whitney Houston.
what about Mccain? You'd first have to get by him.
please. Mccain is patient zero, mad cow.
he can't remember anybody he's met before, so he calls everybody his friend.
U know, my friends-- thank you all, my friends.
my friends--my friends-- my friends-- that tonight, my friends
well, my friends-- so, my friends-- so, my friends...
they want me to take a physical before I meet with the donors.
I'm sorry?
the, uh, search committee.
they want me to take a physical to make sure I'm healthy. Oh, please.
I can kick Mccain's ass, Obama's, too.
hillary I'm not sure of.
so what, you have to go to one of their doctors?
on the Q.T. at the avalon.
and that's where the meeting with the donors is.
how could they possibly take it this far?
I'm a wanted man, Alan. Wanted.
you expect me to overturn the law against prostitution in the common wealth?
Yes, your honor.
or in the alternative, schedule a hearing before the full supreme judicial court to determine whether the statute is arbitrary, unreasonable, and therefore unconstitutionalon its ass，face.
okay, why don't you start by telling me why it's unreasonable?
gladly.
it's estimated that legalizing prostitution would decrease the rape rate in this country by 25%.
that alone should merit the court's consideration.
moreover, criminalizing prostitution doesn't make it go away.
it just renders it more dangerous.
why not regulate the profession?
employ and ensure safety measures that would reduce the risk of A.I.D.S. and S.T.D.S.
we could also ensure that the women are less exploited, be it with insurance befits
I am offended by the idea that this doesn't victimize women.
it's legal in Nevada...
what isn't in Nevada? - And Rhode island, Canada...
this is an issue for the legislature...not the court. - Many, many countries...
argentina, australia, England, Brazil... - I don't care what other countries do.
new zealand, Norway, Peru, Ireland, Italy, Germany... - we do not follow, we lead...
and we certainly do not conform our moral code to coincide--- Greece, Iceland, Mexico, Switzerland. Let me finish!
who are you looking to protect?
my investigators have seen you with Ms. Strickland.
Hey, you want to go after me, sweetheart? Take your shot.
I will go after you if you have broken the law.
your honor, this law is about posing a morality.
what's more, it doesn't work.
prostitution exists. It always will.
driving it underground makes it more dangerous.
it establishes a base camp, if you will, for organized crime, for other criminal enterprises, including the child sex trade, slave trafficking
he is talking in circles.
how about we take this money earmarked for prosecutions and dedicate it to A.I.D.S. Awareness, sex education?
25% of American female teenagers between 14 and 19 now have some form S.T.D.
meanwhile, we see more and more abstinence programs popping up, schools forbidden to talk about condoms. That's what's criminal.
and legalizing prostitution will end up with fewer prostitutes in the morgue.
and given that it's a multi-billion-dollar industry anyway, why not tax it?
why not use it to help build the hospitals and schools that politicians promise to deliver, but never get around to cause many of them are too busy hanging out with hookers?
we could use that money, Judge. We're in a war. We have a deficit.
billions of dollars--why give it to criminals when we can use it to support our troops?
trump card! I said it.
support our troops. I win!
thank you.
may I ask what you're doing here?
Denny invited me.
don't worry. I won't tell. I'm very loyal to the party.
of course, one might question your loyalty offering Denny Crane as a presidential candidate.
you think it's my idea?
my only hope is that these people come to their senses.
on the other hand, John Mcsnore doesn't win the logic prize either.
where is Denny?
I believe he's getting his physical.
so you weren't told to bring your records?
why don't you just take my blood pressure, and let's get on with this?
I took your blood pressure, Mr. Crane.
that was not a polygraph.
now you'll need an E.K.G. - What for?
to check your heart.
it's to make sure that you don't keel over and die.
Oh, Judas Priest.
we certainly teach that men and women are equal.
but...
but they have different roles that are divinely best owed.
this is an authoritarian teaching called complementarity.
Complementarity?
Yes. It's not sexism.
we believe in the plan of god.
men and women complement each other, and thereby occupy different positions.
separate but equal?
spend a day with the nuns.
you might conclude they're a little more equal.
that would be funny...
if it wasn't sexist.
women can head state and national and International Catholic Institutions.
but when it comes to being a priest...
that role is reserved for men.
you realize, Your Holiness, that a majority of Catholicisim this country now favor women in the priesthood?
we don't modify doctrine to comply with opinion polls.
Oh, come on. Sure you do.
the church once defended slavery as willed by god you modified that doctrine.
then there was the persecution of witches, you know, with the big rocks...
torture.
and let's not forget the crimes of the inquisition.
all of those were Catholic church doctrines adjusted according to popular opinion.
and let's not forget that you once condemned homosexuality as an intrinsicand moral evil, but--Oh, wait.
that one still stands.
your Holiness, I have great respect and well, appreciation for the Catholic church.
how could I not? After all, I'm a Jew.
you made one of ours almighty.
but this woman thing...
the truth is, in many cities, women are being secretly ordained by Roman Catholic, male bishops who believe it is the right thing to do.
those bishops do soat the risk of excommunication.
even the mere mention of- - Wait a second.
so one could have a glorious Catholic career, rise to the position of bishop, yet, if you are to so much as whisper, " Hey, maybe women should be ordained,
you'd be excommunicated?
it sounds like...
somebody somewhere has got something against women.
I find you attractive.
why couldn't we do this at a regular doctor's office?
you're asking the wrong person.
all I was told is, it's security, and we need to set up separate facilities in here.
why you people have to be so damn secretive is beyond me. In here.
surprise!
gotcha, Denny. Gotcha.
ladies and gentlemen...
I give to you the next president of the United States-- Denny Crane!
so... this is a joke?
Mike Brady came up with the idea, it just took on a life, and--and we figured, why not make a party out of it?
so I--I'm--I'm not really running for president?
may I have your attention, please?
I'm special HNT Jo Sharpe of the Fedal Bureau of Investigation.
I need you all to get down on your knees and put your hands on top of your heads, now.
what's going on?
do it now, sir.
this is a roomful of lawyers, you know
sir, I'm running this party now.
you're all under arrest for theft by false pestens. - What?
we have been informed of a fund-raising scheme intended to raise sums of money for an individual fraudulently posing as a presidential candidate.
no. no, no, no, no, no.
sir, down on your knees, please.
look, we're not really asking for money.
it's a practical joke.
we're all in on it.
I'm--I'm not in on it.
a practical joke?
Yes, on this man--Denny Crane.
he was the one deceived. Nobody's actually being solicited for money. No transaction
is this true, sir? Are they all in on it?
I don't know. I-I can't believe that Harry Beckett is in on it.
and Sandra Cook? She hasn't got a mean bone in her body.
Mitch. You were at all six of my weddings.
all these people--they know me, we go way back
and they of all people should know...
that you can't get the master.
you all have the right to remain silent.
you have all been had by Mr. Denny Crane.
what? - what?
maestro.
amateurs, all of ya.
what's the matter, Paul? You don't look so good.
start the party.
what's up?
we lost.
evidently, the judge didn't go for the idea of using prostitution to fund the war.
so we go to trial.
your arraignment is scheduled for tomorrow at 9: 00 A.M.
and my chances of winning?
not great.
Dana, you do have to consider this deal they're offering.
can I talk to Jerry for a minute? - Certainly.
I'm sorry. I spun a little out of control in my argument.
I didn't really expect to win, Jerry.
the reason, uh, I even wanted to try, the reason I specifically wanted you to argue...
I read of the, uh, the phenomenon where lawyers invariably come to believe in the merits of their arguments.
I wanted you to believe...
that I'm not a criminal.
I wanted you to be convinced that I'm not amoral.
because I want desperately to get back with you.
is that a possibility?
okay.
well, uh... I...
I guess I'll, uh, I'll see you in court then.
your honor, the plaintiff is asking you to invalidate church law on the grounds that it's unreasonable.
this is religion, for god sake.
we don't hold religion and faith up to standards of reasonableness.
why shouldn't we?
does it really make sense that god got mad at the human race and drowned them all, including children and all the animals except two of each, which survived on a big boat?
do Christians literally believe the earth was made in seven days?
Religion--some of it is out there.
but we have the right to believe in what we choose.
that's the point of the establishment clause.
one of the many reasons Aamerica came into being was so that we as a people could be free to practice the religion of our choice.
now one doesn't have to love the tenants of Catholicism.
ms. Winger is certainly free to choose another faith.
but paramount to the Catholic religion is a male priesthood.
it's not just the Catholics.
orthodox Judaism segregates men and women in the synagogue.
girls have to sit in the back or the balcony.
they also don't allow women to be rabbis.
Islam--forget about it.
they don't even let women show their faces.
the ugly fact is that we're okay with bigotry in this country as long as it's cloaked in faith.
and the prejudice isn't limited to women.
you think we'll ever eliminate gay bashing while giving tax breaks to institutions who declare that homosexuality is a moral sin, an evil?
whether it's persecution of the Christians in ancient Rome or the holocaust during world war II or Bosnia today, where we have an ethnic genocide in progress, religion has a mean legacy.
this isn't about Bosnia.
why would you have to travelthe globe to make a point, Mr. Sack, if your argument held water here at home?
you want me to keep it local? Fine with me.
pat Robertson. He's a popular guy.
he referred to presbyterians and episcopalians and methodists as the spirit of antichrist.
he's also rumored to have blamed Katrina on the fact that Ellen Degeneres--a lesbian-- lived in new Orleans.
Jerry Falwell said that 9/11 happened because of god's wrath against homosexuals.
I'm a spiritual man.
I go to temple. I pray. I believe in god.
the Catholic church, denying the priesthood to women, is guilty of gender bias.
simple as that.
it should stop.
and there goes my humanit as award.
Jerry. She didn't show.
excuse me?
Dana. She skipped arraignment. There's a warrant out for her arrest.
did she say anything about this to you?
no. She just said good-bye.
well, she's...
Dana Strickland seems to have disappeared, Lorrine. Would you know anything that?
no.
wouldn't have facilitated her fleeing the jurisdiction, by chance?
that would make mean accomplice to a crime.
I-I simply have to know.
did you know right from the beginning?
you had me for about an hour.
your problem is, I know Chris Andrews, insider.
he and Dick Cheney shoot lawyers together.
one phone call, I knew what you were up to.
when are you gonna learn, Paul? You can't fool...
did you bring my money?
thank you, Paul.
and thank you for going to the great lengths you did, along with all those other people, to try and humiliate me.
really made me feel good.
you know, Denny, I didn't really intend for it to come off as mean-spirited.
as it did.
see you, Paul.
I'm a lucky man, huh?
practical jokes are very complicated.
some of the mere mean-spirited, but typically, there is affection involved, too.
they're not played on enemies. They're played on friends.
with friends like that...
you're a successful, powerful man of whom many people are probably jealous.
as strong as friendship is, maybe it's no match for envy.
I gotta keep reminding myself as important here.
which is?
they didn't get me.
I got them.
Yes, you did.
Ah, all right.
I must confess, every time I hear some feminist complaining about women's rights,
I mutter to myself, " oh, go to hell.
last night, I did a dream-- that I've had before, mind you.
I arrive at the pearly gates, I'm introduced to god.
she's a woman.
she stands there with her arms folded, and she asks, "and where did you stand on women's rights, Your Honor?
and then she says, " go to hell.
catholic people are tolerant and intelligent, and I believe they would be open to this.
and I also agree that if the church is going to discriminate, the government should at least not incentivize their bigotry with tax breaks.
if we the people are sincere about eliminating discrimination in this country, we can't tolerate it anywhere, even if it comesin religious form.
judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
adjourned.
well, congratulations. Expect an appeal.
I am simply wrought. Never did I...
I'm sorry. I need a moment to collect myself.
take your time.
can you imagine, Denny...
if you were to lead this country?
Wh--we'd have air force one at our disposal-- my own personal mile high club
hit Vegas for the night, Copenhagen, Bangkok.
gotta love a place that calls itself "Bangkok.
make you ambassador.
Denny, you make me laugh.
Yeah, I know this sounds crazy, but I think I'd make a fine president.
what would you actually do if you were commander in chief?
I'd, uh, stop outsourcing to the Chinese, drop a few bags of grain on Africa.
is that where they're starving?
there are too many other places.
I'd add France to the axis of evil. Have they done that?
matter of time.
then...
I'd invite Hillary in to the oval office...
give her a little taste of honey.
that's vulgar.
well, what do you want in a president?
Oh, I don't mean politically. I know where you stand on the issues.
but what do you want in the person?
well, one who could reestablish some of the dignity to the office.
that would be a good start.
dropping trou for Hillary wouldn't do the trick.
Ah, I was just kidding. Sort of.
you know what I really think of America right now, Denny?
Oh, here we go.
I don't mean simply its politics, but our culture.
we've become such a dumb, fat, bubblegum nation, schlocky and superficial
our music, books, television.
one of the heads of NBC recently said that the plan was to get people to tune in and mentally tune out.
and this wasn't an admission, by the way, but a boast.
you're starting to bore me.
is it any wonder that we have a television show called "are you smarter than a second grader?" And a president that isn't?
I so miss a little...
dignity in America.
I suppose I most worry that if you ran for president, you might actually win.
that hurts. Coming from you?
if you stopped all your nonsense, perhaps you'd be a great leader, but, Denny, I don't want you to stop your nonsense.
who would I have to play with?
who would I have to sit on this balcony with every night?
so you wouldn't bevoting for me.
probably not. I'm too selfish.
plus you...
well, no offense, but it--I think your generation made America into what it is today.
it's time for it to be inherited by your children.
I think you need to hand over the keys to the car to their leader. It's time.
well, maybe I could be president for the day.
knock over Cuba, grab the cigars, bomb Iran, then resign.
there you go.
that'd be a day, wouldn't it?
Cuba in the morning, Iran before lunch-- after a matinee with Hillary, maybe a-a threesome with Ginsburg. They both want me.
step down at 4: 00.
on the balcony here at 5: 00 for a nightcap with you.
that'd be a hell of a day. Then go fishing.
I'll drink to that.
you'll drink to anything.
you and me, right here. I drink to that.
king for a day.
Hi, I'm Brad chase from D. C. / Hi.
I think that's my seat.
I'm sorry. We're not territorial about that sort of thing around here, are we?
I was handling it. - I just thought I'd help out.
that's very nice, but again, I was handling it.
so why does it bother you that I'm trying to help?
wait a minute.
you two have had sex.
we can't tail the wife.
Ernie Dell is one of our biggest clients.
if he wants a private investigator, what's the real harm?
I'm the one sleeping with his wife.
I'm sorry? / Sure.
he makes fun of me. but I'm a big fan of your aqua velva commercials.
no, it's not right. He calls me a Ken doll, while he...
plays with your barbie?
completely mindful of the fact that you helped build this place, the partners here will not allow you to dismantle it with your buffoonery.
they're not going to take the firm from you.
I'm not worried, Lori. Do I look worried?
look out there.
my domain.
my city.
I'm Denny crane.
you have 30 minutes.
I have to say, I find this very strange.
I always thought I'd be the one visiting you in the mental hospital.
I'm excited about tomorrow.
please tell me we have a shot.
I don't know how much longer I can take it in here.
we have a shot.
I'll get you out.
I don't need to hear it, Alan. I need it to happen.
the board will question you directly.
it's entirely possible they'll try to provoke you.
to make sure I'm bombproof?
sorry? / It's an expression with horses.
to be safe to ride, a horse needs to be bombproof.
it doesn't spook easily.
can't have one who just flies off.
Yes, in addition to not flying off, you need to show contrition.
they like to see that you're sorry.
I am.
I, I am so sorry, so deep, deeply ashamed.
how do I say it right?
just like that.
you were in love with a man who was unworthy of you, who made you doubt everything that you had a right to count on, who perhaps even toyed with your sanity.
still no excuse for trying to kill him.
perhaps he had it coming.
perhaps you did.
why is it we agreed to bifurcate the trial?
there's been no claim for punitive damage, only compensatory, but our fear was a jury could be so outraged, they might artificially inflate compensatories as a de facto puni, so we opted to bifurcate.
separate juries, one for liability, one for damages.
the client concurred.
do you do tongue push-ups?
this is a staff meeting.
I encourage all to conduct themselves professionally, keeping in mind that remarks are tantamount to assertive conduct.
Lansing vs. Mahoney...
hospital settled out, deposition of Dr. Mahoney is today, we're hoping to make some movement on that as well.
lot of eyes are on us.
we've got an HMO on the bubble here waiting to see how this lawsuit is restored.
I assume you've prepared for today's deposition.
actually, Denny's taking it.
Denny's taking the deposition?
Yes.
wouldn't it be better to save Denny for trial, - roll out the big gun later? - Roll out the big gun now, this won't be a trial.
move along, Paul.
in re Christine Polley...
mine.
ex-girlfriend tried to kill me.
this is the commitment proceeding?
she was committed. This hearing is to secure her release.
wait a second. She tried to kill you.
she did. - And now she wants out.
she does. / And you're trying to help her get out.
I am.
you're angry with me.
I'm just busy, okay?
I'm not gonna even discuss the absurdity of representing an ex-lover who tried to kill you, but how do you not at least tell me?
that isn't something that I should know?
I wanted to surprise you with it.
do you think it's funny?
do you think it's appropriate for me to learn about it in a staff meeting?
forgive me. As you can imagine, I haven't kept up with...the boyfriend/girlfriend regulations.
what I can say is she's a client, and a friend...
that I'm trying to free from the clutches of an overreaching asylum.
you keep calling it an asylum.
this is a psychiatric hospital.
I mean no disrespect, doctor, but the word "hospital" implies treatment.
and she has gotten treatment.
is she less crazy? - Excuse me?
as a result of your treatment, is she less crazy?
crazy is not a medically recognized term, Mr. Shore.
as I've just explained,
Christine has what the DSM refers to as intermittent explosive disorder.
then please tell us. is she less intermittently explosive?
she has improved.
and to what do you attribute that?
primarily the pharmacological regimen. / Pills.
25 milligrams each of three different anti-psychotics administered three times daily.
then maybe it's a good thing she's here.
that sounds like a very complicated protocol to administer on one's own.
indeed.
how do you know she actually takes these pills?
obviously, we keep very careful records.
I'm sure you do.
but hypothetically, suppose there was a patient who felt she didn't belong here, felt that she'd entered your hospital quite troubled, but essentially sane, and was being driven insane by this institution.
maybe she's a New York university graduate, a respected attorney, a charming, intelligent, sensitive, funny woman.
a fully functional person with the exception of one incident.
so each and every time your orderlies come around with your 75 milligrams of powerful anti-psychotics for her to swallow, she hides the tablets under her tongue and saves them.
day after day, a growing collection of thoroughly unnecessary medication that her primary psychiatric caregiver wants to shove down her throat.
are you asking if this hypothetical scenario could happen?
I am.
it could not.
we keep very careful records.
look, I don't see why I need to be present.
a part of her emotional distress claim goes to how you informed her of her husband's death.
I've been a surgeon for 30 years.
if there's a pleasant way to tell a family a patient died...
we're gonna need your response to her account.
we're in conference room one. We'll be right in.
thank you.
don't look at him.
why can't I just review the transcript? I really don't want to sit in that room.
we don't need you to do or say anything.
we just need you to sit there and listen.
Brad, one second, please.
excuse me. / Yeah.
you can't let him first-chair this deposition.
Paul, he's insisting. / First of all, the case could turn on this proceeding, and second, as I mentioned, we have several medical corporations, potential clients, taking a keen interest... / Hey.
guys.
what are we talking about?
looks interesting from afar. Anything I might enjoy?
what's this case about, Denny?
the deposition you're about to conduct, what's it about again?
a man died during angioplasty, leaving him dead, tragic.
he even described the procedure as common, so for...
one of your allegations goes to how Dr. Mahoney informed you of the tragic outcome.
he just came out and said my husband had a cardiac arrest and was dead.
he just turned and walked away.
but he said he was going to talk to me later.
do you make room for the possibility that dr. Mahoney himself was devastated at this time?
the patient was my husband.
whatever pain he had...
these are difficult questions.
you're, um...
40 pounds lighter since before your husband's death?
Yes.
dating again? / Objection.
this certainly has no relevance.
all objections have been waived till the trial, except for the form of the question, sport.
this your first deposition? - This is not my first deposition.
well, then play by the rules.
don't make me move for costs, which she'll end up paying.
in this last year, would you say you've had more or less sex since the time of your husband's...
Objection! / All right, this is a tough deposition for everybody.
let's just try to get through it. Denny.
more or less sex this past year?
my physical relationship with my husband had waned, partly because of his heart condition.
we remained very much in love.
and did you go on lots of trips together, you and your husband?
some.
he was very busy with work.
did he regularly tell you how incredibly...
incredibly beautiful you are?
did you wear this perfume when your husband was alive?
I believe I did. - That's magnificent.
all right. This deposition is over. - Why?
it's over. Come on, Carrie.
off to court we go, Cub scout.
Oh, we'll be going into court, all right.
we're done here.
the fact that she was secretly refusing to take her medication does not persuade us of progress.
but it does show she's capable of going six months unmedicated without incident.
Mr. Shore, you were her lover.
any bias I might have in favor of Christine would be more than offset by the fact that she tried to kill me.
frankly, we're insulted by that. It might get you a spot on "Good morning America," but...
I'm trying to get her a spot of freedom.
freedom is a privilege, Mr. Shore, not a right.
a privilege? - Yes, and it's revocable, especially if you try to run someone over with an automobile.
Christine Polley is well.
you have an affidavit from three independent psychiatrists who evaluated her.
likely made her sign waivers as soon as you paid them.
the only reason you're holding her is you're afraid of being sued should she do something.
we're afraid she'll hurt herself or someone else, you cynical snot.
is liability to the hospital a factor? Yes.
we can't treat patients out of bankruptcy.
I hardly see how that makes me a snot.
she's in here because of one isolated incident she's not likely to repeat.
Oh, you can gaze into some crystal ball...
I can gaze into her.
I saw the look in her eyes the day she was brought here.
I saw the look in her eyes which led to her being brought here.
she had that look then.
she does not have it now.
who would be this woman's guardian?
why is no one here to present...
her parents would serve as guardians.
you'll find their affidavits. - They live in Illinois.
where Christine would be going upon release.
and until she gets to Illinois?
until then, I will be her guardian.
well, at the risk of also sounding biased,
I agree with him.
this is not a parole board.
this is not a prison.
as you say, Dr. Gill, this is a hospital, and when patients are healed, they're let out of hospitals.
coffee not good?
Oh, no, it's, I was just thinking about something.
Yeah, I do that.
thinking about what?
that's kind of private.
you know, I'd stake out a little distance from that Shore guy, Sally.
he tends to leave people's minds a little worse off than he finds them.
his old girlfriend, case in point.
you two discussing cases?
I wasn't aware you provided emotional counsel as well as legal, Lori.
that's quite a perk.
a woman tries to kill you, you go to represent her.
you don't think there's a pathology at play here?
I referred to yours. - I got the reference, thank you.
speaking as an enormously unlikable person,
I find it difficult to maintain grudges against all those who want to kill me, don't you?
Yes, you'll perhaps find that witty comeback in your office.
he's got a motion for costs, for sanctions, he has ordered a transcript so he can read back to the judge what you said today.
good. Then I won't have to bother trying to remember.
damn it, Denny, you're way out of the line.
this woman has just lost a husband.
you're asking her questions about her sex life, her perfume?
I know what I'm doing. - Which is?
it'll come to me.
that lawyer is going to pick you apart in open court tomorrow.
let him try. Denny Crane.
listen to me.
do you know why I was brought here?
the firm thinks that you are becoming a liability.
they wanted me to control you.
who thinks I'm a liability?
it doesn't matter.
who?
you were once something to aspire to.
you're now becoming something to parody.
you walk around saying "Denny crane, Denny crane" like it's supposed to intimidate or conjure up awe.
you're a complete joke.
if that gets me fired, so be it. I'm saying it just the same.
you know why?
because I love you.
I adore you.
but it hurts to see you deteriorating into a...
get the hell out of my office.
you didn't have to get me a hotel room.
I didn't. You're staying in my place.
I beg your pardon? - I won't get fresh.
you live in a hotel? / I do.
what happened to your big, grotesque house with your more grotesque swimming pool and your even more grotesque rumpus room?
I sold it.
I require a lot of fresh towels and nightly turndown service.
why would you live in a ho...
Oh, I, I see.
the comfort of being able to check out on a whim.
you know, as much as you've explained it, you've never really explained it.
I demand only one thing in a relationship, Christine, that I remain utterly alone.
nice out, Alan. / I'm sorry?
even in conversation, you always have a nice out.
I did my best to control him.
and the other attorney has brought a motion for sanctions?
which he wants to argue himself.
Oh, my god.
we count on you to help prevent these kinds of situations, Brad.
Paul, I'm a relatively junior partner.
what exactly do you expect me to do?
if that man gets up in open court... - Excuse me.
the man can still handle himself in court.
Oh, please. The only possible good that could come from his...
is he adamant about arguing this himself?
I'm afraid so.
well...
I guess we can't say no.
his name is still first on the letterhead.
let him argue.
we're up early.
I've been up since 6: 00, actually.
I've been waiting for you to get up so I could say goodbye.
there's a cab outside waiting.
I thought your flight's at 11: 00.
I'm going to the airport early.
ridge upped the security to level mauve.
let me drive you. / No.
I, I'd prefer to...
thank you for getting me out, for forgiving me.
well...
that's it. Creep.
better go.
call me when you land.
I just think I should argue it.
why, so you can control me? Nobody controls me.
Denny, you're the subject of the hearing.
I'm certainly going to have more objectivity than...
I'll argue the motion.
when Denny crane gets attacked, he stands up for himself.
I don't need you or anybody else controlling or protecting me.
you're not going to court in this state. / Brad, you can join me or not.
your choice.
what's going on?
he still plans to argue it himself.
and the partner said let him. - I know, but I thought...
you know why they're saying let him?
a public debacle on record is just what they need to convince the full partnership in January to broom him.
what? / Yeah, they want him to self-destruct, Brad.
they obviously think losing a few clients is worth losing him.
you cannot let him argue this motion.
you're her guardian, and she slept in your hotel room last night.
you see, you get upset when I don't tell you these things, but then when I do,
she's gone to Chicago.
It's.../ It's not about her.
excellent. Then...
it, it's us.
is there an us? - Sally, I know this seems difficult.
you know what? You know what'll be fun?
can we go shopping for shoes or a new dress?
something revealing for the office party.
tight. / Alan.
what are you doing here? - My flight was canceled.
I thought you might feel like an early lunch.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. / Hi.
your flight was canceled.
I'm rescheduled at 4: 30.
this is why I've refused to fly for the past two years.
that, and I've been locked up.
so can I steal you for lunch? - Actually, no.
we were just about to go on... - It's okay, really.
very nice to meet you.
maybe I shouldn't have come.
truth is...
you weren't my first choice for lunch.
I called a few friends. Everybody seems to need a little distance.
it was all like, "oh, Christine, how nice to hear from you," and...
you're smart enough to expect that.
never got it from you.
are you and Sally... - We're seeing each other.
Oh.
she seemed nice. / She is.
certainly attractive. / There's that.
well...
it'll be easier when I get to Chicago, easier to start over there, I think.
I agree.
Yeah.
so...
lunch?
on your next visit.
well...
goodbye, then, again.
goodbye, Christine.
Denny, listen to me.
some of the partners are coming down to watch the motion, and not in support, Denny. They're hoping you crash in there.
they're hoping to be able to get some leverage to be able to say at the partnership meeting, "it's time to take Denny crane out of the game.
what game?
I don't know whether he was trying to humiliate her or hit on her.
it wasn't clear.
what was clear was the indecency of it.
this is what lawyering has degenerated to.
Carrie Lansing lost her husband, he's probing her about her sex life.
it was a blatant abuse of our process.
it was an embarrassment to the integrity of our profession.
this attorney should be sanctioned severely, your honor.
a message has to be sent to the bar that our bar is raised higher than an episode of reality television.
Denny Crane demeaned Carrie Lansing, he demeaned our court system, and he should be dealt with.
Denny, I have a good feel for this. Can I take it?
I'll take it.
this is, um, pretty powerful stuff.
I can see Mr. Ripley's a very powerful man.
and that's a big thing with lawyers, isn't it? Power.
the fear of feeling weak.
I've seen it before. Attorneys coming up against Denny crane.
they jump, and stomp, and shake their fists, and bellow with impassioned rage.
makes quite a demonstration, doesn't it?
but when you cut through to the merits, this lady has alleged in her complaint loss of consortium, legal terms meaning sex and affection.
and if she's enjoying sex and affection, it's relevant. It's a mitigating factor.
I'm entitled to explore it.
Mr. Ripley may not like it, but it's legitimate.
and, I may add, that I conducted my probe in the relative privacy of a closed conference room.
Mr. Powerful man made it much more public with his impassioned chest-thumping in a courtroom.
I object to this. / Oh, go ahead and pound the table.
I'll tell you what I object to.
we have an offer on the table that you so love to pound.
an offer I can't discuss because the settlement talks have been sealed.
suffice to say it is on the high side, the extreme high side, considering the fact that liability is not certain.
Mr. Lansing had a preexisting heart condition.
but instead of taking the offer, powerful guys like Mr. Ripley wanna go to trial. Why?
because I'm the opponent.
it's a coup to beat the big guy.
well, what if you don't?
you demean the profession, Mr. Powerful guy.
you're using your client to get a notch.
you're making Carrie Lansing go through the ordeal of a trial for your own ego.
Objection! / A trial you may lose, in which case, she gets nothing.
Objection! / Oh, but if you're loud enough,
Objection! / forceful enough and strong enough, she may never realize that you blew it.
funny.
you'd like me to feel threatened, wouldn't you?
I may not be able to talk as fast, but my tongue is certainly more versatile.
you disapprove of me.
and that warms my cockles.
I'm afraid something's come up. - Oh, don't tell me.
her flight left an hour ago. She's gone.
so...
shopping.
maybe not shoes...
but something...
slippery to perhaps slide out of later.
I'm not that easy.
well, I am.
do you feel responsible for her being in there?
I certainly was a precipitating factor.
is she well now?
I think so.
but perhaps I'm inclined to believe that.
you might come to value my latitude on these matters somewhat more fully on the day you try to kill me.
I miss you.
I have a friend who has this amazing house in Vermont.
maybe for Columbus weekend, we could sneak up there.
I love Vermont.
would you allow me to cover your body in maple syrup?
excuse me.
where did she stay? - I have no idea.
I wouldn't even know where to go look for her.
well, she clearly knows where to look for you.
Alan, she is stalking you. - She's not...
crazy? She tried to kill you, she was institutionalized, now she's out, and she's stalking you.
you said that you were her legal guardian.
it's a technicality.
well, you may have certain rights to have her recommitted.
she hasn't done anything to warrant that.
at the very least, you could get a restraining order.
there's nothing to warrant that, either.
do you really want to wait till there is?
you hear?
he won the motion and settled the case.
you must be disappointed.
I know what you were hoping for, Paul.
let me tell you something, my friend.
I have loved and admired Denny Crane a lot longer than you have.
we all want him to be great.
if you loved him, you wouldn't have ordered his demise to be public.
Hey.
Hey.
plaintiff lost his motion for sanctions, accepted our offer.
case is over, settled, done.
I heard.
Denny, you did an incredible job.
I think you turned his own client against him in there.
is that what you think?
am I now to put stock in what you think?
Denny, I just came here to congratulate you.
I don't need your praise.
hardware. Trunks full of praise.
Denny.../ I want your respect.
I'm senior partner.
respect goes with the job.
not to mention I've earned it.
I've earned it.
don't you think I feel the wagons circling?
now comes the plaintiff.
hereinafter, the alleges and charges as follows.
count one, on September 11th in the year of our lord...
I'm so, so sorry.
I came to see you last night, only... - why did you not go to Chicago?
I decided to collect a few letters of recommendation before I leave.
if I'm going to try... - You could do that by phone.
I could, and I planned to, but Bernie Levinson, senior partner at my old firm, insists on meeting me in person.
evidently, he wants to be sure I'm not nuts.
so I'm seeing him at 2: 00, I fly out at 6: 00.
all right, so...
why'd you come to find me last night?
you weren't picking up your cell, and...
Alan, I'm so sorry. I had no idea you were on a date.
I shouldn't have come at all.
I, I realized that. I left as soon as I saw the expression on your face and...
I truly, truly apologize.
I have to be honest, Christine, it scared...
the hell out of me.
believe me, if I had thought for a second that you were on a date...
Sally, is it, is it serious?
I really don't want to talk about it.
may I ask why not?
we're friends, are we not? Good friends.
it's only natural for us to discuss our lives with each other.
I really don't want to talk about it.
are you embarrassed?
is this just some young thing you like to screw...
dinner and a quickie, something casual?
I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. I...
maybe I still do get pangs.
anyway, I, again, apologize for just showing up last night.
I think I will leave before this gets awkward.
why don't we rent a nice restaurant for these things?
because it's all about impressing the clients, who like to know that inflated fees buy fancy offices.
Hey, how you doing?
Brad. Just talking about you.
okay, we weren't.
Sally, would you dance with me?
well... / oh, that's right.
you're with big Al Tara.
I love to.
they make a lovely couple, and he's got a nice, tight ass, don't you think?
you think?
Oh.
something's come up.
nothing bad. It's great, actually, but I think I better discuss it with you in person.
can I steal two minutes?
I'm at an office party.
can you tell me about it over the phone?
I'd really prefer to do it in person.
Congratulations.
Denny, I... - I accept your congratulations.
don't linger like we're friends.
we used to be friends.
we used to sit out on balconies at night as kids and criticize each other's openings and closings.
remember those days, Denny?
when we were open to each other's criticism and candor?
"open" is a funny choice of word.
you're an out-in-the-open sort of fellow, Paul?
you know exactly what sort of fellow I am.
I'm still a good lawyer.
Yes, you are.
you remember Muhammad Ali's last fight?
we had ringside seats.
he lost so pathetically to Larry Holmes.
we were so crushed.
the tragedy that night, Denny, wasn't that he couldn't still box.
he could.
the tragedy was...
that he still thought he was Ali.
you're a good lawyer, my friend.
you're just not Denny Crane.
hanging out with all your friends?
whoever designed women's shoes...
may I?
nothing personal. It's a fetish.
your fingers are so...
Yes, thank you.
my uncle was a butcher.
don't you think Sally might object to this?
we're nonexclusive when it comes to feet.
Oh, dear, you have a bunion.
did you come in here for something?
why are you counseling Sally to distance herself from me?
there are happily ever after guys, and there are those who leave girls in a heap.
and I can tell the difference.
you speak from personal experience?
that's private.
then perhaps I should get to know you better and ask again.
and I'd love to.
but right now, I'm going to go dance with Sally.
this is nice.
I know a cozy little photocopying machine we could adjourn to.
you're expecting a visitor, remember?
she said it would take two minutes.
she's beautiful.
excuse me?
she's here.
and she's beautiful.
time me. Two minutes.
Christine, you look stunning.
well, I knew you were having a fancy party.
I didn't want to appear conspicuous, so I threw something on.
I see.
and what did you want to talk about?
well, can we go to your office? - I'd prefer not.
well, being that I just showed up at your date the other night,
I didn't want you to think I was following you.
you know I wouldn't do that, right?
what have you come to talk about, Christine?
my meeting with Bernie Levinson went incredibly well, and...
well, he's rehired me.
I can start as soon as Monday.
can you believe it?
what about Chicago?
the truth is I think I have a better chance at achieving normalcy in Boston.
I called Dr. Gill. He agreed, the less change, the better.
I can see him as an outpatient, and...
your guardians, your parents, are in Illinois.
I was released to you in Massachusetts.
I was afraid you'd freak if I told you this on the phone, or if you just ran into me at the courthouse.
this is why I wanted to give you the news in person.
okay.
it's truly fantastic news.
isn't it, Alan?
I got my old job back.
Yes.
it is.
pull the rabbit out of your hat.
that's the secret of both trial law and life.
rabbits... / Yeah.
ex-girlfriend tried to kill me.
she tried to kill you.
she did. - And now she wants out.
she does. / Alan.
she's stalking you. She tried to kill you, she was institutionalized, now she's out, and she's stalking you.
freedom is a privilege, Mr. Shore, not a right.
a privilege. - Yes, and it's revocable, especially if you try to run someone over with an automobile.
I got my old job back.
it's truly fantastic news, isn't it? Alan?
Yes.
why aren't you helping me?
Sally, I have a trial of my own beginning tomorrow, a rather big one.
but this is my very first trial.
you've certainly been to court before, I have no doubt.
motion practice. This is with a jury.
I don't, I don't think I'm ready.
look at me.
you trust me?
I do.
and because you trust me, you'll believe what I'm about to tell you.
I will.
that's all it is.
all what is?
trial law...
getting the jury to trust you so they'll believe what you tell them.
Really?
sincerity, Sally, once you learn to fake that, there'll be no stopping you.
Denny, we've got...
what's going on?
a little maintenance work, Paul.
wouldn't hurt you, by the way. You look like a prune.
we have the Kaneb meeting in 15 minutes.
excellent. Why do I care?
you care because this is the construction project that the entire firm has been working on for 18 months.
you care because Byron Kaneb cares, and he expects you to be present.
damn it, man, what have you done?
the needle broke.
not to worry, just let me remove it.
don't you touch me.
Mr. Crane, half the needle is still in your forehead.
just let me remove. - You're not touching me!
get Dr. Michaels back down here.
this is what happens when I let his kids cut their teeth on my head.
if I could just remove the needle... / Don't you touch me!
Denny, there's a needle in your head.
let him at least remove it.
get me Dr. Michaels!
I really don't need a second chair for this.
sexual harassment is a specialty of mine.
mine, too. / No doubt, but while your experience tends to be more hands-on, mine...
tends to be more wishful thinking.
not to mention, you ooze.
I ooze?
Yes, that certain something that subliminally champions misogyny.
you need me.
as much as I may want you, desire you, even.
I do not need you.
see that right there?
Ooze!
when can I dig my hole?
we're almost there, Byron.
don't tell me we're almost there, Paul.
we've been almost there for six months.
when will we be there?
city council agreed to the variance for the golf course on Monday.
now today we're expecting an answer from the redevelopment commission for the outdoor mall, and my sources say they're gonna rule in our favor.
what about the damn E. P.A?
the blue spotted salamander just got downgraded from endangered to threatened last week, so the marina looks like a go except for...
except for what?
it seems there's a river where some salmon spawn.
evidently, there's some environmental lawyer who's making a stink.
when you say stink...
he got a T. R.O.
a fish?
my city's being held up by a fish?
we are meeting the lawyer today.
we will make it go away.
do you plan to contribute, or are you simply assigned to mop up the ooze?
hello.
Oh, I've heard so much about you.
how are you?
fine, thank you.
if you'll excuse us, we're due in court. / Yes, I know.
I'm opposing counsel.
I beg your pardon?
what do you expect me to do?
I expect you to disqualify her. This is tantamount to stalking.
she got herself assigned to this case because I'm on it.
not to mention, as an officer of the court,
I question whether Ms. Pauley even has the capacity to trial case.
she was released from a mental facility last week.
certainly, counsel, if you wanna conflict out...
I can't conflict out.
I'm the only one who knows the case here.
ms. Colson was simply put on... - Ms. Pauley, what's going on?
of all the cases to start off with, you pick one against an ex-boyfriend you tried to kill?
actually, your honor, I didn't pick it.
my firm came to me. - Please, Christine...
because I used to date Mr. Shore, they thought I could shed some light on some of his procedural eccentricities, which I did.
since I also happen to have extensive experience in sexual harassment law, the senior parers asked me if I would first chair, I agreed.
we start at 11 A. M. - Your honor...
Mr. Shore, if you wanna conflict out, do so.
but I have no legal basis to disqualify Ms. Pauley.
may I speak with you alone, Alan?
no, you may not, Christine.
and if you choose to be on this case, please conduct yourself at arm's length and on the record.
it's just coincidence to you your first case out of the hospital.
I consider it a preposterous coincidence, you have no business trying a case.
but truth be told, the partners think. - I know you better than your partner.
how sad, you can't be happy for me. / I'm not happy.
clearly.
well, that seemed perfectly normal.
the D. A. offered three months suspended.
I think we should take it.
does it go on my record?
well, yes. - The answer's no.
Ramone... / I didn't do it.
I didn't take that wallet.
and as a matter of principle, I won't pretend that I took it.
they have an eyewitness.
look here, I might seem like some court-appointed charity case, but I'm an honest man. I don't steal.
and I won't agree to any plea that says otherwise.
Hi, Sally Heep.
I'm in litigation at the firm.
I know that.
you in court today, or... - No, but you are.
I'm here to observe your work, Ms. Heep.
good luck.
the lawyer who got the T. R.O.
on the Kaneb construction project...
Ah. Pay him out, Paul.
give him a bottle of scotch and some money to buy some more bus bench ADs.
he says he's your son.
it's true.
you're a lawyer now.
hey...
dad.
you got a needle in your head.
small accident. Not to worry.
son.
dad.
you're a lawyer now. That's how you greet people?
I had a one-night stand with his mother.
I paid for his education and so forth.
I did everything I could to be a good father.
when's the last time you saw him?
Oh, I don't know.
when he was 12?
we've offered several decent compromises. / And?
he just keeps on saying his name.
Oh, I'll talk to him.
how's my boy?
they don't really need to bug you with this, dad.
so, what's this all about, saving some fish?
well, see, your lawyers...
who are clearly very talented, persuaded a judge to eliminate the distinction between farmed salmon and wild salmon.
the president of the United states proposed eliminating that distinction.
Yes, I know. That's probably why the judge granted your motion.
see, dad, wild salmon are an endangered species.
the administration figures if you eliminate the distinction between farmed and wild, and count them both as one, the numbers would go up, and you could take them off the endangered list.
and that way, they can lift the environmental protections in place to protect them, which, of course, allows you to build more shopping malls.
well, son, look at the big picture.
if building this mall can save a species from becoming endangered, let's, by all means, do it.
I was vice president in charge of alternative investments.
and at the time of the affair, Mr. Ralston...
he was, and remains president of the firm.
this romantic affair lasted how long, Ms. Moore?
about nine months, at which point, I broke it off. / Because?
well, mainly because I was a married woman.
and I wanted to work things out with my husband.
I see.
and how did Mr. Ralston handle the breakup?
at first, I think, fine.
but then he would continue to try to get back together.
he would schedule lunches, meetings, ostensibly about business, only to pursue his romantic interests.
he started calling me after hours.
sometimes he would send flowers.
eventually, it got so bad I simply had to leave.
you went to another brokerage firm?
at a lesser position for less money.
there seemed to be a stigma about my departure.
I don't know, I...
maybe people thought that I had secretly been fired, I don't know.
what I do know is I was basically forced out of my job by his relentless unwelcome sexual advances.
thank you, Ms. Moore.
she looks demented.
leading up to your affair with my client, he made welcomed sexual advances?
well, not at first. I, I was a married woman.
but at some point, the advances became welcomed.
Yes.
a love affair then ensued? - Yes.
so I guess my client's strategy was " If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
a strategy you certainly ratified. - Well...
since dogged perseverance was rewarded the first time,
I guess it would be only natural for him to adopt that strategy again.
I may have sent mixed signals the first time, but I did no such thing this time.
when you left, did you tell prospective employers the reason?
no, I... / why not?
I suppose I feared that it wouldn't depict me in the best possible light.
I was a married woman having an affair. / Got it.
so, this stigma you refer to, people wondering whether you were fired or not.
that stigma was at least partly caused by your embarrassment over your own behavior, a married woman having an affair.
I suppose that's true. - Thank you, Ms. Moore.
I was reaching into my purse to get some change to feed the homeless.
that's when I saw him coming.
who?
him.
the guilty defendant sitting right there.
objection.
jury will disregard the reference to the defendant's guilt.
then what happened?
he reached into my purse, grabbed my wallet, started rifling through it.
what did you do?
I stood there, frozen.
I was shocked.
he started running away as he was rifling through it.
then he turns, and he's coming back.
then what happened?
I ran.
he started chasing me.
thank god he was tackled by some people.
I don't know what he might have done.
ms. White, are you absolutely sure that it was the defendant?
I can show you the pictures.
what pictures?
I have one of those little phone camera thingies.
I snapped his picture.
and you have them?
look.
you can see he's got the wallet.
you just let the pictures be introduced without so much as an objection.
well, I thought, um, the prosecution didn't know about it either.
so I couldn't claim unfair surprise.
could've gotten time to prepare a cross-examination, to research the photos for authenticity.
instead, you sat there quietly.
there's eyewitness testimony from the victim, a positive I. D. and pictures.
how do you plan to proceed now, Sally?
um...
my client wants to testify.
and say what?
um...
that he's innocent.
it's a fish, for god's sakes.
it's not just a fish.
it's a salmon, which the government is trying to wipe out.
now, look, I like to fish myself, catch and release, the whole shebang.
pull them in by the lip, throw them back out to prove you're humane.
you're mocking me. He's mocking me, dad.
you're a Crane. Get used to it.
we will go to court.
I love court.
look, Donny, you seem like a nice kid.
I have no doubt that you're a terrific attorney, but you are not him.
you're like a son to him, aren't you?
does he hug you much?
look, if this is about some score between you and the old man...
it's not about any score.
Hey, if you people want to go to court...
beat it, will you, Brad?
is it a score?
was I not there enough?
were you not there enough?
dad, I haven't seen you in 15 years.
I may not have had the time to give that most dads had, but I thought I was giving you something much more important.
money.
you gave me something even more important than that, dad.
you gave me the Crane legacy, and I fully plan on living up to it.
so...
I'll see you and your team in court.
at first, I saw it, but I didn't see it, if that makes any sense.
it took a few seconds to register.
what took a few seconds?
my wallet.
I lost it two days earlier and then I see it right there in her bag.
your wallet. - Yeah, this funky orange color.
it's not like there could be two of them, and I lost it on Washington, right where we were at, so I figured she stole it.
that woman stole my wallet.
so... / So I walked right up and snatched it back. Self-help.
you snatched back your own wallet. / Yes, I did.
and I hustled off, because truth be told, the woman looked a little vicious.
so what happened next?
well, I started to go through it to make sure it was mine, and as I was going through the inside, I saw...
Oh, my god, it's not my wallet.
it looked exactly like mine, but it wasn't.
truth is, I, I discovered later I'd left it in my car.
it was all a big mistake.
so I started to run back to return it, and she just took off, and I started chasing, yelling, " Lady, wait. I'm bringing it back,
I'm bringing it back."
then I got tackled, and here I am.
your witness.
so the wallet that you ripped out of Miss White's purse, the wallet that you just ran off with, you thought it was your own.
Yes, ma'am.
because it looked exactly like yours.
Yes, ma'am.
this one here.
when we broke up, it was because she felt committed to working things out with her family.
it wasn't that things were emotionally over between us.
she said that. / Yes.
and I suppose I felt, you know, when...
when two people love each other, you persevere through obstacles.
my so-called sexual harassment, it wasn't about sexual advances.
it was about getting her to be true to her feelings.
you were trying to show her that she felt like having sex with you.
please don't trivialize this.
I assure you, sir, I take it very seriously.
you say it's okay to harass women in the workplace so long as you love them.
I believed, and still believe, she was in love with me.
I see.
and she lacked the autonomy to make up her own mind. / Objection.
she lacked the mental capacity, perhaps, - to be truly happy without you. - Objection!
why is it some people just refuse to accept that it's over. / Objection!
I truly apologize.
for a second, I thought you were personalizing it, Alan, and I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you all right?
Yes.
it is ridiculous.
the stress of a trial a week out of the rubber room, going up against you.
why are you doing this?
I was always safe inside work, you know?
it was a little cocoon.
can you continue?
Oh, yes.
it's just a little...
again, I apologize for the outburst.
whatever you can do to keep it personal...
I'm sorry?
she's kind of been kicking our ass, Alan.
that's the first crack I've seen in her armor.
I'm not going to exploit her.
Alan, if you can't put your client's interests ahead of Christine's, then step aside.
let number two take over.
we now have to go to court?
no, we are confident we'll be able to handle this.
I hire one of the biggest law firms in Boston, definitely one of the most expensive, and I'm being neutralized by salmon man, who happens to be your son?
let me tell you something, Byron.
um, Brad Chase is one of our finest litigators.
he will handle this.
your honor, we've had meetings with the environmental protection agency.
they signed off on this already.
with all due respect, the E. P.A. gets steamrolled by the administration all the time.
no matter what anyone proposes these days, there's always somebody somewhere who jumps up and screams, " Woe, the environment."
now there's a word, your honor, a very simple word that describes what my clientis trying to do here.
please don't let the word be " progress."
how about "people"?
people？ / Yes.
we are trying to invest in the future of people.
creating jobs in a time of unemployment.
we're talking about over 1, 000 jobs.
we're talking about benefiting people below the poverty line.
we are talking about people hoping to educate their children, afford medical coverage, feed their families, basic human needs.
this man wants to put all that on hold because it inconveniences a fish.
well, first, this whole thing kind of goes to the farmed salmon issue.
the government is trying to count these genetically raised salmon as wild ones.
so they can take salmon off the endangered species list.
I get that. So what?
so what? / People judge, jobs, insurance, schoolbooks, food. People.
well, farmed salmon is terrible for people.
they're carcinogenic.
they don't even look like real salmon.
by the way, they're fed these little pellets to turn their meat red.
otherwise, it's this pallid white. - People, jobs, America first.
there's a rumor.
I can't give evidence on this, but there's a rumor that cattle they have to kill due to mad cow disease, they grind them up and then feed the meat to the farmed salmon.
objection, your honor.
there is nothing in the record that even remotely substantiates that.
counsel, the river in question only concerns wild salmon, so can we get off the farmed salmon?
we're talking about lifting the environmental protections on that river.
they're inflating the salmon count with the farmed numbers to get those protections lifted.
people, jobs, food chain.
Oh, yes, people and jobs.
wild salmon is a billion-dollar industry in this country alone.
once we destroy the wild salmon population?
and that's what we're doing.
that's a billion-dollar industry gone.
people, jobs, schoolbooks.
and we'll have to go back to eating meat.
people, cancer.
we'll just eat the farmed stuff.
there's nothing wrong with synthetic food, your honor.
we live in a synthetic country, for god's sake.
and on that note...
I'll rest.
you should have seen Seymore's face.
I think I'm about to get fired. - You won't be fired.
what am I gonna do?
what can I possibly say in my closing?
I've got nothing.
rabbit?
I'm sorry?
pull a rabbit out from under your dress.
you know what Gerry Spence does is these hopeless situations?
he just tells the jury a story.
a story? / Any story, as long as it's interesting.
he just entertains the jury.
he gets them right here, and in that moment when he has them right here, he connects the story to his case, sometimes barely, sometimes ridiculously.
and then he asks the jury to let his client go, and for god knows what reason, they often do.
a good story may be your rabbit. - Alan.
I'm sorry, Sally. This is a little important.
I need your number.
you have my number, Christine. I haven't changed it.
Alan, every lawsuit eventually comes down to a number.
what's your number?
750000.0
and I'm the insane one. $250, 000.
too low. - It's more than fair.
she got other employment. - At less pay.
the present-day value of $200, 000. - That offer is rejected, Christine.
I don't know if I'm up to closing.
I think I am, but I don't...
the client will only go up to $250, 000.
please.
that number won't get it done, Christine.
a man with felony priors for robbery and burglary, but this time, he stole the wallet by mistake.
sure.
one day, I was in my kitchen.
I think I was about 15.
and in came Fred, my big chocolate lab.
and in his mouth was a dead rabbit.
the neighbors' pet rabbit.
and I thought, this is it for Fred.
if they find out he killed their adored pet, animal control would be down and...
so I took the rabbit, washed him off in the sink, pulled out the blow-dryer, got him all white and fluffy looking, and I snuck over to my neighbors' backyard, and I put him back in the cage, hoping they'd think he died of natural causes.
that night, my parents came into my room.
the neighbors' pet rabbit had died three days ago, they told me.
they buried him in the woods, and some wacko evidently dug him up, washed him off and put him back in the cage.
and I remember thinking to myself the truth is not only stranger than fiction, but often less believable.
and that's what we have here, ladies and gentlemen.
the logical version, I suppose, is that my client stole that wallet.
the less believable, but quite possibly true account, is that he mistook it for his own.
nobody, not one of us, can be sure it didn't happen exactly the way Ramone Valasquez said it did.
that's reasonable doubt.
people like to stare at their coffee a lot here.
all set?
Yep.
you like being a lawyer, Alan?
I do, actually. You?
Yeah.
except for the days when the job is ugly, when you have to go against your instincts to be kind or compassionate.
it's important that she not close well.
some people simply cannot let go.
you love a person so desperately you, perhaps, lose sight of reason, and you begin to act unreasonably, perhaps out of control, even.
it's possible Daniel Ralston hano control over his behavior.
maybe he truly couldn't stop pursuing Wendy Moore.
maybe he had to keep calling, had to schedule those lunches, had to seemingly stalk her, if you will.
he was in love with her.
people in love lose their grip.
but what's at issue here is her state of mind, her mental state.
not Mr. Ralston's state of mind, but Wendy's.
was she reasonably upset by this relentless pursuit?
she's a married woman with a family trying to salvage her marriage, and her boss keeps calling, keeps coming, keeps coming, keeps propositioning her.
the fact that she once loved this man only makes it worse, more difficult.
what choice did she really have but to leave?
maybe that was his plan all the time.
he knew he couldn't fire her.
maybe that was his psychological game, where the only thing that she could really do in the end was get in her car...
and drive off.
with repeated, unwelcomed sexual advances, ladies and gentlemen.
that is prima facie classic sexual harassment.
love happens in the workplace all the time.
in fact, it's where most affairs start, most relationships.
it happens.
so do breakups.
as a woman, I am offended by the onslaught of these lawsuits.
as neutral as the language may be, sexual harassment law is gender biased it exists to protect women.
it feeds into the perception that women are weaker than.
it goes all the way back to common law, where women were denied the right to enter into contracts because we lacked mental capacity.
today's harassment law is designed to protect us from sexual banter in the workplace because we just can't take it.
I can take it.
can you? Can you?
do we really need to cleanse the workplace of all sexual expression so it'll be safe for us?
these laws treat us as if we were either psychologically or emotionally impaired, and I'm sick of it.
are some cases legitimate?
Absolutely.
but here, this woman is a grownup.
she entered into an adult, consensual relationship with her boss.
it ended, perhaps bumpy.
he's hurt, he's still in love, so she sues.
she wasn't fired.
she's a college-educated vice-president of a brokerage firm.
she's 34 years old. She's a professional.
she's here today to tell you that she can't stick up for herself.
she is here today trying to take advantageof a law that declares women to be the weaker sex.
not for me, ladies and gentlemen.
I wouldn't have gotten in my car and driven off.
I'd have sooner driven over him.
let's treat these people, both of them...
as if they were grownups.
my own quick research reveals wild salmon, especially Atlantic salmon, are threatened with extinction.
They'rean endangered species, which means the environmental protections on that river have to stay in place.
your honor, they're not endangered if you count the farmed salmon.
I'm not counting the farmed salmon, and the idea to count them is absurd.
that river stays protected.
your variance is officially pulled.
a permanent restraining order is now in effect.
I keep telling you, you talk too fast.
you talk too damn fast.
america first. We're a synthetic country.
what's wrong with you? - The best man won in there.
you know, dad...
I've never really had a big trial to speak of.
this is...
for the last 10 years or so,
I've pretended to be you.
through college, law school, and...
I always felt like whenever I'd go into a courtroom,
I would kind of...
channel you or something.
but this is the first time I actually felt it.
I was Donny Crane.
Yes, you were.
Yes, you were.
in the matter of Moore vs. Ralston, on the question of liability, we find in favor of the plaintiff.
we further order the defendant to pay damages in the amount of $125, 000.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your time.
you are discharged.
I'm sorry.
I got my verdict anyway.
thank you.
thank you.
congratulations, Christine. You tried an excellent case.
thank you.
I can and do accept that it's over.
the thing is, while I was institutionalized, the only person who wrote to me, who came to visit me, who called me, was you.
my world became quite 2-dimensional.
there was the hospital and you, and when I was suddenly faced with having to walk away from both the hospital and you, it was more than I could.
but I am going to make it.
I have no doubt.
you tried an excellent case.
we should eat at that wonderful indian place sometime.
I'd like that.
you don't think she'll go Glenn close on you?
no.
out of compulsive curiosity,
I always befriend my most colorful ex-girlfriends.
beautiful woman, Glenn close.
always meant to have sex with her.
well, I went with the rabbit.
of what variety?
I told an urban legend story for my closing.
involved a rabbit.
got the jury right here. / And?
they came back in 32 minutes.
not guilty.
you're kidding.
I thought we could celebrate...
like rabbits.
your hutch or mine?
9: 00, my hutch. Be there.
well, it seems we're all winners today in court, in love.
you didn't win in court today. Remember? Your side lost.
Ooh, that's right.
he was really something.
you should have seen him.
may I ask, how does a man not see his son in 15 years?
uh, don't start with me.
I'm being curious, not judgmental.
is that who Denny Crane is?
he's not my son.
what do you mean, he's not your son?
his mother slapped me with a paternity suit.
I settled.
she came back about 10 years later with a guilty conscience and admitted that I wasn't the father, just deep pockets.
but I like the kid, so I kept paying for his education and so forth.
obviously, he doesn't know.
his mother said...
it would break his heart.
he so liked being the son of Denny Crane.
who wouldn't?
you're not my father?
I'm not your son?
I'm not your son.
not by blood.
then how? You didn't raise me.
who's my father?
you'll have to discuss that with your mother.
it's all been a lie. / Hey...
what wasn't a lie was your performance in that courtroom.
you're a hell of a lawyer.
you did channel me.
I, I got to go.
sir...
is it okay if I keep the name?
of course.
pull the rabbit out of your hat.
that's the secret of both trial law and life.
rabbits... / Yeah.
ex-girlfriend tried to kill me.
she tried to kill you.
she did. - And now she wants out.
she does. / Alan.
she's stalking you. She tried to kill you, she was institutionalized, now she's out, and she's stalking you.
freedom is a privilege, Mr. Shore, not a right.
a privilege. - Yes, and it's revocable, especially if you try to run someone over with an automobile.
I got my old job back.
it's truly fantastic news, isn't it? Alan?
Yes.
why aren't you helping me?
Sally, I have a trial of my own beginning tomorrow, a rather big one.
but this is my very first trial.
you've certainly been to court before, I have no doubt.
motion practice. This is with a jury.
I don't, I don't think I'm ready.
look at me.
you trust me?
I do.
and because you trust me, you'll believe what I'm about to tell you.
I will.
that's all it is.
all what is?
trial law...
getting the jury to trust you so they'll believe what you tell them.
Really?
sincerity, Sally, once you learn to fake that, there'll be no stopping you.
Denny, we've got...
what's going on?
a little maintenance work, Paul.
wouldn't hurt you, by the way. You look like a prune.
we have the Kaneb meeting in 15 minutes.
excellent. Why do I care?
you care because this is the construction project that the entire firm has been working on for 18 months.
you care because Byron Kaneb cares, and he expects you to be present.
damn it, man, what have you done?
the needle broke.
not to worry, just let me remove it.
don't you touch me.
Mr. Crane, half the needle is still in your forehead.
just let me remove. - You're not touching me!
get Dr. Michaels back down here.
this is what happens when I let his kids cut their teeth on my head.
if I could just remove the needle... / Don't you touch me!
Denny, there's a needle in your head.
let him at least remove it.
get me Dr. Michaels!
I really don't need a second chair for this.
sexual harassment is a specialty of mine.
mine, too. / No doubt, but while your experience tends to be more hands-on, mine...
tends to be more wishful thinking.
not to mention, you ooze.
I ooze?
Yes, that certain something that subliminally champions misogyny.
you need me.
as much as I may want you, desire you, even.
I do not need you.
see that right there?
Ooze!
when can I dig my hole?
we're almost there, Byron.
don't tell me we're almost there, Paul.
we've been almost there for six months.
when will we be there?
city council agreed to the variance for the golf course on Monday.
now today we're expecting an answer from the redevelopment commission for the outdoor mall, and my sources say they're gonna rule in our favor.
what about the damn E. P.A?
the blue spotted salamander just got downgraded from endangered to threatened last week, so the marina looks like a go except for...
except for what?
it seems there's a river where some salmon spawn.
evidently, there's some environmental lawyer who's making a stink.
when you say stink...
he got a T. R.O.
a fish?
my city's being held up by a fish?
we are meeting the lawyer today.
we will make it go away.
do you plan to contribute, or are you simply assigned to mop up the ooze?
hello.
Oh, I've heard so much about you.
how are you?
fine, thank you.
if you'll excuse us, we're due in court. / Yes, I know.
I'm opposing counsel.
I beg your pardon?
what do you expect me to do?
I expect you to disqualify her. This is tantamount to stalking.
she got herself assigned to this case because I'm on it.
not to mention, as an officer of the court,
I question whether Ms. Pauley even has the capacity to trial case.
she was released from a mental facility last week.
certainly, counsel, if you wanna conflict out...
I can't conflict out.
I'm the only one who knows the case here.
ms. Colson was simply put on... - Ms. Pauley, what's going on?
of all the cases to start off with, you pick one against an ex-boyfriend you tried to kill?
actually, your honor, I didn't pick it.
my firm came to me. - Please, Christine...
because I used to date Mr. Shore, they thought I could shed some light on some of his procedural eccentricities, which I did.
since I also happen to have extensive experience in sexual harassment law, the senior parers asked me if I would first chair, I agreed.
we start at 11 A. M. - Your honor...
Mr. Shore, if you wanna conflict out, do so.
but I have no legal basis to disqualify Ms. Pauley.
may I speak with you alone, Alan?
no, you may not, Christine.
and if you choose to be on this case, please conduct yourself at arm's length and on the record.
it's just coincidence to you your first case out of the hospital.
I consider it a preposterous coincidence, you have no business trying a case.
but truth be told, the partners think. - I know you better than your partner.
how sad, you can't be happy for me. / I'm not happy.
clearly.
well, that seemed perfectly normal.
the D. A. offered three months suspended.
I think we should take it.
does it go on my record?
well, yes. - The answer's no.
Ramone... / I didn't do it.
I didn't take that wallet.
and as a matter of principle, I won't pretend that I took it.
they have an eyewitness.
look here, I might seem like some court-appointed charity case, but I'm an honest man. I don't steal.
and I won't agree to any plea that says otherwise.
Hi, Sally Heep.
I'm in litigation at the firm.
I know that.
you in court today, or... - No, but you are.
I'm here to observe your work, Ms. Heep.
good luck.
the lawyer who got the T. R.O.
on the Kaneb construction project...
Ah. Pay him out, Paul.
give him a bottle of scotch and some money to buy some more bus bench ADs.
he says he's your son.
it's true.
you're a lawyer now.
hey...
dad.
you got a needle in your head.
small accident. Not to worry.
son.
dad.
you're a lawyer now. That's how you greet people?
I had a one-night stand with his mother.
I paid for his education and so forth.
I did everything I could to be a good father.
when's the last time you saw him?
Oh, I don't know.
when he was 12?
we've offered several decent compromises. / And?
he just keeps on saying his name.
Oh, I'll talk to him.
how's my boy?
they don't really need to bug you with this, dad.
so, what's this all about, saving some fish?
well, see, your lawyers...
who are clearly very talented, persuaded a judge to eliminate the distinction between farmed salmon and wild salmon.
the president of the United states proposed eliminating that distinction.
Yes, I know. That's probably why the judge granted your motion.
see, dad, wild salmon are an endangered species.
the administration figures if you eliminate the distinction between farmed and wild, and count them both as one, the numbers would go up, and you could take them off the endangered list.
and that way, they can lift the environmental protections in place to protect them, which, of course, allows you to build more shopping malls.
well, son, look at the big picture.
if building this mall can save a species from becoming endangered, let's, by all means, do it.
I was vice president in charge of alternative investments.
and at the time of the affair, Mr. Ralston...
he was, and remains president of the firm.
this romantic affair lasted how long, Ms. Moore?
about nine months, at which point, I broke it off. / Because?
well, mainly because I was a married woman.
and I wanted to work things out with my husband.
I see.
and how did Mr. Ralston handle the breakup?
at first, I think, fine.
but then he would continue to try to get back together.
he would schedule lunches, meetings, ostensibly about business, only to pursue his romantic interests.
he started calling me after hours.
sometimes he would send flowers.
eventually, it got so bad I simply had to leave.
you went to another brokerage firm?
at a lesser position for less money.
there seemed to be a stigma about my departure.
I don't know, I...
maybe people thought that I had secretly been fired, I don't know.
what I do know is I was basically forced out of my job by his relentless unwelcome sexual advances.
thank you, Ms. Moore.
she looks demented.
leading up to your affair with my client, he made welcomed sexual advances?
well, not at first. I, I was a married woman.
but at some point, the advances became welcomed.
Yes.
a love affair then ensued? - Yes.
so I guess my client's strategy was " If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
a strategy you certainly ratified. - Well...
since dogged perseverance was rewarded the first time,
I guess it would be only natural for him to adopt that strategy again.
I may have sent mixed signals the first time, but I did no such thing this time.
when you left, did you tell prospective employers the reason?
no, I... / why not?
I suppose I feared that it wouldn't depict me in the best possible light.
I was a married woman having an affair. / Got it.
so, this stigma you refer to, people wondering whether you were fired or not.
that stigma was at least partly caused by your embarrassment over your own behavior, a married woman having an affair.
I suppose that's true. - Thank you, Ms. Moore.
I was reaching into my purse to get some change to feed the homeless.
that's when I saw him coming.
who?
him.
the guilty defendant sitting right there.
objection.
jury will disregard the reference to the defendant's guilt.
then what happened?
he reached into my purse, grabbed my wallet, started rifling through it.
what did you do?
I stood there, frozen.
I was shocked.
he started running away as he was rifling through it.
then he turns, and he's coming back.
then what happened?
I ran.
he started chasing me.
thank god he was tackled by some people.
I don't know what he might have done.
ms. White, are you absolutely sure that it was the defendant?
I can show you the pictures.
what pictures?
I have one of those little phone camera thingies.
I snapped his picture.
and you have them?
look.
you can see he's got the wallet.
you just let the pictures be introduced without so much as an objection.
well, I thought, um, the prosecution didn't know about it either.
so I couldn't claim unfair surprise.
could've gotten time to prepare a cross-examination, to research the photos for authenticity.
instead, you sat there quietly.
there's eyewitness testimony from the victim, a positive I. D. and pictures.
how do you plan to proceed now, Sally?
um...
my client wants to testify.
and say what?
um...
that he's innocent.
it's a fish, for god's sakes.
it's not just a fish.
it's a salmon, which the government is trying to wipe out.
now, look, I like to fish myself, catch and release, the whole shebang.
pull them in by the lip, throw them back out to prove you're humane.
you're mocking me. He's mocking me, dad.
you're a Crane. Get used to it.
we will go to court.
I love court.
look, Donny, you seem like a nice kid.
I have no doubt that you're a terrific attorney, but you are not him.
you're like a son to him, aren't you?
does he hug you much?
look, if this is about some score between you and the old man...
it's not about any score.
Hey, if you people want to go to court...
beat it, will you, Brad?
is it a score?
was I not there enough?
were you not there enough?
dad, I haven't seen you in 15 years.
I may not have had the time to give that most dads had, but I thought I was giving you something much more important.
money.
you gave me something even more important than that, dad.
you gave me the Crane legacy, and I fully plan on living up to it.
so...
I'll see you and your team in court.
at first, I saw it, but I didn't see it, if that makes any sense.
it took a few seconds to register.
what took a few seconds?
my wallet.
I lost it two days earlier and then I see it right there in her bag.
your wallet. - Yeah, this funky orange color.
it's not like there could be two of them, and I lost it on Washington, right where we were at, so I figured she stole it.
that woman stole my wallet.
so... / So I walked right up and snatched it back. Self-help.
you snatched back your own wallet. / Yes, I did.
and I hustled off, because truth be told, the woman looked a little vicious.
so what happened next?
well, I started to go through it to make sure it was mine, and as I was going through the inside, I saw...
Oh, my god, it's not my wallet.
it looked exactly like mine, but it wasn't.
truth is, I, I discovered later I'd left it in my car.
it was all a big mistake.
so I started to run back to return it, and she just took off, and I started chasing, yelling, " Lady, wait. I'm bringing it back,
I'm bringing it back."
then I got tackled, and here I am.
your witness.
so the wallet that you ripped out of Miss White's purse, the wallet that you just ran off with, you thought it was your own.
Yes, ma'am.
because it looked exactly like yours.
Yes, ma'am.
this one here.
when we broke up, it was because she felt committed to working things out with her family.
it wasn't that things were emotionally over between us.
she said that. / Yes.
and I suppose I felt, you know, when...
when two people love each other, you persevere through obstacles.
my so-called sexual harassment, it wasn't about sexual advances.
it was about getting her to be true to her feelings.
you were trying to show her that she felt like having sex with you.
please don't trivialize this.
I assure you, sir, I take it very seriously.
you say it's okay to harass women in the workplace so long as you love them.
I believed, and still believe, she was in love with me.
I see.
and she lacked the autonomy to make up her own mind. / Objection.
she lacked the mental capacity, perhaps, - to be truly happy without you. - Objection!
why is it some people just refuse to accept that it's over. / Objection!
I truly apologize.
for a second, I thought you were personalizing it, Alan, and I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you all right?
Yes.
it is ridiculous.
the stress of a trial a week out of the rubber room, going up against you.
why are you doing this?
I was always safe inside work, you know?
it was a little cocoon.
can you continue?
Oh, yes.
it's just a little...
again, I apologize for the outburst.
whatever you can do to keep it personal...
I'm sorry?
she's kind of been kicking our ass, Alan.
that's the first crack I've seen in her armor.
I'm not going to exploit her.
Alan, if you can't put your client's interests ahead of Christine's, then step aside.
let number two take over.
we now have to go to court?
no, we are confident we'll be able to handle this.
I hire one of the biggest law firms in Boston, definitely one of the most expensive, and I'm being neutralized by salmon man, who happens to be your son?
let me tell you something, Byron.
um, Brad Chase is one of our finest litigators.
he will handle this.
your honor, we've had meetings with the environmental protection agency.
they signed off on this already.
with all due respect, the E. P.A. gets steamrolled by the administration all the time.
no matter what anyone proposes these days, there's always somebody somewhere who jumps up and screams, " Woe, the environment."
now there's a word, your honor, a very simple word that describes what my clientis trying to do here.
please don't let the word be " progress."
how about "people"?
people？ / Yes.
we are trying to invest in the future of people.
creating jobs in a time of unemployment.
we're talking about over 1, 000 jobs.
we're talking about benefiting people below the poverty line.
we are talking about people hoping to educate their children, afford medical coverage, feed their families, basic human needs.
this man wants to put all that on hold because it inconveniences a fish.
well, first, this whole thing kind of goes to the farmed salmon issue.
the government is trying to count these genetically raised salmon as wild ones.
so they can take salmon off the endangered species list.
I get that. So what?
so what? / People judge, jobs, insurance, schoolbooks, food. People.
well, farmed salmon is terrible for people.
they're carcinogenic.
they don't even look like real salmon.
by the way, they're fed these little pellets to turn their meat red.
otherwise, it's this pallid white. - People, jobs, America first.
there's a rumor.
I can't give evidence on this, but there's a rumor that cattle they have to kill due to mad cow disease, they grind them up and then feed the meat to the farmed salmon.
objection, your honor.
there is nothing in the record that even remotely substantiates that.
counsel, the river in question only concerns wild salmon, so can we get off the farmed salmon?
we're talking about lifting the environmental protections on that river.
they're inflating the salmon count with the farmed numbers to get those protections lifted.
people, jobs, food chain.
Oh, yes, people and jobs.
wild salmon is a billion-dollar industry in this country alone.
once we destroy the wild salmon population?
and that's what we're doing.
that's a billion-dollar industry gone.
people, jobs, schoolbooks.
and we'll have to go back to eating meat.
people, cancer.
we'll just eat the farmed stuff.
there's nothing wrong with synthetic food, your honor.
we live in a synthetic country, for god's sake.
and on that note...
I'll rest.
you should have seen Seymore's face.
I think I'm about to get fired. - You won't be fired.
what am I gonna do?
what can I possibly say in my closing?
I've got nothing.
rabbit?
I'm sorry?
pull a rabbit out from under your dress.
you know what Gerry Spence does is these hopeless situations?
he just tells the jury a story.
a story? / Any story, as long as it's interesting.
he just entertains the jury.
he gets them right here, and in that moment when he has them right here, he connects the story to his case, sometimes barely, sometimes ridiculously.
and then he asks the jury to let his client go, and for god knows what reason, they often do.
a good story may be your rabbit. - Alan.
I'm sorry, Sally. This is a little important.
I need your number.
you have my number, Christine. I haven't changed it.
Alan, every lawsuit eventually comes down to a number.
what's your number?
750000.0
and I'm the insane one. $250, 000.
too low. - It's more than fair.
she got other employment. - At less pay.
the present-day value of $200, 000. - That offer is rejected, Christine.
I don't know if I'm up to closing.
I think I am, but I don't...
the client will only go up to $250, 000.
please.
that number won't get it done, Christine.
a man with felony priors for robbery and burglary, but this time, he stole the wallet by mistake.
sure.
one day, I was in my kitchen.
I think I was about 15.
and in came Fred, my big chocolate lab.
and in his mouth was a dead rabbit.
the neighbors' pet rabbit.
and I thought, this is it for Fred.
if they find out he killed their adored pet, animal control would be down and...
so I took the rabbit, washed him off in the sink, pulled out the blow-dryer, got him all white and fluffy looking, and I snuck over to my neighbors' backyard, and I put him back in the cage, hoping they'd think he died of natural causes.
that night, my parents came into my room.
the neighbors' pet rabbit had died three days ago, they told me.
they buried him in the woods, and some wacko evidently dug him up, washed him off and put him back in the cage.
and I remember thinking to myself the truth is not only stranger than fiction, but often less believable.
and that's what we have here, ladies and gentlemen.
the logical version, I suppose, is that my client stole that wallet.
the less believable, but quite possibly true account, is that he mistook it for his own.
nobody, not one of us, can be sure it didn't happen exactly the way Ramone Valasquez said it did.
that's reasonable doubt.
people like to stare at their coffee a lot here.
all set?
Yep.
you like being a lawyer, Alan?
I do, actually. You?
Yeah.
except for the days when the job is ugly, when you have to go against your instincts to be kind or compassionate.
it's important that she not close well.
some people simply cannot let go.
you love a person so desperately you, perhaps, lose sight of reason, and you begin to act unreasonably, perhaps out of control, even.
it's possible Daniel Ralston hano control over his behavior.
maybe he truly couldn't stop pursuing Wendy Moore.
maybe he had to keep calling, had to schedule those lunches, had to seemingly stalk her, if you will.
he was in love with her.
people in love lose their grip.
but what's at issue here is her state of mind, her mental state.
not Mr. Ralston's state of mind, but Wendy's.
was she reasonably upset by this relentless pursuit?
she's a married woman with a family trying to salvage her marriage, and her boss keeps calling, keeps coming, keeps coming, keeps propositioning her.
the fact that she once loved this man only makes it worse, more difficult.
what choice did she really have but to leave?
maybe that was his plan all the time.
he knew he couldn't fire her.
maybe that was his psychological game, where the only thing that she could really do in the end was get in her car...
and drive off.
with repeated, unwelcomed sexual advances, ladies and gentlemen.
that is prima facie classic sexual harassment.
love happens in the workplace all the time.
in fact, it's where most affairs start, most relationships.
it happens.
so do breakups.
as a woman, I am offended by the onslaught of these lawsuits.
as neutral as the language may be, sexual harassment law is gender biased it exists to protect women.
it feeds into the perception that women are weaker than.
it goes all the way back to common law, where women were denied the right to enter into contracts because we lacked mental capacity.
today's harassment law is designed to protect us from sexual banter in the workplace because we just can't take it.
I can take it.
can you? Can you?
do we really need to cleanse the workplace of all sexual expression so it'll be safe for us?
these laws treat us as if we were either psychologically or emotionally impaired, and I'm sick of it.
are some cases legitimate?
Absolutely.
but here, this woman is a grownup.
she entered into an adult, consensual relationship with her boss.
it ended, perhaps bumpy.
he's hurt, he's still in love, so she sues.
she wasn't fired.
she's a college-educated vice-president of a brokerage firm.
she's 34 years old. She's a professional.
she's here today to tell you that she can't stick up for herself.
she is here today trying to take advantageof a law that declares women to be the weaker sex.
not for me, ladies and gentlemen.
I wouldn't have gotten in my car and driven off.
I'd have sooner driven over him.
let's treat these people, both of them...
as if they were grownups.
my own quick research reveals wild salmon, especially Atlantic salmon, are threatened with extinction.
They'rean endangered species, which means the environmental protections on that river have to stay in place.
your honor, they're not endangered if you count the farmed salmon.
I'm not counting the farmed salmon, and the idea to count them is absurd.
that river stays protected.
your variance is officially pulled.
a permanent restraining order is now in effect.
I keep telling you, you talk too fast.
you talk too damn fast.
america first. We're a synthetic country.
what's wrong with you? - The best man won in there.
you know, dad...
I've never really had a big trial to speak of.
this is...
for the last 10 years or so,
I've pretended to be you.
through college, law school, and...
I always felt like whenever I'd go into a courtroom,
I would kind of...
channel you or something.
but this is the first time I actually felt it.
I was Donny Crane.
Yes, you were.
Yes, you were.
in the matter of Moore vs. Ralston, on the question of liability, we find in favor of the plaintiff.
we further order the defendant to pay damages in the amount of $125, 000.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your time.
you are discharged.
I'm sorry.
I got my verdict anyway.
thank you.
thank you.
congratulations, Christine. You tried an excellent case.
thank you.
I can and do accept that it's over.
the thing is, while I was institutionalized, the only person who wrote to me, who came to visit me, who called me, was you.
my world became quite 2-dimensional.
there was the hospital and you, and when I was suddenly faced with having to walk away from both the hospital and you, it was more than I could.
but I am going to make it.
I have no doubt.
you tried an excellent case.
we should eat at that wonderful indian place sometime.
I'd like that.
you don't think she'll go Glenn close on you?
no.
out of compulsive curiosity,
I always befriend my most colorful ex-girlfriends.
beautiful woman, Glenn close.
always meant to have sex with her.
well, I went with the rabbit.
of what variety?
I told an urban legend story for my closing.
involved a rabbit.
got the jury right here. / And?
they came back in 32 minutes.
not guilty.
you're kidding.
I thought we could celebrate...
like rabbits.
your hutch or mine?
9: 00, my hutch. Be there.
well, it seems we're all winners today in court, in love.
you didn't win in court today. Remember? Your side lost.
Ooh, that's right.
he was really something.
you should have seen him.
may I ask, how does a man not see his son in 15 years?
uh, don't start with me.
I'm being curious, not judgmental.
is that who Denny Crane is?
he's not my son.
what do you mean, he's not your son?
his mother slapped me with a paternity suit.
I settled.
she came back about 10 years later with a guilty conscience and admitted that I wasn't the father, just deep pockets.
but I like the kid, so I kept paying for his education and so forth.
obviously, he doesn't know.
his mother said...
it would break his heart.
he so liked being the son of Denny Crane.
who wouldn't?
you're not my father?
I'm not your son?
I'm not your son.
not by blood.
then how? You didn't raise me.
who's my father?
you'll have to discuss that with your mother.
it's all been a lie. / Hey...
what wasn't a lie was your performance in that courtroom.
you're a hell of a lawyer.
you did channel me.
I, I got to go.
sir...
is it okay if I keep the name?
of course.
I hit her on the head with a skillet.
it wasn't premeditated or planned.
she was berating me. Suddenly, my arm was in motion.
bam! I hit her, and she went down.
Oh!
mom...
he hit me on the head with a skillet.
he called the police?
I'm afraid so. - What do I do?
Mr. Ferrion?
what?
your mother has passed away.
the victim identified the defendant as the killer.
that would be hearsay. - Is this all you've got?
we'll get more.
the charges against Mr. Ferrion are dismissed without prejudice.
I see in you, Bernie, an innately kind person.
I'm hoping it's the kind and gentle person who goes on from here, not the one who swung that skillet.
how bad is he?
he's intermittently brilliant and nonsensical, often at the same time.
and he's technically still in charge of litigation?
which is the reason I called you back.
he is an enormous rainmaker, Shirley.
and yet...
lock and load.
where is everybody?
this is an administrative meeting, Denny.
Oh. What the hell am I doing here?
remember the good old days when you liked to know what was going on, when you could go from your office to the elevator without a road map?
didn't need a road map...
to find my way around your body, did I, Shirley?
I wouldn't know.
I was usually asleep.
I once had her and Streisand at the same time.
remember that?
I do, Denny.
and not to burst your bubble, but that was a female impersonator.
perhaps the penis might've been your cue.
that wasn't Barbra Streisand?
you wanted to see me?
Yes, Sally, bad news.
we lost the summary judgment motion on Winchell. Have a seat.
Ah, we lost?
the judge held that the magazine, while possibly negligent, wasn't guilty of reckless disregard for the truth.
so we could prevail under negligence.
we could, if only we'd thought to plead negligence.
count one, intentional infliction of emotional distress.
count two, reckless disregard for the truth.
here's where there should've been a third count alleging negligence.
there is no third count alleging negligence.
in, in the supporting memoranda, - we have pages on negligence. - But you didn't plead it.
so we just file a motion to amend.
that deadline lapsed.
uh, this is...
this is obviously an oversight.
the defendant had constructive notice.
we can appeal this. I'll get right on it.
I, I've taken the liberty of reviewing some of your other work, Sally.
you're a very good lawyer.
but not good enough. We're letting you go.
you're firing me?
I'm sorry.
I have done a lot of good work here.
Yes, you have.
and any number of law firms would be happy to have you.
this one, unfortunately, just doesn't happen to be one of them.
are you in on this?
am I, am, am I in on this?
it was my decision.
paul and Denny still remain strong supporters.
we're streamlining a little, and I have to make some tough calls.
I'm sorry.
how can you come in here, and in one week, fire someone you don't even know?
I'm Schmidt.
Nora, outstanding.
I give it a 3.
thank you.
Mr. Crane.
a Mr. Walter Fife is in your office. He says it's quite important.
Oh, thank you.
may I ask...
do I know you?
I'm Alan Shore's assistant.
Mr. Fife came to our office when he couldn't find you.
I escorted him back to your office.
excellent. I'll be right there.
you're waiting for me to tell you where your office is, aren't you?
no, I want to see the look on your face when you realize they still come through that door looking for one man to solve their problems.
they don't come barging in looking for Paul or you.
only one man.
allow me.
she can still pump my chubby.
Mrs. Schmidt.
my mother is Mrs. Schmidt. You can call me Schmidt.
I know you're a very busy person, but if I could steal one minute of your busy time...
regarding?
it's a little personal.
10 o'clock.
they didn't just sue the school board.
they sued me personally, which I regard as punitive.
Walter, I can assure you, their cause of action is totally baseless.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
Hi. Shirley Schmidt.
this is Walter Fife.
he's superintendent of the Middlesex school district.
he's being sued.
What'd you do, a little touchy-feely with a student?
what?
God, no. What kind of question is that?
Oh, lighten up. Let's all sit.
Shirley here is a senior partner, so you're in good hands.
you got both Shirley and, um...
you.
me. Right. Good. Okay.
now, look, I'm gonna ask you something.
it's gonna be a question, and I want a direct answer, no matter how difficult.
okay.
why, Walter...
are you being sued?
you promised you'd answer.
the school board voted to include：
creationism along with Darwinism in the 8th grade science curriculum.
the teachers refused, I terminated their employment.
they sued. - Massachusetts is a blue state.
God has no place here.
I'm not sure you're really the lawyer for this particular...
we have many attorneys well-equipped to handle...
nonsense. I've been practicing law for 45 years.
never lost a single case.
you've never lost?
my record is 6, 043 to 0.
you hear the one about the fella who died and went to the Pearly gates?
St. Peter let him in, sees a guy in a suit making a closing argument, says "who's that?
St. Peter says, "oh, that's god.
thinks he's Denny Crane.
I'm your boy, Walter.
never lost.
never will.
did she give you a reason? - Just that my work didn't cut it.
I mean, my reviews have all been good.
Plus, it's not like they've given me very much to do.
the Winchell case was really the first one they let me run with.
well, you did forget to plead negligence.
sorry.
let me talk to her, see if there's another story.
I mean, is this woman some sort of psycho witch or something?
actually, no, she's extremely nice.
we all know she was sent to shake the tree.
this looks like it's already begun.
I wonder who's next.
can I steal you for a second?
sure.
dibs on her office.
I just heard about Sally. I think you're making a mistake.
I didn't ask. - Which surprises me, actually.
you and I are friends.
I've worked with Sally... - and being loyal to her, you'd possibly be neither objective nor candid.
even so...
in either event, I didn't ask.
we just got a new case. Big client.
Middlesex school district.
Denny's in charge, which is fine, as long as he doesn't speak.
I need you to take over.
how do I just take over?
he'll completely... - you handle him, Lori, the way only you can.
what's the case? - It's a variation of the Scopes trial.
three teachers were fired for refusing to teach Creationism.
they've sued.
sounds like a slam dunk for them.
perhaps.
it would take some pretty ingenious lawyering on our part from not only a gift attorney, but someone who's an expert in the field.
Meaning?
Lori, I know all the skeletons in your closet, remember?
including that deeply guarded little one that you fear might ruin your intellectual reputation.
you go to church.
um, Schmidt, is this a good time?
Yeah.
Conferenceroom, noon?
okay.
thank you.
how can I help?
well, this is very awkward.
I'm not even sure you're the right person to come to but...
you're a woman.
that's very kind.
I work for Alan Shore.
and in many, many ways, he's an excellent boss.
God knows, he isn't boring.
but I feel...
that he's been inappropriate with me.
how so?
well, he compliments my figure daily.
and he just kind of does it in a lascivious way.
he also ranks my sweaters.
he ranks your sweaters?
Yes.
which ones he thinks I look best in.
this is a 3.
he asked if he could take one home for the weekend.
he told me he has dreams about me.
what kind of dreams?
all kinds.
uh, once he dreamt that I was just a head.
no body. Just a head and...
everywhere he went, he would carry me along, wrapped in a muffler, to keep him company.
and every so often, I would whisper terrible, dirty things in his ear.
it feels a little like harassment. - You think?
would you like to work for another lawyer?
well, I'd just like him to stop.
I must admit that...
sometimes, I've been guilty of playing along with his banter, but...
I'll take care of it.
thank you.
thank you for coming forward with this.
I know it was difficult.
we have very little information, other than the victim was in her 50s and that she was bludgeoned to death.
it is the second death in a week that has rocked this idyllic little street.
just last Friday, the victim's next-door neighbor died as well from a head trauma.
you may recall the son was briefly held and then released.
what?
...indicated whether these two cases are connected.
it's Bernie!
who?
my little skillet-wielding client from last week.
he's whacked another one. He promised me he wouldn't.
does that mean you're...
finished?
what have you done?
there's an awful lot of excitement. - I saw.
both live and on the news.
you've been flailing again with your frying pan, haven't you, Bernard?
I never meant for it to happen. - I am very disappointed.
I gave you a terrific speech last week, Bernie, appealing to the kind inner you.
it was wonderful, poignant even, and now you've completely mooted it by committing murder again.
I never meant to kill her.
Oh, what, you just went over there to make an omelet, - and things got out of hand? - She knew.
she heard an argument between me and mother.
she was out there watering her stupid plants, in the winter, for god's sakes. The woman is not right.
or wasn't right.
Alan, she said she was gonna call the police.
she said what she heard would not be hearsay.
she looked it up.
she said, because we were arguing, it would, it would qualify as an excited blutterance.
suddenly, the skillet was in my hand, and I swung.
Blutterance isn't even a real word, much less a defense!
you've murdered somebody over a fake word!
I was careful to not leave any evidence.
I went over there, stealth-like.
Oh, for god's sake.
and I, I staged a break-in in the back.
I dispatched of her, and then I returned.
Alan, I promise you, this will be the very, very last one.
I'm not representing you this time.
you must, if it comes to that. - I won't.
you've let me down terribly!
but, but you said that you stood for the little man!
I'm little!
the best thing, I feel, would be to go for an immediate declaratory judgment.
the last thing we want is a trial.
this is a hot-button issue.
the ACLU will be jumping in, and that's only the beginning.
why have I been taken off this case? - You haven't.
you've been relieved of the grunt work because it's beneath you.
relieve is a soft word for discharge.
I recognize a demotion when I see one.
I am the master of the soft discharge.
you refer again to when we were intimate.
now pay attention, and pretend you have a clue.
we all set?
lock and load.
let's go.
Alan, a second.
we have a little problem.
it seems you've been sexually harassing Nora Jacobs.
she signed a waiver.
I'm sorry?
I make all my female employees sign sexual harassment waivers, especially the pretty ones.
I don't think that document would hold up in court.
but regardless, that kind of behavior isn't tolerated at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
which kind of behavior, specifically?
I think you're smart enough to sense where the line is, counselor.
I'm never sure until I cross it.
she is a subordinate. There is a disparity of power.
you will refrain from any sexual advances, verbal or otherwise.
what about senior partners?
there would be nothing wrong with me lusting, say, after you, would there?
go subscribe to National Geographic.
make a list of all the places you'll never get to visit.
add to that list, Schmidt.
Sally, I'll talk to her, but other than that...
you can't pull some strings?
what about Alan Shore? He's the one that pulls rabbits...
he's not a partner. You are.
besides, I slept with Alan Shore.
how objective can he... - You also slept with me.
do you ever think that might be part of the problem?
that was unfair...
kicking me while I'm down.
I guess I should've expected it.
the police want to question me.
that's really a stunner, Bernie.
they arrested you last week for whacking your mother, you got off on a technicality, now the woman next door turns up dead from a blow to the head.
what could possibly make them think of you?
should I talk to them? - I wouldn't.
where you once were convincing, you are now anything but.
I don't like it when you speak to me in these hurtful tones.
I am not an evil person. - Yes, you are, Bernie.
you've killed two people inside of a week.
by definition, that makes you evil.
this last killing was premeditated, calculated.
you went over there, as you said, to dispatch a human being.
you're a little bug.
and like a bug, you will one day get stepped on.
now go away. I do not represent evil people.
I asked you to leave.
may I say one more thing?
you cut me to the quick.
I am a bug.
my mother would often tell me：
I am nothing more than an insignificant little...
she used to call me a, a dung beetle.
when I killed her, as she lay on the floor, for the first time, I felt alive.
I had actually done something.
perhaps a part of me sought to relive that power, but today, I, I do, I feel evil.
I need your help, Alan.
the police want to interrogate me.
I don't know what to do.
Alan, could I, oh, I'm so sorry.
that's okay.
Tara Wilson, meet Bernard Ferrion.
he kills people with cookware. Allegedly, of course.
Bernie, Tara.
she's your new lawyer. - No, I prefer you.
no, you can't have me.
one reason being, I know too much.
if you want this firm to help you, Tara's your lawyer.
she's very fetching, but is she good?
the police want to talk to him.
there's an excellent chance you can avoid the prison term he very much deserves.
I must warn you, do not come to care for this man.
he will let you down.
that's all.
let's go, Mr. Ferrion.
Nora, when you get a minute.
instead of telling it to Shirley Schmidt, why don't you take it up with me?
I don't know. I suppose...
I guess I didn't feel I could hold my own with you...
which, I guess, is a part of the problem.
Alan, I'm uncomfortable with the banter.
you could've said that.
you did participate in the banter.
I participated.
I, of course, wanted to be liked by my boss.
but then...
it started to go too far.
and when it went too far, why not tell me?
I don't know.
because I'd let it go on,
I felt maybe I'd gotten myself in...
at the seminars, you get the impression that the senior people here are good at dealing with these things.
I wanted you to stop.
but I still like you, and like working for you.
and I was hoping they maybe had a way to solve the problem without any hurt feelings.
so, what happens now?
we actually call it intelligent design.
basically, the idea is life is so complex, a greater power has to be at play.
the greater power being god.
we're by no means shutting down Darwinism, or suggesting that evolution is inaccurate.
do you believe in evolution, Mr. Fife?
I happen to believe in both god and evolution.
I don't think the two have to be mutually exclusive.
so, why not simply offer the intelligent design theory in religion courses?
why science?
well, we thought long and hard about that.
but the simple truth is more and more scientists, scientists, not theologians, have said that when you examine the intricacies of the human cell, the mathematical equations of DNA, you simply cannot conclude that it's all explained by natural selection.
another power has to be at work.
God.
well, again, we never mention him by name.
U are aware of the separation of church and state.
I'm aware.
this is boring crap.
and you're also aware, Mr. Fife, that the supreme court has banned the teaching of Creationism.
well, as I said, technically, we're not calling it Creationism.
but you admitted that's what's going on.
and Creationism holds that god created the world about 6, 000 years ago in 6 days.
that's not my view.
but it's a view you're insisting your teachers explain in a science class.
as a theory.
a theory with no scientific basis other than to say, "Gee, evolution can't account for it all."
why the helmet?
well, it wouldn't be for here. It would be for at home.
well, the thinking being if there's somebody in my neighborhood breaking into houses whacking eople from behind on the head, it would make sense for me to wear a helmet.
I want to exude innocence, you see.
get rid of the helmet.
but, Ms. Wilson, at, at my core,
I'm a little man.
it would make sense for me to want to protect myself, right?
get rid of the helmet. You look ridiculous.
now, listen to me.
the police have asked for a DNA sample, and I'm gonna agree.
what? Why on earth?
because they could get one with a court order.
there's no point in opposing.
well, what about my right to not incriminate myself?
cooperation goes a long way towards exuding innocence, Mr. Ferrion, much better than hockey headgear.
you know, everyone is speaking to me in hurtful tones, and I don't appreciate it.
I did kill people.
you'd think I'd incur a little shock and awe, if not respect.
is that why you did this?
to inspire awe?
alan Shore told me that your mother referred to you as a dung beetle.
please don't mention that particular species to me.
I don't know what else Alan told you, but I'm a kind man.
I have admittedly committed two heinous acts, but the first was not voluntary, and the second was out of desperation, not wanting to go to prison where bigger men will have their way with me.
ms. Wilson, I need your help.
please be on my side.
I'm sorry.
that remark was way out of line.
listen, Sally, it didn't help that you were with me a year and a half ago, and then you were with Alan Shore. It's gossip. It travels fast.
but I have no doubt, none, that you are going to be an exceptional attorney, but just not here.
they're never gonna give you the chance.
you need to...
remake yourself.
start fresh.
you asked me for help.
and I'm going to provide it to you in the form of advice.
you need to go.
at the beginning of the school year, we got the word at our teachers' assembly that moral values would be one of our educational objectives, which was fine.
but to have evolution bumped for Creationism...
well, to be fair, evolution isn't being displaced.
creationism is just being included.
evolution is a tough subject matter.
we cannot cut into what little class time we have to service a political agenda.
objection. This is non-responsive.
please limit your answers to the questions, ma'am.
why can't you view intelligent design as a science, Ms. Turner?
because there is simply no scientific data to support it.
how are we to maintain any credibility as science teachers if we say, "Gee, despite all this data, there's also another possibility"?
intelligent design makes a mockery of science.
if you wanna teach it as a religion course, fine.
but as a science, it's simply preposterous.
I just don't understand why he wouldn't wanna talk.
if there's a serial killer loose in his neighborhood...
he'd love to talk. I'm not letting him.
I'll tell you one thing.
you people wrongly arrested him last time with no evidence after his mother recklessly accused him.
now, it's clear there is somebody in the neighborhood killing people, you haven't so much as apologized to Mr. Ferrion for ruining his good name.
why should we expect any fair treatment from you?
I'm done.
once again, I'll encourage your client not to leave the jurisdiction.
bully boy.
you handled that deftly.
so, what now?
you can go home.
if, indeed, you left no traces behind, and assuming they find no DNA, and with no smoking skillet, you'll likely get away with it once again.
you're using a judgmental tone.
do you really expect us not to condemn you?
you killed two people.
well, I expect you to condemn my actions, but, I suppose, not me.
you can go.
how's Alan?
honestly, I think he's hurt.
you hear all the time how clients are let down by their lawyers.
sometimes it's the attorney who's let down by the client.
as silly as it may sound, the cynical, jaded Alan Shore gets a bit desperate sometimes to believe in the goodness of mankind.
he found, I think, some hope in you.
and you crushed it...
like a bug.
you're firing me? - Certainly not, I'd get sued.
I'm reassigning you.
if I get put back into the pool, that's the same as a demotion.
Nora, I'm not going to change who I am.
I can work on it, but leaps and bounds I'll never make.
when I look at women, most women, my mind wanders invariably to sexual fantasy of a broad and curious nature, unfettered by moral restraint. I can't help it.
I realize this candor could come back to haunt me should you indeed file a claim, but when I look at you,
I often conjure up the most intimate and explicit of distractions.
that's not going to change.
you're a sexually attractive...
beast.
could you excuse us, Shirley? I'm dictating a letter.
I give you my word, you will not get a demotion.
I also offer you my gratitude for making me realize that sometimes, women...
play along, and yet nevertheless feel harassed.
I suppose it's the callous idiot who can't appreciate that.
I apologize for being that idiot.
the next time that somebody does something to you that you don't like, be direct.
I assure you, you're up to it.
that was very eloquent.
thank you.
you need to get me another secretary, Shirley, someone more willing to be harassed.
I'll see what I can do.
these are bad times for science, your honor, especially at the hands of moral values.
the government has systematically distorted or worse, suppressed findings by the FDA and EPA when it comes to contraception, stem cell research, AIDS, global warming, pollution.
let's just stick to the case, counsel, and leave politics out of it.
this case is all about politics.
it's about getting religion back into schools.
creationism is religious doctrine.
it is not supported by scientific data.
I'm a christian, my wife is a jew.
we have wonderful debates.
and this country, as a whole, should be more theologically literate, but it's not science.
what's happening here today is an attack on evolution.
it's clever.
let's call it intelligent design.
let's not mention god. But, come on, the supreme court banned the teaching of Creationism in the public schools.
they were right then, they remain right today, and my client's discharge was unlawful, as well as in violation of our time-honored tradition of separating church and state.
of course we have a legitimate cause of action.
that was almost evangelical.
the establishment clause prohibits the endorsement of or discrimination against any particular religion, but it was never meant to extinguish the notion of a higher power.
I certainly believe in evolution.
who here among us, while watching the presential debates, could deny that we all come from monkeys?
as for church and state, we go to war over god-given rights to democracy.
let's face it.
God is big here.
we love god.
and we, as a nation, have an overwhelming belief he had something to do with the creation of humankind.
but teach that in a science class?
perish the thought.
nobody here is trying to squash evolution.
and I would agree with Mr. Gellman, it isn't good science to suppress information.
but I would ask the court, who here today is trying to do the squashing?
I thought if I went to trial, it would offer me a chance to clear my name.
clear your name? You did it.
but nobody knows that.
have you gone mad?
they haven't got any evidence, they can't even arrest you, and you're here asking to go to trial?
what is the matter with you?
the suspense of them building a case, it's just too much to bear.
I'm lonely.
all I ever had was my mother, and I killed her.
the only other person who ever, ever talked to me was my neighbor.
killed her, too.
how's Alan?
I miss him.
unless something else happens here, your case is over.
now, I can appreciate that you're lonely, but you need to find a life for yourself now.
but, um, how do I do that?
Bernard, your case status at the moment is over.
okay.
okay.
hello.
Mrs. Piper?
you remember!
Oh, I always say, shake a man's hand with dog poop on your glove, he'll remember you for life.
I remember you because I trick-or-treated at your house.
how are you, dear?
you don't look well.
what are you doing here?
I'm applying for the position of your secretary, of course.
I heard what happened to the last one, and I must say, your problem...
most people aren't able to see that beneath your slick, insensitive exterior, deep down, you really are a douche bag.
I get that, Alan.
you'd have no misunderstanding with me.
Mr. Shore.
Oh, my, what an adorable little man.
are you a midget, dear?
I, uh, I just wanna say that I am deeply sorry, and I assure you,
I give you my word.
well, that was sweet.
so...
do I get the job?
nobody is more frightened than I am of the religious right getting a stranglehold on our values.
is this the part where we get spanked?
it seems as long as you do it in the name of the almighty, one is free to abandon not only common sense and science, but also the facts.
but I am also concerned about a secular society squeezing faith out of our lives.
we have all witnessed the ridiculous lawsuits to stop nativity scenes at Christmas, to take god out of the pledge of allegiance.
God has always been a part of who and what we are as a nation.
on our currency, it reads "in god we trust.
the declaration of independence speaks of god, how we are created, endowed by our creator.
it references "our supreme judge of the world," and "divine providence."
God.
and I'm sorry, anybody who has ever held a newborn child in his hands must make room for the chance that a higher power exists.
and it shouldn't offend you as scientists to say, "Hey, we just don't know.
I find the decision to include intelligent design along with evolution into the science curriculum does not violate the establishment clause of the First amendment.
I'm ruling in favor of the defendant.
this lawsuit is dismissed.
Oh, boy.
was it interesting? I didn't listen to a word.
thank you.
thank you both.
good luck, Mr. Fife.
what's the expression?
uh, go with god.
so when are you leaving?
is there a big rush?
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm leaving now, tonight.
you know, for what it's worth,
Shirley can be very draconian, and when she makes up her mind, it's not...
I have nothing against Shirley.
in fact, she didn't even really hurt me.
Shirley doesn't know me.
you do.
Lori does, Alan does.
a lot of people, none of whom took issue with Shirley.
the silent majority has spoken, Brad...
with a resounding roar.
every knock is a boost.
I'm gonna cling to that and a few other cliche for a while.
and then, you'll all see me again.
in court, across the deposition table.
you'll all see me again.
that's a promise.
he's just so profoundly lonely.
he came to apologize.
I actually think that he wanted to get arrested because he's so starved for attention.
I hate this job.
well, you warned me not to care for him.
Tara, don't.
do not let yourself. - Well, it's over now.
he's gone.
what's done is done.
it's not over. That's the problem.
what do you mean?
he'll kill again.
what, did he say that? - No, but I just get the feeling.
he'll kill again.
what are you doing out here?
just looking at the city.
still trying to fathom that...
the Red sox won?
what's this?
the boys do it. I thought we'd give it a try.
you wanna smoke cigars?
passing of the torch from the boys' club to us.
well, I'll smoke to that.
awful.
let me try.
that's terrible.
well, this makes it official.
we've evolved more than they have.
is it a good thing we won today?
I don't know.
you believe in a higher power, right?
it wasn't just advocacy in that room?
with what's going on in the world, I need to believe.
but...
but what?
the trial starts tomorrow.
I can bring you up to speed on it. The facts are straightforward.
and why can't Tara do it?
well, Tara's a junior associate.
this trial's gonna be in the news. It's hardly the kind of case that...
Brad, it isn't the case so much as it is the client, right?
and it isn't who she is so much as what she is, right?
what is she, Brad?
can't you even say the word?
I can say it. - Well, what is she, Brad?
she's a...
homosexual.
and what's the word for a female homosexual?
lesbian. - I couldn't really hear that.
she's a lesbian!
you don't want to do the case because your client's a lesbian.
Lori, this is a high-profile case.
I have worked my entire life to associate with decency and what is good for America.
and lesbians are bad for America.
they have bad values.
reflects poorly on all of us.
as a nation.
now, would you like to tell me the real reason?
what do you mean?
I know for a fact you've represented gay clients before.
not on television, not in the news.
Brad, we're friends.
level with me.
what is it about this particular lesbian?
I'm attracted to her.
why does Shirley get to skip the staff meetings?
she's got a trial in New York later this week, so she has a busy day.
some of us have trials today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to cut out.
what's your case about, Brad?
what is it about?
it involves interference with contractual relations.
you mean...
lesbians.
where are you?
today they're calling Tracey to testify that her ex-lover was...
lesbian ex-lover.
to testify that Tracey was scamming her for money.
Tracey was, in fact, not an actual bona fide...
lesbian?
you like saying it. - I do.
say it again. - Lesbian.
keep going. - Lesbian, lesbian...
lesbian.
all together now.
lesbian.
I also like to watch. How many people are lesbian?
all right, that's enough. This is a staff meeting.
I'll ask you all to conduct yourselves appropriately and professionally.
cookies, everyone.
nourishment is most important in the morning.
who is this woman? - Take two, Tara.
you're a rail. - Who is this woman?
the ones on the left have a little bran to help our older lawyers with their routine.
who is this woman?
I'm Catherine Piper. I'm Alan's new assistant.
my, don't you have an interesting face.
we are in the middle of a staff meeting.
no need to be snippy, dear, especially since I come bearing treats.
you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
you certainly make one...
with all that bleach.
ma'am, you will have to leave.
I'm beginning to not like you.
well, if you'll excuse me, I have a trial myself.
you have a trial?
Yes, tomorrow morning.
I've got to go meet with my client. - What kind of trial?
criminal.
it's a doctor who did...
something against the law.
who else is with you on this trial?
nobody. I decided to fly solo.
think about that.
tell Shirley.
Denny Crane without a co-pilot.
dear god in heaven.
Alan. - You're in the men's room again.
I need a favor.
certainly. My stall or yours?
driving into work this morning,
I heard of a trial involving this new wonder diet drug.
the drug, and accordingly the trial, are making the news, and then I heard something very disturbing.
the name of the lawyer handling the defense.
Denny Crane. / Nobody wants this firm held up to ridicule.
nobody wants Denny exposed.
I've been in court with Denny.
he knows what he's doing at least 50% of the time.
I like him, you like him.
I have to be in New York.
if she tries to pee standing up, come and get me.
lock and load.
Tracey, we can still make this go away.
how many times must you both say that?
until you consider it.
are you sure you want your personal life probed with details at 11: 00?
I didn't steal from her, and I won't offer her anything to settle.
I'd appreciate you being on my side.
Hey, we're on your side. - All right.
we met at an AIDS fundraiser about two years ago.
we were both publicists, so we had a lot in common.
and at some point, Ms. Rogers, you and the defendant became lovers?
Yes. She moved into my home.
ultimately, we became business partners and formed Rogers and Green, which became one of the top P. R. firms in Boston.
and what happened?
well, quite simply, after she gained access to my files and my clients, - she stole them. - Objection.
sustained.
I since learned that she's not even gay, that she basically pretended to be so that she could gain access to my clientoster.
now, Ms. Rogers, when you allege that the defendant pretended to be gay...
she had boyfriends before me and one after.
perhaps that makes her bisexual. It doesn't make any difference, because I specifically asked her that at the beginning of our relationship.
whether she was bisexual. - Yes.
I'd been hurt before by heterosexual women experimenting, and I didn't want to go down that road again.
she told me she was gay.
that was a lie, one that cost me valuable clients.
just let me understand this.
the basis of your claim is that my client faked her sexual orientation for the sole purpose of getting you to fall in love with her so she could move into your home and business and steal your clients.
Yes. When, in fact, it wasn't only your business.
you built it up together over the two years.
I founded the company, and most of the clients that she left with were mine.
now, Ms. Rogers, as business partners, as a couple, you two were quite prominent.
isn't that right? Your photos were constantly in the "Globe" or "Boston" magazine, being called the new "it girls."
you two got more publicity than your clients.
it worked to the clients' benefit as well, so I don't see your point.
well, my point is that you two got a lot of publicity together as a couple.
business just went through the roof.
even if you were defrauded, it wasn't exactly to your financial detriment.
it was certainly to my detriment when she left.
well, but even so, you make more money now than you did before even meeting Tracey, so how could you have been hurt?
how have I been hurt?
she caused me to fall in love with her. That...
that's what this is really about, isn't it, Ms. Rogers?
this isn't a business dispute. This is a domestic one.
did she break your heart? - Objection.
I'll allow it.
did she break your heart?
Yes.
you were in love with her.
now, Ms. Rogers...
during the two years that you were together with my client, do you feel that she was in love with you?
Yes.
obviously, should I get a criminal conviction, that will only make it easier for the AMA to take away my medical license.
well, you're gonna lose your license, Bob, - so I wouldn't worry about it. - Why?
there are many doctors out there prescribing medication the FDA hasn't approved for...
can I stop you?
don't be self-righteous. It's annoying.
sorry I'm late.
what are you doing here?
you asked me to second chair, Denny. Remember?
I never asked you to second chair. - Sure you did, Denny.
you said you were trying the case...
solo.
I said solo.
well, I thought you asked for backup, so I guess one of us is losing our mind.
what do you mean by that?
Denny, I'm here.
as you know, I'm starved for criminal work.
I want to do this alone.
is this about proving something?
you said tell Shirley.
is this about proving to Shirley Schmidt you han't slipped?
excuse me. I'm in a meeting.
Denny, I don't have time to say this nicely, so I'm just gonna say it with all the rough edges.
this is a criminal proceeding. That man's liberty could be at stake.
I'm jumping in second chair to cover his ass, and, yes, possibly yours as well.
could it be possible she's doing this for the publicity?
suing me?
well, call me a cynic, but for two years, you're the it girls.
you're Boston's top publicists.
business starts to wane, you leave, she's suddenly not the flavor of the month.
she sues you, presto, hot copy is the split girls all over again.
for the cost of attorney and filing fee, she's featured on every news cast.
as much as she loves the limelight, Stephanie's honorable.
I wonder.
is there a reason you keep looking at me like that?
like what?
I make you nervous.
you need to get over that.
so how many men have you been with?
why are you asking?
I asked her because she's going to be asked on the stand why she has such a hard time giving me a straight answer.
however...
it's because...
I have doubts that she really is one.
a homosexual.
Yes.
and are these doubts based on the plaintiff's evidence or your own scientific compass?
is she attracted to you, Brad?
she might be.
what?
why is it men...
I mean, is it the idea of losing one to the other side, or is it since you have feelings for her, you're anxious to believe it's mutual?
you see...
you sucker me with this buddy talk, get me to reveal my feelings, and when I do, you punish me with them.
I thought you were attracted to me.
you don't want to go there.
even so, to be forgotten so easily, and for a homosexual...
is there something taped to my forehead that says "mock me"?
isn't coffee a lovely drug?
I love brain stimulants, don't you?
Brad chase. You're defending the lesbian.
Hi. I'm Lori Colson. We haven't officially met.
Hello, dear. Catherine Piper.
for the future, I don't really appreciate comments about my hair.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make conversation, and I assumed you wouldn't want me to go anywhere near your eyebrows.
I tried diets, all of them.
I exercised.
I'd gone on Fen-Phen years ago, and that helped a little, but mainly, I just kept getting bigger.
and at some point, the defendant mentioned a new drug.
Yes. I forgot how he said he had access to it, but basically, he said he had this new drug, not on the market yet called Ramonibend, and studies showed how it could help people lose weight.
desperate as I was, I just said yes.
he sold you this drug in his office.
Yes, and he told me not to tell anyone because he said it was illegal for him to be giving it to me.
thank you, Mr. Harrison.
I can't help but notice you're really fat.
Yes.
you been fatter? - Much.
drug worked, - Huge.
I mean, I lost weight, my cholesterol went down, my HDL actually went up.
I mean, it was a godsend.
of course, till the...
you know, police cut off my supplier.
objection to the word "supplier," your honor.
it makes my client sound like a drug dealer.
he is a drug dealer. He sold him drugs.
Yes, but there's a bias that goes to the word "dealer.
he simply prescribed him medicine to help him live.
he's right.
this man almost died.
didn't he? - Didn't you?
I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes.
I mean, I was at serious risk for a major heart attack or a stroke.
probably still am.
since you stopped taking the drug?
I'm having problems again.
did my client tell you that this drug is unapproved by the FDA?
Yes.
did he tell you that, uh, - there could be side effects? - Yes.
you were fully informed. - I was.
you consented. - I did.
take it again? - Absolutely.
like the doctor. - Love him.
how's your memory? - My memory's fine.
what's my name? - Denny Crane.
like you mean it. - Denny Crane.
what's my name? - Denny Crane!
no further questions.
Stephanie Rogers is essentially accusing Ms. Green of being a heterosexual in sheep's clothing.
if successful, the plaintiff could potentially receive a judgment in excess of seven figures.
which is why perhaps...
wait, she wasn't finished.
doesn't matter how it's playing out in public, Tracey.
what matters are the 12 people in that box.
And?
I can't tell.
well, you've dated more men than women, so that puts you on the heterosexual side of the fence.
you certainly could have been confused, as they said, but the problem is you're coming off as anything but indecisive.
you seem like a woman who knows exactly what you want.
what is that supposed to mean?
nothing.
you actually think that I'm attracted to you.
I just believe you should be straight with people.
you know what I mean.
I smell some deceit here.
I'm gay, Brad.
do you want me to take a lie detector?
people lament the cost of health care.
they cry over soaring litigation costs and scream about the eroding integrity of our medical profession.
the conduct of this doctor and others like him are to blame.
Oh, lighten up, man. - Mr. Crane, you'll get your turn.
we have rules.
one is we do not go prescribing experimental drugs that the FDA hasn't approved for market.
even if the patient consents?
the patient will always follow the lead of his doctor.
for god's sake, look what people buy off infomercials.
they'll try anything, hair potions, pills that make you lose weight while you sleep.
desperate people will try anything, and when you have a licensed doctor saying "here, take this," they will.
this isn't a potion. This drug works.
in preliminary studies, but there's much, much more testing to be done.
how long does it take the FDA to approve a drug?
it isn't quick, but...
how long?
nine years.
my client's patient would be dead by then.
but, hey, you've got your rules.
objection. - Oh, be quiet.
your honor, he can't tell me to be quiet.
let him have his turn, Mr. Zale.
you say that doctors shouldn't prescribe non-FDA-approved drugs as a rule.
Yes. - Doctors don't prescribe medications for things that the FDA hasn't approved them for.
off-label prescriptions happen, but...
doctor, have you ever prescribed a drug that wasn't approved for the particular condition you were treating?
Yes, but... - and, doctor, if you were overweight and at risk for an imminent stroke or heart attack, is it your testimony that you would never consider taking Ramonibend?
for myself, I might, but...
but you wouldn't give your patient the same opportunity because you have rules.
you're going to be the first lawyer sued by his client for sexual harassment.
I'm a good lawyer because I got a nose for the truth, Lori.
you're attracted to her, Brad. It's clouding your nose.
are you falling in love with this woman?
what? Please.
are you? - Of course not.
I put a tail on her.
I beg your pardon?
I hired a P. I. just to follow her around, see who she sees.
what she sees.
you're trying to out her as a heterosexual.
I don't like surprises in court.
okay, first, you could lose your bar ticket for putting a P. I...
Why? It's not that big of a deal. - Brad, she's your client.
second, let the jury decide whether or not she's being truthful.
you just be her lawyer and only, and third...
stop hitting on her.
Hey, Brad.
all together now.
lesbian.
boys...
how's our trial going?
you think I'm just gonna wither up and die in there, don't you?
all these references to our sex life, Denny.
tell her how I'm doing, Alan.
please, since he can't recall.
he's been amazing.
I'd say we have a better-than-even chance.
is there a reason you're snuggled up to me?
well, yes.
I understand you're the boss, dear.
I'm sucking up.
by standing next to me.
Yes.
with me by your side, dear, you almost look young.
I have no idea who you are, but I like you.
is he really doing okay?
the firm is safe from ridicule.
what did she want?
make sure I'm competent?
something like that.
you were more than competent today, Denny.
you were good, very good. - I know.
we must be doing our crosswords these days.
did she ask you to backstop me?
it was my idea.
damn liar. - I like doing cases with you, Denny.
can't you just accept that? It's fun.
fun, fine. I'll go with that, then.
you have seemed especially acute. Are we taking something?
I just rubbed on a little clear cream. It was just for muscle cramps.
are you taking something?
what I am taking is good care of myself.
the old Denny Crane is coming back.
our business had reached sort of a plateau, and I felt I could do better solo.
and truthfully, I thought that she might, too.
now, before leaving, did you tell your clients?
absolutely not.
I left, I contacted them, they decided to come with me, in that order.
now, Tracey, we've heard the accusation that you pretended to love Stephanie for business reasons.
it's absolutely false.
I fell in love with her.
I mean, the idea that I could feign love for 2-plus years just...
you know how much I loved you, Stephanie.
ms. Green, please do not address anyone but me or your counsel.
I never lied to her about my sexual orientation, and I'm offended by that.
how many women had you been with prior to your relationship with my client?
objection. - Overruled.
however salacious, it's in issue.
how many women?
one. - One.
and prior to your relationship with my client, how many men had you had sexual relationships with?
several. - Several.
more than five? - Yes.
more than 10? - I wanted to lead a heterosexual life.
eventually, I realized...
my client asked you if you were bisexual.
you answered no. - Because I'm not.
I may have been with men in the past, but ultimately, I realized I preferred women.
how many relationships have you had since Stephanie?
one. - With a man or a woman?
look, the breakup with Stephanie was extremely painful.
your subsequent relationship was with a man or a woman?
a man. - A man.
now, you spoke earlier about the exact order of how things went down.
rewinding a little further back, you met Stephanie, became her lover, eventually became her business partner, left with clients and files, began having an affair with a man.
did I get the order right?
I just got destroyed.
didn't I?
you didn't get destroyed.
it was a tough cross, but I thought you held up.
Really?
really.
you know...
to think that I'm straight is to believe that I'm a profoundly dishonest person.
and I'm not dishonest, Brad.
okay. - You know, I...
I can take you doubting my sexual orientation but...
my character, I, uh...
I don't doubt you.
she's trying to admit something. - What, that she's not gay?
I don't know. Maybe.
you're making a fool of yourself, Brad.
I know when I'm being deceived, Tara.
the deception is self-inflicted.
you're infatuated with her, and you want to believe it's reciprocal.
she's probably more interested in me than you.
you're making a fool of yourself.
I considered it life or death.
he was at risk of cardiac arrest, diabetes...
and this drug was your only resort?
it was my last resort.
believe me, I am not in the habit of prescribing non-approved drugs, but this...
doctor, would you tell the jury and me, too, for that matter, because I've forgotten.
how Ramonibend works.
it suppresses a protein in the brain that makes you want to eat.
in fact, this drug blocks nearly all cravings.
it can be used to help people quit smoking, drinking.
which is why it's been called the wonder drug.
so you just figured what the hell, why wait for proof?
my patient couldn't wait, Mr. Zale.
he was looking at an imminent physical demise.
in medical terms, we call it death.
any published studies on this drug?
to justify this wonder status you give it.
not yet. - Has this drug been approved for sale?
not yet.
how'd you get your hands on this drug, doctor?
I had a connection at one of the clinics where it's being tested.
I won't reveal more than that.
you're a licensed doctor， prescribing a drug not approved by the FDA to desperate patients.
with a full warning.
how can you warn about a drug side effect you don't know about?
the warning that I gave Mr. Harrison was exactly that.
this drug may have side effects we don't know about.
possible fatal side effects.
there's no evidence of that. - So you decided...
balancing the benefits against the known risk of a coronary if he doesn't take it, I favor taking the medication.
this is an experimental drug. - Which I have no financial interest in.
which you bootlegged. - My only concern was a patient's health.
so doctors should feel free to ignore the FDA whenever they choose.
I never said that. - So you should feel free whenever you choose.
sometimes desperate circumstances require desperate measures.
and desperate people will do anything, won't they?
you're checking on me in here, too?
think I forgot how to piss?
I beg your pardon?
I'm tired of being followed around like some patient.
I change my underwear every day. I know how to practice law.
and if you're the one who assigned Alan Shore to backstop me, - then you better stop... - You listen.
I'm still talking. - Now I'm talking.
you arrogant old fart, you have a client facing prison time.
you have no right to exalt your ego.
don't you talk to me in that...
shut up!
I am sick of you feeling sorry for yourself and only yourself.
it was selfish of you to try this case solo.
do not start a war with me here.
you may not win it.
that's why you brought Shirley back.
to build an alliance!
guess you're the one who forgot how to piss.
does it smell right to you?
she had a history of men before my client.
she never hinted to her best friends that she was anything but heterosexual.
she had an affair with a man after she left my client.
her only fling with homosexuality just happened to coincide with the biggest financial windfall of her life.
suddenly being gay got her money, got her profiled about town in magazines, on tv, as an it girl.
newfound fame, newfound money, newfound sexual orientation.
does it smell right to you?
in order to make a cause of action for fraud, one must prove that he or she relied on the fraud to his or her own detriment.
now, after partnering with my client,
ms. Rogers' financial and professional fortunes soared.
she benefited.
in fact, one might even say, considering the media coverage of this lawsuit, that she's actually benefiting from the breakup, because as any P. R. professional knows, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
but if you're determined to get hung up on the issue is Tracey Green gay or not, did she really love Stephanie or not, consider Stephanie's own testimony.
when I asked her during the relationship as she was living it, did she feel that Tracey loved her?
and she answered yes.
but now in the wake of hurt and heartbreak, she offers a different answer.
which version do you find more reliable?
anything?
no, they're still deliberating.
what's this? - I haven't the slightest idea.
your secretary said you'd want it sooner rather than later.
what is it?
it's nothing. It's just another case I'm working on.
do I have to convince you of the danger of prescribing non-approved drugs?
defrauding overweight people with diet gimmicks is a billion-dollar industry, and now we're going to let doctors get in on the racket and say it's okay to sell black-market pills under the table?
it's precisely because physicians have such an influence over their patients that we demand that drugs be approved by the FDA.
but this doctor decided he shouldn't be held to that.
this doctor figured he's above the law.
this doctor is the equivalent of a drug dealer selling cocaine in an alleyway, and he should be punished accordingly.
I thought I was closing. - I'm first chair.
you got to ask all the questions. - Objection.
your honor, these two have tried to trivialize the severity of this case with their Abbott and Costello routine, but it's an insult to this court.
your honor, it's only fair I get to do something here.
Mr. Shore, the court is anything but amused.
I'm not. - No, I, I got it.
we'll split it.
you go first.
fine.
okay, first, this big deal about FDA approval...
doctors prescribe medications every day for uses the FDA never considered.
aspirin, for years, has been used to prevent and treat heart attacks.
did the FDA ever test for that? No.
it was sanctioned only as a pain reliever until recently.
beta-blockers are prescribed for migraines with no FDA approval.
we take anti-convulsants for pain, for bipolar disorders.
antidepressants for insomnia, steroids for cancer.
people in this country are getting prescriptions by the thousands every day from their doctors for treatments the FDA never signed off on.
and what about the FDA?
david Graham, a drug reviewer with the agency, just testified before congress that the FDA is, I quote, "virtually incapable of protecting America from unsafe drugs.
the FDA is broken, folks.
raise your hand if you agree, except those of you on vioxin.
objection. - The FDA's own point man said to congress that we are currently facing the single greatest drug safety catastrophe in the history of the world.
so who, then, is there to protect the patient?
who is there to protect Mr. Harrison?
his doctor.
my client had a medication that could save his patient's life.
he wasn't going to wait nine years for approval from a broken, ineffective agency.
this is life or death, for god's sake.
life or death.
I'm at risk for Alzheimer's.
I've got some sort of plaque going on inside my brain.
my memory...
I might have met some of you before. I wouldn't know.
what you wouldn't know is what it feels like to be...
losing it, to be...
feel...
to be slipping.
there's a prescription drug...
dextroamphetamine.
it's very big on the black market.
it's used by college kids to bone up for exams.
I've been taking it.
I don't know how it works, but you get your memory back.
it reintroduces you to your vocabulary, helps with mental arithmetic, facial recognition, overall productivity.
basically...
you get your brain back.
and no FDA or any other agency is gonna tell me I don't have the right to get back my brain.
no government or, or court is gonna tell me, order me to continue losing my mind.
I agree with the prosecutor.
his claim that desperate people will try desperate measures.
so what?
members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, your honor. - We have, your honor.
what say you? - In the matter of Rogers vs. Green...
in the matter of the commonwealth of Massachusetts vs. Dr. Robert Mclean...
we the jury find in favor of the defendant.
we find the defendant Dr. Robert Mclean not guilty.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I want to thank you for your service.
at this time, you are dismissed.
court adjourned.
so did she say anything after?
she just shot me a look when she was leaving the courthouse.
she'll get over it.
Yeah, I bet she will.
who knows? Maybe we'll even get back together one day.
wouldn't be surprised.
so why did you want to have dinner, Brad?
to celebrate the victory or, uh...
take one last shot at conversion?
I wanted to have dinner to apologize.
I did a really...
terrible thing.
I hired a private investigator to follow you.
I wanted to satisfy myself that you were really gay, and I'm quite satisfied now.
you went to see Stephanie around midnight last night.
why would you do that?
well, had it half right. Didn't I?
you know, thinking Stephanie sued you for...
the publicity.
you were both in on it.
it girls or split girls...
however you make the news, you two are a really good team.
because I knew I was being deceived.
I just wasn't sure how.
I didn't plan for you to fall for me.
well, don't flatter yourself.
I think that I should leave.
no, no, you don't have to. We won the case.
come on, this is a celebration.
I'm gonna leave.
thank you, Brad.
um, and again,
I'm sorry if...
thank you.
that drug you're taking is an amphetamine with a dangerously high potential for abuse and addiction.
the shrinks are doling it out like candy.
might make you feel more acute.
you'll no doubt work like a demon.
but certain pleasures will be gone.
like?
perhaps fishing...
perhaps sitting in a chair enjoying a football game...
standing on a balcony...
appreciating the quiet joy of a friendship.
there's more to life than recognizing faces, Denny.
you prefer me in my fog?
I prefer you.
your perspective and your humor, the acceptance and humility which...
perhaps can only come with age.
I prefer you.
I've stopped taking the drug.
I kind of like my fog, too.
there's a certain license that goes with it.
Plus, I've said this before, and I'll say it again.
the answers in life...
you don't find them here.
first you look to god...
and then...
fox news.
damn right.
you Democrats.
you Republicans.
Shirley know I won?
told her myself. - What'd she say?
she'd like to have your children.
damn right.
the trial starts tomorrow.
I can bring you up to speed on it. The facts are straightforward.
and why can't Tara do it?
well, Tara's a junior associate.
this trial's gonna be in the news. It's hardly the kind of case that...
Brad, it isn't the case so much as it is the client, right?
and it isn't who she is so much as what she is, right?
what is she, Brad?
can't you even say the word?
I can say it. - Well, what is she, Brad?
she's a...
homosexual.
and what's the word for a female homosexual?
lesbian. - I couldn't really hear that.
she's a lesbian!
you don't want to do the case because your client's a lesbian.
Lori, this is a high-profile case.
I have worked my entire life to associate with decency and what is good for America.
and lesbians are bad for America.
they have bad values.
reflects poorly on all of us.
as a nation.
now, would you like to tell me the real reason?
what do you mean?
I know for a fact you've represented gay clients before.
not on television, not in the news.
Brad, we're friends.
level with me.
what is it about this particular lesbian?
I'm attracted to her.
why does Shirley get to skip the staff meetings?
she's got a trial in New York later this week, so she has a busy day.
some of us have trials today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to cut out.
what's your case about, Brad?
what is it about?
it involves interference with contractual relations.
you mean...
lesbians.
where are you?
today they're calling Tracey to testify that her ex-lover was...
lesbian ex-lover.
to testify that Tracey was scamming her for money.
Tracey was, in fact, not an actual bona fide...
lesbian?
you like saying it. - I do.
say it again. - Lesbian.
keep going. - Lesbian, lesbian...
lesbian.
all together now.
lesbian.
I also like to watch. How many people are lesbian?
all right, that's enough. This is a staff meeting.
I'll ask you all to conduct yourselves appropriately and professionally.
cookies, everyone.
nourishment is most important in the morning.
who is this woman? - Take two, Tara.
you're a rail. - Who is this woman?
the ones on the left have a little bran to help our older lawyers with their routine.
who is this woman?
I'm Catherine Piper. I'm Alan's new assistant.
my, don't you have an interesting face.
we are in the middle of a staff meeting.
no need to be snippy, dear, especially since I come bearing treats.
you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
you certainly make one...
with all that bleach.
ma'am, you will have to leave.
I'm beginning to not like you.
well, if you'll excuse me, I have a trial myself.
you have a trial?
Yes, tomorrow morning.
I've got to go meet with my client. - What kind of trial?
criminal.
it's a doctor who did...
something against the law.
who else is with you on this trial?
nobody. I decided to fly solo.
think about that.
tell Shirley.
Denny Crane without a co-pilot.
dear god in heaven.
Alan. - You're in the men's room again.
I need a favor.
certainly. My stall or yours?
driving into work this morning,
I heard of a trial involving this new wonder diet drug.
the drug, and accordingly the trial, are making the news, and then I heard something very disturbing.
the name of the lawyer handling the defense.
Denny Crane. / Nobody wants this firm held up to ridicule.
nobody wants Denny exposed.
I've been in court with Denny.
he knows what he's doing at least 50% of the time.
I like him, you like him.
I have to be in New York.
if she tries to pee standing up, come and get me.
lock and load.
Tracey, we can still make this go away.
how many times must you both say that?
until you consider it.
are you sure you want your personal life probed with details at 11: 00?
I didn't steal from her, and I won't offer her anything to settle.
I'd appreciate you being on my side.
Hey, we're on your side. - All right.
we met at an AIDS fundraiser about two years ago.
we were both publicists, so we had a lot in common.
and at some point, Ms. Rogers, you and the defendant became lovers?
Yes. She moved into my home.
ultimately, we became business partners and formed Rogers and Green, which became one of the top P. R. firms in Boston.
and what happened?
well, quite simply, after she gained access to my files and my clients, - she stole them. - Objection.
sustained.
I since learned that she's not even gay, that she basically pretended to be so that she could gain access to my clientoster.
now, Ms. Rogers, when you allege that the defendant pretended to be gay...
she had boyfriends before me and one after.
perhaps that makes her bisexual. It doesn't make any difference, because I specifically asked her that at the beginning of our relationship.
whether she was bisexual. - Yes.
I'd been hurt before by heterosexual women experimenting, and I didn't want to go down that road again.
she told me she was gay.
that was a lie, one that cost me valuable clients.
just let me understand this.
the basis of your claim is that my client faked her sexual orientation for the sole purpose of getting you to fall in love with her so she could move into your home and business and steal your clients.
Yes. When, in fact, it wasn't only your business.
you built it up together over the two years.
I founded the company, and most of the clients that she left with were mine.
now, Ms. Rogers, as business partners, as a couple, you two were quite prominent.
isn't that right? Your photos were constantly in the "Globe" or "Boston" magazine, being called the new "it girls."
you two got more publicity than your clients.
it worked to the clients' benefit as well, so I don't see your point.
well, my point is that you two got a lot of publicity together as a couple.
business just went through the roof.
even if you were defrauded, it wasn't exactly to your financial detriment.
it was certainly to my detriment when she left.
well, but even so, you make more money now than you did before even meeting Tracey, so how could you have been hurt?
how have I been hurt?
she caused me to fall in love with her. That...
that's what this is really about, isn't it, Ms. Rogers?
this isn't a business dispute. This is a domestic one.
did she break your heart? - Objection.
I'll allow it.
did she break your heart?
Yes.
you were in love with her.
now, Ms. Rogers...
during the two years that you were together with my client, do you feel that she was in love with you?
Yes.
obviously, should I get a criminal conviction, that will only make it easier for the AMA to take away my medical license.
well, you're gonna lose your license, Bob, - so I wouldn't worry about it. - Why?
there are many doctors out there prescribing medication the FDA hasn't approved for...
can I stop you?
don't be self-righteous. It's annoying.
sorry I'm late.
what are you doing here?
you asked me to second chair, Denny. Remember?
I never asked you to second chair. - Sure you did, Denny.
you said you were trying the case...
solo.
I said solo.
well, I thought you asked for backup, so I guess one of us is losing our mind.
what do you mean by that?
Denny, I'm here.
as you know, I'm starved for criminal work.
I want to do this alone.
is this about proving something?
you said tell Shirley.
is this about proving to Shirley Schmidt you han't slipped?
excuse me. I'm in a meeting.
Denny, I don't have time to say this nicely, so I'm just gonna say it with all the rough edges.
this is a criminal proceeding. That man's liberty could be at stake.
I'm jumping in second chair to cover his ass, and, yes, possibly yours as well.
could it be possible she's doing this for the publicity?
suing me?
well, call me a cynic, but for two years, you're the it girls.
you're Boston's top publicists.
business starts to wane, you leave, she's suddenly not the flavor of the month.
she sues you, presto, hot copy is the split girls all over again.
for the cost of attorney and filing fee, she's featured on every news cast.
as much as she loves the limelight, Stephanie's honorable.
I wonder.
is there a reason you keep looking at me like that?
like what?
I make you nervous.
you need to get over that.
so how many men have you been with?
why are you asking?
I asked her because she's going to be asked on the stand why she has such a hard time giving me a straight answer.
however...
it's because...
I have doubts that she really is one.
a homosexual.
Yes.
and are these doubts based on the plaintiff's evidence or your own scientific compass?
is she attracted to you, Brad?
she might be.
what?
why is it men...
I mean, is it the idea of losing one to the other side, or is it since you have feelings for her, you're anxious to believe it's mutual?
you see...
you sucker me with this buddy talk, get me to reveal my feelings, and when I do, you punish me with them.
I thought you were attracted to me.
you don't want to go there.
even so, to be forgotten so easily, and for a homosexual...
is there something taped to my forehead that says "mock me"?
isn't coffee a lovely drug?
I love brain stimulants, don't you?
Brad chase. You're defending the lesbian.
Hi. I'm Lori Colson. We haven't officially met.
Hello, dear. Catherine Piper.
for the future, I don't really appreciate comments about my hair.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make conversation, and I assumed you wouldn't want me to go anywhere near your eyebrows.
I tried diets, all of them.
I exercised.
I'd gone on Fen-Phen years ago, and that helped a little, but mainly, I just kept getting bigger.
and at some point, the defendant mentioned a new drug.
Yes. I forgot how he said he had access to it, but basically, he said he had this new drug, not on the market yet called Ramonibend, and studies showed how it could help people lose weight.
desperate as I was, I just said yes.
he sold you this drug in his office.
Yes, and he told me not to tell anyone because he said it was illegal for him to be giving it to me.
thank you, Mr. Harrison.
I can't help but notice you're really fat.
Yes.
you been fatter? - Much.
drug worked, - Huge.
I mean, I lost weight, my cholesterol went down, my HDL actually went up.
I mean, it was a godsend.
of course, till the...
you know, police cut off my supplier.
objection to the word "supplier," your honor.
it makes my client sound like a drug dealer.
he is a drug dealer. He sold him drugs.
Yes, but there's a bias that goes to the word "dealer.
he simply prescribed him medicine to help him live.
he's right.
this man almost died.
didn't he? - Didn't you?
I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes.
I mean, I was at serious risk for a major heart attack or a stroke.
probably still am.
since you stopped taking the drug?
I'm having problems again.
did my client tell you that this drug is unapproved by the FDA?
Yes.
did he tell you that, uh, - there could be side effects? - Yes.
you were fully informed. - I was.
you consented. - I did.
take it again? - Absolutely.
like the doctor. - Love him.
how's your memory? - My memory's fine.
what's my name? - Denny Crane.
like you mean it. - Denny Crane.
what's my name? - Denny Crane!
no further questions.
Stephanie Rogers is essentially accusing Ms. Green of being a heterosexual in sheep's clothing.
if successful, the plaintiff could potentially receive a judgment in excess of seven figures.
which is why perhaps...
wait, she wasn't finished.
doesn't matter how it's playing out in public, Tracey.
what matters are the 12 people in that box.
And?
I can't tell.
well, you've dated more men than women, so that puts you on the heterosexual side of the fence.
you certainly could have been confused, as they said, but the problem is you're coming off as anything but indecisive.
you seem like a woman who knows exactly what you want.
what is that supposed to mean?
nothing.
you actually think that I'm attracted to you.
I just believe you should be straight with people.
you know what I mean.
I smell some deceit here.
I'm gay, Brad.
do you want me to take a lie detector?
people lament the cost of health care.
they cry over soaring litigation costs and scream about the eroding integrity of our medical profession.
the conduct of this doctor and others like him are to blame.
Oh, lighten up, man. - Mr. Crane, you'll get your turn.
we have rules.
one is we do not go prescribing experimental drugs that the FDA hasn't approved for market.
even if the patient consents?
the patient will always follow the lead of his doctor.
for god's sake, look what people buy off infomercials.
they'll try anything, hair potions, pills that make you lose weight while you sleep.
desperate people will try anything, and when you have a licensed doctor saying "here, take this," they will.
this isn't a potion. This drug works.
in preliminary studies, but there's much, much more testing to be done.
how long does it take the FDA to approve a drug?
it isn't quick, but...
how long?
nine years.
my client's patient would be dead by then.
but, hey, you've got your rules.
objection. - Oh, be quiet.
your honor, he can't tell me to be quiet.
let him have his turn, Mr. Zale.
you say that doctors shouldn't prescribe non-FDA-approved drugs as a rule.
Yes. - Doctors don't prescribe medications for things that the FDA hasn't approved them for.
off-label prescriptions happen, but...
doctor, have you ever prescribed a drug that wasn't approved for the particular condition you were treating?
Yes, but... - and, doctor, if you were overweight and at risk for an imminent stroke or heart attack, is it your testimony that you would never consider taking Ramonibend?
for myself, I might, but...
but you wouldn't give your patient the same opportunity because you have rules.
you're going to be the first lawyer sued by his client for sexual harassment.
I'm a good lawyer because I got a nose for the truth, Lori.
you're attracted to her, Brad. It's clouding your nose.
are you falling in love with this woman?
what? Please.
are you? - Of course not.
I put a tail on her.
I beg your pardon?
I hired a P. I. just to follow her around, see who she sees.
what she sees.
you're trying to out her as a heterosexual.
I don't like surprises in court.
okay, first, you could lose your bar ticket for putting a P. I...
Why? It's not that big of a deal. - Brad, she's your client.
second, let the jury decide whether or not she's being truthful.
you just be her lawyer and only, and third...
stop hitting on her.
Hey, Brad.
all together now.
lesbian.
boys...
how's our trial going?
you think I'm just gonna wither up and die in there, don't you?
all these references to our sex life, Denny.
tell her how I'm doing, Alan.
please, since he can't recall.
he's been amazing.
I'd say we have a better-than-even chance.
is there a reason you're snuggled up to me?
well, yes.
I understand you're the boss, dear.
I'm sucking up.
by standing next to me.
Yes.
with me by your side, dear, you almost look young.
I have no idea who you are, but I like you.
is he really doing okay?
the firm is safe from ridicule.
what did she want?
make sure I'm competent?
something like that.
you were more than competent today, Denny.
you were good, very good. - I know.
we must be doing our crosswords these days.
did she ask you to backstop me?
it was my idea.
damn liar. - I like doing cases with you, Denny.
can't you just accept that? It's fun.
fun, fine. I'll go with that, then.
you have seemed especially acute. Are we taking something?
I just rubbed on a little clear cream. It was just for muscle cramps.
are you taking something?
what I am taking is good care of myself.
the old Denny Crane is coming back.
our business had reached sort of a plateau, and I felt I could do better solo.
and truthfully, I thought that she might, too.
now, before leaving, did you tell your clients?
absolutely not.
I left, I contacted them, they decided to come with me, in that order.
now, Tracey, we've heard the accusation that you pretended to love Stephanie for business reasons.
it's absolutely false.
I fell in love with her.
I mean, the idea that I could feign love for 2-plus years just...
you know how much I loved you, Stephanie.
ms. Green, please do not address anyone but me or your counsel.
I never lied to her about my sexual orientation, and I'm offended by that.
how many women had you been with prior to your relationship with my client?
objection. - Overruled.
however salacious, it's in issue.
how many women?
one. - One.
and prior to your relationship with my client, how many men had you had sexual relationships with?
several. - Several.
more than five? - Yes.
more than 10? - I wanted to lead a heterosexual life.
eventually, I realized...
my client asked you if you were bisexual.
you answered no. - Because I'm not.
I may have been with men in the past, but ultimately, I realized I preferred women.
how many relationships have you had since Stephanie?
one. - With a man or a woman?
look, the breakup with Stephanie was extremely painful.
your subsequent relationship was with a man or a woman?
a man. - A man.
now, you spoke earlier about the exact order of how things went down.
rewinding a little further back, you met Stephanie, became her lover, eventually became her business partner, left with clients and files, began having an affair with a man.
did I get the order right?
I just got destroyed.
didn't I?
you didn't get destroyed.
it was a tough cross, but I thought you held up.
Really?
really.
you know...
to think that I'm straight is to believe that I'm a profoundly dishonest person.
and I'm not dishonest, Brad.
okay. - You know, I...
I can take you doubting my sexual orientation but...
my character, I, uh...
I don't doubt you.
she's trying to admit something. - What, that she's not gay?
I don't know. Maybe.
you're making a fool of yourself, Brad.
I know when I'm being deceived, Tara.
the deception is self-inflicted.
you're infatuated with her, and you want to believe it's reciprocal.
she's probably more interested in me than you.
you're making a fool of yourself.
I considered it life or death.
he was at risk of cardiac arrest, diabetes...
and this drug was your only resort?
it was my last resort.
believe me, I am not in the habit of prescribing non-approved drugs, but this...
doctor, would you tell the jury and me, too, for that matter, because I've forgotten.
how Ramonibend works.
it suppresses a protein in the brain that makes you want to eat.
in fact, this drug blocks nearly all cravings.
it can be used to help people quit smoking, drinking.
which is why it's been called the wonder drug.
so you just figured what the hell, why wait for proof?
my patient couldn't wait, Mr. Zale.
he was looking at an imminent physical demise.
in medical terms, we call it death.
any published studies on this drug?
to justify this wonder status you give it.
not yet. - Has this drug been approved for sale?
not yet.
how'd you get your hands on this drug, doctor?
I had a connection at one of the clinics where it's being tested.
I won't reveal more than that.
you're a licensed doctor， prescribing a drug not approved by the FDA to desperate patients.
with a full warning.
how can you warn about a drug side effect you don't know about?
the warning that I gave Mr. Harrison was exactly that.
this drug may have side effects we don't know about.
possible fatal side effects.
there's no evidence of that. - So you decided...
balancing the benefits against the known risk of a coronary if he doesn't take it, I favor taking the medication.
this is an experimental drug. - Which I have no financial interest in.
which you bootlegged. - My only concern was a patient's health.
so doctors should feel free to ignore the FDA whenever they choose.
I never said that. - So you should feel free whenever you choose.
sometimes desperate circumstances require desperate measures.
and desperate people will do anything, won't they?
you're checking on me in here, too?
think I forgot how to piss?
I beg your pardon?
I'm tired of being followed around like some patient.
I change my underwear every day. I know how to practice law.
and if you're the one who assigned Alan Shore to backstop me, - then you better stop... - You listen.
I'm still talking. - Now I'm talking.
you arrogant old fart, you have a client facing prison time.
you have no right to exalt your ego.
don't you talk to me in that...
shut up!
I am sick of you feeling sorry for yourself and only yourself.
it was selfish of you to try this case solo.
do not start a war with me here.
you may not win it.
that's why you brought Shirley back.
to build an alliance!
guess you're the one who forgot how to piss.
does it smell right to you?
she had a history of men before my client.
she never hinted to her best friends that she was anything but heterosexual.
she had an affair with a man after she left my client.
her only fling with homosexuality just happened to coincide with the biggest financial windfall of her life.
suddenly being gay got her money, got her profiled about town in magazines, on tv, as an it girl.
newfound fame, newfound money, newfound sexual orientation.
does it smell right to you?
in order to make a cause of action for fraud, one must prove that he or she relied on the fraud to his or her own detriment.
now, after partnering with my client,
ms. Rogers' financial and professional fortunes soared.
she benefited.
in fact, one might even say, considering the media coverage of this lawsuit, that she's actually benefiting from the breakup, because as any P. R. professional knows, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
but if you're determined to get hung up on the issue is Tracey Green gay or not, did she really love Stephanie or not, consider Stephanie's own testimony.
when I asked her during the relationship as she was living it, did she feel that Tracey loved her?
and she answered yes.
but now in the wake of hurt and heartbreak, she offers a different answer.
which version do you find more reliable?
anything?
no, they're still deliberating.
what's this? - I haven't the slightest idea.
your secretary said you'd want it sooner rather than later.
what is it?
it's nothing. It's just another case I'm working on.
do I have to convince you of the danger of prescribing non-approved drugs?
defrauding overweight people with diet gimmicks is a billion-dollar industry, and now we're going to let doctors get in on the racket and say it's okay to sell black-market pills under the table?
it's precisely because physicians have such an influence over their patients that we demand that drugs be approved by the FDA.
but this doctor decided he shouldn't be held to that.
this doctor figured he's above the law.
this doctor is the equivalent of a drug dealer selling cocaine in an alleyway, and he should be punished accordingly.
I thought I was closing. - I'm first chair.
you got to ask all the questions. - Objection.
your honor, these two have tried to trivialize the severity of this case with their Abbott and Costello routine, but it's an insult to this court.
your honor, it's only fair I get to do something here.
Mr. Shore, the court is anything but amused.
I'm not. - No, I, I got it.
we'll split it.
you go first.
fine.
okay, first, this big deal about FDA approval...
doctors prescribe medications every day for uses the FDA never considered.
aspirin, for years, has been used to prevent and treat heart attacks.
did the FDA ever test for that? No.
it was sanctioned only as a pain reliever until recently.
beta-blockers are prescribed for migraines with no FDA approval.
we take anti-convulsants for pain, for bipolar disorders.
antidepressants for insomnia, steroids for cancer.
people in this country are getting prescriptions by the thousands every day from their doctors for treatments the FDA never signed off on.
and what about the FDA?
david Graham, a drug reviewer with the agency, just testified before congress that the FDA is, I quote, "virtually incapable of protecting America from unsafe drugs.
the FDA is broken, folks.
raise your hand if you agree, except those of you on vioxin.
objection. - The FDA's own point man said to congress that we are currently facing the single greatest drug safety catastrophe in the history of the world.
so who, then, is there to protect the patient?
who is there to protect Mr. Harrison?
his doctor.
my client had a medication that could save his patient's life.
he wasn't going to wait nine years for approval from a broken, ineffective agency.
this is life or death, for god's sake.
life or death.
I'm at risk for Alzheimer's.
I've got some sort of plaque going on inside my brain.
my memory...
I might have met some of you before. I wouldn't know.
what you wouldn't know is what it feels like to be...
losing it, to be...
feel...
to be slipping.
there's a prescription drug...
dextroamphetamine.
it's very big on the black market.
it's used by college kids to bone up for exams.
I've been taking it.
I don't know how it works, but you get your memory back.
it reintroduces you to your vocabulary, helps with mental arithmetic, facial recognition, overall productivity.
basically...
you get your brain back.
and no FDA or any other agency is gonna tell me I don't have the right to get back my brain.
no government or, or court is gonna tell me, order me to continue losing my mind.
I agree with the prosecutor.
his claim that desperate people will try desperate measures.
so what?
members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, your honor. - We have, your honor.
what say you? - In the matter of Rogers vs. Green...
in the matter of the commonwealth of Massachusetts vs. Dr. Robert Mclean...
we the jury find in favor of the defendant.
we find the defendant Dr. Robert Mclean not guilty.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I want to thank you for your service.
at this time, you are dismissed.
court adjourned.
so did she say anything after?
she just shot me a look when she was leaving the courthouse.
she'll get over it.
Yeah, I bet she will.
who knows? Maybe we'll even get back together one day.
wouldn't be surprised.
so why did you want to have dinner, Brad?
to celebrate the victory or, uh...
take one last shot at conversion?
I wanted to have dinner to apologize.
I did a really...
terrible thing.
I hired a private investigator to follow you.
I wanted to satisfy myself that you were really gay, and I'm quite satisfied now.
you went to see Stephanie around midnight last night.
why would you do that?
well, had it half right. Didn't I?
you know, thinking Stephanie sued you for...
the publicity.
you were both in on it.
it girls or split girls...
however you make the news, you two are a really good team.
because I knew I was being deceived.
I just wasn't sure how.
I didn't plan for you to fall for me.
well, don't flatter yourself.
I think that I should leave.
no, no, you don't have to. We won the case.
come on, this is a celebration.
I'm gonna leave.
thank you, Brad.
um, and again,
I'm sorry if...
thank you.
that drug you're taking is an amphetamine with a dangerously high potential for abuse and addiction.
the shrinks are doling it out like candy.
might make you feel more acute.
you'll no doubt work like a demon.
but certain pleasures will be gone.
like?
perhaps fishing...
perhaps sitting in a chair enjoying a football game...
standing on a balcony...
appreciating the quiet joy of a friendship.
there's more to life than recognizing faces, Denny.
you prefer me in my fog?
I prefer you.
your perspective and your humor, the acceptance and humility which...
perhaps can only come with age.
I prefer you.
I've stopped taking the drug.
I kind of like my fog, too.
there's a certain license that goes with it.
Plus, I've said this before, and I'll say it again.
the answers in life...
you don't find them here.
first you look to god...
and then...
fox news.
damn right.
you Democrats.
you Republicans.
Shirley know I won?
told her myself. - What'd she say?
she'd like to have your children.
damn right.
we're letting you go.
Why? -You're fat.
so if I was thin, I. I'd still have my job?
if you were thin, I'd probably try and have sex with you.
wait, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've been damaged. We'll see you all in court.
she's not coming back to a firm of fat bigots.
are you this hostile in bed?
keep talking, Mr. Crane. All I hear is ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching.
you're fat.
off you go now. Take the man-eater with you.
my name is Leigh Swift.
and I am here today in hopes of securing legal counsel.
hello. -Hello.
would you like to get a drink with me?
you need to keep reminding yourself that this is a good thing.
no, it's not.
please don't use my name.
when you say my name, it reminds me who I am, which is Jerry Espenson, which is not a good thing to be at all in this situation.
okay, first, stop pacing. It's driving me.
stay!
you've had two wonderful dates.
and we all know what's supposed to happen on the third date after two wonderful dates, don't we?
you've really never kissed a wan?
not a real one.
well, it's actually quite simple.
you just move your head towards hers until your lips touch.
well, what about the tongue business? What am I supposed to do about that?
you just sort of.
slip it in and, you know, move it around a little.
Oh, well. Shouldn't you just write the book?
Jerry, the thing about a first kiss, the combination of the psychological and physical stimuli can be overwhelming.
it's best to separate the two.
that would be helpful if I had any idea what you said.
look.
you're standing at the door with your date.
Lorraine. -Alan, please.
you look into her eyes, you hold each other's gaze.
you're essentially kissing now.
not physically, but you're both saying with eye contact how much you long for the taste of each other's lips.
you moisten your own lips gently with your tongue.
a simple kiss now almost seems like nothing, and yet, it's everything.
because there is nothing so gentle as that first kiss.
Jerry left us.
it's only a kiss, man.
it's not just a kiss.
that's the thing about lorraine, it's never just a kiss.
she. I swear, she actually makes my tongue change color.
let see.
it's normal color.
not the tip.
it's bluish.
it's the normal color.
it's a bit puffy, though.
is it swollen? It's a bit puffy.
Oh, sweet.
it's the fat bigot and his friend Mr. Puffy tongue.
I don't believe we've officially met.
$1 million, nothing structured.
as I understand it, your client was offered her job back within an hour.
Oh, gee. You're right. You got me there.
$1 million.
I'm Alan Shore.
$1 million.
how about instead, I bite you on the inner thigh? Does that work for you?
if only I'd really said that, but you, of course, misheard me.
just as your client misheard Denny.
is that your defense?
he didn't really fire her for being fat?
miss. I'm sure you have a name, but I'm not much interested.
I've taken an immediate dislike to you. I'm sure you get that a lot.
where I was once prepared to be generous, now I'm not.
you've made the strategic mistake of pissing me off.
you scare me.
see me shudder?
take your clothes off. I'll make you shudder.
that I did say.
your hostility is just a barely concealed form of foreplay.
I knew it. You're a horny, insatiable little slut.
I could smell it the second you walked in.
well, I'm happy to oblige.
let's you and I make like rabbits.
I realize this is unbelievably late notice.
when does your trial start?
today, actually.
look, I-I just had a knockdown blowout with my lawyer.
now he's out, and I-I'm desperate.
let's back up. Uh, what is yo trial about?
I'm being charged with murder.
mm, something simple then.
look, I'm a police officer.
well, I was. They fired me.
I shot an unarmed man, mistaking him for a suspt.
I thought he had a gun.
turned out to be a soda can the light caught funny.
anyway, it was a mistake.
but the D. A.'s saying otherwise.
the thing is, they took an M.R.I. Of my brain.
Why?
the man I shot was african-american, and, uh, the district attorney's saying the shooting's racially motivated.
look, I had a couple of incidents at work where I had to go get, you know, sensitivity training and so forth, but I'm not a racist.
wait.
so they took a scan of your brain to see if the shooting was racially motivated?
Yeah, they called it a functional M.R.I.
I've read that they can evidently detect a predisposition toward racial bias.
and did it, with you?
Yes.
they plan to use it as evidence to convict me of second-degree murder.
well, you were worse than me.
I just.
I think she was prepared to he sex, though. I could've been right on the money there.
so now what happens?
well, she's noticed your deposition. After that, I'll bring our motion to dismiss.
I've been thinking a lot abt what you said, Denny.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
What'd I say?
you said that maybe Lorraine is the one for me.
maybe that's why I can't shake the neck or the kiss.
maybe I just can't shake her.
maybe Lorraine's it.
I said that?
what's the big deal, Jerry?
have you ever kissed a girl? -Yes.
as you or clevant?
I kissed claire as me.
I don't believe you. -I did.
hello.
hello. -Hello.
Clarence, I'm ashameto admit I've been googling myself again.
it happens when Shirley's out of town.
and I've been on youtube again.
do you know what's playing now?
that was not. oh, a minister?
a preacher?
are you a man dressed as a woman.
he stole my parking place.
I was getting ready to back in, then he whooshed in with his sports car, then he called me names and.
I just lost it.
you weirdo. you pervert.
Oh, you know what else you can do?
you can kiss my ass. That's what you can do.
take a look at this here.
Oh! Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
kiss it! His image!
take a good kiss of that, Mr. Minister!
okay, several issues.
first, you're terrorizing clergy.
that's something we frown on.
second, you likened your buttocks to god's image.
very politically incorrect even in a blue state.
and you managed to do so on the world wide web as an employee of Crane, Poole & Schmidt, which means that your exposed ass only speaks to the almighty's image, but ours.
take that right there.
take a look at this here. Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
I wasn't watching anything.
I expected better from you.
me?
your conduct leaves a little to be desired.
hello.
Leigh, hello. Leigh, hello.
I was just in the neighborod.
I thought, what the hey?
what a surprise. Hey. Hello.
this is clarence. You remember leigh.
hello.
hello.
all set for tonight?
tonight.
well, uh, something's come up, actually.
it looks like I have to work late tonight.
Oh, okay.
tomorrow night? -Yes.
well, this case could be consuming, this one that just came up.
maybe we should postpone till the weend.
Oh, okay.
good-bye.
good-bye.
what came up? Nothing's come up.
did I ask you?
you're just afraid you'll have to kiss her.
don't be such a buttinskyhead.
you hurt her feelings.
I said I didn't ask you, you.
poop!
all rise.
this court is now in session.
the honorable judge Gloria Weldon presiding.
be seated.
good morning, your honor.
Whitney rome along with katie lloyd of Crane, Poole & Schmidt for the defense.
your motion is denied.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
you seek to suppress the M. R.I. Scan.
Mr. Bass' previous counsel already brought such a motion to suppress.
the issue was ruled on.
your honor, come on.
a brain scan to read his thoughts?
assuming these things are even accurate.
no.
it reads chemical responses, not thoughts.
and we already make suspects give blood, D.N. A.Handwriting analysis.
those are objective tests.
so is the brain scan.
I'm allowing it. What else?
we also have a motion for a continuance in denied.
wait, we just got this.
too late. Denied. We start today.
your honor.
maybe in the interest of justice, we should put our conflicts on the table.
Meaning?
meaning there may be some bad blood between you and my firm, and it.
Mr. Palmer, I once had a relationship with a lawyer at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
do you object? -Not at all.
well, my client objects.
tell your client the affair wasn't very memorable.
and if I had to rese myself from every case where I'd slept with one of the lawyers, or both, I'd have to take up golf.
I'll give you one hour to get yourself ready, then I'm bringing in the jury.
okay.
listen to me, Denny, answer only what you're asked, do not throw in little, uh, comments or asides, and above all, do not, do not, do not offer your opinions.
will you relax, man? It's me you're talking to.
dear god.
I was just leaving.
I was just, uh, thinking about you earlier.
Really? Tell me.
well.
you know how, uh, both of us seem to be so relationship averse?
I was thinking.
maybe you are, uh, right for a longer-term thing..
funny.
who told you?
told me?
that I'm a relationship.
I was planning to tell you.
you're in a relationship.
Yeah, a really wonderful man.
I think you'd like him.
Oh, I'm s.
not sure.
anyway, I-I-I thought you'd be relieved.
we've decided to make it exclusive.
so you won't have to worry about me stalking you anymore.
terrific.
we had just came out the deli.
and B. J. Went back in because he forgot his soda on the counter.
I kept walking to the car.
B. J. Is your brother.
Yes.
then as I got to the car, this cop car comes screeching up, and two cops jump out, screaming.
and they had their guns pointed at B. J.
then what?
they just shot him.
he shot him.
he just kept shooting and shooting.
it was like he unloaded the whole gun.
I'm very sorry for your loss, Terrence.
when the police arrived and leapt from the car, what did you do, if I may ask?
I just hit the ground.
and did you actually see your brother get shot, or did you first hear the shots and then look up?
both.
I first heard the shots, and then I looked up and saw him getting shot.
thank you.
once again, tightly constructed answers.
there's no room for opinions, especially yours.
what's wrong?
nothing's wrong.
you're being surly. I can hear it.
I am not surly. -Yes, you are.
whatever it is, I. -nothing's wrong!
that hurt my feelings.
she's involved.
who?
Lorraine. She has a boyfriend.
I never liked her.
did she say who?
no, and I don't care.
hello. Welcome.
I'm very unsettled.
if you don't want to date me anymore, please just be honest with me.
I'm 44 years old, I've heard every excuse there is.
the last one said he got summoned for astronaut duty and had to rush off for the moon.
I'm sick of dishonest, disingenuous men.
and people wonder how I could end up with a utility box.
you dishonest man!
Hey, lady, I tried to let you down nicely, and you punish me for it.
what, I should have opted for cruelty?
what do yowant from me?
they even fight weird.
come on, Denny. Let's go.
we were responding to a call that a man matching the description of the suspect was seen going into the deli.
when we arrived, we saw Mr. Owens and his brother emerging.
we identified ourselves as police officers, drew our weapons and asked them to get on the ground.
then what?
well, I looked at Terrence, the younger brother, over by the car.
then I heard the shots.
I looked back to see my partner firing at B. J.
and yet, you didn't shoot. -No.
in fact, you said to the, uh, field investigation division that you thought the shoot was reckless.
I thought it was a quick shoot.
I never said it was racially motivated.
officer Payne, how long have you and the defendant been partners?
three years.
he's your friend. -Yes.
ever have reason to think that he's a racist?
no.
Really? You never complained about him?
when we were first deployed together, I didn't know him.
he made a few comments that upset me.
like he "only believed in busing for away games"?
his sense of humor is sometimes misplaced.
but he's not a racist.
the brother who was mistaken for the suspect.
did he in fact look like that suspect?
we only had a general description, but yes, he did match it.
and that suspect was reported as being armed and dangerous.
Yes.
thank you.
Ffirst of all, I apologize for embarrassing the law firm.
it's not like me to lose my temper like that, and.
I am very sorry.
uh, second, uh.
I sued them.
sued who? -Youtube.
it was wrong for them to humiliate me like that.
I'll represent myself but.
you don't really have a case.
what they did was wrong.
I can't let it go.
Clarence, certainly you've heard the saying, any man who represents himself has a drag queen for a client.
wait, no. That's not the saying.
let me represent you.
I agree, what they did was wrong. I'll help you.
you don't have to do that.
I want to, and, son, I'm very good.
all rise.
this court is now in session. The honorable judge Brown presiding.
be seated.
all right.
before we begin, some of you may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing protective heaear.
I sustained a small wound while gardening.
my doctor advised that I take conservative precautions until the stitches are removed.
please pay it no attention.
your honor, I think we can make this quick.
Mr. Bell is alleging defamation of character.
the footage depicts what actually happened, and truth is a complete defense to defamation.
this is silly.
we're also suing under right to publicity.
the plaintiff is not a celebrity. We get no value trading his name.
you get value trading on footage depicting him.
I direct you to Massachusetts law, chapter 214, section 3A.
I'm sorry.
I'm finding it very difficult to get past the helmet.
I am a superior court jurist, and I expect to be treated with the respect that goes with this robe.
I do not sit up here for your amusement.
even so.
judge, the video was aired without a context, so it does not represent the truth.
I'd like to hear exactly how he's been defamed.
you can read how in the complaint.
it is a fair request.
Mr. Bell, the footage fairly and accurately depicts what happened, doesn't it?
the helmet threw me.
and you just thought you had the right to fire her 'cause she was fat?
and still is.
I thought I had the right to fire people who jeopardize my health.
how does her weight jeopardize your health?
according to studies at Harvard. You've heard of harvard?
obesity can spread like a contagious disease.
that's not my opinion. That's Harvard's.
but I wasn't too fat for you to hit on?
Oh, no. Cause I like chubby sex. But I never asked you to dinner.
did you hear that?
I only heard ca-ching, ca-ching.
I have nothing against the chinese. -Denny.
so are you firing all thheavy people Crane, Poole & Schmidt?
well, I had to start someplace. I started with her.
ca-ching.
and let's just suppose, say, my client did agree to have sex with you.
too late. I've moved on.
would you have fired her had she not rejected you?
I fired her because according to the harvard studies, the social influence of fat people can be just as damaging as genetics.
I tried to explain that to your client, but her ears were too stuffed with twinkies.
on their way in or out, I couldn't be sure.
ca-ching.
what?
it's called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
what does it do?
you can tell what someone is thinking?
we can tell how someone is feeling, and we can specifically identify responses associated with sociopathic tendencies.
here, we determined the defendant was racist.
you can really measure this with accuracy?
extreme accuracy.
in this case, we showed Mr. Bass pictures of people from various races, and then we measured the response in the part of his brain that controls fear.
it's called the amygdala.
and what did it reveal?
officer bass perceives blacmen as threatening.
possible he would be more trigger-happy with a black man?
Absolutely.
how long have these tests been used to read people's minds?
they read responses, not minds, but the answer is a long time.
and here, they told you jeffrey bass fears black men more than white.
Unquestionably.
are you familiar with shooter bias tests, professor?
they're video games with white characters and black characters, and the characters reach for either guns or cell phones, and you're supposed to only shoot the ones with guns.
and do these tests reveal that white officers more readily fire on blacks than black police officers?
no.
shooter bias tests have generally concluded that, in this country, everyone shoots black people faster.
focus on the images. This should only take about a minute.
okay.
why are we doing this?
if our scan gets different results, then we can impeach the validity of theirs.
and he's seeing what we're seeing? -Yes.
I don't ink our scan is getting different results.
you can kiss my ass.
that's what you can do. Well, you're a weirdo.
take a look at this here. Oh, his image, Mr. Minister.
kiss that right there! His image!
take a good kiss of that, Mr. Minister!
outrageous.
Mr. Bell, the footage fairly and accurately depicts what happened, doesn't it?
Yes, but it doesn't tell the whole story.
have you gone out in public dressed as a woman before? -Yes.
in fact, you once joined an all-girls gym, isn't that correct? -Yes.
you recently signed up for a singing contest in drag. You've gone to work in drag.
but that moment, without a context, makes me look like.
you're a lawyer.
I am.
are you familiar with section 230 of the communications decency act? -Yes, but.
which expressly protects online services from defamation liability arising from material posted on their sites by individuals?
your honor, this was an extremely embarrassing event, aired worldwide on a web site, absent the context that occasioned it.
the footage depicts what happened.
so where's the damage?
your honor, think of it.
we've all had a meltdown or two mortifying episode of some sort.
typically we're allowed to live those moments down.
but now thanks to the internet, we can't.
suppose I taped you as justice bubblehead.
put that thing down.
how would you like to be defined. -Put it down this instant!
my point is, life's little embarrassing moments are now having far-reaching and more devastating consequences.
if the day has come that we are going to be publicly and globally shamed by our foolish missteps, then the laws of defamation should keep pace.
certainly when these tort laws were drafted, the legislators never contemplated.
I repeated my command to freeze.
this time he did, but then he started to raise his hand, and in it was a metal object.
I thought it was a gun, and I just reacted.
you know now he was probably raising his hands in surrender.
Yes.
but at the time.
I ought it was a gun.
do you work in a pretty tough neighborhood, Mr. Bass?
Yes, it's a gang neighborhood.
and have you ever been shot at before?
three times.
have you ever shot anybody, besides B. J.Owens?
twice hmm.
what color were they?
I patrol a predominately black area.
so the two you previously shot were black?
Yes.
and according to internal affairs' reports, one of the suspects was also unarmed.
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.
it was an innocent mistake.
another mistake? Well, have you ever mistakenly shot a white person?
objection. -Sustaine defence.
according to the F. M.R. I.You feel more threatened by black people.
why do you think that is?
it could be because statistically, blacks commit more violent crimes.
it could be because I been shot at three times by black suspects.
or maybe you just dislike black people.
no, I do not.
I'm not a racist.
but you shot him eight times.
Mrs. Owens. -You just shot him till he was dead.
you kept shooting and shooting and shooting! -Mrs. Owens, I will have you.
you murdered my baby! -mom, calm down.
you murderer! -Mrs. Owens, any more such outbursts, and you will be removed from this courtroom.
just let me do all the talking, Denny, every word.
do not even move your lips without checking with me first.
all rise.
you can't be serious.
Judas priest, she's the size of an elephant.
be seated.
okay, I'll hear from the petitioner.
no, before we get to that, your honor, uh, Alan Shore representing Denny Crane.
I-I have a-a motion.
let's hear it.
uh, your honor, uh, perhaps you are not the right jurist to be objective on this one.
what do you mean?
his tongue is tied for two reasons, judge.
first, it's puffy.
and second, it's a challenge for him to spin this.
Denny crane fired nancy wilding because she was fat.
it is bigotry in its purest, most evil form.
fat people in this country are subject to prejudice, emotional abuse and ridicule.
it starts on the playground, and it never stops.
this woman didn't get asked to her high school prom.
waiters and waitresses ignore her.
she's been denied housing, insurance.
airlines want to charge her double.
but nancy wilding didn't sit in a corner and feel sorry for herself.
she said,"hey, I'm gonna use my brain.
I'm gonna study.
I'm gonna go to law school."
and she did.
and she graduated near the top of her class, she passed the bar, she performed ably and successfully as a wyer, and where did it all get her?
fired for being fat.
somebody somewhere has finally got to say enough.
Nancy wilding is hoping that person is you.
I'll take it under advisement.
uh, wait, wait. You didn't hear from me.
I'll take it under advisement. I'll hear you before I read my ruling.
judge, I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.
whatever.
this is not going well, Alan. -You think?
she won't even hear our side.
hopefully she will before.
excuse me, Denny.
what are you doing?
I'm standing with my head up against a wall.
Yes.
Why?
I had a little row with Leigh.
I saw that.
much of the office did.
I think I was mean to her.
was I mean to her?
well, from my vantage point, you were very mean.
she was feeling hurt, extremely vulnerable.
she lashed out in pain, at which point you whipped out the wooden cigarette and thrashed her with it.
I just felt everyone staring at us and.
have you called her to apologize?
tried, but.
she's dating my clock radio, just to get back at me.
uh, I beg your pardon.
she has a crush on my clock radio.
I let her borrow it after the utility box was killed, and when I called to apologize, the two of them were headed out to a movie.
I'm not quite sure how to respond to that, other than to say, you've had two wonderful dates with this woman.
uh, you're at the precipice of kissing.
and it just seems wrong for her now to be dating your clock radio.
policemen do tough work, dangerous work in cities across this country that seem to only grow more and more dangerous.
that is a reality.
but here is another reality.
african-americans have been targeted disproportionately in both arrests and excessive force.
blacks comprise 13% of our population, yet 44% of our prison population.
and how many times do you have to turn on the news and see that yet another innocent, unarmed black man has been shot dead by the police before we say enough?
eight times, he shot him.
even his partner, who is also his friend, called the shooting "reckless."
was it an honest mistake?
Yeah, sure, like the last time he mistakenly shot an unarmed black man.
how many mistakes.
can we allow him?
do we keep tolerating these executions or not?
the victim matched the description of the armed suspect.
he raised his hand with something metallic in it.
it looked like a gun. My client reacted.
the district attorney did not offer even one witness to dispute that.
instead, he gave you a brain scan.
the police can now take our blood, our hair, our D.N.A.
they can make us give handwriting samples, voice patterns.
they can cck our computers to see what interests us, our gpses to see where we've been.
and today, they're introducing scans to show our feelings.
where does it stop?
and let's assume these M.R.I. S really can show that my client feared black people more than whites.
so what?
the law has to distinguish between thought and deed.
the supreme court is doing away with warrants.
our administration eavesdrops on all of us.
are we really going to allow this government to unleash the thought police?
are we that scared?
we must be.
because today, the prosecution is trying to convict a man of murder with nothing more than an M. R.I.
God help us.
it can't even keep proper time.
you even have a dishonest clock.
Hey, I'd really love to chat, but I'm running late for the moon.
I'm sorry, Leigh.
I didn't mean what I said before.
I'd love to keep seeing you.
just not in this lifetime.
I'm too odd, Jerry. I get it.
you're not too odd.
it's just, our two dates went so well,
I was afraid of the third date.
Why?
because I was worried I'd be expected.
to kiss you.
which I'd like to do, but it's all so terrifying, your being a real person and all.
there.
can we move on?
it went by so fast.
Jerry, I'm just as scared.
forget about kissing.
have y thought about how hard it will be for the two of us to hug?
all right.
all right.
first off, I will have no comment about my modified headgear.
truth is always a complete defense against defamation.
well, that's the law.
but I am mindful that 30-second video blogs. without the proper context.
do not always capture the truth.
I'm also mindful that we live in a video world now, where every tom, dick and harry with a cell phone is a de facto cameraman and via the internet, a-a distributor.
maybe the current tort laws do need adjusting.
but right now, as they are written, they offer no remedy to those who may be humiliated by this.
the case is therefore dismissed.
we are adjourned.
I'm okay.
sorry, Clarence. We tried.
Yes, thank you.
I think the best advice for all of us to remember is if you're out in public, assume the cameras are watching.
okay, then, I'm told we have a unanimous verdict.
the defense will please rise.
madam foreperson, what say you?
in the matter "of the commonwealth vs. Jeffrey Bass "on the charge of murder in the second degree, we find the defendant Jeffrey Bass not guilty.
no.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service. You're dismissed.
we're adjourned.
thank you.
thank you so much.
get a job without a gun, Mr. Bass.
all right, I've made my ruling.
what? No.
you said you'd hear from me.
Yeah, I could predict what you'd say.
well, I'd like to say it just the same, your honor.
whatever.
your honor, uh, what Denny Crane did and said here was offensive.
it was cruel.
I'd go so far as to say indecent.
but every plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages, and this woman was offered her job back within an hour.
that couldn't make her whole from the pain.
may I finish?
I hereby rule that. -No!
your honor, I agree with many of the things ms. Path said.
fat people are discriminated against, unfairly and pervasively.
it is unforgivable to judge somebody on physical appearance alone, especially in the workplace.
but what my client did here was not altogether wrong.
in fact, more employers should draw a harder line on obesity.
Oh, really?
Yes, because it doesn't just go to looks.
this goes to a serious health issue. -A serious health issue.
and frankly, it's inexcusable.
65% of american adults are obese.
it's one of the leading causes of death in this country.
the health care costs run about $117 billion a year.
and we just keep eating and eating and eating.
look at me. Look at.
the fast food companies keep proliferating.
portion sizes keep getting bigger and bigger.
candy bars and soft drinks.
and we keep getting fatter and fatter and fatter as if it's not killing us, and it is.
and given this new study at harvard, maybe what Denny did, uh, wasn't altogether out of line.
simply having fat friends can triple your risk of becing obese.
if this is true, judge, if obesity is contagious through social networking, then maybe all employers have a duty to their employees to weed out the heifers.
and maybe it's about time, uh, to put aside our inflated sense of political correctness and practice a little tough love with our friends and family.
say to a loved one,"you're fat."
tell a friend,"you look like a hippo on the verge of a heart attack."
shock them into going on diets, not just to save themselves, but possibly their friends and coworkers.
that's all Denny Crane was trying to say.
and perhaps he should be applauded for it.
you done?
Yes, your honor, it appears I'm quite done.
case dismissed. adjourned.
we won?
we won.
I still can't believe she ruled in our favor.
because you judged her by her appearance, that's why.
so did you.
maybe a little.
you know, Denny, since I've been your friend, I've gotten heavier.
you're blaming me?
well, that study.
since I've met you, I've gotten bigger.
you're the feed bag.
me?
you're the influence.
Oh, come on.
I don't believe that study anyway.
you don't?
think about it.
of course fat people have fat friends.
thin people don't want to hang around with them. They're too fat.
what?
you doing okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
of course you do.
here's my philosophy on women, Alan.
Oh, god.
it's better to want something you don't have than have something you don't want.
now when it comes to you and Lorraine.
I can't have her.
exactly.
please don't reduce sleepover tonight?
no popcorn.
Oh, come on.
see? Bad influence.
well, how can you watch a movie without popcorn?
did you not listen to my closing, denny?
I never listen.
was it good? -It was good.
so stop sulking. -I'm not sulking.
well. don't even come over if you're gonna be like that.
maybe I won't then.
fine. -Fine.
9: 00?
no red vines.
I don't think it's working out.
what isn't working out? - Us.
andrea Michele, the client.
am I getting my ass whipped?
not that I don't like that.
you need to tone it down.
now I'm horny.
united states coast guard auxiliary
a volunteer component of the coast guard. - Let's go.
I get seasick, but whateve oh, we're gonna be in the military.
already my penis feels bigger.
a court-appointed, indigent client--check forgery.
I should be able to manage that.
Yes, manage it quickly, please, so we can put you on a case that might actually make this firm some money.
hello.
dear Maureen, being with you is being.
thinking about the last time we madlove,
I feel both a total sense of peace and a voracious hunger.
when I am on you, I am. Meet me.
that's sweet, but I'm not Maureen.
I'm Maureen.
guess who wrote this.
the suspense is simply more than I can bear.
my pastor.
we had an affair.
and this is one of the letters he wrote while we were together.
I loved him.
he dumped me.
I want to sue him.
Clarence. - Yes.
this is Maureen.
she loves her pastor.
Clarence will help you. Pay no attention to his shifty eyes.
hello.
who are you? - Who are you?
busy.
Andrea.
my friends call me the beav.
uh, oh, yes. I remember you.
you're the one that sued over the nuclear power plant.
well, what is it today, beav?
Congratulations.
who's the lucky troop ship?
funny. Got a first name?
extremely.
extremely busy.
hold on, I bring business.
this ring is a zirconium.
it's supposed to be my mother.
you're very tall, by the way.
I sent her ashes to a company that takes out the carbon, heats it up, smashes it down and turns it into a memorial diamond.
but this, as I said, is not a diamond.
it's a cubic zirconium.
I've been defrauded.
I'm looking for a tall, distinguished yet privately debauched attorney to satisfy the beav, and you're it.
Leo.
Aries.
now we've got that out of the way.
no, my name is Leo.
Oh, I beg your pardo um...
I see yore charged with felony forgery, and there appears to be ample evidence.
well, that's only because I did it.
Oh, I see. Do you-- do you have a reason?
I do. I'm dying.
you don't look it.
you got me.
I'm not, and therein lies the problem.
you seem confused.
I'd be glad to explain over dinner.
how about you do so now?
okay.
are you familiar with viatical settlements?
a termally ill person signs over his life insurance policy for up-front cash...
and when that person dies, the company collects the policy's full death benefit.
Yes. Four years ago, I was diagnosed with A. I.D. S.
bad blood transfusion.
he adds to assure me he's straight.
anyway, I-I didn't respond to any of the medications, none.
my "T" cells plummeted, my viral load soared.
I couldn't work. I had no savings.
I needed money to live on.
well, to die on.
so you sold your life insurance policy?
Yeah, they gave $40, 000 and agreed to cover my health and life insurance benefits for the rest of my life, which seemed to be a few months away.
but then these new treatments came out
they call them rescue drugsfor A. I.D. S. Patients who don't respond to normal medications
and turned things around.
great for me. I get to live.
not so great for the viatical company which promised to pay for my health insurance for the rest of my life.
and now they want out of the deal?
and I still need the deal.
basically, if I don't get the right treatment, I die.
so I took one of their checks, made counterfeits and started paying the premiums that way.
evidently that's a crime?
well, I've been assigned by the court to your case, so...
I'm in luck.
I told him to get rid of it, but he didn't.
what do you expect me to do?
backstop him.
help make it go away.
she's suing her pastor for dumping her?
that's ridiculous.
Ah, of course it is.
this is the firm where ridiculous...
excuse me.
hello.
need something?
what are you doing?
coast guard training.
we need to know C. P.R.
no tongue.
I've saved you some time.
I've called the president of the company that makes these rings, and he's agreed to come here and meet with you.
you should be on your knees thanking me.
win us the case, and I'll get down on mine.
well, had she been drinking or
no, no. It was a school day.
she had been up the prior night studying for a test.
earlier that week, she had pulled an all-nighter to finish a paper.
they think she fell asleep at the wheel.
how can I be of help, Mrs. Joseph?
I believe that my daughter was hugely sleep deprived as a result of both stress and workload.
I partly blame myself for even letting her drive because I knew how tired she was, but...
she wouldn't be dead if it weren't for the...
I want to sue her high school.
you can't use a snorkel, man.
why not?
well, they won't let you.
we're supposed to be able to save people.
you look like you need to be rescued.
Denny, I'm afraid of the water.
don't say that to the coast guard!
they won't let you in, man.
what's his problem now?
I have no idea.
they'll drop the charges, just like that?
no, not just like that.
it took a phenomenal bit of lawyering on my part.
and it's conditioned on the viatical company agreeing not to press charges.
I have a settlement conference scheduled for tomorrow at 10: 00.
well, what's your cause of action?
emotional distress.
for a break up?
well, this was her ptor.
there may be a special duty of care, like with a therapist.
I don't know, Clarence.
well, I might as well tr what's to lose?
honestly?
your career.
I don't mean to be harsh, but if you want to advance here, taking cases that waste the firm's time and resources isn't the best way to accomplish that.
Carl's not happy you ran with this.
he'll be happy if we get something.
you okay?
so talk to me. What's the matter?
it's not a new discussion.
the cases we...
I've got clarence and lorraine handling a woman who's suing because her pastor dumped her.
Katie is taking care of a court-appointed matter.
Denny and Alan are very busy trying to join the coast guard.
your friend andrea wants me to sue some crematorium for turning her mother into a cubic zirconium.
it seems like every case we do.
Carl. Sorry.
I just took a client.
her daughter was killed in a car wreck, and she wants to sue her high school for wrongful death, claiming they made her kid sleep deprived.
I just couldn't say no to the woman.
sorry.
that's who we are, Carl.
would you like to lighten the mood by talking about us?
sure.
have you really been that unhappy?
I think...
wwhen people become parents, their personal lives get pushed to the back burner, where they sit dormant for years.
husbands and wives become ancillary to each other, causing many a marriage to fail.
mine did, as did the dozen or so of yours.
funny.
you and i are very compatible, Shirley.
we like the same movies, we go to museums together.
we just make splendid company when we're not off independently doing our own things.
and we make excuses for the lack of...
let's call it heat.
we're not that old, Shirley.
and sexually, yoare still a beautiful, passionate woman.
I'm still capable of passion, without medication even.
I mean, these are the years when our personal lives should be very much on the front burner again.
and with you and I, together...
they're not.
which brings me back to you deserve more, and so do I.
does that make sense?
a little too much, actually.
Shirley, I've represented you.
I now need you to represent me.
Why?
it's possible I might be disqualified from the coast guard cause I'm afraid of water.
I want to sue under the americans with disabilities act.
I think not.
an egregious wrong by your client has resulted in a great spiritual loss to Miss Janely.
they banged, he bailed, she bruised.
we're prepared to go forward with this.
but we're willing to entertain a settlement offer.
would we be here if he'd kept on slapping her sheets?
it wasn't cheap and ugly.
it was a profound love.
tell her.
I was...
intoxicate I was powerless.
did you love me?
no.
but...
it was lust.
what we were doing s a sin and had to stop.
and I couldn't leave my wife and marry you just for the lust.
that would just be sinning against you even more.
W-w-well, what do I do now?
if I don't have you, what do I do?
she was taking four A. P.Courses.
she was involved in at least 15 activities.
this was by her choice.
well, it was and it wasn't.
she saw everybody else doing it, and she didn't want to lag behind.
I-it--it just seems there's this frenzy, be it S. A.T. Scores or getting into the best college, and the kids, even the ones who get a's like Samantha, feel they can ways do more.
and you blame the school?
well, I realize that some of it comes from the parents.
we all want our kids to succeed, but...
but most of the pressure comes from their peers.
and certainly the schools can see the stress.
it's widespread.
do the parents see the stress?
Yes, and I did.
but how do you get your kid to decompress when she feels that if she doesn't take four A. P.Courses, if she doesn't succeed in sports, if she isn't involved in school government, then she can forget about going to a selective college?
after all of her activities, she would come home from school at 9: 00 or 10: 00, only then to start her homework.
now these schools need to set limits, and they don't.
did you?
I tried, but I- - ever lean on how to do better?
sometimes.
and I regret it.
if I had her back, I would say, "honey, let's go to the beach or take a hayride or build a snowman or..."
my god, these kids don't even go on spring break these days.
they use the time to visit colleges or take S. A.T. Courses.
I'm sorry, judge.
I know that you don't want tears, but--but we put too much on these kids.
they don't sleep.
and my baby's dead because of it.
good morning.
my name's Katie Lloyd.
I represent Leonardo Morris.
Yes, we've actually met before.
how are you, Leo?
alive.
I can be such a killjoy.
and I'm Bob Winthrop, the C. E.O. Of living securities.
Katie lloyd. - Pleasure.
first, let me say, Mr. Morris, we are happy for your recovery.
I've met with the district attorney.
I suspect she'd agree not to prosecute on the check forging if you agree not to press charges.
done.
Really? - Of course.
and I assume you'll agree not to pursue us civilly.
I can't do that.
you entered into a contract to pay for my health insurance.
you breached it.
that contract presumes a meeting of the minds.
clearly there wasn't here.
how do you figure? - Leo.
she asks.
well, uh, I don't want to sound like ghoul, but that contract presumes you'd be dead within six months.
as it turns out, you could live forever.
that was you not wanting to sound like a ghoul?
look, everybody knows what viatical companies do.
we buy life insurance policies from dying people.
he presented himself as a dying man.
he didn't die.
what did you do with my mother?
well, as I was explaining to mr. Sack, uh, despite our best efforts to provide you with a carbon, cremain-based gem
Yeah, where is she?
we encountered a glitch.
if you'll refer to the contract, "in the event of a material processing complication, life-jewel guaranteesa-a substitute of equal or greater value."
cubic zionium is of greater value than ashes.
what, are you kidding me?
I'll gladly provide you a full refund.
I want you to refund me my mother, her ashes. - Plus...
$25, 00
well, we'll see you in court.
wait. Now let's just hold on a second. - Of course we're not going to accepthat insulting offer.
Andrea, look- - here's a guarantee, Mr. Parkes
call your lawyer. We will see you in court.
go on. Go.
what?
you're upset with me.
I'm upset with myself for being manipulated.
look, uh, may I call you "extremely," though it's a funny first name?
call me Carl, beav.
you know, you need to loosen up a little.
now how often does it happen that an oversexed woman barges in with a cubic zirconium, complaining that it's not her mother?
W-what do you mean, I have no case?
well, Maureen, courts don't intervene in failed romances.
to give another person one's love, that's everything, isn't it?
it is, but when one enters into a love affair, he or she assumes the risk of a broken heart.
can't you do anything?
because of what he did, I no longer even believe in god.
this just isn't fair.
you no longer believe in god?
no. How could I?
look, kids are raised with the mind-set now...
forget about love of learning, it's get into the trophy college.
all I ever hear about is how our kids don't learn, how r education system is failing.
it is.
getting the grade is not the same as learning.
in fact, sometimes they're mutually exclusive.
the kids have mastered test taking.
it's memorization.
they forget it as soon as the exam's over.
moreover, the competition has created a culture of cheating.
it's all about getting the advantage.
and it's every bit as bad as mrs. Joseph suggests.
what do we do about it?
well, in my thinking, it does start with the parents.
they see dad-- now mom and dad-- competing in the workplace, maximizing career opportunities, exploiting any edge they can get.
we live in a society that likes to keep score.
it happens in life.
it's going on in the home, and we can't stop it from happening in the schools.
how about not offering the A. P.Courses?
we do that, and the kids leave in droves and find someplace that does offer them.
stress-management classes?
we've got them.
the kids don't have time to schedule them in.
limiting the amount of extracurricular activities?
well, it sounds good.
problem is, when it comes time apply to college, our kids compete with kids from other schools.
what you're suggesting is we take away their ability to compete fairly.
how do we do that? We put a big sign saying, "if you want to go to Harvard, don't enroll here"?
Yes. It doesn't have to be Harvard.
tell that to the parents.
well, somebody's got to take the lead here.
how?
should we say, "don't aim for the top"?
how about let's redefine what the top is?
but it's the kids who define it.
does getting into a select college mean they have a better chance of achieving success or happiness?
no. - Well...
maybe you should start by telling them that.
even assuming you really are willing to go to jail on the fgery
if I can't afford my medications, my lifespan gets pretty short.
prison doesn't really scare me.
you'd be dead long before this could ever get to trial, so why should we be scared of a lawsuit?
his estate can sue for wrongful death.
Oh, come on.
look, we make it possible for terminal people to enjoy some quality of life.
by betting on their death.
you don't know my business, counsel.
I will make it a point, sir, for the jury to know your business.
they will learn that your industry is rife with corruption, that it's largely unregulated by the S. E.C.
that a grand jury indeed found that up to 50% of viatical agreements may indeed have be procured by fraud.
look, you don't have-- - and while you entice investors by convincing them they're making a humanitarian investment that will turn a huge profit, you currently have no fewer than 11 lawsuits filed against you by these investors, who've yet to see any of the giant returns you guaranteed.
my investors have done just fine, thank you.
in the 80s perhaps, when A. I.D. S.Victims paid off by dying quickly.
you bought my client's policy when he was circling the drain.
you made what you thoughtwas a sure bet, and now that it's turned out otherwise, you renege.
you've breached a contract, mr. Winthrop, and in so doing, have me it impossible for my client to afford his medication.
you very well may hasten his death, but hey,
I'm sure the jury will find you quite sympathetic.
okay, that was good.
thank you.
so where do we go from here?
well, hopefully they'll make us an offer.
I mean you and me.
you got me all excited about living another 40 years or so.
did I?
if only I'd known getting arrested could have such an upside.
all the crimes I could have committed.
Leo, I-I represent you, so it would be extremely unethical to-- for me toto kiss you.
so now you're in trouble.
big trouble.
I bett go.
uh, you'll call?
what's wrong with you calling?
no, I meant if we get an offer.
I'll definitely be calling.
night, Leo.
night.
thank you for coming back.
Reverend Joyner, I just want to extend my apologies.
it was wrong for my client to sue you.
I must confess I hadn't properly reviewed the facts, but now that I have, we'll be withdrawing our claim forthwith.
what?
is this a trick?
no, it's not a trick, Ms. Path I quite properly realized it shouldn't be kurt who maureen sues, but rather the church.
what? Why?
well, your relationship began with you as her pastor.
you were acting as an agent of the church.
nice try.
you can't sue a church for a broken heart, twiggy.
the claim would be loss of faith.
the reverend has caused my client to lose her faith in god.
that's ridiculous.
is it now?
I suspect not to Kurt.
I had opportunity to read several of his sermons, many of which eloquently convey how love and faith are inextricably, indelibly woven together.
whoever does not love does not know god because god is love.
that's beautiful.
Yes, we quite rightly will be pursuing the church now.
they're a much deeper pocket, by the way.
Oh, and thank you for categorizing your feelings as lust.
it will help with liability, though I'm not se your congregation will be pleased to learn their pastor is a sinner.
look, maybe we can just settle this.
no, we can't.
I can't have the church dragged into this.
she's extorting you, Kurt.
she's just trying to scare you so youl quit fighting.
is god a quitter?
no.
I need more conviction, Kurt.
is god a quitter?
no.
what would Jesus do, Kurt?
he'd fight back.
Jesus wasn't a baby, was he, Kurt?
no.
Jesus would get her.
that's what he'd do.
he'd get her.
we're not settling.
what kind of preposterous nonsense is this?
that's the kind of nonsense we specialize in, judge.
but as preposterous as it is, these companies actually exist.
they convert the remains of people into diamonds.
this firm, however, lost the ashes of my clients mother, and instead proffered a cubic zirconium.
it isn't right.
I don't really care.
why should a court take up its valuable time with something so...
because it matters, judge.
cases likehis really do matter.
are you going to make me tell you why?
Yes.
okay.
I'm a great believer in capitalism.
it fuels our competitive edge, it's the lifeblood of our economy.
but it also can bring out some of our most disgusting tendencies.
and nowhere are we more exploitative, more disgusting, more soulless than we are in the death business.
get them when they're grieving.
whether it's the solid mahogany coffin, the choicest plot, the marble tombstone
if you truly loved a lost one, you should pay through the nose to show it.
and they come up with ingenious, creative new ways profit off grief, like these diamond rings.
it's so easy to bilk people in their weakest emotional states.
they'll pay a higher price, they'll sign a misleading contract, they won't scrutinize the fine print.
my god, who first came up with, "let burn the bodies and sell urns"?
the truth is, we are so desperate to hold on to our loved ones, we'll do anything.
my client sought to hold on to her mother with a ring.
they lost the ashes, they breached the contract, then tried to defraud her with a cubic zirconium.
and with that, I think our time has come to take advantage of them.
$750, 000?
I think we have to take it.
and they'll waive the forgery charges?
they will. You'll have a check this week.
what can I say? Marry me.
then half the money would be mine, I suppose.
you know, once this case is over, I won't be a client anymore.
no, you won't.
you'll be free to do whatever.
I suppose I will.
but... you shouldn't do it here.
we've all heard the moans of the modern-day high school teacher
my kids aren't motivated, they don't want to learn.
A-anthat's real, but we got another epidemic, especially in the middle-class, upper-class and affluent schools.
it's called teenage depression.
a recent study at the centers for disease contro found that 17% of kids in grades 9 through 12 have seriously considered suicide.
what? 17%?
it is now the third leading cause of death for teenagers.
some experts say drowsy driving is as deadly as drunk driving.
80% of teenagers today are sleep deprived.
this now, when we're learning that losing sleep causes a multitude of medical issues, not just depression, but anxiety, weakening of the immune system, A. D.H. D.
high-stress teens are twice as likely to smoke, drink, use drugs.
what the hell is going on?
our kids are overstressed, overscheduled because it's all about getting the gre, getting into a good college.
Oh, they're arriving at college, by the way--fried.
princeton is now considering recommending a gap year between high school and college because freshmen are showing up burned out, in no condition to learn.
why in god's name do we have to teach A. P.Courses in high school?
these are college courses.
what ever happened to wting for college?
and the answer can't be, we have to offer them cause other schools are.
and for all the work those stressed-out kids are doing, there's no correlation between happiness, success and getting into the right school.
none.
meanwhile, they're missing out on fun, downtime, beina teenager.
it's taking a physical and emotional toll.
the neuroscience on multitasking shows it hurts the brain.
it dumbs us down.
all this stuff our kids are doing to get ahead is setting them back.
Samantha Joseph ended up dead.
this is a much bigger picture than high school.
it's our nation's power culture today.
do everything it takes to get ahead.
the athletes take steroids, the students pop adderall, our elected officials engage in dirty politics
it's all about winning.
and parents?
they want their kids to win.
there may be no correlation between success and Harvard, but they want their kids to wear the crimson just the same.
they look at their friends' kids, their neighbors' kids, and they want their own kids to be better than because we are a nation of winners.
Samantha Joseph perhaps died in part because she was doing too much, trying to succeed in a competitive world.
and yet ask any parent what they want most, it's prepare my teen to succeed in a competitive world.
people today with A. I.D. S.Can live a-a long time, but...
many more die quickly, and it is not a fun death.
is death supposed to bfun?
love is.
have you considered, if this worked out, you couldn't have a biological child with him without risking A. I.D. S.To both yourself and the baby?
might you let us have a single date before counseling me on marriage?
relationships start with a single date.
I'm not your mother, but since your parents are in england and I'm the one that hired you,
I would ask you to think very carefully about this.
common sense can be an ugly beast sometimes, can't it?
Judas priest.
too patriotic?
what a suck up.
there's my little litigator man.
Scute. - Andrea.
I couldn't stop thinking abo yoand your big speech and
Andrea, by some miracle, the judge ruled in our favor, which means, oh, joy, we get to keep handling this megacase.
speaking of trials of the century.
Clarence, lorraine, please tell me you got a settlement from the pastor.
we're working on it.
working on it.
here she comes.
I have truly wonderful news.
after Kurt's disgusting behavior yesterday, I confronted him.
we got into a big fight, all kinds of emotions poured out.
sum total-- he still loves me.
we're back together.
I'm dropng the suit.
thank you all so, so much.
Oh, great!
we came out of it with a thank-you.
golly gee.
okay, here's the deal-- you need serious help.
that was a good thing that just happened out there.
two people in love got back together--that's a victory.
the fact that you can't see past the bottom line to appreciate that
you got a problem.
I appreciate it when I fall in love.
as for Maureen's bliss---Oh, wait. When was the last time that happened?
that would be none of your business.
Yes, it is my business, because I want to go out with you.
I'm barely just getting out of a relationship.
Oh, a faux relationship.
we both know that. Even Shirley does.
aside from all of the sexually transmitted diseases I'd be exposing myself to
Oh, that's funny.
my sex is safe, partner.
Oh, there I go, calling you "partner" already.
okay, here's the deal-- when I am not in a relationship, I am prone to a few hollow thrills.
but when I'm in one, I am totally, unflinchingly monogamous.
you need somebody like me. You know you.
and you like me.
why else would you have taken my stupid case?
I think you need to leave now.
I'm not leaving.
I'll call security. - Go ahead. Tell them to bring backup.
I read a book called "Doing School" by Denise Pope.
I found it spot-on.
every parent should read it.
kids "do" school today.
it's not about learning.
it's piling up achievements that look good on the college A. P.
and it's gotten way, way out of hand.
and you know what as a society get out of it?
a nation of test takers, club presidents and volleyball captains.
but we're losing the innovators, the free thinkers, the dreamers.
we lose our values-- honesty, integrity, aracter.
a bunch of outcome-oriented kids are being led by outcome-oriented teachers who are pushed by goal-driven parents.
and 20% of today's teenagers experience depression, and a large percentage of them, like Ms. Rome says, attempt suicide.
we need to get it together, fast.
I feel the high school is more likely in a better position to remedy this than the parents.
I'm going to allow this case to go forward.
we're adjourned.
well, thank you.
this is just the start, Carolyn.
it figures to be a very long journey.
Yes, yes, and I'm prepared to take it.
are you with me?
I am.
okay, next up-- Alan Shore, you'll be rescuing Mr. Crane.
Oh, God help me.
okay, we ready?
maybe I could rescue him by persuading him not to jump in.
go!
try not to drown me.
okay, Mr. Shore, go.
not everybody can get in the water. Somebody's got to drive the boat.
I don't see why I couldn't just drive the boat.
go! - Oh, dear.
get them out.
we'll never get in now.
Oh, shut up.
Where's my money?
I was in the neighborhood and thought
well, actually, I wasn't in the neighborhood.
I had to fight like hell through traffic to get here.
but now that I am here...
what?
I spent a rather long night of the practical soul.
I don't fare very well against practical.
I don't think it would be a great idea for me to fall in love with you, Leo.
and I fear if I were to spend time with you, I'd have no choice.
I realize I'm guilty of a bigotry.
but as bigotries go, one of the more reasonable ones.
you're an incredible man.
I just don't think I can go where this would inevitably lead.
Yeah, it was pretty selfish of me to expect otherwise.
no, it's just- - Katie...
I get it.
um, Andrea was in my office not long ago.
she got down on one knee and asked for permission to marry you.
she'd be good for you, Carl.
hasn't even been a day yet, and you're pimping me out.
I'm jealous actually.
but part of being grown-up, I suppose
we just broke up, for god sake.
nobody's that much a grown-up.
I guess not, but...
I agree with what you said, and I actually do think andrea would be great for you.
and believe it or not, I really do want you to be happy.
she thinks I'm cute.
you are cute, Carl.
you are incredibly cute.
I can still taste the chlorine in my lungs.
Oh, you're being a baby.
it's gonna be on our military record forever, you ow?
we can retake the test. - I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Oh, shut up.
what's the big deal, anyway? - It's a big deal.
if you don't finish at the top of your class, you don't make the short list for officer material. You don't make officer
well, aren't you just one fat microcosm of society?
get ahead. It's just like Whitney's case.
all these high school kids- - How do you know about Whitney's case?
I know because I take time out to talk to my neighbors.
maybe you should try that during one of your sexual solicitations.
go night for a jump. You first.
Oh, shut up.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I screwed up the...
swim test.
I don't like to fail.
I won't even try something if I think there's a risk of failure.
that's absurd---No, it isn't.
we're americans. We're winners. That's our culture.
redeclare victory even if we lose. That's who we are.
well, maybe we all need to be a little more humble.
I don't like fighting.
neither do I.
it's not healthy to go to bed angry at somebody.
especially when it's your best friend.
why don't we just get it over with?
I feel better.
so do I.
sleepover?
I knew it.
forget it, Denny.
one hug, right into the sack.
I said forget it.
it's not that I don't like them, but they need to be special.
if you have them all the time, they lose their specialness.
ey're always special to me.
next time I'll eat something spicy.
the gas will make me buoyant.
they had to pull us to shore.
you were gurgling. - I wasn't.
I heard it.
it was like two beached whales.
Oh, we're pathetic.
I thought you were giving me the heimlich.
Oh, stop it.
did you know?
that Shirley Schmidt has a cheerleading costume?
sometimes she puts it on. ---Complete with pom-poms.
I would dress up and stand In front of the mirror.
in the little skirt, the white socks, he sweater.
it somehow made me feel better.
can you imagine Shirley ??
Oh, my god.
Denny, I got in! I'm in the coast guard!
what?
am I in?
I don't know did you get a letter?
I'm in! - Ah! Ha ha!
we're in the coast guard! - we're in the coast guard!
over there send the word, send the word over there, that the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming, the drums rum-tumming everywhere and prepare 20 degrees starboard.
is that left or right? - I mean port. Go port. Go
Hey, I'm the captain.
will you be quiet? It's right in front of us.
Oh, jeez and we won't come back till it's over over there hey, deejay, turn me out?
you gotta...??
why don't you show me? Get below me ?
united states Coast guard coming aboard.
nobody move.
you're all persons of interest.
who's in charge of this event?
I am. - Do you have a permit, ma'am?
for what? - Right to assemble at sea's
strictly forbidden without written
and express authorization from the united states coast guard.
what?
sorry, ma'am. We're in a war.
but lucky for you, and perhaps me later,
I am the coast guard.
I'm gonna let it go This one time,
brand-new.
well-done.
okay, Denny, The situation is
how did you possibly get out of your clothes so fast?
semper Paratus, my friend.
always prepad-- Cot guard motto.
and so it begins.
for the last seven years,
I've basically had one case that's consumed me.
it's against A. B. Curtis, It's tobacco company.
and how's the family?
these people have dragged me through discovery.
they've exhausted my client's money, my money.
they practically killed my client's doctor.
he's dead, Alan.
he was a smoker?
no, but he was in his 70s.
they deposed him 13 times.
he died over the weekend,
just as we were about to go to trial,
no doubt from the stress of it all.
now I don't have a doctor to testify.
I'll have to get a continuance,
which they'll then turn Into ten more continuances
while they depose my new doctor 13 more times.
I can't do it. I'm licked.
nobody successfully sues a tobacco company.
even if you beat them at trial, they just appeal.
law firms go bankrupt trying to climb that hill.
Oh, you know how I feel about money, Especially when it's yours.
I must say, I echo Shirley's Sentiment. I do. I do.
tobacco companies specialize in two things
one, getting people addicted to cigarettes,
and two, prolonging and protracting pretrial litigation.
I tell you, they simply Make cases too burdensome,
even for big firms like us.
certainly more than could be handled by your average dwarf.
I, too, am against taking on the tobacco company,
and the firm absolutely forbids you from taking it.
Katie, Jerry, give Alan whatever help he needs.
best of luck.
thank you.
Denny, I could also use your help If you're up for joining.
Mm. Whatever.
Mr. Crane! Mr. Crane!
Mr. Shore! Mr. Shore!
no comment. Nothing to say.
step aside, please.
no comment. Lawyers comihrough.
handicapped. Outta my way.
are you joining as cocounsel?
Yes.
excellent.
still married with, uh, What is it they're called?
children. - Got it.
all rise.
3-2-4-6-3--in the matter of the estate of michael rhodes Vs. A. b. Curtis tobacco corporation,
the complainant alleging the civil cause of wrongful death,
this court is now in session,
the honorable Milton Brody presiding.
be seated.
okay. Both sides stand ready?
well, actually, your honor, The defense would be requesting more time.
the plaintiff has added a witness to its list
whom we've not had the opportunity to depose.
therefore, I-- - the witness, your honor,
is a doctor who will only be testifying as to cause of death.
we are forced to call him
because the doctor we had planned to call
who has been called Again and again and again
died this past weekend
after being deposed, harassed and intimidated relentlessly for the last 7 of his 77 years.
the fact is, my, uh,
uh, uh, the defense, Has employed a plethora of tactics To delay a delay and delay.
I'm curious. Do you have any ideas that speed things up?
well, surrender works and I do know - how you love to wave a white flag. - Objection!
all right. All right.
ms. Prentice, I will give you a night
one night-- to review the new witnesses
that have been added to the plaintiff's list.
we will begin at 10: 00 a. m. Tomorrow. Adjourned.
you know...
once the cancer had metastasized,
it became about managing his pain,
which was extreme.
I'd like to know.
may I continue?
please.
there were many other cancer-causing agents
that Mr. Rhodes was exposed to, right?
I'm sorry. Is that going to be your strategy,
that something else killed him?
we can suspend this right now, Alan,
and go see the judge
if this is all too much for you to handle.
don't flatter yourself. - No, I wasn't talking about me.
funny that you are.
something on your heart but share with the rest of the group?
I'm sorry. I meant to say on your mind.
stop it.
you two can get a room after the trial.
uh, was an autopsy ever performed, doctor?
Oh, we didn't need an autopsy to know what killed him.
no autopsy.
are you kidding?
ms. Rhodes
my father smoked for 50 years. He died of lung cancer.
do you really mean to suggest--- Ma'am, I need to
have you ever watched a person rot to death?
Alan, maybe you can contain your client's emotions,
if not your own.
what happened to you?
all right. I'm done.
if you plan to march into that courtroom and ask for a continuance
no. I got what I need. Did you?
thank you.
is that how you plan to try this case?
don't start with me, Denny. All right?
do you have any idea how many people die every day from cigarettes?
Oh, please. What else is new?
tobacco kills. Big deal. - Did you just say "big deal"?
well, it's old news. - First of all,
it's not just old news. It's absolely current.
the tobacco industry is more powerful today-- - it's boring.
what, have we all just been desensitized? Smoking kills. Whatever.
we've all just gone numb.
why'd you say that?
who told you I went numb?
who said that?
what are you talking about?
you damn well know.
did she call you?
Denny, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
so why don't you tell me?
you have been In a bad mood all day.
what is up?
nothing's up. That's the problem.
my junk doesn't work.
I beg your pardon?
I went back to the captain's quarters with one of the girls from the hot tub...
my junk failed me. - Oh.
I'm done, Alan, dead. - Denny
I wish I were dead.
I'd have made a better showing with rigor mortis.
I'm dead. Done. It's over.
Denny, It happens to every guy.
has it happened to you?
once.
hello.
hello.
how'd the deposition go?
fine. Why?
there are rumors you were horrendous.
Alan, I'm happy to support your latest tilt at the windmill,
but we know one never really beats
the tobacco industry, right?
and if opportunity for settlement does come,
we will take it, won't we?
it's receded...
like a turtle...
too ashamed To come out its shell.
what?
Shirley, could I, uh, steal you for a second?
it's about my penis.
it's depressed.
I-I don't want to involve you, but-- - don't even go there.
okay, okay.
would you at least put on The cheerleader costume for me?
because-- - sorry.
have you tried jumper cables?
you think this is funny?
okay. Would you loan me the cheerleading costume?
Denny... - give me a hand here, will you, Carl?
two witnesses total? - Bethany
I've spent 7 years preparing more than 50 experts
if we let this Turn into a science class
we have to prove addiction. We have to show that
you asked me to try this case. So let me
two! - I want to rest as close as I can
to the emotion Of the client's test
Where'd she go?
she left.
I must say, Alan, two witnesses seems a bit bonkers.
I would hope you haven't gone mad.
Katie, one problem we have concerning trust
you and I haven't really had a life together yet.
still harassing the younger associates?
so nice to see you haven't changed.
why are you here?
well, I come in peace.
140000
for a death? - It's all we're offering.
it's all you could hope to get since we'll appeal any verdict.
and why drag this out beyond a time
we're still attracted to each other, hmm?
I'm not attracted to you now.
fine. Let's go witth.
when knew him, he was mad, By the way.
I think I'll be going.
I have done hundreds of these cases,
and they all come out the same way...
so why stress yourself, Alan?
it's not healthy. You'd be better off taking up smoking.
you know, the thing is, Phoebe,
you look the same,
you smell the same...
you even taste the same...
but we both know you've changed, don't we?
I mean, when we were together,
the very idea of either of us
doing battle for big tobacco
an industry which systematically kills people...
I hope they give you a lot of money, then.
because, of course, It would be worth it.
Mm. And here you are at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
I don't need to apologize for myself.
no, not when it's easier to just walk out the door. - I didn't walk
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
you know what?
I think that you have changed, Alan.
your eyes look... deadened.
they say that a man's passion is the first thing to die as he ages,
so I suppose that should make it easier for me to be around you,
because it was your passion that I so fell in love with.
your offer is rejected
so you can leave now.
okay, Alan.
we'll be seeing you, then.
he first started smoking cigarettes when he was 11.
he smoked the defendant's brand?
mainly that brand, yes.
and your father smoked cigarettes for how long?
over 50 years.
Maureen, at some point, your father certainly had to know that smoking causes cancer.
he tried to quit so many times.
he was desperate to quit, but he was addicted.
sometimes he could go months without,
but he'd always start up again.
he just couldn't-- - Oh, baby.
Ohh, that feels so good.
don't stop.
Hello?
Denny. - it's my doctor.
I don't care. - shh.
I did that, but it still doesn't work.
get off the phone now.
I gotta get off the phone now.
what?
I'm sorry.
and a-at some point, your father did get lung cancer.
11 years ago.
he fought it. He-- He had one lung removed.
he did everything that...
but, um,
eventually It went to his brain.
in the end, it was, uh, a miserable excruciating death.
Maureen, in fairness, the dangers of smoking have been well-known, for some time by everybody,
including your father.
that fact only made it worse.
I had to watch my father
do something over and over,
all day, every day,
that he knew would eventually kill him,
and he just couldn't stop.
he was addicted since childhood,
terribly addicted.
you don't keep doing that to yourself for no reason.
you do it because you physically can't stop.
she's no foundation to give medical or science
he was my father.
that's my foundation.
it wasn't just physical.
he suffered the shame of being an addict,
and even if you're Heartless enough to think,
well, he signed on for this, I never signed up for it.
I'm sorry if I sound selfish, but I never said, "sure, I'll watch my father go through that agony.
my children never agreed they'd lose their grandpa the way...
there was so much pain...
so much pain to so many people
who never signed up for it.
first let me say...
how sorry am I for your loss.
losing a family member to cancer is Is this the first time?
um, no. Actually
so cancer runs in your family then? - Objection.
your honor, there has been a recent medical study
that found that there is a common genetic variant
that actually doubles the risk of lung cancer.
it can run in the family. - oh, yes.
it was just a big coincidence that he smoked.
was your father ever tested for this genetic variant?
no.
I understand that your father worked in a paper mill, - which since-- - Are you kidding?
Mr. Shore.
um, Ms. Rhodes,
how many houses do you think your father lived in during his lifetime?
I'm not sure. Maybe six or seven.
did any of them contain asbestos?
uh, I-I don't really know. Perhaps.
what about arsenic or silica or chromium?
were any of his houses tested for any of these substances?
all of which can cause lung cancer,
if you wonder why I ask.
I don't know if they were tested for those substances.
what about radon? - Radon?
Yes, radon. It's a gas. It comes from rocks and dirt.
it gets trapped in houses and buildings.
it's quite common, actually.
odorless, colorless and it also causes lung cancer.
were any of your father's homes ever tested for radon?
not to my knowledge.
I see.
thank you.
and, again, my deepest condolences for your loss.
how'd it go?
okay.
you're hurting me. -Hey. Hey! What the hell was that with the phone?
my doctor's idea. He thought it might stimulate
for god sake, Denny,
and I hear?
well, I tried putting it on vibrate, - but it wasn't the --- I asked you to be part of this case
because I could use your help.
this is the tobacco dustry we're up against! - I know--I know--I know that.
it is near impossible to beat them,
and my odds do not improve by my cocounsel's phone chirping,"ooh, baby, baby,"
while I'm trying to cross-examine a witness. - it was a medical emergency!
medical emergency? Because you couldn't get it up in a hot tub?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't attack me just 'cause... - you know, not everything in life -you're getting your ass kicked by your ex-girlfriend. -takes a backseat to your sex life.
you're not in high school, Denny. - All I did was accept a call
as sophomoric as you're determined to be-- - well, forgive me for expecting a little sympathy.
sympathy? My client's father is dead! - but here I am, I'm struggling with who and what I am.
I turn to my best friend... - You want sympathy because your penis failed!
he treats me with contempt-- - No, I'm sorry. I'm not giving you sympathy, Denny.
I'm just trying to get an erection! - Well, who knows? Maybe it's the mad cow.
I'm sure it's not that.
what if it is?
my penis has alzheimer's.
no, Denny. you just... had an off day.
you said it happened to you once. What were the ciumstances?
it was with her, actually-Phoebe. - What happened?
I was in love with her.
Oh. That'll kill the moment.
and she loved me, Just...not enough.
I mean, no relationship is ever quite even. There's always an imbalance of sorts.
one person loves or is in love just a little more than the other, but...
I just couldn't handle being...
so I left.
maybe it's not too late.
she's happily married with children.
Oh.
it's too late.
and personally, I take great offense at constantly being vilified.
well, tobacco companies do make for juicy targets.
well, let me tell you something
car manufacturers make products that kill
if you want to look at vehicular fatality statistics.
Alcohol--forget it. But we also do some good along the way.
nobody wants to talk about that.
Oh, please. What good?
how about this? We spend billions of dollars in antismoking campaigns and youth preventi efforts.
how many industries actually spend money
to discourage people from buying their product?
that is an unprecedented display of corporate conscience.
in fairness, you might have mentioned the "American Journal of Public Health" study
that found teens who watch antismoking Ads aimed at young people were actually 36% more likely to smoke.
I don't agree with their findings.
I bet you also disagree with the numerous public health advocates who've called for a ban on all youth antismoking campaigns funded by the tobacco industries,
charging they employ insidious reverse psychology,
deliberately designed to get teens to smoke.
well, there again is an
like cigaretteflavored with chocolate, strawberry - and candy spices to lure children. - we don't do that anymore.
because it was finally outlawed.
at which point, you turned your focus to menthol, - which is neat, -- - menthol is legal.
and profitable, since it's the cigarette of choice for 75% of african-americans.
look-- - look at what?
your product, even when used as directed, kills One-third to one-half of its consumers.
in fact, cigarettes Kill more than car accidents,
homicides, suicides, A.I.D.S. and drugs combined
one death every six seconds.
so just during your testimony...
another 50 or 60 people have choked out.
your company murders people, Mr. Buttram.
objection, your honor. - Sustained.
Mr. Espenson, uh, emotion has no play here,
and unless you can ask questions, we're moving on.
Oh, get a grip, judge.
sorry.
Alurs.
excuse me?
I said the witness is all yours.
thank you.
were you delusional?
not delusional so much as... I don't know,
like I was in another universe all of a sudden, somewhere on cable.
there's only one explanation. You're still in love with her.
no.
no, I'm just reminded of what it felt like to love her.
she said that my eyes...
that the fire was gone
and that passion Is the first thing to go when...
that's been one of my greatest fears, Denny,
that as I got older...
"deadened" was the word shused.
deadened.
you in the eyes, me in the junk.
on top of it, I'm losing.
I think I made a huge mistake not putting up more witnesses.
she just put up a mountain of expert testimony.
Alan...when you step up to do your closings,
you're anything but dead.
she hasn't got a taste of your case yet.
she has no idea of how undead you become in that courtroom.
a masterpiece of nature.
Oh, come on. She's not that hot.
I wasn't talking about her.
Denny, I need to go work on my closing.
as I said, tobacco companies do make for easy targets.
and I am sure that there is a part of you that wants to get them.
so if you find that my client caused the death of Mr. Rhodes,
then by all means,
return with a judgment for the plaintiff.
but you simply can't make that finding here.
Yes, he smoked.
his daughter says that It was mostly my client's brand,
but we have no substantiation of that.
and while cigarettes may be the most probable culprit,
no autopsy was ever done.
he wants you to decide this on emotion.
but as judge brody has already instructed,
emotion has no play here.
this is a court of law,
and as such, I will ask that you rule on the evidence.
after all...
you did take an oath to do exactly that.
michael rhodes smoked cigarettes for 50 years,
got lung cancer and died.
we all know what happened here.
we also all know this death.
everybody in this room knows somebody who has fought this same battle and died this agonizing,
but emotion has no play here.
michael rhodes was 11 years old when he started smoking.
it was 1948.
at that time, there was no known risk,
and even if there were, at 11,
he certainly lacked the capacity to assume it.
and after that, he was addicted.
they manufacture them to be addictive.
in just the last few years,
they've increased the amount of nicotine
in the average cigarette by 11. 6% To make them even more addictive.
recently, we learned thatobacco companies have been adding an ammonia-based compound to cigarettes for years
to increase absorption of nicotine.
it's basically the same principle used in crack cocaine.
and let's look at the obscene strategy they've employed here.
smoking may cause cancer,
but it didn't cause this particular cancer.
it wasn't our cigarettes
or it was genetic or asbestos or a paper mill.
never do they take responsibility, ever.
and god forbid
if you sue them, they'll bury you and your lawyer.
they might even depose your doctor to death for good measure.
all their insidious methods and cunning corporate tactics
aren't just history.
it's what they continue to do now, today,
because the tobacco industry is like a nest of cockroaches.
they will always find a way to survive. - Objection.
they still go after kids with one strategy after another.
they put up brightly colored ads
at kids' eye level in convenience stores.
they hire gorgeous twentysomethings
to frequent popular venues and seduce young adults
into attending lavish corporate-sponsored parties.
cockroaches will always find a way.
they can't advertise on TV, but they've hired p. r. Agencies
to hook them up with the film industry, and it's worked.
researchers estimate that smoking in movies
delivers nearly 400, 000 new adolescent Smokers every year.
every time you try to kill the cockroach,
it finds another way.
it has to, because when you make a product that kills off your consumers,
you have to find a way to recruit new customers.
they've now got a new feminized version of the macho camel brand,
using slogans like, "light and luscious,"
uh, with hot pink packaging.
uh, Virginia slims advertised their "thin" cigarette.
allure" magazine did a whole spread on the cigarette diet.
they use social anpsychological profiling,
targeting potential smokers by gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, socioeconomic groups.
cockroaches don't discriminate.
their C. E.O. comes into this courtroom
gloating over their antismoking campaign,
which is designed to get kids to smoke.
in 2005, they spent more than $15 billion
on advertising and promotion.
that's a 225% increase from 1998,
and they have the audacity to declare they're trying to discourage smoking.
this is not how corporations with a conscience behave.
how in god's name are cigarette's even legal?
can anybody tell me that?
they are a deadly concoction of carcinogens
that damage every single organ in your body.
why do we not ban them? Because it's a free country?
because freedom of choice is an american ideal
worth somebody dying every six seconds?
how can any company,
especially one with such a conscience, no less,
knowingly manufacture a product that poisons its users,
and make that product look cool and hip and sexy and fun
so they can get children?
how can any attorney
defend a company that would do such a thing?
and how can any society tolerate it? But we do.
there is no conscience at big tobacco.
there is no conscience in washington,
which has been bought and paid for by this industry.
conscience has to come from you, the jury.
if real regulation is to happen,
it has to come from you.
people are smoking day after day after day
and dying and dying and dying,
and the tobacco companies keep getting richer and richer.
last year alone, they made $12 billion in profits.
how can that be?
how can that be?
what?
how about we win, you come back to my place,
get in the hot tub naked, and I'll bob for you?
that's a pass.
my client has expressed an interest in working this out.
that's a pass, too. - don't you want to hear a number?
I don't need to hear your number.
excuse me. Jury has a verdict. - Already?
let's go hear their number.
maybe we should at least listen to what they have to say.
it's not too late. - Yes, it is, for them.
Mr. Foreman, the jury has reached a verdict?
we have your honor. - what say you?
in the matter of rhodes vs. A. B. Curtis Tobacco company,
on the count of wrongful death,
we find in favor of the plaintiff.
hot damn!
and we order the defendant to pay compensatory damages in the amount of $600, 000.
we further order the defendant To pay punitive damages
in the amount of $213 million.
what?
defense moves for a judgment not with standing the verdict.
denied.
defense moves to set aside the award as excessive.
denied. - We appeal.
so noted. Members of the jury, This completes your service.
the, uh, court dismisses you with their thanks,
and we are adjourned.
you gotta feel like getting naked now.
Mr. Shore...
I don't know what to say. - Neither do I.
Alan...thank you so, so much.
Alan, uh, a second, please...
in private?
Well...congratulations.
obviously, we'll be fighting this.
it'll be years and years before this thing is remotely over.
I've got time. it's not as if i'm dying or anything.
no, you're... Quite not.
well, I, um...
I don't do appellate work,
So'll be passing this on to another lawyer...
so...
I guess this is good-bye then.
Yes.
well...
good-bye, alan.
good-bye.
you still have me.
it's not quite the same.
but you know what, Denny?
sometimes it comes remarkably close.
what you said to me about being undead in the courtroom,
it...
it's not lost on me how lucky I am
to have somebody in my life who can...
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Ahh.
you know, as much as I hate cigarettes,
I so miss the cigarette break
a little respite where coworkers would go outside and be communal,
discuss the trivial annoyances and affections in their lives
that always turned out to be anything but trivial.
and to think, I might not even know you
but for the fact that we both like to smoke these smelly cancer sticks
that can only be smoked outside.
hmm.
that would be a tragedy.
I especially can't imagine being alone now...
when my junk has alzheimer's. - Denny.
well, it's a symptom. You said so yourself.
it figures.
for me, it wou be the first thing to go.
what's that?
what? Oh. I didn't see it.
is that the
n-- see ya.
whoa, whoa, whoa. At least let me see it.
Oh, my.
it's a two-piece, Denny. A share toy.
forget it. - Come on.
it was a gift to me. - You take top. I'll take bottom.
not a chance. Ooh.
what?
I'm cured. I'm back. I'm gone.
whoawhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
why not savor this moment?
at my age, I'm lucky to last a moment.
you take the top, I'll take the bottom.
tomorrow we'll switch off.
it'll be just like the 3-way you've always wanted.
I never wanted you as part of the 3.
I have never asked you for anything.
I am youbest friend. - oh, Alan!
how can you possibly be so selfish and cruel?
don't ruin it.
Oh, my god. - see ya.
what's your rush? Slow down.
treat her right.
romance her a little.
at least...
dance with her first.
dance?
hold her. Drink her in.
cherish her.
for the way you look at me "O" is for...
this is magic.
it's fantastic.
God, are we weird? - So weird.
Oh, you think you'll win. $50, 000 says you won't.
I'm not going to bet you.
you know you'll lose.
I won't lose.
50000.0
he's out of control.
your industry is out of control.
you've bitten off more than you can chew this time, my friend.
Oh, I don't swallow. I just chew up and spit out.
we'll see.
I know exactly how big and powerful you are, mr. Mathis.
it might do you some good To check me out.
you're losing. - I'm not losing.
Oh, yes, you're losing. Double it?
fine.
is it not red?
they're always red In the morning.
see?
you stay out of this. I know Salmonella when I've got it.
excuse me.
uh, my--my name's Jason Canfield.
I'm looking for Mr. Poole.
Ah, well, Mr. Poole is not, Uh, here at the moment.
or there, for that matter. May I help you?
well, I was just passing by your building and saw the sign,
and I need a lawyer.
so... How about Crane? - uh, Mr. Crane is fun.
you can always talk about him when he's in the room,
which is a nice, but I don't Think he's your man either.
so that leaves Schmidt.
I'm Schmidt. Let's go to my office.
why wouldn't he ask for me? Am I not t star of this show?
you see your name up there?
this is not about how good you are.
it's not?
it's all about credit. That's What's important in life.
credit.
and money.
I thought it was all about getting the girl.
tell me it's values, Carl. It's about getting the girl, right? Money.
money. - Sex.
money. You call it. - Sex.
maybe it's money and sex. - They go together.
one begetsche other.
see? We're not fighting. We're in sync.
I can't be sure, but i think Carl wants to be in sync, too.
was he killed in Iraq?
no, no. They patched him up okay there, brought him back.
he died in a hospital here. The doctor killed him.
but I know for a fact that there was malactice,
because he admitted it.
Mr. Canfield, I've tried a number of medical malpractice cases in my time.
I've yet to run across a doctor who admitted his or her wrongdoing.
Yeah, but this one did.
it--but I can't sue,
because it happened in a military hospital.
something called the Feres doctrine.
you heard of that?
yes it--it basically
insulates military hospitals and their staffs from lawsuits
when the victims are on active duty.
my brother's not on active duty anymore, Ms. Schmidt.
he's dead.
I'm afraid the doctrine would still apply.
so there's... There's nothing I can do?
nothing?
well...
but the law is clear. Soldiers are
Alan, I-I know.
it's completely unwinnable. It doesn't even make sense to try.
which is why I've come to you.
I've so missed watching the Brave knight fight the windmill.
Irley, this lawsuit Is barred.
there's a supreme court case directly on point,
and it's not like you to want to waste the firm's money.
what's going on?
what's going on is, when a man comes in off the street whose only brother Has been wrongfully killed
and asks you for your help,
you help.
it's that simple. You help.
would it be the pentagon, then?
well, it... It might.
are you close, you and your sister?
well, mainly, she'd throw rocks at me.
got it.
she was a bit overbearing and... and extremely punctual.
she should be here any
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing on the desk?
joy Espenson. Get down. Are you his girlfriend?
no, I just
you're just what, purely sexual?
joy! This is Katie Lloyd, my colleague, a lawyer.
you apologize this instant.
okay.
I'm here about your nephew henry.
I have concerns. I need your help.
what concerns?
well, he's 15. He's going through puberty.
he's starting to get an acute interest in sex.
isn't that natural?
and he may be dating His sister.
what?
you heard me.
but he's an only child.
well, he is or he isn't. We don't know.
he was conceived by an anonymous sperm donor.
I have an excellent sex life so long as men don't actually have to get In the bedroom with me.
anyway, turns out Fiona, that's the girlfriend Fiona
she was conceived By an anonymous sperm donor.
it also turns out she's the spitting image of Henry.
I'm thinking, what are the odds? Are you with me?
to be honest,
I'm still recovering from the gripping apology.
I met Fiona's mother. We both used the same agency
my god, what if?
I mean, what if they fall in love and get married
and start reproducing?
w-well, let's simply take D. N.A. Swabs and
D. N.A. is not conclusive with half siblings.
could you speak to him?
me?
he loves you.
does she ever speak?
I must say, when I first read the complaint,
I couldn't decide
whether it was just laughable or nonsensical.
now that I see Who the attorney is,
it makes sense that it's laughable.
Wade and I go back.
how's that discovery going, by the way?
it might be proceeding more quickly
if I wasn't sidetracked by baseless, groundless, frivolous claims.
he's a big fan of adjectives.
Yes, I go back a little bit with wade as well.
Really?
the hospital has admitted comtting gross misconduct,
which caused the victim's death.
but it's a military hospital. They're immune.
fine. We have the merits, you have the legal technicalities.
let's meet somewhere in the middle.
the technicality here is the trump card.
the supremcourt clearly held
you can't touch military hospitals. Game over.
that ruling was 50 years ago. Things change.
things change?
will that be your legal argument, things change?
I'll have you know, Tony Scalia is personal friend of mine,
and trust me, he has no interest whatsoever
in what any supreme court before him has said.
I don't know why I even bothered to come over here.
because you miss me, Wade.
hug? We're a nation of huggers, you know?
we will take this to court.
fine. Do that.
have a lovely day.
what?
we don't really want it to end quickly, do we? He's fun.
I certainly understand your concerns.
but we have contractual agreements
assuring absolute confidentiality with all of our anonymous donors.
he could be dating his sister.
I appreciate your legal obligations,
but contracts can be vitiated on grounds of public policy.
and your public policy argument would be what?
he's dating his sister!
are these your children? - Yes, they are.
you have a beautiful family.
I can see they even look like you.
Henry espenson wonders whom he looks like.
do you really think it's fair, Mr. Chism,
that Henry's right to know his genetic lineage was simply... contracted away from him?
Mr. Espens, without assunce of anonymity,
many sperm donors wouldn't donate.
it's possible Henry might not even exist.
and if we were to look at the equation as best interest of the sperm donor,
I'd side with you, but since courts typically opt for best interest of the child
and Henry would be better off on born?
believe me, Mr. Espenson, I've heard all the arguments.
and as I said, I do sympathize,
but there is no wiggle room on this one.
we will not tell you who the sperm donor is.
all right, listen, buddy, I've tried to play nice here,
but if we have to go to court, I'll do it.
I'll close your doors, and then you can liquidate
all your little test tubes
and turkey basters, your porn videos.
see this here? It's a cigarette, bub.
and you can put it out Like this,
just snuff it in an ashtray,
or I can stomp it with my size-13 boats.
either way, It's extinguished, pal.
whether you want to be snuffed, stomped or sucked dry,
we can do it nice, do it rough.
how's gonna be?
just...
Yes, security, please.
I am not being a traitor. I'm supporting our troops.
why aren't you?
isn't this war costing us enough
without the lawyers coming in
Oh, I don't want to get into this.
Alan, I'm gonna tell you something
and you need to hear this-- America is sick of bush bashing.
enough already.
I'm not bashing Bush.
you're suing the military, which is the pentagon,
which is the government, which is Bush.
it all comes down to Bush.
Denny, this isn't about Bush.
this is about the troops risking their lives in the
Oh, please.
after the debacle at Walter Reed,
you must be kidding.
these kids are returning with catastrophic wounds.
who the hell is looking out for them, really? Not congress.
it's one you can't win, Alan.
says who?
says law.
says the united states supreme court.
says $50, 000.
you know what? I don't...
you want to bet.
Uh-huh. If you insist on being an idiot,
at least let me profit from it.
have you no shame whatsoever?
none.
all proceeds to go the troops.
fine.
fine.
fine.
there are reasons for this doctrine, Ms. Schmidt.
Yes, your honor, bad ones.
these kids fight our wars.
it's an undue burden to compensate them
when they're victims of medical malpractice?
the soldier in question
lost his life because of an avoidable,
negligent hospital screwup
it's not just the money.
subjecting the military hospitals to discovery
Oh, come on.
may I finish?
you didn't let me finish.
your honor, this goes beyond bad faith.
we send these kids to war. They come back in need of medical care,
our doctors commit Malpractice, and we tell them, "oops. You can't sue because of a-a doctrine"
that selectively singles out and punishes soldiers"?
I thought he was the speech maker.
no, today you got me.
at least let me call a witness or two.
my client lost his only brother.
if he can't have his day in court,
at least give him an hour.
all right. I'll allow you to call witnesses
as to the legality of the doctrine.
your honor, if she doesn't like the law,
her recourse is the legislature, not a judge.
well, thank you, Mr. Mathis. I know what my role is.
0.0833333333333
you started sucking on the cigarette?
well, wh-what happened?
well... I just saw my sister looking at me
like I was this big loser, the way she did growing up.
did she really throw rocks at you?
Yes.
she thought if a hard object came hurtling at my head,
I'd have to lift my hands off my thighs to block it.
she does love me in her way, but her way sucks.
it's a prop.
so what happens now with the case?
well, we go to court, but first, we have to tell Henry.
how can I help?
you can't really. I need to do this
can you?
it's a prop.
sometimes I think about retiring,
but what would I do?
I hate golf. I don't much like to travel.
do you ever think about retiring?
not really,
as long as I can practice law on my own terms.
and you're doing that?
still able to put your judgments In question form, I see.
I'm still on the board of bar overseers.
there's a lot of talk about your firm lately.
is there?
Yes, regarding its, uh...
slide.
I wasn't aware of any slide.
two of your name partners have lost their minds,
and you...
what about me?
I've known you a long time. May I be brutally honest?
Oh, please.
this Alan Shore is dragging you into the sewer.
it's now his thumbprints all over Crane, Poole & Schmidt,
not yours.
he's unscrupulous,
he's disrespectful to our judiciary,
he's a bad seed,
and his reputation...
is running to your firm as a whole, to you.
I see his influence in play in--in this very case.
you brought a baseless, frivolous cause of acion barred by law. Why?
are you done?
go ahead. Let me have it. I'm a big boy.
I've practiced a long time, worked with some of the highest-ranking members of our profession
I include you among them,
but I have yet to be associated with a more skilled, more principled, more noble attorney than Alan Sshore.
if his is the reputation I'm to be saddled with,
I will take it. And lunch is over.
if you want to reject my opinion,
that's your prerogative.
but here's a fact-- He is putting your firm in peril.
believe me when I tell you that.
Jerry, thank you so much for helping me tell him.
I'm just so afraid if he hears it from me,
he'll hate my guts forever.
Hey, mom. Hi, uncle Jerry.
Henry! Hello. Welcome.
this could take a while.
it's so good to see you.
you, too. This is my girlfriend Fiona.
I brought her along, if that's okay.
we're kind of inseparable.
so what's the big mystery? Did I Inherit money or something?
did my birth father keel?
so really, What's the deal?
let's... Go into The conference room
where we all can sit.
are you currently serving in the military, sir?
no, I'm a retired captain for the U.S. Army.
I served until last year.
and what were your primary responsibilities?
for the last nine years, I was mainly in recruiting,
getting young men to enlist.
did you retire on good terms?
not so much.
could you tell us why?
well...it was suggested I retire after I was a little too outspoken
on what I perceived as a backdoor draft.
um, when you say "backdoor draft"
I mean we target the poor.
no one likes to say it publicly, but that's what we do.
and you target low-income youth because?
they needed the money. Most kids don't want
to go off and fight wars if they can avoid it,
so we hone in on the kids without options.
the poor.
the poor. We set up our recruitment stations in the poor neighborhood malls and in the poor high schools.
I'm sorry.
