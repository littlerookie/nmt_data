Oh, don't forget his coat.
I'll find some way to get him to like me.
I'm sure you will.
boy, I'll bet the gift shop at the zoo just loves divorce.
so... How you doing, son?
not so good.
okay, well, don't worry.
Bob here has agreed to represent you.
and when we're done here, I'm going to go to the D.A.
and we're going to start talking about bail.
but first, I gotta ask you a few questions.
like why do the police have a witness? - Lynette.
the D.A.says you were spotted coming out of the storage room right before the fire started.
what gives? - I don't know what they're talking about.
I have an alibi. - You do?
G-great. Great.
why haven't you told anyone this?
it's just... so embarrassing.
you are up for manslaughter, and you're worried about being embarrassed?
if we can verify your story, I can probably get the charges dropped.
we wouldn't even need bail. So where were you?
I was at Edie Britt's.
Oh, please. Tell me you're not having sex with her, too.
dad. - What is wrong with girls your own age?
do you know what I would give to date a 17-year-old?
okay, we're gonna talk about that later. You were saying?
I'm not having sex with Edie.
after I left the club, I went to her house, but only so I could break in and steal her gun.
why would you do that?
Mr. Schilling beat up Anne and then humiliated me.
I wanted to s-scare the hell out of him just to wipe that smug look off his face.
but when I got back to the club, it was on fire,
so I went home and hid the gun in mom's flour jar.
anyway that's my alibi.
think that'll help?
did anyone see you do this? - No.
then this is really not an alibi.
it's more a confession to another crime.
well, you missed it. - Missed what?
porter Scavo got arrested today.
I knew he set that fire.
poor Lynette. - "poor lynette," my ass.
poor seven people who got burned to death. Boy.
I wouldn't wanna be in Lynette's shoes right now.
can you imagine what she's going through?
I mean, he is her son, so she's kind of responsible.
God, the guilt she must be feeling.
Dave, what the hell?
you-you're bleeding.
okay, come on. In the house. Let's get this cleaned up. Come here.
you're just gonna sneak it back into Edie's house? What, are you crazy?
Tom, if you're gonna freak out, can you do that in the other room?
I'm kind of busy here.
what has happened to us?
I mean, w-we're posting bail, returning stolen guns-- when did this become our life?
if Edie reports this gun missing, you don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force to figure out where to start looking, and that's the last thing we need right now.
thank god for you, Lynette. You always know what to do in a crisis.
well, I try.
you're my rock. Lynette. You know that, don't you?
Tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon. You mind?
Thanks.
you're home kind of early. Is everything okay?
go up to your room. I'll come in in a minute. We'll talk about what happened.
what did happen?
well, M.J. threw his hot fudge sundae at katherine.
Seriously?
that's terrible. Is she okay?
well, she's got nuts and whipped cream all in her hair, And that little plastic coconut bowl scratched her forehead.
Susan. - I'am sorry.
the--the image in my mind is probably way funnier than what actually happened.
why did M.J.do that?
I don't know. Katherine and I were talking about spending christmas in Bermuda,
and she said she didn't want to go, 'cause she thinks she doesn't look good in a bathing suit,
and I said she could be on the cover of "sports illustrated," and bam!
M.J.throws his dessert.
that's the worst thing I've ever heard.
well, he is only 5.
no, I'm talking about that line you fed her.
"sports illustrated"?
what's the issue about, the senior Olympics?
I'm going to talk to M.J.
I mean, I could see her on the cover of "menopause monthly."
congratulations, Carlo
everything is still a little blurry.
I can only make out, like, shapes and shadows.
but in a week or so, everything should be clear as a bell.
the whole thing's like a miracle.
and Gaby has been so patient through all of this.
she's really been an angel.
damn it, Carlos. What are you, a ron?
Ah, I hear a little voice from heaven now.
why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses?
the doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light.
I can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.
Whoops. Was that my baseball? - Yeah. I got it.
what do you think? Pretty cool, huh?
uh, yeah. It's... Round.
look at it. It was signed by Lou Gehrig.
Oh, looky there. Lou Gehrig.
it was a gift passed down from my grandfather to my father then to me.
it was? I didn't know that.
I thought it was some stupid collectors item.
no. That's why I wouldn't let you sell it when we were low on cash.
uh, Carlos, I think it's time to put your eyedrops in.
why don't you go do that?
excuse me, ladies.
Oh, don't look at me that way.
I did what I had to do.
Gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball.
the car needed tires.
how was I supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back?
I mean, of all the rotten luck.
who did you sell the ball to?
I don't know. Some Italian guy.
Hey, Mike's into baseball.
he must know someone who can track down this Lou Gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one.
what?
it's okay.
what's going on? Is there news?
the judge just set bail.
Oh, thank god. How much?
20000. - That's high.
where are we gonna get that kind of money?
I guess we'll have to tap our emergency fund. We've got 14 grand in there.
we've got another 800 more in the Christmas club.
look, we'll scrape it together.
Oh, God. G--I gotta get to the restaurant.
Lynette, can you go to the bank and take care of that?
Oh, sure. - Okay. Good.
thank you. - Yeah.
okay, well, I'll notify the judge that you intend to post bail.
wait. Slow down. - What?
you're my lawyer, so anything I tell you is in confidence, right?
well, technically, I'm Porter's lawyer, so don't
just go with me on this. There is no emergency fund.
I gave that money to Anne Schilling so she'd leave town, and Tom has no idea.
okay, just so I have this straight, you paid off a potential witness to get her to flee?
Hey. Whose lawyer are you anyway?
again, I'm Porter's-- - what am I supposed to do?
where am I gonna get that bail money?
you could go to a bail bondsman, put up the house as collateral.
well, there is the restaurant.
I guess I have no other choice.
but again, this is all in the strictest confidence.
remember, you are my lawyer, not Tom's.
actually, Lynette, I'm-- - shut up!
so you see, it belonged to my husband's grandfather,
and if I don't get it back, I am telling you, I'm gonna be in the crapper.
what does that mean?
means "no way." I'm sorry.
Oh, please. This is important.
what? What's he saying?
he'd like to watch you dance... - What?
on the table.
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna have to call a big, fat... On that one.
Hi, Lynette.
so sorry about Porter.
if there's anything that we can do...
well, actually, I wanted to borrow Edie's yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment.
Yeah. Sorry. Edie's not here.
well, is it okay if I go up and get it?
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead. - Thanks.
please. You have to leave.
this isn't a good time, okay?
fine. I'll--I'll come see you tomorrow.
just know that I still love you, and that'll never change.
never change.
well, let me start by saying, it's so nice to see you in a social setting, Dr. Cominis.
Oh, please. I insist you call me Alex now.
all right then, Alex.
Oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart. Scootch over.
uh, mom, w-we--we don't need to scootch.
well, I just want you to know, if you need to scootch, Alex, I am okay with scootching and...the rest of it.
uh, look, mom, as much as we appreciate your tolerance, uh, we can wait until we get home to make out.
well, I just want you boys to know that I am comfortable with your lifestyle.
now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?
are--are you expecting someone?
well, Orson and I thought it would be nice to share this special occasion with some dear friends.
Bob and Lee? What, are you sponsoring a float?
Bree, you handle the introductions, and I will check on dinner.
Bob Hunter, Lee Mcdermott, I would like you to meet Andrew's new life partner, Dr. Alex Cominis.
a doctor. - He's a plastic surgeon.
you hear that, Bob? I like my eyes the way they are.
you're so touchy.
have we met? - Not that I recall.
no, we have. I-I can't think where, though.
I hear the gym is a popular meeting place.
no, it's not that.
my mistake. I must--I must have you confused with someone else.
dinner's ready. Shall we?
not so fast. Do you know that guy? - Yes.
Oh, my god. You're right. It is him.
Carlos, what's wrong?
Gaby, I can see them. - What?
I can make out colors and shapes.
everything's starting to come into focus.
Oh, my god. That's wonderful!
look at all my girls.
Oh, you're right. She does look like mama. - Oh, I told you.
daddy, ow you can watch me dance. - I know. I can't wait.
Oh, it's amazing. I can make out almost everything the fireplace, our dining table.
Where's the painting that we bought in Greece?
I had to sell it a few months ago so I could make the mortgage. I'm sorry.
I don't care about things. I can see my family. That's what's important.
Really? That makes me feel so much better.
you wouldn't believe all the stupid things I've been worried about.
like what?
Oh, it's silly. I sold that baseball of yours.
but you're right. You can see, and that's all that matters.
you sold my Lou Gehrig baseball?
Yeah, but it's just a thing.
we don't care about things. - Right, right.
but it was my father's and his father's before him.
Yeah, and I know that now, but...
Juanita, dance for your dad.
Juanita, actually, why don't you take your sister and, uh, go to the kitchen and get some cookies?
I'll be there in a minute.
this is a very special day for all of us, so I'm not gonna get mad.
uh, I'm just gonna say that I don't know what was going through that featherhead of yours,
but I want that baseball back.
got it?
Hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years.
you have no idea what I had to do to keep this roof over our heads.
look, there were two things that I asked you not to sell-- my baseball and my watch.
I didn't sell your watch.
only because you couldn't get it off my wrist, you little thief.
Gaby, you lied.
I want that baseball back, and you're gonna get it.
and you might want to lower the middle finger.
I can see now, remember?
right. Damn.
Bree, that was hands-down the best dinner I've ever had in my life.
you are so sweet.
you know, Bree is the number one caterer in Fairview.
Oh, that's right.
do you do weddings?
I wasn't gonna say anything.
say anything about what?
uh, nothing.
nothing.
we're gonna have to tell them sometime.
Oh, my goodness, are you two...
Yes, yes. We're...We're getting married.
and I hate you.
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.
Oh, my God.
see how excited they are?
why would you wanna keep it a secret?
I am gonna handle everything for this wedding.
that's why.
now let me give my new son-in-law a hug.
butt out.
well, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get a pie that you are going to love.
and you two are going to help me.
all right, you two, what is going on?
what are you talking about?
don't give me that.
you've been whispering to each other all night.
you obviously know Alex.
how?
it's not important.
the man is going to marry my son.
if there is something about him I should know, I want to hear it now, please.
we think we saw him in...an adult movie.
by "adult," you mean complex and sophisticated?
no, we mean gay porn.
what?
we saw this movie, "rear deployment."
all the actors played soldiers.
Bob likes uniforms, so...
Oh, thank you.
no, no, no. This can't possibly be true.
the man is a doctor.
are you sure?
well, we might be wrong.
no.
we rented it last month.
we paid the late charges.
trust me. That's him.
guarantee if it's gonna break after four months.
or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months as most people do in a lifetime.
ever think of that?
your mommy lashes out at people prettier than she is.
you ever notice that?
Hey, Katherine.
what a cute top.
so, uh, where you guys off to?
bowling.
come on, buddy. Let's get your jacket.
by the way, uh, I don't think you're gonna have any problem.
I had a little talk with M.J.
sure you did.
what is that supposed to mean?
it means things will be a lot easier with M.J., if you weren't talking trash about me and mike dating.
what?
I don't do that.
Really?
M.J. always liked me before, and then I start seeing Mike, and suddenly, I'm taking incoming rocky road.
all right. Let's go knock over some pins.
see you, ladies.
Bye.
what?
I have never said a negative word about them dating ever.
I believe you.
it's just-- you don't have to say anything.
it's the way you act when she's around.
kids pick up on that stuff.
what do you mean, the way I act?
Oh, Katherine, what a cute top.
kid translation-- "have a nice time at the bowling alley with my ex, whore."
okay.
it-it's a little uncomfortable, is whole situation.
I mean, if M.J.'s picking up on it, how am I supposed to fix that?
well, I didn't say anything about fixing it.
two of my friends involved in a nasty catfight...
I live for that stuff.
thanks for the corkscrew.
there you go, eetie.
is that tight enough?
I guess.
what is going on?
why were you on the phone so long?
um, Susan's coming.
what? Why?
well, she wants M.J.to see us all having a good time together.
that way, he might be more accepting of you and me.
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.
well, I think it's a good idea.
she feels like she's been sending the wrong signals, and she wants to make up for it.
well, it's nice of her to try, but just how much of a show was she planning to put on for
Hey, everybody!
are we ready to have the best time ever?
don't fall down, okay?
I'm not carrying you home.
I'm fine.
stop worrying.
look who just got bailed out.
you got a lot of balls, kid.
you nail my wife, you break up my family, you burn down my business.
I didn't burn down your club.
and you can accuse me all you want, but I'm not going to jail.
if I were you, I'd want to go there.
it's a hell of a lot safer.
otherwise, someday, you'll be walking home from school or work or your buddy's house, and you'll just...disappear.
poof!
and if they ask me about it, you know what I'm gonna tell 'em?
I was at the movies.
enjoy your freedom.
um, so right down the middle... - Okay.
no gutter balls. - Right.
they're getting along great, huh?
you're welcome.
I admit it. You being here does seem to be helping.
you're welcome.
okay, let it go.
God, look at him.
remember when he needed one of those little kiddie balls the size of a cantaloupe?
he's getting so big.
I know.
you know, that colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore.
no. God.
I'm gonna try it.
how did that little peewee we brought back from the hospital turn into this bruiser?
Mike, I need you.
I got another split.
what did I say about aiming the ball?
I don't remember.
come show me.
um, be right there.
hey there.
do you have a second?
now where did you get that?
a video store I will never return to.
are you aware that one of the stars of this film is
Yes. I know about Alex's movie, mom.
you do?
Yeah. He told me a long time ago.
he calls it the biggest mistake he's ever made.
why would he
well, he couldn't afford the tuition to med school, and he was approached by this so-called director, and well, he...
anyway, I would appreciate it if you didn't let on that you know.
and you're okay with this?
Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, we both know that I have sort of an interesting past myself.
not to mention the fact that i-i love him...very much.
So...He's the one?
Yes, mom.
even with his sordid past, he's the one.
why did you bring this here?
you're going to marry him.
I thought he wasn't being honest with you.
I wanted to protect you, so I-- so you decided to meddle in my love life?
Yes.
you know what, mom?
this might be about the nicest thing you've ever done for me.
come here.
I mean, not every boy can say that his mother's willing to rent gay porn for them.
Yes. Which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3: 00. Could you?
Absolutely.
uh, you gotta avoid those late fees.
Oh, you know, um, you know, I can have Alex autograph this for you if you want.
just take it back.
Oh, Mrs. Solis, may I help you with something?
get your boss.
there.
you got it back.
why are you limping?
fell off a table.
don't want to talk about it.
what took you so long?
I just wanted to coach Porter a little bit before the arraignment.
what's he doing?
he needed some time to himself.
I'll meet you inside.
you might want to give him a moment.
I think he's pretty nervous.
that's because he's Preston.
what? Oh, crap!
Hey, mom, dad.
Hey, Preston.
Aw, you know?
of course we know.
what the hell is going on?
Where's Porter?
he took off.
what?
he was scared out of his mind.
he didn't know what to do, so he left town and asked me if I'd help him give him a head start.
do you have any idea how bad this is?
we had to post bail.
if the judge finds out Porter skipped town, we're gonna lose...a lot.
guys.
guys, they're calling us.
well, you know what?
he's gonna find out right now, because you are not going in there.
I'd rather forfeit the bail than risk having two of my kids go to jail.
Tom-- no, Bob will just tell the judge what happened.
we'll take the hit and we'll go forward. It's just money.
it's not just money.
what are you talking about?
Hey. Come on.
we're up.
okay, look...
you know how you're always saying I know what to do in a crisis?
Yeah. Here's what we're gonna do.
you--no questions.
you--you're Porter now.
let's go in.
come on. Come on.
you like it?
it's beautiful.
Where'd it come from?
I bought it today. It's yours.
what?
we can't afford this.
I sold the baseball.
you never told me things had gotten so bad.
you were blind and depressed.
I didn't wanna add to it.
thank you for taking such good care of us.
I plan on spending the rest of my life making it up to you.
first thing tomorrow I'm selling my watch so I can buy you some new shoes to go with that dress.
you should know that watch is a knockoff.
I sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.
so how is Katherine's foot?
well, she's kinda got a psychedelic toenail, but she'll be fine...
which doesn't excuse what you did, mister.
what's going on?
sweetie, if you're worried that I don't like your daddy spending time with Katherine, don't be.
I think it's great.
but they can't be together.
why not?
cause you and mommy are getting back together.
what?
that's what mommy said.
Hey, I've got an idea.
why don't you go make a get well card for Katherine's foot?
okay. - Okay.
I can totally explain this. I swear.
I'm listening.
it was--I don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out.
it was bedtime.
I was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you.
and he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were ever coming back, and so I finally...said maybe you would.
I just didn't want him to be so sad.
Oh, Susan.
I didn't even think he'd remembered it.
of course he remembers it.
how could you say that to him?
because we have never said it.
what?
we've never looked each other in the eye and said that there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
o-okay.
maybe we haven't, but we moved on.
did we?
Susan, what are you doing?
you're with Jackson now.
I'm with Katherine.
what are you doing?
I don't know.
I...
you don't ever think about it?
I've gotta go check on Katherine.
it's an awful thing to live in darkness, unable to see what others take for granted.
but if we are lucky, the darkness lifts and we can finally see the secret sacrifices made by our wives...
the surprising progress made by our mothers...
or the unintended consequences of our own actions.
but there are those who prefer the darkness, because there, they see only what they choose to see.
I know it must seem like I've forgotten aut you, but you have to know, I think about you every day.
I live for you, just like always.
but I have a plan, so I hope you can wait a little longer.
I'll be with you soon, but first Mike Delfino has to pay for taking you away from me, and I need just the right moment to do it.
he destroyed what I loved the most, and I want him to feel that hurt.
I want him to lose what I lost.
Dave got caught.
you changed your name and you're living in Fairview.
it's not healthy or safe.
Gaby got leverage.
I'm getting that bonus after all.
so, Brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?
Katherine dropped a bomb.
Mike's moving in here. - What?
Tom called it quits.
if we're gonna sell this place, we should probably know exactly how much it's worth.
and Bree got honest...
you're paid based on your contribution.
you're saying I'm worthless.
no, I'm just saying you're worth... less.
which resulted in some strange behavior.
everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
he greeted his neighbors each day with a sunny...
good morning.
he opened doors for young women with a gallant...
allow me.
if he bumped into a stranger on the street...
he'd cheerfully say... - I beg your pardon.
and if one of his friends was having a hard time, Orson was the first to say...
you need some help there?
whether his friend wanted his help or not.
Orson. What are you doing here?
well, I heard about your going out of business sale, and I thought you could use a hand.
I'm good. Thanks.
this is charming.
Oh, it's a salt shaker my grandfather gave me used to display it on the shelf.
how much you want for it?
it's not for sale.
everything in that box is stuff I'm taking with me.
okay. Just trying to help out.
I know it's a difficult day, and I think I, of all people,
understand what it is you're going through.
why you "of all people"?
well, I know what it's like to have your livelihood suddenly vanish.
remember, I used to be a dentist.
right. Right.
of course, it's not really the same, is it?
what's not?
my business started going sout because of a bad economy.
it got worse when my son was accused of a crime that he didn't commit,
but you lost your license because you went to prison for a crime you did commit.
why are you being this way?
because what's happening to me is unfair.
what happened to you was...
justice?
Yeah, and to compare my situation with yours, on a day like this,
well, I gotta tell you, it's a little insulting.
then I apologize.
my intention was never to insult you.
I wanted to support you in your... in your hour of need.
um, vultures are starting to arrive.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Yes, everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
what they didn't know is that he also believed in punishing those who weren't.
the day after Mike Delfino moved in with Katherine Mayfair,
she thought it would be nice to share her happiness,
so she decided to throw a housewarming party for her friends and neighbors.
but from the moment the first invitation was delivered,
her friends began making assumptions about those who had been invited...
and about those who hadn't.
I know it's late notice, but I do hope you'll all be able to make it.
now does this really mean no gifts, or is it like when Gaby says "no gifts" and she means no cheap gifts?
you know, Katherine, if you need any help, I would be happy to make my fam
Hey, guys. What are we talking about?
the federal deficit.
that sucker's big!
actually, Susan, we were talking about my housewarming party.
Oh, yeah. I'm so excited. You got my RSVP right?
Yes. I'm so glad you're coming.
Oh, um, by the way, can you bring your blue punch bowl?
Absolutely. Anything else you need?
what's happening here?
why isn't hair being pulled?
why would we do that?
um, let's see. She's shacking up with your ex?
something which, when I do it, I get an angry mob on my front lawn.
I mean, let's be honest, Susan.
you weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together.
well, yes, I was upset at first.
but, you know, Mike was gonna be with someone eventually,
and I consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend.
Susan, that's very sweet.
and admirable.
and abnormal.
Hey, Gaby, remember when I was with Carlos?
shut it, bitch.
see? That's normal.
I'll give you $6, 000 for it.
what? It's a $12, 000 oven.
there's a dent in the door.
not a dent. A fist print.
my husband's been a little frustrated lately.
on the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher.
$6, 200... take it or leave it.
fine. Congratulations. You just stole a pizza oven.
I got $6, 200 for the oven. - What? That guy is ripping us off.
Yeah, well, putting an "everything must go" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position.
how are we doing on the other stuff?
well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors,
give Bree back the $20, 000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for...
45 minutes.
forget I asked.
I don't want to talk about it now. Just...
look, I know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be.
I told you, I'm gonna get a job.
and that is so great.
so when do you think that great thing might happen?
Lynette, don't. It's taken everything I got not to lose it right now.
sorry.
you honestly think you're gonna get $200 for that cappuccino machine?
I'll give you $50.
50 bucks? Are you
I think you better stop with the bargain hunting
unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
Hey, guys!
what the hell are they doing here?
they had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled.
we're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours.
good idea, Gaby. We're helping the slimeball cheat on his wife.
why not babysit for him, too?
Oh, you guys are angels for doing this.
well, what are friends for?
speaking of which, thanks for hooking Brad up with his new girl.
uh, Shayla, right?
you know, that hairstylist you recommended
uh, I was at the mall making an appointment, and Maria walked by.
Oh, that Shayla.
how many Shaylas do you know?
two. Two. There's, uh, Shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other Shayla I know who's a home-wrecking whore.
Hey, Carlos. Uh, why don't you take, uh, Maria and the kids inside and introduce them to the girls?
come on in. - All right. Let's go.
you're using me as an alibi now?
I paid you 30 grand. I want my money's worth.
and by the way, your tennis game with Maria tomorrow... you need to move it to noon.
Why? So you can go get another "haircut"?
Shayla's got a couple hours off, and I want to spend 'em with her.
well, Bradley, we all want things.
for instance, I would like Carlos to have a week off next month.
impossible. It's our busiest time.
come on, Brad. We don't want to be late.
Oh, Gaby, we're still on for tennis tomorrow, right? 4: 00?
4: 00? Let me think.
actually, noon would be better for me. Could you do noon?
Oh, I was supposed to have lunch with Brad. Do you mind, sweetie?
well, I was really looking forward to it, but, uh... Go ahead. You girls have fun.
listen to him. Can you believe this guy?
Nope. He is not to be believed.
my, what an interesting coat hanger. It's shaped like a sofa.
please put it in the closet.
sorry, darling.
why do you have a salt shaker from Scavo's pizzeria?
I stopped by to express my sympathies with Tom, and I... I remember I... looking at it,
and I... I guess I absentmindedly put it in my pocket.
well, take it back now. They're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get.
never mind. I want to stay here with you.
me don't like the Scavos so much.
no? - No.
very well. Though I'm not looking forward to going down there again.
Really?
Yes. I only went down there to commiserate, and he was very dismissive.
Tom has a lot on his mind. I'm sure he didn't mean it.
you weren't there, Bree. He was downright rude.
you know, it would serve him right if I kept this.
don't be ridiculous.
Tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal.
return it immediately.
ma, you... you such a pretty girl.
I wanna live here with you.
Oh, great. You found the punch bowl.
washed, cleaned, ready to go.
sorry about the mess. Mike's still unpacking.
Hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?
Yeah. That went right to the garage.
the tough one was the framed towel with some football guy's sweat on it.
that "football guy" is Peyton Manning.
you would do well to learn that name.
Oh, now that I really love.
I almost couldn't believe he had something that nice. - Thank you.
for what? - I painted it. It was a gift for him.
Really?
you painted that. He didn't mention it.
Yeah. It was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon.
uh, I mean, you know how much Mike loves the ocean.
Yeah. Now I can see it every day.
anyway, um, can't wait for the party. It's gonna be fun.
Yep.
I'm sorry you have to go through this. It must be so hard.
the hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan,
and I thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car.
now that you brought it up, Lynette, I've been feeling just awful about the way
I took over your restaurant and insulted you and...
what can I say?
I think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything.
let's just hug and move on.
okay?
how's Tom holding up?
he's doing great.
isn't it noon?
Yeah. He's up early today.
he just doesn't know what he's doing next.
maybe I can help. My publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone.
Seriously? - Yeah.
Oh, my god. That would be great.
and if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check.
I tell you what. I will invite Bruce over for dinner, you and Tom can join us,
and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview.
thank you. This will really cheer Tom up.
great. I'll call Bruce this afternoon.
could you call him now?
Hey, Mike.
Oh, I'm looking forward to one of your world-famous martinis.
so was Mrs. Mccluskey. She got here early.
Yeah, but don't panic. I sent Edie out for more booze.
so you sent the mouse to buy the cheese. Well done.
well, look who's here.
somebody owes me $20.
how about we let it ride?
double or nothing... Mccluskey slugs someone by 5: 00.
Katherine and I told you guys we were taking the high road.
why won't you believe us?
because I vividly remember yesterday, and I wasn't born during it.
let me show you something I think might change your mind.
so Katherine has a picture that I painted for Mike hanging over her mantelpiece.
does she know you painted it?
Yes, and we talked all about it. She loves it.
you painted that? You're good.
what? Where the hell is it?
Bye-bye, high road.
what's with the puss?
Katherine hung one of Mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out Susan painted it.
then she took it down.
something tells me this party's about to get good.
you know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation.
Hey, Kathy. What happened to Susan's painting?
I am such a klutz.
I was dusting yesterday, and, well, it just fell.
the glass shattered, and ugh. It took it to the framer. It'll be back in a jiffy.
excuse me.
see a perfectly innocent...
bald-faced lie.
it is possible.
I just drained a pitcher of martinis. I'm not buying it.
really, Susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what "I broke it dusting" means.
that's how I got rid of Tom's last bottle of "musk, the cologne for men."
all right, you guys think what you want.
I'm gonna choose to believe her.
all right, so we have whiskey and bourbon. What else does Mike want?
bup, bup, bup. We need a system.
let's start over there in Scotland, head over to Russia and work our way aroud the the globe.
it's crowded in here.
they're all buying lottery tickets. The jackpot's $100 million.
look. There's a priest.
I knew that vow of poverty was a crock.
Hello!
you remember me. Father Drance.
I... I didn't know you'd moved back to the area.
Oh, I just remembered. Mike wants vermouth. Can you grab that before we forget?
sure. Right away.
it's wonderful to see yo looking so well.
shut up.
I'm only gonna say this once. I've moved on.
I've remarried, I have a new life, and that's the way I want it to stay new.
of course.
so, uh, what was that about?
he said we sat together once on a airplane.
apparently he's less memorable than he thinks he is.
come on. Don't want to miss the party.
fine. Fine.
I will do it, but you owe me. I gotta go.
let me guess. Brad.
Yes, he wants me to take Maria shopping tomorrow.
Yeah, so he can grab a quickie.
you know, this whole thing is disgusting. I can't take it anymore.
I know. Just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too.
things I don't want. Things I haven't earned.
no, I'm gonna tell Bradley we're out.
what? You can't do that.
you'll lose your job and all that money.
I don't care about the money.
I do... and so does my personal shopper and pilates instructor.
Gaby, no. We're doing the right thing.
or we can...
make someone else do the right thing.
Gaby, what does that mean?
it means...
tomorrow I'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
uh, look at what I found... my beach painting.
Oh, yeah. Katherine told me it broke. Sorry about that.
Yeah, that's what she told me, too, honestly, uh, it didn't.
that's weird. Why would she... - I don't owow.
she seemed to love the painting...
until I told her that I painted it.
excuse me just a minute.
I'm not making a big deal.
I just want to know why you lied.
Mike, please, not now. We have a house full of guests.
no, we'll talk about this now.
what are you doing?
uh, nothing.
Susan showed me the painting. There's not a scratch on it.
she what?
you didn't.
I hope you enjoyed that.
I didn't.
I didn't.
so what are we thinking?
well, Shayla, it is Shayla, right?
I need a fresh look.
I've been going through some pretty intense pepersonal stuff lately.
Really?
fine. I'll tell you.
I have been having an affair with a married man,
and it's come to that point where I can't even look at myself in the mirror.
so I want a new style that says I'm not a giant turd of sin.
well, it's not your fault that you fell in love with a married man.
Yeah, that's what I thought at first, and then I realized that's stupid.
I mean, what about his poor wife?
well, maybe she doesn't love him enough.
Oh, no. She does. She loves him plenty.
so you want to take the bangs up a little bit?
and he has kids... two adorable little kids.
that's sad, but sometimes you just have to look out for yourself.
well, maybe I am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch.
have you ever considered, uh, highlights?
focus, Shayla!
we are talking about how I'm ruining innocent people's lives.
Gaby, you seem like a lovely, warm person.
stop beating yourself up.
Oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit.
I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you and Bradley.
what? What... what is this? Who... who are you?
I'm a friend of Maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person.
well, maybe she is, but Brad doesn't love her.
he says he's gonna leave her.
Oh, Shayla, he's lying. She's pregnant.
that's impossible. They haven't had sex in over a year.
well, call the vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay.
get out.
I'm just trying to protect you here.
I said get out now.
okay, let's just take a deep breath here, let's not do anything we're gonna regret.
now.
this is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
you couldn't shave?
come on, Tom.
you need to look nice.
Bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner.
what, is she debuting a new salmon puff?
okay.
I was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood,
but I realize that's not gonna happen, so Bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher...
and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive.
Oh, my god.
what are you... are you tricking me into a job interview?
I'll find something, okay?
I just need some time.
you're grieving.
I get it.
but this sounds like a fantastic job.
please just hear the guy out and make a nice...
impression.
fine.
I'll shave.
and brush your teeth.
my eyes are watering.
and don't just wet the toothbrush.
I can tell.
hello.
come on in.
thank you so much for joining us tonight.
may I take your coat?
sure.
Oh, wait. Let me get my "brain" out of there.
I never go anywhere without this.
that way, when I get a bright idea
right into the tape recorder.
sounds like quite a handy gizmo.
thank you, Orville.
it's Orson.
Orville, Orson... either way, he came home from the playground covered in bruises.
am I right?
idea for children's book... kid who gets the crap kicked out of him 'cause he has a goofy name.
could be "Orson."
Oh, that's them.
wait till you meet Tom.
you'll be so glad you had that tape recorder.
he's just bursting with ideas.
Lynette, Tom, hi.
I'd like you to meet my publisher, Bruce.
it's nice to meet you.
Bree, I'm getting a beer, if you don't mind.
Hey, Katherine.
Mike is standing across the street watching to make sure I apologize,
even though it's clear to me you're the one who should be apologizing for the way you ruined my party.
one, two, three.
well, that should be long enough, so here.
kiss my ass.
Bye.
hold on.
I'm sorry.
but neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
it's not the same.
why not?
I mean, you loved that painting until you found out that I did it, and then you acted totally petty.
so why am I the only bad guy here?
let me ask you something, okay?
didn't it give you just the tiniest little thrill to tell me that that painting that I was so happy about was yours?
that I had something in my house that represented the love between you and Mike?
no.
then what are you doing, Susan?
can't you see how hard this is for me?
you live right across the street.
you guys share a kid.
do I have to have a painting of your honeymoon, too?
look, I knew I wasn't going to get a clean slate with Mike, okay?
I just wanted a clean mantelpiece.
fantastic dinner, Bree.
this was a great idea.
well, I just wanted to get you together with Tom here.
I thought you two might hit it off.
Yeah.
Tom, Bree says you used to be quite the ad wiz.
Oh, I don't know.
he's being modest. He was the best.
good, because I'm looking for someone to head up a new division.
I'm going to put some coffee on.
Orson, would you give me a hand?
let these three chat.
so do you think you have any interest in getting back in the game?
I don't know.
the timing's a little weird.
how so?
I don't know.
well, Tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome pritit.
so he's waiting for the right opportunity.
you might have to do a little selling here, Bruce.
I guess the good ones are always the hardest to land.
yeah let me give it a shot.
we represent a small stable of elite nonfiction authors from all over the world.
so you'd be working closely with those writers to come up with creative approaches to selling their books.
that sounds... amazing.
I don't know.
are there more potatoes?
you can have mine.
stop saying,"I don't know."
sounds like there's a lot of traveling.
I'm not, you know, really big on living out of a suitcase.
even to do two weeks at the book fair in Paris while you stay at a five-star hotel?
Paris?
like France?
Yes, like the greatest city in the world.
Geeze, I'm getting Lynette excited.
too bad you don't have any advertising experience.
actually, I have 12 years of experience.
Really?
Yeah.
I was account executive for eight years, V.P. for four more after that,
and by the way, I wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel.
I know.
so what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
Lynette, can I see you for a second?
okay.
Bruce, could you hold that thought?
I'm gonna be right back.
well, we're on pins and needles.
how's it going?
what the hell are you doing?
I'm getting this job.
that's what I'm doing.
I thought it was my job.
well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister...
uh, I don't know. Are there any more potatoes?
it's not that I don't want it.
it's just that it's all happening so fast.
I need a little time to lick my wounds.
okay, you lick.
I'm going to Paris.
you're not taking my job.
your job?
the one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat?
you had a shot.
you blew it.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
you just messed with the bull, sister.
prepare to get the horns.
I...
maybe we should slice the tart in here.
I don't want to bring a large knife in this.
I was just saying to Lynette, I gave you my "I don't really care about this job" thing to see
if you really care about this job, and you do, and I like that.
clever.
now we haven't talked compensation package yet, but I got a good feeling...
you know, Tom, you're right.
Bruce does care about this job.
that's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it.
well, Lynette, you yourself said I was the best.
Oh, you were.
you were the best person who ever worked for me.
I used to be his boss.
this is not what I had in mind.
I don't know why either one of them wants to work for that jackass.
now, now. He's been very good to me.
well, of course he has, because he knows you make him a lot of money.
me, on the other hand, he sees a an insignificant little man,
barely worth mentioning as he talks into his annoying, penis-shaped tape recorder.
great story...
I assume.
I don't speak another language, but I've had ad campaigns translated into 12 different ones,
including professor crispy's potato chips.
I love that campaign.
you did that?
I did.
Yes.
Tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired.
well, actually, I was relieved to get fired.
my boss was kind of a ballbuster.
she's right here.
je regrette.
would anyone care for something sweet?
I know I would.
well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, Tom?
I was sort of sugarcoating it when I said his restaurant was very successful.
the truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground.
let me be very clear.
I think Lynette is fantastic.
she is a great manager, she's got terrific people skills and is very reliable...
as long as the cancer doesn't flare up again.
you know what?
it's getting late.
I should probably head the road - but what about the job?
yeah...
I just started looking.
I'm sure it's gonna be a long process, but trust me, you've certainly made an impression.
I'll get your coat.
Oh, it's a shame you can't stay for dessert.
I've made tarte tatin.
idea for novel...
woman who's married to a gay man and doesn't know it.
well, thanks again.
I don't know when I've had such an interesting evening.
I'll call you tomorrow.
we'll talk about your friends.
uh, Bruce, why don't I wrap up a piece of that tart to go?
Yeah.
give it.
give what?
Bruce's tape recorder.
I don't know what...
you took it. I saw you.
has anybody seen my tape recorder?
it was right here.
I " ll look.
stop.
I don't have it.
what do you call this?
uh, Bruce is looking for, uh...
never mind.
we will talk about this later.
look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
Thanks.
Hello, Gaby.
jeez, Bradley, you scared me!
you talked to Shayla.
Yeah, she's a real gem.
you shouldn't have done that.
we have a deal.
well, I'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to Maria is despicable.
you're in no position to judge me.
don't forget, I was working with Carlos when you cheated on him.
Yeah, well, I'm not that person anymore.
I've changed.
right.
you're worse.
you're so worried about Maria until there's money or vacation time at stake.
then you're only worried about Gaby.
you know what?
you're right.
I'm out.
what do you mean?
deal's over.
I'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
it's not a fling.
I love her.
she's the most incredible woman I've ever met.
she has a hello kitty jar.
well, she makes me happy.
I can't give her up.
well, at least be man enough to tell Maria, because if you don't, I will.
all right, fine.
I will tell Maria.
and you can tell Carlos to bring a box to work on Monday 'cause he's fired.
so dinner...
Lynette, I will regret for the rest of my life what I said tonight.
I...
I don't know what's going on with me.
I do, and it's okay.
besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth?
like I said...
wouldn't you love to hear what Bruce said into his tape recorder on the ride home?
idea...
check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
so...
were you serious about wanting to go back to work?
I was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince Bruce I was good, and I remembered something.
I am good.
and I would like another chance to prove it.
okay.
Really?
Yeah.
we did my thing for seven years.
now it's your turn.
do you know how embarrassed I would have been if Bruce had seen you take it?
he deserved it.
he insulted me.
so say something.
stand up to him.
but stealing?
honestly, Orson, why would you do something like that?
I don't know, Bree.
I don't.
here's something I do know...
when I was a successful dentist, no one spoke to me the way they do now.
when I lost my practice, I lost people's respect.
and you hope to earn it back through larceny?
you haven't walked in my shoes.
Tom lost his job.
everyone jumped to his rescue.
even you...
bending over backwards trying to get him a job.
I don't need to walk in your shoes, Orson.
what youidid was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again.
understood?
see you. Thank you.
father?
Yes. Can I help you?
Oh, I hope so.
I, uh, saw you the other night when you were buying your lottery ticket.
I was with my husband Dave. - Yes.
he said that you barely know each other, but it didn't seem that way to me.
and, well, he refuses to talk about his past,
so if there is anything that you could tell me about him...
I'm not sure I can do that.
please.
he has so many secrets, and I don't have anyone else to turn to.
I wish I could help you, but...
this is something you need to discuss with your husband.
well, if it was that easy, do you think that I would be here?
I'm sorry.
please know that my thoughts are with you both, Mrs. Dash.
it's Williams.
I'm too old-school for my own good.
I shouldn't just assume that you took your husband's name.
anyway...
good luck, Mrs. Williams.
Hey, Susan.
I thought I had M.J. till 7:00.
uh, you do.
I am here to take my painting back.
but you gave it to me. It's mine.
well, now I'm ungiving it.
try to keep up.
okay, if this is about what happened at the housewarming...
it is actually, because that is when I decided that I don't want this piece of art that I slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend.
that I slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend.
Capisce?
okay, so the other night you were mad because it wasn't hanging up, but now you want to take it?
Yep. I'm complicated like that.
aren't you glad you divorced me?
if you two want a painting so bad, paint your own.
stay out of this.
this is between me and my ex.
got it?
unbelievable.
anyway, I'm thinking a brighter color for the baby's room.
now I know it's a bit of a stretch, but how do you feel about turquoise?
sweetheart?
we need to talk.
what you reading?
the want ads.
can't decide if I should be a data entry operator or join the marines.
I'm so sorry.
don't be.
I told you, I hated working for that jackass.
you did the right thing.
I should have done it sooner.
but you did it, even though you knew you were gonna lose a lot of money.
you're a good person, babe.
I'm very proud of you.
well, that means a lot, coming from a united states marine.
Hello?
calm down.
calm down.
okay, we're coming over.
I guess Bradley told her.
thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.
it's horrible.
he just kept telling me he loves her.
she's the best thing that ever happened to him.
he finally understands what love means.
I just wanted him to stop talking.
you should never be too impressed by people with good manners.
they're the ones who will give a friendly wave even when they've stolen from you...
they're the type to sweetly welcome you even as they try to uncover your secrets
they're the kind to offer you coffee, even as they report you to the police.
and don't be too offended by someone who's openly rude...
because they may be that way
Dave got caught.
you changed your name and you're living in Fairview.
it's not healthy or safe.
Gaby got leverage.
I'm getting that bonus after all.
so, Brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?
Katherine dropped a bomb.
Mike's moving in here. - What?
Tom called it quits.
if we're gonna sell this place, we should probably know exactly how much it's worth.
and Bree got honest...
you're paid based on your contribution.
you're saying I'm worthless.
no, I'm just saying you're worth... less.
which resulted in some strange behavior.
everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
he greeted his neighbors each day with a sunny...
good morning.
he opened doors for young women with a gallant...
allow me.
if he bumped into a stranger on the street...
he'd cheerfully say... - I beg your pardon.
and if one of his friends was having a hard time, Orson was the first to say...
you need some help there?
whether his friend wanted his help or not.
Orson. What are you doing here?
well, I heard about your going out of business sale, and I thought you could use a hand.
I'm good. Thanks.
this is charming.
Oh, it's a salt shaker my grandfather gave me used to display it on the shelf.
how much you want for it?
it's not for sale.
everything in that box is stuff I'm taking with me.
okay. Just trying to help out.
I know it's a difficult day, and I think I, of all people,
understand what it is you're going through.
why you "of all people"?
well, I know what it's like to have your livelihood suddenly vanish.
remember, I used to be a dentist.
right. Right.
of course, it's not really the same, is it?
what's not?
my business started going sout because of a bad economy.
it got worse when my son was accused of a crime that he didn't commit,
but you lost your license because you went to prison for a crime you did commit.
why are you being this way?
because what's happening to me is unfair.
what happened to you was...
justice?
Yeah, and to compare my situation with yours, on a day like this,
well, I gotta tell you, it's a little insulting.
then I apologize.
my intention was never to insult you.
I wanted to support you in your... in your hour of need.
um, vultures are starting to arrive.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Yes, everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
what they didn't know is that he also believed in punishing those who weren't.
the day after Mike Delfino moved in with Katherine Mayfair,
she thought it would be nice to share her happiness,
so she decided to throw a housewarming party for her friends and neighbors.
but from the moment the first invitation was delivered,
her friends began making assumptions about those who had been invited...
and about those who hadn't.
I know it's late notice, but I do hope you'll all be able to make it.
now does this really mean no gifts, or is it like when Gaby says "no gifts" and she means no cheap gifts?
you know, Katherine, if you need any help, I would be happy to make my fam
Hey, guys. What are we talking about?
the federal deficit.
that sucker's big!
actually, Susan, we were talking about my housewarming party.
Oh, yeah. I'm so excited. You got my RSVP right?
Yes. I'm so glad you're coming.
Oh, um, by the way, can you bring your blue punch bowl?
Absolutely. Anything else you need?
what's happening here?
why isn't hair being pulled?
why would we do that?
um, let's see. She's shacking up with your ex?
something which, when I do it, I get an angry mob on my front lawn.
I mean, let's be honest, Susan.
you weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together.
well, yes, I was upset at first.
but, you know, Mike was gonna be with someone eventually,
and I consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend.
Susan, that's very sweet.
and admirable.
and abnormal.
Hey, Gaby, remember when I was with Carlos?
shut it, bitch.
see? That's normal.
I'll give you $6, 000 for it.
what? It's a $12, 000 oven.
there's a dent in the door.
not a dent. A fist print.
my husband's been a little frustrated lately.
on the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher.
$6, 200... take it or leave it.
fine. Congratulations. You just stole a pizza oven.
I got $6, 200 for the oven. - What? That guy is ripping us off.
Yeah, well, putting an "everything must go" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position.
how are we doing on the other stuff?
well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors,
give Bree back the $20, 000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for...
45 minutes.
forget I asked.
I don't want to talk about it now. Just...
look, I know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be.
I told you, I'm gonna get a job.
and that is so great.
so when do you think that great thing might happen?
Lynette, don't. It's taken everything I got not to lose it right now.
sorry.
you honestly think you're gonna get $200 for that cappuccino machine?
I'll give you $50.
50 bucks? Are you
I think you better stop with the bargain hunting
unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
Hey, guys!
what the hell are they doing here?
they had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled.
we're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours.
good idea, Gaby. We're helping the slimeball cheat on his wife.
why not babysit for him, too?
Oh, you guys are angels for doing this.
well, what are friends for?
speaking of which, thanks for hooking Brad up with his new girl.
uh, Shayla, right?
you know, that hairstylist you recommended
uh, I was at the mall making an appointment, and Maria walked by.
Oh, that Shayla.
how many Shaylas do you know?
two. Two. There's, uh, Shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other Shayla I know who's a home-wrecking whore.
Hey, Carlos. Uh, why don't you take, uh, Maria and the kids inside and introduce them to the girls?
come on in. - All right. Let's go.
you're using me as an alibi now?
I paid you 30 grand. I want my money's worth.
and by the way, your tennis game with Maria tomorrow... you need to move it to noon.
Why? So you can go get another "haircut"?
Shayla's got a couple hours off, and I want to spend 'em with her.
well, Bradley, we all want things.
for instance, I would like Carlos to have a week off next month.
impossible. It's our busiest time.
come on, Brad. We don't want to be late.
Oh, Gaby, we're still on for tennis tomorrow, right? 4: 00?
4: 00? Let me think.
actually, noon would be better for me. Could you do noon?
Oh, I was supposed to have lunch with Brad. Do you mind, sweetie?
well, I was really looking forward to it, but, uh... Go ahead. You girls have fun.
listen to him. Can you believe this guy?
Nope. He is not to be believed.
my, what an interesting coat hanger. It's shaped like a sofa.
please put it in the closet.
sorry, darling.
why do you have a salt shaker from Scavo's pizzeria?
I stopped by to express my sympathies with Tom, and I... I remember I... looking at it,
and I... I guess I absentmindedly put it in my pocket.
well, take it back now. They're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get.
never mind. I want to stay here with you.
me don't like the Scavos so much.
no? - No.
very well. Though I'm not looking forward to going down there again.
Really?
Yes. I only went down there to commiserate, and he was very dismissive.
Tom has a lot on his mind. I'm sure he didn't mean it.
you weren't there, Bree. He was downright rude.
you know, it would serve him right if I kept this.
don't be ridiculous.
Tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal.
return it immediately.
ma, you... you such a pretty girl.
I wanna live here with you.
Oh, great. You found the punch bowl.
washed, cleaned, ready to go.
sorry about the mess. Mike's still unpacking.
Hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?
Yeah. That went right to the garage.
the tough one was the framed towel with some football guy's sweat on it.
that "football guy" is Peyton Manning.
you would do well to learn that name.
Oh, now that I really love.
I almost couldn't believe he had something that nice. - Thank you.
for what? - I painted it. It was a gift for him.
Really?
you painted that. He didn't mention it.
Yeah. It was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon.
uh, I mean, you know how much Mike loves the ocean.
Yeah. Now I can see it every day.
anyway, um, can't wait for the party. It's gonna be fun.
Yep.
I'm sorry you have to go through this. It must be so hard.
the hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan,
and I thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car.
now that you brought it up, Lynette, I've been feeling just awful about the way
I took over your restaurant and insulted you and...
what can I say?
I think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything.
let's just hug and move on.
okay?
how's Tom holding up?
he's doing great.
isn't it noon?
Yeah. He's up early today.
he just doesn't know what he's doing next.
maybe I can help. My publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone.
Seriously? - Yeah.
Oh, my god. That would be great.
and if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check.
I tell you what. I will invite Bruce over for dinner, you and Tom can join us,
and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview.
thank you. This will really cheer Tom up.
great. I'll call Bruce this afternoon.
could you call him now?
Hey, Mike.
Oh, I'm looking forward to one of your world-famous martinis.
so was Mrs. Mccluskey. She got here early.
Yeah, but don't panic. I sent Edie out for more booze.
so you sent the mouse to buy the cheese. Well done.
well, look who's here.
somebody owes me $20.
how about we let it ride?
double or nothing... Mccluskey slugs someone by 5: 00.
Katherine and I told you guys we were taking the high road.
why won't you believe us?
because I vividly remember yesterday, and I wasn't born during it.
let me show you something I think might change your mind.
so Katherine has a picture that I painted for Mike hanging over her mantelpiece.
does she know you painted it?
Yes, and we talked all about it. She loves it.
you painted that? You're good.
what? Where the hell is it?
Bye-bye, high road.
what's with the puss?
Katherine hung one of Mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out Susan painted it.
then she took it down.
something tells me this party's about to get good.
you know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation.
Hey, Kathy. What happened to Susan's painting?
I am such a klutz.
I was dusting yesterday, and, well, it just fell.
the glass shattered, and ugh. It took it to the framer. It'll be back in a jiffy.
excuse me.
see a perfectly innocent...
bald-faced lie.
it is possible.
I just drained a pitcher of martinis. I'm not buying it.
really, Susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what "I broke it dusting" means.
that's how I got rid of Tom's last bottle of "musk, the cologne for men."
all right, you guys think what you want.
I'm gonna choose to believe her.
all right, so we have whiskey and bourbon. What else does Mike want?
bup, bup, bup. We need a system.
let's start over there in Scotland, head over to Russia and work our way aroud the the globe.
it's crowded in here.
they're all buying lottery tickets. The jackpot's $100 million.
look. There's a priest.
I knew that vow of poverty was a crock.
Hello!
you remember me. Father Drance.
I... I didn't know you'd moved back to the area.
Oh, I just remembered. Mike wants vermouth. Can you grab that before we forget?
sure. Right away.
it's wonderful to see yo looking so well.
shut up.
I'm only gonna say this once. I've moved on.
I've remarried, I have a new life, and that's the way I want it to stay new.
of course.
so, uh, what was that about?
he said we sat together once on a airplane.
apparently he's less memorable than he thinks he is.
come on. Don't want to miss the party.
fine. Fine.
I will do it, but you owe me. I gotta go.
let me guess. Brad.
Yes, he wants me to take Maria shopping tomorrow.
Yeah, so he can grab a quickie.
you know, this whole thing is disgusting. I can't take it anymore.
I know. Just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too.
things I don't want. Things I haven't earned.
no, I'm gonna tell Bradley we're out.
what? You can't do that.
you'll lose your job and all that money.
I don't care about the money.
I do... and so does my personal shopper and pilates instructor.
Gaby, no. We're doing the right thing.
or we can...
make someone else do the right thing.
Gaby, what does that mean?
it means...
tomorrow I'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
uh, look at what I found... my beach painting.
Oh, yeah. Katherine told me it broke. Sorry about that.
Yeah, that's what she told me, too, honestly, uh, it didn't.
that's weird. Why would she... - I don't owow.
she seemed to love the painting...
until I told her that I painted it.
excuse me just a minute.
I'm not making a big deal.
I just want to know why you lied.
Mike, please, not now. We have a house full of guests.
no, we'll talk about this now.
what are you doing?
uh, nothing.
Susan showed me the painting. There's not a scratch on it.
she what?
you didn't.
I hope you enjoyed that.
I didn't.
I didn't.
so what are we thinking?
well, Shayla, it is Shayla, right?
I need a fresh look.
I've been going through some pretty intense pepersonal stuff lately.
Really?
fine. I'll tell you.
I have been having an affair with a married man,
and it's come to that point where I can't even look at myself in the mirror.
so I want a new style that says I'm not a giant turd of sin.
well, it's not your fault that you fell in love with a married man.
Yeah, that's what I thought at first, and then I realized that's stupid.
I mean, what about his poor wife?
well, maybe she doesn't love him enough.
Oh, no. She does. She loves him plenty.
so you want to take the bangs up a little bit?
and he has kids... two adorable little kids.
that's sad, but sometimes you just have to look out for yourself.
well, maybe I am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch.
have you ever considered, uh, highlights?
focus, Shayla!
we are talking about how I'm ruining innocent people's lives.
Gaby, you seem like a lovely, warm person.
stop beating yourself up.
Oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit.
I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you and Bradley.
what? What... what is this? Who... who are you?
I'm a friend of Maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person.
well, maybe she is, but Brad doesn't love her.
he says he's gonna leave her.
Oh, Shayla, he's lying. She's pregnant.
that's impossible. They haven't had sex in over a year.
well, call the vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay.
get out.
I'm just trying to protect you here.
I said get out now.
okay, let's just take a deep breath here, let's not do anything we're gonna regret.
now.
this is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
you couldn't shave?
come on, Tom.
you need to look nice.
Bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner.
what, is she debuting a new salmon puff?
okay.
I was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood,
but I realize that's not gonna happen, so Bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher...
and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive.
Oh, my god.
what are you... are you tricking me into a job interview?
I'll find something, okay?
I just need some time.
you're grieving.
I get it.
but this sounds like a fantastic job.
please just hear the guy out and make a nice...
impression.
fine.
I'll shave.
and brush your teeth.
my eyes are watering.
and don't just wet the toothbrush.
I can tell.
hello.
come on in.
thank you so much for joining us tonight.
may I take your coat?
sure.
Oh, wait. Let me get my "brain" out of there.
I never go anywhere without this.
that way, when I get a bright idea
right into the tape recorder.
sounds like quite a handy gizmo.
thank you, Orville.
it's Orson.
Orville, Orson... either way, he came home from the playground covered in bruises.
am I right?
idea for children's book... kid who gets the crap kicked out of him 'cause he has a goofy name.
could be "Orson."
Oh, that's them.
wait till you meet Tom.
you'll be so glad you had that tape recorder.
he's just bursting with ideas.
Lynette, Tom, hi.
I'd like you to meet my publisher, Bruce.
it's nice to meet you.
Bree, I'm getting a beer, if you don't mind.
Hey, Katherine.
Mike is standing across the street watching to make sure I apologize,
even though it's clear to me you're the one who should be apologizing for the way you ruined my party.
one, two, three.
well, that should be long enough, so here.
kiss my ass.
Bye.
hold on.
I'm sorry.
but neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
it's not the same.
why not?
I mean, you loved that painting until you found out that I did it, and then you acted totally petty.
so why am I the only bad guy here?
let me ask you something, okay?
didn't it give you just the tiniest little thrill to tell me that that painting that I was so happy about was yours?
that I had something in my house that represented the love between you and Mike?
no.
then what are you doing, Susan?
can't you see how hard this is for me?
you live right across the street.
you guys share a kid.
do I have to have a painting of your honeymoon, too?
look, I knew I wasn't going to get a clean slate with Mike, okay?
I just wanted a clean mantelpiece.
fantastic dinner, Bree.
this was a great idea.
well, I just wanted to get you together with Tom here.
I thought you two might hit it off.
Yeah.
Tom, Bree says you used to be quite the ad wiz.
Oh, I don't know.
he's being modest. He was the best.
good, because I'm looking for someone to head up a new division.
I'm going to put some coffee on.
Orson, would you give me a hand?
let these three chat.
so do you think you have any interest in getting back in the game?
I don't know.
the timing's a little weird.
how so?
I don't know.
well, Tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome pritit.
so he's waiting for the right opportunity.
you might have to do a little selling here, Bruce.
I guess the good ones are always the hardest to land.
yeah let me give it a shot.
we represent a small stable of elite nonfiction authors from all over the world.
so you'd be working closely with those writers to come up with creative approaches to selling their books.
that sounds... amazing.
I don't know.
are there more potatoes?
you can have mine.
stop saying,"I don't know."
sounds like there's a lot of traveling.
I'm not, you know, really big on living out of a suitcase.
even to do two weeks at the book fair in Paris while you stay at a five-star hotel?
Paris?
like France?
Yes, like the greatest city in the world.
Geeze, I'm getting Lynette excited.
too bad you don't have any advertising experience.
actually, I have 12 years of experience.
Really?
Yeah.
I was account executive for eight years, V.P. for four more after that,
and by the way, I wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel.
I know.
so what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
Lynette, can I see you for a second?
okay.
Bruce, could you hold that thought?
I'm gonna be right back.
well, we're on pins and needles.
how's it going?
what the hell are you doing?
I'm getting this job.
that's what I'm doing.
I thought it was my job.
well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister...
uh, I don't know. Are there any more potatoes?
it's not that I don't want it.
it's just that it's all happening so fast.
I need a little time to lick my wounds.
okay, you lick.
I'm going to Paris.
you're not taking my job.
your job?
the one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat?
you had a shot.
you blew it.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
you just messed with the bull, sister.
prepare to get the horns.
I...
maybe we should slice the tart in here.
I don't want to bring a large knife in this.
I was just saying to Lynette, I gave you my "I don't really care about this job" thing to see
if you really care about this job, and you do, and I like that.
clever.
now we haven't talked compensation package yet, but I got a good feeling...
you know, Tom, you're right.
Bruce does care about this job.
that's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it.
well, Lynette, you yourself said I was the best.
Oh, you were.
you were the best person who ever worked for me.
I used to be his boss.
this is not what I had in mind.
I don't know why either one of them wants to work for that jackass.
now, now. He's been very good to me.
well, of course he has, because he knows you make him a lot of money.
me, on the other hand, he sees a an insignificant little man,
barely worth mentioning as he talks into his annoying, penis-shaped tape recorder.
great story...
I assume.
I don't speak another language, but I've had ad campaigns translated into 12 different ones,
including professor crispy's potato chips.
I love that campaign.
you did that?
I did.
Yes.
Tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired.
well, actually, I was relieved to get fired.
my boss was kind of a ballbuster.
she's right here.
je regrette.
would anyone care for something sweet?
I know I would.
well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, Tom?
I was sort of sugarcoating it when I said his restaurant was very successful.
the truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground.
let me be very clear.
I think Lynette is fantastic.
she is a great manager, she's got terrific people skills and is very reliable...
as long as the cancer doesn't flare up again.
you know what?
it's getting late.
I should probably head the road - but what about the job?
yeah...
I just started looking.
I'm sure it's gonna be a long process, but trust me, you've certainly made an impression.
I'll get your coat.
Oh, it's a shame you can't stay for dessert.
I've made tarte tatin.
idea for novel...
woman who's married to a gay man and doesn't know it.
well, thanks again.
I don't know when I've had such an interesting evening.
I'll call you tomorrow.
we'll talk about your friends.
uh, Bruce, why don't I wrap up a piece of that tart to go?
Yeah.
give it.
give what?
Bruce's tape recorder.
I don't know what...
you took it. I saw you.
has anybody seen my tape recorder?
it was right here.
I " ll look.
stop.
I don't have it.
what do you call this?
uh, Bruce is looking for, uh...
never mind.
we will talk about this later.
look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
Thanks.
Hello, Gaby.
jeez, Bradley, you scared me!
you talked to Shayla.
Yeah, she's a real gem.
you shouldn't have done that.
we have a deal.
well, I'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to Maria is despicable.
you're in no position to judge me.
don't forget, I was working with Carlos when you cheated on him.
Yeah, well, I'm not that person anymore.
I've changed.
right.
you're worse.
you're so worried about Maria until there's money or vacation time at stake.
then you're only worried about Gaby.
you know what?
you're right.
I'm out.
what do you mean?
deal's over.
I'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
it's not a fling.
I love her.
she's the most incredible woman I've ever met.
she has a hello kitty jar.
well, she makes me happy.
I can't give her up.
well, at least be man enough to tell Maria, because if you don't, I will.
all right, fine.
I will tell Maria.
and you can tell Carlos to bring a box to work on Monday 'cause he's fired.
so dinner...
Lynette, I will regret for the rest of my life what I said tonight.
I...
I don't know what's going on with me.
I do, and it's okay.
besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth?
like I said...
wouldn't you love to hear what Bruce said into his tape recorder on the ride home?
idea...
check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
so...
were you serious about wanting to go back to work?
I was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince Bruce I was good, and I remembered something.
I am good.
and I would like another chance to prove it.
okay.
Really?
Yeah.
we did my thing for seven years.
now it's your turn.
do you know how embarrassed I would have been if Bruce had seen you take it?
he deserved it.
he insulted me.
so say something.
stand up to him.
but stealing?
honestly, Orson, why would you do something like that?
I don't know, Bree.
I don't.
here's something I do know...
when I was a successful dentist, no one spoke to me the way they do now.
when I lost my practice, I lost people's respect.
and you hope to earn it back through larceny?
you haven't walked in my shoes.
Tom lost his job.
everyone jumped to his rescue.
even you...
bending over backwards trying to get him a job.
I don't need to walk in your shoes, Orson.
what youidid was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again.
understood?
see you. Thank you.
father?
Yes. Can I help you?
Oh, I hope so.
I, uh, saw you the other night when you were buying your lottery ticket.
I was with my husband Dave. - Yes.
he said that you barely know each other, but it didn't seem that way to me.
and, well, he refuses to talk about his past,
so if there is anything that you could tell me about him...
I'm not sure I can do that.
please.
he has so many secrets, and I don't have anyone else to turn to.
I wish I could help you, but...
this is something you need to discuss with your husband.
well, if it was that easy, do you think that I would be here?
I'm sorry.
please know that my thoughts are with you both, Mrs. Dash.
it's Williams.
I'm too old-school for my own good.
I shouldn't just assume that you took your husband's name.
anyway...
good luck, Mrs. Williams.
Hey, Susan.
I thought I had M.J. till 7:00.
uh, you do.
I am here to take my painting back.
but you gave it to me. It's mine.
well, now I'm ungiving it.
try to keep up.
okay, if this is about what happened at the housewarming...
it is actually, because that is when I decided that I don't want this piece of art that I slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend.
that I slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend.
Capisce?
okay, so the other night you were mad because it wasn't hanging up, but now you want to take it?
Yep. I'm complicated like that.
aren't you glad you divorced me?
if you two want a painting so bad, paint your own.
stay out of this.
this is between me and my ex.
got it?
unbelievable.
anyway, I'm thinking a brighter color for the baby's room.
now I know it's a bit of a stretch, but how do you feel about turquoise?
sweetheart?
we need to talk.
what you reading?
the want ads.
can't decide if I should be a data entry operator or join the marines.
I'm so sorry.
don't be.
I told you, I hated working for that jackass.
you did the right thing.
I should have done it sooner.
but you did it, even though you knew you were gonna lose a lot of money.
you're a good person, babe.
I'm very proud of you.
well, that means a lot, coming from a united states marine.
Hello?
calm down.
calm down.
okay, we're coming over.
I guess Bradley told her.
thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.
it's horrible.
he just kept telling me he loves her.
she's the best thing that ever happened to him.
he finally understands what love means.
I just wanted him to stop talking.
you should never be too impressed by people with good manners.
they're the ones who will give a friendly wave even when they've stolen from you...
they're the type to sweetly welcome you even as they try to uncover your secrets
they're the kind to offer you coffee, even as they report you to the police.
and don't be too offended by someone who's openly rude...
because they may be that way
so I'm driving my car the other night, and what do you think happens?
I crashed into a utility pole.
then, to add insult to injury...
I was electrocuted.
what can I say? It was one of those days.
all my neighbors heard it happen, so they quickly left their microwaved burritos...
and their expensive jars of moisturizer...
and their racy pay-per-view movies...
and they hurried outside, excited to see what all the ruckus was about.
but then, when they saw it was me, this weird thing happened.
for a moment, no one moved or said anything.
they just stared. And then...
Oh, my god.
all hell broke loose.
does anybody know C. P.R?
there's been an accident.
Edie! Can you hear me?
Yes, everyone suddenly became very concerned, which was touching, but ultimately pointless.
moments before the ambulance finally arrived, I heard someone whisper...
don't worry, Edie.
you're gonna get through this. You're gonna be just fine.
Susan mayer--wrong again.
two seconds later, it happened.
with all of my neighbors surrounding me, I took my last breath.
the good news?
I died just like I lived as the complete and utter center of attention.
two days after I kicked the proverbial bucket, my husband asked my neighbors to do me a favor.
you could tell from the looks on their faces it wasn't something they wanted to do, but they agreed to do it anyway.
so the next day, they piled into a car with two thermoses filled with coffee, a basket filled with bakedoods and an urn that was filled with...me.
I hate that we have to do this.
so you've said.
I mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do.
maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching.
well, can you at least put the radio on?
I won't feel like bitching if I can sing along to something.
if you start singing, I'll start bitching, and you don't want that.
it's a 4-hour drive. We have to do something to pass the time.
here's a thought. Why don't we talk about Edie?
and say what?
I don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip.
uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories.
why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend?
that was fun.
okay, I was thinking of stories that put Edie in a positive light.
and after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?
the woman is dead, people.
let's honor her memory.
well, I'm all for saying a few nice things...
but you were never really friends. You and Edie clashed right from the start.
Yeah. That's what everybody thinks.
but the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends.
Oh, that's disgusting.
no, it's okay. It landed on the detergent box.
here.
you go buy yourself a fresh doughnut or booze, crack, whatever eases the pain.
just move it along.
uh, you think I'm homeless. Oh, no, no, no. No, I live here.
I can prove it. I know exactly what's in this garbage bag.
um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle...
wart removal cream?
you're right. I'm homeless.
it's all cleaned up.
Edie Britt. I just moved in down the street.
Oh, yeah. I saw the moving van. Welcome.
Thanks.
so is it just you, or do you have a family?
I have a son. He lives with his dad. It's a long story.
I'll tell you one day over a margarita.
you wanna invite me in for a margarita?
how about coffee? I just put on a pot.
great. You can fill me in on all of the neighborhood gossip, starting with the redhead across the street with the muffin basket.
that's a robot, right?
funny and likes to gossip.
we're gonna get along just fine. - Yes, we are.
wait. Stop. Could we just rest for a second?
we've only gone four blocks.
okay, I lied. I hate running.
well, why didn't you say something? We've been doing this for a week.
because we were starting to become friends, and you like to run, and I like to sit and one of us had to give.
Hi, Susan! - Oh, hi, Helen·Ed.
I would have introduced you, but once Helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up.
right. Ed told me that.
Oh, you met Ed?
Oh, yeah. I've gotten to know him quite well.
yeah? - We're kinda doing it.
doing what? - It.
ed is married.
Yeah, I'm a naughty girl.
no, you're being immoral.
you're committing adultery.
actually, Ed's committing adultery. I'm just getting laid.
you know, forget I ever mentioned it.
I can't forget something like this. Helen is my very good friend.
I thought you just said that she was.
she is annoying, and I hide when she knocks on my door, but she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage.
where are you going? - Home.
Oh, so you're not gonna be my friend anymore?
I don't think so.
I thought you didn't like running.
well, it depends on what I'm running away from!
I'm the whore that lives down the street.
could I borrow a cup of condoms?
a cup? Are you sure that'll be enough?
look, I know that y don't like me, but I am here to do you a favor anyway.
I was out to dinner last night, and I saw your husband with another woman.
Really?
I feel bad saying it, but if I were in your shoes, I would want to know.
you're welcome.
Oh, I get it.
so you feel I judged you, and for revenge, you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage.
if I wanted revenge, I would have joined them and made it a threesome.
you know, Karl would never cheat, and the woman he was with
Brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday.
Oh, the old "I'm taking my secretary out for her birthday" routine.
nice tip of the hat to the classics.
okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, why don't we walk over to Helen's?
and I will introduce you.
we can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about Ed's favorite positions.
what I do and what Brandi's doing is completely different.
how? - I'm not looking to break up anyone's marriage.
I'm in it for a little fun, some free meals and to help an unhappy man through his midlife crisis.
you're just a giver.
fine. Use all of your energy judging me and ignore the real problem.
but let me tell you something.
this is my area of expertise, and I saw the look in that woman's eyes.
she's not in it for the free meals. She's in it for keeps.
you should leave now.
you know, Susan, I'm trying to help my neighbor out.
I thought it's the moral thing to do.
three weeks later, I found Brandi's bra in Karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest.
say what you want about Edie, she really understood men.
I should hope so. After all those years of research...
I can't help thinking about all the times Edie and I sniped at each other.
we could have been good friends.
well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything.
okay, my hour's up. Someone else hold Edie now.
I'll take her.
kinda looks like cat litter.
Lynette, don't look at Edie.
or what, I'll turn to stone?
she's all rough and gritty.
uh, Gaby, before we learn what Edie tastes like...
I got it.
I think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
Oh, please. We're talking about Edie. A little more irreverence is what we need.
give it.
do you guys remember when you took turns driving me to chemo?
well, none of you did it like Edie.
Hey, Lynette.
how you feelin'? - Eh, same.
well, here's the DVD you asked for.
Thanks. I'll watch it during chemo if I'm not too tired.
here we go.
Oh, hi, Edie.
what is that?
a salad of radish, burdock root and bok choy.
what's for dessert, waterboarding?
Thanks. I can't get comfortable.
could you fluff my pillows? - Of course.
well, I've got errands to run, and I'll be back to drive you to chemo.
before you go, would you put my socks back on?
my feet are cold again.
Oh, of course.
Katherine, you have got stuff to do.
why don't I take her to chemo?
it's fine. - Okay.
see you tomorrow then.
Bye.
okay, where's your coat?
Why? Chemo's not until 5: 00.
Yeah, I've gotta make a little stop on the way.
been here before? - A couple of times. You're gonna love it.
love it? I have cancer.
I probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room in this place.
Oh, there isn't a ladies' room, so that's not a problem.
um, I...
Edie, I have chemo in half an hour.
fine. Then we better start drinking.
I'm not supposed to drink.
and they're not supposed to do tattoos in the kitchen, but I have a bald eagle on my ass that says otherwise.
two tequila shooters!
Hey, Edie! - Reggie!
Oh, I thought you were in Florida. - Nah. That was just a body they identified as me.
Reggie, this is my friend Lynette.
I'm trying to cheer her up a little. - Right on. You wanna shoot some stick?
no, thanks. - Come on. You can totally take him.
no, I can't. Uh, see? cancer.
no sweat.
I'll play you one-handed.
can you excuse us for one second?
I need to go to chemo. I have
cancer. Yeah, I heard.
and what do you want from me?
I want you to fluff your own pillows.
you need to start fighting this thing.
I'm doing the best I can.
Oh, not even close. Hell, Lynette, you--you are the strongest person I know.
you're even stronger than me, and that's saying something.
now...
it will be a little out of line bringing you here, but you need to remember who you are.
screw cancer. You are Lynette Scavo.
two tequilas.
now... where's that one-armed friend of yours?
I'm--wanna shoot some stick.
it sounds like she gave you just what you needed. Good for Edie.
she never let me forget it either.
she always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Oh, not now. We have a flat.
maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
nice try.
we don't have time for this.
anybody know how to change a tire?
you want to hand methat cross wrench?
do you wanna tell me what that is?
it's the t-shaped dealie. I'm gonna whack you with if you don't hand it over.
you know, Edie used to live around here when she moved away from Wisteria lane.
you mean when you gals gave her the boot.
less yakkin', more jackin'.
Bree, how did you know where she lived?
um, I ran into her once, unexpectedly...
in a place I never thought I'd be.
follow me. I'll get you situated, and I'll bring your husband in.
is that the visitors' room?
Yeah. Why?
you don't happen to have a private room, do you?
you mean, like an upgrade, something with a couch and softer lighting?
that would be lovely.
you were being sarcastic.
Yes, ma'am. Are you ready to
Oh, not, uh, just yet.
it's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available.
I bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for.
ma'am, it's a prison. The only perk we offer is a cavity search.
to be honest, I-I'm not feeling up to this.
I'm gonna have to come back another day.
fine. He's got another visitor scheduled anyway, - So I don't even have to tell him you were here. - Another visitor? Who?
some lady. She visits him every week.
every week? What's her name?
I can't give you that.
if she's visiting my husband, I think I have a right to know.
ma'am, I'm sorry but I cannot give you her name.
Really?
because I would consider that a perk worth paying for.
well, well. What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
and you didn't bring muffins?
it isn't that kind of visit.
no muffins, no small talk.
should I be scared or grateful?
I stopped by the prison today.
the guard tells me you've been visiting Orson
sometimes twice a week, she said.
who knew lady prison guards could be so chatty?
what are you up to, Edie?
I'm not up to anything, you redheaded ice cube.
he's 15 minutes away.
and quite frankly, I feel sorry for him.
after all, I know what it's like to be exiled from suburbia.
so you're not... trying to start up something?
he's in jail.
my boobs are impressive, but they can't bend iron bars.
well... thank you for checking in on him and for answering my question.
I have a question.
why aren't you visiting him?
Oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after Benjamin.
Ah, well, we're all busy.
come on. Why haven't you been to see him?
that jail is... it's disgusting.
all those men in cages, like animals.
even to step foot in that place is humiliating.
that man went to jail for you.
do you have any idea how much he must love you?
I do.
then why can't you suck it up once a month and go and say hi?
try to help him get through this living nightmare.
why can't you do that?
now as I think about it, don't visit him.
he can do so much better than you.
so... how are you doing?
how do you think?
you're right. I shouldn't have asked.
I know it's horrible here.
how would you know? You've never been.
you have every right to hate me.
there's no need to be melodramatic.
I meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in.
now that I see this place, I don't know what I was thinking.
you were thinking I needed to take responsibility for what I did, and you were right.
but still, asking you to make this sacrifice and not ever coming to see you...
how can you ever forgive me?
just be there when I get out.
I never told you about that because...
I was embarrassed.
Yeah, Edie Britt shamed you into being a better human being.
that is embarrassing.
all right, ladies, we're ready to ride.
good. We got some ground to make up.
I was hoping we would able to get there before dark.
how do you think he'll react when we tell him?
how do you think?
I never thought Edie would be cremated.
I figured she'd wanna be pumped full of chemicals and preserved.
isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
my theory-- Edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see.
you really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
Yeah, I do.
I spent a night with her right after Karlos and I got divorced.
is this too red?
I think I need something pinker.
it's fine. Hurry up.
I want to get to the club while this bikini wax is still fresh.
this is gonna be fun.
I can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
well, we've never been single together before.
Oh, I feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar.
Oh, so do I.
to be fair, we should probably walk in backwards.
Oh, no, that won't work.
we're an unstoppable team.
mm, the hottest chicks on Wisteria lane.
Oh, be nice.
there are lots of attractive women on the street.
like who?
how about Bree?
uh, with that hair color, you could stick a red nose on her, and she could join the circus.
Lynette's beautiful.
mm, for a baby factory.
and susan?
we're the hottest, okay?
too much?
no, it's great.
all right. Come on. Let's go.
you were right about this place.
told ya.
a lot of hotties, very few "notties.
ladies, this is from the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Oh, and I just sat down.
well, that's a personal best.
actually, the drink's for her.
it's pretty dark in here.
he probably didn't get a good look at me.
Oh, Edie, don't take it personally.
we're just different types.
right. Some like tall, blonde and sexy, and some men like...that.
now, now, Edie. Don't be snarky.
we're both hot, remember?
although, apparently, I'm just a little bit hotter.
well, one guy might think so.
one guy who's evidently intimidated by full-sized womanly breasts.
Yes, I guess I am a little on the small side.
that's the drawback to having breasts are real.
what are you talking about?
these are real.
Oh, Edie, come on.
when you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs.
well, someone obviously has a chip on her shoulder.
I'd reach down and knock it off, but I can't go down that low.
okay, you really think you're hotter than me?
let's just say that I have more of what men want.
yeah? Well, I have a vodka soda here that says otherwise.
so he bought you one drink-- a well drink, I might add.
well, it's one more than you got.
are you saying that I can't get a man to buy me a cocktail?
sure, you can, just not as many as me.
one hour.
whoever gets the most swizzle sticks by the end wins.
see ya in an hour, loser.
count 'em and weep, Solis.
well, I guess I could do that.
or I could do this.
I should make some kind of speech.
but I think it's enough.
we both know I crushed you, right?
now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet.
what the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?
I'm sorry. I just needed to be by myself for a while.
Why?
don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
I'm not depressed.
I'm surprised.
it's going by so quickly.
what is?
my youth.
the harder I try to hold on to it, the more it just slips through my fingers.
and all the makeup and dim lighting in the world can't seem to stop it.
Oh, please. You're gorgeous.
and you are going to stay that way forever.
that's the tricky part.
I'm not gonna be old.
what?
ever since I was a child, I've known that I was never gonna see 50.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
no, it's true.
as far back as I can remember, a voice in my head said, "live it up today, cuz you're not gonna have a lot of tomorrows."
you do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
it's not a bad thing, Gaby.
it's actually a gift.
I appreciate my life in a way that most people don't.
I just didn't expect it to go by this fast.
that's all.
well, you know what?
I have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong.
it tells me that 50 years from now, you and I will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks.
if you say so.
now come on.
let's go to my house.
let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
why not?
isn't that weird?
she knew she was gonna die young.
what do you mean, you two were the hottest chicks on the lane?
she called me a baby factory?
Yeah, Gaby, in hindsight, maybe you shouldn't have told that part of the story.
I think we're here.
beecher Academy Van Meter Hall so are we ready for this?
I don't know.
can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
Hey, Travers.
remember us?
sure.
you brought the whole neighborhood with you.
did my mom come with you?
we brought you some muffins.
you can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
what's going on?
is my mom in trouble or something?
come here.
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
your mom was in a very serious accident, and I am so sorry...
but she passed away.
she died?
when?
a couple of days ago.
we've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country.
and your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you.
if you'd like, we could give you a moment.
no.
I'm okay.
well, I have a class.
uh, I'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days.
I don't need to do that.
I mean, I'm sorry she's dead, but we weren't very close.
still, she was your mother.
technically.
but not a very good one.
look, Travers, we're all moms here.
we've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us.
my mom didn't even try to raise me.
I mean, she just handed me to my father and walked away.
how do you expect me to forgive that?
look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm gonna be late.
wait a second.
Travers, you need to know something about your mom, and I'm gonna tell you.
now sit down.
I'd only known your mom about a year when she came over to my house this one day.
Hey, Karen!
your porch light's on.
sitting in our bathrobe drinking, and you didn't call me?
I kinda wanted to be alone.
Why?
it's the anniversary of my son's death.
I'm sorry.
every year I think it'll get easier, and it never does.
nothing worse than losing a child.
in a way, you're kinda lucky you don't have any.
actually, I do.
what?
mm, I have a son.
you lived here a year.
how do I not know this?
because he lives with his father.
when I got divorced, I gave him full custody, so I kinda know how you feel.
I mean, we've both lost kids.
no.
I lost a kid.
you gave yours away.
and you have the nerve to tell me you know how I feel?
I gave him up because I wanted tprotect him.
from who?
from me.
you know, I tried to be a good mom.
I really did.
but I know myself.
and if he...
if he was gonna grow up normal, he needed to get away from me.
what a cop-out.
I think you're just being selfish.
you know, trust me, Karen, there is nothing that you could say to make me think less about myself than I already do.
but if it gives him a chance, it's worth it.
aren't you afraid he's gonna hate you?
I love him enough to let him hate me.
well, I hope you're not making a big mistake.
Well...me, too.
so I'm not defending everything she did, Travers, but you have to know, she loved you, more than you can imagine.
I really need to get to class.
I believe I called shotgun.
God, she is so good at that.
she should be. She's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
I realized...
I never thanked you for coming all the way out here just to tell me.
that was really cool of you.
we felt we owed it to your mom.
Oh, my god. I can't believe we forgot.
what?
we, uh...also came to give you your mom's ashes.
we thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
unless that's a little...weird for you.
why don't you guys take 'em?
are you sure?
Yeah.
you were her best friends.
I'm sure you could think of the perfect place to put her.
okay, we're here.
Guys...wake up.
guys?
we're home.
get out.
Lord, Lynette. You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Yeah, I'd like to see Edie again, but not tonight.
Oh, I think my leg's asleep.
actually, that's my leg.
get your hand off.
Lynette, thank you again for driving.
you bet.
hold it.
we still gotta figure out where we're gonna spread the ashes.
now it's gotta be someplace that was meaningful to Edie.
well, Edie once told me she lost her virginity in a cow pasture.
if we can find that exact field...
we'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
do we really need to do this tonight?
they're ashes. It's not like they're gonna go bad.
fine. We'll talk tomorrow.
Oh, Edie, what are we gonna do with you?
subtle as always, I see.
this was a wonderful idea, Karen.
it wasn't exactly mine.
now be careful. You're spilling Edie.
urn is empty.
let's do it.
shouldn't we say something first?
like what?
I don't know.
a few words describing how we felt about her?
I don't think Edie would want us to get all sappy.
well, I think if we're quick about it, she'd be fine.
here's a thought-- we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
and then we dump her?
then we dump her.
just one word.
this is hard.
okay, I got one. I'll go first.
Edie Britt was sexy.
perceptive.
strong.
beautiful.
I need four words.
okay. I want to do Edie justice, and for that to happen, I need four words, okay?
Edie would so not be surprised you're ruining this moment.
go ahead, Susan. What are your four words for Edie?
one of a kind.
now it's time.
and that is how Wisteria lane came to be my final resting place.
my ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on...
beneath trees that had once given me shade...
on top of roses I once admired...
and beside fences I once gossiped over.
and after my friends had finished saying good-bye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.
as I looked down on the world, I began to let go of it.
I let go of white picket fences and cars in driveways, coffee cups and vacuum cleaners.
I let go of all those things which seem so ordinary, but when you put them together, they make up a life...
a life that really was one of a kind.
I'll tell you something
it's not hard to die when you know you have lived, and I did.
Oh, how I lived.
so I'm driving my car the other night, and what do you think happens?
I crashed into a utility pole.
then, to add insult to injury...
I was electrocuted.
what can I say? It was one of those days.
all my neighbors heard it happen, so they quickly left their microwaved burritos...
and their expensive jars of moisturizer...
and their racy pay-per-view movies...
and they hurried outside, excited to see what all the ruckus was about.
but then, when they saw it was me, this weird thing happened.
for a moment, no one moved or said anything.
they just stared. And then...
Oh, my god.
all hell broke loose.
does anybody know C. P.R?
there's been an accident.
Edie! Can you hear me?
Yes, everyone suddenly became very concerned, which was touching, but ultimately pointless.
moments before the ambulance finally arrived, I heard someone whisper...
don't worry, Edie.
you're gonna get through this. You're gonna be just fine.
Susan mayer--wrong again.
two seconds later, it happened.
with all of my neighbors surrounding me, I took my last breath.
the good news?
I died just like I lived as the complete and utter center of attention.
two days after I kicked the proverbial bucket, my husband asked my neighbors to do me a favor.
you could tell from the looks on their faces it wasn't something they wanted to do, but they agreed to do it anyway.
so the next day, they piled into a car with two thermoses filled with coffee, a basket filled with bakedoods and an urn that was filled with...me.
I hate that we have to do this.
so you've said.
I mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do.
maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching.
well, can you at least put the radio on?
I won't feel like bitching if I can sing along to something.
if you start singing, I'll start bitching, and you don't want that.
it's a 4-hour drive. We have to do something to pass the time.
here's a thought. Why don't we talk about Edie?
and say what?
I don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip.
uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories.
why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend?
that was fun.
okay, I was thinking of stories that put Edie in a positive light.
and after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?
the woman is dead, people.
let's honor her memory.
well, I'm all for saying a few nice things...
but you were never really friends. You and Edie clashed right from the start.
Yeah. That's what everybody thinks.
but the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends.
Oh, that's disgusting.
no, it's okay. It landed on the detergent box.
here.
you go buy yourself a fresh doughnut or booze, crack, whatever eases the pain.
just move it along.
uh, you think I'm homeless. Oh, no, no, no. No, I live here.
I can prove it. I know exactly what's in this garbage bag.
um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle...
wart removal cream?
you're right. I'm homeless.
it's all cleaned up.
Edie Britt. I just moved in down the street.
Oh, yeah. I saw the moving van. Welcome.
Thanks.
so is it just you, or do you have a family?
I have a son. He lives with his dad. It's a long story.
I'll tell you one day over a margarita.
you wanna invite me in for a margarita?
how about coffee? I just put on a pot.
great. You can fill me in on all of the neighborhood gossip, starting with the redhead across the street with the muffin basket.
that's a robot, right?
funny and likes to gossip.
we're gonna get along just fine. - Yes, we are.
wait. Stop. Could we just rest for a second?
we've only gone four blocks.
okay, I lied. I hate running.
well, why didn't you say something? We've been doing this for a week.
because we were starting to become friends, and you like to run, and I like to sit and one of us had to give.
Hi, Susan! - Oh, hi, Helen·Ed.
I would have introduced you, but once Helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up.
right. Ed told me that.
Oh, you met Ed?
Oh, yeah. I've gotten to know him quite well.
yeah? - We're kinda doing it.
doing what? - It.
ed is married.
Yeah, I'm a naughty girl.
no, you're being immoral.
you're committing adultery.
actually, Ed's committing adultery. I'm just getting laid.
you know, forget I ever mentioned it.
I can't forget something like this. Helen is my very good friend.
I thought you just said that she was.
she is annoying, and I hide when she knocks on my door, but she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage.
where are you going? - Home.
Oh, so you're not gonna be my friend anymore?
I don't think so.
I thought you didn't like running.
well, it depends on what I'm running away from!
I'm the whore that lives down the street.
could I borrow a cup of condoms?
a cup? Are you sure that'll be enough?
look, I know that y don't like me, but I am here to do you a favor anyway.
I was out to dinner last night, and I saw your husband with another woman.
Really?
I feel bad saying it, but if I were in your shoes, I would want to know.
you're welcome.
Oh, I get it.
so you feel I judged you, and for revenge, you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage.
if I wanted revenge, I would have joined them and made it a threesome.
you know, Karl would never cheat, and the woman he was with
Brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday.
Oh, the old "I'm taking my secretary out for her birthday" routine.
nice tip of the hat to the classics.
okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, why don't we walk over to Helen's?
and I will introduce you.
we can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about Ed's favorite positions.
what I do and what Brandi's doing is completely different.
how? - I'm not looking to break up anyone's marriage.
I'm in it for a little fun, some free meals and to help an unhappy man through his midlife crisis.
you're just a giver.
fine. Use all of your energy judging me and ignore the real problem.
but let me tell you something.
this is my area of expertise, and I saw the look in that woman's eyes.
she's not in it for the free meals. She's in it for keeps.
you should leave now.
you know, Susan, I'm trying to help my neighbor out.
I thought it's the moral thing to do.
three weeks later, I found Brandi's bra in Karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest.
say what you want about Edie, she really understood men.
I should hope so. After all those years of research...
I can't help thinking about all the times Edie and I sniped at each other.
we could have been good friends.
well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything.
okay, my hour's up. Someone else hold Edie now.
I'll take her.
kinda looks like cat litter.
Lynette, don't look at Edie.
or what, I'll turn to stone?
she's all rough and gritty.
uh, Gaby, before we learn what Edie tastes like...
I got it.
I think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
Oh, please. We're talking about Edie. A little more irreverence is what we need.
give it.
do you guys remember when you took turns driving me to chemo?
well, none of you did it like Edie.
Hey, Lynette.
how you feelin'? - Eh, same.
well, here's the DVD you asked for.
Thanks. I'll watch it during chemo if I'm not too tired.
here we go.
Oh, hi, Edie.
what is that?
a salad of radish, burdock root and bok choy.
what's for dessert, waterboarding?
Thanks. I can't get comfortable.
could you fluff my pillows? - Of course.
well, I've got errands to run, and I'll be back to drive you to chemo.
before you go, would you put my socks back on?
my feet are cold again.
Oh, of course.
Katherine, you have got stuff to do.
why don't I take her to chemo?
it's fine. - Okay.
see you tomorrow then.
Bye.
okay, where's your coat?
Why? Chemo's not until 5: 00.
Yeah, I've gotta make a little stop on the way.
been here before? - A couple of times. You're gonna love it.
love it? I have cancer.
I probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room in this place.
Oh, there isn't a ladies' room, so that's not a problem.
um, I...
Edie, I have chemo in half an hour.
fine. Then we better start drinking.
I'm not supposed to drink.
and they're not supposed to do tattoos in the kitchen, but I have a bald eagle on my ass that says otherwise.
two tequila shooters!
Hey, Edie! - Reggie!
Oh, I thought you were in Florida. - Nah. That was just a body they identified as me.
Reggie, this is my friend Lynette.
I'm trying to cheer her up a little. - Right on. You wanna shoot some stick?
no, thanks. - Come on. You can totally take him.
no, I can't. Uh, see? cancer.
no sweat.
I'll play you one-handed.
can you excuse us for one second?
I need to go to chemo. I have
cancer. Yeah, I heard.
and what do you want from me?
I want you to fluff your own pillows.
you need to start fighting this thing.
I'm doing the best I can.
Oh, not even close. Hell, Lynette, you--you are the strongest person I know.
you're even stronger than me, and that's saying something.
now...
it will be a little out of line bringing you here, but you need to remember who you are.
screw cancer. You are Lynette Scavo.
two tequilas.
now... where's that one-armed friend of yours?
I'm--wanna shoot some stick.
it sounds like she gave you just what you needed. Good for Edie.
she never let me forget it either.
she always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Oh, not now. We have a flat.
maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
nice try.
we don't have time for this.
anybody know how to change a tire?
you want to hand methat cross wrench?
do you wanna tell me what that is?
it's the t-shaped dealie. I'm gonna whack you with if you don't hand it over.
you know, Edie used to live around here when she moved away from Wisteria lane.
you mean when you gals gave her the boot.
less yakkin', more jackin'.
Bree, how did you know where she lived?
um, I ran into her once, unexpectedly...
in a place I never thought I'd be.
follow me. I'll get you situated, and I'll bring your husband in.
is that the visitors' room?
Yeah. Why?
you don't happen to have a private room, do you?
you mean, like an upgrade, something with a couch and softer lighting?
that would be lovely.
you were being sarcastic.
Yes, ma'am. Are you ready to
Oh, not, uh, just yet.
it's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available.
I bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for.
ma'am, it's a prison. The only perk we offer is a cavity search.
to be honest, I-I'm not feeling up to this.
I'm gonna have to come back another day.
fine. He's got another visitor scheduled anyway, - So I don't even have to tell him you were here. - Another visitor? Who?
some lady. She visits him every week.
every week? What's her name?
I can't give you that.
if she's visiting my husband, I think I have a right to know.
ma'am, I'm sorry but I cannot give you her name.
Really?
because I would consider that a perk worth paying for.
well, well. What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
and you didn't bring muffins?
it isn't that kind of visit.
no muffins, no small talk.
should I be scared or grateful?
I stopped by the prison today.
the guard tells me you've been visiting Orson
sometimes twice a week, she said.
who knew lady prison guards could be so chatty?
what are you up to, Edie?
I'm not up to anything, you redheaded ice cube.
he's 15 minutes away.
and quite frankly, I feel sorry for him.
after all, I know what it's like to be exiled from suburbia.
so you're not... trying to start up something?
he's in jail.
my boobs are impressive, but they can't bend iron bars.
well... thank you for checking in on him and for answering my question.
I have a question.
why aren't you visiting him?
Oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after Benjamin.
Ah, well, we're all busy.
come on. Why haven't you been to see him?
that jail is... it's disgusting.
all those men in cages, like animals.
even to step foot in that place is humiliating.
that man went to jail for you.
do you have any idea how much he must love you?
I do.
then why can't you suck it up once a month and go and say hi?
try to help him get through this living nightmare.
why can't you do that?
now as I think about it, don't visit him.
he can do so much better than you.
so... how are you doing?
how do you think?
you're right. I shouldn't have asked.
I know it's horrible here.
how would you know? You've never been.
you have every right to hate me.
there's no need to be melodramatic.
I meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in.
now that I see this place, I don't know what I was thinking.
you were thinking I needed to take responsibility for what I did, and you were right.
but still, asking you to make this sacrifice and not ever coming to see you...
how can you ever forgive me?
just be there when I get out.
I never told you about that because...
I was embarrassed.
Yeah, Edie Britt shamed you into being a better human being.
that is embarrassing.
all right, ladies, we're ready to ride.
good. We got some ground to make up.
I was hoping we would able to get there before dark.
how do you think he'll react when we tell him?
how do you think?
I never thought Edie would be cremated.
I figured she'd wanna be pumped full of chemicals and preserved.
isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
my theory-- Edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see.
you really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
Yeah, I do.
I spent a night with her right after Karlos and I got divorced.
is this too red?
I think I need something pinker.
it's fine. Hurry up.
I want to get to the club while this bikini wax is still fresh.
this is gonna be fun.
I can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
well, we've never been single together before.
Oh, I feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar.
Oh, so do I.
to be fair, we should probably walk in backwards.
Oh, no, that won't work.
we're an unstoppable team.
mm, the hottest chicks on Wisteria lane.
Oh, be nice.
there are lots of attractive women on the street.
like who?
how about Bree?
uh, with that hair color, you could stick a red nose on her, and she could join the circus.
Lynette's beautiful.
mm, for a baby factory.
and susan?
we're the hottest, okay?
too much?
no, it's great.
all right. Come on. Let's go.
you were right about this place.
told ya.
a lot of hotties, very few "notties.
ladies, this is from the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Oh, and I just sat down.
well, that's a personal best.
actually, the drink's for her.
it's pretty dark in here.
he probably didn't get a good look at me.
Oh, Edie, don't take it personally.
we're just different types.
right. Some like tall, blonde and sexy, and some men like...that.
now, now, Edie. Don't be snarky.
we're both hot, remember?
although, apparently, I'm just a little bit hotter.
well, one guy might think so.
one guy who's evidently intimidated by full-sized womanly breasts.
Yes, I guess I am a little on the small side.
that's the drawback to having breasts are real.
what are you talking about?
these are real.
Oh, Edie, come on.
when you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs.
well, someone obviously has a chip on her shoulder.
I'd reach down and knock it off, but I can't go down that low.
okay, you really think you're hotter than me?
let's just say that I have more of what men want.
yeah? Well, I have a vodka soda here that says otherwise.
so he bought you one drink-- a well drink, I might add.
well, it's one more than you got.
are you saying that I can't get a man to buy me a cocktail?
sure, you can, just not as many as me.
one hour.
whoever gets the most swizzle sticks by the end wins.
see ya in an hour, loser.
count 'em and weep, Solis.
well, I guess I could do that.
or I could do this.
I should make some kind of speech.
but I think it's enough.
we both know I crushed you, right?
now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet.
what the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?
I'm sorry. I just needed to be by myself for a while.
Why?
don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
I'm not depressed.
I'm surprised.
it's going by so quickly.
what is?
my youth.
the harder I try to hold on to it, the more it just slips through my fingers.
and all the makeup and dim lighting in the world can't seem to stop it.
Oh, please. You're gorgeous.
and you are going to stay that way forever.
that's the tricky part.
I'm not gonna be old.
what?
ever since I was a child, I've known that I was never gonna see 50.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
no, it's true.
as far back as I can remember, a voice in my head said, "live it up today, cuz you're not gonna have a lot of tomorrows."
you do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
it's not a bad thing, Gaby.
it's actually a gift.
I appreciate my life in a way that most people don't.
I just didn't expect it to go by this fast.
that's all.
well, you know what?
I have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong.
it tells me that 50 years from now, you and I will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks.
if you say so.
now come on.
let's go to my house.
let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
why not?
isn't that weird?
she knew she was gonna die young.
what do you mean, you two were the hottest chicks on the lane?
she called me a baby factory?
Yeah, Gaby, in hindsight, maybe you shouldn't have told that part of the story.
I think we're here.
beecher Academy Van Meter Hall so are we ready for this?
I don't know.
can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
Hey, Travers.
remember us?
sure.
you brought the whole neighborhood with you.
did my mom come with you?
we brought you some muffins.
you can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
what's going on?
is my mom in trouble or something?
come here.
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
your mom was in a very serious accident, and I am so sorry...
but she passed away.
she died?
when?
a couple of days ago.
we've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country.
and your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you.
if you'd like, we could give you a moment.
no.
I'm okay.
well, I have a class.
uh, I'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days.
I don't need to do that.
I mean, I'm sorry she's dead, but we weren't very close.
still, she was your mother.
technically.
but not a very good one.
look, Travers, we're all moms here.
we've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us.
my mom didn't even try to raise me.
I mean, she just handed me to my father and walked away.
how do you expect me to forgive that?
look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm gonna be late.
wait a second.
Travers, you need to know something about your mom, and I'm gonna tell you.
now sit down.
I'd only known your mom about a year when she came over to my house this one day.
Hey, Karen!
your porch light's on.
sitting in our bathrobe drinking, and you didn't call me?
I kinda wanted to be alone.
Why?
it's the anniversary of my son's death.
I'm sorry.
every year I think it'll get easier, and it never does.
nothing worse than losing a child.
in a way, you're kinda lucky you don't have any.
actually, I do.
what?
mm, I have a son.
you lived here a year.
how do I not know this?
because he lives with his father.
when I got divorced, I gave him full custody, so I kinda know how you feel.
I mean, we've both lost kids.
no.
I lost a kid.
you gave yours away.
and you have the nerve to tell me you know how I feel?
I gave him up because I wanted tprotect him.
from who?
from me.
you know, I tried to be a good mom.
I really did.
but I know myself.
and if he...
if he was gonna grow up normal, he needed to get away from me.
what a cop-out.
I think you're just being selfish.
you know, trust me, Karen, there is nothing that you could say to make me think less about myself than I already do.
but if it gives him a chance, it's worth it.
aren't you afraid he's gonna hate you?
I love him enough to let him hate me.
well, I hope you're not making a big mistake.
Well...me, too.
so I'm not defending everything she did, Travers, but you have to know, she loved you, more than you can imagine.
I really need to get to class.
I believe I called shotgun.
God, she is so good at that.
she should be. She's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
I realized...
I never thanked you for coming all the way out here just to tell me.
that was really cool of you.
we felt we owed it to your mom.
Oh, my god. I can't believe we forgot.
what?
we, uh...also came to give you your mom's ashes.
we thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
unless that's a little...weird for you.
why don't you guys take 'em?
are you sure?
Yeah.
you were her best friends.
I'm sure you could think of the perfect place to put her.
okay, we're here.
Guys...wake up.
guys?
we're home.
get out.
Lord, Lynette. You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Yeah, I'd like to see Edie again, but not tonight.
Oh, I think my leg's asleep.
actually, that's my leg.
get your hand off.
Lynette, thank you again for driving.
you bet.
hold it.
we still gotta figure out where we're gonna spread the ashes.
now it's gotta be someplace that was meaningful to Edie.
well, Edie once told me she lost her virginity in a cow pasture.
if we can find that exact field...
we'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
do we really need to do this tonight?
they're ashes. It's not like they're gonna go bad.
fine. We'll talk tomorrow.
Oh, Edie, what are we gonna do with you?
subtle as always, I see.
this was a wonderful idea, Karen.
it wasn't exactly mine.
now be careful. You're spilling Edie.
urn is empty.
let's do it.
shouldn't we say something first?
like what?
I don't know.
a few words describing how we felt about her?
I don't think Edie would want us to get all sappy.
well, I think if we're quick about it, she'd be fine.
here's a thought-- we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
and then we dump her?
then we dump her.
just one word.
this is hard.
okay, I got one. I'll go first.
Edie Britt was sexy.
perceptive.
strong.
beautiful.
I need four words.
okay. I want to do Edie justice, and for that to happen, I need four words, okay?
Edie would so not be surprised you're ruining this moment.
go ahead, Susan. What are your four words for Edie?
one of a kind.
now it's time.
and that is how Wisteria lane came to be my final resting place.
my ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on...
beneath trees that had once given me shade...
on top of roses I once admired...
and beside fences I once gossiped over.
and after my friends had finished saying good-bye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.
as I looked down on the world, I began to let go of it.
I let go of white picket fences and cars in driveways, coffee cups and vacuum cleaners.
I let go of all those things which seem so ordinary, but when you put them together, they make up a life...
a life that really was one of a kind.
I'll tell you something
it's not hard to die when you know you have lived, and I did.
Oh, how I lived.
does this relationship have a future?
can't we just keep going the way we are?
jackson left.
Orson's lying to me again.
Bree made a decision.
so I think I have to divorce him.
Karl signed up.
Karl, what are you doing here?
well, I just enrolled Evan.
and Susan confessed.
Mike and I got in a car accident.
Mike was driving, right?
that's what we said, but it wasn't true.
he took the blame for me.
on this street, the bargaining begins at sunrise...
an old woman offers a paperboy a generous tip if he'll throw the paper onto her porch...
a wife tells her husband she'll make his favorite dinner if he'll bring home roses...
a man tells his neighbor he'll take in his garbage cans the day she finally mows her lawn.
Yes, on Wisteria lane, everyone knows how to bargain.
absolutely everyone.
I don't want oatmeal. Can I have pancakes?
Katherine's not a short order cook, buddy.
if she made oatmeal for breakfast, we're having oatmeal.
I tell you what, M. J.
if you finish just half of it, I will make candied apples for your sleepover.
I love candy apples.
she's letting you off easy. You should thank her.
thank you, Katherine.
you are so welcome, you sweet thing.
dad, are you gonna marry Katherine?
that's, um... I don't know.
why not?
Oh, well, oh, because we haven't talked about marriage.
why not?
M. J. You're being rude.
Oh, I'm not offended.
don't you wanna marry Katherine?
well... I love her. She's absolutely fantastic.
so why don't you marry her?
can you help me out here?
are you kidding?
buddy, um, when it comes to marriage, the truth is...
would you look at the time? I'm late for work.
we're gonna have to talk about this later.
coward. - You got that right.
how'd I do?
you were great.
but he didn't answer me.
doesn't matter. Issue's on the table.
Yes, on this street, the negotiating begins at sunrise, and it doesn't end...
here's the ice cream I promised you.
until someone gets exactly what they want.
Walter Bergen was a divorce lawyer, and the women who hired him always had something to say about the men they were divorcing.
he's always talking to his grandmother, who died six years ago.
he spends all his money on hookers, who may or may not be women.
he says he needs more money for the children, and by "children," I mean racehorses.
Yes, Walter Bergen thought he had heard it all until the day when one of his clients actually said...
my husband is a decent man, and I want to do right by him.
women who seek my services rarely take that attitude.
well, I like to think of myself as a good person.
I'm sure you are.
and I wouldn't worry about your husband.
the income he'll derive from his half of the catering business alone should
wait. I'm not planning on giving him half.
it's my business.
which you started after you were married.
that entitles him to half.
I may have overstated things when I described my husband as a decent man.
he actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.
Mrs. Hodge, it's state law. What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that for $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to help me protect my business.
surely you're not asking me to do something criminal?
Mrs. Hodge, didn't you say you like to think of yourself as a good person?
well, clearly, I like to think of myself as a rich person even more.
full house. Bree takes the high. Gaby gets the low.
split the pot.
Oh, I hate splitting the pot.
well, that's the rule. There's nothing you can do about it. So stop bitching.
well, you can't talk to me like that.
I am the wife of Fairview's Latino Businessman of the Year.
so he finally won? - Yeah.
there's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife.
Oh, not necessarily.
I hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly.
Really? How do you know?
the wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical divorce lawyer in town.
who--who's that?
my ex-husband.
Oh, right. Karl's a divorce lawyer.
Yeah, and a total shark.
the worst thing about our divorce was that I couldn't hire him to represent me.
but I thought you just split everything done the middle.
Oh, not with Karl.
by the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing left to split.
you don't say.
Hey, ladies. Uh, Lynette, ahem. It's getting kinda late.
are you kicking us out, Tom?
uh, no. No, just reminding Lynette that it's, uh, ten minutes till midnight, which means ten minutes till tomorrow.
I got it. I'll be right up.
what was that about?
Tom and I are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
let me guess. Written by a guy?
was his name Carlos Solis?
we've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer.
is it working?
I've gotta say it is.
you become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to.
Lynette! - Je! Two seconds!
we--we should go.
no, we're in our third week. We got this down to a science.
just deal me out a few hands.
Juanita, hurry up. The bus will be here any minute.
be right down!
there's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.
not hungry. Bye!
Susan? It's Dave.
Hey, remember I was telling you about my buddy that owns that boat on Bass Lake?
Yeah, well, he's not using it this weekend, so I thought maybe I'd take you and M. J.fishing.
Yeah, I know it's short notice, but I really wanted to do something to thank you.
you've been so good to me since Edie died.
plus I know M. J.would love it.
great. I'm really looking forward to it. Bye.
Hello?
Oh, hi, principal Hardy. What's up?
she's wearing what?
now march in there and wipe that stuff off!
you don't have to yell. - Yes, I do.
do you have any idea how humiliating it was for me to get that call today?
now every parent in town is gonna think that I let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school!
and I want my makeup back. Is it in here?
why do you have this?
Why?
some girls at school saw you pick me up yesterday and told me I must be adopted.
they said I wasn't pretty enough to be your daughter.
how's it feeling?
it's really throbbing.
Oh, please hurry. - Okay.
hi there.
Jackson, hey. You're back.
I needed to talk to you.
why didn't you call?
I wanted to surprise you.
well, you did.
Oh, uh, right.
Jackson, you remember Mrs. Mccluskey, don't you?
sure. How are you, Mrs. Mccluskey?
Oh, I'm in agonizing pain. Thanks for asking.
I'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.
he's gonna lance a boil on my backside.
it may rupture any second.
okay.
I just had my car detailed, so I should probably go.
no problem. Uh, when can I see you?
how about dinner tomorrow night?
sounds great.
if you want to keep staring at each other,
I can just go lay down on the lawn and die. I don't mind.
see you tomorrow.
Karl. - Hey, Mike.
heard M. J.'s having a sleepover.
I thought I'd hit you up for an invitation.
aren't you a little old for sleepovers?
cards on the table. I need your help.
Evan's one of the only boys in class who wasn't invited, and he's really upset.
okay, cards on the table.
M. J. says Evan's a bully, and he doesn't want him at his sleepover.
well, what if I promise Evan will be on his best behavior?
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands. M. J. finalized his guest list.
well, I think if you check that list again, you'll notice Evan's name's on there.
I'm M. J.'s dad, not his bouncer.
but... thanks.
Hey, honey. How's your day going?
very exciting. Just got back from the grocery store.
it is double coupon day, sorta like the Oscars and the Super Bowl all rolled into one.
did you remember to get my, um, my special deodorant?
I sure did. My lady's armpits will be aluminum-free.
how is your day?
I'm totally slammed, which is why I'm calling.
it looks like I'm gonna be here late tonight, and by "late," I mean past midnight.
wait. W-what about our pact?
we'll... double up tomorrow.
Lynette, I have been looking forward to this all day.
I know, and I'm really sorry.
listen, I gotta go. I will call you later. I love you. Bye.
Tom. What are you doing here? Is everything all right?
everything's fine.
well, then what are you doing... here?
Oh, no. Are you crazy?
crazy about you, baby.
but I have so much to do, and I'm not gonna be done till 2: 00 A. M.
possibly 3: 00. - Come on.
this is important. Remember what the book said?
every night, no matter what.
no, this is a really bad time for me.
well, you did buy me that deodorant.
Lynette, I have Carlos on line two.
uh, tell him I'll call right back.
he says it's really important.
Hello?
Hey, Lynette. I'm over here at capital consultants, and the guys have a question.
I need you to pull up their account.
now? I'm kind of busy!
well, the ad has to be at the printer's by noon, so yeah, now.
yes?
what's going on? You all right?
sorry. Just had the handyman in here, but he's finished.
thank you, handyman.
you're welcome, ma'am.
so... Carlos...
where were we?
could I get you something?
no, thanks, I don't drink.
Oh, that's right. Glug glug. I remember now.
I'm bringing you business, Karl.
try not to insult me.
sorry. So you want to divorce Orson.
Yes, I know that comes as a surprise.
not really. I've met him. The guy's a stiff.
Karl, if we move forward, I will insist you handle our divorce with dignity.
are you sure?
I don't know of a dignified way to screw a spouse out of money that they, by law, are entitled to.
that is why you're hiring me, right?
I just want to protect what is rightfully mine.
can you help me?
sure. - Lovely. I'll make out a check.
Yeah, not so fast.
uh, I said I could do it, not that I would.
I need a favor.
well, what kind of a favor?
M. J. Delfino is having a sleepover at his house in two days.
my son wasn't invited. Now his feelings are hurt.
so?
so I want you to get my son into that sleepover.
how would I go about doing that?
gosh, I don't know.
how would I go about hiding your assets from Orson?
I need your help, Karl.
I really do, but I am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old.
you know, I had this one client...
his wife had been with him since junior high.
she supported him through med school, gave him three kids and the best years of her life.
once I had done my particular brand of legal magic, he ended up with 90% of the money, and she ended up in a studio apartment...
with a roommate.
then again... M. J. does... love my macaroons.
sweetie, don't listen to those kids. They're idiots.
you are a gorgeous little girl.
you have to say that. You're my dad.
no, it's the truth. You are naturally beautiful.
makeup just covers that up.
he's right, sweetie. You don't need all that gunk on your face.
then why do you wear it?
because I'm an adult.
and besides, I hardly wear any.
come on, Gaby. Let's try to keep this real.
are you gonna wear makeup when daddy gets his big award?
well, it's a big, fancy dinner. Of course.
but that's not fair.
sweetie, you're 6.
there's a lot of things I can do that you don't.
so you get to look pretty at daddy's party, and I have to look like this?
Hey, I have a great idea.
okay, see? Your daddy's got a great idea.
how about if neither one of you wears makeup to the dinner?
okay.
no, no, no. Your daddy's just being silly.
can I talk to you for a second, silly daddy?
are you a lunatic?
I am not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.
come on. This is the perfect opportunity to teach her that beauty's only skin deep.
Yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation, you may want to rethink that.
Gaby, your daughter is in pain.
and don't you love her enough to put your vanity aside for one night?
I was in labor for 20 hours. She still owes me for that!
fine.
I will make the ultimate sacrifice, and I will be ugly for my daughter.
but if she ever needs a kidney...
you're really going all out on this sleepover.
although I'm not sure that tons of sugar and whistles are a good combination.
Oh, good point.
I'll make us some goody bags filled with earplugs and vodka.
it's great. I'm sure M. J. will appreciate it.
I'm sure he will.
he's a great kid and funny.
that was hilarious the other day, when he asked us when we're getting married.
I'm glad you thought it was funny. I was tap-dancing my ass off.
no, you were great.
although... someday you'll probably have to answer the question.
I'm sure he's forgotten by now. You know kids.
kids are like that.
grown-ups on the other hand...
not so much.
we're not talking about M. J. any more, are we?
Oh, you want to go run and get your tap shoes?
no. No. I'll be completely honest here.
moving in with you is one of the best decisions I ever made.
you make me really, really happy.
But?
I've been married before, and I just don't see myself getting married again.
okay.
probably not what you wanted to hear.
I wanted the truth.
it's not your fault the truth sucks.
so could you get the streamers out of the car?
sure.
Oh, by the way, for what it's worth, I do love you.
I've only been working there two months, but I love it.
and the kids are so cute.
and I get to see M. J. during the day, which is nice.
uh, you know, uh, for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you...
you seem awfully far away.
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
I have something to ask you, and I don't know how you're gonna react.
what is it?
this is gonna come out of nowhere, but...
I want you to marry me.
and here's how I came to this.
the other day...
what are you doing?
I have to go upstairs.
now?
Susan, are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just didn't want you to see me crying.
honey, you didn't let me finish.
Oh, I'm sorry.
just, um, all I've been telling myself that I didn't really care about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly.
but I am so lonely.
and as much as I tell myself that I like being the strong, single woman on her own, the truth is, I think about you all the time.
and I wanted to call you, but I thought you'd gotten over me.
and to hear that you still love me...
that is just something that I really needed to hear right now.
and I want you to know-- oh, god.
I want you to know I love you, too. Jackson...
I love you.
Oh, god.
I really wish you'd let me finish.
finish what?
Susan, I need you to marry me so that immigration doesn't deport me back to Canada.
the one thing I didn't tell you is that I'm here on a student visa that expired six year and I got a call from the authorities, so unless I can find somebody that will marry me, I'm gonna be in really big trouble.
Susan, did you hear me?
I heard.
so... what do you say?
okay. Okay, it was a bad idea.
get out or I will kick your ass back to the Canadian border!
took a shower, brushed my teeth.
we are good to go.
what are you doing?
you know, the pact.
didn't we already do it tonight?
no.
Oh, they're all starting to blur.
look, I worked till 3: 00 A. M. last night. I'm exhausted.
how about we take a rain check?
a rain check? This isn't baseball.
every night for 30 days-- that's the law.
Tom, I have a 7: 00 A. M. meeting.
how about I take a long lunch, and you do me twice at work tomorrow?
come on.
this is important.
okay.
okay. We'll have sex.
but can you make it quick?
Lynette, please.
you can't rush an artist.
morning.
Oh, sorry. I don't have time for breakfast.
good. I didn't make you any.
Oh, okay. Uh, coffee will be fine.
beans are right there. Grab a handful and grind.
is there a problem?
you don't remember?
last night, we were having sex?
you fell asleep?
after?
during.
was it good?
I didn't finish.
God, you ruined our streak, Lynette.
I'm sorry. I was exhausted.
it's not like I was asking you to scrub a floor.
all you had to do was lie there, like you usually do.
Oh, okay. I'm gonna let that one go, cuz you're upset.
well, it's true. With you being so tired from work lately, I'm the one doing all the heavy lifting.
Tom, you're being completely irrational. We've had sex 23 days straight.
I've seen more ceiling than Michelangelo.
we made a commitment, Lynette. The book says.
Oh, would you stop with the book?
you bought it at a car wash along with a pack of gumand an air freshener.
you're right. It's stupid.
all my ideas are stupid. I should just stick to doing chores.
don't just walk away.
you better get to work, Lynette.
you're gonna be late.
haven't seen you boys in a while.
there's been a break in the club fire case, mr. Williams.
you got a minute?
do you know this guy?
no. Who is he?
Dr. Samuel Heller, psychiatrist from Boston.
he's the guy who burned up in the fire.
what's a shrink from Boston doing in Fairview?
no idea, but we'd like to find out if anyone knows him or what he was doing there.
did you see him backstage?
no, I didn't see anybody.
except Porter Scavo.
Yeah, but I told you. That was a mistake.
do you know a guy named Jackson Braddock? - Was he?
Yeah, he got locked in the employee men's room right before the fire started.
well, I don't know anything about that.
have you talked to him?
we've been trying, but he left town, and we've been unable to find him.
that's a shame.
we'll figure it out.
thanks for your time.
you bet.
Hey, Susan. It's Dave.
you know, I was thinking I'd pick up you and M. J. around 6: 00 A. M. Saturday for the trip.
Yeah. I figured the earlier we get going, the better.
okay.
well, hello there, M.J.
I was baking this morning, and like an idiot, I made too many macaroons.
would you be willing to take one?
I would hate to see them go to waste.
macaroons are my favorite.
Oh, really? What a delightful coincidence.
you know, I could bake these for you every week, and all I'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors.
what kind of favor?
invite Evan Mayer to your sleepover.
I don't like Evan.
he's mean.
Oh, no. Deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked.
he hit me with a dead squirrel.
now, M.J. We can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick.
what do you say?
will you invite him?
would you like some ice cream with your macaroons?
because I could make that happen.
I'm late for my golf game.
I don't have time to go to the A. T.M. So I took the cash out of your wallet.
Bye.
M. J. There's someone in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single day.
and you are the only one who can help me.
please, please invite Evan to your party.
okay.
thank you.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
boy, the stuff I do for macaroons.
go away! I don't want to talk to you.
come on. Let me in.
Thanks, but I've reached my maximum allowance for humiliation this week.
listen, I'm sorry you thought it was a real proposal.
I thought you knew I'd moved on.
maximum allowance exceeded.
what do you want?
I wanted to apologize.
you have every right to be mad at me.
Oh, I'm not mad at you.
you know, I'm just disappointed in myself.
I was a little lonely and a little afraid and...
I just did what I always do-- let some silly romantic fantasy take over.
I didn't know you ill felt that way about me.
I don't.
this isn't about you.
not really.
and besides, you moved on.
well, I had to.
you pushed me away.
I had to... heal my heart and get over it.
this--I mean, this is really the only thing you can do to stay here and do your work?
Yeah.
I'll help you.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll do it. But that's it.
no love, no sex, just... marriage.
no sex?
you want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?
Gaby, come on.
for god sakes, will you take those off?
it's 8: 00 at night.
Oh, fine.
as long as you don't mind people thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister.
there's our man of honor.
Gaby, this is Stephanie. She put this whole banquet together.
nice to meet you.
you're probably wondering why I look like this.
excuse me?
I'm not ill.
I'm just not wearing any makeup so I can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside.
I don't actually look this hideous.
okay.
will you please stop explaining yourself?
I mean, it was bad enough when you did it with the valet.
I can't help it.
I don't want people thinking I condone this face.
I'm gonna go find our table.
champagne?
Oh, thank you.
I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup.
gotta go.
come on, guys. No running in the house.
these candy apples are great.
can me and Evan have another one?
well, I better ask Katherine.
where is Katherine?
you're missing all the fun.
I just got a candied apple out of a kid's hair.
sounds like you got everything under control.
no, come on down.
it's not as much fun without you.
okay.
you were honest with me, so I'm gonna be honest with you.
I got scared.
of what?
I was hosting a party with this amazing man and his adorable son, and we were like the perfect family, and then I realized...
we're not a family.
it could all go away in an instant.
Katherine, I'm not leaving.
but you're not committing either.
why not, Mike?
is it Susan?
you still in love with her?
no. No, I've told you that.
then it must be me.
Katherine, I love living you in my life.
I'm just not ready.
I don't know what else to say.
I'm not trying to get you to say anything.
I just have to take care of myself.
I should probably go make sure the first floor is still there.
excuse me. The mayor's about to leave, and the newspaper wants a photo with him and your family.
Oh, that's so sweet.
tell him no way in hell.
tell him we'll be right there.
the newspaper? Forget it.
Gaby, I do business with the city. I can't just blow off the mayoR.
seriously, we cannot allow this to be photographed.
next time there's an epidemic, people are gonna think I'm patient zero.
you're not getting out of this.
fine.
but just so we're clear, you're also Latino jerk of the year.
come on. Let's go.
Oh, can I at least use the bathroom first?
ladies! Attention, please.
I am in a jam, and I need lipstick and eyeliner.
come on. Chop chop.
you can use my makeup.
Oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone.
what do yo mean? We have the same coloring.
Yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either, but I can only deal with one disaster at a time.
asian girl. Close enough.
um, I don't think so.
was it the "chop chop" thing?
fine. I'm sorry.
now can I borrow some blush?
I don't share cosmetics.
I'm sort of a germ freak.
Oh, don't worry. I'm as healthy as a horse.
Really? You look sick.
that's because I don't have any makeup!
I said no. Now leave me alone.
okay, okay, look. I'm sorry.
you're right. I never should have asked.
come out now, or I'll call security!
you know, for a woman who has a purse full of dinner rolls, you sure have a lot of attitude.
Oh, good. We're all here.
by the way, Mrs. Solis, you look absolutely stunning.
thank you.
Yeah, mom. You look great.
okay, big smiles, everyone.
see this? My third espresso.
I'm wired. No way I'm falling asleep tonight.
how about we throw a pizza on the front lawn, and when the kids run out to get it, we lock the door and do it in every room in the house?
Tom, I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
if you wanna stay mad, I guess you're gonna stay mad.
I am not mad, Lynette.
then what's wrong?
you're gonna think it's stupid.
tell me.
you want to know why sex has become so important to me lately?
because you are the only thing in my life that I'm passionate about.
that is so sweet.
no. No, it's not good, Lynette-- not for me, not for you.
I... I need something else to be excited about.
I thought you wanted to do this, to take a break and stay home.
I did.
you know, I figured, the kids are grown...
I can take care of the house and the errands, and it'll be easy, and it is.
it's too damn easy.
I am finished with my work by noon, and then I just sit around, waiting for you to come home.
so... what do you want to do?
what are you passionate about?
I don't know.
I'm a middle-aged guy, and I don't know what I want to do with my life.
I told you it was stupid.
no.
no.
I know I disappointed you tonight, and I'm really sorry.
it's okay.
I know why you did it.
I need makeup, too.
honey, I know you think being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right now, but believe me, it's not.
you were a model.
Yes, I was.
and my whole life, people told me how pretty I was.
so you know what?
I never thought I had to work hard in school or work on friendships or my personality.
none of it.
and then I stopped modeling, and I realized I didn't have much on the inside.
and I don't want that for you.
I want you to be brave and funny and creative...
to be more than just a shell.
I want you to have the whole rich, gooey center.
will you promise to do that for yourself?
okay.
when do I get to wear makeup?
I tell you what.
you can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.
I bought M. J. a fishing pole.
I figure I'd teach the little guy how to cast before we hit the water.
Oh, my god. We're not gonna be able to make it this weekend.
I'm kind of... getting married.
what?
to who?
I thought I heard you out here.
just when you thought I was out of the picture, I'm back.
since you held up your end of the bargain, I'm going to hold up mine.
I'm gonna make sure that you walk away from this marriage with your business and your assets intact.
now to accomplish this, I may need you to lie, stonewall, even resort to some outright trickery.
my question is... will you be up for that?
I used to think of myself as a good person.
if I had a choice, I would always choose the high road.
lately I've begun to realize that, um...
I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.
you know what that makes you?
the perfect client.
on this street, the bargaining is finished by sundown...
a daughter agrees to go to bed early if her mother lets her dress up in her old gowns...
a woman agrees to let her fiance spend the night if he'll agree to sleep on the sofa...
a man allows his lover to get close as long as they don't discuss the future.
Yes, everyone knows how to bargain on Wisteria Lane.
late morning tonight for
it was a joyous occasion until...
did I miss anything?
I'm asking you nicely to leave.
if you don't, I will drag you out of this church myself.
I don't love these babies.
Lynette struggled with her pregnancy.
stop saying that.
Gaby made a commitment...
I am now officially your guardian.
and Bree... - I'm married.
to a man who's blackmailing you.
jumped in with both feet.
I think we could be happy here, right, Danny?
new neighbors...
would you like to go to a movie sometime?
moved in.
look, Danny, please let me explain.
go to hell. - What's gotten into that kid?
he's a teenager. - Go look for him.
and evil made an appearance on wisteria lane.
the first time Karen Mccluskey saw Roy Bender, she did something she didn't expect to do.
she smiled.
the next time they met, Roy did something he didn't expect to do.
he smiled back.
after a week of sly flirtations, Karen and Roy did something no one expected them to do.
and they did it twice.
with each passing day, Karen began to feel something she hadn't felt in years, and she realized she needed to know if Roy was feeling the same way.
has it been an hour yet?
14 minutes. Come on. Your doctor said you need to walk an hour a day.
the little snot nose -- I'd like to drop dead just to piss him off.
don't even joke about that.
I like having you around. I like it a lot.
you remember to put the seat down.
you can drive at night. A girl could get used to that.
how many minutes has it been now?
I'm trying to tell you how I feel, Roy.
I didn't expect this. I always thought that...
you just get one big love in this lifetime, and that was my husband Gilbert.
and after he died, I figured the rest of my life was about making meatloaf for one.
then you come along and... Well... Hell.
I love you, Roy.
isn't there anything you wanna say to me?
you know how I feel.
a woman needs to hear the words.
all right. Here we go.
what the hell?
Oh, my god! Are you all right?
we gotta call 9-1-1!
for a moment, Mrs. Mccluskey didn't move.
and whether it was her boyfriend's discovery of Julie Mayer or her realization that he wasn't going to say the words she desperately needed to hear, Karen Mccluskey suddenly felt the urge to...
it was a shame what happened that day, considering how nicely the morning had begun.
one neighbor was out reading the sports section, delighted to see that his team had won.
a child was playing with her new doll, thrilled to discover just how durable it was.
and a woman was walking with the man she adored, determined to say she loved him for the very first time.
Yes, up until the screaming started, people thought it was going to be a wonderful day.
Oh, good. You're up.
uh, yeah. Good mornin'. - Good morning.
did you go to sleep with a breath mint in your mouth?
this is our first morning waking up as husband and wife again.
I wanted it to be perfect.
well, it couldn't be more perfect.
Yes, it could.
here's a breath mint for you.
did we really get married last night?
either that, or we paid a lot of money to watch our friends get drunk.
come here, Mrs. Delfino. - All right.
we have a honeymoon to get started.
Hey, whatcha doin'?
uh, nothing, sweetie.
why don't you go play in your room for ten minutes?
ten?
I wanna play in here.
okay. Of course you can.
in fact, I can't think of a better way to start our new life together
all of us here, Julie's home.
you know, the last couple years, when I used to think about what I needed to be happy, this was it.
this was the picture I had in my head.
Hey, Danny. It's Ana. Did you get my message about going to the mall later?
Oh, okay. That's cool. Um, how about tomorrow?
Yeah, me, too. The mall blows.
well, give me a call if you wanna hang.
shot you down, huh?
I could get Danny Bolen anytime I want.
okay. Well, let me know if you need any help.
not that I need your help, but... What do you got?
here's the secret to landing a guy--you have to ignore them.
you are the one who ends the conversation.
you are the one too busy to get together.
And? - And that's it.
trust me, it works. How do you think I played this one?
you did not play me. - Like a fiddle.
you know how many runway shows he sat through before I would even look at him? Six.
it wasn't that many. - Six.
and when he finally asked me out, I said,"okay."
but then at the last minute, I backed out, saying I didn't feel well.
you weren't really sick? - God, no.
I had a pedicure and then went to sardi's for drinks.
after that, he was my slave.
I rented a yacht that day! - Really? That's hilarious.
a week later, he gave me this.
I lost that deposit!
eat your waffles! I'm teaching!
look at you. - I know. Martha friggin' stewart, eh?
Hey, Ana. Yeah. I'm-- I'm not much of a-a mall guy.
Yeah. But, uh, I'll see you around, okay? Yep.
mornin'. - Where were you last night?
out. - Yeah, where "out"?
I drove around lookin' for you.
I couldn't sleep. I went a lot of places.
happy now?
don't be a wiseass. We were worried about you.
Nick, go take your shower. Go.
12 oranges for a half a cup of juice? That's worth it.
no, thanks.
okay, so we're sticking with the moody teenager thing, huh?
come on. What'd you do last night?
I already told dad. I went out.
Danny, it's me.
what did i do when Peter Spadaro pushed you off the swing set in first grade, huh?
I threw a slushee in his mom's face.
clearly, I have your back. Talk to me.
I went out drinking.
there's nothing else to do here, mom.
look... I know this move has been hard on you, but try to make the best of it, okay?
trust me, it takes a lot more effort to be unhappy.
okay.
thanks for being honest. And that's for drinking.
mom, was that you throwing up in the bathroom this morning?
Yeah. I was just feeling a little nauseous.
mm, sick in the morning.
if you weren't so old, I'd say you were pregnant.
okay, guys, here's the deal.
I had some bad seafood last night.
at the wedding? We had chicken.
I mean after that. I went out to get gas, and I had... Clams.
I don't even remember where I ate them.
I just remember seeing this sign that said "clams,
and I thought, "ooh, I haven't had clams for a while."
so I went in and had clams, but they were bad, which is why I was throwing up.
well, my point was, next time, please flush.
and I'm done with my oatmeal.
what? We said we weren't gonna tell the kids until after the first trimester.
that's next Friday.
wow, you actually know the day.
wow, you're really into this.
well, someone has to be.
I'm not telling anybody until we're absolutely sure everything's okay.
Really? Are you sure that's the only reason you're not telling them?
I can't open my eyes all the way. Who is it?
did someone have too much wine at the wedding?
I don't know. I was too drunk to notice.
I'm sorry to bother you. I'm just looking for Bree.
Oh, she's not here.
Where'd she go? - I don't know.
I just woke up, and she was already gone.
she's not in the test kitchen? - No.
I just wanted to let her know I'm taking the morning off.
well, I'm sure she'll understand, given all you've been through.
what do you mean?
well, you know, Mike and Susan getting married.
Oh, I'm not upset about that.
Really? Good. I'm glad.
I mean, it's not as if it's gonna last.
excuse me?
Oh, Mike doesn't really love Susan.
he just feels sorry for her. He'll be back.
my thoughts exactly.
that... Was amazing.
Yeah. Who knew you were such a wild woman?
I'm not. I've never done this before.
well, you are a fast learner. - No.
I mean, sex for me has always had to have an emotional, romantic or even spiritual dimension.
I can see now you can take all of that away and it's still...
marvelous recreation.
the best there is.
except, of course, when you actually tried to - I'm sorry.
I mean, really. - Well, some people like it.
you've done this a lot, haven't you?
you don't stay this good by skipping practice.
God, you're a pig. Kiss me.
hold that thought.
well, that's weird. It's Mike. Hello?
Hey, Karl, listen.
there's no easy way to say this, but something's happened to Julie.
I mean, she was just lying there.
what if we hadn't found her in time?
thank god you did.
how could this happen? I mean, Julie's, like, the nicest girl in the world.
I know. Who'd want to hurt her?
okay, I gotta go. We'll call you from the hospital as soon as we hear anything.
tell Susan and Mike we'll take good care of m. J.
this is insane. How could someone strangle Julie?
I know, and on our property. It could've been me.
I've never had much upper body strength.
I'd love to say he means well, but...
what are you looking at?
well, this horrible thing happened.
we're all out here trying to make sense of it.
where are they?
Oh, they were out here... For a minute.
you know, when you think about it, how much do we even know about these people?
not much. They're from new york. They have a son...
Danny, who I saw coming out of a movie the other night with Julie.
Seriously? Like a date?
sure looked that way.
you know, when women are attacked, the police look at the husbands or the boyfriends first.
maybe it's time that we get to know our new neighbors.
okay, they are all looking at our place, and I do not think they are admiring our azaleas.
why are they staring at us?
Oh, let's see.
uh, we're the new people on the block, Mrs. Mccluskey saw you fightin' with Julie, and, uh, this morning, she turns up almost dead.
what, are you kidding me? I had nothing to do with that. I like Julie.
then what were you fightin' about?
nothin'. It's personal.
you're not gettin' how serious this is.
if that old lady talks to the cops, we got problems.
okay, okay.
Danny, just tell me where you went when you were drinking last night.
I keep trying to remember. I... I think I was at the park.
I drove by the park. You weren't there.
I drank a lot, okay? It's a little fuzzy.
that's great, Danny, you know? That's really great.
all right, if anybody asks, let's just say he was home with us.
no, because if anybody saw him out, we're done.
maybe the old lady won't talk to the cops.
uh, maybe I won't need an alibi.
Danny, people are already lookin' over here!
maybe that is because we are hiding in our house like guilty people.
now I am going to make Susan and Mike a manicott'.
and then we are going to get out there and start hugging people.
the cops are going door-to-door asking questions.
won't be long before they're here.
what am I gonna tell them, huh?
the truth - that you saw that Bolen kid fighting with Julie.
well, it was just a couple of words. They're kids. They argue.
if I start pointing fingers...
you're just telling 'em what you know.
what if I'm wrong?
I can't have another family on this street hating me.
who hates you?
Oh, the gay guys. I've said stuff.
listen to me.
you know you've gotta do the right thing. - Yeah.
but you don't have to do it alone.
I'm gonna be right here with ya. And...
there was something I wanted to say before, and I didn't get the chance.
if you got hit by a bus, I'd really miss you.
that's it?
okay. You're showering alone tonight.
all right, I love you. There. I said it.
do you mean it, or is that just your beta-blockers talkin'?
we'll find out in an hour.
so you can't think of anyone who would want to hurt your daughter?
no, I told you. She's a great kid. Everybody loves her.
where is that doctor?
he'll be here as soon as he can.
was she dating anyone? - No.
you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
if she was dating somebody, I would know.
he said he would be here.
Mrs. Delfino, I know how difficult this is for you.
Really? Has your daughter been attacked?
Hey, um, you know what?
how about we do this after she talks to the doctor?
okay.
Susan! How is she?
we don't know yet. Uh, nobody's talking to us.
do you need somebody to take care of m. J?
uh, Bob and Lee are watching him.
Mrs. Delfino? - Dr. Hill, what is going on?
she's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests to make sure there's no internal bleeding.
what kind of tests? - Blood work, some x-rays.
um, can--can we go with you? - Of course.
can I talk to you? - Uh, we really need to move here.
I-I-I don't think you should give her an x-ray.
Lynette, just let him do his job.
Julie's pregnant.
what? - She might be. She's not sure.
what are you talking about?
she told me.
it's no problem. I can give her an m. R.I.
there's no radiation, so it's safer for the baby.
Hey, guys. What's up?
uh, we're just taking some food over to Mike and Susan's.
you know, we feel so awful about what happened.
Nick, you talk to the guys.
I'm gonna get this over there while it's still hot, okay? - Okay.
so, Nick, after what happened to Julie, we're thinking of starting up a neighborhood watch.
are you interested? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.
great.
Danny must be pretty shaken up. He's--he's pretty close with Julie, isn't he?
I think we're all pretty shaken up.
weren't they, uh, dating, though? - No, no, just friends.
uh, she was helpin' him with some tutoring.
Really? - Yeah.
cause some people saw them at the movies together.
like I said, just friends.
so this neighborhood watch thing-- is there, uh, gonna be a meeting?
Yeah, we'll let you know.
is this--is this really about the neighborhood watch?
cause it seems like the only one you're watching is my kid.
honey! It's your mother.
we're done. Right, guys?
Thanks, hon.
that, uh, didn't look like it was going so good.
Yeah, they were asking about Danny. It's like you said they would.
then it is time to get our son an alibi.
I saw you drive in.
uh, yeah, I just wanted to come home and take a shower before I head back to the hospital.
look, I know things have been... Awkward lately.
but I heard about Julie, and I wanted to do something.
thank you. I know Susan will appreciate it.
so... How is Julie? - Yeah, we don't know. They're still doing tests.
Oh, god. I can't imagine what you're going through.
you have to stay strong, Mike.
whoa, wait, wait. What are you doing?
just letting you know I'm here for you.
anytime.
come on in.
ana, there are two detectives here who wanna ask you some questions.
what about? - We're investigating the Julie Mayer assault.
where were you last night at approximately 11: 00?
Oh, I can answer that. She was in her room.
we have a very strict 10: 00 p. M.Curfew.
actually, I was out.
what? I saw you go into your room.
Yeah, and then I climbed down the trellis and I met a friend.
can I borrow your mace? - Please, ma'am.
my tax dollars pay for it. I should get to use it.
who was the friend you met?
Danny Bolen. - Wait, Danny Bolen?
as in the guy who blew you off this morning? - Yes. He's a friend.
I want him to be more than a friend.
Mr. Bolen said that you stopped by a liquor store.
no. No, no. She's 16. She doesn't drink.
Yeah, we bought some beer.
how about a taser? You guys must carry a taser.
can anybody verify your whereabouts?
well... Danny.
okay. Thanks for your time.
you know why kids are like this now?
because you people won't let us hit them anymore.
if I find this bastard before the cops do, he won't need a trial 'cause I'll kill him with my bare hands.
look, I know you're mad. I don't want to hear anger in this room.
we need to stay positive for Julie's sake.
do we even have a clue who did this?
a jealous boyfriend, maybe?
was she even seeing anyone?
no, not that I know of.
is this a bad time? - No, no. Come on in.
Oh, how is she?
still unconscious. We're waiting for the test results.
you know, I need to talk to Lynette. I'll be back in ten minutes.
she must never ever know I slept with you.
Bree, my daughter was attacked.
I've got more to worry about than Susan getting mad at us.
of course. I'm sorry.
look, I know we said we'd get together this week, but till this all gets sorted out, I-I need a little time.
I completely understand.
I do want to see you again. Really.
just not now. - Okay.
dad?
so what did they say?
the doctors still don't know. But she's not pregnant.
I'm so sorry about that. I just had to say something.
what made you think that she might be?
she told me.
a few days ago, I was out in my yard.
I was upset.
Julie saw me and asked me what was wrong.
we started talking about stuff, and...
it just came out.
Th--and you didn't just...
just immediately pick up the phone and call me?
so who's the guy?
I don't know. - She didn't say?
all she said was she'd gotten involved with someone and that it was complicated.
complicated? And that's the word she used?
Yeah.
Because..."complicated" means "trouble,
so you knew that she was in trouble, and you chose not to come to me?
like I said, Julie asked me not to.
you are my friend, not hers.
after everything we've been through, I cannot believe you would betray me like that.
whoa, that's not fair.
Lynette, my daughter is hooked up to a machine, and a guy who is complicating her life
a guy that I didn't even know about-- might've put her there, so I don't need to be fair.
Hey, Reggie. Thanks for coming so quickly.
no problem, Mrs. Solis.
how are those two little precious ones?
what?
Oh, my kids. Oh, you threw me off with "precious."
they're the least of my problems. We've taken in a teenager.
sorry to hear it.
Yeah, she's been using this to sneak out at night. That's why I want you to take it down.
she climbed down this trellis?
Yeah, that's what she said.
okay. It's just that it's pretty beat up.
I wouldn't have thought it could hold much more than those roses.
but then again, why would she lie? I'll get my tools.
I'm telling you, she opened her eyes for at least 10 or 15 seconds.
she called me "dad." - I believe you.
well, what does it mean?
well, in layman's terms, drifting in and out of consciousness is better than fully comatose.
our main concern is the intracranial swelling.
in fact, if she wakes up, we may choose to induce coma.
well, why would you do that?
the swelling will heal faster if she's unconscious.
but I'm confident she'll recover.
thank god. I should find Susan.
good lord. They need me in the e. R.
um, before you go, one quick question.
when Julie wakes up, will she remember what she saw or heard during the brief moment she was awake?
I don't see why not. - But people in comas dream, don't they?
she could wake up thinking she saw something odd when really it was just a bizarre dream.
not very likely.
her brain is swollen. That has to cause hallucinations.
I once thought Lauren Bacall was in my bedroom, and that was just a high fever.
ma'am, there's been a bus crash. I need to go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
uh, talk to your friend. You may be surprised what she remembers.
liar! - What?
there is no way you crawled down that trellis, because I just tried to, and it collapsed on top of me.
what's your answer to that? - I don't know.
pull back on the carbs and try again in two weeks?
wh-- Ana, this is serious.
why would you lie to the cops?
did Danny ask you to cover up for him?
I'm not covering up anything. Danny didn't do it.
well, the police think he did. You don't know this kid.
I know him better than the cops.
you're just mad because I didn't take your advice.
what are you talking about?
you told me to play hard to get, which is totally lame.
I figured out a way to make him owe me.
aiding and abetting?
this is your solution on how to land a guy?
who are you calling?
the police. - No!
Julie Mayer is lying in a hospital bed right now, and Danny might have put her there.
you're telling the truth.
Bree, you're back.
I brought you your favorite biscotti.
Aw, you are so sweet.
and I hear Julie's doing better.
much better. She's just sedated now.
the doctors are very optimistic.
Oh, my, that is good news.
you know, I wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed your wedding, especially the part where you and Katherine made peace.
well, I'm glad someone enjoyed that.
but you are friends again, right?
I mean, you said all those lovely things to her in the church.
Yeah, but it wasn't enough for Katherine.
you know, I don't know where she gets off being the injured party.
she took Mike from me first.
but you and Mike were divorced at the time.
and -- and Katherine was very lonely.
okay, rule number one of the female code-- never sleep with your friend's ex-husband.
well, uh, perhaps she should've seen that you still had feelings for Mike.
it would've been different if she'd slept with...
Oh, let's say for instance, Karl.
Karl? Oh, yeah, like that would ever happen.
no, Katherine's a lady.
she's not one of those dumb skanks that would fall for Karl's come-ons.
so you agree it would be different?
much different. Worse.
worse? Why worse?
because Karl hurt me. He cheated and lied.
I mean, any friend who would know all that and sleep with him anyway?
I would never talk to her again.
I don't blame you for defending Katherine. But...
I just don't need a friend like her in my life, especially when I have a friend like you.
Orson. Come in.
uh, I'm getting everybody to sign a get well card.
we're sending it over to Julie. - Oh, that's nice.
I suppose I should sign it somewhere inconspicuous, given recent events.
I suppose.
by the way, this morning when I said that Mike and Susan wouldn't last?
I know you thought I was crazy.
no. I didn't think that... Exactly.
well, f.Y. I. I stopped by their house today with a casserole.
Mike was there... Alone.
let's just say he was grateful. Very grateful.
why wouldn't he be?
God, you have no ear for innuendo at all!
he made a pass at me.
with Julie in the hospital and his marriage one day old?
well... It may be the first day, but.
he's clearing having second thoughts.
Oh, and. Please don't tell Bree.
I'd hate for this to get back to Susan.
I hear Julie opened her eyes. That's great.
Yes. Yes, it is.
I'm sorry you're mad at me.
Yeah, I'm not mad.
I just can't understand why she went to you instead of me.
that day that Julie found me crying?
the reason she opened up to me was because I told her that
and no one else can know about this -- I'm pregnant.
you are?
that's amazing.
wait. Why were you crying?
let's see. Uh, I'm in my 40s, my husband is back in school, I'm the sole breadwinner, I don't know how I'm gonna do this whole baby thing again, and...Also because...
what?
because I can't quiet that one voice in my mind that keeps saying...
maybe I shouldn't.
Oh, honey.
Yeah.
Lynette, uh...
you can do whatever you think it is you need to do.
Yeah. I know. Lucky me.
it's weird. Everybody talks about a kid being a gift.
it's the only gift where you puke for nine months before you receive it and then scream the day it arrives.
that's true.
but they are a gift, Lynette.
I know that because...
I spent the last few hours thinking that I was...
gonna lose mine.
I realized that I would...
trade everything I own, I would give everything I ever will have, for just one more day as Julie's mom.
but I'm not telling you what you should do.
actually, you are.
and I'm glad you did.
I had some briefs to finish, but I'd rather work here than at the office.
Hey, Bree. You're still here?
Oh, she's kept me company all day.
is she a saint or what?
Hey, Lee. Thanks for calling me back.
uh, I'm just checking on m. J.
this has been the longest day of my life.
I thought I needed some time to myself.
I was wrong.
I-I need you.
I booked our room at the motel. Here's the key.
if you could come by, even for just an hour...
well, it would mean a lot to me.
please.
I-I don't want to be alone tonight.
neither do I.
Hey, Gaby. - Hey, you got a minute?
Oh, I think I know why you're here, and believe me, I am as ticked off as you are.
Angie - no, no, no, no.
Danny should've never kept your niece out so late.
when I found out, I kicked him so hard, he's still trying to get the shoe out of his butt.
it'll never happen again.
it never happened at all. - What?
ana wasn't with Danny last night. She never left the house.
what are you talking about?
she snuck out. Danny bought her beer. They both fessed up.
ana was lying.
well, why would she lie?
because your son told her to.
well, maybe she was changing her tune 'cause she didn't want to get in trouble with you.
no. No! She's covering for Danny.
I don't know what you're implying, but he's a good kid.
your niece is the one that's been hounding him day and night.
Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.
I'm giving you a heads up that Ana's taking her story back.
let's slow down here, okay?
can I at least talk to the girl before she goes pointin' fingers?
too late. She's talking to the police right now.
baby, I screwed up.
what happened?
I never should've told you to ask that girl for an alibi.
did she talk to the cops?
Yeah, which means they should be here any second.
but I didn't do anything. I
we don't have time for that. You're a suspect.
they have the right to question you.
ma... - Just listen to me.
tell 'em you will not waive your miranda rights.
and we will have a lawyer down there as soon as we can.
remember, how does a fish get caught?
he opens his mouth.
it had been a horrible day, and people in the neighborhood were doing their best to recover.
one mother was about to share some good news with her family when her son saw a flashing light in the window.
another was busy grounding her niece when she noticed the police car pulling up across the street.
a woman was planning a rendezvous with her lover when she saw a young man being taken out of his house.
within moments, everyone had heard the son of one housewife was suspected of strangling the daughter of another.
Yes, it had been a horrible day.
and the thought occurred to one old woman
the days ahead could be worse.
a friendship was torn apart.
I care about my friends.
sorry you are no longer a part of that group.
I need to talk to you. - What? Here?
Bree's affair was revealed to Orson.
Mona threatened Angie.
you've got till tomorrow to come up with the rest of the money, or I go to the police.
and then tragedy struck.
I'm at the site of a bizarre accident that happened just hours...
if you watch the news tonight, you will be told all about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.
you will hear eyewitness accounts of the crash.
you will learn the extent of the damage.
but the news can't tell you who survived.
because no one yet knows...
for sure.
Oh, Susan, thank god you're here.
I was on my way home. I got this text from Julie.
she said a plane crashed onto the lane?
Yeah. A single-engine plane that had to make an emergency landing.
the pilot had a heart attack. - Julie said Karl was taken away in an ambulance?
Yeah. He's in surgery.
H... h... how bad is it? He's gonna make it, right?
there was a lot of bleeding.
the doctors are doing the best they can.
you want to sit down? Here. H... have a seat.
come here.
was anyone else hurt?
Orson... and Mona Clarke.
Yeah, they're still in surgery.
Bree got a little banged up, - but the nurse says she's gonna be okay. - And little Celia might have a concussion.
Oh... What...what happened? - The plane was headed straight for her, and Lynette ran over and pushed her out of the way.
you saved her life.
come on. You would have done the same thing for my kids. It's no big deal.
no, Lynette, we owe you everything.
so what do we do now? - I guess we just wait and pray.
I think that's a really good idea.
Ow.
Lynette, are you okay?
I don't know. I just...
I have this terrible pain.
the truth is, no one knows who survived that tragic plane crash...
Oh, Tom, I think there's something wrong with the babies.
or more importantly, who didn't.
any word about Karl?
uh, still in surgery.
God, I feel like such a hypocrite.
after that guy cheated on you, I hated his guts.
never spoke to him again.
and I was just in the chapel praying for him.
I know what you mean.
it's pretty complicated for me, too.
with that, Susan began to think of her marriage to Karl...
how wonderfully it had started...
how they'd been so happy...
until the day Susan found a lipstick where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day she told Karl to leave, and she wondered...
what if she hadn't?
wait. Wait! Don't go.
you just kicked me out.
I know.
I put 12 years of my life into this marriage, and we have a daughter.
we owe it to Julie to try to work this out.
Aw, Susie.
don't touch me. You're still a pig.
okay, so, um,
if we are gonna put this behind us,
I need to know about everyone that you've been with since we were married.
everyone?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Karl, I don't want to be wondering, when we go to a party or a restaurant, "Did he sleep with her? Her? Her?"
okay.
well, you found out about Brandy.
Yes.
it was nice to put the panties with a face.
go on.
well, before her...
let's see...
it was Amber, the dental hygienist...
Kwan Lee, the massage lady...
Oh, remember when we had cable installed, and you wondered why we got so many channels for free?
okay, you know what? Uh, maybe you were right.
it's good to have some secrets between a couple.
why don't you just go upstairs and unpack your stuff?
I will learn how to swallow my rage. - You are not gonna regret this.
hey there. I'm Mike Delfino.
Oh, yes.
we met at, um, Mary Alice's funeral.
uh, your husband told me you have a clogged sink.
Oh, yeah.
come on in.
so how you liking the neighborhood so far?
I like it. It seems quiet... friendly.
it is. And safe.
I bet we have the lowest crime rate in America.
you need to get that?
Nah. Let the machine get it.
Hi. It's Susan and Karl. Leave us a message.
Hey, Suse. It's me.
listen, I'm gonna be working late.
don't hold dinner for me.
by the way, the switchboard's gonna be closed, so don't bother calling. Love you.
he's screwing his secretary.
huh?
my husband.
thinks he's fooling me.
he's not.
I'm sorry.
you know, uh, what would serve him right...
to come home and find me in bed with another man.
Yeah, I gotta go.
what's the rush? - Well, I've got to get a part at the hardware store.
Mm. - Mm!
and they close at 6: 00.
Oh. Oh, my god.
am I that undesirable?
no, you're very desirable, uh, i... in... in a big way.
did you just call me fat?
no. No. I... I... I think you're very beautiful.
it's just...
you know, you're married.
Oh.
right. Um...
I'm sorry.
look...
if you're unhappy,
you should do something about it.
Oh!
Oh, please.
not another business trip.
Oh, please.
let it be another business trip.
I tried.
I'm sorry.
that's it?
15 years of marriage, and that's all I get... Two lousy sentences?
I don't know what else to say.
I don't know." How about, um, "hey, Susan, "thanks for eating nothing but broccoli and colon cleanser "for the last six months so you could lose weight and look good for me"?
or, "hey, Susan, thanks for wasting "the best years of your life while I went out and banged everything with a g. e.d. and a tramp stamp.
I'm sorry, okay?
but you could've spared yourself all this pain if you'd just let me go the first time.
you really do deserve better, Susan.
Mrs. Delfino?
Karl didn't make it.
Oh.
Oh, my god.
if there's anything you need,
we have counselors available.
n... no, I'll... I'll be fine. Thank you.
I can't imagine what you must be feeling.
mostly I'm...
I'm feeling grateful.
Bree Hodge was told about the death of Karl Mayer at 6: 12 that evening.
she became so hysterical. She had to be sedated by 6: 18.
it wasn't long before she fell asleep.
and then she began to dream...
a dream about what her life would have been like if Karl hadn't died.
you are so corny!
Ahh.
no deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.
happy?
Karl, you've made me happy in ways I couldn't even imagine.
Mm. Now if it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind pulling down my zipper with your teeth and taking me on the table?
nag, nag, nag.
what is it with you women once you get a ring on?
mm, and if you're a stickler for tradition, we could always take it up to our bedroom.
our bedroom... I like the sound of that.
well, get used to it...
because it's going to be our bedroom for a long, long time. - Mm. Mm.
I meant what I said when I proposed.
being with you is gonna make me into a whole different man.
well, I hope not completely different.
I don't ever want to lose that sexy beast who swept me off my feet.
Mwah! - Whoo!
trust me. He's not going anywhere.
Wow. Honey, that was fantastic.
Oh, my god.
you're supposed to be catering a wedding.
Yes, clearly this is my fault. - Ah.
Courtney? - I'm so sorry, Bree.
really, Karl, my yoga instructor?
no charge for next month, okay?
like I'm keeping you!
get the hell out of my house. - She... she's going.
I'm not talking to her!
how could you, Karl? In our own bed?
Yeah, you're right. That was tacky.
I am so sorry. Bye.
I'll call you.
what? - Sorry. Uh, force of habit.
look, this thing doesn't have to mean any more than we decide it does.
you made a vow to me, Karl.
Oh, my god. Why did I think I could change you?
Yeah, I know. You thought you could turn me - into your personal lapdog, like Orson. - You leave Orson out of this.
Why? I haven't done a thing to you that you didn't do to him.
get out of my house!
the truth hurts, doesn't it?
get out.
I didn't know who else to call.
you were his emergency contact.
I'm just a little surprised.
Orson and I hadn't spoken in nearly ten years.
a... are you sure there wasn't someone else in his life?
a girlfriend maybe?
never saw one.
in fact, in the seven years he lived here,
I never saw anybody visit him at all.
um...
where did you... find him?
in the bed.
paramedics said it was a heart attack.
he'd been there two days.
can you imagine?
just like that, you're gone, and no one notices?
poor Orson.
well, take whatever you want.
I'll have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.
you know, he spoke about you constantly.
it was always "Bree this," "Bree that."
it was almost like he died of...
what?
say it.
like he died of a broken heart.
Mrs. Hodge?
I just wanted to tell you your husband's out of danger.
thank god for that.
but there were some complications.
what kind of complications?
this is a preliminary assessment,
but it seems there has been some damage to his spinal column.
what does that mean exactly?
there's a good chance your husband is paralyzed.
excuse me.
can you tell me anything about Mona Clarke's condition?
the doctors... they did everything they could, but that woman...
I mean, she was hit by a plane. - Oh, my god!
now all we can do is wait and hope that she pulls through.
pulls through?
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter. She's hanging in there.
how? She got hit by a plane!
the doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious, but now would be the time to pray.
Oh, believe me, we will.
dear god, please take that blackmailing bitch home now.
a frickin' plane hit her. What is it gonna take, a silver bullet?
all right, look, I'm gonna go home, pack up our stuff. You stay here.
if they pry the propeller out of that woman's mouth and she starts yapping, get the hell outta here.
just like that.
Angie Bolen began to consider what was happening.
she thought of the doctors trying to save Mona, and how long it might take her to recover.
then she imagined Mona waking up...
and telling the police everything she knew.
and Angie asked herself,
what would happen if Mona Clarke lived?
how about a little lunch, Ms. De Luca?
eggplant parm.
maybe it's not like the place we used to see you go into on east 10th street,
but not bad.
I want to see Nick. - He's a little busy at the moment.
I just want to talk to him for a couple of minutes.
as far as the bureau is concerned,
Nick is a traitor.
get used to it. You're never gonna talk to him again. - What about Danny?
Tyler is with your mother.
but enough about what you want. Here's what I want...
Patrick Logan.
you need to be thinking real clear right now.
we know Logan ran everything,
but without him, it's all gonna fall on you.
I don't know where he is.
I haven't spoken to him since that night.
you've been on the run 18 years, and you and your former lover don't even exchange a phone call, huh?
don't take this personally, agent Padilla,
but you guys weren't the ones I was running from.
look, I know Logan.
I know how scary he is.
but I think the situation you're in now is worse.
then you don't know how scary he is.
federal sentencing guidelines dictate the punishment in this case.
there's no room for leniency from the court.
that being said, Ms. De Luca, you have indicated that you would like to address the court.
thank you, your honor.
no one was supposed to get hurt.
we just believed in something, and we wanted to make other people believe in it, too.
but someone did get hurt.
a man died.
I read every newspaper article about your husband, about Sean...
how he coached little league, that the whole neighborhood came to his funeral.
I never lived in a world like that...
until we moved to Fairview.
I never felt like a part of a community, which made it so much clearer to me how horrible it is that I brought so much pain to yours.
please rise for sentencing.
you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
marshals, remand the prisoner to custody.
Oh.
mum?
mum!
so... how is she?
I'm...
I'm so sorry. She didn't make it.
I know how upset you must be.
please don't be angry with god because your prayers weren't answered.
Oh, don't worry about it, hon.
me and god are good.
I spoke with the doctor.
they are going to keep her overnight for observation.
I thought they said she was fine. - No, they're just being extra cautious. That's all.
look at her.
I feel bad even saying it, with everything that's happened, but...
we really lucked out, huh?
I don't think it was luck.
I think it was god.
actually, it was Lynette.
no, Lynette was his instrument.
either way, it was a hell of a tune.
no, I'm serious.
I think god saved Celia because she's special.
she has a gift.
what kind of gift?
I'm not sure yet.
but she has one.
I know she's gonna do something amazing with her life.
fine.
while you figure out how our daughter's gonna change the world,
I'm going to the cafeteria.
see you in a few.
as she lay there,
Gabrielle began to think of ways her daughter could shine.
she thought of music...
and sports...
and other creative pastimes.
and before she drifted off to sleep,
Gabrielle wondered, what if her daughter was destined to be a great actress?
Hi.
Hi.
Celia Solis. How old are you?
5.0
it's our first audition. We're very excited.
Oh, great. Such a cutie, just what we're looking for.
Oh, she can be cuter. Show him, honey.
good girl.
okay, Celia, this is a... here.
this is a commercial for "Ouch Away! Bandages."
stand right there on the "t.
you just got a boo-boo on your finger.
you're gonna hold it up, look real sad and cry, okay?
and go.
no, no. Don't smile, honey. We need you to cry.
let's try it again.
uh, okay. Thank you... thank you very much.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
you gotta give her another shot. Please.
I... I love the look, but can I be honest with you, mom?
the side dish that came with my lunch has more talent. - What are you saying?
I'm saying she's not as good as coleslaw. Deal with it.
Hey, that little girl is here for a reason.
she is going to inspire people, and you are gonna be part of that!
all right. Well, hurry up.
all right.
Hey, I got you another chance. Can you cry for mommy?
sure you can.
when that nice casting man asks you to hold up a finger, just hold it up and cry. How easy is that?
Ugh.
Hello?
what?
Oh, my god.
daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.
and... when he fell, he landed on your hamster cage and crushed Mr. Mcfuzz.
he is dead. Mr. Mcfuzz is dead.
okay.
roll it.
Gaby, I'm going to take Celia for an ice cream!
be back in a bit!
come on. Come on. The bus for camp leaves in 20 minutes.
but what about my auditions? Mommy's gonna kill us.
Hey, let me handle mommy.
you need a sleeping bag to get ice cream? - Run!
leave it. Leave it! Leave it!
what the hell are you doing? We talked about this.
no summer camp. She's got auditions.
Gaby, you have got her living in this weird little bubble, and she needs to be around kids her own age.
she will be. I'm taking her to a casting call for "Annie.
why can't you support her career?
Celia, will you wait in the car, please?
thank you, sweetie.
because she stinks.
that little girl is destined for greatness.
that is why god saved her.
God does not save people who stink.
Yeah, well, maybe god saved her so that she could go to camp and make some friends and have a normal childhood!
who would believe in a god like that?
Gaby, she's miserable.
no, she's not. She wants this.
no, she does it to please you!
that is a horrible thing to say.
I am not hurting her.
in fact, making her shine is my life's work.
all I want is people to understand how special she is.
Celia, get in the house! - Celia, wait.
I'm sorry, but you have clearly lost your mind, and I'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin - our daughter's childhood. - If you don't like it, leave.
Gaby, be careful what you say, because I am very close to going.
see ya. Come on.
let's go get ready for your audition.
you're gonna be the best Annie ever.
Ouch!
Ohh.
there you go, sweetie.
all better.
Ouch away! Adhesive bandages...
they heal with a mother's love.
mama, no.
look at that face.
that's a star.
you're not watching this again.
now please, help me with the groceries.
did you get my wrinkle cream?
you can't buy stuff like that with food stamps.
I know. I just wish you loved me enough to steal it.
Oh.
Hello?
Jerry, sweetie.
honey, it's your agent.
Oh, Celia's dying to work.
what do you got for us?
Oh, come on. There's gotta be something.
no, no. She's not too old. She can pass for 15.
hell, I'm looking at her right now. Okay, we'll be there.
baby, we've got an audition.
and we gotta get that hair into pigtails.
mama, I think we need to talk.
what did I do with those ace bandages?
we gotta flatten you down.
listen to me. I don't want to be an actress.
what? You can't quit. You're...
I'm special. This is my destiny. It's why I was spared.
you spent the last 20 years telling me I'm meant for big things.
and you are.
no.
I'm not special.
I'm normal.
and I just want to have a normal life...
get married, have kids.
and there's gonna be plenty of time for that.
you always say that.
why can't you admit it's over?
because if we give up, then everything I've worked for is for nothing.
your father walked out. Your sister never calls.
this is all I have.
what time's the audition?
tomorrow, 3: 00.
now let's do something about this hair.
Oh, honey, this is the one. I feel it.
one day you're gonna thank me.
I brought you coffee.
so have you figured out what our 4-year-old is gonna do with her life?
no. But I did figure out what she has to do to be special.
what's that?
absolutely nothing.
how could this happen? I know I fell, but I felt fine afterwards.
it doesn't take much to cause a tear to the placenta.
but you said the one baby is fine? - Yes, but if we don't operate on the other one, there could be a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which could put the child at risk developmentally.
at risk how? Physically? Mentally?
right now there's no way to know.
how soon can we do the surgery?
we're ready to go. Let's get her in.
at that moment, Lynette began to think of the baby she had yet to meet.
she thought of what it would be like to hold him, how it would feel to look into his eyes...
and to kiss his tiny hand.
and then Lynette thought of what would happen if the doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.
he especially hates the hamstring stretches.
well, and obviously it's hard to hear him cry, but you really need to tune it out, because without the therapy, his muscle tone will...
you try. Maybe it's me.
sometimes it helps to sing to them.
Oh, I do that. He loves it when I do that.
and the sailor said, "brandy, you're a fine girl."
what a good wife you would be
why don't we take a break?
maybe we should take some time and talk about where we're at.
where we're at is we haven't seen any milestones since August.
not since he finally started grabbing his feet.
but that was a big one. - Definitely.
but he should be sitting by now, right?
or pulling to stand or crawling.
if you worry too much about what he should be able to do by now or what other kids his age are doing, it's gonna drive you crazy.
fine.
I know I keep saying this, but try to focus on the progress he's making.
like what?
you're with him every day. You tell me.
what do you see?
would you, um, excuse us for a second?
it's okay.
what is it?
I can't do this. - Can't do what?
this, her, the therapy, and the injections and the equipment.
and no one can even tell us if any of it is helping.
I think it is. But even if it isn't, - this is what there is to do, so we're doing it. - Well, I can't.
no, you don't want to. Neither do I.
neither does he. Didn't you hear him crying in there?
but we don't have a choice.
so come on. Jean's gotta go home soon.
I feel like I'm being punished, and I don't even know what I did.
you can't think that way.
what else is there to think about?
hopes for the future? He might not even have one.
he's 14 months. Don't write him off yet!
but you should start thinking about the future.
because no matter what, it's coming.
and it's either gonna make you less afraid or more, and you will know that you either did everything that you can for your son...
or you will be sorry.
Yeah.
there we go.
I know.
come here.
it's okay.
I can do this.
Hi, honey.
can I have a sandwich?
uh, sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.
but I'm hungry.
well, unless you want soap on rye,
you're gonna have to wait.
actually, why don't you make yourself a sandwich?
but you always do it.
and you always watch me, so I know you know how.
I'm tired.
so am I, and I still have to vacuum and do the laundry.
my arms hurt. I had to swim today.
and you do that so you can get stronger, so you can do things like make sandwiches.
speaking of which, in the time we've been arguing about this, you could've...guess what...
made a sandwich.
so could you!
Jason's mom makes him whatever food he wants, even french toast.
I would be happy to make Jason french toast, too.
he always tells me how pretty I am.
not to mention, he's also in a wheelchair, so he can't reach the shelves in the fridge.
but you can!
too bad you don't appreciate it.
you're not... you're not really busy!
you just don't want to help me!
you know what? One day I won't be able to help you because I won't be here, and then maybe you'll understand why I wanted you to learn to do stuff for yourself!
or you won't!
but either way, I'm not making you a sandwich.
that looks good.
can I have a bite?
when I was born, my doctor told my parents
I wouldn't make it through the night, then through the week, then it was that I was blind, that I'd need a wheelchair.
I guess what I'm saying is...
I've really pissed my doctors off.
at first, my mother was scared...
scared of my disability, my limitations.
I know this because she told me.
then she realized what she was really scared of, was my potential and that she'd missed something that would help me reach it.
gandhi said, "Strength does not come from a physical capacity."
it comes from an indomitable will.
my mother's probably never heard that saying...
but every day of my life, she showed me how true it is.
now I...
I hope I can start showing her.
thank you.
thank you all very much.
how's our baby?
is he okay?
we lost the baby.
but...
the other baby is fine.
it's okay.
we're gonna be okay.
I don't know how to say thank you for saving my child's life...
and how sorry I am for...
we were gonna name him Patrick
and he would have been...
amazing.
the funeral for Karl Mayer was a dignified affair
attended by friends and family
and those who loved him.
the priest spoke about the nature of tragedy,
how it causes people to ask "what if?"
what if he hadn't died?
what if I had chosen differently?
what if I had made that mistake?
and then the priest said
a friendship was torn apart.
I care about my friends.
sorry you are no longer a part of that group.
need to talk to you. - What? Here?
Bree's affair was revealed to orson.
Mona threatened angie.
you've got till tomorrow to come up with the rest of the money, or i go to the police.
and then tragedy struck.
I'm at the site of a bizarre accident that happened just hours...
if you watch the news tonight, you will be told all about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.
you will hear eyewitness accounts of the crash.
you will learn the extent of the damage.
but the news can't tell you who survived.
because no one yet knows... For sure.
Oh, susan, thank god you're here.
I was on my way home. I got this text from julie.
she said a plane crashed onto the lane? - Yeah.
a single-engine plane that had to make an emergency landing.
the pilot had a heart attack.
Julie said karl was taken away in an ambulance?
Yeah. He's in surgery.
h-how bad is it?
he's gonna make it, right?
there was a lot of bleeding.
the doctors are doing the best they can.
you want to sit down? Here. H-have a seat.
come here.
was anyone else hurt?
Orson... And mona clarke.
Yeah, they're still in surgery.
Bree got a little banged up, but the nurse says she's gonna be okay.
and little celia might have a concussion.
Oh... What--what happened?
the plane was headed straight for her, and lynette ran over and pushed her out of the way.
you saved her life.
come on. You would have done the same thing for my kids. It's no big deal.
no, lynette, we owe you everything.
so what do we do now?
I guess we just wait and pray.
I think that's a really good idea.
Lynette, are you okay?
I don't know. I just... I have this terrible pain.
the truth is, no one knows who who survived that tragic plane crash...
Oh, tom, i think there's something wrong with the babies.
or more importantly, who didn't.
any word about karl?
uh, still in surgery.
God, i feel like such a hypocrite.
after that guy cheated on you, i hahis guts.
never spoke to him again.
and i was just in the chapel praying for him.
I know what you mean.
it's pretty complicated for me, too.
with that, susan began to think of her marriag karl
how wonderfully it had started...
how they'd been so happy...
until the day she found lipstick where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day she told karl to leave, and she wondered...
what if she hadn't?
wait. Wait! Don't go.
you just kicked me out.
I know.
I put 12 years of my life into this marriage, and we have a daughter.
we owe it to julie to try to work this out.
don't touch me.
you're still a pig.
okay, so, um, if we are gonna put this behind us, i need to know about everyone that you've en with since we were married.
everyone?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Karl, i don't want to be wondering, when we go to a party or a restaurant,"did he sleep with her?
her? Her?
okay. Well, you found out about brandy.
Yes.
it was nice to put the panties with a face.
go on.
well, before her... Let's see... It was amber, the dental hygienist...
Kwan lee, the massage lady...
Oh, remember when we had cable installed, and you wondered why we got so many channels for free?
okay, you know what?
uh, maybe you were right.
it's good to have some srets between a couple.
why don't you just go upstairs and unpack your stuff?
I will learn how to swallow my rage.
you are not gonna regret this.
hey there. I'm mike delfino.
Oh, yes.
we met at, um, mary alice's funeral.
uh, your husband told me you have a clogged sink.
Oh, yeah. Come on in.
so how you liking the neighborhood so far?
I lit. It seems quiet... Friendly.
it is. And safe.
I bet we have the lowest crime rate in america.
you need to get that?
Nah. Let the machine get it.
it's susan and karl.
leave us a message.
Hey, suse. It's me. Listen, i'm gonna be working late.
don't hold dinner for me.
by the way, the switchboard's gonna be closed, so don't bother calling.
love ya.
he's screwing his secretary. - Huh?
my hband.
thinks he's fooling me.
he's not.
I'm sorry.
you know, uh, what would serve him right... To come home and find me in bed with another man.
Yeah, i gotta go. - What's the rush?
well, i've got to get a part at the hardware store.
and they close at 6: 00.
Oh, my god.
am i that undesirable?
no, you're very desirable, uh, i-in--in a big way.
did you just call me fat?
no. No. I-i think you're very beautiful.
it's just... You know, you're married.
right.
um... I'm sorry.
look... If you'runhappy, you should do something about it.
Oh, please. Not another business trip.
Oh, please.
let it be another business trip.
I tried.
I'm sorry.
that's it?
15 years of marriage, and that's all i get-- two lousy sentences?
I don't know what else to say.
I don't know. How about, um,"hey, susan,"thanks for eating nothing but broccoli and colon cleanser "for the last six months so you could lose weight and look good for me"?
Or,"hey, susan, thanks for wasting "the best years of your life while i went out and i banged everything with a g. E.D. And a tramp stamp.
I'm sorry, okay?
but you could've spared yourself all this pain if you'd just let me go the first time.
you really do deserve better, susan.
Mrs. Delfino?
Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my god.
if there's anything you need, we have counselors available.
n-no, i'll--i'll be fine. Thank you.
I can't imagine what you must be feeling.
mostly i'm... I'm feeling grateful.
a b c d e f g
you can get schedud
no deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.
happy?
Karl, you've made me happy in ways i couldn't even imagine.
now if it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind pulling down my zipper with your teeth and taking me on the table?
nag, nag, nag.
what is it with you women once you get a ring on?
mm, and if you're a stickler for tradition, we could always take it up to our bedroom.
Ourbedroom-- i like the sound of that.
well, get used to it... Mm. Because it's going to be our bedroom for a long, long time.
I meant what i said when i proposed.
being with you is gonna make me into a whole different man.
well, i hope not completely different.
I don't ever want to lose that sexy beast who swept me off my feet.
trust me. He's not going anywhere.
honey, that was fantastic.
Oh, my god.
you're supposed to be catering a wedding.
Yes, clearly this is my fault.
Courtney? - I'm so sorry, bree.
really, karl, yoga instructor?
no charge for next month, okay?
like i'm keeping you!
get the hell out of my house.- She--she's going.
I'm not talking toher!
how could you, karl? In our own bed?
Yeah, you're right. That was tacky.
I am so sorry.
Bye. - I'll call you.
what? - Sorry.
uh, force of habit.
look, this thing doesn't have to mean any more than we decide it does.
you made a vow to me, karl.
Oh, my god. Why did i think i could change you?
Yeah, i know.
you thought you could turn me into your personal lapdog, like orson.
you leave orson out of this.
Why? I haven't done a thg to you that you didn't do to him.
get out of my house!
the truth hurts, doesn't it? - Get out.
I didn't know who else to call.
you were his emergency contact.
I'm just a little surprised.
Orson and i hadn't spoken in nearly ten years.
a-are you sure there wasn't someone else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?
never saw one.
in fact, in the seven years he lived here, i never saw anybody visit him at all.
um... Where did you... Find m?
in the bed.
paramedics said it was a heart attack.
he'd been there two days.
can you imagine?
just like that, you're gone, and no one notices?
poor orson.
well, take whatever you want. I'll have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.
you know, he spoke about you constantly.
it was always "bree this," "bree that.
it was almost like he died of... - What?
say it.
like he died of a broken heart.
Mrs. Hodge?
I just wanted to tell you your husband's out of danger.
thank god for that.
but there were some complications.
what kind of complications?
this is a preliminary assessment, but it seems there has been some damage to his spinal column.
what does that mean exactly?
there's a good chance your husband is paralyzed.
excuse me.
can you tell me anything about mona clarke's condition?
the doctors--they did everything they could, but that woman... I mean, she was hit by a plane.
Oh, my god!
now all we can do is wait and hope that she pulls through.
pulls through?
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.
she's hanging in there.
how? She got hit by a plane!
the doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious, but now would be the time to pray.
Oh, believe me, we will.
dear god, please take that blackmailing bitch home now.
a frickin' plane hit her. What is it gonna take, a silver bullet?
all right, look, i'm gonna go home, pack up our stuff. You stay here.
if they pry the propeller out of that woman's mouth and she starts yapping, get the hell outta here.
just like that, angie bolen began to consider what was happening.
she thought of the doctors trying to save mona and how long it might take her to recover.
then she imagined mona waking up... And telling the police everything she knew.
and angie asked herself, what would happen if mona clarke lived?
how about a little lunch, ms. De luca?
eggplant parm.
maybe it's not like the place we used to see you go into on east 10th street, but not bad.
I want to see nick.
he's a little busy at the moment.
I just want to talk to him for a couple minutes.
as far as the bureau is concerned, nick is a traitor.
get used to it. You're never gonna talk to him again.
what about danny?
Tyleris with your mother.
but enough about what you want.
here's what i want-- patrick logan.
you need to be thinking real clear right now.
we know logan ran everything, but without him, it's all gonna fall on you.
I don't know where he is.
I haven't spoken to him since that night.
you've been on the run 18 years, and you and your former lover don't even exchange a phone call, huh?
don't take this personally, agent padilla, but you guys weren't the ones i was running from.
look, i know logan.
I know how scary he is.
but i think the situation you're in now is worse.
then youdon'tknow how scary he is.
federal sentencing guidelines dictate the punishment in this case.
there's no room for leniency from the court.
that being said, ms. De luca, you have indicated that you would like to address the court.
thank you, your honor.
no one... Was supposed to get hurt.
we just believed in something, and we wanted to make other people believe in it, too.
but someone did get hurt.
a man died.
I read every newspaper article about your husband, about sean
Hohe coached little league, that t whole neighborhood came to his funeral.
I never lived in a world like that...
until we moved to fairview.
I never felt like a part of a community, which...
made it so much clearer to me how horrible it is that i brought so much pain to yours.
please rise for sentencing.
angela de luca, you are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
marshals, remand the prisoner to custody.
ma? Ma!
so... How is she?
I'm... I'm so sorry.
she didn't make it.
I know how upset you must be.
please don't be angry with god because your prayers weren't answered.
Oh, don't worry about it, hon.
me and god are good.
I spoke with the doctor. They are goingo keep her overnight for observation.
I thought they said she was fine.
no, they're just being extra cautious. That's all.
look at her.
I feel bad even saying it, with everything's that's happened, but... We really lucked out, huh?
I don't think it was luck.
I think it was god.
actually, it was lynette.
no, lynette was his instrument.
either way, it was a hell of a tune.
no, i'm serious.
I think god saved celia because she's special.
she has a gift.
what kind of gift?
I'm not sure yet.
but she has one.
I know she's gonna do something amazing with her life.
fine. While you figure out how our daughter's gonna change the world, i'm going to the cafeteria.
see you in a few.
as she lay there, gabrielle began to think of ways her daughter could shine.
she thought of music...
and sports...
and other creative pastimes.
and before she drifted off to sleep, gabrielle wondered, what if her daughter was destined to be a great actress?
how old are you?
5
it's our first audition. We're very excited.
well, great. Such a cutie, just what we're looking for.
Oh, she can be cuter.
show him, honey.
good girl.
okay, celia, this is a--here.
this is a commercial for ouch away! Bandages.
stand right there on the "t.
you just got a boo-boo on your finger.
you're gonna hold it up, look real sad and cry, okay?
and go.
no, no. Don't smile, honey.
we need you to cry. Let's try it again.
uh, okay.
thank you-- thank you very much.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
you gotta give her another shot. Please.
I... I love the look, but can i be honest with you, mom?
the side dish that came with my lunch has more talent.
what are you saying?
I'm saying she's not as good as coleslaw. Deal with it.
Hey, that little girl is here for a reason.
she is going to inspire people, and you are gonna be part of that!
all right. Well, hurry up.
all right. Hey, i got you another chance.
can you cry for mommy?
sure you can.
when that nice casting man asks you to hold up a finger, just hold it up and cry.
how easy is that?
Hello?
what?
Oh, my god.
daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.
and... When he fell, he landed on your hamster cage and crushed mr. Mcfuzz.
he iad. Mr. Mcfuzz is dead.
okay.
roll it.
Gaby, i'm going to take celia for an ice cream!
be back in a bit!
come on.
the bus for camp leaves in 20 minutes.
but what about my auditions?
mommy's gonna kill us.
Hey, let me handle mommy.
you need a sleeping bag to get ice cream?
run!
leave it. Leave it! Leave it!
what the hell are you doing? We talked about this.
no summer camp. She's got auditions.
Gaby, you have got her living in this weird little bubble, and she needs to be around kids her own age.
she will be. I'm taking her to a casting call for "annie.
why can't you support her career?
Celia, will you wait in the car, plse?
thank you, sweetie.
because she stinks.
that little girl is destined for greatness. That is why god saved her.
God does not save people who stink.
Yeah, well, maybe god saved her so that she could go to camp and make some friends and have a normal childhood!
who would believe in a god like that?
Gaby, she's misee.
no, she's not. She wants this.
no, she does it to please you!
that is a horrible thing to say. I am not hurting her.
in fact, making her shine is my life's work.
all i want is for people to understand how special she is.
Celia, get in the house! - Celia, wait.
I'm sorry, but you have clearly lost your mind, and i'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.
if you don't like it, leave.
Gaby, be careful what you say, because i am very close to going.
see ya. Come on.
let's go get ready for your audition.
you're gonna be the best annie ever.
there you go, sweetie.
all better.
Ouch away! Adhesive bandages... They heal with a mother's love.
ma, no.
look at that face.
that's a star.
you're not watching this again.
now please, help me with the groceries.
did you get my wrinkle cream?
you can't buy stuff like that with food stamps.
I know. I just wish you loved me enough to steal it.
Hello?
Jerry, sweetie.
honey, it's your agent.
Oh, celia's dying to work.
what do you got for us?
Oh, come on. There's gotta be something.
no, no. She's not too old.
she can pass for 15.
hell, i'm looking at her right now.
okay, we'll be there.
baby, we've got an audition.
and we gotta get that hair into pigtails.
ma, i think we need to talk.
what did i dowith those ace bandages?
we gotta flatten you down.
listen to me.
I don't want to be an actress.
what? You can't quit. You're...
I'm special. This is my destiny.
it's why i was spared.
you spent the last 20 years telling me i'm meant for big things.
and you are.
no.
I'm not special. I'm normal.
and i just want to have a normal life-- get married, have kids.
and there's gonna be plenty of time for that.
you always say that.
why can't you admit it's over?
because if we give up, then everything i've worked for is for nothing.
your father walked out. Your sister never calls.
this is all i have.
what time's the audition?
tomorrow, 3:00.
now let's do something about this hair.
Oh, honey, this is the one. I feel it.
one day you're gonna thank me.
I brought you coffee.
so have you figured out what our 4-year-old is gonna do with her life?
no.
but i did figure out what she has to do to be special.
what's that?
absolutely nothing.
how could this happen? I know i fell, but i felt fine afterwards.
it doesn't take much to cause a tear to the placenta.
but you said the one baby is fine?
Yes, but if we don't operate on the other one, there could be a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which could put the child at risk developmentally.
at risk how? Physically? Mentally?
right now there's no way to know.
how soon can we do the surgery?
we're ready to go.
let's get her in.
at that moment, lynette began to think of the baby she had yet to meet.
she thought of what it would be like to hold him, how it would feel to look into his eyes...
and to kiss his tiny hand.
and then lynette thought ofhat would happen if the doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.
he especially hates the hamstring stretches.
well, and obviously it's hard to hear him cry, but you really need to tune it out, because without the therapy, his muscle tone will...
you try. Maybe it's me.
sometimes it helps to sing to them.
Oh, i do that. He loves it when i do that.
and the sailor said,"brandy, you're a fine girl
what a good wife you would be
why don't we take a break?
maybe we should take some time and talk about where we're at.
where we're at is we haven't seen any milestones since august.
not since he finally started grabbing his feet.
but that was a big one. - Definitely.
but he should be sitting by now, right?
or pulling to stand or crawling.
if you worry too much about whathe suld be able to do by now or what other kids his age are doing, it's gonna drive you crazy.
fine.
I know i keep saying this, but try to focus on the progress he's making.
like what?
you're with him every day.
you tell me.
what do you see?
would you, um, excuse us for a second? - It's okay.
what is it?
I can't do this. - Can't do what?
this, her, the therapy, and the injections and the equipment.
and no one can even tell us if any of it is helping.
I think it is.
but even if it isn't, this is what there is to do, so we're doing it.
well, i can't.
no, you don't want to.
neither do i.
neither does he. Didn't you hear him crying in there?
but we don't have a choice. So come on.
Jean's gotta go home soon.
I feel like i'm being punished, and i don't even know what i did.
you can't think that way.
what else is there to think about?
hopes for the future?
he might not even have one.
he's 14 months. Don't write him off yet!
but you should start thinking about the future, because no matter what, it's coming.
and it's either gonna make you less afraid or more, and you willnow that you either did everything that you can for your son...
or you will be sorry.
Yeah. There we go.
I know.
come here.
it's okay.
I can do this.
Hi, honey.
can i have a sandwich?
uh, sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.
but i'm hungry.
well, unless you want soap on rye, you're gonna have to wait.
actually, why don't you make yourself a sandwich?
but youalwaysdo it.
and you always watch me, so i know you know how.
I'm tired.
so am i, and i still have to vacuum and do the laundry.
my arms hurt.
I had to swim today.
and you do that so you can get stronger, so you can do things like make sandwiches.
speaking of which, in the time we've been arguing about this, you could've--guess what-- made a sandwich.
so could you!
Jason's mom makes him whatever food he wants, even french toast.
I would happy to make jason french toast, too.
he always tells me how pretty i am.
not to mention, he's also in a wheelchair, so he can't reach the shelves in the fridge.
but you can!
too bad you don't appreciate it.
you're not-- you're not really busy!
you just don't want to help me!
you know what? One day i won't be able to help you because i won't be here, and then maybe you'll understand why i wanted you to learn to do stuff for yourself!
or you won't!
but either way, i'm not making you a sandwich.
that looks good.
can i have a bite?
when i was bn, my doctor told my parents i wouldn't make it through the night, then through the week, then it was that i was blind, that i'd need a wheelchair.
I guess what i'm saying is... I've really pissed my doctors off.
at first, my mother was scared
scared of my disability, my limitations.
I know this because she told me.
then she realized what she was really scared of, was my potential and that she's miss something that would help me reach it.
gandhi said,"strength... "does not come from a physical capacity.
it comes from an indomitable will.
my mother's probably never heard that saying...
but every day of my life, she showed me how true it is.
now i... I hope i can start showing her.
thank you.
thank you all very much.
how's our baby?
is he okay?
we lost the baby.
but... The other baby is fine.
it's okay.
we're gonna be okay.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q
in the wake of a tragedy, a daughter was safe...
you saved her life. We owe you everything.
Orson was changed...
there's a good chance your husband's paralyzed.
an unborn twin was gone......
we lost the baby...
but the other baby is fine.
and an ex-husband... - Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my god. - was dead.
a month after the death of Karl Mayer, his family assembled for the reading of his will.
to each, Karl left something to remember him by.
to his great aunt, he left a grand piano.
to his favorite cousin, he left gold cuff links.
to his beloved daughter, he left cash and securities.
but Karl Mayer left his most extraordinary possession of all to someone who wasn't expecting a thing.
and finally, to my ex-wife, Susan Mayer...
Hey, that's me.
Oh, I. I. I was just here to support my daughter.
seriously, I've been playing Hangman on my phone.
you were saying?
to my dearest Susie Q.
who endured my infidelities far longer than she should have, years of cheating, betrayals almost from the day we were married...
can we just skip to the part where I get stuff?
Oh, don't look at me like that. You got the piano.
while I was never good at hiding my affairs of the flesh,
I'm ashamed to say that I was more successful - at concealing some of my financial affairs." - What does that mean?
I think dad hid money from you when you were married.
well, it's not money, exactly.
it seems your ex-husband was part owner in a business.
he was having affairs, ran a law firm and he owned a secret business?
glad you're finally getting a little rest.
now he specifically asks that you keep an open mind.
it's very successful.
well, if it's so successful, why do I need to keep an open mind?
Yes, Karl Mayer left his ex-wife something to remember him by...
not that there was any chance she would forget him.
all kinds of men go to the Double D gentlemen's club.
frat boys looking for a thrill...
soldiers looking to get lucky...
ceos looking to close a deal.
Yes, all kinds of men go to Double D's, which can be very upsetting to all kinds of women.
Jimbo Rooney, co-owner of Double D's.
uh, look, I was real sad to hear about Karl's passing.
he was a good man, and he cared about each and every one of these dancers.
Oh, I'm sure.
Karl was always a big supporter of the arts.
uh, so who do I speak to about selling my share of herpes on parade?
are you sure you want to do that?
now business has been real good lately, especially since we started topless karaoke Tuesdays.
well, as lucrative an enterprise as that seems...
take a look around. Have a drink.
and then if you want to sell, you have your lawyer call me.
Oh. Look at that.
you made the o's in "Rooney" into boobs.
lovely.
you like that?
wait till you see my partner Vic's business card.
he took the "v" and he made it into a...
got it. I think I'd really like that drink now.
Oh, um, thanks.
but I... I'm not here for the show.
I just found out that I own half this place.
Oh, no kidding. Well, nice to meet you.
I'm Jennifer Morelli, but at 10: 00, I'm "Destiny."
Oh, well, I'm Susan Delfino.
at 10: 00, I am in a flannel nightgown.
Hey, we have a Delfino that comes in here.
Really?
well, it's a pretty common name.
I think he's a plumber. - Really?
well, maybe there's another plumber with that last name.
Mike... That's it. Mike Delfino.
tall guy, brown hair, nice smile?
big busted nose?
Oh, I don't think so.
well, wait till the next time you see him.
a TV? You guys didn't have to do that.
Yes, we absolutely did. We have a family rule...
you saved our daughter from being squashed by a plane, you get a 60-inch plasma.
and a faux leather remote caddy. - Oh, thanks.
this is very generous. - Please. We could never make up for what you did.
or for how I behaved toward you the past couple of weeks.
I was such a bitch. - Oh, we both said things.
Yeah, but I said a lot worse, a lot louder.
Yeah, you did.
by the way, I talked to human resources, and they are fine with continuing to pay you - until the baby is born and for six weeks after that. - Carlos, that's amazing.
so will Terrence fill in until I get back?
actually, no. He took the job in Miami. - So who's gonna take up the slack?
well, I'll put in extra hours, work weekends.
don't worry about it. You focus on that baby.
Really? I don't want to have this fall on you. - Carlos, we gotta get going.
we've got Juanita's interview at Oakridge.
Oh, right. Lynette, do not worry. I got your back. - But I feel so guilty taking your money and leaving you in the lurch.
Hey, I got a crazy idea. What if I fill in for Lynette?
Oh, honey, they're in a hurry. No time for jokes.
I'm serious. I... I've done her job...
or pretty damn similar... when I was in advertising.
I could step in for her until she gets back on her feet.
Oh, but that's putting Carlos in an awkward position.
I think it's a great idea. - Me, too.
no. No, I think it's a great idea, in theory, but it's just... It's such a complicated job.
you don't think I can handle it?
no. No, I think you'd be wonderful.
great, it's settled then. Tom, you start tomorrow. - There you go, Lynette.
now you have nothing to feel guilty about.
right. Right.
well, thanks again for the TV.
you guys have been way too generous.
you made scones. My favorite.
I know. Take as many as you like.
so... What did you want to see me about?
well, I wanted to give you this donation for the building fund. - Oh.
and I also have some things in the garage for the rummage sale, and I am also available to run the next Sunday school pancake breakfast.
Oh, good heavens.
Bree, what a wonderful display of Christian charity.
I just want to do my part.
does this have anything to do with the plane crash?
in a manner of speaking.
do you want to talk about it?
I can't. It would change how you feel about me.
Bree, I've known you for years. I don't think that's possible.
I had an affair.
are you okay?
um, before you confess a sin that big, just try to wait till I've swallowed.
Oh.
who was the affair with?
he was killed in the plane crash...
the same one that injured Orson.
you must feel terribly guilty about this.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
that's why I wanted you to come over here.
I have to do something to make this right.
well, seems to me the first step is for you and Orson to get into our marriage outreach program.
Oh, it's too late for that. We're about to get a divorce.
Yes, but this was before Orson was in a wheelchair, right?
well, yes.
I think you know what you need to do to atone for this sin.
I think you knew it before I walked in the door.
you want me to bring Orson home and take care of him?
it's just that I'm not sure that I love him anymore.
there's a quote I've always loved.
you cannot make yourself feel something that you do not feel, " but you can make yourself do right in spite of your feelings.
I don't remember that from the bible.
it's from Pearl Buck.
I am allowed to read other books, you know.
Bree, no matter what you feel about Orson, if you don't help him now, you won't be able to live with yourself.
fine.
I'll tell Orson tomorrow, and I'll bring him home.
good.
Mmm!
I think you've had enough.
Julie! Hold up. - Hey. What's going on?
Eddie's doing stand-up at the Chuckle Zone on open Mike night.
stand-up? As in comedy?
well, people are always telling me how funny I am, so I decided to give the people what they want.
don't miss out. I got this whole riff about airline food.
it's gonna kill.
Hey, Porter! Hold up!
when people tell him he's funny, doesn't he realize - they're being funny? - Tell me you're going. I can't be the only one there.
I'll... I'll try. I, uh, I actually gotta pack.
my dad left me some money, so I'm going back east to see my cousins. - For how long?
until they catch the guy who attacked me,
I just don't feel safe here.
I get that. - Hmm.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
I... I heard you were in the hospital because of an overdose.
you didn't do that
because of...
I was dealing with a lot of stuff...
problems with my parents having to move again.
I got really lonely.
and yeah, I guess you were part of it.
I'm better now.
good.
life has its low points, and we just have to deal with them.
speaking of which,
how do we get out of this?
well, your timing is impeccable, because it just so happens that we have an opening right on.
Yes, we heard, and we're so excited.
everyone knows that this is the best private school in town.
it says here that you have been homeschooling Juanita.
how's that been going?
it's been so rewarding spending time with my little angel.
it breaks my heart to see it end.
anyway, here's her lunch. It's all packed.
and we'll pick her up at 4: 00.
uh, wait... wait just a second.
there are a few other families on the waiting list before you.
Oh, there are?
Yes, but Susan Delfino gave you such a glowing recommendation.
and to be quite frank,
we could use a little more diversity in this school.
it's been quite a long time since we've had a little girl of Mexican descent.
Ah, well, we are very proud of our heritage...
but Juanita can stand on her own merits.
she's very bright. - And I know I'm biased, but I do think she's a budding young genius.
I'm Mexican?
honey, what did you just say?
he called me Mexican.
you are Mexican, honey. You know that.
since when? I thought we were American.
Yes, but our ancestors came from Mexico.
Really? So we're like those people who sell oranges on the side of the road?
you're busy. We should go.
thank you so very much for your time.
and, uh, again, we really want to join you here and help you with that diversity thing, so just let us know.
just say it. - I don't even know what that means.
just say it!
Adios, senior.
this is fine.
thank you.
thank you for agreeing to see me.
I called a few times, but you, uh, didn't pick up.
I had no idea.
my phone was in my pants pocket, and I had it on vibrate.
and as you may have noticed, I...
so how's rehab?
painful.
well, the doctor says with a lot of hard work, you maybe be able to walk again someday.
Yes, they're very upbeat and optimistic.
I want to run them over with this chair.
so...
why are you here?
well, I know we've been through a lot lately, but I decided it would be best for you to come home so I can take care of you.
Yes, I'd rather be cared for by a flatulent helper monkey.
Orson, I know you're angry, but I'm still your wife. - Well, apparently we have very different definitions of the word "wife.
I am proceeding with the divorce. - I don't understand.
three weeks ago you were begging me for another chance.
what happened?
Karl Mayer happened.
I could forgive you if you betrayed me with anyone remotely admirable, but you chose the most contemptible man I have ever known.
no, Bree,
I do not need you.
I'm having a ramp built at the house, and I've turned the downstairs study into your bedroom.
you're coming home where you belong, and that's all there is to it.
you can start forgiving me, and I'll start forgiving you.
I suggest you start first.
I don't understand. How could you not know you're Mexican?
we eat Mexican food all the time.
we eat Chinese food, too. Does that mean I'm Chinese?
no, that just means your mother hates to cook.
well, apparently, we have to spell everything out for you.
you do know you're a girl, right? - Gaby.
what? Half the women in your family have mustaches.
it could be very confusing.
Juanita, go inside and play with your sister.
and while you're at it, tell her she's Mexican, too!
I can't believe it.
we had that school right in our hands.
how could we let it get away? - The bigger question is how did we let our daughter - grow up thinking she's white? - Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Solis.
Hey, Parker.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up some lumber to build that ramp for Orson.
Oh, what a good person you are.
Hey, I need to pay the paperboy tomorrow.
do you have any cash? - I think I have a $20 on me.
wouldn't you rather...
stick it in here?
couldn't we just leave it in the mailbox, - like we usually do? - Oh, I just thought that's the way you do it down at Double D's.
double D's? - Yeah, turns out Karl was a part owner and left me his share.
by the way, "Destiny" says hello.
okay. I see where you're going with this.
do you, Mike Delfino?
that's what she calls you, you know.
because that's my name.
no one hanging from a pole should know your name.
Susan, that place is one of my accounts.
I'm their plumber.
and that's it?
you go there just to do the plumbing and nothing else? - Well...
liar! Destiny said you had a beer there the other night.
okay.
sometimes when I finish the job, I'll have a beer.
and you never look at the girls?
it's... it's... it's completely innocent.
I... I... I don't buy that.
I want to see the "completely innocent" look you have when Destiny shakes her tassels in your face.
okay, so I've gone to a strip club.
are we gonna laugh about this, or you gonna make it a thing?
well, I am leaning towards "thing." - Fine. If it bothers you that much, next time I finish a job there, I'll come right home.
Oh, you don't have to worry, because you will not be working there anymore. I forbid it.
you forbid it?
what kind of marriage is this?
the kind where the husband wants to look at strippers and the wife forbids it.
Susan, I love you.
I have never cheated on you and I never will.
but you're not gonna tell me what I can or can't do.
let me get this straight...
you forbid Mike from going to a strip club?
I know it was a little heavy-handed, - but I just can't stand those places. - Oh, what's the big whoop?
Carlos takes clients to the strip club all the time.
I've been to one... The ass menagerie.
it was my brother's bachelor party.
this stripper named Cinnamon gave me a lap dance.
luckily, if I squinted just enough, she looked like a young Ricky Schroder.
see, this is the reason men go to those places......
so they can fantasize. We all do it. - You fantasize about other men when you're with Carlos?
honey, Carlos has been so many different men,
I'm actually surprised when I open my eyes and it's Carlos.
want to know who I fantasize about?
no, not necessarily. Anyone want more wine?
Tom Scavo.
wine now.
4th of July barbecue.
those tan shorts.
Oh, I am there right now. Ooh!
okay, could we please get back to the issue at hand?
look, bottom line is you cannot forbid a man to go to strip clubs.
and don't expect him to understand why it bothers you.
that's just the way they are. Right?
sorry. I was just imagining Ricky Schroder...
wearing Tom Scavo's shorts.
are you sure you want to just give away your CDs?
the more you take, the less I have to pack.
in fact, is there anything else you want? - Anything?
okay. How about... Danny Bolen?
uh, he's not really mine to give.
come on. He's totally into you, which is a complete mystery to me.
you know what? I think I'm just gonna keep my CDs.
okay, I... I didn't mean it like that.
it's just you don't seem interested, - and I have sent every signal I can think of. - Why are you so hung up on Danny?
hello. He's hot.
okay, here's the thing...
Danny's in kind of a fragile place right now.
he really doesn't need to get his heart broken.
I'm not gonna snag him just to toss him aside.
I don't use people, Julie.
okay, I used some people.
but I wouldn't use him.
are you sure?
Yeah. I think we have a lot in common, and if he'd just spend a little time with me, he'd realize that.
you like stand-up comedy?
Yeah.
too bad. We're gonna go see Eddie.
Hey, honey. - Hey.
sorry I'm late.
how was work?
crazy.
I had three conference calls and a 2-hour client meeting with Gary Danner.
Oh. - Mm. How was your day?
even crazier.
I peed twice in every bathroom in the house.
what's that?
Oh, little matching outfits for the twins that people gave us.
I thought I'd give them to charity.
I ran into the Petersons today.
they just heard, wanted to see how you were.
Mm.
so Gary Danner......
he's a prickly S.O.B.
tell me about it.
check out this proposal I worked up for him.
hmm.
what do you mean, "hmm"?
I'm glad you showed this to me. I know Danner.
and trust me, you do not want to go down this road. - Why not?
don't worry. I can fix it. Where's a pen? - Wait, honey, a-actually...
I showed it to Danner today. He loved it.
Gary Danner liked this?
no, he loved it,
but not as much as Carlos. He told me it was the best written proposal he has ever seen, bar none.
what's for dinner?
meat loaf.
Mmm.
what's wrong?
nothing. It's j... well, that's quite a compliment.
Yeah. - Not to mention a bit of a slam on the work that I did.
honey, he's just encouraging me.
I don't think he was thinking about you at all. - Oh. Okay.
by the way, this meat loaf...
the best I have ever tasted.
bar none? - Hmm?
just eat.
Wow. It's coming along beautifully.
Thanks. So, uh, when's Orson coming home?
Oh, uh, it's still a bit up in the air.
but I guess now would be a good time to call him
and let him know we're almost ready.
uh, yes. Orson Hodge's room, please.
would you stop hammering for a moment?
he checked out?
but that's impossible. Where would he have gone?
Mike, please. - It's not me.
never mind. I think I found him.
Oh, boy. The fat's in the fire now.
what is going on here?
the husband you're divorcing has found new digs.
before you jump down my throat...
Roy and I are on fixed incomes.
you can't blame us for taking in a boarder, especially one who can't get to the second story.
that's our naked floor.
what are you doing here?
enjoying my new home.
it's rather quaint, once you get used to the smell of denture cream and scotch.
Oh, don't mind me.
just making sure you don't slap a guy in a wheelchair.
so how are you planning to pay your rent?
well, I'm a bit cash-strapped at the moment.
but Karen knows I'm good for it.
Yeah, once he gets his divorce settlement, he's writing me a big, fat check.
so how long are we talking? A month, two?
there will be no divorce, and if he tries to file for one, there will be delays, motions and appeals.
it could take years for him to ever see a dime.
your wife loves you. Go home.
Bree, stop right now. Do you hear me?
so am I taking down the ramp?
leave it.
you'll need it soon enough.
almost home, dear.
Mike, call the police. My wife is holding me hostage!
we've all been there, big guy.
I had an appointment with my o.b. Around the corner, - and I just thought I'd stop by and say hi. - Oh.
I also wanted to thank you for being so nice to Tom, our little temp.
how's he doing? - He's amazing.
it's okay, Carlos. You can tell me the truth.
he's knocking my socks off. Everybody is so impressed.
well, good.
good, good, good.
I'm so proud of him.
but when I drop this kid, Tom's out on his ass, right?
excuse me?
I love him and I'm glad he's doing well here, but this is my job.
at some point, I'm gonna want it back.
and I say that as the woman who dove in front of a spinning propeller to save your child's life.
of course this is your job.
and you can have it back any time you want.
well, that's all I needed to hear.
it's just that I was under the impression you were planning to stay at home with your baby.
and why would you be under that impression?
that's what Tom said.
what exactly did Tom say?
Lynette, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
Carlos, I saved a member of your family.
it doesn't mean I can't take another one out.
and... and... And you can train a dog to do almost anything, but you can't do, um, you can't do with cats and... Cats.
and did you ever try to get a cat to fetch?
they're like, you know, they won't do it.
stupid cats. Am I right, people?
well... Well, hey, you guys have been great.
good night.
give it up for Eddie Orlofsky. Come on, folks!
Yeah! Whoo!
so, what do you think?
I never realized there were so many differences between dogs and cats.
that's why I'm the comic, babe.
I'm off to get my free drink.
I left my jacket in the car. Walk me out?
jacket? It's hot as hell in here.
Ooh. Now I feel a chill.
Mm-hmm.
um... I gotta use the bathroom.
okay, what is your problem?
excuse me?
whenever we're alone together, you find some reason to bail.
why aren't you into me?
ana, there's not a lot of room to be into you.
because of how much you're into you.
you did not just call me conceited.
chill. It's not like I asked you to spell it.
I'm not stupid, and I am definitely not the attention whore at this table.
I heard about your little stunt with the pills.
okay, that was mean.
I'm sorry that I said that.
don't be sorry.
you're right.
I like the blunt Ana more than the cute Ana.
so...
you think I'm cute?
you're home. Perfect timing.
margaritas. What's the occasion?
we're getting drunk, Mexican style.
principal Hobson just called, and Juanita got accepted to Oakridge.
Seriously?
I am free from homeschooling.
no more fighting, no more threats, and no more parent-teacher conferences with you.
Mmm.
Ahh. Come on. Start guzzling'.
uh, I don't think she should go.
huh? - I've been thinking about it all day.
let's keep her in public school.
we can't. She was expelled. - I made some calls.
Jefferson elementary can take her.
that's way out in my pleasant.
Yeah, and there's a lot of Latino families - that live in that area. - So what?
we have a much better school right here in our backyard.
I'm not schlepping way over there just so she can be with those people.
those" people? Don't you mean our people?
our people are the rich private school people.
Oh, my God. I know exactly what is going on here.
what? You are ashamed of being Mexican.
Oh, that's insane. - No, it totally makes sense.
all of our friends are white.
you didn't want me to teach the girls Spanish.
because I don't understand it, and I didn't want you guys plotting behind my back.
and when we bought this house, and I said we would be the only Mexicans in the neighborhood, do you remember what you said?
fine by me. - You're right. It's my fault.
I should have told the realtor, "forget square footage and central air.
find us something next door to a Mariachi bar.
deny it all you want. You are a self-hating Mexican.
Oh, yeah, well, you're a self-wiping Mexican.
what does that mean?
Hey, you.
traffic was insane.
is there any dinner left? I haven't eaten since lunch.
everything okay?
I talked to Carlos today.
about what?
he was under the impression that when I have this baby,
I'll be staying home with her.
where would he get a crazy idea like that?
I told him.
Wow! You're not even denying it?
I thought it might be in your best interest.
Seriously?
you know how much that job means to me.
you know how much I hate being a stay-at-home Mom.
how could you think I'd be okay with this?
because we lost a baby.
honey, I thought you might want to stay home with this one, because she's all the more precious, given what happened.
Oh.
so that's how I'm supposed to feel.
I don't know how you feel Lynette, because you never talk about it.
it's been a month. Every time I try to bring it up, - you just... you change the subject. - Because I'm dealing with it.
well, shouldn't we be dealing with it together?
you want to talk about this?
Yes! - Fine! We lost a kid we'll never meet him.
we'll spend the rest of our lives looking at one, always wondering why there aren't two.
how can saying this out loud be helpful?
you're right. It's not.
you win.
after you have the baby, go back to your job.
thank you.
you want me to fix you something?
I'm not... I'm not hungry anymore.
now remember, fellas, these ladies don't work for free.
Hey, Rooney.
Oh, hey, Mike. Long time no see.
Yeah, I got the call about your John being backed up.
what? No, our bathrooms are working just fine.
that's weird. Some woman called and said it was an emergency.
I'm sorry, man. I... I don't know what to tell you.
all right, it's time to introduce our newest double D doll...
miss Fix-it!
what the hell?
Mike! What are you doing here?
what the hell are you doing?
Oh, well, since I'm one of the owners,
I figured I should really learn the business, from my bottom up.
Hey, you mind?
I'm trying to make a deposit here.
Hey! - Will you come down from there right now?
Why? They're just looking. It's completely innocent.
right?
Hey, pal. Sit down.
I didn't come here to see the back of your head.
this is not funny.
Oh, I can't talk.
I've got a room full of Neanderthals to entertain.
whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
just giving people what they want.
don't you dare. Susan, I'm serious.
I want you off of that stage right now.
wait. Are you forbidding me from doing something?
I thought we didn't have that kind of marriage.
very cute. If I have to, I will carry you out of here myself.
Oh, what exactly is the problem, Mike?
Oh!
okay. I get it.
I will never come back here.
Aw! Come on!
let's go home, Mrs. Fix-it.
wait. Wait. Forgot my tips!
what are you looking at?
nothing. Just some old photos.
I didn't know you had these.
we couldn't afford frames, so my dad would put these on the wall with tape.
is that you?
Yeah. I was about 5.
you're cute. - Hmm.
but that toolshed's seen better days.
that was our house.
Wow.
it's funny.
I'm smiling in all of these photos, but...
I hated that town.
everybody was so poor. Everybody was Mexican.
back then I thought they were the same thing.
and even though I was only 5, I knew I wanted out.
and you can call it self-loathing, Carlos, but I just...
don't want my kids to ever know I lived like that.
that's your dad.
Yeah.
he was so strong.
I would run to meet him when he'd come home from working in the factories, and he'd lift me up on his shoulders.
I loved that.
I bet he did, too.
I used to ask him, "Papa, why do you work so much?
and he would say, "so one day we can live in a beautiful house.
but we never did.
but you do now.
your father had dreams, Gaby, but they were for you, and he sacrificed a lot to get you here.
whatever our children achieve in life, it's because of dreams that started on the shoulders of a proud, strong, Mexican man.
that is why I want our kids to know where they came from.
I want that, too.
so, um...
how do your physical therapists think you're doing?
do they think you're making progress?
Orson, it's been three days.
you're gonna have to talk to me sometime.
I know why you're doing this, Bree.
Reverend Sykes stopped by to check on my progress.
he was very proud of himself for convincing you to take me on as charity work.
it's not charity work.
when I had that affair, I didn't just betray you.
I betrayed my faith as well.
so please, you have to let me help you or I am gonna...
or you won't get into heaven?
didn't realize how much this means to you.
I guess I can find a way to be happy.
thank you so much, Orson.
I am gonna take such good care of you.
by the way, my soup is cold.
Oh.
well, mine is hot.
you can have this.
Oh, while you're up, could you get me a glass of wine?
Yes, of course.
and perhaps for dessert, some of your delicious Creme brulee.
Orson, that takes over an hour to prepare. I...
well, I would do it myself, but...
Oh, and we're out of vanilla beans.
you might have to run to the store.
the act itself is quite simple...
you strip away the outer layer and reveal what's underneath.
of course, sometimes the results can be quite surprising.
if you strip away the veneer of happy domesticity, you may find grief.
if you strip away that facade of wealth, you may find self-loathing.
if you strip away the veil of helplessness, you may find cruelty.
Yes, stripping can be a dangerous pastime.
but for a lucky few, it can also be...
a lot of fun.
a friend was welcomed back.
I told them how much better you were doing.
a marriage was on the mend.
I would like to recapture what we once had.
Gaby and Carlos discovered a secret. - You are gettin' sloppy!
and if people start pokin' around, we're done.
and Susan made a request.
you're asking if I'm okay with letting a stripper live with us?
the first thing you need to know about Robin Gallagher was that everyone liked to look at her.
they would stare at her legs...
and her breasts...
and her hair.
and once they were done, people would begin to ask...
who is this? - This is my friend Robin.
hello there. - Mike had to work today, - so I thought I'd bring her as my plus one. - Hello there.
you already said that.
I wanted her to know I meant it.
it's really good to have you back on the lane, Katherine.
it's great to be back. I didn't know what to expect at first. I have wondered how everyone would feel about me, if they were really ready to welcome me back. I guess there's always that fear that people are going to reject you.
do I smell appetizers? - I know I do.
Hello, Susan!
who's your new friend?
Robin, this is Carlos, Tom, Roy and Orson.
hope you got all that, 'cause there's gonna be a quiz later.
Oh, god.
so, Robin, welcome to my humble abode.
thank you.
it's so suburban.
I've never been in a place where the ceilings were so tall.
fascinating. Just fascinating.
you live in the city?
I did, but I'll be living with Susan for a while.
I just moved in today.
Susan, let's get you a drink.
Oh, no, that's okay. I'll wait till... Oh!
so...
so how did you meet Susan?
so... You want to tell us about your new friend or, uh, should I say "roommate"?
she was down on her luck and she needed a place to stay.
Plus, I feel responsible, - because I told her to give up her job. - What was wrong with her job?
well... we probably don't need to let the guys in on this, - but... Robin was... - That's wild!
so you used to be a stripper?
yes...
everyone liked to look at Robin Gallagher...
but not everyone liked what they saw.
later, while the men of Wisteria Lane were trying the shrimp, their wives were trying to control themselves.
you moved a stripper into the neighborhood?
what were you thinking? - You guys aren't even taking the time to get to know her.
our husbands are in there pooling together - their dollar bills. What more do we need to know? - I just met Robin. She seems great.
did she mention that she's a stripper?
did she have to?
look, I am just trying to help her get back on her feet.
I bet that'd be a nice change for her. - She is living in my house.
if anybody should be worried, it'd be me, and I am not threatened by her at all.
Really?
Yes. She's a nice girl.
Yeah, nice, blonde, and you can bounce a quarter off her ass.
I'm telling you, she's trouble. - Here's a good thing...
she can't bring any more crazy to this street than I did.
let's give her a chance. - I agree.
Robin's probably had a tough life, and she needs our help. - Well, I'm all for being open-minded, but I have teenage boys at home.
the last thing I need next door is a stripper.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. We're picking up Parker for school.
please come in. I'll get him for you.
so you ever gonna get back to folding the laundry?
well, I thought I'd treat myself and wash the breakfast dishes first.
well, you started this. Don't you think you should finish?
well, since you're so passionate about it...
knock yourself out.
okay, you just went from jerk to adorable real quick.
happy anniversary.
Oh! Mm. Mm.
Mmm. Mmm.
it's the ring!
Oh, you went back to that antique shop.
Yep.
Oh, thank you! Mwah.
wait till you see your present.
you can unwrap it tonight when the kids are asleep.
or how about after they leave for school?
okay.
Hey, why are they still up there and why can't I hear them?
Hey, boys.
what's going on?
uh, we're late for school.
Oh!
Oh, hey, Lynette.
Hi. The next time you take a shower, do you think you could close your blinds?
I have a 16-year-old son, and he has friends.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. You may have retired from the strip club, but you're still doing seven shows a week.
I mean, at least they didn't have to pay a cover charge, right?
this is a nice community.
you have a responsibility to the neighbors, especially the ones with innocent children.
well, they're not all so innocent.
excuse me?
yesterday that son of yours asked me if I would have sex with him.
Parker?
my Parker?
red hair, skinny, still-sleeps-in-a-bed-shaped-like-a-racecar Parker?
of course I said no.
then he offered me cash.
Hey.
come in.
have a seat.
what's up?
something wrong?
we hoped it would be another year before we had the parent-son conversation where we tell you not to offer your neighbor money for sex.
but...
Oh, crap. She told?
Yeah.
you might want to pick a more discreet stripper next time.
what were you thinking?
we raised you better than that. Didn't we? - Yeah, we did.
we did. So... what do you have to say for yourself?
I just really, really, really...
needed to have sex.
three "reallys." well, in that case,
here's a $20. Go back and try again.
you are a 16-year-old boy.
we understand your hormones are holding your brain hostage, but why would you think you would need to pay for sex?
because I'm the only one of my friends - who hasn't lost his virginity. - Oh. First of all, we've seen your friends, and trust me, "pimples," "braces
and "beam me up, Scotty" are not gettin' any.
girls don't look at me that way.
it's never gonna happen.
Hey.
knock it off!
you are a great kid!
you don't need to pay for it.
in a few years, when you're emotionally ready,
you'll meet the right girl, and you will have tons of sex.
after you're married.
okay, Dad.
sorry.
nice job.
thank you.
you think he bought it?
bought what?
you know.
Mnh-mnh.
guys always pay for sex in some way...
I mean, dinner, flowers...
antique rings.
whoa. Whoa.
you think that's the only reason we're having sex tonight?
of course not. It's our anniversary.
it's a given, like turkey on thanksgiving.
although I am hoping that the ring gets me an upgrade from missionary.
forget about upgrades. You just got bumped off the flight.
honey, wh... why are you getting so upset?
because I didn't know I was married to such a cynical lug nut.
wait. Are we really not gonna have sex tonight?
don't worry, Tom.
in a few years, when you're emotionally ready, you're gonna have tons of sex.
come on!
so you really like that ring?
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
do you read the inscription? "To my darling..."
we're not having sex, Tom.
Oh, come on. Why not?
because I am still upset by what you said.
do you really think women only sleep with men if they buy them things?
no. I think supermodels sleep with 80-year-old millionaires because they love to hear stories about when bread was 5 cents a loaf.
well, I'm not a model, and you're no millionaire, so I'm thinking you owe me an apology.
you and I went to Marley's Tavern on our first two dates, and I could barely get past a good night kiss.
but third time out, I dropped 200 bucks at La Rive Gauche, and bam! You finally put out.
finally made love.
listen, you idiot!
I did not "put out" because you bought me an expensive dinner.
I did it because you showed up for the date with a lightbulb to replace the one that had burned out in the hallway to my apartment. Remember?
Oh. - You said I didn't live in the best neighborhood.
and I was worried about you.
bingo. I was ready to do you right then and there.
Really?
that's all it takes?
me showing you I care?
cause that's easy.
and now it's time for your anniversary present.
Whoo!
Hey, Robin.
remember the other day when I told you this was a nice neighborhood?
I forgot to warn you...
there's this one bitch that lives right nearby, and that would be me.
look, I understand.
an ex-stripper moving next door will freak some people out.
no. Seriously, I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
Oh, and, uh, by the way...
Oh. Yeah?
the next time you're giving it to your husband with the lights on, could you draw the drapes?
here we go.
well, I've got the, uh, Steiner bar mitzvah tomorrow.
do you need me to run any errands for you before I go?
no, I should be good.
Joyce will be here at 3: 00 for my rehab, and Roy offered to take me to the park.
Oh. Well, isn't that lovely?
do you wanna watch a movie? - Well, I guess I'll read...
I guess we could watch a movie.
no. No, no. If you want to read, go ahead.
well...
good night.
if you need anything, just ring the bell. I'm...
right upstairs.
I... I'm sure I'll be fine.
knock, knock.
Robin. Come on in.
can I ask you a favor? - Sure.
Susan and Mike have been so good to me.
I wanna do something nice for them, and I thought, hey, maybe I should bake them a cake.
Oh, that's very thoughtful.
well, feel free to use whatever you need.
thank you.
so what do I need?
Robin, what exactly do you know about cakes?
well, I know that if you're gonna hide them one for more than an hour,
the air holes have got to be pretty big.
all right, then.
it looks like I will be teaching you how to make a cake.
Oh, yay! You rock, Bree!
I rock.
now the key to success is following the recipe exactly.
the secret to baking is precision.
got it. You're my hero.
what are you doing? - Making you my screensaver.
Oh, that's sweet.
you're replacing my cat. He's eating noodles.
let's just do this.
okay.
go get yourself an apron.
that is, like, the coolest cake I've ever seen.
raspberry mocha.
Orson's favorite.
I talked to him at the party. He's nice.
it must be tough having him in a wheelchair.
it's been challenging.
well, they say you can get through anything if you have a solid marriage.
Yes, well...
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
it's fine.
let's just say before his accident there were issues, and now we're trying to put the pieces back together.
well, that's good for you.
so what's the piece you can't find?
Ah! Now you are prying.
what?
we did make a cake together.
look, my grandmother always said that if you wanna save your marriage, there's only one room to do it in.
the bedroom.
Yeah, I got that.
it's not about sex.
it's about... closeness.
we've lost our intimacy.
Oh. Honey.
sex is how men get intimate.
well, I'm not even sure he's capable.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
his brain still works.
and he can see you. He can feel you touch him.
he can hear what you say to him.
you know, I had this regular customer...
92 years old, in a wheelchair.
I used to have to push the oxygen tank out of the way to give him a lap dance.
I don't know if he's even interested.
well, here's the thing.
neither of us knows for sure, but only one of us can find out.
Hello, dear.
how was the bar mitzvah? - A boy became a man, and a rabbi blessed my cream puffs.
same old, same old. How was your day?
Oh, I've been passing the time reading.
well, I suppose I should get out of these cloth.
Oh! Peter Tchaikovsky. God bless you.
Yes. I never tire of this piece.
it's extraordinary... so moving, so...
sensual.
don't you wanna do that upstairs?
you know, near the hamper.
actually, I'd rather do it...
right...
here.
why are you walking like that?
why do you think?
I'm not sure.
you're trying to make me feel better about being paralyzed?
guess again, big boy.
well, if you're having a stroke, we're gonna make quite the team.
Oh!
I do believe it's getting...
hot in here.
are you all right?
Yeah. Just a second. My earring's caught.
enjoy the music.
Oh, let me help.
no, no, no. I'm good. - Stay there. I'm coming over.
no, Orson, I've got it.
Ow!
Ow!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I told you I didn't need any help!
well, in my defense, that wasn't entirely clear.
forget it. This was stupid.
what was that?
what do you think?! It was a lap dance!
that was a lap dance?
I was trying to arouse you.
you are aware I'm in wheelchair? - Well, I thought you still might be interested in that sort of thing. - I am!
well, you certainly don't act like it.
after the accident,
I just never thought you would ever consider...
Oh, Orson.
things will be awkward at first, but we can work on it.
you're my husband.
I wanna be close to you.
I wanna share your bed again, even if it means just holding your hand before you fall asleep.
come here.
is this all right?
let's see...
I've got Tchaikovsky on the stereo, my wife in my arms.
Yes, this is all right.
she and Danny spent the whole day together.
what's left to say?
this is out of control. Let's forbid Ana to talk to him.
Yeah, forbid two teenagers... That always works.
besides, what would we say...
we overheard his parents talking and we think they're evil?
what do you think the Bolens did? - I don't know,
but you don't go on the run for not paying your cable bill.
they've been cagey ever since they moved in.
and Nick doesn't work. How do they have money?
maybe they're drug dealers or gun runners.
whatever they are, I don't want Ana anywhere near that family.
she won't break up with him. - She will if we make her.
I told you that won't work.
we need to come up with a carrot, not a stick.
ana.
privacy, please.
I've got big news. - For me or for you?
you! - Oh.
I just got a call from my good friend Luke Rayfield.
I was a struggling model in New York when he was a struggling photographer. - Mm-hmm.
well, mostly I was his beard for all his family functions.
there was this one time... - Is the part about me coming up?
Oh, yeah.
anyway, Luke now has his own modeling agency,
and he's always looking for new talent,
so I sent him your picture.
wait for it! Wait for it.
he wants to represent you.
you may now begin screaming.
Aah!
Oh, I have to call Danny!
Oh, well, you know what? Danny can wait.
we need to go buy you some new luggage.
they want you in New York immediately.
now? But, uh, don't I have to finish high school?
world War II... Germany lost. Korean War... Korea lost.
vietnam War... we lost. Happy graduation.
what's wrong?
I... I don't think I can go just yet.
why not?
Danny and I have a plan.
we're going to New York together when I graduate.
after everything I've done for her...
Danny and I are moving to New York after I graduate. We're in love!
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!" Ugh!
pour me some more wine before I throw up. - What's wrong?
Oh, Gaby got her niece a foot in the door for a modeling career, - and she's turning it down. - Ooh, bad call.
I used to take ballet, and I was pretty good at it, too.
and one time, this instructor from a big ballet company saw me perform, and... oh, long story short,
two days later they offered me a job.
what happened?
Bobby Butterfield happened.
a boy. - Not just a boy.
the boy.
Oh, I was crazy about him,
thought it was gonna last forever.
so I passed on the job.
and two months later, he dumped me for Louise Mcmullen.
and then a month after that, I got into a car accident,
messed up my knee,
and then it was good-bye, tutu. Hello ta-tas.
Oh.
that is fantastic!
did we just hear the same story?
you have got to tell that story to Ana.
putting off your dreams
and then having your life spiral down the crapper?
it couldn't be more perfect.
well, I... I guess I could talk to Ana, if you think it would help her.
great. And don't be afraid to turn on the waterworks.
nothin' sells pathetic stripper tears.
maybe it would help if I started taping you
so you could hear what it is you say.
don't be discouraged if Luke starts you off with catalogue work.
just try to get your face in the shot.
a little tough to do with a lawn mower, but I did it. - Hey. Ana. Where you been?
I was texting you. - Oh, I was just coming over.
Ooh. Taking a trip?
I'm... sure you two have a lot to talk about.
so I'll just take these inside for you.
Bye, Danny.
what do you need luggage for?
I was just about to come over and tell you right now.
when did this happen? - I just found out, okay?
ana, I thought we were supposed to go together.
why can't you wait? - This is a huge opportunity.
you should be saying, "Great, Ana. Go for it."
if you can't support me,
then maybe we shouldn't even be together.
Hey! Hey, Robin!
Oh, hi. What's up?
I've been meaning to thank you.
you little speech to Ana worked like a charm.
I just took her to the airport. - Great.
Mm... hmm. So, uh, why was she fighting with Danny Bolen yesterday?
they were breaking up.
they were dating?
Yeah. That's the whole reason I wanted you to talk to her, to convince her she was screwing up her life,
so I could ship her off to New York - And get her away from Danny. - You didn't tell me that.
okay. So?
so I don't like being used. - Oh, don't get upset. You did good.
ana's gone. Danny's out of the picture.
I owe ya big time.
Danny.
Hey, I think we need to talk.
sorry. It's really not a good time.
actually, this is exactly the time.
I just talked to Luke.
ana has settled into her dorm,
she's got all her classes lined up, and he's taking her new head shots tomorrow.
and the best part is,
she is miles away from the nearest Bolen.
Oh, perfect timing.
something smells good.
thank you.
just putting on the finishing touches before we eat.
bon appetite.
Oh, you spoil me. - Mm.
Mm! - What's wrong? Is it your back again?
Yeah. I spent all day working in a crawl space.
Aw. I'll call the chiropractor first thing in the morning.
no need for that. I can fix it.
come here. - Ow!
Oh, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! What are you doin'? - At Double D's, the girls were constantly throwing their backs out from sliding down that pole. They all came to see me.
now just relax, and one, two, three.
there. How do you feel?
Oh, my god. It's gone.
the pain's gone.
Wow! Uh, thank you, Robin.
I... I was just gonna give him a Scotch
and make him sleep the guest room.
seriously, you really fixed me up.
Thanks. - Oh, please.
after all you guys have done for me, it's the least I can do.
I'm home!
in here!
no fast food tonight!
fire up the...
microwave.
Hey. - My back went out again.
Robin tried cracking it, but it just didn't go deep enough.
this is the way the Buddhist monks do it.
it's the only way to get through all that muscle.
is there a problem, babe?
no. No problem.
Mm!
it looks like you're in good hands.
or... Feet.
so I'll just, uh, go make dinner.
happy trails!
how does that feel?
Oh! Yeah, yeah, do that! Do that!
can you handle a little more? - Oh! Give me all you got.
so I, uh, ran into Janice White today.
says her husband is sick.
Oh, wow, you're really stiff.
okay, let me try something else.
Oh, you're the boss.
apparently, it's bacterial, and he's, uh, bloating like a pig.
I'm gonna grab it and pull.
go for it!
and there's a lot of diarrhea!
Oh, yes! Ohh! Yes!
Ohh, yes!
this is incredible.
those monks really know what they're doing.
Oh, yeah.
when do they find time to pray?
Hey! I'm on my way to school.
the faculty volunteered to make sandwiches for the homeless.
okay, well, I'll, uh, see you later.
what's the matter?
I, uh, re... piped an entire house. Even my hair hurts.
Aw, you poor thing. You want the heating pad? - No. No, I'll be okay.
well, I won't be gone long. Feel better.
I'll just have Robin crack my back when she gets home.
or I could stay here and do it.
what about the homeless?
please. They've gone this long without food.
what's another ten minutes?
Susan, do you have a problem with Robin working on me?
of course not.
but she's not here, and you're in pain.
so why don't you let me take a shot at it?
a shot at it? We're talking about my spine.
Mike, Robin didn't exactly go to medical school between lap dances.
I saw what she did. I can do the same thing.
okay. - Here we go.
Ow! - Ow? No "ow." that's exactly what Robin did.
no, she didn't yank it.
it's my arm, not an emergency brake.
Shh. Just take a deep breath.
the key is relaxation. Okay.
one...
two...
you know, if you hadn't moved when I said "three..."
just go.
Oh, my god, Susan. Is Mike gonna be all right?
can I see him? - Sure, sweetie.
just don't climb on the bed.
look, why didn't you wait for me?
I would've taken care of Mike's back, no problem.
well, I wanted to do it myself.
Oh. Okay. Hmm.
I'm lying. I didn't wanna do it.
I just really wanted you not to do it.
I don't understand.
God, I've been trying really hard to be cool about all this.
but when I walked in and I saw you all over Mike...
when... when I was cracking his back?
I was just trying to help.
while you wearing next to nothing and straddling my husband.
how was I supposed to react? You used to be a stripper.
Oh, don't cry. Why are you crying?
strippers are supposed to be tough.
stop calling me that.
Yes, I was a stripper.
but you know what?
you were the only person who never treated me like one, - until now. - Oh.
and I'm really sorry if I crossed the line with Mike.
you know, I guess after working nine years in the club,
I just don't know where the line is anymore.
uh, it's...
I... I overreacted.
maybe I should move out.
no. Robin, you don't have to do that.
I want us to be friends for a very long time.
so, yes, I do.
Ohh!
daddy needs help making the bed go back down.
hello.
Hi. Susan asked me to bring you some of your mail.
Oh, thank you.
I'm Robin. We met at your party.
Yeah, I remember.
how's it going?
Oh! I take it you heard about my little vacation at fairview behavioral.
Yes. I heard.
well, to be honest, it's been hard, especially coming back to this big, empty house.
not to mention the subtle glances I get from people judging me.
but you know what I say? To hell with them.
thank you.
I'll see you.
Oh, hey, and if this house gets too lonely,
I'm looking for a room to rent.
I mean, Mike and Susan are great, but it's gettin' a little crowded over there.
okay, I'll keep it in mind.
mm, for what it's worth, it might take the heat off of you.
no one judges the woman from the Looney Bin when there's a stripper next door.
this is great.
I haven't had a female roommate since after college.
let's hear it for girl power!
you know, we should go out and have a drink celebrate.
Oh, I don't know.
my therapist says I should get out more, but...
either being or at Gaby's house the other day, it's...
it's just hard.
Yeah, I get that.
so what was it like being in a mental hospital?
you know...
as much fun as one would expect.
I only ask 'cause of my mom.
she used to use me as a punching bag, and I always dreamed about having her committed.
I'm sorry.
Oh. No, it was only when she was drunk.
it was her way of coping with my dad cheating on her all the time.
I remember wishing that he was ugly so other women wouldn't want him.
but he looked like Clint Eastwood.
anyway, mom had to take out her anger somewhere, and I was an easier target than a 6'4" trucker.
actually...
it was pretty bad at the hospital.
people always say it's the screaming that gets to you.
but at least screaming means you're alive, you know?
what I couldn't take were the people with the blank stares.
there was this one woman who sat frozen in the garden all day, whispering the words to "old Macdonald had a farm"
over and over and over.
the doctors ever take offense when she got to "here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack"?
you know what?
if there were ever two people who deserved a night out drinking...
it's us.
okay... - Mm-hmm?
quid pro quo. - Mm?
I told you what it was like to go to bed in restraints, so I think it's only fair that you tell me what it was like being a stripper.
Ooh. It was brutal.
if I had a dollar for every guy that slapped me on my butt just 'cause he felt like it...
come to think of it, I do.
excuse me. Uh, my friend and I were wondering if you'd like to join us at our table.
no, thank you. It's girls night out.
two beautiful women in a bar. Can't blame a guy for asking.
Mm.
uh, we're over there if you decide to go coed.
is it bad that I wanna go sit with them?
you do? - Yeah!
it's been a while since a guy had a cutest flirting with me.
you know what? Let's do it.
Really?
Yes. You look way too hot to waste it on just me.
shall we? - Mm!
come on. You've gotta have a secret.
Nope. It's shampoo and conditioner. - Well, it looks amazing.
you should be on the cover of hair magazines.
what is it you said you do? - I didn't, but my friend Katherine is starting her own catering company. - Oh, well, thinking about it.
cooking's a passion of mine.
but a lot has to happen before I start my own business.
Oh.
I know. You're a model.
no.
Oh. Uh... dental hygienist?
no.
Oh, I know. You're a flight attendant. - Mnh-mnh.
you may as well tell me, - or I'm just gonna keep guessing all night. - She's a stripper, okay?
ex-stripper. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, why are you apologizing? We love strippers.
Yeah. They're like angels of mercy...
that show their boobs.
we should probably get going.
W... what are you talking about? We haven't even danced yet.
Oh, I don't really feel like dancing, although I can't speak for Katherine here.
well, it's just, I wanna dance with you.
you're not attracted to someone who's classy, witty, not to mention breathtakingly beautiful?
no offense to your friend, but you're more my type.
Oh. Well, in that case,
I guess I'll just keep her all to myself.
night, guys.
God...
the look on their faces... - Oh, I know.
it was the perfect combo of "I am so turned on"
and "I am so going home alone."
you should remember that the next time you want to get out of a bad date.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
those two pigs confirmed what I've been thinking for a while now...
I think it's time for me to give up on men.
Mm. Amen, sister.
it's official. My dating days are over.
I mean, you don't have to take it that far.
you could always just do what I did
and explore other options.
what do you mean?
cast a wider net?
expand the pool?
date chicks?
Oh.
so you're...
Yep.
Card-carrying.
I thought that kiss felt awfully convincing.
well, I mean, I dated guys for a long time and...
I just never really felt a connection.
and then I started stripping, and I was surrounded by all these confident, sexy women, and I realized, - "Robin, sweetie, you have been barking up the wrong tree." - Hmm.
Yeah, I think I got the right tree.
just sick of barking.
well, suit yourself.
uh, you're okay with this, right?
I mean, it's not gonna affect anything with us?
I... I don't see why it would.
okay.
Hey, Robin. What are you up to?
just out for a walk. It's such a nice day.
Yeah, it is. So how do you like the neighborhood?
is everyone treatin' you okay? - I guess so.
no one's giving you any guff about about being a stripper, - Are they? - Oh, no.
I just wanna make sure, 'cause trust me, I've been there.
way back when, I was sorta in the sex trade myself.
Oh, yeah.
I used to model women's foundation garments For Sars, Roebuck.
these breasts put me through college.
they're real, by the way.
they look real.
Yeah.
anyway, I'm glad that people are treating you nice.
you know what the best part is?
they actually see me.
see you?
I spent a lot of years working in a place where people stared at me all night long.
but no one ever really... Saw me.
you know what I mean?
I do.
and when I first got here,
I thought it was gonna be the same thing. But...
I get the feeling your neighbors see past all the stuff that people usually look at.
it makes me feel really good.
I'm glad.
Robin Gallagher was right.
the people she had met on Wisteria Lane had really looked her, and they had seen her sense of morality, her loyal heart...
her surprising insight, her forgiving nature.
some people had even taken notice of her incredible beauty...
and they were surprised to discover they liked what they saw.
cover me! I'm going ahead of you.
you have no idea...
you forgot my birthday. Wow.
what your neighbors are really like...
chicken box is dangerous for adults. Go! - See ya!
until they move in...
Mm. I'm in heaven.
get close.
it should either I'm still... hot.
and uncover what's behind closed doors.
a mother protected her son.
here in America, we actually get divorced - before we get married again. - I will explain it all away.
your father told me you called off the wedding.
evil came to Wisteria Lane.
Susan, how is she? - We don't know yet. Nobody's talking to us.
it struck again...
I can't believe she's dead. - I didn't really know her, - but I guess we're sort of connected now. - You would've liked her.
and fear set in. - Whoever attacked Julie is still out there.
there is obviously a madman on the loose. - Hey!
the stage was set...
I'm a little out of your league, don't you think?
for the killer...
what are you doing?
to strike again.
there is a house in the town of Fairview.
inside this house lives a monster...
the kind who kills young women.
you may ask how such a monster came to be, and that's a very good question, indeed.
I'm out of Scotch.
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.
you got any in your room?
no. And stay out of there.
I know you've been stealing my booze.
mom, stop being so paranoid. I don't even drink.
sure you don't.
I gotta help Mrs. Scavo fix her car.
you can wait a little while, right?
his name was Eddie.
everyone thought he was harmless...
until the day his mother went into his room.
she was just looking for a bottle of Scotch...
but found the truth instead.
soon everyone in town would be asking, "how could such a monster come to be?
sadly, the answer...
would satisfy no one.
I met Eddie on a Monday.
he had just turned 4.
if you're smart, you'll take up jogging now.
don't wait till you're my age. It's too late.
I can't do anything! - At this point, I'd settle for anything.
do the dishes. Wipe down the counter. You've given up!
I'm doing the best I can. - So what's going on in there?
you know what? I don't need this crap. I am done!
baby, I said I was sorry! - It's too late, Barbara. I can't take it anymore.
but you can't just walk out. We have a kid! - No, you have a kid. I never wanted him.
I never wanted any of this! - Excuse me!
is this your child?
what's it to you? - Well, I'm sure you don't want to be talking like this in front of him.
I was just leaving.
Hank, don't do this!
don't leave me here.
I don't want to be alone.
Eddie, come here.
come here. I have to get ready for work.
Oh, it's you.
Hi.
I just wanted to check in, see how you guys are doing.
also, I... I made you a little something.
you're kidding.
well, it's nothing special, just macaroni and cheese.
come on. Let me heat this up for you.
I don't know.
and then we can talk.
and if you want to complain about your husband,
I promise, I won't defend him.
don't just stand there, then.
come on in.
he's a handsome little boy.
looks just like his father... - Mm.
which is a shame.
maybe Hank will reconsider.
no. He's serious this time.
I'm all alone with a 4-year-old to raise.
isn't there anybody who can help you?
family, your mother?
Oh, my mother.
God forbid.
what about friends?
you know, I have a great group of friends over on Wisteria Lane.
we've helped each other get through all sorts of problems.
Yeah, I've never really been the type of woman to have girlfriends.
and now I'm 35 years old with a kid.
I'm guessing I'm not really going to be having any boyfriends either.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
women in your situation find love.
you just have to look for it.
I guess. - Well, I've gotta go.
um, if you like, I can stop by next week.
uh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be fine.
uh, Eddie, say good-bye to Mary Alice.
good-bye.
you take care, Eddie.
Oh, so cute.
he's gonna be a heartbreaker one day.
just like his father.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
remember me? I... I brought you a little something.
I'm not supposed to open the door.
well, tell your mom I'm here, and she can open it.
she's not here.
Oh, well, tell your babysitter then.
y... you do have a sitter, don't you?
Eddie, where exactly is your mother?
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
look, it's my friend, Mary Alice.
well, nice to meet you, Mary.
the name's Ron. Can I buy you a drink?
Thanks, but I'm not gonna be here that long.
get up. You're leaving. - Whoa!
she can't leave yet. No, this party's just getting started.
did you say your name was Ron?
Yeah. - Shut up, Ron. I have Eddie in my car.
Eddie? Has something happened? He's not hurt, is he?
no, he's fine, no thanks to you. - Who's Eddie?
her 4-year-old child who she left at her home, unattended. - You got a kid?
you know, you might want to lead with that next time, before I spring for the screwdrivers.
Oh, baby.
don't, uh, don't you want to get my phone number?
now look at what you've done.
I am this close to calling social services.
you might wanna change your tone. Let's go.
you've got a little boy to look after.
I know I should have stayed home.
but I was already dressed when the sitter canceled, and I really just needed a couple of hours to myself.
he's 4 years old, Barbara. What if he had gotten sick?
what if he had hurt himself? - I know. I know. It was really stupid.
you've got to promise me you will never do something like this again.
never again. I swear.
it's just...
what?
I really need a man.
Oh, my heavens.
I should have been home hours ago.
don't worry about us. We are good now.
I want you to be happy, Barbara. I do.
it's just...
being a mother means always putting his needs ahead of yours.
you're right.
that's exactly what it means.
baby...
come here.
Oh, Eddie.
it's not your fault you ruined my life.
Gabrielle met Eddie on a Tuesday, the day she moved into the neighborhood.
Carlos, I'm bored.
no, I can't go get my nails done, because I'm waiting for the freaking movers!
besides, I doubt this town even has a SPA.
it does, however, have annoying people who come to your house with welcome baskets and say things like, "hot enough for you?
no, no, no, no! You are not going into another meeting!
you know, just because I moved here for your job, doesn't mean you...
Oh, yeah. Damn right we're gonna talk about this tonight, and it will be hot enough for you.
looks like it's just you and me, Chanel.
Oh! God. Who the hell are you?
Eddie. - How did you get in here?
through the window. How did you get in?
with my key. I own this place.
well, I've been playing here since the other people moved.
can I still do that?
No! Get out. Go. Go home. Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo!
did you know you're really beautiful?
okay, maybe I was a little rude earlier.
what's your story? What do you do? - I'm a kid.
Oh. Right. So why aren't you in school? - It's summer.
Oh. Right. Well, I don't really do the kid thing.
so where do you live?
a couple of streets over.
the house with the weeds.
well, that's the moving van
that has a lot of boxes I have to unpack.
you better hit the road.
or I could stay here and help you unpack.
follow me.
Mmm.
Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You missed a spot.
Oh, sorry.
don't apologize. You do good work.
maybe next time you'll be ready to do a french tip.
should I get that?
no. Shh. Keep your voice down.
it might be one of those stepford wives
with another "welcome to the neighborhood" cake.
I mean, really, does it look like I eat cake? - Some of the neighbors are nice.
that lady with the red hair makes her own Halloween candy.
you mean the one whose parents named her after cheese?
no, thank you. I like my robots a little more lifelike.
though she's not as bad
as that blonde chick who's always yelling at her kids.
there are people on fire who are not as loud as she is.
and then I thought, maybe for a second, that Susan Mayer lady and I could be friends.
and then she started talking.
okay, good. I think they're gone.
can we watch our shows now?
just as soon as you finish - unpacking those boxes in the kitchen. - I did it this morning.
Oh, my god. If you can sew, I am locking you in my basement, and you are staying here forever.
cool!
Eddie, I was kidding.
you've been coming here every day for a week.
doesn't your mother mind? - No.
are you sure? Maybe I should call her.
no. Uh, she has this new boyfriend, and they like their alone time.
Oh.
okay. Well, then why don't you stay for dinner? I'll cook.
great! - Although, you are the one who unpacked the pots and pans, so I'd hate to mess up your system.
I'll cook. I can heat up soup.
more than I can do.
okay, Yao Lin, how sick are you, really?
if you can dial a phone, you can come in and do three loads of laundry and wash some dishes.
W... Yao Lin, you know I can't understand when you speak in your native gibberish!
Hello?
Hello?
surprise, babe.
honey! What are you doing home?
well, I was at work and I started thinking about my lonely...
beautiful wife.
Aw!
and that big beautiful bathtub upstairs - we haven't christened yet. - You pig.
so you're saying you don't want to take a bath with me?
well, I guess the pans can wait until Yao Lin recovers from her double pneumonia.
all right.
we've done the tub.
maybe we should christen the guest room next.
mm, that sounds great, but I need to get going. - Wait a minute.
you're going back to work? This is a nooner?
I can't take the whole day off.
I already canceled two meetings and a lunch for this. - So how long do we have?
five more minutes.
well, don't just sit there. Fondle something.
what the hell? Who are you? - Aah!
Eddie!
you know this kid?
he lives in the neighborhood.
I knocked. No one answered. So I came through the window.
we're naked. Get out!
she told me I could come over. Who's this guy?
he's my husband, Eddie! Get out!
this is how you've been spending your days?
he's lonely. I'm lonely.
there are plenty of women on this street - that you can be friends with. - Well, they're all so weird.
Gaby, your best friend is a 9-year-old boy. That's weird.
he has no one in his life. His mother totally ignores him.
I'm thinking of going over there and saying something.
no. Stay out of it. This is where we live now, and I don't want us to be known as the nosy neighbors.
but he's so sad. - I don't care.
stop using him as your excuse.
cut him loose and get out there and start making a life for yourself.
buddy?
look, Eddie, I'm sorry Carlos yelled at you.
it's just... we were cleaning the tub.
I know what sex is. I'm not stupid.
no, you're not, which is why you should know you can't just break into people's houses.
it was okay when I was unpacking your boxes.
look, Eddie, I really like you.
but the thing is, we can't hang out so much anymore.
I need to make friends my age,
and you need to make friends your age.
you know what? You're not so pretty.
Eddie!
Bree hired Eddie to help out on a Wednesday, and she helped him in return.
it's looking wonderful, Eddie.
same time tomorrow?
sure, Mrs. Hodge.
um...
I think you gave me too much.
call it a bonus for a job well done.
you don't need to do this. - Well, I'm sure you could use a little extra cash.
do you have a girlfriend?
maybe you could, uh, buy her something nice.
uh, I don't have a girlfriend.
Oh.
well...
you're still young.
well, it wouldn't matter how old I am.
girls never notice me.
well, did it ever occur to you that they might be waiting for you to notice them?
um... No.
are there any girls that you like?
there is this one girl at school.
do you ever talk to her?
see? She has probably noticed you lots of times and wonders why you don't walk up to introduce yourself.
I wouldn't even know what to say.
does she have nice eyes?
she has nice everything.
well, you can start by mentioning her eyes.
trust me. You can never go wrong with a genuine compliment.
this is good stuff. Mm-hmm.
anything else?
well, once you have her attention, you've gotta woo her.
woo?
Yes. Give her a little gift
so she knows that you're thinking about her.
flowers are nice.
roses are even better.
and then eventually, you can work your way up to jewelry.
I can't afford all that.
now you can.
excuse me.
um, are you Eddie Orlofsky's mother?
who's asking? - Bree Hodge.
your son has been doing some painting for me over on Wisteria Lane.
you're not the woman who has sex with her gardeners, are you?
Oh, good heavens, no. That's...
somebody else.
um, may I please speak to Eddie?
uh, he's not here.
Oh. Uh, well, then, um,
maybe you can help me.
a few weeks ago,
I gave Eddie some advice on how to talk to girls.
Oh, I'm glad someone did. The kid is a lummox.
uh, yes. Uh, well...
what I didn't realize is that the object of his affection is my daughter Danielle.
he gave her roses and then more roses, and then I found this in my mailbox.
Oh, big spender.
just like his dad.
it was a lovely gesture.
sadly, Danielle doesn't return his feelings.
she spends most of her time with the other cheerleaders...
say no more. She's out of his league.
no. That's not what I mean.
so what, you want me to talk to him?
uh, yes.
uh, if you could just say something to let him down easy.
you got it.
what's going on?
this lady says you've been stalking her daughter.
I didn't say that. - You just said he is harassing some girl he has no chance with.
what the hell else do you call that?
I was trying to woo her.
woo her?
Oh, my god. That's hysterical.
there's no need to mock him.
Oh, who is mocking? I am thrilled.
I always figured the only girl he'd end up with would be blind, deaf or inflatable.
but now that I know how good he is at wooing...
please don't laugh at me.
I'll do what I want, Romeo.
and don't worry.
I'll make sure he stops hassling your daughter.
I'm sorry.
Hello, Eddie.
it's been a few days.
I wasn't, uh, sure if I'd be seeing you again.
I didn't wanna come back, but I needed the money.
no, I don't blame you for being angry.
I don't want to talk about this.
Oh, Eddie, I wish you had told me that Danielle was the girl you were interested in.
Oh, yeah, right. Then... then you could have told me that she was out of my league and saved my mom the trouble.
I wouldn't have said that,
and I definitely wouldn't have laughed at you.
why not? It's... it's pretty funny.
nerdy freak wants to date popular cheerleader?
the only thing I see when I look at you is a nice young man who isn't treated as well as he should be.
Yeah, well, tell Danielle she can relax.
I, uh, I won't be talking to her anymore. I've been forbidden.
Oh, Eddie, Danielle would be happy to talk to you, as a friend.
I don't want a friend. I want someone to love me.
well, of course you do.
I think I, uh,
I wanna work now.
Eddie, there is someone out there for you.
you just have to be patient.
for how long?
I feel like I'm waiting for someone who's never gonna show up.
there are girls out there who will say "yes" to you.
you just have to find them.
Yes. It's half up front and half after.
so where do we go?
down there.
don't worry, cutie.
no one's gonna see us.
you can do whatever you want.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot something.
I got you these.
Wow. I just...
please don't laugh at me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
let's just go.
Susan first noticed Eddie as the boy who sold her coffee.
then one Thursday, she noticed something more.
Wow. That's amazing.
Oh, hey. I didn't know you were an artist.
Oh, I was just... I'm fooling around.
uh, what can I get you?
no, let me see it.
Wow. Look at the shadowing and the blending.
it's... It's really good.
my mom thinks I'm wasting my time.
she says there's lots of people way better than me.
well, you tell your mom that I have an expensive, worthless art degree that says I know what I'm taking about.
and you have huge potential.
you think? - Yeah. You just need to work on your technique.
I could help if you want.
Seriously?
that'd be great. Thanks.
okay, whatever you want... on the house.
Oh, uh... I'll have a large, triple-shot latte.
that's funny. Your husband was in here earlier,
and that's exactly what he ordered.
actually, he's...
now my ex-husband.
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
no, no. It's fine. We've all moved on.
Mike's dating the woman that lives across the street now, and I'm, uh...
adding a double chocolate brownie to my order.
we're all very happy.
well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm sure a lot of people would like to date you.
you have huge potential, too.
brownie.
right.
Eddie, the detail is amazing.
your use of perspective...
I can't believe you've come so far in just a few weeks.
well...
I had a really good teacher.
that's sweet.
but actually, I think that you've outgrown me, which is why I have a surprise for you.
what?
I signed you up for a 2-week seminar at the art institute.
and before you say you can't afford it,
I already wrote the check.
this is, like, the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me.
but I can't go.
why not?
my mom would never let me.
I mean, she... she... she thinks this whole art thing is stupid.
Eddie, you can't let her do this to you.
you have such a gift.
listen to me.
when you love something that much,
you can't just let it go.
that kind of love is the one thing that keeps us going, whether it makes sense to anyone else or not.
wow
this is just about the only thing that makes me happy.
then to hell with the rest of the world.
Mrs. Mayer?
are you there? It's me, Eddie.
Oh, come on in! I'll be right down.
Hey, those art classes were amazing!
the first three days, they had us do nothing but portraits from memory.
and then they, uh, they brought us down to the beach to do seascapes.
I've got so much to tell you!
Yeah. Me, too.
why are you wearing that?
I'm getting married.
to who?
Mike.
uh, but he divorced you.
he made you so unhappy.
he did.
uh, but then this mad man kidnapped M.J. and so I went after him, and then Mike came after us, and he saved us both.
so we fell back in love.
this doesn't make any sense.
it's so quick.
I know.
Oh, my god. Are those eclairs?
Yeah.
Oh, they look messy. Get them away.
so, yeah, it is quick.
I can't believe in two hours,
I'm gonna be marrying Mike.
and promising him I'll be with him forever...
for the second time.
Oh, I have zero credibility.
Oh, look at me.
I don't know if I'm gonna make it down the aisle.
are they chocolate? No, I don't wanna know.
don't do it.
they just smell so good. - No, I mean the wedding.
if you're not sure, don't marry Mike.
Oh, no, Eddie, I've... I booked the church,
I bought the dress. I have to marry somebody.
you could marry me.
I have some money saved up.
okay, you almost got me.
you are so sweet.
you saw that I was freaking out, and you knew that I needed a good laugh.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hey, I have to finish getting ready.
come to the church if you want.
Oh. What the hell?
I can always use my bouquet to cover the stain.
by the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss your bride.
Julie!
Eddie.
I was just getting some coffee. How sweet of you to visit.
well, it's the first day that they allowed non-family members.
I still can't believe it happened.
I keep asking myself, how can there be this kind of evil in the world?
what kind of monster would do this to her?
it wasn't a monster.
no, monsters are big and strong.
this was done by some weak, insignificant piece of garbage that doesn't even deserve to be on this earth.
anyone who could do this to someone as sweet as Julie and you...
he should just do everyone a favor and just...
kill himself.
anyone that could do this...
is too cowardly for that.
you're right.
it was during a Friday night game of charades that Lynette was clued into the truth of Eddie's life.
th... three words.
third word. Third word.
you. You. Oh, uh, pregnant.
bloated. Swollen. Huge.
lady, Tom. I'm a lady.
no talking. - Better than hitting.
du Barry Was A Lady.
three Times A Lady.
uh, "Tramp And The Lady"? - No. No, "My Fair Lady"!
Yes. Yes!
tramp And The Lady." really?
coming!
it's not easy when you're swollen, bloated and huge.
Where's my kid?
Hey, Barbara. He's in here with us. You want to come in?
no.
Eddie.
get out here.
mom, what are you doing here? - Why didn't you answer your phone?
well, that was probably our fault.
um, we were playing charades, and you know how loud that can get.
Yeah, I guess my invitation got lost in the mail.
you gotta come home. - It's not even 8: 00, mom.
I don't care. - Mom, I'm having fun.
well, you should have thought about that - before you hid my stuff. - I didn't hide it.
everything okay? - Yes, it's nothing.
Yeah, he hides my booze and then acts all ashamed when I call him on it.
I know you hid it, you little bastard. - Hey.
no, Mrs. Scavo, it's okay. It's okay.
mom, come on. I'll walk you home.
I... I don't think you should talk to your son that way.
why do you care?
huh? What is he, your pet project?
you feed him a little dinner, Lynette, and then you let him play your stupid games so you can feel good about yourself?
Yeah.
I've got your number.
I'm out of Scotch.
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.
got any in your room?
no. And stay out of there.
Hi, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here to fix your car.
you are so sweet to remember this. Thank you.
so...
how are things at home?
are the tools in the garage? I should probably get started.
Yeah.
okay.
Hey. We got any cake left?
I'm not sure.
you okay?
I don't know. I keep thinking about last night.
Mm. Yeah, me, too.
and I'm just so...
livid.
Yeah. That Barbara is an infuriating woman.
no. Tom, no. I am livid at us...
the way she talked to Eddie, and we did nothing.
I know. But we can't force her to be nice to her own kid.
that's what everybody always says.
but we all know the woman is a drunken nightmare.
we complain about her, we gossip about her, and then we watch her walk into that house, where we know something bad is happening.
but we do nothing.
well...
and I am tired of being one of the people who does nothing.
well, Eddie is an adult now.
and he can leave whenever he wants.
he's probably so damaged, he doesn't know how to leave.
where are you going with this?
ma, I'm back from the store.
ma?
what is that?
your scrapbook.
I don't understand, Eddie.
there are all these newspaper articles in here about girls in Fairview who have been...
strangled or murdered.
why would you collect this stuff?
don't just look down at your feet.
you gotta tell me the truth, okay?
did you have anything to do with...
hurting those girls?
Oh, my god.
how could you do something like this? Oh, god.
I didn't raise you to... to be like this.
didn't you?
what is that supposed to mean? This is my fault?
look... You're upset.
why don't you sit back down and have something to drink?
you're gonna try to blame this on me.
no way.
screw you.
what are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing, you moron?
I'm calling the police!
don't do that. P... put that down.
I always said the worst mistake I ever made in my life was having you.
Hey, Eddie. Perfect timing. - Mrs. Scavo, what are you doing here?
are you okay?
Oh, my gosh, you're trembling and...
Oh, yeah, I'm just... I'm... I was on my way out.
then I'll make this quick.
Tom and I have been talking, and...
we would like it if you would move in with us.
I know it's a big change, but you've gotta get out of here, Eddie.
this isn't a healthy situation.
Yeah.
I guess it could be better.
Oh, my god.
is she passed out?
Yeah.
this is what I'm talking about.
this is why you need to get out of here.
I mean, look at her...
dead drunk.
okay.
I'll come live with you.
great. So just pack your bags and come on over.
I hope you like meat loaf.
you want me to come in and help you, or do you want me to come back later to talk to her?
believe me, Mrs. Scavo, she wouldn't hear a word.
okay.
there is a house in the town of Fairview.
inside this house lives a monster...
the kind who kills women.
you may wonder how a monster like that came to be.
the answer is simple...
monsters are created...
by other monsters.
this thief was trying To steal your truck!
you're the guy who's four months Behind on his payments?
Yeah.
Mike reluctantly borrowed money From Carlo
tell me how much you need.
andrew did his homework.
I made a few calls.
turns out the golden child Never got his degree.
I left school When the doctor told me My mother was terminal.
I can save you a phone call And bring in Her death certificate.
that's okay.
the worst mistake I ever made In my life was having you!
a killer...
got an invitation.
we would like it If you would move in with us. - Okay.
and Angie revealed her past.
I got involved With a really bad guy-- Danny's father many years ago, A terrorist fell in love With a woman.
this woman believed In the terrorist And his cause...
until an undercover agent Showed up, Determined to stop them.
the terrorist wanted to attack Those he felt were hurting The planet,
so he got the woman To help him build a bomb.
but somethinnt wrong, And someone Was unexpectedly killed.
the terrorist didn't care.
he said it was unavoidable.
the woman wanted To turn herself in, But she was pregnant.
so the agent convinced her To run away with him,
and he'd raise the child As his own.
so they escaped From the terrorist,
hoping and praying He would never find them.
unfortunately...
he did.
Hey.
if it isn't Double cccino, extra hot.
you know me so well.

interested?
Ah, what the hell?

we've had our issues.
but my dad's sacrificed a lot For me.
I figure this is How I pay him back.
you're right.
payback's really important.

how long are you gonna be? - Just long enough to get A little sweaty.
you be careful. - Yeah.
it took the terrorist 20 years To find the people Who had betrayed him.
what the...
and his plan for revenge...Was just getting started.
our mothers tell us To beware of mysterious men.
don't talk to them in the park.
don't take their candy.

Mike, that was okay When she was alive.

Yeah, um, but as far As Gaby's concerned, It cost 30 grand.

well, I love Gaby, But for years,
she has been flaunting how much They spend on her house And her car and her jewelry.
and this is My turn to flaunt, And I can't flaunt With a free piano.
don't stoop to her level.
you're better than that.
no, I'm really not.
Susan, I'm not kidding. You're not telling Gaby We paid for this piano.
Oh, mike, please. This is my chance.

and sometimes my family Can be unappreciative.
but what happened today Can never happen again.
I know.
listen, I grew up With an alcoholic mother.
I know what it feels like To be angry all the time.
but when I was your age, I had to find a way...
to control myself.
how did you do that?
a lot of help.
one thing--I had A great counselor at school,
and she taught me That whenever I s About to lose it, That i should do this...
that really works?
it really does.
it gives you a chance To step back, Feel like you're in control.
you should try it next time. You'll see.

Carlos gave $50, 000 To one of your neighbors.

Oh, my god.
Mike's wife is One of my closest friends, And she never said a word.

I should get going.

hello.
hello.
um, I saw you the other day, Talking to my friend Sam.
Oh, I'm--I'm Bree, By the way.
I know who you are.
well, this is None of my business,
but I noced that there was Some tension between you two.
you could say that.
well, I hope everything is okay.
what is it you want?
well, I don't know. There was just something so odd About that...
encounter.
I don't understand why he would Talk to a friend like that.
maybe that's because I'm not his friend.
I'm his mother.
my manager said I could Take a break early.
you've got five minutes.
are you aware That Sam goes around Telling people that you're-- Dead.
Yes, I heard.
why would he do that?
he's a complicated boy.
did Sam tell you Who his father was?
he told me about your Relationship with my...husband, If that's What you're referring to.
did he also mention the letter That Rex sent to me?
what letter?
it was After you were married.
Rex had just started His practice, And apparently, The money was pouring in.
Rex wrote And told me he could give Sam A better life.
he then asked For full-Time custody.
I'm guessing He never told you that.
must have slipped his mind.
I politely declined His offer.
and did Sam...Know about this?
not until a few months ago, When he found the letter.
and when he realized that he Could have lived all those years With his dad In a fancy house...
he... was beyond livid.
even so, how could he go around pretending that you're dead?
like I said...He's a complicated boy.
Gaby, hi.
Hi, Susan.
I just got back From the supermarket And realized I bought Way too much.
I'm afraid Some of it's gonna go bad, And so I thought, Who could I give this to?
and I randomly thought of you.
you're afraid That canned peaches And condensed milk Are going to go bad?
well, it's just, My cupboards are cluttered, And you'd be Doing me a huge favor.
okay.
Thanks.
Hey.
as long as you're here, I want to show you Something.
we just got it.
M. J.Is gonna take lessons.
you sure you don't want To start him off With, say, a used upright?
no way.
me wan-Ny, me like-Y, Me get-Ty.
may I ask how much this cost-Y?
well, Mike doesn't like Me throwing around numbers,
but let's just say Your jaw would drop...30, 000 times.
what - That's one.
this is none of my business,
but is this Really the best time To buy something This expensive?
I mean, didn't mike just have His truck repossessed?
things finally Turned around.
he got a big cash infusion.
you don't say.
anyway, I know you guys Don't have a piano,
so if you ever want the girls To take lessons...
well, thank you.
I gotta go. Enjoy your peaches.
you owe me $50, 000.
what?
for yonformation, Mike's "big cash infusion" Cost me my ski house.
what are you talking about?
Oh, don't play dumb.
Carlos loaned Mike the 50 grand, And you know it!
why are you looking Like you don't know it?
he told me.Business picked up.
well, he lied, Just like Carlos lied to me About where our money went,
which you went And spent on a piano.
Oh, no--No, I didn't.
uh...I inherited it.
I was trying To make you jealous.
Oh, honey, Given different circumstances, That so would have worked.
this is unbelievable.
I have the money From the strip club Sitting in the bank,
and Mike would rather Borrow it from you guys?
I'm about to screech At my husband.
you might want to stand back.
no, no, no, no, no.
I have a better idea.
there you are.
Hey.
Hey, mr. Scavo.
how was the flight? - Horrible.
it was delayed, There was turbulence, They ran out of food,
and I'm not seeing a plate Covered with tinfoil here.
there was one, but one of our 50 Children must have inhaled it.
damn it!
okay, calm down. - Lynette, no. I'm hungry.
you know, when you were working, I always had food waiting For you.
Oh, that's right. You were very considerate In your eighth month.
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting, You're the only person Who's ever been pregnant before.
relax. Relax We'll just order a pizza.
and wait an hour? Forget it. I'll fend for myself.
Hey, it's okay.
I'm fine. - There's nothing in here.
come on. Lynette, - you didn't go To the store today? - 16...17...
tie, you might want To take it down a notch.
I have been in three cities In two days.
you'd think you'd find the time To go to the market.
what the hell is he doing?
Eddie, it's okay.
23, 24, 25... - Tell him To stick a sock in it.
26, 27... - Okay, you need to kiss me. Here.
okay, there. We're good. We're good. He loves me. He loves me.
we'll talk about it later.
so Eddie attacked our son?
okay, I'd use "attack," But with a small a.
okay, that's it. I want him out, And that's with a big o.
look, Eddie is not some Exchange student from France.
he comes From an abusive home.
we have to accept He has some...baggage.
so I have to wonder If he's gonna punch me Any time I raise my voice To you?
I am not sending him back To live with that woman, Tom.
how about therapy?
that might help. - Now we're gonna pay For his therapy?
okay, here's a thought. How About we all stop yelling at me? What a concept Be nice to Lynette.
fine.
we'll try the therapy.
all these weeks, Sam has been going on About how his mother was dead,
and the whole time, She has been at Howe's market, In a smock, stacking cans.
I s my instincts about Sam Were right, wouldn't you say?
what did I say About gloating?
something. I wasn't listening.
I was thinking About how right I was.
okay, I'll stop. I know you're upset.
you have no idea.
when Sam first showed up, I felt like I got A little piece of Rex back.
it was wonderful.
but this has forced me To rember That Rex was a liar, too.
sorry. Am interrupting something?
Orson, Would you please excuse us?
of course.
everything all right?
actually, Sam - Wait, wait. Still here.
I went back To the supermarket today.
I take it you met my mother.
why did you say She was dead?
she is dead...to me.
so you admit that you lied?
did she tell you i found A letter my father wrote,
begging her to let me Come live with him?
that's hardly an excuse.
I wa 4.
he said he could give me All the advantages she couldn't,
but she wouldn't let him.
she loved you.
she wanted you by her side - She should have wanted more For me!
andrew got bicycles For christmas And tvs for his birthday.
I had to sit in a trailer and do My homework with mittens on
because my couldn't afford To pay the heating bill.
if she had loved me, She would have let me Live the life That I was entitled to!
I'm...Gog to...Talk to the...Schwartzmans About their bar mitzvah.
if you want to go over The menu later, let me know.
how'd it go?
kind of weird, But it was okay. - Yeah?
I think you did Very good work today, Eddie.
now the restroom is Down the hall, Second door on the right.
I'll be here.
so you said "good work." Does that mean it went well?
that means Eddie's got some issues,
and it's going to take time To work through them.
okay...
how much more time At $130 an hour?
well, It would go a lot faster If we could get his mother In here,
but he seems to think there's Ay she'd agree to that.
Really?
if you think it'll help, I can get her in here.
that would be great.
okay, and then...
and then everything Will be okay, right?
let's just get the mother In here.
it's Lynette Scavo.
barbara, We need to talk about Eddie.
are you looking For Barbara Orlofsky? - Yeah - Do you know where she is? - No. Nobody's seen her for days,
and her car's still there.
it's weird.
there's this crazy rumor Going around That you've got something For me.
Justn apology.
well, as long as it comes With one of your muffins, - I may just accept it. - Oh, andrew.
Orson told me about Sam.
you were right from the start.
I never should have trusted him.
I-I don't even need The muffin now.
now that that's settled, What are we gonna do about Sam?
that's easy. We get rid of him.
I don't think It's gonna be that simple.
why not?
I saw a side to him last night That i've never seen before,
and to be perfectly honest...I'm afraid of him.
Hi, susan! Thanks for having us Over for dinner.
Oh, well, actually, Dinner was just an excuse.
I wanted to show you Something.
Oh, my god! You bought a piano? - Yes!
and I wantedyou To be the first to see it.
that looks...pricey.
$30, 000, Plus delivery and tax And a biannual tuning fee.
but Mike's on his way down.
do me a favor. Don't let on That you know how much it cost.
why not?
he thinks it's ostentatious, And he's a little embarrassed.
in fact, He keeps telling everyone That inherited it from My aunt, so just go with it.
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
that's okay, honey. I'm gonna check on dinner. - We're gonna check on dinner.
dude, we need to talk.
a piano?
Oh, god, don't worry about it. We didn't buy it.
Susan inherited it From her dead aunt.
without even blinking.
uh, would anyone mind Helping me set the table?
Oh, Carlos will do it. - Oh, great.
and, Mike, maybe you And Gaby can get the wine.
so you and Carlos have Any big plans for the summer?
you taking any trips?
Oh, I'm sorr I'm sorry.
look, if, um, You need to talk...
Susan's in the other room.
I think Carlos is Having an affair.
what?
why would you think that?
because he's been acting Really secretive lately.
and I went to talk To our business manager,
and I discovered $50, 000 was Missing from our account.
well, I'm sure There's a good explanation.
Yeah, there is.
it's called fancy dresses And hotel rooms for some bimbo.
no, no, no. I am sure that You've got that all wrong.
wait a minute. Are you covering for him?
no. I...
because I stole his cell phone To see who he was tag to,
and he called your house, Like, a hundred times.
well, He hasn't been talking tome. - Really?
well, the next time He's not talking to you,
you might want to give him The name of your divorce lawyer.
I'm so glad you guys Were free tonight.
we've been wanting to do this For such a long Oh, my god!
what's wrong? - My earring. It's missing.
damn it!
I just got them today.
Oh, I'm sure it's somewhere.
Oh! Here it is.
that would have been 3 grand out the window.
you bought $3, 000 earrings?
Oh, of course not.
Mike did.
he's so generous, Especially now That we're loaded again.
you know, Carlos, I never noticed before You have A really veiny forehead.
Hey, buddy, We got a bit of a problem.
no kidding.
wait, you know?
did Gaby say something? - No.
I heard it all from Susan.
well, It's not surprising, The way those two talk, But luckily, it's not true.
come on, Mike. Let's stop the lies. It is true, And we both know it.
it is?
don't act surprised.
God, This whole thing was a mistake. I never sh have Written that check.
you paid for it?
Oh, man.
wh - dinner is ready.
Susan, Everything smells so good.
Thanks.
you want some meatballs, Carlos?
I've got two nice, big ones For you right here.
Nope. I'm fine.
I saw that.

you leering At susan's breasts.
I was looking At the pasta. Susan's breasts just happened To be hovering nearby.
Gaby, leave Carlos alone.
Oh, my god. It's you.
excuse me? - You're the one Carlos is Having an affair with.
what? - What?
makes perfect sense.
that's why There were all those phone calls To this house From his cell phone.
you looked at my cell phone?
Yes, and thank god I did.
whore!
shamelessly shoving your Meatballs in my husband's face.
there was no shoving. Sometimes They spontaneously heave.
have you lost your mind?
I am Not having an affair with Susan.
Mike, you believe me, right?
yeah...
I guess. It's just...why areyou Calling over here all the time?
I'm not! I always call your cell!
Susan, say something.
forget it, Carlos. We might as well confess.
confess what?!
you wouldn't take my money When you were in trouble,
and, well, I've always known That Carlos had a thing for me,
so I told him That I would sleep with him If he would loan you money.
you son of a bitch!
I didn't touch her.
all I did was help a friend Who screwed me over Buying diamond earrings And grand pianos.
I told you, the piano was A gift from susan's aunt!
you bought diamond earrings?
Oh, yeah, with the $50, 000 That you borrowed from Carlos.
you know?
Yeah!
so you two were just. - Screwing with you, yes.
so tell me, Mike, Do you feel betrayed, Humiliated?
good. Because I only did this To show you what it feels like When the person that is Supposed to love you the most Lies to you.
well, I just did it 'Cause I want a ski chalet.
I just keep trying to find To think what I can say So you'll know How sorry I am.

what I am looking for is Your word That you will never freeze me Out like this again.
I swear.

Yep.

no. I...Just want to get a sense Of where we stand.

Eddie added his mother to his list of victims.
how'd it go?
well, it would go a lot faster if we could get his mother in here.
nobody's seen her for days.
Bree saw a disturbing side of Sam.
I'm afraid of him.
Susan attacked Mike's financial problems.
so is this everything? - Yep.
Gaby got the truth.
I got involved with a bad guy.
you're not talking about nick, are you?
no, Danny's father-- a really bad guy.

not without you.
I'll send Danny.
and Angie faced her worst fear.

and if you decide to run away, say good-bye to Nick,
because he won't be around much longer after you've gone.
Angie Bolen was having trouble sleeping.
she kept dreaming about her life and the choices she had made.
after all, it was her decision to drop out of college.
it was her idea to join a group of eco-terrorists.
she let herself fall in love...
with their charismatic leader.
and she agreed to build him a bomb.
Angie knew her choices had been bad ones.
how else could she have ended up here...
with a man she despised?
good mornin'.
how long you been sittin' there?
for a while.
I've been admiring your scar.
it is so beautiful.
what are you doing?
you should be proud.
it's a symbol of what we accomplished.
we killed a guy. I'm not so proud.
what's one life compared to the planet?
what we did was noble.
tell that to his wife.
when did you stop loving me?
was it while we were still together, or was it after Nick took you from me?
my wrist hurts. Uncuff me.
answer the question.
I never loved you.
that's a lie.
in fact, I'm thinkin' there's a good chance that you still do.
don't touch me.
maybe if we made love, you'd reme.
we could, but you might not like it when I vomit into your mouth.
you do realize I could kill you.
but you won't,'cause you need me for somethin'.
that's true.
well...
don't just keep me in suspense.
tell me.
you're gonna make me another bomb.
you can never make me do that.
Yes, Angie Bolen had made a lot of bad choices in her life.
you're gonna be surprised by what I can make you do.
and she now had no choices left.
detective John Booth was not happy.
you see, someone had been killing women in the town of fairview, and he hadn't a clue as to who it was.
for months, he had pored over autopsy photos...
read psychological profiles...
and interviewed witnesses...
but detective Booth was still no closer to finding the killer.
until one day...
booth speaking.
Really?
Yeah. Okay. We'll be right there.
what's up?
some kids came across a woman's body buried in the woods.
strangled?
we'll find out.
forensics is over there right now digging her up.
we need to talk.
did I do something wrong?
no.
I went to your house to see your mom.
you did?
Why?
I wanted to ask her to come to therapy with you.
Dr. Mccarthy thought it might be helpful.
what did she say?
actually, she wasn't there.
I don't want to worry you, but her neighbor said no one has seen her for days.
look...
I'm sure that must sound like a big deal to you, but this has been going on my whole life.
she's off on another bender, and in a week or two, she'll come back, like nothing ever happened.
so we don't need to call anyone?
you think she's okay?
Yeah.
it's only a matter of time before she turns up.
okay, my plane's in an hour.
I wish you weren't gonna be gone for your birthday.
the girls are gonna be so disappointed.
the commission on this deal is worth 40 grand.
I will dry their tears with dollar bills.
bon voyage.
and don't worr I'll have your favorite dinner waiting.
that's okay, babe.
we can just go out to dinner and celebrate.
but I make you lasagna every year.
I know. I just don't want you to have to go through all the trouble.
that's all.
I gotta go. - Hold it!
you do like my lasagna, don't you?
sure, I do.
liar!
excuse me?
you were doing that thing you do when you lie.
what thing?
Oh, like I'm gonna tell you.
I don't believe this. You've been eating my lasagna for 11 years.
actually, the ficus in the ding room has been eating it.
what?
but on the bright side, it's thriving.
so you're saying I make great mulch?
look, I just never wanted to hurt your feelings.
until today.
Well,I've gotten older.
my stomach's gotten weaker.
look, I'm sorry, baby. You just don't make it the way mam? Used to.
that's because your backstabbing mother didn't have the decency to give me the recipe before she died.
she was run over by a car!
well, isn't that convenient?
look, lasagna's a tough dish.
but I love your guacamole.
I buy that at the store.
like only you can.
So...Figure out my financial mess yet?
I've been going over these invoices for three days, and I'm confused.
the payments don't cover half of what you've billed.
well, that's 'cause not everybody's paid.
why not?
they don't have the money.
times are tough.
a lot of my customers are struggling just to make ends meet.
wish I kw what that was like.
Oh, wait. I do.
they'll pay when they can.
honey, I love that I married a guy who wants to unclog the world's toilets for free.
but now it's time the people pay the piper for the pipes.
it's not that easy.
I've known these people for years.
I can't just go shake 'em down.
you're right.
I'll do it.
you?
Hey...How are you gonna do it?
look at me.
big brown eyes, quivering lips.
once I tell them how our life is falling apart, trust me, they'll pay.
no, Susan, this will never work.
fine.
but Ii don't know what we're gonna do.
uh, we barely have enough money to pay our bills this month.
the insurance is due.
and god forbid M. J.Get in an accident.
Susan, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
still don't think it'll work?
Wow. You're scary.
can I go get our money?
be my guest.
Hey, hey!
last year, when I wanted to go fishing, but you wanted to go skiing and you started crying I think it's best we don't discuss that until we're out of this financial cris.
I'm not scared of Sam.
if you're afraid to fire him, I'll do it.
No! I don't want to provoke him.
the man is clearly troubled.
and there's no telling how violent he could get.
well, we're not intimidated.
are we, Orson?
just how violent are we talking?
Hey, we'll do whatever it takes to protect mom.
okay.
but I am in a chair.
I don't know how good I'd be in a fight.
this thing tips over in a stiff wind.
don't worry, orson. We'll think of something else.
what are you doing?
did that hurt? - No.
well, that's all I got.
you don't need to fight, Orson.
you're more of a strategist.
O-okay, fine. We don't want to fight.
why don't we hire someone to rough him up?
I know a couple ex-marines.
how do you know any - don't ask.
Hey, what about money? - What about it?
well, if we can't fire sam or scare him away, maybe he'll respond to cash.
Yes, he's always talking about how he never had anything growing up.
I think, one little severance package, and we could be rid of this problem.
Oh, brilliant idea, Orson.
you call writing a check "brilliant"?
anything?
sorry.
Mrs. Scavo? - Yeah?
I'm Detective Booth. This is detective Furst.
can we come in? - Sure.
what's this about?
do you know an Irina Kosokov?
Oh, unfortunately, yeah.
and whatever you think she did, she did.
I'm sorry?
she's a conniving, manipulative little grifter who put my son through hell.
she's dead.
what?
are you serious?
we found her body earlier today.
she was murdered.
what's going on?
these are policemen. It's about Irina.
Oh, boy. That didn't take long. - Tom...
that little bitch couldn't even get out of the country before she...
she's dead.
was taken from us too soon.
is your son Preston home?
no, he's camping with his brother.
but thank you so much for coming by.
he's gonna be devastated.
actually, we're gonna need to talk to him.
wait. You don't think he had anything to do with this?
we found a letter that ms. Kosokov had written to him.
sounds like things ended pretty badly between them.
well, yeah, he broke off the engagement.
but he wouldn't do that and then kill her. It's an extra step.
wouldn't you just skip the breakup and get right to the killing?
why won't you stop talking? - I want to, believe me.
just get him in as soon as you can.
sure. I'll call him right now.
thank you.
I'm telling you, there's no way Preston could have hurt that girl.
you guys should concentrate on finding the real killer.
Oh, don't worry. We'll find him.
brings back memories, huh?
I'm not doing this.
I don't expect you to start today.
I'm still waiting on one more piece.
it's not gonna happen.
Angie, there's this development in Oregon.
they're planning to clear-cut 4, 000 acres of old growth.
we gotta stop them.
and who cares if we kill a few loggers in the process, right?
saving the world's messy.
you used to be able to see that.
you know what I see now?
a fake.
what? - You're a phony.
the only cause you ever believed in is you.
I'm trying to save the planet!
Oh, god. You still have that ego.
I was trying to save you, too!
Oh, well, thanks for caring, but Nick saved me, and he showed me what a coward you really are.
do you really wanna start talking about Nick right now, huh?!
God, how does it feel, knowing you'll never be half the man he is?
Angie, open up. It's Gaby.
she won't go.
I'm not going. I see your car.
you've got one minute to get rid of her, or there's gonna be one less neighbor at the block party.
come on in.
Hey. I need a lasagna recipe for Carlos.
Hi. - Hi. I'm Anthony, Angie's brother.
Oh, you never told me you had a brother.
I'm sure she hasn't told you lots of things.
uh, what kind of lasagna does carlos like? Meat? Vegetarian?
have you seen Carlos?
what's all this?
somebody kill a toaster?
Angie's fixing my remote control, giving it a little extra power.
you know how to do that? - Sure.
she was an engineering major in college.
well, you know, I have an appliance at home that could use some extra power.
and once I get to know you better, I'll tell you which one.
got that recipe yet?
here you go. - Oh, thanks.
what does this s?
ten fresh tomatoes.
can't I just use sauce from a jar?
no, you can't just use sauce from a jar!
you're right.
no one will ever know the difference. See you later.
nice meetiou.
Oh, and a little word of advice
never compare your wife to your dead mother if you wanna get laid on your birthday.
you know how to make a bomb and you haven't used one on her yet?
I admire your restraint.
you wanted to see me, Bree?
I did.
please, have a seat.
did you know that Rex set up a trust fund for Andrew and Danielle?
no, I didn't.
well, he wanted to be sure they had a nest egg to draw from in case something happened to him, which it did.
why are you telling me all this?
well, Rex set up two trust funds.
he seems to have forgotten he had three children, and that's not right.
that's a lot of money.
well, it's my way of apologizing for my husband's poor memory.
I never expected anything like this. Thank you.
you're very welcome.
and I hope you know how much i have appreciated the time you spent with us and the work you did.
truly, I wish you the very best.
that sounds like a good-bye.
well, now that you have all this money, you don't need to work here.
a young man with your skills should feel free to go out into the world and make his mark.
but I like it here.
well, unfortunately, I no longer need you.
you see, Andrew and i have made up, and I'm giving him your job.
what?
don't be angry.
this is, after all, a family business.
but I'm part of the family.
Not...Really.
what are you doing?
you can't buy me off.
I belong here.
I'm a van de kamp.
and if you ever insult me again...
you're gonna wish you hadn't.
excuse me.
are you Jake Walker?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Susan Delfino, your plumber's wife.
Oh, hey.
Yeah, Mike's, uh, done us a few solids over here.
he's a good man.
Yes, and a proud man, which is why he hasn't told you that his business is really hurting.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
so we're gonna need you to pay your bill, uh, for the work he completed...
four months ago.
yeah...I wish I could, but, uh, it's a bad time.
you okay?
Oh, I'm sorry.
it's just, we're having a bad time, too.
we can't cover our bills, and the health insurance is due.
and god forbid Our son get in an accident.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry.
kids bounce back.
kids bounce back?
that's your response?
look, my wife lost her job.
my truck needs a new transmission.
well, maybe we could set up a payment - my daughter needs braces.
even if it's just small - nifit...
Nifit? Th-that's not an excuse.
that's just a sound.
look, lady, I don't know how to tell you.
I don't have the money, okay?
so just leave me alone.
no, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
you owe me money, and I'm not gonna rest until I get it.
I am gonna make sure everyone in your life knows what a deadbeat you are.
when you go to work tomorrow, I'll be there.
when you go bowling with your buddies, I'll be there.
and when you go to your video store to get your porn, I'll okay, okay.
I'll write you a check.
thank you.
so with the price of college tuition being what it is, and my mother had that gallbladder operation, well, we're just a little tapped out at the moment.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
but mike did repipe your entire second floor, didn't he?
Yes. And I want to pay, but we just don't have the money.
Oh, that's too bad.
these are awfully cute.
Yes.
my husband gives me one every year on our anniversary.
they're my babies.
Aw, that's so sweet.
please be careful.
I don't like it when people touch them.
Oh, well, you know what I don't like?
I don't like when people take advantage of my husband.
it makes me feel all...
clumsy.
I guess I could maybe pay you half.
okay, the whole thing. The whole thing.
let me get my wallet.
we'll be waiting!
I know I'm late in paying for the water heater, but I'm on a fixed income.
there just isn't any money left at the end of the month.
I mean, for me to even pay for my medicines I've had to cut down to two meals a day.
s-so even though I'd like to help, I can't.
I've got nothing.
you got a nice watch.
Wow.
damn right,"wow"!
no cereal for dinner tonight, baby!
Jim peterson--paid!
and the ones that couldn't pay, I took it in booty.
a clock?
earrings.
a menorah?
sterling Silver.
Hey, mrs. Gottleib has a toilet that flushes, doesn't she?
what happened to batting your eyes and shedding a few tears?
playing the victim gome nowhere.
everybody had an excuse, and I bought it.
and then, all of a sudden, I snapped.
rage just started pouring out of me.
it was like my inner bully had been released.
and one by one, I brought the deadbeats to their knees!
for the first time in my life, I have gotten a taste of power.
and you know what?
I like it.
you do know that's not a twist-off?
Yes! Ow! That hurts.
I can't tell you what a rush it is to have this adrenaline pouring through me.
Hey, I have an idea.
let's go upstairs right now and have bully sex.
Susan - I said now!
we can't.
why not?
I want to celebrate.
I brought home all this money today.
we're getting closer and closer to the finish line.
Yeah.
well...
the i. R.S. Just moved the finish line.
Oh, my god.
I know. We're screwed.
you know what?
old victim Susan might have agreed with you, but...
new bully Susan is not gonna take this lying down.
the way I see it, the i. R.S. Is a government agency, and the government only exists because of the taxes that we pay.
so that makes me your boss.
and as your boss, I am telling you that we need an extension.
do I make myself clear?
I am a terrible bully.
Yes. Yes, you are.
he didn't have to tack on all those extra penalties.
did you know they could do that? - Yeah.
see, I didn't, or I never would have...
Yeah, I figured.
so what do you think we should do?
I don't know.
between the taxes and the rest of the bills, we're still screwed.
we got nothing to fl back on.
we've got the house.
Sam. Good. You're here.
come on in.
I thought you wanted to go over the quarterly inventory.
Yes, but then some old friends dropped by.
Sam allen, I would like you to meet detective Turner and sergeant Clemente.
So...You're policemen.
used to be.
Bree catered our retirement parties.
and did an amazing job.
boy, do we owe her big.
Sam, have a seat. Have some tea.
no, thanks. I'm not really a big tea guy.
Oh, come on. Take a load off.
we got, uh, we got room here on the couch.
so...
the officers were just sharing some stories from their days on the force.
tell him the one you just told me.
about the guy who was hassling the nice lady?
Yes. Sam, listen to this.
this guy was so crafty, knew just what to say to scare the lady without technically breaking the law.
Yeah, our hands were tied.
nothing we could do.
that must have been so frustrating.
scone?
Thanks.
Oh, it was very frustrating.
of course, if we encountered the same situation today, we'd handle it very differently.
how?
well, we'd sit him down for a nice chat.
and, uh, if he wouldn't listen to reason, then there are...
measures we could take.
sounds like a Mickey Spillane novel.
what kind of measures?
well...
you mind?
you pick up a phone bo, aim for the adam's apple...
boom!
let your fingers do the walking.
Or--or--or here.
help me out here.
you, uh, dislocate those two fingers and smack him on the hand.
pop 'em back in.
and there's no evidence.
goodness. It's hard to believe you'd actually do such a thing.
well, if I had to.
I mean, if the situation came up, I would hope that the...
threat would be enough.
Absolutely.
Sam, you're looking a little pale.
would you like some more tea or perhaps a macaroon?
no. I...Think...
I...
should be going.
Hey, do you want us to give you a ride?
I mean, we go right past 474 ash street.
I'm good.
I don't know why tea parties have fallen out of fashion.
they're so much fun.
okay, Porter. Do what you can to keep your brother's spirits up.
drive safely.
I--yeah, I'll see you soon.
Hey, uh, mrs. Scav what's with the backpack?
Yeah, I've been thinking that it might be good if I move back home for a little while.
Why?
Irina's dead. Your family needs time to deal with that.
you don't need me hanging around, getting in the way.
to be honest, I already think of you as family.
c-come on. I've only been here a couple of weeks.
your first morning here, you asked if you could take out the trash.
believe me, you were in my will by 3: 00 that afternoon.
seriously, I think you should stay.
I want to, but...
my mom's gonna be back from her bender any day now, and I should be there.
Oh. That's so sweet of you.
your mom's lucky to have a son like you.
you know...
once you make sure she's okay, you can always come back.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
is something wrong?
d-did you not like it here?
no. No, it was fantastic.
I should just go. That's all.
okay.
well, can I give you a hug good-bye?
I can't help thinking, I would've turned out so different if you were my mom.
what do you mean you're moving off the lane?
you can't sell your house.
we're not selling. We're renting.
I don't care.
either way, you're not gonna be living here.
Lynette, say something.
you're very persuasive.
I...I don't understand why you have to do this.
well, we dug ourselves in pretty deep financially.
we'll be fine. It's just gonna be for a while.
checkbooks.
no, no.
I love you for that, but no.
we got ourselves into this. We can get ourselves out.
where will you go?
we found an apartment near the school.
and there's a park around the corner.
and it's close by, so we'll still be able to see each other.
I hope so.
cause people always say that and then...
well, imean it.
so do we.
ma?
what are you doing here?
what are you talking about? You texted me.
you told me to hurry home.
Oh, god, that wasn't me.
Danny, get out of the house now.
what's going on?
just go, Danny. Go.
what's the rush?
remember that piece I said w missing?
it just arrived.
so i've been thinking...
what are you doing here?
you know, about what your cop friends said about how effective threats can be.
I think they're right.
get out.
I will, but not before we do a little business.
what kind of business?
I want you to sign over your company to me.
what?
I'm talking about your catering clients, your cookbooks, the frozen food line-- all of it.
are you insane?
why would I do that?
remember the dinner you threw to welcome me to the family?
well, Danielle h a little too much to drink.
I hear that's genetic.
Anyw, she got pretty chatty.
kept asking me why I wanted to join a family with so many secrets.
uh, what did she tell you?
the same thing i'm gonna tell some of my cop friends.
Oh, and while I'm at it, I should probably tell Carlos Solis, too.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about Andrew, your son, getting into a car and running down Carlos' mother.
so should we draw up theapers now or wait till morning?
it's a lot to take in, I know.
I don't believe you.
look, I'm just trying to let you know that when you're ready, I want us to have a traditional father-son relationship.
are you serious?
I know.
that sounded ridiculous.
and I'm sorry I had to tie you up.
believe me, this is not how I wanted this to happen.
but I have something important to do.
once I'm done, I'll untie you, and we'll have time to get to know each other.
if you ever untie me, I'll kill you!
you're mad.
I get it.
but eventually, you realize who you're mad at.
it's not the guy who spent 20 years looking for you.
it's the people who spent 20 years lying to you.
did you say to Danny?
just a father/son chat.
I swear, if you ever hurt him...
God, everybody makes me sound like such a villain.
so...
how's my bomb coming?
it would go a lot faster if could use two hands.
well, we are on a deadline.
Hello?
not her again.
I come bearing gifts.
Hello?
you've got 20 seconds to get her the hell outta here.
Hey.
sorry to barge in, but I did a test run, and I really need your opinion.
now? - Yeah.
this has to be the best lasagna in the world, so when I shove it down Carlos' throat, he'll know I care.
she'll try it later.
thanks for stopping by.
Oh, I'm not going.
she won't go.
let me just cut a piece.
two seconds.
cause don't forget, Danny's waiting for you.
be right back, Gaby.
well, I can tell you this much, it smells great.
Oh, come on.
this is my first magazine cover.
Ooh. And this is me when I did "vogue."
Oh, that's my daughter Juanita.
I don't know how that got in there.
Oh! And now the runway years.
you're keeping your friend waiting.
be right there.
Oh, jeez. You scared the crap outta me.
I'm about to kill your neighbor.
you might want to get her outta here.
Gaby, I gotta hand it to you. You did a great job.
Really? You're not just saying that?
Oh, fantastic.
but would you mind taking the rest back?
I'm just trying to watch my weight.
I get it.
you're trying to cut out all the crappy food.
did mrs. Bolen like the lasagna?
well, she said she did, and then she pretended she was on a diet.
well, I guess I can take a hint.
honey, do you really think this is the time to be cleaning out your purse?
our son is being interrogated for murder.
I have a lot of rage in me.
would you rath I channel it into this or you?
I'd put the emergency tampon in the zipper pouch.
thank you.
pres, how'd it go?
they just wanted to confir the timeline I was in Europe this past year.
that's it?
I guess they think the guy who killed all those girls while I was gone is the same one who strangled Irina.
Oh, thank god. So you're free and clear?
you okay?
I just keep thinking, Irina would still be alive if I hadn't brought her here.
I'll meet you at the car.
sweetie, when - mom, let him go.
this whole thing has really hit him hard.
how about Porter and I take him out, shoot a few games of pool, see if he wants to talk?
okay. I'll see you back at home.
did you hear they found a second body in the woods?
they think it's some local woman-- Barbara Orlofsky.
isn't that that woman we throw in the drunk tank about once a month?
that's her.
Oh, my god! What are you doing?
we were hungry.
so you picked it out of the trash?
you're worse than raccoons.
sorry.
well, since you had some, what'd you think?
Oh, yeah? Well, the french toast you made me for mother's day wasn't so hot either.
what the heck is that?
Susan showed a certain flair for her new job.
there you go.
you know, you're getting good at this.
Renee rented a house.
wow, that is so...
wonderful? - Close.
there's something I have to tell you.
Gaby learned the truth about her daughter being switched at birth.
paul Young continued to surprise everyone.
well, I see you've all met my wife.
and Tom came home with a mysterious affliction.
I'm not feeling well. - Again?
I'm just gonna lie on the couch and watch some TV.
Tom Scavo was depressed, and his wife had done everything she could to cheer him up.
she had made his favorite meals.
she had told her funniest jokes.
she'd even worn her sexiest lingerie.
but nothing worked.
finally, Lynette insisted her husband go to the doctor.
unfortunately, what he came home with was a prescription... for trouble.
antianxiety medication?
this is what he gave you?
Dr. Weiler says it will help.
he spent 20 minutes with you. - Lynette...
and let me guess. Did he write this with a pen that has the drug company's name on it?
I need this medicine.
then take it, but I gotta tell you, those drugs scare the crap out of me.
I gotta do something. I am so tired of feeling this way.
but you've gone through rough patches before.
you could come out of it.
so wait around to get better? That's your answer?
you don't know what it's like inside my head!
okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
remember when Susan kept having all those headaches?
who was that guy that she went to? Doctor... Dr. Ross.
how is he gonna be any different?
he's holistic. He tries to stay away from heavy meds.
Susan loved him.
and if he says I should be on this?
then you have a second opinion.
whatever he says, I'll go with it.
well...
I saw Dr. Ross.
Oh! I'm so glad.
did you like him?
loved him. And you were right.
he... he doesn't believe in pharmaceuticals.
he only prescribes stuff that's totally herbal and natural.
that is fantastic. So what did he suggest?
medical marijuana.
Yes, Tom Scavo had been battling depression, but he was now facing a much bigger battle with his wife.
happiness...
it's something we all want, and so we search for it.
little girls find it in the taste of chocolate.
well-dressed men discover it at their local mall.
teenage boys experience it when talking to a pretty girl.
and then there are housewives, who simply can't be happy until they've learned everything they can about the newest neighbor on the block.
Hello!
Hi. So sorry to interrupt. This will just take a second.
we wanted to officially welcome you to the neighborhood.
this is my friend Lynette and Susan, and I was telling them about you, and we...
just had to meet you. - Immediately.
that's so sweet. Oh, you... you're my landlady, right?
Yes, but I really want you to think of me as a friend.
are those pictures hung on the wall with nails or...
um, we wanted to invite you to our weekly poker game.
shoot. I don't know how to play poker.
Oh, don't worry. We'll teach you.
does that ficus tree have a saucer underneath?
because those are hardwood floors.
and while you're learning all about Texas Hold'em, we'll learn all about you.
Aw! That sounds fun.
okay, well, uh, we should be going. We'll see you later.
okay. Bye. - Bye.
what did those women want?
they invited me to play cards with them.
but they were just being friendly.
on this street, never confuse being nosy with being friendly.
they were digging for dirt.
so... Do you not want me to go?
no, no. You will go.
give them all sorts of meaningless information.
and hopefully, they'll start to think of you as a friend.
but... if you don't like them, why do you want me to be friends with them?
in time, it will be useful.
Where's the pen?
don't you wanna read it first?
Why? Did a nurse get drunk and swap it with a different document?
by signing this, Mr. Solis, you are agreeing not to bring any legal action against this hospital. Do you understand?
and in return, you'll stop searching for the other family.
do you understand?
done. Gaby.
baby, we talked about this.
we don't know how this other family will react, and we need to protect Juanita.
I am sorry, Gabrielle.
I can only imagine how you must feel.
you can't begin to imagine how I feel.
the only person who could is the woman who has my daughter.
if signing can spare her this pain... Then I will do it.
I love it!
somehow I get the feeling you don't love it.
okay, I don't love it. It's just so... Yellow.
trust me. This will be great.
besides, when you're in the room, nobody's looking at the walls anyway.
well, you certainly know how to sell yellow.
excuse me.
I hear you're gettin' divorced.
and good morning to you.
I'm getting divorced, too, so we both need guys.
I'm thinking we should hang.
uh, I don't know how much Lynette has told you about me, but I'm really not one for... hanging.
look, one woman at a bar is just sad.
but two, and it's girls' night out.
so what do you say? You up for a little stud hunting?
that's a lovely offer, but I think I'm gonna pass.
Oh, come on.
we gotta get back in the game, cut loose, let our hair down.
that hair does come down, doesn't it?
really, Renee, that is just not how I like to meet men.
well, how else you gonna meet 'em, sittin' around your house?
you'd be surprised.
you've met someone already? - Maybe.
a beautiful, classy woman who can get a man without leaving the house.
I don't see us being friends.
I don't know how everything gets so dirty in here.
is that a piece of lint?
Oh, no! It got my apron!
I'd better sign off before I'm completely naked.
see you tomorrow, boys.
I'm busy!
honey, it's Maxine!
a star is born!
did you watch?
Oh, not only did I watch, I kvelled.
Oh! I have to admit, I am sort of getting into it.
that whole thing with the vacuum just came to me well, that's how it happens with the great ones.
here's a bonus for you.
what's this for?
well, it's a little something I do for the girl who gets the most hits in a month.
you just unseated Stacy Strauss, and with the caboose on her, that's not easy.
Oh, Maxine. You're so good to me. - Oh, honey.
you know what? Mike and I are finally starting to save some money.
well, don't save it all.
buy yourself something nice. You deserve it.
Oh, by the way, have you decided what you're gonna do for tomorrow's show?
I'm gonna damp mop in bikini briefs.
Ooh! Are you trying to make me cry?
Bye, doll.
this is a great sandwich. What's in it?
Oh, it's nothing.
and of course I make my own fig mustard.
cooking is a passion of mine.
of course, it's not much fun cooking for one, so, um, if you're free this weekend...
baby, you gotta try this sandwich. It rocks.
this is my boss, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
this is Stephanie, my girlfriend.
you have a girlfriend?
of course you have a...
a girlfriend who's young and pretty.
nice to meet you.
I'm sorry, Bree. What were you about to ask me?
Oh, it's, uh, wasn't important.
you enjoy your sandwich.
inside, over there.
let the stud hunt begin.
come on. Come on. We're gonna get started.
you okay?
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Let's play cards.
when I was 8, daddy left mama, and we were pretty much alone.
most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic.
of course, there were always mama's boyfriends, but as soon as I'd learn their names, mama would kick them out, and there'd be a new toothbrush in the bathroom.
uh, let me know if I'm sharing too much.
no. Not at all.
keep pouring the chardonnay. She's cracking like an egg.
okay, quarter ante.
so, Beth, how did you and Paul meet anyway?
Oh, I don't wanna bore you.
we won't be bored. More chardonnay?
well...
I saw his picture in the paper during his trial, and there was just something about those eyes that spoke to me.
what about the headline?
arrested for murder - that didn't speak to you?
I'll admit that gave me pause.
but then we started corresponding, and I discovered what a wonderful man Paul really is.
Bree, let's forget about hittin' the clubs tomorrow night.
clearly, all the best guys are on death row.
but, hey, you can't help who you fall in love with, right?
and Paul's a real lady-killer.
we... we always fogged up the plexiglas with that one.
well, it's good that you can laugh about it.
the thing is, in my heart, I always knew he was innocent, and I was right.
well, he is.
Yeah, so let's play cards.
what are you doing?
preparing to take my medicine.
I've heard that an increase in appetite's a possible side effect, so I'm taking the necessary precautions.
necessary precautions being your own weight in cheese doodles?
I never smoked pot before, so I wanna be prepared.
headphones? - Pink Floyd.
apparently, it complements the medicinal properties of, uh...Blueberry bliss.
listen to you. You are loving this.
Tom the college rd gets to finally smoke pot and be cool.
Hey, I was plenty cool in college.
the only reason I didn't smoke back then was because I signed the abstinence pledge with my dungeons & dragons club.
so... what do you say?
care to join me out back behind the garage for a little doobage?
"Doobage"?
that's what you're calling your medicine now?
come on. You need to take this seriously.
I am.
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I've never asked you to join me behind the garage to split a midol.
Lynette, you said you would go with this.
I know, but how is it gonna look to the kids?
I don't want them seeing their dad stoned.
Oh, you... you don't have to worry about them seeing me stoned.
they'll never know.
Hey, the...
okay.
so what do you wanna do Saturday night?
well, I was thinking that we could go to Chez Naomi.
isn't our price range more Chez chicken hut?
Mike, it's our anniversary.
besides, we've been working really hard. We deserve it.
okay, but bring your big purse 'cause we're taking the dinner rolls home.
so... Chez Naomi, huh?
expensive place.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.
must be nice.
um, have we met? I'm in 1b. Susan Delfino.
Oh, I know who you are.
I'm 1f.
uh, you're one of Maxine's... - Yeah.
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.
guess we... Kind of do the same thing.
Oh, sometimes we do exactly the same thing.
what does that mean?
I keep an eye on the competition. You lifted one of my moves.
no, I didn't.
you expect me to believe you just woke up one day and decided to put a feather duster in your mouth?
you do that?
it's my signature bit, and you stole it.
I swear. I...
I...I don't watch the other girls perform.
okay, so I guess it's just a coincidence.
well, here's another coincidence...
you're getting the big bonus check, and I'm not.
that's not... really what you'd call a coincidence.
that's really more - all right, college.
just keep the duster out of your mouth.
and watch your back.
everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I am wasted.
Really?
I am Lucy in the sky high.
so...
this must be pretty intense for you and don't forget.
tomorrow we have to trombone 3-d banana patch. Remember?
man, this is, uh, really strong stuff.
snow shovel.
exactly.
you know, I was just upstairs watching Paige sleep, with her little fingers and her little toes.
I must've watched her for, like, an hour.
she's just so perfect.
and I am so lucky.
I couldn't feel happier than I do right now.
I mean just so happy it's working.
Yeah.
what do you think? Does this say "happy anniversary, Mike. I'll love you forever"?
no. I think it says "credit card declined."
aren't you and Mike on a budget?
Yeah, but things are starting to turn around lately.
I've been selling a lot of my jewelry.
get out!
out there and keep selling.
Oh, hello, silk!
Oh, how I've missed your soft touch.
I'm going to the dressing room.
mm, you two have fun.
mommy?
Oh. You're not my mommy.
are you lost, sweetie? What's your name?
Kiki! You scared me! I couldn't find you.
I have a little girl, too.
sometimes they get distracted and wander off.
let's go.
wait!
how old is she? - 8.
my daughter's 8.
when's your birthday? - Uh, we've really gotta go.
uh, okay, but, uh, what hospital was she born in?
was it Fairview memorial?
standing there in the mall, it just hit me.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if every little girl I see is my daughter.
not knowing where she is, it... it's like my heart living outside of my body.
well, there's a private Detective I work with.
but Sanchez is a pretty common name.
it's not surprising the hospital couldn't find 'em.
but I know something the hospital doesn't.
when I was in labor, the other woman's mother came into my room by mistake, and we got to talking.
she lived in el Paso, and she was so excited to have her granddaughter baptized at Santa Maria's church.
that's gonna help.
so you think you can find her?
we'll do our best. Carlos is on board with this, right?
Absolutely.
okay, then give me ten porterhouse.
Hey. I just came by to pick up my envelope for the week.
okay. Inside.
and don't listen to this conversation.
it's about your Christmas gift.
I'm buying all my girls steaks. You got a preference?
whatever meat you put in my stocking will be fine.
Ooh, that sounds dirty. Use that.
I'm back. What else have you got for me?
rib eye? I like it.
is that a piece of lint?
that's my bit. Max... Max!
What?! I'm on with the meat guy.
Yeah, but Stacy Strauss is stealing my vacuum bit!
Oh, my God.
well, if she's gonna do that, at least teach her how to use the nozzle.
hey there. I'm ready to party.
are you? 'Cause you look like you're ready to tour the Reagan library.
this is a cocktail cardigan.
look closely. The buttons are shiny.
Where's your closet?
I have never seen so many sweater sets.
are you sure this is a closet and not a portal to the 1950s?
there is nothing wrong with my clothing.
Bree, you're going to a hot young club full of hot young people.
you need to dress the part.
well, I happen to find it distasteful when mutton is dressed as lamb.
look, when women go out clubbing, there's two ways they can pair up...
pretty girl/pretty girl or pretty girl/grenade.
which do you wanna be?
fine.
now we're getting somewhere.
love the plunging neckline.
that's the back.
Ugh. This place is dead.
Really? - I forgot we were in the sticks.
clearly, everyone hooked up early so they could be home in time for "nightline."
actually, tonight's "nightline" sounds very interesting.
it's about the genocide in ...
hold on. Fresh talent at the end of the bar.
Oh, that's my contractor.
well, call me a fixer-upper.
Oh, don't... don't bother.
he's, uh, got a girlfriend.
if I don't see her, she doesn't exist.
what's so funny?
my girlfriend's about to make a fool of herself.
she's hitting on that guy, and I happen to know he has a very beautiful, very young girlfriend.
you talking about Keith? - You know him?
Yeah, and Stephanie dumped him this afternoon, which is why he's here, drowning his sorrows.
Bree. Wow. I didn't recognize you.
Keith, what a lovely surprise. I didn't know you were here.
Yeah.
but I'm bagging. I gotta work tomorrow.
boss is pretty strict.
good. I mean, yes, I'm very strict.
see you in the morning.
there you go. That's how you bait the hook.
Oh, I won't need a ride. I'm going home with Keith.
Oh, I don't think so. He just left.
Oh, he's pulling the car around.
now you think I should play the "I hate going into a dark house alone" card, or the more blatant "I'm not wearing underwear"? 'Cause I'm not.
okay, before you do anything hasty, he just broke up with his girlfriend.
he's very fragile.
Oh. I'll be careful when I unwrap him.
Renee, wait. Please don't go home with Keith.
Why?
Oh, he's the one you like, isn't he?
I am... I am thinking about you.
you don't want to come off like a slut.
Aw, gee, then chip won't ask me to the prom.
Renee, wait! What about me?
Oh, it's getting late. Stay in the dim light and don't play hard to get.
Keith, hi. It's Bree.
I don't know if you're in bed yet, but I'm having a bit of an emergency.
Oh, thank you. That's lovely.
why would somebody do something like this?
far be it from me to understand the minds of hooligans.
I'm so sorry to call you over here at this hour.
Oh, it's okay. I wasn't doing anything special.
good. I would love to show my appreciation.
I was wondering if perhaps one night this week, I could make you dinner.
Oh. You mean... Like a date?
well, we don't have to put a label on it.
just two adults eating... Food together.
calling it a date is quicker.
well, I see no reason to argue.
shall we say...
8：00 P. M. on Thursday?
Mrs. McCluskey, right?
Yeah.
I was hoping I might see you at the girls' poker game.
not anymore.
you get caught with a couple of aces in your bra, and you're banned for life.
I couldn't help but notice they don't seem to like my husband very much.
do you know why that is?
Nope. Nobody tells me anything.
Mrs. McCluskey, I really need to know.
okay, fine. They think he's a murderer.
but he was exonerated. Felicia Tillman framed him.
Yeah, for that crime.
what do you mean?
before Felicia showed up around here, her sister Martha was murdered.
and, all due respect, you're shacking up with suspect number one.
does everybody think that?
Felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five, but if she's crazy, we all are.
well, that's enough dusting for today, boys.
I guess all that's left is a little vacuuming.
Ooh! Yay! Get the vacuum.
I think I got some schmutz on my apron.
Ooh, get that off.
Oh, I love this show.
Hello, boys.
for those of you who might be switching over from other channels, welcome.
I have a very dirty apartment.
open up!
uh, little busy!
I know you did it.
did what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, so you're not just a thief. You're a liar.
be careful how you talk to me, you gigantic freak.
Oh, I am about to slap that cheap blush right off your face.
is that supposed to scare me, man hands?
I'm gonna show you a whole new place to stick that feather duster.
well, I'm sure wherever it is, you copied the idea from watching me.
I need those bonus checks! - So do I!
you don't get it. I am trying to get out of this business!
Oh, and you think I wanna spend the rest of my life dusting in my underwear? !
you're off camera! Roll left.
Oh, Maxine. I'm so glad you're here.
what are you doing? - She attacked me.
that's because she broke into my apartment and...
hang on. This isn't a bit?
No! I was in the middle of doing my show, and she burst in here and started hitting me.
did you do that?
Yeah, but... - you know the rules, Strauss!
you never, ever interrupt a show!
now go to your room.
but I... - I said go.
you all right, honey?
Yeah. - All right. Good.
I-I gotta call tech support.
you girls had so many hits, it fried my router.
so...
a roving gang of hooligans destroyed your sprinklers?
shameful, isn't it? - You know what I think?
I think this is the hairwork of a lonely, desperate woman.
you left out "resourceful."
nobody steals a man out of my bed.
but you know what?
I've been looking for a new hobby, and taking you down is as good as any.
I think you'd be wise to stick to your original hobby of forgoing undergarments.
be seeing you, Bree.
looking forward to it.
Maxine says I can't go back online until I apologize to you, so...
I apologize.
and I thought your acting was bad on the web site.
fine. I am sorry, okay?
I shouldn't have stolen your bit.
what was going through your mind?
I freaked out when I didn't get that bonus check.
see, my family's in Virginia, and I'm saving up to move back home.
Yeah, well, I know what that's like.
and even with that extra money,I always feel like I'm living week to week.
Really?
cause when I broke in your apartment,I noticed that you had some awfully nice stuff.
flat screen TV, closet full of new clothes.
I know.
probably shouldn't have bought all that.
but you know how it is.
every once in a while, you want a little splurge.
Yeah, I get that.
but... definitely by the end of the year,I'm going to be outta here.
me, too.
how long have you been doing this?
um... gosh.
I guess I'm going on six years.
would you mind if we just stayed home and ordered Chinese for our anniversary?
wait. No suit? No tie?
no pretentious euro waiter listing specials that I can't understand?
dang it, Susan! Why?
seriously, why'd you change your mind? I thought you wanted a little treat.
I think we should save that money and stay focused on what we're trying to do.
and we can have a fancy dinner and celebrate when we move back home.
I had a lovely time at the poker game the other day.
Really? What's the neighborhood saying about me?
well...
for starters, a lot of people seem to think you killed...
what's her name? Martha something.
I guess Felicia Tillman spread her poison pretty wide.
I guess she did.
I'm not a murderer, you know.
I know.
but I fell in love with you before I knew that, so even if you were...
I'm always gonna be on your side.
remember that.
everything okay? You... You look a little...
it's been an intense couple weeks.
I'm sorry, buddy.
what if I told you I could ease some of that stress?
you're not gonna offer me a back rub, are you?
Nope.
a mind rub.
so you got this from a doctor?
really cool doctor.
now I gotta warn you, this stuff is chronic.
I got totally baked off of it this morning.
I did not have you pegged as a stoner.
dude...
there's a lot that you don't know about me.
Tom? - Yeah.
I hate to break this to you, but...
this isn't pot.
tell me that in five minutes when we are soaring past the rings of Saturn.
trust me, cheech. This is oregano.
no way. I bo... I bo-- I bought it at a legit dispensary.
then somebody must have switched it on you, 'cause the only thing getting baked with that herb is lasagna.
who would do that?
you! - Oh, jeez. You scared me.
I know what you did.
whatever do you mean?
Oh, yeah. That was me.
this isn't funny, Lynette!
Tom, you thought you were getting stoned on a pizza topping.
it's a little funny.
my sense of betrayal is huge at this moment.
well, why don't you snort some baking powder? You'll feel better.
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
glad you enjoy making a fool of me.
that was not my intention.
I only threw out the pot because I didn't think you needed it, and you know, I was right.
you got happy all on your own.
don't try to justify what you did by making it seem like some sort of "master plan.
it wasn't a master plan.
I lucked out because for some reason, while you were...high on oregano, you made a decision to live in the moment.
you stood over our daughter's crib and you let go of the stress and the fear, and you focused on the good in your life.
but I am sorry I tricked you.
you're evil. I should have expected it.
where are you going?
to look at our beautiful daughter.
then I gotta turn that bong I made back into a lamp.
anything?
we found them.
Oh, my God. What'd they say?
I haven't called them yet. Are you sure you still wanna do this?
what? Yes, of course.
Gaby, you need to realize, once we call these people, and they know what happened, it'll change your family forever.
call them.
Juanita, come in here.
I didn't do it.
I know. I was putting on some ketchup.
I thought you might like some.
can you put the big fake eyelashes on me?
of course, and... big rosy cheeks.
look how grown-up you are.
before you know it, you're gonna be going to college, have boyfriends, get married.
I'm not getting married.
I don't wanna leave you and daddy... ever.
do you know how much I love you?
to the moon and back.
that's right.
no matter what happens, I will always love you to the moon and back.
Hey, Carlos, I need to sit down with you and Gaby.
Why?
I just called the family. It got pretty intense.
what are you talking about?
and now in a selection from Dior's fall line, the world's newest supermodel... Juanita!
hold the world in contempt.
that's it. Now you look like a model.
Oh, hi, daddy.
Hey, Carlos. What's wrong?
I just spoke to Bob.
sweetie, why don't you go to your room? And I'll be there in a second.
how could you have done this? - Carlos...
we talked about this! We agreed.
no, you agreed.
you rushed me into signing that piece of paper without giving me a chance to think about what I was doing.
don't you understand what could happen?
she is our flesh and blood, and she's out there!
I need to know how she's doing. I need to know she's okay!
and what if they want Juanita back?!
they can take her from us. They can do that now!
they're not gonna wanna give up their own daughter.
we don't know that!
we don't know anything about them!
and you have no idea what you've started here!
mommy!
coming, sweetie!
if this ends badly, I will never forgive you.
I mean it, Gabrielle. We're done.
happiness...
it's something everyone searches for.
some are sure they'll find it once they've moved back home.
some think they'll find it by making a new friend.
some hope to find it once they've defeated the competition.
then there are those who stop searching for happiness because they look up one day to discover...
it was right there in front of them all the time.
I was thinking about this great guy from my past.
an evening of drinking led to a confession.
Tom. - Tom scavo?
love of my life.
I have to talk to you about something really important.
did anyone order a shrimp cocktail with a puny engagement ring on the side?
Keith's plan to propose was thwarted.
I really do love your son.
Yeah, I see you with someone... More your own age.
what are you doing? - Memorizing your face.
Gaby said good-bye to her biological daughter Grace.
a halfway house for convicts on our street?
I now own seven houses on wisteria lane.
and paul needed one more house...
I can offer you well above market value.
how much above market value? - We have to stick together.
to achieve his goal.
we know what they look like.
we know how they dress...
and we know how they behave.
Yes, we can all recognize the wrong kind of people.
and when we see them coming, we do what we have to to protect ourselves.
Lynette! How are you this fine day?
who are these people?
old friends. - Ex-con friends?
aren't you jumping the gun?
until the homeowners association votes, you don't have approval for your project.
these men have volunteered to get my halfway house ready.
most of them live in a dreadful facility on skid row.
I told them that if they participated in the remodel,
I could get them transferred here.
you're wasting their time, because this place is never going to open.
Oh, I think it will.
and won't it be nice for these men to live on a street where children play in their front yards and people don't lock their doors at night?
why is Paul so sure the house will open?
he doesn't have the votes.
he's got something up his sleeve. What it is I don't know.
are we positive no one's planning on selling him their home?
we can't take anyone for granted.
we need to talk to everyone on the street.
good idea. We'll shore up support.
and if we sense anyone starting to waver... - How could they?
everyone knows what's at stake here.
I pray they do. I love this neighborhood, and I don't want it to change. Let's go.
and with that, my friends went to work trying to stop Paul Young.
he knew what they were up to.
but he didn't care.
he should have.
paul had forgotten what ordinary men and women will do to protect themselves...
from the wrong kind of people.
when a cab arrived...
and a woman departed.
she left the street quietly.
but news of her disappearance would soon spread.
and the sound would be deafening.
but first...
a young man in love had plans to make some noise of his own.
Bree, I love you, and I want this to be the last morning you wake up without me next to you.
it's 6: 00! How long have you been kneeling there?
I don't know, but after you answer this question, you're gonna need to help me up.
Bree...Will you do me the honor...
may I say something first?
after that embarrassing night in the restaurant,
I really appreciate you taking another stab at this, but...
that's a long "but." I'm getting up.
hold on. I'm not saying no...
exactly. It's just so soon to be talking about marriage.
maybe I can use this as a tiny napkin ring.
wait!
I have a proposal for you.
I love you, too, Keith Watson, and I also want this to be the last morning I wake up without you next to me.
so I'm asking you, will you do me the honor of...
moving in with me?
for the third time, no.
I'm not gonna sell my house to Paul Young.
I'm sorry. I just had to make sure. The vote is today.
do you really think that I would let dangerous ex-cons move in next to my own mother?
I don't know. As a teenager, you were pretty nasty.
but you're all grown up now and so very nice.
thank you for your support.
excuse me.
Lynette scavo? - Yeah?
brent ferguson, president of the hydrangea circle homeowners association.
we've all heard about your situation. We'd love to help.
Really? - Sure.
last year we had a similar scare on our street.
some old hippie wanted to open up a drug rehab center on our block.
I remember. Didn't that old hippie get beat up by a neighbor?
he made the mistake of mouthing off to one of my neighbors who's an ex-green beret.
newspaper made it sound way worse than it was.
well, nice to meet you.
you say the word, and I will have the homeowners association of ten different streets here to back you folks up.
whoever's trying to open up this halfway house, we could really scare the hell out of 'em.
well, I appreciate your offer, but I think we'd prefer to handle our situation in a more...civilized manner.
okay. Well, you change your mind, you know where to find me.
hydrangea circle," got it.
so we're at dinner, and Renee is going on and on about this guy she once had a fling with and she still has feelings for, and she gets so drunk that she tells me it was Tom Scavo.
what am I supposed to do with that?
you look so hot right now.
Mike, focus. I know you've been in Alaska for a month.
a month, 19 days, and 7 hours.
yesterday I put boobs on a snowman.
I need to come home.
I miss you, too.
so am I making too much out of this?
I mean, it happened 20 years ago, and Tom's a good guy, right?
Yeah, he is, but...
even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right.
interesting point. Wish you hadn't made it while you were 2, 000 miles away and clearly horny.
Susan, I am in the middle of nowhere.
the only female I've seen has antlers.
so should I tell Lynette? - Well, not just yet.
maybe just keep an eye on the situation.
thanks for the advice.
just so you know, when you come home, I'm gonna make you forget all about that snowman.
her name is carol.
okay, you really need to come home.
mommy?
why are you crying?
Oh... Just...Having a sad day. You've been having a lot of sad days. Is it because Grace left? Having a sad day. You've been having a lot of sad days. Is it because Grace left?
you've been having a lot of sad days. Is it because Grace left?
that was when you started being sad-the day she went away.
no, it's just, you know...
I got really close to that whole family, and...
I knew I was gonna miss Carmen and Hector.
and Grace?
why are you wearing my necklace?
I'm playing dress-up.
not with real diamonds. Hand it over!
fine. Here.
take it. Jeesh.
and I don't want you playing in my room anymore. You understand?
I liked you better when you were crying.
Mitzi! It's lynette scavo!
if you're in there, please open up!
Hey, lee.
you wouldn't happen to know where Mitzi Kinsky is, would you?
no. Why would I?
I thought maybe you and Paul convinced her to sell her house and then stashed her away someplace for safekeeping.
Lynette, I have to say, I'm offended.
I have to say, I couldn't care less. - You know...
for the millionth time, I had no idea what he was up to!
you were his real estate agent! You didn't think it odd
him buying all these houses on one street?
he was paying me commissions. What-what am I supposed to do?
complain? - Maybe you didn't know, and if Paul is voted down at tonight's meeting, I'm sure in time people will forget you had anything to do with this
I. - But, Lee, if he finds a way to open that house,
I don't think anyone on this street will ever forgive you.
Hello?
look out your window.
Oh, it's you. I'm hanging up now.
look, I understand you're annoyed with me.
I feel awful. - Well, you should.
because of you, everyone on this street hates me now.
that's why I'm calling.
I put you in an awful position. I'd like to make it up to you.
and how are you gonna do that?
well, first, you should know that Mitzi Kinsky agreed to sell me her house yesterday.
what?
I suggested she leave the lane for a while.
the taxi picked her up this morning.
Oh, my god. So why - Why are you telling me this?
because I have a little proposition for you.
and given how the neighbors feel about you these days,
I suggest you listen.
Hey, Mitzi, it's Lynette. Um, still haven't heard from you.
I need to make sure we're all on the same page for tonight's meeting. Call me back.
I know you're probably busy. I really need to talk to somebody.
I would love to, but the meeting's tonight.
I got a bunch of phone calls to make. Can't you talk to Susan or Bree?
no. It's gotta be you. - why?
you're the only woman I know who's lost a child.
and ever since Grace left, I can't stop crying.
I break down at the mall, at the market.
I'm starting to freak myself out.
I was the same way after I lost the baby.
I finally went to a therapist.
I didn't know that.
did it help? - It did.
in fact, she had me do something you might want to try.
write Grace a letter.
a letter?
you don't send it.
you just pour out your feelings.
tell Grace how happy you are to have found her and how much you love her. Trust me.
after you've written it, you'll feel so much better.
Gaby! Where are my keys?
uh, I have them!
wait. I'll be right down!
you're moving in together?
no one's more surprised than I am.
so you did propose to her?
I tried. Bree said she's not ready for that yet.
this was the compromise.
I figure we'll do this for a while, then in a couple months we'll start talking about a wedding.
Yeah, I-I guess that could happen.
you "guess"? - It's just...
if Bree was in love with you, seems she'd want to...
lock it down. That's all.
dad, I get where she's coming from.
she just divorced a guy. - That's my point.
she's ready for some fun, not something serious.
she may be looking at you as a diversion.
no, Bree loves me. This is going somewhere.
just make sure.
if Bree's not willing to make some sort of a commitment, then maybe
dad, you're starting to piss me off.
I hope I'm wrong. I really do.
and if I am...
you let me know when to rent the tux for the wedding.
okey.
any sign of mitzi? - Oh, not yet.
God, where could she be?
if she sold her house to Paul, she better be on the run.
not that it'll do any good.
I'll still hunt her down and kill her.
Lynette? We've been here for 20 minutes.
don't you think it's time you started? - Relax, Paul.
we're not taking the vote until everyone's here.
well, while we're waiting, may I make an announcement?
I suppose.
may I have your attention, please?
I wanted you all to know that the mayor of Fairview will be here Friday to present me with an award for outstanding public service.
what? What?
Yes, it's-it's- It's sort of a big deal, and I would love it if all of my friends would attend.
if you'd invite your enemies, you'd get a bigger crowd.
Ah, I love your sense of humor, Mrs. Mccluskey.
how we'll all miss it after you're gone.
hold it. Now, what kind of public service did you do?
the halfway house, of course.
I now have all the votes I need to open it.
how do you have the votes?
someone sold you their house?
Oh, yes.
we shouldn't have sold.
we should have just gone under with the rest of the neighborhood.
which would have been very noble and very stupid.
Mitzi sold. She's not gonna be around for everybody on this street to pummel, which means they would have taken their anger out on you.
didn't have a choice.
what the hell?
Mitzi, what are you doing here?
I live here. Oh, I guess you would have noticed, if I was a hot guy with abs.
but we thought you left.
weirdest thing. Get this call?
this guy says he has a job for me in the city.
puts me up in a nice hotel, and then he never showed.
huh, and I got stuck with the minibar charges.
so, wait. You didn't sell your house to Paul Young?
what? Please.
I'm not gonna screw over my neighbors.
what the hell have you done to us?
no, I'm sorry. Lynette is not here.
she's trying to deal with this whole Paul Young mess.
Yes, I will have her get back to you.
Ok-okay.
what is happening to this neighborhood?
some van just pulled up, and these creepy characters are getting out.
that is a school bus, Renee. Those are children.
well, I don't like the way they're looking at me.
can you come over and install a dead bolt on my door?
sure. I will be right over, as soon as I find where Lynette keeps the toolbox.
great. I have to jump in the shower.
I will leave the key under the mat.
you know, I had to use that key the other night.
yeah?
Yeah. We went out, and Renee got hammered, so I had to take her in and put her to bed.
well, that was nice of you.
Yeah...And she told me this fascinating story about this guy that she had a fling with 20 years ago.
w- w-why-why-why was that fascinating?
well, apparently the one weekend they spent together made quite an impact on her.
W - did she say any... Thing...Else a-about that guy?
no, not really.
only that his name was Tom Scavo.
okay, look...
this happened before Lynette and I were married.
it meant nothing.
well, it meant something to Renee.
she's still in love with you.
she said that? - She slurred it.
look, this is not something I wanted to know, but now that I do, I am in a horrible position.
no, no, no, no, no. You can't tell Lynette!
sh-she would freak out!
I don't want to tell her, but she's my best friend, and I'm freaking out knowing that you're at Renee's fixing her dead bolt while she's in the shower.
look, this was forever ago, and I don't feel anything for her.
a beautiful woman who still wants you is living 100 yards away, and her breasts are 95 yards away.
why do you want that temptation?
Hey, I didn't ask her to move here.
Well...Maybe it's time you ask her to leave.
so the whole right side of the closet is yours, and I emptied out the top drawers of the bureau for your socks and those cute little boxer briefs you wear.
thank you.
and after we've gotten you settled,
I want us to go over and tell the girls.
they're going to die. Bree Van De Kamp living in sin.
come here.
what is it?
we love each other, right?
why don't you just go ahead and wear this?
Keith. - No, if-if-if marriage is where we're headed,
I just keep thinking, what's the harm?
because we're not there yet.
look, I'm not trying to rush you, but I need a bigger commitment than just the top couple drawers in your bureau.
we talked about this.
I'm not ready to make that kind of promise.
that's a problem.
because I don't wanna wake up one day and find out that I was just some diversion that, uh, you needed to amuse yourself while getting through your divorce.
if you really think I feel that way, then why are you even here?
I'm-I'm starting to wonder that myself.
do you think us living together is a mistake?
no. No, I think us is a mistake.
I wish we had been nicer to Paul.
I wish we had stood by him when he was on trial.
I think about what he must have gone through in prison, and I understand his rage. I do.
but I won't allow him to destroy this street.
it's not right.
don't worry. We will stop this son of a bitch.
that's a promise.
Hey. M. j.'s spending the night at a friend's house, so I don't care if this protest goes all night.
I'm here to the bitter end. How can I help?
we need more signs painted.
okay. - Hey, susan.
look on that paper. We came up with a whole list of slogans.
just so you know, we got plenty of "think about the children,
and we need a lot more "who let the cons out?
so, what exactly are we hoping to accomplish with all this?
the mayor is in a close race for re-election.
he needs every vote he can get. If we can make a big enough stink in front of the news cameras, maybe we can embarrass him into shutting that place down.
so if this protest works, and the place doesn't open, what happens to all those ex-cons?
what happens to them?
I mean, I-if they don't get to stay here, where will they go?
they'll just go back to where they came from, or some house in another neighborhood.
but what if that neighborhood doesn't want them either?
well - I mean, if they've done their time, and they need a second chance, wouldn't it be better for them to be in a nice neighborhood?
in theory, yes, but that's not the way the world works.
we have to think about our neighborhood, our children.
ourselves?
don't be cute. Some of these men may have good intentions, but some of them could still be really bad guys.
but if we don't even try to help them, are we so sure we're the good guys?
Keith told me what happened. I'm so sorry.
thank you.
so, uh, why are you here?
he also mentioned all that work that needs to be done in your backyard.
luckily, I taught him everything he knows.
uh, wait. Uh, you don't need to do that.
it's not a problem. I'll have it done by the end of the week.
but if you wanna thank me, think you could find me something cold to drink?
mayor Franklin. What an honor. Paul Young.
you must be the good samaritan I've heard so much about.
this is my wife Beth.
I've never met a celebrity before. - Well, now you have.
the media will be arriving shortly, as well as some of the mayor's supporters.
uh, with the election just a few days away, we thought this could be - a terrific photo op. - No problem.
while you're waiting, would you like a tour of the facility?
Absolutely. I must say, I don't know how you got your neighbors to agree to a halfway house on their street, but they must think a lot of you.
honestly, this is all happening because of what I think of them.
Richard? Is that you?
the lemonade's not quite ready yet.
Richard, would you like a sandwich with that
who are you?
this the halfway house?
uh, no. That's next door.
so I guess we're gonna be neighbors.
well, I'm sure you're in a hurry to get settled in over there, so...
I'm in no hurry.
what's going on in here?
uh, this, um, gentleman just, uh, wandered into my home.
I made a mistake.
won't happen again.
it better not.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I was just, uh, taken by surprise.
you're shaking.
come on. Come on. Come on. - No, really... Really, I'm fine, just, um...
thank you for taking care of that.
what are you doing?
something I've wanted to do for a long time.
you're gonna have to leave.
okay. Maybe I misread some signals.
there have been no signals. I was dating your son.
okay. If that's the way you feel, then I'll finish up out back and go.
I want you to leave now.
look, I made an error in judgment. I'm-i'm sorry.
please let me finish the work. - I said now.
I will leave when I'm finished.
well, here's trouble.
bunch of geeks with "vote franklin" signs just showed up.
looks like we're outnumbered now.
Oh, I'm not worried.
who the hell are they? - The cavalry.
Hey, guys. Guys!
I'm not too late, am I? - Nope.
you're just in time.
okay! Here's the plan.
once the mayor begins his speech, I'll give the signal.
that's when we all begin chanting, okay? You got it?
all right! Let's go!
we need to talk now.
quite a turnout.
look at those news cameras.
uh, do I need a little base? Hi-def is killing me.
where did all these people come from?
I don't know.
but it looks like things are about to get very interesting.
no, no, no! How did she find out?
you told her the other night!
Oh, while we were drinking.
you were drinking. She was listening!
Oh, my god. - Yeah, this is bad.
what else did you say to her?
I mean, she thinks that you still have feelings for me.
Oh, well, that's just... Ridiculous.
she's not gonna say anything to Lynette, is she?
no.
does she want you to tell Lynette?
no, she had a different suggestion.
and I think it's a good one.
I'm going outside to watch the protest.
stay in your room and look after your sister.
Oh! Don't get into those cookies I made.
those are for after supper, and yes, I counted them.
Juanita, what's wrong?
what is that?
the letter you wrote to Grace.
okay.
honey, you really shouldn't have read this...
cause it doesn't mean anything.
grace is your daughter, isn't she?
that's why you've been crying since she left.
you love her more than me.
no. No, no, no! That is not true.
you are the most important thing in this world to me.
you believe mommy, don't you?
you're not my mommy.
Juanita! Come back here!
ladies and gentlemen, I give you mayor Harold Franklin!
save our street!
save our street! Save our street!
save our street!
good afternoon, everybody.
it's a pleasure and an honor to be here...
I thought you said the neighborhood was behind this.
did i? I appear to have been wrong.
...with a troubled past that's is in their neighborhood.
save our street! Save our street!
...inventory of compassionate, understanding people!
if I ever get my hands on Paul Young, I will kill him.
can we talk about this in the hotel?
there's a lot of angry people out there.
I know.
save our street! Save our street!
your actions are a blueprint - Save our street!
for others to emulate. - Save our street!
and that certainly describes the people who live here...
save our street! Save our street!
on wisteria lane. - Hey! I talked to Tom.
this is not the right time to discuss this.
save our street! - Hey, we are discussing it.
Tom told me about your little, uh, suggestion that I need to move off the lane.
and I want you to know, that ain't gonna happen.
you know, if you were really Lynette's friend, you would know that you cannot live two doors down from her husband - A man you still love.
that is none of your damn business. - Really?
cause I am Lynette's friend, and I'm not gonna stand by and watch you screw up her marriage.
so help me, Susan - Hey, get your hands off me.
save our street! Save our street!
save our street! Save our street! Save our street!
I'm parked three blocks away. It's crazy out here.
did you finish up everything?
Oh, yeah. I'm done.
Hey. I got your message.
what's wrong?
I think you should know there's been an incident with your father.
save our street! Save our street!
in particular, there is one man, Paul Young...
Th-though he was unfairly incarcerated, he has chosen...
Carlos! I can't find Juanita.
you let her outside with all this going on?
no, she ran away! She found out about Grace! - How?
look, I'll tell you later. Just help me find her!
Juanita, where are you?
can't I go back and get it? - It's not that important, Lee.
she signed that program after her concert at carnegie hall.
she was a drug addict. Let it go.
can you move, please?!
come on! You son of a bitch.
come here.
what's wrong with you? Look, I made a mistake, okay?
Hey, don't push me.
Hey, one of those cons is beating up a guy.
get him!
Keith! What are you doing?
come on! Get him!
save our street!
...through his generosity.
he has chosen not to be angry or bitter...
get off of him!
lady, take it easy!
...who were once his prison mates.
and I'm honored to present this medallion to a man
and in conclusion, love thy neighbor!
listen to me! If you don't care about my life, think about what you're doing to Lynette!
I am thinking about Lynette!
this would destroy her!
get off of him!
you're pushing!
stop pushing!
go around them! Go around!
I can't! There's people everywhere!
maybe we should go back in the house.
please don't leave me.
Hey! Frank, wait! Wait! What the hell are you doing?!
I'm gonna make sure this halfway house never opens. - Oh, my god!
this is what you want, isn't it? - No, no! Not like this!
give me the bat! Please! - You know what?
go hang out with the rest of the kiddies.
Frank! Frank, wait!
help me, please. - Oh! Mrs. Mccluskey!
Oh, my god! I've got you! I got you.
just drive. They'll move.
Hey! It's them! The ones that sold!
Oh, crap!
Renee! Renee, get off of there!
I'm looking for susan!
it's not safe! Get down!
I saw her fall! I think she's hurt!
get out of the car! Now!
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be okay.
mommy!
get off! Get off!
give her to me! Give her to me!
mommy! - Come here. Come here.
go inside, darling.
this is all on you! I hope you know that!
me? Those are your friends out there, Lynette
the solid citizens of Fairview.
tell me again why you think they're better than a bunch of ex-cons?
stop!
stop it! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Stop!
he's my neighbor!
stop it!
take him over! Get him over here!
come on!
somebody help!
thank you.
it was just before sunrise on wisteria lane.
you could no longer hear the screams of frightened bystanders...
or the angry chanting of protestors...
or the cries for help from the injured.
there were just the footsteps of a man who had finally punished those who had betrayed him.
the silence was broken by something the neighbors would later say...
sounded like a gunshot.
but Paul knew it was the sound of revenge.
the riot left victims in its wake.
do I need a transplant?
you need to come to terms with the reality of what's happened to you.
we'd like to know where exactly you were when your husband was shot.
my wife is the one person on that backstabbing street that I can trust.
so what am I supposed to do, just pretend Grace doesn't exist? - Yes!
Gaby's biological daughter was erased, and she struggled to cope.
I slept with Tom.
and Lynette learned the truth.
Tom Scavo had a 20-year-old secret.
he had once slept with his wife's best friend.
Tom felt it no longer mattered.
but his wife, who had just learned this secret...
felt differently.
that's why she had decided to punish him...
and torture him...
and humiliate him.
Lynette planned to tell her husband she knew.
but first, she was determined...
to have her revenge.
what are my keys doing on the floor?
did my pants just...Rip?
Yeah. You might wanna go up and change.
Wow. Thank god I wasn't going commando.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
is that a seam ripper?
could be. I don't really sew.
did you do something to Tom's pants?
it's just a thing I do whenever I find out he slept with one of my friends.
Ugh! I knew I shouldn't have told you about us.
but you did.
so this is how you're getting back at him?
isn't it a little immature?
my rage needs an outlet.
and you got to admit, it beats smashing his head in with a 9-iron.
well, there is another option.
you could tell him you know and deal with it.
no.
well, why not?
because then he'll tell me he's sorry, and I'll cry, and he'll cry, and then I'll get over it.
and I'm not ready to get over it.
I have a lot of anger to work through before we sweep this under the carpet and move on, so please don't tell him what I'm doing.
but, Lynette, it - come on.
it's not like anybody's getting hurt.
Tom! Are you okay?
Yeah. I slipped on something.
peanut butter?
what... - How Those damn kids.
Yes, Lynette Scavo had developed a taste for revenge.
and she was finding it delicious.
we pass by these people every day.
we sense their isolation...
but we just keep walking...
telling ourselves there's nothing we can do to help...
which we know is a lie.
Hello, reverend. Wonderful sermon today.
thank you, Bree. Do you have a moment?
I need to talk to you about something. - Sure.
one of our parishioners is going through a personal crisis.
she's in desperate need of a friend-someone to talk to.
and you thought of me? I'm flattered.
so you wouldn't mind reaching out to this lost lamb?
Oh, you are the very milk of human kindness.
now, stop. I'm happy to help.
unless you're talking about Beth Young, in which case i'd rather shave my head and join the hare krishnas.
Bree! - I'm sorry, but she is married to the biggest lunatic in fairview.
he tried to destroy our neighborhood, and she did nothing to stop him.
still, the christian thing is to offer her solace.
let him who is without sin cast the first stone.
after all, John, chapter 8, verse 7.
if you do not forgive others their sins, your father will not forgive yours.
Matthew, chapter 6, verse 15.
whoever does not obey the laws of god must surely be punished by death or banishment.
Ezra, chapter 7, verse 26.
Bree Van De Kamp is shacking up with her boyfriend.
Cynthia thomas, pew 5, seat 7.
fine. I'll talk to her.
but this is spiritual blackmail!
I'm a man of god, Bree.
I do what it takes to get the job done.
everything's delicious, Gaby.
thank you. I'm glad you guys could come.
you know us. We never turn down a champagne brunch.
who said anything about champagne?
I did. Come on, people! We need some bubbly!
we gotta celebrate!
celebrate what?
you - Okay, it's kind of a long story.
it all started last year.
we're adopting a child.
you were killing the moment.
meet Liza Hunter-Mcdermott.
Liza?
guess who lost that coin toss.
she's beautiful.
there was a 2-year wait for a baby.
but we found this orphanage that had lots of older kids.
so we figured, why not?
she's 10 years old. And if all goes well, she's ours next month.
well, we're really happy for you guys. Aren't we, Gaby?
Gaby, what's wrong?
uh, nothing.
I'm thrilled for you. Really.
Oh, honey. We didn't even think - With everything you've been going through - she's fine.
it's just...I don't even know where grace is, or...
how she is, or when I'm gonna see her again. - Gaby.
we didn't mean to upset you guys.
it's fine.
she's gone, and now Gaby and I are moving on.
and we've agreed not to talk about it because it is so painful.
I'm sure you understand.
of course.
so, please, tell us more about your little girl. What is she like?
uh, you're gonna love her.
I mean, she's so smart and so funny.
the first time we walked in that room, there was this instant connection.
we just knew she was ours.
you know what? We should make a toast to little Liza.
I'm gonna get that champagne.
look who I found.
what are you doing here?
I told you not to fly home.
Oh, mom. Haven't you learned I don't listen to a word you say?
besides, they won't let you mail a major organ.
Oh, no.
no, don't even think about it. You are not gonna be my donor.
I did tons of research.
they have these new surgical techniques.
it's no worse than a belly piercing...
which I did not do.
you know, the doctor did say that blood relatives are your best chance for a match.
honey, you are not going through the rest of your life with only one kidney.
but, mom- - No.
I'm going on the wait list.
that could take years.
you know, there is another option.
somebody who's close to you that loves you very much.
we've been through this.
you're not the right blood type.
I meant your mother.
my mother?
Mike, I already lost my kidney.
now you want me to lose my mind? No, no, no, no.
we are not asking her for a kidney. No.
in fact, we're not even telling her about this.
we're not?
of course not.
Uh-if she heard one word about this- Oh, my god.
Julie, what did you do?
I'm sorry.
I - You're hurt. I thought you'd want her to know.
and, uh...She'll be here tomorrow.
Oh, my god!
I- I've gotta get out of here.
unhook me. Unhook me!
no, no. Susan, this is good.
you need a kidney, she's got a kidney...
that I will be paying for the rest of my life!
how come you haven't visited?
I gave you my kidney.
why won't you friend me on facebook?
I gave you my kidney. No.
this is a nightmare.
you owe me, Julie, big.
you're right.
how about I give you a kidney?
bigger than that.
don't react.
good ,not reacting.
what the hell are you doing back there?
I can't let her see me talking to you.
who?
Lynette. She knows.
knows what? A-about us?
how?
who cares how? The point is, she found out.
why hasn't she said anything to me?
Oh, she's saying it - Your pants splitting open, falling down the stairs
haven't you noticed you've been a little accident-prone lately?
that was her?
so she's responsible for my flat tire?
the sardines in my gym bag? - Yep.
the gay porn in my powerpoint presentation?
her proudest moment.
so she's just gonna keep on screwing with me?
I mean, what else has she got planned?
I don't know, but she is one angry woman.
be careful. God knows what she'll do next.
what the hell are you doing?
testing the brakes before I get on the highway.
Hi!
I-I haven't seen you out in a while, so I thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing.
what do you really want?
well, I talked to reverend Sykes yesterday, and he tells me that you've been going through kind of a rough patch.
come on in.
you know, growing up, I didn't really have a lot of friends.
we weren't a very...social family.
but I was never hated.
nobody hates you.
but they hate my husband...
don't they?
I just wish people could understand him.
he is not a bad man.
it's just, his life has been so difficult.
he went to prison for a murder he didn't commit.
his wife killed herself.
his son hates him.
he's been through a lot.
well, I may not be able to convince people to like paul, but there's no reason you should suffer for what he's done.
I am having the girls over this week, and I think it would be wonderful if you'd join us.
that's very sweet.
but I think we both know those women aren't gonna want me there.
those women are my dear friends.
trust me. They'll be fine with it.
and if they're not?
well, then I'll just have to twist some very dear arms.
okay, Mrs. Delfino. You're all hooked up.
Where's my daughter? They said she was down here.
do you see her?
Oh, god.
are you in pain?
no, but I will be.
Oh! Susan.
mom.
Oh, my poor, sick baby.
Hello, Mike.
Oh, honey.
I have a surprise for you.
one of your favorite things from home.
get in here!
aunt Claire.
she figured I was cheaper than flowers.
uh, Mike, you haven't met my aunt.
uh, she taught me how to make a Manhattan when I was 8.
I had her up to old fashioneds by the time she was 12
and that's a difficult drink.
she's like the bartender I never had.
so, sweetheart, your mother tells me you have a deformed kidney.
I told her not to sleep on her side.
well, we're hoping to find a donor very soon.
Oh. Wouldn't that be nice?
I wonder who it'll be.
you read all these stories
strangers brought together through life-threatening circumstances.
our best bet is a match within the family.
Oh! Like Julie!
no.
he's 9, mom.
you don't take a kidney out of a 9-year-old.
well, it'd take care of that bed-wetting problem, though, wouldn't it?
you know, we were actually thinking that...
you might be a possible donor, Sophie.
what do you mean,"oh"?
well, it-it's-it's just...It-it's...
I can't believe this.
she's not gonna do it.
of course, she wants to.
it's...it's just the timing of things.
Morty and I are about to take a cruise...
for three months.
a cruise?
nonrefundable.
and you won't even get tested.
you know, we haven't even checked in at the hotel yet.
uh, why don't we do that?
Yes, okay.
we'll be back in an hour or two.
and if you're better, if you feel like it, maybe we'll take you shopping.
actually, I'm having my blood washed for the next six hours.
but go! You two have fun.
hey ,there
perfect timing.
I made your favorite - Double fudge brownies.
well, I had a big lunch, and I don't want any more pants ripping, so...
no, thanks.
what are you talking about? You look great.
have one. It won't kill ya.
Yeah. Maybe later.
are you sure?
they're tasty.
Ooh. Brownies. Can I have one?
Uh...No.
Yeah. Sure, Penny, have one.
No! I mean...
I don't want her to spoil her dinner.
besides, I made these for your dad.
Oh, I can share.
here, Penny.
take it.
eat it.
No!
you guys are weird.
What'd you put in there - Cayenne pepper?
drain cleaner?
so Renee told you. I am gonna kill her.
let's get back to how you're trying to kill me!
don't you dare act like the injured party here.
you betrayed me! You had an affair!
it wasn't an affair!
it was completely meaningless!
it was after we were engaged!
no, we had broken up, remember?
no, no, we were taking a break, remember?
Yes, we were fighting constantly, so we decided to spend some time apart to decide whether we were gonna get married or split up.
right!
so I went to my mom's house to think about it, and I will never forget this.
I was sitting in the kitchen.
my mom was making a frittata.
and I thought,"oh, I should make that for Tom," and then it hit me.
there might be no Tom.
I might never see you again.
and I had an epiphany.
I didn't want a life without you in it.
Yeah. I was at a crossroads, and I chose the path that included you, and you know what kills me?
while I was making that decision, you were off...
sleeping with my best friend.
that was fun.
I've been kind of down lately, and, well...
nothing like a little retail therapy.
Yes, I'd say you had a real breakthrough around the fourth shoe store.
please tell me Carlos isn't having an affair with a tiny naked person.
Oh, my god! What the hell are you doing?
playing with my new doll.
look, she can leap off cliffs.
no, no!
this is not your doll!
then whose is it? I found it in your closet.
Oh, my god. Where's her arm? Where's her arm?
Ohh. For god sakes.
Celia, this is not a toy!
Yeah, it is.
No! It's not!
it's something special that belongs to me!
it is mine, and no one can take it away from me!
I'm sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.
is everything okay in here?
mommy's mad because we played with her doll.
go to your room.
go! Both!
your doll?
of course it's not mine. It's...
a gift for Bob and Lee.
they're adopting a little girl.
let me get your discharge papers, and I'll be back to wheel you out.
thank you.
Hey, uh, Mike's bringing the car around front.
I will, uh, get your bag.
Hey, what is that on your arm? Did you get a blood test?
I just...Wanted to see
I am not taking your kidney.
relax. I wasn't a match.
but if I was and I didn't check,
I never would've forgiven myself.
come here.
you know...
when you were growing up, sometimes I felt like I was just winging it.
and then I see the incredible woman you've become, and I know I did something right.
wh-where's my daughter? Did they move her?
I'm telling you, it's the other end of the hall.
I'm here!
Hello, sweetie.
what are you doing?
well, you're getting discharged today, and I came to help.
let me take that bag.
no. I wouldn't want you to pull something and not be able to play shuffleboard on your cruise.
Well...How about I take us all out for a nice lunch?
I can't. I'm on a restricted diet, and M. J. Is waiting for me at home.
I'd like to be there for my child.
come on. Let's go.
let me at least push your chair.
I'm good.
Susie, I want to help.
you do not get to "help" by pushing my wheelchair.
you had your chance to help.
Susan, be fair.
No!
how could you refuse to even be tested?
my own mother!
Julie couldn't wait to hand over one of her kidneys.
well, there you go. Problem solved.
I wasn't a match.
that is not the point.
you only had a 15% chance of being a match.
that meant there was an 85% chance that I'd never know how little you cared about me.
I could've gone the rest of my life thinking you were a wonderful mother who had the wrong kind of kidney.
now wait a second here- - No, no, no, no, claire. It's okay.
I am...
sorry I disappointed you, honey.
Hey. - Can we talk for a minute?
that depends. Are you alone? - Yes.
then we can talk. You wanna come in?
that depends. Do you have beer?
Yes. - Then I'll come in.
I, uh, I need a favor.
I want you to let your mom off the hook.
no way.
I'm-I'm done with her.
Susan, there are some...
things you don't know.
like what?
what could you possibly tell me that would excuse her behavior?
I'm her daughter.
this is my hour of need, and she's not even trying to help.
no. I'm not gonna forgive her for this, ever.
she has cancer.
what? - Breast cancer.
they caught it early, and... We'll see how it goes.
she's starting chemo next week.
well, what about the cruise?
that is the cruise.
that's the story we're telling because she didn't want you to know.
and that's why... She can't give you a kidney.
why wouldn't she tell me? This doesn't make sense. You know mom.
I mean, since when has she passed up a chance for attention?
Ecxactly,
she decided no, not this time.
she wasn't gonna burden you.
and I jumped all over her.
I gotta go talk to her. - No, no. Don't tell her you know.
why not? - Susan, please.
respect what she's trying to do here.
she's trying to make up for a lifetime of "me, me, me. " Let her.
Oh, dear. This is why people should never let children play with dolls.
but don't worry.
I'll have princess valerie all sewn up and good as new by the end of the day.
thank you so much.
can I ask you something?
of course.
am I... Weird for being so attached to a doll?
I only bought her because I thought she was beautiful, and she reminded me of someone, but lately...
I'm starting to feel like I need her.
she... Calms me down when I get upset, and I enjoy spending time with her.
the thought of leaving here without her is really upsetting.
that's crazy, right?
come with me.
you know, what you've been feeling is absolutely normal.
well, tell that to my friend Bree.
I was holding that doll, and she looked at me like I was insane.
most people will never understand, but I do.
let me introduce you to someone. This is Mrs. Humphries.
I saw her in a window in a tiny shop in ohio and fell in love, and the more time we spent together, the more I got to know her story.
her story?
of course. Every doll has a story, and it turns out Mrs. Humphries started her own business, just like I did.
she has a music shop, and she teaches piano.
and she... Told you that?
Gaby, dolls don't talk.
but even so, Mrs. Humphries is always there for me.
you see, her sister passed away around the same time mine did.
ever since... She's brought me such happiness.
isn't it... Funny how a doll can do that?
and the best thing is, they'll never leave you.
so... What's your doll's story?
I don't know. - Oh, of course you do. Tell me.
her... Name is princess Valerie. She's a princess.
but she wasn't always one. - Really?
when she was born, there was a mix-up, and she was given to the wrong family.
nobody knew for a long time.
but one day, she find way to home.
from that day on, princess Valerie never left the palace.
her real mother kept her hidden away so no one would take her.
and they were never separated...
ever again.
I know I'm not sleeping in here tonight.
I am unbelievably sorry about this.
I - I wanted to tell you so many times, but...
I - I could never find the right moment. It...
Really?
in 20 years of marriage, there was never a lull in the conversation for you to say, "hey, guess who I slept with"?
when would have been a good time?
the day I found out you were pregnant with Porter and Preston?
Parker's 1st birthday party?
the morning that Penny took her first steps?
we have had... Such beautiful moments together.
I - I didn't wanna ruin a single one of them.
I hope you can forgive me for this.
it would be a shame...
a shame if some meaningless encounter 20 years ago ruined this wonderful life that we have built together.
I'm sorry I didn't call first.
you're not busy, are you?
I'm just packing. Uh, my cab's gonna be here soon.
so... Y-you have time to talk?
sure.
I, um... Well, I just... Wanted to apologize for yesterday.
Oh. No need. This is...
a horrible time for you, and you've got so much on your mind.
it's - It's not that horrible, and the doctors are very optimistic that we're going to find a donor.
I'm not worried.
I'm so relieved.
you know what the one good thing about having a health scare is?
no.
what?
makes you think about what the important things are.
that's very true.
we all think that we're...
gonna be here forever, that we have...
all the time in the world to say the important things, but we don't.
why don't you and I ever tell each other how we feel?
we don't need to.
we know how we feel.
do we?
you're right.
you already know how much I love you.
and you already know that anytime I accomplish anything, you're the first person I wanna call,'cause I love making you proud.
and you know that...
no matter how much you make me crazy...
part of me enjoy it because it reminds me that nobody else has a mom like you.
Yeah. I don't have to tell you that.
just like I don't need to tell you that my life began the day you were born.
and it's been such a happy one.
aren't we lucky we already know those things?
yes? Yes. I'll be right down.
it's my cab.
you go, and I, uh...
I'll call you later.
okay.
you know, one of these days, I would - I would like for us to take a little trip, just the two of us.
Oh, I'd like that.
you know, we'll go someplace hot and just lay out and drink some daiquiris.
Oh, we'll... Absolutely do that.
just as soon as I'm done with my cruise.
Yeah.
no offense, Penny, but soccer's boring.
Yeah, it's as boring as... Actually, there's nothing more boring.
you can tell us about it later.
but you have to go.
it's a playoff game.
they're the best team in the league.
I need your support.
Oh, who cares? You guys suck anyway.
Yeah, they may suck, but they still would've beaten parker's team.
Hey, Preston, uh, how did the baseball team do senior year?
shut up. At least I played.
that's true. Remember that time he struck out five times?
by the third time, the crowd started laughing.
Yeah, that was hilarious.
your last at-bat, the other team sat on their mitts.
Oh, so embarrassing. - Shameful.
come on, you guys. Please?
I got stuff to do. - Like what?
stare in the mirror and wait for the first mustache hair?
relax, Penny.
at least you won't have to share your snacks with us after the game.
okay, fine. Don't go.
we're just messing with you.
we're going. - Thank you.
I'm even gonna drive you, but I'm gonna warn you, if you lose, you're walking home.
Oh, please. - Yeah. I'm not driving losers in my car.
does that mean you're not taking Preston?
here you go, ladies.
Oh, Bree, that looks amazing.
thank you so much for putting this together.
it really feels like old times.
well, you have been through so much, and I wanted you to feel loved and embraced by all the people in this room.
and while I'm on the topic of embracing people,
I have invited our neighbor Beth to join us.
cheese puff, anyone?
married to Paul Young?
the lady with the bad hair?
Oh, forget the hair! Her husband caused the riot.
which caused Susan a kidney.
why would you do this, Bree?
I just felt sorry for her.
the poor woman has been shunned by everyone in this neighborhood.
because she's married to a monster.
so? Why should she have to suffer for the sins of her husband?
Oh, crap. She's been talking to a priest.
Renee, help us out. Tell her she's crazy.
uh, actually, I'm with Bree.
please, you've never given beth a chance, and speaking as the other new kid on the block, you guys are like the mean, pretty girls who won't let anyone sit at your lunch table.
that is so unfair.
who invited her?
okay, that's Beth. Now, please, ladies, make an effort for me.
I'm actually excited.
I always wanted to be one of the mean, pretty girls.
Yeah, I got a delivery for Van De Kamp.
Ooh, how lovely.
I don't see a card. Who are they from?
uh, beats me.
must be my boyfriend.
would you mind setting them over there?
I'll go get a tip.
is it her, or can I wipe this fake smile off my face?
it's a deliveryman. Someone sent me flowers.
was it the pope?
here you go. Thank you.
Oh, good! You made it.
hello.
ladies, Beth's here!
you're sure this is okay?
it isn't gonna be awkward?
of course not! The girls are delighted you're here.
we are going to have a wonderful time.
that is a really good deal on potting soil. - Yes.
well, again, I had a coupon.
that is fortunate.
maybe I should go. - no, no, the evening has just gotten started.
I'm gonna need some help in the kitchen - You, you, you, and you. now.
by the way, I know somebody who can really help you with that hair. - Renee!
what is wrong with you people? You said you'd make an effort.
I am making an effort - An effort not to tear out my deformed kidney and cram it down her throat.
Yeah, so Beth's feeling a little lonely these days.
why is it our responsibility to make her feel loved?
okay, look, I didn't wanna bring this up, but let's talk about the last woman who was married to Paul Young - A woman who was in pain, and we ignored it.
do we really want Beth to end up like Mary Alice?
we're back.
we've decided to kick this party up a notch.
lovely. - Yeah. Sit here.
we'll pour you some vino. - Thank you.
is red okay? Because we have white, too.
uh, no, red is fine.
what in the world?
somebody lose a gun?
Oh, my god. What is that doing there?
no, I keep all my weapons in a locker. Let me see that.
it's a. 38 caliber.
the police said... Paul was shot with a. 38.
I think I finally understand why you invited me over.
Meaning?
I'm just thinking how convenient it is - A gun that may have been used to shoot paul was under my pillow?
a - and now has my fingerprints on it?
Hey, I was sitting there before you were, and I didn't feel any gun.
Yeah, speaking of convenient...
you're alone in the room, we came back, and suddenly there's a gun under the cushion?
where would I get a gun?
Oh, I don't know.
how about the one you pointed at me on halloween night?
you never told us that.
you mean the night you broke into my house and tried to kill my husband with a club?
you never told us that, either.
I'm allowed to have a private life.
the point is, she owns a gun just like the one that magically appeared when she was alone in the room.
you're all in on this.
you wanted to set me up.
I can't believe you would say to that to me after I reached out to you.
well, I think it's time I did some reaching out of my own.
I'm calling the police.
we don't have to get up early tomorrow.
so I was thinking...
maybe we could - I still cannot believe that I fell for Beth's act.
or we could talk about this some more.
well, she is just as twisted as that husband of hers, and I am a fool.
you're not a fool.
you're a kind and generous person.
that's what I love about you.
that and the fact that you can go from...
mad to passionate in a heartbeat.
I suppose you do deserve some loving...
after those beautiful flowers you sent me.
at the risk of... Going to bed frustrated...
I didn't send you any flowers.
you didn't? Then where did they come from?
we pass by these people every day, but we never look at them.
we don't wanna see the sadness in their expressions...
the longing in their hearts...
the loneliness in their eyes...
but there are times we should stop and look at these isolated people.
Why?
well, if we look close enough... We might just recognize them.
Keith moved in with Bree.
Susan came to grips with her future.
dialysis until they find me a donor.
well, that won't take very long, will it?
three to five years.
in grief over losing her biological daughter...
grace no longer exists, and that is the last time you will mention her name in this house!
Gaby sought comfort from an unusual source.
and there were some surprises...
somebody lose a gun?
including a long lost son...
you didn't mention your mother-in-law.
my mother-in-law?
and a shocking revelation for Paul.
Felicia Tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths to cause you harm.
paul Young had made a discovery - his wife was a liar.
she had lied with every smile, with every caress, and with every kiss.
Yes, paul now knew their entire marriage was a fraud.
the only thing he didn't know...
hey there.
was how he would punish her.
you're packing?
I thought you weren't coming home until tomorrow.
I talked the doctor into letting me out early.
I'm glad.
I really need you right now.
things on the street have been getting very strange.
Beth, things on that street have always been very strange.
well, yes, but...
remember I told you how bree was inviting me over for drinks with the other women?
and I told you not to go.
well, I should've listened.
turns out they're trying to frame me.
frame you?
while I was there, I found a gun under my sofa cushion.
it was a. 38
the same caliber the police said you were shot with.
they must've planted it there.
and the gun just magically appeared? - Yes.
I'm sure bree's going to turn it over to the police, and they're going to think I shot you.
you don't have to worry about what anyone else thinks.
I know the truth.
Hey, here's an idea.
why don't we take a trip?
a trip?
we need to get away.
we'll go somewhere...
secluded.
that sounds like heaven.
Yes...Paul had no choice but to punish his wife...
I love you.
because some lies...
are unforgiveable.
we are reminded every spring...
with every rose that blooms, with every sunflower that blossoms, with every lily that buds.
the world is a beautiful place.
sadly, it is filled with people who do ugly things...
constantly.
that woman who just drove away-who was she?
uh...a friend.
you're friends with Barbara Fairchild, the interior designer?
Bob? - Or should I say, the inferior designer?
Hey, Renee.
how could you hire Barbara Fairchild when you know
I just started my own interior design firm?
uh...
we're not hiring her.
Oh? Why you holding swatches?
and people think you're the smart one.
look, you know we just adopted a little girl.
well, we hired Barbara to decorate her room.
well, why not hire me?
you're not exactly maternal.
we-we wanted this room to be pink and nurturing, and your style seems more like chrome and glass and...
teeth.
look who's back to being the smart one.
look, Fairchild is a hack.
whatever she quoted you, i'll come in 2 days earlier and 20% cheaper.
Barbara is kind of expensive.
done. I'll get started right away.
just so you know, our daughter gets here in a week.
and just so you know, I'm as maternal as the next woman.
Hi, honey. You want some lunch?
no, I want an explanation.
I just got our credit card bill.
$840 at miss Charlotte's Doll academy?
did I say lunch?
I meant sex. Do you want some sex?
why are you buying our kids fancy toys?
last week, Juanita used her doll's leg to scrape peanut butter out of the jar.
okay, the doll wasn't for Juanita.
it's for...
Bob and Lee, for the little girl they're adopting.
you spent $800 on a gift?
it made me feel good, okay?
for the first time in weeks, I'm not staying in bed till 2: 00 in the afternoon or staying up all night sobbing.
so I went a little crazy on the credit card. Just let me be happy.
but $800?!
Carlos, if you get this worked up now, you'll have no place to go when the bill for the platinum card comes in.
uh, excuse me?
Hi.
I'm looking for Keith Watson.
his roommate told me he moved here.
uh, yes, but he's not available at the moment.
can I give him a message, miss...
sorry. I'm Amber James.
I just need to talk to him about something.
it's kind of important.
well, I would be happy to tell him what it's regarding if you...
tell me...
what it's regarding.
we're just...Old friends.
I'm at the fairview motor inn.
could you ask him to come by?
why exactly would he be doing that?
you're...kind of a nosy landlady, aren't you?
I'm not his landlady. I'm his girlfriend.
so he...
lives here with you?
Yes.
Yeah, of - Of course he does.
of course he does.
are you all right?
um, yeah, I'm fine.
you know what? Don't even, uh, don't even tell him I came by.
there's no message. Sorry to disturb you.
okay, you're all set.
the dialysis will take six hours.
if you need anything, just hit the call button. - Will do.
I'm Susan.
it's my first time in here.
sounds like you've been coming here for a while.
four years.
any tips for a newbie?
like, which nurse has the shakes or where do they hide the good painkillers?
look, nothing personal, but I don't want to be your dialysis buddy.
I wanna sit here and play scrabble on my phone while this -while this machine washes my blood.
so you don't want to talk or be friendly or keep each other company?
sad, isn't it?
sometimes when I meet people, they say,"you don't seem like a Susan.
but you...
why are you putting out those ugly candlesticks?
Oh. Who gave them to me?
Yay! Grandma's coming.
Yep, and your brother just pulled up with her.
this could be your last chance to run screaming from the room.
Why? I love grandma.
I do, too, sweetie. It's just...
I can only take her in small doses, and unfortunately, your grandma doesn't come in small doses.
Hey! Easy over the threshold!
you're not transporting meat.
okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.
she's going back in a cab.
mom! Hi! - Oh! Mwah!
Oh, my gosh! What happened to your foot?
Oh, I-I broke it a month ago.
uh, thanks for checking in.
Oh, I'm sorry. We've just been so busy, and...
penny, look, your grandma's here. Give her a kiss.
Hey, look at you.
you're getting buds!
Aw. be thankful she didn't yell it to you as you were getting on the bus.
So...Uh, what's new?
Well...Actually, um, I started an interior design business.
do you remember my friend renee?
I'm getting married.
what?
married?
to who?
we met in water aerobics at the retirement community.
only man in the pool. I was lucky to get him.
this is kind of a shock. I didn't even know you were dating.
So...When's the wedding?
Saturday.
this saturday?
uh, and you're just telling me now?
well, maybe if you visited more often... - More often.
I know. I know. So...
do I get to meet him?
I mean, if you're going to make this kind of commitment...
what? You wanna make sure his intentions are honorable?
Lynette, I hate to break this to you.
I am not a virgin.
mom...
I want to meet him.
all right, come by tomorrow, and we'll squeeze you in between "nothing to do" and "waiting for death." ...
are you all right? - What?
you were yelling in your sleep.
Really?
Yes, you were shouting out,"amber! Amber!
what could that mean?
I'm...I'm doing a painting job.
I'm thinking about, uh...
shades of yellow that go in the kitchen.
Nope. Definitely not a color.
sounded like a name-amber.
know anyone by that name?
I once had a girlfriend named amber.
did you?
and at this time i'd like to point out that dreaming of an old girlfriend is not cheating.
Well...When was this?
you never told me about her.
I - I don't know. Seven years ago?
seven years?
was it serious?
we lived together...
for, uh, three years.
so you were in love with her.
Well...Yeah, until she left me.
so she left you.
you miss her?
I tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart.
now if you don't mind, i'm gonna go back to sleep so I can dream about you.
it's so great visiting a retirement village - 2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped.
Hey, mom. Mwah.
Lynette...This is frank.
it is so nice to meet you, frank.
call me "dad.
wouldn't it be awful if I was that guy?
so...
Frank, um, I've just been dying to meet you, and
just a sec. Hey, muchacho.
we've been waiting ten minutes for our menu.
what do I got to do to get you to hurry it over, build a fence?
Hey, it's a menu, not a high school diploma.
I'm sure you can find one somewhere.
Oh, yeah. You were saying something?
Lynette's been dying to meet you.
she has so many questions.
Oh, go ahead.
I got time to kill while I'm waiting for pancho villa to get my menu.
okay. Uh...
I was just wondering, what made you decide to propose to my mother?
I love her. What do you think?
Aw. What a short...
angry story.
Frank...Is very to the point.
that's what first attracted me to him.
Oh.
what else you need to know?
um, have you ever been married before?
three times-two dead and two left me.
Oh, wait a minute. That's four. Yeah, then make it four.
now...you done grilling me?
Yes. I think I've learned everything I need to know.
Hi, Gaby. - Hey, Karen.
I wanted to get the name of that chinese place you and Roy are always raving about.
come on in. I'll get you the address.
Carlos is a little grumpy since the credit card bills came in.
I figured a little m. s.g. should calm him down.
I've got a menu here somewhere.
I never noticed that before.
what? - That doll.
Oh, Adelaide.
heck, I've had her since forever.
she was my best friend growing up.
I couldn't bear to toss her, so there she is.
I didn't know you were into dolls.
I'm not really into them.
Oh! Here's the menu.
where did, uh, that come from?
I carry her around with me.
you do?
Mm-hmm. Her name's princess Valerie.
Oh! Look! They could be sisters.
okay.
Oh, I have an idea.
miss Charlotte's Doll academy, where I got valerie, has this tearoom.
it is beautiful.
all of us should go sometime.
by all of us, you mean the dolls?
of course. Should I make a reservation?
Well...Maybe. I'm kinda curious to see where this all goes.
here. - Thanks.
Oh, no!
what's wrong?
I said "no mayo," like, 15 times.
I'll trade with you. Do you want my salad?
uh, let me check.
Nope, still got a penis.
I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.
I'll get you a new one.
I got tee time in ten minutes.
so go! It'll be waiting for you at the condo, wrapped in foil, with an ice cold beer when you get there.
you're - You're so good to me.
see you at the wedding, lorraine.
so what do you think?
well, he's quite a...
I wouldn't even know where to...
okay, he's gone.
how can you marry that jerk?
Lynette! - I mean it.
he's abrasive, obnoxious, borderline racist - No, he crossed the border of racist.
he lives in racist.
you cannot seriously love him.
I don't.
you...you don't?
then why are you marrying him?
because he's loaded, and he hates his kids, and he's got a bad ticker.
and when he kicks the bucket, I get everything.
you're marrying him for his money?
please.
I married for love three times and ended up brokenhearted and piss-poor.
and by the way, he's getting something out of this, too.
you wanna know how I really broke my foot?
what are you doing up? Is everything all right?
couldn't sleep.
I've just been...
sitting here, thinking.
about what?
I have so much hatred inside me...
from my neighbors who betrayed me...
for my son who disowned me.
for whoever tried to kill me.
I'm tired of hating people, but I don't know how to stop.
what a thing to say.
stop being so hard on yourself.
you're a decent man.
you just need to focus on what's good in your life.
what is that again?
well, for starters, me.
I do think about you...
all the time.
from the first moment I met you, all I wanted was for you to love me.
and...
here we are.
here we are.
you're just tired.
come back to bed.
all right.
tomorrow we can talk about our trip.
we need to decide where we're going.
Yes, about that...
I booked us a cabin in the woods.
cabin?
Oh, that sounds...Rustic.
I need to go somewhere far away where nobody can find us.
okay.
you can be happy, Paul.
you just need to identify what's negative in your life...
and then get rid of it.
that sounds like a plan.
Hey, Karen.
Gaby's in the kitchen.
actually, I wanna talk to you about Gaby.
how's she doing lately?
well, you know, we went through kind of a rough patch, but I think she's coming around now.
yeah?
well, think again.
girls, dinner's ready! I made your favorite...
what are you doing here?
Gaby. aah! Jeez! You scared me.
this wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it?
why'd you lie to me?
because I knew you wouldn't understand.
you spent $800 on a doll for yourself.
Y- you're right. I- I don't understand.
Oh, please. Like this is any crazier than your collections.
a steroid freak hits a baseball over a fence, and you paid thousands of dollars for it.
Yeah, well, I don't carry it around with me or take it to tea.
okay, first of all, Mrs. Mccluskey has a big mouth.
second, the doll makes me happy. What do you care?
Gaby, I want
but this is not about a doll.
you know what? I don't want to talk about this anymore.
this is clearly about Grace.
No! No! No!
we're not supposed to talk about her! that was your rule!
I'm going to get ready for dinner.
Hey, Susan.
I kept her warm for ya.
Thanks, Ethan.
Hey, how was your history final?
aced it. Thank you for studying with me.
no problem. I'll see you thursday. -Yeah.
look, I know you don't wanna talk, but I thought it would be more fun to play with me than with your phone.
Thanks, but I'll take the phone.
you know, this whole experience is miserable and isolating enough.
I don't understand why you wanna make it worse by ignoring someone who's going through the same ordeal.
Susan, did you ever see the old war movie where the fresh young kid comes in all bright-eyed, and the old vet won't give him the time of day?
I hate war movies. - Okay.
what about the one where the girl moves to a different town, and the mean cheerleader at her new school doesn't wanna hang out with her?
go on. - I'm the mean cheerleader. Okay?
and I'm letting you know we're not going to be friends.
you know, I can see why you're frustrated.
waiting for a transplant is brutal. I - I get that.
but that doesn't mean that you can't try to stay positive while you wait for the good news.
the good news?
when this beeper goes off, that means someone died.
that's what we're waiting for - For some poor son of a bitch who didn't use a helmet or a seat belt to die.
we're waiting for a doctor to ask a family who, moments earlier, lost someone they loved to let them harvest their organs.
and then we're waiting to see who gets them. That's what we do.
we wait for tragedy and then cross our fingers that it's us they wake up at 2: 00 in the morning with the good news.
Susan... I know your intentions are good, but you don't have to distract me or entertain me or comfort me.
I wasn't trying to comfort... You.
Hi, Amber. - What are you doing here?
well, you seemed so upset when you came over, and obviously it involves keith, or you wouldn't have come looking for him, and so naturally i'm concerned.
everything's fine. It's not a big deal.
anyway, I'm... Sort of in the middle of packing, so...
mommy, I can't find my ball. - Charlie, I'll be with you in a second, okay?
how old is Charlie? - 6.
Keith and I would be great for a while and then not so great.
I had actually moved out before I realized I was pregnant.
so why didn't you tell Keith?
I had actually decided to give up the baby, and I knew he would try and talk me out of it.
then I changed my mind the moment I saw Charlie.
after that, it just never felt right to come back and ambush him with a kid. - And yet...
here you are, ambushing. - It's just...
Charlie is at that age where he's starting to ask a lot of questions, and I'm running out of ways to be vague.
so Charlie is the only reason you came?
okay. Maybe I... was kind of wondering if keith would still be...
but I'm glad he's happy. You seem really great.
I know I owe it to charlie to tell Keith. It's just...
I don't think I can do it.
would you like me to? - You would do that?
I think I have to.
now, it's not exactly finished yet.
I'm still waiting on a few pieces, and the curtains are on back order.
don't worry. I'm sure it's amazing.
but you did keep the receipts, right?
Oh, my god. It's exactly the room I wanted when I was growing up.
I mean, the only thing that's missing is... Baby unicorns!
so... You like it?
Oh, we love it. Thank you, renee.
it's everything we'd hoped for.
how did you put this together so quickly?
Oh, it was easy.
I've been thinking about this room for 20 years.
Really?
sighs there was a ti when I thought I might have kids.
I used to imagine the kind of room I'd want my daughter to have.
right down to the last detail.
I never knew you thought about kids.
well, that was a long time ago.
it's never too late. Heck, if we can adopt...
excuse me. I've gotta find that painter.
this is not the color we agreed on for the trim.
I can't do it. I can't be a party to this.
I can't wheel her down the aisle to marry some jackass she doesn't even love.
Lynette, you have to do this.
besides, you know, think of what's at stake now.
what are you talking about?
well, you know, how can I put this delicately?
I mean, today your mother has money.
someday soon she will die.
the day after that, Tom and Lynette have money.
that's a horrible thing to say.
well, just saying, you've always wanted to put Paige in private school, and I've always wanted to know what it's like to sleep on a yacht.
you're lucky you're holding the baby.
Lynette, in all seriousness, it's your mother's wedding day.
if you don't support her, you're gonna ruin your relationship.
Lynette! - Yeah?
they're playing my song. Are you ready to wheel me down?
what are you doing?
okay, here's the thing. I can't let you do this.
who asked you?
you can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.
mom, you want me to visit more often?
that is never gonna happen if you're with him.
and think about the example you are setting your grandchildren - Marrying a guy for his money.
now, look, Tom and I have a little savings. - Lynette,
I know frank's a bit of an acquired taste. But...
he needs me.
nobody needs me anymore.
your sisters are always busy. I never see you.
I try to see you as much as I can, but... - I know.
your family needs you. And frank... Needs me.
why didn't you tell me this?
why did you let me think it was all about the money?
I guess it was easier to say that than to admit how... useless and...
lonely I feel.
okay.
Hello? We're trying to have a wedding out here.
Oh, sorry! My daughter doesn't think you're good enough for me.
she's right. Now hurry it up.
this church is in one of those ethnic neighborhoods, and I'm worried about the car.
Renee, there is someone we'd like you to meet.
this is our daughter.
hello.
we just picked her up from the airport, and we wanted you to be the first person on the lane to meet her.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
we know. - I think I'm gonna start getting her settled in.
say good-bye to Mrs. Perry. - bye.
come on. She's absolutely precious.
Yeah. We're very lucky.
listen, can I ask you for a favor?
Lee, you know I don't like sentences that start that way.
Bob and I have been thinking, and even though I know we are gonna be great fathers, there may be times that jenny needs to talk to a woman about... Stuff.
and on those rare occasions, I was wondering if we could bring her over here.
well... Sure.
great. I will go tell our daughter that if she needs anything, she can count on her old auntie Renee.
and if she ever calls me "old auntie," I will kick her.
got it. Sorry.
those are beautiful, susan. - Thank you, ethan.
don't worry. They're not for you.
they're for people who still possess an ounce of humanity.
whatever you say, pollyanna.
but if I see any mylar balloons with-with dogs wearing stethoscopes, i'm filing a complaint.
why are you always so miserable? - it's called anger, Susan.
I'm sure you have it, too, right underneath that "hang in there, kitty" smile.
Hey, Dick, take it easy. - It's okay, ethan. Fine.
you're angry. The rest of us aren't.
so stop dragging us into your circle of self-pity.
come on. - It's me.
I'm so happy for you. - Thank you.
I gotta go call my mom.
ready, Susan? - yes.
actually, um, I-if it's okay, i'm gonna... Sit over here today.
sure.
what are you doing?
leaving a note for the gardener.
if he has any more problems with those sprinklers,
I want him to know that we'll be at the cabin.
Oh. Good idea.
Beth, I think we should bring some extra blankets. It might get cold.
would you mind grabbing a couple? - Not at all.
detectives. Everything okay?
I'm sure your wife told you a gun was recently discovered at Bree Van De Kamp's house.
Yes, apparently it was the same caliber that I was shot with.
Bree seems to think your wife planted it there, hoping to implicate some of her friends in your shooting.
what an imagination she has.
so you've never seen this before?
Mr. Young? - Yes.
you seemed to have quite a reaction there.
I'm not comfortable around firearms, that's all.
well, just to be clear, you do not believe this belongs to your wife.
detectives, I know for a fact this is not beth's gun. Good day.
should we take two blankets or three?
forget the blankets. The trip's off.
what? Why?
I got a call. There's a problem with the cabin.
Oh, shoot. And I was so looking forward to it.
trust me, Beth. I think you dodged a bullet here.
I don't know what you do to this chicken, but it's the best thing that I've ever had.
so i, um, stopped by Bob and Lee's house.
they're so excited about finally becoming fathers.
which got me to thinking,
I know you had said that you were okay with not being able to have a child.
is that... Still the case?
uh, yeah. - That didn't sound very convincing.
it's kind of a weird question. - Okay, well, let me rephrase it.
if you had the chance to be a father, would you take it?
Bree, where is this coming from? I thought we dealt with this.
well, I just wanna make sure.
I don't want you to see Bob and Lee with their child and start to have regrets.
what do you want me to say?
all right, there was a time in my life when I thought, yeah.
Yeah. I'd love to be a dad, but then I met you.
I'm just saying...
if you had the choic. - I don't.
this is really good chicken.
so? - I'm sorry.
he doesn't even wanna meet Charlie?
well, you have to understand that after six years, Keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone.
why did I wait so long?
again, I am so sorry.
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
please. Keith and I feel that we really need to do something.
so please... Take it.
sorry. I had to show the sitter how to work the tv.
now where is this chinese pl - aah!
you put her in a car seat?
Oh. Well, she's expensive, and the way you drive...
honey, I've been thinking.
maybe we should go see a therapist together.
I don't need a therapist. - I think you do.
maybe I haven't been fair to you.
but you do really need to talk to someone about this.
Carlos, I'm not crazy.
well, then should I change the reservation to three?
don't be ridiculous. She's not gonna sit with us. She fits right in my bag.
this doesn't look like a place you'd put a restaurant.
no, it looks like a place you'd bury a body.
will you please just put the address into the navigation system?
for the tenth time, I don't need it. I know where oak park is.
Carlos, I'm starving!
I will not think you're weak if you use a navigation system!
fine. I'll use it.
I'd much rather listen to that annoying voice than that one.
what's the address?
okay. It's 1-1-9. - Get out of the car!
Oh, god! - Okay, okay, take it easy, man.
now! - Get out. We're doing it. Be cool.
uh, can you hold on?
what do you mean, hold on? ! get the hell out of the car!
Gaby! - I gotta get my baby!
Oh, crap. Just...
it's a doll! What are you trying to pull, bitch? !
Oh, god. - Get out before I put a bullet in you!
No! - Gaby!
get out!
I can't get the buckle! - Gaby, come on!
I can't get the buckle! I can't get the buckle! Get-uhh! No!
Ohh! My baby! My baby! My baby! My baby!
Gaby! It's not Grace!
what are you doing to your roses?
pruning them.
looks like you're killing them.
I know it looks bad, but sometimes you have to be ruthless if you want something beautiful to keep growing.
the world is filled with people who do ugly things.
why do they act this way?
some lie to keep from losing what they love.
some lash out because they fear the future.
some put up walls because they have regrets.
Yes, everyone has a reason for the ugly things they do...
and once we find out why...
then we can try to stop them.
I love this job.
Tom's career took off.
and you gave me the confidence to jump at it.
I could kill you right now, or I could do this.
Felicia made peace with Paul...
and don't you worry about Paul.
or so he thought.
I'll make him pay for what he did to you.
look, I'm your landlord. I have a right to come in.
but it was Susan who gave him hope.
I remember a guy that used to live on this street.
he had a laugh you could hear three houses away.
I'm not that man anymore. - I think you can be.
who do you want in your life - Me or Bree? Choose.
and Gaby made a decision.
can I stay with you for a while? - Of course.
girls, come on. Go on in.
Bree Van de Kamp had occasionally found her home invaded by household pests.
and her manner of dealing with them was ruthless.
she smashed them.
she poisoned them.
she executed them.
but when it came to the latest pests who had invaded Bree's home...
extermination was not an option.
girls! There's mud on your shoes! Mud on your shoes!
girls! We are guests here! What have I said about wiping your feet?
sorry.
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Just-uh, uh, never mind.
it hasn't rained in three weeks. Where did they find mud?
honey, they don't find mud. Mud finds them.
so, um, speaking of the fun we've been having, how long do you think it'll be before you and carlos make up and you can all... Go back home?
eh, a few days.
he'll be sitting alone in that house, realizing how big it is, how quiet it is...
how clean it is.
then he'll show up here with that hangdog look on his face, begging us to come back.
Ow! Mom! Celia hit me! - Then hit her back!
Gaby, don't tell her to do that.
I'd rather they settle it. Otherwise, I have to go in there.
that's what a mother does. Come on.
girls, if you stop fighting, then I'll let you have some fresh baked... Cookies?!
there were two dozen cookies on that plate.
Yeah, you can't leave food out.
they're like bears. You gotta tie it up in a tree.
uh, Gaby, while you're here, this might be a good time to teach them a little... Discipline.
discipline? What are you talking about? It's not like the plate's broken.
Oh, boy.
Yes, Bree Van de Kamp had finally met two pests she couldn't smash, poison, or shoot.
okay, I'm gonna need a garbage bag.
unless it was an antique. Then I need glue.
that's not to say she wasn't sorely tempted.
good deeds aren't always done for the purest of reasons.
we may be trying to impress.
we may be acting out of guilt.
we may be expecting something in return.
but occasionally, a good deed comes straight from the heart.
Wow. What's this?
your lunch. I got ham, ham and cheese, and that one's ham and gravel. I dropped it.
Susan, you don't have to keep doing this.
I want to. You're my new project, mister.
your project?
Yes. Paul Young, phase two
where we figure out what you are doing with your life, set some new goals.
now...
you tried destroying the neighborhood.
that didn't work out. What's next?
I don't know what I wanna do.
I've made such a mess of everything so far.
no, no. Phase two is about the future, not the past.
so from now on, we are only looking forward.
Oh, my god! Look behind you!
Hello, Susan. - Oh. Hey, Felicia.
Hey, "Felicia"? !
you knew she was in your house? I - I thought you were in prison.
Oh, I've been out for weeks.
what nice sandwiches. Are you cooking for paul now?
Yeah, for paul...
the guy that you cut off your fingers to frame.
it's all right, Susan.
Felicia and I have reached an understanding.
we can hardly keep squabbling, now that we're going to be neighbors again.
wait. You're living here?
right across the street.
I just came by to pick up some of Beth's things.
although I think you should keep that pretty oil painting she made for you.
hang on. You-you knew Beth?
you didn't tell her.
the topic doesn't exactly introduce itself.
Beth was Felicia's daughter.
what?
so you're Beth's...
and you knew...
and you're living...
I need to sit down.
we're gonna get a lot of this.
so FeliciaTillman was beth's mother?
Snip-snip Tillman? You sure? - Yep.
and people say the suburbs are boring?
great. Now we've got another nut job living on the street.
actually... Paul is not so bad.
Yeah, what were you doing over there?
bringing him food. Uh, checking up on him. Making sure he's okay.
Why?
cause I feel bad for him.
the poor guy has had two wives kill themselves.
and here I was concentrating all my pity on the dead people.
Susan, be careful.
Yeah, we understand Beth gave you a kidney, but you don't owe Paul anything.
I know I don't.
but that kidney gave me a second chance in life, and I'm sorry.
I feel that Paul deserves the same thing.
to us, our decorating firm, and our latest triumph, the Delaney bathroom.
today, subway tile and a low-flow toilet.
tomorrow, not walking in on Mr. Delaney on the low-flow toilet.
you bought this at a drugstore, didn't you?
come on. "Dan Perrignon. " It's cute.
a little tip - When picking champagne, wordplay usually isn't a selling point.
Hey. You're home early.
no, just forgot some files. Headed straight back to the office.
Ooh! Dan perrignon! What are you guys celebrating?
Renee and I finished a design job today.
Yeah. We actually cleared $293.
well, $290 after this champagne.
Hey, I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.
I just got my budget.
there's some money in there to redecorate my office.
how about you guys do it?
uh, well, we're a little busy.
it's 20 grand. - Busy thanking you.
you'd let us do that? You're amazing!
that would be huge for our company.
look, I know this new job's put a bit of a strain on us.
this might be a good way to sneak in a little extra time together.
so you think you can do something for 20 grand?
and whack an employee of your choosing.
Hey, roomie!
hello... Roomie.
those are beautiful.
they're for you from the girls.
they felt terrible about breaking your mirror.
Oh. You mean my serving dish.
Oh, you haven't been upstairs yet.
Gaby! - But look how beautiful.
I'm going to church.
weren't you just there?
I need to do some more praying. Apparently, it's not working.
if you're looking for the owner, that's me.
are you aware that you're blocking my driveway?
Yeah. Are you aware that you illegally entered my vehicle?
well, I needed to get your attention. - Doesn't make it legal.
Oh, don't try to make this my fault. Blocking my driveway is illegal.
Yes, but breaking into my car is criminal.
Really? Let's call 9-1-1. I'd love to get a policeman's opinion on that.
you just did.
Oh, my. You are a policeman.
detective Chuck Vance,Fairview P. D.
your neighbor Mrs. Tillman's a parolee. I was paying a routine call.
but now it appears that she's not the only dangerous woman on the street.
look, I-I don't know what laws I may have broken, but
unlawful trespass, tampering with a police vehicle, malicious mischief...
okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm just so frazzled today.
a friend of mine is staying with me, and her two girls are absolute monsters.
in fact, I don't suppose I could borrow your gun?
to shoot the children?
I was joking. - So was i.
I'm sorry I blocked your car.
I - I'm sorry that, um, I got into yours.
I'll tell that to the judge.
I'm sure you'll get off with community service.
wait.
what?
still joking.
I'm gonna get you! You come back here!
No! No! No!
Oh. Right. Girls! No running!
is that all you're gonna do?
of course not. Next time i'll trip one of them.
or perhaps you could try taking a firmer hand.
Oh, please. I've tried everything.
I even bought them a puppy just so I could threaten to kill it.
they asked if they could watch.
well, I can't take it anymore. Would you mind if I talked to them?
perhaps hearing it from somebody else would make the difference.
what are you saying, Bree?
you think you're a better mother than me?
well, not to cast aspersions on tripping and killing puppies, but there are other approaches.
okay, mother superior.
you think you can get those girls to behave? Be my guest.
Oh, and if the little one charges, move.
it's like someone dropping a sack of flour off the empire state building.
girls, I need to talk to you.
not now. We're playing death match.
we do not fight in this house with pillows made of hand-dyed silk.
now I am gonna count to three.
one... Two...
do you know what happens after three?
four?
put the pillows down.
now, I am sure you've heard the expression,"my house, my rules.
no.
well, there is an expression - "my house, my rules."
and as long as you are staying here with me, you will behave properly.
you will mind your manners, you will do your chores.
you will listen when spoken to.
and - Where are they going?
hmm? I wasn't paying attention. What were you telling 'em?
girls, get back here!
don't smirk.
the key to discipline is consistency. And I will not give up.
neither will they, Bree.
neither will they.
wow, if I knew Tom was working with so many handsome rich men,
I would have worn a lower top.
lower? I think you would call that a belt.
will you look at this? He's kept us waiting 45 minutes.
good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up.
if he keeps us waiting any longer,
I know two legs that won't be going up.
sorry about the wait.
I just got off the phone with london. Closed a deal worth $10 million. Phyllis?
okay, ladies, I have 15 minutes, and they are all yours.
that is all we need.
the overall look we're going for is very warm and inviting.
we're thinking soft wood, an overstuffed linen sofa, that sounds great, but I already know what I want.
ripped that out of a magazine.
this is Ddonald Trump's office.
isn't it cool?
I- I love that desk- Black marble and chrome.
a - and look at that samural sword and those dragon lamps.
I'm sorry. Are you planning to take over the world with your death ray?
I think this is impressive.
but... It's not you.
you'd need a telephone book to sit behind that desk.
Lynette, if this is what our client wants...
thank you, Renee.
you know, when Doug played for the Yankees, "the Donald" invited us on his yacht all the time.
I'll just call his assistant and find out where they got the desk.
the Ddonald.
you're wondering if you can pull off "theTom," aren't you?
no.
good, because the idea of you in an office like this
is totally workable.
why don't we get some pieces in here over the weekend?
and you can take a look on monday.
now that is the attitude I like-can-do.
I have a meeting. Great work, everyone.
see Phyllis on the way out. She'll validate your parking.
wow, that was easy.
I know a place that has these fabulous chrome and steel pieces.
we're not doing that. - Why not?
because that's not Tom.
he's definitely a soft wood kind of guy.
okay, lesson one - Tom is the client.
if he wants a big shot office, he gets it.
and lesson two - No man wants to be referred to as "soft wood.
Felicia. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to drop by without calling. Is this a bad time?
Yeah, it is. Uh, I'm in the middle of cooking dinner.
of course. I - I just...
I was missing beth so much, and...
then I remembered that part of her was still alive somewhere.
could you spare a few minutes for a woman who lost her only child?
sure. Come in.
smells good. - Oh, it's for Paul. Chicken pot pie.
right. You said you were cooking for him.
that's so thoughtful.
well, just trying to be a good friend.
I hope that we can be friends, too.
you do? You and me? Friends?
I know what you're thinking.
what I did to Paul was horrible, but thank god, he's forgiven me, and now I just want things back to normal.
I even got this glove so people wouldn't be put off by me.
what, you-you mean the finger thing?
Oh, people hardly notice it. But the glove is good.
what's wrong? - I... Get these migraines.
could I trouble you for some aspirin?
sure. Hang on.
this smells wonderful.
I wouldn't begin to know how to make a pot pie.
well, the crust is store-bought.
but don't tell Paul, okay?
don't you worry.
I know how to keep a secret.
toxin, death is both slow and agonizing.
what did I tell you, dear?
it's so much better than a bullet.
initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting.
these are followed by metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular dysfunction.
he'll think it's his heart.
as if he had one.
and finally, acute renal failure and...
death.
and you know the best part?
I couldn't get near Paul's food if it weren't for you...
or at least that last little piece of you that's still alive in Susan.
it just goes to show...
you may be gone...
but we're still one heck of a team.
Susan, how's he doing?
I don't get it. He just keeps getting worse and worse.
I think I'm gonna have to start bringing him breakfast, too.
you're a good friend.
daddy! I missed you so much!
Oh, I missed you, too.
why don't you guys go wash up for dinner? Go on.
so tomorrow after school, they come back to me, right?
right.
Carlos, how did we get here?
we're talking like a divorced couple.
what do you want me to say?
just tell me how long this is gonna go on.
how long are you gonna be friends with Bree?
Carlos- - 'cause that is how long it's gonna go on.
what are you doing? - Giving my plant a drink.
why do you hate mommy so much?
I don't hate mommy.
I just...
I'm mad at something Bree did.
what did she do?
well... It's kind of a grown-up thing, honey.
you guys say that about everything you don't wanna talk about.
you're right.
sit.
you know grandma died.
but you never heard the story of how it happened.
Hey, have you seen our bank statement?
I'm in the middle of a quiz.
well, I think you might like this a lot better than...
are you having enough orgasms?
Oh! I just had one.
we actually have money!
we paid all of our bills, and we have money left over.
well, the insurance is covering your surgery 100%, and add that to the money you won playing poker
by the way, don't do that again-and we're finally out of the hole.
in fact, we can afford to move back into our old house.
Oh, that would be great.
but we can't until Paul's ready to leave.
well, he might be ready a little sooner if his new best buddy asked him.
I'm not gonna do that to Paul.
think of what he's been through. He's a wreck.
well, maybe moving out of a house filled with memories of Beth would be good for him.
am I supposed to believe that you are suddenly interested in Paul's well-being?
look, I don't like the guy. I never will.
but as long as you're taking him under your wing, why can't we get something out of it?
so...
now do you understand why I'm so upset?
I know it's a complicated story. You have any questions?
no, daddy. - Okay.
I'm gonna go grab my wallet, and we are gonna go get pizza.
Celia, come here.
you know what daddy just told me?
Bree killed grandma.
Hello, girls.
did you have a nice time at your father's last night?
well, now that you're back at my house, i'd like to try once again to discuss my rules.
that be okay?
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.
Oh, hello, Gaby.
what is this? - Juanita's helping me make dinner.
good job.
now after you're done washing the brussels sprouts, you can help me set the table.
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.
brussels sprouts? You do know the girls are eating here tonight?
Yes. Don't they like brussels sprouts?
sure... As projectiles.
well, they'll eat them tonight, or no cupcakes.
you actually left those out in plain sight?
have you learned nothing? You could lose the sideboard.
Oh, they won't touch them, not till I tell them they can.
thank you for straightening up, Celia.
now would you please help your sister in the kitchen?
okay. What the hell did you do to them?
Oh, I simply sat them down and explained what I expected of them while they're staying here.
Oh, cut the crap, Van de Kamp. Did you give 'em drugs? Threaten 'em?
children don't respond to threats.
so you hit them.
if you stick to my system, by the time you take these girls back to carlos, they'll be perfectly behaved.
you're welcome.
Hey, sweetie. You can relax. She went upstairs.
no, I have to get this done.
do you want a cupcake?
Mrs. Van de Kamp says those are for after dinner.
well, Mrs. Van de Kamp isn't here.
I'm not saying I love this more than you and Celia, but if the three of you fell in a pool, and I could only save two, one of you would finally get her own room.
here. Sneak this upstairs. Eat it later.
no, thanks. I'll have an apple.
what did she do to you? ! how did she break you? !
okay, those go right in front of the desk. - Yes, ma'am.
and watch the... Yeah. Thank you.
uh, what's going on? I told the movers to be here at 11: 00.
Yeah. I made a teensy change.
and this is not the furniture I ordered.
again, teensy change.
Oh, my god. I can't believe you did this behind my back.
we're supposed to be a team.
I almost bought you a coffee this morning without you even asking.
but you didn't.
Yeah, and I felt bad about it... Till now.
I've got two dragon lamps in my car.
what the hell am I supposed to do with those?
I'm sorry, but trust me, i'm saving us time.
how? Tom said what he wants.
Tom said what he thinks he wants.
I know what he really wants.
and you have to admit, looks pretty good, doesn't it?
all comfy and cozy...
Yeah, Lynette, you did a great job ignoring what he asked for.
all that's missing is an antique jar for Tom to put his testicles in.
Juanita, what is it? - Get away! Get away!
you're just having a nightmare!
honest, everything is okay!
they won't come out. - Not even for you?
Nope. That's how scared you got them.
I swear, I didn't do anything.
I want in to check on them, and they got hysterical.
Carlos, it's me. Where are you?
the girls won't come out for anyone except their daddy.
it's about time!
okay, Carlos... Who the hell are you?
detective Vance, Fairview P. D.
we got a 9-1-1 call from 2 girls who say that their mom's crazy friend is trying to kill them.
what?
hello again.
I guess you found someone to loan you that gun.
okay. I spoke with the girls.
they're pretty sure that Mrs. Van de Kamp here was trying to murder them.
well, that's preposterous. Why would they say such a thing?
well, that's not all they said.
what's with the panicked phone calls?
it's nothing. The girls got all freaked out and called the police.
freaked out about what?
are you the father? - Yeah. Carlos Solis.
detective Vance.
Mr. Solis, did you tell your daughter that Mrs. Van de Kamp killed your mother?
did you tell her that, sir?
I think I know what this is.
me and the girls were talking about my mother's death, and I said being apart from their mom felt almost as bad, and I said that I blamed Bree for that.
they must have gotten confused.
Yeah, well, don't be mad at them.
it's hard on kids when their parents are apart.
it's actually kind of funny if you think about it.
I mean, not "funny" funny, but sad... Funny.
daddy! - Hey, girls...
so sorry to have dragged you out here in the middle of the night.
no problem. I hope everything... You know, works out.
let me walk you to your car.
let's go pack your stuff. I'm taking you home.
I'm glad you didn't kill someone.
I'd have felt pretty dumb for not arresting you when I had the chance.
uh, tell me something.
when someone calls 9-1-1, don't they usually just send a patrolman?
I was at dispatch when the call came through.
when I heard the address, I said,i'll take it.
I wanted to see you again.
Really? About what?
your neighbor, Mrs. Tillman.
here's my card.
if you see anything suspicious, I want you to call me.
okay.
or even if you don't.
what is it about you? I never have a clue what you're thinking.
I'm a detective. I find clues. I don't give them.
good night, citizen.
good night, detective.
they are almost done packing.
I can't believe you told them.
Juanita wanted to know why we were fighting. I told her the truth.
great. So now they think mommy walked out on daddy to live with the lady that killed grandma?
well, that is kind of what you did.
and I never said that Bree killed their grandma.
I said that she helped the person who did kill her get away with it.
Yes. She was protecting her child, which is exactly what we'd do if it was our kid in trouble.
families stick together.
then why are you living here?
why did you pick Bree over me?
Carlos, thank you for not saying anything in front of that policeman.
you think I did this for you?
well, I just assumed- - That was for Andrew.
he was a kid when all this happened. You weren't.
okay, lay off her, Carlos. She's apologized again and again.
well, I don't forgive her, and as long as you're taking her side, I don't forgive you, either.
we're ready, daddy. - Let's go home.
I'm sorry. I just keep waiting for this to blow over.
we have to face it, Gaby. This is never gonna blow over.
so what am I gonna do?
you're gonna go home to your husband.
I feel guilty enough about Carlos losing his mother.
I will not be responsible for him losing his wife.
that means you and me...
Yeah. I know.
I'll call you, okay?
please... Don't.
these look delicious. Nicely done.
well, I had help.
I just stirred the batter.
a very important job, so you get to try the first one.
no.
I don't want to spoil my dinner.
please?
I want to know that they taste good, and I'm allergic to nuts.
well, I... I guess that makes me the... Guinea pig.
best I've ever tasted.
but... Not good enough to finish?
they're terrible, aren't they?
you know what? I'm gonna toss these and start again.
no. You can't. I...
I just didn't want to break my diet...
but who can resist with these?
they're really good?
like nothing I have ever eaten.
I'm gonna get you some milk to wash that down.
no, I can't stay.
I, uh...
need to go buy a new handbag.
what's wrong with that one?
my keys...
you're not still mad at me, are you?
no. I'm good.
because I think we're gonna see a happy client walk out of his new office.
any second now.
you two...
I love it!
you do? - Love it!
you do!
well, you live with someone for 25 years, you might know a thing or two about a thing or two.
come on.
but... That's not...
where we told them to put the desk. You're right, Lynette.
what are you talking about? It's perfect right here.
I mean, look at this!
the only way it could be more intimidating is if flames shot out of it.
is there any way that we could...
Nah! Forget it.
Oh, I'm out of order? No, you're out of order. Get out!
so you really like this? - I love it.
you know, I was a little worried about how this was gonna work out, but you came through.
I mean, you captured it. It's amazing.
I'll tell you what's amazing
the rug that we haven't put down yet.
let's get to that showroom, Lynette, before some other hotshot takes it.
thanks again.
how could you do that?
do what? Make our customer happy?
Oh, he's kidding himself. That testosterone trap is not Tom.
maybe it's not the tom who's been pitching in with carpool the past few years, but the Tom who's running this company?
Yeah, it is, and you need to accept that.
you're not gonna accept that.
no.
you cannot be serious. - What are you talking about?
this.
this whole master of the universe playroom.
I - I thought you liked it.
I... Hate it.
then why did you do it this way?
I didn't! I had a whole other office in here!
then Renee came and changed it.
then good for Renee. At least one of you gets me.
this office is not who you are.
you're a great, down-to-earth guy, not some jerk that has to show people how powerful he is.
I am powerful...
and I do need to show it.
I am surrounded by gunslinger kids who'd steal this job in a heartbeat if they weren't a little scared of me.
I have a role to play, and I play it damn well, and I'm sorry if that threatens you.
it doesn't threaten me.
I just don't want to lose the guy I married.
Oh, You mean Tom the screwup?
the one who couldn't make a "go" of the pizza parlor?
the one you could always put your arm around at the end of the day, and say,"it's okay, honey. I'll get us through"?
don't make it sound like i'm not glad you're succeeding, 'cause I am.
you say that. You say that all the time, but I am waiting for a sign to see that you actually mean it.
and I thought this office was that sign.
I mean, I walked in here and I thought, "how great is this? She gets it.
she's happy. She's proud of me.
my mistake.
yeah? - Ed Nicks. You in?
Yes.
we- we can't end the conversation like this.
I have to take this call.
Hey, Eddie, how are ya?
what, are you kidding?
the chance to kick your ass at golf and take your money?
you don't have to ask me twice. Tuesday works.
Yeah, I'll let you hit from the ladies' tees.
no good, huh? - No, I'm just not very hungry these days.
are you okay? - A little dizzy.
sit. I'll clean up.
Oh, um, you took down Beth's painting?
Yeah. Some days it's nice to be reminded of her, but others... It's too many memories.
did you ever think living in this house might be one of the reasons you feel so bad?
maybe you could use a change of scenery?
you mean leave Fairview? - No, no, no, just this house.
I couldn't do that to you.
where you gonna find another tenant?
well, that's the great part.
Mike and I have been saving up, and now we're ready to move back in.
I'm an idiot.
what?
very impressive, Susan.
I actually thought you gave a damn about me.
what are you talking about? Of course I do.
bringing me food, checking in on me
it was a masterful performance.
must have been hard being patient, though
not show your hand too soon.
you don't give a crap about me.
it's this house you wanted.
no, Paul, that's not true.
I swear, Mike suggested it, and
Mike. Of course he's in on it.
I bet you had a hell of a time planning out the whole thing.
I knew nobody on this street cared about me, but for you to pretend you did just to get something out of me, that makes you the worst one of all!
Paul, please.
leave me alone!
and this time, I mean it.
people do good deeds for many reasons, but sometimes good deeds have bad consequences.
correcting a colleague's mistake could breed resentment.
opening one's home to a friend can damage that friendship.
trying to bring a spouse closer might push her further away.
that's why there's an old expression about helping people no good deed... Goes unpunished.
Susan tracked down the wife of the man she helped bury and tried to make things right.
I think you added an extra zero.
I wanna do something to help.
Lynette adjusted to life without tom.
lots of things like this are going to happen.
I have to be able to fix them.
Mike stopped Ben from making a mistake...
are you crazy? - Who is this guy?
sorry, pal, the deal's off. He's not taking your money.
then told him something he didn't know about Renee.
if she divorced a cricket player,I might recognize the name.
if she divorced a cricket player, she wouldn't have gotten $12 million.
and Bree's falling out with her friends led to some dangerous behavior.
can I buy you another drink?
you can buy me breakfast.
Bree van de kamp had always enjoyed a sterling reputation.
she was known for being kind to strangers and for greeting them with a warm welcome.
she made sure every guest felt comfortable and that no part of her home was off-limits.
she never had the heart to turn anyone away, because no matter how many guests she was hosting or how late she was entertaining, her generosity knew no bounds.
that was amazing.
it was nice.
and unexpected.
an hour ago, when I offered to buy you that glass of wine,I didn't know what a good investment it would be.
I don't waste any time...
when I see something I like.
decisive. And sexy. You may be the perfect woman.
get out.
what?
Ahem. I mean... It's time to go.
uh... It's-it's- It's 4: 00 in the morning.
Yeah, and my neighbor, Karen Mccluskey, starts her day at 5: 00 with a pot of coffee and a seat near her front window.
this is my only chance to get you out of here without her noticing.
who cares if she notices?
I do. I have a certain reputation on this street, and I don't want to become the subject of idle gossip. Now come on.
well, uh... Thanks again. This-this was terrific.
Ah, yes, here are your pants.
Thanks. Uh, really love to see you again.
Aw, that's sweet. Don't forget your jacket.
it's quite chilly out tonight.
I'm serious. Let's do this again.
how about Friday?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm busy.
thursday or wednesday?
can I at least get your phone number or your last name?
you seem like a good person, so I'm gonna be honest.
I have no interest in having a relationship with you.
why not?
because I am past the point in my life where I hope every date will flower into a meaningful relationship.
I have had husbands and boyfriends, and they've brought me nothing but heartbreak and pain.
so now all I want is a body in my bed at night, briefly.
so that's it? You're just gonna kick me out?
I am so sorry. Where are my manners?
Yes, Bree had always enjoyed a sterling reputation...
it was lovely having sex with you.
have a wonderful day.
and she saw no reason that should change.
in the life of every housewife, there comes a time for renovation...
when an eager child learns a new skill...
when a romantic evening becomes an unsightly mess...
or when a dinner party comes to an unexpected end.
but sometimes the only thing that needs to be removed is a memory.
so basically I want a whole new look
new furniture, new paint, you name it.
so we can get rid of everything, including the virgin mary and her kid?
Ah. No, no, no, no. My faith is very important to me.
name three apostles.
okay, fine. Move it to the guest room.
Hey, can you guys get this all done in two weeks?
probably. Why the rush?
that's when Carlos is done with rehab.
why would this room freak him out?
cause it was where celia was conceived, and frankly, that kid's been nothing but trouble.
uh, so, Lynette, is Tom back from paris?
not yet. Jane arranged for them... To pop over to london for a couple days.
that slut.
I'm sorry.
no, no, no. I mean, yeah, she's a slut, but I'm done feeling sorry for myself.
it's the kick in the pants I need to start dating again.
good for you. - Yeah, it's a big step.
I know, which is why I'm hoping you two might know someone you could set me up with.
uh, sure. We will think about it.
what was that?
what was what?
what was that look thing you just did?
Oh. There it is. You did it again.
it... Lynette, you're a wonderful person.
you are strong and sexy and smart, so... Fixing you up would be a bit of a challenge.
Why?
well... Because you're so unique. Such an original.
feisty and so certain of what you believe.
stop trying to make all those sound like compliments.
you're basically telling me i'm a bitch.
Oh, my god!
we're just saying it takes a certain kind of man to appreciate all you have to offer.
preferably one with a hide like a rhino and the fighting spirit of a baby harp seal.
okay, so we're done sugarcoating?
okay, look, I've met me.
I know I can come on a little strong, but I have to believe there's a guy out there somewhere that finds that appealing.
and... You two are gonna help me find that guy.
Ohh, fine. You win.
you always do, because you're so... Feisty.
Oh, my god. Aah! Oh, my god!
why are you still here?! Didn't the alarm go off?
Yeah, at 4: 00 in the morning. I shut it off.
no, that's when you leave. That's when all the men leave.
it's the rule.
okay, I'll get rid of whoever's knocking, and you can sneak out the back. Stay put.
Yeah, but I have- - shh! And don't move.
Karen, hi. Th-this is not a good time.
I am so angry, I could spit.
you've gotta help me, Bree.
with what?
the church bake sale.
everyone knows I make the lemon bars, but this year, Helen Simpson says she's making them, too, and I can't compete with her. She uses real lemons.
and what do you use?
I'm on a fixed income, okay?
Oh, god!
I mean... That must be so hard for you.
you're the head of the women's auxiliary. What should I do?
have you considered covering your lemons?
what?
I - I mean, you have lemon bars covered, so I'm gonna ask helen to make blueberry cheesecake.
okay, thanks.
now off you go.
I will. I'm just waiting for the naked guy behind me to finish getting dressed.
sorry. Couldn't wait. I've got a meeting.
have you seen my pants?
uh, you left them on the kitchen island.
don't give me the judgmental eyebrow.
he is a dear old friend of mine visiting from out of town.
see you later, Dan.
don. Hi. - Just go.
now can I give you the eyebrow?
fine. I met him last night at murray's.
my car broke down, and I went inside to wait for a tow truck.
and how about the guy I saw leaving the other morning?
my god. What time are you getting up?
caught that one on the way to the can.
what is going on, Bree?
you don't seem... Yourself lately.
I am absolutely fine.
okay. Whatever you say.
come on. What is your big surprise?
just a few more feet.
because if it's a 3-way, I gotta warn you, that's how I met my ex-husband.
uh, no, it's not that.
your fish. You're getting rid of it?
well, I know how much you hate it.
well, it meant so much to you...
for some stupid-ass reason you once explained to me.
Yeah. Bruce and I had some good times together.
but you and I have been having our share, too, and, uh, you know, if I have to pick one of you for the long haul, well...
the long haul? What are you trying to say?
I'm trying to say...
I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.
Ah. Sounded like there was more to it than that.
well, maybe there is, but you'll have to come to dinner to find out.
sounds intriguing.
we're not having swordfish, are we?
work. - I will be upstairs.
keep it short.
Hey, Carl. What's up?
no, no, don't send out the layoff notices.
we'll make payroll. I've got this covered.
no, not the bank.
I'm working on something else.
Claudia. - Where the hell is my husband?
Oh, hey, I'm sorry. The door slipped.
whoa. Okay. I just vacuumed, so if you could- - Ramon!
he isn't here. H - how did you find me?
your address was on the check, genius.
when I find you, I'm gonna wring your neck like a chicken!
you seem a little tense. Do - Do you want some herbal tea?
I want my husband!
what makes you think I know where he is?
you told my daughter he was never coming back.
you think it's that easy to steal my man, bitch?
wait. You think that I'm having an affair with ramon?
did he give these to you?
No! No! These are from my husband.
so you're cheating on your husband, too. You whore.
okay, look, I swear there is no possible way I could be having an affair with your husband. Trust me.
well, I think you're lying.
and you wanna see what I do to liars?
Hey, mom. Who's that?
please don't.
you're the home wrecker, not me.
but this isn't over.
I wanna get to the carpet store before it closes.
Oh, relax. It's a block away.
just need to confirm my appointment.
Hi. Making sure i'm still on with Frank 2: 00 thursday, and reminding you what happened the last time you screwed up my apartment.
she hasn't forgotten, Renee. None of us have.
hello. How are you? This is my friend Lynette.
Hi.
Wow. Who's the lucky guy doing you?
actually... Nobody. My husband and I are separated, and he just took his girlfriend to london and
he was talking about your hair.
Oh, of course you were.
I'm gonna meet you at the carpet store.
seriously, your hair is amazing.
any chance you'd ever let me style you?
uh, well, I've been going to Gustave on main for years.
I'd feel like I was cheating on him.
well, he doesn't have to know.
Yeah, but... Gustave is jealous and french, and I wouldn't want this ending up a pistols-at-dawn kind of thing.
loyalty. Just makes me want you more.
all right. Stop sniffing each other.
I need a bottle of conditioner.
coming right up.
well, he seems great. Why don't you set me up with him?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
why not? You saw he was flirting.
well, no, he's not right for you.
he just got divorced, and he's not looking for anything serious.
neither am i. It's perfect.
honey, you're about to go on your first date in 20 years.
I really don't wanna see you get hurt.
don't worry about me. I'm feisty, remember?
no.
don't make me use the baby voice.
Oh, not the baby voice.
Pwease.
I even hate when babies use the baby voice.
Pwease, wenee, help Wynette date the big, sexy hair dwesser.
Pwease. - Okay, okay. Okay.
Oh, thanks.
look, lynette may be loyal to her hairdresser, but she is single. So maybe the two of
I'd love to. How about tonight?
sounds great.
leave your number with Linda. I'll call you when I'm done.
great. Thank you.
to thank you, I will never again do the baby voice.
an, I appreciate it.
but I've still got the British one.
Pip, pip, cheerio, jolly ol' crumpets and tea, let's go. Ta-ta.
seen this man? your slut neighbor Susan Delfino has!
call Claudia at 555-0123.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
all of our friends do.
I'm not trusting you with celia. Remember your gerbil?
I was younger then.
I didn't know how to make a parachute yet.
okay, fine. Go. - Seriously?
Yeah. Walk, run. Whatever.
quick, before she changes her mind!
...and that's when I decided to fly to Oklahoma city and visit them.
unbelievable.
and I obviously didn't have $1, 000 cash, so I had to write a check.
with your address on it. Perfect.
and I was hoping that when she calmed down, she would realize we weren't having an affair.
apparently not.
I can't believe you would go to his family.
why would you do that?
I felt so guilty. Oh, it was eating me up.
the guilt again?
you feel guilty, so you assault a cop.
you feel guilty, so you paint the murder scene.
you feel guilty, so you go to his house?
when is this gonna end?
I just needed to make sure they were okay.
you know, they didn't do anything.
Susan, we were in the clear.
there was nobody who could connect him to us, and then you had to go tell his wife
no, no, no, his widow
he was never coming back.
I didn't tell Claudia. I told Marisa.
who the hell is marisa?
his 15-year-old stepdaughter.
wait. You talked to her?
do you think he was...
well, how do you know? Did she tell you?
she didn't have to.
I've only seen that look in someone's eyes once before.
yours.
do you think she's told her mother?
it didn't seem like she told anyone.
she needs to.
keeping a secret like that - It just... Tears you up.
I'm so sorry. I...
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one.
I do.
call claudia and tell her I wanna talk to her.
who do I say you are?
the woman's who gonna tell her the truth about her husband.
so... What's your feeling on carpaccio?
my feeling is I'd like to be locked inside a room made of carpaccio and eat my way out.
I am so happy to hear you say that.
my ex never let me order anything raw without giving me a lecture about the dangers of e. Coli.
Ugh. Sexy.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about her.
no, it's nice to hear about someone else's marriage problems for a change.
Oh, there was no problem, as long as we did everything exactly her way.
why do you have to work for somebody else?
why don't you get your own salon?
I can see how that would be frustrating.
although... I suppose someone could argue that she was just trying to help you.
help me? By making me feel like a failure all the time?
Yeah, that is pretty awful.
although...
maybe she meant it as a motivational technique.
so you agree with her?
I am just trying to understand what she might have been thinking.
I mean, you don't wanna be a stylist forever, right?
why not?
because... Who wants to be cutting hair when they're 60?
I mean, wouldn't you rather be checking in on your own salon from a beach in bali?
I like cutting hair.
then that is all that matters.
although...
my goodness, you certainly do work out.
I just love a man with a firm bicep.
you want to feel mine?
Reverend Sykes, what are you doing here?
the more pertinent question is, what are you doing here?
well... As you always say, there's no point in preaching to the choir.
you've gotta go out into the world and... Try to set the youth on a different path.
I think your path should take you elsewhere, perhaps to one of those ladies not so burdened down with clothing.
I can only imagine what you must think.
Oh, what I think is, as Karen Mccluskey put it, "you're back on the yahoo juice.
Oh, that's not mine.
some poor soul who was here before me must have left it.
I suppose I have allowed myself to slip back into some...
old habits.
well, that's why I'm here, to keep you from slipping any further, so gather up your things and let's go.
you must be so disappointed in me.
it's all right, Bree. I've been your pastor for years, and you're the most proper and appropriate woman I've ever come across.
this is obviously a temporary lapse and not who you truly are.
how can you say that?
excuse me?
how can you say who I truly am when I don't even know myself?
we can discuss this later. Now come on. Follow me.
but I have been following you for years, and I am still terribly lost.
I need to find out who I really am, and I think... Maybe the place I need to search is right here.
you do realize, if you continue to do this,
I can no longer let you lead the women's auxiliary.
you can't do that. The bake sale is this Sunday.
it would be a disaster without me.
I'm looking at a much bigger disaster right here.
now you're just being cruel.
that's not very ministerial of you.
I didn't only come here as your minister.
I also came as your friend.
but clearly, you have no interest in either right now.
so as you can see, within two years of opening the salon, you will have amortized all the start-up costs.
uh, we are not ready yet.
at that point, there's no reason you couldn't consistently turn a profit.
Oh, my god. Can we talk about something else?
I'm just trying to help. From what Renee tells me, people go to the salon because of you, and yet half that money- Your money is going to the owner.
seriously, this is making my stomach hurt.
could it be 'cause you're scared?
how could you say that? You know nothing about me.
I know. I know. It's just... We've spent an hour coming up with a perfectly reasonable 5-year plan, and it just makes your stomach hurt.
you know who else had a 5-year plan? Stalin.
okay. Oh, I'm sorry I said anything.
you're happy where you are. That's great.
there's nothing wrong with being average.
I am not average.
I'm sorry. Adequate, settled, comfortable.
whatever you wanna call it.
why don't we just order?
good idea.
Oh, the salmon looks good.
at a steakhouse?
you're right. I'm sure it's perfectly adequate.
settled, comfortable.
I don't know what Ben has up his sleeve, but it's gonna be a special night, so I really wanna look great.
speaking of which, how was your, uh, big date with Lynette?
Ah! Little tight.
sorry. The date was interesting.
I really owe you one.
what happened to your hair?
you happened to my hair.
Frank was the one guy in this podunk town who knew how to relax a black woman's hair.
now I look like an extra from Foxy Brown.
and thanks to you, our relationship is ruined.
wait. Frank did that?
I had no idea our date was that bad.
Oh, really?
did you or did you not give him a 5-year plan on a cocktail napkin?!
well, I may have made a few constructive suggestions, but only because I saw potential in the guy.
he could really be something.
he is something, and he likes who he is.
he doesn't need you telling him that it isn't good enough.
I am not going to apologize for trying to help the guy.
if he can't handle it, that's his problem.
Ah, I see.
so it's his fault you tried to control him?
just like it was tom's fault you tried to control him?
what did both of those guys have in common?
Oh, wait. Give me a second. Uh, I'll think of it.
I'd say put on a thinking cap, but I don't think there's one big enough.
well, at least I can cover up this mess.
that one is gonna take a hell of a lot more work.
come on. Take off the scarf.
how bad could it be?
you'd be surprised. I look like a bottle brush.
so what's the big occasion here?
first, a toast.
to the woman who came roaring into my life like a one-eyed wombat.
uh, it's a good thing.
a force who makes each day more exciting and surprising than the last.
now... I realize it's only been a few months, but, uh... I found myself falling for you, Renee.
and, uh... I know a keeper when I see one.
you like it?
I love it. - Yeah?
it's just... It's so fast.
well, if you need to take your time, I under
no, no, I don't need to take my time. Yes!
I'll marry you!
you have made me so happy.
Ohh. You don't know what you've done for me.
when my... Marriage ended, I felt so betrayed.
I decided I would never trust anyone again.
and then you came along.
I just feel so safe with you in a way that I've never felt before.
and I know that... In my heart this is right.
I can't do this.
what? - Just forget I said anything, okay?
forget you asked me to marry you?
what? Give me the ring.
you don't wanna marry me, Renee. I'm an awful person.
you're an amazing person.
now slide it on right there.
I can't. - why? What is going on?
Oh, god. You're gonna hate me for this.
I'm having some financial problems, and...
I guess I thought if we pooled our resources, that... Oh.
you wanted to marry me for my money?
I know. I'm sorry.
I do love you.
there's really no way for me to know that now, is there?
Hi, Claudia. I'm Gaby. Thanks for coming.
Yeah. This one said you wanted to talk to me? What about?
we should go inside.
you're not coming?
no. I'm-i'm gonna wait out here.
I think you two could probably use some privacy.
it's not usually this messy in here. We're redecorating.
excuse me, Mrs. Solis? Do you have a second?
what-what is that?
red wine. New year's eve party.
we were playing... Smash-the-bottle, which is a terrible game.
okay. Uh, we're taking lunch.
just wanted to give you a heads-up before we replace it.
great! Great. Don't need any reminders of that crazy night.
can I get you something to drink?
no. You can tell me what the hell I'm doing here.
Where's Ramon?
well... How to start this...
first of all, the man you're looking for his real name is alejandro perez.
what? No, it's not.
trust me.
I knew him before he ever met you.
how?
he was my stepfather.
Hi.
you okay?
I just want all this to be over.
me, too.
but it's never going to end.
she won't stop looking for him. She still loves him.
so you didn't tell her?
no way.
she would never believe me.
did you tell anyone?
no.
Marisa, I'm not gonna pretend to understand what you're dealing with.
but I have a friend who went through the same thing, and she said that as awful as it was, keeping the secret only makes it worse.
so if he left you and your mom, changed his name, started a whole new life, why'd he come back to see you?
I had visited my hometown. I said some things about him.
he heard, and he wanted me to stop.
what kind of things?
look, this isn't easy for me
what kind of things?
when I was 15, he molested me.
you expect me to believe that?
I was a virgin, and he hurt me.
liar. - Claudia.
I know this is hard to hear.
I don't know what you and your friend did.
I don't know what happened to my husband.
all I know is everything i'm being told is a lie.
it's not! He was a child molester.
shut up! You can make it sound as bad as you want.
you can tell all the disgusting lies you can think of.
I will never believe you.
then believe me.
what?
I was too scared to tell you.
I know how much you love him.
Oh, my god. Are you saying...
I kept thinking it would stop.
no. No. Not my baby.
no. no.
it is all my fault.
come in.
you were right.
all those years, I thought I pushed Tom because he needed me to.
well, he did.
no, he didn't, and that guy wasn't tom.
he was just a perfectly lovely guy, perfectly content with his life until hurricane Lynette hit him.
at least you recognize it.
they always say that's the first step.
mm, can I tell you the truth? There was a part of me that recognized it the whole time.
a little voice inside my head telling me, "you like this guy, and you're driving him nuts. Stop."
but I couldn't.
what if after all these years, I can't stop?
what if this is who I am?
remember in college you used to bite your nails?
you stopped that.
Yeah, by taking up smoking.
remember how you quit smoking?
yoga.
I've never seen you more relaxed than when you were taking those classes.
I don't know.
all I'm saying is you are the most determined person I know.
you can do anything you want.
I just wanna be different.
I'm sick of being this hypercritical nut job.
it'll get better.
trust me. And so will dating.
you will find somebody.
I hope you're right.
I mean, hell, if you found Ben...
I'm joking. I'm joking.
um... Ben and I... It's over.
Hey.
so that's where the tough guy lives, huh?
can we just do our business, please?
you pay every week, everyone's happy.
you miss one, it'll cost you.
you miss two...
you don't wanna miss two.
don't worry.
I just have to get past this rough patch, and then the money will be rolling in.
take your time. Besides, if you're not good for it, I understand that pretty girlfriend of yours is loaded.
she's got nothing to do with this.
you keep her out of it. You understand me?
there's a lot of tough guys on this street.
Hi! Come in.
we're not staying. Just... Came to say good-bye.
and thank you.
you sure you don't wanna stay? I have a guest room.
no, we need to be getting back.
this one's missed enough school already.
give me a second, Mija.
I still don't know how this could have happened under my nose.
you must think I'm the worst mother in the world.
no.
at least you believe her. My mother never did.
but I'm the one who brought that man into her life.
you didn't know. Nobody ever knew what a monster he was? I know now, thanks to you.
you said that stain was red wine?
Uh-huh.
you should probably get rid of that.
Bree, what are you doing here?
Oh, I've been running this bake sale for eight years.
why wouldn't I be here?
I told everyone you weren't feeling well and had decided to sit this one out.
well, I'm feeling better now.
besides every bake sale needs... A tart.
while I appreciate a good culinary double entendre as much as the next man,
I really don't think you should be here in your condition.
I'm fine. Look how beautifully my dessert came out.
shortcrust pastry, fresh strawberries.
you've obviously been drinking.
I don't want you to embarrass yourself.
well, I appreciate your concern, reverend, but I can take care of myself.
you're very welcome.
tell are your friends to come to my table.
all right, who's next?
Oh, my god. Bree.
wh-what are you doing here?
this is my church.
are you a member? I've never seen you here before.
I, uh, just joined. Yes. Nice talking to you.
wait, wait.
can't I tempt you with a slice of my famous strawberry... Tart?
I, uh, I should probably get going。
what a funny coincidence this was.
will I see you at Murray's later?
or... We could just skip the murray's part, and you could come... Straight to my house.
Greg, who is this woman?
uh, this is Bree. She, um, she goes to this church.
doesn't sound like you met her in church.
excuse me. What business is it of yours how we met?
I'm his wife.
Oh. I guess it is your business.
unbelievable.
you're always going on about working late and sleeping in the office, and meanwhile, you're hanging out at dive bars picking up trash.
I don't like your accusation.
Oh, yeah? Guess what I don't like?
you screwing my husband!
Bree, this is what I was worried about.
you need to leave.
you're kicking me out? She's the one making a scene, and a dry batch of cupcakes, by the looks of it.
Thanks, but I'm not looking for baking tips from the town whore.
don't listen to her, Bree. She doesn't know who you are.
actually, karen... I think she does.
now I know you're all anxious to dig in to the delicious gossip I've provided for you.
and I could really use a drink.
Yes, in the life of every housewife, there comes a time for renovation.
she may be doing away with an unpleasant memory...
breaking up a once happy relationship...
or making the necessary changes to prepare for a new one.
but no matter how much a housewife may embrace the way her life is changing, the people in her neighborhood a different view.
what's matter?
maybe we should go inside.
Oh, maybe we shouldn't.
Susan discovered that Porter was the father of julie's baby.
no, the father will be an adoptive parent who has gone through extensive interviews and a background check.
both of you, stop.
I wanna keep it.
then Lynette found out...
no, no, no!
he can't be having a baby!
Gaby took in a houseguest...
Karen kicked me out.
and karen got bad news.
the cancer's back.
Ben's money problems took a toll...
let's get you to the hospital.
and Renee stepped in.
normally, I'd never take a check, but I know where you live.
Orson returned...
how would you feel about a change of scenery-maine?
with a plan.
you won't believe where it's going to end up.
when it came to raising her children, Lynette Scavo was used to doing things without help.
her husband would often travel on business...
or rush out to important meetings...
or sneak out for a game of golf.
but just because Lynette was used to doing everything herself...
you done yet?
didn't mean she liked it.
Yes, I'm done.
thank you for your help.
okay, uh, I wanna thank you both for joining me.
I know you're worried about my decision to be a single father.
no, not worried.
more like panicked and terrified.
well, I'm here to let you know that as of today, I've got everything under control.
I got a job.
just working in a restaurant, but it's decent pay, and there's health insurance for me and the baby.
well, that is great news.
l - Lynette, don't you want to tell our son that's great news?
I'm waiting for the "but."
there doesn't have to be a but.
it's Porter. There's always a but.
but...
they don't exactly provide child care.
at a restaurant? That's so weird.
they usually have a whole play area between the knife block and the deep fryer.
so I'll need a little help with the baby.
how much help?
I don't know.
eight hours a day...
every day until...
she turns 18?
no. She could be super smart and end up going to college at 15.
Aw, sweetie, she's not gonna be super smart.
porter, I'm sorry.
I am not gonna keep telling you what a bad idea raising this baby is.
you're a grownup and you've made your own decision, and I'm even starting to make my peace with it.
But?
but I can't raise her for you.
We-we-we can barely take care of this one.
wait.
wait. Where-where did she go?
I thought you were watching her.
well, it's your house.
I'm sorry.
you're gonna have to make other arrangements.
I found her!
I don't know what I was thinking, expecting you to care about my baby.
I mean, you're only the grandmother.
I am happy to be her grandmother.
I will fill her room with stuffed animals.
I will feed her ice cream behind your back.
I will spoil her like nobody's business.
but when it comes to the heavy lifting, I am done.
or will be very shortly.
okay.
I see where you're coming from.
I guess I'll have to find some stranger to watch over little baby Lynette.
you were gonna name your daughter after me?
that is incredibly touching.
it changes nothing.
Yes, Lynette Scavo had raised her children without much help...
here you go.
practice.
and she was determined that Porter do the same.
Orson Hodge had a plan.
he was determined to reclaim the heart of a woman...
whose loss he had never gotten over.
he loved her so deeply that he was willing to be patient...
okay, open.
what is this?
it's a little book of inspiration I put together for you.
I wanted to show you some pictures of my cottage in Maine.
it's right on the coast.
look. See? There's the lighthouse.
these photographs are breathtaking.
it's even more beautiful in person, when you hear the foghorn and you...
you breathe in the sea air.
Oh, I feel it already.
Oh, Orson, I can't tell you how happy this makes me.
this is exactly what I need right now. - Absolutely.
you deserve a break after all that ghastly business you've been through lately.
Yeah, the murder, the investigation, all those chilling letters you received.
letters?
Yes, the letter you received after the murder and the one after Chuck Vance was killed.
I never told you about the second letter.
that's right. I heard about it from Lynette.
you talked to Lynette about the letters?
Yes. The other day, when she came over with the girls.
personally, I thought it was very indiscreet of her, but, well...
yet another example of how those women can't be trusted.
Oh, let me show you this one. It's my favorite.
that patch of dirt is your favorite?
Fresh-tilled soil in a raised bed, overlooking the ocean.
the perfect place for you to plant a garden.
Oh, Orson, I can't remember when I've been this excited.
you have truly thought of everything, haven't you?
let's hope so, darling.
and our Doppler radar will be tracking those scattered showers as they move from eastern Pennsylvania right into the western Pennsylvania area.
now when we come - Hey!
I could hear that at the store!
Oh, no. One of your girls having a birthday? I can only imagine them on cake.
no. This is for Carlos. He's coming home Thursday.
you got a bottle of champagne for a guy getting out of rehab?
what, they were all out of opium?
no, this is for me.
this whole rehab thing has been very stressful.
so this is his big homecoming, watching you get loaded?
and a balloon.
that guy puts up with a lot from you.
what's that supposed to mean?
why don't you think of someone other that yourself just once in your life?
you're right. It's horrible here.
so why don't you just walk out the front door?
believe me, I would if I had anyplace else to go.
well, as the balloon tells us, Carlos is coming home soon.
so what's your plan?
I thought we'd watch the basketball game, maybe do a little grilling.
Carlos always liked my tri-tip.
well, you know who else likes your tri-tip?
Karen. - Yeah, she does.
I'm talking about steak, Roy!
isn't it time you two patched things up?
send her some flowers. Make nice. - I tried all that.
if she wants me back, she knows where to find me.
now after the break, we'll answer all your burning questions about barometric pressure, so make sure you stick around.
how'd it go with Julie?
made it to the train with time to spare.
I think she was eager to get back to school.
I was sort of hoping she'd change her mind and come back with you.
guess what, mom? I decided to stay.
well, give her some time. You never know. - I think I know.
porter? Is everything okay?
no. Everything pretty much sucks.
I thought I had a job, but my mom says it's not good enough.
so I wrote up a resume.
well, this looks great.
I mean, any boss would be lucky to have you.
I mean, you're young, energetic.
you had a paper route and you're "proficient in martial arts," though not proficient in spelling it.
what was the job that your mom said wasn't good enough?
waiting tables at the Carlyle.
I mean, I know it sounds kinda lame, but it's a stepping-stone.
I'd take classes, learn about the business...
try to work my way into management.
or even own my own restaurant, just like my parents used to.
wow, Porter, that sounds like an actual plan, and a good one.
Yeah. There's just one problem. It doesn't have day care.
you should take that job. - What will I do with the baby?
well, lucky for you, you happen to be looking at Fairview's finest day care provider.
porter, me. I'm the day care.
when the baby is born, you just drop her off with me whenever you need.
I will spoil the heck out of her.
you don't mind being stuck with a baby all day?
it's a baby. Who could be stuck?
my mother, for one. - Well, for me, it's a dream come true.
honestly, you would be doing me a favor.
thank you, Mrs. Delfino.
Oh, you know what?
you're gonna be raising my daughter's child.
I think it's about time you started calling me "Susan."
or better yet,"grandma." - No. Susan.
son of a bitch!
what are you doing?
I... Just noticed you had some flowers delivered, and I was snooping to see who they were from.
you wanna know who? - No.
they're from Roy! He wants you back!
I just saw you cutting those roses from Bree's garden.
no, you didn't. You're old. You can't see anything. - You've got clippers in your pocket.
you have clippers in your pocket! - Your finger's bleeding.
your finger's bl - All right, can I just come in?
come on.
look, Roy may be too proud to send flowers himself, but he misses you.
whatever.
why are you being like this?
just get over your silly fight and take him back.
he's crazy about you. - Really?
then how come you're over here and not him?
cause I'm kinda to blame for this?
I fed the flames of your little spat because, let's face it, I'm selfish.
my girls were out of control, and Roy's a genius at scaring the crap out of kids.
but now Carlos is coming back, so I'm all about you two being lovebirds again.
save your breath, Gaby.
it's not gonna happen.
what's going on with you two?
you know, none of your damn business!
now take your stolen flowers and your clippers and...
Karen, what's the matter?
nothing.
I'm on new medication.
sometimes I get a little light-headed.
you don't look so good.
I'm-I'm gonna go and lie...
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Okay.
Hi. I need an ambulance right away.
4358 Wisteria lane.
Hey, guys.
whatcha doing?
I'm helping Mrs. Delfino paint the nursery.
nursery? - It's a room where babies live.
Yes, thank you. Why would Susan need a nursery? - You didn't tell her?
I volunteered to look after the baby so Porter could start that new restaurant job.
Yeah. He said you didn't want to be stuck taking care of her all the time, and I'm thrilled to do it.
that's... Really nice of you.
and of course it goes without saying that you are welcome to come over and play anytime with my granddaughter.
our granddaughter. Sorry.
Oh, mom. I-I wanted to ask, can we take the old bassinet?
my bassinet? The one all five of you kids slept in? - Yeah.
that's why I thought it was cool.
now my kid gets to sleep in it.
doesn't it make you want to cry?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Renee. What are you doing here?
learning ten new ways to cook kale.
and letting you know your financial troubles are over.
what do you mean?
I met with your loan shark- A sentence I never thought I'd be saying.
and I settled your account.
all you have to worry about now is getting better.
I told you I didn't want you to do that.
I think the words you're looking for are thank you.
I'm serious.
I didn't want you to get involved in this.
look, if you and I are gonna keep hanging out, there's something you need to know about me.
I do what I want.
thank you. But I want to be perfectly clear.
I- I will be paying you that money back. - Oh, I know.
and it's probably gonna take a while.
good thing I'm not going anywhere.
it could be years.
just lie there and look pretty.
come in! And don't be an ax murderer!
Hey!
Hey! - Hey, kids, dad's home!
what's going on, Tom? Kinda busy right now. - Actually, that is why I am here.
Parker, Penny, you guys around?
Hey, guys. - Hey, dad.
go pack your bags.
I've tried that, Tom. They come back.
I figured I'd take 'em off your hands for the rest of spring break.
Oh, we're going to your place?
Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Cool!
and you already got plenty of stuff there already, so pack light!
this is actually happening?
you're taking the kids for an entire week?
well, um, after our talk with Porter, I got to thinking that you never really get any time to yourself.
and when I was out of town, you had the kids for weeks. So...
I owe ya.
if we weren't separated, the things I'd do to you...
anyway, uh, thank you.
it'll be much easier getting things done around here when it's just me and the baby.
no, no, no. I'm taking Paige, too.
who's gonna watch her while you're at work?
she hasn't taken care of a baby in forever.
She's-she's really looking forward to it.
okay, that's really generous.
and here comes the herd.
later, mom. - Wait, wait. Give me a hug.
Bye. Have a good time. I love you.
have a good time.
I love you, mom. - I love you, too.
so what are you gonna do with all this time to yourself?
Oh, that is a problem I look forward to solving.
Bye, Paige. Thank you!
I spoke with your doctor, and I know. - What?
doctors aren't allowed to talk about patients' conditions.
well, they can if you're family, mom.
why didn't you tell anyone the cancer's back?
because this time, I ain't gonna beat it.
Oh, you don't know that.
Yeah, I do.
so this why you've been pushing Roy away.
look at my smart daughter, piecing it together.
he doesn't know about any of it? - No, and he's not going to.
but this is a scary thing. Maybe you should let him help you.
why, so he can be miserable, too? - Karen!
Roy went through this when his first wife died.
I'm not putting him through it again.
Gaby, I'm begging you.
don't do this to him. Just don't tell him.
Oh! You know what we need here? Over the crib, a mobile with twinkly little butterflies.
those were julie's favorite. - Twinkly butterflies.
and, you know, we could put her name on the wall in big, bright letters.
do you have a name yet? - I was actually thinking about "Lynette."
for a baby? Let me think about that.
you know what else we could do? A mural.
like, Winnie the Pooh, and his head is stuck in the honey pot.
I brought you guys some coffee, but it sounds like one of you doesn't need it.
Oh, I'm not caffeinated. I'm just high on baby.
is there any sugar? - Uh, in the kitchen.
that baby is gonna feel right at home here. - Oh, well, that's why I'm doing this.
are you gonna keep Julie's bed?
well, she was here first.
and besides, I mean, if she- If she does come back, she'll need a place to stay.
right. So when Julie comes to visit, she'll be sleeping 4 feet away from the baby she doesn't want.
think I should move Julie's bed? - I think you should do whatever makes you happy.
hon, did you find the sugar? - That's what I was looking for.
lets just hope the baby takes after Julie.
this is the kind of thing that chaps my ass.
if Marmaduke ate my pillow, I'd shoot him right in the head.
Hey, Roy? - No, Gaby. I wouldn't actually shoot a dog. It was a joke.
I just realized the other day, I don't think I've ever heard you talk about your first wife.
Miriam? - I didn't even know her name.
Miriam.
how long were you guys married? - 39 years. She died 2 weeks before our 40th anniversary.
Oh, my God. Cancer, right?
brain. Son of a bitch, that kind. A real son of a bitch.
that must have been the worst thing you ever went through. - You'd think.
wait, are you saying it wasn't? - Sounds weird.
it-it's hard to understand.
I wanna understand. - Okay.
when you love somebody, love them a long time, you get lazy.
you figure they know it, so you stop saying it so much, stop showing it.
but when you know you're gonna lose 'em, that they won't be there to hear you say it...
Oh, boy, you make damn sure they know it every second of every day.
I'm so sorry I brought it up. - Nah. These? I earned 'em.
I was there for Miriam.
I told her everything I needed to tell her, held her hand when she was scared.
Nah, these don't bother me at all.
Oh, Roy. I made a promise to someone, but I'm gonna have to break it.
Renee. It's so good to see you again.
a loan shark and a Jehovah Witness? not a combo you see often.
what? - I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I'm a terrible bookkeeper.
that check you wrote me to pay off your boyfriend's loan? I had the amount wrong.
Oh, so you're here to give me a refund? - Not exactly. I really like this house.
tell me, what does fire insurance cost for a place like this?
okay, why don't you pick up your violin case and drive your big Cadillac back to the "Godfather" movie you crawled out of?
you are not gonna intimidate me. - You sure about that?
it's how I make my living, and business is good.
Ah, I get it.
you see the sweet suburban neighborhood and think, "I can push those people around."
well, let me tell you something. I do not come from a place like this.
you got all you're gonna get. We're done.
I'm the one that decides when we're done.
see ya around.
is that everything? - I think so.
have you taken one last look down the lane, fixed an image in your mind?
Why? We'll only be gone for a month. - Will we?
something tells me that once you taste one of those delicious Maine lobster rolls, you'll never want to come back.
aren't we getting ahead of ourselves? - Promise me you'll keep an open mind.
fine. Mind open.
this is gonna sound silly, but you know what I'm most excited about? - What?
we finally get to wear those hats I bought for that Alaskan cruise we never got to take.
Jiminy Christmas. I left mine at home.
Orson! - We'll buy another one.
but it won't be the same thing. I had them monogrammed, and I always imagined us wearing them on some wonderful adventure together.
Oh, that's all right. We'll just stop and get it from your apartment. - My apartment?
we don't have time for that. - Don't be silly. It's on the way.
and besides, most people don't get to the airport four hours before their flight. - No! No, we can't.
do you know how long it takes to go through security in a wheelchair?
certainly not four hours. - Bree, please.
Orson, is something wrong? - No. No.
you're trembling. - It's-it's-it's nothing.
it's just, you know me and punctuality.
well, this is hardly the way to start that relaxing vacation you've been promising me.
you're right. I'm sorry, dear.
apology accepted. Now let's make that the last time we quibble on this trip.
now we're off to your apartment.
Hi. - Lynette, Porter's not here.
no, I know. I just felt bad you were doing all the work on the nursery, so I freed up some time in my schedule to help.
you know, painting, moving furniture, whatever you need. - Uh, actually, we already finished.
can I see it? - Of course. Uh, sure. Follow me.
I know pink is a little traditional, but then I found this black and white bedding for the bassinet I just love.
makes it feel like a little French girl's room, don't you think?
who's Sophie?
uh, that's what Porter decided to name the baby.
porter decided to name the baby after your mother?
he did ask me for some suggestions.
interesting. He told me he was naming her Lynette. - I know, but...
baby Lynette? - What's wrong with that?
Oh, nothing. It's just, "Lynette" is so...you.
Really? - Well, yeah.
and you have set the bar so high on that name.
do you want to burden a tiny little baby with trying to live up to that?
and nobody thought I'd be interested in hearing about this name change?
Oh, my gosh. Are you upset about this?
I thought you were into being the hands-off grandma.
well, I'm trying to get my son to stand on his own two feet, and I guess I didn't count on you being the pushy grandma.
I guess your definition of "pushy" is being helpful and wanting to get involved.
Oh, I wanna be involved. It's my granddaughter, too. - Well, I don't see you setting up a nursery in your house.
Oh, well, maybe I will. There's just one thing I need.
Lynette, give that back! - No.
porter wants it here. He says it pulls the whole room together.
Oh, yeah, 'cause Porter has such a keen eye for design.
what is going on? What's wrong? - What's wrong?
you're calling Lynette "Sophie," you're making my son a waiter, and you're trying to turn my granddaughter into a French girl. That's what's wrong!
okay, that doesn't make any sense, and it's incredibly petty.
well, not as petty as trying to steal somebody's grandchild!
my first visit to your apartment.
I must admit, I'm a bit ashamed I never came by before.
Yes, well, truth be told, I'm a bit ashamed of how modest it is.
so if it's all the same, I'd prefer it if you wait out here.
I'll just be a minute. - Absolutely not. I'm sure it's perfectly charming.
actually, it's also a mess. There, I said it.
Oh, what you must think of me. - Orson, I know you.
a "mess" means you haven't fluffed the sofa pillows today.
now come on. Let's get you that hat.
Oh, hell's bells. - What?
I seem to have forgotten my key. - Oh, dear.
sometimes I think I'd forget my head if it weren't attached to my body.
of course, then I wouldn't need to get my hat.
the manager has a master key. Would you mind running down to the office to get it?
of course not. I'll be back in a sec.
Orson? I've looked everywhere and I can't find the manager.
Oh, not to worry. I'm such a muddlehead.
I forgot that I keep a spare key in the pouch.
it's one of the good things about being in a wheelchair. It's like having a mobile purse.
after you.
what a lovely place.
and, of course, your pillows are perfectly plumped. - It served its purpose.
and now...On to new adventures.
you look very dashing. - Thank you.
uh, let's not dillydally. We-we still have a plane to catch.
Oh, we-and we must stop by a newsstand in the terminal. The novel I'm reading is simply dreadful.
Oh, and I know how much you despise airplane food. Perhaps we can pick up a little bite for you as well.
it was you? you did it?
you wrote the letters?
Oh, my god. You killed Chuck.
Yes.
for you. - What?
he was going to arrest you.
I had to do something to stop him. Everything I did, Bree, was to protect you.
protect me? How was writing the letters supposed to protect me?
they tormented me, almost drove me to suicide. - Well, I'm sorry it went that far.
but I knew I had no chance of winning you back unless I could isolate you from those awful friends of yours.
so I wrote the letters knowing those women would turn against you, and they did.
but why would you want to turn them against me?
because as long as they were in your life, I knew I would always be a distant second, and that wasn't going to be good enough for me! Not this time!
I had to have you all to myself. That's how much I love you.
you're insane. - Bree.
Bree, we both know what it means to commit a crime for the greater good.
do not compare yourself to me!
I was protecting people I love. You were only pursuing your own selfish desires.
no, I did it for both of us!
you took advantage of me at the darkest moment of my life.
you're a sick, pathetic man, and I know that someday you will pay for your sins.
Bree, don't go! You're everything to me!
well, you are nothing to me. And I never wanna see you again.
Hey. You mind if I come in?
sure, but I've already been screamed at by one Scavo today, so can we keep it civil?
if this is about Susan, you can save your breath.
Oh, come on, Lynette. I know how much you guys care about each other.
Hey, you wanna have sex with me? That'd really piss her off.
uh, I'm going to pass on that, but thanks. - Okay.
I don't understand why she's so mad at me. She said she wanted nothing to do with Porter's baby.
can I tell you a little secret? That was her first reaction to all five of our kids.
Oh, I don't believe that. I mean, she is a great mom.
none of this makes any sense. - Now we're gettin' somewhere.
I just never thought my life would end up like this. It's like I'm turning into white trash.
Lynette, I come from white trash. You are nowhere near that. - Really?
I'm separated, my kid is having a baby out of wedlock, I'm getting into public fights...
I'm two weeks away from having a washing machine on the porch.
meanwhile, Susan's getting everything she wants.
Yeah, I don't think Susan's life is going the way she'd hoped, either.
all I know is, she's the one over there painting a nursery for our grandchild.
with your son, not her daughter.
that's the thing about Lynette. She always complains that she has to do everything herself.
but God help you if you try to do anything for her.
I have a bruised tailbone to prove it. - I made the same mistake as you.
and I was married to her. I should know.
what did you do? - I took the kids off her hands for a week.
