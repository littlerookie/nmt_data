Hey, Stitch.
I don't answer to that handle no more.
yeah? So what do you want me to call you?
boss" is fine.
sir" is better.
Oh.
well, sir...
if I was you,
I'd stay the hell away from my wife.
if I was you,
I would tell your wife to stay the hell away from me.
now get.
clear the way! Kevin, lock that down! What happened?
I just turned around and one of the cars fell.
out of my way. Let me through please.
clear the way!
now you two, hold still!
just hold still! - That's the one!
that's the one I saw drinking!
all right, get those guys out of here!

Jones, stop standing around with your face hanging out!
we've got track to make!
Dutch! Slim!
break this bitch down.
what the hell?
I'm sorry about your friend.
it was the best I could do.
I'll help you.
but it's gonna have to be a different deal than with him.
no more secrets.
no more lies.
I don't lie.
Ruthie seen Scudder running out of here.
he got grabbed by that bald-headed fella.
Aw, hell.
what?
he's taking him back to the preacher.
damn it!
he's got a car and a full day's lead on us.
ain't no catching up to that.
we ain't even started, we already lost.
well, I got gasoline and rubber
and a four-bit wager says we haven't.
fifty cents.
iron money.
Hey, bone top, kill those lights!
we drive by moonlight till we cross the state line.
kill the lights.
kill your lights.
don't spare the horses! - Okay.
is everybody ready?
if they ain't, they can stay behind and wait for the mob.
where to?
west.
abraham Lincoln Highway, as far and as fast as you can put us there.
my ary of sous ready to travel to distant lands.
was she crying?
no. She was awake. They just need to be cuddled.
you spoil them.
of course l do.
a spider bit me.
shut up.
wanna wash windshields today? - Thieves! Little bastards!
beat it!
One-eye! One-eye! Go fuck yourself!
little thugs.
lt's our turn to sing today. - Great.
l remember it. But that was the year l had to leave.
you never got to sing it?
just in rehearsals. Mami was really sick.
lt's better if you wait.
you need to wear your shoes.
they hurt me. They're too small.
well, put them on before you go inside the school.
he's so bad. He hangs out with that gang that tortures the dogs.
liar!
shut up!
take care of the stove. And do what you can with him.
which one do you work in?
the Posada Santa Marta.
do the mothers leave you tips?
not many. But if you need diapers, it's heaven.
l've only got ten cents.
tough shit.
can you rent it?
how much?
ten cents.
you don't bring it back, l break your arm.
lf you can catch me!
six bags of trash l emptied.
people are so filthy.
ls she here yet?
as always.
any problems? - 214 as usual.
not enough pressure in the shower and the AC is too loud.
witch.
they want to be mothers and they can't even take of themselves.
good morning, ma'am. Excuse me.
your clerks said l should ask you if there's any work.
right now there's nothing.
l'm available right away...
really, there's nothing.
l can do whatever.
l can cook, clean. l can...
lf l hire you, l have to pay the others less.
lt's already tough for them to make a living.
l understand. Thanks.
ls there somewhere else l could...?
l'm sorry.
a crazy woman.
breast strokes right through the ice cubes.
must be the Aryan blood.
her people are mostly Swedish-- Lutherans.
and will the ladies be taking a liquid this morning?
and why not?
Afruit plate, porfavor. and a joo-go of orange.
lt's jugo. not joo-go. Give me a break here.
you're so good at it. - l studied it.
Yeah, but you've got an ear.
ljust sound like some old cracker.
lt will arrive suddenly.
the children are so adorable.
youjust wanna bake them some cookies and give them a bath.
morning, ladies. - Hi.
our water sprite in her element? - Building her calorie debt.
don't l wish l had one of those.
ls Eileen coming down?
we knocked, but she said she's not hungry.
gal's missing a lot of meals.
she's on a budget--Eileen. - l'll say.
woman gives two cerntavos to some little beggar boy, it goes right in that notebook of hers.
she doesn't bitch and moan about the prices like some people.
bargaining is a respected part of the culture here.
lf you don't complain, they take advantage of you.
besides, she's a professor.
she's in clerical. - At a university.
which probably pays worse than publishing.
l think her husband is between jobs.
unemployed.
actually, no. l think he's freelancing.
he's looking for a job and hasn't found one yet--unemployed.
so they lied on the application.
or he got laid off after it went through.
do you suppose the fellow back there could do me up a pair of eggs, over easy, so they're not runny, but they're not scabby on the outside?
l will order it done.
and bacon--crispy, so you break it. You don't tear it.
we will attempt to comply with this, Sennora.
and fruit plate?
you take the even ones and l'll take the odd ones.
excuse me. Socorro?
right? Ascension?
l knew it was some religious holiday.
can l get another one?
they're Catholic. - So?
that might make a difference down here with the agency people.
lf somebody stipulates that the kid has to be raised Catholic, yeah.
they can do that? - Why not?
seems like under the circumstances beggars can't be choosers.
l think that might be the motto at the orphanage...
maybe faith is different.
you must've told them you'll raise yours up in your sect.
religion.
and that child's parents have no say in the matter.
she's been skipping dinner a lot, too--Eileen.
room service.
no, l don't ever see any trays in front of her door in the morning.
maybe we oughta find a way to treat, then, and just not make a big deal about it.
easy, easy now. You're so lucky.
you'll have a car with its own little house.
you'll go to a pretty school with all the Yankee kids.
you'll have perfect teeth and a huge bedroom.
let him breathe.
the expert.
my grandmother did this job, and my mother, too.
they did it nature's way.
natu osway?
breast-feeding.
wet nurses?
right here.
have you ever tried it?
wash your windshield?
wash your windshield?
she's only 30. How can she be sick of men already?
that's what she said. - She's a dyke.
she is not.
she might as well be one with the attitude she's got.
have you seen her tattoo? - How can you see anything?
she won't wear a bathing suit like a normal person.
lt's an ankh.
what's an ankh? - Her tattoo.
right, but what is that?
and where is it? - lt's on her heinie.
how did you see it there?
what's an ankh?
she pulled her pants down for me.
l told you she's a dyke.
we were talking about tattoos and she showed me.
Wes has got a snake wrapped around a dagger on his shoulder.
your husband has a snake?
am l the only one who doesn't know what this is?
lt's a symbol. lt's Egyptian.
for what? - lt means you're a lesbian.
stop.
she says it symbolizes life.
l can't believe they're gonna give her one when there's so many of us, with husbands, who want to adopt.
Oh, come on.
a child needs a father.
l grew up without one.
l had four.
stepfathers.
my mother always said she hoped the next one would turn out better.
Oh, Lord. l can't look.
that oughta be a crime.
they look pretty happy. They're underfed, but happy.
makes me miss my puppies.
what are they? - Jack Russells.
we raise about a dozen at a time.
my George can get them fed on schedule and give them their shots, but they need their mama.
as if.
you are afraid? - Fish urinate in this stuff.
you think l'm gonna stick my face in it?
you are here alone? - With my posse.
with your mother.
l appreciate that.
you are a punk? - That would be stretching it.
you are a beach boy? - Student.
and this is like a field trip?
have you been to a disco here?
we have a lot of club.
everybody on the beach can see that.
would you like to go with me to one?
what's your name? - l'm Reynaldo.
sorry, Reynaldo. l've got socks older than you are.
good run?
terrific.
we're just deciding whether Leslie should have a kid or not.
do you wanna vote?
whoever she gets, l hope they've got no sense of fashion.
l'm sure in New York she looks fine.
she's what, a proofreader?
Editor--fiction books.
she gave me one she worked on.
what was it like?
kinda racy, lots of language.
language? - Curse words.
she's gonna have to get an fair.
can she afford that? - She's in publishing.
lf she is a lesbian, she won't have to worry.
they'll have it all organized.
mom...
the one in 214...
don't mess with the shower.
but she complained.
this woman changed rooms three times. She's done nothing but complain.
wait for Herminio.
and clean your glasses.
we should take it apart and leave it a few days, see how she likes it.
great idea. She'll be in my face, not yours.
wait for Herminio.
lf you're going to watch this crap, you should get cable.
leave it alone.
l can fix it. - You?
who's done more damage with those pliers than with your Molotov cocktails?
l'd like to light...
214 up.
listen, Mister.
we don't threaten our guests here.
understand?
why do we have to kiss their imperialist asses?
they're our guests.
lt's how we make a living.
and if you don't have a job, the judge sends you back to jail.
you and Uncle Ernesto, selling babies!
we provide a service. - A service for rich Yankees who...
would you be happier if the rich mothers came from here?
parasites!
fat, corrupt...
when l'm dead, you can invite your terrorist friends, fleas and all, to live here for free.
but until that day, we provide food and lodging of high quality to those who can pay.
and clean those damn glasses!
she never got fatter, which is a miracle with the crap kids eat these days. We had no idea of her condition.
do you know what month you're in?
maybe the second. The third at the most.
they don't tell us anything. When l was a girl...
have you considered an abortion?
that's not an option.
and raising it?
she's barely fifteen.
there are a lot of mothers who...
not Celia.
so what now? We bring it back here or give it up there?
we'll arrange that later.
and Celia...what do you think?
Consuelo.
that's your name for her, or theirs?
that's her name.
that she was given by--By her birth mother.
we plan to change ours to Henley.
your husband's name?
so they'll call him Junior? - They'll call him Henley, Jr.
you know, they can't say their J's.
you making fun of me? - No, really, it's genetic.
Leslie, don't be mean.
lt'll be, " My name is Henley Yunior. "
which one do you like?
you visiting here? - Si.
l don't know what to buy.
thank you.
damn it!
you can't use that if you can't read.
lt's mine!
that's really beautiful work.
l'd like something wider--cover this up.
birthmark? - lt's a burn.
Ouch.
that's how l learned what " hot " meant.
knocked over the steam iron?
l was playing with the knobs on the stove, which my mother had told me not to do a million times, and she had a skillet in her hand, so she grabbed my wrist...
God.
'you don't obey your mother, this is what happens. "
that's awful.
she never had to repeat herself to me again.
kids have to learn sometime.
well! They saw you coming.
ls Herminio here?
not yet.
l'll be in the bathroom.
water pressure, my ass.
you ladies are braver than l.
looks like Hemingway's rec room.
what's " sea food " again? - Mariscos.
what's the difference between grouper and snapper?
ls there one?
l'll have a mojito with lime, not lemon.
they know how to make 'em.
l didn't see any limes on the counter.
una cola?
what did l say? - That you wanted a tail.
l'm hopeless. - Daiquiri，por favor.
agua? - You didn't order bottled.
lt's a restaurant. lt's in the guidebook.
personally, l plan to get out of this country with my plumbing intact.
Where's Miss Congeniality?
she's off to run a marathon before lunch, work up an appetite.
she likes to keep fit.
and Hitler liked a parade... woman is obsessed.
what's the name of that movie where all the housewives turn into perfect-looking clones?
her husband is gorgeous.
you met him? - l saw a picture.
hiking in the Rockies, glowing with health.
she's very sweet. She's upbeat.
she's been waiting here longer than the rest of us, and she's still got a positive attitude.
l trust her as far as l can throw her.
that's because you're from New York.
that's 'cause l'm from planet Earth.
someday, one of her microchips is gonna misfire.
you'll see the real Skipper.
she'll open her mouth, this thing with six heads will come out.
there have been plenty of nasty things to come out of your mouth.
thank you.
guess how many seafood places called " El Pescadero " .
there are in this neighborhood.
we ordered you the bacon cheeseburger.
lf it's 2：30 here, then in Virginia...
lt's 2：30。lt's the same latitude. Longitude?
l have to call Henley.
poor thing.
Yeah, house in Newport, estate outside of D. C. boat bigger than my apartment?
they almost split up. - Jennifer and Henley, Sr?
that's not the best time to be adopting a child.
maybe we should rat her out to the agency.
maybe raising a child together will help their marriage.
my daddy always said that children were the glue that held a marriage together.
ln my parents' marriage, l was more like the hammer.
my mother used me to bang dents in my father.
lf they really are on the verge of breakup, l would hope that whoever was providing the personal references.
had the good sense to lie when necessary.
how can you say that?
cause if you're clueless enough to ask somebody who'd slag you on an adoption reference, you deserve what you get.
the whole thing is such a game.
they're just doing what they think is best for their bank accounts.
why do you think they've got us down here for so long?
they're gonna make us earn our babies.
lt's part of the balance of trades. - lt's not like that.
l'll bet you two pina coladas her Henley will fly down here some weekend, make a donation to Our Lady of Perpetual Red Tape, and they'll fly off with a little bundle of joy.
you sound so bitter.
l have been here over two months.
pregnant women wait nine.
Yeah, but they get to throw up and develop varicose veins.
leaving Sunday with a baby.
wouldn't that be awesome?
l called them yesterday and they said they'd let me know if anything...
lf you make yourself a nuisance, they stick you at the bottom of the pile.
well, you're not here, Henley. l'm here.
no, l don't think you should call the Korean people.
this isn't the commodities market, Henley.
right.
Right...yeah.
l just miss you.
you know, there's a lizard in my room.
no, a lizard, not a blizzard.
no, l said a lizard, like a chameleon, a gecko...
a lizard. Yeah.
lt makes this little noise at night, it's nice.
okay.
l miss--Hello?
l didn't say they don't have papaya.
l said " papaya " is another word for " pussy. "
pussy words? - Vaginal euphemism.
beaver, clam...
nobody here ordered clams, did they?
the lower on the food chain you eat, the better the nutritional value.
though the risk of toxicity increases.
thank you for sharing.
there is probably every disease known to man down here.
Elephantitis, beri-beri...
the thing for all of us to worry about are the infant syndromes, like...where the mother is intoxicated.
fas. - And drugs.
crack, all that.
they have crack here?
then there's the genes.
what do you do about genes? - My point exactly.
you could adopt a ticking time bomb and never know it.
lt's the same with birth kids.
but birth kids, you know both parents. You know family history.
ln my family, sometimes people are born with six toes.
on one foot.
people assume that if they have kids, they'll inherit all their favorite qualities.
lf you get dealt a weak hand, you can always train it out of them, but it's work.
roll up a newspaper. - l'm serious.
lf they are born with some kind of disability, racial, cultural, whatever-- you make them aware.
they've got some catching up to do, and you stay on their case.
l think you just watch them and see who they are and encourage what's best in them.
mine had better be calm. The one-neurotic-per-family rule.
appetizers. Skipper, any damage this is gonna do to my wellness, l don't wanna hear about it.
can you read this?
sure. lt's about a goat. - Will you read it to me?
maybe later.
look! Look!
think we can sell it? - Did they use it?
lf they did, nothing came out.
what is it?
lf Mom had had one of these, we wouldn't be here.
they arrange it all.
we just sign the papers and hand over the baby.
her?
mute like always.
l don't think she understands how serious this is.
can l help you?
l need to buy jeans a size bigger.
may be two.
and this one? lt's cheaper, but it only pays if all the numbers come up.
and then?
lf you win, you're king of the world.
l'll take just one.
no, gracias
ladies, ladies, if you choose one of them, the others, they go away.
how much is it?
whatever you think is reasonable is fine.
l don't know, what is this, four dollars?
that is very reasonable.
are you available? - Absolutely, yes. Always.
Blanca's learning to use a computer.
ln school? They have that now?
they've only got one. The students take turns.
so if she wants to go to the moon...
you need it for everything these days.
to clean rooms?
the Royal Princess has a computer that says which rooms are ready and which need cleaning.
but the maids?
the maids just clean.
we're too old to learn that stuff.
want to walk to the beach if there's time left?
the waves scare me. - The waves?
l can't swim.
right, you're a mountain girl.
l really think Blanca's going to graduate.
lf some guy doesn't nail her first.
we made a deal.
she graduates without getting pregnant, and l don't wring her neck.
my sister used to threaten to sew me up.
lt didn't work.
you think the American mothers eat the same stuff we do?
sure.
but they always want it cooked without lard.
are they Jews?
how long have you been a guide?
l'm not, but if you're with me, the others won't be bothering you.
we appreciate it. - Thank you.
your English is very good. - l wish that was true.
how did you learn it? - At the movies.
we have a cinema here and the actors speak in English, and...they...
right. lt's a very good school, believe me.
lf you're not a guide, what do you do?
now it's very difficult for us, for all the people here, and we have crisis.
we have economics crisis.
politics as well.
we have had some trouble. - You're out of work?
Yes.
l was building houses and office, schools... - Construction.
Yes, but that...
business is not so good now.
lt's a pity.
you girls... are you here for your vacations?
we're adopting babies.
sure. lt's our greatest exportation.
they're gonna get hit on whether we're with them or not.
maybe they'll meet some Latin hunk.
they're not looking. - lt's still good for the ego.
are you looking?
for a guy? l figured l've given that enough time.
l better get this baby thing started before l'm too old.
lt's tough being a single mother.
but you've only got a fight on one front.
you think the kid should go to bed at 6: 00, there's no big debate.
you're getting a girl, right? - Rebecca.
what's yours again? - We haven't decided yet.
l'm not gonna be one of these ones where there's lots of choices about the basic stuff.
lt's gonna be, " Here's your breakfast. Eat it or go hungry. "
she's not gonna call me by my first name or have a cell phone by the time she's 15.
tough love.
l see these women in New York, it's like their daughters are their best friend.
they go to the same hair salon, the same shrink?
forget it. l wanted more friends, l'd host a slumber party.
you think Zorro hung out here?
l'm not certain what you wish me to do.
your petition has been filed, the placement procedure is underway, so?
we're paying you.
l have to comply between both your wishes and the laws of my country.
so we do all the paperwork and you just pass it on?
lt may appear that way, but l can assure you that everything is
they said that we had to hire a local lawyer or it was no dice.
that's one of the regulations, yes.
lf you are unhappy, l can always recommend you another advocate, but to change at this point might prejudice your case.
so you've got us over a barrel?
at this rate, the baby will be talking full sentences before l get it.
l don't wanna have to undo all that.
undo?
these are crucial months for learning!
l understand this.
what l want is for you to move ourfile from the bottom of whatever pile it's on to the top!
lf we receive our child by the end of this week, there will be some kind of bonus in it for you, on top of your usual fee.
the government doesn't permit us to accept any kind.
the government doesn't have to know anything about this, do they?
unless, of course, there's someone that you have to pay off, and then youjust let me know the amount, and l will make sure, l will pretend you never suggested this.
bonus or not, it's still your job.
believe me, you don't want my husband to have to come down here.
l will do my best effort, but l promise you nothing.
dones't speak spanish. lt's Ernest.
Hey, brother. What's up?
the American ladies bugging you?
l'm here with a client, a Nancy Hightower.
the one in 214.
she's a witch.
Ruben and the rest of them want to poison her, but she's paid up through Monday.
two months, one week.
could you live with an early departure?
lt would make you happy?
get her out of here! The sooner, the better!
l understand perfectly.
what did the judge say about Buho's case?
that my nephew is an enemy of the state.
tell him Che is ancient history.
okay. See you Sunday.
l have made an inquiry.
l was right here. What did they say?
no promises have been given, but your paperwork is entering the final phase.
that's what you said the last time l got you on the phone.
Yes, but this is the final phase of the final phase.
l believe that your hopes will soon come to fruition.
l'm sorry, this is an inquiry from the Ministry.
araceli will see you out.
so we have a deal. - lf the Lord is willing.
you must forgive us, madame.
but here we don't accept American Express for our children.
but there is a cash machine in the lobby.
ministry of Human Services, please, the Director.
attorney Buendia calling.
you'll never get one of our precious children even if you torture me to death.
Gonzalo, how are you?
Buendia here.
listen, buddy, l've got a big favor to ask you.
l'm allowed to visit the kids but only if her sister is there in the room with us.
she doesn't trust me one bit.
before, l would have flipped out.
but now...now l try to think before l say anything stupid.
that's all.
thank you, Wilfredo.
and now, our visitor.
would you like to say something?
l don't know how many of y'all are gonna understand this, but my name is Gayle, and l'm an alcoholic.
you figure they had a lot of hangings here?
burnings at the stake, your basic inquisition-type stuff.
they had the lnquisition over here, too?
sure. lt just happened a few years later.
kinda like The Beatles coming to America.
are you religious?
not really.
for the interview, l said l was Ethical Culture.
what's that?
lf you're Jewish, it's like the last resort.
orthodox, Reformed, Unitarian, Ethical Culture.
Gayle is heavy-duty born again.
she's not obnoxious about it, though.
she doesn't, you know, proselytize.
Oh, that's how you say that.
as far as l know.
are you gonna send Rebecca...
are you gonna send her to public schools?
sure, send her off with crayons and a flak vest.
l'm serious. - So am l.
she's gonna have to bump up against the real world at some point.
this thing where they're interviewing four-year-olds to get them into the right daycare, so they get into the right prep school, so they can get into Yale early admissions?
lt costs a fortune, but it is your kid's future.
l figure if she doesn't absolutely despise me by the eighth grade, l'm ahead of the game.
at first the Spaniards was inside these walls and our people was outside.
then the great general Jose de San Martin arrived with his army, and the Spaniards were beaten.
thousands of people was losing their life.
l thought you weren't a guide.
l was in school for some years.
this is our history. l have brought my children here to show them.
how many children do you have?
are they in school?
when it's possible, yes.
may l ask you, which of the United States you are living in?
D. C.
that's where the White House is. Actually, it's not a state, it's a district.
also, we have a place in Rhode lsland.
the smallest of them all.
l'm from Colorado.
have you ever visited? - No.
but l have a great desire to do this.
do you know this city of Philadelphia?
sure.
someday l would like to find a job there.
why in Philadelphia? - lt's the Cradle of Liberty.
l'll show you where a dangerous piracy was driven to the sea.
this way.
do you think he'd be insulted if l gave him more than four dollars?
ls my son good for anything?
he's still very young.
young?
he's past thirty.
age isn't just years.
children are a curse.
l know. We've got eight.
eight! How do you support them?
with great difficulty, ma'am.
his father gets mixed up in politics, goes into exile.
l thought all that was over.
first the government wanted to kill him, now l do.
living with a Spanish girl who's half his age, right?
the man is totally shameless.
off playing the fool, while l'm stuck with these whining mothers and all the bills to pay!
men get mixed up in politics like it's no big deal.
then get the military pissed off.
and who's left to order the linens?
this is better on my table, but it's too bulky to bring down.
l'm okay.
are you manipulating my aura?
something like that.
you have to see where the hot spots are, where the energy polarizes.
that really deep stuff is sort of...
don't worry, l don't do anything too intense.
l think l feel something.
there's quite a knot in here.
something emotional.
do you do this on children? - Sometimes.
they get most of what they need from, you know, handling.
do you think that they can tell if it's not their real mother that's holding them?
you're gonna be the real mother.
lf l were to breastfeed...
the idea of letting someone else's suck on me.
l guess l'm not that maternal.
you're not a mother yet.
now visualize an emotional state and try to send it all to one specific part of your body.
like? - Why don't we try anxiety?
how'd you come up with that one?
try to put it all here.
do you think Henley's too much of a load? As a name?
names aren't so important.
he's just not gonna look anything like his father, and to have this whole " junior " thing laid on him...
your husband must feel strongly about it.
well, we looked through a name book.
we both really liked Joshua.
there's way too many of those.
we had a Joshua.
you had a little boy?
the first one was gonna be Cody if it was a girl, which it was.
l was young enough. We didn't ask for an amnio.
and you miscarried.
l've read that... sometimes they end, and the mother didn't even know she was pregnant.
this was in the last trimester.
Oh, God.
that's terrible.
they said she, they knew it was a she by then, " She's not gonna be viable. You'll have to carry to term. "
so you had...
lt was like a delivery, but without the same spirit.
nobody brings a video camera.
and with Joshua?
he was born with his lungs not properly formed, and with Gabriel, it was his heart. Turn over.
there was another one?
did they both... - Lived.
joshua lived about two days, and Gabriel hung on for a whole week.
they were incredible.
you're not drinking enough water.
what? - Your kidneys.
this tells me you're not flushing well.
how...
l can't...
how do you get past that?
Losing...losing three babies.
lmagine that you're made of light and that you're spreading outward into a black sky.
lie down.
excuse me. With your permission.
no, come on in. You can work around me.
l'm writing to relatives in lreland...big family?
me, too. How many?
how many?
five brothers, four sisters.
there's nine of us.
old-fashioned Catholic, l guess.
there were six of us.
three older brothers, but two are dead now.
and l take care of the little ones.
whoever this little girl is that l'm getting, my daughter, she's got a roomful of cousins.
my daughter.
listen to me.
don't think l've called her that before.
do you speak any English?
lt's pretty weird, you know.
because you have no idea of who it is you're getting, really.
but you can't help have these ideas, these...fantasies.
l have this day in my head.
and l used to daydream it lt's early winter and there's snow.
we get some serious winters in Boston.
you don't have snow down here, do you?
snow?
a snowfall.
like the state, right?
lt's a day when there's no school. lt's a snow day.
and l let her sleep late.
and she's little, but she's old enough to go to school.
she's third grade, maybe.
and l let her sleep late.
l come in, and she's this little, warm bump in the bed.
and l say, " Darling, it's a snow day. l'm gonna let you sleep. "
you enjoy it more if you know you're getting extra, that usually you'd be up and brushing your teeth.
finally, she gets up and she comes out in her pajamas, and l make her cocoa with, you know, those little marshmallows on the top?
and then we talk about what we're gonna do that day.
and you can hear the snow shovels outside crunching.
the plows rumble by every once in a while, scraping the streets, and it's still falling, so it stays clean on top of everything, white.
then l get her dressed-- all the layers.
although now it's a lot less with the polarfleece.
and she can do most of it herself, but you help because it's a pleasure.
her arm on your neck while she balances to put her boots on.
no thought of it. You're just an extension of her body.
we go to the Common, or we go way out to Jamaica Pond, depending on the weather.
and she's just bold enough to skid out away from me a little bit.
shaky, but she keeps looking back to see if l'm watching her.
she always comes back to lean on me and rest.
and there's zillions of kids, and they're all ages.
they're zipping around and that makes her really excited, but mostly, she just wants to be with me.
just the two of us.
and then later, when l take her to Shakey's or Ground Round, whatever seems like a big treat to her, and l let her orderfrench fries, as long as she has some of my soup, too, and she tells me stories about her classmates, or she tells me stories that she's made up, or whatever.
we sit and we talk in the booth.
and we're surrounded by other mothers and their kids.
and l am just one of them, you know?
and then later when we walk home from wherever l can park the car, there is the sound of ourfeet on the new snow her taking two steps to my one.
then maybe if they haven't shoveled the walk, like they usually don't, l go in front, to break the way for her.
this is ignoring the fact that l am supposed to be at work, right?
l'm the one with the job.
l have a little girl up North.
l named her Esmeralda.
she'll be four years old on the ninth of April.
who knows?
l was so young.
l had to take care of my brother and sister. l had to work.
the nuns...they came to see me.
they said that it would be best to give her up.
sometimes when a new group of mothers comes, l pick one.
a good one.
l try to imagine herface, her voice.
when l think of Esmeralda with her other mother up there in the North, l hope that my little girl has found a mother like you.
l didn't get any of it.
excuse me.
l'm sorry.
what's up?
nothing much.
Zoila said you were looking for me, with some big news.
Zoila doesn't know shit.
you still hanging at the beach?
no, l've had...
l've been sick.
better now?
lt'll be over soon.
great.
we're going to Miami.
who knows how long.
what do they have in Miami we don't have here?
lt's bcause my mother's old-fashioned and has to drag me everywhere.
you look different.
the boss.
see you around.
l don't think so.
who'd you rob to get this?
what's it to you?
there's not enough left to buy doughnuts.
forget about it.
little shits.
l brought these.
they'll do.
a passport costs forty thousand with a birth certificate, too, it's sixty thousand.
and the plane ticket? - That depends.
toronto, Chicago, New York, Miami, it's riskier but you get there.
lf you want to fly to Mexico and cross the border...
and Philadelphia?
no direct flights to Philadelphia.
ls there a way l can pay half now and owe the rest?
what do l look like? Come back when you can pay.
one, two, three generations without a father or with one who's unemployed or in jail.
children need role models. They need a dream to follow.
lnstead we have this permanent despair, kids growing up with no concept of work or responsibility.
this is why l won't go out on the streets alone after dark.
sure, there were excesses in the past, but when l was a girl, we had a sense of dignity.
now, this is more like it.
how many stars are next to this in the guidebook?
we'll be fine as long as you don't get into the wine list.
l'm treating. - Come on.
no, l want to.
no... - l don't--no.
one last drink and that's it. - lt's ridiculous.
nobody here wants them. - And why not?
because they've fucked us from every angle economically, psychologically, politically.
lt's more than just them.
another round, please!
lmagine our lives if they just disappeared.
how come they need so many?
can't they breed their own?
they're too busy making money to procreate.
or maybe it's their technology.
l don't trust those microwaves.
lt's just anotherform of cultural imperialism.
we supply the raw material and they refine it.
you think they'd let us bring their kids here?
lots of opportunity up there. - For whites only.
Hector, my Cuban friend, he was in Panama when they kidnapped Noriega.
too bad they didn't kill him.
and he told me that the Yankee invaders were from every race!
chinese, Latinos, Blacks, Whites.
exactly my point.
that's where l'm heading! - That's what l'm saying, too!
lf it comes to a show down the little bastards shooting at us will be our own.
an order of cheese empanadas for two, chicken soup, roast pork with rice.
and two margaritas.
les.
l'm sorry, l forgot.
l'm sorry.
make that one margarita and one pina colada without rum.
without rum.
twenty minutes.
l'll start timing them in half an hour.
no big hurry.
do you think the others think we're being anti-social?
there's no rule that says we have to do everything in a group.
of course, if the dog lady and Miss Triathlon weren't here...
skipper is a good person.
you cut people a lot of slack.
lt's just her...her exterior is a bit intimidating.
did you order the cheese thingies, the turnovers?
but of course.
l eat any more cheese, l might never poop again.
l got the opposite problem. - Still?
l know the location of every flush toilet in South America.
their stuff is worse than our stuff.
l just wish l could speak it like you do.
you don't need to understand the words to watch TV.
stupidity is the universal language.
she was a Communications major--Nan.
that's news. - At Kansas State.
she told me she went to the University of Missouri, majored in Political Science.
what did she tell you her husband does for a living?
engineer.
high school chemistry teacher.
you're kidding.
"they get through a year with my George, they know that periodic table backwards and forwards. "
Wow.
lf l tell you something, you promise not to pass it on?
only if it's really juicy. - She steals.
steals what?
off the maids' carts.
l've seen her take a half dozen of those shampoos, soaps, those little mints they put on our pillow at night.
you're shitting me.
she just fills her pockets with them.
l suppose she assumes it's her right.
lt's...furtive.
furtive. l love it.
l was halfway down in the stairs, so she didn't know l saw her, but she just looked both ways, and she just dug right in.
and everything is so cheap down here.
she always seems so in control.
most of your serial killers are totally methodical.
come on.
l know you guys aren't supposed to dis anybody, but you gotta admit, she's a sociopath.
ls that anything like a psychopath? - With a lower body count, yeah.
then why are we letting her have a child?
you have to know how to handle these people.
they've got an inferiority complex.
lord knows they have reason to have one, but you have to know what's bark and what's bite.
you don't think every one of us couldn't have finished our business and been long gone by now?
they just wanna hold yourfeet to the fire a little, make the gringos squirm.
that's exactly how l felt when they were doing all that fertility testing.
like they were making up new stuff just to try on me.
l had two operations.
one was a tubal ligation and this other thing.
l never totally understood the point.
nothing, right? - lt must work for somebody.
lt works for the doctors.
you don't wanna know what those bastards put me through.
they had me on this stuff with nun's pee in it.
ls this a regular doctor? - ltalian nun's pee?
lt has some kind of a hormone?
from women of a certain age who haven't been sexually active.
l've read about it. - lt's a racket.
they tried to talk my George into some business with his gonads.
l thought he was going to choke the intern.
here we go. London broil, baked potato.
l think we scored, ladies.
we could say something. - To who?
to the people at the agency down here. - That would go down real well.
'ln light of the persistent and malicious disappearance of our pillow mints, we the undersigned-- "
so what do we do?
l don't know.
be really good mothers to ours.
pray for Rosemary's baby.
this is serious. - l know.
lt's life, though.
do you know how many manuscripts we get submitted every year where the basic story is the mom's a fruitcake?
lt's a whole genre.
so, we're what, afraid to rock the boat, get the ministry riled up, throw a little hitch into that adoption schedule?
we just don't like her, that's all.
the kid, whoever it is, will survive.
where we gonna sleep tonight?
don't worry about that.
put it here.
gold is the best. Gold and silver.
none for me?
maybe a little bit. Later.

Eileen Mulroney. l got here as soon as l could.
the traffic was...
have a seat, please.
you, too?
looks like it. - That's great.
Congratulations. - Likewise.
l left mine at the hotel.
be my guest.
Thanks.
lt was so sudden.
l had a pretty good idea. - You did?
l lit a fire under my lawyer yesterday.
spread some money around. - Really?
got their attention.
put in a good word for you, too.
thank you.
ln two minutes, my life will never be the same.
her name's going to be Esmeralda.
did l tell you that?
who knows what lies ahead for you?
maybe a wonderful life.
what do you want me to do here? - Break it off.
from analyst to associate in four months- that's gotta be a record for this office.
I don't know if I'm gay or I'm straight.
I was just exploring all of this, and now I'm, I'm a parlor game for bored assistants.
who was I engaged to?
did he even love me?
right now it seems like the only way Jack and i can communicate is through one and half million readers.
I know about Cilla Grey.
she says she's going to sleep with one of my friends.
and, Davis, we're even.
okay, Eric- laser tag.
artillery wall here.
recharging station here.
death mazes- actually, I haven't fully figured it out.
and, uh, it's a little more expensive, but I think we should seriously consider an annihilation chamber.
this from the woman who shuts off Road Runner cartoons because of falling anvils.
it's Luke's birthday.
trust me, I know. You've been planning it for over eight months.
he wants laser tag. - And he's gonna get it.
don't you think you're going a little overboard?
this just cannot be a repeat of last year.
Oh, Will you stop beating yourself up? - I ruined our son's birthday!
you didn't ruin anything. Luke didn't have a horrible time.
well, what an accomplishment. Aren't I just supermom?
Yeah, you know, actually, sometimes you are.
Ohh. - What?
I've gotta get into the office now.
okay, so what's the schedule look like?
later in the week, we'll get in the conference room. We'll meet with the...
Shane, good morning. Did you have a nice flight?
Oh, yeah. Killed at some "halo 3," then threw down some code for my new site.
nice. - Hey, sweet offices.
and we're gonna sell your company for some sweet money.
Katherine, could I see you for a sec? - Sure.
just be one minute. - Excuse me.
so you started the meeting without me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Zoe. It's just, he was waiting.
and I appreciate that, but that really wasn't your call to make.
Zoe, Clayton promoted me because he has confidence in my abilities.
he keeps telling me to take more initiative.
Yeah, and we're all very appreciative of your abilities.
but Clayton isn't handling this deal. I am, which means that you're pulling rank.
that I'm responsible for everything that happens on this deal, which means I lead, you follow, and you don't make a move without clearing it with me first.
okay, I hear you, and I get it. I'm really sorry.
um, would it be okay with you if I pee before heading back into the conference room?
I think that would be fine.
hello. - This is such a surprise.
you didn't even tell me you were coming.
Oh. Mwah. I know. - She surprised me, too.
daddy had a dentist appointment with that jewish man on riverside.
Ugh. I've been up since 5: 00 A. M.
I already walked 4 miles, closed an escrow and marinated some beef.
so... how do you like my new office?
well... it's very big.
do you share it with other people?
mom, I am the publisher of all the magazines, the entire company.
I don't need to share an office.
we've got big problems with Katie's nipples.
these are my parents.
Wendy is the editor of "Havoc."
they weren't airbrushed out. Did you approve that?
no. I am the publisher.
I don't deal with... nipples.
we need to send Katie something now!
you have to authorize the expenditure-at least 20 grand!
she's very energetic.
welcome to my world.
Mia, have you been, um, seeing anyone new?
Mom,Jack and i just broke up. - I never liked him.
you are much smarter than him, and he knew it.
I have someone better. - Oh, no. No, really, mom.
no "no, really, mom." This one is it.
no. You always think that they're "it"s, and they're not.
Jason Chun. He's a doctor, Mia, - and he's never been married. - No.
just moved here from Seattle. - No.
and his mother says he's very handsome.
Oh, like that's not the kiss of death.
and he wants to meet you for coffee at 5: 00 today.
what? Mom!
there's only one way to stop her. - Dad...
okay, fine, I'll meet him, but only if you promise me not to try again for a minimum of one year.
mommy just wants you to be happy.
I am happy. Very!
look around! Happy!
mom, I mean it. One year. I am marking the date in my calendar.
we love what you've done in Miami, but if you're serious about taking your boutique hotel and turning into a worldwide brand, you need to close this deal.
every hotel must be worthy of the Gerard Dumais name.
you're going to be very happy with some of the changes we've made to the language in section three.
words again, just words.
I think in colors and music and textures.
that is the language that speaks to me.
and if our legal department could draft a contract in that language, nobody would be happier than me.
nothing is planned without my approval.
I can veto sites. I can veto architect.
I can veto the kind of whisky we serve in the bar.
I hope you are prepared for this.
collaborating with a perfectionist will not be easy.
trust me. You're talking to one.
then how can you work in a building where the windows do not open?
that's the design of the building.
the windows in my hotels- they open.
and that's non-negotiable.
what's up with Pep Le Pew?
please. I've been trapped in my office with him for hours.
Really? You trying to make me jealous?
no, and you shouldn't be.
even Paris doesn't sound good to me right now.
come outside with me. I, uh, have a surprise.
I am taking you to a romantic dinner at blue hill at Stone Barns.
Oh, Davis, that's sweet, but I-I'm meeting the girls for drinks, and it's so far out of town.
exactly. Care to drive?
Davis, what did you do?!
I bought my beautiful wife a beautiful car.
an Aston Martin? You just don't go out and buy one of these.
Really? I did it this morning. It felt great.
I was thinking how you said you loved the Bartells'when we went to visit them at palm beach.
I was just making conversation. They're so tedious, and we never even get out of the city.
we need to start taking some romantic getaways.
you do realize you're out of your mind?
completely, but we are moving forward, so let's do it in style.
just don't go getting any funny ideas about the backseat.
you know what else I was thinking about?
you know how they do those at-home spreads in "Portmanteau"?
Yes, of course. It's one of Mia's magazines.
they do that "New York power couple" thing every year. It'd be fun to be in it.
I'd feel like an exhibitionist with people thumbing through, looking at our house, our things.
all right, just an idea. Think about it. And I bet mia would love it.
Davis, you already got a ticket?
and what were you doing in Southampton?
uh, I had to see this investor, Charlie Nadler, a big shot pain in the ass.
wouldn't drive into the city. But the guy's connected, so I...
I thought you just picked up the car this morning.
no, I got it detailed this morning.
it came from the factory dirty?
no, it got dirty driving back from the Hamptons, and I wanted it to be perfect when I gave it to you, okay?
honey, that's a traffic ticket. That's not something to get uptight about.
I am not uptight. I just- I had to see an investor.
if you want, I can get him on the phone. I'm sure that he'd be happy to have
don't be an ass, Davis.
I'm not looking for an alibi.
good, because you don't need to.
thank you for the car.
I love it almost as much as you do.
Mia? - Jason? It's nice to meet you.
I hope you don't mind, I got you a choice- uh, double cap, espresso or green iced tea.
very efficient.
so how often does your mother try to make you do this?
once a day would be a conservative guesstimate.
you?
well, I just leveraged this coffee date to dial her back to once a year.
so you're a doctor?
I am the new chief of neurosurgery and the professor of new neurotherapies at N.Y.U.
you're a brain surgeon? - Yeah.
is that funny? - No, it's great.
it's just that you don't really meet brain surgeons, you know, unless there's something scary inside your head.
other than the voice of your boss or your mother.
should I crack it open and take a look?
that's more of a second date thing for me.
so what do you do?
um, well, I'm the publisher of Barnstead Media.
so I oversee about a dozen publications... and various other media.
I'm sorry.
yeah? He's doing fine. - Hello?
no, I can't approve $25, 000 for an apology gift.
that's the normal side effect of radiation. - Well, then just send a nice note.
he's completely cancer-free. - They're just nipples!
well, I put that fire out.
so, Shane, let's just think of today's meeting as a kind of a warm-up, because Intracom's fine, but your best match is going to be Brooks Omni media.
sweet.
they're an old media concern on the market for a beachhead to cross-platform their brands.
so in terms of me, that means...
buttloads of cash.
awesome.
Oh, and, Shane, I got you a little something... for good luck.
so...
you mean... to wear?
only if you want to. We all love the casual silicon valley thing, but the money guys- they're not so good at looking at toes, even their own, god forbid.
Oh! Look, there's socks in there, too.
bike messenger, 23rd and Madison.
baby stroller, 81st and Columbus.
Oh! You got nailed by an upper west side stroller mommy?
Hey, those women use their strollers as battering rams.
plowed right through me so she could get a Korean frozen yogurt.
this has been great.
I know, and I so wasn't expecting it to be. - Yeah, me neither.
better get back to the grind.
well, it was great meeting you.
you, too. - Thanks again.
Mia, he was probably just distracted. - By what?
Oh, some little thing like, "if I'm off by a thousandth of a millimeter on Mrs. Smith's temporal lobe, she'll be walking backwards and hiccuping for the rest of her life."
whatever with his brain surgeon problems.
Mia, what would you think if I wanted to be in the "portmanteau" power couple issue?
isn't the timing a little off? I mean, you and Davis being a power couple?
Davis and I are committed to making our marriage work.
just like that?
well, obviously, it takes time, but why not move forward and do something bold and positive?
I sure as hell don't want to end up like one of those angry, drunken W.A.S.P.S in an Edward Albee's play.
did you see the one where the husband cheated on the wife with a goat?
I would rather it had been a goat than Cilla Grey.
at least it would have saved me the S.T.D. Screenings.
Caitlin, are you going to Luke's party?
cause he seems to think you're the only adult capable of firing a laser pistol.
I want to so bad, but I'm swamped with the Serenity launch.
and I, um, have a thing on saturday.
what do you mean, a thing? - I get nervous when she says "thing."
the last "thing" ended with a slurred 3: 00 A. M. "Come and pick me up, I don't know where I am" panic call.
it was an Italian restaurant in Nolita, and I forgot what it was called.
it was called "Burritoville," and it was in the meatpacking district, but close.
well, I have a lesbian bridal shower.
with Alicia? - No, Juliet, with Joey Briggs from the sanitation department. Of course with Alicia.
I just didn't know that you would take a date to a bridal shower.
well, it's sort of a date/meet-my-friends combo.
"meet my friends"? That sounds serious.
well, it's definitely significant.
I actually like waking up with her.
being gay agrees with you. - I know. It's been almost a month!
hear, hear. - Yes.
twice as long as the last five guys and 29 days longer than tae bo, cognitive therapy and carb-busters. And why?
because women are sensitive to each other's needs. Women communicate.
if you feel weird or uncomfortable about something, you talk about it.
God, what would that be like? - Yeah, really.
it'd be like, "hey! What's up with that handshake?"
Oh, my god, Mia, again with the brain surgeon!
then you shook my hand and bolted. Was it the lighting?
did I smell like feet? Did i have unsightly panty lines?
uh, Mia. Mia.
or did I have a giant, gaping herpe on my lips?
Mia. - Ow!
Wow. It's great to see you.
Yeah, it's great.
you look terrific.
Oh, congrats on that Bartoli job.
Oh, that was- - Hey, Jack. Sorry. I was running a little late.
Liz, hi. This is Mia.
Mia, this is Liz.
I've hear so much about you.
and I've... seen you on cable, reading the news.
Hey, are you going to Caleb Stackpole's party on saturday?
Oh! Sure, yeah. Why? Are you gonna be there?
Yeah. Caleb's still a buddy.
I used to send him out on assignments all the time.
Oh, looks like our table's ready.
it was so nice meeting you. Will we see you at Caleb's?
Yes. I can't wait. We'll see you there.
okay, see you.
there's no way in hell I'm going to that party.
Oh, you're going. - Time to call the brain surgeon, honey.
Absolutely. - And you're not going to that thing alone.
what? - Not if he's going with that thing.
you are so much prettier than her.
I am not calling the hand-shaking brain surgeon.
Mia, I'm sure he really liked you. - How could he not?
it's so humiliating, and I am not good with rejection.
listen, do you want to go to that party alone with that talking head of a slut throwing you shade?
I don't think so.
mom, I don't have to be in those stupid pictures, do I?
honey, it's up to you.
I know your dad wanted you to, but...
he offered to buy me a horse. How desperate is that?
okay, so Leanna's mom got us tickets to Justin Timberlake, and she's going to take us to Boston.
well, even dad can't compete with Justin Timberlake.
I say go for it.
love you. I'll see you tonight?
see you tonight.
did you tell Emily you'd buy her a horse?
sorry. I didn't know you were on the phone.
okay, great. I'll talk to you then.
sorry. Nadler caught me just before I got in.
uh... how long has the water been running?
let's see. I, uh, turned it on at 7: 43, just before the call came in at 7: 44.
and it's now 7: 46.
so... long enough to get nice and steamy. Want to join me?
I have to get to work, but maybe I'll take a raincheck.
okay, but, uh, if you change your mind...
it's a hamptons prefix, which is where he got the ticket, which according to him is where this investor lives.
so why should I doubt him?
rhetorical question, right?
we can't rebuild our marriage if I'm paranoid all the time.
why don't you just call the number?
nobody answers. I keep getting some automated voice mail.
he is so obnoxious. - Who?
gerard Dumais. He sends these ranting, expletive-filled e-mails to my entire company.
if he weren't so talented, I would just smack him.
anyway, Jules, it's not really paranoia, not when there's a history that gives you a reason to be suspicious.
I can't wait for the magazine shoot.
what are the captions gonna say?
dashing Davis Draper and his powerful but suspicious wife Juliet.
I can cancel it like that.
Oh, my god.
I just e-mailed everyone, "Ignore Gerard. He's a pompous little bastard."
good. - I hit "reply all."
his name's on the distribution list.
you're kidding. - I can't stop it.
I am never multitasking again.
how many times have we said that?
okay, major damage control to do. Excuse me.
Oh, hang on a second. - Jules, it's fine. Go fix.
no, you're not getting out of it that easily.
did you call the brain surgeon? - I can't bring myself.
pick up the phone. - Okay, fine. Just go.
Jason, it's Mia Mason. It was nice meeting you.
I'm going to this brunch on saturday at Caleb Stackpole'S. Do you want to come?
Zoe! There you are.
listen, the Brooks Omnimedia people need to move the meeting to sunday afternoon.
what? No, that's impossible.
it's the only time they can do it. - It's my son's birthday party.
I know that, but they've heard we've met with other buyers, and Clayton feels like we can get...
Sunday afternoon?
what do you want to tell 'em, Zoe?
that you need to move the meeting because you want to play laser tag?
I have been planning this for weeks.
the one time I specifically set aside a moment to...
and that is why we work in teams.
Katherine has been on this with you from the beginning.
have I mentioned how delightful that has been?
and if you think that she can handle this deal without me, you're out of your mind.
I'm a managing director. She's been out of school for a year.
she knows the ins and outs of this deal like the back of her hand.
she learned from the best.
Dan Brooks is used to dealing with me.
we made it quite clear to Dan that you would not be able to attend.
I'm sorry. You made a decision on my behalf, and then you conveyed that to my client?
the firm's client, Zoe.
I'm managing director as well.
and with all due respect, it seemed like a safe bet.
I mean, what are you gonna do, Zoe, not go to your child's birthday party?
this isn't the time to experiment with taking off the training wheels.
I will be there to back her up.
well, how convenient for both of us.
look, Zoe, I'm sorry, but unless you figure out a way to split yourself in half, you need to make a choice.
I've made my choice.
Davis, hi.
honey, you're gonna hate me, but I can't make dinner tonight.
nadler is threatening to pull his funds.
nadler again?
Yeah, I'm probably gonna be late and just get some deli... or starve.
I'm sorry, honey. I was really looking forward to it.
me, too. - I'll make it up to you.
don't wait up, okay? I love you.
no one is available right now.
searching...
no matches directory assistance. What city, please?
Southampton. - I think you said "lake placid."
Oh, screw this. - I think you said
Zoe. Thank god. A human being.
were you able to find out anything about the number I gave you?
Hey, I just got off the phone with the C. F.O. of Teckcom Global.
it looks like Davis was telling the truth.
the mystery number is billed to a Charles Nadler, Southampton, New York.
okay, now I'm actually feeling guilty for feeling so relieved that Davis is actually telling the truth.
I can't let you. - I don't care.
I need to see her now. - But she's busy, sir.
Ohh. Oh, god. Gotta call you back. - She's never been too busy for me.
Gerard, I've been trying to reach you all day.
do you really want to be in business with such a pompous little bastard?
Gerard, I am so sorry. - First, I am anything but little.
that was an unfortunate outburst in a heated moment. It was just... words.
but it was unprofessional, so if you feel the need to withdraw from this deal because I hurt your feelings, I understand.
what? You don't think I've been called a bastard by a beautiful woman before?
but what I don't want is you calling me that behind my back.
I would rather you say it to my face.
Gerard, if I think you're being a bastard again, I'll tell you.
you have my word.
excellent.
see, this selling my company to you- it is like a marriage between us.
in a way, yes.
there has to be trust and communication.
otherwise, problems fester, resentments pile up. It does not work.
I agree completely.
from now on, we have a problem, we communicate directly.
we start fresh tomorrow with a clean slate.
you're absolutely right.
thank you, Gerard. To a clean slate.
Philippe? Juliet Draper.
I know this is last minute, but can you wrap me up two of the most decadent things you have on the menu?
Hi, honey. - Oh!
honey, what are you...
Cilla. How lovely to see you.
this is not what it looks like.
Really? Well, then what is it, Davis?
I'd better go. - No, please stay.
I brought braised short ribs and roasted beets.
sounds a little too rich for my tastes.
Oh, Cilla, what could possibly be too rich for your tastes?
Juliet, please.
do you have any idea how foolish I feel right now?
it was business. - Oh, business?
I went to Cilla for money. - What?
there are things going on that you don't know about.
there are problems with my fund. - Oh, stop it, Davis.
stop trying to blame your lack of character on your hedge fund problems.
take some responsibility for once. - That is what I am trying to do.
the fund is tanking. I'm in hot water.
what would you suggest I do, short of dipping back into our
dipping back into our what?
look, the fund just needed a quick shot in the arm.
how much of our money, davis?
I am showing my investors that I have confidence in my fund.
so you use our money when you know it's tanking, then blow $200, 000 on a car?!
it's going to turn around. I promise.
and the car-it's just a little window dressing.
it shows people that we're doing well. It's about presentation. It's about image.
I thought it was about romantic getaways.
that's not how I meant that.
well, how nice that we're all just props for your photo shoot.
I'd like to think that I was comforted by the stupidly optimistic notion that you were doing it out of guilt.
the last thing I wanted to do was to go to Cilla for money, but that is the only reason I went to her. You have to believe that.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
Hey.
well?
I did some digging around.
word is that Davis' fund has taken some big hits on mortgage-backed securities.
Investorare gonna get rewed.
he really knows how to spread it around, doesn't he?
what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I go back and forth.
Davis and I have a lot invested in this marriage.
the truth is, he lied
maybe not about the thing you thought he was lying about, but he still lied.
he knew I'd be shocked. In his own messed-up way, he was trying to protect me.
what, just like he was trying to protect you from finding out about the affairs?
it's all so black and white for you. I- I really envy that.
I'm not saying it's easy. I'm just...
you need to do what's right for you.
I need to do what's right for my marriage.
it seems as though I'm at a bridal shower or a baby shower or some sort of shower every weekend.
when it's my turn, I can hit the ground running.
I never even thought about it. I wouldn't know where to start.
well, you're in very good hands. We've actually seen her taking notes.
guys.
Erika and Susie are making plans to get pregnant.
I'm gonna have the first one, and Susie is gonna carry the second.
seems fair.
Erika is a little freaked out about the insemination.
Oh, it's not so bad.
our friend steven's gonna be the donor.
he works for Calvin, so he's totally gorgeous.
if you two decide to have a family, where will you get your sperm from?
will you excuse me a sec?
Oh, god! Sorry. - No, no, no. It's okay, you're cool.
um, everything's all put away.
I didn't mean it like that. It's not like I haven't seen them before...
I mean, not like a ton. Sorry.
Hey. relax.
you look beautiful.
I get a spray-on tan.
okay. Well, the bathroom's all yours.
Oh. Maybe next time you should lock the door.
Yeah, maybe next time you should knock.
see you out there. - Yeah.
so it's nice seeing you again.
I was worried that you'd be busy or in surgery or something.
well, just had to move a procedure or two.
you bumped a brain surgery for me?
you kidding? I've been really looking forward to this.
I am a huge fan of Caleb Stackpole.
di you read that piece about his Roraima expedition?
I published that piece.
he scaled Cerro Marahuaca in three days.
do you know how steep that peak is?
nobody's done that since the 1800s.
well, Caleb knows that, and he wanted me to mention that several times in the article.
okay, I have to ask.
if I hadn't called you to invite you to this thing, would you have ever called me?
that's a tough one.
what do you mean, it's a tough one?
I don't really... go for Chinese.
excuse me. What?
Oh, come on.
all that pressure from your parents to date a nice Chinese boy
doesn't that send you in the opposite direction?
no, it most certainly does not.
how many Asian men have you dated?
tons.
okay, two... in junior high.
fine. You made your point.
it's nothing personal. I think you're great.
you're smart. You're funny. You're successful
listen, it's fine, and it explains so much, which is good, I guess.
I... I didn't mean to mislead you.
probably should have said something when you called. It's just...
listen, do me a favor.
when we get in there, can you act like you're really into me?
cause my ex is going to be there. - Okay.
and be really brilliant and dazzling and all... oh, brain surgery-esque.
what, like that's gonna be hard?
more powerful than ever, more beautiful than ever...
an unstoppable ascension to the pinnacle of perfection.
how long did it take you to come up with that one?
it's good, right? - Caleb, this is Jason Chun.
I just finished your book about Afghanistan.
that part about the caves in Tora Bora was intense.
don't get him started on the caves of Tora Bora.
eh, get her. Now that she's in charge of a magazine empire, she's editing conversations.
I'm getting you both drinks. - Great.
Oh, hello. - Jack, hi.
nice to see you again.
um, this is... my guy-jason chun.
Jason just moved to the city.
nice to meet you. - Cool. What for?
I just got a job offer at N.Y.U.
Oh. Jay, stop being so modest.
they created a position for him-chief of neurosurgery and professor of new neurotherapies.
you should do a piece on him.
he's pretty much the go-to guy for cutting-edge neuro.
he's developing this fantastic nano-techno apparatus that's still in trials.
the therapy is still in its early days, but Mia has so much faith in me, it's-it's inspiring.
he's too modest. That's the only thing I don't like about him.
well, that's great. How did you guys meet?
well, I was at my coffee place, and
and now she's being too modest.
the truth is, I saw an article about her announcing her promotion, and I thought, wow, not only beautiful... But smart and powerful?
I had to meet her.
and then on the way back down-bullet ants.
now I have been snack food for piranhas, leeches, snakes.
but, man, this was the worst.
I wish you would have brought some back.
you have an ant farm?
we've been discovering medicinal purposes for all kinds of animal venom.
I'm doing this trial right now for a brain stem glioma treatment using scorpion venom.
and it's looking very promising, isn't it, babe?
Yes, sweetheart. We're very hopeful.
I was hoping you would come find me.
and why would I do that?
to give me your number.
well, I would have given it to you in the bathroom, but looked like you had your hands full.
thanks for noticing.
I'm Sam, by the way.
Sam. You do realize that that's a lesbian bridal shower?
no, I had no idea. Is that why all those pretty girls are kissing each other?
so you intentionally hit on gay women?
um, just the lipsticks.
how's that workin' out for ya? - Depends on your answer.
what would you say to a date date?
a date date?
are you sure you want to break precedent?
I think it's time to shake things up.
I like being with you. I had a great time.
hope you did, too. - I did.
well, this time, I'm gonna call you...
tomorrow. In the morning.
what's the earliest I can call you?
on a sunday? 9: 00.
and remember, you must show good, sportsmanlike conduct.
and that means no swearing, no cursing, no cuss words, no shooting people in the back.
it's not fair. Why do you guys have to be on my team?
old people totally suck at this game. - We're not old.
we've been working really hard to make this a nice day for you.
shouldn't you be a little nice back?
well, you better listen to me, because I don't wanna lose on my birthday.
Yes, captain.
uh, this-this is a really violent game.
yeah? - Die, die, die!
okay, everyone! Go!
Zoe, ambush!
get him, mom! It's 100 points!
100 points?
go, go, go, go! - Come on, come on! Yeah!
die!
die!
honey, can I... - I'll cover you!
ha on!
Katherine, I can't hear you.
I'm so glad we reached you. Can you talk for a minute?
what is it, Katherine?
can you help me better explain the debt structure to Mr. Brooks?
I've been over my powerpoint presentation
powerpoint presentation? Are you kidding me?
Mr. Brooks thought that you might be able to clarify
if dan brooks wanted me to clarify, he shouldn't have insisted on moving the meeting to a day I couldn't be there.
Zoe, listen- - No, you listen.
this is my son's birthday, and I'm not about to waste this precious time hand-holding you or dan brooks through this deal.
I am just a little too busy playing laser tag.
you're on speaker!
Hi. - Zoe? Dan brooks.
I'm a bit confused, seeing as how it was your side that asked us to change the meeting.
I sure as hell didn't want to be here on a sunday.
what?
Dan, apparently there's been some sort of miscommunication.
Yeah, apparently, there was.
you know, so many people on all sides, Dan.
just too many opportunities to get wires crossed.
tear each other new ones on your own time.
is there nobody in this entire company that could clarify for me the debt structure?
we, as we've put forth- - someone other than you.
Dan, it's exactly like Mandelar.
Mandelar limited or Mandelar holding?
holding. Your '04 deal.
well, for crying out loud, why couldn't anybody at this table have told me that?
that's a good question, Dan.
when are you available, Zoe?
how about monday at 10: 00? - I'll see you then.
and, young man, for the love of god, take some of that $200 million and buy yourself a new pair of shoes.
Clayton, could you pick up for a sec? - Yeah, sure. Hold on.
Hey, zoe.
Clayton, I don't want to see you or Katherine within 50 feet of that conference room on monday.
I think that will be fine.
and be advised- I will do whatever I need to to defend myself, even if it means calling your wife.
Hey! - Hey. Everything okay?
great, actually. Hey!
mom, we won! We won! - That's awesome, honey!
Yeah, you got, like, the second highest score.
you don't suck at all. - Oh, thanks, sweetie.
okay, we gotta work a little on the manners.
Hey, that was amazingly high praise. I'm kinda jealous.
Aw. Well, you don't suck either.
all right, you little freakazoids. Who's up for round two?
come on!
okay, terrific.
a few more. That's great.
the stuff we got upstairs looks great, but, man, this light is perfect.
okay. Let's get you guys in the car.
take your time. We need to reset and reload.
I love it. They even have props.
well, if we were going on one of our romantic getaways, we'd have bags, right?
I mean, it is all about image.
okay, I had that coming.
you've been a good sport, and I want you to know how much I appreciate you.
tell me, Davis, six months from now, assuming the hedge fund turned around, would you have told me about Cilla?
Hey, can you guys go up and wrap the apartment?
honey, that'S...
how can I answer that? - With the truth.
I wanted to protect you. I always will.
do you want to drive? - I think you should.
in fact, I think I'm going to sit this one out.
what do you mean?
I'm just tired from all the posing we've been doing.
well, just sit. We can take a few with
of course, we've been posing for years, and it never bothered me.
honey, will you please just get in the car?
Davis, the bags behind you aren't props.
I filled them with your clothes this afternoon.
what? Why?
to take with you to the hotel where you'll be staying once you drive away from here.
Oh, come on.
I said I would do this for you, and I did.
I'm a woman of my word.
but that's it. We're done.
now if you want to avoid an embarrassing situation, and god knows I don't need any more humiliation in my life, you should just drive away.
how can you do this to me?
how can I do this to you? To you?
you lied to me. You betrayed me.
you jeopardized the security of our family, and you broke my heart
first in little ways, and then in big ones.
now some of those I can get past, but...
I can't trust you, Davis, and I never will again
not because I don't want to and not because I'm incapable of it...
but because you don't deserve it.
happy birthday, Luke. - Caitlin, yay!
you made it! - Hi. Mwah.
how was the shower? - It was great. It was... great.
so did you kick some major butt, or what? - Yes.
good.
Oh! Might be work. Sorry.
Hi. Hello? - Hi there, spray-on.
Sam.
uh, hi. Um, now is not actually a good time. Can I call you back?
sure. I just hope that means that y're really gonna call.
yeah course. - Sounds good. Bye.
who was that?
some guy... I know. - Guy?
no, not like that. Ju, uh, some guy... you-i met at the shower.
he wasn't a guest. He wasn't really at the shower.
he was cute, but he- he wasn't that cute.
I don't know why I gave him my number. I probably shouldn't have done that.
Zoe, I am the worst lesbian ever.
you need cake.
Jack, what are you doing here?
I'm still addicted to that coffee place on the corner.
you know, we really didn't get a chance to talk at Caleb's.
so? - So...
I wanted to tell you I know I was a jerk about how I ended ings.
Yeah, not exactly kid gloves.
I'm sorry. I messed up, and it really sucked to see you with that guy yesterday.
look, jack, you're seeing someone else, and I'm seeing someone else, and I'm not ready to let you off the hook for how you dumped me, if that's what you're after.
no. I don't expect that.
that's not what I want.
then what do you want?
I...
I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure it out.
well, I do. I want to move on with my life.
Mia, this is Liz.
Yeah, who knows?
I'll just have to have jack miss me a little bit first.
Jack, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
Oh, she's not my problem. Clayton's my problem.
I'm sorry. You made a decision on my behalf, layton.
and then you conveyed that to my client?
I'm pregnant.
how? - A donor.
my ex and I had been trying for a while.
how is it that Davis control over your finances?
there's nothing you can do about that until you get yourself a divorce attorney.
I can't have this conversation with you.
Juliet, it seems that Davis has already retained Mr. gropman.
are you okay?
Yes. Fantastic, why?
hold on.
Hello?
so what's the plan?
are you taking a sick day?
I went to work when I had double pneumonia attached to a rolling I. V. drip.
Mia Mason does not do sick days.
anyway, I'm not sick.
what is this? Hold on.
Hello?
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
Oh, my god.
what's happening?
is this like when your parents tell you they've taken your dog "out to the country"?
I got you your favorite muffin-- well, my favorite muffin.
I thought maybe it would do for you what it does for me.
I have to go. Okay, bye.
I assume you're up to speed on this.
Jack Cutting named publisher at Fairgate communications.
of course.
Jack's new job-- I am thrilled for him in fact.
I've got a chocolate-covered grenade route to him as we speak.
good.
you do realize this makes your ex-fiance your biggest headache if he wasn't already.
so the horse race between the two of you continues?
just show me I picked the right horse.
of course.
if I can give you one piece of advice for a divorce mediation, it's breathe.
nothing tells opposing counsel a wife is terrified like when her voice gets...
all high up in her head like this.
Blair, i was a debutante, my voice couldn't get high in my head if I sucked on a helium tank for a decade.
Davis, even though our marriage didn't work out,
I'm sure we both want to be as civil about this as possible.
we propose Mr. and Mrs. Draper each claim the money they have earned individually throughout the marriage and share joint custody of the minor child Emily with the apartment remaining Emily's and Mrs. draper's primary residence.
our proposal is this
in consideration of Mr. draper sacrificing the status and position he might have achieved in his own career, had he not supported the craven ambition of his wife to get ahead,
Mr. Draper will retain his earnings and be paid an additional monthly stipend.
you're kidding. He wants money?
as for the apartment, he'd like to be back in there next week.
what? He can't do that...
can he?
do you know where I've been living?
in a studio east of Lexington.
poor thing, Let's call jimmy carter and have him build you a shack.
you see? You see how she minimizes my feelings?
Davis, look, this is an emotional subject, - But I really hope we could keep that in heck - So you can walk all over me?
No!
where is this coming from?
Rafe has helped me see that you had just as much to do with this marriage failing as I did.
I am not gonna be the bad guy here.
Oh, really? What are you being now? The ingenue?
you stole money from our mutual account.
well, if it was mutual, he didn't steal.
you cheated on me. - And you cheated on me - Hardly - And you rubbed it in my face.
at least I had the decency to try to keep my affair a secret.
Yes, The first word that springs to mind when I think of your affair with Cilla is "decency.
clearly this discussion is over. You'll be hearing from us.
by all means, feel free to drag this out as much as you like, Blair.
as you'll see from our proposal, we expect Mrs. draper to cover legal fees.
this is good, They've shown their hand.
we've got 'em exactly where we want 'em.
Blair, your optimism seems somewhat divorced from reality.
what do you want me to tell you, we' screwed?
Henry Gorham wants to see us. - now?
Yes, now.
Henry... - Shut the door.
Maxwell Tate...is doing a bill gates humanitarian kind of thing and setting up a 500 million on foundation to charter schools
I thought he's parked at Manhattan trust.
Yeah. For now, but I let him outbid me on a case of 2000 chateau petrus.
and he's very grateful.
it's not easy to find a grateful billionaire.
he's coming in tomorrow afternoon and I'm trusting the two of you to reel him in. Get it right.
and we're in bed with him for all of his deals.
we're on it, Henry.
something like this, we should be thinking green and clean.
and I am the poster boy for socially responsible investing.
Oh, they have posters for that now?
all right. let's face facts
Max Tate is going to relate to me a lot more than he will to you
or we could actually meet him and see who he relates to.
Zoe, this guy is a man's man. He flies his own planes.
he sails in the America's cup race.
I know guys like this. - No you don't.
well, he's not gonna hand over $500 million for mommy to take care of.
what did you just call me? - All right.
that didn't come out right.
I can't believe that you would pull that crap all the work we've done together.
and this is the kind of deal that gets soon bumped up to senior managing director.
which deserve as much as you do. No, more.
do you know how many hours S. M. has to put in?
if you got that job, you could literally say goodbye to your kids until you see them at their wedding, maybe.
you have kids.
d a wife who doesn't work.
screw you, Clayton.
Zoe, don't get touchy. We are a team.
we are team.
I am only working out for you here.
then don't try and cut my legs off as I'm about to cross the finish line, okay?
Hey, who are you talking to?
you.
that's why I'm saying it.
I sent Jack champagne-- very expensive champagne.
that should send him the message.
which is what, congratulations?
no, that I'm not thinking about him, 'cause if I were thinking about him, I would have sent him scotch.
so he's a publisher, so the message is, "I don't care.
no, you don't care.
right. I don't care.
Oh, why'd you bring this up?
I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted.
my girlfriend is pregnant.
my girlfriend is pregnant.
it just doesn't sound any better the more I say it.
you say.
your girlfriend is pregnant.
no, That still sounds crazy. Yeah.
I mean, what do I do? Do I stay with her?
what does that make me-- other mommy?
mommy two?
bitch!
later tonight, our exclusive report...
I think I prefer "mommy two.
see why these policemen are in custody tonight.
we have it all captured on an eyewitness' cell phone camera.
tune to "New York news" with me--Liz Morin.
well, don't pause it. I wanna see the footage.
that is Jack's new girlfriend, and she's wearing my Alexander Mcqueen scarf.
so she got the same scarf... - No. that's my scarf.
I must've left it at jack's. - Are you sure?
she found my scarf, and she wore it on TV.
that is so aggressive.
she's obviously sending you a message via Mcqueen.
enjoy it, lady, 'cause I'm getting it back.
the scarf...
or the boyfriend?
thank you.
is someone moving out?
I thought it was you. - what?
uh, have you gone insane? You can't take everything!
I haven't-- just the things I wanted.
I think it'll make my place feel more like home.
my Aston Martin? - My Aston Martin, I paid for it.
you gave it to me as a present.
it's a little late to be getting sentimental.
that's everything.
I thought we could have a civilized divorce.
and I thought we could have a civilized marriage.
looks like we were both wrong.
Oh, my dear. - Thank you Mrs Albert.
that's just not how we do things on 5th avenue.
how bad is it?
Denise Richards/ Charlie sheen bad?
it's like someone's using my stomach as a trampoline.
what are you gonna do?
my lawyer says she's guiding evidence so we can kick him in the balls, which, unfortunately, is her favorite expression, and, I imagine, activity.
I've never seen Davis like this.
I feel like the lawyers are making everything worse
Zoe, never get divorced, you two, never get married.
no I won't.
we're having a jack flashback.
a jack-back.
please tell me you've moved on.
I would just like somebody at this table to have moved on.
I-I thought you were dating that doctor. - And there's my nanny.
you made out with my nanny in my foyer where my children play with their toys.
excuse me. I had one make-out session with a nanny and a couple of dates between brain surgeries.
Jack and I were engaged, okay?
I thought the thing you get when you break up with someone is you don't have to deal with them any more
it's like they're dead, but they have the advantage of being not dead, but everywhere I turned there's another Jack pop-up
in the trades, from my boss, on TV.
maybe this is the universe telling me that things aren't over between us.
please don't go by the universe.
every time I have done that, I've ended up in a strange apartment hunting for my thong.
Oh, god.
well, I still have to call him and get my sex tape back.
hmm?
Yes, I made a sex tape, and, no, it was not tasteful.
it's dating etiquette 101.
in the event of a breakup, the girl gets all pornographic materials.
it's breakup law.
dear, go I hope davis didn't take our sex tape.
you, too?
does everyone at this table have a sex tape but me?
Mm-hmm. - Yeah.
Eric and I made one, but we recorded over it.
now it's a birth tape, which we don't watch, either.
Davis and I were on vacation in Greece on a boat with another couple.
you made a sex tape with another couple?
and I wouldn't call it sex.
we groped each other and ate some feta, and I made sure I was always wearing sunglasses.
Alicia, this is gonna be a little cold.
okay, so there is the uterus, the anmiotic sac...
do you, by any chance, see a tahitian pearl earring in there?
cause I lost one recently.
the beating heart of the baby.
wow, That's amazing.
there.
you can see it.
it's the blinking spot.
wow, That is amazing.
excuse me, We're in the middle of an examination here.
I know. - Olivia
my ex-- the one I was trying to get pregnant with.
you must be Caitlin.
I-I didn't mean for this to be so awkward.
it wouldn't have been if we'd known you were coming.
Alicia told me about the appointment.
I didn't think you'd want to be here.
why wouldn't I? it's my baby, too.
the baby looks healthy, in case anyone wondering I was surprised to hear from you and happy-- surprised and happy.
so how are things with your doctor friend?
Oh, the brain surgeon who saves people's lives? We're great.
what about your teleprompter?
Ah, my anchorwoman and I are doing well.
thank you. - Great
I'd like my scarf back, please.
what? - My scarf?
I left it in your apartment, and she must have found it and thought it would be entertaining for me to see her wear it on TV.
wow, She is feisty.
I'd like it back. It's special to me.
I don't want it drenched in all her feisty neck sweat.
and there's also, the, um, matter of our sex tape. I'd like that back too.
Oh.
the sex tape? - Yeah.
Yeah, you can have that back.
I just don't know where it is.
you lost our sex tape?
no, You hid our sex tape, remember?
you didn't want the cleaning lady to find it.
Oh, right. Of course.
well, I was thinking ahead...
though I didn't...
think ahead to this conversation.
I didn't either.
well, this isn't fun.
uh, you can go by tomorrow afternoon to get it, if you still have your keys.
okay, great, thanks.
well, good.
good.
it's nice to see you, though I'd love it if we cod figure out a way to spend time together without it being so weird.
I'd like that , too.
but I-I han't gotten there yet.
well, when you do, you have my number and my address, and...
you have a key.
since you're planning on chartering schools with this foundation, I assume you're gonna go S. R.I. here?
Yes, we feel very strongly.
it's going to be transparently funded, so it has to be socially responsible.
we are completely on the same page, cynthia.
same sentence on that page.
There'no money in that.
well, there's less. That's true.
actually, max, I feel we can get you the same return that you have grown accustomed to.
Oh, well, personally, I'm fond of double digits.
so are we.
Max we want to be careful that we don't run into the Warren Buffett thing, where his investments ran counter to philanthropy
well, cynthia and I are going to talk to other people.
although it is refreshing to have a woman pitch for a change.
and as a mother, this is an area that's very close to my heart.
Yeah, yeah. We are all parents.
so, max, how do we move this ball the court?
what are your plans while you're in town?
we'd love to set up a wine dinner for you at Cru.
I understand from henry, you're quite the connoisseur.
well... we have tickets to the opera.
Oh. Right.
go on. Have your dinner.
I'll take Bianca to the opera. She'll appreciate it.
I love you.
don't you need to check with your husband to see if you can shake free?
she has small children.
Clayton is always looking out for my kids.
I'd love to hear about sailing the America's cup.
uh, I was on the "sui-64.
Zoe, I know how difficult it is for women to rise in this field, mothers especially.
Oh, the stories I could tell, but to work with a woman of your stature on something as meaningful as this-- I just--I would love it.
that's what I like about women. They talk to each other.
if this moves forward, I will need someone to talk to.
me, too.
thanks for coming with me.
I did not want to do this alone.
I did not want to do this at all.
I wish that when a relationship ended, that all personal items you left behind would just spontaneously combust.
Oh, this is it.
no DVD, but I did find staples, which I'm taking.
you know what?
I think I left it behind the TV cabinet.
okay.
I feel something. -Me too.
I got it.
this one says "Mia.
so does this one.
what, did you make two sex tapes?
all we ever needed was the one.
it was a good tape.
okay, let's see...
think he could have taped you secretly without you knowing?
I don't know. He's not that mechanical.
I had to set the time on his microwave for him.
okay, shield your eyes.
shielded.
holy crap. Are those your abs? - This is the sex tape
Yeah, we made this right after I had the stomach flu.
okay, let's see what thione is.
happy birthday to you...
happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Mia.
I got your favorite buttercream cupcake even though they are sold out and I had to wait for them to make one happy birthday to you.
so he's not completely heartless.
I want to make a wish.
no, he's not.
it's jack. He knew I was coming.
what, do you want me to leave? - yes!
get... get.
just get.
well... - No.
I had to see it for myself.
excuse me?
Oh, this what you were looking for?
thanks for letting me borrow it.
I got a lot of compliments on it.
don't you have any clothes of your own?
I really don't wear much when I'm here.
could you not talk much when you're here?
I don't even know how you can without a teleprompter.
you know what I did the last time a man broke up with me?
nothing.
I got a new one. Why don't you try that?
Liz, I know that you came here to show me that this is your territory now, but the fact that you had to make an appearance when you knew I'd here proves that it's not.
Oh, you just can't handle that jack's moved on.
and you just can't admit that you're the rebound girl.
enjoy the bounce.
legal says there's still some holdup with the city council on the dumais project.
there's an explanation for that - I don't want an explanation.
I want a solution. We are on a ticking clock here.
yes?
Juliet, um...
what? Spit it out.
it's your husband.
Oh, what about him? What did he do now?
he had a heart attack.
Davis draper-- he's my husband.
he's had a heart attack.
he's still in the emergency room.
Cilla - I don't know what's taking so long.
they said he should be in his room by now.
what are you doing here?
I was with him at the time.
he was...
enthusiastic, and suddenly he got very pale and very sweaty, - and he started having trouble breathing... - that's very descriptive.
well, I called my ex-husband's cardiologist.
he is the top guy in the city.
I don't understand. Am I supposed to thank you?
you could..
Oh, here's the doctor.
Dr. Byrne, this is davis' wife - Julia draper - How is he?
well, we're still running tests.
it'll be a few hours before I can say for sure, but he's stabilized now.
can I see him?
in a little bit. He's, uh, still a little bit out of it.
uh, I'm not sure you should-- - oh, of course not.
I-I just wanted to sure he was okay.
we'll take it from here. - Thank you dr. byrne.
I'm not interested in your empty apologies.
I'm not making one.
I just wanted to say
and I wish someone had told me this the first time I got divorced
it's actually a very liberating experience.
I'm sure there are parts of you that have gotten buried or lost in this marriage.
you get all that back...
plus the summer house.
and don't let anyone tell you women our age can't find a man.
they're everywhere.
they're with their wives.
wait till you're on the other side, honey.
really, I think you're gonna like it over here.
hello. - hi - Can I get a shot of your best tequila? - oh me too.
so...
I think this was a good idea
us hanging out, getting to know each other, being as we're gonna be family and all.
I'll be honest with you, caitlin.
I don't really like the idea of my child being raised by someone with so many...
sexual identity issues.
excuse me?
well, first you're straight, and then you're gay, and then you're bi.
and now I'm getting drunk.
excuse me, Can I get another one?
this is my baby, and you just don't seem like much of a role model.
how do you know so much about me? Did Alicia tell you that?
here's another thing-- I hope you don't plan on having this kid call you "mommy.
this family's topping out at two mommies.
listen
you have no genetic relation to this child, and neither do I.
the only one who does is Alicia, so maybe we should be letting her make some of the calls.
you've got a lot to learn about lesbians.
Hey. - hey.
how's it going?
you two hitting it off?
please say yes. I really want this to work.
Oh, yes.
we are totally hitting it off.
we could not be hitting it off more.
unless we had actual clubs to hit it off with.
you're here.
were you expecting cilla?
you saw her?
of course I saw her.
she brought her husband's cardiologist. I guess she's a health risk.
I just started seeing her again.
I don't care about that.
I'm just glad you're talking. I'm terrified.
you were?
of course I was.
I don't think that's ever gonna go away, unfortunately.
I'm really sorry.
cleaning out the apartment, taking the car...
I haven't been handling myself well.
no, you haven't.
but I appreciate you saying that.
just now when I saw you sitting there, I just felt so relieved. I...
I don't know why but see you makes me think that everything's gonna be okay.
it is, You're gonna okay.
I want you to have the apartment.
I-I'm gonna bring back all the things that I took out of it.
Oh, we can talk about that later.
no, I made up my mind. I want you to have it.
Mr. Draper?
good news.
you did not suffer a heart attack.
Oh, thank god.
but I-I had--I had all the symptoms.
we, apparently, what you had is a panic attack.
it very often mimics a heart attack
chest pains, tingling, shortness of breath, nausea.
the echo shows your heart is fine, working perfectly.
blood work is good...
I am prescribing an anti-anxiety medication and...
a good psychiatrist.
let me finalize a few things, have you sleeping in your own bed tonight.
wherever that is.
you're kidding me.
a hostess club with geisha girls?
it's very exclusive, very discreet
sexy, servile women waiting on bended knee to meet all of Max's needs.
so basically a glorified whorehouse.
Yeah, emphasis on the "glorified.
how do we know this is something that he would even want?
he'll want it. Every guy want it your strategy's so old school , first you oversell the product.
now this boys' night out? I mean...
if you don't like it, don't come.
and quit trying to find a way to cut me out of the deal...
or at least be a little more original about it.
tell Bennett I need his recommendations on the maintenance contracts right away, and would you get my husband on the phone?
I guess I can't keep calling him that.
is he okay?
he's fine. In fact he's better.
he's realized life's too short to go on hurting each other.
that's good to hear.
Juliet Draper? - Yeah?
you've been served. - With what?
Lester, I've got my own money invested in the thing.
that's how much I believe in it.
I promised a 20% return, and I am still promising that.
perfect. Every time I see you, you're making meaningless promises.
uh, lester, I'll call you back.
a letter to vacate the apartment?
your lawyer is claiming I gave it to you.
you did.
I think we can agree it was under highly charged circumstances.
you gave such a convincing portrayal of a human being last night.
I can't believe I fell for it.
if you want to go there, we can talk about your bedside vigil.
what about it?
why the sudden wifely concern?
my lawyer says you were taking advantage of my weakened state to see what you could get out of me.
tell your lawyers I tried for 15 years to get something out of you, and I finally realized there's nothing there.
why can't it just be simple?
why can't it be I meet someone, I fall in love? ca't it just be that?
why do it have to be I meet somebody, I fall in love, she's pregnant.
am I ready to be a parent? which I would have to do with this other parent who already hates me and my doppelganger?
I didn't think she was that pretty.
I really need to figure out if I can do this.
Oh, have you ever seen anything so cute?
Oh! This a cute item.
I'm gonna get it for the baby.
maybe you should hold off.
this isn't gonna help you figure out whether you want to be a parent... or not.
so cute.
or maybe it will.
I was in Kyoto in '97-- no, '98
hit a place like this, only dark.
almost creepy.
the women could feed you.
they would do things to you, but you did not see a damn thing.
it's probably better that way.
that's a good point.
may I?
eh, what the hell?
I have to say I like the gorham sutter way of doing business
a little entertainment here, a lot of money there.
Max, about that rate of return that we were discussing-- - discuss later.
I don't believe in hype and false promises. That's not how I do business.
but I do think if we do this thing responsibly, we could be looking at some matching contributions.
you know what? My wife loves you. - Really?
and she would love everything you're saying.
well, I-I think she's great.
let's really do dinner one night.
I'd love that. - good.
Hey, I was thinking-- I mean, just off the bat, tell me what you think.
you could launch an initiative to rebuild the schools damaged by the fires in California.
I don't know what do you think?
there you go again.
that is exactly what cynthia wants.
Zoe, you sold me. - Really?
consider it a done deal. - Max!
that's--that's so wonderful!
Hey, we should celebrate!
let's have some champagne.
the women of this establishment are available for private socializing in his apartments above the bar.
isn't that right?
uh, come on, Clayton, I think it's exciting enough.
buzz kill, mommy.
well, it is a long opera. -Yeah.
and you--you got the foot thing going.
right.
it's Cynthia.
Hi, honey.
how's the opera?
it's done?
Oh!
uh, the meal? yeah, yeah.
the--the wine was spectacular.
uh, no.
no, we're still here you're on your way over?
to the restaurant?
um...
uh, oh, wait, Zoe wants to say something to yo no, no, no, no. I just -- I'm really not really good with ...
uh, she'll--she'll be right here. Hold on just a second.
no, I--- Zoe!
Cynthia, hi!
how was the opera?
Yeah, gosh, I wish we'd known that you were joining us.
we're just--we're about to get in the car, and I told my husband that i was already on my way home so, Yeah.
absolutely, another time.
Bye.
you're a lifesaver. Okay, honey.
sorry, I'll see you at home, okay? bye.
we got ten minutes? - Absolutely - Okay. - What?
who is it?
it's Jack.
one second!
Hi.
Hi.
uh, your birthday DVD.
you left it at my place.
un, thanks, You could have just messengered it.
I know.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
this is great.
it's better than great. it's amazing.
well, what are we doing?
don't you have a girlfriend wondering where you are right now?
don't you have a boyfriend?
well, he's a guy I'm dating.
he doesn't have personal hygiene products in my bathroom.
well...
I was just trying to get over you.
obviously, I didn't. -hm-hmm
so what are you saying?
well...
I made a huge mistake...
and I want to start over.
Hi, I'm jack.
can I buy you a drink?
please tell me you have a better line.
everything's gonna be different this time.
how?
because everything has changed. - what do you mean?
you have your job, and now I have mine.
wait a minute, Are you here now because...
you got a good job?
no.
well, 'cause that's what it sounds like-- like...
you see me on some leve, and if you're not on that level or above, then you can't be with me.
you're reading too much into it.
where are you going?
come back here. - I can't
that's the whole point. I can't come back.
we were engaged. we were gonna get married, and then
and then I got a promotion, and--and you gave me a bottle of booze and then walked off into the night.
you're never gonna get over that, are you? - No, I'm not, are you?
Yes, That's why I'm here.
no, you are here now because you feel good about yourself.
but what if that changes?
life is full of ups and downs.
I can't be with somebody whose
whose--whose feelings depend on what their resume says.
Mia, come here. Come here.
no.
I kept this because I was hoping that you would change your mind.
but now I've changed mine.
Hi! - Hi!
something really exciting happened.
what? - I became a mommy!
I mean, not--no, not the way you're becoming a mommy.
um, although I realize that may be the most conventional way, it's Not the only way.
it happened to me when I was outside this baby store.
Oh, my god. Look at that how cute is that?
very cute. -Oh my god, check this out.
I couldn't decide between the sheep and the ladybug towels, so I got 'em both.
if he's a boy, he could still use a ladybug towel, right?
uh, caitlin, there's something I need to tell you. - Okay hang on, just let me finish.
it all happened when I saw this photo album.
family photos.
we're gonna be a family, and I'm gonna be in it, and i'm gonna help you raise a child!
Caitlin, you really need to listen to me.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I've seen that look before.
this is really difficult.
no, it's not.
no, you have the easy part.
I have to stand here and listen to things I don't think I really want to hear.
look, Olivia and I had always planned to have a baby together.
she's the one who broke up with me.
I mean, meeting you was a surprise, and it was wonderful.
Yeah, but not as wonderful as olivia coming back, right?
I didn't know this was gonna happen.
you know, I was prepared to change my whole life for you.
and all the time, I was just back up.
you can keep all this.
all this stuff is for you.
except this.
this is for me.
what the hell are you doing?
this car was reported stolen.
that's ridiculous, this is my car If--if anyone's stealing it, it's you.
the car is registered to a Juliet Draper.
okay, don't--don't you get it? That's my wife.
okay, we're getting divorced.
this--this is just some-- just some kind of sick game!
she's using you!
she's using you!
Hey! - Careful, Davis. You don't wanna have a heart attack.
Hey, put it down! - Thank you. We can go now.
what's going on?
Gorham just named clayton senior managing director.
what? - yeah
I didn't think you'd want any champagne.
I need to speak to you. - Did you hear, it's official.
the Tates gave us their foundation. Up top!
apparently, Gorham thinks you're responsible for that. Do you feel comfortable taking that credit?
I don't think the promotion is based on this one deal.
it's about my entire body of work. - Shut up Clayton.
just shut up!
great work, you two. Great work. -Thank you.
and you, party girl...
party"?
girl"?
Henry, I really need to talk to you about this.
I'm listening.
okay.
forgets one deal... which I made happened.
I have generated more business for Gorham Sutter than anyone else, and yet the only people who get promoted around here are men
white men, to be blunt.
I don't like what you're insinuating.
I'm not insinuating anything, henry.
I am saying it straight out.
it doesn't matter to you, does it, that I have given everything to this firm, - including my integrity. - Integrity? c'mon
this is wall street.
and as far as a promotion goes, well, you know that that is a...
tricky process.
your time will come.
Oh, I know it will, henry.
it just won't come here.
well, not if you keep up like this.
don't worry. I'm not going to.
I quit.
I think I will have that champagne now.
sometimes the only thing that works is fudge.
and vodka.
vodka and fue.
my mother would be so proud.
so is anybody free for breakfast tomorrow?
lunch? a movie? My day's wide open.
does anyone want to watch me throw a shredder out a window?
anyone want to watch me throw Cilla out a window? -That I wanna see.
you know what?
Mia, this is Liz.
Yeah, who knows?
I'll just have to have jack miss me a little bit first.
Jack, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
Oh, she's not my problem. Clayton's my problem.
I'm sorry
you made a decision on my behalf
and then you conveyed that to my client
I'm pregnant
how
a donor
my ex and I had been trying for a while
how is it that Davis has control over your finances
there's nothing you can do about that until you get yourself a divorce attorney
I can't have this conversation with you
hello
are you okay
Yes. Fantastic
why
hold on
hello
so what's the plan
are you taking a sick day
I went to work when I had double pneumonia attached to a rolling I. V. drip
Mia Mason does not do sick days
anyway, I'm not sick
what is this? Hold on.
hello
I just want you to know that I'm here for you
Oh my god
what's happening
is this like when your parents tell you they've taken your dog "out to the country
I got you your favorite muffin my favorite muffin
I thought maybe it would do for you what it does for me
I have to go
okay. Bye
I assume you're up to speed on this
of course
Jack's new job
I am thrilled for him
in fact
I've got a chocolate-covered grenade route to him as we speak
good
you do realize this makes your ex-fianc ...
so the horse race between the two of you continues
just show me I picked the right horse
of course
if I can give you one piece of advice for a divorce mediation
it's breathe
nothing tells opposing counsel a wife is terrified like when her voice gets all high up in her head like this
I was a debutante
my voice couldn't get high in my head if i sucked on a helium tank for a decade even though our marriage didn't work out
I'm sure we both want to be as civil about this as possible
we propose Mr. And Mrs. Draper each claim the money they've earned individually throughout the marriage and share joint custody of the minor child emily with the apartment remaining emily's and Mrs. Draper's primary residence
our proposal is this
in consideration of Mr. Draper sacrificing the status and position he might have achieved in his own career had he not supported the craven ambition of his wife to get ahead
Mr. Draper will retain his earnings and be paid an additional monthly stipend
you're kidding. He wants man-imony
as for the apartment he'd like to be back in there next week
what
he can't do that...
can he
do you know where i've been living
in a studio east of lexington
poor thing
let's call Jimmy Carter and have him build you a shack
do you see
you see how she minimizes my feelings, this is an emotional subject but I really hope we could keep that in check so you can walk all over me
no
where is this coming from
Rafe has helped me see that you had just as much to do with this marriage failing as I did
I am not gonna be the bad guy here
Oh, really? What are you being now
the ingenue
you stole money from our mutual account
well, if it was mutual, he didn't steal
you cheated on me
and you cheated on me
hardly
and you rubbed it in my face
at least I had the decency to try to keep my affair a secret
yes
the first word that springs to mind when i think of your affair with cilla is "decency " clearly this discussion is over You'll be hearing from us
by all means, feel free to drag this out as much as you like, Blair
as you'll see from our proposal we expect Mrs. Draper to cover our legal fees
this is good
they've shown their hand
we've got 'em exactly where we want 'em your optimism seems somewhat divorced from reality
what do you want me to tell you we' screwed
Henry gorham wants to see us
now
Yes, now
shut the door
is doing a Bill Gates humanitarian kind of thing and setting up a $500 million foundation to charter schools
I thought he's parked at Manhattan trust
yeah
and he's very grateful
it's not easy to find a grateful billionaire
he's coming in tomorrow afternoon and I'm trusting the two of you to reel him in
get it right and we're in bed with him for all of his deals
we're on it, Henry
something like this we should be thinking green and clean
and I am the poster boy for socially responsible investing
Oh, they have posters for that now
all right
let's face facts-- Max Tate
is going to relate to me a lot more than he will to you
or we could actually meet him and see who he relates to
Zoe, this guy is a man's man
he flies his own planes
he sails in the America's cup race
I know guys like this
no, you don't
well, he's not gonna hand over $500 million for mommy to take care of
what did you just call me
a-all right. That didn't come out right
I can't believe that you would pull that crap after all the work we've done together
and this is the kind of deal that gets someone bumped up to senior managing director
which I deserve as much as you do. No
more
do you know how many hours an S. M.D. has to put in
if you got that job you could literally say good-bye to your kids until you see them at their weddings...
maybe
you have kids
and a wife who doesn't work
screw you, Clayton
Zoe, don't get touchy
we're a team
we are a team
I am only looking out for you here
then don't try and cut my legs off as I'm about to cross the finish line, okay
Hey, who are you talking to
that's why I'm saying it
I sent jack champagne very expensive champagne
that should send him the message
which is what, congratulations
no, that I'm not thinking about him 'cause if i were thinking about him I would have sent him scotch
so he's a publisher now so the message is, "I don't care no, you don't care
right. I don't care
Oh, why'd you bring this up
I'm sorry
I'm a little distracted
my girlfriend is pregnant
my girlfriend is pregnant
it just doesn't sound any better the more I say it
you say it
your girlfriend is pregnant
no. That still sounds crazy. Yeah
I mean, what do I do? Do I stay with her
what does that make me other mommy
mommy two
bitch. Later tonight, our exclusive report... -----I think I prefer "mommy two
see why these policemen are in custody tonight
we have it all captured on an eyewitness' cell phone camera
tune in to "new york news" with me--Liz Morin
well, don't pause it. I wanna see the footage
that is jack's new girlfriend and she's wearing my Alexander Mcqueen scarf
so she got the same scarf...
no
that is my scarf
I must've left it at Jack's
are you sure
she found my scarf and she wore it on TV
that is so aggressive
she's obviously sending you a message via Mcqueen
enjoy it, lady. 'cause i'm getting it back
the scarf...
or the boyfriend
thank you
is someone moving out
I thought it was you
what
uh, have you gone insane
you can't take everything
I haven't-- just the things I wanted
I think it'll make my place feel more like home
my Aston Martin
my Aston Martin. I paid for it
you gave it to me as a present
it's a little late to be getting sentimental
that's everything
I thought we could have a civilized divorce
and I thought we could have a civilized marriage
looks like we were both wrong
Oh, my dear
thank you. Mrs. Albert
that's just not how we do things on 5th avenue how bad is it
Denise Richards Charlie sheen bad
it's like someone's using my stomach as a trampoline
what are you gonna do
my lawyer says she's building evidence so we can kick him in the balls which unfortunately is her favorite expression and I imagine, activity
I've never seen Davis like this
I feel like the lawyers are making everything worse, Zoe never get divorced and you two, never get married ----Oh, I won't
we're having a jack flashback a jack-back. Please tell me you've moved on
I would just like somebody at this table to have moved on
I...I thought you were dating that doctor
and there's my nanny
you made out with my nanny in my foyer where my children play with their toys
excuse me
I had one make-out session with a nanny and a couple of dates between brain surgeries.
Jack and I were engaged, okay
I thought the thing you get when you break up with someone is you don't have to deal with them anymore
it's like they're dead but they have the advantage of being not dead but everywhere I turn there's another "jack pop-up
in the trades from my boss on TV
maybe this is the universe telling me that things aren't over between us
please don't go by the universe
every time I have done that
I've ended up in a strange apartment hunting for my thong
Oh, god
well, I still have to call him and get my sex tape back
Yes, I made a sex tape and, no, it was not tasteful
it's dating etiquette 101.
in the event of a breakup the girl gets all pornographic materials
it's breakup law
dear, go I hope Davis didn't take our sex tape
you, too
does everyone at this table have a sex tape but me
MM-HMM... Yeah
Eric and I made one but we recorded over it
now it's a birth tape which we don't watch, either
Davis and I were on vacation in Greece on a boat with another couple
you made a sex tape with another couple
and i wouldn't call it sex
we groped each other and ate some feta and i made sure i was always wearing sunglasses
Alicia, this is gonna be a little cold
okay, so there is the uterus the amniotic sac...
do you by any chance see a Tahitian pearl earring in there 'Cause I lost one recently
the beating heart of the baby
Wow. That's amazing
there
you can see it
it's the blinking spot
Wow. That is amazing
excuse me
we're in the middle of an examination here
I know
my ex the one i was trying to get pregnant with
you must be Caitlin
I...I didn't mean for this to be so awkward
it wouldn't have been if we'd known you were coming
Alicia told me about the appointment
I didn't think you'd want to be here
why wouldn't I
it's my baby, too
the baby looks healthy in case anyone wondering
I was surprised to hear from you...
and happy-- surprised and happy
so how are things with your doctor friend
Oh, the brain surgeon who saves people's lives
we're great
what about your telepromptress
Ah, my anchorwoman and I are doing well
thank you
great
I'd like my scarf back, please
what
my scarf
I left it at your apartment and she must have found it and thought it would be entertaining for me to see her wear it on TV.
wow
she is feisty
well, I'd like it back
it's special to me
I don't want it drenched in all her feisty neck sweat
and there's also, the um, matter of our sex tape
I'd like that back, too
the sex tape
yeah
Yeah, you can have that back
I just don't know where it is
you lost our sex tape
no You hid our sex tape, remember
you didn't want the cleaning lady to find it
Oh, right
of course
well, I was thinking ahead...
though I didn't...
think ahead to this conversation
I didn't either
well, this isn't fun
uh, you can go by tomorrow afternoon and get it if you still have your keys
okay, great
thanks
well, good
good
it's nice to see you though I'd love it if we could figure out a way to spend time together without it being so weird
I'd like that too but I---I haven't gotten there yet
well, when you do you have my number and my address and...
you have a key
since you're planning on chartering schools with this foundation
I assume you're gonna wanna go S.R.I. here
Yes, we feel very strongly
it's going to be transparently funded so it has to be socially responsible
we are completely on the same page, Cynthia
same sentence on that page
there's no money in that
well, there's less. That's true
actually, Max
I feel we can get you the same return that you have grown accustomed to
Oh, well, personally I'm fond of double digits
so are we want to be careful that we don't run into the Warren Buffett thing where his investments ran counter to his philanthropy
well, Cynthia and I are going to talk to other people
although it is refreshing to have a woman pitch for a change
and as a mother, this is an area that's very close to my heart
Yeah, yeah. We are all parents
so, Max, how do we move this ball up the court
what are your plans while you're in town
we'd love to set up a wine dinner for you at cru
I understand from Henry you're quite the connoisseur
well...
we have tickets to the opera
Oh
right, go on
have your dinner
I'll take Bianca to the opera
she'll appreciate it
Mwah. I love you
don't you need to check with your husband to see if you can shake free
she has small children
Clayton is always looking out for my kids
I'd love to hear about sailing in the America's cup
uh, I was on the "sui-64
Zoe, I know how difficult it is for women to rise in this field, mothers especially
Oh the stories I could tell but to work with a woman of your stature on something as meaningful as this
I just--i would love it
that's what i like about women They talk to each other and if this moves forward I will need someone to talk to
me too
thanks for coming with me
I did not want to do this alone
I did not want to do this at all
I wish that when a relationship ended that all personal items you left behind would just spontaneously combust
Oh, this is it
no DVD, but I did find staples which I'm taking
you know what
I think I left it behind the TV cabinet
okay
I feel something
me too
I got it
this one says "Mia
so does this one
what did you make two sex tapes
all we ever needed was the one
it was a good tape
okay, let's see...
think he could have taped you secretly without you knowing
I don't know
he's not that mechanical
I had to set the time on his microwave for him
okay, shield your eyes
shielded
holy crap
are those your abs
this is the sex tape
Yeah, we made this right after i had the stomach flu
okay, let's see what thione is happy birthday to you...
happy birthday to you, happy birthday to dear mia
I got you your favorite buttercream cupcake even though they were sold out and I had to wait for them to make one happy birthday to you so he's not completely heartless I want to make a wish
no, he's not
it's jack he knew I was coming ---- What, do you want me to leave ----- Yes
what get---get, Just get
well...
no
I had to see it for myself
excuse me
Oh, this what you were looking for
thanks for letting me borrow it
I got a lot of compliments on it
don't you have any clothes of your own
I really don't wear much when I'm here
could you not talk much when you're here
I don't even know how you can without a teleprompter
you know what I did the last time a man broke up with me
nothing
I got a new one
why don't you try that
Liz, I know that you came here to show me that this is your territory now but the fact that you had to make an appearance when you knew I'd be here proves that it's not
Oh, you just can't handle that jack's moved on
and you just can't admit that you're the rebound girl
enjoy the bounce.
legal says there's still some holdup with the city council on the dumais project.
there's an explanation for that
I don't want an explanation.
I want a solution.
we're on a ticking clock here.
yes?
Juliet, um...
what? Spit it out.
it's your husband.
Oh, what about him?
what did he do now?
he had a heart attack.
Davis draper-- he's my husband.
he's had a heart attack.
he's still in the emergency room.
I don't know what's taking so long.
they said he should be in his room by now.
what are you doing here?
I was with him at the time.
he was...
enthusiastic, and suddenly he got very pale and very sweaty, and he started having trouble breathing
that's very descriptive.
well, I called my ex-husband's cardiologist.
he is the top guy in the city.
I don't understand.
am i supposed to thank you?
you could.
Oh, here's the doctor.
Dr. Byrne, this is davis' wife, Juliet Draper.
how is he?
well, we're still running tests.
it'll be a few hours before i can say for sure, but he's stabilized now.
can i see him?
in a little bit.
he's, uh, still a little bit out of it.
uh, I'm not sure you should
Oh, of course not.
I-I just wanted to make sure he was okay.
we'll take it from here.
thank you, dr. Byrne.
I'm not interested in your empty apologies.
I'm not making one.
I just wanted to say
and I wish someone had told me this the first time I got divorced
it's actually a very liberating experience.
I'm sure there are parts of you that have gotten buried or lost in this marriage.
you get all that back...
plus the summer house.
and don't let anyone tell you women our age can't find a man.
they're everywhere.
they're with their wives.
wait till you're on the other side, honey.
really, i think you're gonna like it over here.
hello. - Hi.
can i get a shot of your best tequila?
Oh, me, too.
so...
I think this was a good idea
us hanging out, getting to know each other, being as we're gonna be family and all.
I'll be honest with you, Caitlin.
I don't really like the idea of my child being raised by someone with so many...
sexual identity issues.
excuse me?
well, first you're straight, and then you're gay, and then you're bi.
and now i'm getting drunk.
excuse me. Can i get another one?
this is my baby, and you just don't seem like much of a role model.
how do you know so much about me?
did Alicia tell you that?
here's another thing-- I hope you don't plan on having this kid call you "mommy.
this family's topping out at two mommies.
listen, you have no genetic relation to this child, and neither do i.
the only one who does is Alicia, so maybe we should be letting her make some of the calls.
you've got a lot to learn about lesbians.
Hey.
Hey.
how's it going?
you two hitting it off?
please say yes.
I really want this to work.
Oh, yes.
we are totally hitting it off.
we could not be hitting it off more.
unless we had actual clubs to hit it off with.
Dr. Phelps, 4-7-2-1.
Dr. Phelps, 4-7-2-1.
nurse cooper to admitting.
nurse cooper to admitting.
you're here.
were you expecting Cilla?
you saw her?
of course I saw her.
she brought her husband's cardiologist.
I guess she's a health risk.
I just started seeing her again.
I don't care about that.
I'm just glad you're talking.
I was terrified.
you were?
of course I was.
I don't think that's ever gonna go away, unfortunately.
I'm really sorry.
cleaning out the apartment, taking the car...
I haven't been handling myself well.
no, you haven't.
but I appreciate you saying that.
just now when i saw you sitting there, i just felt so relieved.
I...I don't know why, but see you makes me think that everything's gonna be okay.
it is. You're gonna be okay.
I want you to have the apartment.
I-I'm gonna bring back all the things that i took out of it.
Oh, we can talk about that later.
no, I made up my mind.
I want you to have it.
Mr. Draper?
good news.
you did not suffer a heart attack.
Oh, thank god.
but i-i had--i had all the symptoms.
well, apparently, what you had is a panic attack.
it very often mimics a heart attack-- chest pains, tingling, shortness of breath, nausea.
the echo shows your heart is fine, working perfectly.
blood work is good...
I am prescribing an anti-anxiety medication and...
a good psychiatrist.
let me finalize a few things, have you sleeping in your own bed tonight.
wherever that is.
you're kidding me.
a hostess club with geisha girls?
it's very exclusive, very discreet-- sexy, servile women waiting on bended knee to meet all of max's needs.
so basically a glorified whorehouse.
Yeah, emphasis on the "glorified.
how do we know this is something that he would even want?
he'll want it.
now this boys' night out? I mean...
if you don't like it, don't come.
and quit trying to find a way to cut me out of the deal...
or at least be a little more original about it.
tell Bennett I need his recommendations on the maintenance contracts right away, and, uh, would you get my husband on the phone?
I guess I can't keep calling him that.
is he okay?
he's fine.
in fact, he's better.
he's realized life's too short to go on hurting each other.
that's good to hear.
yes?
you've been served.
with what?
Lester, I've got my own money invested in the thing.
that's how much i believe in it.
I promised a 20% return, and i am promising that.
perfect.
every time i see you, you're making meaningless promises.
uh, lester, i'll call you back.
a letter to vacate the apartment?
your lawyer is claiming i gave it to you.
you did.
I think we can agree it was under highly charged circumstances.
you gave such a convincing portrayal of a human being last night.
I can't believe i fell for it.
if you want to go there, we can talk about your bedside vigil.
what about it?
why the sudden wifely concern?
my lawyer says you were taking advantage of my weakened state to see what you could get out of me.
tell your lawyers i tried for 15 years to get something out of you, and i finally realized there's nothing there.
why can't it just be simple?
why can't it be i meet someone, i fall in love?
can't it just be that?
why does it have to be i meet somebody, i fall in love, she's pregnant.
am i ready to be a parent?
which i would have to do with this other parent who already hates me and is my doppelganger?
I didn't think she was that pretty.
I really need to figure out if i can do this.
Oh, have you ever seen anything so cute?
Oh!
this is a cute item.
I'm gonna get it for the baby.
maybe you should hold off.
this isn't gonna help you figure out whether you want to be a parent...
or not.
so cute.
or maybe it will.
I was in Kyoto in '97-- no, '98-- hit a place like this, only dark.
almost creepy.
the women could feed you.
they would do things to you, but you did not see a damn thing.
it's probably better that way.
that's a good point.
may i?
eh, what the hell?
I have to say I like the Gorham Sutter way of doing business-- a little entertainment here...
a lot of money there.
Max, about that rate of return that we were discussing.
discuss later.
I don't believe in hype and false promises.
that is not how i do business.
but i do think if we do this thing responsibly, we could be looking at some matching contributions.
you know what?
my wife loves you.
Really?
and she would love everything you're saying.
well, I-I think she's great.
let's really do dinner one night.
I'd love that.
good.
Hey, I was thinking--I mean, just off the bat, tell me what you think.
you could launch an initiative to rebuild the schools damaged by the fires in California.
what do you think?
there you go again.
that is exactly what Cynthia wants.
Zoe, you sold me.
Really?
consider it a done deal.
that's--that's so wonderful!
Hey, we should celebrate!
let's have some champagne.
the women of this establishment are available for private socializing in the apartments above the bar.
isn't that right?
uh, come on, clayton, i think it's exciting enough.
buzz kill, mommy.
well, it is a long opera.
Yeah.
and you--you got the foot thing going.
right.
it's Cynthia.
Hi, honey.
how's the opera?
it's done?
Oh!
uh, the meal?
Yeah, yeah.
the--the wine was spectacular.
uh, no.
no, we're still here you're on your way over?
to the restaurant?
uh, oh, wait, Zoe wants to say something to you.
no, no, no, no.
I just-- i'm really not very good with-- uh, she'll--she'll be right here.
hold on just a second...
no, I
Cynthia, hi!
how was the opera?
Yeah, gosh, i wish we'd known that you were joining us.
we're just--we're about to get in the car, and i told my husband that i was already on my way home.
Yeah.
absolutely, another time.
Bye.
you're a lifesaver.
okay, honey.
sorry. I'll see you at home, okay?
Bye.
we got ten minutes?
Absolutely.
okay.
what?
who is it?
one second!
Hi.
Hi.
uh, your birthday DVD.
you left it at my place.
uh, thanks.
you could have just messengered it.
I know.
just across my sky just like an angel off the page you have appear to my life what are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
this is great.
it's better than great.
it's amazing.
well, what are we doing?
don't you have a girlfriend wondering where you are right now?
don't you have a boyfriend?
well, he's a guy i'm dating.
he doesn't have personal hygiene products in my bathroom.
well...
I was just trying to get over you.
obviously, i didn't.
so what are you saying?
well...
I made a huge mistake...
and i want to start over.
Hi. I'm jack.
can i buy you a drink?
please tell me you have a better line.
everything's gonna be different this time.
how?
because everything has changed.
what do you mean?
you have your job, and now i have mine.
wait a minute.
are you here now because...
you got a good job?
no.
well, 'cause that's what it sounds like-- like...
you see me on some level, and if you're not on that level or above, then you can't be with me.
you're reading too much into it.
where are you going?
come back here.
I can't.
that's the whole point.
I can't come back.
we were engaged.
we were gonna get married, and then--and then i got a promotion, and--and you gave me a bottle of booze and then walked off into the night!
you're never gonna get over that, are you?
no, i'm not.
are you?
Yes. That's why i'm here.
no, you are here now because you feel good about yourself.
but what if that changes?
life is full of ups and downs.
Mia, come here. Come here.
no.
I kept this because i was hoping that you would change your mind.
but now i've changed mine.
you've got this look I can't describe you make me feel I'm alive and everything else is au fait without a doubt...
Hi!
Hi.
something really exciting happened.
what?
I became a mommy!
I mean, not--no, not the way you're becoming a mommy.
um, although I realize that may be the most conventional way, it's not the only way.
it happened to me when i was outside this baby store.
Oh, my god. Look at that.
how cute is this?
very cute.
Oh, my god, and check these out.
I couldn't decide between the sheep and the ladybug towels, so I got 'em both.
if he's a boy, he could still use a ladybug towel, right?
uh, Caitlin, there's something i need to tell you.
okay, wait, hang on.
just let me finish.
it all happened when i saw this photo album.
family photos.
we're gonna be a family, and I'm gonna be in it, and I'm gonna help you raise a child!
Caitlin, you really need to listen to me.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I've seen that look before.
this is really difficult.
no, it's not.
no, you have the easy part.
I have to stand here and listen to things i don't think i really want to hear.
look, Olivia and I had always planned to have a baby together.
she's the one who broke up with me.
I mean, meeting you was a surprise, and it was wonderful.
Yeah, but not as wonderful as Olivia coming back, right?
I didn't know this was gonna happen.
you know, i was prepared to change my whole life for you.
and all the time, I was just back up.
you can keep all this.
all this stuff is for you.
except this.
this is for me.
what the hell are you doing?
this car was reported stolen.
that's ridiculous.
this is my car.
if--if anyone's stealing it, it's you.
the car is registered to a Juliet Draper.
okay, don't--don't you get it?
that's my--that's my wife.
okay, we're getting divorced.
this--this is just some-- just some kind of sick game!
she's using you!
she's using you!
Hey!
careful, Davis.
you don't want to have a heart attack.
Hey, put it down!
thank you.
we can go now.
what's going on?
Gorham just named Clayton senior managing director.
what?
Yeah.
I didn't think you'd want any champagne.
I need to speak to you.
did you hear?
it's official.
the tates gave us their foundation.
up top!
apparently, gorham thinks you're responsible for that.
do you feel comfortable taking that credit?
I don't think the promotion is based on this one deal.
it's about my entire body of work.
shut up, Clayton.
just shut up!
great work, you two.
great work. - Thank you.
and you, party girl...
party"?
girl"?
Henry, i really need to talk to you about this.
I'm listening.
okay.
forgets one deal...
which i made happen.
I have generated more business for Gorham Sutter than anyone else, and yet the only people who get promoted around here are men-- white men, to be blunt.
I'm not insinuating anything, henry.
I am saying it straight out.
it doesn't matter to you, does it, that i have given everything to this firm, including my integrity?
integrity?
come on. This is wall street.
and as far as a promotion goes, well, you know that that is a...
tricky process.
your time will come.
Oh, i know it will, henry.
it just won't come here.
well, not if you keep up like this.
don't worry.
I'm not going to.
I quit.
I think i will have that champagne now.
sometimes the only thing that works is fudge...
and vodka.
vodka and fue.
my mother would be so proud.
so is anybody free for breakfast tomorrow?
lunch?
a movie?
my day's wide open.
does anyone want to watch me throw a shredder out a window?
anyone want to watch me throw Cilla grey out a window?
Oh, that I'd wanna see.
you know what?
this is the perfect end to the worst day.
ever.
hear, hear.
Amen to that.
Bernard? - No, it's not Bernard. It's me.
Ian. - Christ, I've been waitin' out here all night.
what are you talking about? - Who's Bernard?
who is Bernard leaving your apartment in the morning?
Ian, have you- have you been spying on me? - Who is he?
is he the director or the producer of your new French film?
Ian, I can't believe you've been waiting outside my flat.
Angela, I thought we were making plans together.
well, what kind of plans? - I thought we were going to California together.
Ian, I have a life here. I can't just pack up and go.
you'll have your business and I'll end up waiting on tables.
you won't have to wait on tables. I'll be there lookin' out for you.
l- I don't understand what you want from me.
what do you want from me? I'm-I'm-I'm moody and I'm-I'm self-obsessed.
and I'm ambitious.
and beyond your cool exterior, I sense you're bluffing.
no, I'm not.
I'm gonna take you to California, Angela. I am.
and if you don't think I will, then-then call my bluff. I am.
have you thought about how we're gonna take care of Martin Burns?
no. Have you?
come here.
I want it to be like a hit-and-run accident.
it's tricky, cause someone could see the license plate and we couldn't be sure he'd die.
well, I know I'm not stickin' a knife in him. - Why not?
cause I can't. Can you?
I don't know, Terry. I don't know what I'm capable of till I'm facing the moment.
you could kill him with a knife? - Or a hammer.
I was thinkin' like a muggin' with a hammer.
Jesus, I'm starting to think I don't know you, Ian. Look, if we do this, it-it has to be
I'm just sayin' there's a line I can't cross. - A gun is the quickest way.
I'm just sayin' let's do it as humanely as possible, all right?
we could strangle him with a wire.
we could get him on the ground, the two of us, and strangle him with a wire.
well, look, if we strangle him, he'd put up a fight, right?
now, I think we could take him, but it could get messy.
well, we'll have to make a decision one way or the other. We've only got three weeks.
I can't talk about it. Let's just enjoy our drinks.
Carol's had an accident. Except I don't think it was an accident.
well, suppose if I told you I don't care. In fact, I'm glad it happened.
I only wish it'd been fatal.
it might be yet. Everything's a bit touch and go.
it's funny how life boils down to this.
life is nothing if not totally ironic.
usually brilliant. Well done. Well done, as always.
there she is. Hello, darlin' - Oh, hi.
how are you? You were fantastic again. - I'm all right.
this is Kate and Terry. - Oh, lovely to meet you.
they've been dying to meet you. I've been going on and on and on about you.
brother. Nice to meet you. - Yeah, I loved it.
thank you so much. It was really nice of you to come.
brilliant. - Thank you. It means a lot.
what are you up to this evening? Do you wanna- Do you wanna join us?
we're going to a party. My friend finished filming today.
Oh, yeah, yeah. - Yeah?
Yeah, that'd be great. - It's okay with you?
Yeah, that'd be great. Bit of a squeeze, though, Terry. Bit of a crush.
I'll manage. - Hold your stomach in.
I can see why you're so crazy about Angela.
remember her? You passed her off to me. How could I forget?
you make it sound like it wasn't the biggest favor in the world.
I never said she wasn't wonderfully depraved.
Angela's better than that, though. She's innocent and also depraved.
she's working class, but classy. And that smile, Terry, that smile.
lovely. Oh, she's lovely.
look at the two of them. Dancin' and laughin' like there's no tomorrow.
"ain't life grand," Terry? Do you know what that's from? "Ain't life grand"?
one day you reach a point and there is no tomorrow, Ian.
Oh, Terry.
I figured out how to do it. - Yeah?
come here.
remember when we were kids? Bobby North from down the road?
I remember he was a bad kid.
Yeah. Yeah, well, me and Bobby made a gun once. He showed me how.
what, you made one? - Yeah, we made a gun out of wood, right?
and-and-and a little piece of metal. It fired one bullet.
it's the real thing, Ian. You can't trace it back, all right?
cause when you're finished, you take the wood, which is most of it, and you burn it.
then you take the metal pieces and you dump them down different sewers.
Yeah, but one shot, Terry. - What?
you'll have to make two of them- one each.
that way if anything happens, or goes wrong, we've got a backup.
right. Well, I think I can get me hands on a couple of bullets.
what are you in such deep conversation about? Are you plotting an assassination?
come on, I want to dance. It's our song. - Yeah? Oh, yeah. All right.
on stage.
who was that guy you were talking to?
what? Tim? He's, um, a writer.
he just sold one of his screenplays to a Hollywood studio.
well, he couldn't take his eyes off you. - Is that bad?
well, I'm sure it wasn't thrilling for his wife.
that wasn't his wife, that was his date. Are you angry with me?
I know what's in his mind.
Ian, I don't affect everyone the way that I affect you.
if I did, my career would have taken off a long time ago.
look, Angela, you are always flirting. - Oh, Ian, don't be angry with me.
I was really looking forward to taking you to bed tonight.
sorry to interrupt. There's Evan Macy over there. I love him.
I'd give anything for his autograph, but I don't want to seem obnoxious or nothing.
well, I-I know him. We did a TV film together. I could introduce you if you like.
no, really? - Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah.
so just imagine it, right?
all right. I see this little tick in his cheek.
I-I called him for 30, 000 and I won.
I've been playing poker most of my life.
martin Burns. I'm a friend of John Fowler.
john- - The producer.
we were at university together.
in those days, I kept myself in fine style playing poker.
I met my ex-wife at a poker game years ago.
when she left me, she said I neglected her because I preferred playing.
it wasn't true. But her lawyers used it as a strategy.
my dad taught me poker.
he was a poor man, ran a restaurant down in the south coast.
taught me the ins and outs of the game, lucky too.
I could never have kept myself on my expensive habits on his salary.
Terry, Kate's looking for you.
Ian, Martin Burns. My brother, Ian.
we've just discovered we're both poker players.
there's a wonderful game in town. I'd invite you both to play...
Yeah. Seems I get to London less and less these days.
I thought I'd be here the month, but, uh, seems my presence is required in California.
well, that's a great pity if you had your heart set on staying.
Ah, well, duty calls. And I will have time to dine with my old mum before I go.
she's 91. At that age, you can go at any moment.
great old girl. Let's hope I have her genes.
to life.
good luck with the poker.
I'm stunned. - You turned white as a ghost.
how long have you been talking to him?
a couple of minutes, I-I lost my breath. - What about?
nothing. Uh, poker, life.
what are the chances of that? The last thing we wanted to do was meet him, and then
what are the odds? - You always said how unpredictable life is.
how long will it take you to get those guns made?
I can't do this, Ian. - Look, Terry, you've been drinking.
you lose your confidence when you're drunk.
listen. I can't keep begging you to do this with me. He's leaving in a couple of days.
are you in or out? - I never said I wouldn't do it, right?
well, then, pull yourself together.
Ian.
I had such a wonderful time.
Angela's lovely, ain't she? She's not at all snobby.
she said she'd take me shopping.
I love the way she dresses.
I thought it might be way out of my range, but she said no.
what are you thinking? - Nothing.
who was that man you was talking to at the bar?
is that Mr. Burns? - How do you know Mr. Burns?
I was introduced. He's sweet, isn't he?
you told him Howard was our uncle?
it just seemed to come up, 'cause he's on the board of one of Howard's foundations.
that's what he said. Actually, he was looking for you just before we left.
well, why did you have to mention it, Kate?
what are you getting so upset for? We spoke for two minutes if that.
although I did get the impression he's got mixed feelings about your uncle.
Yeah, he seemed a little sarcastic. I could be wrong.
Did-did he, uh, imply bad things about Howard?
Yeah, I got that impression.
actually, he was really surprised to hear that you were his nephew.
Christ.
Kate, my head's splitting.
you drank too much. Take some aspirin. - I need my codeine.
no, Terry, you can't mix with that stuff. - Christ, where'd I put it?
it's in the kitchen in the cupboard.
Kate, what's it doing in the cupboard in the
I leave it in a certain place for a certain reason. I leave it in the medicine cabinet.
don't move things around, please.
Jesus.
all right?
this is his flat.
ground floor. It's right in the front.
if we could get in there, we could surprise him when he comes home.
all right.
right. I've got some tools at the garage that can get us in.
I think it's our best shot, Terry.
let's do it tonight. - Yeah? Are you up to it?
I can't stand the waiting around. - No, you're right.
I hope I have the nerve when the moment comes, Ian.
don't let me down, Terry. Look, it's simple.
I'm gonna shoot him. And then you shoot him again in the head, just to make certain.
or else you shoot him and I'll finish him off.
should have got a taxi, Ian. Had to give your name and address and everything.
no, no, no, no. We need a car standing by in case something goes wrong.
what could go wrong? What are you saying?
I'm not saying something will go wrong, but if something did go wrong...
we need to have a car.
here he is. Look.
all right, let's go.
come on, Terry. - Be quiet.
we have to be careful of this window. - Right.
don't touch anything.
what do we do now?
we just wait.
do you want some? - No. Put it away, Terry.
what's that?
just leave it. Don't answer it.
Hello, this is Martin Burns. I'm out. Leave a message after the tone.
Hello, love. It's Mum.
Oh, sorry to miss you, but I've had to change tomorrow's dinner to 7: 00.
looking forward to seeing you. Bye for now.
Terry, what are you thinking?
what if there's a God, Ian?
I mean, what if...
all those nights we used to lay awake, you know, in the dark...
and curse the fate of every human soul...
what if we was too angry?
no. No.
Yeah, but we're crossing the line here.
there's no going back from this. I tell you, I've said it before.
I don't wanna go back, Brother, and neither do you.
we need to look to the future. - A taxi. It's him.
right. All right. Now remember, we wait till he gets in...
let him shut the door, we let him get in the flat, right?
and then we come out quick, surprise him, and then we just do it.
right. - All right? We just do it.
right. Let's go.
the beef was nice, wasn't it? Can I have a drink?
Yeah.
Oh, wow. Look at that garden.
do you like it? - It's gorgeous.
it's nice.
do you look after it? - No, the gardener does.
Christ. - Terry, we're gonna have to do her too.
not me. I'm not doing her. - Well, then what we gonna do?
we've mucked it up. I'm not doing the woman.
okay, okay. You're right. But what are we gonna do?
I can't kill her just because she's here, Ian. It's wrong.
all right. Look, I don't disagree.
Oh, Terry, are we screwed.
San Francisco, L. A.
anyone traveling with you?
no, I'm traveling on me own. - Need a passenger?
fancy a trip? - I'd love to.
do you have what you came in for? - Yes.
I'll be sleeping over at yours tonight. I just need a change of clothes, and, uh, my laptop.
and we can go.
okay.
we'll have to do it tomorrow night at his mother's. I can find out where she lives.
I was gonna do it, Ian. You saw me. But then the woman arrived.
I would've done it, though. You saw me, Ian. I was ready. Oh, Christ.
I told you it was just a loan.
Where'd you get money like that, Ian?
you know, I'm involved in certain business ventures.
what sort of business ventures?
I told you. The hotels.
wait, I thought you said that your hotel deals had been delayed.
well, this is an advance. Will you just take it?
Where's it coming from? - Will you just take it?
look, soon this place will be back on its feet and you won't be so dependent on me.
where are you going? - Well, I'm not gonna work here forever.
well, who's gonna run things? - Oh, Dad, give me a break.
look.
you know that- that I love you.
I mean, I've stuck it out here all these years, even though it's not for me...
because of loyalty to you.
and I know that some of those business plans in the past didn't pan out...
but this one is different, Dad.
this one is different.
and I'm just mad about the girl.
it's funny how life has a life of its own.
Oh, Dad, Dad- - No, you're right, Ian.
nobody wants to be selfish, but everybody is.
no, you're not.
I have been.
and it's because- I think it's because I've been scared.
you're a good boy. I've always thought you had potential.
you're both good boys, you and your brother.
I've always wanted to make sure that I've loved you and Terry absolutely equally.
well, you have, you-you absolutely have.
dad, don't worry about a thing.
everything's gonna be fine.
everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
all right.
I thought I was pregnant. It's a false alarm.
pregnant? - Yeah.
I was late. I'm never late, am I? - But you're not. That's a relief.
Why?
we can swing it. Now your uncle's helped you out financially.
and you said that he might help you out with that loan for that sport shop idea.
I think you'd make such a good dad.
and just think, if we had boys, you know, you could teach them to play football or something.
right.
you're not hungry? - Not really, love.
it's very nice. - It's your favorite.
I know. Can I get a whiskey, please?
a whiskey? - Yeah.
I don't know if we got any left. - It's in my drawer.
you're late. - Sorry, sorry.
Oh, Jesus Christ. You've been drinking.
I'm fine. I said I'm fine. Just leave it at that, all right?
let's just do it, Brother, before I change my mind.
have you got the guns? - Here. Right here. And the bullets.
all right, all right. Don't load them now.
are you too drunk to handle this, Terry? - I said I'm fine.
all right, let's just go. - Right.
we'll go up to him when he's on his own, we shoot him...
and then I'll put a second one in him just to make certain.
I know what to do, Ian. Right? You don't always have to run things.
can you handle this, the state you're in? - Worry about yourself.
all right? I'll take care of him. Just
have you got the address? - Yeah, I've got it. Let's get this over with.
don't worry about the restaurant.
I can help you if you need me.
I dreamed about the boys last night.
again?
when they were younger.
there he is. Let's take him now.
wait. You don't wanna let him see his mum for the last time?
what? - You make me sick.
let him see the old lady.
you're drunk, Terry. It's a disgrace turning up on a job like this drunk.
Christ. You don't care about anyone in this world except yourself.
you're not a big shot, Ian. You're a small stakes player.
I don't care how many hotels you wind up running or how hot that girl is.
why don't you shut up?
I bet you had a big handful of those pills that guy keeps you supplied with as well.
I'm fine.
we'll kill him when he comes out.
Mr. Burns. - Hey?
Oh, that's right. I remember you. We met at that, uh, party.
Yeah. We-We thought it was you. - I understand you're Howard Swann's nephews.
that's right.
what are you doing around here? You live around here?
no. Ian? - Do it now.
let's just do it now. - Hey, what's going on?
what are you thinking?
that then was then.
and now is now.
it went much smoother than I thought, Ian.
and not a soul around.
we're lucky he chose that path.
Yeah, no one saw us.
and we did the right thing.
we didn't run back to the car. We just walked calmly back.
Yeah.
there's a great weight off my back.
you're right, Ian.
it's now.
it's always now.
you better burn his wallet.
are you okay? - Go back to sleep.
what do you think of this one? - Oh, I love it.
I thought you would. So, are there any new developments on California?
Yeah, I think we can leave in about four or six weeks. We signed the papers today.
who? - Martin- Martin Burns, was it?
Oh, really? How bizarre.
Yeah, well, no one saw or heard anything.
what do you think of this one? - As if you have to ask.
you know, I'll never forget you boys, what you did for me.
I owe you my life.
and the joy of repaying you gives me such pleasure.
now, Terry, you- Look, you spoke about, uh...
you know, the notion of opening a- a sports shop if you had the backing?
no, it's okay.
no, look. Look, cheer up.
the worst is behind you. I'm here to tell you that the- the future is rosy.
Terry, Uncle Howard's right.
stop walking around with that face on.
where are they? Is that them? - Yes.
Angela, I'm so nervous. - You're fine. They'll love you.
hello. - Hello. Oh, it's nice to see you, sir. I'm Ian.
nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
hello. You have a nice trip? - Very good, thank you.
let me take your bag. - We've been really looking forward to this.
Yeah, it'll be great. - Your hair.
so how's your play doing, love? - It's going well. It's still selling out at weekends.
Oh, well, that's to see you take your clothes off. - Mom!
so what do you do, Ian? - Uh, hotels.
hotels? Which ones? - Yeah, I got a couple in, uh, California.
Oh, yes, Angela said you were planning an extended stay out there.
well, very extended, I hope. - California.
I'm starving. Where are we eating?
I'm taking you all to Claridge's. - Oh, is it nice?
lovely. - No, it's on us, though.
no, no, no. This treat is on me. Yeah.
Oh, thank you. Very nice of you.
Oh, they're really lovely, your parents. Lovely.
Oh, I can't get California out of my mind. - I know.
I've spoken to Uncle Howard and everything is right on track.
thank you.
she's beautiful, isn't she? - Very, very.
a bit high maintenance, though.
you up to it? - I certainly hope so.
I always dreaded the thought that she might wind up with some starving actor in the theater.
not that I've anything against the theater, mind you...
but... a man who knows his way around the world of business, well
there was a time when I could've invested in some ventures...
but I didn't have the stomach for the risk.
so I spent my life behind the wheel of a car driving other men.
she says you've got a future.
Oh, God.
what is it? - I can't take it.
take it easy. It's all right. - I need another pill.
no, Terry. You can't take so many of those, not with all that alcohol.
Kate, leave me alone. I've gotta get rid of this feeling of panic.
why should you be feeling panicked? - I don't know.
I just need the pill. Christ, I can't even get a decent night's sleep.
all right.
my car didn't have that dent when I brought it in.
it had to have been there. Nobody's touched it. - No, you put a dent in my car.
how the hell would I dent it? - I don't know.
what's going on?
there's a dent, look, in my car. Someone's driven my car.
will you shut up? What are you accusing me of? - Someone has to have driven it.
look where you point your finger. It could get broken.
calm down. Calm down. - Get your hands off me.
sorry, Mr. Finn. Just give us a minute.
I'll sort out your bodywork for you.
I need a word with you. What the hell's the matter with you?
look, I'm not at all pleased with the way things are going around here lately. All right?
Hey! There's another one here.
Yeah, I miss you too.
Nobu. Yeah, I made reservations for after the show.
who's that? Look, I'll see you later. All right? Bye.
Hey. Are you all right? - I need to speak to you.
well, I wish you'd called first. I'm expecting some guys over for a conference call.
I'm having bad thoughts.
what kind of bad thoughts?
we did a terrible thing, Ian.
Oh, Jesus, can you just get past it? - I'm trying.
I should never have let you talk me into it. - I didn't.
Terry, you needed his help. Loan sharks were gonna break your legs...
and maybe even Kate's as well.
but Martin Burns...
we stepped on him like he was an insect.
look, Terry, I can't discuss this now.
I've got two guys and a transatlantic conference call coming up.
I can't go on like this.
let's talk about it later. Why aren't you at the garage?
I got let go. - What does that mean?
the boss said, uh, I-I should take some time off.
he thinks I've been under a lot of strain lately. Thanks for denting the Jaguar.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
look. You've gotta relax. All right?
I can't get through the day without drinking.
look, you've got to go home. All right? Rest up.
I'll call you later, we'll get together, all right?
you've gotta ease up. You'll give yourself a bloody heart attack.
then I'll die. So I'll die.
don't talk like that. What's the matter with you?
guys, come in, please. - Lovely.
look, I'll call you later. I'm gonna get you past this, okay?
all right.
see, this is more like it, Terry, isn't it?
getting out of the house.
can't sit around there too much. Too much thinking.
Kate said you're not even talking about poker anymore.
Where's our old Terry?
I mean, you're a gambler. This is you. - Yeah.
I'm not suggesting you go mad or anything, but
I'm not the same Terry, Ian.
I can't be anymore. - No, you just have to focus.
Yeah. Now is the perfect time to start thinking about setting up the sport shop.
I mean, Uncle Howard said he would start you off. You'd be your own boss.
no more kowtowing to superiors. And you love sports.
maybe you're right, Ian. Maybe what I need is just a big change.
Yeah, you need to focus on something substantial. You can't just do nothing.
Yeah. - Hey?
I think I'll do it, Ian.
Yeah, it's just exactly what you need, Terry.
get off the booze and the pills and set up your own place.
right, and not just sporting goods.
exercise equipment.
that's where the money is today. - Yeah?
Yeah. Helping people set up their own private gyms and stuff.
I like the way you're thinking, Terry.
cause you're thinking forwards. You're not lookin' back.
you've got a really good future, Terry. - Yeah?
go on! - We were raised to know right from wrong.
go on! - Did you get that one?
look at this. I got a winner.
it's the beginning of a new streak, Terry.
I can feel it, Ian.
Could-Could you get this model with the same interior in a left-hand drive...
say, in California, for instance? - For California. Yeah, certainly.
and would there be a long waiting list or
I would think about three or four months.
Oh, can I? - Please do.
Hey, great scene. You really nailed it.
you were great. You were great tonight. - Do you think so?
the bedroom scenes were so sexy as always.
well, I was doing it with him, but I was thinking of you for motivation.
don't forget. Tomorrow is Lord Eisley's party. He's invited the whole cast.
Yeah. I'm gonna keep my eye on you like a hawk.
you know, his son's a notorious playboy, and I think he's asked everyone just to get you there.
uh, what's that? - Nothing.
show me.
Hello? - I need to speak to you, Ian.
Kate, Kate, Kate, calm down. What's the matter?
it's Terry. I really need to speak to you.
what, now?
Yeah, now. Is it possible?
well, look, I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back, all right?
is everything all right? - Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.
there's a little family problem. - It's nothing serious, I hope.
no. That was Kate. You remember? You met her.
it's just something's come up. I'll see you back at yours in a while.
well, hurry. I want to show you my gratitude for the earrings.
all right. See you later, all right?
I'm worried about Terry, Ian.
what's the matter?
it's his mental health.
no, he's not interested in that.
and now he's angry all the time.
he's talking to himself, for God's sake. - No, we decided.
he was gonna speak to Uncle Howard about bankrolling it. He was very excited.
his mind's not right, Ian.
it's all the pills he's taking, and the drinking.
he thinks he's killed someone.
what? - Yeah.
you know, I knew this girl once, she had, like, mental problems.
she was convinced that she had run someone over. She hadn't.
you know, but she was obsessed with it for the rest of her life.
does he, uh- Is he going around...talking- talking about this, uh, murder?
he's gotten worse and worse. He has these terrible nightmares.
he's uncommunicative, face of doom all the time, bouts of crying.
when we were at the dog track, he seemed to have come out of it.
when he come home, he was straight back in it.
you know, it's just- it's obsession that he's done this horrible thing.
and he- he won't let me get a doctor.
no, no, don't do that. Don't-Don't get a doctor.
if you get a doctor, then it can- I'll deal with this.
but... if you get a doctor, it could spiral out of control.
I really think he should see a doctor. - Don't get a doctor, Kate. Don't.
because I know Terry, and it will only make things worse. All right?
just- I'm gonna be in the countryside tomorrow, all right?
and then when I come back, I'll spend some time with Terry, and it'll be
you'll see. It'll be all right.
well, where you gonna be if I need you though?
so you're a fan of the Greek tragedies too? - Love them. Crazy about them.
it's just rare that I could ever get the chance to act in one.
God, I know. It's difficult, isn't it? Which is your favorite, Ian?
Oh, I'm not really that-that familiar.
Oh, well. Mine's always been Medea, Euripides.
Yeah, me too. I think Clytemnestra's probably the best character of all classical plays. - Yeah.
by the Martha Graham troupe, you know them? - Really?
Yeah. I mean, all the terror was there, all the Aristotelian pity and fear.
Mr. Blaine? Your brother's here. - Yeah?
what? - He'd like to see you.
Oh. Uh...
could you give me a moment?
Yeah, sure. Bring him in.
it must be pretty bad if he's driven all the way out here.
no, l- Uh- It's just a little family problem. I won't be long.
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. - I'm sure.
your brother's there, Mr. Blaine. - Thanks.
Terry, what are you doing here? How did you know where I was?
Kate had the address.
I need to tell you something. - Well, just keep your voice down.
I don't want anyone overhearing. Why didn't you just give me a phone?
I want to turn myself in, Ian. - What?
we broke God's law. - God?
Terry, What God? What God, you idiot?
I shouldn't have let you talk me into it.
I didn't talk you into it. Stop deluding yourself. - I want this off my neck.
look, you can't do this, Terry, all right?
you can't do it. You'd be throwing your whole life away, and mine and Uncle Howard's.
I won't implicate you and Howard.
you won't- - This is my personal decision.
you won't be able to keep us out of it. - I will.
I've thought about suicide, Ian. - But why?
I just want the slate wiped clean.
look. You're depressed.
you're just suffering from a little depression, that's all.
Kate wants me to see a doctor. - No, no. Look, I can help you. If you'll just let me.
I just want to tell someone. Go in and serve my punishment. Have it off me.
just give me a minute. Give me a minute to get my thoughts in order, will you?
I wish you could come with me. But if you won't, I understand.
just give me a minute.
I feel less panic since I made this decision. - Hi.
you okay? Are you gonna join us?
Terry and I are just discussing a little problem. Everything will be all right.
just had to talk to Ian about something.
you sure? - Yes.
you go on, I'll only be a minute.
okay.
she's very beautiful. She'd make a great wife for you.
look, Terry.
I'm sorry for barging in. - No, no, it's all right. It's all right.
look, I want to hear what you've got to say. We're family. You're my brother.
Yeah, we can talk, but you're not gonna change my mind.
maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe you'll even change mine. But just promise me one thing.
we've gotta have a discussion about this before you plunge ahead.
promise? - Promise. Can I come in and get a drink?
no, that's not a good idea.
you go. I'll give you a call tonight. - Right.
call me tonight.
I just don't see any alternative.
what are we saying?
well, I don't know what we're saying. We're-We're saying we want to survive.
but he's family.
Terry. He's my brother.
well, I-I know that.
but he has to be stopped before he- this whole thing unravels.
Yeah, I can't- I can't let that happen.
no.
no, l
it's killing again.
how am I gonna do that?
it's deja vu, but a thousand times worse.
speed is of the essence.
Terry could be doing something awful while we sit here and curse our fate.
he was right about one thing.
it was like crossing a line.
there was no way back.
it has to be made to look like an accident.
Yeah. Yeah, an accident or a suicide.
well, he just broods.
you know, he sits there talking to himself.
he imagines that you and him have got some dark secret.
you know, that you've harmed someone or something.
Ian, I think he's gonna hurt himself.
let me be alone with him, Kate.
Yeah.
Terry.
Terry. - I had a dream about Martin Burns.
Terry, listen to me.
you need a couple of days away from all this.
get some fresh air, some sea air...
just the two of us.
we'll go out on the boat again tomorrow.
we never go sailing anymore, Ian. - That's what I'm saying.
we'll take some sandwiches and some beers...
and we'll just talk, brother to brother.
I'd like that.
I wish you could see my point of view.
it'll be great. Just the two of us.
I think Angela said she was taking Kate shopping tomorrow.
she said she was gonna help her out with her style.
Yeah.
and we'll just relax, yeah?
get some sun. Maybe we can have a swim.
you'll feel so much better when you've had some sea air.
Yeah, but we'll never be our old selves again, Ian, right?
I mean, there's no going back.
go and tell Kate that we're going out sailing tomorrow.
right. - Yeah.
okay. - Come on.
Kate, I've got something to tell you.
we're going sailing tomorrow.
Yeah, just the two of us. Ian's gonna take me out on the boat.
so, did Terry tell you the good news?
Yeah, it's a wonderful idea.
cause you two never really got the chance to spend much time on your boat, did you?
and you were so excited when you first bought it. - Yeah.
I told Ian about Angela taking you shopping tomorrow as well.
Oh, yeah. She's so nice.
Mike Eisley from the garden party asked if we were serious.
and then he invited me to Morocco for the weekend.
and what did you say?
well, I told him that I loved you.
for the first time in my life, those words actually had meaning.
I love you.
are you all right? - Yeah, yeah.
you seem a bit distracted. - No, I'm just thinking about what you're saying.
and I'm tired, you know.
well, you have been working really hard recently.
is he all right? - He's depressed.
he drinks too much and he's getting sullen, and
Kate's worried that he might hurt himself.
well, maybe he- Well, he should go to a doctor then.
no, he resists. He resists.
I didn't tell Kate this, but he's talked of suicide.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. That's awful. - I know.
best thing we ever did, getting this boat, Terry, isn't it?
eh?
Kate's right. We don't get out on it as often as we should.
it's sad how things turned out, isn't it?
don't start, Terry. - No, I mean it, Ian.
we made the wrong decision.
the way I see it, we didn't have much choice.
you always have choice, Ian.
I see that now.
I mean, l- I didn't at first.
I thought... like you, that we had no choice, but
all right, let's say that you're right- which I'm not saying
you really fool yourself, Ian, don't you?
his testimony was gonna put Uncle Howard in prison for the rest of his life.
well, maybe Uncle Howard deserves to go to jail.
Oh, what a thing to say. Forget it.
Christ, you think we've committed some kind of unnatural act, but we haven't.
the whole of human life is about violence.
it's a cruel world, Terry.
I-I mean, I didn't have to do it.
well, why did you then?
I just kept going, like- like when I gamble over my head, you know?
I just put the bet down like when I'm in a dream.
you weren't dreaming when you shot him.
all right. Look, listen.
we made a mistake, right? But it's over.
all right? We made the wrong choice. I'm giving you that...
but being punished by it won't undo it.
martin Burns is dead. He's dead.
I called the police last night.
you did what?
I called them and I told them I had information on the murder of Martin Burns.
they said, "Who is it?"
I wanted to tell them... who I was, but I didn't.
hung up.
I'm gonna call them as soon as I get back, Ian.
why would you do that?
what's the matter with you? It's suicide, Terry.
don't you even care that you're gonna take Uncle Howard and me with you?
it's the order of things, Ian. It's off kilter. Can't you see it?
I have to straighten it out.
all right. I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
we came out here just to relax, didn't we? Just to sail and unwind, eh?
Yeah.
I'm just gonna get us some more beers, all right? - All right.
why couldn't you just let it go? Why couldn't you let it go?
Ian, what's wrong?
you've ruined everything, Terry. - Ian, what's wrong?
Terry, you've ruined it! You've ruined everything!
Ian, stop! - We could've had everything!
Ian. Ian.
Ian. Ian.
Ian.
Ian!
Oh, God.
God.
what we think happened, but we don't know for sure...
one killed the other, either on purpose or by accident...
and then took his own life, drowned himself.
awful.
the place reeks of booze and pills.
I don't know. Every day, it's something else.
Oh, I like that.
what do you think? - Yeah.
I would look good in that. - Yeah, Terry would love that.
would he? - Yeah, men love that sort of shape.
I wore something similar when Ian first saw me.
on the ground! Now!
Frank? Take a seat, son.
please rise.
Frank Henson, 15 years ago, you were convicted by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
for the 1998 murder of Kimberly Tolbert.
you were sentenced to death. This court has found insufficient evidence.
to grant an emergency stay.
thus, your execution will proceed as scheduled.
at midnight three days from today.
court is adjourned.
John... I am so sorry.
thank you, Professor. You folks did everything you could.
I know my brother appreciates it.
Frank... This can't be it. There's got to be something more.
we can do. What about the lab work. We were gonna test again, or what about...
Alexis, we've played every card.
sometimes the good guys don't win.
I am not giving up.
and you know why? Because it's the best idea ever.
castle, I am not getting married in space.
why not? We could be the first.
commercial space flight is only a couple years away, and you said you wanted it to be special.
Yes, because when I was a little girl, imagining my wedding day being stuck in a small tin can.
with a thousand tons of rocket fuel. Strapped to my ass was exactly what I had in mind.
then we agree.
if you don't wanna go and look at wedding venues this weekend, then just say so.
I don't wanna go look at wedding venues this weekend.
too bad.
what? - Nothing.
it's, um, text alert on the project Alexis has been working on.
I thought you guys weren't talking. - We're not.
rather... she isn't. So I insulted her boyfriend.
what's the prison sentence on that? Castle, just give her some time.
she'll get over it. That's what you think.
once when she was 3, I refused to buy her a candy bar.
she held her breath until she passed out.
you have no idea how determined she can be.
Alexis, we went through the case files like you asked.
I gotta say, there's nothing in there that says. This guy's innocent.
what about the swabs from Kim Tolbert's body. That we submitted to the New York trace lab.
for re-testing? I mean, they've had them for weeks.
well, we've been calling every day to move things along, but it's not in our jurisdiction.
you don't understand. A man's going to die in three days.
unless we do something.
we do understand. There's just not much that we can do.
what about your dad? Have you talked to him about this case?
Yeah, maybe he'll spot something that no one else did.
so...
you're here.
I need your help. But just because I'm asking.
doesn't mean things are okay between us.
I'm still mad at you, okay? Okay.
what's up?
I've been working on this innocence review case. With my criminal law Professor.
this guy is on death row for killing his neighbor...
a high school girl... But he didn't do it, and they're about to execute him for it.
how do you know he didn't do it?
well, for one thing, he had rotator cuff surgery four months before.
he couldn't have swung the fireplace poker. Used to kill the victim.
well, under the rush of adrenaline, you'd be surprised what people are capable of.
you sound just like the prosecutor. But there's more.
they found fresh tire tracks in the dirt. Outside the victim's back door...
bicycle treads. And Frank didn't own a bike.
no, he was 24 then. He worked on... cars.
wait. How do you know his name?
you just said it.
no. I didn't.
you know about the case. How?
yeah... how?
I must have seen the file on Esposito's desk.
you've been checking up on me. No! No.
well, a little, yes.
you're unbelievable. - Couldn't help it.
you're my daughter. I'm interested in your life, but you won't return my calls.
okay, so did you find anything in the file? Anything that can help?
Alexis, he did have priors.
what makes you think he's innocent?
because I know him, dad.
I've spent time with him. He's not a killer.
I know what the evidence says, but he didn't do this.
I need you to come to Pennsylvania with me.
I need you to help me prove it.
no, come on. I get it. It would only be for a couple of days, 'cause that's pretty much all the time there is left, and it's a chance for Alexis and me to reconnect. Castle, you don't have to explain.
we can look at venues another day.
you sure you're all right with this? - Yes.
I mean, she's practically family. I care about her, too.
you're pretty great, you know that?
Yeah. Now go spend some time with your daughter.
Thanks. - Good luck.
it has been a long time since we have taken a road trip together.
remember the time we went to amish country?
ended up getting chased by that cow?
dad, this isn't a road trip, and this isn't about fun.
this is about having less than 70 hours. To save a man from execution.
let's go. Right.
fasten your seatbelt. Gonna be a bumpy ride.
so...
how is...
how is Pi? Everything still good?
why are you asking about Pi? I... just thought.
we should chat about... - Dad, I know what you're doing.
what am I doing? You're trying to bond.
no, I'm not.
Yes, you are. We haven't talked in weeks, so now you're trying to make this about us.
no, I wasn't.
I wasn't, so... And what if I was? Would that be so bad?
I just thought you were here for the case. I am.
then how come you haven't asked a single question about it.
since we left?
okay. Um... so what do I need to know?
Frank Henson... the accused.
we're meeting him at the prison. He's Pennsylvania blue collar, struggled through high school, but he's smart.
he earned his Automotive Mechanic degree in '95.
he's a little rough around the edges, but he's got a good heart.
okay. - And...
and there's Maggie. Who's Maggie?
Maggie Ingram, the love of his life. She'll be at the prison, too.
love of his life? Is it one of those prison pen pal romance things?
dad, no. She's his high school sweetheart.
he proposed to her two weeks before his arrest.
and she stayed with him? She's been by his side the whole time.
every hearing, every appeal. She's the one who wrote to the innocence review.
every week for three years to get us involved.
you know, Alexis, um...
th-this is a long shot. You know that, right?
I mean, it may not work out the way you hope.
I- I just don't wanna... Just don't wanna see you hurt.
dad, I know these people. I care about them.
it already hurts.
Alexis. Thank God.
Maggie, this is my dad.
Mr. Castle, thanks for coming.
I'd almost given up till Alexis called.
Hey, baby. Hey, sunshine.
so what is this, a going away party?
no. They came back to help. - Help out?
lost the appeal. It's over, isn't it?
no. It's not over. Not yet.
this is Mr. Castle, Alexis' father.
nice to meet you, Mr. Castle. Your girl's one in a million.
you should be proud. - I am.
so are you some kind of lawyer?
no.
you a cop? - No.
I'm a... mystery writer.
he's more than that.
he's helped the NYPD crack their biggest cases.
well, I don't... I don't wanna oversell it.
you ever save a guy on death row? No.
but my dad's a genius at uncovering the real story.
Frank, I know you've been through this. More times than you can stomach, but if you can...
tell him what happened that night.
I was working on my Camaro.
I spent every waking hour with it back then.
my house alarm went off.
I was doing some welding, and the smoke set off the garage alarm.
the code is Stingray 7.
it's off now. Thank you.
that's when I heard the screams across the street.
I ran over to see what happened.
Hello?
is everyone all right?
back door was open, so I went inside.
she was lying there.
the blood was... Whatever happened, I was too late.
I heard the sirens, and I panicked.
I mean, I knew how it would look, so I took a rag.
and tried to wipe down all my prints, but I ran out of time.
I had her blood on me, a police record.
it... went the way you'd expect.
and what about your home security company?
did they have a record of your call? Yes.
but the prosecution argued it still left plenty of time.
how well did you know Kim Tolbert?
not that well.
I mean, her mom and her lived there a few years, and... Kim'd flirt with me a little bit.
I was friendly, but that was it.
they entered her diary into record.
she wrote that she had a crush on Frank, so the prosecutor made Frank out to be some kind of predator.
and you didn't... see anyone as you ran into the house?
no. They must have bolted out the back before I got there.
well, what about back then?
anybody she was having a problem with?
Lyle Gomez, Kim's high school ex-boyfriend.
they had a very... stormy relationship.
plus she dumped him a week before she was killed.
police talk to him? Well, they didn't have to. They had me.
Mr. Castle, I've got three days left on God's earth.
I don't need you to find the real killer.
I just need somebody to prove it wasn't me.
castle, take it easy. Calm down. Calm down?
you should have seen the way these people looked at me.
like I'm some kind of savior.
I- I don't even know if he's innocent. Okay, how can I help?
I don't even know if i can help.
I mean... what if I can't? Alexis would never forgive me.
just do your best, Castle. I mean, she loves you.
and I'm here... For both of you.
she's coming. I gotta go.
ready to get started?
let's go.
this is everything spanning the life of the case.
well, the least your Professor could've done. Is throw in some cliffsnotes.
so what do we know about this ex-boyfriend of Kim's?
Lyle Gomez. Was a varsity football player.
hot and cold relationship with Kim. Everyone that knew him said he had a temper.
do you guys talk to him? Professor McDonald and the defense lawyer tried, but Lyle told them he didn't want to relive it.
said it was too painful. And there's no evidence that indicates.
he might have done it? Nothing at all? - Mnh-mnh.
what are all these little things on the floor around the body?
charms. They broke off her bracelet during the struggle.
so before the attack, there might have been some pushing and shoving.
lovers' quarrels can start like that. Before they turn to something else.
but aside from Maggie's theory, there's nothing tying Lyle to any of this.
but... maybe you'll see something we missed.
Hey, so that evidence the innocence review.
submitted to the trace lab... How close are they.
to looking at it? Well, from what we heard, it's gonna take weeks, which means they'll never get to it in time.
what? - Well, by all accounts, Kim was a bright and beautiful girl.
who everyone loved.
she had no enemies to speak of, and nothing points to anyone other than Frank.
because they didn't look at anyone other than Frank.
or maybe because... It was Frank.
look, I'm sorry, Alexis. It's just sometimes...
okay, fine. But if it was Frank, what was his motive?
right.
Wow. You innocence review folks just won't give up, will you?
can I help you, officer... "Lane"?
kim's murder tore this town apart.
I guess, we're just wondering what you all are fighting for.
justice. - Justice?
he had her blood on his hands when they caught him.
he was holding the shop rag. That he used to wipe down the crime scene.
you want justice? Let him meet his maker.
has it been like that the whole time? Pretty much.
okay, let's go over this again.
Frank hears a scream. He runs across the way.
he bangs on the door. It's locked.
he runs around the back. - He finds the back door open and goes inside.
back door was open. Wait.
what time of year was the murder... November?
Yeah, the 13th. Why?
1998. Temperature that night was...
40 degrees. So?
so that's far too cold for Kim to have left the door open.
yet according to Frank, it was open, presumably because someone else committed the crime.
Yeah, but everyone thinks he's lying.
Yes, but what they don't see, what no one sees.
is that we can prove whether or not he was lying.
come on. I'll get the car. You pay the check. Wait. Dad?
come on, dad. Will you please tell me what you're doing?
if Frank is guilty, then he would have opened the back door, which means...
he would have wiped down the doorknob. To get rid of his fingerprints.
but if he's telling the truth and the back door.
was already open, he wouldn't have needed to wipe it.
because he never touched it. And that would mean someone else was there that night.
question is, did CSU dust that doorknob for fingerprints?
here it is.
they did. - And?
and... it was wiped clean.
sorry, sweetie. He lied.
but it doesn't make any sense. - I know.
I wanted to believe it as much as you. No, I mean this report.
it says the back doorknob was totally clean...
no prints, no nothing. So Frank couldn't have wiped it down.
the shop rag Frank used was covered in grease.
from working on his car. They found traces of grease.
in other places where he wiped down his prints, but there's no mention of it on the doorknob.
it isn't in the report. Dad, if there wasn't any grease...
then someone else was there, wiped down the doorknob before Frank got there, getting rid of their own prints.
someone else was there that night.
sweetie, you were right.
someone else killed Kim Tolbert.
Yes, Professor, I understand. Okay. Bye.
What'd he say? - It's not enough.
but we know someone else wiped down the doorknob.
Yeah. But he says you can't build a case. Based on evidence that isn't there.
it's Beckett.
Hey, how's it going?
I... Not... not so good.
we'd be grasping at straws if we had any.
well, I might have one for you. I went to the trace lab last night.
their people wouldn't run your case evidence, but I found someone else that would.
who?
it's Lanie. Put me on speaker.
Yeah. Um... you're on.
Alexis, why on earth.
wouldn't you come to me directly?
Lanie, I didn't know you could do... - She convinced a contact at the lab to run evidence after hours.
now we re-tested every swab taken. From Kim's body 15 years ago.
everything listed in Pennsylvania's report.
came out in our report, with the exception of one thing.
we found trace amounts of ammonium nitrate.
that their lab never picked up. Ammonium nitrate?
it's an oxidizing agent, commonly found.
in cold packs, explosives, - fertilizer. - Fertilizer.
wait. Lyle Gomez.
kim's ex-boyfriend. He used to work at a gardening store.
dad, it's him. That's why he wouldn't speak with us.
we have to go talk to him. - Wait a minute.
if you guys think someone out there is involved, then you need to get ahold of the police.
Yeah, I don't think the police are gonna be of much help around here.
castle, if he's your killer, he's dangerous. I can't help you if something happens.
look, Beckett, Frank Henson has two days to live.
this is our only lead. What else are we supposed to do?
okay. Now odds are, Lyle Gomez will not.
want to speak with us, but I've got experience with guys like this, so you just leave it to me.
there he is.
all right, that does not bode well. Where you think you're going?
to talk to him. - Alexis, no. Absolutely not.
he just gave us a none-too-subtle hint.
he was looking at you, dad. He won't talk to you, but I can reach him.
the man is a possible murder suspect.
he won't do anything with you here. But what makes you even think.
he's gonna open the door to you?
I'm a teenage girl. I'll remind him of Kim.
no, I'm not... - I'm not asking for permission.
I'll be watching you like a hawk.
you people need to stay off my property.
I guess Kim was wrong about you. What do you mean?
I read her diary.
she said you were kind, caring, made her feel safe.
what else did she say? How about you let me in?
not a day goes by I don't think about her.
you ever been in love so bad, it hurt?
is that why you don't talk about it?
where were you when it happened?
kim called me that night.
she wanted me to pick her up from Jasper Grove. Jasper Grove? What's that?
farmland and woods, east of town. Kids party there.
she must have gone to one, which surprised me. Because she barely ever drank.
but Kim broke up with you, right? So why'd she call you?
she said I was the only one that she could trust.
she was upset. About what?
she didn't say. I figured somebody hit on her.
anyway, she asked me to drive her home, so I did.
what happened then? I was hoping that her calling meant that she'd give me another chance.
so I asked if I could come in.
and did you?
she wanted to be alone.
she said she had some decisions she needed to make.
so I decided I needed to get drunk.
so I went and I shoplifted a pint of Jack, but the shop owner caught me.
he made me pick up every single piece of litter. In his parking lot as punishment.
when I heard the sirens, I thought he was arresting me, too.
those sirens were for Kim.
when I got to her house, I saw Frank.
I saw her body on the stretcher.
if I had just found a way to stay there, she'd be alive.
did you tell this to the police?
they didn't ask. Why would they? They had the guy.
why do you think Frank killed her? Maybe he got jealous.
he didn't like seeing her with other guys.
what other guys? I didn't ask.
but I know they dropped by her house.
other boys.
Thanks.
dad, what are you doing?!
I was overreacting, maybe. You were in there a long time.
and I came away with some leads. Turns out Kim was seeing other boys.
what other boys? We were hoping you could tell us.
you lived across the street from her. Do you remember seeing any other guys.
go to Kim's house?
that was 15 years ago. This is important, Frank.
one of them may be involved in her death. That's the only lead you have?
we're also looking. Into the party Kim went to that night.
we have NYPD checking, seeing if. Anything was reported in Jasper Grove.
that could connect to her murder. Try to focus on kids you saw at Kim's house.
anything you can remember... Hair color, cars they drove, bikes they rode.
not just that day. Any day. Try to think.
I'm tired of thinking.
I'm tired all around, to tell you the truth.
Frank. It's over, Alexis.
don't say that.
all these years... Maggie has been leading this charge.
she's been my rock, and now I've gotta be hers.
I've got less than two days.
to help her make peace with what's about to come.
the last thing that she needs is more false hope.
this isn't false hope. - It is false hope.
it's done. - This could be what turns everything around!
it's done. Alexis...
guard.
listen, I appreciate everything you've done, everything you've tried to do.
but it's time to let it go.
dad, we might be on to something. How can Frank just give up?
after what he's been through, I can't blame him. So you're giving up, too.
Hey, we are gonna follow every possible lead, but...
we can't go back to Frank, not until we have solid evidence that he's innocent.
Hey, Ryan, did you come up with anything on Jasper Grove? No police or incident reports.
from the night that Kim Tolbert died.
however, I did find definite signs. Of trouble in Jasper Grove.
what kind of trouble? A farmhouse there was foreclosed on.
in '97, stood empty till '99.
that's when a young family bought it, but as soon as they moved in, they all got sick.
turns out the place was contaminated. With toxic chemicals.
from what? High levels of residue.
from methamphetamine production, which might explain. Your ammonium nitrate.
someone was using the farmhouse to cook meth? Yeah, and it looks like.
it might have been kids. What makes you say that?
photos from the county assessor's office.
show bicycle tracks in the dirt all over the property.
thank you very much, Ryan.
bike tracks. There were bike tracks outside Kim's house.
dad, do you realize what this means? That maybe the party Kim went to was at that farmhouse.
and she saw kids doing meth.
well, not just doing meth. Cooking meth. - That's why she had to get out of there.
that's why she told Lyle she had some decisions to make. - She was thinking about turning them in.
so maybe when she left the party... One of our teenage meth cookers.
got worried she'd go to the cops.
so he went after her. - On his bike.
the tire tracks at her house...
he knew where she lived because he'd been there before.
he was one of the other guys Kim was seeing.
we need to talk to Kim's mother.
now that was weird.
usually I do that with Beckett.
Hey, what are you doing here? Hey. I, um...
just wanted to... thank you for all of your help.
with Castle and Alexis.
seemed like you could have done that over the phone.
all right. Talk to me, girlfriend.
tell me what's on your mind.
do you find it odd that Alexis has gone. To everyone but me on this case?
she hasn't gone to perlmutter yet.
Yeah, well, no one does if they can help it.
well, you can't take it personally. No, I know. It's just...
castle and I are about to become a family, which is weird enough as it is, and...
he and Alexis have this whole history. That has nothing to do with me, and it kind of feels like when it comes to the two of them,
I'm always gonna be on the outside.
perfect families don't exist.
it's gonna be up to you.
to find a way to make your baggage. Match their baggage.
it's up to you to make your own history.
Mrs. Tolbert, we're very sorry to intrude.
you have some nerve. I know who you are, what you're trying to do.
look, whatever you may have heard about us, we are not here to tell you that Frank Henson is innocent.
we'd just like to ask you some questions.
questions no one else can answer. Otherwise, we would not bother you.
what questions?
did Kim have problems with any of the other guys she was seeing?
there was no one else. Just Lyle.
and she'd just broken off with him. Well, it's just that.
we had heard that some other boys had stopped by the house.
some boys? Yeah, she was a tutor.
some of her students were embarrassed. That they needed help, so she kept things quiet.
that's who she was. Do you remember these students' names?
I'm not about to let you hang this on one of them.
now you need to leave. - Thank you for your time.
ma'am, just one more question. What subject did Kim tutor?
chemistry.
dad... - I know. Kim tutored chemistry.
so what if one of her students tricked her.
into helping him learn how to cook meth? And when she figured out what he was doing, he killed her.
no, there's something else.
as soon as Mrs. Tolbert said "Chemistry," I remembered.
look at this. Two identical chemistry books.
were found at the scene of the crime.
so maybe the other one belonged to one of her students. Right, but a textbook like this is expensive.
if you lost one, you'd have to pay a fine. You'd want it back.
unless it would implicate you in a murder.
dad, if we figure out whose book this is, we might find our killer.
I don't know if that's possible. I mean, these books are over 15 years old.
it's worth a shot. Actually, some of them are over 20 years old.
but because of budget cuts, we still use them.
can you pull up records all the way back to 1998?
well, even if I can, I probably shouldn't.
perhaps.
a generous donation for new textbooks is in order.
I suppose I could bend the rules.
these are the barcodes from each book.
make it out to "Cash.
where are ya? Let's see...
both of them are actually still in our system.
loaned out September 8th, 1998.
neither was ever returned. - Any way you can figure out who they belonged to?
one was Kim Tolbert's... The poor girl who died.
and the other one? Looks like it belonged to one John Henson.
my God. That's Frank's younger brother.
the chemistry book puts John in Kim's house, but we're gonna need a lot more than that.
to prove he's our killer. These files are all on Frank.
there's not a lot here on John.
how long until Ryan finishes his background check?
he should be calling any minute. Have you managed to find anything that might link John to the murder.
no, but I did find something that links John to Kim.
according to this accident report,
Frank was speeding and got in a car crash in '97.
John was with him. He was hurt pretty badly.
he had to miss a lot of school.
he was taking chemistry that semester, which is probably why he needed tutoring from Kim.
that'll be Ryan.
John Henson. Clean record.
no convictions, no arrests. " Wait.
one arrest in '98, 3 months before Kim was killed, for possession of a controlled substance.
meth?
doesn't say, and the charges were dropped, but this establishes John was involved in drugs.
and if Kim had gone to the police.
saying he was a meth cooker, he wouldn't have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.
that's motive for murder. We need to talk to John.
according to this, he lives in Manhattan.
thank you for coming in, Mr. Henson. Anything for Frank.
of course, at this point, he needs a miracle. I've always supported my brother.
I never wanted to think he could have hurt Kim, but if someone else did this, why haven't they been found by now?
well, maybe no one was looking in the right place.
now how well did you know Kim? Well, I saw her every day at school.
anywhere else? Outside of class?
her house, sometimes. She tutored me.
and were you at her house the day that she died?
no. Why? We were just wondering what your chemistry book was doing at her house.
well, I must have left it there... or forgot it.
and you never asked for it back? I mean, Kim was killed.
somewhere in the middle of your school term. Wouldn't you have needed it?
well, I might have bought a new one.
it was a long time ago. I don't really remember. Why does that matter?
you know, it probably doesn't.
now in your statement, you said you were in your room at the time of Kim's murder, but you didn't hear her scream. That's right.
did you hear any other unusual sounds that night?
not that I can think of. What about the smoke alarm?
Yeah, no, I did hear that.
in Frank's trial testimony, he never mentioned you coming down to the garage, so you were in your room the whole time.
the alarm was going off? - Yes, I was.
now I find that odd, Mr. Henson, because the security company logs show the alarm sounded.
for a full two minutes and 47 seconds.
but you stayed in your room that whole time.
never got up to check and make sure. That the house wasn't burning down?
you never heard the alarm going off, did you? Because you weren't in your house.
what are you saying? That I killed Kim, that I did it?
where were you that night?
I'm not answering any more of your questions.
what is this, guys? I thought we were done.
Mr. Henson, we've, uncovered some new evidence...
evidence that suggests someone else killed Kim Tolbert.
who? Frank, I know this is going to be hard to hear, but we think it could be John.
no. John? Based on what?
his chemistry book was found at the crime scene.
his alibi for where he was when Kim died is falling apart.
what the hell is wrong with you?
I told you to drop it. What do you mean?
Frank, we're really on to something.
and I'm saying get off it. You leave John out of this.
honey, what's wrong with you? If John did this...
he knows.
he knows it was John.
Frank? Is this true?
I...
you knew this whole time?
why would you do this?
why would you throw your life away?
because I threw his away.
okay? I'm the reason why he killed her.
no. Frank, whatever John did, it can't be your fault.
you remember that Camaro I was telling you about?
I rolled that car... With Johnny in it.
I walked away... But he didn't.
after the head injury, he wasn't right for a while.
he started taking drugs.
he got violent.
he'd have these memory lapses. He wouldn't remember what he did.
what really happened that night?
my worst nightmare came true.
it's off now. Thank you.
my God.
What'd you do, John? What'd you do?!
you gotta get out of here.
you hear me? Go back to the house.
get cleaned up. Go! Now!
the next thing I knew, the cops were there.
I mean... what was I supposed to do?
people need to know, Frank. - No, they don't.
and if they ask me, I'm gonna deny it.
they're about to kill you. - I know.
and you're gonna let them, when it was John who did this. Maggie, he doesn't remember.
it took three, four times of him coming here.
for me to realize that he... he doesn't remember anything from that night.
look, I always hoped I'd get off.
on some kind of technicality, you know? Not this.
never this.
he's built a life. He's got a wife.
he's got two kids, and I-I'm not gonna take that away from him.
Frank, please...
I'm sorry. This is the way it's gotta be.
there must be something we can do.
it's not what Frank wants.
but he's innocent, dad, and he's going to die.
tomorrow. I know.
I actually started believing we could save the guy.
and we almost did.
I know how much he loves Maggie.
if he just had more time to think about this, maybe he'd change his mind.
but the clock just ran out.
the clock.
what time was that 911 call again?
neighbor reported hearing the scream at 8: 04 P. M.
Why? We missed something. Come take a look at this photo.
this wall decoration could have fallen down during the struggle.
you mean the solar system thingy? Not just a solar system thingy.
our orbiting planets don't line up like that. This is a binary clock.
that's a clock? - Yeah. For science geeks like Kim.
you count the amount of planets in each quadrant, it tells you the time. In this case, 7: 32.
7: 32? That's a half-hour before our 911 call.
that's because the scream that Frank heard.
came from John we he discovered Kim's body at 8: 04.
she'd already been dead for 30 minutes.
both brothers are innocent.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Kim's mom. You called Kim's mom?
desperate times.
and she didn't hang up on you? - No.
she mostly yelled.
she wouldn't tell me who Kim tutored, but she did say that all the checks
kim got from tutoring went into her college fund.
so she was paid by check.
that means somewhere there's a record of who paid her.
Ryan and Esposito are checking banks now. This is it, dad.
Jasper Grove, meth, the bike tracks...
if it wasn't Frank or John, it has to be one of those other kids.
you still going through that video?
Yeah. Now that we know neither Frank or John killed her, this video plays very differently. Watch this.
see that? No. What?
Frank said he found her body on the floor. Did he ever mention moving her?
no. According to Frank, he just pulled John away.
exactly. Breaking the charm bracelet, spilling the charms on the floor.
but watch as a medical examiner's team.
moves her body for the first time.
see it now? It looks like another charm from her bracelet.
but if the charm bracelet broke after she died, how did the charm end up under her body?
okay, Castle, we got the evidence box from the lab.
what are we looking for? - Okay, the evidence log says.
there should be a bag containing charms.
from Kim's broken charm bracelet. - Got it.
one of those charms should be shaped like a dolphin.
it's here. You should have the rope bracelet there, too.
thread that dolphin charm onto the bracelet.
okay... I'm threading.
Nope. Can't do it. The hole's too small.
it doesn't fit. That's because it didn't come from Kim's bracelet.
it was left behind by our killer. Lanie, can you get DNA off that charm?
maybe, but it won't help unless you have.
someone to match it to.
we need to know who she was tutoring.
you should call them again. I just called them 20 minutes ago.
I don't understand. Why is it taking so long?
Ryan found the bank where Kim had her account hours ago.
the account was closed in '98.
the bank has moved three times since then.
they may not have even kept the files. - And what if they didn't?
we're running out of time. We need to go to the judge. - With what?
Frank will never admit to covering for John. That would put John at the crime scene.
so what do we do? Dad, tell me what to do!
Hey, I don't know, but whatever happens, we're gonna deal with it.
all right? Together.
I'm sorry I was mad at you.
no.
I deserved it. I'm sorry.
yes? What are the names?
chief Lane. - Can I help you?
no, chief. But we can help you.
this little dolphin pendant.
was found in Kim Tolbert's living room the night she died, underneath her body.
so? So it's not hers.
you people are unbelievable. Officer Lane, how old were you when Kim died?
excuse me? - You were in her class.
in fact, she tutored you, didn't she? What's this all about?
checks you wrote to Kim Tolbert, chief, to pay for your son's tutoring.
needed some help keeping his grades up. Yeah, I bet because of swim team.
you guys took state that year. It was big news.
Teddy, what's going on here?
the night Kim Tolbert was murdered, she was in Jasper Grove, near a farmhouse you had foreclosed on a year earlier.
that house was later found to be contaminated. With methamphetamine residue.
we believe your son was one of the people who contaminated it.
we also believe he wanted to be tutored in chemistry.
so he could learn how to cook meth. This is ridiculous.
but Kim caught on to you, and that was bad for business.
so when she left that party, you followed her.
we found ammonium nitrate on her body.
I'd be willing to bet that the tire treads. Outside the farmhouse are going to be a match to the bike treads behind Kim's house.
the night of her murder.
and then, of course, there's that.
now that's enough circumstantial evidence.
for a judge... But it's 2013.
I mean, now we can even take degraded DNA, have it amplified, tested.
and I'm sure that your evidence storage.
has kept your dolphin well preserved.
say something.
look at me.
based on the overwhelming circumstantial evidence.
and the exculpatory results.
obtained from post-conviction DNA testing, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby vacates
Franklin Thomas Henson's murder conviction.
and sanctions his exoneration.
I'm sure you've spent far too many years.
having judges look down on you, so I'll come down from the bench and deliver.
the signed order of dismissal myself.
thank you.
I thought it was you.
all this time, you were protecting me.
how can you ever forgive me?
forgive you?
I love you.
I'm just ready to live, brother.
what you did here was amazing.
thank you...
for everything.
anytime.
you ready? Don't you want to stay and celebrate?
no.
this is enough.
besides, there's someone else I need to thank.
did you see that tunic Professor Jablonski was wearing yesterday in advanced draping? I know.
it was very "Sad Cat Lady meets David Bowie.
this is what it's come to - dumpster-diving to find fabric for our midterm haute couture project.
well, you know what they say: One man's trash is another man's
I think I found something. Oh! Me too!
Ooh! It's stuck.
that's because we're both tugging on it.
let go. I had it first.
Oh, this fabric is just to die for.
this would look stunning on you - just stunning.
Ah, you know... I...
I am just trying to expose Katherine to the glorious world of wedding magazines.
they are all very girly, with a lot of gauzy photos of love-struck brides looking off into the distance.
perhaps they're contemplating the 50% divorce rate.
you need to get beyond the fairytale-treacle aspect of these magazines and see them for what they are
a source of ideas as you plan your wedding.
Yeah.
like this place. The Cordova House?
uh, "a landmark Spanish revival mansion with an elegant carriage-house exterior.
it was built at the turn of the century, "remains an enduring legacy of architectural beauty in the heart of Manhattan.
Aha. I remember the Cordova House.
it was like a cultural venue for the arts in the '70s.
I think I went to a party there
of course, it was the '70s, so I can't be sure.
This????
and they've started to book weddings. I love it. It's gorgeous.
could it be that we've stumbled upon a venue???
Yeah! I mean, I'm good with it. Are you?
you're welcome.
Ah! Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Sorry.
I'm gonna make, um... some inquiries right now.
uh, you're gonna have to do it while we're working a case.
okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right.
apparently, we aren't the only ones who read that article.
the event planner at the Cordova House Said they've been swamped with calls.
okay. When's their next available date? She said she's gonna call me back.
Hey, Espo, what have we got?
a body found by two fashion students Dumpster-diving for fabric.
victim's name is Ella Hayes. She's 26.
according to her driver's license, ???? What's she doing down here in the garment district?
she was???
her business card says that she works for Modern Fashion.
she's an assistant to the editor-in-chief. Yeah, that would be Matilda King.
okay. Seriously? You've never heard of Matilda King?
I'm betting that most real men haven't.
mm, yes, if by "real" you mean "uninformed." whatever.
Matilda King is a legend in the fashion industry.
or infamous - depends on your point of view.
Yes. Former assistants of hers have written books about how tough she is.
a dragon lady - chews people up and spits them out.
does she also strangle 'em? 'cause that's how Lanie said our vic died.
Hey, Lanie. Hey.
so, the murder weapon was a scarf, a sash, or something.
okay. When did this happen? Based on lividity, between 12: 00 and 2: 00 a. m.
I also recovered some blue hairs on her neck. Left by the attacker.
blue hairs? So she was killed by a little old lady?
Or...Katy Perry.
animal hairs that were died blue, Castle.
or... A dr. Seuss character.
I don't recall any of them being homicidal.
that's true. I need a new theory.
well, I've got one. Our killer was strong
and he or she was able to lift the body into the dumpster.
Espo, can you get uniforms to canvass the area for any witnesses?
castle and I will go to her work. You and ryan head off to her place
if there is anything that'll indicate why she was here last night. Right on.
Ella and I went to parsons together.
and then we've been roommates for the past two years.
I still can't believe this.
when was the last time you saw her?
yesterday in the moring
she was up at 5: 00, like always, and then out the door
to get Matilda's coffee and cranberry scone ???
what about after work - did you see her then?
no I'm a buyer at Saks, so I don't get home till late.
did Ella have a boyfriend or a relationship?
no.
she was on call for Matilda 24,
so she didn't have time for relationships...
or for the one thing that she really wanted to do.
which was what? Design.
she hoped working at Modern Fashion???
was Ella having any problems that you know of?
um... She had been stressed lately, A little more than usual.
I ask ??? She said it was work, but she didn't go into details.
lilian, if you don't mind, I'd like to have an officer come by and take your statement.
of course. Anything I can do to help.
Oh, we don't get cell reception in here.
you can use my landline if you like. Thanks.
here's my card.
if you can remember anything else, Please give me a call, okay?
Yeah. Thank you.
well, this is it
the big leagues for anyone who wants to work in fashion.
Wow. Apparently, you have to be a total hottie just work here
and I'm saying that as a completely detached,
soon-to-be-married observer.
it's okay, Castle. Stare all you want. Really?
actually, no. But it's kind of hard not to.
I mean, Matilda only hires people that fit the magazine's brand. You have to...Look the part.
you seem to know a lot about Matilda King. Yeah, well, I've picked up a thing or two.
Hi. Nypd. We need to speak with Matilda King.
do you have?? oh, I think you missed the part about the Nypd.
please.
I just???
she's going to freak out if I add you to the schedule.
do you have any idea what happened to the last assistant? Yes. She's dead.
dead? What do you mean?
no, no, no, no. Oh, god. Here she comes.
I won't take no for an answer. You must join us on the yacht.
giorgio will show his new collection. Gordon ramsay is cooking.
lady gaga is performing.
pushing the boundaries of style - No doubt, in the wrong direction.
so, let me know.
new assistant. It's carrie.
I'll learn your name when you've earned it. Here.
Oh, uh, these are your messages,
and Julian Bruckner is waiting in your office.
and who is this?
Uh...Nypd.
we need to ask you a few questions, Ms. King.
I never could forget those cheekbones.
uh, what - you two know each other?
uh...Yeah. Yeah.
when I was a model... For about 15 minutes.
you modeled for Modern Fashion?
I offered her a spread in the January '99 issue.
Nicole kidman was on the cover. And you passed.
to date, you're the only person to ever tell me no.
I'm wall-to-wall. We'll have to reschedule.
uh, get ready to be told no again.
we need to ask you a few questions about your assistant, Ella Hayes.
it cannot wait. We'll talk in my office. Hold my calls
by the way, Ella is my former assistant.
be right with you, Julian.
okay.
uh, so, what do you mean by "former"?
I fired her yesterday afternoon, After she made a scheduling mistake
and I showed up to a board meeting late.
and that was after her mistake last week,
when I kept the new owner of our magazine waiting for 45 minutes.
Matilda, have you seen the proofs from the "fab five" photo shoot?
they are divine. They'd better be, Julian.
so far, everything you've submitted???
Oh, Matilda, these designers are barely out of diapers.
e- excuse me. Sorry.
we're investigating a murder here.
murder? Of whom?
your former assistant, Ella.
El- Ella's dead? How?
that's what we're trying to figure out. Now, do you know if she had any problems?
you don't think this had anything to do
with that incident with Grace? What incident?
and who's Grace?
grace is my other assistant, whom I fired
because she allowed the scheduling mistakes to happen. And what was the incident?
well, apparently, yesterday, when Ella and Grace were escorted out of the building by security,
they literally got into a brawl, Right in the middle of a photo shoot.
the photographer, serge, had to break it up.
Serge: Yeah. The two of them really went at it.
I mean, it was a full-on catfight. It was actually kind of sexy.
what exactly was the fight about?
it was about the job ok?
I overheard Grace blame Ella for - for getting her fired.
Yumi: Serge! How long??
I'm up against a deadline to finish my design.
you'll be here as long as it takes to make Matilda happy.
the mantra we all live by.
uh, did you remember any other details about the fight?
I can do better than that. I can show you something.
I was shooting at that time
and got a few frames with them in the background.
there. Check it out.
can...you zoom in on that?
sure. Check out Grace's scarf.
Lanie said she found blue hairs on Ella's neck
from being strangled. Looks like Grace was dressed to kill.
look, I grew up reading Modern Fashion.
working for Matilda King, that was my dream.
but when Matilda fires someone, people remember,
which means my career in fashion is pretty much done, thanks ella
because you believed it was her fault that you got fired.
it was her fault
she started making mistakes because she was so busy
sucking up to designers like Yumi And showing off her sketches, and I paid the price.
which is why you killed her. What are you even talking about?
we got in a fight. That was it.
okay, okay. Then explain this.
this blue alpaca scarf was found at your apartment.
it's an exact match to the hairs found on Ella's neck after she was strangled.
come on. Other people have that scarf.
Yeah, but you're the only one with motive.
it was the christmas gift from Modern Fashion.
we all???
maybe Ella was wearing hers and someone choked her with it.
where were you between 12: 00 and 2: 00 a. M. Grace?
I'd just gotten fired. Some friends took me out and got me drunk.
you can ask them. I will. In the meantime, let's talk about Ella.
her roommate thought that she was having trouble????
you worked with her. You know what it was?
actually, there was something else.
a few days ago, at lunchtime,
I saw her arguing with this guy outside the building.
did you recognize him? I'd never seen him before.
but I overheard them, and he was threatening her.
he said she had something he wanted and he wouldn't take no for an answer.
and what was her reaction? She said she was gonna call the police，If he didn't leave her the hell alone,
and then he stormed off.
I- I tried to ask her what it was all about, But ???
do you remember him well enough to help us with a sketch?
I think so. Okay, this is the guy who threatened Ella.
so, you believe Grace's story? Well her???
and unis found two witnesses that saw him arguing with Ella.
Ella was basically a glorified assistant.
what could she possibly have had that this man wanted?
well, think about it, Castle.
Matilda king is the most influential person in fashion,
and Ella had direct access to her world.
so you're saying this man leveraged Ella
to find out what direction hemlines are going next season?
Ooh! I just came up with a new title. "murder is the new black.
does that even make sense?
no it doesn't ???
did you guys find something at Ella's apartment? You could say that.
I went to use the landline, and I noticed some static when I got near a lamp.
when we popped that lamp open, look what we found inside. A bug?
why would someone bug Ella's apartment?
Because...She is "la femme nikita,
and her job at Modern Fashion is just a cover.
she's not "la femme nikita.
still, wiretaps, threats from mysterious men, murder
whatever's going on here, it's bigger than fashion. Okay, see if you can get a serial number.
let's figure out who bought that bug. Yeah.
all right. Thank you very much.
that was the event planner at the cordova house.
they said they still have a few spots open in the fall.
she can give us a tour tonight. Whoo-hoo! Let's do it.
so, where are we on watergate? So, the plot thickens.
the building manager at Ella's apartment Remembers letting an exterminator into her place
usually, exterminators get rid of bugs.
only this one didn't. The company that he worked for doesn't exist.
I mean, what is this about, Castle? Why would someone target Ella?
well, you already heard and rejected my theory.
Yeah, but your theory doesn't explain the little detail That Lanie just found out.
there's black coral on the sole of Ella's shoe, And it wasn't from the dumpster.
well, that doesn't make any sense. Black coral is found in the tropics.
exactly. So how did this end up on her shoe?
yo, Beckett.
and Castle. Sure.
???? But we got a hit off the canvass of the crime scene.
a seamstress coming off the late shift. Right near the alley where Ella was killed.
we get a description? Yeah, and he matches our sketch.
Yes. That's him.
??? Outside the broadway coffee shop when I walked by.
and what time was this?
just after???
do you recall how tall he was, what he wore?
fabric is my business.
he wore a dark suit - nice quality, wool blend.
Oh, and he had a distinctive striped tie
crimson and navy with gold triangles across the stripes.
that sounds like a club tie.
crimson and navy - yes, I know that one. Gold triangles. That's the carlton club tie.
if we can match that sketch to one of its members, we got our I. D.
yeah except ??? Are notoriously protective of keeping their members' privacy.
they're not just gonna hand over that information.
the club won't, no, but one of its members might.
after a tough negotiation that involved my Knicks tickets
and naming a character in my next book after his nana,
my friend came up with a name - Marcus Conway.
okay, so, what do we know about him? He is a lawyer at kellerman goodfriend.
that's one of the city's biggest law firms.
why is a high-powered lawyer going after Ella? Maybe it has to do with her work.
turns out???? Is general counsel for couture chick magazine.
that's "chic," and not that you would know,
but they are Modern Fashion's biggest competitor.
call Conway's firm. I want to know where he is.
detective, I would think very carefully. Before making these kinds of accusations.
Mr. Conway, I am not making any accusations. I am simply stating fact.
we have a witness that heard you threatening Ella Hayes
and another one that saw you near where she was killed.
right about the same time she ended up that way.
you need to explain yourself. Gloria: Marcus, I heard the police are here.
what's going on? Who are you?
G. RI'm editor-in-chief of couture chic.
they think I murdered Ella Hayes. What? That's ridiculous.
so YOU???
this is obviously one huge misunderstanding. Then clear it up.
tell me what you know about Ella Hayes.
we approached Ella and attempted to...
engage her services.
so, basically, you tried to hire her to get inside information on Modern Fashion.
I wouldn't put it that way. Well, I'm pretty sure she would,
which is why she turned you down.
and you wouldn't take no for an answer.
look, this is a competitive business. With everyone looking to get an edge.
Yes, I was aggressive in trying to make a deal,
but when she refused accepted that, and I never contacted her again.
then why were you less than a block away
from where she was killed at about the time she died?
because she called me. She asked me to meet her last night.
why would she do that? Probably because Matilda just fired her.
the bottom line is, she said she had Bombshell information on Modern Fashion
information that, if it got out, it would destroy the magazine.
Mr. Conway, I took a look at Ella's cellphone records.
she never called you last night.
she did call, and I can prove it. She left me a message.
Hey, it's Ellai changed my mind about your offer.
I find out something. Something that'll ruin Modern Fashion,
take down the whole operation. Meet me at the broadway coffee shop in an hour.
I waited around for two hours, but she never showed.
what information did she want to share?
what were you trying to hire her to find out?
as you may have heard, A tech-venture capitalist named Glen Carter
bought Modern Fashion last month.
Glen has big plans To drag Matilda's precious little magazine????
which are? Well, that's what we wanted to know,
since our website has failed to generate new subscription business.
if we could get Modern Fashion's new playbook,
it could help us strategize and stay one step ahead.
so, you wanted to hire Ella So that she could tell you about the new direction the magazine was taking, and when she turned you down, that was the extent of your contact?
until she called last night. And what about the eavesdropping?
w- what are you talking about?
we found a listening device in Ella's apartment.
that wasn't us. We had nothing to do with that.
so, these records explain why we missed Ella's phone calls
to Marcus Conway. She phoned him using her roommate's landline.
so, she told Conway to meet her in the coffee shop in an hour.
it would take her about 20 minutes to get there from her apartment,
so she must have been killed on the way there.
looking at her designs, Ella actually had talent.
Yeah, well, the question is, what did she know,
and did someone kill her to keep her quiet?
RYAN: Well, I can't help you out there, But I can tell you that Marcus Conway
was telling the truth about not planting that bug.
Yeah, the serial number led us to a distributor，Named alternate intelligence in queens.
do they ???
James Kavanaugh paid for that listening device with a credit card a month ago.
and when does it get interesting?
when we found out he was former special forces and,
not to mention, the head of security at Modern Fashion.
wait a minute - Ella was being spied on by her own magazine?
Oh, Beckett, we have that appointment at the cordova house.
Oh, Castle, I'm sorry. Duty calls. Can - can you go without me
and see if it's as good as the pictures?
you trust me to make this decision on my own? Can you go with martha?
we have to bring james kavanaugh in. Yeah.
I'm in the security business. I buy lots of equipment.
Yeah, well, this equipment was a listening device
that you installed in Ella Hayes' apartment.
if you think that, you're mistaken.
really
because we showed your picture to the super at Ella's building, and he identified you
as the exterminator he let into her apartment.
I had nothing to do with what happened to Ella Hayes.
you broke into her place, you wired it for sound, And now she's dead?
James? Think about how that looks, bro.
your best bet is to tell us exactly what you know.
all I did was bug her place, okay?
I mean, once Glen Carter bought the magazine,
home monitoring got to be a common practice.
so, Glen Carter ordered the surveillance? No.
no, he didn't know anything about it.
it was ordered by Matilda King.
you sure about that? Yes, I'm sure.
she got all freaked out about someone coming after her job,
so she said she didn't know who she could trust anymore.
okay, so, who monitored the audio from Ella's apartment?
Matilda had me set it up So that it fed directly to her computer.
you realize what this means?
Yeah.
Ella called Marcus Conway on the landline,
told him she could take down the magazine, And Matilda heard the whole thing.
okay. Thank you very much.
so, the guard in the lobby of the Modern Fashion building
saw Matilda leave there last night at 11: 30, And she was in a big hurry.
well, ???? that's right after Ella called Marcus Conway.
Matilda knew that Ella was about to spill the beans And bring down the magazine.
so Matilda went to stop her.
she's our killer.
wait, wait, wait. She's on a call. She can call back.
Matilda: Glen, this magazine is not about tweets or likes on facebook,
for god's sake!
for 57 years, Women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!
whenever they've had a bad day at work or at home,
they've come to us!
we are their escape! We are their fantasy!
it's the clothing that stitches it all together.
that's what matters.
we're done here. glen!
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
you've got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.
it's not temper. It's frustration.
Glen Carter, our new owner, Cares more about money than fashion.
is that why you were paranoid he was gonna replace you?
I don't know what you've heard, but I'm Matilda King.
my name is synonymous with this magazine.
he wouldn't dare replace me.
so then why did you order the monitoring
of all of your employees' conversations The moment that he bought the magazine?
you are quite the detective.
take a seat.
since the purchase, rumors have been swirling.
I'd like to think that they're just rumors, But I can't afford to take that chance.
I need to know my people are loyal.
by bugging their homes?
with their permission.
we've had some loyalty issues, So my lawyers added some fine print to their employment agreements.
do you actually believe that's gonna fly in court?
my lawyers seem to think so.
now, what does this have to do with your investigation?
look, given the rumors about your job, It must have been disconcerting to find out Ella was taking damaging information on Modern Fashion
to what are you referring? What information?
but what we do know is moments after she made the arrangements
to sell that information, You were seen running out of here.
you think that I ran out of here to kill Ella?
your head of security says that you're set up
to listen to these recordings live on your computer.
something I do on the weekend.
I'm a little busy running a magazine during the week.
Yeah, a position that you're desperate to defend. That's motive and that's opportunity.
I ran out of my office last night
because I was late for drinks with Oscar Delarenta.
feel free to check.
regarding Ella's threat to the magazine,
I never heard her say that.
and you have no idea what Ella was taking to the competition?
none.
but if you find out, I'd be curious to know.
anything else, detective?
I'm gonna need those recordings.
Hey, Beckett. Matilda's alibi checks out.
she was having drinks with Oscar until about 2: 00 a. m.
so Matilda's not our killer?
and we still don't know what explosive information
Ella was taking to the competition. Right.
I think I may have found something on these audio files
that might shed light on that.
???? About a week of inane conversations????
but she did place a call on the day of the murder
that was pretty strange. Check it out.
Hey. It's me - Ella.
something weird is going on inside Modern Fashion.
I think someone's targeting me. I need your help. Call me back.
do we know who's on the other end of that call?
based on the landline phone records, The call was placed to someone at Modern Fashion,
but it was routed through a switchboard, So it doesn't show who she was connected to.
this directory lists over 100 people that work there.
Yeah.
lucky I have crazy-good hearing. Listen to the beginning again.
I had a tech analyze those beeps
and connect them to the corresponding digits.
the call was placed to this extension.
he's an I. T. tech at Modern Fashion? Mm-hmm.
what was Ella doing calling him for help?
we were friends, you know?
to most of the people here, I'm invisible, but Ella saw me.
she was nice.
why did she need your help the day she died?
she wanted me to look at Matilda's calendar.
what for? Because Matilda missed some important meetings,
but Ella was sure she entered them into the calendar correctly.
she wanted to know if the calendar had been tampered with. And - and was it?
??? Several entries had been changed over the past couple weeks
all in the middle of the night.
when I showed it to her,
she was convinced that someone was trying to set her up.
well, were you able to tell who made those changes?
I tracked them all to an I. P. address outside Modern Fashion.
it's the best I could do.
???? And she said she was gonna figure out who set her up...
and make them pay.
next I hear, she's dead.
do you still have that I. P. address?
Yeah. Okay. I'll have a tech run it down.
but why would anyone want to sabotage a fashion assistant? I don't know, Espo.
if Ella went after whoever's behind this,
all right, well, I'll give you a call when I get a location.
okay. Thanks.
more questions, detective?
actually, we found evidence that suggests
Ella wasn't responsible for screwing up your appointments.
someone else changed your calendar - Someone outside of this office.
are you saying that I fired Ella for no reason?
do you know why someone would have done this to her?
no.
but I do know why someone would want to do this to me. What do you mean?
ever since Glen Carter bought Modern Fashion, The sharks have been circling. They smell blood.
so the calendar mistakes made you look bad at a critical time?
excuse me.
Oh, this is just what I need. What's wrong?
I have to make a decision in the next half-hour
about a dress this issue, and the model didn't show up. Oh.
detective Beckett.
you said "no" to me years ago when I offered you a job.
might you do a little favor for me now?
Oh, richard, look at these beautiful antique chandeliers.
so, if you're interested,
I have a couple of slots for fall 2015 still open.
excuse me. Did you say "fall 2015"?
that's correct. When we spoke on the phone,
I thought...We were speaking of...This fall.
no way. That's been booked for months.
uh, excuse me, but I have to take this call.
look around, and I'll be right back.
Ugh. Well, it is a beautiful venue.
and it's a long time to wait.
Yeah, and a long time to plan.
I just feel like I've waited long enough, mother.
I- I don't want to waste any more time. Before we take the next step.
and???
I'm sure there's another venue out there
that the two of you will just fall in love with.
thank you.
okay.
this never happens, But the friedmans just called off their wedding,
and we now have an opening for spring.
Spring...2016?
no, this spring.
uh, I have a long list of couples
that would snatch this up immediately,
but since you're here...
do you need any help in there?
when you asked me to try on a dress and I said yes,
I had no idea it was gonna be this kind of a dress.
what do you think?
it's amazing. Yeah?
the embroidery.
and the austrian crystal.
it's just - just heavenly.
Yeah. It is, isn't it?
come.
well, t-this probably would have looked better on the model that didn't show up.
no, don't be silly. It's perfect on you.
trust me. I'm an expert.
in FACT??? This is exactly the kind of dress I would want for her.
you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday.
thank you.
??? We're ready for the accessories spread in the conference room.
excuse me. I'll be back in five minutes.
Hey. How's the venue.
amazing. Yeah, so amazing.
and they didn't have any spots open until fall of 2015????
and their unfortunate misery can be our lifelong joy.
we can take their spot for the spring.
the spring. Wow.
I know. And there's a lot of couples who want it.
but if I put down a deposit tonight, it's ours.
so, what do you say?
Beckett, are you there?
Yeah.
okay, but I-I thought we agreed that the venue was amazing.
Yeah, we did. It's just I started thinking about the details and the planning that we have to do, and I just - I don't want to rush any of this.
okay. If you're sure that's it.
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I
I mean, we're gonna find another venue, Castle????
Look????
so, a tech was able to track down that I. P. address.
whoever changed that calendar did it from a design studio in Soho.
is there any connection between the studio and Modern Fashion? As a matter of fact, there is.
it belongs to one of the designers being featured in Modern Fashion's "fab five" spread - Yumi.
Yumi what?
I guess if you don't have a last name, you can charge more.
so, why would he or someone from his studio
be changing Matilda's calendar? I don't know, but I can tell you this.
it looks like Ella may have been there the night she was killed.
how do you know that? Yumi's website.
the current design line being produced at his studio
features dresses embellished with coral,
and, in addition to the fact that this model is hot, she's wearing black coral.
the same kind of coral that Lanie found stuck to the bottom of Ella's shoe. Let's go.
I'm probably gonna have to call her in for an interrogation.
Yumi: No, sweetie.
you tell little miss all that Yumi says there's only one diva in this room.
if she doesn't want to wear the pink louboutins, she is out of the show.
models.
the lack of food makes them so very fraught.
uh, Mr. Yumi - please, just Yumi.
okay. Yumi.
when was the last time you saw Ella Hayes? Ella Hayes?
Matilda's assistant - the girl who was killed?
Yes, of course. Well, we have reason to believe that she was here last night.
Yes. She was.
why was she here?
she, uh, she came to ask me for a job. Really?
I told her I wanted to help, But there was absolutely nothing I could do.
when Matilda King fires someone, they are radioactive.
do you have any idea why she was fired? No.
I think you do.
someone changed Matilda King's calendar.
Matilda thought it was Ella, but it wasn't ella. It was someone from your studio.
we traced the I. P. address. So did Ella
that's what she was doing here last night.
she wasn't asking for a job.
she was looking to find who made those changes
who ruined her career. And given the fact that you just lied to us,
I am guessing it was you.
me?
do you have any idea how powerful Matilda King is
in the fashion industry? My design is a "fab five" winner.
Matilda's about to make me famous.
messing with her would be career suicide.
what could possibly be my motive?
Oh, it's simple. You needed to get her fired.
you needed to discredit her.
why on earth would I do that?
because your winning "fab five" design...
...isn't yours.
from Ella's sketchbook. They're exactly the same.
Ella was an aspiring designer. She must have copied me.
no. Ella's roommate Saw her making those sketches months ago.
okay, then.
if you found it in her sketchbook,
then how did I get it?
well, Matilda's other assistant, Grace,
confirmed seeing Ella give you copies of her sketches.
apparently, you had them on you When you went in on your "fab five" pitch meeting.
and from there, the story writes itself.
you showed your designs, And they just weren't good enough to make the cut,
but then the artistic director sees these in your bag
the fresh, stunning, raw talent - Perfect for the "fab five.
except they weren't your designs.
only two people knew that - you and Ella.
and being a "fab five" designer. Could literally make your career,
once you were chosen for the "fab five,
you realized that Ella would know you had stolen her designs.
you had to discredit her so that no one would believe her.
I want a lawyer.
Ella must have confronted Yumi at his studio.
if she threatened to expose the whole scandal, his career would be over.
he had to kill her to hide the truth. Yeah. That all makes sense.
now we just have to connect him to the crime scene.
only one problem - you can't.
Yumi didn't kill Ella. How do you know?
multiple employees saw Ella confront Yumi,
but after she took off, he was at the studio till 3: 00 a. M.
wait. Are you - are you sure? His alibi????
but we know someone changed Matilda's calendar
from that studio. He has to be involved somehow.
I think someone else was, too.
I went through Yumi's phone records, And after Ella left,
he made half a dozen phone calls to Modern Fashion.
such beautiful designs.
after all this time, I had no idea.
if she knew these designs had been stolen, maybe she didn't think you would listen
at least, not to someone like her. Maybe she just wanted revenge.
if couture chi exposed that our "fab five" list was corrupt,
it would have cost me my job. Who else stood to lose?
everyone involved, I suppose.
well, just after Ella left Yumi's studio,
he made a series of phone calls to someone here at Modern Fashion.
someone who must have known Yumi's secret
who was helping him cover it up. Someone who knew that if the truth got out,
it could destroy them both.
there's only one person it could be.
who?
we go to print in one week on this issue, and I'm still not happy with the cover options.
and we're still not there with the "fab five" spread!
now, go, please, make it better!
Julian, a word.
what was your first reaction When you saw Yumi's design submission?
blown away. I mean, that's why I nominated him.
now, is there a reason why you didn't come to me and tell me when he confessed to you that he stole Ella's design?
what do you mean? I had a word with Yumi this morning.
he told me you've known for a while.
and he also said it was your idea to change my calendar.
he's lying.
then I spoke to Mr. Carter, and he confirmed my suspicion.
you've been gunning for my job.
??? It proves that you tried to kill two birds with one stone.
you changed my calendar in order to discredit Ella.
you don't know what you're talking about. Don't even.
you're fired.
I can walk out of here and get hired at any magazine I want by the end of the day.
you won't be applying for a new job anytime soon, Julian.
Oh, my...
this is ridiculous. Matilda King
she takes pleasure in torturing people like this.
fact is, her story is as crazy as she is.
except we searched the dumpsters around your apartment, and we found Ella's scarf
the one that you used to strangle her.
the lab also found two sets of DNA on that scarf
Ella's and yours.
I'm not gonna say another word until my lawyer's present.
RYAN: So, what did the D. A. Say?
that Julian's gonna plead not guilty, take his chances at a trial.
the good news is Yumi cut a deal to avoid charges.
I guess murder is not his type of accessory.
Yeah. He confessed to telling Julian
and Julian told him that he would take care of her.
so, I guess the "fab five" is gonna be the "fab four" this year.
I always thought the fashion industry seemed glamorous.
turns out, mobsters are more ethical.
Oh, my gosh. Why do you think I quit?
I'll take murderers over models any day.
if only murderers were this hot.
I got a bit of paperwork to do.
Ah! Boring paperwork.
that is my cue to leave.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you when I'm done.
Hey. Shall I pour you a glass?
uh, no. Not right now.
everything all right?
babe, we have to talk.
Wow. That's something people say before they deliver bad news.
...you know when you called last night about the venue?
I was with Matilda, and she wanted me to model a dress.
and it was a wedding dress.
and when I saw myself in it, I just - I started to think about my mom.
she would have loved to have been a part of all of this,
to help pick out the flowers and try on the dresses and...
when I looked at myself in the mirror, I just
I- I halfway expected to see her right behind me... - and she wasn't there!
and, just for a moment, I thought to myself, "I don't know if I can do all of this without her.
and that's why I said no when you asked about the venue.
I'm so sorry. It was so stupid.
no.
no, not stupid.
human.
do you know what else I wish she could experience?
you.
Really? Yeah.
she would have loved you.
you know, Kate... If you need more time
no. No, I don't - I don't need any more time.
I don't even want us to wait until the fall.
I think we can find a new venue in the spring.
you think we can pull it off? Yeah.
I mean, I already have the dress.
I am one of those well paid. Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle. - Castle. Castle.
- I am a crash, is not it?
every writer needs inspiration. And I found mine.
detective Kate Beckett.
Nikki fervor? - The character inspired by you.
and thanks to my friendship with the mayor, I managed to follow his case.
I would be happy to let me spank you.
and together, we stop murderers.
we're a good team, you know? Like Starsky and Hutch, Turner and Hooch.
- In fact I remember a little Hooch.
girls, beautiful, be sexy, not a crime.
what's' special about crime writer world-famous Richard Castle?
and he is rich, beautiful and is basing his next best-selling book about her.
tell me, detective Beckett, how it feels to be the inspiration for the master of the yellow Richard Castle, for his new character, Nikki fervor?
on behalf of the department, and I can say that's a pleasure to offer to Mr. Castle the opportunity to comply the profession from within.
given all the best-seller, and obviously Castle is able to understand the minds of criminals.
I have said many times its collaboration was fundamental to solve your cases' difficult.
Really? She has heard this?
and who's' been? - Castle!
try to unbutton his shirt, the top button, ok?
can excuse me a moment?
Lord.
I speak a second in private, please?
cop Beckett, I have a couple of ... - Time.
we had an agreement, Beckett.
the agreement is skipped. - What's the problem?
not only has the twins cop stag using it as a pole lap-dance while I make nice with the press. - But he heard what he said? - No.
he said it's ground state in helping to resolve cases.
well, it's not been?
not the point.
know how it is difficult for Department be good publicity?
intend in newspapers people read really.
these articles are very important for the mayor.
therefore, we must cooperate.
I was clear?
OK, fine.
it has been a pleasure to meet you.
we should make the services most cameras often.
Beckett, why not wearing too uniform like that?
because I will not be paid with one-dollar bills.
were not we supposed to do that?
no.
come on, that thing with that guy.
Oh, yeah！ The thing with the guy! - All right, sorry.
I would just tell you that I have nothing to do with it.
I mean, the newspaper was e...the mayor thought it was good publicity.
you must not justify.
Really? - Really.
see? Most do not care.
now if you'll excuse me, I have an interview to go.
what have I done so wrong?
one thing that we had asked not to do.
Iet's not to investigate the murder of your mother, but look what I found!
no matter what you've discovered, I put all that behind long ago.
we can resume the interview now.
no, you have to postpone. They found a dead body.
I am sorry to go, Amy.
but joking? perfect!
the chance to see Castle in action ... readers love it.
we do not want to disappoint your readers, real detective?
we can talk about it, please?
there 'nothing to talk about.
at least tell me how can I be forgiven.
I can leave in peace - Yes, I tried and did not work.
I could buy you a pony!
concentrates, Castle. Crime Scene Investigation, okay?
raining men.
castle, what are you doing here?
quiet, we are still angry with him.
a guy on a tree, mom and dad that fight, just like old times.
how are things up there?
I have classes that I sting tits spotlights that illuminate my butt.
could be worse.
you could wear a skirt.
when you go down, I slapped him.
I can not wait. - Here.
the victim is a white male, over thirty-five.
judging from the broken branches, I think he Superman made from the roof of that building.
his name was John Allen, the documents say that he lived on the Upper West Side.
the business card says that he's an insurer.
suicide?
it's not suicide.- It's not suicide.
how do you know?
the building is too low. He wanted to kill himself, not to become a cripple.
if you want to die, look for concrete, not a tree.
and judging from the corner fall, I'd say it was thrown from the building.
given that, clearly, not suicide, come dead?
there are signs of strangulation. It seems that the trachea is crushed.
signs of restraint? - No.
restraint refers to something that binds and string, like a rope or a belt.
the absence of signs suggests that it was strangled with bare hands.
really knows his business. I wonder that they keep with them.
know? It's an incredible resource, and almost a shame that wastes his talent on the field.
you will be returned to the morgue with Dr. Parish to see if we can find vittma on something else?
do not you think I'd be more useful the crime scene?
Oh, no. Only knock on doors and we'll see if we can stir something.
you know, the boring things the police.
well.
but I was serious about the ponies.
come, I will show ... the autobitorio.
there was nothing in the wallet? - No.
received the laundry, ID card and two credit cards.
there is no money.
he did a lot of road to be just a robbery.
it means that we travel with the corpse?
can sit in front of my place.
it's sure? - I'm used to attend corpses.
hello.
you can not say "hello," I'm just doing a favor to the girl.
you too, eh?
well, what did you expect?
Beckett spent the first three years as a policeman trying to solve the murder of his mother. Then he took all his willpower to let anyone behind. Can not respect them?
what was I supposed to do? Do not tell him what I discovered?
discovered? - Oh, I told you, right?
three people were killed in the same way his mother, in the same period.
one of them was his old law student.
another was an employee drawing up documents.
the third was a lawyer for a company profit.
wait, the coroner at the time no connects the facts?
if she did, she hid him.
we've talked about? - He died four years ago.
now you see why I had to tell him.
what did he say?
we had closed.
then and round ...
do not move! Do not move!
take the body!
go! Go! Go!
come on, come on! Come on!
it's me, or exactly was very very strange?
well? - Survive.
what, no damage to the brain?
it has, and success before tonight and probably if they facts alone.
Ah. Good times.
how is Lois Lane? - Who, the journalist?
we have collected the deposition and we sent home.
we issued a statement to the sedan, the science is sifting the roof, and agents are looking for movies cameras on the scene.
what I do not understand and: Who that would steal a corpse?
Oh, a lot of people.
thieves organs, medical students without a corpse, Satanists, mad scientists looking create their own monster.
or the one who killed him, that may have left some evidence.
boring. What say you, maybe he was a spy having swallowed a Microchip top secret ...
killed by the enemy before the CIA could get in touch with him?
as we all appreciate your theories witty and incredibly credible and "Miss Cosmos" left, then I think you can go home now.
at home? No. No, no. Case and it's just interesting facts.
E. . and I am a witness.
OK, leave you work this single case with me, if you promise to let alone when we finished and not groped to regain my confidence with some tricks.
deal. But I warn you, detective ...
I'll make change your mind.
I will not do. - Instead it.
so what is the next step, the family of the victim?
I did not think it would have taken with you.
ms. Allen? - It?
we are here for her husband.
was right here only a couple of hours ago, and now and dead. I ...
knows why he was across town?
no.
his office is... downtown, away from Ninth Street.
at what time he was coming out?
around 18. Had just returned from his trip and told of having to go to sitema backlog of paperwork.
he said he would stay away only a couple of hours.
said trip?
it was in Albuquerque for a training seminar.
only two nights.
he was noticed something strange lately, some strange behavior?
well, he had to work late, a bit more often than usual.
but, I mean, at this stage economic, who should not do?
had to lay off the goal his division last year.
and he was sure work late?
what do you mean, I was cheating?
every evening, he went beyond that door and the boys ran his arms, okay?
and now he's gone.
so do not ask me if he worked really late.
tell me why he was killed.
I will not ... - Some call? Maybe late at night.
Yes. It...
one of the guys fired John, Max Haverstock, called him late at night and shouted all sorts of things.
I think it was in difficulty. He needed money.
and I said to John that he just had to hang up.
John said no, he could not do it.
has never given any money? - My husband did not believe elemosina.
he believed that a man had to fend for himself.
where is?
I would like to say goodbye.
in this regard ...
it was embarrassing.
it makes no sense.
this guy had a solid bourgeois life.
a good job, a nice family.
perhaps his friend Max was jealous.
maybe enough to kill him but so much to steal the body?
Hey, Esposito, you should seek friend of the victim, Max Haverstock.
Yes.
OK, find him and bring it in Central Asia.
Pope. Thank God you're home. You okay? - All right, why ?
right? Bandits hooded and body snatchers?
I sent you a thousand messages.
I'm sorry. Phone had to be turned off.
as... How did you know?
he called Beckett.
Really?
he just wanted us to know that you were good.
then, you have forgiven?
not quite, Mom. But I'm working on.
allowed me to help in the case.
well, and a start I suppose.
and more of a beginning, and...opportunity.
all right,he has built a wall between us, but I ...build a door in that wall, either we support a ladder or dig a hole
you have a strategy? - Be as charming as usual.
what about a Plan B?
it was horrible? Were you scared?
fear, I? Absolutely not, let's go.
now excuse, but I have to change their underwear. - Pope.
no, I was afraid. But they were just looking at the body.
Why? - In fact, why '?
Papa, where are you? Papa, are you okay?
Pope, call as soon as possible. Papa, I going to see "Fame" with Owen Friday?
your concern and moving.
OK, that state after I knew you were good.
I thought that we'd seen together.
we had and we still can. But I was asked to see him on next Friday.
prefer to go with your boyfriend instead with your father? What's wrong with it?
if you really want that go with you, I'll do.
no, no. Di to Owen who has won this round, but ...
"a Christmas Carol" touches me.
thanks Dad. And I'm glad that and body snatchers do not steal you have killed.
pure said.
Oh, invoke "Fame" and "A Christmas Carol."
in Hollywood they have finished the ideas?
they just optioned "Asteroids" videogame. So yes.
but Ryan Reynolds will interpret the triangle, and bravo.
are you sure it's him?
Maxwell Haverstock. It confirmed know the victim.
this guy would not be able to throw a sponge from the roof, let alone a body.
Mr. Haverstock. - Yes.
know why is here?
no, I have just been said to come to Central.
about John Allen. He was killed last night.
Oh, and terrible.
you two were friends? - We were neighbors desk.
when he last seen?
I have not seen by day"R." So...
so that we call. You know, "R" stands for downsizing.
it has been kicked?
Yes. - I bet this made his angry.
Yes, 15 years of working together. Do you think they mean something?
do you think that loyalty take you something?
a kick in the teeth.
have you ever called John to tell him? - Sure, all the time.
I told him I did not deserve such treatment.
but I promised that one day the wind would change.
and why I killed him?
who?
why I should kill John?
to have his fired.
I fired him. We were driven both on the day "R."
fortunately I was able to find another job.
he did not have a job?
believe that it should no longer look for one now.
Hey, Beckett.
we verified the story.
John Allen was fired 8 months ago during the crisis of AIG.
what about Albuquerque?
no trace of a John Allen no flight back to New York.
one wonders what else lied to his wife.
and how he did it to pay the bills.
okay.
Oh, thanks.
they found his corpse.
again.
and that success?
someone ... the action took place.
work?
they open and threw out all its organs.
Oh! - Oh!
some people hated the fact who had liver.
anyone who was not a surgeon. The cuts are imprecise.
box cutters and knives.
any idea on what for?
I did a drug test and I found nothing in the blood, but in the cavity of the body were traces of powder cocaine.
he was a courier.
I suppose they could not wait restore ova in the usual way.
not drink.
how does an actuary middle-aged working for insurance, unprecedented abuse drugs and no criminal record, to become a courier?
he was not a villain.
not enough to respond to an ad on the Web, you ...you have to know people.
bad people.
as everything can be funny, not forget that was successful post-mortem.
the real cause of death was up here.
the appearance of bruising indicates that the assailant strangled him with both hands.
the bruises here are a bit more light.
how do you explain that?
perhaps a sprained finger or broken.
maybe a necklace.
strangles people with the little finger.
as for you.
I just spoke with security National. The passport indicates John Allen arrived from Mexico, not from New Mexico.
no criminal record, health, white, middle-class ...
not have given much attention to the customs.
that guy was good, why has he done something so stupid?
because he should.
I just checked the finances with his wife.
bad? - For six months lived thanks to credit cards.
she had no idea. I thought it was okay.
well, if every day was not to work, where he went?
he asked questions of work. I found hundreds of cover letters and curricula on his computer.
I do not understand why he has simply sell the apartment?
devalued. - What a beating.
life insurance?
he stopped paying for it four months ago.
the guy was practically without worth living and dead.
it speaks Ryan.
you know, I understand the despair, need for money.
I understand even become a courier. What I do not understand and ...
where he found the job?
Yes, thanks Bill. Was the science.
given that the culprits had gloves, the only fingerprints found in the car are the owner, who has reported stolen last night.
it seems that we had luck with this track.
and the glove that we found on the scene?
checking too. None.
have you checked even inside?
inside?
Yes, inside the glove.
want me to put some music?
when do these things in the CIS always do with the music and dimly lit room.
reminds me quite a pornographic film.
stop, Castle.
have you ever thought become a circumciser?
speak and faro practice on you.
I've got you, motherfucker!
boom! We have a match.
possession and once for drug dealing for criminal conspiracy.
acquitted on appeal all three times. He served five years for possession of weapons, and is currently free the word for drug dealing.
something tells me that his freedom the word is about to be revoked.
you have an address? - Yes.
ashore! Sit on the floor!
stop! Nobody move!
hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!
hands! Strength, worm!
I accuse them of safe for possession of weapons, assault, desecration of a corpse and another dozen things which are not I have not even begun to think.
what good would make a deal?
they can not be charged with murder.
give me time.
did not need time, because they did not.
ten years on all charges, reducible to five, and tell everything they know.
was coming to meet her?
in a dump on Ninth street.
would have to be there for 19.
but this guy had 750 thousand U. S. dollars our coca in the stomach, and did not spanked.
and you wanted to do?
we wanted to go and look.
then we heard the sirens ... lots of sirens.
going down, we turn the corner and guess who we see?
a group of policemen looking at a tree.
a fucking tree. The guy was on a tree.
so ... you wait?
was the only way to recover the body.
we could not get back the goods in the usual way.
so you have ... improvised.
who cares? Was already dead.
why had you begun to do the courier?
the same reason the other ... despair.
it's just ...
it does not seem the type.
they all are, if forced.
as, that guy had debts. Was in a difficult situation, and had little time.
in what trouble he had got? - He has not said, but he was afraid.
if you want to know who killed him, those who are owed money.
no, no, no, I need something more.
I know who has been vouched for him. - Guaranteed?
to John Allen.
our victim, your carrier.
there has led some ... someone you fidavate.
or do business with any white despair crimes behind?
what the hell, man.
how did you know that he was not a cop?
sang. Ron Bigby.
it 'a financial broker at Goldman ...
the wife of the victim no one has ever heard.
for a guy by trade currency risks certainly seems to run several.
uh, well... look how finished.
bring him here. - Now.
dead? - Yes.
wait ... dead? - Mr Bigby, can ask that as many times as they want, the answer remains the same.
Oh, really a shame. Why, really a shame.
I mean ... know who was John Allen?
was the new Willy Loman, ok?
an ordinary man victim of an indifferent world.
God, someone should write a play.
Hey, she does not write comedy? - Let no one produces.
mr Bigby, we came to knowledge recently she had found Mr. Allen a use as a drug courier.
did you know? - Yes.
and there is bad news, Ron... will have to find another drug dealer.
what did they say? - That she has presented.
and that has been vouched for Mr. Allen.
OK, listen ... and he came from me desperate, okay?
he remembered a story I had told an evening at the table.
the table? - It's the poker table.
we went to a gambling traveling in the city.
low point, ok? But a good way to relieve tension.
when he was fired, it ceased to be a game.
beging to aim for pull up a salary, but the stakes were too low so he went in Chinatown.
the gambling mafia. - Yes, the Triad.
it went to great for a bit, you know?
luck and a bitch capricious. Losses more than he had with the wrong guy.
not bring himself to cover the losses.
right, and then you remember the evening when I told the story of my emergency tax.
when I went to Mexico and $ 50, 000 in one day.
it was then that I thought ...the hell ... pass please!
OK, this sort to whom he owed the money ... told you described? Name?
no names.
John thought it was the Russian mafia, because of all those tattoos.
if a Russian mafia tattoo I gave chase, maybe I'd do the delivery of drugs.
a Russian tattooed in New York?
well, that narrows the field.
conduct an investigation under the information we have not on the evidence we need.
well, Bigby said the Russian the club hangs out in Chinatown.
why not just go there?
snakes are all word of mouth, friend.
and do not talk with the cops.
luckily I'm not.
castle ... - That there is? And perfect.
I go in, do a look at the place so long does not identify the Russian.
Hey, you know, not a bad plan.
we have yet to find the snake.
leave it to me.
it's just a nice story, Ricky.
has a well incipit, a great plot twist ...
although I must say that I expected all the history of the drug courier.
nice try, Connelly, but do not push me to raise.
Stephen, once you wrote a gambling poker illegal will "The king of the scam."
Yes. - Once your Harry Bosch investigated the murder a poker player.
Yes, in "First Prize: $ 1. "Perche?
well, Michael ... this type we are trying is regular customer in gambling the Triad in Chinatown.
I thought maybe one of you knows someone who can farmici enter.
are you crazy?
there are criminals and murderers, there.
listen, Ricky, researching is a thing but the Russian mafia, the Triads ...
if you quarrel with those people not enough all the best sellers of the world to protect you.
Oh, no, I will not argue. Saro another rich bored and looking for excitement wants groped the Luckily there.
you must really like him so much. - Who?
that your detective. Listen, Ricky ...
there's only one reason being so stupid to go down there and is to impress a girl.
Perche take it a bit more convenient - And pick flowers? - Do you know this place or not?
so?
sure the place is this?
Cannell he never advised evil.
OK.
the micro is in place, Ryan.
I get the video.
audio as well.
perfect. Remember ... we hear you, but you can not hear us.
once out of this van ... you'll be alone, okay?
okay, repete back the plan.
later, I find the Russian tattooed frame it well, and I go to them.
and they'll be a second most necessary.
and then we are in Chinatown, many poker players Russians will never be?
no one else has a bad presentimento a riguardo?
Yes. - Right, as I thought.
from well cards.
one with ice.
within.
russian tattooed.
there's another Russian tattooed ...
and here is a whole table Russians tattooed.
apparently there are many in Chinatown most Russian tattooed than I thought.
the Russians are regulars here, but only few of them play at the table without limits and that's where John Allen would go.
the guy said that they are bullies of poker. Up the ante, forcing opponents to assets to move forward.
you think you see that you are summarizing a conversation we have already heard in its entirety?
give him a gadget, and is believed to James Bond.
we hope that you remember wearing a camera when I am going to the bathroom.
why I think ... - Trust.
it's a mess, I must do something.
I'll go to sit at the table.
maybe I can find something.
what did he say?
he said that sits ... - It's not the plan, and the plan, Castle.
come butta?
it's a table without limits.
which is perfect, because I am a person with no limits.
chang 20, 000, thanks.
no, no, no, no ... What are you doing?
pulled out half of my salary year as if they were pennies.
how wonderful!
no, I ... I was referring to the tattoos.
they are very beautiful. What's' written?
there wrote "the facts your own business and playing cards."
sorry, I did not want to be intrusive.
it's just ... actually have one writer. I'm doing some research.
writer?
something that we have heard?
"the fall of Storm" "The last case of Storm" ...
derrick Storm. - Exactly.
I love this type.
why did you kill?
it's a long story, but I'm working on a new book on poker underground.
all in great secrecy. I came down here to feel that air you breathe, you see - And you want everything to be authentic? - Exactly.
no problem.
I will fuck your ...
I will fuck your son of a bitch.
Yes.
it's getting some friends.
they said they will bring away everything he has.
do you speak Russian?
I spent a semester at Kiev between the penultimate and last year.
sometimes when I'm bored, I go to Glechik Cafe in Little Odessa and pretend to be Moscow.
this is something exciting.
raise.
I see.
I see.
check the hands of players, see if there issomething that explains the appearance of bruises on neck of the victim.
I see.
so, Mr Castle ...
tell me something more about this book.
well, about a Russian gangster, with a passion for cards.
yes...
exploits the desperation bringing people to bet more than is available.
and why would?
because he is also a moneylender.
it presents to its victims and makes them by the bank.
what the hell is he doing? - Play poker.
try to bring one of them to make him fold, or try to understand who is the killer.
but there's a guy, a family man ...
goes a bit too far.
can not 'repay the loan.
then the gangster ...has no choice, he must kill him.
to send a message to anyone who needs money.
then one night, draws him into an abandoned building, strangles him and throws from the roof.
seems a lot of work.
why not plant a bullet in the head and nothing else? Much more simple.
Oh my ...
Hey, Ryan, look here.
what is he doing with his finger? - Maximize.
he has a prosthesis.
that's why has not left fingerprints on the victim.
it's him. - If you think that Castle is a threat ...
we must get him out of them now.
their safety are army. Enter as policemen will create problems.
what are you doing? - He will take them inside.
and if I go out in ten minutes, call for reinforcements.
could I have my bag?
what do you do? Kill the lip gloss?
something like that.
Hey!
come on, guys!
my boyfriend is waiting. And one of the players.
except within and lose.
I'm his lucky charm, you see
no?
well ...maybe I could be your luck.
win, and when I'm there, always win.
and then maybe I could share a little fortune of my guy ...
with you ...
point all.
it's a nice plate, Mr. Writer.
all that money.
but then, what are the money to a millionaire?
you can bring in taxes as money for field research.
point all.
like the character of your book ...go too far.
trio of queens.
I'm impressed.
there's not a lot flying the trio of queens.
apart from a straight draw, perhaps. Sweetness, this is for you.
would you change them into something more small that it can carry?
that is a good lot of money, but ...
what is money a gangster, right?
walk.
who are you? - I told you, I am a writer.
that story, the man died, the roof. Who told you? Who knows?
who? His family, his children.
if he had paid the due, he would be at home with them.
but he has hindered me. And now you did.
no, no. I'm just a writer. - Do not lie.
you are a cop. - He, a cop?
do not make me laugh. It's hardly a man.
Beckett? - But you're a man, right?
he's very charming.
you're giving bother this man so great?
go away.
OK, men and their guns. Should I be impressed?
none of your business. - To tell the truth ...I'm concerned.
and my impression or have you changed?
castle, call for reinforcements, please? - Yes.
Yes. - Thanks.
this way.
how are you?
it 'hard ...
when you discover that everything they believe in is a lie.
well, not everything was a lie.
not the love of her husband. I mean, sometimes ...do the wrong thing for the right reasons.
so the case is closed. I assume that your article on "Cosmos" will have a happy ending.
about happy ending ...
thanks for saving my life.
I was just trying to avoid fill out the paperwork.
certain.
we're a good team, you know?
like Starsky and Hutch.
tango and Cash.
Turner and Hooch.
you know, now that you mentioned, actually reminds me a little Hooch.
and because you're afraid, right?
are you afraid that, investigating the death of your mother you may fall into the lair rabbit and miss again.
but this time is different.
we have good clues. Are strong clues.
and you will not do it alone.
we can do it together.
and if I do not want to know?
have you ever thought?
and if I were not ready? And if the idea of capture the murderess of my mother, dovermene then sit watch while ago an agreement that transmit 'in circulation after 10 years, I disgusting?
you have resurfaced with my past for yourself, Castle, not for me.
and you're too selfish to realize it.
chance is closed Castle.
we made a deal and I expect you to respect him.
you're writing.
it was time.
and Beckett?
I'm sorry, Dad.
then, as was the film?
there are more left.
Perche no?
Owen.
what's happened?
he lost track of time playing video games.
and when you were presented was too late.
I'm sorry, honey.
and then, when we were forward, he tried to behave as if nothing had happened, as if I were exaggerating.
I mean, he has not even called.
Perche boys are so?
why they must always be justified?
why they can not just say "sorry"?
thank you.
for what?
only ...
be yourself.
I'm sorry.
what I did was wrong.
I betrayed your trust, I have reopened old wounds and not I respected your wishes.
and, if there shall never meet again, you deserve to know.
I regret very much.
see you tomorrow.
there are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people:
psychopaths and mystery writers.
I'm the kind that pays better.
who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
every writer needs inspiration. And I found mine.
detective Kate Beckett.
Nikki Heat? - The character he's basing on you.
and thanks to my friendship with the mayor,
I get to be on her case.
I would be happy to let you spank me.
and together, we catch killers
we make a pretty good team, you know?
like Starsky and Hutch.
Turner and Hooch.
you do remind me a little of Hooch.
tell me, seer,
what do I hold in my hand now?
you're holding...
a wallet.
Yes,incredible. Ten out of ten.
what's going on?
gram's teaching me how to read minds.
and she is a natural. Much better than you were at her age. - And I'm very proud.
why the sudden foray into the mysterious realms?
it's a genealogy project for school.
half of the assignment is to collect stories from family members.
I had no idea that gram's folks had a mind-reading act on Coney Island.
Yeah, they were very famous in their day.
I love all their codes
how "tell me" means wallet and "reveal to me" means a pair of glasses.
Yes, you come from a long line of hucksters and charlatans, myself included.
but we have high hopes for you.
that must be Beckett.
how did you know?
it's after 10: 00
on a weekday.
who else is it gonna be?
Oh, she is good.
brilliant.
castle I knew it was you.
victim is a hispanic male, mid-30s.
a local spotted him when he was out walking his dog, around 10: 30.
his wallet's missing.
if it was a robbery,
I bet my week's salary that the killer didn't know who he was rolling.
you can identified him without a wallet?
unfortunately.
you know the guy?
everybody in New York knows the guy.
the baseball player.
Yep. - Cano Vega? Are you sure?
he was my first-round draft pick in my fantasy league three years running.
314 batting average, 4 gold gloves, and one championship ring.
I almost caught one of his homers once.
he had just came to the states from Cuba, and my dad took us out to the bleachers over at Shea.
I didn't know you were a baseball fan.
it's genetic, on my dad's side.
been taking me to games since I was 3.
Yeah, mine, too.
what about you, Castle?
your dad a baseball fan?
I really can't say. - Castle is famously fatherless.
what, are you adopted or something? - No.
then how do you-- - it's complicated.
it's not that complicated. Someone used his head for batting practice.
36-ouncer to the back of the head.
by the look of the spatter, he was hit multiple times.
time of death?
uh, from his temperature, I'd say two, maybe three hour at the most.
what's with all this bruising?
postmortem, from the balls. Pitching arm--it ran for a while after he was dead.
so you'd think a guy like Cano Vega would have a batting cage in his basement.
what would he be doing in a sketchy neighborhood in Spanish Harlem at this hour of the night?
maybe because it's Cano Vega field.
local uniforms said that he built it for the community, wanted to give something back.
so our killer hit him from here.
and he got blood on his shoe.
have CSI run a sweep.
see if anything tracked outside of the field. all right.
so your dad, what is it, a "mamma mia!" thing?
early '70s, free love.
Yeah, I'll bet your mom was kinda wild back in the day.
you really need to stop talking now. sorry. done.
a big, athletic guy is swinging a 2-1/2-foot club.
he couldn't have been that easy to kill.
unless he didn't see it coming.
on behalf of the Vega family,I want to thank all of Cano's loyal fans for their love and support.
in this time of great sadness, we ask that you please respect his family's privacy.Mr.Fox!
12 years of marriage
all they want from me is a sound bite.
I'm very sorry about your loss, Mrs. Vega.
do you know why he'd be in the park last night? sometimes he'd go there to blow off steam, but never at night. do you know where he was earlier in the evening?
he was at my club. thanks.
detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, Tommy Zane-- Cano's old teammate.
be hard to be a New Yorker and not know freight train Tommy Zane. So you guys got any leads?
we're looking into it. Mr. Zane, you said that Mr. Vega was at your club last night? our club, actually.
Cano and I owned it with a couple of other players. do you know about what time?
dropped by about 7: 00. left about 7: 30.
I didn't really see him. I was with a friend.
excuse me. Yeah.
Mrs. Vega, do you know of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband? used to be, everybody loved him, especially in the Cuban community.
what changed? The trip.
a-a few months ago, the Cuban tourism department approached him.
they wanted Cano to be the poster boy for the new Cuba.
you risk your life to escape Castro's Cuba, why would you go back to visit?
while Cano was down there, the locals treated him like a hero--their hero.
at a state dinner, Castro came over and shook his hand.
when he got home, his friends called him a traitor for going, said he was a lapdog for Fidel.
the same people who cheered when he built that ballpark came up and told him to go to hell. Did he get any threats?
you bet he got threats, hundreds of them, and all of them courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.
detective, Bobby Fox, Cano's agent. Nice to meet you.
detective, could you do something to get those jackals and their cameras away from Mrs. Vega's house? I'll see what I can do.
Thanks. who's Alfredo Quintana?
he's the guy who killed Cano Vega.
Thanks, Carlos.
Hey.
JD,PHD and editor,
a newspaper published by his foundation, primarily for the Cuban community.
this is his column from two weeks ago. "Cano Vega must pay"?
the article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community by shaking hands with the monster who butchered thousands of their relatives.
quintana says, "If Vega is going to embrace "the brutal regime he once escaped, he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty.
well, that sounds like a threat to me.
I wasn't threatening him.
you turned the local Cuban community against him.
he turned his back on his people when he gave Castro his nod of approval.
if you want me to be sorry about what I wrote because he's dead, I'm not.
I wrote the truth.
are you sure that's all you did?
you said it yourself in your editorial, Vega should pay.
it's a free country, isn't it?
I'm entitled to express my opinion.
your foundation-- Cubans first
is on east 98th street.
that's three blocks away from the field where Vega's body was found.
you think I had something to do with his murder?
well, the pen is mightier than the sword.
but a baseball bat can be pretty effective, too.
where were you last night between 7: 00 and 10: 00 p. m? I was at home with my wife.
Mm. Wives make such convenient alibis.
my sons were there as well...
as well as my brother.
do you have anyone who isn't blood related?
a notary, perhaps?
look, what Cano Vega did is inexcusable.
but I am not a murderer.
are you sure about that, Mr. Quintana?
you incited an entire community against him.
so from where I'm standing, you might not have swung that bat, but that doesn't mean that you didn't kill him.
well? We'll check his alibi, but my gut tells me it's not him. we should get a warrant, run his subscribers against any hate mail that the Vegas might have gotten. you sure you got no cop in the Castle family tree?
no, us Castles are mostly con artists and circus folk, sir.
no, I think there's a little cop in there somewhere.
con artists and circus people, huh?
Yep, and mind readers.
Really? So tell me what I'm thinking.
you're thi--aah.
you're... you're thinking...
you don't care and you want me to stop talking.
Ooh, that's uncanny.
it's in the blood. yo, beckett.
Yeah. just got back from CSI.
they managed to track the blood trail from the killer's shoe across the park.
it dead-ended at the curb.
so our killer was driving a car. Yeah. The area was a little muddy, so we were able to pull a partial on the tire. any make and model?
better. The tire marks are distinctive.
they've been ped in two spots.
now those same tire tracks match a car that was tagged in an aggravated assault last year.
the assault was committed with a baseball bat by one Anton Wade.
loan sharking, blackmail.
plus assault with a deadly weapon and two A&b's
assault and battery. I know.
right. The guy's one seriously bad dude.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm sensing something here
that... This guy might just be our killer.
Mr. Wade, we have you at the baseball field.
your car was at the crime scene, not to mention your unfortunate history of hitting people with baseball bats.
all of that's enough to send you away.
so you can play dumb or you can play ball. Pun intended.
all right, I was there, but I didn't kill him.
he was already dead.
you were just paying the corpse a visit.
he called me and asked me to meet up with him.
and when I got there, I knew how it looked.
so I bounced the hell up outta there. Why would Vega call you?
he wanted to make a payment on his loan.
he always paid the same way, cash in a plain envelope.
I saw it on him. I took it.
the guy's a multimillionaire. You're a petty loan shark.
what's he doing borrowing money from you?
in my business, you don't ask, you don't tell.
how much money did he borrow?
he came to me a couple weeks back, needed 200 grand.
in my experience... If you need that kind of coin, he got himself into some real bad... Trouble
the kind of trouble that gets you killed.
or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.
and you pulled a little "untouchables" on his head. A guy owing you money?
killing him ain't gonna get you paid. You take his bling, you jack him for his ride, you maybe even bust his kneecaps.
but he made his last installment.
Vega made his vig. We were good.
Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.
it doesn't make sense.
with his assets, a guy like Cano Vega could get a loan from any bank in New York city.
so why go to a loan shark for $200, 000?
because bank loans take time.
loan sharks give it to you right away.
maybe he needed the money fast. Maybe he needed it kept quiet.
loan sharks don't require paperwork, credit checks.
maybe he didn't want his wife to know. Vega didn't want his wife to know why he was going to Cuba either so you think his trip and the money are related?
well, a week after he gets back, he suddenly needs $200, 000?
it stands to reason that the two were connected somehow.
we just finished a search of Wade's apartment.
we found a match to the partial shoe print.
Yeah, but here's the weird thing
it tested positive for blood on the sole, but negative for blood on the rest of the shoe and negative for cleaning agents. if Wade killed Vega, then his shoe would've been covered in blood. so Wade's telling the truth.
he shows up after the murder, tracks some blood outside of the park.
while the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe and leaves little or no trail behind.
let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba and suddenly needs 200 grand. Okay.
so where do you want to start? you guys look into Vega's financials.
see if we missed anything.
castle and I will start with Cuba. Cuba. good idea.
I'll bring the mojitos. you get the beach towels.
Oh, I don't know, Castle.
me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun?
I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.
that's okay. I was actually thinking of something a little bit more local... ...for their love and support.
in this time of great sadness... like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba.
Bobby Fox, his agent. that's a good idea.
but the lotion offer still stands.
no, thank you. I have very soft hands.
what is it with professional sports?
I mean, even the agencies are on steroids.
well, Fox's client list is a veritable who's who of star athletes.
5% of their endorsements and salaries
you could pay for half of lower Manhattan.
did you just use the word "veritable"? Yes, I did.
sexy. you should hear me say "fallacious.
Bobby Fox agency. please hold. can I help you?
I need to see Mr. Fox. do you have an appointment?
I think he can squeeze me in. Rick?
Rick Castle? Hey, skipper.
I have not seen you since the big move.
how are you, Joe? pretty awful.
I just can't believe this whole Vega thing. I know.
it's sad. And you two were friends. I'm--I'm sorry.
Yeah, he was a great kid.
uh, he had the ability to be a Cuban Roberto clement.
it's just been very sad. We're actually here to talk to Mr. Fox about it.
this is detective Kate Beckett. Hi.
Beckett... Kate... Detective.
thank you.
very nice meeting you. Okay.
well, good luck on the case.
and, uh, I'll say a prayer for you guys.
Thanks.
by the way, say hi to your mom for me, okay?
will do, Joe. Okay.
smooth.
that was Joe-Freakin'-Torre.
I gotta call my dad.
the office is over... the off--his office is...
he was a good guy--Cano.
he built that field because he wanted to give back.
I think that's why he went to Cuba.
he wanted to see if he could do something good.
but I guess things hadn't changed as much as he had hoped for.
what happened?
he had spent some time in Havana with the people.
he came back pretty upset, and he told me to give the tourism guys back their signing bonus.
first time I ever let client give money back.
but I figured, you know, Cano was reneging on a military dictatorship.
these are not the people you want angry at you, especially having defected from them 18 years ago.
he risked his life to leave.
why would you want him to be the poster boy for the new Cuba?
Oh, I didn't. I was just as surprised as anyone that he wanted to do it.
after everything I did to get him out back then?
have you heard this story? no.
you're gonna like this, Castle. it's like one of your books.
it was the '92 olympics.
the Cubans had just won gold in Barcelona, thanks mostly to Cano.
and I wanted to get him to the states to play in the big.
now convincing him was the easy part.
getting him onto my plane, that was the hard part.
we had to get past coaches and minders and finally...
el pulpo, head of state security, because he had his tentacles around everybody.
and just as we thought we were home free--boom!
el pulpo.
we were caught, sunk.
a firing squad, I kid you not, was waiting for that kid back in Havana.
you know how I got us past el pulpo?
Rolex.
I gave him my shiny new Rolex, and he just looked the other way.
just goes to show you, every socialist is a capitalist when backs are turned.
is it possible that he took the Cuba job because he needed the money? well, it's possible, yes.
God knows those guys know how to blow through money.
and plus, he has that club with Tommy that's just a money pit.
so in regards to the Cuba job, who else went on this trip? Well, a couple of low-level Cuban diplomats.
I'll have, uh, Cynthia get you a list.
so what made him go to Cuba and then what made him change his mind?
well, maybe Vega worked for the state department.
maybe he was sent to shake hands with Fidel in a secret attempt to release a bio toxin into his system.
well, the Russians sprayed sushi with radioactive polonium.
what-- what's more farfetched?
well, I just met Joe Torre, so I guess anything's possible.
cause of death was cerebral hemorrhaging, as expected.
any way to estimate the height of the attacker based on the angle of the blows? Normally, yes, but I-in this case, your attacker's first swing landed a little south of his head. How far south?
E-enough to make him a soprano.
Ow. Should worn a cup.
lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees when he was hit on the head.
so our attacked could've been anyone? Man, woman or child.
but that's not why I called.
among all the fresh bruising, we also found significant subdermal bruises that weren't quite as fresh.
the contusions were all fist sized.
he was in a fight.
couple days ago.
what's this shape right here? He was wearing a ring.
not just any ring.
a championship ring.
left-hand ring finger, just like his old teammate Freight Train Tommy Zane.
you know, mom's family goes all the way back to the "mayflower.
what, her persecution complex is genetic?
Hey, those are my genes you're talking about, too. Well, look on the bright side.
now that you know you're genetically predisposed, you can seek early treatment, prevent future outbreaks.
doesn't it bother you that you don't know who your dad is? No.
why, does it bother you?
it's like... I have this family tree, and there's a whole chunk of it missing.
there's a whole part of my history that doesn't even exist.
I mean, really, how could gram not know?
my first year of college, I, uh, went to a party, met this girl--Allison.
in the space of six hours, we met, we talked, we danced, we fell in love.
the next morning, she was gone.
I spent a year trying to find her, but I never learned her last name.
there's not a week that goes by I don't think about her.
your gram told me that she loved a lifetime the night she met him. Don't you feel like you're missing out, not knowing?
no. Oh, no. That's the beauty of the mystery.
right now, my father could be an astronaut, a pirate, a humanitarian, winner of the Nobel Prize.
I mean, what one man could live up to all that? You think he ate whipped cream out of a can?
Yes, and he invented whipped cream.
dad!
you're gonna spoil your diner.
this is my dinner. No.
Mr. Zane.
detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.
you're in a festive mood tonight, Mr. Zane. Honoring the dead?
celebrating a life...
the way Cano would've wanted it.
Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving" like an appletini.
you must be the "forgive and forget" type, Mr. Zane, especially after that beating that you gave Cano a couple of nights ago. What are you talking about?
we found the bruises left on Vega's body from where you hit him, including the imprints left by your championship ring. 25 guys have this ring.
do they all wear it on their left-hand ring finger? Some of 'em, yeah.
do they all have abrasions on that finger that are consistent with assault?
what happened, Mr. Zane?
was Cano tired of dumping money into this club?
he didn't care about the money. Then what was it?
his wife.
his wife? You and she were
no.
but he thought
Maggie was upset, said she thought Cano was having an affair and wanted to know if I'd seen him down here at the club with anybody. What'd you tell her?
I told her no, of course. Was that the truth?
look, i've been through this before.
Cano was having some kind of crisis.
he wasn't gonna leave her. So why tell her the truth? So Vega was having an affair?
I'd seen him with a girl-- young, Cuban.
you know, I figured after his visit, he was missing home.
anyway, he saw me leaving his house that night, and when he asked Maggie why I was there, she got evasive.
so naturally, he thought she was having an affair of her own.
came after me swinging.
took a couple of shots to his ribs to calm him down enough before I could tell him the truth.
this girl that he was dating, do you remember her name? No, he never told me her name.
but I might have a picture on my phone.
what is it with professional athletes and politicians that they just can't keep it in their pants?
they're just overgrown teenagers with delicate little egos.
it's not that deep. It's just simple math.
they just have more opportunity.
well, what are you saying, men are dogs?
no. The greater the opportunity, the greater the likelihood.
which means the two of you have nothing to worry about. Ryan has nothing to worry about.
Hey. Cano Vega, on the other hand...
his wife said that he changed when he got back from Cuba.
maybe it wasn't Cuba. Maybe it was the girl. That could explain the 200 grand.
maybe he needed it for the girl. And why he needed to borrow money from a loan shark without her finding out. But Maggie Vega did find out.
so she decides she's not gonna take it anymore.
she considers divorce, but thought about the endless hours of scrutiny, the public humiliation in the media. Not to mention that she'd only get half.
uh, assuming there's no prenup.
but if she kills him, she gets everything.
Mm-hmm. She knows where he's gonna be, alone, at night.
she goes there.
he trusts her, lets his guard down.
she moves in close.
she smiles, picks up a bat, thinks of everything that he's done to her, starts with the family jewels and ends with the family fortune.
this is crazy. Why would I kill my husband?
because you thought he was having an affair.
you know?
how? It doesn't matter how we know.
what matters is that you didn't tell us. It was a private matter between Cano and me. It's also motive.
Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night of your husband's murder? At home alone.
you can check the security tapes if you want.
so... It's true then?
he was seeing someone else?
we don't know that for sure.
I do.
he was in love with her.
her name is Lara.
mi Carino. It means "my love.
who is she? I don't know.
I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue.
that note is the only thing I've found.
2/16"-that's the day before the murder. Yeah.
he went into the city that day, didn't get home until 10: 30.
that's why I knew.
Mrs. Vega, this woman is possibly involved in your husband's murder.
why didn't you tell us this before?
because I...
I just didn't want it to be true.
home security videos confirm Mrs. Vega's story, and CSI tested negative for blood at Tommy Zane's place.
where are we on the girl? Just finished combing through Vega's internet records.
there are no MSN, e-mails or internet browser searches connecting him in any way, shape or form to a Lara.
phones are a dead end, too.
no one who called or was called by Vega in the last two months remembers him mentioning anyone named Lara well, for a guy who's supposedly in love, he doesn't do a very good job keeping in touch with his girl. Some guys are just hopeless. Hey, honey.
Yeah, I was just thinking about you, thought I'd call you.
well, I just wanted to call to say i miss you. Yeah. Some guys are just pathetic.
I don't know. About 7: 00. Don't be jealous. He still loves you.
Vega met with her the day before he died, so let's put photos out to all precincts and have uniforms canvass the area around the field.
maybe somebody saw her the night that he was killed. Beckett.
Yes, Sir. How we doing on the Cuba angle?
nothing yet. Why? Just got a call from the lieu over in union city, New Jersey.
Vega was involved in a shouting match at a restaurant in little Havana with one of their regulars.
apparently the cops were called in to break it up. Why wasn't there an incident report?
cops kept it quiet at the time at the request of the Cuba consulate. Because of Vega?
no, because of who Vega was fighting with.
mario Scheetz--head of the Cuba consulate in New York. He was one of the diplomats that took Vega to Cuba.
what did they fight about? I don't know, but seeing that they were in Cuba together, I suggest you find out.
on the night of the 17th, I was here at the consulate.
you don't really think I killed Cano Vega, do you? Given his change of heart in Cuba, I can't imagine that the two of you were the best of friends. You could say the same thing about most of the Cuban community here. Yes, but how many of them ended up dead after fighting with you in a restaurant?
I was minding my own business.
Vega was the one who decided to pick a fight with me. Why?
I was in charge of his schedule in Cuba.
I guess he didn't like to be told what to do or where to go.
sounds like you kept him on a pretty tight leash.
we did a counterrevolutionary the courtesy of allowing him back on our soil.
we weren't about to just let him wander around.
so you would know better than anyone else what Vega did on his trip? That's my job.
everyone we've spoke to about Vega says he came back from Cuba a different man.
what happened to him down there?
he was very emotional the whole time he was there
uh, talking to the locals, feeling sorry for them because they were poor and he was rich.
truth is, he felt guilty.
when Vega returned, he borrowed $200, 000 in cash.
is it possible that he was trying to funnel money to the island, help some of the locals out, maybe? Not on my watch.
Yeah, you can't have that.
rich people sharing their wealth? That's like socialism.
please.
the truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled.
when the poverty was before his eyes
it's an unspeakable tragedy.
and then, out of sight, out of mind.
he didn't know that I was aware, but do you want to know the thing that interested Vega most about Cuba?
a girl.
what girl?
he met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies.
I can only assume it was a pretty young thing he met while he was touring the island.
do you know her name?
her name was Lara.
so Vega fell in love with a girl in Cuba.
if you take Scheetz's word. Well, he couldn't have just pulled the name Lara out of thin air. According to the note that the wife found, Vega and Lara were supposed to meet the night before he was murdered.
now how are they supposed to do that if she's stuck in Cuba? If she's stuck on the island, how did she end up in that photo with Vega at his club?
there has to be an explanation that makes this all make sense. There is.
the woman standing next to Vega in the picture is not Lara.
a resident near the ballpark where Vega was killed identified her. Her names Ana, Ana Rivera.
she's a waitress in the neighborhood.
uniforms are bringing her in now. What's her connection to Vega?
Cuba. She escaped six months ago.
we met at a bar where I work, near his field.
he heard I'd just come over from Cuba last year, and he invited me out for drinks.
did you know he was married? It wasn'like that.
he just wanted to talk... About home.
he missed it. I think that's why he wanted to go.
you were photographed with him after the trip.
did he still want to... Just talk?
Yes. He wanted to talk about my trip here from Cuba.
it was like he was obsessed. He wanted to know how I got out.
and what did you tell him?
ana, what did you tell Mr. Vega?
I said my family knew a man.
if--if you pay him lots of money, Mi Carino comes and takes you to America.
his boat.
it takes you to Jamaica, and then you fly to America.
it's important that you fly, because if you come by boat, then they can send you back.
that's the wet-foot, dry-foot policy. Vega was looking for a way to get his new girlfriend out of Cuba.
mi Carino," 2/16, 8: 30 p. M. It looks like he succeeded.
mi Carino" to Jamaica 2/16, which means she arrived on the 17th.
that's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.
ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch with the man who got you out of Cuba.
Yes. He runs a newspaper.
on east 98th.
Alfredo Quintana, the editor?
he lied to us.
all right, first you accuse me of killing Vega.
then you're saying that I'm helping him.
so maybe you guys should make up your mind.
well, actually, we made up our minds once we saw the $200, 000 in your bank account. That's the exact amount Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark. Since what you were doing was illegal, he didn't want there to be any record of it.
you know, I don't know what you're talking about.
these aren't my accounts. All right?
this is the foundation's account.
my name isn't even on them.
which is why you hid the money there, to make it harder for us to find. These were charitable contributions.
Where's the girl?
what girl?
Mr. Quintana, you and your foundation are facing human smuggling charges.
do you really want me to add obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting a murderer to that?
you like the press, don't you?
how are you gonna like being linked to Cano Vega's murder?
you know what they'll see?
that I saved a girl from under Castro's regime.
for a price. Yeah, I would've done it for free.
Yeah, but you didn't.
are you really ready to stake your entire future on some girl you don't even know?
Vega had an apartment for her.
I took her there when I got her to the mainland. Where?
union city, summit avenue.
NYPD! MYPD!
NYPD! Police! Police!
police! Police! NYPD! NYPD!
clear. Clear.
clear.
looks like nobody's home.
this girl's in dire need of a trip to IKEA.
this bed hasn't even been made.
I don't think she was sleeping here.
Yeah.
looks like dirt.
get CSI down here.
you guys.
there's blood.
it's definitely Vega's.
and the footprint? That's harder to nail down. The composition of the dirt is pretty similar to dirt anywhere in the city.
so we can't actually prove that she was at the scene? I just said it's harder.
but there were traces of titanium dioxide in the dirt.
chalk. Like what they use to trace lines on baseball fields.
so she heads to the field, takes a little batting practice on Vega's head, heads home, packs her things, hits the road.
giving a whole new meaning to the term "hit-and-run.
Beckett. B-e-c-k-e double-t.
badge 4-1-3-1-9.
I need a TSA hold on a potential fugitive.
Yes, I'll hold.
uniforms are circulating that picture of Lara we got from Quintana.
they're plastering it on every storefront within a mile of her place.
so it was the girl?
evidence looks that way.
we figure she honey trapped Vega into giving her tickets out of Cuba, and when she got here, he wanted a little more than she was willing to give, and things went south from there. Maybe it was the Cuban government all along.
they hated Vega for defecting.
so they send a beautiful spy for him to fall in love with.
it works. He smuggles her back home, and bam!
he's dead.
sounds like a Castle story.
I'll call it "coraz de fuego." yes. I need a detain and contain.
all no-fly protocols. Thank you.
though we really should stake out the consulate. Way ahead of you.
surveillance has been there for about an hour.
if she killed him out of self-defense, then she'd go back to the devil she knows. And yet I'm sensing skepticism on my theory.
Yeah, thanks. Mind reader.
well, you're both geniuses. That was our guys at the consulate.
they just spotted Lara walking right through the door.
I don't know what to tell you.
I've never seen that girl before. Well, then you should invest in some corrective lenses.
our surveillance team saw her coming in here not half an hour ago.
surveillance team? You're watching us now? Only within the scope of the law.
the watcher becomes the watched.
I'm a big fan of irony. Ask her.
she's a Cuban citizen requesting asylum.
she's a suspect in a murder investigation.
and you expect me just to hand her over to the American authorities? Mr. Sanchez, as I'm sure you're well aware, a country's consulate and its embassy have a different set of rights and privileges.
this is only a consulate.
you do not have diplomatic immunity.
produce the girl now or I will get a search warrant and make a public spectacle of your government harboring a criminal on American soil.
no, I-I-I did not kill him.
please. You have to believe then why did you run?
why did you try to go back to Cuba? I was afraid the man will kill me, too.
what man? The one who come the night he died.
he come to... El piso.
the apartment. He came to the apartment. There was a man who came to the apartment the night that Vega died.
and that's why you were running?
he kill my father.
your father?
Cano Vega is your father?
O-okay, Lara, take us from the beginning.
Vega and my mother...
Vega and her mother were engaged when he defected.
she supposed to come, but she didn't.
as punishment for what Vega did, they threw her mother in prison.
she was pregnant with her at the time.
did Vega know about this?
not until a couple of months ago when he heard a rumor that he had a daughter. Well, that's why Vega went to Cuba.
to see if he really did have a daughter.
they didn't actually meet because the government was watching him.
but he got her a message saying that he would get her out as soon as he could.
the first time I meet my father was...
three nights ago, and I want to tell him how much suffering he caused.
she grew up believing that her father had abandoned her mother to get rich.
but he told her that that wasn't true...
that he only defected because her mother said that she was going to as well.
but that she had changed her mind at the last minute.
all these years, he had thought that she had turned her back on him.
he never knew that they
that the government had made an example of him to all the other players.
he never knew that she had died in prison.
my father...
is very upset when I tell him this.
he said he need to talk to someone.
he, uh, uh, give me money for food.
I never see him again.
you said earlier that there was a man at the apartment.
when I go to...
the market to go buy food, when I come back...
I see a man at the, um, um, apartment, not my father.
I was so scared, so I leave.
then I hear Cano Vega is dead.
so I run, and I hide.
I just wanted to go home.
he killed my father.
this man who came to your apartment...
can you describe him for me?
Yes.
let--let me get this straight.
an illegal claiming to be Cano Vega's daughter, after being in this country for less than 24 hours, identifies someone who kind of looks like me from a distance at night?
well, gee, guys.
what, do I--what, do I sign my confession right now or after the big, uh, press conference?
well, now's good.
come on, kids.
come on.
you know he was my friend.
not to mention, a hefty commission.
what's my motive? The thing about people who have a lot, Mr. Fox, is that they have the most to lose.
I'm sure Vega felt betrayed when he learned the truth.
the truth? About what?
your favorite story-- Barcelona, 1992.
only you left out the part where you lied to Cano Vega about helping his fianc defect.
it's not my fault that she changed her mind, all right? Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island.
but you did know that he'd rather be there with her than here making big bucks for you in the majors.
so you let him believe that she had changed her mind.
and to keep him from ever finding out the truth, you had her put away.
put away? In Cuba? Oh, come on.
I-I have a lot of pull, but, uh, influencing a military dictatorship isn't as easy as getting a dinner reservation at le cirque.
you'd influenced their people before.
manuel Gutierrez, a. K.a. El pulpo the octopus.
you walked away with the star player of the Cuban national team for a Rolex.
we did a little research.
he was the chief witness at her trial.
was denouncing Vega's fianc always a part of your plan with el pulpo or did you have to pay extra for that?
I've heard you're a killer negotiator.
you can't possibly be serious. When Vega figured out what you had done, he called you from his club and told you to meet him.
I think he came after you and threatened to destroy you and that's why you killed him. It's a hell of a story, kids.
I paid el pulpo to take care of my player's girl when the Cuban government is sending away people every day?
that's a hell of a tale.
it's pure conjecture.
you know what's not conjecture?
the blood that we found on the driver's side floor mat in your car.
that was Vega's blood. As much as you tried to clean those $5, 000 pair of shoes you were wearing while you smashed Vega's skull in, you didn't quite get all of it.
Hello, Cynthia. Call my lawyer.
you tell him he's about to earn the outrageous, obscene amounts of money I pay him.
turn around.
turn around.
robert Fox, you're under arrest for the murder of Cano Vega.
what's gonna happen to Lara?
she can stay in the states for a year, and then decide whether she wants to apply for citizenship or not.
Oh, I can't imagine her staying.
her last bit of family is gone.
I mean, the only person that she knew here is dead.
well, there is one more person that she should meet.
so you're Lara?
she was born in Cuba right after Mr. Vega defected.
she's not his girlfriend.
she's his daughter. Cano had a daughter?
my father...
didn't know how you would like to have me here.
he, uh... He had fear to tell you about me.
it's okay.
she says she knows her father loved you very much, and he didn't want to hurt you.
and that she hoped and he hoped that, together, you could be a family.
thank you.
Hey, dad.
Hey, daughter. What are you doing up so late?
waiting for you. Did I do something wrong?
no.
I was just thinking about what you said about your dad, how he could be anything you imagine him to be
an astronaut or a pirate.
whipped cream inventor. Or whipped cream inventor.
but there's one thing he can't be.
what's that? A dad.
just a regular dad, teaching his son how to ride a bike or helping him with homework or having a catch.
it makes me sad you didn't get to have those things.
well... I can't miss what I didn't have.
what if you could have it?
you have a time machine behind the kitchen counter?
what do you say, son?
how about a game of catch with your old man?
Yeah, I'd like that.
good.
you ready?
ready.
I'm the kind that pays better. Who am i? I'm rick castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I? Every writer needs inspiration, and i've found mine. Detective Kate Beckett.
Nikki heat? The character He's basing on you.
and thanks to my friendship With the mayor, I get to be on her case. I would be happy to let you spank me.
and together, we catch killers. We Make a pretty good team, you know?
like starsky and hutch, turner and Hooch. You do remind me a little of hooch.

really unfortunate
the world's top golfer had to pull out.

in five years.

new york times" best seller. Thank you. And you know what?
I really loved writing it.
well, the paperback comes out, uh, july 27th, right? July 27th. That's right.
and it's being made into a movie. Nice.
now you worked with actual nypd homicide detectives to research "heat wave.
Yes, yes, i did.
and-and they still Won't let me carry a gun.
I didn't know you worked with law enforcement.
it's kinda my weak spot. Hello.
waiter, check please.
you guys are single, right? Well, actually, not anymore, bobby.
thank you very much. Oh.
the camera really does add 10 pounds...
when a beautiful movie star is impressed with my fake law enforcement Credentials, I'm in.

he may have proposed by now.
and that's our show for tonight.
stay tuned for "late talk with mickey reed.
I'm bobby mann. Remember, folks...
the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night.
I always wonder what they're saying
when they lean in like that.
thank you. Thank you for coming.
they want me dead.
I'm sorry. What? - - I'm serious.
you work with cops, right? They want - that was a great show, guys.
I'm so sorry about segment three.
next time we put the Emu in a diaper. Mm-hmm.
I'll call you. Oh, the Box-in-box with justin...
Yeah. Looked great. I loved it.
good, good. Listen, i think we should...
you're going orienteering not librarying.
you sure you want to take that many books?
overambitious for a 5-day trip?
you're gonna be responsible for your own pack.
I think you're supposed to be more sacagawea
than a scholarly reader.
besides, Look at all those pages.
the trees might want revenge. Richard.
what's wrong?
Bobby mann is dead.
what? What happened?
they're saying he had a heart attack.
I'm telling you, the guy said That somebody wanted him dead,
and then he ends up dead. That can't be a coincidence.
Bobby mann had a history of heart disease,
and on the autopsy reports,
it states that the cause of death was a heart attack.
that can't be a coincidence either.
did lanie do the autopsy?
no, but she sent it to me.
okay, a guy was walking his dog,
saw mr. Mann collapse on the sidewalk alone.
but there's no puncture wounds, no bruising,
and the tox panel came back negative.
there's no foul play, Castle.
I talked to his producer this morning.
she said that mann left the studio at 12: 45
in his bugatti veyron. That's a $2-million car.
he collapsed on foot a few blocks from his house
at 4: 50. So?
so where's the car?
he's, like, A gazillionaire, castle.
he probably just parked it and expected someone else
to pick it up the next morning.
in my book "gathering storm," The former kgb official
killed with an undetectable poison
that stopped the heart.
what if that's what happened to mann?
need i remind you that you make up stuff for a living,
and there is no such poison in real life,
and if there was, there would be a whole slew
of angry spouses who'd be getting away with murder?
could you just have lanie take a closer look?
please.
you know how many strings I had to pull
for this, Castle?
if I'm wrong, i'll reimburse the city.
to hell with the city. It's me you're gonna owe.
I take spa certificates, jewelry and cash.
duly noted. What's that?
the contents of bobby mann's pockets when he was brought in.
I'm gonna go check on the labs.
okay.
what are you doing?
it's called investigating. You should try it.
I usually wait until there's a crime.
cell phone, money clip.
he stuck a piece of gum to a paper
before he put it in his pocket.
one of his last acts was not littering. Yes, but there's a word on this paper -"tory.
could be a mystery woman.
wow, castle. Cracking this case wide open.
Hey, it's his idea notepad.
this is a joke from last night. "charity golf.
first time he's pulled out in years." do you realize
that you are now Investigating a heart attack?
what?
his signature line of 20 years, "the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night,
looks like he was thinking of changing it.
the crew will be back on duty tomorrow night.
maybe he was trying to make it hipper.
we should have a signature line.
she's armed, he's dangerous.
no.
no. How about
a whole new chapter In crime solving?
chapter. Get it?
no.
okay, i ran every extra tox screen
outside of standard protocol.
all negative, no trace of any known poisonous substance.
okay, Castle?
don't forget to tip your m. e. On the way out. Ah, not so fast.
secondary tox panel
detected traces of tyramine, Which is harmless,
but it's presence raised a red flag for me.
so i ran some more tests.
Bobby Mann was taking phenelzine. Phenelzine?
a prescription drug for depression. So?
so phenelzine is in a class of drugs
called m. a.o. Inhibitors
that have powerful contra-indicators. You mean drug interactions?
in this case, interactions that can kill.
M. a.o. Inhibitors Contra-indicate
even the smallest amount can trigger a hypertensive crisis.
Oh! Almost like an undetectable poison that stops the heart.
which doesn't mean that he was murdered.
he could've accidentally eaten or drank something
he shouldn't have. That's what I thought. So I ran the contents of his intestines.
in the hours prior to his death,
he ingested three substances
something sugary, like hard candy... or chewing gum.
there you go.
also cranberry juice and balsamic Vinegar. Which is fermented.
and there was no trace of anything
that you would find balsamic on
no chicken, no fish no pasta.
just the cranberry juice.
which could've easily masked the color
and the taste of the balsamic Vinegar. So you're saying
that somebody knew about Bobby mann's condition,
slipped balsamic vinegar into his cranberry juice,
knowing that it would kill him?
this was no accident. Bobby mann was murdered.
well, Bobby, you were right.
no crime scene, No clear place
to begin the investigation.
don't you just love poisonings?
especially a poisoning without poison.
whoever did this was very smart.
they chose a murder weapon that's probably
in half the kitchens in the city. Good thing we're smart, too.
Thanks. That was lanie.
based on possible rates of Fatal m. A.o. I. Interactions,
she was able to narrow the window of poisoning down
between 1: 30 and 4: 30 in the morning. That makes...
this...
our kill zone
1: 30 to 4: 30.
what else? Well, the lab said that there was no traces of cranberry juice
or balsamic vinegar in the gum we found in mann's pocket.
so he must have chewed that before he was poisoned.
well, we know he left the studio at 12: 45. which means he wasn't poisoned there.
and we know that his home security records
show that he never made it there. 12: 45 to 4: 50 in the morning,
leaves in his car, is found on foot.
so what was he doing that whole time?
so the vehicle locator
in mann's bugatti Is not sending a signal.
probably in an underground parking Garage. Which means it could be anywhere.
check his cell phone, see if He made any calls last night,
and then go to his brownstone. Castle and I will head
to the studio and see what we can dig up there.
Oh, guys. Yeah.
no talk of murder. The longer we can keep this
away from the press, The better off we'll be.
I'm sorry.
I don't know where he went after the show last night.
what is this about anyway? I thought bobby...
died of a heart attack, right?
we're just tying up loose ends for the coroner.
how was Mr. Mann Acting recently?
did you notice anything unusual?
no. He was great.
except yesterday.
what happened yesterday? I don't know.
I mean, he spent the morning locked up in his office alone.
and then the rest of the day, he was agitated
and he was acting weird.
weird how? Paranoid.
at one point he asked me if i had heard anything,
and i said, "about what?" And he just shrugged it off.
were you aware that he was on powerful antidepressants?
I mean, he tried to be very private about it,
but when he went on them, he had to quit drinking,
and people wondered why. So word got around.
you don't think that's what killed him, do you?
something he ate or- Or drank?
he was very careful like I said, we're just following up.
I keep looking over at that curtain, you know,
waiting for him to walk through...
like this was all one big publicity stunt.
so he would've told you if there was anything wrong?
like what? Like if he was concerned for his well-being.
what's this all about?
I- i thought he died of a heart attack.
just routine questioning, Mr. Mcphee.
you know, some of the people said that he seemed
a little agitated recently.
come to think of it, he was a little preoccupied.
I asked him about it after the show last night,
but he insisted he was fine.
man, I am so sorry.
nightmares really happen. Huh? Yeah. You know mickey
host of "late talk," right after our show?
Yes, of course. I'm a big fan.
I love your whole "booty roulette" gag.
that's great. I'm rick. Castle. Yeah. Saw you on the show last night.
I'm detective kate beckett. Nice to meet you.
so do either of you know where bobby went
after the show last night?
we're trying to track his last hours for the coroner's report.
no clue.
I think he said something about going to see his ex-wife.
did he say which one? Mnh-mnh.
how many ex-wives did he have?
6, ranging in ages from 25 to 50.
it seems every five years, he traded in for the latest model.
so he didn't so much marry them as lease them.
so i ran all their names through the system,
and guess what popped up.
seems wife number five here was arrested
over an altercation with bobby at a restaurant uptown. She's got crazy eyes.
well, there's more. According to the doorman in her building,
Bobby mann was there last night after the show.
Mrs. Mann, when was the last time you saw your ex-husband?
about a year ago...
in court.
he took out a restraining order against me.
well, according to the complaint,
you did threaten to kill him.
well, i don't really remember what was said.
I wish you were dead, you little weasel.
he was dating a younger woman, and she looked just like me.
tell that to his previous wife.
were you aware of his dietary restrictions? Sure.
nothing fermented or it could give him a heart attack.
Why? You think I had something to do with it?
you tell me, mrs. Mann. according to your doorman,
Bobby showed up at your building last night.
he did? Cindy, we know you saw him.
how do you know he wasn't there to see barbara?
his first wife.
she's got an apartment In the building, too.
we both got 'em in the divorce settlement.
Bobby co-owned the building.
Yeah, I saw bobby last night.
he came by around 1: 00 in the morning,
woke me up as usual.
did he often surprise you in the middle of the night?
I was the one woman who fell in love with him
before all the fame and the money.
whenever he felt insecure, he came around.
mostly it was the same old stuff
his ratings were down or... he was getting old.
but last night...
what?
it was different.
he looked... haunted.
he said something was going on,
something awful.
what was going on? He wouldn't tell me.
he asked me if i thought he was a good person.
and I held his hand and I said, "bobby, "you're a lousy husband,
but you're a hell of a man.
then he left.
at what time?
around quarter after 1: 00.
did he say where he was going?
no.
I thought he was going home.
something awful was going on.
he knew someone was after him.
but he doesn't tell his ex-wife or his best friend.
instead he tells me.
maybe it's because he knew you were working with the cops.
tell me I'm a good person? Like he was doing something he was ashamed of.
okay.
neighbors confirm Barbara mann's story.
one of them saw bobby leave her apartment at 1: 15 a. m.
that's outside of our kill zone, which means
we need to figure out where he went to next.
let's canvass all the garages in the area,
see if we can find Mann's car.
and let's also look into his financials
for the usual secrets - drugs, gambling, prostitution. Yeah.
hello.
Ellie? Hi.
Ellie monroe, from the show.
Yeah. No, I know.
I understand.
no, I think that's a- a great idea.
Yeah.
okay, I'll meet you there.
Bye.
Ellie monroe, huh?
Yeah, she's pretty upset about this whole Bobby Mann thing,
that we were his last guests.
she thinks it would be comforting
if we were to be together. "comforting"?
is that what the cool kids call it these days?
you are so cynical.
you know, sometimes after a tragedy,
two human beings just need to-to be with each other
just for no other reason than to show each other
some understanding and support.
I'm just glad I can be comforting.
Oh! Yes.
good morning, detective.
Really?
what?
lose the "i just got laid" voice, all right?
what are you talking about?
I am a trained detective, so don't bother denying it. Okay, fine.
Oh, so now you're not denying it?
you just told me not to.
Hey, guys. Any news on the car?
nothing at any of the garages near barbara mann's building.
so we checked restaurant valets in the area.
Bobby paid the guy at mozart's 100 bucks
to keep it close while he ran up to his ex.
witness says he left a little before 1: 30.
61st and central park west.
where did he go after that?
maybe check traffic cams in the area.
a guy In a sports car like that
might have blasted through some red lights. Yeah. It's a bit of a hail mary, but it's worth a try.
maybe we don't need traffic cams.
why not just the man on the street?
I mean, a celebrity in a bugatti veyron? Come on.
people aren't just gonna notice that.
they are going to talk about it, or more specifically, tweet.
and...
Booyah.
1: 37 a. M. Bobby mann F. T.W.
just saw him driving some spaceship car
into a garage at broadway and 57th.
on it.
F. T.w."? "for the win.
it means, uh, "my tweet kicks your tweet's butt.
come on, beckett. You gotta keep up. Hang with the cool kids.
I believe this is for you.
I'll just- Um, i'll just take that.
I'm just gonna... Take that. Mm-hmm.
pardon me one sec.
Hey, ellie.
Yes, yes.
last night was great, wasn't it?
Yeah, i'd love to.
tonight? Sure.
all right. I'll see you then.
more comforting?
parking garage at 1525 broadway confirms
Bobby mann pulled in at 1: 37 a.m .
and he never came back for his car.
and what's at 1525 broadway?
the park-view penthouse of mickey reed,
the gregarious and affable host of "late talk.
Oh, mickey... Not so fine.
doorman let bobby up to his place at 1: 45 a. M.
neighbors complained of a loud argument.
Bobby left a little after 2: 00.
so mickey lied to us.
he saw bobby somewhere right in the middle of our kill zone.
you think he was a good host,
offered bobby a drink?
this set looks like an old-age home.
everything needs to be updated-no purple, no suede,
no faux finish-and get rid of this stupid thing. Measuring drapes already, mr. Reed?
like it or not, detective,
the network wants me to take over
Bobby's time slot next week right after the tribute.
I know it seems callous,
but it's what bobby would've wanted.
even over his dead body? Excuse me?
why did you lie to us about seeing mann the other night?
okay.
look, I'm sorry,
but i lied because i didn't want it getting out.
that you two were fighting? It's hard enough filling the man's shoes around here.
I don't need the tabloids writing about us getting into it
on the night he died.
so I lied. So what? So you lied to a cop.
let's be realistic.
the guy died from a heart attack, right?
what? It was a heart attack that was a result
of toxins in his system, toxins that he ingested
somewhere around the time that you saw him.
so you guys Are saying I killed Bobby?
Why? Well, it's no secret,
you were supposed to get his 11: 30 slot,
but bobby extended his contract.
maybe you couldn't wait.
you sound as demented as Bobby. What do you mean?
last time I saw him, We're best of pals, right?
the other night he comes over, He's ranting and raving,
talking about what a disloyal punk i've been.
Why? Man, I don't know.
all he kept saying was, He knew things.
and I'm like, "Bobby, What are you talking about?
he storms out saying I knew what I'd done.
C. S.u.'s at mickey's apartment running a sweep for our toxin.
killing the king of late-night to take his throne
it's very "richard iii.
it appeals to the writer in me. Did you want a bite of this?
hell, i'll sick god on you! And you?
I don't ever want to see you on my network again.
you're banned! And you?!
I don't know you.
you're all a bunch of nobodies! I could buy this precinct!
Howard weisberg, president of the network.
he just found out about the search warrant
for mickey reed.
and he also found out that we think bobby mann was murdered. How?
breaking news on a different network.
the guy got scooped on his own star's murder.
so much for keeping the press out. You two better be right about all this.
text giggling? Really?
it's alexis. She just saw a loon feeding.
funny. So did I.
Hey. So... Mann's bugatti Is still in the garage.
they won't let us touch it without a search warrant.
$2-million car.
apparently, it's worth more than their insurance policy.
you sure they aren't Joyriding?
all right, check with the judge. Mm-hmm.
if his car is still in the garage,
Where'd he go after mickey's place?
well, it couldn't have been very far.
Hey, ryan. Did mickey's doorman mention
what direction mann was headed when he left?
South.
South.
south on broadway from 57th.
that's the theater district. At 2: 00 in the morning? There's nothing playing then.
well, there's diners, there's clubs,
there's restaurants. Well, other than the poison and the gum,
we know he didn't eat or drink anything.
maybe "tory" is a place he went.
Conservatory, inventory, purgatory
factory! The comic factory. Mann was a comedian.
he went to a comedy club. Comic Factory is on, uh, 55th and broadway.
that's two blocks south. He put his gum in a
in a piece of paper from a comic factory flyer.
you're right. Then from the forensics, We know he didn't have the cranberry or the balsamic before he spit it out. So He was poisoned either at or after the club.
then mickey reed didn't kill bobby.
he's not our guy.
Hey, guys.
how do you feel about going to see a little comedy?
the guy's got the most recognizable face in comedy. Yeah, I know.
look, i got a call on the club phone.
the caller i. D.'s from bobby's show.
a guy asks about one of my comedians.
couple hours later, guy shows up to see that comedian,
but he's got a funny looking moustache
and he's wearing a baseball cap. It looked like bobby.
did he talk to anyone? Did he have a drink? No. He sat in the back,
left his drink ticket, and bolted out the side
after watching the comedian he came to see.
anything special about this particular comedian?
the proverbial rising star?
I'm assuming you know about the incident that night?
what incident?
I'm angel santana. Good night, y'all.
ms. Santana.
I'm detective esposito. This is detective ryan. Hey.
Oh, hey. Thanks for coming.
the officer I talked to did not instill a lot of confidence.
you want to tell us about it? Not much to tell. During my set that night,
someone smashed my bike's taillight,
banged up the fenders
and scratched "late-night bitch" into the tank.
I mean, what does that even mean?
actually, we're not here about your bike.
ms. Santana, did you know Bobby mann?
you mean personally? No. Why?
well, because he came to see your act
on the night he was Killed. Any idea why? Wow.
he probably trashed my bike. I've heard stories about him.
I know guys he's blackballed just because they did
his competitors' show. Is there any reason why he might have wanted to come after you?
his producer tried to book me on his show last month,
but mickey reed wanted me, too.
I had to pick. Mickey felt more like my vibe.
club owner said Bobby left at 2: 30,
and the bartender confirms he didn't drink anything.
which leaves us... two hours left to account for
and a whole lot of strange behavior.
why would bobby go see a comedian
who didn't want to do his show and then bust up her bike?
aren't famous people crazy and narcissistic? I don't know. Gotta ask castle.
where is castle anyway?
I'm gonna need some new shirts.
no shirts.
good morning.
it's okay, castle. You don't have to pretend
to not be in a good mood for my sake.
why should I be in a good mood?
I mean... I'm a writer.
we... famously brood.
we... I should brood more.
you want to brood?
forensics on Angel Santana's motorcycle
are a bust.
there's no fingerprints. Nothing.
we have no idea where mann was after 2: 30.
what about his car?
Ryan and esposito got a warrant this morning.
but seeing that he was poisoned After he parked it,
chances are We won't find anything.
and his financials Were clear.
he pays more in alimony
in a day than i make In an entire year.
there's no red flags on his phone records.
and i reinterviewed all of his colleagues.
no one has any idea why he was acting so paranoid.
you're not paranoid if someone's Actually trying to kill you.
Hey, tony! How's my favorite Movie mogul?
Yes. Right?
she'd be perfect for nikki.
Yes. Perfect.
thank you.
that's a "heat wave" Producer.
that wasn't about Ellie monroe, was it?
Yeah, why? Oh.
what?
that's why she was throwing herself at you.
she wanted you to recommend Her for the part. What?
Oh, and for the record, She's nothing like nikki heat.
Oh, you just can't stand it That a beautiful actress
is actually interested in me. Why would i care?
exactly. That's a good question. Why would you care?
I don't. Fine. I'm gonna go get some coffee.
fine. I've got work to do.
break room's that way.
desk. Beckett.
castle. Check this out.
we just finished the sweep of bobby's car. Mm-hmm.
first off, the bugatti- Holy shift.
when you start this thing, you can feel it right in
but as exciting as the car is,
I think we figured out why Bobby Mann was so tweaked.
we found this In his glove compartment.
that's kayla. She's an intern at bobby's show.
looks like she was doing more than interning.
you should check out The back.
if they find out, You're dead.
blackmail, death threats and scandal.
that explains why his behavior was so Erratic. And probably why he was killed.
it was last week.
I stayed late to help bobby With some bits.
do you have any idea Who took that, kayla?
must be someone who works on the show.
who just happened to have a camera
and managed to catch the two of you in the act?
or were they tipped off maybe?
were you blackmailing bobby?
Oh, my god. No. He's three times your age,
and you are an intern on the show.
that adds up to embarrassment and scandal,
which I'm sure he'd pay a lot to avoid.
no, i would never do that.
we were in love.
in love? Really?
and... How long were the two of you together?
three weeks this past monday.
who else knew?
no one. Bobby and i kept it a secret.
we didn't want my mom to find out.
your mom?
who's your mom?
he was banging my daughter Right under my nose?
I will kill him! He's already dead.
well, i will kill him again.
I don't care. Where's the Corpse? Ms. Marks, we just
Kayla, my office, now! Move It! Mom, you don't understand
you realize, if this gets out,
it'll destroy Bobby's reputation.
we're not trying to add to an already difficult situation.
we're just trying to find the Killer. Bobby wasn't an angel,
but you look at the man In his entirety.
he deserves to be remembered With grace.
this business gets clouded by money, fame, ambition.
the only thing that bobby really cared about
was making people laugh.
well, whoever took this either works for this show
or had access to this building.
and maybe it was someone In a financial jam
who was looking to score a quick buck.
or maybe it's someone with a grudge against bobby.
I can't imagine Anyone doing that.
he was a great boss. Everyone loved him.
Yeah, and apparently, He loved them back.
okay. Uh, janine can get you a list of everyone on the crew
once she's done yelling at kayla.
poor kid. Who knows?
she might have ended up being number seven. Excuse me.
what have we got?
well, once we suspected blackmail,
I ran through his financials again. I thought they were clean.
well, they were, but going back, we found this.
he spent 100 grand on a kitchen reno.
totally legitimate, but we searched his brownstone
and he wasn't renovating his kitchen.
so who was on the receiving end of the 100 grand?
good bad-guy name.
Snakey "z," hard "k." Even has "rob" in it.
good bad-guy rap sheet, too.
former lowlife private Investigator. I remember this guy.
he had some celebrity clients back in the day.
he was known for digging up dirt on folks
and turning it into a personal payday.
he did a nickel on Multiple counts of extortion,
wire tapping, racketeering and blackmail.
well, robinson must have Gotten the picture
from somebody on the inside. Sure. Figured it was worth a fast buck.
but if bobby paid, Why would he kill him?
Bobby figured out that Robinson was a blackmailer,
and then he threatened to take him to the Cops. Bobby pushes, robinson pushes back harder.
let's go pick him up. Easier said than done.
Esposito already ran down His last known address.
robinson's in the wind.
well, let's keep looking.
you are a bad man, Zach robinson.
a dirty, naughty, No-good blackmailer.
do you do all your Interrogations in bed,
detective heat? You think This is funny, robinson?
okay, okay.
no, i'll do whatever you want, nikki.
okay. That's more like it.
you are so sweet.
and brilliant.
guilty.
what are you thinking?
nothing.
it's ridiculous.
what? Come on. Tell me. I want to know what goes on
inside that incredible mind of yours.
well, since you put it that way.
I have this... friend at work
who thinks that the only reason you're with me is,
you know... for the part in the movie.
Really?
what does this friend of yours base that on?
you know what? I'm- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't Have repeated that.
does this friend know me? No.
has he read anything about me that would make him think
that i would prostitute myself for a role?
no. Of course not.
You-i-he's an idiot.
do you have any idea how hard it is
to be a woman in hollywood?
I
Oh, yeah.
he looks like a zach robinson.
Where'd you find him?
the boys caught up with him
at a craps table at mohegan sun.
already gambling away his Hard-earned blackmail money?
so how was your date with your little starlet? How can you tell this time?
like i said, castle... trained detective.
well... It went lovely
no thanks to you.
what did i have to do with it? You pulled your jedi mind trick on me.
you made me doubt Ellie's honesty.
foolishly, i told her what you said, made her cry.
castle... She's an actress,
a professional liar.
she's paid to cry on cue.
no.
I've never seen this picture before.
Really?
you sure you didn't use it to blackmail bobby mann?
blackmail?
you're fishing In the wrong pond, detective.
what about the 100 grand
from bobby mann In your bank account?
am i in the right pond now?
that was for... services rendered.
I don't think webster's Defines "blackmailing
as a service.
more like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.
no, no. No, no. I never threatened bobby.
he hired me.
to do what?
my guys say that you don't have an alibi
for the night that mann was murdered.
you can't be serious.
I guess it'll come out when we go to the murder trial.
have a nice life... sentence.
what? No, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
look, he reached out to me. Said he needed some work done.
what kind of work?
the kind that you get paid a lot extra to do.
something illegal.
w- well...
okay, look, he thought that somebody was out to get him.
he said he needed to know,
and so he paid me to bug a guy's office.
who?
Howard weisberg. The president of the network?
easy gig, too. Bobby got me Into the building.
when was this?
week ago. What did you Do with the recordings?
I delivered the cds to Bobby. When?
you know...
the morning before he died.
Bobby's producer said
he locked himself In his office that morning.
he was listening to the recordings. And then
they said he started acting paranoid after that,
so what did he hear?
am i good to go?
we found the recordings In mann's office
mixed in with his dvd collection.
heard anything yet that would explain
why mann was listening in on his boss? Nah, Just a bunch of talk about setting up breakfasts,
lunches, dinners and drinks with writers, actors and directors.
where are we on the blackmail? Oh, we got uniforms running down all show employees
who could've had access to the studio to take that photo.
you guys are gonna want to hear this.
you know what? To hell with Bobby Mann.
we're losing money on him every damn night.
I want him out! Our hands our tied. You can't fire him.
he's got five years left on his contract. What if he drops dead, huh?
seriously. The guy has got a bad heart.
how hard would it be to make him go away?
I mean, hell, i got mickey reed telling me every day, he's ready to step in if we could just get Bobby mann Out the damn door.
well, no wonder bobby thought mickey was disloyal. And no wonder he thought someone wanted him dead.
someone did.
what if he drops dead, huh?
seriously. The guy has got a bad heart.
how hard would it be to make him go away?
looks like you got your wish, Mr. Weisberg.
detective, none of the recordings
are admissible in court.
Oh, relax, burt. I didn't kill anyone, okay?
save it for when I actually do.
detective, i wasn't serious. Bobby thought you were.
well, then maybe he shouldn't Have been bugging my office.
hell, in private, i issue a dozen death sentences a day
on underperforming, overpaid Jackasses at my network.
now what i wanted was Mickey reed pulled to 11: 30.
but bobby had an $80-million penalty
on his contract. Which still had another five years left on it.
Yeah. Now what i did was lean on Bobby for a few months
to appeal to a younger audience.
but the worst thing that i did was threaten to fire him
and pay him the $80 mil.
Mr. Weisberg, where were you between 1: 30 and 4: 30 a. M.
the night of the murder?
you don't have to answer that. It's fine, burt. Chill out.
I was at the essex house Hotel. Were you with anyone?
as a matter of fact i was. This actress i was screwing
wanted a part on one of my sitcoms.
I met her after Bobby's show.
I'm gonna need a name.
sure. Ellie monroe.
thank you for coming by Ms. Monroe.
of course.
Weisberg's alibi...
is good.
Oh, go on. You can say it.
I told you so.
no, thanks. I'm actually not in the gloating mood.
his alibi sets us back to square one...
which means we have no idea who the blackmailer is
and we don't know why mann went to the comedy club
and trashed Angel santana's bike.
and we have no idea who the killer is.
well, the good news is, I can work all night.
no plans.
you know, it's late, and I'm kinda tired.
how about we pick this up in the morning? All righty, then.
and the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow,
to coin a phrase...
which would be inaccurate...
because you are not a boy.
is this some kind of a weird come-on?
I think i know what bobby mann was doing at that comedy club.
I think i know why he thought he was an awful person.
and... I think i know who killed him.
Mr. Mcphee?
I was just going over my notes for the tribute.
35 years of friendship
it's kinda hard to find just the right story to tell.
what can i do for you?
we just came by to give you this.
Bobby's idea book- We thought you might like it.
Thanks. We did have a question about what he wrote on the last page.
the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night.
actually, He crossed out "boys
and wrote "gang, posse" and "crew.
any idea why?
I guess we'll never know.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
the network was pressuring Bobby to make a change.
they threatened to cancel him unless he did. And the night that he was murdered,
he told barbara that something awful was going on.
he asked her If he was a good person.
why would he say that?
because of kayla.
not kayla, hank.
because of you. He knew that he had to fire you.
he knew he needed to find someone younger and hipper
if he was gonna survive.
someone like angel santana.
weisberg confirmed that she was on the network's short list.
that's why it wasn't "boys" anymore, hank.
cause angel's a girl.
this is ridiculous. Bobby would never fire me.
then why did you kill him? I didn't.
we ran your credit cards, Hank.
the night that he was murdered, you went
to a 24-hour grocery store and bought two things
cranberry juice and balsamic vinegar.
it's time stamped. 1: 56 a. M.
and I'm betting If we test your keys,
we'll find metal from Angel santana's motorcycle
where you scratched in "late-night bitch.
he told me...
that night just before he left the studio...
how he'd heard weisberg say
they were gonna bury him unless he made a change.
35 years, i had his back.
he was gonna toss me aside like one of his ex-wives,
humiliate me in front of the whole country.
I knew it was coming. I saw all the little signs,
the awkward moments In the hall.
I sent him that picture of him and kayla
to remind him of all the secrets i kept.
you know what he said?
the scandal would only help his ratings.
you bought your poison
and you followed him to the club.
I confronted him when he came out.
I told him not to throw away everything we'd built.
he told me He couldn't save me.
weisberg was going younger with or without him.
well, if you knew he didn't have a choice, why did you kill him?
because he did have another choice.
go down with the ship!
we both go out gracefully,
and bobby Gets 80 million bucks
instead of him continuing the show with some kid.
I gave him over 4, 000 shows,
laughing at every lousy joke he cracked,
whether they were funny or not.
jeez.
so how did you manage it?
when i knew I couldn't change his mind,
I told him...
I understood.
we walked over to the west side highway,
sat on a bench, looked out at the water,
talked about what a great run we'd had.
then i offered him a drink.
he was my best friend.
you don't do that to your friend.
yet another example of
why you shouldn't mix business with pleasure,
even show business.
are you talking about the case or yourself?
Yeah.
touch? Detective.
so you want to go for a victory lap
and grab a burger?
Oh, can't. Gotta go. Big Date. You're kidding, right?
you're going out with Ellie monroe even though
you know the only reason that she was interested in you
was for a part?
have you lost all sense of human decency
and self-res-what?
my big date... Is with alexis.
she's getting back From her trip.
right on time, alexis.
Oh, sacagawea...
has returned!
and you are not sacagawea,
but come in.
Thanks.
I'm headed back to l. A.
and i just wanted to... say sorry.
Thanks. But the truth is,
I've never had so much fun being used.
you feel free to have at me anytime.
well, i guess you'll rescind your recommendation of me
to your producers, and that is the least i deserve - no, tony thinks you are great for it, and so do i.
you are a better actres than I thought
when I recommended you.
well, you should know, I wasn't acting the whole time.
me neither.
Thanks, rick.
take care.
you, too.
Bye.
Hi.
dad, was that
my sacagawea has returned!
Oh, my god. My best girl. I missed you so much.
Oh, my god. I'm so glad you're home.
I missed you, too, dad.
you're not just saying that, are you? What
no, don't. Tell me you're hungry. I'm starving.
come with me. Tell me everything. I will.
it was very "Sad Cat Lady meets David Bowie."
this is what it's come to - dumpster-diving to find fabric for our midterm haute couture project.
well, you know what they say: One man's trash is another man's...
I think I found something. Oh! Me too!
Oh! It's stuck.
that's because we're both tugging on it.
let go. I had it first.
Oh, this fabric is just to die for.
this would look stunning on you - just stunning.
Ah, you know.
I am just trying to expose Katherine to the glorious world of wedding magazines.
they are all very girly, with a lot of gauzy photos of love-struck brides looking off into the distance.
perhaps they're contemplating the 50% divorce rate.
you need to get beyond the fairytale-treacle aspect of these magazines and see them for what they are
a source of ideas as you plan your wedding.
Yeah.
like this place. The Cordova House?
uh, a landmark Spanish revival mansion with an elegant carriage-house exterior.
it was built at the turn of the century, remains an enduring legacy of architectural beauty in the heart of Manhattan.
Aha. I remember the Cordova House.
it was like a cultural venue for the arts in the 70's.
I think I went to a party there.
of course, it was the 70's, so I can't be sure.
this?
and they've started to book weddings. I love it. It's gorgeous.
could it be that we've stumbled upon a venue???
Yeah! I mean, I'm good with it. Are you?
you're welcome.
Ah! Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Sorry.
I'm gonna make, um... some inquiries right now.
uh, you're gonna have to do it while we're working a case.
okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right.
apparently, we aren't the only ones who read that article.
the event planner at the Cordova House Said they've been swamped with calls.
okay. When's their next available date? She said she's gonna call me back.
Hey, Espo, what have we got?
a body found by two fashion students Dumpster-diving for fabric.
victim's name is Ella Hayes. She's 26.
according to her driver's license, ???? What's she doing down here in the garment district?
she was?
her business card says that she works for Modern Fashion.
she's an assistant to the editor-in-chief. Yeah, that would be Matilda King.
okay. Seriously? You've never heard of Matilda King?
I'm betting that most real men haven't.
mm, yes, if by "real" you mean "uninformed." Whatever.
Matilda King is a legend in the fashion industry.
or infamous - depends on your point of view.
Yes. Former assistants of hers have written books about how tough she is.
a dragon lady - chews people up and spits them out.
does she also strangle ? bcause that's how Lanie said our vic died.
Hey, Lanie. Hey.
so, the murder weapon was a scarf, a sash, or something.
okay. When did this happen? Based on lividity, between 12: 00 and 2: 00 a. m.
I also recovered some blue hairs on her neck left by the attacker.
blue hairs? So she was killed by a little old lady?
Or...Katy Perry.
animal hairs that were died blue, Castle.
or... A Dr. Seuss character.
I don't recall any of them being homicidal.
that's true. I need a new theory.
well, I've got one. Our killer was strong.
and he or she was able to lift the body into the dumpster.
Espo, can you get uniforms To canvass the area for any witnesses?
castle and I will go to her work. You and ryan head off to her place
if there is anything that'll indicate why she was here last night. Right on.
Ella and I went to parsons together.
and then we've been roommates for the past two years.
I still can't believe this.
when was the last time you saw her?
yestoday IN THE MORNING
she was up at 5: 00, like always, and then out the door to get Matilda's coffee and cranberry scone ?
what about after work - did you see her then?
no I'm a buyer at Saks, so I don't get home till late.
did Ella have a boyfriend or a relationship?
no.
she was on call for Matilda 24/7, so she didn't have time for relationships or for the one thing that she really wanted to do.
which was what? Design.
she hoped working at Modern Fashion???
was Ella having any problems that you know of?
um... She had been stressed lately, A little more than usual.
I ask. She said it was work, but she didn't go into details.
lilian, if you don't mind, I'd like to have an officer come by and take your statement.
of course. Anything I can do to help.
Oh, we don't get cell reception in here.
you can use my landline if you like. Thanks.
here's my card.
if you can remember anything else, Please give me a call, okay?
Yeah. Thank you.
well, this is it
the big leagues for anyone who wants to work in fashion.
Wow. Apparently, you have to be a total hottie just work here.
and I'm saying that as a completely detached, soon-to-be-married observer.
it's okay, Castle. Stare all you want. Really?
actually, no. But it's kind of hard not to.
I mean, Matilda only hires people That fit the magazine's brand. You have to...Look the part.
you seem to know a lot about Matilda King. Yeah, well, I've picked up a thing or two.
Hi. Nypd. We need to speak with Matilda King.
do you have? Oh, I think you missed the part about the Nypd.
please.
I just?
she's going to freak out if I add you to the schedule.
do you have any idea what happened to the last assistant? Yes. She's dead.
dead? What do you mean?
no, no, no, no. Oh, god. Here she comes.
I won't take no for an answer. You must join us on the yacht.
giorgio will show his new collection. Gordon ramsay is cooking.
lady gaga is performing.
pushing the boundaries of style - No doubt, in the wrong direction.
so, let me know.
new assistant. It's carrie.
I'll learn your name when you've earned it. Here.
Oh, uh, these are your messages, and Julian Bruckner is waiting in your office.
and who is this?
Uh...Nypd.
we need to ask you a few questions, ms. King.
I never could forget those cheekbones.
uh, what - you two know each other?
uh...Yeah. Yeah.
when I was a model... For about 15 minutes.
you modeled for Modern Fashion?
I offered her a spread in the January '99 issue.
Nicole kidman was on the cover. And you passed.
to date, you're the only person to ever tell me no.
I'm wall-to-wall. We'll have to reschedule.
uh, get ready to be told no again.
we need to ask you a few questions About your assistant, Ella Hayes.
it cannot wait. We'll talk in my office. Hold my calls.
by the way, Ella is my former assistant.
be right with you, Julian.
okay.
uh, so, what do you mean by "former"?
I fired her yesterday afternoon, After she made a scheduling mistake and I showed up to a board meeting late.
and that was after her mistake last week, when I kept the new owner of our magazine waiting for 45 minutes.
Matilda, have you seen the proofs from the "fab five" photo shoot?
they are divine. They'd better be, Julian.
so far, everything you've submitted?
Oh, Matilda, these designers are barely out of diapers.
eExcuse me. Sorry.
we're investigating a murder here.
murder? Of whom?
your former assistant, Ella.
El- Ella's dead? How?
that's what we're trying to figure out. Now, do you know if she had any problems?
you don't think this had anything to do with that incident with Grace? What incident?
and who's Grace?
grace is my other assistant, whom I fired because she allowed the scheduling mistakes to happen. And what was the incident?
well, apparently, yesterday, when Ella and Grace Were escorted out of the building by security, they literally got into a brawl, right in the middle of a photo shoot.
the photographer, Serge, had to break it up.
Serge: Yeah. The two of them really went at it.
I mean, it was a full-on catfight. It was actually kind of sexy.
what exactly was the fight about?
it WAS ABOUT THE JOB OK?
I overheard Grace blame Ella for - for getting her fired.
Yumi: Serge! How long?
I'm up against a deadline to finish my design.
you'll be here as long as it takes to make Matilda happy.
the mantra we all live by.
uh, did you remember any other details about the fight?
I can do better than that. I can show you something.
I was shooting att that time and got a few frames with them in the background.
there. Check it out.
can...you zoom in on that?
sure. Check out Grace's scarf.
Lanie said she found blue hairs on Ella's neck
from being strangled. Looks like Grace was dressed to kill.
look, I grew up reading Modern Fashion.
working for Matilda King, that was my dream.
but when Matilda fires someone, people remember, which means my career in fashion is pretty much done, thanks Ella because you believed it was her fault that you got fired.
it was her fault.
she started making mistakes because she was so busy sucking up to designers like Yumi and showing off her sketches, and I paid the price.
which is why you killed her. What are you even talking about?
we got in a fight. That was it.
okay, okay. Then explain this.
this blue alpaca scarf was found at your apartment.
it's an exact match to the hairs Found on Ella's neck after she was strangled.
come on. Other people have that scarf.
Yeah, but you're the only one with motive.
it was the christmas gift from Modern Fashion.
we all?
maybe Ella was wearing hers and someone choked her with it.
where were you between 12: 00 and 2: 00 a.m. Grace?
I'd just gotten fired. Some friends took me out and got me drunk.
you can ask them. I will. In the meantime, let's talk about Ella.
her roommate thought that she was having trouble?
you worked with her. You know what it was?
actually, there was something else.
a few days ago, at lunchtime, I saw her arguing with this guy outside the building.
did you recognize him? I'd never seen him before.
but I overheard them, and he was threatening her.
he said she had something he wanted and he wouldn't take no for an answer.
and what was her reaction? She said she was gonna call the police if he didn't leave her the hell alone, and then he stormed off.
I- I tried to ask her what it was all about, BUT ???
do you remember him well enough to help us with a sketch?
I think so. Okay, this is the guy who threatened Ella.
so, you believe Grace's story? Well she?
and unis found two witnesses that saw him arguing with Ella.
Ella was basically a glorified assistant.
what could she possibly have had that this man wanted?
well, think about it, Castle.
Matilda king is the most influential person in fashion, and Ella had direct access to her world.
so you're saying this man leveraged Ella to find out what direction hemlines are going next season?
Ooh! I just came up with a new title. "Murder is the new black."
does that even make sense?
no it doesn't.
did you guys find something at Ella's apartment? You could say that.
I went to use the landline, and I noticed some static when I got near a lamp.
when we popped that lamp open, look what we found inside. A bug?
why would someone bug Ella's apartment?
Because...She is la femme nikita, and her job at Modern Fashion is just a cover.
she's not la femme nikita.
still, wiretaps, threats from mysterious men, murder whatever's going on here, it's bigger than fashion. Okay, see if you can get a serial number.
let's figure out who bought that bug. Yeah.
all right. Thank you very much.
that was the event planner at the cordova house.
they said they still have a few spots open in the fall.
she can give us a tour tonight. Whoo-hoo! Let's do it.
so, where are we on watergate? So, the plot thickens.
the building manager at Ella's apartment Remembers letting an exterminator into her place.
usually, exterminators get rid of bugs.
only this one didn't. The company that he worked for doesn't exist.
I mean, what is this about, Castle? Why would someone target Ella?
well, you already heard and rejected my theory.
Yeah, but your theory doesn't explain the little detail That Lanie just found out.
there's black coral on the sole of Ella's shoe, And it wasn't from the dumpster.
well, that doesn't make any sense. Black coral is found in the tropics.
exactly. So how did this end up on her shoe?
yo, Beckett.
and Castle. Sure.
but we got a hit off the canvass of the crime scene.
a seamstress coming off the late shift Right near the alley where Ella was killed.
we get a description? Yeah, and he matches our sketch.
Yes. That's him.
outside the broadway coffee shop when I walked by.
and what time was this?
just after?
do you recall how tall he was, what he wore?
fabric is my business.
he wore a dark suit - nice quality, wool blend.
Oh, and he had a distinctive striped tie, crimson and navy with gold triangles across the stripes.
that sounds like a club tie.
crimson and navy - yes, I know that one. Gold triangles. That's the carlton club tie.
if we can match that sketch to one of its members, we got our I. D.
yeah except are notoriously protective of keeping their members' privacy.
they're not just gonna hand over that information.
the club won't, no, but one of its members might.
after a tough negotiation that involved my knicks tickets and naming a character in my next book after his nana, my friend came up with a name - Marcus Conway.
okay, so, what do we know about him? He is a lawyer at kellerman goodfriend.
that's one of the city's biggest law firms.
why is a high-powered lawyer going after Ella? Maybe it has to do with her work.
is general counsel for couture chick magazine.
that's "chic," and not that you would know, but they are Modern Fashion's biggest competitor.
call Conway's firm. I want to know where he is.
detective, I would think very carefully Before making these kinds of accusations.
Mr. Conway, I am not making any accusations. I am simply stating fact.
we have a witness that heard you threatening Ella Hayes and another one that saw you near where she was killed.
right about the same time she ended up that way.
you need to explain yourself. Gloria: Marcus, I heard the police are here.
what's going on? Who are you?
G. RI'm editor-in-chief of couture chic.
they think I murdered Ella Hayes. What? That's ridiculous.
so you?
this is obviously one huge misunderstanding. Then clear it up.
tell me what you know about Ella Hayes.
we approached Ella and attempted to engage her services.
so, basically, you tried to hire her To get inside information on Modern Fashion.
I wouldn't put it that way. Well, I'm pretty sure she would, which is why she turned you down.
and you wouldn't take no for an answer.
look, this is a competitive business With everyone looking to get an edge.
Yes, I was aggressive in trying to make a deal, but when she refused I accepted that, and I never contacted her again.
then why were you less than a block away from where she was killed at about the time she died?
because she called me. She asked me to meet her last night.
why would she do that? Probably because Matilda just fired her.
the bottom line is, she said she had Bombshell information on Modern Fashion information that, if it got out, it would destroy the magazine.
Mr. Conway, I took a look at Ella's cellphone records.
she never called you last night.
she did call, and I can prove it. She left me a message.
hey it's Ella. I changed my mind about your offer.
I find out something that'll ruin Modern Fashion, take down the whole operation. Meet me at the broadway coffee shop in an hour.
I waited around for two hours, but she never showed.
what information did she want to share?
what were you trying to hire her to find out?
as you may have heard, A tech-venture capitalist named Glen Carter bought Modern Fashion last month.
Glen has big plans to drag Matilda's precious little magazine?
which are? Well, that's what we wanted to know, since our website has failed to generate New subscription business.
if we could get Modern Fashion's new playbook, it could help us strategize and stay one step ahead.
so, you wanted to hire Ella So that she could tell you about the new direction the magazine was taking, and when she turned you down, that was the extent of your contact?
until she called last night. And what about the eavesdropping?
w- what are you talking about?
we found a listening device in Ella's apartment.
that wasn't us. We had nothing to do with that.
so, these records explain why we missed Ella's phone calls to Marcus Conway. She phoned him using her roommate's landline.
so, she told Conway to meet her in the coffee shop in an hour.
it would take her about 20 minutes to get there from her apartment, so she must have been killed on the way there.
looking at her designs, Ella actually had talent.
Yeah, well, the question is, what did she know, and did someone kill her to keep her quiet?
RYAN: Well, I can't help you out there, But I can tell you that Marcus Conway was telling the truth about not planting that bug.
Yeah, the serial number led us to a distributor Named alternate intelligence in queens.
do they?
James Kavanaugh paid for that listening device with a credit card a month ago.
and when does it get interesting?
when we found out he was former special forces and, not to mention, the head of security at Modern Fashion.
wait a minute - Ella was being spied on by her own magazine?
Oh, Beckett, we have that appointment at the cordova house.
Oh, Castle, I'm sorry. Duty calls. Can - can you go without me
and see if it's as good as the pictures?
you trust me to make this decision on my own? Can you go with martha?
we have to bring james kavanaugh in. Yeah.
I'm in the security business. I buy lots of equipment.
Yeah, well, this equipment was a listening device that you installed in Ella Hayes' apartment.
if you think that, you're mistaken.
Really?
because we showed your picture to the super at Ella's building, and he identified you as the exterminator he let into her apartment.
I had nothing to do with what happened to Ella Hayes.
you broke into her place, you wired it for sound, And now she's dead?
James? Think about how that looks, bro.
your best bet is to tell us exactly what you know.
all I did was bug her place, okay?
I mean, once Glen Carter bought the magazine, home monitoring got to be a common practice.
so, Glen Carter ordered the surveillance? No.
no, he didn't know anything about it.
it was ordered by Matilda King.
you sure about that? Yes, I'm sure.
she got all freaked out about someone coming after her job, so she said she didn't know who she could trust anymore.
okay, so, who monitored the audio from Ella's apartment?
Matilda had me set it up So that it fed directly to her computer.
you realize what this means?
Yeah.
Ella called Marcus Conway on the landline, told him she could take down the magazine, and Matilda heard the whole thing.
okay. Thank you very much.
so, the guard in the lobby of the Modern Fashion building saw Matilda leave there last night at 11: 30, and she was in a big hurry.
well, that's right after Ella called Marcus Conway.
Matilda knew that Ella was about to spill the beans And bring down the magazine.
so Matilda went to stop her.
she's our killer.
wait, wait, wait. She's on a call. She can call back.
Matilda: Glen, this magazine is not about tweets or likes on facebook,
for god's sake!
for 57 years, women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!
whenever they've had a bad day at work or at home, they've come to us!
we are their escape! We are their fantasy!
it's the clothing that stitches it all together.
that's what matters.
we're done here. glen!
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
you've got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.
it's not temper. It's frustration.
Glen Carter, our new owner, cares more about money than fashion.
is that why you were paranoid he was gonna replace you?
I don't know what you've heard, but I'm Matilda King.
my name is synonymous with this magazine.
he wouldn't dare replace me.
so then why did you order the monitoring of all of your employees' conversations the moment that he bought the magazine?
you are quite the detective.
take a seat.
since the purchase, rumors have been swirling.
I'd like to think that they're just rumors, but I can't afford to take that chance.
I need to know my people are loyal.
by bugging their homes?
with their permission.
we've had some loyalty issues, so my lawyers added some fine print to their employment agreements.
do you actually believe that's gonna fly in court?
my lawyers seem to think so.
now, what does this have to do with your investigation?
look, given the rumors about your job, It must have been disconcerting to find out Ella was taking damaging information on Modern Fashion.
to what are you referring? What information?
but what we do know is moments after she made the arrangements to sell that information, you were seen running out of here.
you think that I ran out of here to kill Ella?
your head of security says that you're set up to listen to these recordings live on your computer.
something I do on the weekend.
I'm a little busy running a magazine during the week.
Yeah, a position that you're desperate to defend. That's motive and that's opportunity.
I ran out of my office last night because I was late for drinks with Oscarde Larenta.
feel free to check.
regarding Ella's threat to the magazine, I never heard her say that.
and you have no idea what Ella was taking to the competition?
none.
but if you find out, I'd be curious to know.
anything else, detective?
I'm gonna need those recordings.
Hey, Beckett. Matilda's alibi checks out.
she was having drinks with Oscar until about 2: 00 a. m.
so Matilda's not our killer?
and we still don't know what explosive information, Ella was taking to the competition. Right.
I think I may have found something on these audio files that might shed light on that.
about a week of inane conversations?
but she did place a call on the day of the murder that was pretty strange. Check it out.
Hey. It's me - Ella.
something weird is going on inside Modern Fashion.
I think someone's targeting me. I need your help. Call me back.
do we know who's on the other end of that call?
based on the landline phone records, The call was placed to someone at Modern Fashion, but it was routed through a switchboard, so it doesn't show who she was connected to.
this directory lists over 100 people that work there.
Yeah.
lucky I have crazy-good hearing. Listen to the beginning again.
I had a tech analyze those beeps and connect them to the corresponding digits.
the call was placed to this extension.
he's an I. T. tech at Modern Fashion? Mm-hmm.
what was Ella doing calling him for help?
we were friends, you know?
to most of the people here, I'm invisible, but Ella saw me.
she was nice.
why did she need your help the day she died?
she wanted me to look at Matilda's calendar.
what for? Because Matilda missed some important meetings, but Ella was sure she entered them Into the calendar correctly.
she wanted to know if the calendar had been tampered with. And - and was it?
several entries had been changed over the past couple weeks all in the middle of the night.
when I showed it to her, she was convinced that someone was trying to set her up.
well, were you able to tell who made those changes?
I tracked them all to an I. P. address outside Modern Fashion.
it's the best I could do.
and she said she was gonna figure out who set her up and make them pay.
next I hear, she's dead.
do you still have that I. P. address?
Yeah. Okay. I'll have a tech run it down.
but why would anyone want to sabotage a fashion assistant? I don't know, Espo.
if Ella went after whoever's behind this, all right, well, I'll give you a call when I get a location.
okay. Thanks.
more questions, detective?
actually, we found evidence that suggests Ella wasn't responsible for screwing up your appointments.
someone else changed your calendar - Someone outside of this office.
are you saying that I fired Ella for no reason?
do you know why someone would have done this to her?
no.
but I do know why someone would want to do this to me. What do you mean?
ever since Glen Carter bought Modern Fashion, the sharks have been circling. They smell blood.
so the calendar mistakes made you look bad at a critical time?
excuse me.
Oh, this is just what I need. What's wrong?
I have to make a decision in the next half-hour
about a dress this issue, and the model didn't show up. Oh.
detective Beckett.
you said "no" to me years ago when I offered you a job.
might you do a little favor for me now?
Oh, richard, look at these beautiful antique chandeliers.
so, if you're interested, I have a couple of slots for fall 2015 still open.
excuse me. Did you say "fall 2015"?
that's correct. When we spoke on the phone, I thought...we were speaking of...this fall.
no way. That's been booked for months.
uh, excuse me, but I have to take this call.
look around, and I'll be right back.
Ugh. Well, it is a beautiful venue.
and it's a long time to wait.
Yeah, and a long time to plan.
I just feel like I've waited long enough, mother.
I- I don't want to waste any more time Before we take the next step.
and???
I'm sure there's another venue out there that the two of you will just fall in love with.
thank you.
okay.
this never happens, but the friedmans just called off their wedding, and we now have an opening for spring.
Spring...2016?
no, this spring.
uh, I have a long list of couples that would snatch this up immediately, but since you're here...
do you need any help in there?
when you asked me to try on a dress and I said yes, I had no idea it was gonna be this kind of a dress.
what do you think?
it's amazing. Yeah?
the embroidery.
and the austrian crystal.
it's just - just heavenly.
Yeah. It is, isn't it?
come.
well, this probably would have looked better on the model that didn't show up.
no, don't be silly. It's perfect on you.
trust me. I'm an expert.
in facr, this is exactly the kind of dress I would want for her.
you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday.
thank you.
we're ready for the accessories spread in the conference room.
excuse me. I'll be back in five minutes.
Hey. How's the venue.
amazing. Yeah, so amazing.
and they didn't have any spots open until fall of 2015?
and their unfortunate misery can be our lifelong joy.
we can take their spot for the spring.
the spring. Wow.
I know. And there's a lot of couples who want it.
but if I put down a deposit tonight, it's ours.
so, what do you say?
Beckett, are you there?
Yeah.
okay, but I-I thought we agreed that the venue was amazing.
Yeah, we did. It's just I started thinking about the details and the planning that we have to do, and I just - I don't want to rush any of this.
okay. If you're sure that's it.
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I
I mean, we're gonna find another venue, Castle?
look?
so, a tech was able to track down that I. P. address.
whoever changed that calendar did it from a design studio in Soho.
is there any connection between the studio and Modern Fashion? As a matter of fact, there is.
it belongs to one of the designers being featured in Modern Fashion's "fab five" spread - Yumi.
Yumi what?
I guess if you don't have a last name, you can charge more.
so, why would he or someone from his studio be changing Matilda's calendar? I don't know, but I can tell you this.
it looks like Ella may have been there the night she was killed.
how do you know that? Yumi's website.
the current design line being produced at his studio features dresses embellished with coral, and, in addition to the fact that this model is hot, she's wearing black coral.
the same kind of coral that Lanie found stuck to the bottom of Ella's shoe. Let's go.
I'm probably gonna have to call her in for an interrogation.
Yumi: No, sweetie.
you tell little miss all that Yumi says there's only one diva in this room.
if she doesn't want to wear the pink louboutins, she is out of the show.
models.
the lack of food makes them so very fraught.
uh, Mr. Yumi - please, just Yumi.
okay. Yumi.
when was the last time you saw Ella Hayes? Ella Hayes?
Matilda's assistant - the girl who was killed?
Yes, of course. Well, we have reason to believe that she was here last night.
Yes. She was.
why was she here?
she, uh, she came to ask me for a job. Really?
I told her I wanted to help, But there was absolutely nothing I could do.
when Matilda King fires someone, they are radioactive.
do you have any idea why she was fired? No.
I think you do.
someone changed Matilda King's calendar.
Matilda thought it was Ella, but it wasn't Ella. It was someone from your studio.
we traced the I. P. address. So did Ella.
that's what she was doing here last night.
she wasn't asking for a job.
she was looking to find who made those changes, who ruined her career. And given the fact that you just lied to us, I am guessing it was you.
me?
do you have any idea how powerful Matilda King is in the fashion industry? My design is a "fab five" winner.
Matilda's about to make me famous.
messing with her would be career suicide.
what could possibly be my motive?
Oh, it's simple. You needed to get her fired.
you needed to discredit her.
why on earth would I do that?
because your winning "fab five" design isn't yours.
from Ella's sketchbook. They're exactly the same.
Ella was an aspiring designer. She must have copied me.
no. Ella's roommate Saw her making those sketches months ago.
okay, then.
if you found it in her sketchbook, then how did I get it?
well, Matilda's other assistant, Grace, confirmed seeing Ella give you copies of her sketches.
apparently, you had them on you When you went in on your "fab five" pitch meeting.
and from there, the story writes itself.
you showed your designs, And they just weren't good enough to make the cut, but then the artistic director sees these in your bag, the fresh, stunning, raw talent - perfect for the "fab five."
except they weren't your designs.
only two people knew that - you and Ella.
and being a "fab five" designer could literally make your career, once you were chosen for the "fab five," you realized that Ella would know you had stolen her designs.
you had to discredit her so that no one would believe her.
I want a lawyer.
Ella must have confronted Yumi at his studio.
if she threatened to expose the whole scandal, his career would be over.
he had to kill her to hide the truth. Yeah. That all makes sense.
now we just have to connect him to the crime scene.
only one problem - you can't.
Yumi didn't kill Ella. How do you know?
multiple employees saw Ella confront Yumi, but after she took off, he was at the studio till 3: 00 a.m.
wait. Are you - are you sure? His alibi?
but we know someone changed Matilda's calendar from that studio. He has to be involved somehow.
I think someone else was, too.
I went through Yumi's phone records, And after Ella left, he made half a dozen phone calls to Modern Fashion.
such beautiful designs.
after all this time, I had no idea.
if she knew these designs had been stolen, maybe she didn't think you would listen.
at least, not to someone like her. Maybe she just wanted revenge.
if couture chi exposed that our "fab five" list was corrupt, it would have cost me my job. Who else stood to lose?
everyone involved, I suppose.
well, just after Ella left Yumi's studio, he made a series of phone calls To someone here at Modern Fashion.
someone who must have known Yumi's secret who was helping him cover it up. Someone who knew that if the truth got out, it could destroy them both.
there's only one person it could be.
who?
we go to print in one week on this issue, and I'm still not happy with the cover options.
and we're still not there with the "fab five" spread!
now, go, please, make it better!
Julian, a word.
what was your first reaction When you saw Yumi's design submission?
blown away. I mean, that's why I nominated him.
now, is there a reason why you didn't come to me and tell me when he confessed to you that he stole Ella's design?
what do you mean? I had a word with Yumi this morning.
he told me you've known for a while.
and he also said it was your idea to change my calendar.
he's lying.
then I spoke to Mr. Carter, and he confirmed my suspicion.
you've been gunning for my job.
it proves that you tried to kill two birds with one stone.
you changed my calendar in order to discredit Ella.
you don't know what you're talking about. Don't even.
you're fired.
I can walk out of here and get hired at any magazine I want by the end of the day.
you won't be applying for a new job anytime soon, Julian.
Oh, my...
this is ridiculous Matilda King, she takes pleasure in torturing people like this.
fact is, her story is as crazy as she is.
except we searched the dumpsters around your apartment, and we found Ella's scarf the one that you used to strangle her.
the lab also found two sets of DNA on that scarf, Ella's and yours.
I'm not gonna say another word until my lawyer's present.
RYAN: So, what did the D. A. Say?
that Julian's gonna plead not guilty, take his chances at a trial.
the good news is Yumi cut a deal to avoid charges.
I guess murder is not his type of accessory.
Yeah. He confessed to telling Julian.
and Julian told him that he would take care of her.
so, I guess the "fab five" is gonna be the "fab four" this year.
I always thought the fashion industry seemed glamorous.
turns out, mobsters are more ethical.
Oh, my gosh. Why do you think I quit?
I'll take murderers over models any day.
if only murderers were this hot.
I got a bit of paperwork to do.
Ah! Boring paperwork.
that is my cue to leave.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you when I'm done.
Hey. Shall I pour you a glass?
uh, no. Not right now.
everything all right?
babe, we have to talk.
Wow. That's something people say before they deliver bad news.
...you know when you called last night about the venue?
I was with Matilda, and she wanted me to model a dress.
and it was a wedding dress.
and when I saw myself in it, I just - I started to think about my mom.
she would have loved to have been a part of all of this to help pick out the flowers and try on the dresses and when I looked at myself in the mirror, I just I- I halfway expected to see her right behind me... - and she wasn't there!
and, just for a moment, I thought to myself, "I don't know if I can do all of this without her."
and that's why I said no when you asked about the venue.
I'm so sorry. It was so stupid.
no.
no, not stupid.
human.
do you know what else I wish she could experience?
you.
Really? Yeah.
she would have loved you.
you know, Kate... If you need more time
no. No, I don't - I don't need any more time.
I don't even want us to wait until the fall.
I think we can find a new venue in the spring.
you think we can pull it off? Yeah.
I mean, I already have the dress.
welcome.
have a great time shopping.
okay.
let's meet up later then. Alright. Okay.
why are you so restless?
do you have to make me look for you all over?
why aren't you answering me? Are you deaf?
I'm sorry, lady
what did you call me? Lady?
you just don't listen. Come here.
I told you to come here
come here.
come here now.
say it to me once more. What did you call me?
answer me!
are you making fun of me? Making fun of an adult?
Oh, you're hurting me! I'm sorry
mom~ mom~
will you do this again? Or won't you?
I won't do it again
go and wash your face. Stop crying by the time I count to 3
Oh, hi honey. I'm at the department store
I have nothing much to do without you!
you know I relieve stress through shopping.
so you're coming home tomorrow morning?
what do you want for breakfast? Did you buy me a present?
a handbag?
get a grip.
how else do you think I survive raising someone else's kid?
you're always saying that money is everything to me
once poverty comes through the door, love is gone out the window
don't forget what I'm telling you now. Bye...
Oh!
what's he doing?
can you turn off the siren? - What?
turn off the siren, please. - What?
turn off the siren. - Oh, we're actually...
I'm sorry. - Sorry for what?
turn it off - You're always doing what you're told - Welcome!
please turn on your lights - We're the police. - Yes?
we're here to investigate the crime scene. - Yes, so what?
have a great time shopping!
screw the shopping
do they expect police to pay for parking?
don't get angry. Here, we need validation
Oh, geez
look inside
keep up the good work
Oh, shit!
I pray to you Lord, to help guide those poor in need - Amen! - Amen
I think the body was stabbed dozens of times
with a sharp object like a spear
it doesn't seem like an accident. More like revenge - Where can you buy kitchenware? - Kitchenware?
a fork has three spears, right?
you've been peeking during your prayer
such a sensual body and smooth skin
this is the best car for those with a pride to match
a beautiful and sexy wife who listens to you
wouldn't that be fantastic?
I prefer a lover than a wife
she can be both a wife and a lover
she'd be attracting attention.
but you'll be the only one she wants
scientific and initial investigation are key to every case.
you need to explore all the options you have
explore all the options!
you must use your head! - Use your head
are you laughing? How can you laugh at a time like this?
anyway, try to organize the facts in a scientific way!
Yes, Sir. We don't have the murder weapon yet
there's a high chance that a kitchen utensil was used
so I've requested the forensic lab to investigate them
we're looking the crime as both incidental or calculated revenge
keeping both options open, we're investigating possible suspects around the victim.
what else?
we've come to a conclusion that. the murderer is female - A woman! - Yes
how did you find that out?
that's great work. Well done!
in any case, you are fools if you can't figure this one out.
I'm sure the criminal's face was caught on the security cameras
narrow them down, one by one.
get to it! Move it! Come on!
what are you doing, pastor? Praying again?
ms. JUNG Soon-jung, did you pack your own lunch again?
Yes.
Oh, Ms. JUNG
I heard you've got your license for heavy machinery
guess you'll be selling trucks too?
my dream is to drive a crane - You get better commission. - That's scary.
you look great today. - Thanks.
cameras for each shop. 40 shops in all.
one in each aisle & corner
shit, I'll never go through this all
did they teach you how to curse at the Police Academy?
well, Detective Oh,
why do you want to be a pastor?
what does a pastor do? They guide sinners
policemen do the same thing.
we catch the sinners - and put them in jail. - Let's take a look.
gotcha
that's her, isn't it?
but who's gonna talk to her?
what's that?
it's a magic wand
she's learning magic these days
wow, the wand looks great.
did your mom buy it for you?
did your dad buy it?
on the day of the murder,
when you were at the department store with your mother in the bathroom...
she's not my mother.
Oh, okay
did she fight with anyone?
did you see the face?
I want to put that bad guy in jail
that lady is not a bad person!
what lady?
the lady. You don't know a thing!
how's my hair? - The color came out great.
it looks great
I'm leaving now
come this way
you've ordered dinner, remember?
that was ages ago.
I'm not waiting for that
delivery is here.
Hey, I almost collapsed waiting for you
we had back to back deliveries
well, too bad.
I'm no longer hungry. Take it back
okay?
ordering food and sending it back again.
talk about being rude
what did you just say?
I didn't say anything. - Yes, you said something.
you're calling me rude?
how dare you call me that?
did you really say that? - No. I didn't say that
be careful from now on. Hurry on out
where are you going?
apologize before you leave
hurry and apologize
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry
don't order from that place from now on. Got it?
you had me waiting a long time
is that all you have to say to me?
your hair! It looks nice
I'm going now.
Mr. Na, please come to our shop
I'm going now
she sure works hard to sell cars
is she still single?
why do you ask? If you ever get caught!
aren't you going home?
Hmm... - Anything interesting?
nothing. My eyes are killing me
sir,
Iet's have some ribs with soju
forget it, you devil
how can you want to eat meat when we have a murder case?
you need to eat to work hard - I'll see you there. - Okay, alright. Let's eat.
start singing!
I know how dad feels now
when he said that life is lonely
I heard his sad voice as he whispered in my sleep
I know how dad feels now
when he said that life is lonely
the song he used to sing as he looked into the sky
not yet, Min-ah.
I didn 't light the candles. Wait
Hey, wait
what's in the sampler?
it's a moisturizer
how does it work?
it calms your skin
you'll be getting a facial later.
it'll help brighten your face
I really like the service here
we'll be giving you a free hand massage today
put your hands together
didn't you hear something?
hear what?
what is it?
something's wrong
you put on your gown already. Did you go to the bathroom?
hold on
Hey, what's wrong with you?
I didn't do it
Oh, no. It's not me. I didn't do it
I'm positive that I made holes so that she could breathe
or else, she'd suffocate. And we never plaster hands
that's right. Why would we do her hands?
then, why did you leave her alone?
I was having a bite to eat - How long? - About 15 minutes
did you have any other customers?
I had a customer. But, she was new
do you remember her face?
well, I think I'd recognize her if I ever saw her again
Hey, hey. Take them in, they can be charged for negligence
why are you doing this? I did nothing wrong
move out of the way.
come this way. Move out
come this way. This way
this is the victim's cell phone
go on, take the call
did you have a nice facial? Are you loosened up?
why didn't you answer your phone?
how do you know Ms. Choi Shin-ok?
Hello? Who is this? Why you answering this phone?
I'm Detective JUNG of homicide
ms. CHOl Shin-ok died this afternoon
what?
Hello? Hello?
shit, he hung up
na Jae-keun
do you know this NA Jae-keun?
I don't know anything
he's Shin-ok's boyfriend
boyfriend?
you're saying he's her boyfriend, right?
I really don't know anything
this shop actually belongs to Mr. NA
he's the owner of
Chukbok Wedding Hall
wedding hall?
I really don't know anything else. - Hey, let's go.
I'm just a part-timer - Okay. Thank you.
so the dead woman and my husband knew each other?
Yes.
so what?
excuse me?
you're still single, right?
yes
you'll find out when you get married, but being married is like that. It's not perfect
well, you know, lady...
can you recall where you were last
friday between 1 1 to 12: 30 am?
I was here in my office
what are you doing here instead of going after the criminals?
this is an invasion of privacy
please don't misunderstand.
this is all part of the investigation
you can call it what you want
I even played golf with your Commissioner last weekend
you shouldn't hassle me like this
okay
you can leave now
I'll buy you dinner some time
I know you're working hard on this case
much of the plaster ended up in her airway and gullet
so the death was instant
and there was much struggle, as there are evident marks on her neck, shoulders, and stomach
and there are fingernail marks...
fingernail marks!
that proves that the killer is female
the last murder was committed by a woman. And so was this one!
don't you feel the connection?
what connection?
Oh, you're too dull
anyway, what did you want us to see?
it's Princess Aurora
how's the ride?
it feels good
I want to drive on forever...
until we reach the Pacific Ocean
the Pacific Ocean?
I can't go that far
I really hate it here. I really hate it
this place makes me sad. It makes me unhappy
I want to get away from this place
but, surely you must overcome that
you're right. I need to do that
I wish I could go somewhere and get drunk tonight
are you okay?
we're at my palace right now
the palace of blessing and happiness
we can understand each other because we're alike
we share the same sorrow and unhappiness
our unhappy marriage and sad lives
but we'll be happy one day. Right?
get with it. You're ruining the mood
you're right. I should't do that - What's this? - lt'll help you sober up.
?How do you feel? Are you better now?
I know how dad feels now
when he said that life is lonely
I heard his sad voice as he whispered in my sleep
did you say that we share the same feelings?
we're totally different, you son of a bitch
listen to this before you die
isn't her voice pretty?
this was my happiness
on the murder scene of both CHOl Shin-ok and NA Jae-keun, the same sticker was found on the bodies
the killer is exposing her identity
it was hard to link these murders to the department store killing
but there was something that we had overlooked
look here
I was oblivious of this fact during the initial investigation
I've come to the conclusion that all 3 cases are the acts of a single killer. They all involve a child
that's all
what's the link between the department store victim and these ones?
for instance, did the two women know each other?
we cannot find the link as of yet
well, let's organize a special team to focus on this case
and please take extra precaution when you talk to the press
yes Sir
I'm on my way back.
did the test driver return yet?
are you still studying to become a pastor?
yeah
but I haven't gotten that far because I've been busy
it's funny that you're trying to help other people when you have troubles of your own when you couldn't even take care of your own family
don't you think so?
you must pray a lot
do you pray for Min-ah and me from time to time?
often
when you become a pastor, will you be able to save Min-ah's soul?
why did you come here? To pray for me?
we look like we're committing adultery
people used to think I was your mistress because of our age difference
you should go now
don't you need a ride?
I'll take a cab
fine, then
Ah, wait
have you been to a department store lately?
well? Did someone see me there?
no, never mind - What? You're making me feel bad.
at times,
I'm scared of you
detective, don't get me wrong.
I've stopped doing this long time ago
Thanks. Here you go - No way, I can't take this. - Come on!
okay

you little weasel.
l was on my way to you but then Hyun-ji called.
Why?
when l got back home.
she was burning up.
can you imagine how scared she was?
no one's home.
l'm on a stake- out...
l thought this isn't right!
why didn't you just say so?
well, l knew you were...
ls she OK?
she had acute enteritis but she's okay now.
then it's okay. You had lunch?
let's go.
Hey, Cha.
why did you pick the violent crime unit?
customs is much better. You make some extra money...
l wanted to find my identity as a police officer.
can l ask you a question?
as long as it's an easy one.
why do you carry your gun there?
cool, isn't it? This defines identity.
your gun's not a beeper, you know.
don't be nervous. lt's a piece of cake.
you walk up to him, right?
then show him your badge and say
we'll let you go right away. So, let's go.
then you bring him here and l'll...
Hey, Baby.
doing stuff on your own helps you find your identity.
huh?
how could you lose him?
he suddenly pushed me.
you had him, and you lose him.
you said he'd come quietly.
just sound the siren!
that's dangerous.
l was careless.
man, he's so fast. We won't get him today.
what the...
what are you doing?
what?
you'll lose him. Come on!
lt's a red light!
that's not the point. Get in!
you're so touchy. We won't get him today.
lf you hadn't stalled back there, we could've gotten him.
just step on it!
he's no dumbass. He's already split.
wait, stop, stop! Back! Back! Baby!
hurry up! Damn it...
right there!
we should do this calmly...
not rush in.
he just had to take off uphill.

you...
you're dead.
come on. OK? Hold on.
don't you give up, Cha.
someone just kill me now.
go on, run.
l'm getting old.
just 'cause l overdid it yesterday.

what happened?
l hit my head against the wall, right?
that baby bastard!
we had him, then he pushed me...
you okay? - Of course not.

He'a a patient, you know. - He's a regular con artist.

you try anything and l'll kill you.
lsn't it weird?
he had a gun and got caught.
and he told me to drop my gun.
he wanted to let him go.

prada's no big deal.

everyone asked why we had a fight.
but you won.
lt's not here.
Dae-ro said he'd do it so l gave it to him.
where is it?
he seems to be from a good family.
you should have watched him.
sorry.
my job keeps me running and l sweat a lot.
lt's a sensitive issue so l got a lot of heat.
our boss asked me to thank you.
l only came here 'cause he's like my younger brother.

this is good.
l'll take that.
good.
hush!
you must be hungry.
l got your favorites.

you said you'd come.
that's right, but l was so busy.
l bought you a piano.
that's not a piano!
Yes, it is. Try it.
Jung- Ae says this is the latest.
why do you always listen to her?
l hate Jung- Ae!
l haven't finished talking...
open this door. - No. l hate you.
let's work this out. l'm going to get mad.
don't know.
Yeah, Jong-tae.
l'm in the hospital, of course.
hospital?
just bring him in first.
l can't do that. That would look bad.
ltem 2: After buying panties, he took her to a crab place.
Hey, Cha. - You stay outside.
the department's under investigation.
return the money and bring Jee Young- jun back in.
well, bro!
but l got 30 grand. l can't put him in jail.
30 thousand dollars?
you worthless piece of shit.
what am l going to do now?
what am l going to do with you?
you bastard... To think l trusted you.
even when everyone turned on you.
Hyun-ji has Liver Cirrhosis.
evidence ltem 2 is pretty strong.
what kind of father are you?
we'll get the money somehow.
Thanks.
then what about Jee Young- jun?
give the money back and bring him in!
l should, right?
Dae-ro! - Shit...
l already spent 3 hundred.
lee Dae-ro!
the doctor wants to see you.
you must be mistaken.
l have anemia and get dizzy, but my arms and legs are fine.
lt's not anemia. lt's a tumor.
Kang put you up to this, right?
stop kidding me.
l'm not. lt's malignant.
l don't understand.
so something's wrong with my head?
lt has already infiltrated your brain wall.
you should have come earlier.
you have maybe 3 or 4 months.
you could faint today and never wake up again.
why me?
what about all the murderes, thieves, rapists, and other shit?
why do l have to die?
doesn't make any difference if l die now or 3 months later.
l'll just die now!
lt's cold! lt's cold!
over here! Help!
Jung-ae.
we got married.
when?
let's say we did...
and l died from a car accident.
or got stabbed or something...
what would you do?

l know you.
you'd raise Hyun-ji like your own because you love me.
Thanks.
so l'm telling you...
l have brain...
switch it to vibration mode. - Hello.
l'm sorry. l'll be right there.
Really? Now?
OK. l have to go.

lf you and l got hitched...
honey. - Yeah.
l wouldn't marry you.

'your ChiId's happiness depend on you. "
l'm thinking of getting insurance.
for your family and future.
lnsurance! - You need insurance.
police?
up to 1 million dollars.
1 million? - 1 million?
1 million? - Other illness...
a diagnosis within 3 months...
...means it's invalid.
especially cancer...
l'm not dying of cancer for sure.
make it 3 shifts for the One Blade stakeout.
daytime too.
where the hell is Dae-ro?
ls he still in the hospital?
captain!
l think...
we have an info leak.
the Parma Hotel, the One Blade nightclub...
they were always one step ahead of us.
and when l went after Baby...
there's a spy in our department.
that's what l think.
Hey, Cha. - Sir?
l told you to stop watching videos. - Yes.
just go on a steakout .
you can't find your identity looking...
you bastard! - l got it!
compose yourself.
l really didn't kill him.
then was it Baby?
Hyun-ji, how do you know Baby?
l'm not Hyun-ji.
that's right.
detective Lee, undo these, please. l really didn't kill him.
did you go to the hospital a few days ago?
Yeah, to see Daddy.
no, no, no...
no, because you were sick.
did you take pictures and see the doctor?
no?
lt's Daddy!
lt's nice.
l didn't know Seoul was this beautiful.
or that life is so meaningless.
what are you going to do?
lf you had 3 months to live?
what would you do?
l... l... have a brain tumor.
l only have 3 months.
what am l going to do?
cut the crap.
a few days ago Hyun-ji was sick and now you have cancer?
this is real.
l'll make it real short.
quit now or come back. lt's up to you.
that kind of decision is...
who said anything about quitting?
wait up!
Kang Jong-tae.
dude!
you bastard.
what a temper. Let's go to the sauna.
sorry to bother you, sir. l came to return this.
there's about 3 to 5 grand missing.
no need to look. l counted it.
l get a bonus this month. l'll give you the rest then.
we should do lunch sometime.
good day now.

Jee Young-jun.
some of us can't go home because we're on a stakeout and someone comes out whenever.
fuck it, l should quit or something.
detective Park.
l just have to say this.
don't. - OK.
l'll take any punishment. Just please let me keep my job.
abuse of authority, forgery...
your job? What a joke.
you should be arrested. - Sir?
the prosecutor told me to do an internal investigation.
so should l arrest you?
lieutenant.
this is where l want to be.
this means l'll be suspended, too?
go on. - Lieutenant.
even if you killed someone, l refuse to screw you over.
just don't forget today.
we're in the same boat now.
l won't.
thank you. Thank you. Sir! Thank you.
l know you. You're just like me.
huh?
you're just like me.
sure. You're a detective and so am l.
l...
the plaintiff, l mean...
how badly is Dong-min hurt?
pardon?
l'm sorry.
she's never fought before.
lt's all my fault, ma'am.
Hyun-ji was reading from her diary when Dong-min called her a liar.
a liar? Who is?
the police stories.
Hyun-ji writes a lot about you.
but you told her such tall tales...
l'm sorry.
ma'am?
Hyun-ji's a wonderful girl. She's so... strong.
she is a little aggressive, but she's strong.
Yes.
she cleans well, - she runs well, and... - She plays the piano well.
what?
she said you praised her a lot.
Oh, yes.
she studies by herself at home but she learns fast.
ls that so?
Oh? So someone in the family must have studied music.
huh?
her mom loves music...
no wonder.
so she's in the U. S. on tour?
Hyun-ji said she was in the states.
l don't fucking believe this. - lt's yours.
everyone knows you're the town slut.
you show up after a year and say the kid's mine?
she's ours.
that's your mom.
kim Young-sook.
Hyun-ji.
after you meet your mom...
lf anyone says later that...
you're not my daughter...
don't you believe them.
why would they say that?
because they're bad people.
some people say things that aren't true.
so don't believe them. OK?
l can show them my mole.
that's right!
who's your dad?
you are!
this is real good stuff.
Jason does things well, doesn't he?
when l see him at work, l think he know his shit.
you did well, too.
after you get this job done, take a trip abroad.
the cops are out to get you.
you should watch out, too.
me?
don't you worry about me.
all the cops in town put together couldn't catch me.
how did you get away from Parma Hotel?
there were pigs at every exit.
that's my secret.
get in here quickly. Are you ready?
Yes!
just get One Blade, all right?
one Blade and evidence are the most important. OK?
park, go to the third floor. Kang!
Yeah!
you go in first.
okay.
do me a favor.
lf anything happens to me, find Hyun-ji's mom for me.
there's an envelope in my drawer.
you took another bribe?
look, l'm serious.
move in!
this is Oh Tae-ju.
lt's the cops!
this way.
listen to your teacher and don't hit your friends. OK?
you got that?
and listen to Uncle Jong-tae.
who are you?
where the hell is he?
don't come closer if you want to live.
and if l don't? - What?
you're good with your knife, right?
one shot, one kill. One blade, one man.
l don't know how well you throw but how well do you write?
who fucker trashed my writing!
should be someone close.
you know how to read? - l'm gonna try.
your life is up to you.
just kill me right. Right here.
right there? Just don't move.
that stings.
and you call yourself a killer?
Hey! Throw it again!
he's nowhere around.
l got hit by your knife here.
l staggered... And then l fell.
l can't find him.
what do you mean he's not here?
little sneaky bastard!
have you seen someone with a scar on his head?
lt's 1 million dollars.
get ready and pack it up.
watch out!
lee Dae-ro!
what!
what made you jump from there?
you tripped?
you'd have to kill me to make me jump.
you would if someone threatened to.
finding Hyun-ji's mom is a good idea.
she only has you.
you got no relatives.
she's her mother after all.
let's go with your uncle.
let's go, Hyun-ji.
Hey.
Thanks.
she might have seen you on TV.

Young-sook!

Yes.
kim Young-sook.
look at you.
what, you're a blonde now?
get it off.
how'd you find me?
where else would you be?
what about you? You're just a cop.
Hey, Kim Young-sook.
l'm not Young-sook. l'm Jina now.
why'd you come looking for the slut?
Hyun-ji.
who's that?
Won- hyung Elementary, 1st grade, your daughter Hyun-ji.
don't know her.
what? You... - Go on, hit me, you loser!
shit. You raise her from now on.
or come live with her.
are you stoned?
Yeah! So l raised her for 8 years not knowing if she was mine.
l want my life back! All right?
then dump her. l don't want her.
what?
her name's Hyun-ji?
l left her at the group home. She didn't even look like me.
l used to get beat up a lot when l grew up in one.
lf you raised her 8 years, she's yours.
lf you're really curious, get a blood test.
no, thanks.
why not?
l never slept with anyone else.
get up.

Hey, you didn't answer me.

sergeant, the new private, sir. - Yeah, okay.
Hey, newbie! - PV2 Lee Seung-young, sir!
watcha do before you got here?
I attended college, sir.
man, check out his tone, will you? What, no salute for your superior?
Salute!
Yeah, whatever...
Hey, Yong-il. - PV1 Sohn Yong-il!
go back to the barracks. - Yes, sir.
Hey, Seung-young...
it's me, Tae-jung.
it's nothing much really.
at first, it's fuckin' hell. But after awhile, it's bearable.
Yes, sir.
what's with the sir? Relax.
Hey, I was meaning to call you but I had no way of getting in touch.
is your mother well? - Yes, she's well, sir.
enough with the sir already. Why, is it weird?
Yeah, a little.
um, I have a question.
can I listen to music on my own in the barracks, like during break?
sure, try it. You'll be marked till the day you leave.
then reading and stuff, when can I start doing that?
Seung-young.
just do as you're told at first.
eat when they tell you, sleep, shit, when they say to.
that's all you need to be good at.
and don't ever tell anyone we went to junior high together.
cause... it'll just be harder for you.
okay.
and at first, don't talk too much.
speak only when you're spoken to. "Yes, sir!" is all you need to say.
okay? - Yeah, okay.
dude, you're so tense. This isn't like you.
I'm not tense. - Yeah, you are.
loosen up. It'll be okay. This bro's looking out for you.
Hello? - Hello?
is this Tae-jung's phone? - Who's this?
um, is this Yoo Tae-jung's phone? - Who is this, please?
Tae-jung! It's me, Seung-young.
Hey, Seung-young. - It is you. I wasn't sure.
wow, it's been ages, man. Are you out on leave?
Yeah. Um... where are you right now?
uh, I'm on my way somewhere...
what are you doing tonight? Are you busy?
Oh, you know. Why, what's up?
if you're free, you wanna get a drink?
sure, that'd be nice.
I'd like to see you before I go back. I've got something to tell you, too.
Yeah, we should catch up. I'd like to see you, man.
okay, I'll go to you. Where are you? - Right now?
Yeah, well, I gotta go home right now.
I didn't go home last night so I told my folks I'm on my way in.
can't you spare a little time?
don't you have any plans tonight?
you're out on leave, you should get laid or something.
then should I go to your house? I won't keep you long.
well, today's not...
where are you right now?
Hey! Been waiting long?
wow, you look like a real soldier now. How long has it been?
you'll make sergeant soon, right? Man, time sure flies.
you've changed a lot. A moustache and everything.
Hey, you're impossible to reach. What is it you do?
Oh, I work at a little Ad agency. Hey, did you eat yet?
name it all, what you wanna eat. It's my treat. Let's go.
now, the spit shine.
the right mix of water and oil, that's what's important, okay?
first, spray some water on the boots.
next, spread the oil and rub it all over like this.
why do you think?
I don't know. - Are you really a college student?
what's the relationship between water and oil?
the two don't mix. - Exactly. That's why it shines.
Why?
cause they don't mix.
what does them not mixing have to do with the shine?
since they don't mix, they work hard not to mix and so there's heat, which is why it shines.
in any case, spray the water and keep rubbing the polish like this and you'll have the spit shine or whatever.
is this really necessary? It just needs to be clean, right?
would the battalion commander even know?
let's say you're the battalion commander.
the other battalion commanders' boots are fuckin' spotless but yours aren't.
how would you feel?
wouldn't you feel bad?
why would l? It's thinking that way that's dumb.
I really don't get the army.
like slippers in the barracks, just go and get them yourself.
why order someone else to?
in the organization that is the army, such trivial matters are important.
they fetched slippers at first, too. You think you won't be like that, too?
why would I be?
I'm going to treat my juniors nicely. I won't be like that even as sergeant.
that's just an excuse.
so fuckin' laid back.
man, at this rank, I'm supervising cleaning the can while someone gets to sit in the office and drink coffee. Shit~
Hey, get him a coffee. - Yes, sir.
the army's fucked up these days, don't you think?
what's so fucked up now, sir?
this morning, a bastard with no rank talked back to SGT Jo Soo-bong.
the dude's so fuckin' nice he's soft.
who was it? - A fuckin' punk.
fuck's about all you say. - What?
nothing, sir. - Sergeant, your coffee, sir.
Hey, Lee Seung-young! - PV2 Lee Seung-young, sir.
do you think that's right?
answer me! Is it right?
well, SGT Jo Soo-bong was wrong, sir.
so you talk back to a senior?
a sergeant can try on a private's underwear if he wants.
what's the big deal?
come to think of it, you talking back to me now?
Hey, Lee Seung-young! Did you really do that?
Yoo Tae-jung! It's because you're soft on him that he acts up.
bastard. You have no respect, do you?
follow me.
why'd you talk back to him in there? All you had to do was apologize.
I didn't do anything wrong. Why apologize?
then you think I go around saying "I'm sorry" cause I'm wrong?
it just makes army life easier.
and Ma Soo-dong, he's kinda simple but he's okay.
apologize and he lets it go. He doesn't hold grudges.
well then, no one's a bad guy.
Hey, Seung-young.
if he gives you shit again, just think 'there he goes again.'
why talk back, huh? You just make your life miserable.
alright. I won't do it again.
Yeah, let's go in.
Hey, is he still stealing privates' underwear?
Hey, can't you just come already? - I don't want to. It's too far.
what do you mean? It's only 1 0 minutes by subway.
you said you were going home before. And that place is too noisy and busy.
that's every place in Seoul. It's only the regulars so it's quiet.
just meet him on your own. What would I do there?
we get to see each other.
don't you want to see me?
you're just going to drink anyway.
Nah, he's gonna go home early.
we drink a little with him and then we'll be alone.
you really won't drink a lot?
promise? - Okay. I promise. Hurry up and come.
isn't this place weird? It's like the 80s.
it's not bad. - Yeah?
Hey, you love your uniform that much? - Why?
why wear it out on leave? It's so hot.
it's too much trouble to change.
just seeing a uniform these days makes me wanna puke.
Hey, someone's gonna come by. That's okay, right?
who?
my girlfriend. She keeps saying she wants to come by.
you have a girlfriend? - Yeah, it's been awhile.
but does she have to come? Can't we just drink, you and me?
well, she already left a while ago. She should be here any minute.
don't worry. It'll be the same whether she's here or not.
besides, she's really nice.
Hey, how are the guys? Hur Ji-hoon, how's he?
Oh, you know.
that dope. He enlisted in Nov, right? So he's Private 1st Class now, huh?
I bet he's still an idiot though.
Tae-jung. Let's drink up. - Yeah, it's good to see you, man.
the winter exercises, it's at least 20 below zero.
other platoons slept in tents but not our platoon.
we were the first and being role models, we dug holes.
sleeping in the ground, you learn a lot from nature.
still, our company commander would give us loads of crap.
but we would, especially me, as their leader, would grin and bear it.
that's how I lead my guys.
the food! Just rice and a stinkin' piece of cabbage. When we ate...
enough about the army. It's boring.
Ji-hae, you lack perseverance.
you need to do some sort of exercise. Like jump rope 200 times a day.
build up your perseverance.
and Korean, you gotta wait till the end, especially army stories.
that's why the elders say, the Korean language, listen till the end.
I'm going to the bathroom so you two discuss. About the army.
tell her exactly what my style is. I'm going to the bathroom.
can I take a picture?
please don't.
Why? You're cool. - I said not to.
you don't like pictures?
that's a form of violence, too.
you seem really close to Tae-jung.
isn't it usually a bit formal even after you're discharged?
how long have you two been going out?
exactly 96 days today. In four days, it'll be 100 days.
how's my Tae-jung?
what do you mean?
a man's point-of-view is supposedly more accurate.
so how's Tae-jung? From a man's perspective?
what do you think, Ji-hae?
he's manly but unexpectedly gentle, too.
do you think you know Tae-jung well?
I'm not sure...
never mind.
the subway will be shutting down soon.
when are you planning to go home?
excuse me?
I mean if you get home too late, don't they worry at home?
I live alone.
what were you guys talking about?
Tae-jung, I'm going to the bathroom.
how long are you going to stay? You're not drinking more, are you?
let's just stay a little longer.
then you two stay and drink. I'm going home.
now what's up? Stay a little more. - I'm going home.
now what? - It's just...
I'm tired.
move. I'm going home. - What's really wrong? Huh?
tell me, the reason you have to leave right now.
why can't I go?
do I have to come when you call and stay if you say so?
Ji-hae, you've no reason to act like this way to me.
stay a bit longer and we'll leave together.
I want to go now.
you two stay. - So tell me why?
you're just going to keep drinking with him anyway.
no, I'm not.
he's come a long way to see me. It's only been two hours.
so stay with him.
what are you guys doing here?
Ji-hae, go inside for a minute.
go on.
what's up?
Hey, Seung-young. What are you going to do?
what do you mean?
um... I'm sorry but I think we're gonna have to call it a night.
let's go get some soju somewhere else.
I really want to...
...but I think I need to be with her tonight.
Why?
did she say something?
I have no idea.
so you're going back tomorrow, huh?
it kinda sucks but let's really get a drink on your next leave.
Tae-jung...
it's just that I really have something important to tell you.
Yeah, I know.
we should talk.
but let's do it next time, okay?
sorry, Seung-young.
turn right and go straight. You'll see the subway station.
there's where you need to go.
see you next time. - Yeah, next time. See ya.
Bye.
SGT Yoo Tae-jung!
this time, block him! You don't and you die!
11 to 12, sir.
I'll carry that, sir. - Nah, it's okay.
12 to 12, sir.
dammit, aren't you going too far? - I'm just blocking, blocking, sir.
bastard, you're fuckin' entering the danger zone.
give SGT Ma Soo-bong back the ball.
fuckin' block him, will you? Block! - Yes, sir.
you, stupid?
Hey, Ji-hoon. - PV2 Hur Ji-hoon, sir!
Hey, be quiet. I told you to relax when you're with me.
Yes, sir.
are you good at sports?
sports, sir?
I like to watch but I'm not good at them, sir.
if I'm reborn, I want to be an athlete. Maybe soccer or baseball.
really, sir?
that's a bit surprising, sir.
Why?
you're quite handsome and you're always reading so I thought you didn't like sports, sir.
Nah, I do. It's just that I'm bad at them.
you're so lucky. - Why?
being so good at basketball.
what do you think of Hur Ji-hoon? I think he's alright.
him?
he seems like a bit of a moron.
you've gotta be strict at first.
be too lax at first and there's no tightening the screws later.
he's a nice guy.
nice is not good, dude.
then what is?
obedience is the best.
that's not good, that's being stupid. - You're so weird, man.
communication Security CP, PV2 Hur Ji-hoon. How may I help you?
you can't help that way. Talk that slow and you're no help.
understand? - Yes, sir.
communication Security CP, SGT Yoo Tae-jung.
fast, precise, clear, got it? - Yes, sir.
Nah, I don't think you do.
hands up.
hands, hands.
lift them up.
how many blows?
one blow, sir. - You think that's enough?
do you? Is it enough? - Yes, sir. It's enough, sir.
okay.
phone's ringing again. Ji-hoon, phone's ringing.
communications Security CP, PV2 Hur Ji-hoon. How may I help you?
I'm the Operations Division officer. - Salute!
the battalion commander's not answering. Where'd he go?
he's not at his seat, sir.
Ji-hoon, he's asking where he went.
he's at his official residence, sir. - What's the number?
the number to the official residence?
9373, sir. - 9373, sir.
it's 9374, 9374.
didn't I tell you to memorize the numbers? Why didn't you? Huh?
I did but I forgot for a second, sir. - Bullshit. What'd you do yesterday?
I memorize numbers all day, sir. - And still, you don't know any of them - What's the number for the PX? - 6371, sir.
9371. Got it?
what the hell did you memorize? Your friends' numbers?
no, sir.
you're a funny one, aren't you? Why are you such an idiot?
sorry, sir.
you're not gonna make it here. How's an idiot like you to survive?
I have you, sir.
and I feel like throwing up every time I see you.
Ji-hoon, I'm gonna give you one hour. Memorize all these numbers in an hour.
okay? - Yes, sir.
I'll re-test you in an hour. You fail and I kill you tonight.
Yes, sir.
got it? - Yes, sir.
man, what are we gonna do with this fuckin' alien, huh?
report.

PV1 Sohn Yong-il, sir!
Yoo Tae-jung. - SGT Yoo Tae-jung, sir.

Where'd you get these?
I was on leave the day before yesterday, sir.
man, you're driving me nuts.

Hey! - PV1 Sohn Yong-il, sir!
sohn Yong-il. - PV1 Sohn Yong-il, sir!

Yes, sir!

thank you, sir.
do you think it's ready, sir?
Yeah, it's done.
is it good? - Yes, sir, it is.
is there anything else you want to do?
I'm fine, sir.
it's alright. You can tell me. I'll make it happen for you.
could I use the phone, sir?
the phone? - Yes, sir.
to who?
it's been awhile since I called my girlfriend, sir.
you have a girlfriend? - Yes, sir.
okay. Let's do it tomorrow.
thank you, sir.
would you like some, sir? - Nah, I'm good. You eat up.
Hey, didn't I tell you, didn't l?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm so fuckin' disappointed in you. Is this the army?
should we all be friends? - No, sir.
it's fucked up, right? You saw how Yong-il and Ji-hoon acted today?
I've been telling them, sir.
they just won't listen, sir. - So? Are you just giving up?
that's not it, sir.
if they don't listen, round them up. Do I have to tell you how, too?
no, sir.
shim Dae-suk.
CPL Shim Dae-suk, sir.
you've gotten pretty talkative.
shape up. It's your last chance. - Yes, sir.
can't they be daring about it? - This isn't what we want, right, sir?
of course not! They should just POW! Shit, I just wasted my eyes on that.
Hey!
Hey!
Hur Ji-hoon! - PV2 Hur Ji-hoon, sir!
come here! - Yes, sir.
Hey, relax. Sit comfortably. Sit.
you were watching TV, weren't you?
no, sir.
you were. I saw you.
I just turned my head and I happened to see the TV, sir.
so you did watch. Seeing is watching. You did watch!
man, this dude's trouble. Look at him lie.
I'm sorry, sir.
Hey! - PV2 Hur Ji-hoon, sir!
who's better looking between us?
Hey, be truthful now. Truthful. - Truthfully, who's better looking?
I still got a lot of time left here. - I might just live here.
lots of time.
who's better looking, sir? - You gonna make me repeat myself?
who's better looking? - Objectively, be objective.
who's better looking? - You both are very different, sir.
of course, we are. Are we the same, dammit?
whose individuality's better, huh?
man, he's fuckin' making me talk. I'm hungry, hurry up and answer.
I think SGT Ma Soo-dong is a tiny bit more handsome, sir.
why you bastard~ - Hey, shut up and sit, you fool.
Oh, aren't you cute? - PV2 Huh Ji-hoon, sir.
let's watch TV. Let's watch. Come under here.
come here! Our little sensible one. There, let's watch.
Hey, he's hard, he's hard.
he's huge. Let me touch it once, huh? - Please don't, sir.
Hey, just once. It's okay, let me see.
Hey, your senior wants to see it. - Please don't, sir.
fuck, what's with all the layers?
SGT Ma Soo-dong, sir. - Ma Soo-dong, what? Don't call me.
come on, let me see it once!
SGT Ma Soo-dong...
that's enough, sir. - What?
he says he doesn't want to, sir.
man, aren't you a fuckin' rude prick?
can't a senior have a little fun? Huh?
your joke's a little extreme, sir. - Fuckin' bastard!
big college man, talking back, I see?
Hey, attention! Attention, dammit! Stand up straight, you dick.
what's going on, sir?
Yoo Tae-jung.
your men have no fuckin' respect. Why can't you teach them right?
now what's happened, sir? - Why don't you tell him?
go on! Where did all that flippin' macho go?
Why? Won't talk to me, I'm so dumb?
fuckin' rude ass bastard. - Why do you hit him now, sir?
let go. I said, let go!
you, follow me.
please stop, sir. - Follow me.
Hey! You wanna die now, too?
please stop, sir.
what if I don't? Huh? What if I don't?
please stop, sir.
what if I don't, you bastard?
stop it, dammit. - Watch your words. I'm your senior.
alright, sir. Please stop, sir.
fuck. Come on, let's go.
fuck? Why you asshole!
what's going on here?
Seung-young... You've gotta be more careful.
there's a lot of talk about you these days.
it's okay when you're with me. It's okay with me but...
that's fine. I don't care about that.
it's their standards. It's not like I'm wrong.
I'm not saying you're wrong.
keep this up and it'll only get harder for you.
what about after I'm discharged? - I'll be okay.
I'm going to change everything once I make sergeant anyway.
that's easy to say.
but it's not as easy as that.
of course, it won't be easy.
let's just drop it.
isn't she pretty, sir?
wow, she is. - I think so, sir.
you've been going out about 3 years?
exactly 3 years and 2 months, sir.
how did you seduce her?
I didn't seduce her, she seduced me, sir.
Really?
I may be like this in here, sir, but on the outside...
yeah?
I'm a bit of a catch, sir.
if you're ever in Pusan, give me a call, sir.
I'll show you a good time, sir. A full course.
okay. Sure.
have you been to Hae-woon-dae, sir? - No.
Salute! - Salute!
what are you guys doing here? - Just taking a little break, sir.
Hey! - PV2 Hur Ji-hoon, sir!
go with him to work detail. - Uh, sir.
Ji-hoon has some work left with me, sir.
what?
some things to finish up with me, sir.
and what's that?
the Senior Staff Sgt. gave us some work to do, sir.
first do this and finish that later.
what are you waiting for? Take him. - Yes, sir.
Hey, let's go. Hurry up.
lee Seung-young. - PV1 Lee Seung-young, sir.
don't you think you're going overboard these days?
what do you mean, sir?
are you pulling crap cause Tae-jung's your friend?
think about it. He's gonna be discharged soon.
what are you gonna do then?
did I do something wrong, sir?
of course you did. You fuckin' hell did.
fuckin' rank-less yet you talk back to your seniors.
acting all big cause you have a junior
don't kid yourself. You only have two juniors. You're still a newbie.
be careful. There are a lot of people waiting for your ass.
it's cause of Tae-jung they let you be not cause they're afraid of you.
got it?
let's talk here, sir.
sorry about the other day.
I mean, you've earned your rank. - No, sir. I was wrong first.
but that Seung-young, he's out of control, isn't he?
I'll give him notice, sir.
aren't you being too easy on him? Being a buddy of yours?
no, I'm really not, sir.
I thought you put personal stuff aside but I guess I was wrong.
all your juniors are talking, man. That you're soft on the bastard.
if you don't set him straight, you don't have a chance with Ji-hoon.
you think he won't act up later?
don't worry, sir. I'll take care of both of them.
Yeah, you do that. I'm just worried, that's all.
to think that you worry about me. Thank you, sir.
anyway, sorry about before. After all, you and I are in the same boat.
you've done great till now, dude. You're a little strange these days.
well, set it right. I'll see you later.
aren't you cute? - PV2 Hur Ji-hoon, sir.
Hey, don't you miss your girlfriend?
Yes, a little, sir. - Tell her to visit. With a friend.
they just need to use my name.
really, sir? - Yeah, dummy.
let's call her later, okay? - Yes, sir.
we'll call her together, right? - Yes, sir.
promise? - Yes, sir.
even the TV's boring, huh?
Yes, sir.
is there nothing fun to do?
Hey, let's see. - Please give it, sir.
look it here. Let go! - Please, sir.
fuckin' let go! I just wanna look...
Hey, Tae-jung! The dope's written you a letter.
I'll read it to you, okay? Listen up.
dear Tae-jung. Thanks for being so good to me.
huh? He doesn't even call you sir.
I know you worry about me a lot.
if I've caused you any trouble, I'm sorry. But I know what I'm doing.
exclamation point.
if we don't understand each other, it's cause we're different.
stop now.
tell me where it is.
you and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours.
I don't know what you are talking about.
is it a secret you will die for?
please. - As you wish.
wait!
my god, forgive me.
in the sacristy...
...the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line.
beneath the Rose.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
symbols are a language that can help us understand our past.
as the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words...
...but which words?
interpret for me, please, this symbol. First thing that comes to mind.
hatred, racism. - Ku Klux Klan.
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would disagree with you in Spain.
there, they are robes worn by priests.
now this symbol. Anyone?
evil.
in English, please.
devil's pitchfork.
poor, poor Poseidon.
that is his trident. A symbol of power to millions of the ancients.
now this symbol.
Madonna and child. - Faith. Christianity.
no. No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother, Isis...
...centuries before the birth of Christ.
understanding our past determines actively...
...our ability to understand the present.
so how do we sift truth from belief?
how do we write our own histories, personally or culturally...
...and thereby define ourselves?
how do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion...
...to find original truth?
tonight, this will be our quest.
my son is a student of yours at Harvard.
michael Culp? He adores you. - Oh, yeah.
he says you're the best teacher he's ever had.
ms. Culp, I think I already gave Michael an A-minus.
he told me. Thank you.
Hi.
Bonjour, professor.
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ. A kind of French FBI.
will you take a look at this photo, please?
my police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped...
...considering your expertise and the markings on the body...
...you might assist us.
will you excuse me a moment?
I was supposed to have drinks with him.
Yes, we know.
we found your name in his daily planner.
he never showed. I waited for over an hour.
why would someone do this to him?
he was shot, yes.
but what you see in the photograph...
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.
teacher, all four are dead.
the senechaux and the grand Master himself.
then I assume you have the location.
confirmed by all.
independently.
I had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail.
the prospect of death is strong motivation.
it is here.
in Paris, Teacher.
it hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.
you will go forth, Silas.
I chastise my body.
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
okay.
Mr. Langdon. - Yes.
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.
you like our pyramid?
it's magnificent.
a scar on the face of Paris.
after me, please.
it's the pairing of those two pyramids.
it's unique.
the two are geometric echoes.
fascinating.
I'm not sure how much help I'm gonna be here this evening.
how well did you know the curator?
not very well.
frankly, I was surprised when he contacted me.
could we take the stairs?
so Sauniere requested tonight's meeting.
Yes.
how? Did he call you?
e-mail. He heard I was in Paris.
had something to discuss.
what?
you seem uncomfortable.
the grand gallery. This is where you found the body.
how would you know that?
I recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.
dear god.
let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence.
many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.
others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society.
obviously, some people fear what they don't understand.
perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.
the press continue to be harsh with us.
we are not Cafeteria Catholics.
we don't pick and choose which rules to follow.
we follow doctrine. Rigorously.
does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing...
...and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?
many of our followers are married. Many of them have families.
only a small proportion choose to live ascetic lives.
why are some media referring...? - That will be all, Michael, thank you.
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.
it hides beneath the Rose.
my part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.
I meet the council in an hour.
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.
the Vitruvian Man.
it's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.
and the star on his skin?
a pentacle.
and its meaning?
the pentacle is a pagan religious icon.
devil worship.
no. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.
this is a symbol for Venus.
it represents the female half of all things...
you are telling me that Sauniere's last act on earth...
...was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why?
captain Fache, obviously I can't tell you why.
I can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol...
...and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
is that so? - Yes.
then...
...what do you make of this?
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint.
it's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
what would you do if you had such limited time to send a message?
well, I suppose I'd try to identify my killer.
precisely.
precisely.
so, professor...
officer Neveu.
please, pardon the interruption.
this is not the time.
I received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters...
...and I've deciphered the code.
it's a Fibonacci sequence.
that's the code Sauniere left on the floor.
headquarters sent me to explain, captain.
it is the Fibonacci sequence.
the numbers are out of order.
but before that, I have an urgent message for Professor Langdon.
right?
pardon me?
I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.
your embassy called Division.
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death.
this is the number of your embassy's messaging service.
well, thank you.
Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu.
miss Neveu? This...
no. That's the right number.
you have to dial an access code to pick up your messages.
but I'm getting...
it's a three-digit code. It's on the paper I gave you.
professor Langdon, do not react to this message.
you must follow my directions very closely and, above all...
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
you are in grave danger.
church of Saint-Sulpice.
good evening, Sister.
I need you to show someone our church tonight.
of course, Father.
but so late?
wouldn't tomorrow?
this is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei.
it would be my pleasure.
there's been an accident. A friend.
I have to fly home in the morning.
I see.
is there a restroom I could use? I just wanna splash some water on my face.
Yes.
she said it is meaningless.
mathematical joke.
is it meaningless?
I'll take another look when I come back.
I'm sorry. Of course.
do you have a message from Sauniere?
what are you talking about?
crazy old man.
you have me confused with someone else. I came here to...
check your jacket pocket.
just look.
GPS tracking dot.
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
the agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket...
...in case you tried to run.
we have you on a little leash, professor.
why would I try to run? I didn't do anything.
so, what do you think about the fourth line of text...
...Fache wiped clean before you arrived?
he brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon.
he's still in there? What's he doing?
Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay?
he is sure you're guilty.
when did Sauniere contact you?
today? - Yes, yes.
what time? What time?
at 3. Around 3. Three.
we call Fache " the Bull." Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
he can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case.
and by then whatever Sauniere wanted you to tell me will be useless.
stop it! Just stop!
who are you?
look at the letters.
P. S. postscript.
princesse Sophie." Silly, I know.
but I was only a girl when I lived with him.
jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.
apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet.
if you help me understand why...
...I will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you.
Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he?
no.
if we are to get away from here, we must find another way.
what exactly do you propose?
Sauniere was reading his book.
blood trail.
excuse me, captain.
we have a problem.
headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.
what?
captain, look at this.
he jumped!
shit.
he's moving again. And fast.
he must be in a car.
he's going south on Pont du Carrousel.
bastard.
that cop will check the whole lower floor.
I will only take a moment.
of course.
he is much older than I remember.
I hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time.
he phoned my office today. Several times.
he said it was a matter of life and death.
I thought it was another trick to get back in touch.
it seems when he couldn't speak to me...
...he reached out to you.
wait a minute. - Professor?
this is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.
the Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order.
these are scrambled.
if he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code.
would you hold this, please?
this phrase is meaningless.
unless you assume these letters are out of order too.
an anagram.
you have eidetic memory?
not quite. But I can pretty much remember what I see.
anagram is right.
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint " becomes:
Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa.
professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.
look at this. He must have thrown it from the window.
smart to hit the truck.
what, you admire him now?
we're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!
her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies.
the horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right.
Why?
well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right.
historically, the left was female, the right was male.
there. Blood.
Hey.
so dark the con of man.
no. It doesn't say that.
is it another anagram? Can you break it?
professor, hurry. Hurry!
moon. Sermon. Charms.
demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.
Madonna of the Rocks.
da Vinci.
careful. Careful.
this can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.
it was Sauniere's.
I remember finding it once when I was a girl.
he'd promised he'd give it to me one day.
have you ever heard those words before, Sophie?
so dark the con of man "?
no. Have you?
when you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings?
anything ritualistic in nature?
meetings your grandfather would've wanted kept secret?
was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion?
the what? Why are you asking these things?
the Priory of Sion is a myth.
one of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton, da Vinci himself.
the fleur-de-lis is their crest.
they're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to...
...as " the dark con of man.
but what secret?
the Priory of Sion protects the source of god's power on earth.
I can't do this by myself.
I'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy.
please.
even if we could get out of this...
okay.
no, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it!
well, that was...
we need to get out of sight.
Christ, give me strength.
you are a ghost.
Christ, give me strength.
stealing in a house of god!
you are an angel.
Christ, give me strength.
you have powerful friends.
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.
I could not miss this chance to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.
a pity you couldn't wait for morning.
the light is not ideal.
tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.
a rose line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles.
set into the streets of Paris, 135 brass markers...
...mark the world's first prime meridian...
...which passed through this very church.
it hides beneath the Rose.
I'm sorry?
sister.
I do not want to keep you. I will show myself out.
I insist.
may the peace of the Lord be with you.
and with you.
they found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station.
and two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card.
a decoy, I'm sure.
all the same, send an officer to the station.
question all the taxi drivers. I'll put this on the wire.
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.
robert Langdon is guilty.
this is the Bois de Boulogne?
we should be safe in this park for a few minutes.
stay here.
police.
what do you want?
fifty euros for all your stuff.
go and get something to eat.
did it occur to you that could be dangerous?
no. And now we have a place to think.
any ideas, professor?
you could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51.
what's the next step?
with him, it's always:
Sophie, what's the next step?
puzzles.
codes.
a treasure hunt.
to find his killer.
maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion.
I hope not.
any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church.
it all started over a thousand years ago when a French king conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.
this crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history...
...was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood...
...the Priory of Sion...
...and their military arm, the Knights Templar.
but the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.
that was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth.
supposedly the invasion was to find an artefact...
...lost since the time of Christ.
an artefact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess.
did they find it, this buried treasure?
put it this way:
one day the Templars simply stopped searching.
they quit the Holy Land and travelled directly to Rome.
whether they blackmailed the papacy...
...or the Church bought their silence, no one knows.
but it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights these Knights Templar, of limitless power.
by the 1300s, the Templars had grown too powerful.
too threatening.
so the Vatican issued secret orders...
...to be opened simultaneously all across Europe.
the Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers...
...and said god had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics.
the plan went off like clockwork.
the Templars were all but exterminated.
the date was October 13th, 1307. A Friday.
friday the 13th.
the Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure...
...but they found nothing.
the few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished...
...and the search for their sacred artefact began again.
what artefact? I've never heard about any of this.
Yes, you have.
almost everyone on earth has.
you just know it as the Holy grail.
please, Sauniere thought he knew the location of the Holy grail?
maybe more than that.
this cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look，this metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.
and these dots. These dots are read by a laser.
this is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you.
he left us, professor.
and vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp.
it's a street address.
this is Jacques Sauniere.
please leave a message after the tone.
please, Monsieur Sauniere, pick up the phone.
this is Sandrine Bieil.
I have called the list.
I fear the other guardians are dead.
the lie has been told.
the floor panel has been broken.
please, monsieur, pick up the phone. I beg you.
job 38, verse 11.
do you know it, Sister?
job 38: 11.
hitherto shalt thou come...
...but no further.
but no further.
do you mock me?
where is the keystone?
I do not know.
no.
you are a sister of the Church...
...and yet you serve them: The Priory.
Jesus had but one true message. That...
come, you saints of god.
hasten, angels of the Lord.
to receive her soul.
and bring her to the sight of the Almighty.
welcome, bishop.
this council is convened.
our words shall never pass these walls.
what business, say you?
as you know, my request for funds...
Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds.
a tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, bishop?
I only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men.
how humble.
our saviour, Bishop Aringarosa.
how dare you presume to...
I do not presume, I act!
the Vatican's unwillingness to support us...
...is both impious and cowardly.
blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!
this council has forgotten its very purpose.
tonight...
...the grail will be destroyed.
the Priory's few remaining members will be silenced.
I was contacted by a man who calls himself only "the Teacher.
two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu...
...getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne.
because of your expertise?
I'm sorry? - About the Priory.
do you think that's why Sauniere sought you out?
I can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it.
actually, I didn't think he liked me very much.
once made a joke at my expense. Got a big laugh out of it.
what was it?
how may I help you?
the door to the right, please.
good evening. I am Andre Vernet, the night manager.
I take it this is your first visit to our establishment?
Yes.
understood.
keys are often passed on and first-time users are sometimes uncertain of protocol.
keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.
often willed through generations.
is it yours, mademoiselle?
the shortest safety-deposit-box lease is 50 years.
and what's your longest account?
quite a bit longer.
technologies change, keys are updated.
once the computer confirms your key...
...enter your account number and your box is retrieved.
the room is yours, as long as you like.
what if I lost track of my account number?
how might I recover it?
I'm afraid each key is paired with a 10-digit number...
...known only to the account bearer.
I hope you manage to remember it.
a single wrong entry disables the system.
ten. - Ten.
your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.
scrambled, unscrambled?
unscrambled.
it's your key.
funny, I don't even like history.
I've never seen much good come from looking to the past.
moment of truth.
my god. I don't believe this.
a rose.
the rose was a symbol for the Holy grail.
forgive the intrusion.
I'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than I anticipated.
you must follow me, please.
for your own safety.
you knew they were coming?
my guard alerted me to your status when you arrived.
yours is one of our oldest and highest-level accounts.
it includes a safe-passage clause.
safe passage?
if you would step inside, please. Time is of the essence.
in there?
Hey, is there a problem?
good evening, sir. Police.
I just drive from here to Zurich. Not French, English?
English? - Yes.
we are looking for two criminals.
you came to the right place. They're all criminals here.
would you mind opening the hold?
please. You think they trust us, the wages I get paid?
you don't have keys to your own truck?
it's armoured. Keys get sent to the destination.
you mind? I'm on a schedule here.
and do all the drivers wear a Rolex?
what?
this piece of shit.
forty euros in Barbes.
yours for 35.
no, no, no.
thirty. - No. It's okay, it's okay.
come on, 30, eh?
I said, no!
move along!
now we wait.
the Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money.
you have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours.
Yes, I have. And I have given him an angel to do his will.
for surely there is no better soldier for god than my Silas.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins...
...to do penance and to amend my life.
Amen.
the Holy grail.
a magic cup. The source of god's power on earth.
it's nonsense.
you don't believe in god.
no.
just people.
sometimes that they can be kind.
are you a god-fearing man, professor?
I was raised a Catholic.
well, that's not really an answer.
professor, are you okay?
go ahead, open it.
go on.
a cryptex.
they are used to keep secrets.
it's da Vinci's design.
you write the information on a papyrus scroll...
...which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar.
if you force it open, the vial breaks...
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...
...and your secret is lost forever.
who are you? - Cliff Harting.
I'm Grace. Grace Sherman.
I've only known you for a few months, and we've never really talked much.
I just got called for a job, but I have to leave tomorrow.
I am not the most experienced sailor.
I can't imagine anyone I would rather be lost at sea with.
okay, great. Come by whenever you want.
I'm always ready for you.
I mean... the gallery is ready.
to display your prints.
Bye.
I didn't sound nervous, did I?
let me guess. John Bowman?
he wants to bring by 14 prints to sell.
14?
doesn't he usually only bring a few at a time?
I know, it's unusual, but good for the gallery.
his photos always attract a crowd.
just his photos?
cedar Cove Art Gallery.
Hey, honey. I'm about to head over to the Captain's Galley for dinner. You want to join me?
I'd love to, mom. Rain check?
Seth's coming home today.
Oh, that's great.
how did his job go?
I don't know.
communication's not so great on those boats.
I'm lucky if I get an email.
well, is he gonna take you to dinner?
actually, I'm cooking dinner for him, on the boat.
kind of a welcome-home surprise.
you're cooking?
well, I didn't say that it would be a pleasant surprise.
we're sorry...
where are you?
so he hasn't called you or emailed you?
nothing.
I'm sure he's just delayed, you know?
maybe the ship came in late They were catching so many fish, they decided to stay out longer.
what about contacting the company he's working for?
I called this morning.
Monohan Fisheries. I got the voicemail.
hopefully, they'll call me back, although the guy on the recording sounded pretty sketchy.
it's Alaska, what do you expect?
now, come on, both of you, stop it.
I can see it in your faces.
you're both starting to worry already.
trust me. Seth is fine.
he just got tied up, that's all.
maybe I should go up there and find him myself. - No!
this is the nature of the job. It's unpredictable.
this kind of thing's bound to happen.
okay, I'll tell you what irks me is, you went to all that trouble to surprise him.
he owes you big-time when he gets back here.
moon! - I know what you want!
Oh. Yes, please, go. You're excused.
let me know when you hear from Seth. - Absolutely.
wow... hey there. - Hey!
how are you?
well, the day didn't start so good, but then I got a phone call, then it got a whole lot better.
Really? Did you hear from Eric?
no. No. Still nothing there.
Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought... - No, it's fine.
I've tried making several phone calls,
I've sent emails, I just... get no response.
give him time. He'll come around.
so, then what was the call about?
I got a job offer.
I mean, just a quick freelance assignment.
a guy I know, he writes for a paper in Seattle.
he covers the Mariners, but he's got a wedding he's got to go to next weekend, so he asked if I would cover the Saturday game.
that's great.
it is. I get my own byline.
it's a foot back in the door.
I mean, a couple of months ago no one would even talk to me, let alone give me an assignment, and in sports, no less, so...
so, this might lead to something bigger?
no, I doubt it.
I mean, you never know, but I'm just glad that they thought of me, that's all.
well, that's terrific, Jack. You deserve it.
well, I should run.
gotta finish this Pulitzer-worthy article on the new play that the theater is putting on.
Oh. What play is it?
Romeo and Juliet.
everything alright with you?
well, usually, you only bring three or four prints at a time to sell so, naturally, I start wondering.
I lost my job.
your job? I thought this was your job.
the money I make selling photographs is good, but it's not enough to pay the bills.
Oh. I'm sorry.
what was your job?
chef. - Chef!
wow, really?
where?
seafood place in Tacoma. - That's great.
I mean, not that you lost your job, but you're a chef.
so what happened? Place close down?
no.
Oh. Sorry.
well, uh...
don't you worry about these prints.
they are definitely going to sell.
Hey, you! - Hey.
I was waiting for you to get out of court.
I wanted to, uh...
talk to you about something.
Oh. What's up?
well, I know, earlier, when I told you about the freelance job, you seemed a little concerned.
no, Jack, I'm fine.
it's great that you got the offer.
I just want you to know that it doesn't affect us, okay?
I mean, you and me.
whatever happens...
I'm crazy about you. You know that, right?
so, uh...
I had a thought.
why don't you come with me?
now wait a minute. Was he laid off, or was he fired?
I don't know. I didn't ask.
figured I'd made him uncomfortable enough.
me and my big mouth.
thank you.
you know, they're looking to hire a new chef at the Captain's Galley.
maybe he could apply there.
kind of a step down from his restaurant in Tacoma.
might bring him to Cedar Cove on a more permanent basis.
I got it
Oh. So... You like this guy.
unfortunately, I don't think he likes me.
Oh, come on.
how can anybody not like you?
you're adorable. - I know, right?
but he's just...
well, he's not much of a talker.
and you're surprised? Look at his photos!
there's no people in them. It's just nature.
I've tried to get him to open up, make conversation.
Aw, sweetie. He's probably just shy.
what's wrong?
who was that?
the fishing company in Alaska.
Seth's ship came in on-time, as scheduled.
he collected his pay, and now nobody's seen him since.
how far is this lake? - Almost there.
I got to warn you,
I had real terrible luck last time I went fishing.
don't worry about it. You're gonna love this spot.
it's my favorite lake in the region.
you used to do this professionally?
no, no. I worked the big commercial vessels out of the Sound, up and down the coast.
even had a boat of my own for a while.
do you miss it?
Yeah, I do.
I don't miss the hours or the storms.
the camaraderie, mostly.
Yeah. I hear ya.
it's what I miss about the stadium press rooms.
bet you're excited to get back to it next week.
Yeah.
I mean, it's only one game, but, yeah, I'll take it.
it's a lot prettier on the water. Come on.
grace! Wait up. I need to talk to you.
Oh. Look, just... before you say anything, just take a deep breath and relax. Alright?
just because nobody's seen him in a few days, does not mean anything bad has happened.
what are you talking about?
what are you talking about?
I wanted to tell you about Jack. He invited me on a trip with him.
a trip! Really?
Oh, my gosh, that is great! - So, what were you talking about?
did Justine hear something about Seth or something?
the company finally called her back.
Seth finished the job, he collected his pay, nobody's seen him since, but it doesn't mean anything bad has happened, so I don't want you to go all...
ladies. - Cliff, hi.
I don't think you've met my friend, Olivia Lockhart?
well, I haven't had the pleasure.
nice to meet you. - And you.
cliff is the son of Tom Harting, the country singer.
of course he is.
listen, you're busy. I can come back.
no problem. I have got to run anyway.
I will call you later.
I don't want you going all worry-wart on me, and I want to hear all about that trip!
I hope I didn't interrupt anything. - No! It's alright.
so what can I do for you?
I'd like to get a library card.
knock-knock.
so you heard.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm just trying to see if Seth left any other contact information.
the guy at the fishing company was not much help.
did you call the police?
Yeah, some deputy. Said he would look into it.
but I'm just another girlfriend whining about her boyfriend not making it home on time.
well, I'm sure he's fine, and there's a perfectly good explanation.
such as?
Maybe...he got another job and he had to ship off right away.
and you don't think he would take a minute to call?
you said it yourself...
communication's really hard on those boats.
maybe he tried and he couldn't get through.
I mean, this job of his...
it's to be expected, it's not exactly a 9-to-5 kind of life.
I'm aware of that, mom.
it's nothing against Seth. - No! Just me dating Seth.
look, I know that you think that I might have rushed into this relationship, and maybe I did, but I can't...
can't what, sweetie?
I can't help but think that maybe it's time that I stop thinking about what I should do, and start thinking about what it is that I want to do.
I'm all for that, Justine.
whatever you want to do with your life, whoever you want to spend it with,
I just want you to be happy.
come on, sweetheart.
everything's gonna be okay.
can I help you look?
your card, sir.
now, remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
what's that supposed to mean?
means you don't get my books back in time, you suffer my wrath.
don't wanna do that. - No.
so what's your first checkout gonna be?
some sprawling historical epic?
what about a biography?
Lincoln? Washington? - You got any books on alpacas?
alpacas?
thinking about getting a few for my ranch.
Why? Do you ride 'em? - No - No? - No, you shear 'em.
soft as cashmere, stronger than wool.
you should come out sometime.
t-to your ranch? - Sure. It's close.
maybe fix you some lunch.
maybe go for a ride. Do you ride?
horses? No.
but I-it's something, you know, I've always thought about trying.
well, there you go.
okay.
I think you're a really nice man, and I... I like you, it's just...
I... I'm just recently divorced after 26 years of marriage.
I'm sorry to hear that. - No, no. It's okay.
I mean, the marriage was in trouble for years, it was just neither one of us wanted to admit it.
anyway...
the point is, um...
I'm just not ready to date... again.
it's too soon. - Well, who said anything about a date?
I invited you for a ham sandwich and a horseback ride.
I'm not ready for a ham sandwich, either.
I guess I'll have to settle for, uh, a book on alpacas.
okay. Come on. They're over here.
patience... Patience, my friend.
when you're tense, the fish are tense.
they feed off of your energy.
Really?
no.
you walked right into that one. - Yep!
Hey, about this gig covering the Mariners, any chance of parlaying that into something permanent?
Oh, I don't know.
no, I don't think so.
for years now, I've been trying to get back into the sportswriting scene, so.
you'll get back into it.
Yeah, I hope so.
what's Olivia say about it?
well, they haven't offered me anything yet, so, uh, for now, we're just going to go and enjoy the weekend.
she's coming with you? - It's nothing official yet.
I mean, I've asked her, and she said she'll check her schedule...
I'm not exactly sure what that means.
maybe it means she's gonna check her schedule.
you two are getting pretty close.
I hope I just don't screw it up.
Bob, you've been married a long time.
what's the secret?
Ah, relationships take work, they need to be nurtured.
you can't become, uh...
well, I lost everything.
I had a second chance with my son, Eric, but I blew that.
he doesn't want anything to do with me now.
at this time.
what do you mean, "At this time"?
life is a marathon, not a sprint.
it's a long, long road.
Eric doesn't want to talk to you "At this time,
but that doesn't mean he won't come around tomorrow.
it's the best restaurant in Cedar Cove.
I spoke to the manager today and he'd love to talk to you.
they've been looking to update their menu, especially the seafood.
is 11: 00 A. M. tomorrow okay?
I'll let him know.
Bye.
John Bowman's going to interview for the chef job at the Captain's Galley.
that's great.
are you still checking that Alaska news site?
two hikers were attacked by a grizzly bear.
it just lunged out of the trees, with no warning.
that's news?
that kind of thing happens all the time up there.
bears everywhere!
what?
there's a float plane crash in Harris Bay, right near where Seth was working.
both the passenger and the pilot survived.
he wasn't on the plane.
good.
wouldn't catch me on one of those things.
landing on the water like that?
wind and the waves?
death-trap.
are you serious?
he's great and he's gorgeous.
of course, you're gonna go with him.
it's a big step in a relationship.
it's one night in Seattle, it's not a marriage proposal.
I know...
it's been a long time.
Ohh! Don't worry.
it's like riding a bicycle. You're gonna be fine.
and dare I say, you might even enjoy yourself.
I just don't know if I want to go that fast.
do you like him?
Yes.
and how does he make you feel when you're with him?
well, then, I rest my case, your honor.
you're gonna have to just clear your schedule, go to Seattle with him, and just allow yourself to have fun for once.
Hey! Look who's here.
Oh, hey, honey. - Hey Grace.
what happened?
I just stopped by to tell you that I'm going out of town a few days, up to Alaska.
what? - I can't just sit around and do nothing,
I need to find out what's going on and I think the best way to do that is just for me to go up there and look.
the fishing company is in a town called Seward and I booked a connecting flight through Anchorage.
have to take one of those float planes.
is there a problem with that?
Oh! Of course not. You're an adult, you can do what you want.
but...it hasn't really been that long.
sweetie, just give it a bit more time. - I have.
this is not like Seth.
he would've called me.
something happened, and I can't get any answers over the phone.
but to just blindly go up to Alaska without knowing anyone?
do you even know where you're gonna stay?
they have motels up there, mom.
I've already booked a room.
see? That's... now, that's good.
no, it's not good.
look, this is something that I need to do on my own.
and besides, I don't even know how long I'm gonna be up there.
I just think there's got to be somebody else you can call.
I have tried everything.
and either people don't return my calls or they don't have any information.
then why go up there? Why not just give it a few days and see if...
mom. I came here to tell you that I'm going, not to ask for your permission.
so I'll call you when I get there.
here we go.
that should be good.
what a day, huh?
Hey. I warned you, Bob.
when it comes to fishing, I'm bad luck.
how so?
come on! How many hours were we out there, huh?
not a single fish caught, not even a nibble.
that's why they call it "fishing,
not "catching."
I ran Seth's name through the AP wire and all the other known agencies, including the local affiliates up there in Alaska, and nothing came up.
I guess that's good.
believe me, if he'd been in an accident, somebody would've covered it.
not a lot of news up that way.
I really appreciate you doing this, Jack.
Oh, it's not a problem.
just must be kind of hard on Justine, huh?
the not knowing.
it is. She doesn't handle this kind of thing well.
surprises. Anything unexpected.
well, it's understandable, after everything she's been through in life.
Yeah.
when her brother died, she didn't want to be alone.
for months, she wouldn't let me out of her sight.
the fear of abandonment, the suddenness of having your whole world turned upside-down in a moment, without warning...
so she looks for stability, a sense of structure, safety...
can't say I blame her.
Hey! - Hey.
how'd it go?
I got the job. - You did?
that's great!
how was the interview?
he just asked me to make something, and I did, and, uh, he liked it.
he said I could start tonight.
that's awesome. Congratulations.
maybe we could celebrate after your shift.
I'm not really sure when I'm gonna be off.
Oh. Okay.
well, I just came by to say thank you.
no problem. Glad I could help.
so does this mean you'll be moving here?
I don't know. Uh, maybe.
we'll see how it goes.
I can help you find a place, if you want.
house, apartment.
it's just you, right?
you don't have any family, or anything?
what do you mean, like, wife and kids?
No!
well, yes, maybe not kids - but I didn't know if... - No.
no? - No family, no.
that's great!
I mean, uh...
well, I should get going.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hi, mom. It's me.
Oh! You made it.
Yeah.
well, the first leg of the trip.
I'm in Anchorage.
float plane terminal, trying to figure out how I'm gonna get to Seward.
Why? What's... what's wrong?
flight was canceled.
apparently, there are strong winds in Seward, and everything's grounded, coming in or out.
for how long?
a day, a week... They don't know.
weather up there can be unpredictable.
the guy at the counter suggested I rent a car and drive myself.
drive?
it's not that far. About three hours.
in Alaska, that's a quick trip to the market.
well, please be careful.
I will.
and call me if you need me.
I love you.
I love you too.
Bye, sweetie.
a new project?
Yeah.
just a little woodworking 101.
this is gonna be a picture frame.
I think the birdhouse was a little too ambitious for me.
you okay?
I'm just... really busy.
sounds like you need a relaxing weekend in Seattle.
about that...
I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
Oh.
couldn't clear your schedule?
no, I just...
now's not a good time.
I've got full docket the next few weeks, and this whole thing with Justine and Seth...
right. I heard she flew up to Alaska.
Yeah. And she was having a hard time getting from Anchorage to Seward, and who knows if she's even gonna find Seth when she gets there.
Wow.
sounds like a big deal for her, flying up there all by herself.
it is.
I mean, she rarely travels.
I'm sure she is gonna be fine.
it's gonna be fine.
come here.
truth be told, it was both of them.
for months after Jordan died, neither would let the other one out of their sight.
Olivia would sit in Justine's room half the night, just trying to make sure she was safe.
can't imagine trying to deal with that kind of loss.
Oh, it was horrible, watching them go through it.
even Stan. He meant well, but he just wasn't capable of dealing with it.
he and Jordan were so close.
when he died,
Stan just ran away and hid.
got rid of most of his stuff...
his toys, his clothes.
avoided anything that reminded him of that pain.
including Olivia and Justine?
sadly, yes.
Olivia tried to keep the marriage together, but...
Oh, it was just a really bad time.
Olivia didn't sleep for months, but she kept it together.
she was the strong one.
Ah, even so, you never really recover from something like that.
she used to be so much more outgoing, but it's like, since that day, she's just always on her guard, waiting for the next crisis.
Mm. Must be exhausting for her.
and that is why she needs us, just to shake her up, remind her that there's still plenty of joy in this life.
we just have to show her how to find it.
you are a good friend, Grace.
Yes, I am.
where am I supposed to go?
no maps? Seriously?
thank you
no...
no, no, no, no, no!
this can't be happening.
this cannot be happening.
what is it? What's wrong?
calm down. Nothing's wrong.
it's 2: 00 in the morning.
and I knew you would still be wide awake, like you always are when you're stressed out.
valerian tea. Better than any sleeping pill.
Jack is terrific.
what are you so afraid of?
nothing. It's just the timing's not right.
I don't know when Justine's gonna get back, or if she's even gonna find Seth.
what does that have to do with you going away for the weekend?
you have a cell phone.
if Justine needs to reach you, she'll call you.
I feel like I need to be here.
that's why you turned down the judgeship.
this need to be here, to watch over Justine, the whole town, to keep us safe.
we're okay, Olivia, and so are you.
I mean, this thing with Jack, there's always gonna be some kind of risk involved with a new relationship, but sometimes you just have to go ahead and take that leap of faith.
remember, most times in life, bad things don't happen.
stop!
stop
car trouble?
go ahead, try and start 'er.
look at you. Poor thing.
scared to death.
I'm not from around here.
Really? Never would've guessed.
sorry.
I guess, uh...
getting stuck out here all night brought back every horror movie I've ever seen.
relax.
I left the chainsaw at home.
here's your problem!
loose starter wire.
can you fix it?
just did.
give her a go.
thank you so much!
I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come along.
Oh, you'd have stay put, bundled up, got through the night.
first thing in the morning, there'd be 30 trucks comin' by.
folks up here gotta depend on other folks.
somebody would've helped you.
where are you from, honey?
cedar Cove, Washington.
near Seattle.
I'm up here looking for my boyfriend.
he's working on a fishing boat out of Seward.
Seward's that way, not too far.
I'm goin' the opposite direction.
okay.
thank you.
it's a heck of a rush, ain't it?
what is?
fear.
my daddy used to say you're never more alive than when you're scared half to death.
good luck to you.
did he at least thank you for getting him the job?
Yeah, but... I don't know.
I've tried everything to show him I'm interested, even suggested we go out to celebrate after his shift.
nothing.
maybe I'm just not his type.
or maybe he just doesn't like being chased.
you should let him come after you.
what, just sit back and do nothing?
I know keeping quiet is a little out of your comfort zone.
you're a Sherman.
when you want something, you go get it, like a lion taking down a wildebeest.
but why not just try something new?
Hey.
are you okay?
Yeah, I just must've dozed off. I didn't sleep well last night.
listen, why don't I drive you home?
you look exhausted.
no, I've got a big case load tomorrow.
I've a lot of work to do.
I'm fine, Jack.
I've got to finish this up.
okay.
excuse me?
Hi.
I was just at Monohan Fisheries.
I'm looking for a guy named Seth Gunderson.
he was working on the Bella Vista.
they said somebody here might have seen him.
I know Seth.
I crewed with him on the Bella Vista.
do you know where he is now?
heard he took another job.
independent boat, big pay.
they should be back today.
pier three. It's that way.
you, uh, want me to show you? - No. Thank you.
I can find it.
Hey. - Hi.
I was just on my way to the gallery. I got two more prints for you.
give them to me here.
I'll find room for them.
Oh. Uh...
thanks again for helping get me the job.
no problem!
guess I'll see you around?
Yeah. See ya.
it's beginning to affect her work.
I mean, I've never seen her like that.
I tried to talk to her afterwards, but you know her, she says she's fine.
I don't know, Grace, I'm worried about her.
I feel like...
maybe we should do something.
don't worry.
I will handle this. I know what to do.
it is time to shake her up.
how?
I don't know about this.
I know you don't!
I've never ridden before.
trust me, you are gonna love it.
don't worry. We'll take it real nice and slow.
Missy here is a real gentle horse, she'll treat you real nice.
we are not going anywhere till you get up on that thing, so the sooner you do it, the sooner we get to go home.
alright, grab the reins with your left hand, grab the saddle horn, left foot in the stirrup, swing that right leg up and over...
Oh, dear.
you alright?
Yeah, I'm just looking for the seatbelt.
alright, grab the reins in both hands, slightly apart.
thumbs down.
that's good.
now, to stop the horse, you wanna bring the reins in tight to your body, - and soften your hands forward. - Okay.
and steer, arms slightly forward, pull gently to the left.
other way to go right.
to make the horse go forward, you just wanna squeeze the horse gently with both your legs.
squeeze the sides? - Yeah.
okay. Squeeze the sides.
here we go!
and we're walkin'!
okay...
can I go home now?
No!
you're looking good.
okay. So is it my turn? - Your turn.
okay, so...
reins in the left hand - here we go
okay.
there you go. - Aw, geez.
okay. Easy! Easy now, Volcano.
you're looking great, Olivia. - I am?
well, you know you are.
some people, they're naturals.
comes to 'em real easy.
put 'em on a horse, they feel free.
so go ahead. Hit the gas!
get some wind in your hair.
Y-you... You heard the man.
just go and hit the gas!
you just... Stay still.
definitely a natural.
well, what about me?
Ah, not so much.
no?
Oh... geez.
What're you doing here?
I was worried. I didn't hear from you.
I sent you an email from the boat. Didn't you get it?
no.
figures. Look, the connection's horrible.
I'm sorry, but you know, this job came up so last-minute, and we had to shove off immediately.
it's okay.
I'm just glad you're alright.
God, I can't believe you're here!
what... did you come up here all by yourself?
Yes!
my flight was canceled, and I had to rent a car, which broke down in the middle of the night, a hundred Miles from the closest town.
Oh, God. That's the trip from hell.
no, actually...
well, okay, it was kind of scary, but it was also, in a weird way, kind of fun!
I've never felt so alive.
okay, who are you and what have you done with Justine?
just don't tell my mom.
you know how she worries about every little thing.
Yeah.
about time you came back.
how was it?
not bad!
Hey.
where have you been?
with Grace.
on an adventure.
Really? Wow. Adventures are good.
speaking of which...
the trip next weekend,
I'm in.
Really?
Absolutely.
what is that smell?
Oh. Horse.
I guess I should've showered before I came over.
Hello?
Hi, mom.
where are you?
Seward, Alaska.
I found him.
Seth? Is he okay?
Yeah. He's okay.
it's a long story.
he did try to email me, and it got all messed up.
but we're gonna fly out tomorrow morning, and should be home tomorrow night.
that's great.
what a relief.
mom...
I had to do this.
I know, sweetheart.
I'm glad you did.
see you tomorrow.
I love you.
I love you.
if you're looking for your mom, she's... -She's in court, divorcing my dad.
I know that I haven't been around that much.
no. You haven't.
I'm gonna try very hard to change that.
why don't you come with me?
on your job?
it's one night in Seattle. It's not a marriage proposal.
judge Lockhart.
has court adjourned?
just now. How are you?
Hey, I'm covering the Mariners game tomorrow, and spending the night in Seattle with you.
I'd say I'm pretty excited.
me too.
my buddy recommended a seafood restaurant right down on the water.
just me and you and a couple of very unlucky lobsters.
unless you don't like lobsters?
no. I love them.
can I call you back? - Yeah, of course.
may I help you?
you don't remember me, do you?
I lost the beard and cut my hair.
you're probably wondering why I'm here.
well, most people I sentence to prison don't come back to visit.
when were you released?
last year.
time off for good behavior. Can I, uh, come in?
Yes. Of course.
so how are things going for you? - Not good, actually.
I've been able to find work here and there in Seattle, but I can't land anything permanent, not if I'm honest on the job applications.
I'm sorry to hear that.
nobody trusts a guy with a record.
that must be frustrating, but I commend your efforts.
I don't need a pat on the back, judge.
what I need is a job.
I-I'll take anything... restaurant work, house-painting, landscaping...
you're asking me to find you a job?
they'll listen to you.
that day in court, you said if I worked hard and turned my life around, doors would open for me.
I remember that, and I stand by it.
okay, so I did what you said,
except the doors are still closed.
all I'm asking is for you to open one for me.
I'll see what I can do...
but ultimately, it's up to you.
I can't make people trust you, Lenny.
you have to earn that.
I will.
Really?
what?
do you remember Mrs. Hotchkiss from high school?
sure. Our dowdy old English teacher? What about her?
this is exactly the kind of dress she used to wear.
Oh, honey. You have got to loosen up.
stop putting so much pressure on yourself.
you're gonna have a nice little romantic getaway with a really great guy.
Hello?
Oh! Hi, Elaine.
thank you so much for getting back to me.
look, I was thinking you could use a hand at the market.
you're always so...
are you sure?
I understand.
how is it that news travels so fast around here?
Lenny Wilson committed his crimes in Cooperton.
he's not even from Cedar Cove.
doesn't matter. Folks don't want a convict on the payroll.
ex-convict. He served his sentence.
for burglary. - Second-degree burglary.
weren't there other convictions?
shoplifting, arson, vandalism?
probably even picked up a few more tricks of the trade while in the joint.
the "Joint"?
look, I called his parole officer.
he was a model prisoner.
even got his G. E.D. which is something I suggested.
very few people actually take that advice.
go. Go, go, go, go.
deep breath.
who is ready for Seattle?
she needs to find a different dress first.
not to mention a job for that felon.
how is Lenny ever gonna catch a break if people refer to him that way?
that's right. I heard you've been making calls on his behalf.
which I think is great.
if anybody understands the importance of a second chance, it's me...
thank you.
don't you two have a ferry to catch?
as a matter of fact, we do.
are you ready?
ready.
Hey! - Hey.
and remember, your dad will pick you up later, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay?
Oh, and please, don't let your dad leave a stack of dirty dishes for me to contend with.
it's enough that I have 50 loads of laundry to deal with when I get back.
okay, mom.
she'll be fine. Huh?
we'll see you later.
see you later, mom.
love you. - Love you.
so, how's it going?
that good, huh?
hey there!
dad! What're you doing here?
well, I stopped by the house, to hopefully speak to your mom, but she wasn't home.
she's in Seattle.
Oh. What for?
Jack got a freelance assignment covering the Mariners game, so.
she went with him?
he seems like a nice guy.
she really likes him.
well, it, uh, looks like you've settled in nicely here.
it's been a long time trying to figure out what it is that I wanted to do with my life, but...
feels like this is where I belong.
I wish I'd been around more.
to help you.
give you advice.
could've used it.
I'm not going to lie.
those first few years were tough.
I lost a brother...
and a father.
well, I'm back.
and I promise, you will never lose me again.
I hope not.
thank you.
so good to be back in the city again.
you want to go for a walk?
pioneer Square, Pike Place...
we could do that.
or we could just, oh, I don't know, we could stay right here.
or we can go out, too.
Hey, whatever makes you happy.
no. Let's stay here.
yeah? - Yeah.
what?
you're so beautiful.
Oh, it's just the stadium.
yeah? Jack Griffith.
Really?
Yeah, okay, I'll be right there.
Yeah. Bye.
the Mariners have called an early press conference.
I don't know why.
well, you'd better get going.
I am so sorry.
no, no, Jack. It's your job.
don't worry about me. I'll...
go window shopping.
well, hopefully, it'll be a very quick game.
Yeah. - Yeah.
looks lovely, honey.
Thanks.
I put some in the Birch Room, too.
the guests have a late check-in.
Oh! And, um, that couple from Portland was asking about boat rentals, so I recommended Burt Walker's place.
a born concierge.
Hey.
hey...
didn't you already do that this morning?
Oh. Yeah, but it's dusty again.
I like dusty.
I think you've done enough for the day.
what do you say I drive you home?
No!
I mean... um...
my... my friend, Anson, can pick me up.
no, I don't mind.
I'll get my car keys.
has she called you yet?
no... why would she call me?
to let you know how things are going.
I'm sure everything is going well.
well, maybe I should call and check in with her.
Charlotte! Don't you dare.
you'll embarrass her.
I've always embarrassed her. Why stop now?
may I help you? - Uh, yeah.
is this where people post stuff about work?
sometimes, but there's nothing up there right now.
are you new around here?
I used to live in Cooperton.
and they don't have any work for you there?
well, times are tough.
do you know anybody who's hiring?
afraid not.
Kay. Well, thanks, anyways.
Saturday night is date night, a night full of fun.
thank you for making us a part of your Saturday evening, wherever you may be...
on the way home from the movie, or at home, holding the hand of the one you love.
Hello?
I'm stuck.
what happened?
Aw, the Yankees came out strong, but our boys rallied.
now the game's gone into extra innings.
yay, Mariners!
yeah...
thing is, I could be awhile.
well, do what you have to do.
I'll be here waiting.
I like the sound of that.
Ah! Uh, I gotta go, okay? Bye-bye.
I can't believe you got vanilla.
so boring!
Vanilla's dependable.
never lets me down.
my dad wants me home.
wish I could sail away in one of these boats.
it's that bad?
I thought things would get better after the divorce, that at least the fighting would stop, but it's only gotten worse.
I mean, all they do is complain about each other, and how hard it is to deal with me and Eddie.
wish there was something I could do.
I know something I can do.
I'm asking Bob and Peggy if I can move in with them at the Thyme And Tide.
live there?
it's the only place I can breathe.
I guess you could try.
but for now, don't go getting your dad all angry at you...
and...
I don't want him angry at me, either.
alright.
I'll see you later.
see ya.
hey...
please, Jack...
it's not your fault the game went extra innings.
but seven?
you know? I mean...
okay, two, maybe three, but rarely do they go seven.
at least the Mariners clinched it.
Yeah, finally.
then I had to file my article, and traffic was a nightmare around the stadium.
truly, I get it.
who keeps a gorgeous woman like you waiting, though, huh?
who falls asleep waiting for such a handsome man?
we'll find another time.
you promise?
guaranteed.
I'll call you later.
okay.
I could run errands, handle maintenance...
I'm sorry. We... we just really don't need any help right now.
mom. Hi.
you're her mother?
Yes. I didn't know you were interested in art.
I'm not, but I am interested in finding a job.
I've been trying every place in town.
well, I'm back from Seattle, so let me see what I can do.
I appreciate that.
Thanks.
what was that all about?
he's the guy I heard about, isn't he?
the ex-con that you sentenced?
Yes.
I thought that you were on his side, trying to help him.
I am.
then what are you so worried about?
I wanted to believe in him...
give him the benefit of the doubt...
but when I saw him in the gallery alone with Justine,
I panicked.
I just wanted him outta there.
that's understandable.
I mean, he's got a lot of baggage in his history.
none of his crimes were violent.
that's true.
still, with his track record, a lot of people have a hard time letting go of that.
he had a difficult life.
I mean, a lot of his problems were self-inflicted, but...
growing up, he was bounced around from foster home to foster home.
the odds were set against him from the start.
hey... at least you're trying, right?
I, for one, commend you on your compassion.
it's very sexy.
Oh, yes.
very sexy. - Very sexy, huh?
let me show you how very sexy it is. - really?
buenos tardes, amigos! Hey!
hope you come by for lunch today.
the special is chimichangas.
did you fill that position that Justine left?
because, if you haven't, I know someone...
I know where you're going with this, judge, and it's really good karma, for sure, but I like to maintain a kinda...
a chill at my place, and I just can't have a dude like that harshing the vibe, you know?
I'm sorry, man.
harshing the vibe.
even Moon won't give the guy a break!
don't harsh the man's... What was it?
vibe. - Vibe.
where were we?
Oh. That's right.
Hey!
Ah! Look who brought the sunshine in.
are we busy today?
no busier than usual.
good.
do you think I can ask you and Bob something?
sure.
Bob? Allison's here!
Hello, young lady.
this is your lucky day.
I hope so, because I wanted to ask you guys something.
mom?
surprise!
I thought you were in Tacoma.
I was, but Bob and Peggy generously offered to let me stay here.
you know, all this bouncing around doesn't make sense.
not when we have a free room for her.
not free.
we agreed...
when I have a steady job, I'm paying you back.
so you're going to live here?
when it's not my turn with you and Eddie at the house, then I get to see you whenever you come to work.
isn't it great?
Yeah, that's awesome.
afternoon, Cliff.
Charlotte. What a nice surprise.
how goes it with your father's memorabilia collection?
well, selling like gangbusters.
and I have you to thank for that.
well, your father had so many fans.
it doesn't surprise me that people would jump at the chance to own something of his.
Hey, mom!
Olivia. - Hey, Cliff.
uh, you're not planning on doing any homerepairs yourself?
relax, mom.
I'm just checking to see if Hank has any job openings.
Oh. Olivia has taken it upon herself to find employment for a local ex-con.
right! I heard about that.
I heard he even asked for a job at the gallery with Justine.
is there some kind of briefing I'm unaware of?
a secret hotline to call and find out everybody's business?
no, but that's a wonderful idea.
I gotta run, mom.
nice to see you, Cliff. - You too.
wait! How'd it go in Seattle?
so, um, I updated the address book, and created a special group of former guests, so now you can send out mass e-mails, letting everyone know about upcoming specials or events in town.
that's great!
seriously. It's genius.
so, how you doing?
I'm good. I mean...
I... I just have a lot going on right now.
I'll... I'll show you how to access the group.
okay, wait.
let me write this down.
at first, he was fine with it.
he liked that I was volunteering for the P. T.A. the school, but when I wasn't at home, he didn't like it.
well, you can't win with people like that.
believe me, I've tried.
whatever I did, it wasn't right.
the good news is, you don't have to worry about what he thinks anymore.
do you mind if we finish this later?
no. Of course not. - Okay. Thanks.
would you like some tea?
Yes. - Great idea.
there's that look.
I'm worried about Allison.
this whole situation...
it can't be easy for her, Bob. - Honey...
it's gonna take time.
this is a big adjustment.
for all of them.
it's a beautiful day.
any day outside is beautiful.
I was just over at the hardware store.
now you see what I'm up against.
listen to me.
it's tough, it doesn't seem fair, but you've got to keep trying.
I still believe, if you work hard, eventually someone's gonna give you a break.
be patient. You're doing the right thing.
it doesn't matter.
you know, I've tried to do the right thing, play by the rules, but what's the point, if people just assume you're gonna break them?
come in.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Judge Lockhart.
Oh, Olivia, please.
what can I do for you?
that guy you're trying to help find work...
I got a place for him at my ranch.
I got fences that need maintaining, horses to be fed and watered.
there's a spare room for him, too, if he's interested.
I'm not sure he's got that kind of experience.
well, it's not rocket science.
just honest, hard work.
that's exactly what he needs.
thank you, Cliff.
okay.
was there something else?
you tell Grace I said hello.
I will.
it's been a long time since I had my own classroom.
permanent positions are hard to come by.
I guess I'll have to substitute-teach for now.
in the meantime, we'll have to rely on Zach for support.
it's not like I'm asking for anything unreasonable, but raising kids is expensive.
I know he resents it.
well, you just make sure that he holds up his end, and remind him that deadbeat dads get taken to court.
he's not a deadbeat!
this is hard on him, too!
you're taking sides with your father?
it's not all his fault. - Oh, it's my fault, then?
No! Mom, I don't care whose fault it is.
why can't you just stop fighting and just talk to each other?
wait! Where are you going?
anywhere but here! - Allison!
you know what? If Eddie and I are such a burden, let me get out of your way.
honey! Wait!
in here.
you ready to get your heartbeat up?
Absolutely.
cliff Harting says to say hello.
What'd he do, pass you a note in study hall?
he likes you.
of course he does. I am very likeable.
do you like him?
honestly, I haven't thought about that.
and don't you even think about giving me that "Judge" face.
excuse me?
you know exactly what I mean!
that "Oh, I know you're lying to me" expression.
well, he's a gentleman.
and he gets a gold star in my book.
cliff's the only person in Cedar Cove to give Lenny Wilson a break.
what do you...
he's working on Cliff's ranch.
grace! It's a good thing.
Yeah, for Lenny, maybe.
forget spin class. I've got a better idea.
what?
horseback riding.
so what's the game-plan here?
try to protect Cliff from the dangerous ex-convict?
no, I just want to make sure that everything's okay.
but I did bring along some mace in my purse, just in case.
he can protect himself.
Oh, I know that. It's just...
what?
deny it all you want. You like him.
ladies!
okay, just act natural.
Hi, Cliff. - Hey!
well, this is a nice surprise. - Yeah.
we had a sudden urge to go horseback riding, and you did say that we would be welcome anytime.
and you are, indeed.
I think Miss Anabelle here'd be a good match for you.
feisty, takes her time warming up, but once she does, she is all heart.
he's doing fine.
fast learner. Hard worker.
and the silverware's all accounted for.
I don't know what you mean. - Grace.
cliff, we're sorry to intrude.
I'm the one who insisted we come here, but it was out of concern.
for me?
for anyone that he's working for.
but things are going well?
no complaints.
meanwhile, seeing as you came all the way out here.
if you insist.
miss Anabelle! Look at you.
listen, you, you had better be nice to me, or I will show you feisty, remember that.
I'll go and saddle her up.
could you be any more obvious?
we should get going.
Why?
well, it's gonna be dark soon, it's getting cold.
Hey, we could go back to my place, but that's where my family is.
can't be as bad as my house.
you don't want to get into a "who's got the more messed-up family" contest with me, cause I got you beat every time.
can't we stay a little longer?
sure.
we should've attempted something simpler.
Oh, come on! Where's your sense of adventure?
we can't let a little chicken cacciatore defeat us.
this is so much better than Seattle.
taste.
alright.
Oh. That's good.
it's awful, isn't it?
am I under oath?
see? I'm a terrible cook!
I should just stick to the courtroom.
Yeah.
I happen to think you are amazing in the kitchen.
Yeah, I do.
tell them nobody's home.
tell them nobody's home.
don't do it. Don't...
Hello?
Hey, Troy. Yeah.
what?
great. That's all we need to know.
well, they managed to save most of it.
quick response.
what happened?
someone started a fire in the trash can.
how do you know it's intentional?
pergolas don't self-combust.
just have to figure out who would do something like this.
what, the guy who did time up at Coyote Ridge? Why would he do this?
no, I'm not saying that he did.
it's just that, well, folks around here haven't exactly welcomed him to Cedar Cove.
does he have a history of arson?
well, it was a long time ago, but just a misdemeanor.
you know where I can find him?
he's working at Cliff Harting's ranch.
Kay.
Hey, Cliff. - Sheriff.
what can I do for you?
I just came down to see Lenny.
I need to talk to him about something.
Hey, Lenny!
the sheriff wants a word.
sheriff.
listen. There was, um, trouble in town last night.
I'd just like to talk to you about it.
what kind of trouble?
somebody burnt down the pergola.
why would I do that?
I'm not saying you did, but, uh...
well, old habits die hard.
I don't do stuff like that anymore.
so where were you last night?
downtown for a little while after work. I got back around 10: 00.
I can't say I know when Lenny came home, but if you're asking me, you're barking up the wrong tree.
so what'd you go into town for?
to walk around. Is that a crime?
where in town?
well, nowhere near the park.
anybody see you "Nowhere near the park"?
no. Most people in town who see me coming look the other way.
look, sheriff. I've done my time.
I'm making a fresh start. Ask Judge Lockhart.
she'll tell you all about me.
I did.
she was the one who told me where to find you.
it's a shame.
I worked hard building this.
better part of a month.
Aw, it was beautiful work too, Bob.
and it will be again. Make it even better next time.
listen. You mind if I give you a hand?
Yeah, I'll put some of those woodworking lessons to good use.
Yeah. Sure.
you can be my apprentice.
alright. You got a deal.
you can be my Jedi Master.
Yeah, well, we can't let him win.
now, hopefully, Troy'll get enough evidence and lock him up.
make him think twice next time he wants to come back to this town.
you know, Bob, we don't know that Lenny Wilson did this.
don't you think we should maybe give him the benefit of the doubt for the time being?
Yeah, I suppose.
but you know the saying...
a leopard doesn't change its spots.
Hey, Stan.
this a bad time?
not at all. What can I do for you?
well, uh, as you know,
I've been spending more time with Justine.
it's still awkward for her, for both of us, but, hopefully, we can get to the relationship we should've had for all these years.
give it time. Be patient with her.
I'm so happy you're back in her life, Stan.
well, I'm working at it.
working on a lot of things, actually.
I've been seeing a therapist.
you have?
for about a month.
Wow. It's better late than never.
I know, you were after me for years to go, but you know me, I'm just...
I'm not good at confronting the problems in my life.
ignore them and they'll go away.
exactly.
except all the things that I...
should have dealt with a long time ago are still there, so...
it's time for me to untangle them.
I think it's great, Stan.
Thanks.
it just... It's nice to hear a positive response.
Why? Who's being negative?
well, some people believe that therapy only stirs up trouble.
like your wife?
I just want you to be happy, Stan.
did the sheriff arrest him?
no, not yet.
at least, I don't think so, but...
he's the prime suspect.
I don't like this, Anson.
I don't either.
don't worry.
I'll think of something.
I didn't do it!
I didn't set that fire.
I didn't say you did.
I've been minding my own business, busting my back at the ranch, and the minutethat there's trouble, you point your finger at me?
that's not true.
the sheriff wanted to question you, - I simply told him where you were. - I had nothing to do with it!
keep your voice down.
you told me to have faith in people, that I would get a second chance if I turned my life around, and I have!
Hey!
what's going on here? - It's okay, Jack.
it's not okay.
she thinks that I'm a criminal, just like the rest of you!
Lenny... listen to me.
you have to go.
now.
right.
I'm not your problem anymore.
he didn't do it.
how can you be so sure?
because I believe him.
I'm not sure what you're hoping we can find here that the sheriff and the arson investigator didn't.
I don't know.
anything.
you know, I interviewed every person that was either in or near the park that night, and there's just... there're no witnesses.
and yet the entire town is ready to lock up Lenny Wilson and throw away the key!
it was me.
I-I did it.
folks think that guy started the fire, but he didn't.
it was me.
what happened?
I was in the park... alone.
I wasn't in a hurry to go home, it's not exactly fun at my house.
i-it was cold, so I lit a small fire in the trash.
it got out of hand.
I tried to put it out with my jacket, but it spread really fast.
I panicked and ran away.
I did a stupid thing.
I'm sorry.
your recklessness has damaged something very dear to this town.
I know. I wish I could take it back.
you can't.
but you have taken responsibility for it, and I believe that your remorse is genuine.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sentencing you to one-year probation.
in addition, you will pay for the restoration of the pergola.
thank you, your honor.
I'm not finished yet.
you're also going to help rebuild it.
court adjourned.
Hey. Sorry.
took me awhile to sneak out.
my dad's been watching me like a hawk, along with everyone else in this town.
you okay?
no.
this is so messed up.
at least it's over.
no, it isn't.
I can't do this. I can't keep quiet. - Yes, you can!
we talked about this. We agreed. - I don't care.
I have to tell the truth. I have to tell them what really happened that night.
how you said we should leave, but I just couldn't handle going home.
you said lighting the fire was a stupid idea, but I wouldn't listen.
you tried to put it out, but I freaked.
I can't sit back and let you take the blame.
listen to me.
the last thing you need right now is your parents flipping out like you're some delinquent...
like they already think I am...
so everything's cool.
the judge just gave me probation.
it's gonna be okay.
don't worry.
that boy is a problem.
he's been a terrible influence on Allison.
I wouldn't go that far.
well, she's not seeing him again, that's for sure.
the kid made a mistake, but he is very good to Allison.
honey, I know this is a difficult time...
but you've been so wrapped up in your own problems with Zach, complaining and casting blame...
that you don't even notice
Allison hears everything.
she's in a lot of pain, Rosie.
we all need to be a little more mindful of that, and, as difficult as it may be,
I'm afraid you and Zach have got to start dealing with your issues with respect and in private, or you know what?
we're all going to lose her.
Lenny? Can I talk to you a second?
you were right.
there were a few moments that I doubted you.
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry about that.
but you proved yourself.
you've turned your life around.
for that... I'm really proud of you.
you should be proud, too.
judge Lockhart?
thank you.
alright, you make your cut...
right where I marked it here.
okay?
Yes, sir.
alright.
do you have much construction experience?
do legos count?
listen, I really like the website for the Thyme And Tide.
Allison told me you helped her design it.
Yeah, it was fun.
think you could, uh, make an online edition of The Chronicle?
are you, like, offering me a job?
well, that's, like, the idea.
listen, I need to bring the paper into this century, and, uh, well, you'd earn enough to pay for these repairs.
interested?
Yeah.
but...
why are you helping me?
look, Anson, you screwed up.
but...
everybody deserves a second chance.
keep at it. You're doing great.
Thanks.
Thanks, Grace, but after the week I've had,
I'm looking forward to a night at home.
you, too.
somebody called for take-out?
that would be me, and I ordered enough for two.
Oh. Is that an invitation?
depends.
did you turn off your phone?
radio silence.
tonight...
it is just you...
and me.
I definitely like the sound of that.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379.
$150!
What're you doing?
I am being strong bold, and confident.
will Jeffers, you are sold!
does your ex often call you like that?
we're just friends. Nothing more.
I'm at your house... Just wondering where you are.
after all these years, the lake was exactly the way I remembered it.
I'm glad you went.
well, thank you for coming with me.
made a big difference, having you there.
time helps you choose the memories you want to hold on to.
well, it's like this house.
I mean, everywhere I look, there's something that takes me back.
right over there,
Justine took her very first steps.
I remember that day.
she was standing by the couch, and I got up to answer the phone, and when I turned around, she was walking across the room.
I remember that day like it was yesterday.
that was the last day she ever crawled.
she was always in such a hurry to grow up.
and Jordan was perfectly content to take it slow.
by the time he took his first step,
Justine was running circles around him.
Oh!
you put a hole in my boat.
Oh, no!
alright, try it again.
why don't you do it and I'll just watch?
Oh, you're gonna get this.
okay...
thumb on the reel...
release the spool...
and elbows... in?
don't overthink it. Just cast it.
that was too much arm.
it's too much something.
Hey, at least it landed in the water this time.
and what do I do now?
now we wait.
fishing's about patience.
sometimes, it takes hours before you get a bite.
I got one!
or a few seconds. Okay! Okay.
if he's running, don't reel.
what does that mean?
okay, you're pulling too hard, you're gonna break the line.
it's gonna...
are you okay?
I'm fine!
okay, maybe that's enough for today.
are you kidding? That was amazing.
I almost got him. Let's go again.
alright.
telling me of a relationship that's now over, what she regrets.
Kelly, you can learn from your mistakes, and when your heart is ready to love again, love fully and with no hesitations.
you're listening to Delilah.
Whoa! What's your hurry, mister?
I'm catching a ferry.
I'm off to Seattle.
for how long?
at least a couple weeks.
I'm consulting on a new energy startup.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
I'm happy to hear you're gonna be around for a while, so I can take you out for that dinner I owe you.
no.
you saved me from looking like a complete loser at that bachelor auction.
I will take you to dinner.
fine. When and where?
captain's Galley.
tonight. 8: 00?
I was kidding.
seriously! You do not need to take me out for dinner.
I know how busy you are.
Oh, I want to.
Plus, I need you to catch me up on all the town's gossip.
see you later tonight. - Okay.
well...
Hey!
I called you. You didn't return.
Yeah, I've been a little busy.
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry, and explain to you that...
I know that you were with Stan last night.
okay? I was worried about you.
I drove by the house and I saw you together.
it wasn't like that.
Stan came by to bring me a birthday present...
my son's model boat.
he had saved it all these years.
so, we decided to go down to Starkwater Lake.
Stan hadn't been back... - You don't have to explain.
Yes, I do.
it was a very emotional experience for both of us.
as parents.
there is nothing between me and Stan.
there hasn't been for years.
you and Stan, you have history.
that's something that you and I haven't established yet, and I can't even begin to compete with that, Olivia, and I really don't even want to try.
all Stan and I have are memories.
he's remarried, and I am so lucky to have found you.
so what do you say?
are we still going steady?
well, I don't know.
let's get together after school and we can talk about it at the malt shop.
alright, you're looking good.
nice and slow.
alright, you're coming in a little fast. Reverse.
that's good. Good.
now easy to port.
that's the right side? - No, left.
why don't you just say that?
it's okay, you're doing fine.
you're doing fine.
good. Now... Take it out of gear.
how was that?
it was perfect.
didn't even bang into the dock this time. Much.
I gotta say, I am loving this boat.
the boat's loving you.
Hey! Hey, hey. Cliff!
Hey! I didn't... I didn't see you there. How are you?
Olivia told me what she had planned at the bachelor auction.
I am so sorry.
I went and ruined everything by bidding on her brother.
her married brother, by the way.
if I had known what you two were up to, I would...
no. No worries.
no, and then I went looking for you, because I wanted to explain the whole thing, but...
grace. It's not a problem so whatcha doing?
well, it's a...
a little business idea I got going.
is this yours here? - Yeah.
join a professional guide for a horseback trail ride along the beach shore.
Oh, that sounds wonderful.
you know what you should do is, uh, talk to Jack, maybe take an ad out in "The Chronicle."
you know what? Maybe I will.
Yeah.
I would love to go on one of these rides.
well, you know what? You're in luck.
I know the owner.
and I think Miss Annabelle's been missing you.
Really?
and just how would you know that?
she gets a little forlorn.
well, give her my best and tell her
I am really looking forward to that ride on the beach.
Really? - Yeah.
how's Wednesday?
I-I'll bring the sandwiches.
okay.
I'll see you then. - Yeah.
you want to build a boat?
Yes. Why not?
how many reasons do you need?
you don't go from a birdhouse to a picture frame to a boat.
that's like skipping a hundred steps.
how about bookshelves?
how hard can it be, Bob?
I can figure this out, I know it.
look, I live in a cove. I could use a boat.
then buy one. Try ebay.
why would I do that?
I am perfectly capable of building this.
remember our last outing?
clearly, I'm made to be on the water, Bob.
I would tell you, get comfortable on the island.
Oh, you of little faith.
I want to do this, Bob, okay?
I mean it, I want to build this boat.
far be it for me to stand in the way of impulsive, naive bravado.
thank you.
Oh, excuse me a sec. I'll be right back.
excuse me, John Bowman?
Hi. You're the new chef here, right?
I love what you've done with the menu here. - Thanks.
and-and I notice that your photographs are in the gallery all the time.
I'm next door at "The Chronicle."
my name's Jack Griffith.
you're a reporter? - Yeah.
well...I'm sort of the editor, photographer, journalist.
I'm like a one-man Swiss army knife.
listen, uh...
I would love to do an article about you and your many talents. What do you say?
are you up for an interview?
no. I don't think so.
no? - See you around.
nice talking...
okay. Ahem! Boat?
Wow! Look at you.
you must be really looking forward to this date.
it is not a date.
I'm going out for dinner with an old friend.
but, be honest, what...
what do you think about this dress?
does it look like I'm trying too hard?
no, I... - Oh, yes, it does!
and now I do have to go and change it.
you're right.
why are you so nervous? - I'm not nervous!
clearly.
well... I do have a date.
what?
you mean to tell me you finally have a date with John?
well, I had to buy him just to get the date, but, yes, we have a date.
I'm a little nervous.
Oh, sweetheart, don't be, just be yourself, and he will love you.
that means a lot, coming from my mother.
it is not just me. Everyone loves you.
I hear it every day.
Oh! I love that Maryellen, she's just like her wonderful mother.
Thanks. I think.
where are you going? Galley?
I suggested Remy's in Seattle.
that's very nice.
he suggested another place.
I love your place.
Thanks. Sorry it's such a mess.
no, it's great.
it's just I haven't had much time to unpack, what, with the gallery and work and everything.
I understand.
it takes a while to make a new place feel like home.
are you originally from Tacoma?
no.
where are you from?
I mean, where were you born?
new York.
new York? Ohh...
Wow. I love New York.
I always wanted to live there.
I like it better here.
so, what brought you so far west?
change of pace.
well, there are certainly plenty of photo opportunities out here.
it's true. Everywhere you look.
mountains, water...
islands.
it's like an endless canvas.
sorry. I didn't mean to...
no, it's fine. It's just a mess, like I said.
so come, take a seat.
dinner's almost ready.
so I come home, and they've knocked down the wrong wall.
what?
I mean, really?
did they actually think that we wanted a 500-square-foot bathroom?
I could never build a house. Way too many decisions to make.
I can barely pick the right color for my guest towels.
but how satisfying! Look at you. You have your dream home.
sure.
I was fine with the way the house was in the first place.
I guess when you don't have kids to put through school, you find stupid ways to spend your money.
do you regret that?
not having kids? - Yeah.
I don't know.
georgia never wanted to have kids, so...
I never pushed it.
thank you. That was great.
I guess your kids are all grown-up now?
Oh, yes, they are.
it doesn't matter how old they get, they're still my babies.
I guess you heard about me and Dan, huh?
I did.
a lot of years together.
what happened?
I get asked that all the time, but there's really no simple answer.
we were kids when we got married.
too naive to recognize how different we were and naive enough to think it wouldn't matter, but those differences caught up with us.
this one night,
I brought home travel brochures.
I wanted to talk about going on a nice little romantic getaway.
I mean, I wanted to try something, anything, to get that spark back.
you know what he said?
you're blocking the TV.
next day, he calls me from work and said he wasn't coming home.
he wanted a divorce.
I'm so sorry, Grace.
the guy's a fool.
thank you.
but, hey, I got two beautiful daughters out of this deal, so I have no regrets.
don't worry. You're gonna find someone else.
you're a beautiful woman.
I mean, a catch and a half.
Yes, yes, I tell myself that every morning in the mirror, but believing it is a whole other thing.
you know, I might've had a... ahem...
a little crush on you in high school.
Oh, get out. - Seriously.
well, that's funny, because I had a crush on you, too.
I know.
what?
Olivia told me.
so then why didn't you do something about it?
you were with Dan, the... - So?
star of the basketball team.
he towered over me!
I was just a little geek in the science club.
what was I gonna do?
anyway.
that was a long time ago.
Yes.
another lifetime.
I could get used to this.
pretty sweet, huh?
that thing you were saying about freedom, about only having two ropes keeping you from wherever you want to go?
I think I'm starting to get it.
well, good, cause I got an idea.
why don't you stay?
like, for good.
you mean move in? - Yeah.
give it a try. See how it feels.
look, I just thought things have been going so well.
things have been great.
and you are saying you love the boat.
I do, I just...
I don't know if I could live here.
I mean, it's so small, and the constant motion...
it might get to me.
well, no pressure.
just think about it, okay?
okay.
this is almost ready.
Yeah, first thing I ever built Peggy was a table.
she loved it.
Bob. I'm building a boat...
and that's all there is to it.
listen, uh...
you knew Olivia back when she was married to Stan, right?
I did.
were they a happy couple?
Yeah.
until... you know.
then it all fell apart.
biggest mistake Stan ever made was leaving her.
then again, it was another time.
dad wants to take me to Starkwater Lake.
he wrote me this long email.
are you going to go?
I think it's a bit late for that particular father-daughter moment.
I needed him to take me back there years ago.
now I can go myself.
it's taken him a lot longer to get to where we are.
at least he's trying to be a good father.
he wants to be a good father now that I'm grown-up.
there're just so many changes in my life right now.
what do you mean?
Seth asked me to move in with him.
I know! It's crazy.
can you imagine me living on a boat?
Wow.
that's a really big step in a relationship.
you don't think I should do it?
I didn't say that.
you don't have to, it's written all over your face.
here's what I think.
when you make a decision like that,
how was your date?
I didn't even hear you come in.
you're like a ninja.
Ninja-librarian! She fights late fees by day, crime at night.
you are so weird.
so?
don't keep me waiting.
how was it?
it was okay.
he made me this amazing dinner. - Ooh! And...?
it felt like he was finally opening up to me a little.
well, that's a good sign.
Yeah, it was...
okay. What happened?
well, he had all these boxes lying around.
I-I... accidentally opened one...
you were snooping? - No, I wasn't.
but I couldn't help but notice it was full of all these unopened letters.
unopened?
they were addressed to some guy named "Kirkland."
okay, letters in a box, that's odd.
what do you think it means, Nancy Drew?
maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just...
feel like there's something he's not telling me.
it takes time for some people to open up.
just go slow with this guy and don't get too involved until you know who he really is.
I just want to jump into one of his pictures and find out everything about him.
and you say I'm weird?
seriously, Maryellen, just trust your instincts, but go slow.
might be faster if you just wrote a letter and mailed it.
I am getting good at this.
hashtag L-O-L.
Hey, I spotted coho a couple of miles off the point.
wanna go out and catch dinner again?
not right now.
I've been thinking...
about us moving in together.
you're starting to come around, aren't you?
maybe.
that's great!
before you get too excited...
I have another idea.
how about you move in with me?
I know you love living on the boat...
okay.
okay? - Yeah. Let's do it.
okay! - Let's do it!
this is gonna be great.
okay.
here it is.
Really? You're going to build that?
well, don't sound so surprised!
I'm not. It just seems a bit ambitious.
why a canoe?
so I can take you out onto the water, that's why.
you know, find a secluded cove, build you a romantic fire on the beach.
that's why. - We can do all that without you building a boat.
Oh, come on, where's the fun in that?
actually, I do know a few secluded beaches I could take you to.
Oh, good. I'll build faster.
I like how decisive and strong-willed you are.
was that code for "impulsive and stubborn"?
you've had a couple of woodworking lessons and you've decided to build a boat.
that is not stubborn.
that is determined, and dare I say, courageous.
my misunderstanding. - Yeah.
I have to go to court.
come on, they can start without you.
it doesn't work that way!
doesn't? - No.
fine.
fine.
meet me for dinner later?
sounds wonderful.
Oh, you should really consider wearing that robe.
it's very sexy.
I'll have to think about that.
all those years, I avoided coming back here.
I thought I'd completely fall apart.
I had to come back.
I didn't want to forget him.
his face.
the sound of his voice.
he loved this place.
I'm glad your mom brought me out here.
she was so great. So strong.
she is.
but there were some dark days.
years.
she seems like she's in a...
in a really good place right now.
and Jack seems like a nice guy.
is that why you wanted to see me?
to ask me about Jack?
no, of course not, sweetheart.
I'm back here for you, and that's the truth.
I want to be a part of your life again.
and what about mom?
I just want both of you to be happy.
we are but it took us a long time to get here, and it wasn't easy.
and I should've been here. I know that now.
I'm sorry.
I just hope you'll give me another chance.
you've always been my dad.
it beats...
another...
frozen...
meal.
don't worry. I'll get it.
did you know he was coming?
John. Hi.
What're you doing here?
I'm headed out to the Quinault Rain Forest tomorrow.
that's great.
I can't wait to see what you come back with.
I was wondering if you want to come with me.
Really?
y-you want to take me on one of your shoots?
it's my favorite place.
I thought maybe you'd like it, too.
Wow. Uh...
this is, um...
I don't know what to say.
how about "Yes"?
how about "Yes"?
Yes.
that sounds great.
that's all you brought?
I figure if I can't fit my whole life in one bag, it's getting too complicated.
Wow. You know, every time I'm in this place,
I can't get over how massive it is, the size of it.
it's tiny.
compared to my boat, it's a mansion.
this is gonna be great.
my favorite spot.
hey... you're on my side of the bed.
all this space, and you want to fight over sides?
you're crazy, you know that?
Yes, I do.
will! What are you doing here?
I was in your neck of the woods and thought I would drop in.
is everything okay?
do you have a minute?
I just wanted to... - Yes! Of course.
please, come on in.
Oh, man... this is harder than I thought.
I'm usually the one that's never at a loss for words.
Oh, that's okay.
my marriage is over.
I moved out a few weeks ago.
and no one knows. Just, uh, me and Georgia.
truth is, it's been on rocky ground for a few years now, and...
boy. That sounds familiar.
well, yeah. That's...
that's why I thought you might understand.
well, I'm sorry.
please, keep this to yourself.
I'm not ready to tell Olivia yet, and it would break my mother's heart.
of course, you have my word.
I've always been the one with the rock-solid marriage, the perfect son married to the perfect wife.
but these last few years...
Oh. Just hang on a second.
excuse me.
Hello?
Hey! I got a bit of a problem here.
miss Annabelle's developed thrush on her right hind frog.
on her frog?
that's part of the hoof.
anyway, I'm thinking about saddling up nero for you.
he's got a bit more spirit, but you can handle him.
you okay with that?
uh... actually, um...
something's come up.
are you okay if we reschedule?
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
well, how about the weekend? You know, Saturday or Sunday?
Yeah. No problem.
I'm sorry.
Ah, don't worry about it.
and you know what?
maybe Miss Annabelle's "frog" will be better by then.
Absolutely.
alright. I'll call you tonight, okay?
sure.
Oh... wow.
pretty breathtaking, huh?
it's like this peace just washes over you.
Yeah, I love out in here.
just being alone...
away from everybody.
but you're not alone.
you brought me.
you're different, Maryellen.
what do you mean by that?
well, in case you haven't noticed by this point,
I'm a loner.
pretty tough to let people into my life.
I have trust issues, I guess.
but when I'm with you...
I haven't felt this way about anyone for a really long time.
what way?
join a professional guide for a horseback trail ride along the beach shore.
it's kind of wordy.
well, I need people to know what I'm offering.
how about "Horseback rides on the beach"?
much better.
okay. Just give me your contact info here, and I will get this in next week's edition.
I think it's a great idea you have.
Yeah, well, hopefully, the tourists do as well.
I heard Olivia and Grace had a great time that day, going for a ride with you.
well, Olivia's a natural.
has Grace been back since?
one time, but it was just to check up on Lenny Wilson.
Oh, I thought that, uh, you and Grace were...
Yeah, I did, too, but, um,
I think she might be interested in someone else.
Really? I, uh, I didn't know that.
Yeah, some guy from way back when.
did she tell you this? - She didn't have to.
when two people have that kind of history, it's tough to compete with.
my experience?
when it feels like there's still something there, well, usually, there is.
well, I'll get this in the paper right away.
okay.
Thanks.
Yeah. You bet.
come in.
hello again.
Hi!
I've seen you more in the last few weeks than I've seen you in the last five years.
are those for me?
Yes, they are.
I wanted to say thank you.
I've been feeling happier and healthier than I have in years, and a big part of that is because of you, because of your support.
I'm just glad you're finally open to getting help.
and I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me.
you've been really great to me, Olivia.
you've taken time away from...
well, you have a whole new life now, and you're happy, and I'm happy for you.
thank you.
anyway, I'm gonna stay at the Thyme And Tide tonight, and then head home in the morning, so...
well, I hope you'll come back often.
I know it's been so nice for Justine.
she is so happy to have her dad back in her life.
Yeah, and I will always be there for her.
I promise.
well, I, uh, I should go.
you take care.
you too.
grace! I stopped by the library, you weren't there yet.
no. I was doing a bit of work from home.
want to get together tonight?
you know what? I would love to, but I can't.
previous plans.
what's up? Everything okay?
Stan dropped by to see me again.
well, he's been doing that a lot.
brought me flowers.
he wanted to say thank you for being there for him.
Stan is your past, Jack is your future.
I know.
you know, for so many years, my life was just about getting through the day.
now, with Jack, I have something to look forward to.
Oh... hey.
you look exhausted.
you didn't sleep at all last night.
I couldn't get comfortable.
was it my bed?
no. No, the bed's fine.
it's, um...
you're gonna think this is really stupid...
I haven't slept on land in a long time.
you kind of get used to the motion of the water.
give it time.
I'll get used to it.
thank you.
I had a great time.
Yeah. Me too.
so what happens now?
what happens now is I'll call you.
if that's alright?
I'd like that.
Oh! Hey, John Bowman.
thought any more about that interview?
answer's still no.
okay, fine.
I was just thinking you might want some... - Look, I said no!
okay. Take it easy.
just leave me alone.
Thanks.
I'm so sorry I am late. - it's OK
I was just closing up when this person came in, wanting this specific book...
thank you. Of course, did not know the author or the title, just that it was about a murder somewhere a rooming house, somewhere in Europe...
sounds interesting.
Yeah, well, I guess they thought so.
would you like a drink?
Yes, please. - Let me get the waiter.
good evening. Fire Water Grill, Tacoma.
Hi. Could I please speak to the manager?
one moment, please.
Doug speaking. How can I help you?
Hi.
I was actually calling about a chef who used to work there.
what about him?
I was just wondering, why was he let go?
he lied on his application.
what did he lie about?
you should ask him.
Wow. What is with you?
if you could do anything tonight, what would it be?
you asked the question!
I heard on the news that the Phillies were in Seattle tonight.
they said it was a pretty big deal.
Yeah.
they're in separate leagues, so they only play each other one game maybe every four years.
that's just what they said.
are you saying that we can skip dinner out and watch the game on TV?
better than that! I got two tickets!
these are box seats.
that's good, right?
these are the best seats in the house, Olivia.
how did you get these?
Oh, I know a guy who knows a guy.
Oh! You are incredible!
Wow! Now I just have to figure out who I'm gonna take.
I can't believe you did this.
you are amazing.
we need to get going.
we're going to the game!
thanks for saving me from another boring dinner alone.
well, I could say the same thing.
I was about to reheat my leftovers again.
listen to me.
whatever happens, no matter how tough things get, everything always works out in the end.
you're a great friend.
Yes, I am.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
what just happened?
I don't know, but I have to... I have to go. Have to go.
this... was a very special night.
because the Phillies won?
because I was with you...
and the Phillies won, yes.
how did this happen?
what?
how did I get to be so lucky?
how did I find you?
we found each other.
I'm not used to things working out.
I haven't been this happy in a long time.
me too.
and I think I'm falling in love with you.
you are?
Yeah.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379.
I can't stop thinking about you. - You are a married man.
you seem familiar with his work. - Yes. I'm... I'm a big fan.
I know that you want to see if Olivia will take you back.
and you're gonna go to Philadelphia? - Yeah. Just for a couple of days.
but what if he offers you the job?
Hey. - Hey!
there he is.
so? Talk to me. How'd it go?
it went...

I owe you.
Yes, you do!
and you can start with, uh, season tickets,
third-base line, behind the dugout.
so when do you start?
what? What's the problem?
I told them that I need to think it over.
this is your dream job.
Yeah.
but it's also a full-Time job.
so?
so... I would have to move back here.
Jack, you're currently living in a town That's not even on the map.
you're writing stories about bake sales And community theater productions.
I mean... dude.
this isn't just any big city sports-Writing gig.
this... this is the Phillies.
I know. - You know?
okay, well, if you know, Then what's holding you back?
Hey, Stan. What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
okay.
I know Melanie came to see you.
Yeah, I think she's gotten the wrong idea about us.
Yeah, well. She's always felt threatened by you.
I'm sorry, Stan, really.
Oh, don't be.
it's not your problem.
it's hers. Or ours.
which is why I've made a decision, I'm moving out.
I'm ready for a new beginning.
moving out?
what are you talking about? A divorce?
contacted my lawyer to start the process.
so you're gonna run out on her now?
Oh, come on, Olivia.
I've tried to make it work. You know I have.
but she won't accept me spending time here, Not even with Justine.
I can't go on like that.
would you move back to Cedar Cove?
it doesn't have to be Cedar Cove. I could move to Lakewood,
or Cooperton.
you don't think me moving here is a good idea.
I didn't say that.
you didn't have to.
we were married a long time. I can see it in your eyes.
your moving back impacts more than just Justine.
I know.
and I won't do it, if you don't want me to.
I'm staying at the Thyme and Tide for now.
I won't make any decisions Until you've had a chance to think it over.
she was John's mother?
I don't know. I think so.
her email address said "Kirkland,"
which was the name I saw On all those unopened letters in his apartment.
you think his real name is Kirkland, And he changed it to Bowman?
why would he do that?
that's what I wanted to find out, But he wouldn't tell me.
so what're you going to do?
I'm going to have to find out on my own.
he's not going to like that.
Oh, probably not,
but I need to know his story.
I've had enough of the mystery.
well, when you're done,
maybe you can help me unravel a mystery of my own.
still no word from Seth? - Nothing.
he probably just took that fishing job up in Alaska.
I called the fishery.
he never showed up.
maybe he got a better offer from another company.
then where's his boat?
if he took a fishing job in Alaska, His boat would still be at the marina,
and it's gone.
I have no idea where he went.
I will always take a chance.
the alternative is not living a full life.
so, take the chances And the opportunities put in front of you.
you're listening to Delilah.
that would be me.
welcome home.
how was Philadelphia?
loud, crowded and in a big, big rush.
Hey. I got you something.
does that mean you got the job?
No! No. Just something from the airport.
Oh, how romantic.
here. - How was the interview?
Oh, I think it went well.
they seem to really, really like me.
good.
don't keep me in suspense. Did you get the job or not?
I don't know.
I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see.
are you okay? - Yeah, yeah.
come on. Let me take you to lunch.
that sounds great.
why are you going to Tacoma?
I need to talk to the manager Of the restaurant John used to work at.
Yeah, but I thought you already did that. - On the phone.
but maybe I can pull more out of him If I go see him face-to-face.
mm, I don't think I like this.
I'll be fine.
drink your tea. It's calming.
I am very calm, thank you.
come here. You do not need to worry about me, okay?
I can't help it. You haven't been yourself lately.
I'm just tired.
he's not still texting you, is he?
when is this guy going to leave town?
in a few days. - Good.
just hang in there and ignore the texts, Then he'll be gone,
and you never have to think about Will Jeffers again.
I've been torturing myself, Wondering if he's been lying to me,
or he's been lying to Olivia, And then I realized it doesn't matter, - Because either way, he is a liar. - Exactly.
and he doesn't deserve any more of your time.
just wait it out, And soon, everything will be back to normal. You'll see.
you need to lay down a coat of liquid epoxy
to seal the wood and fill in the cracks.
Bob, what are you talking about? I already did that. Look.
you're gonna have to do it again.
there's cracks showing. Right here.
where? - Right there.
you need a solid ship, Jack,
or there's no sense putting 'er in the water.
the sea has a way of finding your mistakes.
Argh. Fine.
so what's the rush anyway?
I mean, it's obvious you're in a big hurry to build this canoe.
is there someplace else you've got to be?
now, why would you be asking me that?
Oh, I don't know.
word on the street has it You went to Philly for a job interview.
word on the street"?
Charlotte. - Ahh.
how'd it go?
come on!
good.
they offered it to you, didn't they?
are you gonna take it?
you know, Bob, there was a time in my life
when I wouldn't have thought twice about it,
but, um...
I lost everything once,
and I'm just not gonna let that happen again.
I hear you.
I've been there.
priorities, right?
priorities.
I'm just not going to let work come before my sobriety
and everything else in my life.
and by "everything else" you mean Olivia?
I finally got a voice-Mail from Seth today.
that's good. What'd he say?
not much.
just that he was sorry
