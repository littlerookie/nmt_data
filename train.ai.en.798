everyone loves a rebel, Harry.
scratch that last.
speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel?
proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention...
at worst, a psychotic death wish?
Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.
since the World Cup, the Ministry's been intercepting more and more owls...
and she 's too easily recognized.
we need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.
meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1: 00 this Saturday night.
and make sure you 're alone.
Sirius.
P. S.
the bird bites.
Sirius?
Harry Potter, age 12...
suspect entrant in the Triwizard Tournament.
his eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past...
and choking back tears...
Sirius. How-?
I don ' t have much time, so let me get straight to it.
did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?
No!
I had to ask.
now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.
but who was the third man in the room?
I don't know. -You didn't hear a name?
no.
Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
and what was that?
he wanted me.
I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me.
but, I mean, it was only a dream, right?
Yes.
it's just a dream.
look, Harry.
the Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet...
these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.
what are you saying?
I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff?
he was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater.
then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban.
you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet...
but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
I'm not ready for this, Sirius. -You don't have a choice.
someone's coming. -Keep your friends close, Harry.
who were you talking to?
what? Who says I was talking to anyone? -I heard voices.
maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time.
you're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect.
amazing.
amazing! -Neville. You're doing it again.
right, sorry.
magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs?
moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
it's already been through enough people.
why don't you just go and talk to him yourself?
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.
what do you want me to say again?
go.
ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him...
that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you.
is that right? Well, you
what?
are you sure you won't do this? -Do it.
Dean was told by Parvati that...
please don't ask me to say it again.
Hagrid's looking for you.
well, you can tell Ronald -I'm not an owl!
did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you?
Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going?
you'll see soon enough.
now pay attention, this is important.
what's with the flower?
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?
as a matter of fact, I have.
you might like to try the same thing now and again.
Hagrid?
the cloak! Put the cloak on!
Olympe. -Oh, Hagrid.
I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps...
you had forgotten me.
couldn't forget you, Olympe.
what is it you wanted to show me?
when we spoke earlier, you sounded so exhilarated.
you'll be glad you came. Trust me.
can we get closer?
dragons?
that's the first task?
you're joking. -Come on, Harry.
these are seriously misunderstood creatures.
Oh, crikey!
although, I have to admit, that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.
poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know.
Ron was here? -Oh, sure.
his brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania.
didn't Ron tell you that?
no, he didn't.
he didn't tell me a thing.
you cheat, Potter. -You stink, Potter.
good luck, Potter. -Potter stinks!
Cedric rules. -Thanks.
like the badge?
excuse me.
Harry.
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!
can I have a word?
all right. -You stink, Potter!
Potter, you stink! -Harry Potter smells!
dragons. That's the first task.
they've got one for each of us. -Come on, Ced!
are you serious?
and Fleur and Krum, do they-?
Yes. -Come on, Ced, leave him.
right. -He's not worth it.
read the badges, Potter! -Hey, listen. About the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them, but-Don't worry about it.
it's not like I try to blow things up, exactly.
it just happens a fair bit.
you have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating.
you're a right foul git, you know that?
you think so? -I know so.
anything else?
Yeah. Stay away from me. -Fine.
there's Potter. Cheat. -Why so tense, Potter?
my father and I have a bet, you see.
I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament.
he disagrees. He thinks you won't last five.
I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy.
he's vile and cruel. And you're just pathetic.
pathetic? -Oh, no, you don't, sonny!
I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned!
you stinking, cowardly, scummy...
professor Moody! -...Back-shooting
what are you doing? -Teaching.
ls that a-? Is that a student? -Technically, it's a ferret.
stand still! Stand still!
my father will hear about this! -ls that a threat?
professor Moody! -ls that a threat?
professor!
I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair!
Alastor! Alastor. -lt doesn't end here!
we never use transfiguration as a punishment!
surely Dumbledore told you that.
he might've mentioned it. -Well, you will do well to remember it.
away!
you. Come with me.
that's a Foe-Glass.
let me keep an eye on my enemies.
if I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me.
wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there.
you wouldn't believe it if I did.
now...
what are you going to do about your dragon?
well, you know, I just thought l'd...
sit.
listen to me, Potter.
your pal Diggory?
by your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time.
miss Delacour?
she's as much a fairy princess as I am.
as for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust...
but Karkaroff's is not.
they'll have a strategy.
and you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths.
come on, Potter.
what are your strengths?
I don't know.
well, I can fly. I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But l...
better than fair, the way I heard it. -But I'm not allowed a broom.
you're allowed a wand.
bets! Place your bets!
bets taken! Bets taken here!
step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath?
smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets?
Yes, sir?
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much.
your attention, please.
this is a great day for all of us.
each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger.
please keep your seats at all times.
this will minimize any risks you may be exposed to.
Harry? Is that you? -Yeah.
I'm sure we all wish our champions...
how are you feeling? Okay? -... The greatest of luck.
the key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to
battle a dragon.
young love.
how stirring.
if everything goes unfortunately today...
you two may even make the front page.
you have no business here.
this tent is for champions and friends.
no matter. We've got what we wanted.
good day, champions. Gather round, please.
now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived.
a moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
what are you doing here, Miss Granger?
sorry, I'll just go.
barty, the bag.
champions, in a circle around me.
miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.
and, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now...
miss Delacour, if you will.
the Welsh Green.
Mr. Krum.
the Chinese Fireball.
the Swedish Short-Snout.
which leaves... -The Horntail.
what's that, boy? -Nothing.
the Hungarian Horntail.
these represent four very real dragons...
each of which has been given a golden egg to protect.
your objective is simple:
collect the egg.
this you must do, for each egg contains a clue...
without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task.
any questions?
very well. Good luck, champions.
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!
three of our champions have now faced their dragons...
and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.
and now our fourth and final contestant.
Harry! Harry! Harry!
your wand, Harry! Your wand!
Yeah! -Yes!
Oh, my God.
Yeah! -Yeah! Well done, dragon!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, Harry! -Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.
or an arm. -Pack it in altogether?
Never! -Never!
shush!
go on, Harry. What's the clue?
who wants me to open it? -Yes!
do you want me to open it? -Yes!
what the bloody hell was that?
all right, everyone! Go back to your knitting.
this is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in.
I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.
caught on, have you? Took you long enough.
I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it.
everyone was saying it behind your back.
brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
least I warned you about the dragons. -Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
no, no, no, I did.
no, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you...
that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.
Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along.
I thought we'd be all right, you know after you'd figured that out.
Who-? Who could possibly figure that out?
that's completely mental.
Yeah. Isn't it?
I suppose I was a bit distraught.
boys.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
Cho, Harry's looking at you.
shush.
look at this!
I can't believe it! She's done it again.
miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl...
seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards.
her latest prey, sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.
no word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.
thank you, Nigel.
not now, Nigel. Later.
go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.
mum sent me a dress.
well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
nose down, Harry.
Ginny, these must be for you. -I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.
what are you on about?
they're not for Ginny.
they're for you.
dress robes. -Dress robes? For what?
the Yule Ball has been a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament...
since its inception.
on Christmas Eve night, we and our guests gather in the Great Hall for a night of well-mannered frivolity.
as representatives of the host school...
I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward.
and I mean this literally, because...
the Yule Ball is, first and foremost a dance.
Silence!
the house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly 10 centuries.
I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
try saying that five times fast, huh?
now, to dance is to let the body breathe.
inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers...
longing to burst forth and take flight.
something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.
inside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance.
Mr. Weasley. -Yes?
will you join me, please?
now, place your right hand on my waist.
where? -My waist.
and extend your arm.
Mr. Filch, if you please.
never gonna let him forget this, are you?
never. -Never.
everybody come together. Boys, on your feet!
why do they have to travel in packs?
how are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?
blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can?
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
I take after my mum.
though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3.
no, not the maternal sort, her.
broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad.
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser.
he laughed so hard at that.
very funny.
and then he died just when I started school, so...
so I sort of had to make me own way, as it were.
but enough of me. What about you?
this is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
well, us and Neville.
Yeah, but, then again, he can take himself.
it might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
now I'm really depressed.
get a move on or all the good ones will have gone.
who you going with, then?
Angelina? -What?
do you wanna go to the ball with me?
to the ball?
Yeah, all right.
Hermione.
you're a girl.
very well spotted.
come with one of us?
come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.
for a girl, it's just sad.
I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me!
and I said yes!
bloody hell.
she's lying, right?
if you say so.
look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it.
tonight, when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
agreed.
Cho! -Harry!
watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top.
okay, thanks.
Cho?
yes?
well, I just wondered if you
I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry...
I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.
and...
well, I've said I'll go with him.
okay. Yeah. Great.
fine. No problem.
okay. Good.
Harry?
I really am sorry.
it's all right, Ron.
it's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.
what happened to you?
he just asked Fleur Delacour out.
what? -What did she say?
no, of course.
she said yes? -Don't be silly.
there she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk.
I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out.
actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.
and what did you do then? -What else? I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
I always liked looking at them from behind.
she's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
bloody hell.
bloody hell.
bloody...
Oh, bloody...
what are those? What are those?
my dress robes. -Well, they're all right!
no lace. No dodgy little collar.
well, I expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
murder me, Harry.
leave it alone!
poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.
who? -Hermione, of course.
come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
Hello, boys. -Hello, boys.
don't you look dashing.
there you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
ready, professor? -To dance.
it's traditional that the three champions- Well, in this case, four.
are the first to dance.
surely I told you that. -No.
well, now you know.
as for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
Oh, there you are. -Come on, then.
come along this way.
Oh, come on.
Hi. -Now, I need you all to line up in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.
this way. This way. Come along.
she looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?
no. Absolutely not.
Hi!
Harry, take my waist.
what? -Now!
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a crazy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don 't care
can you dance like a Hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?
I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.
may I have your arm?
arm. Leg. I'm yours.
hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?
no, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
what's got your wand in a knot?
he's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
the enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph?
besides, the whole point of the tournament...
is international magical cooperation...
to make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no.
he's using you. -How dare you?!
besides, I can take care of myself. -I doubt it. He's way too old.
What?! What? That's what you think? -Yeah, that's what I think.
you know the solution then, don't you?
go on. -Next time there's a ball...
pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!
and not as a last resort.
well, that's- I mean, that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
where have you been?
never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
they get scary when they get older. -Ron, you spoiled everything!
what's this about?
no, don 't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
you all right, Harry?
I just got in.
me.
Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
the task is two days from now. -Really? I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.
actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.
I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
mostly, he watches me study.
it's a bit annoying, actually.
you are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you...
in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.
and...
I'm scared for you.
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve.
I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
Potter! -Cedric.
How-? How are you?
spectacular.
I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
exactly.
you know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath.
just take your egg...
and mull things over in the hot water.
I must be out of my mind.
I'm definitely out of my mind.
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
long time no see.
I was circling a blocked drain the other day...
and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.
not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?
that's what he did.
the other boy...
the handsome one...
Cedric.
well, go on. Open it.
come seek us Where our voices sound
we cannot sing Above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
Myrtle...
there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
very good.
it took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
come seek us where our voices sound.
the Black Lake, that's obvious.
an hour long you'll have to look.
again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.
"potentially problematic"?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?
look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
hate to break up the skull session.
professor McGonagall wants you in her office.
not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger.
but, sir, the second task is only hours away, and
exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now...
and could do with a good night's sleep.
go. Now!
Longbottom!
why don't you help Potter put his books back.
you know, if you're interested in plants...
you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense, but I really don't care about plants.
now, if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour...
then great. But otherwise
I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.
any bets? Any bets? -Come on, place your bets!
step up, mates! Don't be shy.
three lads. -One lady.
four go down. -But do four come up?
don't be so mean.
any bets? -Fleur's 10-1.
you're sure about this, Neville? -Absolutely.
for an hour? -Most likely.
most likely?
well, there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water
you're telling me this now? You must be joking!
I just wanted to help.
well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense, Harry. -Do l?
welcome to the second task.
last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.
a treasure of sorts.
these four treasures, one for each champion...
now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.
in order to win...
each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.
simple enough, except for this: -Put that in your mouth.
they will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.
after that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.
you may begin at the sound of the cannon.
what's the matter with him? -I don ' t know, I can ' t see him.
Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
what?
the Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour...
has unfortunately been forced to retire...
so she will take no further part in this task.
but she' s my friend too!
only one!
let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Harry!
he's all right.
he's all right. Barty!
go get him another towel. -I want all the judges over here now!
you saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.
my little sister.
thank you.
and you! You helped.
well, yeah, a bit.
Harry! -Hermione!
are you all right? You must be freezing.
personally, I think you behaved admirably.
I finished last, Hermione.
next to last. Fleur never got past.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
come on! Come on! -Attention!
attention!
the winner is Mr. Diggory...
who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm.
however, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first...
had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...
but the others as well, we've agreed to award him...
second place...
second place! -Well done!
for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
right on. -All that moral fiber, eh?
it's great. -Moral fiber?
blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.
Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. -Congratulations, Potter.
a fine achievement. -Thank you.
well done, boy.
see you at Hagrid's, Harry. -I'm sorry we haven't spoken.
after all, your story is one I've heard so many times.
quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course...
to lose one's family.
never whole again, are we?
still, life goes on...
and here we stand.
I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?
the last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!
and they say I'm mad.
now, I remember- I remember when I first met you all.
biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
suppose you remind me of meself a little.
and here we all are, four years later. -We're still a bunch of misfits.
well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
and Harry, of course.
soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
a man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action.
I will not.
in times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
then for once show them some!
the Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!
a true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.
what did you say to me? -Excuse me, gentlemen.
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
I can come back later, professor.
not necessary, Harry. The minister and l are done. I'll be back in a moment.
minister, after you.
there you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
but I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp.
professor?
professor. -Yeah.
igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this council.
should your testimony prove consequential council may be prepared to order your immediate release.
until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
do you accept these terms?
I do, sir. -And what do you wish to present?
I have names, sir.
there was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
rosier is dead. -He took a piece of me with him...
though, didn't he? -I didn't know.
lf that is all the witness has to offer-- -No, no, no.
there was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
he passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.
very well. Council will deliberate.
in the meantime, you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape?
as the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. -It's a lie!
today he's no more a Death Eater than I am. -Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence...
this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard about one more.
what's that? -The name.
yes? -I know for a fact...
this person took part in the capture...
and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse...
torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!
the name. Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch Junior.
hold him down!
get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
you are no son of mine.
curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.
it's a Pensieve.
very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
it allows me to see once more things I've already seen.
you see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something...
some small detail...
something I might have overlooked...
something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.
it's maddening.
sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it.
but he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming.
why do you ask? -It's just that l...
I had a dream about him.
it was in the summer, before school.
in the dream, I was in a house.
and Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human.
and Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son.
have there been others like this dream? - Yes.
always the same one.
sir, these dreams...
what I see, you don't think it' s actually happening, do you?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.
I think it's best if you simply cast them away.
it's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as l.
Potter!
what's your hurry?
congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am I correct?
Yes, sir.
ingenious.
a rather rare herb, gillyweed.
not something found in your everyday garden.
nor is this.
know what it is?
bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets.
the use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However...
should you ever steal from my personal stores again...
my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
I haven't stolen anything. -Don't lie to me.
gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...
I'm going to find out why!
Yeah! -Yeah!
Sonorus!
earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.
only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...
and Mr. Potter...
are tied for first position...
they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...
and Miss Delacour. -Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner!
I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.
should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task...
he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
in the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.
instead, you'll face something even more challenging.
you see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
but be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.
champions, prepare yourselves!
good luck.
my boy. -See you later, Dad.
on the count of three. One
fleur?
Fleur.
get down!
get down!
no, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric!
get off me! -He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Thanks. -No problem.
you know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.
for a moment, so did l.
some game, huh?
some game.
go!
go on, take it. You saved me, take it!
together. One, two... -Two...
three! -...Three!
you okay? -Yeah. You?
where are we?
I've been here before.
it's a Portkey.
Harry, the cup is a Portkey. -I've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!
what are you talking about?
Harry! What is it? -Get back to the cup!
who are you? What do you want? -Kill the spare.
No! Cedric!
do it! Now!
bone of the father...
unwillingly given.
flesh of the servant...
willingly sacrificed.
and blood of the enemy...
forcibly taken.
the Dark Lord shall rise again.
my wand, Wormtail.
hold out your arm.
master.
thank you, master.
the other arm, Wormtail.
welcome, my friends.
thirteen years it's been, and yet...
here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.
I confess myself disappointed.
not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
not even you...
Lucius.
my Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts
there were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.
I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways.
the face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence...
that is my true mask.
I returned.
out of fear, not loyalty.
still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail.
thank you, master.
thank you.
such a handsome boy. -Don't touch him!
Harry.
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
standing on the bones of my father. Yeah.
I'd introduce you...
but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
the boy who lived.
how lies have fed your legend, Harry.
shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago?
shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall l?
it was love.
you see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son...
she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch him.
it was old magic.
something I should have foreseen.
but no matter, no matter.
things have changed.
I can touch you now.
Yeah.
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
pick up your wand, Potter.
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
you've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?
first, we bow to each other.
come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?
I said, bow.
that's better. And now... -No.
attaboy, Harry.
your parents would be proud.
especially your filthy Muggle mother.
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
I'm going to destroy you.
after tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.
after tonight, if they speak of you...
they'll speak only of how you...
begged for death.
and l, being a merciful Lord...
obliged.
get up!
don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!
I want you to look at me when I kill you!
I want to see the light leave your eyes!
have it your way.
do nothing! He's mine to finish!
he's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.
we can linger for a moment to give you some time...
but only a moment. Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
take my body back to my father.
let go.
sweetheart, you're ready.
let go! Let go!
No!
he did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
for God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?
he's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back.
I couldn't leave him, not there.
it's all right, Harry. It's all right.
he's home. You both are.
keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.
the body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.
let me through.
let me through!
let me through!
that's my son!
that's my boy!
it's my boy!
come on. Get up. Easy, easy! -No.
this is not where you want to be right now. Come on.
No!
it's all right, I got you.
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
are you all right, Potter?
does it hurt? That?
not so much now.
perhaps I'd better take a look at it.
the cup was a Portkey.
someone had bewitched it.
what was it like?
what was he like? -Who?
the Dark Lord.
what was it like to stand in his presence?
I don't know.
it was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams...
into one of my nightmares.
were there others?
in the graveyard, were there others?
I...
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.
marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods...
if I hadn't suggested it?
do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater...
if I hadn't told him first myself?
did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
you bewitched Krum, but you- -But- But
you won because I made it so, Potter.
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
and now the deed is done.
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.
imagine how he will reward me when he learns...
that I have once and for all...
silenced the great Harry Potter.
Severus.
that's it, take it.
do you know who I am? -Albus Dumbledore.
are you Alastor Moody? Are you? -No.
is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
you all right, Alastor? -I'm sorry, Albus.
that's Moody. But then who's-?
Polyjuice Potion.
now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.
we'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty Crouch Junior.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your arm, Harry.
you know what this means, don't you?
he's back.
lord Voldemort has returned.
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.
send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. -Perhaps.
personally, I've never had much time for heroes.
today, we acknowledge...
a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...
exceptionally hard-working...
infinitely fair-minded...
and, most importantly...
a fierce, fierce friend.
now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.
you see...
Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort!
the Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.
but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.
now, the pain...
we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me...
and reminds us...
that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues...
our hearts beat as one.
in light of recent events...
the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever.
remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.
you remember that...
and we'll celebrate a boy who was...
kind and honest...
and brave and true, right to the very end.
I never liked these curtains.
set them on fire in my fourth year.
by accident, of course.
I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.
professor...
when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
priori Incantatem.
you saw your parents that night, didn't you?
they reappeared.
no spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.
dark and difficult times lie ahead.
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
but remember this:
you have friends here.
you're not alone.
Hermione.
this is for you.
write to me. Promise.
Bye.
Ron.
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
no. -No.
no, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Yes.
promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I won't. You know I won't.
Harry will, won't you? -Yeah. Every week.
he said, "Good morning," and asked, "How is your hand?"
it's... It's better.
what's left of it.
sorry.
we would like to speak with you if you feel well enough.
Yeah, that's all right.
coffee? - No, thank you.
tell us about this place you mention, in Slovakia.
it's this...
it's some kind of factory...
...where these people, these very rich people...
...they pay to torture and kill kids.
mostly backpackers.
and they killed two of my friends.
they take you from this hostel...
...and they bring you to this factory and...
I went there looking for Josh.
he was one of my friends and they took him there and...
and they...
they killed him.
it was horrible.
he asked how you survive.
I...
I escaped.
who organize this place?
I don't know. It's some kind of hunting club. They...
they all have the same tattoo.
it's a dog.
it's a bloodhound dog.
strange that you mention this tattoo.
Why?
because someone was found dead in a train station bathroom in Vienna...
...with this same bloodhound tattoo you describe.
security tapes from this station show him entering from a platform...
...where a train arrive earlier that day from Slovakia.
it came through the same station in Vienna.
you were on that tape.
did his tattoo look something like this?
what the fuck's going on?
help! Somebody help me!
Jesus.
you hungry?
it's 3:15 in the morning.
I have to take these with food. I wanna know if you want anything.
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.
when are you gonna tell Josh's mother what happened?
I'm not.
she still thinks her son's in Europe.
what the fuck am I supposed to tell her?
she'll go straight to the police. - Yeah, exactly. Someone should.
no, no one should. You don't get it. These people are tied into everyone.
somebody starts asking questions...
......They're gonna come after me and find me.
at my grandmother's house? I've been coming here since I was a kid.
I can barely find the place. I had to ask my sister for directions.
you told your sister we were here? - Yeah. So?
well, who else knows? - No one!
Jesus.
I'm doing this for your protection too. You know that, right?
Oh, Paxton...
look.
I took you back because I felt bad.
but you're going crazy.
you wake up every night screaming, and I can't sleep.
well, that won't be a problem anymore.
Paxton, that's not what l...
Oh, fuck.
morning!
Paxton?
Hey.
lorna?
lorna?
sorry. I was trying to be in the moment.
absorb.
do you think she ever saw a cock before this class?
if she did, it was in a Botticelli.
Oh, my God.
if I hear her talk about how emotional the Botticelllis are one more time...
...I swear to God, I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.
until Tuesday.
are you all packed for Prague?
jeans. No heels. - Awesome.
I can't do it on the cobblestone. I don't know how you do it.
I can teach you if you bring heels.
Axelle.
hands on your pencils, boys.
would he ever? - Excuse me, girls.
excuse me. Hi. - Hi.
may I see? - Oh, they're just rough.
show her. Don't be shy.
that's the one of you.
Oh, wow, that's beautiful. - Thanks.
how much would you want for it?
I wouldn't sell them. You can have this one.
Really? - Yeah.
Oh, my God, thank you so much. - You're welcome.
can I buy you a drink or something?
Oh, I'm actually late. We're catching a train to Prague, but...
I don't know. Maybe some other time. - Okay.
Yeah! Okay. - Okay.
I'll see you. - All right. Bye. Thanks.
no, Dad. It's Prague. We're gonna be fine.
it's not the Ukraine.
no.
no, Dad, do not book the Four Seasons.
book it, bitch. Book it. Please!
because, Dad, no college students are staying at the Four Seasons.
and, you know, it's for old people. So thank you, but please don't.
what?
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.
okay, love you. Bye.
Jesus, I hate that he calls every fucking five minutes.
all right, let's go. - Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.
who?
Yeah. - No.
Yeah. - No.
she cornered me in the apartment. She's homesick, crying.
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?
she's homesick for Baltimore? We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.
she's not that bad.
wow, is that a new journal you got there?
Yeah. It's a travel journal.
for emotional callbacks.
of course.
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink. You wanna go?
I'm okay. Thank you.
all right. Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.
knock yourself out, buddy.
see you later.
excuse you. Asshole.
she's like a 20-year-old grandmother.
whatever. She'll watch our stuff. She's happy there.
that's what she likes to do.
Oh, we didn't order these.
they're from girl.
whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.
Hey. What are you doing?
you inspired me to take a trip.
watch this.
you've got to be kidding me.
hello. What's your name?
do you know where we could score, like, party favors?
what do you need?
I don't know. Like, bud and ecstasy and, like...
PCP?
ice? Peyote? Crank?
okay, okay, bud and ecstasy are good.
sure.
we go back to my car. I got some.
yeah?
yeah? - Okay.
fuck. You know what?
I'm trying but I can't find them. Just hang on, yeah?
you want drink? - No, I'm fine.
Hey, you know what?
it's okay because we can just get it at the club when we go to Prague.
no, stay.
I find them. Okay?
you smell nice.
whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting. - Yeah, we have our friend.
you have friend? - Yeah.
one, two, three, perfetto. Otherwise, we have to take turns, huh?
you know, we're gonna go, so never mind.
where you go? I knew you were a tease, you fucking cunt.
what the fuck did you call me?
I called you stupid fucking American cunt!
fuck you! - You know what?
the train to fucking Prague is long, you bitch.
we'll come see you.
are you fucking insane?
what? I fucking hate that word.
Oh, "you stupid American cunt." I fucking lost my temper.
okay, but it's not like we're on campus and you can...
...call the dean and file a report or something.
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?
some guy took my iPod.
what?
is there, like, a police officer on the train or something?
Yeah. I'll go check. - Okay.
it had everything.
that's awful. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
here you go.
it's those fucking guys.
the fucking guys, the Italian guys from the room down the hall.
what do we do? - Just be quiet.
Hi. - Hi.
excuse me. Did one of you girls lose this?
Oh, my God!
how did you know this was mine?
I saw some guy run out of your room. He tried to take my bag.
I fought him off and this felled out of his pocket.
I'm a little worried he might come back looking for me.
well, do you wanna come in here and hang out with us?
Really? - Yeah, we have an extra seat.
Yeah, come in. - Totally.
thank you.
I think...
...we all need a little of this.
Oh, awesome.
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.
thank you.
as my father always says:
"Nazdrovia." To your health.
so are you going to Prague for the football match?
I kind of wanna go home.
Oh, I don't blame you. I got robbed twice on the overnight train.
there are so few safe places left in Europe.
so where are you going?
on a little spa vacation.
where?
slovakia.
wait, wasn't there, like, some war in Slovakia?
there hasn't been war in Slovakia for 50 years.
that's Bosnia, darling.
Oh, like you knew. - I did so.
what are the spas like there?
they're the best natural hot springs in the world.
I go twice a year. It's great to get away from the Italian guys.
they get to be a bit much.
wow, hot springs?
that sounds so therapeutic. I wanna go.
it's very easy. You just have to switch trains in Prague.
it could be nice.
you know? I had enough gross guys for one weekend.
okay, we'll go.
do you know of a good place to stay?
smart move with the shoes. - What? It's so easy. You have to try it.
Hi. Can I help you?
I need a room for my friends, please. - Yeah, cool.
your passports, please.
American. Good.
Yeah, cool. It's 10 Euros for night.
no. I got this one.
no. It's on me.
thank you. - Money.
Thanks.
here are your keys.
and this is a notice for the harvest fair tonight, girls.
will be sexy good times. Come on.
it's Dozinky. I know that. They have it every year.
Yeah. - Lots of music, dancing, costumes.
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?
it sounds kind of gay. - Excuse me.
Oh, we are so going to the harvest festival.
come on. This way. - Thank you.
you're welcome.
do you think they have any frescoes in the room?
wow, this room feels so timeless.
are you kidding right now?
Oh, my God!
sexy.
come here.
Yes! Yes!
Yeah!
that's what I'm talking about, huh?
Todd, what's up?
Yeah, nothing. We're just finishing up breakfast.
Really?
wow, I didn't think...
Jesus. You sure?
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now. I'll tell her I have to meet a client.
okay.
see you.
no respect for me. No respect for mother earth.
well, don't you have anything to say for yourself?
well, that's just fine. We can all ride home in silence.
gosh! This village is so enchanting.
Lorna, are you having a "journal-gasm" right now?
actually, yes. Multiple ones.
I get to write about how beautiful this village is...
...and I get to write about what a raving bitch you are.
she comes back swinging!
Well-played. - Thank you.
dollar!
dollar!
do you guys have a dollar?
I got it. - Oh, no, no, no.
no, no, no. I got it. I got it. Let me.
I have Smints.
would you like a Smint?
bitches!
welcome to Slovakia.
you both have corner suites with views of the river.
here are your pagers.
perfect. Thank you.
you ready to do this? - Yeah, I'm ready.
Really?
because you look like your dog just died.
I'm just jet-lagged, man. I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.
all right. - Thanks.
Oh, my God!
Hey, guys!
yes?
for the apartment.
awesome, dude.
those swords are like 1000 Euros.
trust me, she can afford it.
does she get, like, a really big allowance?
no, it's more like an inheritance.
her mom died when she was 12 and, like, left her everything.
and so she keeps her dad on an allowance.
Really? - Yeah.
she could pretty much buy Slovakia if she wanted to.
Yeah. It's pretty rad.
Yeah!
badass.
let me see this motherfucker.
you're up, bro.
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.
come on, man, sit down.
a tattoo's not really me. It's not my style.
I didn't know and I don't like needles. I don't like needles very much.
dude, what are you doing? Sit down.
here's the problem. Linda. What is she gonna say when she sees this?
my wife is not gonna really understand.
is there some other option?
everyone must get tattooed. Part of contract.
Yeah.
let's do it. Come on, man.
why don't you sit down? These guys aren't playing.
a tattoo is a little difficult to explain, Todd.
didn't seem like you had any problem explaining...
...the gonorrhea you brought back from Thailand.
can't believe you're bringing up the gonorrhea. Every time...
is there any problem here?
no, no. I just didn't know that this was part of it.
Stuart.
this is not like going to a whorehouse. You can't just back out.
get in the fucking chair.
Yeah.
come on, man. Look at this.
I'm fucking proud of mine.
look what I found!
okay, and before you say anything, it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...
...and those little kids right there made it.
Oh, my gosh, really? - Yeah.
I'm gonna go say thank you. - Okay.
they don't speak much English.
this is quite possibly the most alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.
come on, it's good for her. She needs it.
thank you.
well, cheers.
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!
come!
come on, Borat. Let's see what you got.
there they are.
three o'clock.
Jesus. - Right?
it's fucking crazy, huh? Dead ringer.
happy fucking birthday, bro.
dude, where you going? - In for a better look.
me?
Hi.
Hi.
would you like to dance with me?
no, thank you. I'm...
I'm not nearly drunk enough.
come on. I'll show you how.
no, really. It's easy.
no. Thank you, really, but my feet. I'm tired.
I could have helped you.
excuse me?
Hey.
Hey.
that guy make you some troubles?
no. He's fine.
what he say to you?
nothing. He just wanted to dance.
he won't bother you anymore.
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.
here. Take a drink.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Oh, I'm so sorry! - Don't worry about it.
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.
no, it's all right.
here, let me get you a drink. - No, you don't need to.
no, I insist. - No, no.
I insist.
Beth! Beth!
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to take me on a boat ride...
...and he's just so suave and he's amazing...
...and he doesn't speak English, but we understand each other.
Yeah. Just promise me you won't go on a boat ride with him, okay?
why not?
what's the big deal? You don't fancy him?
just because he's not "Whitney approved" or "Beth approved" looking?
no, I'm not saying that at all. I just want you to stay here where it's safe...
...we're all together, we don't get separated.
just promise me you won't go on a boat ride with him.
Lorna, promise me you won't go on a boat ride with him.
Beth. It's okay.
okay. You promise? - Okay, okay, okay.
okay.
Roman.
okay, two, please.
here you go. I'm so sorry about that. - It's okay.
Cheers. - Cheers. Thanks.
so, what brings you to this corner of the world?
her. Firestarter.
and you?
I honestly don't know.
I'm sorry, there's probably...
...a small army of Slovak boys all fighting over you.
why travel all this way just to talk with an ugly American?
you're not that ugly.
Really?
well, cheers to that.
Cheers.
Hey, your friend looks like she's having fun.
Yeah.
I get to listen to them have sex later.
can we switch? I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...
...It's probably been three centuries since anybody's had sex over there.
Oh, maybe your table's ready.
that's... That's a long story.
well, I'll have to hear about it another time.
I'm gonna take off, but it's a small village...
...l'm sure we'll meet again. - I'm sure we will.
all right. Good night.
good night, Beth.
did I tell you my name?
no, no. I heard your friend use it.
but I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.
good to meet you, Stuart.
good night.
Lorna!
Lorna!
Lorna.
excuse me.
Lorna!
Lorna!
Beth, I'm sorry!
you promised.
I know.
I'm sorry!
it's so peaceful.
it's so secluded.
Roman, what are you doing?
come to me.
close your eyes.
Roman! Roman!
Roman! Roman!
Roman! Roman!
on a boat and I have no idea where she is.
how does she get back from that? - Beth, come on!
Oh, fuck!
Beth!
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.
you know, you just go ahead and I'll wait for Lorna.
you go. Yeah. - Yeah?
all right. Thank you so much. - Okay.
sure. Yeah. - Thank you.
fuck!
dude, are you coming? - Are you okay?
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.
are you all right? - Dude, I'm fine.
have another cocktail.
all right, good night.
no, Whit. We're going to sleep.
we are? - Yeah.
okay, is he hot, or is he too, like, eastern bloc?
he's fine. But can we please go get some rest? Come on.
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.
it's okay. I'll take care of her.
I'm sure you will, but not tonight, all right? Good night, Miroslav.
good night, Miroslav!
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.
whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but...
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to go down the hole again tonight.
do you have a AA?
Mr. Rabbit!
come here, Rabbit!
do you remember the first guy in your high school to get laid?
no, but I remember the last.
well, I do. This kid Greg.
he came back from summer break, something about him had changed.
it wasn't anything he said or did, but something was different. You knew it.
I know what you mean. It's like you can sense it the way an animal senses it.
exactly. Like an animal.
sometimes you meet a guy and there's something fucking scary about him...
...Something that makes you think, this guy has killed somebody.
he doesn't have to act tough. He never has to say it.
but like an animal, you can sense it.
you know that this guy's got the balls to do what few others can.
and that's you after today, my friend.
people are gonna fucking fear you. Linda is gonna fucking fear you.
what we do today is gonna pay off every day for the rest of our lives.
Where's your pager? - It's back in the room.
come on. What the fuck? - I just figured you had yours.
is it me? Because it feels like you're, like, having second thoughts.
you've never really been into this. I feel like I'm talking you into it.
I don't wanna be doing something and keep talking about it...
it's different from taking on an image. - I am so fucking tired of talking about it.
it's time we fucking do it.
to the next level.
to the next level. No, wait.
isn't it bad luck to toast with water?
Yeah. Bad luck for whoever meets us today.
Yeah. Let the games begin.
hard, hard, hard.
Hey.
Hey, did she call? - No. I just checked.
I love that Lorna's the only one of us that got any action last night.
Hey, I tried. - Keep trying.
Yeah, she'd say this place is majestic.
sure.
I bet she's making him breakfast right now.
no, I bet she's in a cum coma.
thank God.

I need to know you're listening.

Oh, that's fucking rich.

you're not some monster.
I'm not that guy. - No.

I know you're a good person. - I'm not that guy.

I am not going back in that room! I'm done!

I mean, I wouldn't pay more than a grand for her...
...in this kind of shape, but...
I mean, look at that.

I'll take her.

I bet you fucking do.

yeah? Oh, good. Well, it better be fucking good.
let's fucking hear it. What? - I'm not your wife.
I'm not your wife, Stuart. I'm not your wife.

Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!
Sasha! - Get him!
wait! I wanna buy my way out of here. - Wait!
you can't afford it. - Don't tell me what I can't afford.
there's nothing I can't afford. I could buy and sell everyone in this room.
you going to call your parents for money?
no, motherfucker, it's my money.
just get me a PDA, a SWIFT number and a recipient name.
I have accounts in Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Isle of Man.
just name your fucking price! Trust me, I got it.
okay.
we negotiate.
this is bullshit! - This is business.
I'll pay more!
not with a second mortgage on your house...
...and your daughter's private-school tuition.
that's why your friend pay.
what's the number?
money is not the only issue.
we have contract here.

anyone who come to this place...
...Cannot leave...
...Without killing.

Misha, no!

Hey, get back here!

Hey!

spring training camp and he' s definitely got the inside track.
word is that they're having some problems with injuries.
Really? Are they looking into free-agent signings last second, anything like that?
possibly, and they've got a strong farm club too.
they've got some triple-A ballplayers they might bring up.
Peter would certainly be able to tell us more about that.
who do you like?
so far, I like what I'm seeing in New York.
they've got a strong ball club as usual. That's in the American.
and in the National, I'm still liking Chicago...
...with a little bit of a twist here for Los Angeles.
okay, so we're looking at New York-Chicago World Series...
...possible Los Angeles. Could be a dark horse.
hold him to it at the end of the season.
that's gonna do it for us from the Sports Desk. Back to the studio.
Thanks, Dave. - Thanks for nothing, Eddie.
thank you, guys. That's not all we're following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.
the world of medicine has seen its share of miracle cures...
...from the polio vaccine to heart transplants...
...but all past achievements may pale in comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.
thank you for joining us this morning.
not at all. - So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.
well, the premise is quite simple.
take something designed by nature and reprogram it...
...to make it work for the body rather than against it.
we're talking about a virus? - Yes.
in this case, the measles virus...
...which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful.
um, I'm not... I find the best way to describe it is...
...if you can imagine your body as a highway...
...and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man...
...imagine the damage that that car could cause.
but then if you replace that man with a cop...
...the picture changes. And that's essentially what we've done.
now, how many people have you treated so far?
well, we've had 10, 009 clinical trials in humans so far.
and how many are cancer-free? - Ten thousand and nine.
so you have actually cured cancer?
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.
what you see? What you see?
damn.
let's go, Sam.
come on.
good morning, Matt. It's looking great, I'll tell you.
not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history...
...it had to be one of the prettiest. Imagine waking up on Sunday...
...to 26. 9 inches of snow in New York City.
here you go. Just the way you like it.
disgusting.
excuse me, excuse me.
all right. Come on, relax.
however, it did strand planes, trains and automobiles.
there was a report, a Turkish Airlines flight skidded off the runway at JFK.
no one was injured, but for the most part, Matt...
there you go.
I'm gonna show you, attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.
and I'm gonna plug my ruler in.
in New York, in 30 Rock, we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.
back to you, Matt and Katie.
gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be beautiful for the next day, at least.
and then it turns brown. - If that.
anyway, Ann, thanks so much.
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.
don't just push them around, eat them. I'm not playing.
good morning. This morning, all up the East Coast...
okay. You gonna eat your vegetables. We will sit down here all night.
the biggest challenge is getting back to work.
what are you whining about? Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?
Hey. All right, here's the deal. Look. Look.
you're gonna eat twice as many vegetables tomorrow night. All right?
deal? Deal?
don't worry About a thing. Cause every little thing Gonna be all right.
I know that feels good.
smiled with the rising sun. Three little birds.
Ah, Sam.
singing sweet songs Of melody...
I'm all right.
I'm all right, it's all right.
what's happening? I tried to reach you on your cell. I get a recording.
cell service is down. - Where are we going?
can't get used to the new regs. - Going to Aunt Sara's.
ma! No! Why? - Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.
we're at 30 minutes, colonel. - Copy.
thirty minutes to what? - They're sealing off the island.
seal off the island? This island? - But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.
did you bring all the money? Yeah.
how much? Six hundred.
why did you say, "You're going"?
that's not enough. - Robert.
you said, "You're going," not, "We're going."
when you get across, I need you to get to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.
take Sara's car, go upstate. I'll meet you at the farm.
bring enough food for two weeks.
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?
is it airborne?
but we only go to Aunt Sara's in the summer.
it may be. - Oh, my God.
it's Christmas. What about my presents? - He's announcing it.
make no mistake, Americans, this virus...
you left my Christmas presents in the closet.
hush now, Mar.
threatens the survival of not only our nation, but of every other nation...
mommy, look, it's a butterfly. - Marley, enough!
and so it is with great sadness, but even greater resolve...
...that tonight I have signed an executive order...
...initiating a military quarantine of New York City.
God be with us.
this has been a special...
the window is still open. We find something in a week or two weeks...
...we can reverse the spread.
I can still fix this.
please. You can do the same work outside the city.
this is ground zero. This is my site. We talked about this.
what are you doing?
what am I doing?
I'm not gonna let this happen.
let? This isn't up to you. You can't control...
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!
how'd you sleep?
look out. Come on, you know better than that.
Uh-uh.
I'll be back.
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012, GA series, serum 391.
animal trials. Streaming video.
GA series results appear typical.
compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.
compounds 2, 5, 7...
...12, 13, 15, 17...
...all killed the host.
hold on a second.
compound 6 appears to be showing decreased aggression response.
partial pigmentation return.
slight pupil constriction.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...
...next candidate for human trials.
you hang in there, number six.
Yeah, that's what you want.
Hey!
good morning, Marge. Good morning, Fred.
what are you guys doing here so early?
that's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred. Don't set it down anywhere.
I'll see you guys inside.
what's happening, buddy?
good morning, Hank. I'm midway through the G's.
Hey, who's the girl in?
never mind. Hey, I'll see you in the morning.
what am I supposed to say?
hello.
wanna see some infected rats?
okay, tomorrow. I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.
Psst.
come here. Hey. Hey.
good job. You did so good.
Yes. Yes.
Ah.
look at that. See that? Red salmon.
wow, actual Spam. Yeah.
you'll get some of that later.
let's go.
wait.
my name is Robert Neville.
I am a survivor living in New York City.
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...
...when the sun is highest in the sky.
if you are out there...
if anyone is out there...
I can provide food.
I can provide shelter.
I can provide security.
if there's anybody out there...
...anybody...
please.
you are not alone.
Fore!
Yeah.
keep your eye on this one for me.
Ooh.
I'm getting good.
Ss-ss.
Sam! No, no, no!
No! No! Sam!
No! No!
Sam? Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Hello, Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
come on. Sam.
I gotta go, Sam.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam. Sam.
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go. Sam.
what are you doing?
Sam, we gotta go!
Sam, go! Go!
Sam, get out! Get out!
you gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention.
listen, uh...
...I want you to stay here on this one, okay?
because you can still get infected.
and I can't.
so, look, if I'm not back by dark...
...just go.
okay. Subject is female. Likely 18 to 20 years of age.
dilaudid push only sedates effectively at six times human dose.
core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit. Pulse, 200 bpm.
respiration elevated.
pa 02, 300 percent of normal.
pupils fully dilated.
nonreactive to light.
extreme reaction to UV exposure.
symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject is infected with KV.
vaccine test.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.
commencing human trials.
respiration slowing.
pulse, 190. Core temperature...
...105...
...104 and decreasing.
we may have something here.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6 ineffective on humans.
test results linked to this entry saved on six redundant drives.
still no cure.
day 1001.
we came in close contact with a hive today.
blood tests confirm that I remain immune to both the airborne...
...and contact strains.
canines remain immune to airborne strain only.
you can't go running into the dark, dummy.
vaccine trials continue.
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts.
the Krippin Virus is...
...elegant.
just fishing in the dark, son.
Mm. A behavioral note, um:
an infected male exposed himself to sunlight today.
now, it's possible decreased brain function...
...or the growing scarcity of food is causing them to...
...ignore their basic survival instincts.
social de-evolution appears complete.
typical human behavior is now entirely absent.
why are we stopping?
the street's closed, folks. We hoof it.
we got less than 10 minutes. - Baby, give me the dog.
come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go. - Daddy!
it's all right. It's all right. Come on.
keep the colonel and his family between us and don't let anyone stop you.

mommy! - Please take my baby. Please!
daddy, why can't the little girl come too?
stay away from the shoreline.
how long?
five minutes. We'll make it.
this is Ranger 621, we're on site.
military quarantine is about to begin.
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel. You got my word on it.
give me a kiss.
[MOUTHS] I love you. I love you.
dear Lord, please watch over Robert...
...and keep him strong through the struggles ahead.
Lord, please just bring him home safely. Amen.
daddy's gonna make the monsters go away, baby, okay?

no, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog. - Sir, we gotta go!
daddy, look, it's a butterfly.
[MOUTHS] It's a butterfly.
all right, come on, let's go!
how'd you sleep?
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations...
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed miracle cure for cancer.
so far, almost 5000 patients treated with her retrofitted virus...
...have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early onset of rabies.
twenty-five patients have already died.
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs...
...and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols.
it's my birthday.
we are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through these...

I promised my friend...
...that I would say hello to you today.
hello.
hello.
please say hello to me.
please say hello to me.

don't... Don't let them track us.
you gotta stay out till dawn.
No!
donkey?
what are you doing?
I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one.
well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
it is. Around your half, see? That's your half, this is my half.
Oh, your half? Hm. Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty.
now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
back off! - No, you back off.
this is my swamp! - Our swamp.
smelly ogre. - Fine!
come back, I'm not through with you!
well, I'm through with you.
you know, with you it's always "me, me, me."
well, guess what, now it's my turn. So you just shut up and pay attention!
you are mean to me! You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do.
you're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah.
you're right, Donkey. I forgive you...
...for stabbing me in the back!
you're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings.
go away. - See?
doing it again, just like you did to Fiona...
...and all she did was like you, maybe love you.
love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I heard the two of you talking.
she wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else.
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.
obviously you know that.
they're yours.
but I did find bacon, which is about the most fantastic thing in history.
and some antibiotics in the bathroom.
I put by your plate, because your leg is okay...
...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon.
who are you?
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.
don't let it get cold.
it's okay. Go on.
we came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio.
we were at the pier at noon. We waited all day.
we're going to Vermont.
to the survivors' colony.
what?
in Bethel. It's a safe zone.
there's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones.
nothing happened the way it was supposed to.
nothing worked the way it was supposed to.
in the mountains. There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick.
the virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony...
shut up! Shut up!
everybody's dead.
everybody is dead.
I just need... I need a minute. Okay?
just...
I just... I was saving that bacon.
I was saving it.
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just...
I'm gonna go.
Ethan, put the knife down.
you there! Ogre. - Aye.
by the order of Lord Farquaad...
...I am authorized to place you both under arrest...
...and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
Oh, really? You and what army?
can I say something to you?
you was really, really something back there. Incredible.
are you talking to...
...me?
Yes, I was talking to you. You was really great back there.
those guards, they thought they was all that. You showed up, and bam!
tripping over themselves like babes in the woods.
that really made me feel good to see that.
that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free.
now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Hm?
but, uh...
...I don't have any friends.
and I'm not going out there by myself.
wait a minute. I got a great idea. I'll stick with you!
you a mean, green fighting machine.
together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
I like Shrek.
that was really scary. If you don't mind me saying...
...if that don't work, your breath will get the job done...
...because you definitely need some tic tacs, because your breath stinks!
man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose. Just like the time...
you're not so good with people anymore, are you?
thank you for my leg.
okay.
where have you been?
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of Sao Paulo.
those boats weren't meant to be permanent.
no, they weren't.
when the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies.
someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune.
you said five?
the Darkseekers got them.
you are the Robert Neville, aren't you?
it's too late today.
if we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.
so if you had... - I'm not leaving.
this is ground zero.
this is my site.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
I can still fix this.
that's my snare these are my materials the infected didn't do this, they can't， how would you know？
they have no high brain function, they don't plan and hate they don't love, they can't
could they be evolving?
we gotta go
I've been cooked in .
What？
ice, i need ice - Whoa. You scared me. - Sorry.
I called down twice.
Oh. Oh, thank you.
it's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe.
I've never seen one so still.
they're always biting.
you think that can cure her?
um... No, this will almost certainly kill it...
...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature...
...I can increase the compound's effectiveness.
did all of them die?
Yes.
my God.
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.
where can Ethan sleep?
he's heavy.
can you get that?
she's beautiful.
what's her name?
Marley.
her name was Marley. - It's a beautiful name.
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.
who? - Uh, the singer.
Damian?
uh, his father.
his father.
Nope.
[SINGING] I shot the sheriff
but I didn't shoot the deputy - Oh, that is unacceptable. - What?
best album ever made.
you don't recognize that? - Mm-mm.
Wow.
he had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea.
he believed that you could cure racism and hate. Literally cure it...
...By injecting music and love into people's lives.
one day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally.
gunmen came to his house and shot him down.
two days later...
...he walked out on that stage and sang.
somebody asked him why.
he said, "The people...
...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off.
how can I?
light up the darkness.
come with us, Neville.
to the colony.
there's no colony, Anna.
everything just fell apart.
there was no evacuation plan... - You're wrong. There is a colony.
I know, okay?
how do you know, Anna?
I just know.
how? I said, how do you know? How could you know?
God told me.
he has a plan.
God told you? - Yes.
the God? - Yes.
I know how this sounds. - It sounds crazy.
but something told me to turn on the radio.
something told me to come here.
my voice on the radio told you to come here, Anna.
you were trying to kill yourself last night?
Anna.
I got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence?
just stop it. Stop it. Stop. - He must have sent me here for a reason.
Neville, the world is quieter now.
you just have to listen.
if we listen...
...we can hear God's plan.
God's plan? - Yeah.
all right. Let me tell you about your God's plan.
there were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit.
kv had a 90 percent kill rate. That's 5. 4 billion...
...people dead.
crashed and bled out, dead.
less than 1 percent immunity.
that left 12 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan.
the other 588 million...
...turned into your Darkseekers.
and then they got hungry.
and they killed and fed on everybody.
everybody!
every single person that you or I has ever known...
...is dead!
dead!
there is no God. There is no God.
what is that?
was it still dark when you brought us home last night?
you were bleeding. There was light on the horizon.
turn the light off. Turn it off.
they followed us home.
Ethan.
shit.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna?
Anna.
come on. Come on.
are you okay? You all right? - Yeah.
are you all right?
you okay? - Oh, my God. You're bleeding.
go to the lab. Downstairs, go!
get to the lab! To the lab!
get behind the Plexi.
Oh, my God. Come on.
come on, it's okay. It's okay.
Oh, my God.
it's working.
Neville...
...It's working.
No! Stop! Stop!
look, look, look, I can save you.
I can sa... I can help you. You are sick and I can help you.
I can... I can fix this!
I can save everybody!
I can fix everything! It's working. It's working!
stop! Stop!
let me save you! Let me save you!
no, no!
no, no!
daddy, look, it's a butterfly.
Robert.
what are you doing?
open the door, please！
what are you doing？
I am listening.
I need to get a syringe.
I'm sorry.
my name is Anna Mondays, there are the survivors.
I am traveling with doctor Robert Neville and a boy named Ethan we are heading north on Bethel , Vermont.
keep your radio on.
listen our broadcasts.
you are not alone.
there is hope.
keep listening.
so, quick, while Sylvia's still in line, how she's doing without Daniel?
she's still stuck in the wounded stage.
when she's ready for anger, I am so there. - Me, too.
my dad left my mom.
Prudie is no stranger to marital disappointment.
actually, we're fine now.
you're married? But no ring, huh?
Yeah, it's this hand, and... I teach French.
you teach French, so you wear your wedding ring on the right hand?
it's a European custom. - Are you European?
so Prudie, you haven't said which book you wanna be responsible for.
maybe Persuasion.
cause I'm increasingly drawn to its elegiac tone.
don't think I'm doing the book club. - You're doing it.
you lead one discussion. Pick a book.
well, I just saw Sense and Sensibility, and I think, since I'm back living with my mom,
I really get that whole two-women, tight-relationship, living-together- but-really-opposites thing.
is it weird living back at home again?
I think what Austen is actually writing about is two sisters, moving separately toward what they each believe to be a perfect love.
okay, but the point is Marianne and Elinor's relationship...
maybe if you'd read the book instead of watching the movie...
I thought I might do Emma. - Which leaves what for Sylvia?
Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.
which one's gonna make her feel better?
because we're only doing the book club to get her mind off Daniel.
I thought the reason for the book club was for my not going to Paris.
exactly. - Northanger Abbey.
no, don't make her do Northanger.
I mean, first you're going off to all these dances, and then suddenly it's sort of like nightmare on Northanger Abbey Street.
I'm afraid this isn't the book club that I had in mind.
I mean, I find when someone in the group feels superior to the author, it just... It sets the wrong tone.
okay, I'm happy to leave.
no, Allegra. No. Allegra. No. - Allegra, you can't. You can't.
after this day, I am so happy to be talking about Jane Austen.
Hi. - Hi. Did we choose the books yet?
Sylvia, Prudie.
Oh, I'm sorry. Sylvia Avila.
so, how do you feel about Mansfield Park? - My favorite.
I love Fanny Price. - Stop, Mom, why?
she's such a goodie-goodie.
six books, five people. We skip Northanger Abbey.
definitely. - And miss out on Mr. Tilney?
no, you're right. - He's such a flirt.
we don't have to do all six books, do we?
doing all six novels is the reason of the book club and it is the only reason I'm here.
okay. - Do you wanna invite your husband?
my husband has never read Austen and he never will.
okay, how should we do this?
just meet once a month at each of our houses, potluck...
or, you know, pick some central location.
no, I don't think a coffee shop's conducive.
I'll host the first one, we'll start with Emma, at my place.
but let's not get into this competitive cooking thing.
Bakeoffs!
no, we'll do finger foods. - We're gonna do takeout.
and we have to create the Jane Austen mood.
Oh, my God. - Hey.
he came. - Yeah.
sorry, I sat in the wrong Starbucks for half an hour.
golly, there are a lot of these places, huh?
but they've got interesting coffee from all over the world, so...
this is Grigg, everyone. - I'm Bernadette.
Prudie. - Prudie, and Allegra.
Sylvia. - Grigg Harris.
Hi.
well, I'm excited.
never read anything by Jane Austen before.
what is it?
well, I went to the bookstore to buy a copy of each one of the novels, and I saw this.
and I thought, "Well, maybe they're all sequels."
so, I figured it might be a good idea to keep them all together in one book, in case I needed to refer back.
is this the order that we read them in?
do you wanna grab a coffee, Grigg?
no, no. No, I'm fine. I had plenty at the other place.
and... I bought this and they filled it up for me, so I'm a little...
Yeah.
Oh, you said in your email there was someone you wanted me to meet?
Yeah. Yeah, all of us, actually.
I thought we might benefit from the perspective of a male in the group.
a little testosterone. - Right.
okay. So, none of you ladies are married? - Prudie.
right, so we just... What? We just read them chronologically, and...
we're doing Emma first. - Emma?
Oh. Starting in the middle, huh?
they're not sequels. - They're not?
well, great. We just start anywhere.
what were you smoking? - He's cute.
I thought he'd be a distraction for Sylvia.
she needs an adventure. If he becomes a problem I'll get rid of him.
what happened, you pull a DUI? - No, no, I pretty much bike everywhere.
where do you live?
about 20 miles north. Vista Mar.
you live in what, that development? - Yeah. Yeah.
I had this software company and my accountant says to me, "You gotta buy a house."
so, we were right by that exit.
and I said, "Pull over."
got out, went in, pointed, bought a house.
like that. - I should sell it, I guess.
or at least buy some furniture.
well, I guess I'll have to, if you guys are coming over, right?
Allegra.
Bye. - Yeah. Sayonara.
you know, I never picked a book.
could I do that Abbey one?
perfect. Yeah, it's yours. - Oh, Northanger Abbey.
great. All right.
Emma. Starting in the middle. - Yeah.
well, you gotta hand it to him for taking the dud book.
it's the shortest, that's why.
he's eager to please. - Prudie, see you next time.
he is eager to please. He likes women.
a welcome quality in a man. - Yes. Yes.
do you think Sylvia responded to him? - We let him in. It's done.
Bye. - Bye. Bye.
you're up.
go big!
you okay?
Hey. Hey, you. Listen.
can you make sure they don't call my mother? Please.
just make sure they don't call my mother.
Mrs. Avila? This is Corinne.
I'm a friend of Allegra's. - Allegra's.
and she's asked me to call you.
we're up here in Vacaville at a...
jewelry show. ...jewelry show.
I was showing her how to use my scooter and she took a little spill.
it's minor. She banged up her wrist.
she doesn't need you to come. It's nothing. We're at the doctor's.
he says she could be a bit sore.
Allegra didn't want you to worry if she's not home tonight.
I'll remind her. Book club Monday night.
I'm sorry.
we don't shop on this side of town, ever.
sorry.
you can have this Whole Foods. We won't ever use it again. Okay?
so I was getting the wine for book club and I bumped into Daniel.
he was with her.
Oh, sweetie. - Yeah.
they were going home to make dinner.
he was wearing a jacket with a zipper.
no. - That's so not Daniel.
I just... I walk around this house, and it's not my home anymore.
I feel like Fanny Price banished from Mansfield Park.
that woman is living my life. - Honey, she can't live your life.
are you all right?
I know you like being alone, but don't you ever get Ionely?
so what'd you think about Grigg?
the book club guy.
if you like him, I like him.
how about those dreamy eyes? - I didn't really notice.
well, notice.
can you come early tomorrow since you're bringing the wine?
that's my girls. That's my girls. That's my girls.
it's a smallish world, pedigreed Ridgebacks.
pedigreed is... - Well, it's breeding.
certain bloodlines are naturally more valuable.
mine are out of Queenie of the Serengeti. Gorgeous hound. Gone now.
I bred her to my first really important sire, Pridey.
Sire's the boy dog. Great disposition. Passed away last month.
I'm sorry. - Thank you.
miss him. But Queenie was the real star.
ridgebacks are matriarchal. That's one of their attractive features.
Hey, hey, hey! Sahara, off!
sorry. Sorry about that.
sahara I had to have spayed. Thyroid issues.
I still show her, though. She's very competitive in her category.
yeah? - Sexually altered bitch.
well, I got you those books.
you know the ones I suggested? Ursula Le Guin.
Oh, yeah. Thanks, that was thoughtful.
you don't have to bring a hostess gift to these meetings, FYI.
it's just a book club.
Where's the heat between Emma and Mr. Knightley?
there's no animal passion.
look at Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax.
you can tell they're really in love because they behave so badly.
and that's good?
Emma and Mr. Knightley, you just never feel the sex.
still, I think Mr. Knightley's very yummy. Don't you?
he may be my favorite of all the Austen men.
that's not Jane's theme, is it? - Jane?
that's cozy.
what we're meant to see is not the lack of passion so much as the control of it, and the not giving in.
but Prudie's right, it is in all the novels.
sense and Sensibility, obviously.
Oh, and then there's Maria's infidelity in Mansfield Park.
I forgot there's infidelity in Mansfield Park.
Austen's all about keeping it zipped.
Yeah, but isn't physical attraction one of the ungovernable forces?
you know, like gravity. That's what we like about it.
you know, downhill, release the brakes, loosen your grip, and...
Yeah. Love makes people crazy.
it does not excuse bad behavior. - I agree.
and Mr. Knightley is violently in love. "Violently!" His word.
and yet, he's never anything but a gentleman.
Yeah, a gentleman who scolds people. - Not everyone.
you know, just Emma, just the woman that he loves.
a man can do whatever he likes to the woman he loves.
I don't think that's what Austen's saying.
actually, Emma stops being crazy when she falls for Mr. Knightley.
it's the event of the book. Love is an act of sanity.
one thing that I noticed about Emma is the sense of menace.
the gypsies, Jane Fairfax's boating accident,
Mr. Woodhouse's worries.
Austen's entire thesis is that none of these things are real, Grigg.
I mean, Emma, she acts on the basis of her fantasies.
Yes, Grigg, I'm afraid you've just entirely missed the point.
you know, I've read that the Emma plot, the humbling of the pretty, know-it-all girl is the most popular plot of all time.
Yes, universally satisfying.
okay. Well, what bothered me was how Emma kept forcing her friend Harriet on Mr. Elton.
and then she finds out who Harriet's father is, and suddenly, "Ew!" She's lucky to get the farmer.
I think Jane was being ironic there. I think some readers might miss that.
Emma's a snob. - Please.
people are instinctively drawn to partners who are their near equal in looks.
the pretty marry the pretty, the ugly the ugly.
to the detriment of the breed, in my opinion.
God, you're such an Emma. Isn't she?
you'd love to pair up the whole world, from dogs to people.
put me together with Daniel.
and you had beautiful children.
Oh, no, don't get up, Jocelyn. I'll get the tea. Sorry.
mom.
I hope we didn't scare Grigg away.
Yeah, he sure got out of here fast. - Yeah, we'll toughen him up.
was the book club a bad idea?
Austen has a way of making you forget that most marriages end in divorce.
well, she's all about the weddings, Jane.
Yeah, "Jane." Did you catch that?
Oh, Prudie? "Jane and I, we know our themes."
and why did she have to speak in French?
and if so, couldn't she do it in France, where it's less noticeable?
I feel for Prudie. She's married to a complete Neanderthal.
okay, I will call you when I land in Dallas. You know what?
let me call you when I check in the hotel if there's time before the game, - 'cause we're gonna wanna get there early. - Whatever, okay.
have fun with your mom.
Hey, Sky. Hi. - Hi.
mom, you were supposed to sit with the car.
I'm gonna get a ticket!
yo! - Get some ass!
so... Hey, what're we doing today?
well, I'm teaching. It's a school day, okay?
so I'm gonna drop you at the house.
or you can take the car and you can go see a movie or something.
no, no, I'll hang with you. - No, no, you can't.
they don't allow that.
mom, could you... Oh, my God, please.
okay, I can't.
mom, I'm late. Please. Come on.
Oh, ditch them. Blow them off.
tell them your mother doesn't wanna hang around while you go to work.
what's the story with the clothes? You dress like a flight attendant.
no, I dress like a teacher. Or it gets confusing.
mom, mind your stupid... For everyone.
why would anyone wanna teach high school?
I hated my teachers.
well, I'm just gonna settle you at the house.
no, I'll drop you at school and then I'll take the car.
should you be driving? - Huh?
okay, you know what? Just don't forget to come get me at 3: 00.
okay? Don't forget.
I'm in Brigadoon. Would you mind running lines with me?
of course. I'm all right.
"I'd have died if anything had happened to you."
"I love you so."
"but how can you be sure in just one day"?
"I dinna know, tis just when a lass falls in and out of love, she knows it right away."
what? - It's a good accent.
well, languages are my speciality. I just thought that...
french teacher.
it's your line.
"do you think you're in love with me"?
"Think? What good does thinking do"?
"but what I feel is something else."
"what do ye feel then, Tommy"?
and then we kiss.
who plays opposite you?
Karen Bhave.
I think she only tried out because she thought we'd hook up during the play.
I saw you watching me in the library.
I wasn't watching. - You were watching.
no, I was reading.
you were watching. - I was reading this...
I was reading this book... - Oh, yeah?
...About some people in this house called Mansfield Park.
Austen. - Yeah.
we're doing Mansfield Park for senior seminar, so...
I actually bought the book already. I'm trying to make myself wait, you know?
delay gratification. That sort of thing.
so what happens? - Right, well...
well, they decide to put on a play in the house.
and rehearsing it, it sort of unleashes them.
two of them actually fall in love, and one...
one of them, Maria Bertram, is set... Stop it.
is set to marry someone else. - Or maybe not.
well, I think... I think...
I think what Austen is trying to say is that play-acting is dangerous.
all of that intimacy backstage, the waiting and the whispering, and onstage you're gazing at each other, and "I love you."
I mean...
well, you can see how it happens.
Yeah, I can see it happening, just not with Karen Bhave.
so, do you wanna go over it again?
Hello?
Yeah. - Hey, Grigg, it's Jocelyn.
Hi. Hey. - Hi.
so how's Mansfield Park coming? - Just great.
am I disturbing you?
I'm just writing an email to my sisters about you, as a matter of fact.
and Ursula Le Guin.
did you ever read Left Hand of Darkness? - Not yet.
Hey, listen, Bernadette and I were just saying we hope Allegra didn't scare you off the book club.
which one is Allegra? - Sylvia's daughter.
really pretty, really passionate, wonderful girl.
ask him if he can make time today.
you might take Sylvia to lunch today.
tell him that Sylvia and Daniel are in court this morning over their separation.
she could use the ego boost.
you have Sylvia's number, right?
would you wanna come, too?
listen, I know there's a difference in your ages, but I really think the two of you will hit it off.
sahara. I gotta go, okay?
this woman I like definitely seems interested, but it's weird.
she's sort of pushing me to date this girl, Allegra, who's way younger than me.
she said I should take this girl's mother to lunch.
bank assets will be divided equally.
each individual will keep his or her own car, and each will be wholly responsible for the attendant payments and insurance.
the house owned by Daniel and Sylvia will be jointly held, with both parties paying an equal share of property taxes, upkeep and repairs.
Sylvia may live in the house. Daniel will not.
as soon as Daniel hit 50, his wheels fell off.
here's what I get from Mansfield Park.
that a marriage is only as strong as its weakest partner.
Daniel has always wanted to find his center by wobbling.
this is a pretty big wobble.
Mansfield Park is full of wobblers.
lady Bertram lying around, letting a houseful of adolescents run riot.
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months, dumps her husband...
and don't forget Fanny's father, the unemployed alcoholic.
marry the weak link and you're screwed. That's what she's saying.
no wonder why Austen never married. It's terrifying.
I think I finally hate him. - Good.
I'm home. I'm going out again. I have book club.
you just missed this guy who got buried up to his neck in a tank filled with cockroaches.
and they were real.
you'd think it'd be illegal to show stuff like that.
here, grab a spoon.
you have to leave.
you put your things in your suitcase 'cause I'm booking your flight.
want me to... - Yeah.
how did you break it? - I fell.
which was kind of lucky, actually.
cause I met this girl, Corinne, who I've been seeing. She's a writer.
which, um, isn't so great, really, 'cause if she had to choose between me and writing, she'd probably choose writing.
but she doesn't ever have to choose. So you never have to know.
so you're a lesbian. Full-time?
you mean, do I ever slip and accidentally sleep with a man?
no, no, my sister Cat, she goes out with guys and girls.
she lives in Idaho.
your sister isn't Cat Harris.
you know her? - Bernadette knows everyone.
I met her through my doctor friend in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.
you know my sister, Bianca?
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.
those are your sisters!
our world is an English village.
my topic is the long-suffering daughter.
one can't help but see the parallels between the long-suffering Fanny Price in Mansfield Park and the long-suffering Anne Eliot in Persuasion.
I hate Fanny Price.
excuse me, we're not electing the homecoming queen, okay?
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes, we all know Elizabeth Bennet would be most popular and that Fanny would be least.
who's Elizabeth Bennet? - Of Pride and Prejudice.
don't give away too much, 'cause I haven't read that one yet.
you don't know Pride and Prejudice? - No.
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price was Austen's favorite.
Fanny's boring. - She's faithful.
she's Horton Hatches the Egg.
she sits on that nest and she never, ever wavers.
well, she'd probably be easier to like if she would just allow some weakness in others.
she doesn't allow it in herself. - True.
I didn't see what was so bad about Henry Crawford.
Yes. Thank you, Grigg. Why does it have to be Edmund?
well, Austen, she's always suspicious of people who are too charming.
just once I'd like to pick up Mansfield Park and see Fanny end up in the sack with Henry Crawford.
Yes! Yes!
you can't read these novels without wondering if she doesn't have a little thing for the naughty boys.
well, who doesn't?
except for Fanny Price.
okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.
she puts her family's needs above her own. - Mom, it's okay.
and she never, ever stops loving Edmund, ever.
even when he's stupid enough to do something like take up with Mary Crawford.
Oh, dear.
I thought Mansfield Park would be safe, didn't you?
I don't think we're gonna get through all six books.
reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.
you're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes!
the relationship between Edmund and Fanny.
they seemed like brother and sister.
but then in the end, it's like The Empire Strikes Back, but it's in reverse. You know? 'Cause in Jedi, Luke Skywalker, he gets over Princess Leia when she turns out to be his sister.
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...
did that bother anybody else?
weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch? - Oh, yeah.
you know Allegra's gay, right? - Of course.
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.
and before we do Northanger Abbey, I gotta buy a couch, so...
is something going on between these two? - Grigg, you have to...
would you come with me, help me pick it out?
if you take Sylvia to lunch.
great.
good, that's great.
okay, see you. - All right, yup, here.
take care. - Oh, God. Sorry.
I caught him staring at my titties.
I like that.
I like this. - That color's difficult.
I like things that are difficult. I'll take it.
wait, you just don't buy the first one you like.
you don't even know if it'll fit. - What? It's fine.
you getting hungry?
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude, but may I ask, do you have a lot of money?
never know how to answer that.
Yeah, I have enough money.
but, you know, I like working in tech support.
may I? - Sure.
you should bring Sylvia here. It's so romantic.
you know, she's planning this library fundraiser.
she's busy. - Call her.
it's hard to be alone.
well, maybe her husband will come back. - Maybe.
Jane Austen should write that.
she did. In Persuasion.
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy Wentworth who's in the navy, right?
but her family thinks that he's not good enough.
right. - So he leaves.
and when he comes back he's become this wealthy man.
but he's no longer in love with her. - Okay. Don't tell me any more.
Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see. - Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?
you didn't like Le Guin? - I didn't read them.
how are you gonna know what you like unless you try?
I think at my age I should know what I like.
age? Come on, age.
age has nothing to do with anything.
I was willing to read girly books like Jane Austen...
she is not girly.
which I found out.
so maybe you would find out that science fiction's not just...
aliens on rocket ships. - Right.
all right, hurry up and finish. I'm gonna show you something really cool.
what you have to understand is that when I was a kid, my dad and I were basically surrounded by girls.
you know, there was my mom, my sisters, and their friends.
so there'd be like 15 girls in the house. It was insane.
my dad would hide out in the shed and no one was allowed back there.
and he'd listen to ballgame, you know, smoke his pipe.
he actually died a couple years ago of mouth cancer.
I'm so sorry. - Anyway, one day...
I'm like 10 years old, my dad takes me back to the shed and he shows me some magazines that he keeps back there.
he says, "This is strictly guy stuff. It's top secret. Very private."
"tell no one."
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...
I don't know... It's like me and my dad and science fiction.
these were like the first books that I fell in love with, and I never got over it.
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.
theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.
philip K. Dick. This was my top-secret all-guy world.
Andre Norton. - Very manly.
except, as it turns out, Andrew Norton, a. k.a. Andre Norton, - a. k.a. Alice Mary Norton. - No way.
James Tiptree. - I heard of him.
real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.
Patrice Anne... - You were still surrounded.
but by that time I liked girls.
you win. I'll read the Le Guin.
great.
tell me a secret. - Your turn.
no. You have better secrets. You can trust me.
tell me.
okay, but this is not something I would tell anyone else.
there was this special needs kid in the grade above me, Benny.
he wore his hat squashed down really low, and his ears stuck out.
and he was always carrying around this basketball and going...
and, one day, I was in fourth grade,
I saw that he was holding his penis.
so, I just went back to my friends.
well, later my dad picked me up.
and he was distracted, just not really listening, and...
and I don't know why, but...
I said, "Dad, this boy at school made me look at his penis."
wait. What was his name? - Benny.
we actually got their address and drove to their house.
and Benny's mom answers the door. I mean, she was old.
she has these two long, skinny gray braids. And my dad's yelling.
and she starts crying. "I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?"
and he says, "I expect you to speak to your son."
and then right behind her is Benny with his stupid basketball, going...
and my dad just stops.
cause he had a little brother like that who died.
Oh, my God.
so we get back in the car and my dad is just silent.
and then he says, "I think you knew you were leaving out the most important part."
and I just felt horrible.
you know, I didn't really know any of that was gonna happen.
I just wanted his attention.
have you lost your mind?
I thought about... I thought about calling.
I... But I didn't wanna wake you. - You can't just show up here, Daniel.
somebody's gotta mow the lawn. I don't mind.
well, I'll pay somebody.
you know? I mean, this is my home. You cannot just arrive here without asking.
what if I had somebody staying over?
are you seeing someone? - Put the mower away.
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.
I just missed hearing what's going on here.
Allegra, she acts like she hates me, and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy, they call from school, but they don't say much.
they're ashamed of their father.
so Diego says you told him the handle on the shower's loose?
thirty seconds. - I'll deal with it.
is there something in the house you don't want me to see?
do you think I'm not taking care of the house?
no, no... - You wanna do what a husband does?
you wanna fix things?
you can't fix this.
you're not my husband.
all that's gone now. - Can I call you next weekend?
no, you cannot call me next weekend. - Okay.
I'll check in with you, okay?
my mom said I could buy a motorcycle if I paid for it myself.
it's her one stipulation, right?
so I work at the mall.
and I have that whole Kerouac thing planned for this summer, and now it's, "No."
I'm 18 years old. I have the right to buy a motorcycle.
but you had a motorcycle once.
and you ended up hating it.
remember, Trey?
remember? You used to park it on the other side of the gym.
it was red and black. And...
you got really tired of taking care of it.
What're you talking about?
that was my mom's technique when I wanted something.
she'd say, "But you had a birthday party last year."
remember? We had a big cake "with pink icing and roses all over it."
and you hated it.
and she was totally messing with you?
it got her out of giving me a birthday party. - Wow.
I mean, I have wonderful memories of balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.
and it never happened. That's pretty messed up.
we certainly can't have a big party like that every year, can we?
so, when did you finally figure it out?
well, by then she had this other trick.
so suggest something to me. Something you'd like to do.
okay. Um...
let's get a room.
let's not get a room and just say we did.
then we give up?
you weren't a very persistent kid, were you?
Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me. - Why?
because you're a teacher?
I... We can't do this.
let's get out of here.
we'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.
let's not and just wish we did.
I don't wanna pretend.
um, we're late.
just give me a second.
God.
does this place seem creepy? - It's quiet.
wow, Sylvia, you look great! - Hottie!
it's the new me.
Hey, how's Corinne doing? - Great.
so, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights on Northanger Abbey?
stop it. He might surprise you.
I hope his couch has arrived. - Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.
passing around cans of aerosol cheese? - Stop it. Fine.
Grigg is a grownup. I'm sure he's made it very nice.
all right.
welcome. Please come in.
whoa. - Grigg? Whoa!
apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.
no, it's Northanger Abbey! It's Gothic! - Right!
no one gets out alive!
I don't like this. I don't like this. - Sylvia, Sylvia!
Grigg? Grigg? Grigg? - Sylvia, it's a joke.
he's just having fun... - Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!
it's okay. It's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
look. - It's a send-up of Northanger.
it's a program. - Bernadette, that's your phone.
this is my remote. And everything's on sensors.
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean. Is Prudie running late?
what do you do on Hallowe'en? - Oh, Hallowe'en is big.
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger. You should come over for Hallowe'en.
wait. - Oh, that's terrible.
I got inspired reading The Mysteries of Udolpho.
you know, the book in Northanger Abbey that Catherine's obsessed with reading?
you read The Mysteries of Udolpho? - Food!
Hey, Grigg, that color almost works. - When did you...
he read The Mysteries of Udolpho. - Wow.
wait, that book they were reading in the book? That's a real book?
Yeah, with the black veils and Laurentina's skeleton.
didn't you think that sounded great? - Yeah, it sounded awesome.
Dean, I'm so sorry. Prudie must be devastated.
Prudie said to ask you.
she's supposed to talk or something, about some book?
persuasion.
we don't know how long we're gonna be down in San Diego, so...
she may have to cancel.
tell her we'll save Persuasion for the end.
it's better to do it last, anyway. It was Austen's final book.
I thought Northanger Abbey was the final book.
written first. Published last. - That makes much more sense.
Why? - What happened with her?
cause it's a novel about novels.
you know? You see Austen as the young writer, questioning herself.
who's a heroine? What makes a good story?
are novels a waste of time? Am I gonna write? What should I write about?
I like that. - That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.
Thanks.
Prudie's mother died.
what? - Jesus.
she got into her car yesterday, this was in San Diego.
she made a left coming out of a parking lot into oncoming traffic.
Jesus. - Terrible.
were Prudie and her mom close? - Well, there was tension.
what do we think? Is Persuasion too depressing to take on right now, with the dead mother and everything?
she doesn't die on the page.
even Sense and Sensibility, the dad dies.
what about Pride and Prejudice?
I could use a little encounter in the woods with Mr. Darcy right now.
are we all up for a little romance? - Ready.
I think we're all overdue. And it'll be better for Prudie.
I still can't believe you read The Mysteries of Udolpho, Grigg.
Bravo, Grigg. Bravo. - Yay for the grilled artichokes.
you can move in with us any time, Grigg. - Please, don't bring skeletons.
she loves these.
are you and Grigg seeing each other?
no. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously. That was the plan, right?
I don't wanna fight, okay?
I don't know why you didn't just take her back to the car and have sex with her. I mean, clearly you wanted to.
I talked to her... I talked to her for like five minutes.
longer. Longer, Dean.
and with those ridiculous plastic boobs. Is that what you go for?
Prudie, you know, I was just trying to be nice to your friend.
okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead."
and you hit on her!
I do... I do... - You hit on her!
I was not hitting on her.
you know, when I was in the 10th grade,
I wrote an entire paper on Julius Caesar in iambic pentameter.
and Chloe Baher removed it from my locker and she read it aloud to the whole class.
and everyone laughed at me.
baby, high school's over.
high school's never over.
and turning 'round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me."
I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies "'who are slighted by other men."
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, "for you are wasting your time with me."
you know, I don't know if we can do Pride and Prejudice next week, because it's the library dinner.
well, we need to go for Sylvia. Daniel's bringing Pam.
that's so unnecessary. - Tell me about it.
his firm's buying a table. - Well, then we should buy one.
all of us, the book club.
show up in force. - Yes.
"the Central Valley River City All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,"
is what Grigg calls it.
he's so funny. I'm so glad he finally made a date with Sylvia.
he's taking her to lunch.
I sure hope there's some dancing in this thing.
I'm trying to diet.
my husband is bringing a date to my fundraiser.
Yeah, re-reading Pride and Prejudice again,
I keep thinking, "You know, courtship is easy."
Where's Austen's novel on divorce? - I wouldn't say it was easy.
depends who you're courting, I guess.
does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone? - Occasionally.
she used to date my husband in high school.
then she sort of gave him to me.
Daniel's the one that first bought Jocelyn a dog.
she traded your husband for a dog? - Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...
if loving is letting go, then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey.
do you know Lynne from my writing group?
I don't, actually. Allegra. - Hey.
listen, I just have to say, you have been so good for Corinne.
ever since you two have been together, she's been writing nonstop.
didn't you just love that story that she wrote last week?
well, Allegra and I don't discuss what I'm working on.
okay.
"dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret that we must decline to publish the three short stories you sent us."
"Benny's Basketball" is strong narratively, "but the depiction of your penis-waving retarded boy felt a little unkind."
and isn't the title "Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious "as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?
yet we confess that "Skydiver" puzzled us most.
why would a beautiful, self-centered young lesbian jump out of a plane?
I thought we could drive together.
we should hurry. I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.
sahara, off. - Sylvia's already at the library.
she said she had to get there early. - So you offered her a ride first.
no, she happened to mention it at lunch.
that's a great dress.
stay.
I converted it to biodiesel. So it basically runs on donut grease.
this is so great. I never get to drive it.
or vacuum it, apparently.
I like your hair.
you need to dance with Sylvia tonight.
you do know how to dance, don't you? - Of course I do.
I have three older sisters. I can dance.
wait, if we stay in this lane, we're gonna be late.
given that I have to convert donut grease into biofuel every time I fill up the tank, I just try not to drive very fast.
we're barely moving.
you ever read those Le Guin books I bought you?
I prefer books about real people.
okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real and people in science fiction aren't.
is that it?
science fiction books have people in them, but they're not about the people.
real people are complicated.
well, there's all kinds of science fiction.
when you've read some, I will be interested in your opinion.
why are you getting off here? - I enjoy seeing the river.
what are you, Mark Twain?
now we're gonna get stuck at every light.
look at the talent in this room.
half the Silicon Valley is here.
to romance.
Hi. - Hello.
I'm planning on meeting a software baron and moving to Pemberley.
well, everyone knows a rich man is eventually going to want a new wife.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dean.
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.
uh, moral support. She's had a rough couple of weeks.
well, you're welcome to join in, Dean. - Nah, that's okay.
I think I'll just head to the bar. Let you ladies talk.
there is no bar. It's a library.
serving liquor. - Well, that'll work.
you guys need anything?
we had this big fight on the way over here.
have some champagne. - Mom?
I broke up with Corinne.
Oh, my God. Honey.
nice. - We have plenty of time.
honey, whatever happened between you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.
you don't even know what she did. - Did she hit you?
did she say cruel things?
you are so quick to love. You're too quick.
you jump in, you jump out. That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.
it's not working? Well... Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?
we don't just dispose of people we love. You stay. You repair.
okay, you know what? This is not you and Daddy.
this is Corinne. The difference being that Daddy actually loves you.
so you go repair. Power on.
maybe Daddy'll give up this woman he's been fucking.
Allegra. - But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.
we're gonna be so late. - I'll call a cab.
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel walks into that library with Pam.
you got your phone?
I'll find a payphone.
are you attracted to Sylvia?
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.
she's more than nice. She's smart and funny...
and she's in love with her husband. - Well, she needs to get over that.
why don't you stop interfering? Let Sylvia work out her own life.
it's interfering to want my best friend to be happy.
if that's interfering, I hope I never stop.
what about me? Am I your friend?
or am I just some widget to help you make Sylvia feel better about herself?
why did you invite me to be part of your book club?
what went through your mind the first time you saw me?
there's a man who is dying to read every book Jane Austen ever wrote.
is that what you thought? - No.
but I thought, "What a beautiful woman. I hope she looks over at me."
I thought if I read your favorite books that you would read mine.
but, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.
that's why you have dogs.
for such a famously romantic story,
pride and Prejudice is a parade of bizarre marriages.
I've had every marriage in this book.
my first husband was a politician. He was embarrassed by every move I made.
he said I was rude and loud.
"stop pointing your breasts everywhere," he'd say to me.
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.
I married the first man who looked at me.
you don't see your own marriage until it's too late.
so, um... I actually thought that Charlotte Lucas was gay.
really, I think that when she tells Lizzie she's not as romantic as she is,
I think that's what she means.
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not. She just... She just has no options.
wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay or Charlotte is gay and Austen is not aware of it?
I just love the idea of a character having a secret life that the author doesn't even know about.
you know, frankly, I kind of admire Charlotte for looking at her situation and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.
I mean, yes, yes, she knows he'll never be the "love of her life,"
but that's okay.
that is exactly the reason that Jocelyn would hate her.
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone who settles for anything less than the perfect love.
you know, it's probably why Jocelyn has never married.
my apologies, everybody.
hello. - Hi.
we ran out of donut grease.
Grigg Harris. - Dean Drummond.
wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club? - Yeah.
no, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg," and I just didn't picture it as a guy.
so you thought Grigg was a girl?
Dean thinks "Austen" is the capital of Texas.
Wow.
you'll notice that Jane, she never shows what happens after the wedding.
maybe Elizabeth and Darcy start hating each other.
maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley, and she turned into this crazy person, like her mom, because our mothers are like time bombs.
they just... They tick away inside of us.
let's not give Mrs. Bennet more importance than she deserves.
you know, I mean, what about the father? - What father?
you know, my mom showed me a picture of a guy in uniform.
well, maybe she made him up.
or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.
and I kept it in my room, this...
I kept it in my room.
let's not do this now, okay?
Dean, I got it.
Bernadette.
Daniel never came.
good.
I'm in love with one of my students.
but I mean, nothing's happened. Much.
but it could.
it could, if I let it.
I fantasize about him constantly.
sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.
he looks at me like he's the spoon, and I'm the dish of ice cream.
it's a good thing we're reading Sense and Sensibility next.
I love you so. - But how can you be sure in just one day?
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in or out of love, she knows it right away.
you think you're in love with me? - Think?
what good does thinking do but what I feel is something else?
Hey, you got your cast off. - Yeah.
how does it feel? - Great.
you can reach it. Just really stretch your arm out.
there you go. Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.
you can do it, there... Can you put your...
can you put your right foot in that blue thing?
it's gonna be fine.
here, hang on. - You can reach it.
just reach up. - It's caught.
it's okay. You're doing good.
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt. It's nothing.
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.
it's not likely to be anything more than a concussion.
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation for a few days, okay?
and if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.
how many times have we had to come here to get her stitched up?
it's always Allegra, never the boys. - Well, she's the one who goes mountain climbing and skateboarding and snowboarding.
it's a miracle she never tried parachuting.
she's so extreme.
one minute she's crazy in love with Corinne, the next minute she's never hated anybody more.
she's gonna be okay, right? - She's fine.
she just took a knock on the noodle.
this is gonna sound, probably, horrible, considering the fact that she's got this lump on her head, but... It's just...
it's great to have us all in the same room again.
just feels so normal.
normal, yeah.
you know, I haven't been seeing Pam for a couple of months now.
so, that must be a big change.
you know, I was thinking just this morning about this book club that we're in, Allegra and me.
the first meeting was...
Yeah, we had just been separated. 'Cause Allegra had just moved in.
and I was realizing how different I feel.
I don't think I'm the same woman that you left.
I can see that. I so see that.
well, it's probably the same for you.
I guess that's what happens when you let go.
we did a good job taking things apart.
I'm kind of proud of us.
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.
you two just keep it together for one more book.
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.
Austen sets up this juicy triangle between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.
and then at the end, she practically has to whip a rabbit out of a hat to make Lucy Steele run off with Edward's brother?
Yeah, that requires some hand-waving. - I think the ending's well-plotted.
to me, the part that seems forced is Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.
anyone else feel that? - Oh, I have no problem with that.
he rides up on a big stallion, sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.
from the time Colonel Brandon meets Marianne, he just lavishes all this attention on her.
and meanwhile, she's throwing herself at Willoughby.
Willoughby is a player.
women never go for the nice guy.
please. Men say that, but you get to know some of these men who complain the most, you find out they're not as nice as they like to think they are.
okay. You know what struck me?
is that Colonel Brandon is only a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.
well, why does he take up with the daughter and not the mother?
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?
maybe Mrs. Dashwood won't give him the time of day.
the book is about the young people. - Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks that nothing interesting can happen to a woman over 25.
when actually, a novel about a woman seducing a slightly younger man just yields so much more.
well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood should go for Willoughby.
why not?
it's a long, hot summer.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood has more sense than that.
okay, can I just point out, she's hardly in the story.
sex is messy.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood prefers a more well-ordered life.
maybe that's why she's such a minor character.
I think if you read Austen's novels... - Oh, I have.
you wanted me to, and I did.
I think you'll see she always writes in favor of order and self-control.
nothing unwise. - Nothing in haste.
okay, so, this is... This is what, this is a rulebook?
we could do worse.
I think Jane Austen wrote about women falling in love because she was Ionely.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.
Austen lived a very full life. She could've gotten married anytime.
she almost did. - That's right.
but she decided not to. - Why, too messy? Too out of control?
his name was Harris Bigg-Wither, and they were engaged for one night.
"Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither!" I can't believe you know that.
I understand why Colonel Brandon goes for Marianne.
and it's not 'cause she's young.
it's because she's generous with herself.
she's willing to risk her heart. No rules, no fear.
and Willoughby tramples her. - She just picked the wrong guy.
no rules, no fear.
I like that.
Hi. - You're wearing that to your book club?
it's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day, 'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme, which is, you know, like, the beach in England.
this is your last one, right?
I think we're gonna do some more books after this one.
Prudie's gonna be hours late and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.
thank God it's the last meeting.
Yes, there's getting to be a little too much plot.
not that I blame Grigg.
something about reading Austen sort of makes you wanna get it on.
Hi.
started reading it with Allegra at the hospital. This is a great book.
are you joining our discussion?
am I? 'Cause I'd like to. - Hi.
Daniel wants to join us. - Well he's not in the club, is he?
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen. So far.
it's all about mistakes and second chances.
Yeah, you can stay.
glass of wine?
I can't believe he brought a date to our last meeting.
I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling. - For me?
honey, I took your boyfriend away from you in high school.
look how that turned out.
Hi. - Hey.
how ya doing? - Guys, this is Cat.
hello. - I'm Grigg's big sister.
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so... I'm... God, that's wonderful.
you're Grigg's sister. I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.
how are you? - Hi.
good, thank you. - Hi. Bernadette.
I don't believe it. - Look at you!
you look great. - Good to see you.
thank you.
wow, are you visiting from Idaho? - Yeah, yeah.
we kept seeing these emails. And we said, "What kind of strange power "do these women have that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?
just thought I'd check it out. You wanna take a walk?
well, sure.
excuse me.
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!
Hi. - Dr. Yep?
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.
I'm sorry we're late. - Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.
is that Dad?
let's say hi. - Okay.
a doctor.
nothing in haste.
dad! Hi! - Hey.
would you do me a favor?
would you read this?
please. Right now.
isn't that what your special little book club's for?
I really want you to read it.
please, Dean.
it doesn't... They don't...
Prudie, I feel like you want me to be something that I'm not.
I just walk around being me. I don't pretend to be anything else.
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen" is a city in Texas.
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.
you just set me up for a test that you don't want me to pass.
no, no. This is not a test.
this is something to share.
why don't you just tell me what it's about?
it's about these two people who used to love each other.
and they don't anymore.
and it's how they persuade themselves to give it another try.
look, I can get you started off. Okay?
come on. - So I've been trying to figure out that moment in Persuasion when Wentworth and Anne just began to stop hating each other.
maybe it's when they went with everyone to Lyme.
after Louisa Musgrove fell.
after Wentworth used her to make Anne jealous.
you think he was using Louisa?
Yeah. That's one interpretation.
I think the guy was just trying to feel... - Valued again.
it was a bonehead move.
I mean, he knows he's nothing without Anne.
he loved her then, he loves her now.
I like how Austen always lets the men explain themselves.
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, and Frank writes to Emma.
Yeah, in Persuasion, everything hangs on Wentworth leaving her that note - when everybody's talking all around them. - Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.
no, smart guy. Perfect timing.
Yeah.
let us never underestimate the power of a well-written letter.
Grigg has always loved dogs.
you know, we were never allowed to have one when we were kids.
dogs and books. That's our Grigg.
okay, he'd kill me for saying this, but my brother likes you.
I'm figuring he'll never tell you. And this way it's up to you.
my sisters and me, I wouldn't say we ruined him, but he's just way too considerate to make the first move.
Hey. - Hey.
I was just wishing that Austen had written a bunch more books, you know?
I'm gonna miss this.
"all of the ladies were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, "excepting Louisa.
she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
she was safely down and instantly, to show her enjoyment, "ran up the steps to be jumped down again."
he advised her against it, but no...
shoot.
I'm so sorry. I should've called first. I read these books.
I love them.
I couldn't stop reading.
I went to the all-night newsstand on State Street to buy Searoad, the next one, - but they didn't have it, and... - Do you wanna borrow Searoad?
I mean, I have... You know, there...
there are other writers that you might like.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
wait, wait, wait.
Hey, has anyone read those Patrick O'Brian novels?
british Navy. - Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?
there's more of us now. - I'm in.
Oh, my God, is that Bernadette? - I thought she was in Costa Rica.
buenas noches, everyone. This is Senor Obando.
Hola. - Hello.
hello. - He's working on his English.
I'm working on my Spanish. - Hello.
and so far I have te amo.
and mi esposo.
Oh, my God! - Congratulations!
that's incredible! - That's incredible. Congratulations!
Oh, it's gorgeous. - Thank you.
I'm so happy for you. - Congratulations.
dad, check it out. - Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.
don't be gone too long. - Yikes. That makes seven.
what? - Yeah.
Hey, guys. Guys.
he hasn't read a word of Austen.
Oh, poor man.
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.
Cheers! - Cheers!
bank assets will be divided equally.
each individual will keep his or her own car, and each will be wholly responsible for the attendant payments and insurance.
the house owned by Daniel and Sylvia will be jointly held, with both parties paying an equal share of property taxes, upkeep and repairs.
Sylvia may live in the house. Daniel will not.
as soon as Daniel hit 50, his wheels fell off.
here's what I get from Mansfield Park.
that a marriage is only as strong as its weakest partner.
Daniel has always wanted to find his center by wobbling.
this is a pretty big wobble.
Mansfield Park is full of wobblers.
lady Bertram lying around, letting a houseful of adolescents run riot.
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months, dumps her husband...
and don't forget Fanny's father, the unemployed alcoholic.
marry the weak link and you're screwed. That's what she's saying.
no wonder why Austen never married. It's terrifying.
I think I finally hate him. - Good.
I'm home. I'm going out again. I have book club.
you just missed this guy who got buried up to his neck in a tank filled with cockroaches.
and they were real.
you'd think it'd be illegal to show stuff like that.
here, grab a spoon.
you have to leave.
you put your things in your suitcase 'cause I'm booking your flight.
want me to... - Yeah.
how did you break it? - I fell.
which was kind of lucky, actually.
cause I met this girl, Corinne, who I've been seeing. She's a writer.
which, um, isn't so great, really, 'cause if she had to choose between me and writing, she'd probably choose writing.
but she doesn't ever have to choose. So you never have to know.
so you're a lesbian. Full-time?
you mean, do I ever slip and accidentally sleep with a man?
no, no, my sister Cat, she goes out with guys and girls.
she lives in Idaho.
your sister isn't Cat Harris.
you know her? - Bernadette knows everyone.
I met her through my doctor friend in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.
you know my sister, Bianca?
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.
those are your sisters!
our world is an English village.
my topic is the long-suffering daughter.
one can't help but see the parallels between the long-suffering Fanny Price in Mansfield Park and the long-suffering Anne Eliot in Persuasion.
I hate Fanny Price.
excuse me, we're not electing the homecoming queen, okay?
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes, we all know Elizabeth Bennet would be most popular and that Fanny would be least.
who's Elizabeth Bennet? - Of Pride and Prejudice.
don't give away too much, 'cause I haven't read that one yet.
you don't know Pride and Prejudice? - No.
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price was Austen's favorite.
Fanny's boring. - She's faithful.
she's Horton Hatches the Egg.
she sits on that nest and she never, ever wavers.
well, she'd probably be easier to like if she would just allow some weakness in others.
she doesn't allow it in herself. - True.
I didn't see what was so bad about Henry Crawford.
Yes. Thank you, Grigg. Why does it have to be Edmund?
well, Austen, she's always suspicious of people who are too charming.
just once I'd like to pick up Mansfield Park and see Fanny end up in the sack with Henry Crawford.
Yes! Yes!
you can't read these novels without wondering if she doesn't have a little thing for the naughty boys.
well, who doesn't?
except for Fanny Price.
okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.
she puts her family's needs above her own. - Mom, it's okay.
and she never, ever stops loving Edmund, ever.
even when he's stupid enough to do something like take up with Mary Crawford.
Oh, dear.
I thought Mansfield Park would be safe, didn't you?
I don't think we're gonna get through all six books.
reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.
you're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes!
the relationship between Edmund and Fanny.
they seemed like brother and sister.
but then in the end, it's like The Empire Strikes Back, but it's in reverse. You know? 'Cause in Jedi, Luke Skywalker, he gets over Princess Leia when she turns out to be his sister.
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...
did that bother anybody else?
weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch? - Oh, yeah.
you know Allegra's gay, right? - Of course.
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.
and before we do Northanger Abbey, I gotta buy a couch, so...
is something going on between these two? - Grigg, you have to...
would you come with me, help me pick it out?
if you take Sylvia to lunch.
great.
good, that's great.
okay, see you. - All right, yup, here.
take care. - Oh, God. Sorry.
I caught him staring at my titties.
I like that.
I like this. - That color's difficult.
I like things that are difficult. I'll take it.
wait, you just don't buy the first one you like.
you don't even know if it'll fit. - What? It's fine.
you getting hungry?
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude, but may I ask, do you have a lot of money?
never know how to answer that.
Yeah, I have enough money.
but, you know, I like working in tech support.
may I? - Sure.
you should bring Sylvia here. It's so romantic.
you know, she's planning this library fundraiser.
she's busy. - Call her.
it's hard to be alone.
well, maybe her husband will come back. - Maybe.
Jane Austen should write that.
she did. In Persuasion.
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy Wentworth who's in the navy, right?
but her family thinks that he's not good enough.
right. - So he leaves.
and when he comes back he's become this wealthy man.
but he's no longer in love with her. - Okay. Don't tell me any more.
Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see. - Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?
you didn't like Le Guin? - I didn't read them.
how are you gonna know what you like unless you try?
I think at my age I should know what I like.
age? Come on, age.
age has nothing to do with anything.
I was willing to read girly books like Jane Austen...
she is not girly.
which I found out.
so maybe you would find out that science fiction's not just...
aliens on rocket ships. - Right.
all right, hurry up and finish. I'm gonna show you something really cool.
what you have to understand is that when I was a kid, my dad and I were basically surrounded by girls.
you know, there was my mom, my sisters, and their friends.
so there'd be like 15 girls in the house. It was insane.
my dad would hide out in the shed and no one was allowed back there.
and he'd listen to ballgame, you know, smoke his pipe.
he actually died a couple years ago of mouth cancer.
I'm so sorry. - Anyway, one day...
I'm like 10 years old, my dad takes me back to the shed and he shows me some magazines that he keeps back there.
he says, "This is strictly guy stuff. It's top secret. Very private.
tell no one.
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...
I don't know... It's like me and my dad and science fiction.
these were like the first books that I fell in love with, and I never got over it.
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.
theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.
philip K. Dick. This was my top-secret all-guy world.
Andre Norton. - Very manly.
except, as it turns out, Andrew Norton, a. k.a. Andre Norton, - a. k.a. Alice Mary Norton. - No way.
James Tiptree. - I heard of him.
real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.
Patrice Anne... - You were still surrounded.
but by that time I liked girls.
you win. I'll read the Le Guin.
great.
tell me a secret. - Your turn.
no. You have better secrets. You can trust me.
tell me.
okay, but this is not something I would tell anyone else.
there was this special needs kid in the grade above me, Benny.
he wore his hat squashed down really low, and his ears stuck out.
and he was always carrying around this basketball and going...
and, one day, I was in fourth grade,
I saw that he was holding his penis.
so, I just went back to my friends.
well, later my dad picked me up.
and he was distracted, just not really listening, and...
and I don't know why, but...
I said, "Dad, this boy at school made me look at his penis.
wait. What was his name? - Benny.
we actually got their address and drove to their house.
and Benny's mom answers the door. I mean, she was old.
she has these two long, skinny gray braids. And my dad's yelling.
and she starts crying. "I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?
and he says, "I expect you to speak to your son.
and then right behind her is Benny with his stupid basketball, going...
and my dad just stops.
cause he had a little brother like that who died.
Oh, my God.
so we get back in the car and my dad is just silent.
and then he says, "I think you knew "you were leaving out the most important part.
and I just felt horrible.
you know, I didn't really know any of that was gonna happen.
I just wanted his attention.
have you lost your mind?
I thought about... I thought about calling.
I... But I didn't wanna wake you. - You can't just show up here, Daniel.
somebody's gotta mow the lawn. I don't mind.
well, I'll pay somebody.
you know? I mean, this is my home. You cannot just arrive here without asking.
what if I had somebody staying over?
are you seeing someone? - Put the mower away.
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.
I just missed hearing what's going on here.
Allegra, she acts like she hates me, and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy, they call from school, but they don't say much.
they're ashamed of their father.
so Diego says you told him the handle on the shower's loose?
thirty seconds. - I'll deal with it.
is there something in the house you don't want me to see?
do you think I'm not taking care of the house?
no, no... - You wanna do what a husband does?
you wanna fix things?
you can't fix this.
you're not my husband.
all that's gone now. - Can I call you next weekend?
no, you cannot call me next weekend. - Okay.
I'll check in with you, okay?
my mom said I could buy a motorcycle if I paid for it myself.
it's her one stipulation, right?
so I work at the mall.
and I have that whole Kerouac thing planned for this summer, and now it's, "No.
I'm 18 years old. I have the right to buy a motorcycle.
but you had a motorcycle once.
and you ended up hating it.
remember, Trey?
remember? You used to park it on the other side of the gym.
it was red and black. And...
you got really tired of taking care of it.
What're you talking about?
that was my mom's technique when I wanted something.
she'd say, "But you had a birthday party last year.
remember? We had a big cake "with pink icing and roses all over it.
and you hated it.
and she was totally messing with you?
it got her out of giving me a birthday party. - Wow.
I mean, I have wonderful memories of balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.
and it never happened. That's pretty messed up.
we certainly can't have a big party like that every year, can we?
so, when did you finally figure it out?
well, by then she had this other trick.
so suggest something to me. Something you'd like to do.
okay. Um...
let's get a room.
let's not get a room and just say we did.
then we give up?
you weren't a very persistent kid, were you?
Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me. - Why?
because you're a teacher?
I... We can't do this.
let's get out of here.
we'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.
let's not and just wish we did.
I don't wanna pretend.
um, we're late.
just give me a second.
God.
does this place seem creepy? - It's quiet.
wow, Sylvia, you look great! - Hottie!
it's the new me.
Hey, how's Corinne doing? - Great.
so, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights on Northanger Abbey?
stop it. He might surprise you.
I hope his couch has arrived. - Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.
passing around cans of aerosol cheese? - Stop it. Fine.
Grigg is a grownup. I'm sure he's made it very nice.
all right.
welcome. Please come in.
whoa. - Grigg? Whoa!
apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.
no, it's Northanger Abbey! It's Gothic! - Right!
no one gets out alive!
I don't like this. I don't like this. - Sylvia, Sylvia!
Grigg? Grigg? Grigg? - Sylvia, it's a joke.
he's just having fun... - Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!
it's okay. It's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
look. - It's a send-up of Northanger.
it's a program. - Bernadette, that's your phone.
this is my remote. And everything's on sensors.
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean. Is Prudie running late?
what do you do on Hallowe'en? - Oh, Hallowe'en is big.
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger. You should come over for Hallowe'en.
wait. - Oh, that's terrible.
I got inspired reading The Mysteries of Udolpho.
you know, the book in Northanger Abbey that Catherine's obsessed with reading?
you read The Mysteries of Udolpho? - Food!
Hey, Grigg, that color almost works. - When did you...
he read The Mysteries of Udolpho. - Wow.
wait, that book they were reading in the book? That's a real book?
Yeah, with the black veils and Laurentina's skeleton.
didn't you think that sounded great? - Yeah, it sounded awesome.
Dean, I'm so sorry. Prudie must be devastated.
Prudie said to ask you.
she's supposed to talk or something, about some book?
persuasion.
we don't know how long we're gonna be down in San Diego, so...
she may have to cancel.
tell her we'll save Persuasion for the end.
it's better to do it last, anyway. It was Austen's final book.
I thought Northanger Abbey was the final book.
written first. Published last. - That makes much more sense.
Why? - What happened with her?
cause it's a novel about novels.
you know? You see Austen as the young writer, questioning herself.
who's a heroine? What makes a good story?
are novels a waste of time? Am I gonna write? What should I write about?
I like that. - That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.
Thanks.
Prudie's mother died.
what? - Jesus.
she got into her car yesterday, this was in San Diego.
she made a left coming out of a parking lot into oncoming traffic.
Jesus. - Terrible.
were Prudie and her mom close? - Well, there was tension.
what do we think? Is Persuasion too depressing to take on right now, with the dead mother and everything?
she doesn't die on the page.
even Sense and Sensibility, the dad dies.
what about Pride and Prejudice?
I could use a little encounter in the woods with Mr. Darcy right now.
are we all up for a little romance? - Ready.
I think we're all overdue. And it'll be better for Prudie.
I still can't believe you read The Mysteries of Udolpho, Grigg.
Bravo, Grigg. Bravo. - Yay for the grilled artichokes.
you can move in with us any time, Grigg. - Please, don't bring skeletons.
she loves these.
are you and Grigg seeing each other?
no. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously. That was the plan, right?
I don't wanna fight, okay?
I don't know why you didn't just take her back to the car and have sex with her. I mean, clearly you wanted to.
I talked to her... I talked to her for like five minutes.
longer. Longer, Dean.
and with those ridiculous plastic boobs. Is that what you go for?
Prudie, you know, I was just trying to be nice to your friend.
okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead.
and you hit on her!
I do... I do... - You hit on her!
I was not hitting on her.
you know, when I was in the 10th grade,
I wrote an entire paper on Julius Caesar in iambic pentameter.
and Chloe Baher removed it from my locker and she read it aloud to the whole class.
and everyone laughed at me.
baby, high school's over.
high school's never over.
and turning 'round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me."
I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies "'who are slighted by other men.
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, "'for you are wasting your time with me."'
you know, I don't know if we can do Pride and Prejudice next week, because it's the library dinner.
well, we need to go for Sylvia. Daniel's bringing Pam.
that's so unnecessary. - Tell me about it.
his firm's buying a table. - Well, then we should buy one.
all of us, the book club.
show up in force. - Yes.
the Central Valley River City All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,
is what Grigg calls it.
he's so funny. I'm so glad he finally made a date with Sylvia.
he's taking her to lunch.
I sure hope there's some dancing in this thing.
I'm trying to diet.
my husband is bringing a date to my fundraiser.
Yeah, re-reading Pride and Prejudice again,
I keep thinking, "You know, courtship is easy.
Where's Austen's novel on divorce? - I wouldn't say it was easy.
depends who you're courting, I guess.
does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone? - Occasionally.
she used to date my husband in high school.
then she sort of gave him to me.
Daniel's the one that first bought Jocelyn a dog.
she traded your husband for a dog? - Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...
if loving is letting go, then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey.
do you know Lynne from my writing group?
I don't, actually. Allegra. - Hey.
listen, I just have to say, you have been so good for Corinne.
ever since you two have been together, she's been writing nonstop.
didn't you just love that story that she wrote last week?
well, Allegra and I don't discuss what I'm working on.
okay.
dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret "that we must decline to publish the three short stories you sent us.
Benny's Basketball" is strong narratively, "but the depiction of your penis-waving retarded boy felt a little unkind.
and isn't the title "Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious "as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?
yet we confess that "Skydiver" puzzled us most.
why would a beautiful, self-centered young lesbian jump out of a plane?
I thought we could drive together.
we should hurry. I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.
sahara, off. - Sylvia's already at the library.
she said she had to get there early. - So you offered her a ride first.
no, she happened to mention it at lunch.
that's a great dress.
stay.
I converted it to biodiesel. So it basically runs on donut grease.
this is so great. I never get to drive it.
or vacuum it, apparently.
I like your hair.
you need to dance with Sylvia tonight.
you do know how to dance, don't you? - Of course I do.
I have three older sisters. I can dance.
wait, if we stay in this lane, we're gonna be late.
given that I have to convert donut grease into biofuel every time I fill up the tank, I just try not to drive very fast.
we're barely moving.
you ever read those Le Guin books I bought you?
I prefer books about real people.
okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real and people in science fiction aren't.
is that it?
science fiction books have people in them, but they're not about the people.
real people are complicated.
well, there's all kinds of science fiction.
when you've read some, I will be interested in your opinion.
why are you getting off here? - I enjoy seeing the river.
what are you, Mark Twain?
now we're gonna get stuck at every light.
look at the talent in this room.
half the Silicon Valley is here.
to romance.
Hi. - Hello.
I'm planning on meeting a software baron and moving to Pemberley.
well, everyone knows a rich man is eventually going to want a new wife.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dean.
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.
uh, moral support. She's had a rough couple of weeks.
well, you're welcome to join in, Dean. - Nah, that's okay.
I think I'll just head to the bar. Let you ladies talk.
there is no bar. It's a library.
serving liquor. - Well, that'll work.
you guys need anything?
we had this big fight on the way over here.
have some champagne. - Mom?
I broke up with Corinne.
Oh, my God. Honey.
nice. - We have plenty of time.
honey, whatever happened between you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.
you don't even know what she did. - Did she hit you?
did she say cruel things?
you are so quick to love. You're too quick.
you jump in, you jump out. That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.
it's not working? Well... Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?
we don't just dispose of people we love. You stay. You repair.
okay, you know what? This is not you and Daddy.
this is Corinne. The difference being that Daddy actually loves you.
so you go repair. Power on.
maybe Daddy'll give up this woman he's been fucking.
Allegra. - But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.
we're gonna be so late. - I'll call a cab.
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel walks into that library with Pam.
you got your phone?
I'll find a payphone.
are you attracted to Sylvia?
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.
she's more than nice. She's smart and funny...
and she's in love with her husband. - Well, she needs to get over that.
why don't you stop interfering? Let Sylvia work out her own life.
it's interfering to want my best friend to be happy.
if that's interfering, I hope I never stop.
what about me? Am I your friend?
or am I just some widget to help you make Sylvia feel better about herself?
why did you invite me to be part of your book club?
what went through your mind the first time you saw me?
there's a man who is dying to read every book Jane Austen ever wrote.
is that what you thought? - No.
but I thought, "What a beautiful woman. I hope she looks over at me.
I thought if I read your favorite books that you would read mine.
but, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.
that's why you have dogs.
for such a famously romantic story,
pride and Prejudice is a parade of bizarre marriages.
I've had every marriage in this book.
my first husband was a politician. He was embarrassed by every move I made.
he said I was rude and loud.
stop pointing your breasts everywhere," he'd say to me.
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.
I married the first man who looked at me.
you don't see your own marriage until it's too late.
so, um... I actually thought that Charlotte Lucas was gay.
really, I think that when she tells Lizzie she's not as romantic as she is,
I think that's what she means.
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not. She just... She just has no options.
wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay or Charlotte is gay and Austen is not aware of it?
I just love the idea of a character having a secret life that the author doesn't even know about.
you know, frankly, I kind of admire Charlotte for looking at her situation and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.
I mean, yes, yes, she knows he'll never be the "love of her life,
but that's okay.
that is exactly the reason that Jocelyn would hate her.
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone who settles for anything less than the perfect love.
you know, it's probably why Jocelyn has never married.
my apologies, everybody.
hello. - Hi.
we ran out of donut grease.
Grigg Harris. - Dean Drummond.
wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club? - Yeah.
no, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg," and I just didn't picture it as a guy.
so you thought Grigg was a girl?
Dean thinks "Austen" is the capital of Texas.
Wow.
you'll notice that Jane, she never shows what happens after the wedding.
maybe Elizabeth and Darcy start hating each other.
maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley, and she turned into this crazy person, like her mom, because our mothers are like time bombs.
they just... They tick away inside of us.
let's not give Mrs. Bennet more importance than she deserves.
you know, I mean, what about the father? - What father?
you know, my mom showed me a picture of a guy in uniform.
well, maybe she made him up.
or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.
and I kept it in my room, this...
I kept it in my room.
let's not do this now, okay?
Dean, I got it.
Bernadette.
Daniel never came.
good.
I'm in love with one of my students.
but I mean, nothing's happened. Much.
but it could.
it could, if I let it.
I fantasize about him constantly.
sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.
he looks at me like he's the spoon, and I'm the dish of ice cream.
it's a good thing we're reading Sense and Sensibility next.
I love you so. - But how can you be sure in just one day?
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in or out of love, she knows it right away.
you think you're in love with me? - Think?
what good does thinking do but what I feel is something else?
Hey, you got your cast off. - Yeah.
how does it feel? - Great.
you can reach it. Just really stretch your arm out.
there you go. Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.
you can do it, there... Can you put your...
can you put your right foot in that blue thing?
it's gonna be fine.
here, hang on. - You can reach it.
just reach up. - It's caught.
it's okay. You're doing good.
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt. It's nothing.
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.
it's not likely to be anything more than a concussion.
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation for a few days, okay?
and if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.
how many times have we had to come here to get her stitched up?
it's always Allegra, never the boys. - Well, she's the one who goes mountain climbing and skateboarding and snowboarding.
it's a miracle she never tried parachuting.
she's so extreme.
one minute she's crazy in love with Corinne, the next minute she's never hated anybody more.
she's gonna be okay, right? - She's fine.
she just took a knock on the noodle.
this is gonna sound, probably, horrible, considering the fact that she's got this lump on her head, but... It's just...
it's great to have us all in the same room again.
just feels so normal.
normal, yeah.
you know, I haven't been seeing Pam for a couple of months now.
so, that must be a big change.
you know, I was thinking just this morning about this book club that we're in, Allegra and me.
the first meeting was...
Yeah, we had just been separated. 'Cause Allegra had just moved in.
and I was realizing how different I feel.
I don't think I'm the same woman that you left.
I can see that. I so see that.
well, it's probably the same for you.
I guess that's what happens when you let go.
we did a good job taking things apart.
I'm kind of proud of us.
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.
you two just keep it together for one more book.
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.
Austen sets up this juicy triangle between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.
and then at the end, she practically has to whip a rabbit out of a hat to make Lucy Steele run off with Edward's brother?
Yeah, that requires some hand-waving. - I think the ending's well-plotted.
to me, the part that seems forced is Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.
anyone else feel that? - Oh, I have no problem with that.
he rides up on a big stallion, sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.
from the time Colonel Brandon meets Marianne, he just lavishes all this attention on her.
and meanwhile, she's throwing herself at Willoughby.
Willoughby is a player.
women never go for the nice guy.
please. Men say that, but you get to know some of these men who complain the most, you find out they're not as nice as they like to think they are.
okay. You know what struck me?
is that Colonel Brandon is only a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.
well, why does he take up with the daughter and not the mother?
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?
maybe Mrs. Dashwood won't give him the time of day.
the book is about the young people. - Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks that nothing interesting can happen to a woman over 25.
when actually, a novel about a woman seducing a slightly younger man just yields so much more.
well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood should go for Willoughby.
why not?
it's a long, hot summer.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood has more sense than that.
okay, can I just point out, she's hardly in the story.
sex is messy.
maybe Mrs. Dashwood prefers a more well-ordered life.
maybe that's why she's such a minor character.
I think if you read Austen's novels... - Oh, I have.
you wanted me to, and I did.
I think you'll see she always writes in favor of order and self-control.
nothing unwise. - Nothing in haste.
okay, so, this is... This is what, this is a rulebook?
we could do worse.
I think Jane Austen wrote about women falling in love because she was Ionely.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.
Austen lived a very full life. She could've gotten married anytime.
she almost did. - That's right.
but she decided not to. - Why, too messy? Too out of control?
his name was Harris Bigg-Wither, and they were engaged for one night.
Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither!" I can't believe you know that.
I understand why Colonel Brandon goes for Marianne.
and it's not 'cause she's young.
it's because she's generous with herself.
she's willing to risk her heart. No rules, no fear.
and Willoughby tramples her. - She just picked the wrong guy.
no rules, no fear.
I like that.
Hi. - You're wearing that to your book club?
it's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day, 'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme, which is, you know, like, the beach in England.
this is your last one, right?
I think we're gonna do some more books after this one.
Prudie's gonna be hours late and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.
thank God it's the last meeting.
Yes, there's getting to be a little too much plot.
not that I blame Grigg.
something about reading Austen sort of makes you wanna get it on.
Hi.
started reading it with Allegra at the hospital. This is a great book.
are you joining our discussion?
am I? 'Cause I'd like to. - Hi.
Daniel wants to join us. - Well he's not in the club, is he?
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen. So far.
it's all about mistakes and second chances.
Yeah, you can stay.
glass of wine?
I can't believe he brought a date to our last meeting.
I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling. - For me?
honey, I took your boyfriend away from you in high school.
look how that turned out.
Hi. - Hey.
how ya doing? - Guys, this is Cat.
hello. - I'm Grigg's big sister.
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so... I'm... God, that's wonderful.
you're Grigg's sister. I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.
how are you? - Hi.
good, thank you. - Hi. Bernadette.
I don't believe it. - Look at you!
you look great. - Good to see you.
thank you.
wow, are you visiting from Idaho? - Yeah, yeah.
we kept seeing these emails. And we said, "What kind of strange power "do these women have that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?
just thought I'd check it out. You wanna take a walk?
well, sure.
excuse me.
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!
Hi. - Dr. Yep?
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.
I'm sorry we're late. - Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.
is that Dad?
let's say hi. - Okay.
a doctor.
nothing in haste.
dad! Hi! - Hey.
would you do me a favor?
would you read this?
please. Right now.
isn't that what your special little book club's for?
I really want you to read it.
please, Dean.
it doesn't... They don't...
Prudie, I feel like you want me to be something that I'm not.
I just walk around being me. I don't pretend to be anything else.
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen" is a city in Texas.
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.
you just set me up for a test that you don't want me to pass.
no, no. This is not a test.
this is something to share.
why don't you just tell me what it's about?
it's about these two people who used to love each other.
and they don't anymore.
and it's how they persuade themselves to give it another try.
look, I can get you started off. Okay?
sir Walter Eliot... - Prudie
of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire was a man who...
for his own amusement, never took up any book but the...
come on, you're really not gonna read all of this out loud.
one page.
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one.
come on. - So I've been trying to figure out that moment in Persuasion when Wentworth and Anne just began to stop hating each other.
maybe it's when they went with everyone to Lyme.
after Louisa Musgrove fell.
after Wentworth used her to make Anne jealous.
you think he was using Louisa?
Yeah. That's one interpretation.
I think the guy was just trying to feel... - Valued again.
it was a bonehead move.
I mean, he knows he's nothing without Anne.
he loved her then, he loves her now.
I like how Austen always lets the men explain themselves.
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, and Frank writes to Emma.
Yeah, in Persuasion, everything hangs on Wentworth leaving her that note - when everybody's talking all around them. - Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.
no, smart guy. Perfect timing.
Yeah.
let us never underestimate the power of a well-written letter.
Grigg has always loved dogs.
you know, we were never allowed to have one when we were kids.
dogs and books. That's our Grigg.
okay, he'd kill me for saying this, but my brother likes you.
I'm figuring he'll never tell you. And this way it's up to you.
my sisters and me, I wouldn't say we ruined him, but he's just way too considerate to make the first move.
Hey. - Hey.
I was just wishing that Austen had written a bunch more books, you know?
I'm gonna miss this.
all of the ladies were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, "excepting Louisa.
she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
she was safely down and instantly, to show her enjoyment, "ran up the steps to be jumped down again.
he advised her against it, but no...
shoot.
I'm so sorry. I should've called first. I read these books.
I love them.
I couldn't stop reading.
I went to the all-night newsstand on State Street to buy Searoad, the next one, - but they didn't have it, and... - Do you wanna borrow Searoad?
I mean, I have... You know, there...
there are other writers that you might like.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
wait, wait, wait.
Hey, has anyone read those Patrick O'Brian novels?
british Navy. - Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?
there's more of us now. - I'm in.
Oh, my God, is that Bernadette? - I thought she was in Costa Rica.
buenas noches, everyone. This is Senor Obando.
Hola. - Hello.
hello. - He's working on his English.
I'm working on my Spanish. - Hello.
and so far I have te amo.
and mi esposo.
Oh, my God! - Congratulations!
that's incredible! - That's incredible. Congratulations!
Oh, it's gorgeous. - Thank you.
I'm so happy for you. - Congratulations.
dad, check it out. - Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.
don't be gone too long. - Yikes. That makes seven.
what? - Yeah.
Hey, guys. Guys.
he hasn't read a word of Austen.
Oh, poor man.
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.
Cheers! - Cheers!
Hey.
Bye!
bouquet? Bouquet.
beautiful, isn't it?
but let me tell you the truth.
for a lot of people, marriage is like sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.
it looks like fun when you see friends doing it, so you say:
Hey, I'll give it a try. Just once.
next thing you know, you're stuck.
full of regret.
praying, "Please get me out of this with my dignity...
...if least not my extremities, intact.
but it doesn't have to be like that, my friends.
it does not have to be like that.
that's where I come in.
good marriages are my business.
meeting the right person in the first place?
well, my friends, that is up to you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll go. - Yeah, you go. Okay.
Hi. I'm Sadie. - Hi. Ben.
from that first, destined meeting...
...to the sweet innocence of the first date.
are you skipping to second base? - What's that? No.
you know why? I'm not a skipper.
maybe we should take care of first base, just to make things right.
the first kiss.
the first time you say "I love you.
I love you. - What?
what? A view. What a view.
first time you say "I love you," and she actually hears you.
I love you.
I'm afraid you're not my type. - I love you too.
you seriously didn't think I was gonna let you see that?
let's skip to the next thing: Moving in together.
the first time she finds something you don't want her to see.
don't worry, I got the heavy ones. - "Dear Mr. Brian Boitano.
Oh, God! - "Congratulations on your triple Axel.
I wonder how much you practice every week...
...and also how you make your hair stay like that.
Hey, he was a legend. Okay?
I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.
I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box. Okay.
if she doesn't dump your wussy ass after that...
...then comes the big one: The proposal.
Sadie...
...you're a great girl. You are.
and I think it's time that you and I were man and...
lame. That is so lame.
we are so pleased all of you could be here with us today...
...to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.
Cheers.
Cheers.
it is especially gratifying to be surrounded by such good friends...
...and family...
...and of course, our two beautiful daughters...
...Sadie...
...and Lindsey...
...who has moved back home with us...
...to try and make a new start for herself.
we are...
...so thrilled with her perseverance.
thank you for the support, Dad.
and then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...
what? - What?
...when they were younger, and pretend he was a submarine captain.
I destroyed all the photos. I promise you.
thank you. Very good to know. Thanks. - Wait, what?
and our good friends, Don and Gwen...
...Kwan-Li...
...Jerry, Otis.
dad...
...what about...
what about Ben? - Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, and of course, there's Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.
but what I really want to do...
...is thank my beautiful wife...
...without whom this life would mean nothing.
happy 30th anniversary.
I love you. - I love you too.
and I hope there are 30 more.
well, that makes one of us.
excuse me. Could I have everyone's attention, please?
I just wanted to...
well, I thought since everyone was gathered...
...gathered already...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Sadie... - Oh, my God, oh, my God.
...Wilhelmina Jones.
in front of God and your family...
...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and...
I just want to know...
...if you would spend the rest of your life with me.
but I don't...
I don't want to put you on the spot or anything.
benjamin Murphy, I would marry you tomorrow in a potato-sack dress...
...in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant I could spend the rest of my life with you.
wait a second.
you choose our 30th wedding anniversary to propose to my daughter?
well...
...we couldn't be happier.
Oh, my gosh.
I know.
new brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.
Oh, man. Hey, hello. - Awkward.
welcome. - Thank you.
welcome to the family, Ben. - Sir. All right!
Oh, my baby. - Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.
look at this beautiful ring.
Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking...
I think we should have the wedding somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...
...the Caribbean.
I have this one thing.
okay.
I always wanted to get married here.
here. What do you mean?
at Saint Augustine's.
it's this fantasy I've had since I was a little girl.
it's the church where John and I married.
where Sadie was christened by Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.
more importantly, it's the church Sadie's grandfather built.
her dead grandfather.
Oh, give me a break. All he built was a door after it was stolen.
how would you know? You weren't married there.
and we all know how that marriage turned out.
mom!
stop. - Here, here, here, here.
babe, you've made me so unbelievably happy today.
you have no idea.
great. - Yeah.
...is the decision. - Thank you, I love you.
you ready? - I'm missing a shoe.
well, where did you last see it? - I don't know.
you know, Ben, your sweater's actually inside out?
gotta fix that.
what would you do without me?
you want the short list or the long list?
Oh, and your belt?
it's a little funny. - No, my belt's fine.
wait a minute.
we're gonna be really late. - No, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
and your point is?
how do I look?
you look like you've just been... - All right, never mind.
we're so going to hell, you know that?
Hey, here's the door Grandpa built. - Wow, he does really good work.
don't touch that!
Jesus! You scared me.
Jesus didn't scare you, I did.
Hi, I'm Sadie... - Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.
you have a 10: 30 with Reverend Frank.
Yeah. Is he here?
Reverend Frank is everywhere.
follow me.
dear ELLE magazine:
I just found out that my husband of three months...
...is cheating on me with my best friend.
half of me wants to kill him, the other half wants to salvage my marriage.
what to do?
Yikes.
what kind of sins are we dealing with here, guys?
Sarah. - Thou shall not commit adultery?
adultery. Going out for milk when you have jugs at home.
show me adultery!
not neat to cheat! Okay!
now, a lot of people ask me:
what if I'm cheating with a woman who's really, really ugly?
does that make it all right?
no, it does not make it all right. It is still a sin.
what other sins? Anybody?
don't hesitate to draw on your parents' bad examples.
Laurie. Bring it, girl. - Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.
starts with coveting, ends with the clap.
okay, coveting thy neighbor's wife.
that's why God invented the cold shower. Show me coveting!
good one, Laurie!
okay, there's one answer left on the board. Let's see.
Manny.
make your two moms proud.
come on, Manny, you can murder this one.
while I'm waiting, maybe I'll just fashion a shiv out of Cindy's barrette.
take a stab at it.
thou shall not kill?
boom, Manny! Bang, bang, bang!
show me thou shall not kill!
Oh, good one, Manny! Manny, Manny, Manny.
that's it for today.
next we're gonna take a trip to Arlington Park.
we're gonna find out about the evils of gambling firsthand.
so bring at least a dollar...
...and remember to ask Mom and Dad what a trifecta is.
I don't know if you remember me, Reverend Frank, but...
Sadie Jones?
little Sadie Jones.
how you've grown. - Well, yeah.
and now my Sadie Jones is gonna tie the knot.
I am.
I'm sorry I haven't been around for the last...
ten years.
Yeah.
I've just been trying to get my business...
Oh, please.
you go to college, you have a bisexual roommate...
...you forget about God. Don't sweat it.
he doesn't forget about you.
who are you?
I'm Ben.
Ben. - Hi.
so, what do you do, besides little Sadie here?
how are you?
all right, let's get the flock out of here. Come on.
so, how long you two been an item?
about... - Like...
Yeah!
it's been teetering there for weeks.
cheesy Curl? - No, thank you.
too bad, they're addicting.
booked. - Booked. Booked.
nothing there or there.
I am popular.
Yes, you are.
all full. Not looking good. No.
no, no, no.
Nope, nope, nope. - Booked, booked, booked.
bad news, guys.
next available date is in two years. - Two years?
that's...
...so long. - Yeah.
wait.
hold on, hold on. - Wasn't there a cancellation?
I think it's... - There, there!
Yes, there it is.
three weeks from tomorrow, how is that?
that's a little quick. Right? I mean...
okay, I guess we're getting married in three weeks.
okay.
just like that? - Yeah.
so it is written, so it shall be done. - So it shall be done.
Oh, boy.
all right.
one small thing.
couple years ago I instituted a marriage preparation course here.
the course is a prerequisite for all marriage ceremonies...
...performed on these grounds.
at the end of the course, if I feel you're unprepared...
...or you stop the course before completion, I have the right to call off the wedding.
I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right? Because we're so ready to get married.
more than most. - We strongly advise it.
in other words, you have no choice.
with the divorce rate what it is...
50 percent.
much higher for those who live together first.
you did say you lived together, right?
I'm sorry, who are you again?
I'm part of the Ministers of Tomorrow program.
Reverend Frank's my mentor.
my little Mensa.
I can see. - Listen, kids.
we wanna make sure you are making the right decision...
...because your future happiness depends on it.
Reverend Frank has a hundred percent success...
...for those that make it through the course.
but what about the people who...? - Okay, we'll do it.
we're gonna do it. - We're doing that?
it's awesome. - We're doing this.
that's my Sadie.
all right, we have three months of prep to cram into three weeks.
there's only a few rules.
rule number one: You each have to write your own vows.
you have a booklet, and you share these vows...
...with each other at the ceremony.
that's really cool. - Isn't it?
okay. What's rule number two?
starting immediately, no sex until the honeymoon.
I...
are you serious?
Oh, yeah.
tomorrow morning, bright and early.
be there.
we all remember the 11th Commandment.
I don't.
thou shall not be late.
we've got a hundred things to start, but it's doable.
I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.
he was kidding about the no-sex thing? - Carlisle? It's me. Get ready for this.
we will talk about the no-sex thing later. - Okay, Ben.
no sex?
that's supposed to happen after you get married.
Joel, I come here...
...for your compassion. - I'm just giving you shit.
Congratulations. You are going to love marriage.
damn it, Joel. What is wrong with you?
you were supposed to be watching them.
Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.
remember we said you won't bother me when I'm on the roof?
you're always on the roof. - Exactly.
I heard that. - Yeah.
where did this mud hole even come from?
Oh, my God, I am so getting my tubes tied.
this reverend says he wants me to meet him after church tomorrow one-on-one.
what is that?
you ever done that? The marriage prep stuff?
to tell you the truth, I don't remember anything before D-day, man.
it's like a black hole.
all I know is that's my wife...
...apparently those are my kids...
...and this, this is my beer.
everything else is pretty much a blur.
Yeah.
thank you.
that's why you're my best man.
two words for your bachelor party:
strippers and Sizzler.
I like to call it "beef and booty.
I heard that.
Oh, boy.
please, God, let somebody be later than us.
Hey. We'll just sneak in the back, no one will notice.
we also ask...
...that you watch over the Mansbridge meat packers and their labor dispute.
grant our packers patience as they await an amicable resolution...
...with, Lord willing, a four to six percent pay increase...
...and dental would be nice.
look who decided to show.
choir! Let me hear it!
you're late, you're late You're late, you're late
God's on time
but you are very late
it's your first offense. We'll let it slide.
it happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.
and I'm not talking about Larry Carmichael over there on drums.
but seriously...
...Let us re-pray.
sorry for bailing, Lord. A brief interruption, but we're back.
we'd also like to pray for Walter...
...recently returned from his holiday in Thailand.
let's hope it's just a heat rash.
Vivian. - I don't know how you do it, Frank.
every week your sermons get better and better.
it comes from upstairs, Vivian. I'm just the TiVo.
it wasn't that good.
you ready? - Yeah.
I have to go. I have stuff to do...
...but you guys enjoy your man-talk, okay?
don't say anything about me behind my back.
you'll never know so...
tight.
sorry? - The car.
Hi. - Bye.
you ready? A little one-on-one?
Yeah. - Come on. Let's go.
the name of our team is the Crusaders.
I didn't want to tell the kids about the Children's Crusades, it bums them out.
wow, you really meant one-on-one.
Oh, yeah.
a little hoops? - No.
this ball needs Viagra.
play catch? - Sure, love catch.
it's my favorite sport.
pardon the glove. We've had a few budget cutbacks.
Oh, that's all right. - Back up.
okay.
what are you, a little girl's softball league? Back up.
okay. Not a little girl.
Yeah. - All right.
it's nice to be able to chat with you...
...without all this "I'm a pastor who can send you to hell" nonsense.
no, me too. This is great.
little one-on-one time with your spiritual elder.
bless you, Benjamin.
too hard? - No. That's a...
that's a good burn. Right?
anything that's painful makes you stronger.
not really. You break your leg, your leg doesn't get stronger.
God is just, but God is kind.
that's a nice sentiment.
thank you. Can I ask you something?
sure. - Sadie.
why do you love her?
there's just so many reasons, you know?
she's beautiful, inside and out.
so, I'm lucky.
what do you mean by "inside"?
you meant spiritually, right?
Yep. Exactly.
okay. What else?
she's just smart, you know? She's motivated, she's well-organized.
she's probably the hardest worker I know.
well, let me get this straight, then. Correct me if I'm wrong.
first thing you like about her is her looks. But you really think...
...She's a cute control freak. - I didn't say that.
I know what you're getting at. - "Organized" is code for OCD.
OCD is a...
God!
Oh, my Lord.
you okay, big fella? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
how you doing... - Totally fine.
let's see that. Come on. Oh, no. That's bad.
I'm gonna have to heal you.
no, that's okay. - No. I'm gonna have to heal you.
I just need Advil. - It's healing time. Stay down.
stay down. It's healing time.
what's that mean? - Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, Lord, surround him with your light and grace.
lord have mercy!
the power of Christ compels you! - Lord have mercy.
the power of Christ compels you!
we have got to pray! - Pray!
we have got to pray! - Pray!
we have got to pray to make it through the day!
is that MC Hammer?
you're healed, right? - Let me see. Let me see.
no, it's still bleeding. - Let's go old school.
begone, demon spirit!
Begone!
that's not helping at all. - Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Lord, take him up upon your wing...
wait, take me where? - Lf you believed, you'd be healed.
do you believe? - Believe!
believe! - I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.
Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle! - It is. It is.
you're not healed. I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.
you know what you need? Advil and ice. Come on.
check him out, just see that he's okay. - The nasal septum and concha are clear.
good news, kid. Your nose is fine. - Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.
sorry about that. You know, I have to try that stuff.
never works, but what if it had? - Yeah.
wouldn't that be crazy? - Crazy.
it was great.
Yes, totally. Reverend Frank is the best.
listen, tomorrow night, I was th...
group counseling for what?
okay, like we do every week.
Danny, pick up Tenika and carry her across that threshold.
Yeah, that's it!
try and think of it like the first time.
for a lot of you, that wasn't the honeymoon.
Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.
my back is giving out.
don't focus on the pain.
look at the love that Janine's giving you right now.
and if that doesn't work, think about potato skins.
God, I love potato skins.
a husband will do anything for appetizers.
Yes.
everybody, I want to introduce you to two new members.
this is Ben and Sadie. They're getting married in three weeks.
Ben, why don't you carry Sadie across the threshold?
come on.
come on. Yeah, come on.
Yeah, there you go. Get across that threshold!
hurry.
Oh, great. - Look.
got it.
tonight...
...we learn how to fight fairly.
sorry.
what if we've never had a fight before?
seriously think I'm gonna puke. - Louise, no puking.
they're young. They're allowed to be enthusiastic.
never had a fight, it's about time you had one.
so please, step up to the top of the circle.
come on, get your butts up there!
let's get this perfect relationship on its feet.
put it to the test. Okay.
I want you to imagine.
you're driving in the mountains. It's nighttime.
but there's a torrential downpour.
that thing with the wipers like this:
you're tired. You're lost.
you're getting cranky.
what was that?
you got a flat tire because you just hit a pothole.
instant argument potential.
what do you do? How do you handle it?
I think we'd probably just call AAA.
out of cell phone range. Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.
you gotta handle it the old-fashioned way. You gotta change the tire.
you're pissed at each other. Go.
sorry I didn't see that pothole.
it's okay, honey.
accidents happen, so just be more careful next time.
promise I will. - Cut!
you guys travel medicated? That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation.
that's not what we're looking for.
Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show them how this argument should play out?
sure.
Hey, jackass!
I told you to take Route 45, but again, you didn't listen!
now it's pissing down outside and we're stuck God only knows where.
Yeah, well, if we hadn't left three hours late...
...because someone was talking to her ball-busting mother on the phone...
...well, then, maybe we wouldn't be in this position!
you are a sad, sad man.
you will not emasculate me anymore.
go to hell! - No, you go to hell, Janine.
go to hell. - Okay. Cut.
everybody, Jim and Janine.
we're gonna try something a little different now.
we're gonna do role reversal.
all right.
Sadie, I want you to be Ben.
Ben, I want you to be Sadie. Come on. Step up there.
come on, get up! Yeah!
Oh, gosh. - Come on.
you're gonna change the tire.
Ben, tire's down here.
you're down in that muck. Here's your lug wrench.
the lugs are right here. But they're tight.
they're rusty, they're old, all right? You can't get them off and you're angry...
...and you're cold, and you really... You wanna tear each other apart.
go.
don't you wish we were in cell-phone range?
then we could just call AAA like we always do.
Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost. - I don't either.
Ben, maybe we wouldn't have gotten lost...
...if you had just followed the TripTik that I prepared three days in advance.
well, I thought that I was following the road signs pretty well.
just going with the flow, as usual.
what was that? What was that last thing?
I'm just going along for the ride.
who was? You. As me.
well, I'm not really sure how anything gets done...
...if people aren't following my very specific instructions, Ben.
but I love it when you're in charge.
that way I don't have to take too much responsibility, Sadie.
Ben, don't you know that that's the only way things get done around here?
that's how things get done around here? Good.
I had no idea.
thank you. - Want me to show you?
he said counter... - I think I have it under control!
dear Jesus!
potato skins down! - Jim, Jim...
come on, everybody!
five-second rule!
Janine!
okay. We'll pick up next week...
...with balancing the joint checking account.
so are you writing your vows later or?
no, I finished earlier.
Hey, what color white should we go with for the napkins?
there's ivory...
...and timid.
ivory.
I don't know, I kind of feel like it might clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.
all right, well, you know what? I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.
Yeah, you know who else you could ask? Reverend Frank.
because he loves giving his opinion.
why do you say it like that?
I don't know. Maybe because...
...he's just a little bit... - Knowledgeable.
Yeah. - "Intrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.
Ben, he's not intrusive, you know? He's just...
...observing our relationship right now.
like a voyeur. - Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.
a little bit. - No, he's not.
what was that? What are you doing?
do you want to walk the midget?
course I do, but...
...I don't think we should, because it's against the rules until after the wedding.
are you serious? - Yes.
you're actually following that rule? - Yeah.
because I want to pass the course. Don't you?
Yes, I want to pass the course. - So?
so, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me with my really hot fiancee.
okay?
come on. - What?
no one else is gonna know.
I'll know, Ben. I will know. So just...
just please...
...let's stick to the program for now. Okay? Thank you.
three weeks never killed anyone.
Really? Has that ever been documented?
good night.
good night, Ben.
okay, I'm a cigar vendor...
what? - Go to bed.
thank you.
what if I'm not tired?
Yes!
all clear.
What'd I miss? - None of your business.
but they're right on schedule. - Their optimism is touching.
they remind me of the Anderson couple we had last month.
Yeah. You know what time it is?
time to turn up the heat.
it's time to build on the foundation we've set up.
remind me never to cross you.
I mean, I'm really glad we're doing the course.
I just wish Ben would take it more seriously, you know?
what about these in my bouquet, Lindsey?
no.
no?
I just want to feel some enthusiasm from him, or is that expecting too much?
Sadie, you have so much to learn about men.
pink.
flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.
meet where?
I didn't even want to take this course...
...and now she's following it to, like, the nth degree.
where are the cheerleaders? Shouldn't they be practicing too?
come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!
coach Murphy, you were right to put him on B-squad.
get ready, Zach. - Or maybe I'm just overreacting.
I mean, give and take, that's a part of every healthy relationship.
give and what?
give and take. - Man, listen to me.
once a woman senses she has control, she'll tell a thousand of her friends.
then they'll want control too. "I want a little piece of this control stuff.
next thing you know, they'll be running companies and having their own offices.
do not set dangerous precedents for other men.
Hello?
late for what?
welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity, birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.
that's almost 80 babies a week, and we've never misplaced one.
okay, maybe one.
if you're shy, get your tubes tied now and call it a day.
a woman in labor basically lies around almost naked...
...while dozens of doctors and nurses get a front row view of her wide open...
Virginia! Put some gloves on those hands right now!
we're not delivering pizzas here.
labor could last anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
and that's not even counting the nine months of constipation leading up to it.
of course, there's always drugs...
...so you should figure out how you feel about that beforehand.
l... Oh, God!
and then be ready to toss that decision out the window...
...when the pain really kicks in.
a woman in labor wouldn't even feel that.
good to know.
or that.
this way.
you squeamish, Ben?
little bit, I guess.
you have to figure out if you're gonna be in the delivery room.
Oh, yeah, of course he will be.
Yes.
some men are so traumatized by the experience...
...they can never look at their wives the same again.
sexually, that is.
give me some slow, deep breaths.
how many do you want to have?
four? - Two?
big push. Big push.
I need an epidural!
look at her! She's breathing fine!
what about me?
they say for a man to experience the equivalent pain...
...you'd have to pull your scrotum over your head.
that was incredible.
glad you feel that way.
because now the real fun begins.
welcome to the world of parenting.
they breathe, they blink, they cry. - And they're all yours.
congratulations, you've just had twins.
look at how their little chests move up and down.
Yeah. Their creepy little chests.
and you really want four of these things?
I think it'd be nice to have a big family, don't you?
Yeah. No, no, definitely.
well, I mean...
...four might be kind of a big commitment.
okay, do you want to take that?
no, you can do it. Come on.
just pat him on the back really gently.
okay.
poor little baby.
little creepy robot baby.
Oh, my God!
God. - Hold on.
here you go. - Stop, stop.
hold on, hold on. There you go.
there's some on his shirt too. - Okay.
we can't forget to set the alarm for 8...
...because we're going to Macy's to register for the wedding.
wait, we're not bringing these with us, are we?
come on, can't we just, like, phone in our order or something?
no, we're so jammed this week, tomorrow's the only day we can do it.
look at that. Fell back asleep.
so I did it.
looks like this parenting thing isn't as hard as they say.
see? You're a natural.
Thanks.
night.
Ben? Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
okay, I'm coming.
what? Hi.
how many times do I have to knock, man? How you doing?
good. - Good morning.
Shelly's dad fell off a ladder. - What?
and unfortunately, he's gonna make it. So we have to go...
...and you are on brat patrol for a couple hours.
thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks a million.
Hi.
which one's the biter?
all you have to do is point the gun at the item you want and then pull the trigger.
the computer instantly logs it in our registry database for your guests to consider.
there's no limit to how many items I can choose?
when in doubt, zap it. - Great.
we only have a couple hours so...
Chop-chop. Come on.
okay. All right. Yep.
guys, guys, guys, slow down, slow down.
Hey. All right, that's good.
now we're going faster. Stop, stop. Hello?
all right, guys. All right.
the yelling needs to hold off. All right.
Hey, Ben, what do you like better? The blue or the beige?
the beige or the blue?
I like the blue. Blue's good. - Beige goes better... ...with the placemats.
or beige. Let's just do beige.
I love beige.
beige it is.
do you like this one? - It's great.
all right, let's get this one. - Yeah, let's get a couple.
Oh, I just got this text message from Carlisle.
I got the wrong dinnerware.
do you mean silverware? Can we just go? - No, dinnerware.
no way. That is not simulated. - God, that's bad.
well, why don't you change the diaper...
...and I'll go get the dinnerware?
why don't we think about... - Okay.
okay.
Yeah.
stop! Oh, God!
stop, stop!
should we get the 500-thread count? Ben, can you slow down a little bit?
Oh, I'm trying.
Oh, my God.
sorry. Ben?
give me one, please? - Will you take that?
I'm gonna give you one.
I will help you by getting this one thing... - I'm sorry.
guys, guys, guys, it's okay.
come here. Come on, come on. - Okay.
Ben, don't drop him!
here, take the kids. Come on, come on.
boys, let's go. Come on.
Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton or Egyptian cotton sheets.
something that really seems to breathe. I'm sorry.
I can't seem to find them over there and I have...
get off the bed. All right.
get off the bed.
enough. Okay, enough. No, no. Okay. Stop!
no, no, no. Guys, no, no, no.
just stop. Sorry. It's fine. It's just a...
stop.
stop it! Stop, you stupid... Shut up!
just shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!
Hey! What the hell are you doing?! - I'm sorry.
thank God. I've had a long day.
these are fake. Watch. See?
no, no, no, we're on our way.
we just got a little detained at Macy's. Well, Ben did.
for being a public nuisance.
it's a long story.
okay. Bye.
well, I'll tell you...
...l'm a lot more prepared for kids now.
like way more.
why are there 56 bras on here?
pour a glass of that for yourself. Have a glass.
all right, I got it. This is it. You, my dear, look amazing.
I can't believe all these cheeses.
I know. I don't even know which to start with.
there are so many. - It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.
that's about as complicated as my cheese dilemmas usually get.
I think I prefer the nutty Comte Saint-Antoine, which is this one.
all right, this is it? - From the Basque region...
...and go. Gonna change your life.
Oh, my God. Carlisle. - Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.
Ben, Carlisle's totally right. I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.
it's so good. You have to try it.
the white one? Good. - You were right. You recommended it too.
Hey, everybody. - Hey!
every time I hear the word "cheese us," I'm in.
praise Gouda.
look at all of you, you're all dressed to the nines.
Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.
Oh, thank you. - How's life after the big D?
that bad, huh?
men are a little too hard to train so...
thought I'd stop trying and live vicariously through Ben's training.
here I was thinking I was already housebroken.
maybe not.
cute. - It's refreshing...
...how honest you are. It doesn't happen...
...that easily for a lot of in-laws. - Really?
because I feel like we all get along really well.
you know what, Ben is a wonderful addition to this family.
wow, thank you.
whatever. There's a little awkwardness...
...but nothing more than just new family stuff.
you know a great way around new family awkwardness?
word association. - Excuse me?
it's fun, really. You go around the table...
...and you pick one word that best describes each in-law...
...then they pick one word that describes you.
a give and take, kind of an icebreaker... - I think it sounds so fun. I love games.
that's the spirit, Grandma.
Ben, start with Grandma.
one word to describe Grandma.
that word would be...
...wisdom.
excellent.
grandma. What about Ben?
peculiar for his age.
let's just try and stick with one word.
I'd just say peculiar. - Okay.
we have a winner. Game over. I think.
no, no, come on. What about Lindsey? - I don't wanna do it.
don't think. What's the first word comes to your mind?
go for it.
blond.
are you kidding me? - Golden.
no, gold. No, like you exude gold. Not dumb, though.
I didn't say dumb. - You didn't say dumb. You said blond.
okay. Blond Lindsey.
Oh, my tur... Okay, awesome! Yes, okay, so...
assertive.
if you need someone to take the bull by the horns, Ben's your guy.
that's a good one. Not that good.
I mean, she's laughing a little too hard for it, but good joke.
this is terrific. See how you're breaking the ice?
there's something new happening now. Take a shot at Dad.
there we go. - Sadie's dad is...
he's outgoing.
outgoing, like saying "nice." - That's very fitting.
you're not shedding any light.
come on, you can do better than this. - Yes.
let it rip. - No, no, no.
no, don't push me. I'm not gonna... - He's asking, Ben.
go, come on. - All right.
what about pompous?
I'm a little pompous. - What's the Wizard of Oz thing? Pompous.
no, I was just kidding.
no. No, no, no. It's all right. I asked for it.
I just meant somebody likes to hear the sound of their own voice.
now you're getting interesting.
pompous dad, back at Ben.
here it is. - Okay.
how about vanilla? - Whoa, mom!
called you vanilla.
could be bland, I'm not sure, but it's your call.
back at mom. Come on, Ben. - Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.
Stepfordy? Is that an adjective?
Yeah, it just describes, you know:
let's just sweep everything under the rug with a pat on the back, a smile...
...and don't forget the glass of champagne to take the edge off.
you're on a roll. Come on.
do we have any problems here? If we did, we'd just...
...throw some money at it because we all know there's nothing money can't buy.
can't buy communication like this.
Hey, Ben, I thought you were really great with my family today.
are you making fun of me?
no. No. Course not.
it sounded like you were.
I'm not making fun of you. The fact that you...
...lost your mind and embarrassed yourself in front of everyone.
no, that's not making fun of anyone.
okay. - What?
time for a punishment. Come here. - No.
what are you doing?
what does it look like I'm doing? - Something that's very against the rules.
mayday.
Hi. Just in the neighborhood...
...thought I'd drop by, make a little house call.
Yeah, of course you were.
am I interrupting anything? - No, no, no. Come on in.
Oh, thanks. Yay. - Come on in.
Hi. - I won't overstay my welcome.
I just wanted to check and see if everything was okay...
...because after the tasting, things were a little tense with the in-laws.
Nope. No tension here.
can I be frank?
of course, I'm Frank.
pardon the pun...
...but at this stage in the course, I usually find out that...
...a lot of couples resort to sex as a quick fix for their problems.
I just wanna make sure you're strong enough to resist the temptation.
Yeah. We are. - Yeah.
does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?
no, I'm not uncomfortable talking about sex, no.
having you in my living room talking about sex...
...that makes me a little uncomfortable. Yeah.
the number one rule of a good sex life...
...is not being so serious.
you know, because...
...if the humor goes, there goes the intimacy...
...and then there goes the marriage, then divorce, yada, yada.
but there is a remedy.
knowing what your partner likes sexually. How do you find out?
well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.
Hey, one little exercise, then I'm Audi 5000, okay?
Ben.
look at Sadie and complete this sentence:
I like it when...
this is ridiculous. I'm not doing it. - It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.
I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna do it.
I wanna know.
please.
Sadie.
I really like it when...
...Reverend Frank doesn't interrupt us before sex.
I'm glad I got that off my chest.
okay. - That's okay.
you're not comfortable with this, let's show him how to do it.
don't hold back. - I like it when it's out of the ordinary...
...personally.
that's weird, because I always pictured you as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.
no, not really. No. - Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?
we're out of the ordinary.
because I remember having sex on this carpet and I got a rug burn.
Ouch. - Yeah.
one time, though. It was great...
...but it's more the exception than the rule.
I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity. - Like what?
like my parents' bathroom?
Oh, yeah, and everyone's downstairs having dinner.
exactly. Or on the beach. - Under a towel.
at work. - In the office supply room.
or maybe at your grandmother's house while she's in the kitchen making tea.
Yes! I love it when you get creative.
you have no idea. I love it when you take control.
what do you like about that?
okay! That's enough of that!
Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.
we were talking through it. Yes! - No. No.
Sadie. Pushups, that's an exercise.
no. No, I see Ben's point of view here.
maybe we're rushing things a bit.
maybe I should pencil in the date two years from now.
okay. - Sorry to bother you. Good night.
I'll let myself out. I know the way. You have a good night. I'm going out now.
what was that? - Please.
Reverend Frank!
so we back on schedule?
he's a reverend. What did you think was gonna happen?
well, I can't believe you were talking to him like that.
I can't believe the first man to actually ask me what I like in bed was my minister.
son of a...
Hey, get your butt out the way! This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!
so you're telling me he bugged your apartment?
Yes. And who knows what he heard?
I mean, this guy is sick, and I can't wait to tell Sadie.
she's gonna freak out. - You cannot tell Sadie.
you think she's gonna believe her reverend is bugging your bedroom?
of course she will. I have evidence.
does this bug have his name on it?
no. But...
all right.
we can talk about this later if you need to focus.
I'm good. This is about you. Lady in the wheelchair, please!
listen.
the lines of communication have to be shut down...
...between you and your woman. She trusts the reverend completely now.
she trusts him so much she's calling Shelly...
...and telling her how we need to take a course to help our marriage.
so I'm supposed to take this lying down?
no. Look, let me make this simple, okay?
we have to punch a hole in Frank's holier-than-thou armor.
we have to find his deepest, darkest secret and take him down.
roach coach.
roach coach!
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.
thrust, thrust.
all right, I know you're gonna find something you like with this group.
see, this is just what I gravitate towards.
really simple. - And no diamond? I'm fine with that.
split up?
come apart.
excuse me.
Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.
last name's Murphy. - Murphy.
okay, there you go. - Oh, great. Thank you.
let's take a look.
Oh, wow.
they're really beauti... - Thank you.
I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?
that's what you wrote on your inscription form.
I'm sorry, I wrote "Never to part.
I don't know who would've written "fart.
that's ridiculous. - We get pretty strange requests here...
...and we just engrave whatever is written, and there you go.
Yep. "Never to part." - "Never to fart.
no, that's a P. - It's an F, sir.
Nope, that's a P. Do you see how that comes around in a P way?
Judith? - Yes?
could you come over here just for a tiny little second?
thank you. Judith...
sure. - What is this letter there?
that is an F. - No, that's a P.
it's a P. It comes around like a P.
well, actually, if you look, there's clearly a gap in the curl.
there's no gap in the curl. Judith? It connects.
that's a P. "Never to part.
mark, could you just come... - I don't know that we need Mark.
...a little quick second here?
and what is that? - Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.
mark, it's not a novelty inscription. It's a romantic inscription.
excuse me. What is this letter?
it's an F. I do teach penmanship. - I took his class. It's wonderful.
it's pretty clearly an F. - Yeah.
excuse me, excuse me.
Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you. Very nice.
could I ask you to help us out with a problem here, just a little problem?
could we show the normal person? Thank you.
what would you call the letter between the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?
what is that? - An F?
I'm sorry, sir? Louder, please? - An F?
F - F. - Yes.
that's right. - Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.
I'm getting married in two days.
thank you. I really need that to say "Never to part.
that's very nice. - "Never to part." That's so sweet.
and that's what I wrote.
I need it to say "Never to part," and I need it done immediately.
so how do we do that? How do we get that done?
we could have it tomorrow. In the morning.
great. And that's what we can do.
but there's a $250 rush fee.
so I'm spending $250 on something I asked you to do in the first place?
and we can guarantee that.
this is ridiculous. There's nothing here.
Oh, come on, man.
if that old lady from Murder, She Wrote can do this...
...then we can find something.
are you talking about Angela L... - Just keep looking.
what is that?
Frank Littleton. That's his address.
but who's Maria Gonzales?
Hello? - Joel, it's Ben.
there's no one here by that name.
is there another name you'd maybe like to try?
eagle, it's Sapphire.
copy that, Sapphire. What's your 20?
I'm at John the Baptist's house.
what's he doing? - He's showering.
dude, you're watching him take a shower?
no, I'm outside.
then get your butt inside.
what? Are you nuts? I'm gonna get caught. - Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.
you've only got today to blow the lid off.
it's your only chance.
strike first, strike hard. No mercy.
what the hell am I doing?
stop!
Maria Gonzales.
I got you, sucker M. C.
Hi.
wow, look at you...
...priest dog.
Hi.
I'm gonna...
no. No, no!
that's so gross.
Nicodemus!
Nicodemus!
no, no, no, no!
Nicodemus.
leave Mr. Socks alone.
Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!
these are my Cheesy Curls. No, don't you run away.
bad. These are mine.
this is good. Things are really good.
and I'm not even concerned with the fact that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.
Really? - No.
he's just drawn this little animated truck going through a hoop of fire.
you know what?
it's actually better.
because he's waiting until the last second...
...when his mind is completely clear and he can just say what he really means.
okay, hold on. - What do we think? What's the verdict?
let's just take a second.
honestly?
looks a little bit like the inside of a down comforter.
what the hell's going on?
but look, no, the rhinest...
it's beautiful, honestly... - No. I'm not talking about the dress.
I'm talking about Ben. An animated truck?
you know, I wrote seven pages on how much I love and adore him...
...and all he can muster up for me is some stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?
that's it? - Okay, you know what?
lay it on me.
Oh, God.
please tell me everything's gonna be fine.
what do you want me to say?
Sadie, my marriage failed.
I watch Titanic by myself, alone, in my room, every night...
...stuffing my face with Honey BBO Fritos.
not the one to give you any tips or advice about your relationship...
...no matter how desperate you are.
sorry.
however, I do recall my ex never wrote any vows at all.
Really?
that's kind of promising.
Yeah.
it was probably because he was too busy...
...sleeping with our dental hygienist, which was great.
Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?
Yeah.
you're fine.
is this a piece of work? They don't make them like this any more.
when two people say "I do..."
...they're putting their lives in each other's hands entirely.
anything less than that is doomed to failure.
now, the last test you have to pass...
...before I certify you ready for marriage...
...is the communication test.
which is very important...
...given how poorly we've been doing in that area lately.
Oh, me? Don't worry.
I plan on communicating very well...
okay, Ben, can you please just let him finish talking?
thank you. - Yep.
sorry, reverend. - It's okay.
to demonstrate how important communication is in that area:
what? - Blindfold.
what are you doing? - I'm not doing anything.
you're gonna be Sadie's eyes as she drives us.
you're insane! - If you wanna pass this course...
...and get married tomorrow, you have to pass this test.
your call.
Yeah. Yeah. I can do this. - You're actually gonna go through with this?
what, Ben, you don't think I can do this? - Okay. Maybe you don't understand...
...What's going on here.
Ben, there's two sets of controls.
I can take over at any time.
what'll it be, Benjamin?
Yeah.
well, I'm gonna need a little help here, though.
first you need to put it in gear.
check. - And then you're gonna ease out...
...onto the street.
left. Left!
there you are. Right. To the right!
Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?
there it is. Least it's warm.
What...? - It's a communication exercise.
you will be graded. Less than 80 percent...
...consider getting married in Vegas.
you know what? Vegas sounds awesome right now.
maybe you can get an Elvis impersonator to officiate.
Hey, my wife. Yeah.
Ben, you wanna help your future bride? - Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.
how about we take a right? Head back to the church.
you might wanna brake. Anytime.
sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.
that's very good. Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.
more enthusiasm in the back, Ben.
Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun! Aren't you? I might pee my pants.
sarcasm, wicked stepsister of communication.
point off. - Now take a right. Now.
a right? Now? - Now!
it's a one-way street!
okay, well, then should I pull over?
no, no. Just go straight. They'll go around you.
Oh, my... Jesus. Okay, okay.
in about 20 yards we're gonna turn. - 20 yards means nothing to me. I can't see.
here we go. Turning now!
there's a man. That's an old man in a hat and a thing.
look out!
I'm blind, Ben! - That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!
is that what you do when things get difficult?
you're just gonna quit?
I need to count on you, Ben.
life will hand you stress and the key to managing your anxiety...
...is not letting it contaminate your partner. - Garbage truck!
where? - Punch it!
Yeah!
I'm pretty sure I'm not learning anything from this.
are we good? Are we good? - There's Burt Fleeger!
looking good, Hollywood!
I feel like I'm not getting any guidance. - You might wanna pick up speed a little.
wait, wait. Why would we do that? - There's a parking space up there.
gun it, Sadie.
I never get this space! - Oh, my God!
perfect.
Hello, Jones family. How's it going?
Hello, reverend.
daughter's a good little driver.
well, you have the wedding processional. You can go with Mendelssohn...
...or one couple actually had Captain and Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love.
it's your call. After you boogie down the aisle...
...l'll start by saying something nice.
speaking of that, let's give a big Saint Augustine welcome...
...to Ben Murphy's parents, Ron and Mary Murphy.
came all the way from Seattle.
then I get into a brief message about the joy and the sanctity of marriage...
...and that on your honeymoon, try and act surprised.
it's an old joke, but sometimes works.
then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.
and then we get into the vows.
in my course, the couple writes their own vows.
and that in mind, may I have your vows?
thank you.
thank you.
Ben? - Yeah.
got the vows?
Ben, where are your vows?
Oh, I have them. I just...
I haven't finished them, but I will have them here tomorrow.
okey-dokey. Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.
after the vows, we have the lighting of the candle.
it's true, by the way. - Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.
thinking's good.
Yes, I wanna think about everything. - What about?
I'm guessing these aren't part of the vows.
okay, because I used to think that we were so perfectly compatible for each other...
...and now...
look at us, Ben. - What?
Ben, you want two kids, and I want four. - So what?
you obviously think my family is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.
you never take the lead on things, Ben! - And I'm not good enough for you!
I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?
and I'm not as handsome as Carlisle, not as successful.
Carlisle has nothing to do with it.
Carlisle has everything to do with it. - How?
because he is someone whose opinion you trust way more than mine.
Oh, God. When have I ever said that to you, Ben?
you just don't have to.
Carlisle, what crystal should we use?
what brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?
God, I am so sick of you choosing Carlisle's cheese.
Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben. - Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.
because all you've done is everything you can to make sure this doesn't work.
I've worked very hard to create lines of communication between you and Sadie...
...to let you know what you're in for.
you're onto it. - Yeah, we are.
we are discovering a whole shitload right now!
Really? - Yes, we are, Ben.
guys, seriously, space, please. - Now's the time. Pop the info.
okay. Okay. You know what?
I didn't wanna have to do this, but I have no choice.
so aside from the fact that Reverend Frank bugged our apartment...
excuse me, what?
I've mounted an investigation.
one that I think you would be interested to hear about.
so Frankie, should I tell them or should you?
what do you want me to tell them?
what I want you to tell them is what their good and decent...
...and ever-so-intuitive reverend was doing when he married...
...and then subsequently divorced one Maria Gonzales.
that's not true.
Reverend Frank has never been married or divorced.
that's what I thought too, Grandma Jones.
but...
...Reverend Frank?
it's true.
what?
Oh, it's very true.
how can we trust anything he said to us now?
we have put our relationship in the hands of a total hypocrite.
I didn't wanna have to talk about this to protect certain parties...
...but enough time has passed so the truth can finally be known.
Yes. Please do.
several years ago, a young woman named Maria Gonzales attended our church.
she was a refugee who was denied political asylum.
if she was deported back to Guatemala, she would have faced most certain death.
so in order for her and her children to stay in this country...
...I agreed to marry her so she could get a green card.
once she was legal, we divorced.
she moved to New Mexico with her kids.
a couple of years ago I got a letter from her, and she told me...
...that her oldest had been accepted to Harvard Law.
he was going to graduate in the top of his class, and when he did...
...he was going to go into immigration reform.
and that is the story of Maria Gonzales.
I keep their pictures in my wallet...
...to remind me that one person can make a difference...
...even against insurmountable odds.
that's... That's Pablo right there.
Ben.
if you had just spent half the amount of time on your wedding vows...
...as this stupid little investigation...
...we would probably be walking down the aisle tomorrow.
and, no, no...
I can't do it.
unbelievable. - You're such a jerk.
Benjamin.
are you happy now?
it's a painful process.
that's why we do it.
to find the truth, Benjamin.
Sometim...
why did you punch the reverend? What is wrong with you?
nice right hook, but you are going to hell. Know that?
I'm sorry. J. C. I'm sorry.
three weeks. That's a new course record.
man, I haven't seen a right hook like that since the Buffolini meltdown.
I hate this part.
I'll get the bag of frozen peas. Come on.
here we go.
Hi.
I can't believe I was about to marry someone I didn't know.
that's why we have the course.
it's good that I found out now instead of down the road...
...because that just would have been awful.
I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.
what am I supposed to do now?
you still have your honeymoon tickets? - Yeah.
use them.
go away for a couple of days. Take a friend, family, anybody.
I don't know. - Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.
get a tan, huh? Trust me.
see you, kiddo.
you know...
...maybe Ben wasn't the only...
no.
no, no. What? What? - No, have a great trip.
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.
now she's using her honeymoon ticket without me.
I mean, how is that supposed to make me feel?
bad. I think.
three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy in the world, and now I just...
now I'm just sitting here with you.
Thanks. Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.
no, you know what I mean, I just...
Hey, it's cool.
look, don't take this the wrong way, because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...
...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.
and now it's your time to be the king barracuda...
...and get out there and swim with the sweet tuna.
the ocean is yours, man.
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
okay.
you're a bear.
now jump in that forest...
...and you gotta tag as many cute, furry, bear butts as you can.
Joel...
...you're my best friend, man. You know that?
and I love you. You know that? - I love you too.
but you have got to be the worst advice-giver I know.
I mean, not only is your advice terrible, but...
...it just backfires at every turn.
and now you're talking to me about fish and bears.
she's a woman, Joel. I mean, she's an amazing woman.
and she's just so beautiful.
and she's loving and...
it was all right there...
...and I lost it.
and I don't need you telling me that I should go out and find someone else.
I mean, I don't need anybody telling me how to go...
I don't need anyone telling me.
wait. Where you... Ben! Hey!
no way.
Whoa! Is that one strike or two against Rodriguez?
two.
awesome job with the camouflage, guys.
seriously, you got me.
who'd have thought you'd be in a van with "Saint Augustine's"?
just listening to the ball game!
cubs are off today.
Hey, Gillie.
this guy say he's in love. He come to Jamaica to find his girl.
well, see, we were supposed to get married and then she just called it off.
Oh, no. It's a long story. Just...
man, you don't have to worry, it's a long ride.
it's really a long ride. You can sit and tell us.
well, what happened was...
it is absolutely beautiful here.
Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?
like hell I will.
talk to her. This is for lovers, man!
thank you.
it's Ben.
what? - Sadie, it's me.
I know. What do you want? - Look, I have to talk to you.
guess what, Ben?
you had your chance. You had an empty book and you didn't say anything.
and that's part of the thing. Listen... - No. Ben...
...I don't wanna talk to you. - You don't understand. I'm in...
Sadie?
how come I could say so much and he couldn't say anything to me?
can someone please explain that?
sorry.
I was just clearing my throat.
John! - What?
a piece of coconut went down the wrong way.
your daughter's in pain.
Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too. - Not you.
I'm alone. - Not you.
is anyone at all concerned with the fact that my life is falling apart?
Oh, of course we are, sweetie.
but relationships are complicated.
we certainly don't have all the answers. - You guys have been married for 30 years.
you must be doing something right. - Not all those years were great.
years 16 through 18 in our marriage were something straight out of The Shining.
okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on what color napkins we wanted...
...Let alone how many kids.
and he couldn't handle that I have a good guy friend.
I don't know if it's our friendship he was insecure about.
Really?
listen, I'm gonna support you here.
but you gotta think about this from Ben's perspective.
how do you think he feels when you're always coming to me?
I don't go to you all the time. - When are you going to him?
just maybe...
...Ben wants to be with somebody who needs him for a change.
that's really heartfelt.
does this happen all the time? - Sadie?
to go from being so in love to this.
you know, I'm all alone on my honeymoon at Sandals...
...couples in love all over the place. This isn't what I pictured.
well, is it ever what you picture?
were we the first ones to fail the course?
who said the course is over? It's only over when you decide it's done.
I don't know what to do.
it'll come to you.
have faith.
thank you, Reverend Frank.
right on schedule.
Hallelujah. Now do you mind? I need my beauty sleep.
no smoking on this flight, but you can light up whatever once we land.
Ben? - Hey.
you picked up.
it's so weird. I was just thinking about you.
you were?
Yeah.
my family said some things to me yesterday about...
...me not relying on you and...
...it got me thinking...
...about that stupid truck...
...you drew in your wedding vow notebook.
and I know this is gonna sound so weird but...
...It's why I love you.
you don't always say the right things or do the right things but somehow...
...I know you would jump through a hoop of fire for me.
Hey, can you do me a favor?
I think you should come to your window.
I left my vow book at home so...
...I figured I should write a few of them here.
what do you think?
I am so sorry. I messed up. - Me too.
there's so much to say. I just didn't know how.
I need to stop doing everything myself and share the reins.
no matter what I do, I know you're gonna support me.
if I'm ever blindfolded, you're the one to guide me.
I want to have as many kids as we possibly can.
Really? After Macy's, I definitely want two.
I need to be more decisive.
about napkins, about... - Napkins, cheese, anything...
...at the end of the day, I'm gonna rely on you.
because nothing means more to me than you.
nothing. I love you.
I love you.
what's going on here?
Reverend Frank? What are you doing here?
Reverend Frank is everywhere, remember?
thought you two broke up.
we did. We just sort of talked it through.
seems like we have more faith in each other than we thought.
Congratulations.
you just passed the course with flying colors.
so how about it?
do you think we should get this wedding started?
I do.
and do you, Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...
...Take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do. - The rings.
never to fart"?
Oh, my God.
I didn't change it. I'm gonna change it when I get back.
I promise I will. - No.
bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want it changed for anything in the whole world.
no.
ready?
by the power vested in me by God...
...and the Minister of National Security and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you gotta turn. There it is!
Frank, we just wanted to come and thank you for everything.
I'm just fulfilling my life's calling. - You know what?
we wouldn't have gotten here without you. - Thanks.
you're gonna have a wonderful life. I have no doubts.
excuse me, may I borrow my daughter... Your wife, for a dance?
Yes, please. - Thank you.
Bye. - You look beautiful.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
sure.
when did you know that we were ready to get married?
the moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't a fish, I knew it was meant to be.
besides, anybody who kicks a reverend's ass for his woman...
...you're A-okay in my book.
well...
you're starting an incredible journey with a wonderful partner.
thank you.
and on the honeymoon, act surprised.
I will.
take care of yourself, B. - You too, Frank.
Oh, my God.
wait. - No, that's what they're supposed to do.
I know. I lost... We broke...
but it's okay if we laugh, right?
it's not okay if we laugh, is it?
you broke! - I did not.
we still got a siren. My ride's here.
I like shooting downtown L. A. because pretty much you got 911 all day.
I'll be over here.
Whoa! "Be chill, don't kill.
that goes for you too, Mr. Simpson. Okay.
I thought you'd work so hard!
just get me a bottle of water and a rubber mallet.
come on. Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!
people, we can do this. They're not that...
Ben?
help out, everybody. Mother father.
you play cutch?
Cutch.
let me walk back and cutch, which is a old game.
that's scary that I could say it like that...
Oh, my God.
no. Stop.
I'm gonna look like such a rookie, because every time...
cut.
Yeah! - Yeah!
you know, I'm getting the feeling...
like she wants you to be happy again...
like when you used to come here.
I'm getting that feeling, too.
you are so screwed.
what? - I didn't say anything.
Oh. Right.
traitors.
lying, cheating, red-headed hussy.
I'll wring her neck.
throw her in front of a car, throw her down some stairs.
# She had blonde hair, blue eyes, too #
# And she had a little itty-bitty #
# Hootchie-cootchie-coo #
you. You bastard.
whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.
you can hear me?
unfortunately.
are you psychic?
no, dead.
good. What happened?
drunk driving accident.
Oh, so backing over me with your truck wasn't enough...
to get you to stop drinking and driving?
I'm not proud.
what are you doing here?
same as you.
takin' care of unfinished business.
are you sure that's why you're here?
that's what the lady told me.
the lady in the white room? - 'Course.
why, what'd she tell you?
none of your business.
did she give you any hints?
how... How specific was she?
Ah, you didn't talk to her, did you?
What'd you do, piss her off?
unfinished business.
well, that's it.
I got to protect Henry.
Yeah.
Wh... Hey, hey!
you're welcome.
Hey. Can I help you?
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.
I called, and no one answered.
um, my friend gave me your number in yoga class.
well, I'm just having a really bad day.
my... My friend died, and we had a fight.
Oh, okay, okay. Sure, sure, sure, come in.
come in. It's fine.
thank you.
okay. Come right this way.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.
Kayleen? - Mm-hmm.
great. Um, why don't you come this way.
uh, just have a seat.
do you want a drink or anything?
no, I'm fine.
okay, great.
make yourself comfortable.
okay.
so, you talk to dead people?
well, I can't promise results...
but, yes, I have had some success.
comes in nice and clear, huh?
no mistaking it?
sometimes, yeah.
great. Can't wait.
all right, so the first thing I'm gonna have you do...
is give me your hands.
uh, you... Uh, we probably shouldn't...
because I'm, uh, coming down with a cold.
okay. Um, great.
okay, this is what we'll do then.
um, why don't you concentrate on your friend, okay?
and let's try to see if she can come through to us.
you're the psychic. - Great.
Yeah, wow, I'm getting something.
Ashley Clark, you have made a mockery of the gifts...
you've been given.
uh, Kayleen?
you speak falsely for the dead.
we have been sent here to give you a warning.
stop now or suffer a terrible fate.
is this some sort of joke?
this is no joke.
we see and hear everything.
we saw you drop the tray of meatballs last night...
and still serve them.
we saw what you did in the shower last night...
and it's nothing to be ashamed of...
but we still saw.
and we see what you're trying to do...
to Henry Mills.
l... I'm just...
you, of all people...
should know the consequences of defaming the dead.
leave Henry Mills alone...
or you will never find peace again.
you will lose your possessions, your friends...
and eventually your life.
this is the only time we will visit you.
Oh, I must've dozed off.
did you contact my friend?
Ashley, are you okay?
please go.
well, you look like you've seen a ghost.
can you go now, please?
just go.
you'll never guess who I ran into.
who? - Ashley.
Ashley...
I know so many Ashleys.
the psychic.
Oh, that Ashley.
what did she say? - Well, it was really weird.
I mean, she got these images, really specific stuff.
Really? Wow.
will she get a message from Kate?
like what? - Huh?
what? - What?
anyway, we're, you know, gonna try it again.
that's great. That's... I really...
I feel like she can help you, Henry.
come on, Ashley!
Ashley, come on!
she's not home?
uh, why?
are you here to meet her?
no, we had, um, an appointment.
wait a second. Are you Henry...
the-the veterinarian?
she mentioned me?
no, it's just a really lucky guess.
I'm good like that.
I'm Dan, the catering partner.
right. Hi, Dan. - Hi.
Yeah, we were supposed to meet an hour and a half ago...
at this restaurant, but she's not answering her phone.
I know. I've been calling her all day.
do you mind if I try?
knocking?
please. No, please. Help yourself.
maybe later you can come jab an elevator button...
a hundred times after I've already pushed it.
Ashley!
Ashley, it's Henry. Are you there?
Henry, I'm sick!
I tried to call.
I might be sick for a really long time.
okay, do you need anything?
no. I'll call you if I ever feel better.
Ashley?
Ashley!
got more than you did.
Hey, it's Ashley, psychic-slash-caterer...
leave an awesome message.
good morning. It's Henry.
just thought I'd check in since you didn't...
# This little light of mine # - sound so good last night, see if you're all right.
so, um, you all right? - # I'm gonna let it shine #
morning again.
it's, uh, Henry again.
that's some cold. I hope you didn't get it...
when we went out the other night.
anyway, I was gonna...
you know, come by and drop off some soup or something...
so, um, maybe I'll see you.
# Shine, let it shine #
# Even if it burns your eyes #
# This light of mine is mine #
# And I'm gonna let it shine # - It's Henry.
the sandwich was gone, so, you know, that's a good sign.
buying a sandwich for someone...
you've never had a sandwich with...
is a lot harder than you think.
I mean, just the bread.
I started off with whole wheat...
but then I worried that, you know, I'm saying...
you're kind of a crunchy person...
who only eats whole wheat.
I almost went with pumpernickel, but then I'd look like...
the kind of guy who wants to impose...
my weird bread fetish on everyone and...
you know, now, I'm one of those idiots who just prattles on...
in, uh, answering machines...
and also uses a word like "prattles.
so the only thing I can think of is that, uh, you really just...
you don't wanna talk to me anymore.
um, if that's right, well, um...
I don't know, I guess just...
kinda keep doin' what you're doin'.
# Shine, let it shine # - So, take care of yourself...
# Even if it burns your eyes # - Ashley.
# This light of mine is mine #
# And I'm gonna let it shine #
there you are.
why have you been avoiding my brother?
uh, I can explain.
um...
I guess I can't explain.
okay, if you didn't wanna do this...
you should've just said so...
but to lead him on and let him think...
that you can help him and then just disappear?
I mean, he's worse off, if that's possible.
I just couldn't do it anymore, all right?
I'm sorry.
please tell him I'm sorry.
did you run out of things to say?
no, it's not that. It's not that. - Because I have...
it's not... - more information.
I have letters and some pictures and...
is that her? - Yeah, that's Kate.
Oh, God!
wait, what do... What does that mean?
do... Do you want the letters?
all right, show's over.
come out. I know who you are...
Kate.
boo. - God.
God, it's really you. This is unbelievable.
are you really like a... - Ghost?
it's the only way I can explain it.
that is awesome.
here, catch.
nice throw.
crap.
Hey, what was that the other day, man?
I was just trying to help out the situation.
help?
you were helping yourself to Henry.
okay, so, like, I'm like...
I'm like slightly attracted to him.
well, he's not right for you.
Yes, he is.
he is considerate, and he is sweet, and, you know...
pulls the chair out for me when I sit.
big deal.
it is a big deal, and you know it, okay?
he's been wonderful to me from the second he met me...
even though he probably thought I was a little crazy.
well, you do talk to dead people.
that's a little crazy.
Oh, I'm crazy?
you're the one who's spying on me in the frickin' shower.
you're right. I'm sorry about that.
you know what, girl to girl, you're gettin' a little hippy.
you might wanna cut back on the pasta.
all right, what do you want?
I'm serious. Why are you here?
look, we got off on the wrong foot...
and that's partly my fault...
with the threats from beyond and all.
Yeah. - But here's the thing.
I was sent back to earth to protect Henry.
Really? How do you know that?
because when you die, you go to this white room...
and there's a woman who may or may not be an angel...
and she says that, you know, just, you know...
stuff, and I just know.
so, like, I have to like stay away from Henry now?
Oh, that would be so great. Thank you.
wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
but you're dead.
I still don't want you to see him.
Yeah, I know, but for argument's sake...
I mean, if I wanted to see him...
there's not a whole hell of a lot you could do about it.
Really?
then why have you been hiding in your bedroom for a week?
well, I'm done hiding.
let's not let this get ugly.
I think it already has.
you have no idea.
Ashley?
Hi, Henry.
Oh, sorry.
Dr. Mills.
Oh, hey, you're alive.
Yeah, thanks to you.
you're a real lifesaver.
know... You know, the food that you left me...
was the only thing that kept me going.
Oh, you got that. Good.
I left a couple of messages, but...
I know. I'm so sorry. I, um...
I just... I felt so ill that I couldn't talk to anyone.
but the minute I felt better...
I wanted to come down here and thank you in person.
I hope you're not mad at me.
no, not at all. L...
I'm sorry that I called and bothered you.
I mean, you said that you'd call when you felt better...
and here you are.
do you wanna go out tonight?
Yeah. All right. I'd love to.
okay, great.
Oh, great. Oh, great.
I'll let you get back to saving animals' lives...
and everything.
okay.
and what seems to be the trouble with Margaret?
Ltchy ass.
excellent.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Ashley, hello.
what was that crash? I heard a crash.
Ashley, hello. - Shit.
what is going on? Is there someone there?
is someone at your place?
hello. - You know what...
Hello! - I'm callin' the police.
I'm giving you ten seconds to pick up.
Dan. Sorry.
the phone scared me, so I killed it.
what's going on? Where have you been?
why haven't you talked to me? - It's a long story.
I've got time.
l... I can't talk right now.
why don't you come over tomorrow...
we'll work on the Spencer party. I got to go.
where are you off to?
the gym. Okay? I got to go. Bye.
Oh, wait, Dan! - Yeah?
would you say I'm hippy?
# Goddess on the mountain top #
# Burning like a silver flame #
# The summit of beauty and love #
# And Venus was her name #
# Whoa #
there's a gas leak in the building.
everyone get out now.
this is an emergency.
it'll be fine if we just don't freak out!
it's all right! It's okay!
we'll be right if we just stay cool!
just stay cool, guys! Just don't light a match!
what... Everyone out!
Oh, no.
miss? - The...
it was just the P. A.
was there an announcement on the P. A?
what P. A?
Stairmaster's open, you know, for your... Mm-hmm.
miss.
Yeah. I was just...
well, look at me, hmm?
naked in there, okay.
just kidding. Sorry about that, you guys.
I'm crazy.
so, do you have any idea where you wanna eat?
um, no.
I mean, if you have a place... some place in mind or...
no, it's your treat, so, you know...
I'm gonna let you choose.
Oh, well, in that case, I just... I know just the place, actually.
no, I was... I was kidding.
do you wanna get some seafood?
Oh, no, no, big talker...
you're now gonna eat a hot dog out of a cart.
Hey. - Sor... Oh, sorry.
uh, one Italian sausage.
thank you. - No, make it two.
if you're sure you wouldn't rather have seafood.
no, we're... No, we're fine with the two.
two Italian sausage. Thank you.
are you going to treat me to a funnel cake, too?
only if you're a good boy.
watch out for that.
stop it, please. It's really not funny.
no, you're right. That's horrible.
stop, 'cause if you wanna play, I'll play that game.
you wanna play that game?
Oh, my God! Oh!
Ohh!
Oh.
let me just...
you got a little somethin', uh...
I can't believe you're not embarrassed to be seen with me right now.
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.
Oh. - Yeah.
if I run into anybody that I know...
I'm gonna pretend you're a German tourist.
I don't wanna be associated with you.
do you know any German?
uh... Ich machen dachen zeit yachen...
tick wagen fahr Fig Newton...
in BMW en zag.
it's kinda like a Swedish German.
Yeah. - Nice.
it's not. Yeah. - It's good.
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms are over there...
german lady, who's from also Sweden...
that I don't even know.
Hey, I feel kind of weird bringing this up...
but have you thought about Kate lately?
um, yeah, not really.
I mean, you know how I feel about all that...
but you said some pretty amazing things.
can I ask you a question?
sure.
um, there's no right or wrong answer to this...
so you can just be honest, but, um, are we...
are we out to talk about Kate...
or-or are we, you know, just out?
because, either way is totally fine with me.
I just... If it's both...
then it probably gets, like, a little complicated for me.
Yeah, I was kind of wondering the same thing, actually.
I mean, are we out because I'm your client...
or are we out?
Oh, great, I'm your client.
that sucks.
I had a good time.
me, too.
I'll call you tomorrow.
okay, you don't have to.
no, I want to.
okay. Okay, me, too.
okay.
Bye.
forgetting something?
was I somehow unclear about what I wanted you to do?
Oh, were you expecting Henry?
I was hoping. He's quite a kisser.
you're really gonna throw that in my face?
isn't that tactic a little beneath you?
you're one to talk!
I had to show a room full of guys my naked breasts...
because of you!
that's a nice gesture, but unnecessary, dear.
Oh, I was... Um...
good night.
bingo, come on.
that dog just sniffed you.
God, I think the animals can see you.
that is so cool.
that's great.
wonder how I can use that against you?
Hey, I showed it to you.
Yeah, that was dumb.
I don't understand.
if you weren't sick, then what was the problem?
I can't get into it...
because you're gonna think I'm crazy.
no, no, no. I'll hide it.
I promise, I'll look at you really sincerely and say...
I understand.
okay. Fine. - Good.
you remember Henry, right?
Yeah, yeah. The guy with the wife...
that was the crushed by the angel.
right. I saw her.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
uh, now, when you say, uh, you saw her...
you mean you saw...
her ghost, yes. - Mm.
Yeah, she's been hassling me.
I understand.
no, Dan, this is not a joke.
look, I've heard voices before and stuff like that...
but I've actually seen her.
do you see her right now?
no, I only see her when she wants me to see her...
I think. I don't know.
you know what? Never mind. I'm kidding.
I seriously was kidding. I totally made that up.
let's cook. I bought salmon.
you... You really believe this, don't you?
it's really happening.
and it's only you. No one else can see or hear her?
Yeah. I don't know why I'm the only one who can see her.
maybe because I'm after the guy she was supposed to marry.
maybe that's sufficient motivation for her...
to come back from the dead. I don't know.
I note that during your little rant...
defending your sanity, you admit you're after him.
well, yeah, I mean, we're like...
we're like... We're sort of dating or whatever.
Ashley.
no, I don't want a reality check.
this is what happens when you lie about talking to a man's dead fiancee.
I've seen it a thousand times.
no, because I'm not lying, okay?
I can actually talk to her. That's different.
okay, I was lying before...
because I actually couldn't talk to her.
and also, admittedly...
I lied to you about being interested in him.
so I am sorry about that.
Yeah, listen, while you work that out...
maybe this can bubble into your subconscious.
run away!
I mean, you have dated guys with every problem there is...
but this one, apparently, has a ghost?
Yeah, but it's not his fault his fiancee's haunting me.
Mm. - Look, it's impossible to find a great guy...
and I'm not gonna let a little thing like a ghost stop me, okay?
I'm not gonna let her win.
you mean her ghost?
right. - I understand.
I'm going to the market. Bone the fish.
are you all right? Why are you screaming?
no, I wasn't.
I was... I was singing.
Thanks.
father Marks?
Ashley.
that's me.
I haven't seen you in, what's it been, ten years?
I've been to a few Christmas services.
well, next Christmas, why don't you come up and say hello?
Absolutely. I will put that in my calendar.
december the 25th.
got it.
well, you didn't come here...
so I could make you squirm about your attendance.
now that you mention it.
um... Father, um, I've... I've...
I've had an encounter...
encounters with a ghost.
well, you musn't be completely surprised...
that this is happening to you.
I mean, if you dabble with the occult...
you're bound to get these kind of incidents.
I know. - Well, all right.
you're not here to get a lecture from me.
so why did you come here?
I want you to get rid of her.
do you see the ghost now?
no.
and this room is where you've seen her the most?
definitely. This is definitely the room...
where I see her most.
so, uh, is there a script for this sort of thing?
for exorcism? Oh sure, sure.
no, when you're casting out spirits...
the Church doesn't really like us to wing it.
right. Of course.
shall we? - Yes.
Yes.
I address thee, spirit, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
come out and leave this servant of God.
you don't really believe this is gonna work.
I see her. She's right there.
it is time for your soul to pass on.
hear the command of God himself...
who did walk upon the sea...
and extend his right hand to Peter.
you really don't believe in all this hocus-pocus, do you?
in the name of God, the Almighty Father...
that thou depart... - Oh, that's not good.
it's working. It's working.
uh, okay, Ashley, listen.
I've been reconsidering, and I think we can come...
to some sort of understanding. - "Let the Holy Spirit...
dwell therein.
okay, uh, s-s-some of the...
some of the things I did, a little out of hand...
and I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize.
you know, the whole naked in the gym thing, not cool.
I get it now.
what's happening? - "Therefore, restless spirit...
Oh, make it stop!
acknowledge that your time has ended.
please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go!
she's gone.
Yeah.
you did it.
you sure? - Yeah.
I'm... I'm... I'm sure.
she was right there...
and then she vanished.
well, bugger me.
good.
good. - Very good.
so, you're, uh, finished with your psychic work?
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.
and we'll see you in church on a regular basis?
we didn't agree to that before we started.
Oh, I'll bring her back.
it's a deal. It's a deal. I promise.
okay. No more of these games.
I know. I'm sorry. - Take care of yourself...
Ashley Clark. - Bye-bye.
he sounded so serious.
No! No!
did you like that disappearing thing?
I just made that up.
I didn't even know I could do that before now.
okay, time to get to work.
tonight, instead of sleeping, I thought I'd tell you...
all the stories of all the pets I've ever owned.
Oh, people love pet stories. - Just... Just...
so, I'm gonna start with the first pet I ever had.
it was a turtle named Ernie, and I must've been eight.
she actually had kittens.
she had baby kittens, and then we named them all.
and we used to call him Boots, because he was all white...
and he had these little black...
boots? - Exactly.
at least that's what we called him until "he" had kittens.
then we named him Mrs. Piggy.
and there were six kittens. What were their names?
was that you?
the doorbell?
Yeah, that was me. Don't answer that.
I remember the kittens' names!
it was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...
fang, Teddy, and Nugget!
and then there was Buffy, who was my last dog.
but after he died, that was it.
God, I think that's all my pets.
you should get some sleep.
Mmm... thank you.
good morning.
the time is 7 A.M. - You have a busy day in front of you...
good morning, everyone. - So I thought you might like to hear...
all my favorite colors and numbers.
blue, seven, seventeen... - Good morning, everyone! Well...
lime green, forest green, yellow, one, blue.
Oh, crap, did I already say blue?
you know what? I'm gonna start over.
blue. - Ow!
Oh, God!
gettin' tired? Unable to function?
I'm fine.
you know, you really should think...
about what you're getting into here.
I don't need sleep.
I can hound you every second of every day.
you're never gonna know...
if something you hear is real or not.
I can keep you from sleeping and eating...
and drinking... - Enough!
enough, okay? Congratulations, you win.
I love spending time with Henry, but it's not worth it.
good. Then my work here is done.
but if you ever try to see him again...
you'll be back. - You can count on it.
go.
Hey, wait, Kate.
look, is there, um...
is there anything you wanna tell him?
what do you mean?
well, Henry came to me...
because he wanted to talk to you...
and I definitely think I can deliver on that.
so is there anything you wanna say to him?
Kate contacted me from beyond...
not like before, but clearer.
clearer than anything that I have ever experienced.
what did she say?
Hi, Henry.
she says, "Hi, Henry.
I know. Um, you know what?
ask me questions.
just, uh, ask me as many questions as you'd like...
and just keep asking me until you're convinced.
what was her favorite food?
the three berry cake at Sweet Lady Jane's.
she says ask a tough one.
um, what was her first pet's name?
Ernie the turtle. She told me that earlier today.
her favorite Hawaiian island?
she's only been to Maui, and she got stung by a jellyfish.
you really, uh...
what else?
she always hated this chair.
her second toes are slightly longer than her first.
she always meant to take guitar lessons.
well, l... Why did she come here?
I mean, what does she wanna tell me?
she says that she can tell that you're torn...between being faithful to her memory...and the feelings that you have for me.
the hell I did!
Ow! Oh! Ah!
what happened? - Seed in the eye! It's okay!
tell him the truth!
she says she just wants you to be happy, Henry...
and she can tell that you're happier with me.
you are screwing with the wrong woman.
that's it. I mean, she wants you to move on.
Oh, she's gone.
no, I'm not!
I'm right here!
I'm right here!
I'm gonna be with you every second of every day...for the rest of your life!
tell her thank you.
thank you, Kate, wherever you are.
are you okay?
you look at it, Doctor.
Oh!
it really hurts.
good. I hope it blinds you.
what would I do without you?
you are so dead.
I, Andy Chris, take you, Natalia Yeroshik...
as my best friend for life.
I pledge to honor, encourage...
and support you... - Oh, you know the Lerner party?
you're gonna have to do that alone.
where, uh... Where are you gonna be?
uh, I gotta... I gotta...
I gotta go away. I'm... Some... I've got a thing.
with... With who?
Shh.
with Henry? With Henry.
this is my solemn vow.
from this moment, I, Natalia Yeroshik...
take you, Andy Chris...
what, Dan? - Nothing. Nothing.
this is my solemn vow.
by the power vested in me...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
three...
four...
five...
six. - Ashley.
Shh!
okay, where was I? I was on...
three. - Thank you.
for what?
three, four, five...
six, seven, eight.
I have to say something.
now, you know I never get involved in your love life.
bullshit. - Fine.
as someone who's always involved in your love life...
I think you should listen to me.
you're making a huge mistake.
no, I'm not. Help me with the cart.
okay, it's... It's not because his fiancée's ghost...
is trying to drive you away, and-and it's not because...
he's a client who you lie to...
but you talk about picking guys with problems?
he just got out of a relationship...where his bride was killed on their wedding day...
and you'll be the first girl he dates.
that's a pretty serious rebound.
you really think this is gonna end up well, huh?
nice try. You're still handling the Lerner party alone.
ladies and gentlemen, Cherries Jubilee.
excuse me for a second.
I could feel the heat all the way back here.
are you okay? - You know, if I were dead...
I wouldn't be following around one person, okay?
I'd be finding out the meaning of life.
I would be talking to wise, notable dead people.
Oh, like who?
um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.
what would you ask her?
like, all kinds of things.
like what?
um...
all right, forget Eleanor Roosevelt.
you're the only dead person I wanna talk to right now.
Oh, I think you burned off a little bit of your eyebrow.
what? Where?
right... Right there.
it's not gonna be even.
you know what? I don't care.
and you know what else?
I'm going away with Henry this weekend...
whether you like it or not, and I don't care what you do.
I don't care if you set me on fire or yell and scream...
and talk about your dog or watch me while I piss!
I don't care! So if you're trying to make me look insane...
it's not working!
so...
who's ready for cake?
Oy.
# I'll stop the world and melt with you #
# You've seen the difference #
# And it's getting better all the time #
# There's nothing you and I # - Ha! No! - Yeah.
# Won't do # - Oh, my God.
pretty smooth. - It is beautiful.
it's so weird how much this place...
reminds me of my own apartment.
you know what we should do?
I saw some people riding one of those...
like, two-person bikes.
we should totally rent one of those.
Yeah, absolutely.
okay, cool.
now?
Yeah, why not?
we just got here.
don't you want to unpack, check out the room?
Oh, my God.
did you think that you could just bring me...up here and never leave the room?
just put a "do not disturb" sign on the door...
and lock ourselves in for the weekend?
um... yes?
awesome.
I'll go freshen up.
Henry?
yes?
you know I'm still in the room, right?
Yeah.
okay. - Okay.
that was gross.
are you all right?
I'm fine!
okay.
I should've known it was you.
you know, I never thought farts were funny...
when I was alive, but the look on your face.
you get out of here.
you're not having sex with my husband.
he is not your husband.
and even if you did make it down that aisle...
there's still that "till death do us part" clause.
you're a ghost!
did you say something?
Yeah. The...
there's potpourri!
don't do it!
Oh, I'm doin' it.
Oh, my God.
it looks even better on the floor.
best day ever.
wow, this is gonna be awkward.
Oh, my God!
you okay? - Yeah, yeah.
I just, you know, it's just, "Oh, my God."
I'm surprised he didn't spring for the suite.
Hey! - Are you sure you're okay?
how's it going down there? - Why? Yeah.
Yeah. - Yoo-hoo!
it's just you're closing your eyes very energetically.
I think you're freakin' him out.
Oh, you like to kiss with your eyes open? That's cool.
I mean, that's kind of kinky, but all right, all right.
I'm cool with that. - Being on the bottom...
not your most flattering angle.
I was talking to another ghost the other day...
and you'll never guess who it was.
remember that guy you used to date in high school...
who got killed in a motorcycle accident?
Ted?
what? - What?
you said Ted.
no, I didn't.
I just... I, um... 'cause I bumped my arm.
I'm okay now.
anyway, this is a little embarrassing...
but he said you were a bad kisser.
actually, he said you were the worst kisser ever.
painful and overly wet," was his exact quote.
he made a noise like this.
talk dirty to me. - What?
talk dirty to me. I love it. It turns me on.
Henry doesn't like that.
do it loud.
um... Oh, you're a dirty girl, aren't you?
she's a dirty little liar is what she is.
louder.
you're a dirty little thing.
you're a dirty girl...
# I believe the children # - aren't you?
# Are our future # - You're a dirty girl.
good, good. Louder though, louder. - # Teach them well #
like... Like you're trying to drown out some annoying noise - # And let them lead the way #
# Show them all # - Like this?!
# The beauty # - Yeah!# They possess inside # - You're a dirty little girl, aren't you?
louder, please! - Aren't you a dirty little thing?!
you like the dirty stuff!
aren't you a dirty... That's just stupid.
I'm just yelling at you.
music! - Is that annoying?
it's a little loud.
What?!
the music. You like it this loud?
Oh, yeah, I love it.
love this. Salsa.
salsa makes me horny!
no, no, no, no!
come on, just anything.
I like your hair!
Oh, God, I love it!
it's looks really good! - Louder!
Really?!
sorry, sorry.
Oh, hey. - Hi.
how you doin'? - I'm good.
so, what's up?
you know that woman you sent me to...
the, uh, psychic?
believe me, you don't have to whisper that...in this neighborhood.
I mean, it's not like I sent you to a...
Republican.
well, She's, um... She's great.
I mean, really, I feel a thousand times better.
did she get a message from Kate?
Yeah, and I think that Kate really wants me to move on.
in fact, I'm dating her.
who?
Ashley.
wait, so she told you that Kate said...
that she wants you to start dating again...
and then she went out with you?
well, it didn't happen exactly like that, but...
Oh, yeah, I guess that is...
how it happened exactly, but...
well, you got to stop.
Why?
she's a psychic.
since when do you have a problem with psychics?
... You do.
you do. You hate them.
look, Henry, I think it's great...that you're dating again, but, I mean, you can't date her.
God, I thought you'd be happy about this.
I guess, I-I should be.
I'm just... You're right.
I'm just surprised, I mean...
but I'm... I'm... I'm coming around now.
I mean, look how happy I am now.
Chloe.
I've been meaning to call you, actually.
what's been stopping you, huh?
pretending to talk to my brother's dead fiancée...
so you could date him?
come on in.
no, I'm okay.
I just... I want Kate's diary back.
okay. Um... yeah.
I'm not gonna tell him that I gave this to you...
because, somehow, he does seem better.
I know it looks bad.
how could you do this?
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it. I'm not some scam artist."
I mean, you totally took advantage of him.
you asked me to do this.
use fake psychic vision to date him?
let me think. No, I'd remember that.
Chloe, I really, really care about him.
worst part is that I did this.
I mean, I gave this to you.
I handed you everything that you needed.
you gave what to her?
no, what... It's okay. Don't...
what's this?
this is Kate's diary.
Yeah.
why would you give this to her?
how'd you even get it?
the story about the pancreas is in here...
um... - and how we met.
Henry. Henry!
Henry!
you were right.
it all fell apart, you know, 'cause I'm a horrible person.
no, no, you're not a horrible person.
Yes, I am. I am.
I'm a liar, and I'm a horrible person.
and you know what? I never even deserved him.
okay, you... You kn... - I didn't!
no, you know what? He's an idiot to let you go.
No! - All right? No.
no matter what you did, he's an idiot to let you go...
okay?
anyone would be lucky to have you.
you're just saying that.
anyone.
what the hell was that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you're my friend.
you're gay.
you're my gay friend.
Ah, screw it.
I'm not gay.
what?
I'm not gay!
I've never been gay.
I don't have sex with men, and they don't have sex with me.
Wow.
so when you just kissed me just then, you were like...
I'm in love with you.
What?!
I've been in love with you since I met you.
every time you turn your back to me, I sniff your hair.
I went into business with you, so I could be near you.
I hate cooking!
I wanna throw up every time I cut a fish.
God, you have got to be the worst psychic...in the history of time.
how could you not know any of this?
why didn't you just, like, tell me?
okay, remember when we met, and-and-and we started, you know...
going out to lunch and dinner...
and talking on the phone all day and all night.
I thought we were dating.
and... And then...
and then, after a week, we went to a movie.
I was just about to kiss you, and you turned to me...
and you said, "I love having a gay friend to talk to.
I could never be this comfortable...with a straight man.
what was... What was I supposed to do?
you waited a week to make your move!
of course, I thought you were gay.
I was taking it slow.
five years, one kiss? That's not slow.
that's family.
I'm sorry. I missed my window.
I was... I was waiting for it to come back around again.
God, Dan, you've, like...
betrayed me.
betrayed you? - Yeah.
Ashley, I love you.
you think it was easy for me listening to you...talk about other guys, huh?
watching mind-numbingly boring romantic movies...
and pretending to cry?
going shopping with you and giving you advice on clothes?
do you know how much of the last five years...
I have spent learning about clothes?
this shirt cost me $175, and I hate it!
I hate it!
I love that shirt.
you know, before this whole stupid thing...
I probably spent $100 a year on clothes.
now? Now, I spend that much every three weeks...
on this haircut, which I also hate!
God.
we took bubble baths together.
Yeah.
now can you see how hard it was for me?
I just wanted to cry on my gay friend.
Yup.
I'll let myself out.
okay.
all right, I'm ready.
you don't have a cat.
I rescued a stray, so you'd talk to me.
come in.
so, have you thought about a name for him yet?
no. After we're done here...
I'm taking him back to the pound.
I'm kidding.
it's a joke, so you start laughing now...
breaks the tension, and then we start talking again.
pet's a big responsibility.
did you ever think about maybe just running...into me on the street?
listen, I didn't know that Ashley was gonna use...
the information I gave her to start dating you.
I mean, I really thought that she was just...
gonna tell you that Kate wanted you to move on.
we... Do you really have to do that?
Yeah, he needs his shots.
Yeah. I think he's already had them.
he's my neighbor's cat.
your neighbor let you borrow her cat to bring to the vet?
you stole a cat?
I'm gonna bring him back.
he was on a fire escape. It's like a walk.
would you quit doin' stupid stuff...
because you think you know you're right?
whoa. You should hear yourself.
you sound like Mom and Dad.
and your friends and your bosses...
and your teachers and strangers that you meet on the street.
they all tell you this because it's true.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
see if you can get the cat home without killing it.
I think I can handle it.
he's fine.
Hi.
I read this.
Henry, I really wanna talk to you about all this.
it's just... - How did you know...
about the cake or Hawaii or the chair?
none of that's in here...
and no one else knows about that.
all right, um, your sister gave me the diary...
and she asked me to pretend...
that Kate had talked to me, which is not her fault...
because I shouldn't have done it in the first place, okay?
but I did, because I thought, I don't know...
I thought maybe you needed it, you know, to help you move on.
but I must have crossed over some sort of line...
or something, because then, suddenly, she appeared.
Kate. - Yeah.
and sh... And she tried to scare me away from you.
but I just... I really wanted to be with you...
so I didn't let it stop me.
you pretended that she wanted us to be together...
because you thought that that would make me...
fall in love with you.
Yeah, I guess I did.
I, um...
I hoped that you would love me for other reasons, too.
is she here now? - No, I haven't...
I haven't actually seen her, um, since you broke up with me.
guess it was her job to get rid of me...
and, well, she did that.
so, she just sort of disappears?
I don't know.
thank you.
there's a soul and seal on thine arm.

# Go on, go on, go on, go on # - Hi.
okay, Hi. Hello. - Hello.
long time. - Yeah, could've gone longer.
Yeah, listen, I've...
I've been thinking about what I did, and...
can we stop walking?
I'm trying to... trying to be sincere...
and the panting is really killing my delivery.
sorry.
I screwed up. - Yeah, you did.
Yeah, I did. Definitely screwed up.
but look at it this way.
I pretended I was gay for five years.
has any other man ever done anything like that for you, huh?
I mean, I could see a guy pretending...
for two, three...
three, three years tops... - Okay.
but five, come on, that's... - Okay.
all right, listen, Ashley, you know me.
you know me better than anyone else does.
and I know you.
even though I did a stupid, stupid...
really stupid.
beyond crazy, stupid thing by lying to you...
we have been best friends for five years.
Yes, that is true.
look, I don't...
I don't know any more fancy way to say this.
I'm a good guy. I love you.
and l... I just...
I just really wish you'd give me a chance, so...
do I attract screwed-up guys, or what?
Hiya.
you. - Yeah.
well, he doesn't look so good, does he?
no, he doesn't.
finish your mission?
Yeah. You?
no, or I wouldn't still be here.
Really? - Mm.
so you do move on once you finish...
what you're supposed to do? - Oh, shoot.
did you listen to anything she said?
no. - So I guess you're not done yet.
guess not.
look, what do you think you're supposed to do?
I don't know.
well, what do you want more than anything else right now?
for Henry to be happy.
okay.
what do you think would make Henry happy?
I don't know.
think you do.
damn it! Anything but that.
wait, where are you going?
I'm done.
so your job was to...
get you to do the right thing, yeah.
well, why didn't you just tell me that in the first place?
would you have believed me? Mmm.
see ya, up there.
yeah? Well, if I see you, I know I'm not in heaven.
that's the spirit.
the yellow dress?
are you planning on wearing that, or taking it to Goodwill?
I haven't talked to him in months.
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.
how's the afterlife treatin' you?
you know, I think I lost weight.
I never looked this good when I was alive.
what do you want, Kate?
um... all right, this isn't easy for me, so...
you at a loss for words?
that's a first.
have you talked to Henry, you know, since...
since you broke us up?
no, I haven't.
as a matter of fact, I'm, uh, dating someone else.
no, you're not. You can't be.
Yes, I can, and we're goin' to Vegas.
well, stop! What about Henry?
what about him? You know what?
I am not interested in whatever sick game...you're playing, Kate.
no, listen to me. I'm being very serious.
I want you two together.
no sale.
I can't believe I'm begging you to date my husband.
okay, don't you still love him?
even if you weren't screwing with me right now...
which it's so clear that you are...
the answer would be no.
I moved on.
I mean, it killed me to do it, but I did it.
so just, um...
can you leave me alone now? Please?
get up!
get up!
Henry!
why can't you hear me?
get up!
everything okay over there?
who cares about the bird?
call Ashley!
Ashley. Call Ashley.
Ashley.
did you just say...
Ashley. - Who taught you that?
call Ashley. Call Ashley.
you want me to call Ashley?
what do you... I'm talking to my bird.
get up. Get up.
Kate?
is that you?
are you talking to me through my bird?
Yes.
why do you want me to...
call Ashley.
I got a machine.
airport. - What?
airport.
take the bird.
Oh, yeah.
in order to affect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions
and to ensure the common good
a state of emergency is declared for these territories by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett
duly appointed representative of His Majesty, the king
by decree, according to martial law, the following statutes are temporarily amended:
right to assembly, suspended.
right to habeas corpus, suspended.
right to legal counsel, suspended.
right to verdict by a jury of peers, suspended.
by decree, all persons found guilty of piracy,

shall be sentenced to hang by the neck until dead.
lord Beckett!
they've started to sing, sir.
finally. Thieves and beggars never shall we die Some men have died, and some are alive and others sail on the sea with the keys to the cage and the Devil to pay We lay to Fiddler's Green.The bell has been raised from its watery grave Hear its sepulchral tone.We are a call to all, pay head the squall Turn your sails to home Yo-ho haul together Hoist the colors high Heave-ho Thieve... Thief and beggar never say we die
a dangerous song to be singing...
...for any who are ignorant of its meaning.
particularly a woman.
particularly a woman alone.
what makes you think she's alone?
you protect her?
and what makes you think I need protecting?
your master's expecting us.
and an unexpected death'd cast a slight pall on our meeting.
pick those feet up!
on the double!
eyes front!
no, no, no. None.
it always takes me about a week to get my sea legs.
I was throwing up horribly the last time.
steady as she goes.
all right.
have you heard anything from Will?
I trust young Turner to acquire the charts and you to remember your place in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.
is he that terrifying?
he's much like myself, but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play.
do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery?
well, when you put it that way...
remove. Please.
remove. Please.
captain Barbossa, welcome to Singapore.
more steam.
none of that.
if things don't go the way we want, then we're the only chance they've got.
I understand that you have a request to make of me.
more of a proposal to put to ye.
I've a venture underway and I find myself in need of a ship and a crew.
hmm. It's an odd coincidence.
because you happen to have a ship and a crew you don't need?
no.
because earlier this day, not far from here, a thief broke into my most revered uncle's temple and tried to make off with these.
the navigational charts.
the route to the Farthest Gate.
wouldn't it be amazing if this venture of yours took you to the world beyond this one?
it would strain credulity at that.
this is the thief. Is his face familiar to you?
then I guess he has no further need for it.
no, no!
you come into my city and you betray my hospitality.
I assure you I had no idea... That he would get caught!
you intend to attempt the voyage to Davy Jones' Locker.
but I cannot help but wonder...
Why?
the song has been sung. The time is upon us.
we must convene the Brethren Court.
as one of the nine pirate lords, you must honor the call.
more steam.
more steam!
there is a price on all our heads. Aye.
it is true.
it seems the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore is by betraying other pirates.
we must put our differences aside.
wait for the signal.
the First Brethren Court gave us rule of the seas.
but now that rule is being challenged by Lord Cutler Beckett.
against East India Trading Company, what value is the Brethren Court?
what can any of us do?
you can fight! Get off me!
you are Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore.
you command in an age of piracy where bold captains sail free waters.
where waves aren't measured in feet, but as increments of fear, and those who pass the test become legend.
would you have that era come to an end on your watch?
the most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy, and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater!
Elizabeth Swann
there is more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?
and the eye does not go wanting.
but I cannot help but notice you have failed to answer my question.
what is it you seek in Davy Jones' Locker?
Jack Sparrow.
he's one of the pirate lords.
the only reason...
.I would want Jack Sparrow returned from the land of the dead...
...is so I can send him back myself!
Jack Sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight.
he failed to pass it along to a successor before he died.
so we must go and get him back.
so you admit...
...you have deceived me.
weapons!
weapons.
sao Feng, I assure you, our intentions are strictly honorable.
drop your weapons or I kill the man!
kill him. He's not our man.
if he's not with you, and he's not with us...
...Who's he with?
charge!
will!
look out! Look behind you!
ready!
fire.
chart!
Boo!
company! Make ready. Set. Fire!
company!
make ready. Set.
fire!
it's an odd coincidence, isn't it?
the East India Trading Company finds me the day you show up in Singapore.
it is coincidence only.
if you want to make a deal with Beckett, you need what I offer.
you cross Barbossa. You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.
why should I expect any better?
I need the Black Pearl to free my father.
you're helping me to get it.
fire in the hole.
thank you, Jack.
thank you, Jack.
you have the charts? And better yet.
a ship and a crew. Where's Sao Feng?
he'll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.
this way. Be quick.
haul the snotters with a will!
keep it taut.
secure provisions and stow the cargo.
there's no place left for Sao Feng to cower.
do you think he will honor the call?
I cannot say.
there's an evil on these seas that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.
a piece of eight.
nine of them, you say.
our new friend in Singapore was very specific, sir.
nine pieces of eight.
what's the significance of that, I wonder.
nothing can hold against the armada.
not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead.
nothing we know of.
did your friend mention where the Brethren Court are meeting?
he was mum on that, sir.
hmm.
then he knows the value of information.
better keep this between ourselves.
we don't want anyone running off to Singapore, do we?
Ah, admiral. You summoned me, Lord Beckett.
Yes. Something for you there.
your new station deserves an old friend.
not more requisition orders. No, sir.
execution.
the Brethren know they face extinction.
all that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand.
no one said anything about cold.
I'm sure there must be a good reason for our suffering.
why don't that obeah woman bring Jack back the same way she brought back Barbossa? Because Barbossa was only dead.
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul, to a place not of death, but punishment.
the worst fate a person can bring upon himself...
...Stretching on forever.
that's what awaits at Davy Jones' Locker.
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.
nothing here is set.
these can't be as accurate as modern charts.
no. But it leads to more places.
over the edge.
over again.
sunrise sets.
flash of green.
do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa?
ever gazed upon the green flash, Master Gibbs?
I reckon I seen my fair share. Happens on rare occasion.
the last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky.
some go their whole lives without ever seeing it.
some claim to have seen it who ain't. And some say...
it signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead.
sorry. Trust me, young Master Turner.
it's not getting to the land of the dead that's the problem.
it's getting back.
Bosun! Head to wind! Lift the sail!
aye, aye, sir!
bloody hell. There's nothing left.
jones is a loose cannon, sir.
fetch the chest.
and the governor?
he's been asking questions about the heart.
does he know?
then perhaps his usefulness has run its course.
step lively, men.
step lively!
stand fast!
steady, men.
go. All of you. And take that infernal thing with you.
I will not have it on my ship!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... because I will.
because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the company.
we need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they're alive.
the Dutchman sails as its captain commands.
and its captain is to sail it as commanded.
I would have thought you'd learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet.
this is no longer your world, Jones.
the immaterial has become...
...immaterial.
charge your bayonets.
how long do we continue not talking?
once we rescue Jack, everything'll be fine.
then we rescue Jack.
for what we want most...
...there is a cost must be paid in the end.
Barbossa, ahead! Aye, we're good and lost now.
lost? For certain you have to be lost to find a place as can't be found.
Elseways, everyone would know where it was.
we're gaining speed. Aye.
to stations!
all hands to stations!
huh?
rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.
nay! Belay that! Let her run straight and true!
blimey.
you've doomed us all. Don't be so unkind.
you may not survive to pass this way again, and these be the last friendly words you'll hear.
tie her off.
hard aport.
hold on!
strike your colors, you blooming cockroaches.
dead men tell no tales.
my peanut.
haul the halyard. Slacken braces.
aye, captain. Slacken braces.
step lively with a will.
aye, aye. Right away, sir.
I want a fire down below!
help. Man the yards, you filthy toads.
haul! Haul!
haul the sheets handsomely. Scandalize the lateens.
aye, sir. Right away, sir.
Mr. Sparrow? Aye, cap'n.
what say you about the condition of this tack line?
it be proper to my eyes, sir. Proper?
it is neither proper nor suitable, sir. It is not acceptable nor adequate.
it is, in obvious fact, an abomination.
begging your pardon, sir, but if you gave a man another chance.
shall I?
it's that sort of thinking got us into this mess.
we have lost speed and, therefore, time.
precious time, which cannot be recovered once lost.
do you understand?
aye, aye, captain. Do you now?
it will all have to be redone. All of it.
and let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you.
doldrums, sir, has the entire crew on edge.
I have no sympathy for any of you feculent maggots, and no more patience to pretend otherwise.
gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness.
no wind.
of course, there's no bloody wind.
my soul I do swear for a breeze.
gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.
Yes, sir, I know, but why? Why would he do that?
because he's a lummox, isn't he?
we shall have a magnificent garden party and you're not invited.
shoo.
a rock.
now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that before.
Oh.
a rope.
this truly is a godforsaken place.
I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone.
he's here.
Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took.
and does it matter?
we're trapped here by your doing. No different than Jack.
witty Jack is closer than you think.
impossible.
boat.
slap me thrice and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.
it's the captain! A sight for sore eyes.
hide the rum.
Mr. Gibbs. Aye, cap'n.
I thought so.
I expect you're able to account for your actions, then.
sir?
there's been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?
why is that, sir? Sir, you're...
you're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.
I know that. I know where I am.
and don't think I don't. Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow
Oh, Hector.
it's been too long. Hasn't it?
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me.
no, I didn't.
tia Dalma, out and about, eh?
you add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.
he thinks we're a hallucination.
William, tell me something:
have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel, or rather, damsel in distress? Either one.
no.
well, then, you wouldn't be here, would you?
so you can't be here. Q. E.D.you're not really here.
Jack
this is real. We're here.
the Locker, you say? Aye.
we've come to rescue you.
have you, now? That's very kind of you.
but it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing, and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.
I see my ship. Right there.
can't spot it.
must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.
Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones.
he controls the Flying Dutchman. He's taking over the seas.
the song has been sung. The Brethren Court is called.
leave you alone for a minute, look what happens. Everything's gone to pot.
Aye. The world needs you back something fierce.
and you need a crew.
why should I sail with any of you?
four of you have tried to kill me in the past. One of you succeeded.
Oh, she's not told you.
you'll have loads to talk about while you're here.
as for you...
now... don't tell me you didn't enjoy it at the time.
fair enough. All right, you're in.
don't need you. You scare me.
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but at least I'll have someone to talk to.
who are you?
Tai Huang. These are my men.
where do your allegiances lie? With the highest bidder.
I have a ship. That makes you the highest bidder.
good man. Weigh anchor, all hands. Prepare to make sail.
weigh anchor.
Jack...
which way are you going, Jack?
trim that sail. Slack windward brace and sheet.
haul the pennant line. Haul the pennant line.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? No, what are you doing?
what are you doing? No, what are you doing?
what are you? Captain gives orders on the ship.
the captain of the ship is giving orders.
my ship, makes me captain. They be my charts.
that makes you chartman.
stow it! The both of you! That's an order! Understand?!
sorry. I just thought with the captain issue in doubt,
I'd throw in my name for consideration.
sorry.
I'd vote for you. Yeah?
you left Jack to the Kraken.
he's rescued now. It's done with.
will, I had no choice.
you chose not to tell me.
I couldn't.
it wasn't your burden to bear.
but I did bear it, didn't I?
I just didn't know what it was.
I thought...
you thought I loved him.
if you make your choices alone, how can I trust you?
you can't.
eerie.
that's downright macabre.
I wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them?
be disrespectful, it would.
they should be in the care of Davy Jones.
that was the duty him was charged with by the goddess, Calypso.
to ferry those who die at sea to the other side.
and every ten years...
...he could come ashore...
...to be with she who love him... truly.
but the man has become a monster.
so he wasn't always... tentacley?
no.
he was a man...
...once.
now there's boats coming.
they're not a threat to us. Am I right?
we are nothing but ghosts to them.
it's best just let them be.
it's my father. We've made it back.
father! Father, here, look here!
Elizabeth
we're not back.
father!
Elizabeth. Are you dead?
no. No.
I think I am.
no, you can't be.
there was this chest, you see.
it's odd. At the time it seemed so important.
come aboard.
and a heart.
I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place.
and you will sail the seas for eternity.
the Dutchman must have a captain.
silly thing to die for.
someone, cast a line. Come back with us!
come on.
a touch... of destiny.
take the line.
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.
father, the line! Take the line!
she must not leave the ship! Father!
please come with us! Please! No! I won't leave you!
I'll give your love to your mother.
please, I won't let you go! Elizabeth
Elizabeth
is there a way?
him at peace.
no water.
why is all but the rum gone?
Rum's gone too.
if we cannot escape these doldrums before night,
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.
doomed to roam the reach between worlds.
forever.
with no water, forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon.
why doesn't he do something?
me eye. Give it back! There's no sense to it.
and the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise.
over the edge.Ah, it's driving me over the blooming edge.
sunrises don't set.
up is down.
well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.
why are these things never clear?
clear as mud, Jackie. What? Eh?
stab the heart. Don't stab the heart.
come again? The Dutchman must have a captain.
that's even more than less than unhelpful.
sail the seas for eternity.
I love the sea. What about port?
I prefer rum. Rum's good.
making port. Where we can get rum, and salty wenches...
once every 10 years. What'd he say?
once every 10 years. Ten years is a long time, mate.
even longer given the deficit of rum.
but eternity is longer still.
and how will you be spending it? Dead?
or not?
the immortal Captain Sparrow. Oh, I like that.
come sunset, it won't matter.
not sunset.
sundown.
and rise. Up.
what's that?
what is that? I don't know. What do you think?
where? There.
what is it?
he's rocking the ship.
we're rocking the ship.
Aye. He's onto it.
he's rocking the ship.
we'll tie each other to the mast upside down, so when the boat flips we'll be the right way up.
time it with the swell.
loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.
now up...
...is down.
this was your idea.
blessed sweet westerlies!
we're back!
it's the sunrise.
parley?
we need our pistols! Get untied, hurry!
all right, then!
the Brethren Court is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.
and, Jack, you and I are a-going. There'll be no arguing that point.
I is arguing the point.
if there's pirates a-gathering, I'm pointing my ship the other way.
the pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.
fight or not, you're not running, Jack.
if we don't stand together, they'll hunt us down one by one, till there be none left but you.
quite like the sound of that. " Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate. "
Aye.
and you'll be fighting Jones alone. How does that figure into your plan?
I'm still working on that.
but I will not be going back to the Locker, mate. Count on that.
wet powder.
wait! We can still use them as clubs!
Ow! Sorry. Effective, though.
there's fresh water on this island.
we can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later.
you lead the shore party. I'll stay with my ship.
I'll not be leaving my ship in your command.
why don't you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command.
temporarily.
mind the boat.
Criminy. Odds bodkins!
careful! Careful!
you stupid fish!
actually it's a cephalopod.
serves you right.
pin, I bet people would pay a shilling to see this.
and another shilling for a sketch of them sitting atop!
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.
we could serve up a slice as a souvenir.
still thinking of running, Jack?
think you can outrun the world?
you know, the problem with being the last of anything...
...By and by, there be none left at all.
sometimes things come back, mate. We're living proof, you and me.
aye, but that's a gamble of long odds, ain't it?
there's never a guarantee of coming back.
but passing on, that's dead certain.
summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it?
it's our only hope, lad.
that's a sad commentary in and of itself.
the world used to be a bigger place.
the world's still the same.
there's just... less in it.
poisoned. Fouled by the body.
eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!
singapore. Captain!
hoy!
we got company!
he's the captain.
sao Feng...
...you showing up here, it is truly a remarkable coincidence.
Jack Sparrow
you paid me great insult once.
that doesn't sound like me.
shall we just call it square, then?
release her.
she's not part of the bargain. And what bargain be that?
you heard Captain Turner.
release her! "Captain Turner"?
aye, the perfidious rotter led a mutiny against us!
I need the Pearl to free my father.
that's the only reason I came on this voyage.
why didn't you tell me you were planning this?
it was my burden to bear.
he needs the Pearl. Captain Turner needs the Pearl.
and you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court.
did no one come to save me just because they missed me?
I'm standing with them.
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an old friend who wants to see you first.
I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.
here is your chance to find out.
curious.
your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack.
perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman.
and so despair leads to betrayal.
but you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we?
it's not here, Jack.
what? What isn't?
the heart of Davy Jones. It's safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain.
by my reckoning, that account has been settled.
by your death?
and yet here you are.
close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream.
that's how I get by.
and if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival?
ship oars.
ship oars.
be on your guard, men.
my men are crew enough.
company ship, company crew.
you agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine.
and so it was.
perhaps you'll consider an alternative arrangement.
one which requires absolutely nothing from you but information.
regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt. In exchange for fair compensation?
square my debt with Jones...
...Guarantee my freedom?
of course.
it's just good business.
were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?
everything.
where are they meeting?
who are the pirate lords?
what is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight?
prepare the brig.
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine.
he's not going to give up the only ship as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?
shame they're not bound to honor the code of the Brethren, isn't it?
because honor's a hard thing to come by nowadays.
there is no honor to remaining with the losing side.
leaving it for the winning side, that's just good business.
the losing side, you say? They have the Dutchman.
now the Pearl!
and what do the Brethren have?
we have Calypso.
Calypso.
an old legend.
no. The goddess herself, bound in human form.
imagine all the power of the seas brought to bear against our enemy.
I intend to release her. But for that I need the Brethren Court.
all the Court.
you can keep Barbossa.
the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye, both.
and Turner. Especially Turner.
the rest go with me on the Pearl. I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will not hand me to Jones.
bloody fair deal, don't you think? And what becomes of Miss Swann?
what interest is she to you?
what are you proposing, captain?
what be accepting, cap'n?
the girl. What?
Jack
I've just recalled.
I've got this wonderful compass, which points to whatever I want.
so for what do I need you?
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.
out of the question.
it was not a question.
points to the thing you want most.
and that is not the Brethren Court, is it?
then what is, Jack? Me.
dead. Done.
what? Not done.
you got us into this. If it frees us, then done!
damn.
although, if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own.
cut out the middle man, as it were.
Elizabeth, they are pirates.
I have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates!
then we have an accord?
with me killed, you'd arrive at the cove, find it a stronghold, nigh impregnable...
...Able to withstand blockade for years.
then you'd be wishing,If only there was someone I had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates then come outside.
and you can accomplish all this?
you may kill me, but you may never insult me.
who am I?
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
done!
man overboard!
you're mad.
thank goodness. If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.
and that was without even a single drop of rum.
send this pestilent, traitorous, cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.
which ship do we follow?
signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.
how soon can we have the ship ready to pursue?
she's going down!
stand clear!
do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?
sir.
by this time tomorrow, we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.
Calypso.
excuse me?
not a name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have...
...but it is what we call you.
we being who?
you confirm it.
confirm what?
you've told me nothing. The Brethren Court, not I.
the First Brethren Court, whose decision I would have opposed.
they bound you to human form so the rule of the seas would belong to man and not...
to me.
but one such as you should never be anything less than what you are.
pretty speech from a captor.
but words whispered through prison bars lose their charm.
can I be blamed for my efforts?
all men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be.
and some men offer desire as justification for their crimes.
I offer simply my desire.
and in return?
I would have your gifts, should you choose to give them.
and if I should choose not?
then I will take...
...your fury.
sao Feng?
here.
please.
with all nine pieces of eight...
...you will be free.
take it!
you are captain now.
me?
go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.
captain! The ship is taken. We cannot...
forgive me... Calypso.
sao.
what did he tell you?
he made me captain.
set! Fire!
you are not my captain.
Elizabeth
James James
thank God, you're alive.
your father'll be overjoyed to know you're safe. My father's dead.
no, that can't be true. He returned to England.
did Lord Beckett tell you that?
who among you do you name as captain?
captain. Her.
her.
captain?
tow the ship. Put the prisoners in the brig.
the captain shall have my quarters.
thank you, sir.
but I prefer to remain with my crew. Elizabeth. Elizabeth
I swear.
I did not know.
know what? Which side you chose?
well, now you do.
Bootstrap?
Bootstrap.
bill Turner?
Bootstrap.
you know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
will Turner
william
he made it. He's alive.
and now he sends you to tell me that he's coming to get me.
God's wounds. He's on his way.
Yes, Will is alive.
and he wants to help you.
he can't help me. He won't come.
but you're his father.
I know you.
he spoke of you.
he can't save me. He can't come because of you.
me?
you're Elizabeth.
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.
if Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place.
captain... Forever.
the Dutchman must always have a captain.
and if he saves me...
...he loses you.
I see.
he won't pick me.
I wouldn't pick me.
tell him not to come.
tell him to stay away.
tell him it's too late.
I'm already a part of the ship...
...and the crew.
Bootstrap.
you know my name.
you know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
william
he's coming for me.
wait and see.
you'll see.
he promised.
swing her over.
ready those lines.
sir.
a breadcrumb trail.
and we're meant to follow. A betrayer among them?
or a trap? A gambit by a skilled opponent.
adjust course, lieutenant. Sir?
we can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies.
you escaped the brig even quicker than I expected.
William, do you notice anything?
rather...
...do you notice something that is not there to be noticed?
you haven't raised an alarm. Odd, isn't it?
not as odd as this.
come up with this all by your Ionesome, did you?
I said to myself,"Think like Jack.
this is what you've arrived at?
lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust...
...accomplish your own ends?
it's like you don't know me at all.
and how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan?
Ah.
you've not seen fit to trust her with it.
I'm losing her, Jack.
every step I make for my father is a step away from Elizabeth.
if you choose to lock your heart away, you'll lose her for certain.
if I might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket...
...avoid the choice altogether.
change the facts.
let someone else dispatch Jones.
who?
you?
death has a curious way of reshuffling one's priorities.
I slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing, your father's free from his debt, you're free to be with your charming murderess.
you're willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman...
...forever? No, mate. I'm free forever.
free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map. Free from death itself.
you have to do the job though, Jack.
you have to ferry souls to the next world.
I don't have the face for tentacles.
but immortal has to count for something, eh?
what's this for?
think like me. It'll come to you.
my regards to Davy Jones.
I hate him.
come with me.
quickly.
what are you doing?
choosing a side.
do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren.
I fear there may be a traitor among them.
it's too late to earn my forgiveness.
I had nothing to do with your father's death.
but that does not absolve me of my other sins.
come with us.
James, come with me.
who goes there?
go. I will follow.
you're lying.
our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth...
...but never joined.
go, now.
back to your station, sailor.
no one leaves the ship. Stand down. That's an order.
that's an order.
part of the crew, part of the ship.
part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew...
steady, man. Part of the crew, part of the ship.
all hands, prisoner escape!
belay that! James! James!
prisoner escape!
James! No!
the admiral's dead. Admiral's dead?
the admiral's dead. Admiral's dead.
to the captain's cabin! Aye!
back to the ship.
James Norrington. Do you fear death?
I take that as a "no.
nice sword.
the Dutchman is under my command.
for now.
look alive and keep a weather eye.
not for naught it's called Shipwreck Island.
where lies Shipwreck Cove and the town of Shipwreck.
you heard him. Step lively.
for all that pirates are clever clogs, we are unimaginative when it comes to naming things.
Aye.
I once sailed with a geezer who lost both of his arms and part of his eye.
What'd you call him?
Larry.
I do not renege on a bargain once struck.
but we agreed on ends only.
the means are mine to decide.
caution, Barbossa.
do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead.
or what it mean if you fail me.
don't you forget why you had to bring me back.
why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate.
it took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso.
and it'll take no less than nine to set you free.
masters Pintel and Ragetti.
take this fishwife to the brig.
right this way, Mrs. Fish.
I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup.
apparently, you can.
I believe you know each other.
come to join my crew again, Master Turner?
not yours.
his.
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.
sparrow?
you didn't tell him.
we rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl.
what else have you not told me?
there is an issue far more troublesome.
I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso.
not a person.
a heathen god.
one who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash.
the world is well rid of her. Not quite so well, actually.
the Brethren Court intends to release her.
No! They cannot!
the First Court promised to imprison her forever.
that was our agreement. Your agreement?
I showed them how to bind her.
she could not be trusted.
I... She gave me no choice.
we must act before they release her.
you loved her.
she's the one.
and then you betrayed her.
she pretended to love me.
she betrayed me.
and after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder.
do not test me.
I hadn't finished that.
you will free my father.
and you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety.
along with my own.
your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.
we will expect fair value in return.
there is only one price I will accept:
calypso murdered.
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.
Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.
and with you no longer aboard her, how do you propose to lead us there?
what is it you want most?
look at them all.
there's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime.
and I owe them all money.
as he who issued summons,
I convene this, the Fourth Brethren Court.
to confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow cap'ns.
those aren't pieces of eight. They're just pieces of junk.
Aye. The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.
but when the First Court met, the Brethren were to a one skint broke.
so change the name.
to "nine pieces of whatever we happened to have in our pockets at the time?
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.
master Ragetti, if you will.
I kept it safe, just like you said when you gave it to me.
aye, you have. But now I need it back.
sparrow
might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us.
sao Feng is dead.
he fell to the Flying Dutchman.
the plagued ship.
he made you captain? They're giving the bloody title away now.
listen. Listen to me.
our location has been betrayed.
jones is under the command of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.
who is this betrayer? Not likely anyone among us.
Where's Will? Not among us.
it matters not how they found us. The question is, what will we do now that they have?
we fight.
shipwreck Cove is a fortress.
a well-supplied fortress.
there is no need to fight if they cannot get to us.
there be a third course.
in another age, at this very spot, the First Brethren Court captured the sea goddess and bound her in her bones.
that was a mistake.
Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye.
but opened the door to Beckett and his ilk.
better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat of a man's brow and the strength of his back alone.
you all know this to be true.
gentlemen.
ladies.
we must free Calypso.
shoot him. Cut out his tongue!
shoot him, cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.
sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.
calypso was our enemy then, she will be our enemy now.
it's unlikely her mood's improved.
I would still agree with Sao Feng. We release Calypso.
you threaten me? I silence you.
this is madness. This is politics.
meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us.
if they not be here already.
my sweet.
you come for me.
you were expecting me. It has been torture.
trapped in this single form.
cut off from the sea.
from all that I love.
from you.
ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me.
ten years I looked after those who died at sea.
and, finally, when we could be together again...
...you weren't there.
why weren't you there?
it's my nature.
would you love me if I was anything but what I am?
I do not love you.
many things you were, Davy Jones.
but never cruel.
you have corrupted your purpose...
...and so your self.
and you did hide away what should always have been mine.
Calypso.
I will be free.
and when I am, I would give you my heart.
and we would be together always.
if only you had a heart to give.
why did you come?
and what fate have you planned for your captors?
the Brethren Court?
all of them, the last thing they will learn in this life...
...is how cruel I can be.
and what of your fate, Davy Jones?
my heart will always belong to you.
it was the First Court what imprisoned Calypso.
we should be the ones to set her free.
and in her gratitude, she will see fit to grant us boons.
whose boons? Your boons?
utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.
if you have a better alternative, please, share.
cuttlefish.
Aye.
let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.
flipping glorious little sausages.
pen them up together, they'll devour each other without a second thought.
human nature, isn't it?
or... Or fish nature.
so, yes, we could hole up here well-provisioned and well-armed.
half of us would be dead within the month.
which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it. Or...
uh...
as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful.
I rather doubt it.
can we pretend she's anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.
we are left with but one option.
I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of me mouth...
...Captain Swann. We must fight.
you've always run away from a fight. Have not.
have so. Have not.
have so. Have not!
you have so, and you know it. Have not. Slander and calumny.
I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
I submit that here now that is what we all must do:
we must fight to run away.
Aye! Aye!
as per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king.
you made that up. Did I, now?
I call on Cap'n Teague, keeper of the code.
sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly!
hang the code. Who cares a...?
code is the law.
you're in my way, boy.
the code. The code.
as set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.
that can't... How did... Sea turtles, mate.
sea turtles.
Ah. Barbossa is right.
hang on a minute.
it shall be the duties, as the king, to declare war, parley with shared adversaries...
fancy that.
there has not been a king since the First Court.
and that's not likely to change.
not likely. Why not?
see, the pirate king is elected by popular vote.
and each pirate only ever votes for hisself.
I call for a vote.
I vote for Ammand the corsair.
Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman.
sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee.
mistress Ching.
gentleman Jocard.
Elizabeth Swann Barbossa
Vallenueva
Elizabeth Swann
what? I know. Curious, isn't it?
vote for me. Vote for me.
what you talking about?
No!
am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then?
very well.
what say you, Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court?
prepare every vessel that floats.
at dawn...
...we're at war.
and so we shall go to war.
what?
you've seen it all, done it all. You survived.
that's the trick, isn't it? To survive?
it's not just about living forever, Jackie.
the trick is living with yourself forever.
how's Mum?
she looks great.
the enemy is here! Let's take them!
abandon ship. Abandon ship.
parley?
you be the cur that led these wolves to our door.
don't blame Turner. He was merely the tool of your betrayal.
if you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left.
my hands are clean in this.
figuratively.
my actions were my own and to my own purpose.
Jack had nothing to do with it. Well spoke. Listen to the tool.
will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.
I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost.
no cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it.
if Turner wasn't acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this?
you made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates. And here they are.
don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward.
your debt to me is still to be satisfied.
one hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman. As a start.
that debt was paid, mate. With some help.
you escaped. Technically.
I propose an exchange.
will leaves with us...
...and you can take Jack.
done.
undone. Done.
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right.
king.
as you command, your nibs. Blackguard!
if ye have something to say, I might be saying something as well.
first to the finish, then?
do you fear death?
you've no idea.
advise your Brethren, you can fight, and all of you will die.
or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.
you murdered my father.
he chose his own fate.
and you have chosen yours.
we will fight.
and you will die.
so be it.
king?
of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack.
maybe he really does know what he's doing.
Bravo!
you've successfully arrived aboard the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.
look Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.
except for this sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork.
go away.
what, back to the Locker? Not without you, Jackie.
stab the heart.
live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman.
then again...
...if you're in the brig...
...who's to stab the heart?
does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach.
peanut.
we'll need to use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack.
Oh, will we now? All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.
Barbossa, you can't release her.
we need to give Jack a chance.
apologies, Your Majesty. Too long my fate has not been in me own hands.
no longer.
the enemy has opted for oblivion.
ready the fleet.
to your stations. To your stations.
be there some manner of rite or incantation?
Aye.
the items brought together, done.
items to be burned...
...and someone must speak the words:
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds.
is that it?
tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover.
Ooh!
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds!
is that it? No, no, no. He didn't say it right.
he didn't...
you have to say it right.
Calypso...
...I release you from your human bonds.
tia Dalma
Calypso.
when the Brethren Court imprisoned you, who was it that told them how?
who was it that betrayed you? Name him.
Davy Jones
this is it! This is it!
Calypso!
I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite.
I have fulfilled me vow and now ask your favor.
spare meself, me ship, me crew...
...but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters...
...or mine.
is that it?
why, she's no help at all.
what now?
nothing.
our final hope has failed us.
it's not over. There's still a fight to be had.
we've an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there's no chance.
there's only a fool's chance.
revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for.
you're right.
then what shall we die for?
you will listen to me.
listen!
the Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.
and what will they see?
frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No.
no, they will see free men and freedom!
and what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons.
they will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do.
by the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs...
...and the courage of our hearts.
gentlemen...
...hoist the colors.
hoist the colors.
hoist the colors. Hoist the colors!
Aye.
the wind's on our side, boys. That's all we need!
hoist the colors!
we have a favorable wind, sir.
Oh, so we do.
signal Jones to give no quarter.
that should brighten his day.
to arms! We give no quarter!
Calypso.
have you noticed, on top of everything, it's raining?
that's a bad sign.
man the capstan. Raise the main topyard. Keep that powder dry.
Maelstrom!
captain Barbossa!
we need you at the helm.
aye, that be true.
brace up yards, you cack-handed deck apes.
dying is the day worth living for.

admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere?
someone has to stay and guard the chest.
there's no question, there's a breakdown in military discipline on this vessel.
I blame the fish people.
Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people?
seems contributory, is all I'm suggesting.
it's true, if there were no fish people, there'd be no need to guard the chest.
and if there were no chest we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.
prepare to board!
cover!
No!
lookee here, boys. A lost bird.
a lost bird that never learned to fly.
to my great regret.
but...
...never too late to learn, eh?
Whoa!
the chest, hand it over.
I can set you free, mate.
my freedOm waS fOrfeit IOng agO.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth...
will you marry me?
I don't think now's the best time.
now may be the only time.
I love you.
I've made my choice. What's yours?
Barbossa. Barbossa
marry us.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
Barbossa, now.
fine, then.
dearly beloved, we be gathered here today...
to nail your gizzards to the mast, you poxy cur.
Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband? Elizabeth Swann...
I do. Great.
will Turner, do you take me...
...to be your wife...
...in sickness and in health...
...with health being the less likely?
I do.
as captain, I now pronounce you...
you may kiss...
you may kiss...
just kiss.
leave it.
you can do nothing without the key.
I already have the key.
no, you don't.
Oh, that key.
No!
oi. My pistol.
Turner. Turner
fire!
thank you, Jack.
stop! It's me.
it's Will. Your son.
ha!
go!
harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.
that's why I brought this.
I'm not going to kill you. I made you a promise.
missed.
did you forget? I'm a heartless wretch.
Ah. Love.
a dreadful bond.
and yet, so easily severed.
tell me, William Turner, do you fear death?
do you?
heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand.
you're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.
cruel is a matter of perspective.
is it?
will?
look at me! Stay with me! You're all right.
William?
my son.
will? Will? Look at me. Look at me!
you will not forestall my judgment.
Calypso.
she's taking us down! Make quick or it's the Locker for us all!
no.
no, no.
No!
part of the crew. Part of the ship, part of the crew.
part of the ship, part of the crew.
don't leave me.
don't. No!
I won't leave you.
the Dutchman must have a captain.
hold on.
thank goodness, Jack.
the armada's still out there. The Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard, and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
never actually been one for tradition.
close haul her. Luff the sails and lay her in irons.
belay that, or we'll be a sitting duck.
belay that "belay that.
but the arma... Belay.
the Endeav... Stow. Shut it.
what are they waiting for?
he expects us to honor our agreement.
ready guns and gun ports.
it's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business.
Ah, she survived.
ready on the guns. Guns ready.
full canvas.
aye, full canvas.
orders, sir.
sir!
cap'n.
fire. Fire!
fire! Fire!
fire, all!
orders? Orders, sir?
sir, what do you command?
it's just good business.
abandon ship!
abandon ship! All hands, abandon ship!
they're turning away!
wind in your sails.
shiver me timbers.
captain Turner!
Mr. Gibbs. Cap'n?
you may throw my hat if you like. Aye, aye, cap'n.
Hooray!
now go and get it.
orders, sir?
you're no longer bound to the Dutchman. You're free.
Aye.
that's a fine thing, but...
...By my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid.
if you'll have me.
on the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.
aye, Captain Turner.
this ship has a purpose again.
and where we are bound she cannot come.
one day ashore.
ten years at sea.
that's a steep price for what's been done.
depends on the one day.
your chariot awaits, Your Highness.
the oars are inside.
Mrs. Turner.
goodbye, poppet.
Jack.
it would never have worked out between us.
keep telling yourself that, darling.
once was quite enough.
thank you.
I'm going to need the other one.
it's nearly sunset.
it's always belonged to you.
will you keep it safe?
Yes.
Yes.
will!
keep a weather eye on the horizon.
granted it tends to list to port, and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women.
but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
is that it?
the Black Pearl?
it's not very big.
love, that is a dinghy.
my vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and...
...gone. Why is it gone?
is that it there?
Yes, there it is.
why is it there?
it's much larger up close.
Jack, you promised to take us for a ride.
I was to be given the first ride. What? You?
not what he said. I never!
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason why my ship is gone?
the ship? We're on the ship.
Jack! The ship's gone!
Really?
ladies! Will you please shut it?
listen to me. Yes, I lied to you.
no, I don't love you.
of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels.
it is pronounced "egregious.
by the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies.
and all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy?
take what you can. Give nothing back.
tell me, ladies, what do you know of sea turtles?
sea turtles?
let me tell you the amazing story of Cap...
all men up the ratlines.
all men up the ratlines!
Oh, you want a taste of this?
Oh, that's a good boy! You're Daddy's boy.
Oh, yes, you are. Oh, yes, you are.
sir?
some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind. Again.
again. Is that so?
it would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about.
on the charts. Aye.
with our own eyes.
to help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak.
Ah.
feast your eyes upon this, mateys.
there's more than one way to live forever.
gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth.
sparrow.
steady, men.
go. All of you. And take that infernal thing with you.
I will not have it on my ship!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... because I will.
because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the company.
we need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they're alive.
the Dutchman sails as its captain commands.
and its captain is to sail it as commanded.
I would have thought you'd learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet.
this is no longer your world, Jones.
the immaterial has become...
...immaterial.
charge your bayonets.
how long do we continue not talking?
once we rescue Jack, everything'll be fine.
then we rescue Jack.
for what we want most...
...there is a cost must be paid in the end.
Barbossa, ahead! Aye, we're good and lost now.
lost? For certain you have to be lost to find a place as can't be found.
Elseways, everyone would know where it was.
we're gaining speed. Aye.
to stations!
all hands to stations!
huh?
rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.
nay! Belay that! Let her run straight and true!
blimey.
you've doomed us all. Don't be so unkind.
you may not survive to pass this way again, and these be the last friendly words you'll hear.
tie her off.
hard aport.
hold on!
strike your colors, you blooming cockroaches.
dead men tell no tales.
my peanut.
haul the halyard. Slacken braces.
aye, captain. Slacken braces.
step lively with a will.
aye, aye. Right away, sir.
I want a fire down below!
help. Man the yards, you filthy toads.
haul! Haul!
haul the sheets handsomely. Scandalize the lateens.
aye, sir. Right away, sir.
Mr. Sparrow? Aye, cap'n.
what say you about the condition of this tack line?
it be proper to my eyes, sir. Proper?
it is neither proper nor suitable, sir. It is not acceptable nor adequate.
it is, in obvious fact, an abomination.
begging your pardon, sir, but if you gave a man another chance.
shall I?
it's that sort of thinking got us into this mess.
we have lost speed and, therefore, time.
precious time, which cannot be recovered once lost.
do you understand?
aye, aye, captain. Do you now?
it will all have to be redone. All of it.
and let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you.
doldrums, sir, has the entire crew on edge.
I have no sympathy for any of you feculent maggots, and no more patience to pretend otherwise.
gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness.
no wind.
of course, there's no bloody wind.
my soul I do swear for a breeze.
gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.
Yes, sir, I know, but why? Why would he do that?
because he's a lummox, isn't he?
we shall have a magnificent garden party and you're not invited.
shoo.
a rock.
now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that before.
Oh.
a rope.
this truly is a godforsaken place.
I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone.
he's here.
Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took.
and does it matter?
we're trapped here by your doing. No different than Jack.
witty Jack is closer than you think.
impossible.
boat.
slap me thrice and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.
it's the captain! A sight for sore eyes.
hide the rum.
Mr. Gibbs. Aye, cap'n.
I thought so.
I expect you're able to account for your actions, then.
sir?
there's been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?
why is that, sir? Sir, you're...
you're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.
I know that. I know where I am.
and don't think I don't. Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow
Oh, Hector.
it's been too long. Hasn't it?
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me.
no, I didn't.
tia Dalma, out and about, eh?
you add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.
he thinks we're a hallucination.
William, tell me something:
have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel, or rather, damsel in distress? Either one.
no.
well, then, you wouldn't be here, would you?
so you can't be here. Q. E.D.you're not really here.
Jack
this is real. We're here.
the Locker, you say? Aye.
we've come to rescue you.
have you, now? That's very kind of you.
but it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing, and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.
I see my ship. Right there.
can't spot it.
must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.
Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones.
he controls the Flying Dutchman. He's taking over the seas.
the song has been sung. The Brethren Court is called.
leave you alone for a minute, look what happens. Everything's gone to pot.
Aye. The world needs you back something fierce.
and you need a crew.
why should I sail with any of you?
four of you have tried to kill me in the past. One of you succeeded.
Oh, she's not told you.
you'll have loads to talk about while you're here.
as for you...
now... don't tell me you didn't enjoy it at the time.
fair enough. All right, you're in.
don't need you. You scare me.
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but at least I'll have someone to talk to.
who are you?
Tai Huang. These are my men.
where do your allegiances lie? With the highest bidder.
I have a ship. That makes you the highest bidder.
good man. Weigh anchor, all hands. Prepare to make sail.
weigh anchor.
Jack...
which way are you going, Jack?
trim that sail. Slack windward brace and sheet.
haul the pennant line. Haul the pennant line.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? No, what are you doing?
what are you doing? No, what are you doing?
what are you? Captain gives orders on the ship.
the captain of the ship is giving orders.
my ship, makes me captain. They be my charts.
that makes you chartman.
stow it! The both of you! That's an order! Understand?!
sorry. I just thought with the captain issue in doubt,
I'd throw in my name for consideration.
sorry.
I'd vote for you. Yeah?
you left Jack to the Kraken.
he's rescued now. It's done with.
will, I had no choice.
you chose not to tell me.
I couldn't.
it wasn't your burden to bear.
but I did bear it, didn't I?
I just didn't know what it was.
I thought...
you thought I loved him.
if you make your choices alone, how can I trust you?
you can't.
eerie.
that's downright macabre.
I wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them?
be disrespectful, it would.
they should be in the care of Davy Jones.
that was the duty him was charged with by the goddess, Calypso.
to ferry those who die at sea to the other side.
and every ten years...
...he could come ashore...
...to be with she who love him... truly.
but the man has become a monster.
so he wasn't always... tentacley?
no.
he was a man once.
now there's boats coming.
they're not a threat to us. Am I right?
we are nothing but ghosts to them.
it's best just let them be.
it's my father. We've made it back.
father! Father, here, look here!
Elizabeth
we're not back.
father!
Elizabeth. Are you dead?
no. No.
I think I am.
no, you can't be.
there was this chest, you see.
it's odd. At the time it seemed so important.
come aboard.
and a heart.
I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place.
and you will sail the seas for eternity.
the Dutchman must have a captain.
silly thing to die for.
someone, cast a line. Come back with us!
come on.
a touch... of destiny.
take the line.
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.
father, the line! Take the line!
she must not leave the ship! Father!
please come with us! Please! No! I won't leave you!
I'll give your love to your mother.
please, I won't let you go! Elizabeth
Elizabeth
is there a way?
him at peace.
no water.
why is all but the rum gone?
Rum's gone too.
if we cannot escape these doldrums before night,
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.
doomed to roam the reach between worlds.
forever.
with no water, forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon.
why doesn't he do something?
me eye. Give it back! There's no sense to it.
and the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise.
over the edge.Ah, it's driving me over the blooming edge.
sunrises don't set.
up is down.
well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.
why are these things never clear?
clear as mud, Jackie. What? Eh?
stab the heart. Don't stab the heart.
come again? The Dutchman must have a captain.
that's even more than less than unhelpful.
sail the seas for eternity.
I love the sea. What about port?
I prefer rum. Rum's good.
making port. Where we can get rum, and salty wenches...
once every 10 years. What'd he say?
once every 10 years. Ten years is a long time, mate.
even longer given the deficit of rum.
but eternity is longer still.
and how will you be spending it? Dead?
or not?
the immortal Captain Sparrow. Oh, I like that.
come sunset, it won't matter.
not sunset.
sundown.
and rise. Up.
what's that?
what is that? I don't know. What do you think?
where? There.
what is it?
he's rocking the ship.
we're rocking the ship.
Aye. He's onto it.
he's rocking the ship.
we'll tie each other to the mast upside down, so when the boat flips we'll be the right way up.
time it with the swell.
loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.
now up...
...is down.
this was your idea.
blessed sweet westerlies!
we're back!
it's the sunrise.
parley?
we need our pistols! Get untied, hurry!
all right, then!
the Brethren Court is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.
and, Jack, you and I are a-going. There'll be no arguing that point.
I is arguing the point.
if there's pirates a-gathering, I'm pointing my ship the other way.
the pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.
fight or not, you're not running, Jack.
if we don't stand together, they'll hunt us down one by one, till there be none left but you.
quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.
Aye.
and you'll be fighting Jones alone. How does that figure into your plan?
I'm still working on that.
but I will not be going back to the Locker, mate. Count on that.
wet powder.
wait! We can still use them as clubs!
Ow! Sorry. Effective, though.
there's fresh water on this island.
we can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later.
you lead the shore party. I'll stay with my ship.
I'll not be leaving my ship in your command.
why don't you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command.
temporarily.
mind the boat.
Criminy. Odds bodkins!
careful! Careful!
you stupid fish!
actually it's a cephalopod.
serves you right.
pin, I bet people would pay a shilling to see this.
and another shilling for a sketch of them sitting atop!
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.
we could serve up a slice as a souvenir.
still thinking of running, Jack?
think you can outrun the world?
you know, the problem with being the last of anything...
...By and by, there be none left at all.
sometimes things come back, mate. We're living proof, you and me.
aye, but that's a gamble of long odds, ain't it?
there's never a guarantee of coming back.
but passing on, that's dead certain.
summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it?
it's our only hope, lad.
that's a sad commentary in and of itself.
the world used to be a bigger place.
the world's still the same.
there's just... less in it.
poisoned. Fouled by the body.
eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!
singapore. Captain!
hoy!
we got company!
he's the captain.
sao Feng...
...you showing up here, it is truly a remarkable coincidence.
Jack Sparrow
you paid me great insult once.
that doesn't sound like me.
shall we just call it square, then?
release her.
she's not part of the bargain. And what bargain be that?
you heard Captain Turner.
release her! "Captain Turner"?
aye, the perfidious rotter led a mutiny against us!
I need the Pearl to free my father.
that's the only reason I came on this voyage.
why didn't you tell me you were planning this?
it was my burden to bear.
he needs the Pearl. Captain Turner needs the Pearl.
and you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court.
did no one come to save me just because they missed me?
I'm standing with them.
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an old friend who wants to see you first.
I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.
here is your chance to find out.
curious.
your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack.
perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman.
and so despair leads to betrayal.
but you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we?
it's not here, Jack.
what? What isn't?
the heart of Davy Jones. It's safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain.
by my reckoning, that account has been settled.
by your death?
and yet here you are.
close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream.
that's how I get by.
and if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival?
ship oars.
ship oars.
be on your guard, men.
my men are crew enough.
company ship, company crew.
you agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine.
and so it was.
perhaps you'll consider an alternative arrangement.
one which requires absolutely nothing from you but information.
regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt. In exchange for fair compensation?
square my debt with Jones...
...guarantee my freedom?
of course.
it's just good business.
were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?
everything.
where are they meeting?
who are the pirate lords?
what is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight?
prepare the brig.
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine.
he's not going to give up the only ship as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?
shame they're not bound to honor the code of the Brethren, isn't it?
because honor's a hard thing to come by nowadays.
there is no honor to remaining with the losing side.
leaving it for the winning side, that's just good business.
the losing side, you say? They have the Dutchman.
now the Pearl!
and what do the Brethren have?
we have Calypso.
Calypso.
an old legend.
no. The goddess herself, bound in human form.
imagine all the power of the seas brought to bear against our enemy.
I intend to release her. But for that I need the Brethren Court.
all the Court.
you can keep Barbossa.
the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye, both.
and Turner. Especially Turner.
the rest go with me on the Pearl. I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will not hand me to Jones.
bloody fair deal, don't you think? And what becomes of Miss Swann?
what interest is she to you?
what are you proposing, captain?
what be accepting, cap'n?
the girl. What?
Jack
I've just recalled.
I've got this wonderful compass, which points to whatever I want.
so for what do I need you?
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.
out of the question.
it was not a question.
points to the thing you want most.
and that is not the Brethren Court, is it?
then what is, Jack? Me.
dead. Done.
what? Not done.
you got us into this. If it frees us, then done!
damn.
although, if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own.
cut out the middle man, as it were.
Elizabeth, they are pirates.
I have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates!
then we have an accord?
with me killed, you'd arrive at the cove, find it a stronghold, nigh impregnable...
...able to withstand blockade for years.
then you'd be wishing,"If only there was someone I had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates then come outside. "
and you can accomplish all this?
you may kill me, but you may never insult me.
who am I?
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
done!
man overboard!
you're mad.
thank goodness. If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.
and that was without even a single drop of rum.
send this pestilent, traitorous, cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.
which ship do we follow?
signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.
how soon can we have the ship ready to pursue?
she's going down!
stand clear!
do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?
sir.
by this time tomorrow, we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.
Calypso.
excuse me?
not a name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have...
...but it is what we call you.
'we " being who?
you confirm it.
confirm what?
you've told me nothing. The Brethren Court, not I.
the First Brethren Court, whose decision I would have opposed.
they bound you to human form so the rule of the seas would belong to man and not...
to me.
but one such as you should never be anything less than what you are.
pretty speech from a captor.
but words whispered through prison bars lose their charm.
can I be blamed for my efforts?
all men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be.
and some men offer desire as justification for their crimes.
I offer simply my desire.
and in return?
I would have your gifts, should you choose to give them.
and if I should choose not?
then I will take...
...your fury.
sao Feng?
here.
please.
with all nine pieces of eight...
...you will be free.
take it!
you are captain now.
me?
go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.
captain! The ship is taken. We cannot...
forgive me... Calypso.
sao.
what did he tell you?
he made me captain.
set! Fire!
you are not my captain.
Elizabeth
James James
thank God, you're alive.
your father'll be overjoyed to know you're safe. My father's dead.
no, that can't be true. He returned to England.
did Lord Beckett tell you that?
who among you do you name as captain?
captain. Her.
her.
captain?
tow the ship. Put the prisoners in the brig.
the captain shall have my quarters.
thank you, sir.
but I prefer to remain with my crew. Elizabeth. Elizabeth
I swear.
I did not know.
know what? Which side you chose?
well, now you do.
Bootstrap?
Bootstrap.
bill Turner?
Bootstrap.
you know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
will Turner
william
he made it. He's alive.
and now he sends you to tell me that he's coming to get me.
God's wounds. He's on his way.
Yes, Will is alive.
and he wants to help you.
he can't help me. He won't come.
but you're his father.
I know you.
he spoke of you.
he can't save me. He can't come because of you.
me?
you're Elizabeth.
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.
if Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place.
captain... Forever.
the Dutchman must always have a captain.
and if he saves me...
...he loses you.
I see.
he won't pick me.
I wouldn't pick me.
tell him not to come.
tell him to stay away.
tell him it's too late.
I'm already a part of the ship...
...and the crew.
Bootstrap.
you know my name.
you know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
william
he's coming for me.
wait and see.
you'll see.
he promised.
swing her over.
ready those lines.
sir.
a breadcrumb trail.
and we're meant to follow. A betrayer among them?
or a trap? A gambit by a skilled opponent.
adjust course, lieutenant. Sir?
we can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies.
you escaped the brig even quicker than I expected.
William, do you notice anything?
rather...
...do you notice something that is not there to be noticed?
you haven't raised an alarm. Odd, isn't it?
not as odd as this.
come up with this all by your Ionesome, did you?
I said to myself,think like Jack.
this is what you've arrived at?
lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust...
...accomplish your own ends?
it's like you don't know me at all.
and how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan?
Ah.
you've not seen fit to trust her with it.
I'm losing her, Jack.
every step I make for my father is a step away from Elizabeth.
if you choose to lock your heart away, you'll lose her for certain.
if I might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket...
...avoid the choice altogether.
change the facts.
let someone else dispatch Jones.
who?
you?
death has a curious way of reshuffling one's priorities.
I slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing, your father's free from his debt, you're free to be with your charming murderess.
you're willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman...
...forever? No, mate. I'm free forever.
free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map. Free from death itself.
you have to do the job though, Jack.
you have to ferry souls to the next world.
I don't have the face for tentacles.
but immortal has to count for something, eh?
what's this for?
think like me. It'll come to you.
my regards to Davy Jones.
I hate him.
come with me.
quickly.
what are you doing?
choosing a side.
do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren.
I fear there may be a traitor among them.
it's too late to earn my forgiveness.
I had nothing to do with your father's death.
but that does not absolve me of my other sins.
come with us.
James, come with me.
who goes there?
go. I will follow.
you're lying.
our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth...
...but never joined.
go, now.
back to your station, sailor.
no one leaves the ship. Stand down. That's an order.
that's an order.
part of the crew, part of the ship.
part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew...
steady, man. Part of the crew, part of the ship.
all hands, prisoner escape!
belay that! James! James!
prisoner escape!
James! No!
the admiral's dead. Admiral's dead?
the admiral's dead. Admiral's dead.
to the captain's cabin! Aye!
back to the ship.
James Norrington. Do you fear death?
I take that as a no.
nice sword.
the Dutchman is under my command.
for now.
look alive and keep a weather eye.
not for naught it's called Shipwreck Island.
where lies Shipwreck Cove and the town of Shipwreck.
you heard him. Step lively.
for all that pirates are clever clogs, we are unimaginative when it comes to naming things.
Aye.
I once sailed with a geezer who lost both of his arms and part of his eye.
What'd you call him?
Larry.
I do not renege on a bargain once struck.
but we agreed on ends only.
the means are mine to decide.
caution, Barbossa.
do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead.
or what it mean if you fail me.
don't you forget why you had to bring me back.
why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate.
it took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso.
and it'll take no less than nine to set you free.
masters Pintel and Ragetti.
take this fishwife to the brig.
right this way, Mrs. Fish.
I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup.
apparently, you can.
I believe you know each other.
come to join my crew again, Master Turner?
not yours.
his.
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.
sparrow?
you didn't tell him.
we rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl.
what else have you not told me?
there is an issue far more troublesome.
I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso.
not a person.
a heathen god.
one who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash.
the world is well rid of her. Not quite so well, actually.
the Brethren Court intends to release her.
No! They cannot!
the First Court promised to imprison her forever.
that was our agreement. Your agreement?
I showed them how to bind her.
she could not be trusted.
I... She gave me no choice.
we must act before they release her.
you loved her.
she's the one.
and then you betrayed her.
she pretended to love me.
she betrayed me.
and after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder.
do not test me.
I hadn't finished that.
you will free my father.
and you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety.
along with my own.
your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.
we will expect fair value in return.
there is only one price I will accept:
calypso murdered.
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.
Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.
and with you no longer aboard her, how do you propose to lead us there?
what is it you want most?
look at them all.
there's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime.
and I owe them all money.
as he who issued summons,
I convene this, the Fourth Brethren Court.
to confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow cap'ns.
those aren't pieces of eight. They're just pieces of junk.
Aye. The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.
but when the First Court met, the Brethren were to a one skint broke.
so change the name.
to nine pieces of whatever we happened to have in our pockets at the time?
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.
master Ragetti, if you will.
I kept it safe, just like you said when you gave it to me.
aye, you have. But now I need it back.
sparrow
might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us.
sao Feng is dead.
he fell to the Flying Dutchman.
the plagued ship.
he made you captain? They're giving the bloody title away now.
listen. Listen to me.
our location has been betrayed.
jones is under the command of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.
who is this betrayer? Not likely anyone among us.
Where's Will? Not among us.
it matters not how they found us. The question is, what will we do now that they have?
we fight.
shipwreck Cove is a fortress.
a well-supplied fortress.
there is no need to fight if they cannot get to us.
there be a third course.
in another age, at this very spot, the First Brethren Court captured the sea goddess and bound her in her bones.
that was a mistake.
Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye.
but opened the door to Beckett and his ilk.
better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat of a man's brow and the strength of his back alone.
you all know this to be true.
gentlemen.
ladies.
we must free Calypso.
shoot him. Cut out his tongue!
shoot him, cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.
sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.
calypso was our enemy then, she will be our enemy now.
it's unlikely her mood's improved.
I would still agree with Sao Feng. We release Calypso.
you threaten me? I silence you.
this is madness. This is politics.
meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us.
if they not be here already.
my sweet.
you come for me.
you were expecting me. It has been torture.
trapped in this single form.
cut off from the sea.
from all that I love.
from you.
ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me.
ten years I looked after those who died at sea.
and, finally, when we could be together again...
...you weren't there.
why weren't you there?
it's my nature.
would you love me if I was anything but what I am?
I do not love you.
many things you were, Davy Jones.
but never cruel.
you have corrupted your purpose...
...and so your self.
and you did hide away what should always have been mine.
Calypso.
I will be free.
and when I am, I would give you my heart.
and we would be together always.
if only you had a heart to give.
why did you come?
and what fate have you planned for your captors?
the Brethren Court?
all of them, the last thing they will learn in this life...
...is how cruel I can be.
and what of your fate, Davy Jones?
my heart will always belong to you.
it was the First Court what imprisoned Calypso.
we should be the ones to set her free.
and in her gratitude, she will see fit to grant us boons.
whose boons? Your boons?
utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.
if you have a better alternative, please, share.
cuttlefish.
Aye.
let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.
flipping glorious little sausages.
pen them up together, they'll devour each other without a second thought.
human nature, isn't it?
or... Or fish nature.
so, yes, we could hole up here well-provisioned and well-armed.
half of us would be dead within the month.
which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it. Or...
uh...
as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful.
I rather doubt it.
can we pretend she's anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.
we are left with but one option.
I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of me mouth...
...Captain Swann. We must fight.
you've always run away from a fight. Have not.
have so. Have not.
have so. Have not!
you have so, and you know it. Have not. Slander and calumny.
I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
I submit that here now that is what we all must do:
we must fight to run away.
Aye! Aye!
as per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king.
you made that up. Did I, now?
I call on Cap'n Teague, keeper of the code.
sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly!
hang the code. Who cares a...?
code is the law.
you're in my way, boy.
the code. The code.
as set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.
that can't... How did... Sea turtles, mate.
sea turtles.
Ah. Barbossa is right.
hang on a minute.
it shall be the duties, as the king, to declare war, parley with shared adversaries...
fancy that.
there has not been a king since the First Court.
and that's not likely to change.
not likely. Why not?
see, the pirate king is elected by popular vote.
and each pirate only ever votes for hisself.
I call for a vote.
I vote for Ammand the corsair.
Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman.
sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee.
mistress Ching.
gentleman Jocard.
Elizabeth Swann Barbossa
Vallenueva
Elizabeth Swann
what? I know. Curious, isn't it?
vote for me. Vote for me.
what you talking about?
No!
am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then?
very well.
what say you, Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court?
prepare every vessel that floats.
at dawn...
...we're at war.
and so we shall go to war.
what?
you've seen it all, done it all. You survived.
that's the trick, isn't it? To survive?
it's not just about living forever, Jackie.
the trick is living with yourself forever.
how's Mum?
she looks great.
the enemy is here! Let's take them!
abandon ship. Abandon ship.
parley?
you be the cur that led these wolves to our door.
don't blame Turner. He was merely the tool of your betrayal.
if you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left.
my hands are clean in this.
figuratively.
my actions were my own and to my own purpose.
Jack had nothing to do with it. Well spoke. Listen to the tool.
will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.
I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost.
no cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it.
if Turner wasn't acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this?
you made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates. And here they are.
don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward.
your debt to me is still to be satisfied.
one hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman. As a start.
that debt was paid, mate. With some help.
you escaped. Technically.
I propose an exchange.
will leaves with us...
...and you can take Jack.
done.
undone. Done.
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right.
king.
as you command, your nibs. Blackguard!
if ye have something to say, I might be saying something as well.
first to the finish, then?
do you fear death?
you've no idea.
advise your Brethren, you can fight, and all of you will die.
or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.
you murdered my father.
he chose his own fate.
and you have chosen yours.
we will fight.
and you will die.
so be it.
king?
of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack.
maybe he really does know what he's doing.
Bravo!
you've successfully arrived aboard the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.
look Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.
except for this sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork.
go away.
what, back to the Locker? Not without you, Jackie.
stab the heart.
live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman.
then again...
...if you're in the brig...
...who's to stab the heart?
does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach.
peanut.
we'll need to use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack.
Oh, will we now? All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.
Barbossa, you can't release her.
we need to give Jack a chance.
apologies, Your Majesty. Too long my fate has not been in me own hands.
no longer.
the enemy has opted for oblivion.
ready the fleet.
to your stations. To your stations.
be there some manner of rite or incantation?
Aye.
the items brought together, done.
items to be burned...
...and someone must speak the words:
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds.
is that it?
tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover.
Ooh!
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds!
is that it? No, no, no. He didn't say it right.
he didn't...
you have to say it right.
Calypso...
...I release you from your human bonds.
tia Dalma
Calypso.
when the Brethren Court imprisoned you, who was it that told them how?
who was it that betrayed you? Name him.
Davy Jones
this is it! This is it!
Calypso!
I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite.
I have fulfilled me vow and now ask your favor.
spare meself, me ship, me crew...
...but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters...
...or mine.
is that it?
why, she's no help at all.
what now?
nothing.
our final hope has failed us.
it's not over. There's still a fight to be had.
we've an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there's no chance.
there's only a fool's chance.
revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for.
you're right.
then what shall we die for?
you will listen to me.
listen!
the Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.
and what will they see?
frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No.
no, they will see free men and freedom!
and what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons.
they will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do.
by the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs...
...and the courage of our hearts.
gentlemen...
...hoist the colors.
hoist the colors.
hoist the colors. Hoist the colors!
Aye.
the wind's on our side, boys. That's all we need!
hoist the colors!
we have a favorable wind, sir.
Oh, so we do.
signal Jones to give no quarter.
that should brighten his day.
to arms! We give no quarter!
Calypso.
have you noticed, on top of everything, it's raining?
that's a bad sign.
man the capstan. Raise the main topyard. Keep that powder dry.
Maelstrom!
captain Barbossa!
we need you at the helm.
aye, that be true.
brace up yards, you cack-handed deck apes.
dying is the day worth living for.
veer off!
she'll not harm us.
full-bore and into the abyss.
are you mad?
ha! You afraid to get wet?
she's on our stern and gaining.
more speed! Haul your wind and hold your water.
bow cannons!
blow the cannons!
take us out or they'll overbear us.
nay. Further in. We'll cut across to faster waters.
prepare to broadside.
captain the guns. Bear a hand.
muster your courage, men. At the ready.

Half-barrel hinges.

wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.
I miss him already. He is quite charming, isn't he?
nobody move.
I dropped me brain.
batten down the hatches!

midship cannoneers, sight the masts.
main battery at the ready!
hold there! Wait till we're board-and-board.
fire!
fire! Fire! Fire all!
fire!
fire!
come on, men.
it be too late to alter course now, mateys.
halt there or we'll shoot.
good one.
I just come to get me effects.
admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere?
someone has to stay and guard the chest.
there's no question, there's a breakdown in military discipline on this vessel.
I blame the fish people.
Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people?
seems contributory, is all I'm suggesting.
it's true, if there were no fish people, there'd be no need to guard the chest.
and if there were no chest we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.
prepare to board!
cover!
No!
lookee here, boys. A lost bird.
a lost bird that never learned to fly.
to my great regret.
but...
...never too late to learn, eh?
Whoa!
the chest, hand it over.
I can set you free, mate.
my freedom was forfeit Iong ago.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth...
will you marry me?
I don't think now's the best time.
now may be the only time.
I love you.
I've made my choice. What's yours?
Barbossa. Barbossa
marry us.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
Barbossa, now.
fine, then.
dearly beloved, we be gathered here today...
to nail your gizzards to the mast, you poxy cur.
Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband? Elizabeth Swann...
I do. Great.
will Turner, do you take me...
...to be your wife...
...in sickness and in health...
...with health being the less likely?
I do.
as captain, I now pronounce you...
you may kiss...
you may kiss...
just kiss.
leave it.
you can do nothing without the key.
I already have the key.
no, you don't.
Oh, that key.
No!
oi. My pistol.
Turner. Turner
fire!
thank you, Jack.
stop! It's me.
it's Will. Your son.
ha!
go!
harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.
that's why I brought this.
I'm not going to kill you. I made you a promise.
missed.
did you forget? I'm a heartless wretch.
Ah. Love.
a dreadful bond.
and yet, so easily severed.
tell me, William Turner, do you fear death?
do you?
heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand.
you're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.
cruel is a matter of perspective.
is it?
will?
look at me! Stay with me! You're all right.
William?
my son.
will? Will? Look at me. Look at me!
you will not forestall my judgment.
Calypso.
she's taking us down! Make quick or it's the Locker for us all!
no.
no, no.
No!
part of the crew. Part of the ship, part of the crew.
part of the ship, part of the crew.
don't leave me.
don't. No!
I won't leave you.
the Dutchman must have a captain.
hold on.
thank goodness, Jack.
the armada's still out there. The Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard, and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
never actually been one for tradition.
close haul her. Luff the sails and lay her in irons.
belay that, or we'll be a sitting duck.
belay that.
but the arma... Belay.
the Endeav... Stow. Shut it.
what are they waiting for?
he expects us to honor our agreement.
ready guns and gun ports.
it's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business.
Ah, she survived.
ready on the guns. Guns ready.
full canvas.
aye, full canvas.
orders, sir.
sir!
captain.
fire. Fire!
fire! Fire!
fire, all!
orders? Orders, sir?
sir, what do you command?
it's just good business.
abandon ship!
abandon ship! All hands, abandon ship!
they're turning away!
captain Turner!
Mr. Gibbs. Captain?
you may throw my hat if you like. Aye, aye, captain.
Hooray!
now go and get it.
orders, sir?
you're no longer bound to the Dutchman. You're free.
Aye.
that's a fine thing, but...
...By my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid.
if you'll have me.
on the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.
aye, Captain Turner.
this ship has a purpose again.
and where we are bound she cannot come.
one day ashore.
ten years at sea.
that's a steep price for what's been done.
depends on the one day.
your chariot awaits, Your Highness.
the oars are inside.
Mrs. Turner.
goodbye, poppet.
Jack.
it would never have worked out between us.
keep telling yourself that, darling.
once was quite enough.
thank you.
I'm going to need the other one.
it's nearly sunset.
it's always belonged to you.
will you keep it safe?
Yes.
Yes.
will!
keep a weather eye on the horizon.
granted it tends to list to port, and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women.
but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
is that it?
the Black Pearl?
it's not very big.
love, that is a dinghy.
my vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and...
...gone. Why is it gone?
is that it there?
Yes, there it is.
why is it there?
it's much larger up close.
Jack, you promised to take us for a ride.
I was to be given the first ride. What? You?
not what he said. I never!
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason why my ship is gone?
the ship? We're on the ship.
Jack! The ship's gone!
Really?
ladies! Will you please shut it?
listen to me. Yes, I lied to you.
no, I don't love you.
of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels.
it is pronounced "egregious.
by the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies.
and all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy?
take what you can. Give nothing back.
tell me, ladies, what do you know of sea turtles?
sea turtles?
let me tell you the amazing story of Cap...
all men up the ratlines.
all men up the ratlines!
Oh, you want a taste of this?
Oh, that's a good boy! You're Daddy's boy.
Oh, yes, you are.
sir?
some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind. Again.
again. Is that so?
it would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about.
on the charts. Aye.
with our own eyes.
to help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak.
Ah.
feast your eyes upon this, mateys.
there's more than one way to live forever.
gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth.

what the hell, man?
I shot her point blank. There's no way I could've missed her.
I told you. The only way to stop them is to shoot them in the head.
it's their only vulnerable spot.
don't forget it otherwise you'll waste time and ammunition.
and that can prove to be fatal.
let's go.
those were gunshots. - They sent help.
we're gonna get out of here.
you should thank me.
if you hadn't told them I was here, they would've ignored your call.
you might want to stick your ego up your ass, considering your own secretary left you here to die.
what was that?
someone who isn't infected.
we have to help.
it's too late. theTre's nothing we can do.
that's right. I mean if you go, then I leave too.
no, Claire. Don't go.
when my father left, he said the same thing.
he said he was going to go help my mother, but he didn't come back and neither did she.
and if you leave, you won't come back either.
it's okay.
I am gonna come back.
I promise. - Really?
by the way, do we have anything here that can be used as a weapon?
never saw this coming.
is there anyone there?
no answer. Never a good sign.
get down.
Leon.
what are you doing here? - I could ask you the same thing.
you're the one?
is this it?
Yup. - Reinforcements?
none. We're getting out alone.
is it too much to hope you at least have some sort of a plan?
we're gonna run across the lobby. - Are you insane?
the lobby is crawling with those creatures.
it's also the widest area.
it's too dangerous to take the long way around.
he's right.
they aren't fast. We can get by them.
Oh, yeah?
and since when did the NGO member become such an authority on the subject?
she's one of the rare survivors of Raccoon city.
she has more experience with this kind of hellish nightmare than anyone else here.
Hey, Raccoon city, isn't that where the...?
Yes.

keep up with me, Rani.

he damn well got bit.
stay back.
go on without me.
Greg. Wait. - Greg.
you got this?
Greg.
Greg. no.
Greg.
Greg!
you okay?
do I look like I'm okay?
are we going to make it out of here?
we have a clear view and a straight path to the exit.
we'll take out as many as we can and run like hell.
Angela, back me up.
got it.
can't you get rid of them any faster?
they're starting to gather over here.
we're not gonna make it out, are we?
it's getting tough.
we gotta go.
Rani.
Claire.
you all right?
barely.
rani, are you okay? - Claire.
let's go.
thank you.
Where's the senator?
finally.
I'm over here.
the light. Run towards the light.
get that perimeter set up. Move.
don't stand there, man. Set it up.
move in. Move in. Open fire.
light them up, boys. Light them up. - Get a move on.
move move.
Rani!
Rani.
aunt.
aunt. - Oh my god. You're all right.
I was so scared.
aunt.
aunt.
they were everywhere.
I didn't think I would see you again. - I can't stand kids.
they're a real pain in the ass.
Oh, my poor darling.
bastard.
that girl will have nightmares for the rest of her life because of you.
let me go. Give her to me. Please.
I got it. I got it.
Claire.
you okay?
Oh, honey, I know. But she's fine, really.
we just have to wait.
no problem.
I'll take care of it.
we can use that in the worst-case scenario.
I have no intention of letting Wilpharma end up looking like a savior.
Hey, Hunnigan. I'm reporting in.
I already heard.
the marines landed in the nick of time and saved the day.
I can't tell you how relieved I am.
I'm amazed and impressed you got authorization for that.
you must have pulled a few strings. - Yes. well I have my resources.
after I received confirmation from usamriid that the virus used in this attack was indeed the T-virus...
I submitted a plan to the President.
he pushed it through as a special emergency act.
every marine involved in the assault was vaccinated.
have the terrorists made demands? - No, not yet.
but the FBI captured a member of general Grande's army in Los Angeles just moments ago.
when we interrogate him, he might give us some information that'll establish a link between this terrorist attack and the one in india.
maybe we'll dig up a lead on the where abouts of former umbrella corporation employees.
they've gotta be the ones peddling the virus on the black market.
what the hell is going on?
why are Wilpharma drugs being brought here?
it's the vaccine.
you. What are you doing here?
he's Wilpharma's head researcher.
may I introduce Frederic Downing.
he's the one who developed a vaccine for the virus which you in particular are so familiar with.
you mean the infection in the terminal?
you thought that was Wilpharma-engineered, didn't you?
utterly ridiculous.
an inoculation.
that's what they've been working on. A way to prevent further outbreaks.
but... - Claire it's true.
you knew? - Yes.
I didn't think its use would be sanctioned this quickly.
then the human testing that took place in India...
an attack by terrorists that somehow got hold of the T-virus.
all the members of the group supported by General Grande were infected, so we don't know the details.
the U. S. government obtained permission from Indian authorities to administer the T-virus vaccine to the nearby communities.
a vaccine secretly developed by Wilpharma.
it was a success.
the infection rate was kept as minimal as possible.
why the hell didn't you break out the vaccine for this?
if we'd been inoculated before we entered the terminal, Greg would...
inoculation would have been entirely possible...
...had Terra-save not backed us into an adversarial corner.
had we been able to follow proper procedure as outlined in the original schedule? The government medical stockpile...
...could have been shipped anywhere in the U. S. within 12 hours.
Oh, my god. Then it's all our fault.
I wouldn't argue with you there.
we just ended up making things worse.
that's not true.
the villains here are the ones who used the virus.
but worse than them are the ones who made it.
seven years ago, our lives were changed forever by the virus from Umbrella Corp.
umbrella collapsed but their viral legacy continues to spread.
I'm gonna scrub this virus from the face of the earth.
you chose the role of rescuer rather than fighter like me.
you chose a path that your brother and I couldn't follow.
you weren't wrong.
leon, thank you.
hurry.
find some extinguishers.
clear the area before the gas tanks blow.
let's go. let's go.
Where's the rest of the team? Come on.
how do I use this thing? - Help.
somebody help. I'm stuck.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
hurry up. Come on.
what happened? - The trucks carrying the vaccine...
how much vaccine is left?
everything we brought today was all we were able to scrape together from vaccine samples inside the company.
and most of that has just been lost.
Where's the manufacturing data?
you think they're after the data too? - Could it be?
why don't you tell us what their demands are already?
if you don't wanna talk, I'll just go directly to the President.
the truth.
truth?
they demand the truth.
the viral weapon from which Umbrella Corporation's T-virus was derived.
they wanna reveal everyone from the U. S. government who was involved.
was the government really involved?
the proof went up in smoke with Raccoon city.
wait a minute. The truth didn't disappear.
there never was any. - Convince the terrorists of that.
if they don't get that information, what will happen?
they'll disperse the T-virus in every populated area in the U.S.
the deadline is midnight.
that's only four hours from now.
and there's no vaccine left.
can we find out who the terrorists are?
I have a clue as to the identity of one of them.
right after the first infected victims appeared in the airport terminal, I noticed a man in the lobby. His name is Curtis Miller.
I know him. He's one of those bleeding hearts protesting the construction of the new research facility.
if the terrorists' demands are the release of information on what really happened in raccoon city...
...then he might... - It can't be.
Curtis Miller is my older brother.
my brother wouldn't do something like this.
he was arrested for threatening Wilpharma.
he just demanded information be made public.
unfortunately, the rest of the world doesn't see it that way.
if you claim he's not a terrorist.
why don't you bring him here to explain himself? Now.
you're sure packing a lot of hardware？
just to go see your brother.
where are you going?
I'm going to the office and check on the development data.
can I help you with something? Don't worry.
I'm not scheming to infiltrate your organization for my own devious purposes.
I'm afraid there's only one thing you can do.
join me for a late afternoon tea.
there you are. Comfortable?
it'll be nice to have some company.
this is the road to Curtis' home.
I haven't heard a word from Curtis in three years.
he lost his wife and child in the Raccoon city tragedy.
that's odd. It won't accept my card.
has that happened before? - No. This is the first time.
I'll have to use the master code.
we're entering an air dome.
the roof is supported by creating a difference between the exterior and interior air pressure.
the danger levels in this facility are assigned according to the microbes that are handled in each section.
from the right, the levels ascend from 1 to 4.
the higher the number, the higher the danger level.
rest assured however, that there are stringent safety measures in place in the unlikely event a problem occurs.
if anything positive rose from the ashes of Raccoon city,
it's that security and safeguard standards have been elevated.
in order to avert any future calamities.
what about this zero area?
that contains researchers' offices.
meeting rooms and the like.
that's where we're headed next.
this isn't paradise.
this is what you came to assist me with.
thank you.
smells delicious.
what are you doing? - Checking on the development data.
Yes, senator. - I figured you must be there by now.
what do you want?
why did you bring that woman there?
you're not feeling sorry for her, are you?
that's not like you.
don't you understand? This is our chance.
Yes, I know.
Yes.
Yes.
what did he say?
nothing of any consequence. I assure you.
he said something to you, didn't he?
he warned me not to let you see anything.
would it cause trouble if I saw something in particular?
no.
when I started out as a rookie cop.
I responded to a call about a small child that was stranded on a sandbank in the middle of a flooding river.
I impulsively jumped into the river.
the next thing I knew...
I was waking up in a hospital bed bleary and disoriented.
they informed me afterward that I had saved the child.
but three S. R.T. members were injured while fishing my sorry but out of the water.
talk about depressed. I felt lower than dirt.
what was I thinking putting others in harm's way like that?
not to mention that I could've been killed too.
but then Curtis said something that made me stop beating myself up.
if you don't try to save one life.
you'll never save any.
in the end.
his own words came back to haunt him.
let me through. Let me through.
there is something, but Davis wants it to remain hidden.
this is the G-virus.
you have that here?
it remains a secret even within the company.
the government affiliates don't know about it either.
it was obtained through special means.
a group with which neither we nor someone in the senator's position can be associated.
you got it on the black market.
what did you plan on doing with the G-virus?
create a vaccine. But even the senator couldn't adequately express the threat posed to the government.
the plans were shelved and it remains in level 4 ever since.
the senator is a member of the committee that decided to bomb Raccoon city.
I've gotta tell Leon.
wait, no. I...
if you do that, what's going to happen to me?
you didn't seem worried about that when you were telling me everything.
looks like... looks like
there's something wrong with the server.
I'm going to stop Curtis.
Claire. What's wrong?
leon, get over here to Wilpharma right now.
they've got the G-virus.
they were gonna make a vaccine like for the T-virus, but Davis just called Frederic and told him to get rid of it.
is Frederic there? - He just went to go fix the server.
or he may have gone to dump the virus.
couldn't be. - Claire?
there's a call coming from inside the building.
hold on.
Claire? - Frederic? Where are you?
in level 4. - Why?
you were going to the server room.
I saw someone suspicious on my way and followed him.
you need to get out. There's a time bomb.
it's too late to stop it.
we'll have another biohazard if this thing...
Claire? Claire!
damn it. - What's wrong?
I don't know. We got cut off.
attention all personnel. A system error has occurred.

looks like sections are blocked.
let's split up. We can meet up again in the inner garden.
ready? - Ready.
Angela.
you're not alone.
we're together in this.
I know.
Leon.
what happened? Where's Frederic?
he was telling me about a time bomb he found in level 4 when...
a nasty wound. We gotta get out.
I'm all right. Listen to me.
Curtis was here. I saw him.
he came out of level 4 where the G-virus was kept.
Curtis.
Angela.
you're hurt.
you need medical attention.
why, Curtis? - I couldn't forgive them for covering up the Raccoon city atrocity.
I refused to let the government rewrite the truth as they saw fit.
so when I finally learned the truth, I swore...
I swore I'd make them reveal it no matter what it took.
Curtis.
but he also told me that I couldn't make things any worse.
even if it was deserved.
there was no chance of me...
of me causing a recurrence of that horror here in the town where I was born and raised.
that's why he left me.
that's why he blew up this place.
wait.
nothing can stop it now.
in a moment...
...I'll reveal the irrefutable truth in my own personal way.
and all of you will be the very first witnesses!
go straight down this corridor. Head to elevator AD-2.
it'll take you to an outside exit.
got it.
Claire.
try not to get killed. - Okay, ditto.
move.
No!
stop.
cease fire. Cease fire.
the target became aggressive and resisted capture.
I deemed it necessary to open fire and issued the order.
the target was terminated.

somebody pull me up.
what is this?
anhydrous ethanol.
are we being sterilized?
not us, the building.
incineration will initiate in five minutes.
all exits are now sealed. - What the hell?
we're still in here.
get all survivors to the central rest area now.
move it.
come on.
all exits are now sealed.
Oh, shit.
come on.
we'll catch the next one. - Right.
we'll send it ...
go!
stop.
you'll ignite us all.
Oh, my god. - It's impossible.
he's still alive. - No no no!
no no no!

no. no.
I don't wanna hurt you.
please.
no.
all right, Curtis.
let's finish this.
level 0 submerge system will engage soon.
after the system verifies there's no more virus in here...
...the hole will close.
let me go.
let go of me, damn it or you'll fall too.
you can't die. You have to destroy these viruses.
please, Leon. Don't try to save me.
if you don't try to save one life, you'll never save any.
isn't that right, Curtis?
are you okay?
it recorded.
Where's Frederic?
dead. No vaccine data, no nothing.
the same as Raccoon city.
what?
frederic said it.
you couldn't convince countries to invest in the development of the insufficiently researched G-virus.
what are you talking about?
at first, I didn't suspect you were connected with this terrorism.
if for no other reason than you were in the airport when the event occurred.
but you had a motive for causing all this.
stocks.
Wilpharma stock tanked because of our accusations.
you were afraid that the situation would turn out the same as it did for Umbrella Corporation.
so you needed an excuse to use the vaccine.
now, wait a minute.
Yes, I'm a stockholder.
and Wilpharma should regain the public's faith after this incident.
but there's no way in hell I would support terrorism to ensure that.
first of all, what is the G-virus? I've never even heard of it.
I know you ordered Frederic to dispose of the g-virus when you called him.
I told him not to show you anything more than you needed to see. That was it.
I doubt he knows anything.
Leon.
general Grande's communication man talked.
it seems that all of us the senator included were fooled by him.
who are you talking about?
Frederic? where are you? - In level 4.
Why? You said you were going to the server room.
I saw someone suspicious on my way there and followed him.
you need to get out.
there's a time bomb here. It's too late to stop it.
we'll have another biohazard if this thing...
it can't be.
it's me.
what do you think?
Yes, under your request.
as of now General Grande...
...only you will be in possession of a set of the T-virus and the T-vaccine.
nothing would offer greater advantage when negotiating with a country that wants to keep the existence of this virus a secret.
you needn't worry.
I've anticipated everything down to the last detail...
...including my own escape arrangements.
don't forget you owe me extra money for the data on the G-virus.
and one last thing. As a friend...
...heed my advice and forget about G.
the stuff is wickedly volatile and it can't be controlled.
right on time.
you were supposed to come alone.
I just wanted to see your face one more time.
don't move.
I have the last of the vaccine and the development data.
this is all that remains in the entire world.
the rest is gone.
Yes, that's right.
you two can appreciate the situation better than anyone after your up-close-and-personal experiences with virus victims.
mankind will need this.
wait. Please. Don't shoot me. Let's talk.
you're a smart woman and smart women like money.
I can make you rich. We'll split everything 50-50.
I meant 70-30. I'm happy with 30.
please. Please take it all.
don't... don't kill me. I'm begging you. Please no.
you're too pathetic to kill.
all units, move in. - Yes, sir.
suspect has been apprehended and is in custody.
frederic confessed everything.
he was also the one that provided the T-virus to the terrorists in India.
he even acted as the black-market broker.
he stole the T- and G-viruses then escaped right before the Raccoon city disaster.
but Frederic decided he could only sell them as a set with a vaccine.
so he erased his past found employment at Wilpharma...
...and gained unrestricted access to their research facilities.
he had the luxury of searching for potential customers while manufacturing the vaccine.
this is how he stumbled upon General Grande.
the terrorist incidents were demonstrations staged for General Grande's benefit.
sort of a twisted sales pitch.
and my brother was just a tool to them.
he was used.
this doesn't absolve Curtis of what he did.
but we share something in common with him...
and that's his passionate desire to prevent any further tragedies like Raccoon city.
I gotta go.
all right.
catch you later.
Leon.
let's go diving together again sometime.
love to.
when did you two go diving?
don't worry about that.
more importantly, what are you up to?
need a lift?
I have a limousine waiting.
Claire.
next time we bump into each other...
let's hope it's some place a little more normal.
definitely.
until next time.
senator Ron Davis announced his resignation...
after being accused of insider trading with Wilpharma stock, a company of which he is a major stockholder.
next in international news.
general Miguel Grande has suddenly decided to participate in a central asian disarmament conference.
but the real motivation behind his participation is not yet known.
government sources seem to be optimistic about the turnaround...
... and say that it is to alleviate economic blockades...
... while rumors state that it is because...
... his ability to produce biological weapons has been removed.
take a sample of her blood...
...and then get rid of that. - Yes, sir.
the Umbrella Corporation thought they'd contained the infection.
well, they were wrong.
raccoon City was just the beginning.
within weeks, the T-virus had consumed the United States.
within months, the world.
the virus didn't just wipe out human life.
lakes and rivers dried up, forests became deserts...
...and whole continents were reduced to...
...nothing more than barren wastelands.
slowly but surely, the Earth began to wither and die.
what few survivors there were learned to keep on the move.
we avoided major cities.
if we stopped anyplace too long, they would be drawn to us.
only a few at first, but then more and more.
a never-ending army of undead.
for those of us left...
...staying on the road...
...seemed the only way to stay alive.
this is KLKB. We have seven people here...
...in need of urgent medical attention.
we need help. This is KLKB. Can anyone hear us?
can anyone help us? Please?
my baby.
please.
please help my baby.
you bitch.
you dropped my baby.
we're surrounded. We need help. Can anyone hear us?
can anyone help us? Please." - Works every time, Mama.
let's see...
...what else she's packing. - Yeah.
what you got down there, fishy?
I wouldn't do that.
shut your mouth!
relax! - Just show the bitch.
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Jesus Christ! He's dead!
think you're pretty smart, huh?
well, you'll see.
there you go, bitch. I wouldn't want it to be over too fast!
open the cage!
let them loose.
get up now!
that was a juicy one, huh?
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.
you got any smokes? - No.
like I'm supposed to believe that.
Claire, would I lie to you?
l. j. - L. J. - L. J. - Claire Redfield, how can I help you?
got any smokes? - No can do.
how about alternate?
sorry to say we're out of that too.
you gotta be shitting me. Otto?
sorry, campers. Smoked the last of it back in Salt Lake.
damn.
Yeah, people... - Damn it.
...it really is the end of the world.
anyone else? - Paris facility.
food supplies down to 50 percent.
six casualties. Biohazard numbers increasing.
london facility.
food supplies down to 28 percent. Seventeen casualties.
biohazard numbers increasing.
gentlemen.
Dr. Isaacs.
how good of the science division to join us.
chairman Wesker. I've been busy.
on the subject of the biohazard, what is the science division's report?
well, we now know conclusively that they have no real need for sustenance.
they hunger for flesh but do not require it.
my research indicates they could remain active for decades.
we're to be trapped underground for decades?
what news of Project Alice?
using antibodies from her blood...
...I will develop a serum that will not just combat the effects of the T-virus...
...but potentially reverse it...
...giving back these creatures a measure of their intelligence...
...their memories, thus curbing their hunger for flesh.
you're confident you can domesticate them?
they're animals, essentially.
we can train them, if we can take away their baser instincts.
they'll never be human...
...but would provide the basis for a docile workforce.
we can return to the surface.
after months of experiments, you have nothing to show.
we are left to rot underground. - Without the original Project Alice...
...progress has been difficult.
I've been forced to replicate her using cloned genetic models.
it's laborious. The results, unpredictable.
project Alice and the subject of domestication is of the highest priority.
you will concentrate on this to the exclusion of all other research.
we expect an updated report in a week.
simply demanding results will not guarantee them.
then perhaps we should place someone else in charge.
someone who can give us the reassurances we require.
continue with your research, doctor...
...while it still is your research.
this meeting is adjourned.
sorry about this, Stevie.
this is Claire Redfield's convoy, broadcasting for any survivors.
is anybody out there?
broadcasting for any survivors. Is anybody out there?
this is Claire Redfield's convoy, broadcasting for any survivors.
is anybody out there?
this is Claire Redfield's convoy. Location, the Desert Trail Motel.
broadcasting for any survivors. Is there anybody in there?
broadcasting for any survivors. Is there anybody in there?
keep trying, Mikey.
is there anyone alive in there?
please respond.
seems quiet. - Yeah, don't they always?
is there anyone alive in there? Please respond.
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in?
it's your call, boys.
come on. Let's go. - Let's do it.
I'm gonna get me a room.
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi...
...and I'm gonna rent me a porno.
what happened? You two okay?
Yeah. It's all clear.
somebody need my help?
it's nothing. But if you insist...
that's right. So sit back and relax.
spread out. Look for anything of use. Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.
you like playing rough, huh?
Oh, I've had worse. - I'm sure.
but you've always been gentle with me, Betty.
Oh, God. I'm leaving.
so, what do we say, dinner at my place tonight?
Oh, I'm there.
Hey, Betty! Over here!
this is amazing. He knows what it is.
camera.
you try.
stand your ground.
my God. - Unbelievable.
he has memory and reasoning skills.
this is incredible. The serum works. You've domesticated them.
you've done it. Congratulations.
no, doctor! Please. No!
no, no, doctor. Please, no!
pork and beans. I'll get some peaches for the little one there.
there you go.
it's asparagus. - Thanks.
for you...
...cat food.
just kidding. It's pork and beans.
Hey. - What's this, huh?
soup. Cream of mushroom. - Bullshit.
I think that's pork and beans too. - Thanks, man.
I'll be damned. - Asparagus.
how do you do that? - Just one of my skills.
it's a dying art, unfortunately.
this is the last of it.
I think it's some kind of fruit. - Thanks, Otto.
sorry, that's all we have.
fruit. You want some fruit? Fruit. You want some fruit?
did you check out the gas station? - Yep, it's bone-dry.
well, how we looking here?
well, Claire, if we can run these trucks on rust...
...we're looking pretty good.
all right.
Hey, sweetheart.
perimeter up yet?
it's almost done.
Olivera - Who's out there? - Olivera.
Claire - Hey, Carlos. - Claire.
all that smoking is slowing you down. Get your ass in gear, old man.
I want my perimeter up.
last sentinel in place.
perimeter's up and running. All motion sensors online.
cameras 100 percent.
refried beans. Fruit salad.
Oh, my favorite.
storm's coming!
let's start packing it up and move it inside.
come on, kids, let's go! - Hurry up!
get back in the bus. Put this fire out.
this is Claire Redfield's convoy. Location, the Desert Trail Motel.
lat. 35, long. 114. Calling any survivors.
this is Claire Redfield's convoy. Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

activate Number 87.
shit.
Dr. Isaacs. - What is it?
my sensors have detected a peak in psionic activity.
both alpha and beta wave.
from Number 87?
no, the activity's not from one of the clones.
it occurred outside the complex.
that's not possible. - My sensors were quite clear.
massive psionic activity was detected 15 minutes ago...
...centered on a desert location.
Claire - Claire! - What?
what the hell?
Oh, God.
Carlos - Carlos. - I see them.
everybody stay in your trucks.
what's going on?
everyone just stay in your trucks.
roll up the windows and keep quiet.
okay, close the windows up.
what's wrong with their eyes?
they've been feeding on infected flesh.
fire it up. Let's get out of here. - That's a hell of an idea.
lock and load.
we're stuck! - Hell, no, let's get out of here.
let's head for the bus, come on.
come on! Go! Go!
come on, get in! Come on, come on, come on.
Claire Claire!
damn it.
Mikey Carlos Mikey, Carlos, we have to evac the bus.
you got it.
hold it!
come on, move! - Keep moving!
come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!
Betty - Betty! - Go! Just go!
get out of here, Betty! Go!
move! Move! Move! - Go!
Betty Betty - Betty! Betty! - L. J. hurry up!
come with me!
come on! Come on! Betty! Betty!
No!
Betty Betty!
go! Go! Go!
Dr. Isaacs.
another spike in alpha and beta waves detected.
forty-five percent probability that this is Project Alice.
triangulate. Find her location.
impressive.
if it is her, her development is extraordinary.
her powers would appear to have grown at a geometric rate...
...since her escape from the Detroit facility.
you've made 10 trips to the surface in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.
any trip to the surface, especially to gather specimens, puts my men at risk.
why do you need so many all of a sudden?
Isaacs Isaacs!
my research has intensified.
don't worry. They're perfectly secure.
you're supposed to be domesticating them.
sometimes aggression has its uses.
what could you possibly need these things for?
Dr. Isaacs.
specimen 87 has reached the final stage of the test grid.
perfect. Put her on the screen.
good girl.
is Chairman Wesker even aware of this?
he knows what he needs to know.
you've overstepped your mark.
my research will change the face of everything.
if you pick a side...
...be sure it's the right one.
Hi.
Hey.
this belong to you?
I gave it to you last night.
for luck.
thank you.
what's your name?
K-Mart K-Mart.
it's where they found me.
Claire and the other...
a few years back.
do you have another name?
never liked it.
everyone I knew was dead...
...so seemed like time for a change.
anyone want to say something?
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.
she's the one who put this convoy together.
thank you so much for your help.
Claire Claire!
excuse me. I have things I have to attend to.
in the last six months, she lost half of the convoy.
pretty soon there'll be more of us dead than alive.
Alice, what happened to you?
why did you leave after Detroit?
I didn't have a choice. They were using me.
what do you mean?
they were tracking me.
I couldn't be around you. Any of you.
I would've gotten you all killed. - That's why you disappeared?
broke into an Umbrella facility and hacked into their computers... ...downloaded the satellite trajectories...
...and stayed off the grid.
and after the world ended?
why stay out there alone?
it's just safer if I'm not around people.
why'd you come back?
Damn!
what time is it?
chase, what time is it?
well, Carlos, it is 12: 14. Why? You got somewhere you gotta be?
guess I'm just being paranoid.
welcome home.
got a minute?
Yeah.
everyone is grateful for you helping us out.
but how long am I gonna stay?
don't get me wrong.
we really are grateful.
they're all talking about what you did. And they're scared.
I don't blame them.
people have a habit of dying around me.
not just you.
you're positive it's her?
62% Sixty-two percent. Too great a chance to pass up.
if it is Project Alice, she's been evading the satellite grid for years.
I've re-routed the remaining satellites.
we can reacquire the subject. She'll be unaware of surveillance.
I can have a strike team ready within the hour.
no. We'll establish a positive identification first.
one hundred percent.
the group she's with include known associates.
the original Project Alice is vital to my research...
...to the whole process of domestication. Her blood... ...her genetic structure, is the key.
the longer she's out there, the greater chance we lose her.
I can't risk that. - That decision isn't yours to make.
take no action until this matter has been discussed by the committee...
...at the next scheduled meeting. And, doctor...
...that's an order.
these transmissions are the best indication of life we've seen in months.
Alaska? - We have to check it out.
we can't just ignore it.
any idea what kind of journey that would be?
Yeah. A long one. - And at the end of it, what?
you have no guarantee there's even anyone alive up there.
these transmissions say that... - They're dated six months ago.
how many radio broadcasts have we responded to?
how many times have we got there too late?
the transmissions say that there's no infection up there.
it's isolated.
safe.
this convoy trusts me with their lives.
these people don't need pipe dreams.
maybe that's exactly what they need.
look at them, Claire.
six months ago, there were 50 of us, then 40, now there's less than 30.
they're starting to give up.
they need some kind of hope.
we have a decision to make.
and it's too big, it's too important for me to make for you.
there's a chance there are survivors.
where?
in Alaska.
there is a chance...
...that the infection hasn't reached that far.
but we don't know for sure.
so we have a choice.
we stay as we are...
...or we try for Alaska.
for Alaska.
Alaska.
I hope you're right.
God.
the food's virtually gone and the truck's running on empty.
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it.
chase? - Shit, I don't even have empty.
I got enough for a hundred miles, tops.
if we're gonna make this trip, we'll need to resupply.
Yep.
these are our options.
the nearest, safest bet is right there.
no, it's empty. I tried that.
then, well, maybe...
we could try this... - Vegas.
it's the only place we're sure to find gas and supplies.
there's a reason for that. Vegas is too dangerous.
it's crawling with them sons of bitches.
we've drained every small town dry over the last six months.
we have to hit a big city.
she's right.
Vegas, it's our only bet.
we'll establish a positive identification.
one hundred percent.
take no action until this matter has been discussed by the committee.
doctor...
...that's an order.
the committee authorizes immediate action.
release of vehicles and personnel...
...under command of Dr. Isaacs.
that's an order.
Hey. You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
them pork and beans, they lethal. I don't see how you cowboys do it.
years of practice.
Oh, my God.
what happened to it?
the desert must have taken it back.
five years.
no one to keep the sand back.
it's empty.
no undead.
nothing.
those birds must have moved through the city block by block.
picked it clean.
I don't see any truck stops.
where are they?
there.
valet parking at the casino up ahead.
there's gas pumps in there.
now, how do you know that?
I dropped two G's back in the day here.
you lost $2000?
damn it.
spread them out!
we're gonna have to move it.
all right, Chase, I need a lookout!
up there.
great.
climb the Eiffel Tower with a high-powered rifle.
a few years ago, that would've caused a stir.
well, let the good times roll.
let's get this done.
get the hell out of here. Mikey, get the winch.
Carlos - Yeah. - Carlos.
wait.
get back!
Carlos, cover me! - Go!
move!
just get to the back and stay quiet. Go! Now! Go!
get down!
she really is magnificent.
when she's dead, make sure you move in fast.
I need a sample of her blood while it's still warm.
that won't be a problem.
satellite in position? - Yes, sir.
then shut her down.
Mikey Mikey!
Hey!
Mikey Mikey!
No!
No!
she's fighting the conditioning.
boost the control signal.
shit!
climb! Give me your hand!
run! Go!
go! Run!
let's go!
what is it?
satellite. Some kind of malfunction.
how long?
new feed coming online in 15 seconds.
online in three, two...
now.
where the hell is she going?
shut her down!
she's still coming!
now! - Oh, shit.
you son of a...
back to base!
the anti-virus! Get me the anti-virus!
why didn't you shoot?
because we're not driving to Alaska. I want that helicopter intact.
let's go look at the computer, see where that chopper's headed.
how is he? - Under house arrest...
...as you instructed. He's been quiet.
how much of this have you used?
her blood increased the creatures' power.
it also increased the strength of the infection.
I needed it.
you have no idea what this will do to you.
Oh, I have an idea.
you're out of control.
well, this ends here.
under executive order 1345, issued by Chairman Wesker...
...for gross misconduct in the field...
...I sentence you to summary liquidation.
liquidation?
just die.
take the body to the surface. Bring me the stats on Program Alice...
sir!
good thing we like a challenge.
hold on.
hold on.
they have the anti-virus in there.
just hold on.
it's too late, and you know it.
besides, you need a way to get in there.
and I have an idea.
you keep them safe, huh? - You got it.
come here.
Carlos, l...
save it.
you just promise me one thing.
when you get down there...
consider it done.
wish I had a smoke.
fuck!
I'll be damned.
l. J. you sneaky son of a bitch.
Oh, hell.
come on.
get the kids out quickly!
go!
run! Run! Hurry up! - Okay.
go! Go! Go!
take him!
you're not coming?
take care of the others.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
I am the artificial intelligence... - I know what you are.
I knew your sister.
she was a homicidal bitch.
my sister computer was merely following the most logical path...
...for the preservation of human life.
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.
so, what happened here?
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected state. He was bitten by a creature...
...that had been treated with a newly developed serum.
a serum derived from your blood.
the resulting infection has caused massive mutation.
my blood?
your blood has bonded with the T-virus.
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced... ...that it could be used to destroy the biohazard for good.
you mean my blood is the cure for all this?
correct.
so why are you helping me?
your blood is pure, and this facility contains...
...all of the equipment you will require to synthesize a cure.
you mean this could all end? - Correct.
there is, however...
...a small problem.
I have him contained in the lower levels...
...but I cannot hold him there for much longer.
all right, let's go.
Alice Alice?
good luck.
you can't kill me.
I've told you...
...I can't die.
no.
for so long, I thought you were the future.
I was wrong.
I am the future.
no.
you're just...
...another asshole.
and we're both gonna die down here.
Yeah, you're the future, all right.
all attempts to contact the North American facility continue to fail.
how long have they been off the air?
seventeen hours.
we must consider them lost. But our plans remain unchanged.
all data will be transferred to this facility...
...and the research will continue under my personal supervision.
I expect results within one month.
you won't have to wait that long, boys.
because I'm coming for you.
and...
...I'm gonna be bringing a few of my friends.
you're just...
...another asshole.
my name is Augusten Burroughs.
where do I begin to tell the story of how my mother left me, and then I left my mother?
maybe I should begin with the part about how she'd keep me home from school.
that's how close we were.
I was so crazy about her.
Oh, hello, Miss Mimm, this is Deirdre Burroughs calling.
Augusten won't be attending school today.
I over-conditioned my hair.
he over-conditioned his hair. - And the party.
and he has to help me with the dinner party.
thank you.
my mother was crazy about me too.
I've always known that.
I guess it doesn't matter where I begin, because nobody's gonna believe me anyway.
Augusten.
wake up. Wake up.
Augusten. Wake up.
I need you.
okay. Testing. Testing. Can you hear me?
"childhood is gone. What remains?"
"childhood is gone. And youth."
"and ties with people I have loved are broken now."
"my grief is more than I can easily contain."
"my grief builds this town anew "and raises all the dead to walk with me this day."
"what's left?"
"my future seems nefarious, "drained of mystery "known in my bones."
"most of all, what I will miss "is the extravagance of my entire future "stretched out before me like a highway in the desert."
"waves of heat rising up, wrinkling the air."
"I weep for what is gone."
"and I weep for myself."
okay, now I need your honest reaction. Did it feel powerful to you?
emotionally charged?
it really does seem like something you'd read in The New Yorker.
you really think so?
the New Yorker's very selective. They don't publish just anyone.
I really think they would publish this.
that thing with your paralyzed sister, that was great.
well, we'll see.
I just got a rejection letter from The Virginia Quarterly.
that worries me.
of course, if The New Yorker did accept this poem, your grandmother would see it.
I can't imagine what she would say.
but I can't let her reaction keep me from publishing.
Augusten, your mother was meant to be a very famous woman.
I have a reading. I have books to sign. I told you to be here at 4: 00. It's 4: 30.
I got stuck in traffic. - Bullshit. You're trying to sabotage me.
wanna play checkers, Dad?
not right now, son. My back is out, I've got papers to grade and I'm very tired.
so why don't you go outside and play with the dog for a little while?
but I'm sick of Cream. All she wants to do is sleep.
she's an old lady.
testing. One, two, three.
thank you for coming to my poetry reading tonight.
"childhood is gone. What remains?"
"childhood is gone. And youth."
"and ties with people I have loved are broken now."
"my grief is more than I can easily contain."
"what's left?"
"my future seems nefarious "drained of mystery "known in my bones."
thank you.
I don't understand.
I polish my allowance.
I boil it clean, then polish it with silver polish.
but why, Augusten? Why?
because I like shiny things.
I really don't see myself in you at all.
I'm more like my mom.
I wanna be special and I wanna be famous.
are you going to a funeral?
no. No, sweetie. It's a gown for public appearances. You wanna cut?
see, the plan is, I'm announced, at some place grand and serious like Carnegie Hall.
and I come out in this.
and I stand in front of a black velvet curtain.
I'm gonna demand that in my contract.
and that way, everything fades away, except my writing.
the mail came.
"and when the sun comes out "the daffodil looks skyward."
"wet from the rain "but not broken."
"triumphant trumpet."
"did you like it, Deirdre?"
I've been working on it since the last meeting of the poetry club.
you said, "Write what you know.
I love to garden so I thought I would write about dirt and the sun.
it's shit, Fern.
it's sentimental. It's emotionally dishonest.
it implodes into nothingness. I was bored.
were you bored, Christy?
it sort of didn't go anywhere.
you didn't tap into your creative unconscious, Fern.
honey.
I'm sorry, Deirdre.
I so wanted to have a creative outlet and I thought maybe this was it.
but you're right. It's terrible.
if Anne Sexton writes about flowers, Fern, the poem isn't about the goddamn flowers.
the flowers would wilt and rot.
she'd use metaphor to explore her dead marriage, her pain. You understand?
Sexton's therapist told her to write poetry as a way to exorcize her rage.
now, she's not a housewife. She's a rock 'n' roller. Okay?
last week in Boston, 2000 people waited in a fucking blizzard to hear her read.
that's power recovered. So that's what you need to do, Fern.
you need to recover by expressing your anger.
I am angry.
steve takes me for granted. - There it is again. Men.
I'm so sorry.
no, don't you dare apologize, Fern.
you funnel that rage into the only escape you have. Your art.
who wants to read next?
Christy, you're hiding.
I'm just not quite there.
get the rage on the page, women.
you infantile tyrant! - Jesus.
you'd like nothing more than to see me slit my wrists!
why don't you just settle down? You know, you are hysterical.
you're so goddamn hysterical!
I'm hysterical? You think this is hysterical? - Yes!
you poor bastard! You're so repressed that you...
you mistake creative passion for hysteria! Don't you see?
this is how you're killing me.
nobody is trying to kill you, Deirdre.
you're doing a perfectly good job of it yourself.
I wish you'd rot in hell. I regret the day I ever married you.
will you two stop fighting?
this is between me and your father! Your father is the one...
well, I live here too, you know!
look at you. Look at your damn face. You got the face of a man twice your age.
forty-five going on 90!
will you just shut up?
he's not moving!
no, he's just playing another one of his horribly manipulative games.
get up, Norman!
get up, Norman.
enough of your pranks.
please don't kill her.
he's not gonna kill me.
he'd rather suffocate me with his horribly oppressive manipulation and then wait for me to cut my own throat.
go to bed. Go to bed, Augusten.
you've got school in the morning.
I don't want to go to school.
you've got to go, Augusten!
you can't keep skipping or I'll get arrested.
why can't we just be a normal family?
Oh, thank God.
hello there.
please come in.
I've just been a frantic wreck waiting for you to get here.
it's okay now, Mrs. Burroughs.
Oh, no, please. Call me Deirdre.
Where's Norman, dear?
Oh, he's passed out drunk.
I see. - I was afraid for my life tonight.
I thought for sure he was gonna kill me, that this would finally be the night.
would you like a Sanka?
I'd like some slices of bologna with a side of horseradish.
do you mind, son?
don't you worry about your parents, buckaroo. We'll get this all sorted out.
good luck.
I just pray to God Norman doesn't snap.
one of these days he's gonna snap and kill us all.
enough!
that's not the way to talk around your son.
you need to comfort him, not frighten him.
that's right. I know.
I'm sorry, Augusten. I'm just very upset right now.
sit down, Deirdre.
good night, Augusten.
now.
I'm gonna ask you a number of questions if that's all right with you.
they may seem rather personal. In fact, you may not see the relevance.
but I believe that's up to me, as the doctor, to decide.
so, your anxiety level.
how would you describe it?
well, I'm just frantic.
I'm very, very upset. I'm very anxious.
I feel very emotionally charged.
and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.
tell me about your bowel movements.
have you noticed any changes either in regularity, or the shape and density of the bowel matter itself?
is that really...
I mean... Do we have to...
what I'm getting at is constipation. Both literal and subconscious.
are you constipated in your life, Deirdre?
stuck?
I am.
I am stuck.
I understand you write a lot. Are you energetic when you write? Frantic?
well...
when I write I'm writing from my unconscious. Or I'm trying to.
do you have sex with your husband?
Yes. - Do you enjoy it?
back to your anxiety for a moment.
you have thoughts of suicide, Deirdre?
do you have suicidal thoughts?
do you ever think of killing yourself?
and how often would you say you have these thoughts of suicide?
right after I have sex with my husband.
what are those?
valium.
to quiet the nerves.
is he an MD doctor?
Yes, and as I've told you 100 times, he got his MD at Yale.
and you heard about this guy from where?
Dr. Nupal.
Augusten's allergist.
if you were more of a man and involved in your son's life, you'd know who that was.
I smell manure.
I don't smell anything.
I do, I smell manure. It's coming out of your ears.
fucking bitch.
I'm unhappy.
I'm unhappy.
Norman, if you're so unhappy, why stay in this marriage?
I don't know why.
my son.
I don't think that's why you stay, Norman. I think you stay because it's comfortable.
it's what you know.
you were trapped in your childhood by a castrating mother, and as an adult male you have sought the same female archetype.
well, that's just brilliant. And very true.
Deirdre, smoking is a great privilege in my sanctuary.
but for you, I will allow it.
thank you.
so you're saying we should split up?
in order to reach that conclusion, Norman,
I would need to see both you and Deirdre on a regular and disciplined basis.
for five hours a day.
I'm available, Dr. Finch.
five hours a day? I can't do that. I have to work!
see, Dr. Finch, I told you. I'm married to a narcissist.
Norman, if I'm willing to clear my schedule to save your marriage but you're not, then get out.
leave this office, go home, and start dividing your books and your record albums.
this is bullshit.
this is really fucking bullshit.
what are you writing?
"Norman Burroughs is homicidal. He is an unapologetic alcoholic."
"he is dangerous, a threat to himself, his wife and his child."
finally, somebody sees.
Deirdre, express yourself. Let it out.
tell Augusten and I why you are crying.
cause I...
I did love Norman once, long ago, but I never should've married him.
so why did you?
he threatened to kill himself if I turned down his proposal. I'm not a murderer.
I've failed as a wife and a mother.
Yes, you have.
but Deirdre, you can't stay with a man who doesn't see your gift.
you are a brilliant, brilliant poet.
Augusten, have you any questions to ask me concerning the state of your parents' marriage?
I do have one question.
what's behind that door?
that?
that leads to an adjacent room where I masturbate.
Dr. Finch...
as evolved as I may indeed be, I'm still a human being, Deirdre.
a male human being.
I am still very much a man.
would you like a tour?
what is this, Hope?
Jesus Christ, Dad! You scared the shit out of me.
hope, you've no business being in here! This is my masturbatorium!
and you're using my blanket. - I was just taking a nap.
nap? This is not the place for naps!
go mind the telephone. Make fresh coffee.
do your job, like a responsible woman.
he's leaving.
now I can focus on my writing.
this is nice.
maybe I'll become a doctor.
it's just down here, on the right.
that's not it.
is it?
it can't be.
this is it, Augusten. This is Dr. Finch's house.
no doctor lives here.
Hello, Agnes.
Hello, Deirdre. Come in.
Oh, Freud.
well, you must be Augusten, isn't that right?
Yes, well, I'm Agnes. I'm Dr. Finch's wife.
well, make yourselves at home. I'll go get the doctor.
I'll wait in the car.
no, no, you will not wait in the car. It'll be hours and it's rude.
you just stay here. Get along with the Finch children.
up here, Deirdre.
Abigail, what are you doing here?
would you like to try some?
no.
Thanks.
why does everybody make such a fuss?
it's just a little kibble.
that stuff's not clean.
it's for dogs.
well, I guess you're afraid to try new things, Augusten.
sad.
isn't it a little early for Christmas?
you mean late.
it's been up for two years.
I just pooped.
Oh, way to go, kiddie-poo.
Hey.
I'm Natalie. The other daughter.
Augusten. - I know.
what's with the clothes, choir boy? Are you going to church?
I just pooped.
John Moses is the kid of one of my dad's patients.
we watch him sometimes.
come on, I'm supposed to keep you occupied.
what is it? - It's an electroshock therapy machine.
my dad used to use it on patients all the time.
until the police came.
come on, it'll be a wicked blast. Help me move it.
so why is Dr. Finch seeing patients in his house now?
well, you know how President Carter makes us drive 40 miles out of our way to buy gas?
because we're in...
an energy crisis?
right.
well, that means people don't have extra money for luxuries like mental health, so he's lost a lot of patients. He's downsizing.
are you ready?
for what?
are you retarded?
to play doctor.
okay. Well, I'll be the doctor and you can be the nurse.
I'm not gonna be some cunt-licking nurse.
I'll be my father and you be your mother.
okay.
how are we feeling today, Deirdre?
I'm blocked, Dr. Finch.
I can't tap into my subconscious.
I feel I do have a classic in me.
I feel I am owed a Pulitzer Prize, even though I've only published one book I paid for myself.
it's very clear to me now.
there's only one treatment available that could resurrect your creative spirit.
electroshock therapy. We'll start with 1000 volts.
is this gonna hurt?
well, maybe if you pass out you won't have to go to school.
put in the mouth guard.
what are you guys doing?
he's repressing a memory. We need to go deep into his subconscious mind.
awesome. But can you do it later? Dad wants to see Augusten in the kitchen.
we have to get you in a place where you will feel.
feel warm and you will feel...
take a seat, son.
Augusten, your mother is in a state of crisis.
that's an understatement.
your mother is in trouble with your father.
your father may want to murder your mother.
murder?
your father is a very, very sick man.
your mother needs to be protected.
what do we do?
well, I'm gonna take your mother to a motel and you're gonna stay here.
but...
I don't wanna stay here.
Deirdre, talk to your son.
when you're finished, I'll be in the car.
mom, what's going on?
your father has a lot of anger about how his life turned out.
he's projecting it onto me.
Dr. Finch is spiritually evolved.
we'll be safe with him.
can't I come to the motel too?
I love those little soaps.
no.
the doctor thinks that it's best.
for how long?
not long. A few days, maybe a week.
a week? I can't stay here for a week!
Augusten, don't argue with me. Not now.
I'll visit you in my dreams.
did you know I can do that?
once, I had a dream I went to Mexico, and when I woke up there were pesos in my hand.
I'm going to go now.
we'll be okay.
telephone call.
Hello?
I have an emergency collect call from your son, Augusten.
dear journal, somebody has to write down what's happening to me.
it's not to be believed.
so I guess that person is me.
day seven and still no sign of my mother.
this place is worse than any loony bin. I'm not kidding.
every decision in the house is made by something the Finches call...
Bible dipping.
it's like asking a Magic 8-ball a question, only you're asking God.
ask God a question, Augusten.
I don't know.
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Augusten, it's not that hard.
should we have fish sticks for dinner?
awakening.
as in, awakening our taste buds.
super, God wants us to have fish sticks.
shit, I wanted McDonald's so bad.
of the daughters, Hope is by far Finch's favorite. I know this because...
hope, you are by far my favorite daughter.
stop antagonizing me, Natalie. Just stop transferring all of your anger onto me.
please make an appointment to see Dad.
you know what? Your avoidance tactics aren't gonna work, Miss Hope.
you're the one that hates me and you're gonna have to confront that.
is this really our dinner?
fish sticks and grapes, that's all you get. I am not a maid and I'm not a chef.
you know, Natalie, you're so oral you'll never get to anal.
and you're never gonna get a dick in your dried-out cunt, you old maid.
excellent, Natalie, your hysteria is spectacular.
you're moving from the anal onto the phallic.
I'm very proud.
Oh, did I mention that Hope is an animal lover? She has a cat named Freud...
Freud is dying. - ...that speaks to her.
she told me through her purrs, which I can translate.
hope, Freud wasn't talking to you, because fucking cats can't talk.
this is animal abuse.
Augusten, be sexier. Make them want you.
she asked me to do this to her.
she contacted me during REM sleep and said that she'd hung on as long as she could.
and she wants me to sit with her so she doesn't die alone.
what are you all doing in here?
you better not be engaging in pot or other activities.
shut up, you hag. Leave us alone.
so how long are you gonna be carrying around that basket?
until Freud dies.
which should be the end of the week.
according to Hope, Freud died of kitty leukemia.
according to me,
Freud died of being trapped in a laundry basket for four days without food or water.
Augusten, pay your respects.
am I coming home for good now?
no, baby. Just a weekend visit.
you should let me cut your bangs.
it'd be really cool.
so is that what you wanna be? A hairdresser?
well, don't say "hairdresser.
say professional, licensed cosmetologist.
but what I really want is to own my own hair empire, you know?
like Vidal Sassoon.
what?
what do you wanna be?
her.
coed, majoring in literature.
you should apply.
they'd never let me in.
why not? You're smart.
but I'm a Finch.
I'm used goods.
besides, can you imagine the college background check?
when they find out what goes on in that house, it'd be like Frankenstein, when the villagers surround the castle and then burn it to the fucking ground.
I'm gay.
big deal.
I know.
my adopted brother Neil's gay too.
where does he live?
he used to live out back in the barn.
then he got mad at my Dad because he wouldn't give him a real room in the house, so he moved to some boarding house.
he rents a single room out there. Kinda like a pied? -Terre.
you two should meet. I think you'd really like each other.
two, please.
Thanks.
that director is fucked up.
I've seen that like four times this week already.
I love French movies.
first cousins fall in love and then stab each other as the weeping clown appears.
I don't really understand the weeping clown part but...
it represents the loss of innocence.
wanna check out my wheels?
sure. - Come on.
so do you see your mom at all?
sometimes.
on the weekends.
it's tough to have a sick mom, right?
my mom couldn't handle me either. Neither could my dad.
Yeah, mine too. He never wants to see me.
where does that leave you?
at the crazy house of the even crazier Finch.
do you think he's crazy?
in a good way. I think he's a genius.
like when I was your age and I'd have a rage seizure, he'd put on music to lower my blood pressure.
NAT King Cole, Stardust, revolutionary sort of stuff, you know?
worked every time.
if he hadn't adopted me, shit, I don't know what I would've done.
well, here she is.
but couldn't you have just been his patient?
I mean, I don't understand why he had to adopt you.
well, Finch believes that a person becomes an adult at 13.
at that age, no adult can tell them what to do.
and they can choose their own parents. I did it.
Natalie did it.
Natalie?
Natalie never mentioned that to me.
Oh, really?
ask her about Terrence Maxwell.
you're over 13, right?
Finchy saved my life, that's for sure.
he was the first person I told I was gay.
I'm gay too.
holy Mary, Mother of God, so that's what this is about. You're gay?
Yeah.
I thought Natalie had told you.
small world, right?
you, me.
crazy.
smoke?
here, let me light you.
want a ride home?
please.
I won't go fast.
maybe.
what just happened?
you think you're gay, right?
that's what gay men do.
just wanted you to know what you're in for.
want a beer? Smoke?
no.
journal, what can I say? He drove a cool car.
and it sure beat another crazy dinner at the Finch house.
there's a first time for everything, right?
I took those. In New York.
they're not very good.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything. I'm not very good at anything.
shut up.
what?
nothing.
one positive thing has come out of this.
nobody can ever say again that I'm afraid of trying new things.
come on, get dressed. I have to drive you back to Finch's.
I wanna go to my mom's.
you okay with what happened?
Yeah, sure.
well...
thanks for everything.
thank you.
thank you for everything.
Oh, Fern. Fern. Fern...
no, Fern, it's okay.
no, no, no, it's okay.
Augusten. Augusten.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. God.
I wish you enjoyed school more.
although I guess it must be very dull compared to your life with me.
would you hand me my cover-up? I'm chilly.
watch it, Augusten!
I've got a lit cigarette in my hand.
don't act out in anger.
if you're upset by this, talk to me about it.
how could I not have known?
how long has this been happening?
I've been in love with Fern for a very long time.
our relationship became physical a number of weeks ago.
the intimate details are between me and Fern.
journal, I'm confused. How can my mother be with Fern?
fern drives a Chevy Nova.
I worry about you so.
I worry about you in school.
the law says you have to go. - Well, fuck that!
Augusten, please don't smoke my cigarettes.
you have a pack of your own.
although I wish you wouldn't smoke. - Well, I do.
all my life I've been oppressed, Augusten.
and all my life I've worked hard to fight that oppression.
when I was a little girl living in Cairo, Georgia,
I had a black nanny named Elsa who lived in a shack on the other side of town.
and in those days black people were called niggers.
and I knew that word "nigger" was a dirty word.
and I knew it was a word filled with hatred and anger.
I knew Elsa was no nigger. I knew it was wrong.
it's taken me all my life to claim myself as an artist and to claim myself as a woman.
I have struggled against the oppression of my mother and the oppression of your father, and for the first time in my life I feel I am truly able to claim myself.
and so, Augusten, I hope I have your support in my relationship with Fern because at this stage in my life I do not need and I will not accept more oppression.
I have spent my entire life fighting oppression.
I hope I don't have to fight you too.
can I have $5?
may I have $5?
Why?
so I can skip school tomorrow and go to the movies.
go get my pocketbook. I'll take a look.
do you like my new house?
I need high ceilings.
so, you've been spending a lot of time at the Finches' house.
are there other options I'm not aware of?
what is this?
adoption papers.
Dr. Finch has agreed to become your legal guardian.
what?
after discussing this with the doctor, we both feel this really is the best option.
he and his family can give you the attention you need.
you're giving me away to your shrink?
no.
I'm doing what's best for you. What's best for us.
I love you very, very much.
I will always be your parent. And you will always be my child.
and my fucking father won't even give me money for food.
he won't take my calls.
Yeah. He's basically worthless.
just like my mom.
just like the fucking nuns who beat me.
God.
sometimes I feel like just taking a butcher knife and just stabbing them both.
I understand.
you're the only one who does.
how close are you to Bookman, Augusten?
it started out as just friends, and now it's more than that.
this is a sexual relationship?
Bookman isn't a stable man.
his problems run very, very deep.
he seems okay.
well, I'm not saying you can't see him.
after all, as you say, you are already involved.
but I just want you to keep me abreast of the situation.
fine.
now, would you like some of these?
what are they?
well, I just got some samples in the mail, so I don't know.
so let me see.
this is mild anti-anxiety medication which might help you feel a little calmer...
I'm calm.
...when I tell you you have to go to school.
I go to school. - I'm on to your clever tricks, son.
I know you stay until homeroom, when they do attendance, and then you skip out.
I know when you've been naughty.
what are you, Santa Claus?
if by that you're asking am I the great patriarch, the father-giver, who fulfills wishes and challenges dreams and brings merriment to those who are suffering, well, then yes, Augusten, I am Santa Claus.
I'm not going!
you're in junior high, for Christ's sake. It can't be that bad.
I don't fit in.
where would we be without our painful childhoods?
well, the only loophole, or way I can see of getting you out of school for any considerable length of time, would be for you to commit suicide.
you want me to kill myself? - Well, if you try to kill yourself,
I could explain to the school board that you are psychologically unfit to attend, and that you needed intensive treatment.
it would be a staged suicide attempt.
of course, your poor mother would have to find you and drive you to the hospital, where you would stay for three weeks, or a month, for observation.
I don't know, it doesn't... I don't...
where is your spirit of adventure?
Augusten, stay with us!
you're in a hospital. We gotta get these pills out of your stomach.
Oh, God, Augusten, wake up!
don't you die on me! Wake up! Augusten!
wake up! Wake up!
please, stop! Please!
no, please!
I can't breathe.
no, get away from me! Get away!
the lady at the store said it has illustrations of all the procedures that cosmetology students have to master before they earn their license.
cold waves. Those are really hard.
well, now you can learn how to do them.
it's good to have a dream, Augusten.
dreams get you through the hard times.
what's your dream?
me?
I was never fancy enough to have one of those.
I was always too busy.
working.
well, so the doctor could go to school and...
no.
then the kids came and...
raising a family keeps you on the run and...
maybe that was your dream.
to have a family.
Yes.
that was a dream.
it's a good one to have.
Hello?
Fern, it's me.
why can't we do it?
get out.
I miss you.
I miss the smell of you.
who is it?
I'm not interested in what you're selling.
please don't call here again.
shit!
shit! It's all shit!
I'm digging this new look. I think you look much better.
Oh, my fucking hair! Oh, my God!
that was funny.
you should be laughing.
you know what, Augusten?
I'm not gonna throw you a pity party.
so fucking just get over yourself.
fuck you, Natalie. You don't know what it's like to be sent away.
you're right, I don't.
and you don't know what it's like to have a boyfriend that's just using you!
lucky me.
who's Terrence Maxwell, Natalie?
I've never heard of him.
tell me who he is.
tell me who he is. - Shut up.
it kills you, doesn't it? - Shut up.
let it out! - Shut up.
tell me who he is, Natalie! - Shut up.
tell me so I don't feel so alone!
he was the only one I ever loved and he doesn't want me anymore!
do you feel better?
a little bit.
how'd you meet him?
Terrence started seeing my dad after his mom died.
she left him everything.
he was 41 when I was 13.
he told me I was pretty.
and he made me believe it.
one day he broke my collar bone and I had to hitchhike to the emergency room, and I passed out on the side of the road and somebody found me.
my dad told him that he would press charges and that he would go to jail, unless he donated money to my college fund.
and he did.
75000
that's so great.
so, if you just apply... - My dad spent it.
every penny.
so that the IRS wouldn't take this house.
so I do know what it's like, Augusten, to love somebody who doesn't deserve it.
because they're all you have.
God, I hate my life.
I hate this kitchen.
I need high ceilings.
me too.
let's get rid of it, then.
let's take down the ceiling.
Deirdre, I need to talk to you.
I'm a fuckup and it's your fault!
that's right, Neil, blame your father for your inability to focus.
direct all that rage at me if it makes you feel better.
I can't focus because of the voices!
I see you for what you are.
yeah? Camera never lies, see?
my parents have given you thousands of dollars and I'm still sick!
you haven't helped me get better! You know what I do!
and you haven't helped me get better!
Deirdre?
did you hear me?
Hello, Agnes.
why am I here?
well, you have an appointment. Your regular 2: 00.
Yes. Why are you here?
because I want you to stop seeing my husband.
you're right, Neil, you're right. I've done nothing, apparently.
I've never pulled any strings, gotten you a scholarship to the University of Rochester to pursue your photographic interests. Absolutely nothing.
you just wanted to get rid of me.
I don't wanna get rid of Augusten. He's part of the family now.
it's just you. I just need you to go.
but then I'd miss my therapy. I need Dr. Finch.
no, I need Dr. Finch!
I'm not as pretty as you and I don't have your talent.
all I have is this family. And this family doesn't work without him.
why won't you let me live in the house and be a part of this family?
because I am the patriarch, and when the patriarch says jump, you jump, God damn it!
you don't cooperate, Neil, and for that you're punished.
that's not why you won't let me live in this house.
you won't let me 'cause you're afraid of me, aren't you?
of what I could do to you in the middle of the night while you're sleeping?
you're afraid of my anger, aren't you, Doctor?
our time is up, Neil.
I believe we've made a breakthrough today.
Really?
I am to see the doctor now.
Hello, Neil.
Hello, Mrs. Burroughs, you look wonderful.
Oh, thank you. How's my son?
he's just great.
will you be kind to him? - I will.
that's why I'm blocked, Dr. Finch, I'm sure of it.
you're not blocked because of Fern, Deirdre.
you're constipated creatively because of the rage you are not expressing.
scream, Deirdre, scream. Express the pain.
fern has ceased to be a suitable companion, Deirdre.
you need someone who worships you, who will feed your talent.
I have just the candidate.
Deirdre, I'd like to introduce you to Dorothy Ambrose, my 3: 00.
Dorothy is creative like you. She paints her fingernails to match her mood.
what color are we today, Dorothy?
shell pink. I've had a nice day.
Dorothy has a trust fund.
it was established by her father after he showed her his penis in a rowboat.
I've always wanted a daughter.
the ceiling was crushing us.
so we made a skylight.
I think it brings a much-needed sense of humor to the kitchen.
Vienna sausage. I've been looking for these.
I'll get it.
don't touch my sausage.
Dr. Finch? - Yes.
michael Shephard, IRS.
where will I treat the people who need me?
how will I provide for my family?
you got an extension, Dad.
six weeks. After six weeks they take the house.
we'll pray. God will help us.
and when God turns a deaf ear we can all just live in the car, because at least that's paid for.
you are a terrible daughter.
well, fuck you, kiss-ass.
just remember,
daddy's like a great ocean liner.
if he goes down, he's taking a lot of people with him.
stop.
damn it, Bookman! - What?
something's not right.
it's your hair. It lacks proper body.
that's because you've been pulling at it for two hours.
well, I wouldn't have to pull at it if it wasn't so naturally hideous.
I'm not complaining. I love it.
I love everything you touch.
maybe you could work on my mustache.
no, this is useless. Natalie, come here, let me try on you.
no, no. Fuck that. Forget it. I am through being your guinea pig.
look, my hair's coming out in fistfuls.
stop scratching at it.
you look like you have Down syndrome.
hope.
well, look, one of you is gonna have to help me, okay?
I don't get into beauty school unless I master the cold wave.
guess you're stuck with me, jocko.
being in love is fantastic, Hope. You should try it.
I'd hardly call you an expert.
are you saying my relationship with Augusten isn't real love?
I'm saying your relationship with Augusten is not mature love, no.
bullshit!
Neil, if you're not man enough to handle the truth, then maybe you should not be with a child.
I'm not a child, Hope.
you're right, Augusten, you're not. I'm sorry, you're very mature.
it's just that I was speaking of the love you have when you're older. Mature love.
and what do you, Miss Iceberg, know about mature love?
when was the last time you had anything in your twat besides a tampon?
that is the fucking truth.
all right, Bookman, that's enough!
I'm certainly not gonna listen to you when you're talking like a teenage boy!
what's in this? I'm starving.
Oh, this and that. My secret ingredient.
would you like to try?
what's the secret ingredient?
Freud.
freud's dead, Hope. You buried her.
I heard her calling me. She wanted me to dig her up.
she asked to be reincarnated as a stew.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
you fucking lunatic! I knew you were insane!
I don't eat pussy. Psycho.
come on, Augusten, let's go.
I want my beads back, Hope.
I was just kidding, you jerks!
got some of my anger out.
today, we are going to explore sense memory.
I'd like everybody to take their blade of grass and stroke their cheeks with their eyes closed.
other senses are heightened when the eyes are closed.
it's very soothing, isn't it?
all right.
Neil, I believe you have a poem you'd like to read today.
Yes.
Deirdre, I'm not sure I feel comfortable with a man in our safe space.
I guess, emotionally.
I just need time to process this.
Joan, Neil is a beautiful and sensitive poet.
he's part of my family and we are going to welcome him today with open arms and open ears.
okay, fine.
but he's a man.
Joan, what you need to focus on is not the presence of a man in this room, but the lack of your mother's presence in your poetry.
Neil.
the Angry Nun.
by Neil Bookman.
"Bitch!"
"whore of Jesus!"
"dressed in black, you do not bleed like a woman should bleed between the legs!"
"but with your ruler, your crucifix of hatred, you strike my tender flesh!"
"I bleed for you!"
"Oh, Mother."
and then I ran out of ink.
good anger. It ended exactly at the right moment.
Augusten, would you make me some iced tea?
my new medicine makes my throat so dry.
baby, I'll get it. I got it.
all right, all right, Neil. Let's break it down. Let's break it down for Neil.
look, I always get my mom something to drink when she works. Okay?
that's our thing. - Your mother is my thing now.
are we having a stare-down contest?
Yeah.
what do you want? What do you want? Money?
here's 50 bucks. Go chase the ice-cream truck.
leave!
you think this whole thing is funny, don't you?
you look at my mom's craziness as something to entertain you!
you are so mundane. Your mother is an artist.
if you want Hamburger Helper, cupcake, you need to find yourself another mother.
everyone! Come quickly!
wake up! Wake up!
a miracle!
a miracle! A miracle has occurred!
what are you looking at?
dad's morning shit.
see? See how the tip of the coil is breaking out of the surface of the water?
holy Father.
doctor.
let me draw you a nice bath.
Agnes.
go get a shoehorn. A shoehorn, Agnes.
but what does it mean, Dad?
it means our financial situation is turning round.
it means things are looking upward, literally.
the shit is pointing out of the pot, towards heaven, to God.
my turd is a direct communication from the Holy Father.
no, no, no, no, children. No. Laugh. Laugh.
God is. He is the funniest man in the universe.
Agnes, I want you to carefully remove this, take it outside and let it dry in the sun.
we're starting a shrine, Agnes, a shrine.
hope, let's prepare.
now I'll never get into Vassar.
Agnes?
somebody's gotta stay on top of things in this house.
I am just trying to hold it all together.
I need to ask you something.
he's fine. The doctor will be fine.
he's just overextended.
that's not what I wanted to ask you. - What do you want, Augusten?
I want you to make me Hamburger Helper.
so there it was at last, the awful truth.
thank you.
unlike my mom, I guess I had finally tapped into my subconscious.
journal, I feel doomed. I should be getting ready for college.
instead, I'm in my mother's psychiatrist's house lying on a used twin bed with pee stains on it.
how did my life take such a dismal turn? What did I do wrong along the way?
I turned 15 today.
my parents used to make such a big deal out of my birthdays, out of all the holidays.
I want it to be like it used to be, when I had a family that tried to love each other.
where nobody thought that God was talking through their shit.
I want a curfew.
I want to be grounded for sleeping with a 35-year-old schizophrenic.
I want rules and boundaries, because what I've learned is that without them all life is, is a series of surprises.
surprise!
we gotcha!
surprise.
we gotcha! And you didn't see it coming. No, you didn't.
smile.
Augusten, what's wrong?
he's just overcome, that's all.
I'll go get the matches.
this is good.
Deirdre?
Deirdre, come along now.
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital!
now, Deirdre, it's just for observation.
this is bullshit! - Dorothy!
I will not be observed!
Deirdre, I have arranged a very, very nice retreat for you in Vermont.
but if you don't open the door, we will have to get the police.
no, don't you call the police! Why you gotta go to call the pigs?
Oh, please! Oh, that's right, you think anyone that's not a lesbian is a pig!
you're all pigs! - Oh, you fucking selfish bitch!
filthy, stinking pigs! You just wanna hurt her!
will you stop? Please!
you stop! You stop!
Oh, please, why don't you go out and write your fucking poetry?
you don't need a mother! You need an exorcist!
Oh, you need a fucking bone up your ass, that's what you need!
and you'd like that, you'd like that!
now.
no, no. - Shit, shit.
we love you.
we love you.
No! No!
no, let me go!
please let me go!
let me go!
thank you.
thank you.
Oh, this is too much.
thank you so much.
grief.
the angels are gone.
for weeks I searched for them "and took the precise measurements of each room, "as if the house had grown smaller in my grief.
not good enough. Boring. Repetitive.
journal, good news.
after only a week of observation, my mother has been released from the loony bin.
Dr. Finch assures me she's doing well, and is writing a masterpiece that will finally get her on The Merv Griffin Show.
I wish I had that kind of discipline.
watch out. That's how he gets you to fall in love with him.
our first date was at the movies. My Fair Lady.
I was so nervous my palms were sweaty.
but Norman's hands were so dry.
I found out later it was from psoriasis.
he reached for my hand in the dark and that was it.
Hello, Norman.
Hello, Deirdre. You look well.
I'm sorry, Suzanne, this is my ex-wife, Deirdre.
hello.
it's nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you.
I've heard nothing about you.
I open up my mailbox every day, hoping to get a child support check from this deadbeat, but all I get is my own voice echoing back at me.
you drank our family's money away.
I don't drink anymore, Deirdre. I haven't had a drink in three years.
excuse me, could you get him a medal?
I want my money!
I sent your money to that goddamn Svengali, and his lawyer sent me a paper signed by you giving him power of attorney.
no. I didn't approve that.
Dr. Finch wouldn't do that.
did I tell you?
what? Did you tell her what? What did he tell you about me, Suzie Q?
that I was a little housewife with a stupid hobby?
well, that hobby has become quite lucrative, thank you very much.
I was just published in Yankee Magazine.
ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to quiet down and leave.
what else did he tell you about me? That I was crazy?
he's the crazy one. And he's a goddamn bastard.
he doesn't even see his own son!
he's tried. From what I hear, neither do you, Deirdre.
shut up, you cunt!
all right, that's it. Let's go.
get your hands off me!
I'm leaving here.
I need a peaceful environment to do my writing in.
could you get me a towel, please?
Jesus. Fuck.
are you wet? Did you get wet? - I'm fine.
okay.
like a sheep or a dog that can predict an earthquake,
I've always been able to sense when my mother is about to go crazy.
her eyes burn electric. Her body gives off a metallic scent.
she stops sleeping and starts developing a taste for certain foods like toothpaste sandwiches.
but journal, I think the worst is over. I really do.
hospitals make you better. My mother is going to get better.
Dorothy's gone. She took everything.
I don't wanna be alone so you're moving back in with me.
she's gone?
just you and me, baby. Come here.
Augusten, hug back.
could you make me some tea, sweetheart?
sure.
did I tell you I had a poem accepted by Yankee Magazine?
Really?
that's great.
mom, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm decoupaging my rejection letters on top of the table here.
Why?
well, I want a daily reminder of my artistic journey when I become famous.
this'll keep me humble.
mom, why did you mix your pills with Dorothy's medicine?
Dr. Finch says that's what made you sick.
I'd rather not talk about that right now.
this whole episode's been very intense for me.
but I do believe that may have been my last psychotic episode.
I think I finally broke through to my creative unconscious.
did Dorothy take all the cups, too?
she's such a bitch.
Oh, no, no. They're out back on the lawn.
what the fuck have you been up to?
giving my worldly possessions a moon bath.
anything the doctor's touched, anything he's looked at, needs to be sterilized by the night.
I can't believe I just trusted you.
you have to trust me. I'm your mother.
and honestly, Augusten, I worry about you.
I disapprove of your choices.
I haven't had a choice!
you did when you wrote this, didn't you?
you read my journal? - Don't try and compete with me, Augusten.
if you move back in with me, I won't allow it.
you'll only get hurt.
when I become a very famous woman, they'll write that I had a son who is a writer, too, who doesn't compare to my brilliance. I want more for you than that.
did you mix your pills again?
are you judging me?
where are you going?
are you gonna call the doctor? That bastard! He took my money!
I won't be taken advantage of again. Is that clear?
what are you doing in there?
let me in!
are you calling the doctor?
neighbors reporting domestic disturbance...
good evening, ma'am... - Get off of my property!
don't you dare tell me what to do, not ever! You understand me?
ma'am, you need to calm down... - Fuck you!
I will not be stifled in my own home!
hope, Hope. It's Augusten. - You are the goddamn devil! You are a Nazi!
my mom's gone crazy again and I need your help.
we need Dad.
Finch gave her a sedative.
I like watching her sleep.
she looks like she's dead.
maybe she's finally at peace.
none of us'll ever be at peace, until Finch and every bad seed spawned from Finch is dead.
you sound crazy.
come on, let's go to bed.
Neil?
Neil?
what are you doing, son? - Shut up!
I'm not your son!
what in the hell is going on?
it's all right.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil!
where did he go? - Away.
why don't we ever have any relish in this house?
what happened?
it was a family situation. It's been handled.
Natalie, you have to tell me, okay?
where did Bookman go?
where the fuck are you?
I needed to get away.
my father's very upset with you.
he feels like you're taking your mother's side in this and he needs your support because he wants to have her committed for good to a hospital.
I don't think she needs to be committed.
look, where are you? We'll come get you. - Okay.
do you have a pen?
Yeah.
okay, tell me where you are.
I'll tell you where I'll be tomorrow at noon.
the bus station.
I'm going to New York.
you're coming with me.
we gotta get away from them, Nat.
your family, my mother.
it's the only way that we can have a normal life.
what's going on?
what are we gonna do in New York, Augusten?
our only skills are restraining psychotics.
I'll write.
and I'll get a job so you can go to school.
I'll support us.
I'm afraid, Augusten.
me, too.
but we can do this.
we have to.
did a woman come in here by herself?
can I take your order?
Yes, I'd like a TaB and a slice of key lime pie.
Oh, nothing for me, thanks.
aren't you hungry? You look skinny.
you really should eat something.
don't pull that maternal crap with me now, Mom.
it's too late for that.
no, it's not too late.
we can find a house together where we both can write.
we can start over.
I am starting over.
in New York.
Really? Well, how are you gonna make that work, Augusten?
you've no formal education, no money, no furniture, no friends.
Yeah, well, could be worse.
could be going to a prom.
why did you come here then?
to say goodbye to you.
did you pack enough warm clothes?
Yeah.
I'm gonna be okay.
Natalie's not coming.
I told her I'd deal with you.
don't try to stop me, Agnes.
I'm going.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
you're the best son a mom could ever want.
you need to know that.
Oh, my God.
Agnes, there's a lot of money in here.
penny here, a dime there.
it adds up.
the doctor doesn't know I have it, of course. No one does.
you know, this morning the IRS came again and I almost gave it to them.
and then I thought, no.
for once in my life I'm going to invest wisely.
when you write a book, you send me a copy.
goodbye, my sweet boy.
Agnes?
what are you gonna do now?
I don't know.
maybe I'll take down the Christmas tree.
Yeah, mine too. He never wants to see me.
where does that leave you?
at the crazy house of the even crazier Finch.
do you think he's crazy?
in a good way. I think he's a genius.
like when I was your age and I'd have a rage seizure, he'd put on music to lower my blood pressure.
NAT King Cole, Stardust, revolutionary sort of stuff, you know?
worked every time.
if he hadn't adopted me, shit, I don't know what I would've done.
well, here she is.
but couldn't you have just been his patient?
I mean, I don't understand why he had to adopt you.
well, Finch believes that a person becomes an adult at 13.
at that age, no adult can tell them what to do.
and they can choose their own parents. I did it.
Natalie did it.
Natalie?
Natalie never mentioned that to me.
Oh, really?
ask her about Terrence Maxwell.
you're over 13, right?
Finchy saved my life, that's for sure.
he was the first person I told I was gay.
I'm gay too.
holy Mary, Mother of God, so that's what this is about. You're gay?
Yeah.
I thought Natalie had told you.
small world, right?
you, me.
crazy.
smoke?
here, let me light you.
want a ride home?
please.
I won't go fast.
maybe.
what just happened?
you think you're gay, right?
that's what gay men do.
just wanted you to know what you're in for.
want a beer? Smoke?
no.
journal, what can I say? He drove a cool car.
and it sure beat another crazy dinner at the Finch house.
there's a first time for everything, right?
I took those. In New York.
they're not very good.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything. I'm not very good at anything.
shut up.
what?
nothing.
one positive thing has come out of this.
nobody can ever say again that I'm afraid of trying new things.
come on, get dressed. I have to drive you back to Finch's.
I wanna go to my mom's.
you okay with what happened?
Yeah, sure.
well...
thanks for everything.
thank you.
thank you for everything.
Oh, Fern. Fern. Fern...
no, Fern, it's okay.
no, no, no, it's okay.
Augusten. Augusten.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. God.
I wish you enjoyed school more.
although I guess it must be very dull compared to your life with me.
would you hand me my cover-up? I'm chilly.
watch it, Augusten!
I've got a lit cigarette in my hand.
don't act out in anger.
if you're upset by this, talk to me about it.
how could I not have known?
how long has this been happening?
I've been in love with Fern for a very long time.
our relationship became physical a number of weeks ago.
the intimate details are between me and Fern.
journal, I'm confused. How can my mother be with Fern?
fern drives a Chevy Nova.
I worry about you so.
I worry about you in school.
the law says you have to go. - Well, fuck that!
Augusten, please don't smoke my cigarettes.
you have a pack of your own.
although I wish you wouldn't smoke. - Well, I do.
all my life I've been oppressed, Augusten.
and all my life I've worked hard to fight that oppression.
when I was a little girl living in Cairo, Georgia,
I had a black nanny named Elsa who lived in a shack on the other side of town.
and in those days black people were called niggers.
and I knew that word "nigger" was a dirty word.
and I knew it was a word filled with hatred and anger.
I knew Elsa was no nigger. I knew it was wrong.
it's taken me all my life to claim myself as an artist and to claim myself as a woman.
I have struggled against the oppression of my mother and the oppression of your father, and for the first time in my life I feel I am truly able to claim myself.
and so, Augusten, I hope I have your support in my relationship with Fern because at this stage in my life I do not need and I will not accept more oppression.
I have spent my entire life fighting oppression.
I hope I don't have to fight you too.
can I have $5?
may I have $5?
Why?
so I can skip school tomorrow and go to the movies.
go get my pocketbook. I'll take a look.
do you like my new house?
I need high ceilings.
so, you've been spending a lot of time at the Finches' house.
are there other options I'm not aware of?
what is this?
adoption papers.
Dr. Finch has agreed to become your legal guardian.
what?
after discussing this with the doctor, we both feel this really is the best option.
he and his family can give you the attention you need.
you're giving me away to your shrink?
no.
I'm doing what's best for you. What's best for us.
I love you very, very much.
I will always be your parent. And you will always be my child.
and my fucking father won't even give me money for food.
he won't take my calls.
Yeah. He's basically worthless.
just like my mom.
just like the fucking nuns who beat me.
God.
sometimes I feel like just taking a butcher knife and just stabbing them both.
I understand.
you're the only one who does.
how close are you to Bookman, Augusten?
it started out as just friends, and now it's more than that.
this is a sexual relationship?
Bookman isn't a stable man.
his problems run very, very deep.
he seems okay.
well, I'm not saying you can't see him.
after all, as you say, you are already involved.
but I just want you to keep me abreast of the situation.
fine.
now, would you like some of these?
what are they?
well, I just got some samples in the mail, so I don't know.
so let me see.
this is mild anti-anxiety medication which might help you feel a little calmer...
I'm calm.
...when I tell you you have to go to school.
I go to school. - I'm on to your clever tricks, son.
I know you stay until homeroom, when they do attendance, and then you skip out.
I know when you've been naughty.
what are you, Santa Claus?
if by that you're asking am I the great patriarch, the father-giver, who fulfills wishes and challenges dreams and brings merriment to those who are suffering, well, then yes, Augusten, I am Santa Claus.
I'm not going!
you're in junior high, for Christ's sake. It can't be that bad.
I don't fit in.
where would we be without our painful childhoods?
well, the only loophole, or way I can see of getting you out of school for any considerable length of time, would be for you to commit suicide.
you want me to kill myself? - Well, if you try to kill yourself,
I could explain to the school board that you are psychologically unfit to attend, and that you needed intensive treatment.
it would be a staged suicide attempt.
of course, your poor mother would have to find you and drive you to the hospital, where you would stay for three weeks, or a month, for observation.
I don't know, it doesn't... I don't...
where is your spirit of adventure?
Augusten, stay with us!
you're in a hospital. We gotta get these pills out of your stomach.
Oh, God, Augusten, wake up!
don't you die on me! Wake up! Augusten!
wake up! Wake up!
please, stop! Please!
no, please!
I can't breathe.
no, get away from me! Get away!
the lady at the store said it has illustrations of all the procedures that cosmetology students have to master before they earn their license.
cold waves. Those are really hard.
well, now you can learn how to do them.
it's good to have a dream, Augusten.
dreams get you through the hard times.
what's your dream?
me?
I was never fancy enough to have one of those.
I was always too busy.
working.
well, so the doctor could go to school and...
no.
then the kids came and...
raising a family keeps you on the run and...
maybe that was your dream.
to have a family.
Yes.
that was a dream.
it's a good one to have.
Hello?
Fern, it's me.
why can't we do it?
get out.
I miss you.
I miss the smell of you.
who is it?
I'm not interested in what you're selling.
please don't call here again.
shit!
shit! It's all shit!
I'm digging this new look. I think you look much better.
Oh, my fucking hair! Oh, my God!
that was funny.
you should be laughing.
you know what, Augusten?
I'm not gonna throw you a pity party.
so fucking just get over yourself.
fuck you, Natalie. You don't know what it's like to be sent away.
you're right, I don't.
and you don't know what it's like to have a boyfriend that's just using you!
lucky me.
who's Terrence Maxwell, Natalie?
I've never heard of him.
tell me who he is.
tell me who he is. - Shut up.
it kills you, doesn't it? - Shut up.
let it out! - Shut up.
tell me who he is, Natalie! - Shut up.
tell me so I don't feel so alone!
he was the only one I ever loved and he doesn't want me anymore!
do you feel better?
a little bit.
how'd you meet him?
Terrence started seeing my dad after his mom died.
she left him everything.
he was 41 when I was 13.
he told me I was pretty.
and he made me believe it.
one day he broke my collar bone and I had to hitchhike to the emergency room, and I passed out on the side of the road and somebody found me.
my dad told him that he would press charges and that he would go to jail, unless he donated money to my college fund.
and he did.
75000
that's so great.
so, if you just apply... - My dad spent it.
every penny.
so that the IRS wouldn't take this house.
so I do know what it's like, Augusten, to love somebody who doesn't deserve it.
because they're all you have.
God, I hate my life.
I hate this kitchen.
I need high ceilings.
me too.
let's get rid of it, then.
let's take down the ceiling.
Deirdre, I need to talk to you.
I'm a fuckup and it's your fault!
that's right, Neil, blame your father for your inability to focus.
direct all that rage at me if it makes you feel better.
I can't focus because of the voices!
I see you for what you are.
yeah? Camera never lies, see?
my parents have given you thousands of dollars and I'm still sick!
you haven't helped me get better! You know what I do!
and you haven't helped me get better!
Deirdre?
did you hear me?
Hello, Agnes.
why am I here?
well, you have an appointment. Your regular 2: 00.
Yes. Why are you here?
because I want you to stop seeing my husband.
you're right, Neil, you're right. I've done nothing, apparently.
I've never pulled any strings, gotten you a scholarship to the University of Rochester to pursue your photographic interests. Absolutely nothing.
you just wanted to get rid of me.
I don't wanna get rid of Augusten. He's part of the family now.
it's just you. I just need you to go.
but then I'd miss my therapy. I need Dr. Finch.
no, I need Dr. Finch!
I'm not as pretty as you and I don't have your talent.
all I have is this family. And this family doesn't work without him.
why won't you let me live in the house and be a part of this family?
because I am the patriarch, and when the patriarch says jump, you jump, God damn it!
you don't cooperate, Neil, and for that you're punished.
that's not why you won't let me live in this house.
you won't let me 'cause you're afraid of me, aren't you?
of what I could do to you in the middle of the night while you're sleeping?
you're afraid of my anger, aren't you, Doctor?
our time is up, Neil.
I believe we've made a breakthrough today.
Really?
I am to see the doctor now.
Hello, Neil.
Hello, Mrs. Burroughs, you look wonderful.
Oh, thank you. How's my son?
he's just great.
will you be kind to him? - I will.
that's why I'm blocked, Dr. Finch, I'm sure of it.
you're not blocked because of Fern, Deirdre.
you're constipated creatively because of the rage you are not expressing.
scream, Deirdre, scream. Express the pain.
fern has ceased to be a suitable companion, Deirdre.
you need someone who worships you, who will feed your talent.
I have just the candidate.
Deirdre, I'd like to introduce you to Dorothy Ambrose, my 3: 00.
Dorothy is creative like you. She paints her fingernails to match her mood.
what color are we today, Dorothy?
shell pink. I've had a nice day.
Dorothy has a trust fund.
it was established by her father after he showed her his penis in a rowboat.
I've always wanted a daughter.
the ceiling was crushing us.
so we made a skylight.
I think it brings a much-needed sense of humor to the kitchen.
Vienna sausage. I've been looking for these.
I'll get it.
don't touch my sausage.
Dr. Finch? - Yes.
michael Shephard, IRS.
where will I treat the people who need me?
how will I provide for my family?
you got an extension, Dad.
six weeks. After six weeks they take the house.
we'll pray. God will help us.
and when God turns a deaf ear we can all just live in the car, because at least that's paid for.
you are a terrible daughter.
well, fuck you, kiss-ass.
just remember,
daddy's like a great ocean liner.
if he goes down, he's taking a lot of people with him.
stop.
damn it, Bookman! - What?
something's not right.
it's your hair. It lacks proper body.
that's because you've been pulling at it for two hours.
well, I wouldn't have to pull at it if it wasn't so naturally hideous.
I'm not complaining. I love it.
I love everything you touch.
maybe you could work on my mustache.
no, this is useless. Natalie, come here, let me try on you.
no, no. Fuck that. Forget it. I am through being your guinea pig.
look, my hair's coming out in fistfuls.
stop scratching at it.
you look like you have Down syndrome.
hope.
well, look, one of you is gonna have to help me, okay?
I don't get into beauty school unless I master the cold wave.
guess you're stuck with me, jocko.
being in love is fantastic, Hope. You should try it.
I'd hardly call you an expert.
are you saying my relationship with Augusten isn't real love?
I'm saying your relationship with Augusten is not mature love, no.
bullshit!
Neil, if you're not man enough to handle the truth, then maybe you should not be with a child.
I'm not a child, Hope.
you're right, Augusten, you're not. I'm sorry, you're very mature.
it's just that I was speaking of the love you have when you're older. Mature love.
and what do you, Miss Iceberg, know about mature love?
when was the last time you had anything in your twat besides a tampon?
that is the fucking truth.
all right, Bookman, that's enough!
I'm certainly not gonna listen to you when you're talking like a teenage boy!
what's in this? I'm starving.
Oh, this and that. My secret ingredient.
would you like to try?
what's the secret ingredient?
Freud.
freud's dead, Hope. You buried her.
I heard her calling me. She wanted me to dig her up.
she asked to be reincarnated as a stew.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
you fucking lunatic! I knew you were insane!
I don't eat pussy. Psycho.
come on, Augusten, let's go.
I want my beads back, hope.
I was just kidding, you jerks!
got some of my anger out.
today, we are going to explore sense memory.
I'd like everybody to take their blade of grass and stroke their cheeks with their eyes closed.
other senses are heightened when the eyes are closed.
it's very soothing, isn't it?
all right.
Neil, I believe you have a poem you'd like to read today.
Yes.
Deirdre, I'm not sure I feel comfortable with a man in our safe space.
I guess, emotionally.
I just need time to process this.
Joan, Neil is a beautiful and sensitive poet.
he's part of my family and we are going to welcome him today with open arms and open ears.
okay, fine.
but he's a man.
Joan, what you need to focus on is not the presence of a man in this room, but the lack of your mother's presence in your poetry.
Neil.
the Angry Nun.
by Neil Bookman.
bitch!
whore of Jesus!
dressed in black, you do not bleed like a woman should bleed between the legs!
but with your ruler, your crucifix of hatred, you strike my tender flesh!
I bleed for you!
Oh, Mother.
and then I ran out of ink.
good anger. It ended exactly at the right moment.
Augusten, would you make me some iced tea?
my new medicine makes my throat so dry.
baby, I'll get it. I got it.
all right, all right, Neil. Let's break it down. Let's break it down for Neil.
look, I always get my mom something to drink when she works. Okay?
that's our thing. - Your mother is my thing now.
are we having a stare-down contest?
Yeah.
what do you want? What do you want? Money?
here's 50 bucks. Go chase the ice-cream truck.
leave!
you think this whole thing is funny, don't you?
you look at my mom's craziness as something to entertain you!
you are so mundane. Your mother is an artist.
if you want Hamburger Helper, cupcake, you need to find yourself another mother.
everyone! Come quickly!
wake up! Wake up!
a miracle!
a miracle! A miracle has occurred!
what are you looking at?
dad's morning shit.
see? See how the tip of the coil is breaking out of the surface of the water?
holy Father.
doctor.
let me draw you a nice bath.
Agnes.
go get a shoehorn. A shoehorn, Agnes.
but what does it mean, Dad?
it means our financial situation is turning round.
it means things are looking upward, literally.
the shit is pointing out of the pot, towards heaven, to God.
my turd is a direct communication from the Holy Father.
no, no, no, no, children. No. Laugh. Laugh.
God is. He is the funniest man in the universe.
Agnes, I want you to carefully remove this, take it outside and let it dry in the sun.
we're starting a shrine, Agnes, a shrine.
hope, let's prepare.
now I'll never get into Vassar.
Agnes?
somebody's gotta stay on top of things in this house.
I am just trying to hold it all together.
I need to ask you something.
he's fine. The doctor will be fine.
he's just overextended.
that's not what I wanted to ask you. - What do you want, Augusten?
I want you to make me Hamburger Helper.
so there it was at last, the awful truth.
thank you.
unlike my mom, I guess I had finally tapped into my subconscious.
journal, I feel doomed. I should be getting ready for college.
instead, I'm in my mother's psychiatrist's house lying on a used twin bed with pee stains on it.
how did my life take such a dismal turn? What did I do wrong along the way?
I turned 15 today.
my parents used to make such a big deal out of my birthdays, out of all the holidays.
I want it to be like it used to be, when I had a family that tried to love each other.
where nobody thought that God was talking through their shit.
I want a curfew.
I want to be grounded for sleeping with a 35-year-old schizophrenic.
I want rules and boundaries, because what I've learned is that without them all life is, is a series of surprises.
surprise!
we gotcha!
surprise.
we gotcha! And you didn't see it coming. No, you didn't.
smile.
Augusten, what's wrong?
he's just overcome, that's all.
I'll go get the matches.
this is good.
Deirdre?
Deirdre, come along now.
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital!
now, Deirdre, it's just for observation.
this is bullshit! - Dorothy!
I will not be observed!
Deirdre, I have arranged a very, very nice retreat for you in Vermont.
but if you don't open the door, we will have to get the police.
no, don't you call the police! Why you gotta go to call the pigs?
Oh, please! Oh, that's right, you think anyone that's not a lesbian is a pig!
you're all pigs! - Oh, you fucking selfish bitch!
filthy, stinking pigs! You just wanna hurt her!
will you stop? Please!
you stop! You stop!
Oh, please, why don't you go out and write your fucking poetry?
you don't need a mother! You need an exorcist!
Oh, you need a fucking bone up your ass, that's what you need!
and you'd like that, you'd like that!
now.
no, no. - Shit, shit.
we love you.
we love you.
No! No!
no, let me go!
please let me go!
let me go!
thank you.
thank you.
Oh, this is too much.
thank you so much.
grief.
the angels are gone.
for weeks I searched for them "and took the precise measurements of each room, "as if the house had grown smaller in my grief.
not good enough. Boring. Repetitive.
journal, good news.
after only a week of observation, my mother has been released from the loony bin.
Dr. Finch assures me she's doing well, and is writing a masterpiece that will finally get her on The Merv Griffin Show.
I wish I had that kind of discipline.
watch out. That's how he gets you to fall in love with him.
our first date was at the movies. My Fair Lady.
I was so nervous my palms were sweaty.
but Norman's hands were so dry.
I found out later it was from psoriasis.
he reached for my hand in the dark and that was it.
Hello, Norman.
Hello, Deirdre. You look well.
I'm sorry, Suzanne, this is my ex-wife, Deirdre.
hello.
it's nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you.
I've heard nothing about you.
I open up my mailbox every day, hoping to get a child support check from this deadbeat, but all I get is my own voice echoing back at me.
you drank our family's money away.
I don't drink anymore, Deirdre. I haven't had a drink in three years.
excuse me, could you get him a medal?
I want my money!
I sent your money to that goddamn Svengali, and his lawyer sent me a paper signed by you giving him power of attorney.
no. I didn't approve that.
Dr. Finch wouldn't do that.
did I tell you?
what? Did you tell her what? What did he tell you about me, Suzie Q?
that I was a little housewife with a stupid hobby?
well, that hobby has become quite lucrative, thank you very much.
I was just published in Yankee Magazine.
ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to quiet down and leave.
what else did he tell you about me? That I was crazy?
he's the crazy one. And he's a goddamn bastard.
he doesn't even see his own son!
he's tried. From what I hear, neither do you, Deirdre.
shut up, you cunt!
all right, that's it. Let's go.
get your hands off me!
I'm leaving here.
I need a peaceful environment to do my writing in.
could you get me a towel, please?
Jesus. Fuck.
are you wet? Did you get wet? - I'm fine.
okay.
like a sheep or a dog that can predict an earthquake,
I've always been able to sense when my mother is about to go crazy.
her eyes burn electric. Her body gives off a metallic scent.
she stops sleeping and starts developing a taste for certain foods like toothpaste sandwiches.
but journal, I think the worst is over. I really do.
hospitals make you better. My mother is going to get better.
Dorothy's gone. She took everything.
I don't wanna be alone so you're moving back in with me.
she's gone?
just you and me, baby. Come here.
Augusten, hug back.
could you make me some tea, sweetheart?
sure.
did I tell you I had a poem accepted by Yankee Magazine?
Really?
that's great.
mom, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm decoupaging my rejection letters on top of the table here.
Why?
well, I want a daily reminder of my artistic journey when I become famous.
this'll keep me humble.
mom, why did you mix your pills with Dorothy's medicine?
Dr. Finch says that's what made you sick.
I'd rather not talk about that right now.
this whole episode's been very intense for me.
but I do believe that may have been my last psychotic episode.
I think I finally broke through to my creative unconscious.
did Dorothy take all the cups, too?
she's such a bitch.
Oh, no, no. They're out back on the lawn.
what the fuck have you been up to?
giving my worldly possessions a moon bath.
anything the doctor's touched, anything he's looked at, needs to be sterilized by the night.
I can't believe I just trusted you.
you have to trust me. I'm your mother.
and honestly, Augusten, I worry about you.
I disapprove of your choices.
I haven't had a choice!
you did when you wrote this, didn't you?
you read my journal? - Don't try and compete with me, Augusten.
if you move back in with me, I won't allow it.
you'll only get hurt.
when I become a very famous woman, they'll write that I had a son who is a writer, too, who doesn't compare to my brilliance. I want more for you than that.
did you mix your pills again?
are you judging me?
where are you going?
are you gonna call the doctor? That bastard! He took my money!
I won't be taken advantage of again. Is that clear?
what are you doing in there?
let me in!
are you calling the doctor?
neighbors reporting domestic disturbance...
good evening, ma'am... - Get off of my property!
don't you dare tell me what to do, not ever! You understand me?
ma'am, you need to calm down... - Fuck you!
I will not be stifled in my own home!
hope, Hope. It's Augusten. - You are the goddamn devil! You are a Nazi!
my mom's gone crazy again and I need your help.
we need Dad.
Finch gave her a sedative.
I like watching her sleep.
she looks like she's dead.
maybe she's finally at peace.
none of us'll ever be at peace, until Finch and every bad seed spawned from Finch is dead.
you sound crazy.
come on, let's go to bed.
Neil?
Neil?
what are you doing, son? - Shut up!
I'm not your son!
what in the hell is going on?
it's all right.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil!
where did he go? - Away.
why don't we ever have any relish in this house?
what happened?
it was a family situation. It's been handled.
Natalie, you have to tell me, okay?
where did Bookman go?
where the fuck are you?
I needed to get away.
my father's very upset with you.
he feels like you're taking your mother's side in this and he needs your support because he wants to have her committed for good to a hospital.
I don't think she needs to be committed.
look, where are you? We'll come get you. - Okay.
do you have a pen?
Yeah.
okay, tell me where you are.
I'll tell you where I'll be tomorrow at noon.
the bus station.
I'm going to New York.
you're coming with me.
we gotta get away from them, Nat.
your family, my mother.
it's the only way that we can have a normal life.
what's going on?
what are we gonna do in New York, Augusten?
our only skills are restraining psychotics.
I'll write.
and I'll get a job so you can go to school.
I'll support us.
I'm afraid, Augusten.
me, too.
but we can do this.
we have to.
did a woman come in here by herself?
can I take your order?
Yes, I'd like a TaB and a slice of key lime pie.
Oh, nothing for me, thanks.
aren't you hungry? You look skinny.
you really should eat something.
don't pull that maternal crap with me now, Mom.
it's too late for that.
no, it's not too late.
we can find a house together where we both can write.
we can start over.
I am starting over.
in New York.
Really? Well, how are you gonna make that work, Augusten?
you've no formal education, no money, no furniture, no friends.
Yeah, well, could be worse.
could be going to a prom.
why did you come here then?
to say goodbye to you.
did you pack enough warm clothes?
Yeah.
I'm gonna be okay.
Natalie's not coming.
I told her I'd deal with you.
don't try to stop me, Agnes.
I'm going.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
you're the best son a mom could ever want.
you need to know that.
Oh, my God.
Agnes, there's a lot of money in here.
penny here, a dime there.
it adds up.
the doctor doesn't know I have it, of course. No one does.
you know, this morning the IRS came again and I almost gave it to them.
and then I thought, no.
for once in my life I'm going to invest wisely.
when you write a book, you send me a copy.
goodbye, my sweet boy.
Agnes?
what are you gonna do now?
I don't know.
maybe I'll take down the Christmas tree.
so, are you a pair of ninja assassins?
what?
are you hit men for the yakuza?
we're not from Japan. We're from Jersey.
just think, Jennifer Tilly is playing me in a movie.
it's absolutely perfect casting.
but that voice!
I know, she sounds just like an angel.
now, I've got it all figured out.
I'm going to transfer myself into Jennifer...
and you're going to transfer yourself into Redman.
I'm down with that.
we'll ditch these plastic bodies once and for all...
and we'll be Hollywood's hottest couple.
what about me?
don't worry, Glenda. I've got that figured out, too.
you're going to be a real live girl.
boy. - How?
well, I'm not getting pregnant again, I'll tell you that much.
my mother always told me:
once is a blessing. Twice is a curse.
well, that would explain your sister.
the only sensible option is a surrogate mother.
Hey!
Jennifer, I have something important to say...
hold on a second, Sweetheart.
Hello?
what are you doing? . I'm busy.
I do have a life, you know.
turn on the news.
were you having an affair?
the actress discovered the victim's body.
as of yet, there is no official confirmation as to whether or not Miss Tilly is a suspect.
Jesus!
can you believe this? - Are you okay?
I've had better days.
listen, Joan, I need you to do something for me.
I need you to get me a bottle of champagne and bring it by my house.
what for?
I've got a big night tonight. - Tonight?
with who? - Redman.
Jennifer, what are you up to?
thank you, Joan.
come on, Stan, it's just business.
he'll be out of there by midnight.
Oh, my God, she's a complete slut.
nighty. Glenda. Sleep tight.
leave it on.
sweetie, there's nothing to be scared of.
your daddy and I will be right here.
why do you kill people?
excuse me? - Why do you kill?
it's a hobby, really. It helps us relax.
am I going to be a killer?
of course. It's been a family tradition for generations.
but violence is bad, isn't it? They said so on TV.
not "violence."
Violins." Violins are bad.
that screeching music's gonna ruin the goddamn country.
Chucky, Glenda's right. It's time we owned up to it.
we have a problem with killing.
I don't have "a problem" with killing.
I like a little killing now and then.
what's wrong with that?
killing is an addiction, like any other drug.
but we're parents now. We have to set a good example.
let's quit, Chucky, right now. Cold turkey.
you have got to be kidding.
promise me, Chucky, no more killing.
no.
no more killing. We can't do it anymore.
a thousand times no. -We have the future to think of.
we have a child! - Fine!
all right, already. I promise.
thank you, doll baby. You're a sweetheart.
now we really will be the perfect family.
did you hear that?
maybe you should forget the director and fuck the exterminator instead.
so, how do I look?
never mind. Jennifer, this is beneath you.
think about what you're doing. What are people gonna say?
who cares what people say?
but don't you see how evil this is? - I don't wanna hear it.
you're prostituting yourself so you can play the Virgin Mary.
Joan, I don't wanna hear it.
this is so evil.
you're going to hell. - No.
hell would be ending up on Celebrity Fear Factory...
in a worm. eating contest with Anna Nicole Smith.
which you'd win.
he's here.
let yourself out the back.
and while you're at it, why don't you leave your key on the counter?
what are you saying?
well, you think I'm so disgusting.
you think I'm going to hell.
I'm only trying to survive here, Joan.
God knows I wouldn't want to drag you down with me.
I'm saying you're fired.
now, in artificial insemination, timing is everything.
so you'll have to hurry. That shouldn't be a problem for you.
Yeah, just don't let that player get into her pants.
I don't want him touching my woman...
till I'm him and you're her. . right.
aren't you going to give me a hand here?
too tall.
Lezbos.
done her.
here we go.
come to papa.
Cheers.
you know, I wasn't bullshitting when I told you I was a fan.
that's so sweet, Redman.
which of my films is your favorite?
that movie when you and that chick was making out.
bound. Everybody likes that one.
you still in touch with homegirl?
Gina? -Yeah.
Yeah, sure, we're friends. Close friends.
very close friends.
maybe, the three of us could hang out together some time.
you know, I would really like that a lot.
okay. I'll see if I can make it happen.
bottoms up, baby. - cheers!
I was wondering...
what's it gonna take to make you see me as a virgin.
well, you tell me.
a masturbating midget?
get it, mini. meat.
sweet Jesus, God bless the little people.
I don't know if I can do this. - Why not?
what will people say? Man, fuck what people say.
know what I'm saying? This was meant to be, baby, for real.
know how I know? Because the man upstairs told me so.
Really? - Hell, yeah.
look, Mel Gibson ain't the only one God's been talking to in Hollywood.
he personally told me that you was my Virgin.
well, I guess.
what the hell?
pig.
and you...
you should be ashamed of yourself.
Where's your self respect?
you know what my mother used to say about dirty girls?
she said, "You can always smell it on girls who sell it..."
by the way, Miss Tilly, can I have your autograph?
I'm a big fan.
what am I supposed to do with this?
now, Miss Tilly, I know you're frightened.
you're probably even wondering if you've gone completely insane.
but I promise you, tomorrow you're going to wake up...
and this will all seem just like a bad dream.
in the meantime, we can do this the easy way...
or the hard way.
it's really up to you.
no wonder her career's in trouble.
check it out, Tiff. Look at the size of his feet.
you know what they say.
fuck, she's fat.
I can't believe it. She's not even pregnant yet.
paparazzi scumbag.
looks like you've got everything under control.
I'll just leave you to it.
motherhood is so beautiful.
no.
sorry, just messing with you.
what time is it?
time to get dressed.
we are going to have our own boys' night out, just you and me.
how does that sound?
.Where are we going? . hunting.
I can't see anything. Maybe we should slow down?
No! You're doing great.
son of a bitch!
up yours, asshole!
what? Not you, Son. Come on, floor it!
oops! I did it again.
Jesus Christ!
No!
Attaboy!
.No, I didn't. - And I thought you weren't ready.
kid, you're a fucking natural!
but he hit the shelf.
and don't worry about your mother. It will be our little secret.
say "cheese."
good morning.
Hi.
we must have really got wired last night.
Yeah.
Redman, did we...
you don't remember? - No. It's all a blur.
what about you?
I kind of remember you screaming a lot.
Yeah, I seem to remember that, too.
I tend to have that effect on women.
.Really? -Yeah.
wait, I do remember...
I had the strangest dream.
I dreamt my guardian angel came to me.
she had the sweetest voice I have ever heard.
she told me to respect myself.
and then she asked for my autograph.
let's see. Step Number One: Admit I have an addiction.
okay, check.
step Number Two:
give myself over to a higher power.
whatever.
here we go. Step Number Nine:
the recovering addict must make amend to anyone he or she has harmed.
Hello? - Good morning.
is this Ruth Bailey? - Speaking.
the widow of Robert Bailey? -Yes. Who is this?
Mrs. Bailey, my name is Tiffany Ray.
you don't know me...
but a few years ago, I killed your husband.
and I am so very, very sorry.
what is this, some kind of sick joke?
no, I'm completely serious.
but I want you to know I'm in recovery now...
and I have put all of that behind me.
I don't know who you are...
thank you, Mrs. Bailey. Have a nice day.
I feel better already.
morning, Stan.
wasn't there something important you wanted to tell me?
well.
the thing is, Jennifer.
I'm sorry. I don't know what's gotten into me.
so you were saying...
forget it. - Okay.
now, let's see.
what should we do today?
I'm pregnant.
Redman, I said I'm pregnant.
Congratulations. Who is the baby's daddy?
don't even look at me.
I haven't slept with anyone else to advance my career lately.
.who are you kidding? - It's true, Redman. Look...
I know I come off all slutty, but that's for my image. It's just...
do you think anyone would cast me in these sexpot roles...
if they knew I hadn't been laid in a year?
I haven't even slept with my driver yet...
and I think he really likes me.
that's all very touching and shit. But I'm telling you, it can't be me.
why not?
I had a vasectomy as soon as I got to Hollywood. I ain't no idiot.
that is impossible!
hey Jennifer!
I hate to break it to you. But l can't hire you if you're pregnant.
that is ridiculous. The character is pregnant.
Yeah, I know...
but I have a very specific vision of Mary.
and what can I say? She gots to be hot.
that pig!
recovery Hotline. . Yes, I'm in recovery.
and I'm afraid I'm going to have a slip.
can you get to a meeting? . no, it's really not an option.
I just freak everybody out.
don't be so hard on yourself. We're not here to judge you.
what's your name? - Tiffany.
listen to me, Tiffany. I know exactly what you are going through.
you do? - Yes, I do.
in fact, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
just last week, I had a slip.
Really? -Yes.
and believe you me, it was not pretty.
it never is, is it?
in fact, it took me three hours just to clean up the mess.
God, don't remind me.
but I'm not beating myself up over it.
you know why, Tiffany? - Why?
because Rome wasn't built in a day.
