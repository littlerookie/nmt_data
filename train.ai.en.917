Yeah, something involving Damian.
pat Mahoney's pavilion dedication.
you know, things are running behind.
you know, what do you want me to do?
OK, look, tommy, I don't want to sound cold here, but Pat Mahoney is dead and gone.
OK, and for all intents and purposes, so is Damian.
but your daughter, on the other hand, she is here, and she still needs her father.
and more amazingly, she still wants her father.
how long do you think that's gonna last if you keep neglecting her?
how did she do?
she was...
words don't do it justice.
you had to be there.
anything else you want to tell me?

I been working for city hall for 6 years, I never seen it before.
man, that's your problem, man.
you're not very observant.

Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a pavilion.

Hey, man. Come on, you don't hear everybody yelling for ya? We're all on the rig waiting.

Hey, do me a favor. Hand me the cinnamon, will you?
come on, it's right behind ya. - seriously?
Yeah, seriously. It's cheaper this way.
you better pass some of those savings on to sheila.
What'd you say? - nothing. I'm just talking to myself.
well, why don't you talk louder. - it's nothing, lou. Forget it.
I said, maybe you should talk louder.
all right, I just-I don't know man. I really don't think you should be eating that shit after, - you know, what happened. - what happened?
what happened? Come on, man, are you kidding me?
I mean, we all just put our collective ass on the line so you could waltz through your physical without breaking a sweat. So, I'm sorry.
but coming in here watching you stuffing your face with a donut-correction, donuts-is just like, I don't know, you're rubbing our faces in it.
well, you know, frankie, as much as I appreciate what you and the boys did for me, it's kind of par for the course, stepping up for a brother in need.
kinda of like what we did for you when those guys came over here looking to kick your ass after you spouted your little conspiracy theories.
all right, first of all, lou, those aren't my theories. I think you know that.
second of all, I haven't really been spouting them lately in case you haven't noticed.
OK. I owned up to my shit. I'm just saying you should do the same.
what's going on? What y'all talking about?
the thing.
which thing? - the lou thing.
right in front of him? - yeah.
what's going on?
I'm about to give the boys here another re-education in the chain of command.
respecting the shirt. - we respect the shirt, lou-as long as it fits.
back off. - we're not going to back off, tom.
we've been backing off for months, man. He needs to hear this.
he needs to hear it.
look who finally took the pacifier out of his mouth to form words.
what? Did your balls drop last night, kid? - we love you, lou. All right.
I mean, we love having you around. Shits and giggles. I mean, when you cook we eat like kings.
but- - but you ain't pulling your weight in the shit.
OK. Now you're out of line. ok.
my god. Tommy gavin's going to lecturetus on taking orders? Jesus. What a joke.
well, maybe I'll just come over on the other side of the table and beat the shit out of ya.
how would that do?
punch somebody in the face, it solves everything.
OK! We got a problem here? - yeah. Lou.
OK. You got a problem with lou, you talk to me. And I will talk to lou.
OK. Since when did this become the marine corps and shit?
I mean, we're not allowed to question authority or something?
I mean, aren't we all friends here? Family?
I mean, you guys ain't doing nothing about it. So
franco, shut your mouth.
you're going to eat your way right out that door, lou.
probably feet first. Real talk. I just pray it happens before another one of us ends up in a chair.
that is your lieutenant you are speaking to.
I don't have to explain myself to you, franco.
I taught you this goddamn job. I taught all of you how to stay alive.
I earned my rank. - you gotta keep earning it.
there. Ok, franco? You happy now? - it's a start.
good. Clean it up, franco.
don't take it there, lou. I'm your friend. Not your bitch.
pick it up.
are you two seriously on board with this? I mean, really?
your supposed friend here, you're just going to back him up in his gluttony?
chain of command, franco. We lose that, what do you think we got left?
a dirty floor, I guess.
pick it up, rivera, now.
thanks for the backup, guys. I appreciate that.
I guess I'll got get a broom, sir. - you do that.
I'm going to get more donuts. - all right.
Hey, sid.
what are you, just taking in the air out here? - just thinking of things.
all right, well you better get inside because we got troublou - trouble is all we ever got. - I'm serious. The junior guys just called out lou.
for what?
I don't know. Maybe the fact that he weighs 600 pounds.
I don't give a shit anymore.
listen, we got a full-scale mutiny going on in there.
you're just going to stand out here and count cigarette butts?
Sidney, what the hell is going on with you?
none of your goddamn business whatol going on with me!
just leave me alone, huh! All of ya!
Hey, chief
hello. - hey. How you doing?
Hey. - listen, I'm leaving work right now. You need anything?
no, I don't think so.
I just put wyatt down. He's been fighting sleep for 2 hours now.
you know what would be a great idea?
could you not come home for a couple hours or so because if he hears that door and your footsteps, he's going to want to get back up again.
and it's going to take me another couple of hours to get him back down.
you know what? I need banas and yogurt. - so, let me get this straight.
banas and yogurt and stay the hell away?
honey, I know, I'm sorry. I'm just so exhausted. - all right.
well, maybe I'll call colleen. See if she wants to go to a meeting or something.
Teddy already took her to a couple today.
and now she's out looking at wedding dresses. Just give her a little space, ok?
I mean, aren't you at work? Don't you have a hose or a helmet or something you can fix?
Yeah, probably. I don't say this often.
but I want to tell you how much I love you and
Hello? hon? That
Hey, you guys need a hand with anything? - what?
I don't know. - no.
you sure?
all right.
Hey. - what, do you need busy work to do?
just everybody's-colleen's taking care of all the kids.
nobody really needs anything. - the wives too.
you know, nobody talks about the downside about being a mormon.
every guy wants 2 chicks at the same time until they turn on you.
next thing you know, you're standing in the kitchen with your dick in one hand and a multiple shopping list in the other.
don't do anything stupid, ok? - I'm not going to do anything stupid.
I'm talking about this interview you've got coming up. All right. Just stick to the story.
Jimmy was a hero. Jimmy was my cousin. Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy. - I got it.
Tommy. The last thing we need is them poking around your personal life. Ok?
OK. Now you sound like my wives.
I ain't a mormon. I got another project for you. - what?
I need you to talk to lou.
I can't take sides. But what franco said has a lot of truth in it.
I know. - ok. I gotta put you on this, ok?
I'm sorry. But I've got my hands full with feinberg right now.
what's a matter with feinberg? - I don't know yet.
I think he might be jewish. Shalom, tatteleh.
what's tatteleh mean? - look it up.
Kelly, hey, what's up? - hey, I need you.
what's going on? You all right? - no I'm not. Not really.
can you meet me? I need someone to talk to. - where are ya?
churrascaria in tribeca. And can you hurry? I'm pretty close to the edge.
all right, I'll be there in like 20 minutes.
listen, you want to tell me about the composite again?
right, grain fibers. - grain fibers? What, you getting married in a barn?
no. We don't have our centerpieces yet. - centerpieces.
Yeah. Right.
listen, i'm going to call you back at this number. Ok. Thank you.
damn. I mean, how much of this wedding shit a brother gotta take before he starts to lose his shit.
it'd be pretty funny though if you think about it. - no, really.
when I lose my shit. I lose the shit out of my shit.
no. I mean if you got married in a barn. You could, like, ride a horse down the aisle.
train a chicken to be the ring bearer. And the minister? Dr. Doolittle.
you're going to die a lonely man, shawn.
Yeah. Black shawn's right, dude. You don't joke about wedding plans.
because if you do it right, the day will be really magical, like full of memories to last a lifetime.
but if you let the process overwhelm you, then you'll go crazy.
and everything you built up will just come crumbling down around you like in that war movie.
yeah."apocalypse now"? - "bride wars
you know, I resent that mikey, that you would comparmy life to that low rent, bullshit -.
Hey, babe, what's up? - my god. I just found the perfect dress.
sweet. - it's by christos with a sweetheart neckline and floral applique.
and it's made of ivory satin! you should come right now and see it.
you know, I'd love to. - and it's cut on the bias.
so, if you like it, get it.
I'll see you back at the apartment, and we'll celebrate.
on second thought, I'm coming down to check it out. - ok. We're and madison.
on my way. And holster that mastercard until I get there, all right?
and you're with who? Shit! 4,500 bucks for a dress?!
that shit better be made out of crusted diamonds and platinums and shit.
yo, garrity, I need some backup, man.
and she wears that tulip bodice like a princess. - I kno iw. What did you just say?
dress shop. I can't wait. Let's do it.
Hey, can I come? - sure. Just as long as you don't try shit on.
you know what? I'm just going to need 10 quick minutes because I gotta take a shit.
I think he's going to rub- - I know what the hell he's going to do. Come on.
just one second.
Hey. - hi.
Tommy, this ron. Ron, this is tommy. - hey.- hello.
OK, ron. You have to go.
rember, I told you I might have this thing later tonight that I wouldn't be able to get out of.
Yes, you mentioned that. - well, this is my thing. He's early.
you know, you're just afraid-afraid of what I represent to you.
you're pushing me away because I've asked you to embrace a measured practice of ease and calm.
and that requires becoming intimate with your own feelings of trust- Trusting yourself, trusting
I've been listening to almost an hour of this shit.
I am pushing you away, ron, because you're boring me to tears.
you're a fantastic doctor. You're a sucky date. Now, just scoot.
She's-she's the kinda girl when-it's go time when she makes up her, you know.
I just want to tell you in all my years of playing the field, this is the first time I've ever been replaced in the middle of a date.
no, no. I'm not replacing you. Nah.
no, it's-i'm a friend of hers. More like I'm a pinch-sitter.
you're the baseball player. - no.
right.
we're still on for my white blood cell count tomorrow?
so, that's the doc? - yes, the hot doc I was so desperate to have ask me out.
so, who's the baseball player? - I don't know. Eric somebody.
he said he played for one of the new york teams. - eric.
not derek. - yeah.
was his last name jeter? - yeah, that's it.
he was visiting some sick kids. He talked to me for what seemed like forever.
you talked to derek jeter? - I guess. I don't know.
I asked derek jeter to stop talking to me.
you asked - You asked derek jeter to stop talking to you?
it was just championship this, championship that.
he had a big giant girly ring on. Baseball, baseball, blah, blah, blah.
my god. - it never fails. The cute ones are just dull as milk.
speaking of which, is that what you're drinking these days?
what are you drinking? - van gogh vodka.
Really? Does it come with a severed ear in the bottom of the bottle?
you're making me laugh. - yeah. That's my job, right?
is this water? - yep.
well, here's to jeter.
so, what was the doc rambling on about?
meditation, tranquility, inner peace. - my god.
he thinks I'm still very, very angry and that it's not good for my immune system.
well, he's got to admit, you have a right to be angry given what's been going on.
Yeah. And he's right. I am angry.
I think you need forget this tranquility and peace bullshit.
I think you gotta go with your strengths, you know?
embrace the anger and pride.
and don't forget the other like wrath, resentment, you know, all that stuff.
I mean, you know? By the way, I'm an expert in all these particular areas. So, just so you know.
let's eat. - and drink.
and, brag. - and curse.
just remember, I can't do the drinking thing 'cause my sin quotient just goes through the roof.
when I drink I actually start inventing sins.
this place is terrifying. I'm just expecting maggie to jump out with a butcher knife.
well, if it isn't my 2 favorite whores!
no, not you two. - look at you.
what do you think? you look expensive.
but don't you think it's a little... - loose in the waist, I know.
the problem. I did a little dance. Got them to take it in free of charge.
which spa did you pick for the gift bags? Wait, don't say it. Let me guess-heaven.
no - the mandarin. It was the heaven. - I knew it.
did you hire that chick photographer I told you about?
of course I did. I did that. Because she has some very reasonable rates.
we're fine. - great. Great. there's just one problem though.
what's the, boo?
there is no spa called heavd en and the photographer's an old queen.
is that right? - hey, mike. hey, hey.
you didn't do any of the shit I asked you to do, did you? - come on, colleen.
I thought this was something you wanted to do. - it is.
then why aren't you doing shit?
maybe because I have nuts. - not for long.
she's really laying into him, huh? - yeah, sucks dude.
what are you doing? What's all this?
I don't know. I was picking that chick's brain over there and I got, like, inspired I guess.
what chick? Yowsa. That chick? - yeah. Emily. She works here.
Oh my god. She looks like the chick from the bridal magazine that
I was reading while I was taking a shit. Hey, you gonna try and bang her?
Nah, bro. I'm not in that mode right now.
what are you talking about? Getting laid mode? I didn't realize there was a not getting laid mode.
she's single. - how do you know that? You guys have a little girl chat?
I'm kidding. Come on. You're my best gay friend.
dude.
why don't you go talk to her, dude?
come on. No way. I haven't crossed the goal line in months.
I wouldn't even know what to say.
well, since she works in a bridal shop, right, so she's obviously sensitive.
and she's probably creative, right? And yeah, she's hot, dude.
but that doesn't make her any different than anybody else.
you just go over and you tell her that you're marrying off your friend and take it from there, dude.
right. That's a good call. All right.
sensitive. Creative. Happy. I'm going in.
you got like a mint or something?
no. - all right.
Hi!
how you doing? - can I help you with something?
no actually I'm just, you know, I'm
what do you call it. Looking around.
browsing?
Yeah. I'm browsing. That's what I'm doing. I'm browsing.
I just love-I love dress shops. I'm really
I'm kinda a sensitive guy, you know. Creative type.
I'm just so happy today because I'm marrying my friend over there.
that's great.
where are you two going to be doing it? Connecticut or vermont?
no we're going to do it right here in new york.
bold.
and who will be wearing the dress, you or him?
well, it's funny
my god! I'm so sorry.
that's ok.
that's not how it's supposed to go.
you know what? If you don't want to participate, then we can just wing it.
stop it, colleen. - no.
we can get married in a barn.
no. No. Would you just stop being ridiculous. All right, - because I came down- - hey, hey.
why don't we all just take a nice breath?
I'm going to speak to this young man for just a minute.
you better step up, shithead. - what are you talking about, man?
just shut up and listen. This isn't just about the wedding.
all this planning's got her mind on something productive and off the booze.
she loses focus, she'll be back on that bottle quicker than you can say interracial annulment. Now, get it together!
Hey, col. Look what I found.
my god. Is that an upsala?
Yes. With a double lace overlay and spaghetti straps.
Where'd you find it? it was tucked away behind a kenneth pool.
and it's only 750 because it was the last one in the store.
my god.
and you know I thought it would go great with this double tier veil and these heels.
my god. Michael, you're like some kind of wedding savant.
like a gay rainman.
Yeah. Instead of counting cards he counts cocks.
Hey, mike. I got her digits. - way to go.
dude, exactly like you said it. Talk to her like she was a real person and it worked.
What'd you say? - I have no idea.
but I'm pretty sure she thinks we're queer.
she's not alone.
Hey, you know what? Foot's in the door.
that's all that matters boys.
Michael, I love all this stuff.
Yeah, I guess I got like a knack for it, right?
Yeah.
would you maybe want to help us plan the rest of the wedding?
Yeah. I'd be honored. - that'd be amazing.
actually, you know, I was thinking, and you know,
I don't want to tell anybody what to do or anything, but maybe we could just, like, take this stuff and just use it for inspiration.
and we can design your dress together.
my god. Yes, let's do it.
let's do it. - cool!
my gosh. And uncle teddy,
I've been thinking and I want you to be the one who walks me down the aisle.
you serious? - of course I am.
don't you think your dad'll be disappointed?
don't you think he's blow it?
well, some guys watch football.
others design dresses. Who are we to judge?
fag.
sorry, I came up so short in the sin department.
one van gogh vodka and half a steak. Not very evil.
I thought I had more gas in the tank.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I think we made up for our lack of gluttony and sloth with our pure, unadulterated scorn for the rest of people in the restaurant.
not to mention the lying.
you kept on saying what a good time you were having.
I was having fun. I was having a blast.
Yeah. But there was something underneath it.
you weren't you're usual
do you want some water? - sure.
I'm finished with my treatment.
and they do some scans to find out if you're free and clear.
and I'm waiting for the results.
if they are not good, I have to start the chemo all over again, which would suck ass.
but you know what? I get to pick out a whole brand new set of tits, which is kind of exciting.
and I think I'm going to go bigger, which is weird 'cause I never really wanted big tits. And I'm not talking like pam anderson-2 midgets just moved into my chest big.
just a little bit-just a little bit bigger than my original ones.
and you know what? It's funny because I'm completely obsessed with other women's tits like I can't stop staring at them. Like everybody-the doctors, the nurses.
people walking down the street keep busting me, you know, checking out their rack.
and then one time I was in this plastic surgeon's office and this chick actually showed me her tits.
because she thought his work was really good.
and she wanted me to see, which she was right.
and so probably I am going to go with him.
do you believe in god?
sorry, I'm still kinda...
stuck on the chick showing you the tits.
I don't know if I can answer that question.
well, it's pretty simple really. Yes or no.
it's too complicated.
Yeah, I get it.
I mean, when I was a kid, I went to catholic school. It was very simple.
God is good. Satan is evil.
you obey the 10 commandments, you go to heaven.
and then when I was pregnant, I started to have a little more faith, you know, just in the world, in something bigger than me.
and I even started going back to church.
and I started picturing my daughter walking down the aisle in her white dress, making her first communion.
but you know how that story ends. So...
but you know when she died I did talk to the priest.
why she was taken.
and he said, he said it was a mystery.
like it was some big magic show, you know.
but at least I don't have to worry about leaving her behind on her own.
I mean, that must bug you, right?
what would happen to your kids.
don't you think about death all the time in your job?
no, not really. I mean, you can't.
you can't really think about that.
you run in. You run out.
run back in. You kinda have to do it hardcore.
balls to the wall.
you can't really think about death or god or any of that shit.
maybe it's easier then-not having a belief in some great beyond.
you know, maybe it all just fades to black.
I actually-I kinda I kinda believe in something.
like heaven? - no. Not heaven.
um, obviously I've had a lot of death.
my son and my cousin and all the guys I knew on 911.
and they-i- They
I've kinda heard from these guys.
how?
OK.
it's a little hard to explain. They...
kind of appear.
now, some of this happened while I was drinking.
but you know, I definitely
there's no question that they were, you know, they were here.
you know, it happened a lot. And it happened enough that sometimes there was something soothing about it.
and I just sort of liked the idea they were maybe in this-I don't know-like limbo.
they cancelled limbo and purgatory and sex with little boys-all the fun stuff.
I gotta smoke some weed and hit the hay.
OK.
so, do you feel better? - yeah.
after you leave, I'm going to drink a half a bottle of van gogh's vodka and wait for the ghost of my daughter to show up.
and if I die first, I promise to come back and haunt you if you even start drinking again.
that'd be a great reason to pick up.
nobody's dying anytime soon.
all right? All right.
see you later.
looking for these?
how'd you know? - ha ha. How'd I know?
first I noticed chocolate frosting on the pot handles.
then sprinkles. And then crumbs.
I mean, how could you, lou. After what franco had to say? After it took 5 guys for you to pass your physical.
stress makes me want cupcakes.
OK. How about another heart attack-what would that?
muffins. - really?
and death? - donuts.
look, my mom bought donuts after anybody in the family died, all right?
you gotta problem with that, talk her.
I mean, I gotta
I gotta problem with food. What do you want me to say?
I want you to say you're going to go on a diet.
I'll go on a diet. Now, give me my cupcakes.
no.
look, I heard what franco had to say, ok?
and he was right. I've been dragging the crew down.
and I feel responsible for this whole damien thing. I mean
it never would have happened unless I screwed up.
and I screwed up because I'm so goddamn out of shape.
and I feel like it's my fault.
all right, listen.
you wanna talk about fault.
faulty floor, faulty table saw, number 1. Number 2, you want to point fingers, I mean,
I'm the guy who convinced him to become a firefighter in the first place.
I talked him back on the rig.
all right, so that's-that's not what this is about.
I'm not blaming you, ok?
Yeah. - all right?
is that a mouse? - what?
Jesus, you
are you kidding- - no. I'm not kidding.
sit down. Sit down!
unbelievable. Grown man.
I don't even know where to begin with you. I really don't.
We-could you look at me, please, when I'm talking to you?
I mean, this is- You really-eyes.
I can't. I can't with these right in front of my face.
it's like having a plate of tits on the table.
I think to most normal people, if you said, ok, me vs. You
we gotta guy who's got a giant eating disorder vs. A guy that takes way too many chances in fires, which guys is more likely to die first.
hands down you.
you're 40 pounds overweight. - you're a maniac.
you can't walk up 3 flights of stairs without gasping for breath.
you can sprint up 3 flights of stairs into a burning room with no mask on for the sheer rush of it.
I'm about to ask you to do what might be the biggest favor as my best friend
no.
you haven't even heard what I was going to ask you
I'm hungry.
I want you to be the godfather to my new kid.
Yeah. That got your attention didn't it?
all the other kids are spoken for.
between nicky and teddy and maggie and janet's family. And I just
I want to make sure with the new kid that if I don't come home from work one night that he or she has a backup dad.
I don't know what to say.
just say you'll go on a diet, lou.
if you want do it for yourself, do it for me.
your best friend. Do it for me. Do it for the kid.
can I have one last cupcake?
do we have a deal?
I'm going in to take a nap.
when I wake up, if there's a cupcake on the table, I know I have a partner.
if not, I know I don't.
hyman roth from "godfather ii"? - yep.
Jimmy was dedicated.
he was tough, you know.
he was a firefighter's firefighter, kinda guy who always had your back.
like many new york city firefighters, jimmy keefe loved his job even more because of where it happened-in the world's busiest city, in the biggest department in the fire service, in one of f. d.n. y.'s busiest houses.
you know, I thank god that he ended up in this house.
cause he was a rock.
he was a real go-to guy.
and a hell of an athlete.
let me tell you something, when that bell rang, he was the first to go.
on 911 jimmy did what he always did.
he ran in hard and fast looking for someone to save.
the only difference that day was, he didn't come out.
he taught me everything I know about being a fireman.
he was good about it too.
he never talked down to a new guy.
you can break a kid's spirit that way.
but whatever, he didn't do that.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
him and tommy gavin, when I first came in the house, they were tough.
I mean, they hold you accountable to all your actions in a burn.
but at the same time, they make sure you know how to do things the right way.
I wouldn't be sitting in this chair talking to you right now if it wasn't for jimmy keefe, I'll tell you that.
Jimmy-he saved my life several times over just by what he taught me.
a dedicated family man, jimmy keefe spent almost every hour away from the firehouse with his wife and child.
every spare minute he had he as at home.
I knew how much he loved the job.
every firefighter's wife knows that.
or at least they should.
he was so present and involved with the baby and damien's schoolwork and little league, pee-wee hockey.
I just never had to wonder where he was.
he was either with us or at work.
those are the only 2 places he ever was.
he loved her. He loved that kid.
he loved the job.
end of story.
so, you can see what we're after here. This is just a taste of course.
we're still missing a lot of footage. And this is just a rough cut.
but this is the fabric of the piece. - camera's up.
whenever you're ready. - ok.
look, don't be nervous. - I'm not nervous.
let me see your hair. - what?
don't get nervous when the lights get turned on.
Yeah. - what do you mean?
well, some people freak out when the lights get turned on. They get all jittery.
I'm not. - I don't know about that.
I mean, I got a little jittery myself when I did my interview.
you did? - a little bit. Yeah, I did.
I got those jangles. - you got jangles?
what the hell is a jangle? - it's like a twitch.
it goes away. - the jitters or the jangles?
because- - all right, I'm going.
how do I look? - you look great.
do this. - Do this.
you're good. - don't sweat.
right here?
you good? - yep.
rolling.
you and jimmy keefe.
you were cousins, best friends, brothers in the brotherhood.
Yeah.
you went through the academy together.
you got assigned to this house together.
you arrived down at the world trade center together on that fateful morning.
Yes. - you went in together.
Yeah.
we all know what happened that day.
how it began.
how it progressed.
how it ended.
Jimmy became a hero.
343 men became heroes, some of whom had their flaws.
what would you change if we could go back in time, what would you change that morning?
what would have been a happy ending that day?
there are no happy endings.
all right, remember emily from the dress shop? Superhot chick?
we had the most amazing sex I have ever had in my entire life.
afterwards, you know, we're just layin' there when out of nowhere, the entire place reeks like a sewer in a bad neighborhood.
well, listen, chief. I've been thinkin'.
I wanna be a lieutenant. - You ace that text.
I'll call downtown, make sure you're assigned to a top house in the city.
just keep your nose clean and your mouth shut till it happens.
nose clean. Mouth shut. No problem.
Pam keppler. - Hi. Nice to meet you.
this is the news chick. - For what?
the jimmy thing.
look, tommy, they're doin', like, a 9/11 tenth-anniversary special thing, ok?
Oh, really? What's their angle, huh, franco?
is it the 9/11 conspiracy? Is that their angle?
how about maybe that I slept with my cousin's wife?
is that what they're goin' for?
there's been a lot of controversy since 9/11 involving the fdny-alcohol and drug abuse...
allegations of racism in the department's hiring practices, allegations of sexism, that the department is nothing but a big boys club run amok.
Ah, it's not what I agreed to talk about here.
you seem upset. - You know what?
next time your house catches on fire or somebody in your family gets hurt or whatever, you know what? Instead of callin' us, call a [beep] garbage truck.
I'm done.[beep] You.[beep] You.[beep] You.
Hey. What's up?
picked this up on the way to work this morning.
seen 'em? "effin' dny.
garbage MOUTH " the "daily news.
yeah?
what's "newsday" got to say?
mother of 6 wins lotto.
now, if she was blowin' a-rod, maybe we wouldn't be in the papers.
heat's not only gonna hit us hard, uh, it's already here.
Aw, shit.
look, the only thing we could salvage was the 9/11 charity game.
they're gonna let you play in the tenth-anniversary cops-versus-firefighters event game because of the money that the charity can raise.
it's all we could arrange, kiddo.
you're lucky you got that.
kick the cops' asses, by the way, 'cause that's the last ass you're gonna be kickin' for a while.
what's that supposed to mean?
upstairs, guys. Come on. I ain't got all day.
sorry, tommy.
king joey iii. - What's going on, man?
ain't here as your old pal joey, tom.
I'm here as the department rep.
firefighter gavin, my name is supervisor balsbaugh.
you are hereby informed of a 30-day suspension from duty as of 8 a. m. Today.
Really?
all right, what? I gotta sign this or something?
cause I'm kind of in a rush, guys.
we're gonna need your badge, your bunker jackets, your official department i. d., tom.
all right, I don't even know where my official i. d. Is. I mean, listen.
my-my kid, I gotta take my kid to a dance class.
can I drop this stuff off - at headquarters later? - Now.
we need it now, all of it.
OK, ballsby. Just relax.
names balsbaugh. Balsbaugh.
let's go. Badge, bunker jackets, i. d. Now.
you dug your own hole here, tom.
it's a deep one.
got it.
we escort you in and out, asshole.
at any time you wanna enter the firehouse, you need a rep from my office and a rep from the union to lead you inside, right the hell back outside.
policy, pal. Airtight.
OK, you wanna slap a pair of cuffs on me, too?
what I hear, that's not exactly foreign territory for you.
you're funny.
Ah, cover up, guys. We got company.
what's going on?
well, guys. This is, uh, king joey iii here.
how are you?
came up with me and, uh, jimmy keefe. I guess he's down at hq now.
he's got 3 tits, thus the name.
you wanna show 'em, joey?
you still got the third tit, right? It's funny.
the third tit, it's kind of weird, too.
it's kind of like a- a midget tit.
Oh, and this is inspector ballpeen?
balsbaugh. - Bal-baldspot?
Yeah, ok. Anyways, you know, you guys both know what I said on tv, a lot of it was true in your heart of hearts, as firemen, which is what you used to be before you started wearing your sunday best to work, you know.
look, guys, I'm out for, like, 30 days.
and apparently every time I come in here now,
I gotta have 2 jerk-offs who haven't fought fires in, like, 15 years to escort me.
hope you got-oh, yeah.
here's my i. d. Says, "firefighter" right on it.
that's what I do, fight fires and save people.
you remember people.
they're the ones whose taxes are payin' for your lincoln town cars, silk ties, and your fancy goddamn computers.
what gavin was talking about is department policy.
anyone aiding and abetting his unsupervised entry into this firehouse over the next 30 days will face the firm guarantee of suspension and possible fine.
any questions? - Yeah.
Yes, lieutenant? - I'm tryin' to figure something out.
it's a technical question, really, but the third tit, the midget tit, did it come with a little midget nipple?
let's go, gavin.
what? It's a perfectly legitimate question.
Oh, franco, what's up, man?
Aw, what's the matter, franco? We're being disrespectful to them?
Hey, it is what it is.
Tommy gavin is officially down for the count.
I guess now we'll find out what this crew is like without its major wonder boy, huh?
should be entertaing.
you know, a lieutenant friend of mine from the east side said that news chick, she's been sniffin' around about tommy's personal life and everybody else's, too, so thanks to tom, every single piece of dirt attached to every goddamn guy in this house is now officially up for grabs.
good times, huh?
one down. 5 to go, fellas.
Yeah.
Bye-bye, douche bags.
all right, fellas, the jig is officially up.
what's that mean?
that means those suits just told me that pam keppler's news van's been parked outside of hq already twice this week.
her next big news story is to jump into tommy's personal life whole hog.
of course.
and anybody else who stepped out of line in the past 10 years.
great. Thanks, tom.
hq's droppin' the hammer, fellas.
I don't have to tell you she starts pointin' her bony little fingers around, a lot of 'em are gonna be pointed right at us.
nobody tried to talk to this crazy broad?
you know, scare tactics?
it's not gonna work, lou. She's got a hard-on for us.
Tommy, look. You gotta lay low, all right?
listen to me. No bullshit this time.
needles, I'm not afraid of her, ok?
she can bring whatever she wants.
like I said- - you're not listening to me.
I'm listening to you.
it's not just about you, asshole.
we have our careers on the line here. All right?
she starts diggin' around your shit, how hard you think that's gonna be?
it's buried under a patch of fresh earth.
would you please think about us for once?
Lou. - I married a hooker.
he married a hooker. I married a russian mail-order bride.
uh, I married maggie.
which I'm bankin' on makes the hooker and the mail-order bride seem a little sensible.
I'm marrying colleen.
which is gonna make marrying maggie look like a day at the beach.
no offense, tommy. - None taken.
Yeah, well, I guess I could be considered a deadbeat dad.
and a conspiracy freak. - My gayness.
the whole nun thing. - Lesbo girlfriend.
extreme gayness. - You wanna know what's sad?
him being gay is the least of our public relations problem.
Yeah, unless they find out that I blew a guy down at headquarters once.
Yeah, unless they find out that he blew a guy down at headquarter
Mike, you blew a guy from headquarters, or you blew a guy at headquarters?
both. - Thank you, god in heaven, - for this wonderful gift. - Wait a second. What guy?
I don't rember his name, dude.
how could you not know his name? - We were drinking.
drinking at headquarters? - No, no.
no, first at a christmas party that was at a place, like, near headquarters, but then we went back to his office at hq, and
and he put some moves on me, and I took my shirt off and- ohh!
stop, mike. Just-just stop.
guys, it wasn't cheap, you know?
this makes it sound cheap, and it-and it wasn't.
Doug. That was his name, doug.
good. Doug. How many dougs can there be?
could be a lot of dougs. - Yeah. Doug flutie.
michael douglas. - Doogie howser, m. d.He was a doug.
michael douglas doesn't count as a doug, mike.
Yeah, he's a michael, mike. - Not a doug.
Mike. - No, no, no, no. No, no.
the doug that I blew looked like
like a young, studly, in-shape michael douglas type guy.
and he had a nice ass.
OK, I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this.
Mike, do you think you can recognize the ass again?
Yeah, sure. - Shut up.
this is good, perfect, good.
Lou, I need you to get on the computer.
find out how many dougs are workin' down at hq.
we'll see if you can bring up pictures of 'em, ok?
good-looking pictures of michael douglas type dougs. Got it.
are you guys really gonna go through with this?
Hey, our asses are on the line here, pal.
Yeah, pam keppler, all her tv news cronies, not to mention the, you know, news reporters, the newspapers, they're gonna crush us with this.
Aw, jesus christ.
I say we hit 'em now while we got the muscle.
Frank pentangelo. - "godfather ii.
I didn't know you could do that impression. - You never asked.
he's got video on there, too, tom.
take her down, all right? She's a hypocrite and a cokehead, and she's callin' you out?
guys, this is awesome.
I'm-I don't know what to say.
I owe you guys.
we're not doin' this for you, tom, ok?
we're doin' this for our brother, johnny. Ok?
you think we want his good name stomped on by some tv coke slut?
let me tell you somethin'. As good as a fireman you're supposed to be...
your brother johnny was 10 times a better cop.
all right, so you take this stuff, tom, and you go ruin that broad, all right?
just make sure johnny's name doesn't get mentioned. Ok?
what? - Take this.
who the hell called the cops? - I did.
you guys are gettin' your asses kicked in there.
I figured you could use some backup.
another ginger ale, tom?
no.
what's goin' on? - I am so sick of this!
OK, i'm sick of all of it!
just get out of my way!
what the-what's goin' on? - You ruined the wedding, dad.
you've ruined it, and everyone at school's making fun of me because my dad gave the middle finger in the paper!
jeez. What the hell's
what's happening?
hello.
you gonna bring him up to speed, or...
OK, the new place that shawn and colleen were looking at for their wedding, they saw that the last name was gavin, that you're the firefighter who's been in all t papers, and- and they told them both to take a hike.
no, it was 2 places, ok?
the second place, we lied and told them that you weren't my father, and then they found out anyway. And you know what?
right now, I really wish you weren't.
Hey, colleen. That's enough.
Hey, you know what? You come out here right now, and you apolo
holy shi-wait. What- Whoa!
what the hell?
you- colleen, get your ass out here and clean this mess up.
go to hell! I hate you, daddy!
please let me pay for the wedding and let me get one of those other places.
no, sheila. No. How many times do I have to tell you? No.
wow, wow, wow. Calm down.
I'm just tryin' to help you, so
well, does it look like it's helping? No. You are making things worse.
OK, can I just ask a question? Ok?
are you guys all lance armstronging?
Oh, you- I'm just asking, ok?
what's go-what's the place? What are you talking about? Whatce place?
I'm talking about- There's a place in jersey near where I take damian for his german aquatherapy.
then there's a place in connecticut near where I take him for his movement therapy.
they are both mansions... - Mansions.
they are both gorgeous, and they're both expensive.
I want to pay. I wanna pay for the whole thing, ok?
no one's gonna know out there that your face was all over the papers, and besides which, colleen and mike have changed their minds about mike designing the dress, because he has come across a dress that he
and I'm quoting-says, "is to die for.
OK, tommy, I do not want her to pay for our daughter's wedding, especially when she is not even gonna be involved.
Oh, my god. - Yeah. Ask her.
Wha-what?
how many times do I have to tell you I want her to be in the wedding?!
Yes, and she has made it abundantly clear that she does not want to be in the wedding if your uncle mickey is involved, and your uncle mickey deserves to be in the wedding, right?
do you want me to start drinking again? Is that what you guys want?
I've never asked you guys for anything, and now auntie sheila wants to help.
OK, I don't understand what the problem is!
I can't afford the kind of wedding that you want.
we can't even afford the dress.
Tommy, tell her.
mom, I don't want colleen to drink anymore.
Oh, no one's gonna drink anymore.
OK, sheila, you know what? I can handle my own kids, ok?
OK.
OK, no one is gonna drink anymore.
Oh, wow. That was so much better. - Watch your mouth.
you know what? I need a drink.
Oh, no, you do not. Oh, no, no, no!
what the hell?
you gotta be shittin' me.
nobody's gonna drink, ok?
everybody calm down.
how much money we talkin' about? - 8 grand.
for the wedding? - For the dress.
I need a whiskey. - No! No, no, no, no!
what's he trying to tell us?
probably that he wants to be put up for adoption.
Katy, colleen, take him into his room.
let's go. Hurry up. - And clean up that mess.
you two, sit down. I wanna talk to you right now.
hurry it up, girls.
Really?
OK.
I am sick and tired of being treated like a ghost around here, ok?
you wanna start talkin' about, you know, uh, father figures.
well, I ain't no figure.
I'm the real deal, and i'm gonna lay some, uh, new laws down around here, ok?
first of all, sheila is gonna be a part of that wedding.
done deal.
and she's gonna need somebody to walk her down the aisle, because god knows damian ain't gonna do it.
listen to me.
you been sold a bill of goods by a serious of snake-oil salesmen, ok?
nobody's had the balls to say this to you, but I just got my balls back, so I'm gonna say it.
Mickey was right.
the kid is as is, all right?
he ain't ever gettin' out of that wheelchair again.
So-ah-ah! Sit down.
you're in that wedding, and mickey's gonna be in that wedding.
and you can wipe that little smirk off your face, sweetheart, 'cause I got some news for you, too.
Sheila is paying for that wedding.
and we're-ah-ah!
listen, you wanna see colleen passed out shitfaced again on the beach somewhere?
can you put a price tag on her sobriety? I don't think so.
so we're takin' sheila's money, and colleen's gonna have the greatest day in the history of all the days that she's ever gonna have.
that's what we're doin'.
and I'm gonna pay back all that money, every single penny of it. You can bet your pretty little asses on that.
Yay.
Oh. Oh, come on in, girls.
join the party.
maybe you'll learn a thing or two.
all right, this is a dysfunctional family. I know.
call the newspapers. There's a headline for you.
it's a family full of drunks and drug addicts and liars and cheaters and stealers. Ok?
we've lied and cheated and stole our way around each other for god knows how long, and-and where did we end up?
Where'd it get us? Nowhere.
Yeah, that's right. Nowhere. Right back here where we-where we started.
that's where we ended up, where we all belong.
now, some people would t say that the truth will set you free.
the truth is-you know, the truth will cleanse you and-and elevate your spirit.
I say that the truth can kiss our lying irish asses, because I'll tell you somethin'. The truth will be used by the enemy, the outside world, as ammunition against us.
and believe me, they're gettin' ready to do exactly that, but I have a secret evil plan that plays to our strengths...
a plan that involves lying and- And cheating and stealing.
you know, they're always sayin', the media's always talkin' about, you know, tv and-and the magazines and everything, that sex sells.
well, we are gonna sell them right down the goddamn river.
listen.
please believe me when I say that you need to accept the fact that damian is never getting out of that wheelchair, and I'm telling you this-because I love you.
and as much as I love her,
I love you even more.
all right, girls. I want this place cleaned up by the time I get back, spic and span.
Sheila, outside. I'm gonna give you your assignment now.
I'm gonna go pick up my godson from that god-awful aromatherapy bullshit class.
till then, toodles.
hold it up. Up.
Oh. Move.
Ah, I am so glad that you decided to do this.
it'll give you a chance to tell your side of the story, give us-let us experience the emotional side of 9/11 and its aftermath
thank you.
are you ready?
I think I need some- Some water. - Yes.
water! Water, please.
I-I changed my mind.
rolling.
so after your husband's death, after they found only his finger in the wreckage and rubble at ground zero, did you find yourself turning to certain family members for healing to deal with the grief and the anguish?
do you mean tommy? - Yes.
uh, did you find yourself turning to his brother in arms, his best friend, and his cousin, tommy gavin?
hell, yeah.
baby, I banged his brains out.
we had mad, insane, explosive sex almost every single time we put our hands on each other, and you wanna know why?
because we could.
sometimes we had angry sex, sometimes we had happy sex, and sometimes we had "atom bomb going off in the apartment" sex, but one thing was always certain, and that was every single time tommy was inside of me,
I never thought about my dead hero husband.
I just enjoyed the ride.
I even have some video.
you know, 'cause when tommy and I had sex, we did it because we really-we needed it desperately.
you know, we- We hungered for it.
and it was a pretty honest transaction, because we got what we wanted out of each other, you know, kind of just like this.
Yeah, pam. Aw, suck it. Suck it.
Yeah. Go, pam- whoa, whoa, whoa.
sit down, big mouth.
and when I say, "big mouth,
I think we all know how big it is now, don't we?
sit down.
you drop that story, or I swear to christ that'll end up on youtube.
yeah? What's that you guys say now?
that's a wrap?
Bye.
hello. Uh, I have an appointment, uh, with supervisor balsbaugh in lieutenant hanrahan's office.
I'm a little late. - They're waiting for you.
come on in. This is supervisor balsbaugh.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
lieutenant hanrahan is, uh, 2 seconds away.
how you doing?
you know, joey, I've been better.
you know, we thought we saw you down there talkin' to that news station.
you know, it's a terrible mess they started here.
I'm sorry about all this, - and I hope you told her what's what. - Let's cut to the chase here, mrs. Keefe.
I didn't know your husband personally, but I know who he was, what he did for his country on that fateful day.
his record is the reason we agreed to sit and talk to you.
we owe him that. We owe you that anytime you desire it.
but let's be clear here.
this whole business ain't about your husband.
it's about your boyfriend.
he's a scourge, a stain on this department, and if you think comin' down here and pleading his case is gonna change anything, guess again. He's out for 30 days, and if I had my way, maybe forever.
I'm dead serious, Mrs. Keefe.
so am i.
Oh, lieutenant hanrahan.
Yes. Welcome, Mrs. Keefe.
I- I saw you on the tv.
Oh, I know. Your friends call you doug, right?
uh, that's right. Feel free to do the same.
OK, dougie boy. Dougie doug.
it's hot in here.
I, um- I need a drink.
um, those flowers there are from mike siletti at 62 truck.
you remember him, right?
he has a little birthmark, a little brown birthmark kind of like the one that you have on your cheek, except that his is on his ass.
sexy.
do you guys- I'm sorry. No?
bouncy. Good for you.
isn't having booze in here against department regulations?
but then again, so is having sex in here after hours.
yeah?
Mike said something about
wait a minute.
you're not a policeman, are you?
Hey. What happened?
operation oral sex is officially over.
balsbaugh told dougie doug to clean out his desk once he saw the cuffs and the bar, and keppler has left me 2 messages offering me cash to burn the video.
you, my dear, are back on duty.
you know, we should be, uh-we should be workin' for, um, tmz.
right. Secrets and lies.
good old-fashioned american way.
how's my kid? - He's good.
and he smells good, which is one of the, uh, few benefits we're getting from that aromatherapy class.
smells like pizza.
actually, that's me. I-I smell like pizza.
Hey, uh, sheel... - Yes.
um, you know, I owe you big time for this.
no. No, I did this for us.
I did this for all of us.
for the brotherhood? - No, silly, for the gavins.
Hey, asshole, this is the ladies' room.
what the fuck are you doing, dickhead? Get the fuck out of here.
if you don't get your ass out of here, I'm gonna start screaming.
understand?
Oh, God, please!
what the fuck?
what the hell? What the fuck? Get off...
grandpa used to say...
...everybody's got their own private demon.
for him, it was the war he fought in Vietnam.
for Grandma, I guess it was Grandpa...
...and all the shit he put her through.
for my mom and dad...
...What's their private demon?
I guess that'd be me.
you'll wake them. God.
get in. - Jess.
you're an asshole. - I love you too.
say goodbye to Texas. - Goodbye, Texas.
what the hell is that?
I won it riding when I was 11.
it's good luck.
I bet your mom gave it to you. - So fucking what?
don't take it down.
you're not calling your parents. - But I wanna call them.
Jesus, you don't.
they'll worry. - That's the fucking point.
I don't want them to worry.
that's exactly your fucking problem.
you don't run away from home, then tell your parents you're okay.
why not?
they'll talk you out of it. That's why.
see, it's the manager who watches out for your ass.
because you take the wrong part, you get typecast, you're dead.
fuck you.
you're getting typecast again. Stop.
Yes!
every actor has to do a nude scene at least once.
Yeah, right. - Right.
any nude scene you do...
...better be with me.
okay, then. - Okay, then.
so you wanna do a nude scene?
okay.
Oh, is it ready? - Yeah.
it's ready. Yeah, it's ready.
Oh, Nic.
no, don't take the blanket.
it's fucking cold out there. - Well, tough shit.
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
fuck.
I understand, man.
it's cool.
Yeah. Okay.
see you.
What'd he say?
when we get to L. A. we're not gonna stay with my cousin.
why not? - It's his wife.
she's sick or something.
they don't really have the room. - Well, where are we gonna live?
I'll figure something out. - Figure something out?
I'm not gonna be a fucking homeless person.
don't worry, okay? - God.
just don't worry.
great. Damn. - What are you doing?
Nicole, what are you doing?
you wanna be a fucking baby your whole life?
son of a bitch. - Jess, come on. Please, don't.
Hey!
asshole! - Jesse, let's just go.
let's go! - Fuck!
you okay?
it's okay. Come here.
you okay, huh? Come here, it's over.
I don't even see this road. It's not on the map.
we're still heading west. It'll be faster.
not if we run out of gas.
I'll take care of it. - Right. We're lost.
no, we're not. - Yes, we are.
who's being the fucking baby now?
I gotta pee.
again? - Yes, again.
all right. I'll pull over. - I'm not gonna pee in the dirt.
why the hell not? - There's snakes out there.
and it doesn't make me a fucking baby. Just find a bathroom.
this is nice. - I told you to pee in the dirt.

thank you so much for giving me a ride.
quite a hot day today. A real scorcher.
look, you really saved me. I mean, this guy...
hot night too.
we don't often get those here.
nights are usually colder than a well-digger's...
well, you know.
can I...? Can I use your phone? I gotta call the police.
know what I do sometimes on a hot night?
probably shouldn't say it in front of the boys.
sometimes...
...I slip into the ladies' room and I'll slip off my control tops.
I think this guy has my boyfriend.
I... Look, I really need to call the police.
one summer, our little fridge broke down.
Oh, everything melted. You couldn't imagine the mess.
raspberry popsicles all over.
listen... - Looked like blood.
you saw what happened.
we didn't see anything.
no, I'm talking about the truck. That yellow truck.
that guy tried to kill me.
we don't know anything about a yellow truck.
what are you talking about?
it was right in front of you. He totaled our car.
so where are you guys from?
where do you think?
so you move from place to place. It must be nice.
is there somebody back there?
is that Jess?
is that him? Is that my boyfriend?
Oh, my God. - Mind your own business.
don't you dare look.
Jesse? Jess, is that you?
don't you dare!
Jess! - Don't you dare!
Jesse. Jess- Don't let her get to him! Get her away!
Oh, my God.
don't let her get to him! Get her away from him!
get her away from him! Bring her back here.
you fucking whore! Who do you think you are?
leave Scotty alone.
sorry. - You'll get what you deserve.
everything you deserve, you fucking whore.
my boyfriend, Jess... I thought... I think he's hurt and I thought...
you thought? You thought you were free?
free to do as you please.
free to sin as you please.
let me tell you, missy... - You whore!
...the Lord sees all. - You fucking whore!
he see your filthy, disgusting ways. - You whore!
you whore! - And he sent his angels.
his angel of punishment to exact his vengeance.
stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
read your Bible, little missy.
and Moses, upon reaching heaven..came upon the Lord's angels of punishment.
af, the angel of anger.
Kezef, the angel of wrath.
Hemah, the angel of fury.
Mashhit, the angel of destruction.
these were the seraphim.
the fire angels sent by the Lord to smite the sinner.
to scorch their souls.
you're so fucking crazy.
shut up, you whore!
you fucking whore!
you whore!
fucking assholes!
what a bunch of weirdoes.
God.
and that kid in the back, what a freak.
stupid camera. Jesus Christ.
he followed me. I don't know why.
september, 1992.
KZL 303 after me. '86.
he's gonna kill me. 1971.
it's gonna be okay.
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you.

hey?
Hello?
is somebody there?
are you okay?
Oh, my God.
what's your name?
Tracy.
Tracy Kress.
I'm Nicole.
don't worry, okay? I'm gonna get you out of there.
How...?
how long have I been in here?
I don't know.
he must have done it when I was off with those assholes.
who?
there's this guy stalking me.
he drives a yellow truck... - Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
please keep him away! Don't let him in! Oh, God!
it's okay. He's not here right now.
he's got my boyfriend somewhere.
on the bus. He's got him on the bus.
what are you talking about? - The driver, he's got this place.
that's where he took me. That's where I woke up.
he kept me there...
...for, I don't know, hours?
days?
fuck. - Years?
what did he do? - Oh, God.
God. Oh, God.
what does he want?
I don't know.
I don't know.
he told me I got what I deserved.
what does that mean?
all I know is, my mom used to say the same thing...
...when I had done something wrong.
you'll get what you deserve.
maybe I shouldn't have done it.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm so sorry.
Tracy, what did you do?
I stole some money from my momma's purse.
not a lot. Like 50 bucks.
I wanted to see the Stones.
the Rolling Stones. They were playing in Tucson.
I never made it.
did he...?
Oh, God.
Oh, God! Now he's back!
he's back. He's coming.
Tracy, quiet.
he's coming! Please!
don't let him in, please!
don't let him in, please.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

I'm gonna make sure, okay?
Hey!

what did you do with Jess?
you fucking pervert! Get the fuck out of here!
No!
don't let him in.
Oh, don't let him in. Don't let him in.
he'll be back.
the driver, he always comes back.
we'll be long gone before then.
he'll find us.
he'll take us to the bus.
Tracy...
...how did you get away from there?
how'd you escape?
I don't know.
you must have escaped somehow. He's not Superman.
he's not human.
I thought a lot about it...
...when he was doing me.
the only thing I could do to keep from just dying was to wonder.
how could anybody...?
how could any real person do this?
so I realized...
...he wasn't real.
he wasn't a person like you or me.
he had to be some kind of monster.
Tracy.
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
I've got clothes in my car you can put on, then we're gonna start walking.
he'll find us. - No, he won't.
he'll take us to the bus.
look, I'll get you out of here. I promise.
Oh, God.
I will get you out here.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'll get you out of here, okay? I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay?

you know, he was...
...riding it all around the house last night. He was...
...hitting the little siren that dings.
it was like:
that thing was driving me nuts.
I told him to be quiet.
I yelled at him, made him cry.
it was a fucked-up thing, Nicole.
you say something so fucking stupid like that.
you know, it ends up being your last words.
Hey. You're not gonna die, okay? - Stop it.
I'm lucky enough to be just breathing right now.
you gotta do me a favor, okay? You gotta take my badge...

when I was training for the service...

there's no way you'd go to California just for me.
you're full of shit.

all right, well, there's some weirdness with the smoking ordinance at the casinos.
um, just some of the employees there
I'm sorry. That may be a good opportunity for an editorial.
the Indian gaming laws and the responsibilities and so on.
and while we're on the subject, Ralph, you know, if you don't mind...
I was thinking that maybe we could, um, assign one of my guys maybe...
to do something about the NFL draft, the politics involved and
no, that's good. I like that. Then, um
and then my sports guys can do an editorial on global warming.
Oh, come on. This is serious. No, I mean it.
guys, guys. You're up, Jo.
well, the mayor's coming out in favor of the, um, convention coming here.
so, um, so there's gonna be a press conference later.

I have a budget for a stringer, I guess.
well, I think it might be nice to do a draft followup. Yeah, sure.
good.
Hey, boss. We got a little buried today, huh?
what are you talking about? TheJermaine fight I covered.
it was a good fight. Oh, yeah. I buried it, right.
Why? Something's got to get buried.
well, that's what high school wrestling is for, right?
I mean, it's a solid story. Not a fact missing.
you had copy 40 minutes after the fight.
Yeah, you're like a machine. All the style of one too.
wait a minute, Ralph. Do you mind sitting?
now, listen. I appreciate what you're doing, filling my pages.
and I don't want you to stop.
Hey, Ralph? Sorry for interrupting.
do you want me to email you those quotes?
Yeah, yeah, right. But your copy, it's unimpressive.
a lot of typing, not much writing.
well, Sam Kirby liked. He doesn't work here anymore.
the truth is... I forget your pieces while I'm reading them.
now, if this is the best you can do, I'm not gonna complain.
but I know you can do a lot better.
why is that, Ralph?
because of your name.
thanks for the talk. Oh, look, come on.
look. Don't get like a chick on me, all right? Be a man.
recognize your weaknesses and fix 'em.
slow down a bit, you know? Think quality.
I got it. Got an appointment.
we write it like this.
what the lawsuit is calling for is an order to force the E. P.A...
to reassign its approval over the water standards...
for the rivers affected by the development.
Mmhmm. Wyoming and Montana are going to join as interveners.
okay.
Hey, was that you calling last night? Yeah, yeah, it was.
sorry about that.
Hey, did you read the article Jermaine fight?
Yeah. It was good.
it was, wasn't it? Very solid.
Yeah, solid. Exactly. Metz hated it. Of course.
what didn't he like?
what does Metz
what does Metz ever like? I don't know. He wasn't specific.
you know, he's never going to let me write...
on the Broncos or the Nuggets.
well, maybe Metz will come around.
it doesn't really matter because, um, I'm having lunch with Whitley.
today.
I might have a shot at the magazine.
that's great. Yeah, it is.
that is great. Nothing certain yet, but it seems pretty positive.
that's fantastic. Yep.
does Metz know?
are you serious? What are you on?
no, Metz doesn't know.
Hey, I was wondering if I could shoot some hoops with Teddy this afternoon.
you know, Teddy's only gonna get used to this...
if we stick on the schedule that we agreed on.
we're separated, okay?
it's easy for you to say. You haven't had your son cleaved from you.
all right, all right. A little overdramatic. Sorry.
sorry, I'm just
ball's in the play box in the garage.
thank you. Thank you.
talk to Metz. Sure.
so, um, listen, I was, uh I was sorry to hear about your old man.
Mmm. Thank you.
it was cancer, right?
Yeah. Uh, here.
hmm. Of all places.
ironic, right? Yeah. We got the iced teas coming?
Mmhmm, sure. Thank you.
look, we've read your stuff, Fred Roselle and I.
and I'm sorry to say, it's just not there.
not yet anyway.
the consensus was that it lacked personality.
exactly.
I mean, Bing, last year, under Kirby, I had 1 92 bylines.
that's the most of any reporter in the history of the newspaper.
you say my stuff is thin? Of course it is.
a lot of typing, no writing. I don't have time.
and this year, I have a new editor. So I keep an open mind.
and guess what? He's working me even harder than Kirby was.
I mean, he thinks I'm a machine.
anytime I bring in a story with just an ounce of heart,
Metz spikes it.
I mean, this is stuff that I think that the magazine should have magazine deserves.
okay, give me an example.
is that the mango?
it's not the peach? No, it's the mango.
sorry. I'm sorry. Give me an example.
I mean, there's I have so many. But sometimes I feel blocked.
I'm not very good at this.
no, no, no. Just anything. Just give me an example.
um, crossroads. Uh, Elway.
you know, what does he do now at this point in his life?
maybe he runs for governor.
I get that one proposed and rejected twice a week.
people don't want to hear about their heroes aging.
okay, okay. Well, then what about Coors Field?
the worst place to pitch. The worst place to pitch in America.
uh, strikin' out.
well, there's this boxer. An exheavyweight contender.
he's, uh, living on the streets of Denver.
he's living in the trash. Yeah?
Yeah. And, you know, he kind of patrols the neighborhood. He calls himself the Champ.
he's a He's a lovely guy.
and the story, it's beautiful. It's touching.
but I tell Metz about it, and he says, " Forget about it.
it's a dry hole. Go cover theJermaine fight. "
what's his name, the, uh the boxer?
Satterfield.
Bob Satterfield?
Yeah. Bob. Wow.
are you sure? My dad used to idolize that guy. I thought he was dead.
he. No, he's dead. hat's what everybody thinks.
and that's why I think that this story is such a great story.
I want to call it "Resurrecting the Champ. "
and he's here in Denver? Yeah.
Bob Satterfield? I saw him yesterday.
what are your plans for this?
well, I thought maybe I'd take my time.
you know, really work well on it, work hard. Think quality.
and see if I can get Metz to come around.
well, if, uh
if you can't bring him around, I'd be glad to take a look at it.
well, that'd be great. That'd be terrific.
when he won in California, it was already too late.
mondale had already had enough delegates.
um, no, I think so.
uh, November 30 I don't have an exact date. I can find one.
Hey. One second. Okay.
no, I'll get it for you and I'll Okay. Bye.
Hey. Hey. How's it goin'?
great. Can you keep a secret, Molly?
can you? Sure.
can you? Sure.
my name's not Molly.
Yes, that's true. 'Cause it's Millie, right?
Polly. Polly.
close. Yeah. What can I do for you?
uh, well, I'm doing a story on a heavyweight fighter...
from the 1 950s named Bob Satterfield.
but, um, nobody can know about it.
you're moonlighting. It's none of Metz's business.
you got it. Yeah.
what do you need?
well, um, there wasn't much on him on the Internet.
so I guess you're gonna have to go old school on this one.
I kind of need everything you can find on him.
from our library, New York Times,
l. A. Times, Ring magazine, of course.
if you can find out if there's a Boxing Hall of Fame, that'd be great.
anybody he may have fought. Uh, trainers, anything.
shouldn't you write this down or something?
plausible deniability.
I've got to take that.
I will get the information and bring it to your cubicle.
let's go. Drive it in. Take it into the hoop.
I'm a big ol' slow guy. You can't take it inside on me. You can't do it!
foul! Foul?
okay. Take some free throws then.
aim for my hand, all right? Front of the rim, my hand.
get it up there.
you gotta roll it off the ends of your fingers, okay?
I suck. You don't suck.
you think Shaq was hittin' baskets when he was your age?
Yeah. Well, he wasn't.
he told me so himself.
he said that he was a big ol' spaz when he was your age.
Really? Yeah, really.
but he told me that in confidence, buddy.
so you can't tell anybody, okay?
dad? Yes?
have you called upJohn Elway yet and asked if he's playing next year?
you know, we keep missing each other, buddy.
I hope he comes back. The Broncos need him.
you know, I told him that you said that. And he said he'd consider it.
Really? Really.
so if he comes back, you're partially responsible.
are you gonna stay for dinner tonight?
mom's making spaghetti and meatballs.
would you like me to?
Hi, sweetie. Hey, Erik.
so, Teddy was just inviting me to stay for spaghetti and meatballs.
what do you think?
how'd it go with Whitley today? We'll talk about it later.
are you gonna make more money at the magazine?
Mmm, no. But that's not really the point, buddy.
it's about the prestige.
and I'd probably have to write maybe 1 5 articles a year. Maybe.
that's a lot of stories. Actually, it's not.
it's only about one every three and a half weeks.
that means I can really concentrate on them, make them good.
then maybe I can become as respected as your mom.
it could be like a ticket to the big time kind of thing.
Los Angeles Times, New York Times.
like the story on the boxer that you pitched to Whitley?
exactly.
in fact, I better get back to the alley, see ifhe's still sleeping there.
there's a man sleeping in the alley?
Yeah, buddy. Some people do that. They don't have a home.
or friends or family. They gotta sleep in the alley.
this sounds like it's gonna be a very sad story.
no, buddy. It's gonna be a hopeful story.
don't worry.
who's coming to Career Day, you or mom?
well, I'm sure your friends would rather hear about...
your dad's work as a sportswriter...
than my conversations...
with Herb... Milton.
he's the city mass transit accountant.
that was awesome. I'm gonna go find Satterfield.
your mom and I will talk about who's coming to Career Day. Okay, buddy?
I love you. See you, buddy.
Bye, Daddy. Bye.
good evening, all you boys and some girls.
this is Erik " The Wow Man " Kernan.
and, wow, was there a fight tonight!
in the hot, stale air of Las Vegas, it was a threeround affair...
that carried the weight of war and sin on its head and shoulders.
there was a winner. That's for sure.
Jesus Christ!
you're Champ, right? Your last name is Satterfield?
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield, number three in the world.
right. Okay.
you told me that last night. Last night.
Yeah, you. Those, um, kids came in here, and they were
Oh, yeah, yeah! Yeah.
you done helped Champ when he was down and halfway out.
Yeah. I'm Erik Kernan of The Denver Times.
I was wondering if I could buy you a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee. I used to. But not no more.
uh, how about a cold beer?
Yeah, I indulge in a beer every now and then.
I think people would love your story.
I mean, you were almost champion of the world.
Ah, that was a long time ago.
you fought LaMotta. You fought Patterson.
you heard a whole stadium of people stand up and call out your name.
you remember that? Sure. Sure, I remember.
people would know you.
you could walk down the street, everybody would know your name.
so, what you gonna write about?
I'm gonna write what you tell me, your story.
Nah. Everybody already know my name. I'm Champ.
well, just in case.
Kernan. Kernan, like that guy who used to be on the radio a long time ago.
Yeah, he was my father. You don't say.
I do, yeah.
your father ruined Christmas for me one year.
he was on the radio talkin'all about how I was a disappointment.
Christmas Eve, 1 953.
I went from up and coming to a hasbeen.
nothin' in between.
pissed me off, your daddy did.
well, let me make it up to you.
I'll come back around, next day or two.
maybe we can have another beer.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah.
Hey! You know, I ain't gonna forget this.
you done helped the Champ when he was down and damn near out.
I'm trying to find something we can all listen to.
well, I can put together a list, I guess.
there are a couple bands that are new, that are good. But they're not too loud.
Yeah. Not all that acid stuff.
no, I wouldn't do that to you, I promise.
Yeah, what? Boss. Hey. Miller's out with the flu.
Yeah, I know, it's going around. You oughta get a flu shot.
I did. They're giving 'em out on the second floor.
Yeah, I did. I just was wondering if I could cover for him.
trailblazers are in town, and he was supposed to cover the game.
I'll just put together a list.
I need those quotes. I need more quotes on the golf story.
Hey, Erik. Uh, I was wondering if I could cover for him.
no, no. Duncan's got the Trailblazers game.
I thought Duncan was covering the bantamweight fight.
you're gonna take the fight, and he's got the Trailblazers.
I promised him. I'm sorry.
okay. Yeah. It's just that my kid...
I was gonna take him because he idolizes the Trailblazers.
they're his heroes.
I'm sorry. The Trailblazers, they're his they're his heroes?
Yeah. Now I know you're full of shit.
see you, Ralph. You give it away like that. No, really. I know now.
boom! That's just the way it happened too.
I broke not the big bone in his nose, but the small one.
you kicked some ass back in the day.
that's right. Bob Satterfield, number three in the world.
yo, man, I gotta go though.
all right, youngblood. Take it easy, baby. All right.
Hey, Champ. Hey, hey!
you. You scared him off. He thought you was the police.
well, I'm definitely not. You remember who I am? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you're the guy helped the Champ when he was down and halfway out. You that reporter.
I'm honored. How you feelin'? Oh, you know, about 60%.
have you thought at all about talkin' with me?
no, I ain't been thinkin' about nothin'. I'm savin' that till later.
what are you doin' now? Are you busy?
corners.
so I'm sorry I brought you to a dog, Champ.
no, no, no. The white kid?
he's gonna knock the Spanish kid on his ass.
don't you mean the other way around? Mmmmm.
kernan, who's your buddy?
tillman, Bob. Bob, Tillman.
how ya doin', Bob?
Oh, about 90% tonight.
um, you got any more of those beers?
sure. Have mine. Help yourself.
white boy's gonna knock the spicky kid out.
no way. Gomez is way too strong, man.
one, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...
nine, ten!
this is over!
how did you see that coming, Champ? The knockout, I mean.
Oh, oh, well, I, um I see the white boy, uhuh Durant. Yeah. I see Durant, he was...
he was, like, takin' that asswhoopin'.
but. But then I seen his eyes.
what about his eyes?
well, he, um. He figured out that the Spanish fella, he had a tell.
see? A tell. When he switched over from lefty back to righty.
see, I saw his eyes figure out that the spicky boy...
he cocked his head to the left before he made the switch.
he had that figuredout look in his eye.
you saw that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I done seen it in my opponents' eyes way too many times.
Ah, don't nobody want to read about an old man like me.
sure, they do. Most fight fans think you're dead, Champ.
I mean, wait till they hear what you've been through.
and that you're still around to tell about it?
they'll shit themselves.
you'll be a celebrity again.
champ, I gotta tell ya.
I'm in real trouble where I work.
I'm just about down and out myself.
I'm havin'a real dry spell at the paper.
they're talkin' about firin' me.
newspapers are being forced to cut bulk because of the Internet and all that.
champ...
this article is my title shot.
all right, son. All right.
you ask the questions. I answer.
Thanks.
see, Rocky Marciano...
he's gettin'ready for thatJerseyJoe Walcott fight.
and Rocky, well, he hired all the good sparring partners around.
and they paid us at that time, oh, what was it?
Oh, yeah, $50 apiece, I think.
come on, Rock! It was on a Sunday.
we put on an exhibition at Grossinger's in New York.
keep your arms up! Keep your arms up!
you're gonna takeJerseyJoe down in the first round!
Oh, he was strong, I'm gonna tell ya.
hit me on the glove, still knock me down.
but not out. See? I got up. Started fightin'harder.
and I kept hittin'him on the nose and hittin'him on the nose...
till his nose started bleeding.
and every time he come to hit with that overhand right...
I'd get back and shoot a short right up to him.
and, and then his nose wouldn't stop. You all right?
everybody was all concerned and stuff, but, you know, Rocky was tough as hell.
he came back! But I had him.
he's goin'down, Rock. He's goin'down.
that's just the way it happened too.
now, now, I broke not the big bone in his nose, but the little bone. Busted it.
now, I'm not one to give my opinion, all right?
but every time Rocky fought after that, his nose bled.
defended the title six times, but always had trouble with that nose.
I'm thinkin' that's why he quit.
what about your father? He must have been proud.
no, no. He used to whoop me.
Seriously? Yeah, yeah.
look. Look here, see?
when did he do that? Oh, I think I was... nine years old.
what? Your daddy never whoop you?
no. Mmm. Well, you're a lucky man.
merry Christmas to all you boys and some girls.
this is Erik " The Wow Man " Kernan speaking of pugilism...
where tonight, wow...
the art of the sport was reduced to something less than that...
when one Thomas Kincaid entered the ring with one Bernard Summerville.
as I sat watching the battle from my humble perch beneath them, one thing became clear.
Mr. Kincaid is no longer worthy to carry the title ofheir apparent...
in a world once inhabited by the greats, by the giants...
by the Dempseys, by the Walcotts, by the Lewises.
this is Erik " The Wow Man " Kernan.
and we'll be right back after these words.
nice article.
Yep. Thanks. You're welcome.
Erik Kernan, Denver Times.
Hey, Ken, what's up?
uh, I gotta call you back, all right? Just a second. See ya.
Hey, Ralph. Morning. Nice piece.
yeah? Thanks.
normally, I'd cut the whole reading of the eyes bit.
but I don't know. It smelled authentic.
I'm glad you liked it.
aren't you glad you didn't go to that bullshit basketball game? Yeah.
champ. Hey!
weren't we supposed to meet? Is that right?
last night. We said we were gonna meet at the park about an hour ago?
well, here we are.
that's our piece. Page one.
how about that? There's spicky boy on his ass.
how about that?
Hey, uhuhuh. How 'bout I buy you lunch?
Yeah.
always this many people here, Champ? Mmhmm.
food always this good? Oh, yeah, most times.
they do make a fish soup some days, but you don't want to touch that.
aren't you afraid someone's gonna steal your cart?
no. We got this kind of homeless code of honor, you know?
it's all right. Nobody's gonna bother it.
you know what would be good for the story?
if I could look at some of the stuff in your cart, see what you lug around every day.
I think it'd be really interesting for the article.
all right, we can do that...
as soon as you take me to your house and let me go through all your personal stuff.
Oh, you know, I listened to my father's tape. Christmas, 1 953.
and he didn't mention you.
he didn't talk about you till about a week later.
well, maybe I got Christmas and New Year's confused.
is your daddy still alive?
no, he doesn't. Throat cancer.
throat cancer. Wow. That's, umThat's, uh
ironic.
irony is when something seems like it's going a certain way, and then
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know I know what irony is, kid.
you know, II've had a lot of experience with irony.
sorry.
so, you have much formal education?
no, no. Didn't have much schooling. I was always boxing.
I never dreamed, though, I'd be heavyweight champ.
but I always thought that if I got that shot, I would like to think that that if I got that shot, that I would win it.
get that respect.
but you didn't get the chance.
no. No, no. Never did.
I had this fight with Ezzard Charles. He was makin' a comeback.
If，if I beat him, then I could go from number three to number one.
then I could get that title. Get a shot at that belt.
but he caught me and somehow knocked me flat on my back.
out cold.
that was a How you say? It was a
that was a big humiliation for me.
I had a couple more fights after that. But I was only about 30%.
wasn't no need in me carryin' on.
I moved to Sioux City, see? Up and left my family.
on account of the humiliation?
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
I worked in the horse stables, uh
one of the owners, hehehe found out who I was, and he had this idea, see?
I told you before. You can't be standing still.
you can't fight his fight! You have to fight your own fight!
he boxed me in the West and theandandand the Midwest...
where nobody knew nothin' about boxing.
wasn't no real competition.
these were, how you say, uhuhuh, nonsanctioned.
but, hell, I could be a winner.
so, I fought and fought. Must've been, like, every other week.
knocked all of'em out.
and in this corner, weighing a lean, mean 1 85 pounds...
from Chicago, Illinois,
Battlin' Bob Satterfield!
but maybe III HowHow you say
boxed. Boxed too much.
one day I was just plain exhausted and beat to shit.
some huge boy knocked me down hard.
knocked me in the eye.
and messed up my vision real bad.
then I just, I just couldn't fight no more after that.
and that, that son of a bitch owner, he kept all the money.
he said, uh, I had messed up the merchandise.
so, then I hitched my way down here.
I remember fighting out here once.
air was clean.
been out here for, ooh, 40somethin' years.
Jesus Christ.
this is all I could find on your guy.
I'll keep looking, but there's not a lot out there.
thank you. Sorry.
did you find the contact information on Satterfield Jr?
there are no listings in Ohio, where he's from.
but I'll try New York, and then Pennsylvania.
and we'll go from there.
Thanks. I did also find this.
what's that?
did you get that press release from the mayor's office?
I'll call you back. Come right on in.
what's this?
that... is Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
Fightin'Joe Blow.
Joe Blow. You don't know who he's fighting?
I'm questioning those investigative skills there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
we got this off a collector. It's the only one we could find.
beautiful.
to be a reporter back then. Can you imagine?
you really are only as good as the athletes you cover.
which one's Satterfield?
he's, uh, this one here.
see the scar on his back?
his dad gave him that when he was nine years old. Can you believe that?
perfect. Perfect.
champ, how's it goin', man?
champ. What's up?
Jesus Christ, man, what happened to your eye?
those kids do that?
you probably need a drink, huh? I need a drink bad.
these guys are gonna give you a drink if you sweep up?
Yeah. But they said the wind done already done it.
but sometime they change their mind.
champ, I'm gonna get you a drink.
but then I gotta show you something, okay?
it's gonna blow your mind.
Hey.
I really appreciate it.
so it's just two minutes long? Yeah, yeah. If that.
Hey, Champ. Champ.
who's that you're fightin' there, Champ?
Satterfield versus Kincaid. Tommy Kincaid.
never had it in him to hurt a man. That was his problem.
he had skills though. He had a hammer!
Where'd you get this?
well, Champ, I'm a worldclass investigative journalist.
this is what I do.
is that the same guy?
who? The guy on the tape? Yeah.
I can't tell. How y'all doin'?
Hey, can I get that back?
could I quickly, actually.
Hey, Champ. Champ!
Hey, you all right?
I thought I'm sorry. I thought you'd like that.
you got kids?
Yeah, I got a sixyearold. Boy. His name's Teddy.
well, I hope that one day, God willing...
your son does for you what you just done for me in there.
Hey, wait, where you goin'?

I still need more for my story.
there's theThatThere. That house right there.
don't stop. Keep goin'. Why?
Betty in there. She come out here, she whoop us both.
who's Betty? Betty used to be my wife.

she was a grad student, I was a sophomore and
she got pregnant.

champ, when I figure that out, maybe I can fix it.
Mmm. I'll tell ya, you know, wwwomen ain't gonna never tell you what's wrong.

my son, BobJr. with my first wife, Iona He tells everybody I'm dead.
Why's that?
is he ashamed of you because you live on the street, or
Oh, it's, uh, probably 'cause I left him and his mama.
Really? How old was he? Six.
so, that was what, like, 40 years ago?
I mean, come on, Junior, get over it. Move on with your life.
Mmhmm.
Yeah, I like to come back here tototo Five Points...

local network was right behind us!
Hey, Erik. Got something for ya.
heard of this guy?
um, uh, yeah. I've heard I've heard of this guy.
good. He's the only one Satterfield fought that I could find.
most of them are dead. I took the liberty of setting up an interview time with him.
when? Today at 4: 00.
an interview with the Raging Bull.
and... Satterfield Jr. of Chicago.
only living relative.
I could kiss you right now. I could sue you.
awesome.
Hello? Mr. Satterfield?
yes?
Hi, this is Erik Kernan of The Denver Times. How ya doin'?
Erik Kernan? Yes.
I wanted to ask you a couple questions about your father. Is that all right?
my father? Yeah.
fuck you.
Erik Kernan.
Erik, hi, Bing Whitley. Hi, Bing, how are you?
good. Listen, I've got our beloved publisher,
Fred Roselle, here with me.
can I put you on speaker? Yeah, uh, sure.
Erik? Fred Roselle. Uh, hi, sir.
now, Bing tells me about your Satterfield story.
honest to God, it floored me. I thought he died 20 years ago.
no, I see him every day. There you go.
you see, I read 1 0 stories a week about fighters in their glory years.
but they never tell you about the price they paid...
taking all those shots to the head.
well, he definitely paid a price, sir.
Yeah, well, that's a story I'll go along with.
hell, I'll even get you on the cover of the magazine.
and Metz doesn't want any part of this piece, is that right?
no, he, uh he called it a dry hole.
that's just amazing.
so, uh, any idea how soon we could see it?
well, I don't want to rush it. Of course not.
uh, so I guess I was thinking maybe two weeks?
I have some interviews I'd like to take care of and
we just dropped a retro piece on Gary Hart.
how about Monday?
Yeah, sure. Monday. I could manage that.
okay, beautiful.
Hey. There he is. Just give me a second, okay?
Hey, Champ!
Hey! Hey, kid! How ya doin'?

so, where's the photographer?
he's just across the street. But I just wanted to, um
I wanted to, uh I got a friend of yours who wants to talk to you.
I ain't know I had no friends. Sure, you do.

Bob, you sure you're okay?
the kid tells me you're out on the street. You're a bum or something?
no. No, no. I ain't no bum, Jake. I'm, II'm just homeless.

MmThank you.
but Satterfield's dead. Twenty years.
Bob Satterfield died in, uh...
82, '83.
I just saw him last night.
not Satterfield.
Yeah, Satterfield. II
I spoke with his son... on the phone.
his son told you he was alive?
no, but they don't get along. Let's get to the bottom of this.
okay.
did you talk to, uh...
Satterfield's trainers?
his ringmen? Anybody like that?
most of them I couldn't dig 'em up.
Ernie...
Ike Epstein.
I'm good. Ernie, you remember Bob Satterfield...
Chicago boy?
Mmhmm.
well, you think he's dead or you know he's dead?
Ah, that'sthat's what I think.
okay.
Thanks. Take care of yourself.
he thinks he's dead.
it's impossible.
never use that word anymore.
Freddy? Ike.
listen. You remember Bob Satterfield?
Yeah. But do you know that for sure?
okay. Thanks.
no, they're good. Thank you. Thank you.
he thinks he's dead, but he's not sure.
who was that? Freddy Bingham.
impossible. Freddy Bingham is dead.
I just talked to him on the telephone.
it was Freddy Benjamin you talked to.
Freddy Benjamin is dead.
two years ago. I saw Freddy Benjamin last Christmas.
Freddy Benjamin is a putz.
Plus, he's dead.
like Satterfield.
Hey, Champ. Hey, amigo. Want something to eat?
uh, nah. How you doin'?
Oh, about 80%. Oh, maybe 90% today.
Yeah. Movin' up in the world, huh?
fella stopped by, gave me a hundred dollars. Read the article in the paper.
champ, I got a question for you.
it's important. Um
do you have a... I. D?
anything with your Driver's license, maybe?
what do you need that for?
so that I can prove that you are who you say you are.
I mean, this guy this exboxing guy hehe thinks that you died, and Some mornings I wake up, I think I'm dead too.
Yeah.
no, seriously though. I just I need something, uh...
that I can prove that you're Bob Satterfield with.
what did you say your name is again?
Erik Kernan.
can you prove that? Well, I have a driver's license with my picture on it.
well, who took that picture? The D. M.V.
and how did they know you was who you said you was?
well, from my last driver's license with my last picture on it.
Oh! And who took that picture?
you see where I'm going with this?
no, Champ.
I don't I just
I need How about a passport?
do you have a passport? Um, any
I don't know. Anything with your picture...
and your name on it.
denver Times! "Resurrection of the Champ, " by Erik Kernan.
that's what I got. Yeah.
except for thatthatthat video you got.
Where'd you get this?
I have a great research assistant.
Satterfield/K incaid. I was there.
no shit? You were there?
Really? South Bend.
I went to all the Satterfield fights. That boy could punch.
I knew I mean, he showed me his scar.
his father did it to him when he was nine years old. It's the same guy
that's the man you interviewed?
Yeah. The one with the scar? You're sure about that?
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
that's Kincaid.
no. Satterfield's the other one.
you've been had, son.
who would it hurt?
you, for one.
it wouldn't hurt me if nobody knew about it.
Oh, is that an option, that nobody will know about it?
Joyce, let me ask you a question, okay?
how many newspapers print articles with errors of fact in them every day in the U. S?
it's already done, Joyce.
it's printed. It's out there.
then print a retraction.
I can't just do that. People have sent in money to Champ.
then give it back. I can't.
I don't know where half of it comes from.
it's not just the money.
the Showtime job?
Joyce, the point of the article is still true.
okay, Erik. It's a lie.
I mean, if you profit by a lie, then you're the same as a liar.
if you write a great story but it's a lie...
then you'rejust a liar who writes great stories...
which is worse than an ordinary liar...
because people who can write ought to be better than your average liar.
so, you're a liar, and you let me down, and you let everyone else...
who works on this paper down because you ought to be better than that.
is that simple enough?
no, Joyce, that's not simple enough.Then let me put it another way.
you need to behave as ifTeddy was watching.
and the winner, by a technical knockout...
one minute, six seconds into the second round, Leo McCracken!
Hey, Leo! Leo!
Hey. So
Leo McCracken
Hey, Leo Leo McCracken, the new heavyweight champ Oh, look, look, look, look, look! Who's that? Who's that? That's Daddy.
it's your Daddy? He lived up to his nickname tonight.
say something to your fans.
first First I want to say "Thank you, Jesus. "
I want to say thank you to my trainer, Tommy McCracken...
and my brother and father cause they used to beat the living crap right out of me.
and, Erik Man, you always believed in me, didn't you?
hard not to believe in 220. Yeah, you did! Yeah! Whoo!
I get my mike back. Take that.
thank you. Number one.
looks like about all we're gonna get out ofhim tonight. Number one!
it's gonna be a long night for Leo McCracken one of the best nights of his life.
I love you, Teddy.
'I love you, Teddy. "
Hey. Hey.
boy Wonder.
you were terrific.
sit.
Thanks, Miss Flak. I, uh
that was fun. That was a lot of fun.
do you mind? No, not at all.
what a city. The only place where you can do harm to yourself...
and others and smile all the way.
fun. " That's good.
fun is what it's all about. I'm glad you had a good time.
I did. I did. I'm not You want a drink? Sure, yeah.
I'll take a scotch on the rocks, please. Thank you.Yes, sir.
they're all watered down. But they keep 'em coming, God bless.
Mmm. So, Yes?
do you think we can turn this onenight stand of ours into a torrid love affair?
I'd like that. Very much, very much.
Where's the smile, Erik?
well, I guess it's just that, uh...
I'm not sure what I... actually did.
you were great. Photogenic.
well, thank you.
that's the beauty of television.
you don't have to do anything. Just be.
so they tell me your old man was some sort of boxing hotshot, a real poet.
Yeah, yeah. He was, um
one scotch. Thank you.
so, if we're gonna do this, if we're gonna make a deal...
um
of course I need to continue with my journalism.
um So I can only work parttime at the most.
well, this is a fulltime gig, Erik, with fulltime pay.
take a good look at me. Are you looking?
Yeah.
does it look like I know the first thing about boxing?
does it look like I know the difference between a hook and an uppercut...
or what a standing eight count is or what a holding penalty is?
see, I don't have to know what any of that is...
because Showtime has a parade of boxing experts.
we spend a fortune being the best in the world at this.
but I am the head of casting, Erik...
and I am here to help Showtime do what it does best...
and that is entertain the shit out of its audience.
because in the end, absolutely everything is about entertaining the audience.
there is no journalism anymore. There's no news.
the people who cling to the hopes that they can inform the world...
are only slightly less naive than the people who think...
they can pray their way out of a tsunami.
and do you know the one thing people don't want?
is the truth.
this guy who won
mccracken.
do you think anybody really wants to know how badly his brains got mangled tonight?
how badly his manager is gonna rip him off...
or how bad his life's gonna be in a few years?
maybe end up on the street like your bum?
the answer is " no. "
it's " no. "
men want to see triumph, and women, well
here you are, with just enough credibility...
to make their husbands not resent you.
Oh. That's
that doesn't sound like much of a job at all.
well, it never does until it actually is a job.
who's Teddy, by the way?
he's my son. He's six. Mm.
I bet he's a cutiepie. He is.
and proud as hell of you tonight.
so...
would you like to come have a drink in my suite?
no. You know what?
I'm gonna catch the last flight out, but thank you.
Mm.
monday we'll talk.
Hey.
Hey.
I took the last flight out. Wanted to see if I could catch Teddy.
all the lights were off.
well, not unusual at 1: 00 in the morning.
did you let him watch it? Are you kidding?
night of his life, seeing his dad on Showtime.
What'd you think? How'd I do?
you did exactly as I thought you would.
Joyce, I can't get it off my brain.
that's because you're decent.
I'm gonna speak to Whitley tomorrow.
I'm gonna drop the bomb on him.
good.
I'm so fired.
it's cold.
I can make up the guest room.
you know, it seems like everybody I know...
everybody I meet knows "The Wow Man " except me.
the only image I have of him...
is a bus poster and some audiotapes.
I don't want that to happen to me and Teddy.
I want to move back home, Joyce.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
I'll...just do
I just want Teddy to know me.
and you think because you're here, he'll know who you are?
you don't know whether to run away from your dad or to chase after him...
and the minute that you figure that out, you're gonna stop running in circles.
seeing Whitley...
it's the right thing.
Erik, you kicked ass on Showtime. Congratulations.
Thanks. Don't forget the little people.
Erik.
Mr. Whitley, I wanted to. Come on in, would you?
talk about my family. I want everybody to know...
that everything I've ever done with my life. Hello, Erik.
Erik Kernan, Riley Washburn.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
I was a great fan of your dad's.
I'd like you to meet my client, Robert Satterfield. Erik Kernan.
I traveled all this way, Mr. Kernan...
to look into the eyes of the man who dared to suggest in print...
that I was ashamed of my father.
the man you've been interviewing Tommy Kincaid has been impersonating Bob Satterfield for years...
fraudulently fought under his name for years.
there was even an injunction brought against him way back when.
we've come to sue your ass right off its hinges, Mr. Kernan you and this newspaper.
the author of the piece in The Denver Times is Erik Kernan Jr...
the son of the legendary radio sports reporter of the same name.
kernan, who recently began a broadcasting career, has not returned calls to ESPN News.
reporters must be held to a higher degree of accountability.
apologies don't Apologies can't fix some things.
you can't go around saying things you did not follow up on.
great. Great. Nursing your wounds with a little whiskey.
there's a cliche for you. Well, what would you expect from a writer like me?
right, Ralph? Yeah, perfect.
a little humility. And it's precisely too late Hey, you know what? Could we change this channel? Yeah, no problem.
just change it to, like, Golf Channel or something.
so, Showtime, huh?
I saw you. You were good. You're a natural.
you know what bothers me the most?
what's that, Ralph?
I only found out about this piece when it came out.
you deceived me. You set out to deceive me.
that hurts my feelings.
Ah, come on, Ralph. Don't get like a chick on me.
the magazine is gonna have to print a retraction.
how big, I don't know.
and Satterfield Jr. is going to want money.
could I get another one? Thanks. Yeah, just a sec.
and SAre you listening to me? Yep.
I'm over here. Look at me. Yes, sir.
there's gonna be a settlement meeting...
at 3: 30 tomorrow afternoon.
you're expected to be there.
okay.
you know, Whitley's gonna be out on his ass...
on account of this his watch and all that.
and there's gonna be an internal review.
we're gonna wanna talk to your wife.
what are you talking about?
we want to make sureJoyce didn't have something to do with this.
you know Joyce didn't have anything to do with this. I didn't know about this.
Joyce is a brilliant journalist.
it'd be a damn shame if you somehow sucked her down to your level.
tell me.
was it just sloppy journalism, or diddid you know it was a lie?
what? Yeah. Whatever it took to be worthy of your last name, right?
here's Here. Look.
that's Satterfield's obituary. The Chicago Defender.
a black paper. Misfiled, but it was there.
you ought to resign. Save the paper the hassle of firing you.
that's for the bum.
people have been sending him dough for days.
Ralph, he's not a bum.
he's homeless.
Nah, he's a bum.
champ. Hey, kid, how ya doin'?
this is for you.What's that?
open it.
people who read your article sent it in. It's for you.
it's for poor Bob Satterfield.
well, people can be nice.
you're not Bob Satterfield.
who says?
his son, for one.
Yeah, well, he always telling people I'm dead.
the Chicago Defender. Ike Epstein. You know him?
sure, I know Ike! How he doin'?
he saw the tape, Champ.
you're Tommy Kincaid.
Bob Satterfield knocked you out in the second round!
you made a fool out of me.
I didn't make no fool out of you. Maybe you made a fool out yourself.
why, because I believed you?
you put my reputation on the line!
I didn't know you had one.
I ain't never heard of you.
Yeah, well, I never heard of you either.
I'm Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
bullshit! Bullshit!
I've been Satterfield longer than you been whoever you say you is.
now just go on. Ain't nothin' else here for you.
I can't believe I let another loser break my heart.
I ain't no loser. I fought Ezzard Charles.
I fought Harold Johnson at the Polo Grounds.
went the distance with Floyd Patterson. III broke Marciano's nose!
you're nothing. You're nobody.
what you doin', kid? It's over.
just go home, okay? You're just another stumblebum!
um, um, hi.
400 block of Curtis
Yeah. Yeah, there's He got knocked out, and the guy's down. He's down on the ground.
it's a homeless guy. Tell them
uh, yeah, this guy with a cart
because I work for The Denver Times, and he's just
hehe was a He was a homeless man, and he was an exboxer...
and, I don't know, I thought it was a good story.
Oh, yeah, you're that, uh that writer guy.Yeah. I'm that writer guy.
and I want to press charges, okay, because the man is officer, um, excuse me.
I'm sorry. He's a threat to the community, is what he is.
my husband is heavily medicated.
I want him locked up.
he can't be expected to make critical judgments at this time.
we'll let you know when he starts making sense. Okay.
okay. Uh, top one's from Showtime.
what?
nothing.
Joyce, I don't need this right now, okay?
I don't need a lecture. All right?
I know I screwed up. It's all on me, okay?
I'll take care of it myself.
Oh, well, you certainly demonstrated that you can handle yourselfjust fine.
I mean, I get drunk and pick fights...
with professional boxers when I'm upset too.
Yeah.
what do you want? What?
I mean Okay.
I'm a monumental screwup.
there. Alert the media.
Oh, that's long done. It's all over the wires.
kernan, the great name in journalism, sullied.
the Rocky Mountain News and the Post have essays...
on your quoteunquote " colossal blunder " on the front page tomorrow.
great.
I went to see him.
at the jailhouse.
he wouldn't talk to me.
he wouldn't talk to the other reporters camped out at the jail either.
see, he's protecting your byline.
he still thinks he's helping his friend.
he humiliated me.
he lied to you. That's his fault.
you're a journalist. You believed him. That's your fault.
not to mention the fact that you're a boxing beat reporter on a major American daily...
and until a few weeks ago, you didn't know who Bob Satterfield was.
look, Erik. You have a chance to forgive this old man.
take it.
okay, I'll take it.
you owe me. Remember that.
I'll remember.
nice suit.
Yeah, the Salvation Army gives them to the police department.
but I think they're knockoffs, 'cause this say " Omani. "
armani starts with a " A, " right?
you have anywhere in particular you want to go?
this, uhThis don't belong to me.
it belongs to Bob Satterfield.
Satterfield's dead.
well, do what you want to with it.
might as well keep it.
I ain't Satterfield now. I know.
all right. As long as you know.
that fella in, uh, Sioux City
he come to me and say I look like him.
Hey, Tommy. And if I fought as him I could make some money.
the boys tell me you used to box before you came here.
cause he had a name. From Chicago, Illinois...
battling Bob Satterfield!
so I did it.
don't nobody know no better.
andAnd I was a winner for the first time in my life.
I wasn't me no more.
I was I was Satterfield, see?
I was somebody better.
better than my own self.
I became Champ.
when I got done fighting, I moved down here and, uh...
met Betty, had a son by her.
but you never see where that next punch is comin' from.
what do you mean?
well, my son, he found out.
found an old Ring magazine.
you ain't Satterfield! " That's what he said.
he didn't want nothin' to do with me after that.
joined a gang, got hisself killed.
I couldn't go back to Betty behind that.
well, Tommy, I wish you would've told all this to me before.
Yeah. I give you the man you wanted.
youYou said you wanted your shot.
that's what you said to me, remember?
my father left me when I was a little kid. Did I ever tell you that?
not that I recall, no. Yeah, well, he did.
he left me and my mom.
they were never really right for each other.
he was a lot older than she was, and
he left.
the only thing I really remember is...
it made my mom cry.
he never called. He never wrote.
and I hate him for it.
and I didn't run wild like your boy.
I just...
thought I would try and be a better father to my son.
try and be a hero to him.
cause every kid wants to think his father's the best, right?
Yeah, that's right.
so, what you gonna do now?
uh
in about an hour I gotta go over to my kid's school and
career Day.
career Day? What's that?
well, I'm gonna tell a bunch of sixyearolds what it means to be a journalist.
Oh, irony! Yeah. Exactly.
you, uh, think she'll take me back, let me in?
I don't know, Champ, but I think you gotta try.
I gotta think on what to say.
I don't think you have to say anything. Just go in.
just for the record, that thing about Marciano
that's the truth. I was his sparring partner.
busted his nose.
not the big bone, but the little one. Yeah.
my dad's name is Erik Kernan Jr.
he writes for newspapers. And he's also on Showtime.
my dad's been up for the Pu the " Publitzer. "
Pulitzer. The Pulitzer.
meaning that he's one of the best writers in America.
my dad writes about boxing 'cause he can't write about football...
cause he's, like, best friends with John Elway...
and, uh, Coach Shanahan.
he even plays golf with Muhammad Ali.
and he turned down, like, being a guy on Monday Night Football.
and also Teddy, why don't we ask your dad to come up?
okay. Dad?
Hi, kids. Hi.
um, I suppose we should just, uh...
ask you if you have any questions.
okay. Yeah? Who's better at golf, you or Muhammad Ali?
um
uh, well, why don't we, uh
maybe we'd be better served if we just talked about...
what it means to be a journalist.
how about that? Go ahead. Yeah.
are you gonna change your last name? Change my name?
my dad said you should change your last name because you don't deserve it.
he says your dad was really great and stuff, and you're a faker.
on the TV, they said you made up a story about a boxer.
uh, kids...
maybe Mr. Kernan can explain to us...
how fast he has to turn in a story after the sporting event has ended.
that's a very good question.
usually I'll turn in a story about two hours after I see the event, because, um
I wish I were dead.
he's six. He'll bounce back.
look, this boy, he loves you.
he knows that you're not a liar. He He believes in you.
he'll be home in an hour.
why don't you come by and talk to him?
I can't.
I gotta go to that settlement conference.
round out a perfect day.
but I'll be fine.
I'll be fantastic.
they really broke the mold with me, huh?
Bob Satterfield was not simply a great boxer.
he was an icon truly an American icon.
and to have his name brought into disrepute
okay, but that's not the issue. I mean, you can't libel the dead.
Riley, we're embarrassed by what happened.
we'll print a retraction.
nobody reads retractions. You know that.
they read the lie, the lie sticks.
look. Mr. Kernan is here to offer his profound apologies...
to you and your family, Mr. Satterfield.
Erik.
I'm responsible, Mr. Satterfield.
I was careless.
and worse than that...
after the story ran, I had reason to believe...
that it was wrong, and I didn't speak up.
I know that I can't undo the damage...
but I'd like to try.
try in what way?
the only way that I know how. I'd write about it.
and say what?
I'd say that I made a mistake. I'd say why.
that
I'd talk about your father. I'd talk about who he really was.
let's talk about damages, Miss Perlmutter.
Bob Satterfield was a great figure in American sports.
Nah, he wasn't none of that.
he a pretty good boxer with a glass jaw.
but he was a very good man.
and a good father, and I'd I'd like for people to know that.
would you put that in your story?
I would. I would.
when you called me, I hung up on you.
you said you was Erik Kernan. You didn't say that you was a "Junior. "
your old man hit my dad with some pretty big shots in his time.
I'd like to read your story.
I think it'd go a long way in making me satisfied.
Jesus Christ, I get it already!
Hey. I've been trying to reach you.
I know. I, uh
did you hear about the deal? I'm gonna write this
Yeah, I heard.
is Teddy awake?
he says he's not feeling well...
and, uh, he doesn't want to go to school tomorrow.
can I speak with him?
could I come in? I really need to talk to him.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.
daddy?
Hey.
are the kids in your class giving you a hard time?
Yeah.
everybody says you made it up about Champ.
I made some mistakes, Teddy.
I made a lot of mistakes.
but did you make it up?
the truth is...
I wrote what Champ told me.
I believed him.
but I shouldn't have.
I was more interested in writing what I wanted the story to be...
than what it actually was.
you know? The truth.
I burned you, buddy. I'm sorry.
it's okay.
not about all this...
but, in general...
are you pretty proud of me?
real proud.
and would you be proud of me...
even if I didn't have, like, a lot of celebrity friends and stuff?
like, if I wasn't a big shot?
well, not as much, but pretty close.
Teddy, I told you a lot of things that weren't true.
like being friends with John Elway and stuff?
Yeah.
what about playing golf with Muhammad Ali?
I covered a celebrity golf tournament, and he was playing in it.
but, Dad, I told everybody you were friends with John Elway.
does that mean I'm a liar too?
no, it doesn't.
it means that you trusted me...
and you told everybody what I told you.
and you should be able to trust your dad.
so I'm sorry.
I think I should go to sleep now.
Hey.
come here. Give me a hug.
you're such a good kid.
Hey, Champ, that you?
Mr. Marciano?
it's Rocky to you, Champ.
holy smoke! What the hell you doin' here?
I'm lookin' for you.
lookin' for me? Yeah.
what for? I heard you're still workin' out.
you're still strong. Oh, no, no. I'm old now.
Ah! Champ, you don't look old.
I'm makin' a comeback.
rocky Marciano, back in the ring.
I'm lookin' for somebody to spar with.
be an honor for me to spar with you, Rock.
good. Let's get started then.
let's see if you got some of the old moves.
come on, Champ. I still got some.
I still got a few.
well, let's see 'em then.
all right. Let's see.
Oh, lookin' good, Champ.
come on, Champ.
I don't need my friends now.
I'm not Bob Satterfield.
let's see what you got, Champ!
I don't want to fight! I ain't Satterfield no more!
okay. All right, all right. You the champ.
you the champ. You the champ
get up, Champ! It's just you and me now!
all right.
all right.
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Tommy Kincaid...
california Golden Gloves Champion!
Oh Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
a writer, like a boxer...
must stand alone.
having your words published, like entering a ring...
puts your talent on display.
and there's nowhere to hide.
I never intended to write a story about myself...
or my son. Or about love.
or the lies that can sometimes come from love. We live in thy fear
I will tell you this about the man I called Champ...
whom everybody called Champ.
he was, against all reason, my friend.
and he was also a liar.
but was that because he was trying to make himself...
better than who he was?
or was it because the one force more powerful...
than a son wanting the admiration ofhis father...
is the father wanting the admiration ofhis son?
sometimes we need the help of our imagination to achieve that status.
for it is no easy task being the strongest, wisest...
most beloved man in all the land.
tonight, the Raging Bull and what is sadder...
than that moment when our children discover...
that we are not the illusory supermen we've created...
but rather, as Herman Melville once wrote, " men drained of valor " ?
...is there more news ofTommy Kincaid.
Erik.
the lies that come from love can devastate...
as much as those that come from malice.
what do you think about guys like Champ's legacy, I suppose...
is the inspiration for truth.
and the beauty that can emerge from it.
I'll tell you how to make real strong muscles.
you get your thumb, you roll up your sleeves...
and you blow.
a beauty that lets our children admire us unconditionally.
in fact, he may have love us unconditionally...
as I love my son mucho grande.
he had a pure heart.
this wonderful ability to it.
you said finding Jacob's remains inside the coffin would make sense to you.
like a carbon copy was made.
Mr. Richards?
I don't know what you're hiding, or why you're lying about what happened to you 13 years ago, but I promise you, I'm gonna look under every last stone of your life until I find out.
you don't belong here.
what?
I remember our Jacob. I just can't let him go.
how could you?
he hardly ever sleeps.
and he eats all the time.
and he's been sneaking around. I saw him.
I've been watching him. I know who he is.
can I help you? - I didn't have anywhere to go.
did I really die?
dad...
why are you still up?
almost done.
looking good, huh?
not bad.
not bad?
it's a masterpiece.
Hey, you want some?
you're not 19 anymore.
Hey, I'm sorry about the noise.
we should have this all painted and done by tomorrow.
well, I like the hammering.
I haven't slept this well in a long time.
it's nice knowing you're here.
you know I'd never let anything happen to you, don't you?
Yes, dad.
you're the most important thing in the world to me.
I bet you forgot how you used to pretend you couldn't sleep, and you'd come out here and sit with me.
I wasn't pretending.
sitting out here...
it felt like it was just the two of us.
you remember what we used to say?
it's us against the world.
and it still is.
us against the world.
looks like blunt-force trauma with an object about an inch and a half wide.
you'd have to ask the coroner to be sure.
remind me you're here again, Maggie.
agent Bellamy wanted my medical opinion.
you were a cop long enough to know what a medical examiner does, right?
watch your step. Blood.
do you recall an armored truck robbery 13 years ago?
the one in Arcadia Bank & Trust.
what about it?
I'm thinking it was Caleb Richards.
what's that have to do with this?
well, hear me out.
Caleb robs the armored truck 13 years ago, goes to bury the money by his hunting shack, drops dead of a heart attack.
well, we never caught the guy who did that robbery, but there's no evidence that it was Caleb.
because he died that day.
he was at his hunting shack two days ago digging holes.
I don't think he found what he was looking for, but inside one of the holes I found what was left of a mask
probably one used in the robbery.
okay. I'm listening.
the way I see it, Mr. Getheard here found Caleb dead, took the money.
no one's the wiser. - Caleb comes back...
realizes the money's gone, figures out who took it...
here we are.
you realize you two are finishing each other's sentences, right?
look.
Caleb had a few run-ins with the law-- small stuff.
nothing like what you're saying.
Jimmy, anything on the murder weapon? - Mnh-mnh.
look, we have the same goal here.
I think I know where the murder weapon is.
you think or you know?
yesterday when I was talking with Caleb, he was washing off a hammer.
not to be funny, but how often do you wash a hammer?
okay.
you and I will go. We'll talk to Caleb, okay?
you know, Elaine's dad is a lot of things, but a murderer?
it doesn't make sense.
you knew Caleb before he died.
this Caleb... might not be the same.
so you think...
this behavior is a result of Caleb returning from the dead?
maybe.
I'm sorry.
just a window.
not that.
please don't.
I can't believe this is happening.
how are you here?
I woke up in the middle of a cornfield...
three days ago.
I don't know how I got there.
I met a family.
they told me I was in Parishville, New York, and that 12 years had passed.
there's, um... there's some blankets in, uh, that cabinet.
you can, uh, stay here tonight.
I'll come back in the morning.
I know somebody you can talk to--maybe help.
is there really someone who can help?
Yes. You're not the only one. There's others.
what?
it's, uh... it's late.
I'll, uh, see you in the morning.
wait, Tom. Wait.
please don't tell anyone I'm here.
I have to tell my wife.
other than that, no one will know.
you found someone?
that's good.
you said there were others.
did they kill themselves, too?
no. Just you.
mom!
mom!
did you see the ghost boy?
Yeah, what'd he look like?
Hey! Hey! Get out of here!
let's go! Go!
Henry, come quick!
get his medicine.
it's okay!
you're okay, sweetie.
you're all right. Come on.
it was just a small one.
you're fine.
you're safe.
okay. You're safe.
good. Okay. You are all done.
why don't you go down, play your videogame?
maybe you can beat Marty's high score.
how is he?
he's fine.
you know, we'll keep an eye on him.
if he has another seizure, we might have to explore some different treatment options.
okay. Good.
jacob doesn't know I found these.
how long has he been doing this?
I changed this bed yesterday.
I found these last night.
but ever since he's been back, he's eating nonstop.
he hasn't been sleeping.
last night, I don't think he slept a wink.
it's different... than before.
he's different?
and I don't know what to do.
all right, we'll figure it out.
why don't you... why don't you bring him by my office and we'll run a few tests, okay?
all right.
okay? - Thank you.
please don't tell Uncle Henry about all this.
I don't want to worry him.
I'm supposed to have lunch with Christine Grant today.
you know she's just an earpiece for Helen.
get all the info she can out of me and report back.
Janine, we need to talk.
Tom, you know it scares me when you do that.
just say it.
there's something I should tell you.
something I-I should have told you.
okay. What is it?
before we met, before I was pastor...
uh, there was a woman I loved.
12 years ago when we were still together, um...
she drove her car off a bridge...
and died.
we all thought... it was an accident.
you know, it had to be, but...
investigation revealed that, uh, she didn't step on the brake.
she...
sh-she actually accelerated, and, uh...
you know, she-- she did it on purpose.
Tom, I-- I-I don't know...
that's horrible, honey.
why wouldn't you tell me that?
I don't know. I, um...
it was a painful time, you know? And I, uh...
I just wanted to put it all behind me, you know?
okay.
why are you telling me now?
because she's back.
like Jacob and Caleb, she's back.
she showed up at the church last night and...
she needed help, and I let her stay the night.
all this time, and you've never told me about her?
when have we ever hid anything from each other, painful or not?
it's because of how much you loved her.
seeing Rachael last night reminded me I'm a different person now.
I love my life with you.
and she was gone.
dead.
obviously not gone.
I don't want anything to come between us. I won't let it.
good.
then you know what you have to do.
Hey, Elaine.
you remember Agent Bellamy.
uh, of course.
we wanted to come by, check on you, see if everything's okay.
mind if we come in?
sure.
Hiya.
ray.
ray, I know. Mechanical genius.
this guy once fixed Maggie's bike tire with a roll of dental floss.
it was no big deal.
is your father home, Elaine?
um... wh-wh-why?
I'll get right to the point.
we need to speak to him in connection with a murder.
a murder? Who?
Dale's dead?
I'm afraid so.
Elaine, are there any weapons in your house? Firearms?
what about that shotgun from the other night?
I'll get it.
do you know where your dad was two nights ago?
my father did not kill Dale. That's ridiculous.
is that your father's toolbox? Mind if I have a look?
what are you looking for?
it's okay.
okay, look...
we're gonna go ahead and hold on to that toolbox for the time being.
the gun-- it's gone.
come on, Jacob! We'll be late for your appointment!
I'm looking for my shoes!
they're in the living room underneath the TV.
we'll be back soon.
loo, hold up.
I called Fred.
he's gonna stop by the Gundys', put the fear of God into that boy for that prank he pulled last night.
and that's gonna fix it?
I'll have Fred put a car out front at night till we feel safe.
about what I said yesterday about letting Jacob go
that came out wrong.
how long have you been accusing me?
of what?
of not loving my son enough?
Oh, Loo, that's
letting him go was not a betrayal.
it was right, and that's what you need to do.
from the start, you accepted that child as our Jacob.
but what if he's not the same?
good morning.
good morning"? What is going on?
what do you mean? - Tom, please.
you want me to believe that you don't know what's happening under your own roof?
I was just trying to help someone in need.
Tom, somebody has broken a window.
there are some kinds of stains all over the floor.
after the money we have spent on renovations, I
there was a break-in.
nothing was stolen. Um, I just
I haven't had a chance to call in for repairs yet.
why were you going in the basement?
Helen, we should, uh... we should call a repairman.
don't you think we-- - What's down there?
nothing.
I want to see.
Helen, there's nothing.
it's the same mask. Shotgun.
it's him.
with Caleb dead and no money found, of course nobody thought of him for this.
and the bank where Elaine works.
it all makes sense now.
what's that?
for security reasons, armored-car vehicles are on a rotating schedule.
only a bank employee could've known when it would be there.
you saying Elaine had a hand in helping her father?
no-- no, no, no. No way.
she's a good kid. She would never.
Caleb must've gotten access to her computers or files or something without her knowing.
is this smoke?
Yeah.
that's all part of how it went down.
armored car pulled in around midday.
time stamp on the photo puts it at 1: 35.
it was the usual drill-- one guard in for the pickup, other stands watch at the rear door.
what they don't know is our masked man here is setting fire to the bank manager's car.
to distract the guard from his post.
right.
it worked.
with the guard unconscious and the keys to the truck, there was nothing stopping him from grabbing the money and getting out of there untouched.
that's why the armored car company changed their protocol and put a third man inside.
so there was no third man back then.
Oh, my God. Call an ambulance!
I got a man down at Arcadia Bank & Trust.
sheriff, over here.
he did it again. - Who?
Caleb. - Wait, what?
he robbed the bank again. Same as last time.
is everyone okay? Is Elaine there?
uh, yeah. Yeah. She's okay.
a guard got shot. I don't know if he's gonna make it.
Oh, my God.
how's Jacob?
well, I'm looking at his test results, and I've never seen anything like it.
his metabolism is through the roof.
Lucille says he's not sleeping.
but here's the thing.
you remember what Ray told us?
Caleb has the same symptoms.
not sleeping, eating all the time.
I think there's a connection.
okay. Call me when you know more.
come on, dad.
answer the phone, please. Please answer the phone.
Hello? - It's me.
Oh, my God, dad. Oh... I need to talk to you.
listen, Elaine, I'm going away for a while, okay?
what? Wh-what do you mean?
just for a little while. I'll come back.
you know I always do.
I got some business. An old friend of mine has a real estate deal lined up in Ohio.
it's gonna be a real profitable thing. You'll see.
wait
sweetie, I got to go. My ride's waiting for me.
dad, wait
who was that? Your father?
what?
you're ridiculous. You think he did this, too?
the cops are gonna come looking for your dad, and when they find him, they're not gonna see a loving father.
I just don't want anyone else to get hurt.
could it be related to his epilepsy?
well, he's always had the epilepsy, so I'm wondering if this is related to his return.
he's been through a lot. Could it just be nerves?
no. I
maybe there are some medical files from back then that I could
forget about back then, Maggie.
he's the same boy.
I didn't say he wasn't.
when I saw him sitting in my living room, everything-- my body, my mind, my soul
knew that this is my child, exactly as he was.
but what if...
okay. Why don't-- why don't you go home?
okay? Get some rest.
I'll spend some time with him.
I'll take him for ice cream.
maybe he'll open up to me.
okay.
you're gonna be a good mother.
ray? I'm heading out for a few days.
I already told Elaine about it.
the bike's working great, by the way.
it's purring like a tiger.
and don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
have you seen my toolbox?
who are you talking to?
no one.
what did you do, Ray?
he's gone.
Yeah, just make sure that we have the north side of Montgomery covered.
okay.
I thought you had cars posted outside.
we had all cars to the robbery.
how the hell did he get away so fast?
maybe he didn't.
you had roadblocks up.
maybe he never made it out of town and he's hiding somewhere.
what?
I saw Elaine on the phone at the bank after the robbery.
I think she might have been talking to her father.
you don't think that she's helping him?
she might be, even if she doesn't realize it.
I thought you quit.
I did.
Hey.
do you think your father did those things?
remember in grade school when those kids used to pick on Ray all the time?
one time, I got so angry, I threw a rock and hit one right between the eyes.
I was so scared my dad was gonna whoop me when he found out what happened, but he
he went over to their parents', and he warned them never to bother us again.
I've only ever felt safe when my dad was around.
I know it's hard, Elaine.
so what exactly did they say about Dale Getheard's murder?
how did you know who was murdered?
who have you been talking to?
you knew, and you didn't tell me. - No, I'm sorry.
Maggie, why would you keep that from me?
I wa-- I didn't know what to do. I
Elaine, you need to face facts.
ms. Richards.
I already told you, I-I don't know where my dad is.
all the same, Elaine, we have to ask you some more questions.
you're gonna have to come with us.
am I gonna be okay?
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.
did you figure out what kind of ice cream you want yet?
I always get the same--mint chocolate chip with sprinkles.
man of conviction. I like that.
you know, you've been through a lot these past few days.
is everything okay?
people look at me like...
like I'm weird.
who does?
those teenagers last night.
my dad.
do you think you're weird?
when I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend named Dummo.
and Dummo would say all the dumb things I was thinking but didn't want to say out loud.
pretty weird, huh?
you know, it's good to have a mom who loves you as much as yours does.
some people don't have that.
but even when you do, sometimes...
you hold things in.
to try to be strong.
cause you don't want to worry her.
but you know you can tell your mom things, right, Jacob?
you can also tell me things.
cause I'm your family, too, right?
we just passed Caleb.
what?
where? I'm not sure.
my dad's old factory, I think.
jacob, how do you know that?
I can feel him.
Elaine, I know this is difficult, but both times that armored truck was robbed, you were working in the bank, yes?
Yeah, but-- - He knew exactly when and where it'd be.
the schedule was always changing, so how could he have known unless someone tipped him off?
he didn't do this-- any of this.
your position at the bank gives you access to the schedule.
isn't that right?
Mr. Langston, you know me. I wouldn't have any
El-Elaine, just answer his questions, sweetheart.
did your father have access to your office in the past few days?
did he use your computer?
no.
what about the phone call outside the bank?
that was him, wasn't it?
I know he's your father, but if he used you, is he really worth protecting?
what did he say to you?
he said he loved me.
there's someone here to see you, Sheriff. It's urgent.
I'm sorry, Sheriff, but he was insistent.
since Gary's your friend, I thought
I know. It's okay, it's okay. - So is it true?
my cousin Dale-- is he dead?
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry, Gary.
well, do you know who it is?
did you at least get the guy?
Fred, tell me. - Hey, we're doing everything we can.
I'll let you know when we know.
okay?
Hey, why don't you go home and let us do what we do, okay?
come on.
dad.
I think I know where Caleb is.
how?
jacob told me.
I figured if you wanted to find me, you'd know where.
nice to see that some things don't change.
I couldn't decide if I should come.
why not?
didn't know what I'd find.
I don't want to die.
not anymore.
but I wish I hadn't come back to find you'd moved on.
it feels like I'm being... punished.
you're being punished?
damn it, Rachael, you hurt us
me, your family.
how could you be so selfish?
I didn't plan it.
not that that's an excuse.
I was driving home over the bridge and I just thought, maybe this could be it.
it could all end tonight.
I wouldn't have to pretend to be happy.
you could have someone who really deserved your love.
Why? Why did you want it to end?
you could have talked to me. - And said what?
you believed in me.
and I wanted so much to be that person.
but I hated myself...
for falling short time and again.
we had our whole lives ahead of us.
and we were gonna spend them together.
and we still can.
I went to the church.
I went there to tell you you have to leave...
for the sake of my marriage.
but when I got there...
when I got there, and you were gone...
I felt like I lost you all over again.
I couldn't go through that-- not again.
I don't want to go...
but I can't stay.
you have a nice time with Maggie?
Yeah.
you think you can sleep?
not really.
I try, but it's hard.
do you want me to lie down with you for a little while?
Maggie doesn't have a mom.
I know.
it's sad.
us against the world, Laney.
how do we know we're in the right place?
this is my family's place.
if he's hiding here, it's right through those doors.
you smell smoke?
this is Sheriff Langston!
come on out now!
come on, Caleb!
haven't enough people got hurt today?
let's get this over with, Caleb!
we're gonna have to go in there.
don't move! Don't move!
put your hands on your head! On your head!
come towards me. Slowly.
nice and slow.
right there. Don't move.
he's clean.
okay. I got him.
come on. Come on.
it's over.
no.
it's just beginning.
my father was an innocent man, destroyed by powerful people.
the Graysons are behind this. They're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
and I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
maybe your new financial advisor can help you find your way out of the red.
surely, Aiden, you of all people should know the Graysons are completely bankrupt.
together we're going to destroy that little bitch.
victoria took the bait. - Thank you for coming back.
well, I knew that if you reached out to me,
I must be the only one you could turn to.
my mother warned me not to trust you.
yet here you are.
well, I like to draw my own conclusions.
Amanda Clarke was my friend.
she knew what Conrad did to her father.
I want you to persuade him to confess.
I'm turning myself in to the authorities.
if you get in that car, I swear it'll be the last thing you do!
father Paul!
Conrad Grayson involved in M. V.A. blood pressure--170/100, pulse--120, possible head trauma. C. T. scan recommended.
paul Whitley B. P.-- 40 over palp, possible spinal injury, significant blood lost at scene.
please hold on.
you need to wait here.
Victoria, you're crying.
Adam and Eve Banished from Eden.
it's my first Randolph.
it's prophetic, as Conrad was the serpent all along, dragging me to hell with him.
now he's going to do something to destroy me and this entire family.
losing our fortune proved insufficient.
now he's going to die and leave me with the shame of his sins. God... have mercy on my soul.
you act like you're-- You're bound to Conrad with no way out.
you are Vicky Harper
the woman who made an enviable life from nothing.
that's who I was once.
that's who you are now.
and I know that...
because you and I are the same.
now you have everything you need to change your life right here in this room.
sell this collection.
and we'll leave the Hamptons.
I have tried to leave him so many times.
but I can't abandon Charlotte and Daniel to deal with Conrad's mess.
my children need me now more than ever.
Mrs. Grayson?
there's been an accident.
Hey.
you get a chance to look over my remodel ideas, J. P?
success is all about branding.
well, branding can keep calling me "Jack.
but I did check 'em out, and I'm down for a few changes.
what's all this?
invitations to the wedding of the century.
maid of honor reporting for duty.
I thought you were into it.
Emily and I have hit a few bumps lately.
I'm trying the bygones thing because she's marrying my brother in eight weeks.
but sometimes, I swear, I don't know the real Emily.
so are you thinking of asking Margaux to the wedding?
I'm not going to the wedding.
not going?
I need a little break from Emily Thorne.
we're losing him.
still in v-tach.
charge again. Clear!
come on, come on.
he's still in v-tach. Nothing.
damn it. Time of death--23: 36.
any news? I...
I haven't heard much of anything out here.
father Paul's gone.
he went into cardiac arrest...
and they couldn't save him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, he was a good man.
he was taken too soon.
you know, Victoria didn't say much about him on the drive over here...
or about Conrad, for what it's worth.
have you seen him? - No.
Daniel made it clear I wasn't needed in the room.
he... said it was family only.
Ah. - I know when I'm not welcome.
the Graysons tend to close ranks in moments like these.
just tell my mother I'll be at the manor if she needs me.
please, try Charlotte again.
she must not have got my messages, as I'm sure she would be here.
still, I'd rather she not learn about my accident on Twitter.
Oh, and yet you were so eager to air your confession for all the world to hear on the evening news.
it seems that your father's dying wish is to put a final nail in the family coffin by publicly admitting to framing David Clarke.
that's where he was headed.
why on earth would you confess?
because my time with Paul inspired a spiritual conversion.
though this near death experience may have put an end to that rationally conceived notion.
you better hope he survives, because the doctors ordered you not to drive with Huntington's.
father Paul's dead.
I knew it was a bad choice.
he's very persuasive.
look, I bought that Ferrari new in 86.
it was a gift to myself for cracking the Forbes 100.
anyway, Paul and I test drove it together, and he really showed me what that car could do.
are you rehearsing the sob story you're planning on telling at your manslaughter trial?
no, my dear, I merely want you to understand how Father Paul came to be behind the wheel at the time of the accident.
what?
he wanted to relive a memory.
it breaks my heart that I let him.
I will not be complicit in your ridiculously obvious lie.
and good luck getting the authorities to swallow this tripe.
em... Em, you-- You were first on the scene.
what did you see?
the car was on fire.
father Paul's body was thrown about 15 feet in front of it.
and where was I?
you came up from behind me.
I was nowhere near the driver's side of the vehicle, correct?
Yes.
nowhere near.
you are my guardian angel, Emily.
lord knows where I'd be without you.
well, the man's a survivor.
that's because Conrad caused the accident.
I don't think he ever intended to confess, and he made damn sure that Father Paul didn't either.
Yeah, I don't know, Ems.
I mean, murder by auto accident?
Conrad is pretty psychotic, but why would he risk his own life?
well, he's not afraid to die.
that's a side effect of convincing somebody that they've got a terminal disease.
can we just talk about the elephant in the mansion?
that maybe the crash was due to another fake Huntington's Em-isode?
I lowered his dosage yesterday so he'd be healthy enough to turn himself in.
if Conrad had been too ill to drive... - Hey-- Hey.
don't blame yourself.
I need to find the car, prove that Conrad was driving.
can you get me into the police database?
um, with, uh, my library card?
ems, tech time-out, remember?
plus I, uh, have my own Grayson reven-genda this week.
Aiden, since you're living at the manor, keep your ears peeled around Conrad.
and in the meantime...
replace his medication with these.
maybe there's a chance he'll still confess if he thinks he's at death's door.
thank goodness Conrad survived.
with nary a lasting injury.
in fact, he's being released from the hospital this morning.
how much more can the poor man endure?
trust me, Sheila, that man will always rise above.
Oh, look at what you've accomplished.
turning this into the Hamptons' premiere gallery.
having Victoria Grayson as a loyal customer helped cement this gallery's reputation.
I'm honored to have helped you build your collection.
and I trust we've built - a friendship over the years as well. - Of course we have.
well, I can only hope that you'll help in turn.
I used to be an art consultant many years ago.
and now that I'm an empty nester with a husband incapable of working,
I was looking to reignite my passion.
darling, I heard all about your money troubles.
so are you offering up your services or...
asking me for a job?
it's the latter.
well, then the job is yours.
and, of course, we'll have a welcome reception to fete your renaissance.
Oh, this announcement will bring tons of traffic into the gallery.
I trust you'll call and invite all your friends to come and see the new... improved Victoria Grayson.
I will.
and thank you, Sheila.
I don't know how to repay such a kindness.
Hey. - Hey.
sorry to interrupt your meeting, but I needed to see you.
um, can we talk about the accident for a second?
Oh, perfect timing then. This is Detective March.
he'll be handling the investigation.
Hi. - Hi.
that's funny, because I was the first on the scene, - and no one's taken my statement. - I already gave it to him.
Yeah, they're pretty clear about what happened.
Yeah, seems there was driver error on Father Paul's part.
he just took the curve too fast.
lost control.
and for his quick response, the Graysons are proud to support the local authorities.
well, then I guess that's settled.
Yeah, it will be. I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah.
um, Miss Thorne? Miss Thorne?
Hey. - Hi.
did Mr. Grayson look almost finished?
because the magazine launches next week, and his publisher's bio is due to the printer in minutes.
the profile introducing Daniel to the readers of Voulez?
exactly. And Ms. Lemarchal will have me fired unless I get at least one personal detail about him.
well...
I'd be happy to give you a statement.
you know, for a guy with an amazing pool, you sure do spend a lot of time at this beach club.
I'm just... trying to justify the king's ransom - I spend in membership dues. - Ah.
so... What brings you to our pristine shores?
the inevitability of the tide.
what comes in must go out, right?
thinking maybe it's time for me to move on.
leaving the Hamptons so soon?
you ever feel like you don't belong?
story of my life.
enjoy the beach.
I'm gonna go for a swim.
Charlotte, dear...
uh, could you... Please call me back?
all I'm asking for is a minute of your time...
what is it, Detective?
Oh, I had it moved off site. Daniel didn't tell you?
piedmont Salvage Yard.
Yeah, have it taken care of quickly.
and, uh, don't call again.
welcome home.
what the hell are you doing here?
I just moved into your pool house.
Oh, well, I just got off the phone with the police.
I'm happy to call them back. - Why?
so you can have me arrested on another trumped up charge?
or are you scared?
of being killed in my sleep by a coward like you?
damn straight.
Bianca, could you please inform the staff that Mr. Mathis here is to be denied access to the manor?
and, uh, have the doors to my suite and study locked at all times during his inevitably short stay.
Yes, Mr. Grayson.
so why don't you go back to your cabana?
and then prepare to keep going back over the ocean.
well, if you still ran this house,
I... might actually be scared.
Conrad's car is at Piedmont Salvage Yard, and you should know that Daniel's in the thick of it, too.
I know. I just caught him giving my statement to the officer handling the case.
I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am.
that's because no one can be trusted.
Emily, look, I'm-- I'm sorry. I know this is the closest you've come to clearing your father's name.
I'm not giving up.
well, at least-- At least take a minute.
okay, I... I know you well enough to know that you're not okay. Just...
talk to me.
I'm fine.
I gotta go.
Hey.
look, I just wanted you to know that I don't think Conrad's gonna confess.
I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.
is this another one of your plans gone sideways?
no, Jack. This is Conrad getting away with murder.
you know what? I shouldn't have come.
hang on. Let me help you.
no. No way.
this man has killed my wife. He's killed my brother.
all I ever wanted is to find a way to make him pay for something.
anything...
look, Jack, I need you to stay out of this.
Hey, it's Jack.
I need some info.
and Daniel Grayson has always risen above adversity to embrace new challenges.
following a drunk driving accident, which nearly killed his passenger, he saw it as a wake-up call, joining then rising through the ranks of his father's company, eventually running it.
now this has gone to print, and will be in every copy of the first issue.
they wanted details making you more relatable to the readers.
so you told them about my D. U.I?
what the hell were you thinking?
I think it shows how far you've come.
Oh, no, no, no. You're a smart woman, Emily Thorne.
this was passive-aggressive.
hell, this was aggressive. You were
you were trying to hurt me. - That's ridiculous.
is it because I've been too busy with work?
is that why? Come on. Give me a reason.
and I want the truth.
how dare you demand the truth.
you're right, Daniel. I'm not an idiot.
I know exactly what was happening this morning.
Oh, and this was in retaliation?
did you stop for a second to think about why I helped my father?
does it matter? It's disgusting.
I thought you were better than Conrad, but you're just as wrapped up in his lies.
Yeah, right, cause you're such an open book.
where are you going? - I'm not doing this.
you walk out that door, and I'm not gonna be here when you get back.
then don't forget to turn on the alarm.
Yes, at the Sheila Lurie Gallery.
Oh, Jordan, thank you for your support.
I'll see you then. Bye, now.
still making phone calls, I see.
well, the more clients I secure, the faster I'll be fiscally independent from this marriage.
and I want that gallery swarming.
although I'm loathe to endure the stares of friends who relish my predicament.
well, let 'em stare.
then when you're back on top, they'll kiss your ass.
why don't you take a walk with me on the beach?
it's where I go to clear the cobwebs.
Oh, I would love to, but I have invites to extend, and I need to reach out to Daniel and Charlotte.
I really need their support.
how to dig up your skeletons.
no.
no technology.
it'll only get you into trouble.
Oh. Just... once...
then I can stop.
I can stop anytime.
and if I can't stop, then I can write a program...
that will make me stop.
sweet chord of connectivity.
come to papa.
it's beautiful. - It is.
and it's also Victoria Grayson's.
so might I ask how it came to be in your hands?
Oh, um... I'm her son.
Ah.
I had heard through the grapevine that Victoria's first born had... resurfaced.
and now he stands here intending...
if I catch your drift to fence one of her more valuable pieces?
well, I'm leaving the Hamptons, and I could use a little traveling money.
what can I tell you?
I'm a bastard in more ways than one.
as much as I love it, I simply can't risk purchasing a piece of this caliber without the proper paperwork.
it's illegal.
Hey, how's the sultan enjoying his Pollock, by the way?
I heard about your hobby of, uh...
somehow acquiring certain rare and valuable pieces and then privately reselling them to high-end international buyers.
unless, of course, the grapevine was wrong.
you said it yourself. This is a valuable piece.
how should we handle this?
you know, the more I know you, - the less I know you. - Jack, what are you doing here?
you can't be here! - And you can?
I'm not just gonna sit around - and let Conrad get away with murder. - Let me deal with him.
we can fight, or we can get to work.
but I'm not going anywhere.
I think I found something.
I just took a video of the entire car.
look at the steering wheel.
that's housing for an air bag that Conrad had installed.
though it must have deployed when the car hit the pole.
that's why Conrad has burns on his face and Father Paul doesn't.
this could really prove that Conrad was driving, which means that he had the air bag removed and destroyed before they towed the car.
Jack, look, just give me your phone.
I'll download the video and take care of it.
no. - Jack
I've been waiting for my moment to make this bastard pay, and it's finally here.
you can't do this.
there could be consequences.
you didn't think about that when you lied to me for two years.
so either I get to tell this truth...
or the other one.
your call.
Hey.
so... What's the 4-1-1, hon?
I found proof.
Conrad should be arrested sometime today.
wait, wait, wait. So isn't that good news?
no. Because Jack came to the salvage yard last night and demanded he do the honors.
I thought you promised never to pull him into this.
I didn't. He wouldn't listen.
well, I'm not waiting around for the fallout.
where are you headed to?
Oh, just a... quick sojourn to the sunshine state.
what are you all dolled up for?
a reception at the Sheila Lurie Gallery.
it seems Victoria's gotten herself a job.
so what, you're going to, uh, support the working classless?
I did something rash.
Daniel didn't come home last night.
I figure a public forum is the easiest place to make amends.
are you sure you want to be around Victoria after what just happened at my party?
it'll be fun to watch her try not to lose it.
Lucinda, you know Victoria.
Yes, we've served on several boards together over the years.
Yes. Well, I assume you'll have no time for that now that you're working. How unexpected.
it's a coup for me. Victoria knows her stuff.
she was my biggest customer till just a few months ago.
browse, Lucinda.
excuse me, ladies.
when you said you'd taken a job,
I had to see it to believe it.
well, I'm asserting a little independence from your father.
and I can see it had its desired effect, as I hope you've come to support me.
Yeah, Mom, I have.
I'm actually proud of you. - Oh, sweetie.
it's a beautiful gallery, Victoria.
what are you doing here?
well, I wanted to show my support.
I feel terrible after what happened at Nolan's party.
well... I'll never forget what you did to my reputation, nor forgive.
maybe in time.
after all, I will be a Grayson in a few weeks.
well, if you're looking for Daniel, he's not here.
maybe he's still at the family suite at the South Fork Inn.
must be trouble in paradise.
nothing we can't work out.
well, thank you for coming, Emily.
feel free to leave anytime.
well, since I'm here, I thought I'd have a look around.
I'd love to give you your first commission.
so... That's what's been up with you.
you're having problems with my brother.
we'll be fine. Excuse me.
Yeah, all right. - Okay, well, thank you.
thank you, thank you.
detective March says you're in the clear.
Oh. - The car has been demolished.
father Paul's body has been claimed by the monastery, - and the case is officially closed. - Well, let's toast to that.
I gotta head over to Mom's reception.
I don't want to miss Emily.
we had a pretty bad fight last night.
over what? - Believe it or not, she gave Voulez my D. U.I. story for my bio.
you do realize that's a power play, son.
what do you mean by that?
well, I presume you don't consider my marriage a paragon of excellence, but the thing that's kept the fire lit all these years is that we know how to fight, but not surrender.
now you go to Emily now, and you are admitting defeat.
I see your point.
good, because...
I won't be around to dole out these nuggets forever.
then tell me the truth.
what really caused the crash?
Oh, I took the turn too fast.
I might have hit the clutch instead of the brake and made poor Father Paul the first victim of my Huntington's.
but you had the good sense to help me cover it up.
I didn't do it for you.
I can't have the family dragged through the mud one week before my magazine launch.
I'm finally making a name for myself, building it with hard work, not legacy.
I have something to lose now.
this is Conrad.
the humidity here is awful.
you must be from L. A.
new York.
damn it. I'm usually right.
you know what I love about the South?
people are so friendly.
it's a product of Bible belt fear.
but trust me, there are some...
less than desirable folks around here.
like your, uh... ex-husband?
Patrick Osbourne, right?
who the hell are you?
if he sent you here
no, he... He didn't.
I'm just... looking into him for a friend.
Patrick is a user and a liar.
that's all I have to say.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I need details.
would, uh...
$20, 000 change your mind?
I apologize in advance.
all hundreds.
what do you want to know?
this would be beautiful in your home.
and an acquisition at this price point would be a major asset to your portfolio.
Victoria, there you are.
while I applaud your go-getter attitude, one of the track lights has been up for ten minutes.
I'll finish up with this sale.
Sheila, can we have a word for a moment?
excuse us.
Yes. Thank you.
I was going to do this later, but I received a curious phone call this morning from a friend of mine-- Jordan Sawyer.
does that name ring a bell?
Why?
well, you brokered the deal for him to add a Randolph to his collection
one he knew I possessed.
well, I can undo that deal.
but we still have a problem.
you sold a piece of art that I own.
now you are seasoned enough to know that buying and selling art without the proper ownership paperwork is larceny.
you should know that your son Patrick brought it to me.
so if I go down, then so does he.
and your family does not need another scandal.
Oh, well, everyone knows about our financial situation.
so I have nothing more to lose, but you have everything to lose.
what do you want, Victoria?
you always have an end game.
but I didn't have an end game before this.
and not even when I came to an old friend to ask for a little grace, a little mercy.
and I helped you. I hired you.
no.
you took pleasure in my family's hardships.
and you tried to humiliate me with that little reception.
so when I found out that you sold my art behind my back, that's when I developed an end game, as you call it.
you disappoint me.
I'm calling the police.
please. Please, please, please, no, I...
okay... While this started as my welcoming party, it's now your farewell to the Hamptons.
so go out there and tell everyone that this is my gallery now...
right after you change this bulb.
jordan got the Randolph back to me in mint condition.
and our plan worked perfectly.
the gallery's mine.
see? I knew you still had a little Harper in you.
you took a huge risk just to make me happy.
neither Daniel nor Charlotte have ever made me feel so special.
sorry I haven't returned your messages.
I just got back.
from handing over the evidence?
I've been burned too many times by accepting what's in front of me as true.
so before I turn this in, I wanted to run it by Vince.
he's a mechanic.
we were right about the air bag.
but there's something else.
and that is a puncture that Vince says could not have been made by the impact.
someone tampered with the brakes.
that's what caused the accident.
it doesn't matter who was driving.
I thought I had him. I thought I had him.
I have to go.
Conrad has news.
Oh. Keep me in the loop.
if I'm in danger again, I'd like to know.
what are you doing here? This is reckless.
someone tampered with Conrad's brakes.
that's what caused the crash and killed Father Paul.
Aiden, I need to know it wasn't you.
after everything I've done, you still don't trust me?
you've gone rogue before.
just tell me.
I didn't do it.
I came back here to help you finish this your way.
okay.
so how do you know that Conrad's brakes were tampered with?
there's proof. But I don't have it.
Jack does.
wh-- Porter? You-- You-- You went to him, but how?
does Jack know who you really are?
how long?
since the night of the election.
he was going to kill Conrad. I had to protect him.
I'll explain later. I'm sorry.
well, I think Mark's father had a huge influence on him.
Really? Oh.
what's the news? - I don't know.
my father insisted we all be here, so...
hmm. Unseasonably chilly tonight, isn't it, Emily?
while I adore performance art, why don't you just get on with it?
I received a call from the hospital today, asking me to come back for an M. R.I. which confirmed... a shocking discovery.
I've been misdiagnosed.
and I do not, nor have I ever - suffered from Huntington's Disease. - What?
how did they explain the symptoms?
seems they were brought on by stress and the Huntington's medication itself.
I realize now what Father Paul meant when he said that he'd been brought back into my life through divine intervention.
I mean, he was God's vessel to show me that I'm meant to live a long and meaningful existence here on earth.
and Father Paul is now doubtless in heaven, having earned his wings.
well, maybe he's laughing at you because you had to step down as governor for naught.
I know I certainly am.
well, being governor merely distracted me from my true destiny
leading this family. And so the first step is reclaiming my rightful position as master of this house.
you must be happy.
your father's misdiagnosis means you're in the clear, too.
we're going to have one of those in a few weeks.
you sure you want it?
you questioned the type of man I am in print... and to my face.
sorry I questioned you.
if I had a family, I'd do anything to protect them.
Daniel, I want nothing more than to marry you.
Why?
I don't think you ever told me why.
because I love you.
now come on. Let's go home.
I'm gonna stay at the South Fork again, okay?
Daniel. - See you tomorrow.
Where'd you say you found my wallet again?
well, I went back to the beach club after I saw you there in hopes that I'd bump into you again.
no bump, but, uh, your wallet was there.
lucky you, that I found it.
why were you looking for me?
maybe... Because you intrigue me.
Victoria's mysterious son.
what on earth is he up to in the Hamptons?
and... why is he always in such a rush to leave?
what did you find out?
something that made me happy you stayed.
that was a bit presumptuous.
look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry.
I just thought, you know, you showed up at my party, and we saw each other at the beach club, that maybe we, uh...
we did.
have mercy.
how about just a glass of wine?
yeah... That, too.
so?
well, you're not in any danger.
Conrad realized that he's not sick, and now he thinks he beat God.
I guess there's no beating him.
Emily? What are you doing here?
I wanted to make sure you got the news about your father.
he mentioned that you haven't called him back.
Yeah, Daniel already told me. He didn't let you know?
uh, he's still staying at the South Fork, so...
I finished with your wedding invitations.
though you'll probably want to save postage on one.
here you go, Jack.
so much for your break from Emily Thorne.
good night.
night.
I can't believe you're still going through with this.
what are you...
you're planning on taking them down at your wedding.
I don't want you to be there.
I deserve to be there.
I want to be there when they get what's coming to them.
no, you don't.
go back to your life, Jack... To Carl.
you don't belong in this.
you know, I don't believe I've properly congratulated you on your new amusement.
well, it's more than you're doing, and it's my ticket to freedom from you.
so get out. I've got a lot of work to do.
there's that spunk I fell in love with.
and I will leave just as soon as you describe to me Mr. Mathis' exit plan.
so you have until breakfast to remove him, or... I'll do it my way.
now that would be unwise.
Aiden may be the only hope we have of stopping Daniel from marrying Emily.
it seems that she has some inexplicable weakness for him.
God, are you still chewing that same bone, woman?
use that tenacity to get him out of my pool house.
you may want to rethink that idea.
I looked into your accident.
and why was it your concern?
because I don't like you. And I thought maybe you'd intentionally harmed that priest, but I discovered something far more surprising.
somebody tried to kill you by tampering with your brakes.
and I have good reason to believe it's someone you know well.
and I imagine I'm looking straight at him.
no, Conrad.
Jack Porter wants you dead.
my father was an innocent man, destroyed by powerful people.
the Graysons are behind this. They're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
and I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
word is that Conrad Grayson is writing his memoirs.
I would love to talk more about it.
what do you want? - Conrad Grayson sent me.
if you want any future with your son, you leave now.
you can't deny that we've made a good team.
I'm declaring my independence.
you can't do this alone.
get the hell out of my house.
Daniel wants his ex-girlfriend to make our wedding cake.
do you suspect something's amiss?
I think that you may be the one for Daniel.
perhaps we could work together towards a common goal.
looks like they're about to rekindle their past.
then I have to make sure they have no future.
secrecy causes even the simplest truth to seem wondrous, mysterious.
it has the power to fuel passion and seduce you into becoming someone you're not.
we should get going soon.
you did tell your parents I was coming, right?
or that I exist? - I thought we'd surprise them.
but what if your mother hates me? - She won't.
and even if she does, I'll protect you.
but no matter how we try to guard our secrets, to keep them close...
they all come out eventually.
I was hoping to get in there with you.
I can't. I'm.I'm running late.
you've been going in earlier and earlier all week.
maybe we could get lunch today.
find a secluded spot on the dock, have a picnic...
Yeah. I,uh...I can't today. I got too much to do.
I promise...I'll make it up to you tomorrow.
I would hope so.
our bridal shower is tomorrow.
right.
I still don't get why my mother insisted it be co-ed.
Oh, everyone knows your mother prefers the company of men.
I'm just happy you'll be there to protect me from her.
Yeah.
that will be perfect, Rohan.
I'm on pins and needles.
that means I'm excited to see you.
Yes, perfect.
call me when you land.
Bye-bye. - Would you just, uh, dry-clean the silks, please?
Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.
well, I see you're still taking advantage of our amenities.
who was on the phone?
Oh, just a little surprise I'm planning for the shower.
well, since you've suddenly gotten into the spirit of things, maybe you wanna make the welcome toast?
I lost my phone.
which relates how?
well, I had the speech for Emily saved on there, and I don't have time to recompose it.
probably for the best since I didn't inherit your talent for faking sincerity.
it's called being polite.
and perhaps we wouldn't have to be if Sara had responded to my appeal.
I haven't heard from her all week.
maybe because she's too busy sneaking around with Daniel.
I noticed her texting with him this morning, so whatever carrot you dangled, it seems to be working.
she won't stop digging.
margaux's determined to write this expos??
she's convinced it'll help Voulez's sales.
Yeah, but what exactly did she discover?
nothing yet, but she's researching articles on Grayson Global, Conrad, the acquisition of Nolcorp.
Oh?
did she happen to see that I made, uh, People's sexiest men alive list, right behind Joel McHale?
so what if Margaux manages to sniff out some truth?
you know, maybe it's time that a little gets out there.
not when it involves Conrad.
all I'm asking is that if she contacts you, - don't give her any leads.
all right.
what are you doing?
Roommate-proofing. Aiden Mathis is moving in.
are you kidding me? - He's a decent guy.
who caused me to send my son away.
well, maybe that's not a bad thing.
you don't have to worry about Carl's safety till the wedding's over, and when it is, they'll leave, and you won't ever have to see Aiden again.
he's...he's leaving with Emily?
I didn't even know they were together.
EMS. Didn't hear you sneak in.
just brought a few things for Aiden.
thanks again for helping us out.
why didn't you tell me that that was your plan?
you knew I was leaving.
with the guy who tried to strong-arm me out of town?
you conveniently left that part out.
you gave me a deadline to end this.
you don't get to pass judgment about what I do when it's done.
you're right. I don't.
Hey. Leaving so soon?
I have a few more things to check off my list.
Oh. Saw it first.
now because I'm a gentleman, I'll hand it over.
a gentleman or a stalker?
your text said you'd be here, buying ingredients for my wedding cake.
that wasn't an invite?
no? All right, I'll go.
no. Don't, don't. Don't.
I know Emily wanted lemon, but, uh, I was just toying with a strawberry layer.
you think she'll put up a fight?
what am I doing?
I'm sorry. I just, uh...
this isn't like me, Danny.
my father ditched my mom for another woman. I do not want to do that to Emily.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head since the 4th of July.
Yeah, well...You need to. We both do.
do we? I mean that, honestly.
if we could just talk about all this. - Talk about it? You're getting married!
you're getting married in two weeks, Danny. - I know
I just can't...Help but wonder why you've come into my life when you did.
well, uh...It was good to see you.
keep the change. - Thank you.
Danny! Wait.
I'll be here Sunday...In case you're free.
okay.
see you.
Hello, Sara.
I should've...Gotten the hint when Daniel blew me off this morning.
I came to surprise him for lunch.
when I saw him pulling out of his parking lot, I followed him here.
how long has it been going on?
this isn't what it looks like, Emily.
Really? So it's just a coincidence that you ran into each other here,- just like at the bakery and
no, Emily, you have misunderstood this whole situation. - Have I really?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I guess it's just the stress of the wedding.
and God, Victoria， she constantly t-- treats me like I'm not good enough.
Oh, she does that to everyone.
not you. I'm sure you're the kind of girl a mother loves.
that's why I feel so threatened by you.
Thanks.
I am not perfect. Okay?
but you have to believe me. I am not a home wrecker.
God, I'm sorry for breaking down on you. - It's okay.
do me a favor-- Don't tell Daniel.
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
you shouldn't be.
thank you.
we want that to be here.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that should work.
Mr. Grayson. I wasn't expecting you.
I didn't think I'd get to read pages so soon.
sadly, you don't.
in fact, you'll have to wait until the book hits the shelves.
since our preliminary discussion, I was offered a more lucrative deal from another publishing company.
you used my generosity to start a bidding war.
Oh, no. No, no. I just...Created my own marketplace.
it's a lesson every young entrepreneur should learn, as referenced in my prologue.
don't forget to pre-order.
how you must miss the grandeur of your last office.
Oh, what we lack in space, we also lack in illegal activity.
you're not still going forward with Margaux?
I told you, she's been investigating last year's events and what happened in '93.
I took your advice and I moved on. These are for you.
since you've always fancied yourself a writer, I thought maybe you could help me brainstorm a title.
sure, but not today. I can't. I'm swamped.
and yet, you still found time to shop for organic berries.
did you pick them yourself?
I stopped by the farmers' market.
all my years on this earth, there is only one thing that's taken me to places I'd otherwise avoid.
I was meeting a friend. - A "friend"? Or an ex?
your mother mentioned that you hired Sara to make your wedding cake.
I thought that an odd choice.
I'm just trying to help get her back on her feet, okay?
I owe her that much after what we put her through.
Wow. How noble of you.
and I think you are ready.
ready for what?
or a Grayson rite of passage. Why don't you come with me into the city?
that family is hiding something.
I've been collecting names of Grayson Global employees.
one of them will be willing to share their account.
I know you're afraid of what Daniel might do, but just...Talk to Nolan.
I mean, if there's a story to tell, he'll tell it.
and if not, there's no need to waste any more time on it.
Yeah, I'll try him tomorrow at the shower.
thanks for letting me vent. - Oh. Of course.
but I need to go back to work.
Yeah. I'll walk you out.
see you later.
Bye. - Bye.
and to think, you owe me for that.
I am a miraculous matchmaker.
if only I could matchmake myself.
you'll find someone.
I can't even find my phone. Figured I'd just buy a new one.
so that's my exciting life.
what's new with you?
not much. But, um.
I wanted to ask you, what do you know about Aiden Mathis?
are you in trouble?
because all I know about him is that's what he handled for my parents.
he dealt with the messes they didn't want to.
why do you ask?
Nolan brought him up. I was just curious.
...is everything okay?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
rule number 17-- No fish for breakfast.
18-- No killing on the premises.
well, to be disregarded if, uh, my life is in danger.
I'll bear that in mind. - Ah.
most importantly, 19-- Always give a heads up call before coming home.
I am on the rebound, so, bitch, don't kill my vibe.
as you can see, some people never follow the "call first" rule.
welcome back.
I am pleased to report that the Maldives eagerly awaits our arrival.
So...twisted, isn't it?
planning a wedding with one guy, - and honeymoon with another?
there won't be a honeymoon if we don't get the final details in place.
primarily, tying Victoria to the murder weapon.
since you've been exiled from Grayson Manor - I could probably help.
no, I don't want your fingerprints on any of this.
look, I can handle this. That's why I'm back here.
um, just keep an eye on Victoria. And considering she hasn't contacted me, she must believe she's got another way of thwarting you and Daniel.
then we'll let her believe that.
right in here.
Sara. How lovely to see you.
I'm sorry I didn't return any of your calls.
Oh, for good reason.
I hear you've been very busy with Daniel.
Oh, please tell me I can scrap these wedding plans.
I can't speak for Danny, but, uh.
as for me...
I'm not gonna help you break up their engagement.
Sara, regret will haunt you if you let Daniel go.
well, I'd rather deal with that than the shame of breaking up a marriage.
there is no shame when it comes to Daniel's best interests.
but who's to say it is?
Emily's sweet, sincere, and exactly what Danny needs.
she loves him just as much as you do, if not more.
I don't know what lies that girl sold you, but she cares about nothing but money and status.
Sara, I can prove it to you. Please?
please give me a chance.
for Daniel's sake, please.
well, if we've owned this place for decades, why is this the first I'm hearing of it?
you haven't yet earned your spot in the club.
soon you'll be married, and your dues will be paid.
how the hell did you keep this from Mom when we were in the red?
because the deed is solely in my name, given to me by my father, whose father gave it to him.
no Mrs. Grayson has ever known about it.
you see, contrary to what they say, the secret to staying happily married is secrecy.
I'm not keeping things from Emily, Dad.
so I guess she knows about your little trip to the farmers' market.
look, Daniel, even titans need a safe harbor from the storms-- Professional or personal.
and you can trust Anderson here to keep the nature of your escapades close to his vest.
I don't want to cheat on my wife.
that's what I'm afraid of, Daniel.
look, I'm gonna put this to you as my father put it to me when he first brought me here
do not marry your mistress.
Emily is your perfect match.
so if you get bored, you know, switch paramours, not wives.
for one thing, it's far more cost-effective.
I mean, not that affairs are cheap.
I spent a pretty penny on a minx from the rainbow room, one.
too many of my secretaries, and let's not forget Lydia.
may she rest in peace.
I can't believe we've reached the day where I give you the keys to this place.
what if I don't want 'em?
well, then I applaud your idealism and say you stand by your morals for as long as you can.
but if you find yourself slipping, just know that this is a place where you can fall...
without regret.
Daniel and I said we weren't gonna exchange gifts at the shower, but this morning I found this in the closet.
can you just estimate its value so I can match the sentiment?
Mm...5k? 7 tops.
slightly modest for a Grayson wedding gift, no?
well, at least it proves that he's back on track, now that Sara's out of the equation.
how can you be so sure?
I checked his phone.
she hasn't returned any of his texts since my little breakdown yesterday.
God, I wish I could cry on a dime.
it would help sell my performance at your wedding.
for Daniel-- white gold, self-winding, 7k. Done.
Oh, oh! What about this one?
the Logan seafarer.
press a button, it sends out an emergency transmission.
you could be lost in the Bermuda Triangle, and help would come in 30 minutes or less.
that seems a little bit excessive. - I meant for you.
Well.Considering what you're trying to pull off at this wedding, having a plan "B" couldn't hurt.
don't worry. I'm not here for you.
whoever you're here for, you're not welcome-- Not after your last visit.
Jack, I was just trying to protect your family. - NO.
I lost my father at a young age and my sister not long after, so I know the pain of being ripped apart from your own flesh and blood.
it was never my intention to separate you from your son.
okay. let's just hope you've done a better job of thinking things through when it comes to Emily.
are you trying to vet me, Jack?
seems you've gone to great lengths to protect her mission.
but what about her?
it's endearing what you're doing, but you've no right.
I know the two of you had what could only be described as puppy love, but that's the past, and it's forgotten.
I'm the future.
you trying to convince me or yourself?
Oh, I do hope we have your support going forward, Jack, because I don't deal with complications as well as Emily.
thanks for meeting me.
I have no one else to turn to.
I find that hard to believe, as you barely know me.
and I can't imagine I got Jack's recommendation.
I know what you did for my parents, and I need you to do the same for me.
well, what are we talking about exactly?
when I went to Europe, I met this guy.
a photographer.
things happened, and he took some...Artistic shots of me.
nude. - I was in an awful head-space.
some creep stole my phone, found the photos, and now he's blackmailing me.
you do know I don't work for your parents anymore, right?
good. This can't get back to them.
or anyone else, for that matter.
okay. Well, how did he contact you?
by e-mail.
he wants 40 grand.
can you make it go away?
look, I'm.I'm already late to my brother's shower, so... - No.
um, give me your computer.
I'll, um...establish contact. I'll take it from there.
how much is it gonna cost me? - No, don't sweat it.
first one's free.
I'm surprised you got my mother a hostess present.
you playing nice?
it's not for her.
I thought...I thought we said no gifts.
well, now I feel like a jackass. I...I left yours at home.
Oh, you can give it to me later.
Oh, welcome, darlings.
I hope that everything pleases you.
no expense was spared to meet all of your expectations, Emily, and all of your desires, Daniel.
in fact, I hired Ms. Munello to handle today's festivities.
after all, it isn't the worst idea to get a taste of what's to come.
it took some time for my brother to find someone who'd put up with him.
and I get that. He can be annoying.
but he's still my best friend.
so, Emily, be good to him, or you'll have me to deal with.
to Daniel and Emily.
to Daniel and Emily. Cheers.
Cheers.
I see you drank to that. - Mm.
refills? - I'll get us all one.
that was lovely, Charlotte. Thank you.
I meant every word.
ms. Grayson? Someone phoned for you.
excuse me.
well, now who's the stalker?
well, at least I have a legitimate excuse. - Do you?
when I saw you yesterday, you didn't mention you'd be working the party.
well, uh, it was a last-minute offer, and, well, I couldn't afford to say no.
Mm. Well, just so long as you're working for my mother and not with her.
why would you say that?
because she seems abnormally giddy today, and that usually means she's up to something.
I should get back to work.
it's not like we can't talk to each other, Sara.
we're not doing anything wrong.
it's the fact that we want to.
hello again, Sara.
em, can you believe these little things?
they're like cakes for elves.
Wow. Sara really can do it all, can't she?
thanks to you, I know our wedding's gonna be perfect.
gather around, everyone.
we're going to play a little game.
Conrad, Daniel, come here.
since when does my mother play games?
I know you were expecting somebody far prettier, but Charlotte sends her regrets.
I take it you brought the phone?
look, man, my deal's with the girl.
well, I'm her representative. You can give it to me.
not until I see the money, I'm not.
Okay,$40, 000, right? - Uh-huh.
you see, I'm not sure that that's very fair.
Oh? Well, see, uh, TMZ, they're-- They're willing to pay almost as much.
you know, they pay top dollar for celeb nudie photographs.
Yeah, but what's the price for a girl's innocence?
that slut is anything but innocent.
you know that's someone's little girl.
that's someone's sister.
whatever your thing is, I don't-- Aah!
Hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!
remember what I said about complications, Jack?
don't be one.
Jack, leave him alone.
while I'm not the type to partake in wedding shower games, my wife insisted.
and as my son will soon learn, your wife not only dictates the games you play and the rules, but somehow she always wins.
and today, she has conjured up her own modest version of "This Is Your Life."
and we invite you to take a trip with Daniel down memory Lane.
now as many of you know, I'm writing my memoirs. - Ah, how's that for a shameless plug?
and in doing so, I've been recalling Danny's many nicknames.
he was "Graystroke" at Harvard,"Boone" at summer camp, and in high school, his lacrosse team dubbed him...
"Ankle-breaker," 'cause he broke mine during J. V.playoffs.
how you doing?
good to see you.
well done.
Conrad screwed me over.
a feeling you must be all too familiar with.
seems all your hardships began after Grayson Global's acquisition of Nolcorp.
my problems started long before that, kitten.
and as much as I would love to scapegoat Conrad for them, it's not my style.
but take it from someone who was on the inside.
there's nothing about Grayson Global that's worth writing in a bathroom stall, let alone in a book.
end of story.
she was your ninth grade Latin teacher. - Too bad.
it seems it's time I moved on.
smart girl.
I am just so happy to be here.
good to see you. - I'm so proud. -Take care.
Emily, come join me, will you?
well, it breaks my heart that Emily has so few friends and family, especially since moments like these should be shared by loved ones.
finding someone to participate today was no easy feat, but...
I did stumble upon a very old acquaintance.
he's very handsome, a bit of a silver fox, and extremely wealthy.
surely you haven't forgotten that.
hmm? - After all...
he was your husband.
what?
I can't believe it.
what are you doing, Victoria?
never do you write or call. I see now why.
how busy you must be with this young one.
how I missed you so.
this is a joke, right? - It's not what you think.
it was a marriage of convenience.
Oh. I hadn't realized that.
it wasn't my most honest moment, but...
I did it to help Rohan. - Oh? With what?
true love.
I was being in danger of deportation, and I had just fallen for someone.
I helped Rohan obtain his green card so that he could stay with his partner Benny. Hi!
you told me on the phone that the marriage was a disaster and left you penniless.
you said that?
well, my English sometimes up and down.
it was Ro who almost bled me dry in the brief time that we were together.
he's never been good with money.
he still isn't. - But enough of me.
to Emily, who helped me find love. How happy I am that she has found hers.
I am on the pins and needles for you and Daniel.
it means "excited," yes?
Victoria, what a thoughtful gift.
I must find a way to repay you.
Daniel, I should've told you.
just by the time we were engaged, I...
I felt awkward bringing it up.
I should've known that your mother would try to use it against me.
well, yeah, that's what she does.
you took it in stride, though.
well, I guess I'm getting used to it.
I'd love for you to meet Rohan. - Yes.
so now you've seen her ability to spin the truth.
hers or yours?
I should never have come here.
I was naive...or hopeful.
Yeah, maybe you're right that Emily and Danny won't work out, but it won't be her fault.
you cannot be fooled by that girl.
you think you're protecting your son...
but your psycho obsession's only hurting him.
let him go.
I'm gonna do the same.
good-bye, Victoria.
so GREAT TO SEE YOU, EMILY.
hard TO BELIEVE YOU'RE NEARING THE END OF YOUR MISSION.
takeda WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD.
thank YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR HELP.
so...
ro, you were schooled in revenge, too?
when I first went to Japan, Rohan was training with Takeda.
he's since completed his mission.
Oh. Well, how did yours end?
is the person who wronged you in jail?
dead? Worse?
we're taught once our goal's complete not to mention it again.
don't brag after a shag. Got it.
though the whole green card thing, I assume that was part of today's act.
no, no. Emily actually did that for me.
thanks to her, I found happiness after revenge.
I hope she'll find the same.
so you were married, but you weren't a gold digger?
no, no. Rohan made his fortune long before we met.
not by digging gold, but mining rubies.
Ooh, I almost forgot...
you bought the seafarer. Rad.
I was hoping you could set it in something more suitable for a bride.
a ruby, perhaps?
red is her favorite color.
it'll be my wedding present to you.
Benny's waiting.
thank you. Bye.
when you confessed to Bizzy Preston about your marriage, you knew that Victoria would take the bait and spend the next two weeks chasing her tail.
and anyone who was there today can testify to how desperate Victoria was to destroy my engagement.
the evidence does keep piling up.
this is gonna be one hell of a wedding.
I wasn't sure you got my text.
I only came to say that I won't be making your wedding cake.
And.good-bye. - What?
is this-- Is this because I accused you of working with my mother?
if.If so, I'm sorry. - No, no. Please don't be.
you weren't wrong.
okay, for the past two weeks, she's been trying to snake charm me into coming between you and Emily, and-- And I couldn't do that.
especially after what I saw today.
Oh, well, after what I saw, I don't think I can go through with this wedding.
and it took until today to realize that Emily and my mother are the same person, and I do not wanna marry my mother.
can I show you something?
remember this?
I gave it to you that summer.
I never told you, but...
after the accident, I thought I'd lost you.
I spent that night pacing the hospital halls.
by the time the doctors came by to tell me that you were stable, the diamond had cut into my palm from clenching it so tightly.
I mean, I didn't even realize the E. M.T. s had given it to me.
you held onto it all this time.
I never...thought you'd allow me the chance to return it.
we can't undo our past, Danny. - I know.
I just don't wanna forget it, either.
can I?
I'm not asking you to commit to anything.
I just can't commit to Emily, not when I feel this way about you.
I won't risk losing you again.
no. No, no, no. No, we can't do this.
okay? Not until you've spoken to her.
we won't. We won't.
I just don't wanna say good night.
someone had the daft idea of sending these here after the shower.
and I thought that you might want to take these home so you could get an early start on your thank-yous.
it seems you could've had your staff - bring them down to my house.
Oh, yes, but there's one gift I wouldn't trust anyone to deliver.
but you've already given me the greatest gift, Victoria.
it was lovely to see Rohan again.
Emily.Had I known that you were keeping such a secret from Daniel。
that is what you were banking on, isn't it?
Yes. You've always known that I doubted your devotion to my son.
and I've never questioned his until now.
what's this?
you see, for years, the Grayson men have had a little pied terre near the Met.
and they've passed it down from generation to generation, one after another have strutted around, thinking their wives were clueless about their liaisons.
but we've always known if we wished to.
and we've passed that little card to each new future Mrs. Grayson as a sort of wedding gift.
well, I appreciate the gesture, Victoria, but Daniel and I are nothing like you and Conrad.
we're more alike than you think.
go on.
see for yourself.
hello again, Mrs. Grayson. It seems your son and his lady friend have settled in for the night.
is there anything else I can do for you?
Anderson, can we get some more ice, please?
right away, Mr. Grayson.
no. That'll be all.
you alone? - Yeah.
Daniel's in the city.
good,'cause I wanna talk to you. It's about your sister.
okay.
some guy stole her phone. He was apparently blackmailing her with it.
is she okay?
she's fine, because your boyfriend beat the hell out of him in my bar.
Aiden did? - Brutally.
and I can see from your reaction that he hasn't told you.
now you told me it's none of my business what happens when this is all over.
but how well do you know Aiden?
I thought this was about my sister.
where did you meet him?
we trained together.
we're a lot alike. He lost his family, too.
so I heard.
what do you want, Jack?
I wanna know that you know what you're doing.
of course I do.
would you even tell me if you didn't?
you were always secretive.
even when we were kids, and you'd see a shooting star, you'd never tell me what you wished for.
I realize now it's not because you didn't think it was gonna come true.
it's because...You're afraid.
of what? - Of letting people in.
you know, maybe I was a lot smarter then, because had I not told you the truth, who I really am, maybe you wouldn't hate me right now.
I could never hate you.
and not for lack of trying.
it's just, after seeing Aiden today, I...
I think you deserve more than you're getting.
you don't even know him.
and to be honest, you don't know me.
not anymore.
you're right.
you wanna know what I used to wish for?
that nothing would ever change.
you didn't call first. What if I'd had company?
well, looks like you already got rid of them.
or you didn't.
should I be concerned?
turns out I didn't need to be inside Grayson manor to play my part.
I borrowed Charlotte's laptop, got her I. P.address, Wi-Fi code, mummy's credit card details.
now you tell me. But...
that's everything we need to set up Victoria as the buyer of the murder weapon.
I, uh, assume Emily knows you took advantage of her baby sis?
I merely took advantage of an opportunity whilst helping Charlotte.
there was no need to pester Emily with the details.
look, this isn't gonna be a thing, is it?
you giving me guilt about how I need to openly communicate with my girlfriend?
no. I just.
good, because there's something I need you to do, and it's incredibly important.
this stays between you and me.
the Choices We Make?
Daniel, uh, chose it.
simple but profound, considering the lesson I've been trying to pass down to him.
and what is that exactly?
Discretion...is essential in all facets of life.
you know, I may have single-handedly saved Daniel's relationship with Emily.
I think that you might have some rewrites to do once he calls off this wedding.
are you still in denial about how your transparent shower stunt backfired?
Oh, come on. I know you were rooting for the other woman.
not surprising, considering you were one.
thank God those days are over.
do you remember that terribly obvious bachelor pad you took me to?
Oh, I...I got rid of that place years ago.
I'm all yours now, darling. - Pity.
we need to talk. - Me first.
but you already gave me a watch.
well, this wasn't planned.
but before you open it, I have something to confess to you, Daniel.
I followed you.
I saw you and Sara at the farmers' market yesterday.
after you left, I confronted her.
and I broke down on that poor girl.
you know I trust you.
I just...Couldn't get a hold of my emotions.
it was so unlike me that I realized something else must be going on.
so I went to the doctor.
are you okay?
I'm great.
as it turns out...
we're pregnant.
look.
Hey. Sorry I missed you earlier.
you want to, uh, you wanna come by tonight?
I can't. I have a last minute meeting in the city.
that sounds mysterious. - It is.
someone contacted me, claiming to know enough about Conrad to fill a book of their own.
probably some lunatic looking for cash.
after my disappointing chat with Nolan Ross today, my fervor for the story is dying.
well, that's too bad.
well, not if it means more time for nightcaps with you.
good night, Jack. - Good night.
Ah, you made it.
thanks for meeting with me, Ms. Davis.
it's Lydia.
and believe me, the pleasure is all mine.
daddy!
when I was a child, my father was framed for a crime he didn't commit.
daddy! - Amanda!
dad threw us a curveball.
I won't be fully vested in the company until I get married.
I love her, so why wait?
you don't remember me, do you, amanda? - Should i?
I interviewed you for my book about your father.
quite the collection.
hundreds of hours of one-on-one interviews.
No! No!
victoria gave birth to a baby girl-charlotte.
ask her who the father is.
some say that our lives are defined by the sum of our choices.
but it isn't really our choices that distinguish who we are.
it's our commitment to them.
victoria only came to the courtroom twice.
once for the day of her testimony, and then...
on the day that I was sentenced.
on that day, she brought the baby- charlotte- so beautiful.
her eyes were so familiar.
I barely heard the judge when he told me that I would never leave this prison alive.
losing amanda was hard enough.
the thought of losing two daughters at once, it was... It was unbearable.
I think that's enough for today.
so charlotte grayson is your sister?
if my father was right.
but what I don't understand is, why wouldn't he write that in his journals?
why trust treadwell with that information and no one else?
maybe he wasn't certain.
which is why i'm gonna find out or the graysons are gonna find out for me.
okay, I'll bite.
what are you gonna do with the tapes?
one of them's gonna blow up victoria's divorce.
the other ones are gonna be found on amanda.
to frame her for torching casa treadwell?
she didn't give me much choice.
so the fact that charlotte might be your sister makes absolutely no difference to you?
half sister, and...
no, it doesn't.
what about jack?
Jack is in love with a killer. I've gotta get rid of amanda.
well, he thinks he's in love with you.
meanwhile, poor puppy dog daniel actually is.
so where, pray tell, does your heart stand in all this?
my feelings are irrelevant.
look, I came here for revenge, and you offered to help.
if you can't stomach it anymore, then how about you at least spare me your passive-aggressive judgments?
Conrad's got a half dozen offshore entities holding multicurrency bank accounts in denmark and spain.
you got a ballpark?
$500 million give or take.
when were they established?
within the last ten years.
making them community property now that we voided the prenup.
there's something else he's withholding.
the s. e.c. Is sniffing around, looking at the company's trading practices.
so there's a bit of a ticking clock to get whatever liquid assets we can before a potential scandal blows up.
I told you, daniel would come through.
this should make today's mediation session all the more interesting. Victoria.
well, it looks like your father's deceit is good news for both of us.
how so?
because thanks to you, i'm poised to get what's rightfully mine, and you won't have go through your impetuous plan to marry emily.
mom... Even if marrying her didn't activate my trust, i'd still do it.
I love her, mom.
and if you truly care about my happiness, you'll find a way to love her, too.
heard you guys went to paint the town.
you made it back just before the storm.
how was atlantic city?
went big, lost big.
emphasis on the lost... And the big.
what are you doing here?
well, amanda and I made plans to go for breakfast last week.
wondered if you'd forget.
you know how I feel about breakfast - The most important meal of the day.
all right, well, you two go ahead and have fun.
okay, what's so important that you couldn't wait until I was on dry land?
Mason treadwell's house burned to the ground the night that you left town.
karma really is a bitch.
more like victoria grayson is. I think she's the one who did it.
are you serious? She doesn't exactly look like the type.
looks are always deceiving with victoria.
she despises treadwell and she despises you, too.
you need to leave town, lay low for a little while.
what? Why?
because victoria hates me, and you're pretending to be me.
if she can burn down a house, she can definitely pin it on you, or worse...
someone that you care about.
babe, we've survived a lot worse than ms. Moneybags.
and I can take care of myself... And jack.
Declan. - Look, I'm sorry I'm late.
you want to order something?
no. That's okay. I filled up on beer nuts.
it's the breakfast of champions.
do you want to tell him or can i?
tell me what?
Charlotte and I were talking about the future, your future.
Yeah, what about it?
you've been through a lot lately.
I know you lost your father and that you and your brother struggle to make ends meet.
so how would you like to join charlotte at collins prep this fall?
I'd love to, but... I don't have the money or the grades.
and what if I told you, the tuition's already paid for? The grades are up to you.
you've made things easier for my daughter lately, and I just want to repay you by making things a little easier for you.
and that's the deal?
that is the deal. - Mr. Grayson.
thank you. - You're welcome.
now all you have to do is pass the entrance exam.
that's amazing. - Think you can pass?
do you think I can pass?
you're gonna.
I don't know what to say, sir. Thank you.
seriously. We're going to school together.
this is gonna be awesome.
let's get right to this, shall we?
there have been some rather interesting discoveries in our research into Mr. Grayson's finances.
there have also been some interesting discoveries about your client's past indiscretions.
any infidelities my client may have participated in, from a legal standpoint, was voided by your client's affair with ms. Davis.
I'm afraid we're talking about a much more serious breach of trust here, ryan.
do you know the name of my favorite aunt, the one who raised me?
well, victoria does.
on the day that she was supposed to testify, she fell ill.
weeks later, she gave birth to a baby girl.
she named her charlotte, same as my aunt.
I think that she did it to send me a message that the little girl she was raising with conrad is mine.
where did you get this?
my dear... That's hardly the issue.
we will be ordering a paternity test.
and if charlotte isn't mine,
I can assure you that the only way you're gonna keep this from the media is to walk away from this sham of marriage with whatever I deign to give you, which won't include the grayson name, by the way.
when we're done with all of this, you're gonna be back to victoria harper, which is only fitting considering you'll once again be the desperate, penniless little bitch you were when I first met you.
you've breached our disclosure contract, victoria...
and not for the first time.
how do you expect me to represent you when I can't even trust you?
I told you, I had an affair.
but you didn't tell me it was with david clarke or that charlotte could possibly be his daughter.
what are you doing?
well, our late head of security had a number of subcontractors he hired for various tasks.
looks like I'm gonna be needing one of them.
for what?
Mason thinks that his tapes were destroyed in a fire, but I know damn well it was deliberately set in order to cover the theft.
by whom?
Ashley. Please invite amanda clarke up this afternoon for tea.
do not take no for an answer.
Emily? What are you doing in here?
Jack, I-i'm so sorry. I... Was looking for amanda.
she was, uh, she was summoned to the grayson manor for tea with victoria.
Really? What's that about?
well, given how much the graysons hated her dad, i'd say nothing good.
after what that girl's been through...
you really care about her, don't you?
Yeah.
thank you, by the way, for being so nice to her.
it means a lot.
I'll, uh, i'll tell her you stopped by.
Hey, jack.
be careful.
the storm's coming in quickly.
the strawberries were picked fresh from my garden this morning.
delicious.
so you're no longer allergic?
I remember a company picnic where one bite sent you straight to the emergency room.
your father was beside himself.
fortunately, I outgrew that.
well, then by all means, have some creme fraiche with it.
I love summer storms. Don't you?
not really.
let me be direct.
Mason tells me, you claim I had a relationship with david clarke.
you don't honestly believe that, do you?
I remember what I remember.
which is?
same as you, most likely.
well, I have to confess that after all these years, my memory is just a little bit foggy of those times.
you remembered my strawberry allergy just fine.
actually, when I come to think of it, i'm not all that certain that little girl was you.
all right. Why don't you cut the crap and tell me what I'm really doing here?
Mason believes that you have some sort of vendetta against us.
and this dovetails very nicely with this uncanny sense I have that his house didn't just burn down accidentally.
word on the street is, you lit that match so you could pin it on me.
is that so?
well, then maybe you should tell me why you sent that tape to my husband.
is it money you're after?
I don't know what you're talking about.
and apparently, neither do you.
sit down.
I don't take orders from you.
okay. I'm here right now. Yeah.
the spoon.
I'll have the lab rush this right through.
there's no way that girl is david clarke's daughter.
well, we'll know soon enough.
Victoria, I just got off the phone with conrad's lawyer.
the preliminary results from charlotte's d. n.a. Test are in.
he's not the father.
sorry to interrupt. Your mom wanted me to let you know that your dad's on his way over with his lawyer in case you wanted to run for the hills.
okay, just, uh, just let her know I won't be here.
are you proposing to emily?
don't say anything to my mother, all right?
she doesn't need to know until emily says yes.
you think she will?
well, after your lengthy courtship, who wouldn't?
you sound about as happy as my mom does.
what happened to being emily's best friend?
Daniel... You picked a really lovely ring.
despite the d. n.a. Results, mr. Grayson has no intention of voiding charlotte's trust fund.
how very generous of you.
she's not to blame, after all.
she does realize that means we're done with the idea of mediation?
you really want a protracted trial?
you know you'll both be skewered in the media.
no, somehow I think it's my soon-to-be ex-wife who's gonna draw the most unflattering spotlight.
I need to speak with her in private.
that might not be the best idea. - No, I would advise against that.
it's not a request.
must you drag charlotte into all this?
me? That's rich.
here are your options, and they are limited
a," you accept the pittance i'm prepared to offer you in exchange for avoiding a trial or "b,"we take this to court, and it becomes common knowledge that charlotte is the daughter of the most hated in america, meaning you had a torrid love affair with a terrorist.
david clarke was no terrorist, and he was twice the man you ever were.
well, you're gonna have a very hard time convincing the rest of the world of that.
so what's it gonna be, victoria,"a" or "b"?
I did everything you asked for, and now you're prepared to throw your children to the wolves and leave me with nothing all because of your wounded pride?
I'll instruct barbara to send over my final proposal.
reject it, and whatever happens to charlotte will be on your hands.
bloody hell.
it's a little early to be lighting all the candles.
what, you're afraid I'm gonna burn the place down?
okay, okay. Look... You've been like this ever since your tea with victoria.
you gonna tell me what happened?
the bitch practically accused me of burning down treadwell's house. That's what happened.
she what? That's insane.
Yeah, what's even more insane is that emily tried to warn me she'd do it.
I should've listened to her from the beginning.
beginning of what?
Oh, great job buddy. - Crap.
sorry. Do you have a broom or anything?
I'll be right back.
chatty cathy.
zip it.
Jack can't know about anything that emily's told you.
she's barely told me anything.
I'm practically as in the dark as jack is.
well, listen, emily's been nothing but good to you.
Really? A few days ago, emily earwigs me into getting all up in mason's grill, and then coincidentally, his house burns to the ground?
great questions... For emily.
so till you get some answers, keep jack out of it.
Hey, daddy.
Declan's so blown away by your offer that we've spent the entire day prepping for the exams.
no. What's wrong?
well, charlotte, we need to talk.
What'd she do this time?
Oh, no. It's just...
I'm going to be making some changes over the next few weeks.
it's the end of the summer, and things are heating up for me at the office so I'm gonna be going back and forth to the city more and more.
so what does that mean?
I'm saying, it's not practical for you to stay with me.
but I'm supposed to live with you.
I thought you were buying another house here.
I know that was the plan, but I think it's best if you go back to your mother's.
I can't stand her, daddy. You know that.
then you need to work on that. You're not a child anymore, charlotte.
it's time you start growing up.
okay, just a little further.
you recognize where we are?
it's where I spilled my drink on your jacket.
you really kept it.
man of my word.
well, so much for good first impressions.
that was a perfect impression, as was your second and your third.
you know, most men in this town would've thrown me off the boat.
you were... So sweet about it.
you know, most people look at me and see me for someone I'm not.
and I spent the first part of my life either disappointing them or worse...
living up to their expectations.
you're the first person that I could be my true self around.
lucky me.
I know we haven't known each other for very long, and we've had to deal with some pretty unexpected things in a short amount of time.
sort of like this weather.
you think one storm's passed, and another one's on the horizon...
which is why I'm sure about the way I feel for you, 'cause as long as I have you... I'm not stopping.
good.
no one's ever made me feel as loved and as safe and understood as you do.
if you let me...
I'd like to spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you've made me.
Emily thorne, will you marry me?
Yes.
if only I could've controlled the weather.
perfectly romantic.
romance is never perfect.
but don't let me rain on anyone's parade.
mom, hi. Sorry. We were just...
it's obvious what you were doing, sweetheart.
Hello, emily. - Victoria.
you two look like coconspirators. Don't tell me you've...
yet, I see that you have.
mom, we were just coming to give you some good news.
and what news is that?
Victoria... - Mom...
did you tell your father? I'm sure he will be thrilled.
no, you're the first, then charlotte, then dad.
come on, mom. Be happy for us.
Congratulations.
Ashley davenport... Slumming it.
vodka soda, please. House is fine.
you got it. House vodka? Ash, talk to me.
well, if you must know, I've basically shunned my best friend all summer in favor of worming my way aboard the "s. s. Queen victoria
only to find out that it's a sinking ship.
how so?
all I've got to show for my summer with the graysons is a gun-wielding psychotic ex-boyfriend who made out with you.
meanwhile, emily gets an engagement ring and the keys to the kingdom.
wait. Emily... Said yes?
according to her text.
I'm gonna go to the loo and drown myself in it.
it's back there.
did I hear that right?
I'm afraid you did.
you wanna pour another one for yourself, my treat?
I'm on the clock.
what time you done?
maybe I can give you a ride home.
I am home. I live upstairs.
even more convenient.
with my boyfriend. You enjoy your drink.
Hello, dad.
Where's charlotte?
she wasn't in her room. I sent her home.
home? Why?
because that's where she belongs.
why do you need her?
I've asked emily to marry me.
she said yes. - I see.
and is ms. Thorne at all aware that she's just part of a scheme for you to get your hands on your share of the company?
see, I'm not half the fool your mother has clearly painted me out to be.
okay, okay, look, I know that you're bitter over everything that's happened between you and mom.
bitter doesn't even begin to cover it.
but assuming you were ever in love, there has to be a part of you that still remembers how you felt when you first met her.
that's how I feel about emily.
you're right.
I fell in love with her, daniel, and I fell hard.
my first marriage was already a disaster when I walked into that little art gallery in the village and I saw your mother for the first time.
and, yeah, I'm sure I felt about her then the same way you think you feel about emily now.
except I'd never treat emily the way you're treating mom.
no, no, no, you say that, but you'll be at each other's throat in the end.
you'll see. You'll cheat on her, she'll cheat on you, and then one day, you'll find out she's been keeping a secret so big, it'll destroy your whole family.
what secret? Wh-what are you talking about?
well, you know, you're so cozy with your mommy, why don't you let her tell you?
I'm sorry to bother you. I was looking for daniel.
and he was looking for you. He went to the southfork inn.
is everything okay?
my dad just kicked me out. I have no idea what I did.
everything was fine, he offered to pay for declan's school, and then just out of the blue...
I've just never seen him look at me that way before.
what way?
the way he looks at my mom.
Oh, my god. Emily...
did daniel propose?
Yeah. He wanted to tell you himself.
is that okay?
you have no idea how badly I've always wanted a sister.
at this late an hour, you must be bearing bad news.
that depends.
the lab compared amanda's d. n.a. Samples to charlotte's.
And? - They're a match.
they're definitely half sisters.
that means she really is amanda clarke.
I don't believe it.
there is something more serious I need to discuss with you, victoria, about my services and your legal affairs.
allow me to help you, mr. Huntley.
you're fired.
what the hell are you doing?
you don't want to mess with me, bro. I was just leaving.
no, you're not going
you shoulda listened.
Jack, are you up there? Jack, is everything okay?
Oh, my god.
Jack. Jack. Oh, no. No.
what happened?
Jack got the crap beat out of him.
he stumbled upon some guy rifling through amanda's stuff looking for, presumably, a set of hi8 videotapes.
victoria did this.
no. You did this when you planted treadwell's tapes.
I never meant for jack to get hurt.
how much collateral damage are you willing to accept?
I may have jack's blood all over my jacket, but you've got it all over your hands.
I have something I need to do.
Yeah. Don't you always?
nice ring.
I told you jack porter was off-limits. What happened?
victoria called in her own guy. There was nothing I could do.
you were supposed to control it.
they got to you, didn't they?
no. Your father did.
I told him his best shot at a new trial would mean pulling you in.
he refused. He was afraid of what the conspiracy might do to keep you silenced.
you're lucky I intercepted that d. n.a. Test she ordered on amanda.
if I hadn't switched the sample, you'd be finished.
I know.
thank you.
you know I believe your father is innocent, but I can't be part of this kind of violence.
maybe it's time you reassess what you're doing here.
I'm so sorry, jack.
we need to talk.
no kidding. I've got about a gajillion questions for you.
I know you've been keeping secrets from me.
you have about five seconds to start talking.
the graysons framed my father.
they were responsible for that plane going down.
they set him up to take the fall.
are you serious?
while I was rotting away in juvie with you and my father was rotting away in federal prison, the graysons were sitting in that house...
living their lives, spending their money...
raising their kids...
like nothing ever happened.
so that's why I'm here.
I came back to avenge my father's death...
and to take everything away from them.
why didn't you tell me?
I- if you woulda told me, I
because I didn't want something like this to happen.
the graysons hired that guy who beat up jack.
and now you're both in danger.
they did this to him?
you need to go to save yourself... And jack...
and if you care to... me.
you know I'd do anything for you.
this is your new cell phone.
I'm gonna need your old one.
your fake i. d. And passport are in your bag.
that just leaves... - Jack.
I can't say good-bye to him.
then I'll do it for you.
you're up late.
how did your father take the news?
he took it like you'd expect.
except he said something else that... I can't get out of my head.
what's that?
well, basically, the reason why he's being so nasty is because of some secret you've been keeping.
Oh, we all have secrets, daniel.
mom... It's me. All right? So whatever it is, you don't have to keep me in the dark.
well, the truth is inevitable, daniel, and I do want to tell you myself.
but I just don't want you to think less of me.
that's impossible, mom. Just tell me.
it's about your sister.
okay. Well, what - What about her?
Conrad's not her father.
who's charlotte's father?
all I wanted to... Was to protect charlotte from the truth. That's all I wanted.
what did he do to you, mom?
please. I can't talk about this.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, mom. Come here.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
Oh, god, mom. I am so sorry.
Amanda's gone.
Yeah, well, kudos to you. Looks like the ends finally justified the means.
or should I say meanness?
are you finished?
I don't know. Are you?
I'll never be finished.
but after what happened to jack, I...
I think it's clear that I need to minimize the fallout from what I'm doing.
I think it's a good time to press "pause" on all of this.
and do what?
regroup.
maybe there's a better way to level victoria than by marrying her son.
and... What do you plan to do with daniel?
I'm gonna give him his ring back.
tell him that... I need to give marrying into his family some more thought...
which is actually kind of true.
for once.
baby steps.
don't do that.
Hey, you're up, finally.
Where's amanda?
she's gone, jack.
what do you mean, gone?
I don't understand.
I'm so sorry, man.
Where-where- Where would she go?
where were you this morning?
walking on the beach.
sweetheart... I know how much what your father's done has hurt you, but I'm so happy you've come back home.
let's talk about it. - no.
Charlotte, please, please - Mom, just don't.
I told them we were retiring for the evening.
but we do have to give our statements in the morning.
are you okay?
of course not.
what we did was despicable.
but necessary. You know that.
I love you, victoria.
I know that, too.
I can't bear being alone right now.
will you stay with me tonight?
I'd like that very much.
for some, commitment is like faith...
a chosen devotion to another person or an intangible ideal.
but for me, commitment has a shadow side, a darker drive that constantly asks the question...
how far am I willing to go?
I woke up, and you were gone again.
we're gonna have to do something about that.
well, you crawled into bed so late, I thought I'd let you sleep a bit.
I know. I-i'm sorry.
I should - I should've never gone to see my dad. I should've stayed with you.
is everything okay?
I found out why my parents' divorce is so contentious.
turns out my dad isn't really charlotte's father.
Oh, my god, daniel.
and that's not even the worst of it.
her biological father is that madman who used to live in your house
Amanda's father, the terrorist.
does charlotte know?
no. I don't think my mom ever... Intends to tell her.
the truth is too horrible.
because of what david clarke was accused of or because your mom was unfaithful to your father?
no, that's just it.
she wasn't unfaithful.
that bastard forced himself on her.
I've never seen my mother like that.
are you saying that... He raped her?
and got pregnant with charlotte as a result.
she said this to you?
if that son of a bitch wasn't rotting in hell, i'd drag him down and kill him myself.
anyway, I don't want to think about it anymore.
so what got you up so early this morning.
looks like you've done some... Heavy thinking of your own.
I have.
how's june for the wedding?
you still want to marry into my crazy family?
more than ever.
Emily, this is my grandfather - Edward grayson.
I know you were in love with amanda's father.
mom, What is he talking about?
david clarke isn't just amanda's father. He's your biological father as well.
I am suggesting that you step down as c. e.o.and we groom your son to take your place.
as you were warned, revenge is a stony path.
fire & ice. Was fire and brimstone not available?
there comes a moment in each of our lives when the control that keeps us sane slips through our fingers.
most of us aim to seize it back.
the best way to fight chaos is with chaos.
why are we wasting time tearing apart an empty motel room?
there's nothing here.
Amanda must have taken the box with her.
and left her phone behind?
she's not the one who stole it, nolan.
she didn't know where I kept the box.
and if she did, she wouldn't have done this to me. She's too loyal.
who are you calling?
we're about to find out.
speak of the devil.
or should I say the devil's daughter.
your father had excellent penmanship, by the way.
Tyler. I thought they locked you up.
more like put me up.
spring haven hospital for the criminally insane.
I can't believe this.
Hey, nolan. How's the arm?
what do you want, tyler?
you know, I haven't decided yet. Money would be nice.
but then again, so would vindication.
how's danny? Excited for the party tomorrow night?
you'll never get close enough to find out.
I'm crushed that you don't want me there.
stay by your phone.
and if you do anything rash, like, uh, cancel the engagement party or call the cops, you can kiss your friend here good-bye.
do me a favor. Next time you want to get a 17-year-old girl drunk, don't do it here.
none of this would've happened if you hadn't stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
and for what, some crazy girl you met for one summer a hundred years ago?
she set a dude's house on fire, jack.
that guy deserved it. And don't get me started on what the graysons deserve.
man, you're really losing it, you know that?
sounds like your voice, jack, so I'm guessing I got the right number.
this is father rick calling from port-au-prince.
last time we spoke, you were busy settling your dad's affairs.
I hope that all worked out as best it could.
I'm calling because I received a hefty grant to raise a grade school and thought, if you were still interested, you might want to head up the project.
if your plate's still full, fine.
but this is an opportunity to do some real good, son.
it'd be great to have you down here.
who would you rather sit next to at the engagement party, the paulsons or the craigs?
we're fiddling while rome burns, are we?
the paulsons.
the craigs it is then.
why are you still here, conrad, to gloat?
you already destroyed any chance I had at explaining myself to charlotte. Congratulations. You win.
not exactly. My father's threatened to oust me from the board if you and I can't reach a quiet settlement.
you might have to answer to him, but I do not.
and if it takes bloodying you on wall street to get what I'm owed, so be it.
well, who the hell are you to play hardball when your safety net just stormed out of the house tonight looking none to eager to ever speak with you again?
Daniel will come back to me.
he always does.
there you are.
Daniel. What are you doing?
waiting for you.
were you able to get ahold of charlotte?
she's with declan.
she didn't want to talk. She sounded drunk.
I'm so sorry.
is that her?
no.
your grandfather.
third one tonight.
Daniel, he's grooming you to become the next c. e.o. Of grayson global. That is huge.
I don't even want to go to the engagement party tomorrow night let alone take over the family business.
it's a really big deal. You should at least just sit down and hear what he has to say.
fine. But can't we just cancel the damn party?
trust me, nothing would make me happier.
but hundreds of people are traveling hundreds of miles to be here.
you're right.
just promise me one more time... No secrets of any kind, ever.
you've seen what they've done to my family.
let's go to bed. It's late.
I'm right behind you.
she's not who you think she is, you know?
Yeah, she's you. And you're her.
and her... And her, and her.
and they call me crazy.
I mean, she's not a bad person.
she does stuff to people, but it's for the right reasons.
Really? Do you recognize this guy?
victoria grayson planted his interview tapes on me so she could frame me for arson.
you mean the tapes that emily copied and stashed away in her little box of secrets?
victoria grayson didn't frame you. Emily did.
that makes no sense.
why, because she's your soul mate, the sister you never had?
Yes.
look. 11 text messages on a phone that I presume used to be yours from one lovesick jack porter, none of which I'm guessing ever found their way to you.
Emily's not your friend, amanda.
she's your competition.
you need more proof?
have at it.
Charlotte, it's me. Your family has been calling nonstop.
you gotta face 'em eventually.
Where's your mouthwash?
it's in the medicine cabinet.
listen, I-I got the number here of a therapist that my buddy went to after his mom died.
well, unfortunately, mine's alive and well.
obviously, losing your mother and finding out that your read dad is not really your dad are two different things, but... I don't know. He said this lady was really helpful, so... I called the office, and they said she had a slot for you this afternoon.
Charlotte, are you listening to me?
give me the number.
southampton surveillance?
it's nolan's security detail.
I figure, after everything that's happened this summer, it's better safe than sorry.
and you owe me a favor.
Why?
Daniel wanted to cancel the party.
no, I'd be ruined.
well, that's what I told him.
did he also tell you how much it would break his mother's heart or does it not matter to him anymore?
why don't I let you two chat, and I can talk about this with you later?
Daniel is a fickle boy, emily. He loves to sit on fences.
I hope when that fence is his opinion of his mother that I can trust you to be my advocate.
well, you haven't made that very easy for me.
well, I realize you and I have had our disagreements, to say the very least.
but if you indeed plan on being part of this family, you need to know that... Blood will always be thicker than water.
Meaning?
meaning that one day, you may or may not become daniel's wife, but I will always be his mother.
Daniel feels betrayed by you.
if you want to rescue that relationship, you're going to have to earn back his trust.
would you facilitate that conversation?
well, that's up to daniel.
excuse me.
this is emily. - Is it?
I thought you'd like to know, that I've decided revenge is a pitiful pursuit and a waste of my fleeting time, so... Let's make a straight-up ransom deal.
you bring a cashier's check to the south strand parking structure at noon, and I'll bring your little box of secrets.
what about amanda?
after we're done, she's... All yours.
Hello, grandpa.
thanks for coming. Sit.
how's your sister doing?
I bet her heart's in a million pieces right about now.
have you spoken with her?
not yet, no. But declan made an appointment for her to go see someone.
someone?
Yeah, a therapist over in bridgehampton.
good for her.
so listen, I've got a job for you.
see all of these names?
these are the investors chirping the loudest about that rumored s. e.c. Investigation and your father's marital woes. See the name at the top of the list?
satoshi takeda.
the good news is that he's here for your engagement party.
and he has requested a private meeting with you this afternoon.
so you're job is to convince him to keep his money put.
you have a problem with that?
your name's grayson, daniel.
the name makes the decision for you.
I accepted father rick's offer.
I set sail tonight, man.
man, this isn't about the fight we had earlier, right? Because I said I'm sorry, okay?
dec, it's not about that at all.
I just-I just feel like my life has gone off track and I gotta... I gotta get it back, man.
and I can't do that here.
do you understand?
Yeah, I do. It's been a weird summer.
and you're nursing a heartache and some broken ribs.
but, jack, haiti?
it's not forever.
it's just a couple of months.
you'll be in school. Bull can take care of the bar.
look... I won't go. If you don't think you'll be okay
Jack, I'm gonna be fine. I'm just gonna miss you.
Charlotte. So where are you off to in such a hurry, young lady?
it wouldn't be to a therapist's office in bridgehampton, now would it?
who told you that?
well, word gets around.
but look, I understand how popular it is these days to kick back on a doctor's couch and purge your problems, but truth be known, more often than not, they cause more harm than good.
how?
if you were tell a stranger that your mother slept with a terrorist, and then that stranger decided to share that information, what do you think would happen to the family's reputation?
when the grayson name loses value... So does the company.
are you willing to gamble away your future for something like that?
if it means not losing my mind, yeah.
well, what about declan's future?
what about declan's future?
I understand the kid flunked his entrance exam to collins prep.
no surprise, I guess, but... From the dean.
now I'm willing to make a call on the young man's behalf, but...
every quid deserves a quo.
you wouldn't happen to have that, uh, therapist's number on you, would you?
miss emily, I thought we had an agreement
hands against the fence, tyler.
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
Where's my money?
I'll let you know when I'm satisfied that everything's here.
Where's amanda?
she can tell you herself when I'm satisfied that you brought my money.
and the box?
the box is in the trunk.
get amanda on the phone.
with pleasure.
you know, that amanda is one loyal customer.
even after everything I showed her about how you played her for a fool, she still wouldn't believe me.
you must have really done a number on her head.
Hey, mandy. I got your b. f.f. Here.
let me talk to her.
Yeah, go for it. She's actually right behind you.
who's the fool now?
Amanda, tyler is crazy.
I don't know what lies he's told you, but you need to listen to me
no, you listen to me. I've sacrificed everything for you.
I gave you my name. And what did you do?
you took away the one thing in my entire life that meant anything to me.
I had to protect jack from all of this.
I was talking about you and me.
are we, uh, done being cathartic over there? Because we're wasting time.
Amanda, don't do this.
good girl.
start the car.
the money.
I wired the funds into an account at the canadian national bank.
you're gonna have to go there to get it.
put that over there.
perfect.
have fun at the party tonight.
I hear there's gonna be fireworks.
new gun? That was fast.
so you're determined to turn this party into a funeral?
I'm determined to be prepared for anything.
you of all people should know how unpredictable tyler can be.
well, then just cancel it, ems.
it's beyond that now.
you got a minute?
one midnight call from a haitian benefactor, and bam, off you go?
so when do you set sail?
tonight.
I should've left months ago, but, well... Life gets in the way.
it does mean I won't be able to make it to your party tonight.
of course, after that last graysons gathering, I don't think anyone's gonna miss me.
so no word from amanda then?
maybe I'm not supposed to hear from her.
maybe... Building this school is the universe's way of setting my priorities straight.
you know, amanda will come back when she's ready.
and when she does, i'll make sure you're the first person she calls.
what about sammy?
well, that's actually why I'm here.
it's a long trip, and he's not exactly a puppy anymore.
I don't know. The way he lights up when he's around you, I thought...
I'd be happy to.
you hear that, old man? Emily's gonna take you in.
back to where it all began.
you be good now, you hear?
Bye, jack. - bye.
shut up.
Bye.
go with him.
Nolan - I am serious.
sail away. Fall in love.
go make little volunteer babies.
you know I can't do that.
at the beginning of the summer, you said you wanted to help me.
if you meant it, you'll make sure he gets on that boat safely tonight.
Emily. - Please.
Jack! Wait up! - Sammy. Stay here.
what is this?
this is the deed to grayson manor.
and what about the shares of the company?
I told you, they were a deal breaker.
I'm not gonna relinquish grayson global, victoria, not to you and not to my father.
Daniel is gonna have his time at the head of the table.
this is not that time.
settle now, and I'm gonna see to it that you get full cash value for all your shares.
well, at least tell me you're gonna think about it.
where have you been? You've been gone all day. Come on.
about to step into a meeting with our old friend takeda.
Takeda? Really? He's back in town?
and coming to the party.
Hey, let me ask you something. These next couple of months, you have any commitments?
just you. Why?
that's all I need to know. I'll see you in a bit.
I'm sorry I'm late.
please.
actually, Mr. Takeda, i'm-i'm not staying.
they sent me here to convince you that grayson global is the place to be...
but if I can't convince myself to stay, how can I convince you?
he said, i'm not sure I flow.
I'm asking my fiancee to run away with me.
and if she says yes, we'll leave tomorrow.
this is is big decion.
very
the office contacts you about my family's comp now if y'll excuse me, I have some travel plans to make.
how do I look?
under medicated.
I can assure you, i'm thinking quite clearly.
not as clearly as emily.
she's probably five steps ahead of you.
not this time.
I know why I want payback.
but why are you going through all this trouble to destroy her?
why not go be a millionaire in canada?
this was never about the money, mandy.
then what?
does the name frank stevens mean anything to you?
should it?
he worked for the graysons.
Emily bashed his skull in and then planted his wallet in my pocket for the cops to find.
you think emily killed that guy?
isn't it obvious?
why else would emily frame me for it if not to distract attention from herself?
so what, you're just gonna... Kill emily?
no. Emily's gonna kill daniel.
or at least that's how it will appear to the cops.
an eye for an eye.
now why don't you get dressed?
you've earned yourself a front-row seat.
Daniel's about to find out exactly how bad his taste in women really is.
last-minute adjustments to your speech?
a long-overdue adjustment to my life.
I called your lawyer and I've agreed to your terms.
I had her send over a messenger with the divorce papers.
you were right, conrad. It's time to end this.
rather poetic timing, don't you think?
see you at the party.
you couldn't have picked a better time to invest, george.
Grayson global's on track for the best quarter in history.
very impressive.
tick tock, cinderella.
time's a-wasting.
suddenly you can't get to the party fast enough.
the faster we get there, the faster it'll be over.
and after it is, I have a surprise for you.
well, I have a surprise for you, too.
your mother asked me to facilitate a detente between you two.
I'm sorry you got put in the middle of all this.
it's what I signed up for.
come on. We're late.
you don't like my taste in dresses?
I'm not going to the party.
don't worry. I won't get in your way.
I can't take that chance.
it's your choice.
there they are, the future mr. And Mrs. Grayson.
well, someone's in a good mood tonight.
I could say the same about you.
I'm engaged to the girl of my dreams. Why wouldn't I be?
well, if it isn't the guests of honor.
don't we look wonderful.
you got a minute to talk?
of course, darling.
sweetheart, I know how upset you are about the misunderstanding we had regarding charlotte.
you mean how you led me to believe her real father raped you?
I never said that.
and if I had any idea that you would...
the truth is that I loved david clarke very much.
God, mom. Just stop.
no, please. I need you to understand how much he meant to me.
save your breath.
I'm not interested in anything else you have to say to me.
after tonight, i'm done with you.
I'm taking emily to paris.
we'll get married and stay there until we choose the life we want to lead, one that doesn't involve grayson manor, grayson global, or anything grayson.
what does emily have to say about this?
you haven't told her, have you?
what makes you think that she'll give up the grayson name and everything that comes with it so easily?
in just three months.
what are you saying? - I'm saying that I know the type.
I was once just like her, ambitious, driven.
Yes, by greed and insecurity.
Emily is generous and decent. She's nothing like you.
well... We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
but don't be surprised if she doesn't give your romantic delusions the warm response that you're hoping for.
I certainly won't be.
well... Bon voyage, my friend.
Sensel.
Yes. To guide your plan back to its righteous path.
a gift.
is this...
how did you get it?
your opponents are dangerous, but careless.
what happened to amanda and tyler?
take the box.
bury your father's secrets away from here.
when you return, your questions will be answered.
Jack, wait.
my god. What are you doing here? What happened to you?
I- I-I don't even know where to begin.
Jack... I'm so sorry.
where are you going?
I'm following through with a plan I should've stuck with a long time ago.
take me with you.
Amanda... I have so many questions.
I know, and you deserve the answers, all of them.
take me with you, and I promise, i'll never leave you again.
what are you doing out here?
just... Getting some air.
come to paris with me. - What?
I - I already bought the tickets. Let's just go.
Daniel, that's crazy.
the further away from my family we are, the more chance we have of doing this right.
I can't. My life is here.
our lives are here. Running away isn't the answer.
well, sometimes, it's the only answer.
there's nothing for me here but secrets and lies.
I'm here. - And why is that exactly?
What-why do you want to marry me, emily?
because I love you.
then come away with me.
where is this coming from? D - did your mother say something?
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, she did.
and you know what? She was right.
Daniel, come back.
Thanks, skipper.
Nolan called me that.
he was kinda my, uh, my half gilligan, half professor.
Nolan wasn't exactly fond of me.
no one in this town is.
except emily.
everyone told me to stay away from you but her.
even as I was getting ready to take off, to sail away, she didn't tell me to give up on you.
just to follow my heart.
hopefully one day, you'll get to know her better.
I, um... I still owe - Owe the guy his fare.
sure. Here.
hurry back.
I love you.
Amanda? - Hurry. Go. Go!
big ed.
will you hang on to this for me?
okay, boss.
Thanks.
Emily. I've been looking everywhere for you.
Where's daniel?
he's walking the beach. We're having a thing.
same thing or different thing?
same thing.
nice night for it.
nice night for what, nolan?
celebrating.
you shouldn't be here.
that makes two of us.
Ems... It's okay. Jack is gone.
she's not worth it.
Hello, danny.
do you remember your birthday party when I asked your father to tell me the truth about david clarke?
what's your point?
I never got to finish the story.
I already know how it ends.
clarke slept with my mother. Charlotte's his daughter.
that's not the ending of the story, danny. That's just the beginning.
here. See for yourself.
what's this?
why don't we call your fiancee and ask her?
I did, after all, find it underneath her living room floorboards.
she's been playing you, brother. She's playing all of us.
you know, on second thought, allow me to do the honors.
let's take a walk down to the shore. Shall we?
Charlotte. Is everything okay?
couldn't be better.
I've got it.
Hey, didn't mean to leave you stranded.
no problem.
she'll come around. My children always do.
thank you for the tete-a-tete with daniel.
I'm glad it went well.
well, he told me about his secret plan for the two of you.
and seeing as that you're not on a plane to paris,
I can only assume that you talked some sense into the boy.
stay right here, won't you?
and allow me to properly show you my gratitude.
Hey, you really want out of that tux? - Yes.
I just dropped a young lady off on further lane in southampton, and I'm headed back now.
no, no, no, no!
Oh, my god. What did you do?
Jack, I... I can't-i...
I didn't - go.
my truck's up the road. The keys are inside.
you have to go. now.
where are we going?
you ask too many questions.
show me what you got, bad boy.
here. I'll help you. - I got it. I got it.
okay. Ready to go? - Yeah.
come on. Keys.
fire and ice.
when we first sat down to discuss tonight's occasion,
I was immediately taken by the idea of an evening inspired by primal bookends
fire and ice, beginnings and endings, and the love between a man and a woman.
yo, yo, 8 mile, private party here!
that creep better not be taking pictures.
you got a problem?
tonight not only marks the final weekend... Of a truly remarkable summer in the hamptons, it is also the engagement of my son daniel to the lovely and beguiling ms. Emily thorne.
and though we've only known emily for a few short months, she already feels like a piece of the family puzzle we never even knew was missing.
in a word... I approve.
and as anyone can tell you, approval is not something I give away freely.
where the hell is my son?
mom! Mom!
my brother... Somebody come here!
come here!
chaos... By its very definition cannot be controlled.
my, uh, truck broke down.
is there a chance you can give me a ride?
thank you.
it is an honor to be of service.
once introduced, all order and intention is rendered useless.
get away from my son!
Daniel! Daniel, baby, please.
Daniel, w-wake up. Please.
baby, please! Daniel!
it's tyler. Oh, my god.
stand back, please.
mom?
the outcome of chaos can never be predicted.
Oh, my god.
the only certainty it brings...
I... - Don't say a word.
is the devastation it leaves in its wake.
Emily's not your friend, Amanda. You need more proof?
I called your lawyer. I had her send over the divorce papers.
it's time to end this.
your family's been calling non-stop. You gotta face 'em eventually.
take the box. Bury your father's secrets away from here.
come to Paris with me. - I can't.
Hello, Danny.
No! No, no, no! Amanda!
my God. - I-I didn't.
go. My truck's up the road. The keys are inside.
Hey! - Mom!
it's Tyler.
mom?
I... - Don't say a word.
my father's false imprisonment taught me that in a crisis you quickly find out who your real friends are.
tragedy and scandal, it seems, have a unique way of clarifying people's priorities.
we heard a cell phone ring up by the sand dune.
I saw someone in a dark hoodie hiding behind the saw grass.
I don't know. It could've been a hoodie.
it could've been anything, like a guest from the party. It's hard to say.
Tyler wasn't a bad person. He... he was sick.
the guy went all Benihana on my arm and tied me to a chair.
that boy was a menace.
if you people had been doing your jobs, you'd have made sure the little psychopath stayed locked up after holding us all hostage at gunpoint.
when I went home to get Daniel clothes, I saw that my gun was missing.
I'd left a window open. Tyler must have...
broken in and stolen it while we were at the party.
so what were you and Mr. Barrol fighting about?
I don't remember a fight.
you have 15 stitches in your head. How do you explain that?
Tyler had a history of violence, he threatened your whole family at your birthday party.
look, I can understand if you felt like your life was in danger...
you shot him, didn't you?
don't say a word.
I don't remember.
Mr. and Mrs. Grayson, you've had a very busy few months here in the Hamptons.
are you charging him?
not yet, but if you're planning on joining the Labor Day exodus to the city, don't.
well, then we're going to be taking him home.
in case it's lost upon you, he has severe head injury.
he's also covered in blood, presumably the victim's, who was apparently killed by bullets fired from his fiancee's gun.
no, we still have a lot of questions.
Yeah, which won't be answered until his lawyer is present.
or do you want me to call him right now and just let him know that my son's rights are being violated?
come on. Let's go home.
we have a car waiting for you.
I'm gonna go with Emily, but I need to speak to my mother first... Alone.
whatever you need.
smart move, running back to the house to create a cover for how Tyler got your gun.
it might not even matter. Tyler could've told Daniel everything.
Tyler's not exactly a reliable source, and... Daniel loves you.
unless that's changed.
we had an argument at the party.
I'm not sure where we stand.
well, you're standing in a police station, and I would say the more pressing issue is the whereabouts of your father's infinity box.
it's safe and sound.
you ready to go?
Yeah.
are you okay?
what were you talking to your mother about?
we had words at the party. I just... I just wanted to clear the air.
that's good. You're gonna need... as much support as you can get right now.
Daniel, what happened on the beach with you and Tyler?
what's this?
why don't we call your fiancee and ask her?
I did, after all, find it underneath her living room floorboards.
I don't remember.
I had the cook set up some breakfast in case you're hungry.
I've also been tracking the media coverage of Daniel online.
wait a second. Wait. How, uh... Who alerted the media?
well, there's a picture online of Daniel in his bloody tux. Someone from the party must have snapped it.
Oh, well, so much for decorum.
she's right. It's everywhere.
bloody Billionaire Beach Battle"? Do the police really think Daniel killed Tyler?
of course not.
well, Dad took the helicopter into the city.
when it returns, I've made sure the best defense attorney in Manhattan is gonna be on board.
Ashley, could you please get me an aspirin?
of course.
I think her time would be better spent trying to get that photograph taken down.
okay, I'll call Nolan Ross and see if we can have access to his tech team.
and you should get to bed, young lady.
get some rest.
the next few days are gonna be challenging.
I'm only here to pick up clothes. I'm going back to Declan's.
sweetheart, we need you to stay here.
your brother's in real trouble, and we need to stay together as a family.
your mother's right. We need to present a united front.
fine. I'll move back in when you do.
that's what I thought.
you must be exhausted.
Hey, Sammy.
you should take him for a walk.
I will. Just gonna change first.
where you been?
Oh, jeez. Dec. You scared the hell outta me.
what are you doing in here?
I've been wondering what happened to you.
I thought you sailed off to Haiti.
my engine crapped out.
Yeah. I figured that when I saw the "Amanda" in her slip an hour ago.
so where you been all this time?
it's 5: 00 in the morning, man. Why aren't you sleeping?
well, it's been a crazy night.
Tyler was murdered.
me and Charlotte found him.
and Daniel pops up from a dune, covered in blood.
that's... That's insane. Are... Are you okay?
fine. Charlotte's a wreck, though.
she told the cops that she saw some guy in a hoodie on the beach by Tyler's body.
what about you?
I was too far away. I didn't get a good look at his face.
I'm gonna crash.
what are you doing?
looking for answers.
what is this?
I don't know. It must belong to the previous owner.
how did you...
Tyler told me you've been playing me, that you had secrets hidden underneath the floorboards.
Daniel, Tyler was crazy.
he was a liar.
he held us at gunpoint.
you're right. I'm sorry.
no. You don't need to apologize.
you're injured, you're traumatized.
I love you, Daniel.
I'm gonna be by your side no matter what.
come on. You need to get some sleep.
as of now, Daniel hasn't been charged with anything.
all we know is, Tyler Barrol appears to have been shot to death and Daniel was found unconscious at the scene with some blood on him.
everyone's waiting on the coroner's report as well as the results from your fingerprint and gunshot residue test.
until those come back, we won't know what we're up against.
Mr. Brooks, I want to tell you how grateful we are that you've agreed to represent Daniel and that you can count on my husband and I to work as a team.
where is your husband?
Mr. Brooks was kind enough not to question your absence, but I am not feeling so indulgent.
I haven't slept. I'm tired.
and I didn't want our history clouding the room.
246 fatalities in the bombing of Flight 197.
the final death toll will likely surge to include the many unaccounted for...
Conrad, are you all right?
a homegrown group of violent radicals... - What is it?
I've made a terrible, terrible mistake.
you know the plane that went down, Flight 197?
I'm responsible.
what on earth are you talking about?
that group that claimed responsibility for the bombing, I was laundering money for them.
the investigation's gonna tie back to the company.
I'm gonna go to prison for the rest of my life, if I'm lucky.
they're gonna freeze all of our assets, and you're gonna have to raise Daniel alone under a cloud of disgrace.
life as we know it, Victoria, is over.
no matter how much we try to escape our past, we seem destined to repeat it.
like it or not, we are in this together, again.
good to see you, old timer. Good boy.
shouldn't you be on a boat halfway to Haiti right now?
Yeah, well, my engine had other ideas.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. It's Daniel I'm worried about.
the police were questioning him pretty hard.
do they have any other suspects?
I don't know. They're not really keeping us in the loop.
how's Declan? Finding Tyler's body must have been pretty awful.
Yeah, he's, uh, he's playing it cool, but... I'm not buying it.
you haven't heard from Amanda, by any chance, have you?
no. Still no luck getting ahold of her?
no, her phone's disconnected.
anyway, thank you for looking after Sammy.
anytime.
I need to see what happened on Jack's boat. He never left town.
what? He should be down around the outer banks by now.
try my back porch.
no, I swear, he left the harbor.
I saw him or... At least, uh, Shamu did.
see? What did I tell you?
Jack! Jack, wait!
Amanda? What are you doing here?
mea culpa, babe.
Jack said he had engine trouble and the last time he saw Amanda was last week. Why would he lie to me?
probably because he's covering up another one of her messes.
talk to him. See if you can find out why Amanda came back.
and where she's been hiding, right?
especially that.
Hey, Charlotte, what are you doing?
I barely slept last night. My head is pounding.
you have no idea what these past few days have been like for me...
finding out David Clarke is my father, and now Daniel getting wrapped up in Tyler's murder investigation, knowing how close we probably came to getting killed, too...
by that creepy guy in the hoodie.
well, maybe you should call that shrink again.
you said she really helped last time.
talking's overrated. - And taking pills isn't?
were you high last night?
come on, Charlotte. You're supposed to be the smart one here.
and you're supposed to be on my side.
where are you going?
I've had enough interrogation for one weekend.
we should've gone to Paris.
I know. I'm so sorry.
Hamptons Police Department.
just a minute.
they're gonna fry me, aren't they?
no. No. No, I'm not gonna let that happen, okay? - Ms. Thorne, Hamptons Police Department.
okay?
ms. Thorne, we have a warrant for Daniel's arrest. Open the door now.
that's him.
Daniel Grayson, you're under arrest for the murder of Tyler Barrol.
you don't have to... - Stay back.
Daniel. Take your hands off my son!
Daniel's fingerprints were found on Emily's gun.
he handled that gun a dozen times.
his hands were tested positive for gunshot residue.
the blood splatter on his tuxedo was the same type as Tyler's.
in a political climate like this, the D. A. goes first-degree murder.
all right, it's time you told us everything that happened on that beach, son.
it's okay. Do it.
Tyler was talking crazy, waving the gun around.
we had a struggle, and I managed to get ahold of it.
and then he charged at me.
keep going.
so I fired.
three times?
once, then I blacked out. Next thing I remember was my mother calling my name.
Tyler was shot three times.
once in the chest, twice the back.
I didn't shoot Tyler in the back.
how do you know?
I thought you said you blacked out.
when you and Tyler struggled, where did he hit you?
right here, on the side of the head.
there's a hematoma on the back of your head.
that's a hard spot to reach if you're fighting face-to-face.
we can use it to float the theory there was a third person on the beach that knocked you out, set you up.
you're rich. Who hates you?
disgruntled investors, hostile competitors?
great. Where can we find her?
Mrs. Grayson. Mrs. Grayson.
how does it feel to have your son facing life in prison?
Mr. Grayson, what affect will a murder trial - have on Grayson Global stock?
Mrs. Grayson. - The Grayson family have no comment...
do you think your son did it?
except to say that Daniel is innocent of the charges and they're sure that justice will be served.
Victoria. Come on in.
when you and Daniel decided to get married, you probably never would've dreamed that your engagement would have included a...murder investigation.
I don't think anyone could imagine something so horrible.
well, under the circumstances, I would understand if you were reevaluating the future of your relationship.
so... This is my engagement present to the two of you.
you want me to open it now?
no. I want you to hold on to it.
and I need to know that you'll stand by Daniel's side no matter how rough the road gets.
if you abandon him, it'll send a very public message about his innocence.
honestly, that never even crossed my mind.
why did you come back to this house when we were all at the police station?
I knew that they would take Daniel's suit.
I wanted to make sure that he had a change of clothing for when they did.
well, that was quick thinking.
maybe your time in the juvenile detention facility will end up being an asset in Daniel's court case.
I got a problem and I don't know where else to go.
welcome to the cone of silence.
you know what this is?
a... wire receipt for $5 million.
someone sent it from the Southampton Trust to a small bank outside of Montreal.
I called the bank, but I couldn't get 'em to give me any information on who it came from.
was it you?
no.
then it must have been the Graysons.
I think this had something to do with what happened on the beach.
Oh, really,'cause you want to get wrapped up - in a murder investigation?
I already am. The receipt was in Amanda's jacket.
I thought you said she left.
she showed up the other night as I was heading out.
we were all set to go to Haiti, and she took off.
Nolan... Nolan, I followed her to the beach.
I spent hours looking for her.
I-I... driving around. She was gone.
probably straight to Canada to collect the $5 mil.
you asked for my advice so I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
throw away the receipt and let it go.
and while you're at it, why don't you let Amanda go, too?
I can't do that.
this is Emily. Leave a message.
call me A-sap.
you're gonna want to sit down for this one.
do you believe Daniel killed Tyler?
of course not.
the stuff they're saying about him online, it's like they're talking about a completely different person.
they are.
I just wish there was something I could do to help him.
is this what it was like for you when you found out David Clarke did all those hideous things?
do you think about him every time you look at me?
I want to know about him, Mom, what kind of person he was when he was with you.
it feels like you're a million miles away.
if only.
you know, my Aunt Charlotte has a farm in Kansas... 50 acres.
we could pack our bags and leave tonight.
I can't leave Daniel with Conrad.
well, we can pack two bags, bring the kids with us.
besides, when Conrad finds out about us, I'm gonna be finished on Wall Street.
I'm gonna be packing my bags regardless.
well, that's why no one can find out about us, David.
I've lived that life before, and I can't live it again.
well... What about love?
can you live without that?
I promise to tell you everything one day, but today is not the day.
I need you to think hard about that person you saw on the beach.
you might remember things that you don't realize.
do you understand me? Your brother's life may depend on it.
I got your message. What's so important?
Jack found the wire transfer receipt in Amanda's jacket.
did you find out how much Amanda told him?
it doesn't sound like she had a lot of time to chat before she took off.
you ever notice how, whenever you want her to leave, girlfriend keeps popping up like the homicidal stripper version of whac-a-mole, but whenever you need to find her, she vanishes?
and manages to pull Jack even deeper into trouble.
ms. Thorne?
I'll call you back.
Mr. Brooks.
I apologize for the ambush, but I wanted to speak to you alone.
to be perfectly blunt, the more dirt I have on Daniel, the better prepared I'll be when the fur starts flying.
looking for skeletons.
skeletons, addictions, secret relationships, proclivities.
you are blunt.
your fiance's facing a murder charge. This isn't the time for subtlety.
victoria is convinced Amanda Clarke had something to do with what happened on that beach.
have you had any run-ins with her?
I just met her this summer.
she used to live in this house, actually.
she came by once looking for childhood memories.
do you believe she hates the Graysons enough to frame Daniel for murder?
I think you'd have to find her and ask her.
all I know is, she's a very troubled girl.
I already have my investigators on it.
thank you, Ms. Thorne.
Mr. Brooks.
since we're being candid... I think there is something you should know.
about Daniel or Amanda?
about the Graysons.
I understand Daniel got into a few scrapes over the last few years.
like anyone his age, he's had a few youthful indiscretions.
and what role did you and Conrad play in those indiscretions?
I'm not sure I follow you.
did you honestly believe I wouldn't find out you paid off a judge last summer to downgrade Daniel's D. U.I. and reckless endangerment charges?
where on earth did you hear this?
I told him.
I thought you were on Daniel's side. Or was that just a ruse?
as far as I'm concerned, Emily is the only one here who seems to have Daniel's best interests at heart.
no one loves my son more than I do.
what if the prosecution had blindsided me with that mid-trial?
we were very discreet.
that girl was almost killed.
her brother took a 9-iron to Daniel's Aston Martin.
many people know exactly what you did.
everyone's looking for a member of the 1% to smack down, and Daniel is tailor-made to take that fall.
so unless you're ready to level with me,
I might as well be up at Shinnecock Hills practicing my backswing.
of course, Mr. Brooks.
from here on out, you'll have complete and utter candor from both of us.
do you have any leads on Amanda Clarke?
still working on it.
did you know that she dated that young man who runs the Stowaway Tavern in Montauk?
his name is Jack Porter.
I'll pay him a visit.
but my more immediate concern is the security tapes from the party.
what now?
apparently, they were tampered with.
kept on a 3-minute loop for the bulk of the evening.
and how does that impact us?
the prosecution will make it look like Daniel engineered it so no one would see him kill Tyler.
how long have you been working for Takeda?
what are you talking about?
I know you disabled the security cameras at the party.
it's got Takeda's stamp all over it.
do I really need to kick your ass again? How did he recruit you?
okay. He cozied up to me at the investors' shindig earlier this summer.
he wanted me to look out for you.
why didn't you tell me?
because he told me not to, and he can be very convincing.
I'm sorry, Ems.
no, you know what? It's my fault.
I should never have brought you so deep into this.
well, it's a little late to put that genie back in the infinity box.
anyway, we have more pressing problems than your loyalty issues.
the Graysons are on a mission to find Amanda.
until they do, they're gonna be looking for a fall guy closer to home.
ms. Davenport, how are the graysons holding up during this very difficult time?
they're devastated.
Daniel Grayson's arrest is a terrible injustice.
the evidence will show that not only did Daniel not commit the crime, but that there was another person on the beach that night who had both the motive and the means to murder Tyler Barrol and frame Daniel for the crime.
the Grayson family are offering a $100, 000 reward for any information leading to the conviction of the killer.
Charlotte. Is everything okay?
this is the prettiest spot on the beach.
it's so peaceful.
Yeah, I really lucked out.
hard to believe I grew up with a sister right next door and I never had any idea.
do you think she knew the truth this whole summer?
my mother thinks she did.
there's just so much I want to ask her about her life, her father... Our father.
but chances are, that won't happen now.
is that why you've been taking those pills?
you know... Jack and Amanda came over one day and...
they told me that your father built this swing.
he couldn't have been all bad.
Hey, Jack, you got a sec?
Yeah. What's up?
do you remember when I was 9, and me and Jimmy Smithson were playing frisbee in the bar, and I broke Dad's favorite beer sign?
the neon one with the clock?
Yeah, and Dad went ballistic.
you know, I-I'd never seen somebody actually turn purple.
so I ran up to my room, started packing a bag, you know, figuring I was gonna run away.
and you told him you did it, even though he grounded you and wouldn't let you go on that camping trip to the Adirondacks.
no, you are the most stand-up guy I know.
I've seen you take the heat for other people over and over again, but you got a lot more to lose here than a couple of days in the mountains.
and I-I don't care who you're protecting or why.
but as of now, I'm gonna start protecting you.
single malt.
neat. - Coming up.
Where's that pretty girl who tends bar?
Amanda, is it?
our business is seasonal. When the summer ends, people move on to the next gig.
happens every year.
you two were dating, right?
you ask a lot of questions.
benjamin Brooks. I represent Daniel Grayson.
I have another question for you. Where were you Saturday night?
I was starting to sail to Haiti.
I was getting ready to help with the rebuilding there.
aren't you the altruist? What stopped you?
engine trouble.
that's a shame.
pretty soon, fall will be here. It'll be too rough a trip.
should've left when you had the chance.
let me know if you hear from Amanda.
I can have your boat fixed and ready to go by nightfall.
running away is not gonna solve anything.
and I gotta find Amanda before the Graysons do.
and how are you gonna do that?
I don't know yet.
does it matter to you if your clients are guilty?
I never ask.
cynical.
the last thing I need is to have my judgment clouded.
and in 20 years, I haven't lost a case, so if ain't broke...
what's your take on all this?
I think Daniel shot Tyler.
and I think he's gonna get away with it.
and yet you continue to work for the Graysons.
I come from a town called Croydon, just outside of London.
population: No one cares and dropping.
I want more out of life than planning parties and making sure other people's lives run smoothly, but for now... It's my job.
the camera sure loves you.
you play your cards right, you can parlay Daniel's trial into a whole new career.
but then... I think you already know that.
looks like you could use some company.
two months ago, we were being heralded in "The Times" as a golden couple, and now look at us.
one child arrested for murder, and the other can't look at us without contempt, divorced but living under the same roof.
at least it's a 20, 000-square-foot roof. It's not like we'll be tripping over each other.
24000
how the hell did we get here?
I don't know. I believe it's called the domino effect.
you know, one move begets another, and then before you know it...
they all fall down.
I'm worried.
jail is no place for a boy like Daniel.
there is a perception in this part of the world that power and money exert undue influence.
I want it clear: In my courtroom, justice has no price tag.
I have carefully examined the wealth of forensic evidence linking Daniel Grayson to the crime scene and taken into consideration the Grayson family's unlimited resources as well as private planes.
given the serious nature of this crime, I hereby deny bail for Daniel Grayson...
and order him to be remanded to the maximum security correctional facility on Rikers Island - while he awaits trial. - No, that's not right.
bailiff, would you please remove the defendant?
you gotta do something.
do the Graysons see the judge's ruling as a huge defeat?
the Grayson family have the greatest respect for the court's decision regarding Daniel's bail.
but they do view this as a minor setback, and one they're sure the justice system will remedy as quickly as possible.
I'd also like...
you're not going anywhere, are you?
no, Declan needs me.
kudos for the family values.
but you're making a colossal mistake.
does this mean you don't want a drink?
make it a double.
it's gonna be a long fall.
Nolcorp, I.T. Department.
Hey, it's Nolan.
those photos we pulled down for the Graysons,
I need you to find out where they originated.
adversity creates unexpected alliances...
but treaties of this nature seldom form with an equality of power.
well, here she is... The media's new "it" girl.
it's quite an upgrade from the queen's favorite worker bee.
I take it you didn't summon me here for an autograph.
I'm all for a meteoric rise, Ash, but, uh, I followed a hunch, and sourced the scandal pics that are blowing up the Internet.
and guess where the trail ends.
who else knows?
just us. For now.
loyalties forged in apprehension and mistrust are tenuous at best...
easily broken when held up to the unforgiving light of the truth.
but in the darkness of our most desperate hours, it's often these loyalties that lend us the strength to do what we know must be done.
you should have heeded my warning.
what did you do?
what happened on the beach?
the boy was going to expose you.
you won't get away with this, Tyler.
sure I will, but Emily won't.
stay back!
maybe you should call Emily first.
ask her permission to pull the trigger.
she's a wolf in sheep's clothing, you idiot.
and you're just a helpless little lamb headed for the slaughter.
please help me.
No!
but there were others.
the girl you call Amanda.
she has been taken care of.
and then...
the other boy you have feelings for.
you cannot save them both.
a conflicted heart feeds on doubt and confusion.
it will make you question your path...
your tactics...
your motives.
when you stare ahead and darkness is all you see, only reason and determination can you pull you back from the abyss.
I asked for an assault, not a rampage.
the bitch had her own son beat up just to get him back home.
this is your E. H.M. bracelet.
if it stays red longer than thirty seconds, it'll notify us that you violated house arrest.
the Graysons claim to have two eyewitnesses who can place you on the beach after Tyler Barrol was murdered.
I don't care who you're protecting or why, but as of now, I'm gonna start protecting you.
whatever or whomever you're doing, you'd better damn well be discreet.
we found out Amanda's in Montreal. I'm going after her.
Charlotte Grayson was under the influence of prescription pain pills and champagne the night of the murder.
you sold me out.
Declan's recanted his statement about seeing the hooded man on the beach.
Clarence Darrow, one of history's greatest lawyers, once noted...
there is no such thing as justice, in or out of court.
after your examination of the blood splatter on Mr. Grayson's shirt...
the shooter was standing approximately three feet from the victim...
perhaps because justice is a flawed concept that ultimately comes down to the decision of twelve people.
bang.
killing Tyler Barrol in cold blood.
people with their own experiences, prejudices, feelings about what defines right and wrong.
the murder weapon...
fingerprints...
this gun...
which is why, when the system fails us, we must go out and seek our own justice.
the defendant... Daniel Grayson.
how is Daniel holding up?
he's waiting patiently for the defense's turn to present its case.
what about the prosecution's surprise decision to call Charlotte Grayson's boyfriend as their final witness?
ex-boyfriend.
Declan Porter is a highly emotional young man.
are you saying he's an unreliable witness?
I'm saying that he's a teenager nursing his first broken heart.
you can draw your own conclusions.
can you tell us anything more about Daniel's state of mind at the present moment?
I'm sorry, but we have no further comment at this time. Thank you so much.
Ashley, please, just one more...
her name's Amanda Clarke. Clarke with an "e."
according to her credit card statement, she paid for a couple of nights here last week.
here. Ring any bells?
Oh, her. Yeah, I totally partied with her last weekend.
I haven't done shots like that since high school.
any idea where she was headed?
new York, I think. Not City.
it was somewhere upstate, like Buffalo.
Oh, but not Buffalo. It was some other animal name... Deer Brook, you know?
I have a personal acquaintance with Declan, and I know he's had a hard time coping with his father's death since the summer.
and now with his estrangement from Charlotte...
Declan Porter is a highly emotional young man.
Hello, Stowaway.
nolan, hey, it's me.
Jack. How's Omaha? Somewhere in middle America?
that credit card statement you hacked into led me to some crappy motel outside Boston.
for a girl with access to $5 million, it doesn't make sense.
well, when has anything Amanda's ever done made sense?
but... I guess the good news is you're hot on her trail.
speaking of news, the prosecution's planning on putting Declan on the stand?
Yeah. Uh, a guy came by with a, um... subpoena yesterday.
but don't worry. I got Declan's back.
you should've called me.
don't... don't let him talk to anyone till I get home. Got it?
w-w-wait, wait, wait. Y-you're coming home?
what about Amanda?
I got my brother to worry about now.
we already know what Declan Porter's going to say... that there was no one else on the beach that night.
which is a lie.
unfortunately, you were under the influence of prescription pills at the time, which means we can't put you on the stand , to refute his testimony.
however, I do have an expert who will testify that the blood spatter on Daniel's jacket shows no evidence he dragged Tyler's body over thirty yards up the beach.
which means someone else must have.
we just need to get the jury to see it that way.
but before we create reasonable doubt, we have to paint Daniel as sympathetic, which is why I've decided to open my argument by putting Emily on the stand.
are you sure that's a good idea?
Mr. Brooks, this is an enormous responsibility. Emily isn't even family yet.
she's Daniel's fiancee, supporting him by choice, not obligation.
it's your job to appear caring, accessible, to articulate for the jury all the reasons you fell in love with Daniel so they will, too.
well, explaining all the reasons why I love Daniel shouldn't be difficult.
good, because forensic evidence is not on our side.
we're going to have to build an emotional connection between the jury and Daniel.
you're talking as if they've already made up their mind against him.
some of them may have.
juror number three, Ann Woodbury, for instance.
in voir dire, she presented as open, impartial, but based on her physical reactions to the prosecution's evidence, it's likely she'll vote to convict.
if I can't at least plant reasonable doubt in her mind, we might as well have taken the murder two deal.
well... Perhaps we should reconsider the D. A.'s offer.
unfortunately, it's no longer on the table.
the case they laid out is a home run, and they know it.
the decision is in the hands of the jury.
a tragic twist in the David Clarke trial today.
the wife of juror number seven was the victim of a deadly carjacking in Queens last night.
evening, Countess.
judge Barnes immediately excused the juror, who will be replaced with an alternate.
the remaining members of the jury continue to be sequestered in an undisclosed location with minimal outside contact.
sorry to interrupt your regularly scheduled plotting.
Jack's en route to Montauk as we speak.
I guess we couldn't expect him to stay away forever.
at least we managed to keep him out of the Graysons' reach for as long as possible.
what now?
Jack shows his face, the Graysons are gonna try and pin the murder on him.
no, that's not gonna happen.
I got your money. What are the details?
the jury's sequestered at the Seacliff Inn in Northampton.
you bugged the queen's castle?
you'll have to pose as a hotel employee to get to her.
the one you want is juror number three, Ann Woodbury.
are we clear on what you need to do?
crystal. And as far as how?
ms. Woodbury is the single mother of a young son herself.
if she felt her child were in mortal danger, hanging a jury would be a small price to pay to ensure his safety.
got it.
who is she talking to?
mini Frank. The muscle who flattened Jack.
Yeah, he also set up Daniel's beating at Rikers, and whatever Victoria has planned for juror number three.
his name's Lee Moran. He's been acting as Victoria's pawn for months.
he's about to become mine.
did you bring the whale cam?
you do realize that if you expose the Graysons for jury tampering, you risk your fiance spending the rest of his life in prison?
I came here for one reason.
nothing's gonna get in my way.
I'm not used to seeing you in that uniform.
I'm not used to seeing you.
I'm sorry. I know I was gone longer than I planned.
Nolan filled in.
upside is, he knows more about Pre-Calculus than you do.
the, uh, the downside is, is he's Nolan.
well, I'm glad you're back.
is that your hoodie?
you said you were gonna get rid of that, Jack.
I might still need it.
look, if the defense decides to go after Amanda,
I'm gonna need to prove that I was there so they believe me when I say she didn't do it.
how do you know she didn't? What if they think you did it?
I had no reason to. No motive. No weapon.
you know, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna tell the jury the same thing I've been saying all along...
I didn't see you or anybody else on that beach.
I'm not gonna let you lie in court.
all the hard work you've been putting into Collins Prep won't mean a thing with a perjury conviction following you around.
you're gonna lecture me about right and wrong?
if you had just handed that hoodie over and told the cops the truth in the first place, - we wouldn't be having this conversation. - You know I can't do that.
cause you're protecting Amanda... Someone you knew when you were twelve.
what about looking out for your family?
that's what I'm trying to do right now.
your timing's way off.
did you hear from any of the galleries?
as a matter of fact, yeah.
Yeah, all the dealers I spoke to, even some I didn't, have said they'll be stopping by for the preview on the weekend.
Ah, well, then the word's officially out.
you're ready to step out of the shadows.
Yeah. The question is... Are you?
well, what do you think?
it's stunning.
three months ago, you were unable to finish a painting, and here you are now with an entire collection of your best work.
Yeah. All inspired by you.
again.
I thought I'd save yours till last.
I got the distinct impression you rather like being left undone.
I do.
there's hope in it...
and her path is still unchosen.
maybe it's time to choose it.
maybe it's time for you to step out of the shadows.
do things differently, yeah?
Yes. When Daniel's acquitted.
but the shadows around me are darker than you know.
how do you mean?
long ago when I told you that I couldn't love anybody, I lied.
I was protecting myself. - From what?
from loss and hurt.
and then I met you... And I was drawn to your volatility and your fire.
then I had to leave because I felt that if you burned me, I would turn to ash.
so I entered a marriage of convenience.
but I always felt the lack of you.
and I walked around in emptiness until I met him.
who?
sorry to just show up out of the blue.
no, um... Get inside before you turn blue. It's freezing out here.
so what happened? I thought you were on the road.
I went up and down the entire Eastern seaboard looking for Amanda.
but I was always just a day behind.
you haven't heard from her, have you?
not a word.
does that worry you?
the whole thing does.
every clue I've uncovered about her just leads to more questions.
I don't know if she's screwing with me or if she's in serious trouble.
well, if your gut's telling you that she's in trouble, maybe you should listen to it.
only I can't help her if I can't find her.
it sounds like you should keep looking.
I'm sorry.
here you are, your fiance in the middle of a murder trial, my brother about to testify against him, and I'm unloading all my problems on you.
how are you holding up?
I'm... managing.
come here.
what are you doing out there?
you're going to catch your death.
that seems inevitable.
Oh, Daniel. Don't be morbid.
how about realistic?
no jury in their right mind is gonna be sympathetic to me.
you don't know that yet. - Look at my track record.
last summer, I got wasted, crashed my car, and nearly paralyzed my girlfriend.
this summer, I shot my best friend.
in self-defense. - In cold blood.
I would've fired all three bullets if I had the chance.
that's a thought the jury is never going to hear.
I hate to admit it, but I think that Brooks has made the smart move by putting Emily on the stand first.
Really? You don't know that yet.
Jack Porter's back.
Yeah. He's in her house right now, making a fire and God knows what else.
Brooks here. - This is Victoria Grayson.
Hello, Victoria.
I think we have the break we need for Daniel's defense.
Jack Porter is back in town.
and if handled properly, he'll lead us directly to Amanda Clarke.
I suggest that you subpoena him as a hostile witness before he disappears again.
I'll get right on it.
Thanks.
what?
I know tomorrow's going to be a struggle for you, hearing that boy tell his side of the story without you being able to tell yours.
it wouldn't matter if Brooks would just let me testify.
well, Brooks is being cautious.
he doesn't want your drug use to hurt Daniel's case more than it already has.
Thanks, Mom.
if you really want to find a way to help, get Declan to corroborate your story.
Yeah, and how am I supposed to do that?
you're a resourceful girl. You'll find a way.
room service.
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong room.
I've already eaten dinner.
well, are you Ann Woodbury?
Yes. - Then I have the right room.
get out of my room. I'm calling security.
you might want to wait on that.
recognize this kid?
it's... my son... Matthew.
he's a sweet boy. Trusting.
walked with me after school all the way to your house.
please. What do you want?
hung jury or an acquittal.
otherwise, Matthew doesn't make it past the first grade.
do you get what I'm telling you?
good. Mention anything to anyone about our conversation, and my face is the last one your kid will ever see.
Oh, poor little Matthew. You don't think he'll hurt him?
he's not gonna have any reason to.
victoria played this perfectly.
if there's anything we've learned, it's how far a mother's willing to go to protect her son.
wait, wait. What now?
we turn the tape over to the police and the Graysons get their very own cell block?
that would be too merciful.
I'm gonna take care of this.
for now, you just make sure that Declan sticks to his story on the stand tomorrow.
if he doesn't, Brooks will have no choice but to go after Jack.
so that's what this is all about... Protecting Jack?
he might be willing to sacrifice himself for Amanda, but... I'm not willing to let him.
it's been a while. - Yeah, 58 days.
unless you count that time you told me to get lost in the cafeteria, then it's been 31.
Declan, listen, I know what's going on.
my mom's convinced that guy on the beach is your brother.
and you're protecting him like I'm protecting my brother.
no one's saying Jack did anything.
but Daniel could go to prison for life, and it'll be my fault.
and if you lie, it'll be your fault, too.
this is your chance to fix everything, including you and me.
don't you want that? I do.
more than anything.
we can be together again. All you have to do is tell the truth.
knock, knock, kids.
what do you want, Nolan?
I'm just checking up on you.
I see I'm not the only one.
mind if I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, I was just leaving. Think about what I said.
you know where to reach me.
so I'm guessing she's not here to help you on your midterms.
no. No, she wants me to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow, same as Jack.
what's stopping you?
if I come clean and I tell them that...
that I saw Jack standing over Tyler's body, man, I don't know where that's gonna lead.
what if Amanda did shoot Tyler?
what if they go after Jack as an accomplice?
I've lost my mom and my dad.
I cannot lose my brother, too.
but if I lie... Charlotte might lose hers.
And...Maybe Daniel's guilty.
Yeah. And either way, I might never get Charlotte back.
the Graysons are ruthless.
they would not hesitate to have Jack take the fall for all of this.
so my advice... Don't make it any easier for them.
the People vs. - Daniel Grayson.
sources inside the courtroom tell us that the prosecution is just moments away from calling their final witness.
as the defense stated in their opening argument, they're going to try to refute the overwhelming physical evidence that we've presented by claiming that Daniel Grayson was framed, that Charlotte Grayson, the defendant's sister, saw a third person on the beach.
objection. Counsel is testifying.
objection sustained.
thank you.
Mr. Porter, will you recount for us what happened that night on the beach?
Yeah, um... We were gonna go swimming, and, uh, it was cold, so I went to go get us clothes, and that's when I saw that body behind the saw grass... Uh, Tyler.
and where was Daniel this whole time?
I don't know.
he, uh... I didn't see him until everybody ran over.
before that moment, did you see anyone else anywhere on the beach?
because in an initial statement Charlotte made to the police, she said there was someone else.
I know what she said.
why don't you tell us what you saw?
was there someone else on that beach that night?
no.
why should the jury believe your account over Miss Grayson's?
because Charlotte was drunk and high on oxycodone that night.
and what about you?
I've never taken drugs in my life.
no further questions.
wait a minute. Charlotte's a good person. All right?
she's just lookin' out for her brother.
the prosecution rests, Your Honor.
I don't know why you're so upset. We knew what he was gonna say.
I was hoping that Declan would think twice before perjuring himself.
obviously, he wasn't given convincing incentive.
I've never trusted either one of those Porter boys.
Oh, you don't trust anyone.
that's not true.
I simply don't give away my trust as freely as you do.
need I remind you who your fiancee was sitting next to in court?
how you holding up?
what was that about today?
what, you mean Declan's testimony? It's a setback.
I'm not talking about that.
look, I want to have this conversation face-to-face.
and I obviously can't come to you, so...
look, Daniel, I... I'm sure you're going stir crazy.
I can only imagine, but Brooks gave me seventeen pages of notes for my testimony tomorrow.
I'm first up. I need to be prepared.
and how do you plan to convince twelve strangers you're in love with me when I'm not even sure myself?
wait. Daniel, what are you talking about?
nothing. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
it's Declan. Leave a message.
Declan's still not picking up. He just took off after court.
I have no idea where he went.
maybe he needs some space.
no, what he needs is a good lawyer.
the defense subpoenaed me.
so now if I tell the truth, I implicate Declan, but if I don't...
okay, okay, I-I'll find you some good legal advice.
Thanks.
but before you do, I have some evidence that places me on the beach that night...
a sweatshirt I was wearing, and Tyler's blood, it's all over it.
you can't be serious.
once I hire a lawyer, I'm gonna do exactly what Declan said to do from the start.
I'm gonna hand it over and say what I really saw.
do you have a death wish?
these are the Graysons we're dealing with.
I can't expect Declan to do the right thing when I haven't.
you gonna help me or not?
Yeah. I'll make some calls.
hello. - We're at Defcon 1, Ems.
Jack's been sitting... not literally... on a hoodie that directly links him to the murder.
what? Where are you, The Stowaway?
that would be an affirmative.
and I'm supposed to be finding Jack a good lawyer.
no, don't bother. He won't need one.
just try to get him out of there for a couple of hours, okay?
okay.
any luck?
yes and... No.
you know what? I am worried about Declan.
let's go for a drive. Let's see if we can find him.
Yeah.
come in.
miss Charlotte, you have a visitor.
just like old times.
only now I don't have to climb up a drain pipe.
a lot's changed if your mom's letting guys in the bedroom now.
she's not.
if my parents find out about this, I'll tell my dad you're the one who drank his 85-year-old scotch.
that was hot.
shut the door.
so did you bring 'em?
you're all business now, aren't you?
I like it.
nice. How'd you get so many?
I stole one of my dad's scrip pads.
just so you know... This is gonna cost you a little extra.
money's not a problem.
it's not money I'm after.
the little rat from Montauk's been out of the picture long enough.
what's stopping me and you?
absolutely nothing.
well, if it isn't the infamous Dominik Wright.
expecting someone else, I bet.
as a matter of fact, yeah, I've got a showing. So if you don't mind...
Oh, yes, I had my people contact the few galleries who were expressing interest, and we just let them know that your current collection's already spoken for.
you really have been carrying on with my wife.
your ex-wife.
well, uh, it hasn't been finalized yet.
so what, you, um, you been having her followed?
well, it behooves a person in my position to cover his bases.
and I've also had you investigated.
it seems that you have been nurturing quite a shady existence.
I mean, dealing in black market auctions, allegations of forgeries.
well, allegations are just that, aren't they?
allegations. I mean, you of all people should know that.
innocent till proven guilty.
Oh, yeah, but I have proof in the form of my very first De Kooning that I purchased, brokered by a fetching young Vicky Harper years ago.
you see, I had that painting appraised when I found out that she'd sunk back in with you, and it turns out that that De Kooning is worth less than the frame it's in.
so what do you want?
you want your money back, hmm?
or do you want to just excise me like you did to the last man she loved?
Oh, yeah, she told me what you did to David Clarke.
she told you what I did?
what you both did.
Yeah, well, eventually, you would've learned that Victoria's word is about as authentic as the paintings you forged.
but to answer your question, no, I'm not here to excise you.
I know I'm not the only wealthy collector you and Victoria worked your con on all those years ago.
so if you really want to finalize Victoria's shame,
I could have her arrested for knowingly brokering forged classics.
or... You could do the noble thing.
you could take your current spate of masterpieces and you could clear out of this joint and leave nothing behind but my wife.
you know, you might wanna leave before I break every one of the fourteen bones in your face.
Daniel, what are you doing?
I could ask you the same thing.
you can't be here. Your ankle monitor...
I'm not leaving until you tell me what the hell you're really up to.
maybe my mom was right about you.
maybe Tyler was, too.
how much have you had to drink?
don't change the subject.
I saw you yesterday with Jack.
is that where you went to see him?
Daniel, stop... - You think I'm an idiot?
all the mysterious phone calls, all the times you disappeared...
have you been sneaking around with him the whole time?
that's ridiculous... - Don't lie to me!
I'm sorry...
Freeze! Right there.
Freeze! Hands where I can see 'em.
hands up. Don't move. Hands up. Get down.
let's go. Facedown. Down.
Daniel Grayson, you're in direct violation of your house arrest.
how long before Daniel's released back to us, Mr. Brooks?
I'm heading to Rikers now to get Daniel's side of the story.
once I have the facts, I'll set a meeting with the judge.
all right. Well, I'll be there first thing in the morning.
I really have no idea why he'd violate house arrest.
I do.
let me call you back.
Daniel thought that I was having an affair with Jack.
I assured him that that wasn't true, that... I'm not that kind of person.
but the truth is, I have been getting closer to Jack... to get information on Amanda.
Jack claims he doesn't know where she is.
and you don't believe him?
I went to The Stowaway to search his apartment.
what did you find?
nothing.
as far as I can tell, Jack's telling the truth.
if the jury convicts Daniel for this, I'll never forgive myself.
well, that makes two of us.
but fortunately, there are other factors that might help shape the jury's opinion.
for example?
your testimony, of course.
so go home, Emily, and tomorrow deliver the performance of your life.
what the hell?
Yeah, we got robbed,'cause that's what this day needed.
suffolk County Police. What town? - Montauk.
please hold. - Yeah, I'll hold.
Hey, I'm on with the police.
hang on.
computer... TV... Nothing's missing.
Oh, God.
what? What?
what are you doing?
hang up the phone. - What?
hang up the phone!
the hoodie... It's gone.
hands over your head. - What's the problem?
is this your vehicle? - What of it?
an AMBER Alert was issued. Put your hands behind your back.
what the hell? I didn't kidnap anybody.
relax. Matches your plates.
Oh, come on.
what's that?
on your sweatshirt, is that blood?
that's not mine. That's not mine.
lee Moran, you're under arrest.
Oh, come on. That's not my sweatshirt. I'm being set up.
man, Ems, when you said you were gonna use Lee as your pawn, you weren't kidding.
checkmate.
what happens if they find Jack's D. N.A. on the hoodie?
they'll link it to the night that Lee beat up Jack, reinforcing his status as the Grayson family goon.
so in one fell swoop, you managed to protect Jack, exonerate Daniel, and force Lee into selling out the Graysons to save himself.
haven't you tied everything up in one neat little bow?
almost.
are you at The Stowaway?
standing right outside.
good. There's one loose end I'm leaving to you.
so you think the Graysons had the guy who beat me up break in here a second time and steal my hoodie?
the Graysons did what?
it's just a hypothesis, but it makes sense, doesn't it?
so then I'm screwed. - Au contraire.
because according to the police scanner, they found the bloody hoodie when they picked the dirtbag up.
the Graysons can't exactly admit their association to the guy, so their lawyer's gonna have to make it look like he's the killer.
you really think they're capable of that?
they hired the guy to beat you half to death, didn't they?
the Graysons are capable of anything when it comes to protecting their family.
how did they even know I had it?
you guys were the only two people I told.
well, who knows?
maybe the guy really did murder Tyler.
maybe he even saw you on the beach that night.
at this point, I'd advise against digging any deeper.
take the win, Jack.
this call will be recorded. You have a collect call from your worst nightmare. - At Rikers Correctional Facility.
to connect, press 5 now.
we have a problem.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
they found a bloody sweatshirt in my car.
they're saying it matches the blood of the kid your son shot.
what? - Did you set me up?
because there's no way I'm taking the fall for something I didn't do.
stop harassing me.
you won't get a penny from us.
get me outta this or get ready, lady.
because if I'm going down, I'm taking you down with me, straight to hell where you belong.
you threaten me and my children again, and I will go straight to the police.
what was that about?
we need to call Brooks.
no, you need to speak to me first.
who was that?
what on God's earth have you done, Victoria?
so let me get this straight.
you paid a thug to have our son beaten up in prison, and then what, strong-arm a juror, when this guy could've been the very reason Daniel's even on trial in the first place?
lee didn't kill Tyler.
it doesn't make any sense. He was set up.
by whom, for instance?
Jack Porter. He knew what Lee looked like.
he could've orchestrated the whole thing to protect the real killer.
let me guess. Amanda Clarke.
you have really lost it, you know that?
did it even occur to you how much you've risked both our lives and Daniel's with this?
I will categorically deny anything Lee has to say.
he was blackmailing us.
well, that's not gonna be enough.
once that punk starts talking to save his skin, it's gonna lead investigators all the way down the rabbit hole to us.
leave me alone. I need to think.
this will be second mess of yours I've had to clean up in one day.
what is that supposed to mean?
I don't know. Why don't you go and ask your artist friend?
not that I expect you'll find him.
I mean, once a fraud, always a fraud. Isn't that right, Victoria?
you stay away from him!
no problem there. He's long gone by now.
Oh, you bastard.
the last time I wrote you from this place, I told you I was innocent.
that's not really the case.
I may not have fired the shot that killed Tyler, but I did shoot him...
because he made me doubt you...
because he said you'd betray me.
but I'm the one who betrayed you. And now I'm getting what I deserve.
which is why I'm gonna do us both a favor and end this now.
open 2-7-7!
holy hell.
the coroner's been notified. C.S. I. on the way.
Mr. Brooks, thanks for coming down.
what's happening out there? They're saying someone hanged himself.
and confessed to killing Tyler in a suicide note.
what? - Still want to change your plea?
I didn't think so.
I'll get started getting your charges dropped.
justice, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
federal authorities have confirmed the death of terrorist David Clarke, who was stabbed yesterday when a fight broke out...
some see an innocent victim.
others see evil incarnate getting exactly what's deserved.
I got your message.
what's wrong? What happened?
I was wasting my time...
gathering evidence on jury tampering when... The Graysons have so much more to pay for.
sorry to have put us in this position again, especially after all these years.
we have another David Clarke-style situation.
that's very troubling news.
the name's Moran. - Wait. Is that Conrad?
lee Moran. He's in a holding cell at Rikers.
if he starts talking, I don't see how we'll keep a lid on our association.
all of the research that I did...
everybody that I talked to, they said that...
it was just a prison fight...
that my dad was knifed to death by an inmate.
how did I not know this?
the Graysons murdered my father.
was there someone else on that beach?
no.
Jack's been sitting on a hoodie that directly links him to the murder.
just try to get him out of there for a couple of hours.
what's that? On your sweatshirt, is that blood?
when you said you were gonna use lee as your pawn, you weren't kidding.
checkmate.
if I'm going down, i'm taking you down with me.
Daniel, your ankle monitor
police! Hands up. Don't move.
they're saying someone hanged himself.
and confessed to killing tyler.
we have another david clarke-style situation.
is that conrad?
the graysons murdered my father.
absolution is the most powerful form of forgiveness...
a full pardon from suspicion and accountability.
it's the liberation of a stolen future.
a future my father never lived to see.
absolution... Is a mercy the people who killed him will never know.
the timing of the confession and jailhouse suicide of drifter lee moran,
judge elizabeth hawthorne spent all morning in chambers with the prosecution and defense teams.
and now billionaire daniel grayson's fate hangs in the balance.
and still, grayson's innocence remains very much in question in the court of public opinion.
Yeah, I'll say.
you know, if the graysons are behind all this, you're gonna have to steer clear of charlotte.
like you did with amanda clarke?
come on. Charlotte's headed down a really bad path, and I'm partly to blame.
well, exactly. Now that the graysons know that you lied on the stand, there's no telling what they might do to you.
let me guess. You're working on your wedding invite list.
well, assuming your ploy to spring your fiance actually works, but why wouldn't it?
you're you.
these are the names of the prisoners from my father's cell block.
I've identified everyone who was involved in the riots the day that my father was murdered.
now what?
cross-reference it with the grayson christmas card list?
nolan, you know the man that stabbed my father was never identified.
Conrad could have made payments to their families.
he could have arranged for early pardon for good behavior.
another cover-up?
Conrad said on the phone,"i'm sorry to put us in this position again.
if they killed lee to silence him, it's a very strong possibility that they did the same to my father.
where are you off to now?
I'm going to check on charlotte. I'm worried about her.
well, it's not exactly dominik's best work.
looks a little half-assed if you ask me.
it's unfinished.
you know, if I'd known you were such a masochist, i'd have volunteered to rub this salt in your wounds myself.
Oh, come on. Where's the witty repartee?
if you're expecting me to reveal so much as a wince of pain at the hands of your emotional torture, you can forget it.
well... Color me disappointed.
don't be, conrad.
when I choose to react, you'll know it.
and I guarantee that you'll not just regret each and every one of your petty little torments, but that the suffering you so glibly spread around will come back at you tenfold.
Charlotte, it's emily.
has something happened with daniel?
no. We're still waiting.
how are you?
I'm all right.
come in.
what's all this?
my version of... Father-daughter time.
my mom won't tell me anything about him, so this is everything I could find on public record and some that isn't.
I found this hidden in the lining of my mother's jewelry box.
look at the date.
april 22, 2002. The day he died.
I wonder where she got this.
he doesn't look like a monster, does he?
no. He looks scared.
that's what I think, too.
I have to get to school.
there's a journal missing from the infinity box.
how do you know?
because he's holding one in a picture taken the day he died.
what picture?
the photograph isn't the point, nolan.
it's the journal and the fact that my father trusted you with the box first.
Ems... I gave you everything that your father asked me to give you.
I mean... Why would I hold something like that back from you?
I don't know. You tell me.
I'll call you right back.
I was only honoring your father's wishes.
do you know how sick I am of hearing you say that?
it's the truth. I swear.
in the last few months of his life, your father was paranoid and terrified and
and what?
and he wouldn't have wanted you to remember him like that.
I promised that I would protect your father's legacy, and that's exactly what I've done.
from now on, you stay the hell out of this nolan, or I swear to god, I will make sure that you do.
from the moment of my arrest,"i sat stupid and trusting,"believing in a system rigged against me
by the people that I knew as friends in a life that I can no longer remember.
the closer I get to the truth,"the louder the whispered voices around me, "plotting my execution,"choosing the time.
I now know that I'm trapped in a race between fate and freedom.
whichever wins out, I won't go quietly,"not again.
C. M.Will come tomorrow with proof.
Jack, don't worry. Declan is barely a blip on the graysons' radar at this point.
what about emily?
does she have any idea what she's about to marry into?
well, emily's not exactly in the mood to absorb any more negative grayson press right now...
especially from me.
but maybe she would listen to you.
do you have a to-go cup, by the way?
Why? Where have you gotta be?
well, contrary to popular belief, I do have a multinational company to run.
I'm gonna be gone on business for a few days.
all right. Bye, jack. Call me.
missed a pop quiz in econ.
laws of supply and demand.
I think I understand the concept.
make this one last, char.
my dad's gonna start missing his scrip pad.
you're not the only guy in school with connections, adam.
but I better be the only one you're giving it up to.
sorry. Bad day.
you gotta stop blowing off class. People are starting to talk.
let them.
I'll pull it together when this nightmare with my brother is over. Until then...
what are you staring at, wharf rat?
nothing.
can we talk?
no. Let's get outta here, adam.
new mercy hospital, archives.
hi there. I'm just wondering, uh, what are your hours?
7: 00 to 4: 00, monday through friday.
if you'd like to request a medical record, I can mail you a legal form.
no, that's all right. I'll come in and get one later.
Jack. Come on in.
how are you?
actually, that was gonna be my question to you.
can I get you something to drink?
no, I'm fine. Thank you.
it can't be easy, waiting to hear about daniel's fate.
no. No, none of it's easy.
you'd think that a written confession by someone would be enough for the judge to drop the charges, but...
not to mention the bloody hoodie they found in his possession.
it's kind of amazing... The way it all worked out, don't you think?
how do you mean?
just... The graysons are very powerful people.
maybe the protesters aren't as far off as you might think.
Jack, daniel didn't kill tyler.
I'm not saying that he did.
then what are you saying?
that there are some things you might want to think about before marrying into that family.
Emily, there's something I need to tell you.
Oh, excuse me.
hello.
they dropped all charges.
Oh, thank god.
okay, I'll be right there.
Jack, I'm...
sounds like good news. You should go get him.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to - No, no, I'm sorry. I practically ambushed you.
we can talk later.
you've had my business card for over six months.
timing is everything, go.
and now that you've cashed out your shares of grayson global, is it safe to assume that the stars are properly aligned for you?
I can't guarantee anything till I know what we're talking about.
if you can't offer me protection, i'm more than happy to go to your superiors at the s. e.c. or to the director of the fbi, the cia, or any other agency who would like to lay claim to the conviction of a domestic terrorist.
a terrorist?
I thought you had information about your husband's corporate malfeasance.
in this case, Mr. Mcgowen, they're one and the same.
now do we have a deal or not?
let me make a phone call.
murderer! Murderer! Murderer!
you sure you're all right?
you've barely said two words.
sorry about your car.
this will eventually die down. It's gonna be okay.
congratulations, son. Welcome home.
welcome home, daniel.
thank god it's finally over.
no, this is a long way from over.
Daniel's a little shaken.
somebody spray painted "murderer" on my car outside of the prison.
that's horrible.
Yeah, the press were practically handing out pitchforks at the gate.
he's not far off. "the times" are questioning the veracity of the confession, "page six" is running a full-page chronicle of daniel's past party-boy ways, and treadwell's anti-grayson blog is being rerun in every major newspaper.
this story isn't dying down any time soon.
well, then we'll starve the beast.
Daniel has nothing to hide.
I think the best thing for him to do would be to get in front of the cameras, tell his story.
she's right. The best way to hit this is head-on.
well, all the majors are practically banging down the door
nightline," "good morning america."We can have our pick.
listen, I haven't slept in over 48 hours. I - I can't make that decision right now.
I'm gonna crash for a while, okay?
Yeah, of course. You need some rest.
someone tell charlotte i'll give her a big hug when I wake up.
sweet dreams, darling. You deserve them.
Victoria, could I talk with you for a moment?
of course.
I guess i'll see you all tomorrow. - yes.
what is it, ashley?
now that daniel's been officially released, i'd like to formally give my notice.
of course. I had no delusions that you would return to party planning after you so aptly showcased your other talents.
unfortunately, I won't have time to find you a suitable replacement.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
the hamptons are filthy with ambitious young girls like yourself.
may I ask where you've landed?
Mr. Brooks has offered me a media relations position at his law firm.
Ah, well... As Mr. Brooks is still on retainer to us, I would like to ask you a favor.
if daniel does indeed grant this ill-advised interview,
I would like you to remain as our media liaison until it's over.
that's the least I can do for daniel after all he's done for me.
doctor, uh, this is eve tucker at new mercy hospital. We're updating our system, and I needed to cross-check our records before confirming cause of death of a patient we shared.
her name is carole miller.
I'm afraid I don't recognize the name.
perhaps it's because it's been a long time.
she died here in 2002, but it has you listed as her primary care physician in lancaster.
5'5," born in 1950, type 2 diabetic.
I have a carole thomas matching that description, but she's alive and well.
that must have been a clerical error.
Yes, it must have been. Thank you.
can I help you?
you have the wrong house.
I don't think so, ms. Miller.
Alison rodner from the department of homeland security.
I need to talk to you about conrad grayson.
you worked for grayson global as conrad grayson's personal secretary for 18 years, is that right?
well, you obviously know the answer to that or you wouldn't be here.
all right then. What was the nature of your relationship with david clarke?
there was no relationship.
he worked for Mr. Grayson, not me.
were you surprised to hear that he was convicted for the downing of flight 197?
no one saw that coming.
but you did, didn't you?
do you take sugar with your tea?
no.
now... Let me see that i. d. Of yours again, and let's verify that you are who you say you are.
no, no, no, no. Aunt carole, just... Put down the gun.
aunt carole? What the hell is going on?
aunt carole, meet, uh... Amanda clarke, david clarke's daughter.
look, after I dropped out of m. i.t.
and my old man kicked me to the curb, aunt carole took me in.
she was the one that introduced me to your dad.
and then you betrayed him.
no, she didn't. She was always on his side.
Nolan came to me and told me he had formed a bond with david while he was in prison and that he believed that your father had been set up.
so I started investigating grayson global from the inside out, and that led me to a man named roger halsted.
Grayson's senior accountant.
Yes, he's the one that discovered the discrepancies in the books that connected conrad to the terrorists.
Yeah, I know who he is.
he thought he had enough evidence to hang conrad and exonerate your father.
then why didn't you?
we never got the chance.
when I went to the prison to tell your dad what carole had learned, they were already in lockdown.
david had just been killed.
carole, it's me. I need you to do exactly as I say.
get up and walk away from your desk. Do not take your purse.
just act like you're walking down the hall. Do it now!
you're scaring me.
good. Get in a cab and take it straight to that place we went that one summer, with the horses.
do not stop off at your apartment.
I'll be waiting when you get there.
so... He saved my life.
by faking your death.
tell her about the white-haired man.
there was a man who visited grayson a handful of times.
now these meetings were always off the books.
the first time I saw him was a year to the day before that plane went down.
the last time was the morning your father died.
do you remember his name?
he never gave it. But I will never forget his face.
he had a full head of white hair and ice-blue eyes, and there was something so terrifying about him.
and I know he frightened conrad even in the bright of day.
Ems... I'm sorry.
but I could not give you that last journal.
this is bigger to me than your revenge against the graysons.
this is my - Family.
I know.
I would've done anything to protect mine, too.
what the hell are you doing here?
I wanted to give you this.
my phone? How did you get this?
I took it out of tyler's jacket the night he was murdered.
what?
I'm the one who dragged his body up the beach.
are you also the one who hit me?
no. And I didn't see what happened.
I heard gunshots and I went to the water, and tyler was lying there.
I thought it was you, and then I heard charlotte and declan, and I... I panicked.
well, so much for your stand-up image.
you were just gonna let 'em fry me?
I told you, I don't know who killed tyler.
but I do know one thing for certain
the bloody hoodie they found in lee moran's car didn't belong to lee moran.
it belonged to me.
I think your parents hired him to break in and steal it from me.
and then what, convinced him to confess to the crime and hang himself?
why are you telling me this?
cause emily trusts you.
and if she's gonna spend her life with you, you owe it to her not to ignore this.
what are you doing? You have no right.
you might want to dial back on that indignation.
you just violated the honor code not to mention state law.
you set me up.
Charlotte, you need help.
you're pathetic!
if I'm getting kicked out of this school, so are you.
I'm telling my dad to pull your tuition next semester. You're done here.
that's enough. Come on.
don't touch me!
Mr. Brooks, I thought your work here was finished.
nearly.
I hope you're not upset that I agreed to stay and work with the graysons through daniel's television interview.
I should be able to start full-time the day after tomorrow.
I'm afraid that offer is no longer on the table, ashley.
Why?
victoria warned me you were a little tricky, so I did some digging, and I know you leaked those photos of daniel to the press.
I did what anyone would do.
you can't get beyond working for someone like victoria grayson without breakingew a f rules.
I'm sorry. I waste enough time sifting through my clients' lies.
I have no interest in doing the same with my employees.
the feds are here, Mr. Grayson.
the feds? What do they want?
they came with a warrant to seize everything.
what do you mean, everything? By whose authority?
by the authority of the people of the united states.
this is agent mcgowen of the s. e.c.Mr. Grayson.
I suggest you set aside tomorrow morning to come down to the federal building and answer some questions.
you're gonna want to bring your lawyer.
Daniel. I thought you'd still be home sleeping.
I think I've been asleep long enough.
come here.
you're still wearing it.
of course I am.
why, are you having second thoughts?
I thought you might be.
so much has changed.
not to me.
what if those protesters were right?
what if I didn't deserve that reprieve?
what are you talking about?
what if lee moran had nothing to do with tyler's death?
I don't understand.
why would a career criminal who's bold enough to extort my parents and set me up for murder suddenly have a crisis of conscience?
I don't know. Maybe he finally realized he was in over his head.
maybe.
I decided to do that interview tomorrow.
you did?
I'm so proud of you.
my parents raised me to be a grayson, to put my name before everything, including the truth.
you don't need to be that guy, daniel.
maybe this interview's an opportunity for you to be honest, separate yourself from your name.
and if it creates a bit of healthy distance from your parents, then all the better.
I'll go grab my stuff.
you're still up?
I thought you'd gone to emily's.
I came back to pick up my things, saw your light was on.
you all right?
uh, no. I am most definitely not all right.
it's nice to have you back, but our family is on the verge of absolute catastrophe, daniel.
and I'd bet the house, if my name were still on it, that your mother has everything to do with that.
that's enough, dad. I'm sick and tired of the two of you playing me against the other.
that's undstandae.
you've been a pawn in our decrepit marriage for far too long.
I - I owe you an apology.
no, what you owe me is the truth.
the truth.
do you know why the judge so kindly granted you house arrest instead of keeping you at rikers?
Yeah, I nearly got beat to death.
and do you also know that your mother paid someone to arrange that beating?
Yeah.
the confession he wrote wasn't real, was it?
no.
tell me you didn't have him killed.
no, the kid was in too deep.
dad, come on. - If he'd started talking, he would've destroyed us all.
Oh, come on. - I couldn't let that happen.
I do what I need to do to protect the family. I always have.
what did you do?
before I tell you, I need you to promise one thing...
that when they finally come to get me, that you will do whatever you can to rebuild the company and take care of your little sister.
I promise.
would you close the doors?
in order for any of this to make sense, i need to start at the beginning...
with david clarke and what we did to him and his innocent baby girl.
whatever you want, mom, I don't have time. I'm already late for school.
I just got off the phone with the headmaster.
he told me about the suspension.
I guess we can add "teen pill popper" to the grayson book of shame.
this is no laughing matter, charlotte.
do you see me laughing?
I see you in pain.
how can I help you if you don't let me?
I tried to let you, mom. You weren't interested.
whatever answers you're looking for, you are not going to find them in a bottle of pills.
and you're not certainly not going to find them reading this trash.
Where'd you get this?
I begged you to tell me about my father, and you refused.
I had to go searching... On my own.
Oh, sweetheart.
is this why you started taking drugs?
I don't know, mom. I'm failing calculus.
you do the math.
looking good.
I missed you last night.
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't realize how tired I still was until I got over here.
thanks for being so understanding.
have you thought any more about how you want to handle the interview?
it's all I can think about.
Daniel, I know it's a lot.
you talk so much about wanting to be your own man
what if the man I am is no better than my d. n.a?
setting the record straight will help you break free from that.
if you truly don't want to follow in your parents' footsteps, then don't.
I'll try not to take offense at that remark.
a word with my son, please.
I'll see you out there, okay?
how I long for the days before emily thorne and her self-righteous indignation became part of our daily lives.
well, she'll learn soon enough.
the downside of taking that kind of moral high ground is that you have a lot farther to fall.
mom... Why did the judge grant me house arrest rather than keep me in prison?
your safety was at risk. You know that.
and you had nothing to do with it?
my suspicions were right.
you're not ready to talk to a reporter. I'm going to cancel the interview.
I'm not gonna judge you. Just tell me your side of the story.
who has been putting these crazy ideas into your head?
is it emily?
your father?
just tell me he's wrong.
sorry to interrupt.
Daniel, they're ready for you.
so, daniel, 48 hours ago, you were in jail facing a murder one charge.
now you're a free man. How you doing?
a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.
just for the record, did you murder tyler barrol?
Tyler threatened my whole family.
we struggled for control of the gun, it went off, and...
the next thing I knew, I was knocked out by the guy who finished the job.
lee moran.
according to his confession.
but the truth is, i'll never know exactly what happened between lee and tyler on that beach.
I only know how it ended.
we saw your release from rikers on the news yesterday.
occupy daniel" was even trending on twitter.
are you surprised not only by the public reaction but by the vitriol directed at you?
on-on one hand, yes. But on the other, I-I get it.
people feel disenfranchised and fed up with the privileged minority who seem to abide by their own set of rules.
listen, if anyone commits a crime, no matter who you are, he or she should pay for it.
speaking of which...
the s. e.c. Has issued an order of investigation of your family's company, grayson global, a company you stand to inherit.
would you like to comment on the allegations of corruption and fraud?
my father is the victim of a witch hunt.
the s. e.c. Has been harassing my family's company for months and is now attempting to trade to build a baseless case against it.
in my case, the truth came out.
the same will be true for my father...
who I stand behind as a son and beside as a partner in business as I prepare for my role at grayson global.
I hardly know what to say. Thank you.
so that's your plan, to go back to grayson global?
well, no one said I can't be my own man and be my father's son.
that you are.
Daniel, I need you to sign this.
sweetheart, get your coat.
Why? Where are you taking me?
you're not leaving without saying good-bye.
good-bye, Mr. Grayson.
well, don't forget this...
the key to your new lexus gs.
excuse me?
you can either drive this out of the hamptons forever or you can drive it to your new parking space at grayson global.
I can't speak for brooks, but I for one admire someone who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty.
as long as you understand that from this point forward, our hands will be intertwined.
and what about victoria?
what both you and victoria have yet to grasp is just how little she matters... To anyone.
so no more collins prep.
there is something I can do.
nolan, nolan, wait.
no, stop. Jack, I want to do this.
once upon a time ago, I was lucky enough to...
have someone take care of me when I needed it.
look, I appreciate that, but we should be taking this opportunity to get away from the graysons.
exactly.
you said you didn't want declan to go to collins prep on the graysons' dime.
so now he won't be.
he still deserves an overpriced education like everyone else, no?
Barry, my man... I need you to cut a check to collins prep.
every time I come back here, my memories always rush back to the moment I heard he died.
and the first regret I had... Is how I held you from him.
he would never get a chance to know you or you him.
you can despise me all you want, charlotte, but your father...
he was a good man.
he made one mistake that led him down a path of destruction.
I guess we have that in common.
there are so many things about you that remind me of him...
your eyes, your laugh.
do you love me...
even though every time you look at me, you think of him?
Charlotte, don't you get it?
it's because of that that I love you all the more.
mom, somebody's been here.
Emily. You okay?
I could use a drink.
anything in particular?
dealer's choice.
I'll go get the good stuff from the back.
rough day at the office?
he's one of them, nolan.
Conrad confessed everything to daniel before the intervi.
everything" everything?
Daniel could've come clean.
he could've... Ended the whole thing.
but instead...
he doubled down on grayson.
so what are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna marry him.
I'm gonna track down the man who killed my father.
and what are you gonna do when you find him?
I'm gonna kill him.
absolution is the washing away of sin...
the promise of rebirth...
and the chance to escape the transgressions of those who came before us.
the best among us will learn from the mistakes of the past, while the rest seem doomed to repeat them.
well, the truth is, i always liked david clarke.
he was reliable, efficient, good-humored.
I suppose the fact that he fit in so seamlessly around here is what made him so dangerous.
I'm sorry, Mr. Grayson, bu t that man's here agal.
he won't take no for an answer.
that'll be all for today, mr. Treadwell.
and then there are those who operate on the fringes of society...
unburdened by the confines or morality and conscience...
a ruthless breed of monsters whose deadliest weapon is their ability to hide in plain sight.
if the people I've come to bring justice to cannot be bound by the quest for absolution...
then neither will i.
the graysons murdered my father.
aunt carole, tell her about the white-haired man.
there was a man who visited grayson the morningyo.
this feeling comes along once or twice in a lifetime if we're lucky.
I want full immunity in exchange for the information i'm about to give you.
this is agent mcgowen of the s. e.c. Come down to the federal building and answer some questions.
would you like to comment on the allegations of corruption?
my father is the victim of a witch hunt.
Conrad confessed everything to daniel. He could've come clean.
he could've ended the whole thing.
what are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna track down the man who killed my father.
they say grief occurs in five stages.
first, there's denial...
followed by anger.
then comes bargaining...And depression.
36 HOURS EARLIER
Hey, did you know that amanda turned 10 this summer?
whatever happens with your investigation, can you make sure that a copy of this interview gets to her?
I guess I just want amanda to know that...
not every day is a terrible one.
your dad had a good day today, sweetheart.
I hope you did, too. I love you.
for most, the final stage of grief is acceptance.
but for me...Grief is a life sentence without clemency.
I will never accept and I will never forgive, not even after the man who killed my father lies dead at my feet.
agent mcgowen canceled his one-on-one interview.
what do you think that means?
it means their fishing expedition came up empty.
well, that's good news.
chances are, mcgowen is just gonna head for deeper waters.
so what do we do in the meantime?
we keep the p. r. Machine runninovertime to mitigate the damage they've already caused.
Ashley's plans to tie your wedding into rehabilitating our corporate image is a very good one.
just make sure emily's on board with that.
and... We need to ensure that the outstanding loose ends from your trial remain tied up, mainly... That jack porter keeps his version of the events of that night to himself.
I've got a plan for that.
good. Get on it, son.
I can't tell you how much your loyalty through this challenging time means to me.
family first, like you said.
but when we're through this, i wanna hold you to the promise you made me.
100% transparency from here on out.
are you watching? - Yeah.
what do you think daniel meant about his plan for jack?
I don't know what he's capablof anymore.
business as usual, I see.
what the hell are you doing here? the feds are all over me.
precisely the reason for my visit.
you've become, as they say in your profession, a bad asset.
look, I understand your employers are nervous, but I assure you...
I have all of this handled.
I'm afraid your word isn't going to satisfy the initiative.
well, what else can I possibly offer?
that question is being addressed as we speak.
handsome family.
you must be very proud.
my god, ems...It's him.
Emily, are you there? - I'm here.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna create a reason for them to meet again.
and then I'm gonna track the white-haired man to wherever he's hiding.
and then?
you already know the answer to that.
you feeling any better?
your headache last night-I can't remember you being sick the whole time I've known you.
well, we haven't known each other all that long, have we?
Emily, what's going on? Talk to me.
what ever happened to paris...Eloping, just the two of us?
that was before everything.
all right, grayson global has a massive image problem, and since I'm the one who's largely responsible, I feel like it's my job to fix it.
by making our wedding a big, public spectacle?
look, ashley and I are cutting out early today so she can pitch us her ideas.
a big, splashy wedding, one of your parents' events
it's not exactly me or you the last time I checked.
last time I checked, you were practically pushing me to claim my father's mantle at the company.
look, ashley's put a lot of work into this, and it may not be you or even me, but given what my family's been through, can we just sit down with her for five minutes?
please.
of course I can.
I love you. Have a good run.
Dr. Clemons is here. Should we find somewhere else to do this?
not if you're comfortable in here.
I'd hate to interrupt the progress you're making.
it's ironic, right?
Daniel goes free, and now I'm the one basically under house arrest.
no school, no father, no friends, no declan.
in terms of school, I've already spoken to the dean, and you will be starting again next week.
and as for declan, do not forget that his lies are what put you here in the first place.
his and yours.
speaking of which, dr. Clemons wants to do a family therapy session tonight.
that is never going to happen.
why, because you and dad despise each other?
Dr. Clemons says the only way I can overcome my anger issues is to learn to forgive, which will be a whole lot easier to do if you and dad do the same.
ready to get started?
Yes, why don't you, charlotte?
we'll talk about this later, hmm?
Mrs. Grayson.
agent mcgowen, why isn't my ex-husband in prison?
because we haven't found any physical evidence of a conspiracy to frame david clarke.
well, then you haven't looked hard enough.
before conrad's head of security was murdered, he told me that he had personally amassed enough evidence to put everyone involved in jail for good.
now have you searched his manhattan apartment?
our warrant is restricted to the corporate offices.
and the prosecutor can't build a federal case on your word alone.
well, he won't have to.
you and your team are obviously incapable of finding the proof that you need, but I assure you that I'm more than capable.
do you think I don't see right through this?
see through what, porter? It's a check, not a shoe bomb.
it's blood money.
it's to keep me quiet about your parents framing their personal thug for tyler's murder.
you're wrong. The guy was a drifter.
he had no ties to my parents other than the fact that he was blackmailing them.
they were victims of his, too.
Really?
come on, buddy. Drink some water.
okay, look, I get you don't trust me. I'm trying to fix that...
still not feeling well, sammy? - For emily's sake.
she told me how invested in haiti you are, and I know my trial threw off your plans to get down there and help.
I also know you have this bar and your brother and a girl somewhere out there that you care about.
and I just thought this money might help you...
do some good in the world...
any way you choose to use it.
I see you've been redecorating.
I find your choice of fine art in the foyer to be very inspired.
Yeah, well, the de kooning has a sentimental value.
Ah. You look good, conrad.
and you look like a demonic succubus.
you think I didn't know that you were the one who sicced the s. e.c. On me?
I've done no such thing.
if you go down, you'll only bring me down with you.
you've already told me that a thousand times.
you can trust me, I'm not gonna go down without a fight.
well, as strained as things have been between us, you know I wouldn't want that, conrad.
well, then I assume you're here to return the key to the apartment.
no, charlotte's the reason i'm here.
her addiction counselor has called for a family therapy session this evening.
now how shall I report back?
Oh, you can tell her, I wouldn't miss that for the world.
that's not for you.
Hello, victoria. - Lydia.
ever the opportunist, I see.
what's she doing here?
what she does best-Using her children as a wedge issue for...
what is it exactly that you came here for, dear?
Oh, well, then, please allow me to invite you to leave.
Oh, no way!
so this is where you live.
Yep, it's home sweet home.
cool.
my uncle owns a cop bar.
I spent nearly every night there growing up before my mom won the slimy rich husband lottery.
yeah?
you, uh, you want to go a round of shuffleboard?
I - I think we should just plow through this econ project.
it'll take me two seconds to kick your ass.
look, kind of something I used to do with my ex.
Oh, right, the, uh, pill head.
Charlotte's not a pill head.
she's been through a lot.
Yeah, well, who hasn't been through a lot?
I just moved here from yonkers, which, for the record, is ten times harder to get out of your system than oxy.
it's a joke, declan. Sorry for trying to make you laugh.
Yeah, I'm not in much of a laughing mood these days.
getting that.
clearly, you don't want to be here, and neither do i, so, uh, let's just get this over with.
what on god's green earth am I encrypting?
home video.
of you and daniel... - Sleeping.
I need you to e-mail an anonymous copy to conrad.
okay. This is getting kinkier and creepier by the moment.
may I ask what you hope to gain by this?
Conrad will see it as a threat.
he'll think the white-haired man is spying on his son, and he'll be forced to reach out to him.
you may be a lot of things
black belt in karate, impeccable dresser, and a certified sociopath
but you're not a killer.
you don't know what I am or what I'm capable of.
and you don't know what he's capable of, ems.
who's to say he won't kill you first?
that's a risk i'm willing to take.
send it.
I see my credit cards got some exercise this morning.
Oh, nothing's better than the second floor of bendel's.
sounds like you've had a pleasant day.
Monique lhuillier offered to design a wedding dress for me.
seems someone gave her the impression we're headed for the altar.
victoria playing one of her little games, no doubt.
not that it's the worst idea.
they do say third time's the charm.
you really know how to sweep a girl off her feet.
I'm gonna have to call you back. - Okay.
yes? - yeah, I got your message, you son of a bitch.
there's a restaurant at the corner of 7th avenue and 10th in brooklyn.
you be there at 5: 00, or I unleash a contingency plan of my own.
Emily. Where are you headed off to in such a rush?
I have to go get ready. I've got my monthly meeting with the landmark committee.
not today you don't. We got a wedding to plan.
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to reschedule.
Emily, I cleared my afternoon for this. You knew that.
I'm sure the landmark committee can survive a month without you.
but unfortunately, my epic plans for your wedding may not.
I promise, i'll make my presentation as painless as possible.
$1 million?
Jack...You must really have them worried.
the graysons are the last people I want to be indebted to, but if emily's already planning on joining 'em...
look, I-I was thinking I could start a charity with the money.
maybe it's something she and I could do together.
you still care about her, don't you?
we both do, don't we?
I care about you.
that's why you have to cash this, 'cause if you don't, they may find a more...Permanent way of keeping you quiet.
gotta take this. Nolcorp japan.
Konnichiwa.
if you meant what you said when you promised to help avenge my father, then I'm asking you to prove it to me right now.
Ems...Calm down. Breathe.
I can't. I'm stuck here with daniel, and I'm not gonna make it to the city on time.
in-in time for what?
the video worked.
Conrad's meeting the white-haired man at a restaurant at 5: 00.
this might be my last chance to track him down before he disappears again.
I need you to go there and follow him home, find out where he lives.
ems, what's going on?
I'm just, uh, letting the committee know that I won't make it on time.
Yes, absolutely. The meeting should go on without me.
that's right. It's the corner of 7th ave. And 10th street in brooklyn.
I'll call you later.
Oh, well, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?
I'm calling conrad.
we used to be such good friends, lydia. What happened?
you held me hostage at grayson manor after your attack dog threw me off the roof of my own apartment.
well, you certainly have a knack for landing on your feet, now don't you?
what are you doing here, victoria?
Conrad's finished with you, and so am i.
I am giving you a lifeline.
the question is, are you wise enough to accept it?
I learned that lesson already.
fool me twice, shame on me, right?
well, in this case, the shame is on all of us.
after all these years, the government is quietly building a case against conrad and his role in the downing of that plane, not to mention what happened to david clarke.
and given that you perjured yourself all those years ago in federal court, they're going to be coming after you, too.
you did this, didn't you?
well, let's just say, I got the ball rolling.
and I had the good fortune to secure myself immunity in exchange for my cooperation.
and as your friend, I've asked them to grant you the same courtesy.
I couldn't help but notice the de kooning the last time I was here.
Conrad had it relocated from his office.
he said it was the most important piece in his collection.
it isn't worth the canvas it's painted on, and he knows it.
I don't understand.
it's a forgery.
I know because I had it commissioned, and I passed it off on him. That's how we met.
the question is...
why would conrad hold on to something that he knows has little value whatsoever?
other than you, of course.
obviously, we're not talking william and kate territory, but you are considered american royalty.
well, daniel is.
your heritage is still a little bit...Of a mystery, emily.
but in this case, that's a good thing.
we can spin the fairy tale any way we want.
you know where I stand.
I'm a very private person. Always have been.
you can have an intimate wedding and still generate plenty of public interest, not to mention press opportunities.
front page of the sunday style sections...
like I said, I got your threat, loud and clear.
you're the only one issuing threats here.
contingency plan? - That's right.
names, dates, video recordings, bank transactions, the original hard drive from david clarke's computer
every piece of evidence from the first day you darkened my door 20 years ago straight through to the prison murder of lee moran last month.
it's quite a dossier.
mutually assured destruction. - Damn right.
if you ever threaten to harm my son, his fiancee, or anyone in my family ever again,
I detonate.
I never threatened your son.
I'm not gonna play this game with you.
whatever the hell's going on, you stay away from my family, or I'm gonna expose you and your employers to everyone.
do you understand?
that's it. - Daniel, what are you doing?
who's so important that you can't be present with me on this for five minutes without exchanging texts?
it's none of your business.
and none of this is me. Have you forgotten who I am, who you're marrying?
have you? I'm a grayson, emily.
there are certain pressures and expectations placed upon me, upon us.
maybe you've forgotten the family you're marrying into.
trust me, daniel. I couldn't forget your family if I tried.
I'm done.
please don't say you're sorry. You so clearly are not.
Hey, dec, you seen sammy?
no, I thought he was with you. Did you check upstairs?
I checked everywhere.
who's sammy? - My brother's dog.
it's freezing out there. You didn't let him out and then forget, did you?
no, no, in fact, I've had a hard time getting him to go out at all these past couple days.
I'm gonna go look for him. Give me a call if he shows up, okay?
Yeah.
screw the presentation.
if you want to go look for him, let's do it.
I finally got rid of ashley and daniel.
tell me you didn't lose him.
I've got an address. He's there now.
thank you, nolan.
once you turn this corner, emily, everything changes.
are you certain you want to do this?
it's the only thing i'm certain of anymore.
text me the address.
I'm working on a solution.
first I have to identify who's threatening grayson's family.
this isn't some nosy fed we're dealing with.
someone's on to us.
be right there!
can I help you?
uh, yeah, I'm here about the, uh, cable outages in the neighborhood.
I didn't know there was a problem with my cable.
Oh, yeah. The brownouts fried all the boxes on your block.
you didn't notice the lights flickering?
come on in.
he couldn't let you do it.
where is he?
he wouldn't say.
clearly, whatever it is you're planning tonight, it's not the answer.
Hey, I wonder what your father would think of this?
he'd probably wonder how his little girl got to such a point.
alone. That's how I got here.
but you're not alone.
Nolan intervened so that you wouldn't make a life-altering mistake.
it's not his job to protect me.
no, that was your mother and father's.
what I remember about my mother is that she was sick my entire childhood until she died, and as for my father, well, we both know what happened there.
you are so strong-willed, just like david was.
death comes on its own.
there's no need in hastening it.
tell that to the people who were on the plane when it exploded.
there might be a time and a place for kindness and fairness, but this is definitely not one of them.
good-bye, carole.
this, uh, clock shows official u. s. Me, which, uh,
I can see might be of interest to you.
or not.
sorry for the inconvenience.
one more thing before you go.
do you have a card?
I can talk to your supervisor...
to tell him how...Happy I am with the service.
coming to fix a problem I didn't even know I had.
um, you know, uh...I don't.
we're practically, uh, a papeess company.
you know, trying to offset our carbon footprint.
uh, we do have a web site where you can submit a form.
I'll do that, burt.
what's your last name?
have a good evening.
you, too, burt.
what's happened?
I came home, and she was here, tearing your painting into pieces.
she said you were hiding evidence that could destroy us all.
I - I tried to stop her, but I couldn't.
that woman is a monster, conrad.
you knew what this meant to me. I can't believe you would betray me with the one thing
I didn't betray you, ems.
I'm giving you options.
now at least you can gather intel on the guy, find out who he is.
you listen to me, nolan
how about you listen to me for once?
Hello?
Sammy? Sammy, hey, buddy.
Jack. - Emily, hey.
Sammy's here.
thank god.
I can't believe I didn't think to look there. Is he okay?
Jack, I think yobetter hurry.
it's okay, buddy.
Mrs. Grayson, why don't you go first?
dear charlotte,
I like that you're taking your counseling seriously, but I need you to stop demonizing me and lionizing yourather.
both of you.
good. Who'd like to go next?
I'll go. - Glad you could join us, mr. Grayson.
so what game are we playing?
we're playing "i like but I need."It's fun. You'll see.
just sit - That's all right, doc. I've got this from here.
I like very much that you've made the family business your own, and all I really need from you is your continued loyalty through the rough days ahead.
Charlotte, I like that you've taken control of this problem, d I need you to promise me that you'll stay on this track.
Victoria, you know, believe it or not, I actually like your spirit of self-preservation.
always have, in fact.
and I thoroughly appreciate how much you have challenged me at every turn throughout the course of our spectacular failure of a marriage...
Oh, Mr. Grayson, that's not - Because it has taught me how to see...
right through you.
and as for what I need from you, well, by gosh, all I really need is for you to come to your anemic senses and return everything you just stole from me.
and, conrad, I like that yosuspect me, predictable as you are, but I need you to know that others have been betraying you as well, even while warming your bed.
mom, What have you done now?
nothing I wouldn't do again.
this is hopeless.
nothing in this house is ever gonna change.
the only way out of it is to leave.
Bravo, conrad.
that display of yours should go miles towards helping charlotte's recovery.
I can get him into the truck, take him back to the stowaway.
he used up all his energy getting here.
I think this is where he wants to be.
even after all these years...
he's home.
you know, every day...
every day's been a gift.
I was starting to think he was gonna live forever.
I can't do it.
I don't know if I have it in me to say good-bye to him.
Sammy, thank you.
thank you for being such a good friend...
such a good listener.
and thank you for making me smile...
every day, even on the worst of 'em.
thank you for teaching me about loyalty...
and friendship.
thank you for teaching me how to love.
Oh, sammy, thank you, thank you, thank you.
are you licking daddy? - Oh, yeah, that's great.
it's okay. It's okay.
you go on now, okay?
you go play.
you go play.
we're right here.
come on.
who splashes someone with ice-cold slush and just drives off?
a trucker from yonkers.
well, look, let's get you dry. Um, I got towels in the bathroom, but one second.
here.
um, do you have any pictures of your dog?
we can take the poster boards from that presentation we're gonna fail and put them to good use.
good idea.
Oh, what are you doing here? Are you okay?
they're awful, declan...My entire family.
look, I'm...I'm so sorry for pulling your tuition.
I'll cash in one of my savings bonds
actually, I got it covered.
or nolan does. I mean, the guy's got a... Heart as big as his checkbook.
see?
someone else appreciates how good you are.
can I stay with you tonight?
are all your t-shirts deep v's? You'd do great with the girls back home in yonkers.
you work fast.
Oh, charlotte, it's not what you think it is.
YONKERS, huh?
didn't even need the trashy tee to figure that one out.
what did you just say?
because I'm pretty sure you don't know the first thing about my life.
you, on the other hand, are a walking tabloid.
everyone has things in their past they don't want people to know about.
right, declan?
are you really so blinded by your hatred for dad that you've lost sight of me and charlotte?
I have always had both of your best interests at heart.
your father is guilty of heinous crimes, daniel.
and what about you?
I knowhe t whole story, so you can quit playing innocent. Dad told me everything.
I don't know what lies he told you, but you would do well to remember that there are three sides to every story.
Oh, and which one did you sell to the feds?
you go through with destroying dad, and you're dead to me.
he was a really good friend.
so were you.
Oh, jack, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I think that should be it.
I'll go get him.
are you okay?
it's just nice, having somebody with me.
I always thought it would be amanda.
now it feels like the only part of me left hanging on to her is gonna be buried with him.
maybe sammy knew it was time for you to let go.
maybe that's why he jumped up on you in the park that day...
why he kept running over to your house.
he was leading me to you.
what are we gonna do now?
I don't know.
you're late.
relax.
I'm gog to agree to your ultimatum.
my devotion to you trumps everything, daniel.
I only hope that I can repair the damage I've caused.
this is the evidence I was planning on turning over.
now your father had it stashed away for years as insurance because he's not the only one it incriminates.
what you choose to do it with it...
is entirely up to you.
Yes, daniel?
mom buckled. She gave me the evidence.
it's right here in my briefcase. - Good work, son.
bring it to me in the morning.
I got some bad news. - Sammy?
he's gone.
I was just gonna call you.
Oh, to yell at me again for saving your life?
no. To thank you.
I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
if I had gone through with it today...
there'd be no light...Ever.
but now...
we have got eyes inside his house.
you shoulda seen me, ems.
I hacked into an electrical grid, jammed a satellite, and...
paid off a cable guy.
you'd have been proud. - I am proud.
you're a good friend.
I gotta go.
they say grief occurs in five stages.
first, there's denial.
followed by anger.
Daniel, I'm so sorry.
Oh, babe, i,u.
then comes bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
come on. Let's go to bed.
Yeah.
but grief is a merciless master.
just when you think you're free...
you realize, you never stood a chance.
8: 20?
wait. That's not right.
we lived in an electric world.
we relied on it for everything.
and then the power went out.
everything stopped working.
we weren't prepared.
fear and confusion led to panic.
the lucky ones made it out of the cities.
the government collapsed.
militias took over, controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons.
we still don't know why the power went out.
but we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way.
I'm gonna have to ask you to come with us, under the authority of the Monroe Republic. - Why?
you can't take him. - Put it down!
stop.
Danny's gone. - Dad!
my brother Miles is in Chicago.
he can get Danny.
so why would they take Danny?
we'll know when we find him.
your dad was my friend. I am going too.
I'm Nate. - Charlie.
Charlie, I'm telling you, you can't trust anyone.
we're looking for Miles Matheson.
his brother was murdered by a militia.
just you. Come with me.
no way, buddy.
she's my niece.
I don't know you.
militia, huh?
why did Monroe want my dad?
Monroe thinks your dad knew something, and he thinks your dad told me.
what?
why the lights went out, maybe how to turn 'em back on.
my mom is dad, my dad is dead, and God knows what they're doing to Danny right now.
so you are going to help me get him back.
why is that? - 'Cause we're family.
one WEEK AFTER THE BLACKOUT
I want to wear my ballet slippers.
no, we're gonna be doing a lot of walking.
it's like...
Dora. It's like a big adventure.
we are gonna walk right out of the city.
where? - To the country.
there will be a lot of food and water and...
and room to play.
can you do something for mommy?
what?
do you remember when we were in target and your brother wandered off and I was running up and down the aisles?
do you remember how scared I was? - Yes.
I need you to be a big sister.
your job, Charlie, is to not let go of your brother's hand.
to never let go of Danny's hand. Okay?
can you do that?
daddy, I smell smoke.
there might be a fire nearby.
I don't hear any sirens.
there's no more fire trucks, sweetheart.
15 YEARS AFTER THE BLACKOUT
you all right?
I'm fine, Maggie. Just thinking.
do you hear that?
Hey, where's Miles?
careful now. Monroe wants me alive, doesn't he?
that's true.
but he never said how many limbs.
miles. Miles, stop.
what? - He's unconscious.
he's a bounty hunter.
probably not alone, either.
area's crawling with them.
okay, so what you're just gonna murder him in cold blood?
Yeah, Charlie, that's the idea.
miles, please don't.
it's, like, one day into this trip.
you're already a pain in the ass.
all right. Come on, chuckles.
what?
help me get him into a boxcar.
we got to lock him up.
and that's why God caused the blackout, friends.
why he wiped away our cars and planes, batteries and spark plugs, computers and phones.
because we built ourselves an electric Tower of Babel.
Pontiac, ILLINOIS
we had power but no truth.
followers but no family.
great, they're having a sale on heroin.
what did that man do?
it's the militia.
could be anything.
spoke up.
looked at them sideways. Who knows?
Danny's riding with guys like that and we're...
what are we doing here?
told you. I need to talk to somebody.
miles, wait.
my little brother's out there somewhere.
he hasn't been more than five miles from home since he was a kid and it's my job to look out for him.
if you want to see him again, we're gonna have to go up against Monroe himself and a couple thousand of his men.
I can't do that alone.
I need help and my help is here.
be right back. - Where are you going?
this little place called "shut up and stay here.
I'm looking for somebody who plays cards here.
a lot of people play cards here.
you'd remember this one.
what's your business with Nora?
look, I just need to know where she is, okay?
who's asking? - Don't you know?
this is Miles Matheson.
you should have killed me when you had the chance.
that's what I said.
so how'd you get out?
I think I broke every bone in my hand trying to punch my way through the wood, but...
what can I say?
you're worth it.
I don't suppose we could call it a draw?
you tell me where Nora is...
with the price tag Monroe's got tacked on your ass?
I don't think so.
well...
give it your best shot.
we'll see what happens.
okay. Let's see what happens.
Yeah, I don't know them.
Really?
they were walking around the train yard with you.
so? I met them yesterday.
I've been trying to bang the British chick.
then you won't care if I slice them open.
all right! All right!
let them go.
miles. - Not a word.
let's go.
is Nora here or not?
no.
where is she?
she's probably dead by now.
she got arrested for stealing militia gold.
they put her in some work camp South of here.
in Fort Chatsworth, I think.
you hear that?
What'd that sound like to you, Danny boy?
can I help you?
you know, my wife Julia, she grills these venison steaks.
I don't know what she does to them, but, man, oh, man!
it's like she smothers them with love.
Sounds...good.
you'll get a lot of steaks out of this guy.
burly son of a bitch.
how'd you bring him down?
crossbow.
and I suppose he got this buckshot from a bar fight?
listen, I don't know what you think that I... - Sir.
are you familiar with the Baltimore act?
it shall be unlawful for any citizen of the Monroe Republic to buy, sell, own, or transport any firearm.
except loyal militia of course.
now the penalty for this...
is death.
so I'm gonna only ask you once.
is there something you'd like to share?
thank you.
search the house.
Hey, hey, that's all I got.
and you're just a beacon of trust.
easy, son.
easy, easy, easy, easy. Just take it easy there.
let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Open up.
sir.
burn it.
burn everything!
sergeant Strausser.
what do you think you're doing?
I was interrogating the suspect, sir.
not like this.
we're not animals.
sir, are you all right?
I'm Sebastian Monroe.
president of the Republic and general of its militia.
I know who you are.
look, I am sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
but you do know why you're here.
I need to know where the other rebels are.
now, you tell me, you'll be with your family inside a week. I guarantee you.
look, you rebels are bombing my camps. You're killing my men.
you're terrorists.
but hasn't there been enough violence?
don't people have the right to be safe?
happy?
people aren't happy.
they're scared to death of you.
but I'm not.
no, no, no.
you know, it was probably all my fault.
Yeah. It was, I blame myself.
we made it out okay.
Yeah. That went like clockwork.
swiss Army knife, please. Aaron?
what's this? - Just...
what are you doing with an iPhone?
swiss Army, please.
Charlie, next time I tell you I want to kill somebody, let me kill them.
she's gonna get herself killed.
Thanks.
what are you doing? - I'm learning my lesson.
I'll meet you in two weeks.
main street in Lowell, Indiana. You got that?
no, wait. You're leaving?
I got to go get Nora.
we need her.
who is this woman anyway?
she's really good at blowing stuff up.
and we can't get Danny back without her, trust me.
miles, please, let us come with you.
Hey, you dragged me out here!
Lowell, Indiana. Two weeks.
miles, come...
Where's my pack?
you've got to be joking.
damn it.
I went after Miles. I'm sorry. Please don't worry. Charlie.
you?
I better take a look at it. - I don't need your help, Nate! Stay away!
that's good, Charlie.
really, I'm impressed. - Don't be.
you were stomping around like an elephant back there.
why are you following me?
I'm following your uncle. Same as you.
those are the orders. Bring him back alive.
so you're militia.
you used me to flush him out.
you're a son of a bitch.
so you're just gonna leave me like this?
Yeah. You're such a crack soldier, you can figure a way out.
is your name even Nate?
no.
I've got orders.
but then why'd you save me?
Maggie, slow down.
we can still catch up.
we don't know where she went, and we can't hunt...
not like she can. - Aaron, please.
she will find Miles, but we will never find her, not without a GPS.
so you're saying we just let her go off to some militia prison camp.
I'm not happy about this either.
but we'll see her again. - How do you know that, Aaron?
how do you know that?
just...You know, we will.
do you want to know the reason why I keep this?
because somewhere inside are the only pictures of my kids.
birthdays, first steps, their whole lives...
and I don't have a single photo to hold in my hands.
I spend hours staring at this stupid thing, because it's getting harder and harder to remember their faces.
so I'm sorry...
but there's no way of knowing who we'll see and who we won't see again...
not anymore.
Hey, cap...
I'm pretty messed up, huh?
I'm afraid so, son.
it's die quick or die painful.
that's all you got left.
you drink every drop.
then you sort of drift off. You won't feel a thing.
I'm scared.
don't be.
down the hatch, son.
where you're going you'll be warm and rested and fed.
you'll be with your family.
and the best part...
you'll bask in the brightest, most beautiful light.
mommy? Why are we here?
daddy had to get some things from our work. He'll be right back.
my ball!
you like basketball? - Yes.
me, I,uh...
I love the Bulls, but they probably played their last game, huh?
Charlie. Charlie, come over here.
she's beautiful. - Charlie, come here.
such a pretty face.
I'd hate to have to smash it in.
I'd like your food, please...
all of it.
damn it, Charlie. You're killing me. What are you doing here?
I'm coming with you.
I told you I would come and find you.
not good enough! You need to let me come with you! - Look, I get it. You want your brother.
you've been abundantly clear on the subject. - No, you don't get it!
you need to let me help, okay?
Why? - Because it's my fault, Miles!
what are you talking about?
I took care of Danny.
after my mom died, it was me.
he gets these asthma attacks.
so I had to watch him.
I wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a stretch, checking on him...
ten times every night just to make sure he was still breathing.
I didn't let him out of my sight...
until the day that they took him, because I was off pouting like some brat.
and if I was there, maybe I could have stopped them.
maybe my dad would still be alive.
maybe Danny wouldn't be off scared and alone.
and if he gets sick, they're not...
miles, I can't sleep.
you got to let me help. I can't just sit there and wait.
okay. So, uh, I have a confession to make.
Ben gave me this.
he said to keep it safe and to bring it to a woman named Grace Beaumont in Grant Park, Illinois.
who is she? - I don't know.
Why? Why her?
Maggie, what if we could get the power back on?
what if you could go home again?
what if you could see your kids again?
so, we take this to this Grace woman, and she does what with it?
I don't know. Ben just said she knew something about the power.
this doesn't make any sense.
but that...that's the thing.
I think it actually might.
how? - The blackout.
that doesn't make any sense...
totally corn-holed the laws of nature.
and it shouldn't be permanent.
we should be able to fix this.
but for some reason, we just can't.
but if it were man-made...- Man-made?
why would someone do something like that?
listen, if I'm right, then this is good news.
this is the best news. - How?
because if it's man-made, then maybe we can fix it.
and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen. - Amen.
go ahead.
spit it out.
I'm sorry. What?
have some conviction!
if you think something, then say it.
you don't like that I killed that traitor back there, even though he owned guns and a rebel flag, even though he shot one of my boys.
but I'll tell you what I think.
I think the Monroe militia is the one thing between us and total anarchy.
maybe it's just a finger in the dam, but it's the only order we got left.
do you want to know what I think?
I think that you tell yourself that.
I think the truth is you like to kill...
because you're a murderer and a psychopath.
I appreciate the honesty.
move it!
lift!
lift!
lift!
let's go! Move!
crazy son of a bitch must actually think he can get the power going.
who? - General Monroe.
and if he does...
imagine what he can do with one of those.
got to get it over this hill before sundown!
What'd those prisoners do?
most of them probably just didn't pay their taxes.
that's Nora.
Hey! Get up!
get up right now.
they're gonna kill you. Get up.
up, you lazy piece of crap!
I'll tell you something...I might be good with a sword, but
I got Jack squat against a rifle like that.
buddy, I'd keep your hands off if I...
Hi.
no. Get out of here.
these aren't even locked. - 'Cause I picked it. Now go.
Hey, man. She doesn't want to go. Take me!
shut up!
come on. Go, go, go, go, go.
Hey, wake up. Wake up!
thank you so much.
I didn't want to be rescued, Miles.
and I sure as hell didn't need to be.
you could have fooled me. You were on a chain gang.
on purpose. - Yeah, but...
wait. What?
I got arrested on purpose.
give me some credit.
I'm working a job.
what job?
the sniper rifle.
I'm stealing the sniper rifle.
you went through all that trouble for a rifle?
who the hell is this?
I'm his niece.
you have family?
most people do.
and, yes, the rifle is more than worth it. The militia controls all the guns.
so a beauty like that on the black market...Priceless.
I was gonna sneak up, slit the warden's throat, take the gun, but now sneaking's kind of out.
well, how was I supposed to know that?
you weren't. You were supposed to keep the hell away from me. Remember?
things are different now.
like how?
like how, Miles?
like me.
he's here because of me.
Meaning?
the militia took my brother, and he's gonna get him back.
seriously, what's your angle?
no angle. This is for real, Nora.
and I want you to come with us.
you owe me.
for that amazing rescue?
you know what for.
okay.
but I'm getting that gun first.
you're never gonna get close to that rifle, not now, not without him shooting you with it.
you want my help?
we're getting that gun.
not exactly a Colt . 45, but it'll do the trick.
you're gonna shoot the warden? With that?
Yeah, Miles, that's the idea.
that thing only works from a foot away.
how are we gonna get close enough?
we'll sneak up.
in broad daylight?
they know what you look like.
and they'll kill me on sight.
so I'll do it.
some innocent girl lost in the woods. I can get close.
I like her.
I like her a lot.
forget it.
it's a good idea, Miles.
she just takes out the warden.
and you and I sweep up the rest.
you can't do it.
I appreciate the concern, but I... - No, no.
I mean you actually cannot do it.
you will choke.
I won't.
you, who bitched about me killing somebody in cold blood, you're just gonna walk up, shoot somebody in the face - for a sniper rifle?
it's not about the rifle. And it's not about you or her.
Really? What's it about?
the 30 innocent people down there who are working as slaves.
and it's insane to me that neither of you have even mentioned it.
what the hell's wrong with you?
so what do I have to do?
here we go! - Lift.
lift. Lift.
You...Put it down right now.
I'm sorry. I was just hunting.
what the hell are you doing?
I was hunting. I got lost.
Hey! Take it easy.
bring her over here.
I'll snap her neck. Stay back.
it's okay, baby. It's okay.
let her go.
okay, you sure you want to do that?
what if you hit your little girl?
come here, baby.
I'm just hungry.
Hey, stop. We need that food.
I can't let you take it. I'll shoot!
I don't think you will.
I said stop!
so you're lost, huh?
I know the area pretty good.
where you from?
gun!
okay, I got to hand it to you.
you did good.
did good"?
Yeah. All these people are free.
I killed two men today.
maybe that's not a big deal for you.
maybe it's another Monday or whatever, but it is to me.
we shouldn't have to do this.
things should be...
I don't know...
you are...
very unusual.
what's that supposed to mean?
it's not an insult, Charlie.
son of a bitch.
what?
when did you get that?
just relax.
you're not selling that sniper rifle, are you?
you're gonna give it away to the resistance.
everyone changes, Miles.
you joined the rebels? You?
what do you mean,"rebels?
a bunch of deluded, bleeding-heart...- Patriots...
trying to bring back the United States.
the will lynch you on the spot for this.
maybe.
or maybe I'll take out general Monroe first.
Hello, Grace.
come on.
Randall IS HERE
they treating you well?
I told them...Anything you want...Wine, ice...
thank you, Bass.
what more could I possibly ask for?
it's always nice to see you, Rachel.
it's always nice to see someone who knew me from the old days.
you were a womanizing drunk, and I liked you a lot better then.
everyone did.
miles did.
hell, I think even I did.
why are you here?
I have some bad news, Rachel.
Ben's dead.
you're lying.
I wish I was.
I...I take it you're the one who killed him.
understand me that it's the last thing that I ever wanted.
I'm sorry.
are we finished here?
no.
there's something else.
I have your son.
no more games, Rachel.
you want to see your boy again, you're gonna talk...
about Ben...
about the power...
about everything, you understand?
all the birds of a feather

lt's okay. lt's okay.
l'll take care of you.
stupid clock.
good morning, Blu.
come here!
Tyler Blu Gunderson!
you know these vitamins are good for you.
what's this?
gotcha !
enjoy the new book!
Thanks, Linda !
Bye, now.
Yes, Mom, l'd love to visit, but who would take care of Blu?
mom ! they don't have kennels for parrots.
here's your hot chocolate, Blu!
just how you like it.
Plus, l don't trust leaving Blu with just anyone.
no, l don't have a bird-sitter.
this is the life.
the perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio.
well, well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird.
very funny. Real mature.
Hey, pet! Where you migrating to this year?
the breakfast nook?
throw all the snowballs you want.
l'm protected by this magical force-field called glass.
lt's what keeps us so toasty and warm in here while you guys are out there freezing your...
classy.
are you all right?
l'm not really built for this weather.
are you looking for some books?
books? No. No.
l have come 6, 000 miles looking for him.
doctor of Ornithology?
he's magnificent.
Linda? Little help here. Linda !
Wow!
you're actually communicating.
Yes! l introduced myself and shook my tail feathers counter-clockwise thus deferring to his dominance.
l did not get that at all.
so, Dr. Monteiro...
no " Doctor, " please, just call me Tulio.
you know, your macaw is a very special bird.
ln fact, as far as we know,
Blu is the last male of his kind!
Really?
Yes, and recently, we found a female and our hope is to bring the two of them together to save their species.
well, yeah, sure, when can she come over?
no, no. She is in Brazil.
Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro.
Rio? Brazil?
no. No, no, no.
l never let Blu out of my sight. He needs me.
no. You misunderstand.
lt's all arranged.
you will be with him every step of the way.
and l will be with you.
look, l know you're doing your job, but l can't...
well, Blu is very particular.
and we have our little routine here and we're not big on travel.
heck, he doesn't even fly!
but of course he can fly!
he's a perfect specimen.
what are you doing?
don't worry, their natural instincts always take over.
wait, wait, wait! No, no!
well, almost always.
what kind of doctor are you?
are you okay?
perhaps, he's too domesticated.
lt was very nice of you to stop in and squawk around and throw my bird.
but now it's time for you to go.
l'm very sorry. l'm very sorry, but...
wait, wait, Linda. Linda !
this could be our last chance.
have a safe flight.
Linda, please, listen to me.
lf we don't do this, his whole species will be gone!
just think about it.
natural instincts!
there is nothing natural about being thrown halfway across the room.
well, l'll show him.
l can do this.
l just have to work out the physics.
l have quadrated my vector angles.
l've adjusted for wind shear.
positive reinforcement.
good.
okay, let's see.
flaps open. Perfect.
landing gear. Check.
tail flaps. Operational.
and, actually, not bad.
this is it.
let's fly.
just keep it simple.
thrust, lift, drag and weight.
thrust, lift, drag, weight.
thrust, lift, drag, weight.
thrust, lift, drag... Wait!
l promised l would always look out for you, didn't l?
and have l ever broken a promise?
l'm scared, too but l wouldn't make you do this if it wasn't the right thing to do.
what do you say, Blu?
that's my big, brave boy.
and we'll be back home before we even know it.
your turn, Blu!
you don't want to get beak-burn.
whoa ! what is going on here?
you arrived in time for Carnaval!
Carnaval?
Yes, it's the biggest party in the world.
you know, a time to have fun and dance!
Oh, my!
ls she a performer?
no, in fact, she's my dentist.
Dr. Barbosa !
don't forget to floss, Tulio!
you got it!
come tomorrow night, everyone will be dressed like that.
not me.
Oh, right yeah.
l am not from here.
Hey, Nico, he's a tourist!
funny, you don't look like one.
Really? l don't?
except you got pigeon doo-doo on your nose.
Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000.
so, are you here for Carnaval?
actually, l'm just here to meet a girl.
a girl! -Yes!
little word of advice, you make the first move.
brazilian ladies respond to confidence.
right.
Yeah, it's all about swagger. You got to puff out that chest!
swing that tail!
eyes narrow, like some kind of crazy love-hawk!
but first we got to bust you out. -What?
Yeah! l'm gonna pop that cage open like a soda can!
no, no. Wait!
no, no, no, that's okay.
you call that popping?
this thing is robust.
no, no, guys, really, l'm fine. The cage is great.
love the cage!
suit yourself!
don't forget, love-hawk!
Yes, yes, Bem...
and to you, as well.
this is the heart and soul of our aviary.
our treatment room.
they really like you.
a lot.
Yes. l'm their great, big mama bird.
Wow!
want some?
l'm good.
many of the birds here were rescued from smugglers.
smugglers?
Yes! And unfortunately, the poor birds are often hurt or even killed in the process.
but with proper care, they can be saved.
look here.
this poor guy was found last night.
Hey, buddy! You're looking great today.
much better, much better!
get well soon!
so, where is Jewel?
we have a special place for Jewel.
she's a very spirited bird.
l'll say.
she did that?
charming. Okay, l want to go home now.
no, no. Don't worry.
l'm going to make you look irresistible.
help! Help! Let me out of here!
Linda !
maybe l should...
no, no. Give it a chance.
Hello?
Hello?
l come in peace.
whoa. She's beautiful.
what were they talking about? She's like an angel.
an angel who's getting really close...
you're standing on my throat.
you're an American.
Thanks. l need my throat for talking.
so, thank you.
you look like me.
Hi.
Hi, my name is Blu.
like the cheese with the mold on it.
you know, that smells really bad.
that's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
come on. We don't have much time.
wait, wait, wait.
are you ready? -For what?
Wow. Okay.
confidence. Crazy love-hawk.
all right.
whoa, what are you doing?
what? What you wanted me to.
but just for argument's sake, what are you doing?
l am trying to escape.
Yeah, escape, that's where l was going with that thing l just did.
wait, wait. Did you actually think we were going to kiss?
No! lt's not what you think.
we just met.
Oh, my god.
l think they need a little help.
l know how my feathers look, but l am not that kind of bird.
okay, l had nothing to do with that.
but, you have to admit it's actually a pretty good song.
naturally
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.
Wow. That was fast.
Lionel Richie works every time.
we should probably give them some privacy.
l'm not so sure l should leave Blu here alone.
no, don't worry.
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.
besides, he's got Jewel.
help me!
this is the final countdown to Carnaval!
let's samba!
come here, poor little birdie.
lt's okay, l got you. l got you.
excuse me.
please, l am trying to sleep.
l'm sorry, sleepy-head, l'm trying to escape.
escape? Why? This cage is awesome.
this...
what was l thinking?
l wouldn't expect a pet to understand.
pet? Did you just call me a pet?
for the record, l am not a pet.
l am a companion.
and you know what? Do whatever you want 'cause tomorrow morning, Linda will come for me and this whole nightmare will be over.
lncredible!
you would rather be with a human than with your own kind.
well, that human has given me love and affection for the past 15 years whereas my own kind try to strangle me after 15 seconds.
Yeah, well, because of them, l've lost everything.
you can't trust them.
of course... you can trust humans.
jewel? Jewel?
Hi, there.
lt was nice of you to join me for dinner.
l often eat alone.
because, of course, my work.
l thought l was the bird nut until l met you.
Yes, right.
do you have a favorite bird?
well, obviously, l'm a blue macaw kind of gal.
that makes sense. They are very handsome birds.
actually, it's the brains l'm more attracted to.
l'm not so impressed by fancy feathers.
l know exactly what you mean.
my favorite bird is the spotted owl.
l've always been mesmerized by those big... round, intelligent eyes.
chicken hearts?
chicken hearts! Oh, gosh.
Hello?
we should have never left Moose Lake.
this is all my fault.
no, no, Linda, Linda, please. This is not your fault.
you're right.
lt's not my fault.
lt's your fault! -What?
with your little bird talk.
and that whole " save the species. "
well, you know what?
squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk!
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to curse.
l don't understand.
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.
so, let me get this straight.
you were attacked by a little white bird?
Yes, with this rag.
he held it to my mouth like this.
we're doomed.
okay.
there's no place like home, there's no place like home.
how l wish l was back in my own cage with my mirror and my swing, and my little bell.
how l miss my little bell.
play dead.
what? l don't need to play dead, l'm about to have a heart attack.
just do it!
fine.
stop twitching.
come on, it's the twitching that sells it.
come on in, kid.
well, what do you know?
good work, Fernando.
you see, boys?
what did l tell you about this one?
that you were going to pay him half as much as you said?
no, you idiot.
that he reminds me of myself when l was that age.
smart, resourceful.
here you go, kid.
Hey. This is only half of what you promised me.
shut up, kid.
what the...
l thought l told you l needed these birds alive.
tell me, Fernando...
does this look alive to you?
get her! Come over here!
jewel!
come here!
hello... pretty bird.
what's the matter? Cockatoo got your throat?
Nigel!
alive.
to be continued.
that was your plan?
to take off and leave me? Gee, thanks.
well, why didn't you follow me?
nice work, Nigel.
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.
the last blue macaws on earth.
these are worth a fortune.
Hey, Fernando, hang these up in the other room.
Hey, birdie!
let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here!
who's a pretty bird? l'm a pretty bird.
pretty bird, l'm a pretty bird. l'm a pretty bird.
l was framed. They got the wrong guy.
sorry, guys. Nothing personal.
so, what's going to happen to them?
don't worry, we're going to find good homes for them.
now go home to your mama.
but l don't have a mama.
father?
brother? -Goldfish?
can we keep him, boss?
no.
so, Marcel, what's really going to happen to those birds?
plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares?
all l know is we're going to be rich.
we're gonna be rich!
come on, come on! The game is starting!
come on, come on! The game is starting!
Yes, you were very clear.
tomorrow or the deal is off.
of course l have both the macaws.
Yes, l will deliver them myself.
all right, you two... you load the truck tonight.
and first thing in the morning, we bring those birds to the airport.
you got it?
Yeah, sure. -All right. Heard you.
and one of you, feed Nigel.
rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Yes!
Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock.
Oh, man. How come you always win?
nice birdie.
here you go.
cannibal.
okay, pull it together. The key is not to panic.
l'm not panicking.
l wasn't talking to you, l was talking to me.
but it's okay, because any minute now, Linda will find us.
great. And then she'll stick us behind another set of bars, right?
Yeah. l mean, no.
look, pet, cages might work for you, but l don't want to belong to anyone.
something seems to be lodged in my beak.
would you mind?
l know l'm not a pretty birdie...
but l used to be quite a looker.
a star.
lights, camera, action.
l was striking, suave, ambitious. Feet to beak...
so birdie-licious
now l'm vile, l am villainous, and vicious
Oh, and malicious l had it all A TVshow, women, too l was tall Over one-foot-two
then they got a pretty parakeet to fill my shoes
that's why l am so evil, why l do what l do.
he was a super star
so young and vital
he's nasty
a South American ldol
he's a suspicious bird
who said that about me?
a very vicious bird -l'll have you rotisseried l'm a feathery freak With a beak
a bird murderer
you think you're badder than me? l never heard of ya l'm evil, l'll fill your cheese balls with weevils l poop on people and l blame it on seagulls lt was him.
he's a nasty bird -l'm invincible -He's ghastly -l'm un-mince-able l'm unwashable, unrinseable
like an abandoned school l have no principle
all of you Brazilian birds
all 80 million birds l'll tell you what l'm going to do l'm going to make you
shut up, now. Shut up!
lt's just me.
l will make you ugly...
...too.
Hey!
sweet nightmares.
not cool, man!
scary, but not cool!
Hey, are you okay?
no, l am definitely not okay!
wait. What are you doing?
getting out of here.
are you going to help me or what?
actually, all the survival guides say to sit and wait, and help will come.
no one is coming!
we are on our own and if we just sit here, we're going to die!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
No!
Nigel! Get out of the way!
hold on!
stop! Stop! Why don't you just open the door?
are you kidding me?
what? lt's just a standard flip slide bolt.
come on! Let's fly!
what are you doing?
l can't.
what? You can't what?
l can't fly!
you couldn't tell me this before now?
lt didn't matter before now!
l hate you.
ls there anything else l need to know?
Yes, l can't fly, l pick my beak, and once in a while l pee in the bird-bath.
happy?
there they are! We got to get out of here!
just move! Move!
wait, wait. Listen to me.
flying may not be my thing, but walking is.
follow my lead. lnside leg, outside leg.
Yeah, okay, l got it.
lnside, outside, inside, outside!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes. Yes! -Come on!
see? l'm bilingual, too!
this is great!
l'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly!
actually, there are about 40 species of flightless birds.
duck! -No, ducks can fly.
No! Duck!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
hold on!
No!
No!
No!
get out of here, you putrid poultry!
what was that?
a stick.
and that?
lt's just a rock.
right. Yeah.
ls that a spider on my back?
will you quit it?
lt's just a leaf. Turn around.
leaf. Told you.
now, come on, we need to find a safe place to spend the night.
safe? Safe?
we are in the jungle.
you know when people say, " lt's a jungle out there " ?
well, l'm pretty sure they don't mean it as a good thing.
look, l hate to break it to you, but this is where our kind naturally lives.
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
l watch Animal Planet.
l know all about the food chain.
you see? Out here, l'm just an hors d'oeuvre.
nothing more than a feathery spring roll.
that is why we stay in the trees and not on the ground.
after you.
no, l don't think so.
no. l would feel much more comfortable in something man-made.
Hey, how about up there?
l can't believe l have to drag your clumsy butt up there.
drag me?
watch and learn.
Blu! Just wait one...
who's dragging whose butt now?
very funny.
you see? Who needs flying?
birds. Birds need flying.
flying is...
lt's freedom and not having to rely on anyone.
don't you want that?
l don't know. lt sounds a little lonely.
let's get some sleep.
l'm probably going to be up for a little while.
because l'm still on Minnesota time.
good night.
good night, Jewel.
good night, Linda.
excuse me, sir?
have you seen my bird?
have you seen my bird?
excuse me? Have you seen my bird?
have you seen my bird?
blue feather.
lady! American lady!
Blu? -Where?
Wow. l know where your birds are.
you found Blu? Are you sure?
lt's his!
let me see that.
you're right.
okay. Where is he?
come on, let's go! l'll take you to him.
no, no. Linda, wait.
we don't know this boy.
we can't trust him.
l have to trust him.
l don't have a choice.
do you think l'm an idiot?
they were two birds chained together in a cage.
how could you lose them?
they outsmarted us, boss.
but don't worry, we'll get them back.
l have a plan.
great. What are you going to do?
wander the city calling " Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie " ?
well, anything sounds dumb when you say it like that.
okay. We have to get the birds to the airport tonight.
but it's Carnaval. All the roads will be blocked by the parade.
and that's why l wanted to go this morning.
Nigel.
this bird is 10 times smarter than the two of you combined.
Yeah, well, if he's so smart, then why don't you put him in charge?
l am putting him in charge.
stop suggesting things.
go find them, Nigel.
lf we can't get through the parade, we'll have to be in the parade.
are you sure this is going to work?
positive. Check out my math.
Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you.
look, let's just get this chain broken.
right. Then we can go and find Linda.
no, you can go find Linda.
once this chain is off, l'm going to go back to being free in the jungle. Deal?
fine. Deal.
nice try, brainiac.
l think something is watching us.
be careful, Blu. They might snuggle you to death.
come here.
lntruders!
cut it out!
now stop...
No! Don't!
attack!
help!
what's going on down there?
go, go. Off with you.
daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
l've told you a thousand times.
Manoela, Sofia, come on now, listen to me.
Oh, yeah, right in the eye.
precious, aren't they?
kids? Seventeen of them and one on the way.
Hey! He's not a maraca, stop shaking him !
they're giving me gray feathers.
this papa needs a break.
so, you two lovebirds headed for Carnaval?
lovebirds? -We're more like acquaintance-birds.
not even that, we're more like chained-to-each-other birds.
Yeah. l mean, if...
what is it with this kid and the feathers?
we have no idea. We're having him tested.
so, do you think you could help us get this thing off?
lucky for you, you know Rafael, and Rafael knows everyone.
again with the eye.
okay, want me to call your mother?
No!
works every time. They're scared to death of her.
call me for what?
Eva, my love...
l must take this young couple to see Luiz.
Luiz!
you don't fool me for a second.
you and your amigo just want to sneak off to Carnaval.
Carnaval.
that magical time when l met the most beautiful bird in the world.
l still remember the song that was playing when l first laid eyes on you.
come on, baby, sing it!
like a river of the sweetest honey.
l guess love is deaf, too.
come here.
okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back.
you are an angel.
l'll miss you my juicy little mango.
l'll miss you my pudgy papaya.
Hey! Marco! Carlos! Put your brother down, now!
l can't believe she actually let me go.
so, how far is this Luiz?
not far. Thirty minutes as the crow flies.
and how long as the macaw walks?
Bobo here can't fly. -But he's a bird.
not all birds fly.
there are ostriches... There are ostriches...
you're not an ostrich.
not technically, but... -Wait.
my friends, l want to help, but to walk the whole way...
lt can't be done!
Where's Daddy?
daddy? Daddy? -Come over here. Go back to your room.
but, hey.
we might as well give it a shot. Let's go quickly.
no, don't look back. They sense fear.
what an adorable monkey.
Hey! My watch!
Hello, boys.
seems like you've had a busy day.
what? This?
this is just some stuff we found.
right, boys?
Yeah. -Yeah.
l'm not interested in your nicked knick-knacks.
your burgled baubles bore me.
there are two blue macaws out there and l need your multitude of eyes to help me find them.
yeah? What's in it for us?
well, that's a fair question.
let's discuss it.
l certainly see your point, but what could l possibly do for you in return?
save me! Save me!
well, that's a thought. Yeah.
but is it enough?
l don't want to feel like l'm cheating you.
help me! Help me! No, no!
we'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.
save me!
all right, you've twisted my wing.
deal.
now then? Any more questions?
no? Good.
you will spread out and you will find these macaws by the end of the day or it's flying lessons for everyone!
go!
go do your monkey business.
l've changed my mind, yeah.
maybe we can find a bus schedule or something.
come on, you're not going to back out now.
not in front of the lady.
okay, yeah. Yeah, sure.
all right, that's the spirit.
you're sure you're up for this?
Yeah, yeah. l mean, it's not like we're just hurling ourselves off a mountain or something.
right?
actually that was pretty much my entire plan.
what?
don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA.
and if our featherless friends can do it, how hard can it be?
wait, wait!
mommy!
fun, right?
Yeah. Fun.
okay. l need you two to get closer.
closer.
closer.
nice.
now put your wings around each other.
what? -Come on, amigo!
lt's not like she's going to bite!
will you?
we'll see.
now, you flap your right wing, you flap your left wing, and together you fly.
but this doesn't seem aerodynamically possible.
you think too much.
flying is not what you think up here, it's what you feel in here.
and when you feel the rhythm of your heart, it's like samba.
you fly!
see? lt's easy!
easy?
easy for you to say, because from here it looks really, really hard.
Hey, if you want to see Linda again, this is the only way.
okay. You're right.
Yes, l am. -This is for Linda.
right. -Keep it simple.
easy breezy.
thrust, lift, drag...
come on! Let's go! -Wait!

Hey, guys.

l just wanted to see if you had any work for me.
well, if you were here two hours ago, you could've helped us load the...

so no one will notice us when we smuggle these...
shut up!
we made a float.
a float!
so you guys are going to the parade. Can l come?

l thought it was right here.
there it is.

shut up!
no. We can't let them get on that plane.
you can drive a motorcycle, right?

lt's just like riding a snowmobile.
what happened?
Papa?
what happened?
Oh, no! Let me go.
stop your chirping and talk to me!
no, no. l don't know anything. Help!
when l bite down on your head, will it go " pop, " or will it go " crack " ?
where are the cerulean birds?
that means blue, by the way.
they escaped. Went to Luiz.
anything else?
they said you were very nice.
did they?
liar.
and handsome, too.
never send a monkey to do a bird's job.
don't worry. l got it.
there he goes. That's my boy.
ls it hot? l think l'm sweating.
l didn't even think that was biologically possible, and yet, look.
Wow.
Yeah, that's your boy, all right.
okay, so he needs a little help.
come on, let's give him some.
set the mood.
all right, look, l'm on it.
l know how to set the mood. Check it out.
get a, Get a, Get a Get a girl
get, Get, Get Get a girl
take her, take her to the floor Show her, show her how you roll
drop it, drop it, drop it low Drop it low, drop-drop it low
what kind of mood is that?
Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive.
l'm not hating on your creativity, but l think l got this one.
follow my lead.
now, that's more like it.
wasn't really thinking Wasn't looking
wasn't searching for an answer ln the moonlight
when l saw your face
Wow! What a beautiful sunset.
Yeah.
down here.
just tell her, " You have beautiful eyes. "
that's good. Great idea.
l have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice.
no, her eyes. Her eyes.
right, yeah. Your eyes, your eyes are great, not mine.
l mean, mine are okay.
but yours, l bet you can see right through them.
just tell her how you feel.
jewel. -Yeah.
l've been wanting to tell you that l...
that l...
how sweet. You're getting choked up.
you're choking! Okay! All right!
come on, Blu, move with me. Stay with me, Blu.
one more, come on. One more time!
Yep, that's my boy.
ladies and gentlemen, l give you Luiz's garage.
after you. -No, no, you first.
please, l insist.
okay.
guess this is it.
Yeah. Quite an adventure.
end of the line.
Yes.
guess things like this don't happen in Tiny-soda.
Tiny-soda?
wait, Minnesota. -Yeah.
that's very good. That's very funny actually.
Luiz! Are you here, Luiz? Hey, buddy!
l got some friends l want you to meet.

lnside, outside, inside, outside!
l got you's good.
what?
l could've ripped your throats out, but l didn't.
but l could've.
Hey, Luiz! Stop scaring my friends.
Hey, Rafi, come here!
where you've been?
you look good.
wait. Luiz is a bulldog?
you got something against dogs?
l do when they're drooling on me.
lt's a medical condition.
no, hey, amigo, we really need you.
she's mean, bro. -Luiz, come on, please, please.
we need your help.
l think l know what to do.
are you sure this is safe?
sure. There's nothing to it.
now, if something goes wrong, scream really loud!
because l can't hear too good with this thing on.
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.
don't worry. He's a professional.
now, try not to move!
l can't really see out of this thing, either!
Hey! Where did you go?
gross.
but l'm free.
jewel! Jewel! We're free!
slimy, but free.
contaminated probably, but free.
can you believe it's finally...
...over.
Yeah!
come on, guys, let's go!
what are we standing around for?
lt's Carnaval!
Oh, yeah!
Yep.
l know just how you feel.
watching them up there makes you want to chase them and grab them in your mouth and bite their heads off, huh?
l'm just kidding, bro.
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.
l'm flying, flying just like a bird!
jewel, but you are a bird!
Hey! Where you going?
Blu, what's wrong?
nothing. Everything is perfect.
you'll be off to the rainforest, l'll be back with Linda, just like we planned.
Hey, birds! Stop yapping and start flapping!
let's go!
l guess, l thought, maybe...
what? That you'd come to Minnesota?
great, l guess l'll knit you a scarf.
no, that's not what l meant.
look, Jewel, l can't spend my life walking around following you wherever you're going.
Hey, it's not my fault you can't fly.
awkward.
okay, okay.
you know what? This is good.
just clear the air.
just be completely honest with each other.
you want honesty?
fine, l can be honest.
l don't belong here.
ln fact, l never wanted to come here in the first place.
and... And...
and you know what?
l hate samba.
Hey! That's a little too far.
make the mean bird take it back.
Yeah, l said it.
every song sounds exactly the same.
tico, taco, ya, ya, ya Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya l'm tico, taco out of here.
fine! See you around, pet!
no, wait, wait. Come back!
you belong together!
you are Juliet to his Romeo!
sure, they both die in the end, but you get my point!
young love. Always so melodramatic.
all right, boys, go after her.
Blu! Come back here. Come on!
Yeah! l'm ready for Carnaval!
who wants to ride in my fruit.
you left without me.
that's messed up.
jewels! Jewels!

Yeah. l was just on my way to claw your eyes out!
jewel!
temper, temper.

we're going to a parade.
everybody loves a parade.
let go of me!
Hey! Get back here!
ain't nobody messing with a friend of Pedro, l ain't having it!
lt's on!
did you see the talons on that guy?
talons?
maybe it's on next time.
help! -Help! Little help!
Rafael, quit following me.
you're going in the wrong direction.
lsn't Carnaval that way?
l'm not going to Carnaval.
no, l'm going home.
but l thought you loved Carnaval.
l do. But l love my family much more.
and that's a choice l made with this.
not with this.
Blu! -Hey, Blu! Blu!
l was flying and then l saw this big cockatoo!
with big ninja talons!
this cockatoo was ugly! Anyway, that's not the point.
and then Jewel was there, and he snatched Jewel up.
like, he snatched her up. And then he was like, " You're coming with me, you little princess. "
and Jewel was like, " l ain't your princess, leave me alone. "
and l was like, " What? " -Then he was like, " What? "
stop! Just tell me what happened.
he got Jewel, man!
and he's taking her to the parade.
this is all my fault.
let's fly.
Carnaval, here we come!
Hey, dog, l'm drowning back here!

you have to go. Nigel...
Hello, pretty bird.
so kind of you to join our little soiree.

Yes. Well done, Nigel.

you shouldn't have done that. Come on.
just forget him ! get the birds!
they're getting away.
we'll see about that.
watch out!
we did it, boys.
Yes! We did it.
we're the best!
ls that a float?
Wow! Look at the detail on that thing.
pull up you, idiot! Pull up!
sorry, Eva, l'm not gonna be home for dinner.
what are you doing?
l'm gonna pop this cage open like a soda can.
now, that's popping!
hurry. We got to help the others.
l'm a pretty bird, l'm a pretty bird.

you just feel it happening
you won't find it anywhere else l love you, Rio!
what? -They don't need any help with that tune.
what's the matter, is it getting through to you?
by the way, the stage got off all right.
I watched it clear through the valley.
in about six days the marshal will get here.
that's what I figured.
the girl wasn't on the stage.
I know that.
tell her she could stay?
no, she...
Yes, I did. What about it?
nothing, nothing at all.
you were going to say something.
I remembered in time.
I remembered another girl came through on a stage that stopped over.
I remember you told me she was no good.
I didn't believe you, but you were right.
so, naturally I figured you're an expert.
and you know just what you're doing all the time.
I just hope you have better luck than I had.
you know, that's the first time I've been able to laugh about that.
maybe there's some hope for me yet.
maybe.
but I doubt it.
that's what I like about you, you're such an encouraging man.
if you go by the hotel, pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?
Joe complaining?
him? He didn't get no sugar.
his coffee's water poured over the old grounds.
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.
before I forget, your gun's a little stiff. You mind if I file the action a bit?
I don't want you to file no action on my gun.
I don't want no easy pull. I might shoot myself. Get somebody else's.
why don't you give him his own guns?
I forgot all about them. -Your memory is no better than mine.
they been locked up over a year except when you...
...took them out to clean them and oil them.
Where'd you get these?
bought them off the fellow you sold them to.
I don't know how to...
let's take a turn around the town. Get Stumpy his coffee.
ain't you going to tell me to get back in there?
no, stay out here and get shot.
I might do that just for spite.
might get a laugh out of you.
what I put up with for $30 a month.
feels good.
come on.
by the way, am I drawing pay?
same as before.
in that case take out what you gave for these guns.
no hurry.
if you're feeling so generous, I could use an advance.
buy a new pair of pants, new shirt. Something without all these holes in it.
no need of that.
when you lit out, you left some things behind.
I got them at the hotel.
you been keeping them all this time?
been waiting till they fit you again.
you could use a bath and a shave, too.
I don't know about the shave. I'm liable to cut my own throat.
chance?
yeah?
they'll fit.
Thanks.
there you are.
how about you, John T?
shall I work on you?
I do my own shaving.
I thought you did.
I was just reminding you.
sure buy a lot of drinks with that.
you sure could.
I'll let you keep it for me.
feathers, thanks for the shave. Might call on you again.
anytime, because I'll be here.
I didn't tell you, John T. Carlos is giving me a job.
good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy his coffee and things?
you in a hurry, John T? I'd like to talk to you.
I'll wait for you. -Thanks, Dude.
I just wanted to ask you-- -What's this about a job?
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well. Says I can help out downstairs.
tending bar?
among other things.
you think I shouldn't?
why ask me?
the way you said "tending bar.
all right, I won't do it. -I didn't say not to.
you don't like the idea.
why should it be up to me? Why should I care?
I don't know why you get mad when I ask you.
I'm not mad. -You're not?
you'd make anybody mad. -I suppose I would.
as long as you haven't anything against it, I'll take the job.
go ahead.
Thanks, I will.
what were you going to ask me?
never mind. You're in too bad a humor. -What were you going to ask?
whether you were going to sleep in the hotel tonight.
get one thing straight. There'll be no more chair-sitting outside this door.
I know. I've given that up.
anyway, I have a better idea. Tonight you sleep in my room.
anyone looking wouldn't look there first.
you'd have more time if anything did happen.
besides, I have a rocking chair, it's more comfortable.
just an idea. You can think about it.
when you're in a little better humor.
chance!
the shot came from the jail.
chance, look out!
don't go in there.
that idiot just took a shot at me.
Stumpy! You all right?
sure I am, but there's a feller out there with a black hat that ain't.
and I'm that fellow.
coming in.
look what he did to my hat.
stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.
dude? I didn't know. Didn't look like Dude.
fool almost blowed my head off.
how'd I know it was you?
you get yourself dolled up like Astor's pet horse...
...and then stick your nose in that door and don't say nothing.
look at this hat.
if you hadn't ducked, that's what your head would look like.
I never would have fired if I knew it was you.
okay, I know, just stop talking, will you?
the shot didn't bother me. I've been shot at before.
you could have hollered.
just 'cause you get cleaned up don't mean you can't talk.
it's my fault. I should have yelled. I shouldn't have taken a bath.
just stop talking. Just let it be.
you been going around for years like something the cat dragged in...
...and now you expect-- -Shut up!
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.
don't let me tell you again.
you're getting a little touchy, aren't you?
I've been listening to that old fool talk until I'm...
all right, I'm wrong.
that old fool is talking because he nearly killed you.
he's the one that's scared.
we've been pampering you too much.
you better get some sleep.
you know, he acts like I done it on purpose. And I didn't.
you see that door there?
that look like I done it on purpose?
it's going to get cold here at night.
and I'm going to leave it get cold. Because I ain't going to fix that door.
it weren't my fault.
were it?
I know.
I'll fix the door.
Hi, Sheriff.
how do you like your new job?
they've been keeping me pretty busy.
you through for the day? Going to bed?
I thought I would.
can I make you some coffee? -No thanks.
anything to eat? -Nope.
how about a drink?
I'll take a drink.
Carlos says this is for special guests.
tired, aren't you, John T?
I can fix you a nice hot bath.
all I want is that drink.
then, this is all I can do for you?
I thought you said I could think about it.
you're right. I did.
put it on the tab.
in case you make up your mind, I left my door open.
get a good night's sleep.
you're not helping me any.
good morning, Dude.
good morning.
have a good night?
all right, I guess.
eat anything?
this morning?
stumpy fixed something.
I asked you a question. You didn't answer it.
all right, I'll answer you. I didn't sleep good...
...didn't eat anything. I had a beer and it didn't do any good.
think you can stand your watch?
when I can't do that I'll let you know.
that's enough. -Yeah.
Where's his hat?
get out there. We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.
stumpy, did dude have a bad night?
he's suffering "thunderation," Chance.
his mind's just beginning to work again, and he sees what he done to himself.
ain't pretty.
he's got to sweat it out.
and don't let him cry on your shoulder either.
he ain't done it yet.
why are you so god darned ornery? Always picking on Dude.
you got any tobacco? -No, I give the last there was to Dude.
he uses it up fast. You got to get some for yourself.
but what I'm asking you is why are you picking on Dude?
all right, be nice to him and he'll fall apart in small pieces.
maybe you're right. You know him better than I do.
I guess some folks is built that way. But that wouldn't work with me.
you could at least have a kind word for me now and then.
considering what I have to do around here.
the sweeping, and the cooking, and the "nursemaiding" that killer back there.
not even a "thank you" do I get.
maybe you're right, Stumpy.
you're a treasure.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
go back to being yourself.
leastwise I'm used to that.
he's coming down the street now.
good morning, Sheriff.
Colorado.
I been hearing a lot of talk. Thought you might be interested.
about what?
mostly about you telling Burdette what would happen to Joe...
...if trouble started around the jail.
guess he didn't expect to hear that. Kind of new to me, too.
would you have said it any different? -No.
if he was doing to me what he's doing to you, I'd tell him the same thing.
he can't take a chance on whether you'd do it or not.
I don't suppose so.
but you can be sure he's going to try it a different way.
got enough left there for another?
sure. Help yourself.
you always keep that carbine cocked?
only when I carry it.
how come you carry a rifle?
I found some were faster than me with a short gun.
I don't suppose you have a match either?
all out of them, too.
I'll get some.
sheriff, we ran into some trouble on the road.
ai here is hurt. His horse threw him.
your deputy said we could find a doctor.
round the corner.
about three or four doors to the right.
stay away from that rifle, Sheriff.
you can see we've still got our guns.
that ain't your deputy up the street.
unloosen that belt.
what've you done to him? -Don't worry about him.
worry about yourself. He's all right.
he ain't going to be and nor are you unless you do as you're told.
stay back here.
we're going down to the jail.
you'll turn Joe Burdette loose...
...or you and your deputy quit worrying about this whole thing.
take your choice.
are you just going to stand here?
if you want to get him shot, just go out there.
what'll it be?
if you want to do something, when I get out on the porch...
...Take that flowerpot and throw it through the window.
duck after you throw it.
just keep coming, mister.
who, me? -Yes, you.
grab that horse.
colorado, where's he going? -He's going to see if Dude's all right.
chance, over here.
you look a little used.
What'd they do? I heard shooting.
they had me cold.
going to make me open the jail.
what happened?
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.
if you'd have had him here, this wouldn't have happened.
I can get up by myself!
I let them get me.
I let them walk right up and stick my head in the water trough...
...and it was easy for them.
I'm good when I'm sober, boy, real good.
I should have known better.
a man ought to have sense enough to know when he's no good no more.
Where're you going? -Get your hands off of me.
I said where're you going?
you've got no use for a man you can't depend on.
one bad night and I'm done for.
an old man takes a pot shot at me and I'm finished.
I tried and I tried hard, and where did it get me?
look at me.
I got them so bad.
what can a man do with hands like that?
I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.
all right, quit.
nobody's trying to stop you.
if you want to quit, quit.
go on back to the bottle, get drunk!
one thing, though.
somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon, don't expect me to do something about it.
just get down on your knees and go after it.
I'm sorry.
sorry" don't get it done, Dude.
that's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again.
maybe you're right.
maybe you aren't much good anymore.
here are your guns.
fellow that took your hat must have left this.
you get something out of it.
now come on down to the jail, and I'll give you the money you got coming.
I think this is your horse.
Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.
I guess Dude's all right.
anyway, he's walking.
I'm so glad.
I was afraid.
my stomach seems...
come on, maybe a drink will help.
go on up to the jail and wait for me there.
tell Stumpy to give you a drink.
what do you wish me to do with this three dead men?
you're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.
there's another one down by the bridge. Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.
no need for that.
each one of them had two new $50 gold pieces in his pocket.
price is going up.
what?
nothing, Bert.
bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.
it will be done.
here is your gun.
thank you, Carlitos.
Where's Colorado?
he's inside the hotel. He took the girl Feathers.
better give me another, Colorado.
Yes, ma'am.
look at me, Colorado, take a good look.
would you say my head is soft? Would you say I'm an idiot?
no, ma'am.
you'd be a liar then.
better go easy on that stuff.
that makes three you've had. -Yep.
you'd be lying because that's what I am.
a softheaded idiot.
there isn't any other explanation for staying around here...
...and inviting myself into this. He told me...
Hi, Sheriff.
we saw you coming back. Dude was all right, wasn't he?
he's all right. So am l, thanks to you.
thank the lady here. -Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.
she threw a flowerpot through the window and helped get three men killed.
or was it four?
why did you make me do it?
I made you do it? -Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?
he wasn't going to do what those men told him.
not him.
you were just going to get yourself killed, that's all.
somebody had to
what were you going to do, Sheriff?
I'm glad I didn't have to make up my mind.
you weren't going down to that jail.
so somebody had to help you.
but you don't want anybody to do that, do you?
you're right, you didn't make me help you.
it was my own idea.
it was my idea to stay. You told me to get on that stage.
I know you did.
I'm glad you didn't.
what?
I'm glad you didn't go.
What'd you have to say a thing like that for?
you know, just when we get one thing settled you have to go bring up another.
you just don't make any sense, that's all.
and neither do l.
and neither do you, Colorado. What're you doing in this?
you don't have the excuse that I have.
I better go before I make a fool of myself.
I don't know why I should go, though, because we're all fools.
we ought to get along very well together, all of us.
I'm going, anyway.
we're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.
just a bunch of idiots.
how did she get mixed up in this?
she didn't feel too good.
she had a couple of drinks. -I don't mean this. I mean out there.
she was going outside to help you. How, I don't know. And neither did she.
I told her to throw that pot through the window and I went out instead.
and that's your reason for throwing in with me.
she's right. It doesn't make any sense.
Wheeler just talked about helping me.
but you saved my neck.
Burdette isn't going to kiss you for that.
so you're in.
don't tell me you didn't think about that. Before you did it, I mean.
if I'm going to get shot at, I might as well get paid for it.
how do I get a badge?
come on, I'll get you one.
I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.
I'm sorry for that. But I figure why is not my business.
you've got peculiar ways of choosing what is your business.
you telling me they was going to bring Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?
why, they're crazy.
God darn fools.
chance brings in three strangers, tells me to unlock the door...
...what do they think I'm going to do? You know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to start blasting.
Where'd you get that hat?
chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.
for a what?
stumpy, we're coming in. -Well, come ahead.
see, he ain't too proud to yell.
stumpy, where do you keep the deputy sheriff badges?
in the right-hand drawer there.
you know where that book is, the one with the oath?
No! lf you can't take care of your own truck don't look for me to do it.
we'll have to do without it. Raise your right hand.
do you solemnly swear to take on the duties of a sheriff's deputy
found yourself another knot-head who don't know when he's well off?
...in the County of Presidio of the great State of Texas?
I do.
and that includes taking orders from me.
all right, Sheriff. How about giving me one.
get over to the hotel and pick up your stuff.
move in here.
what are you laughing about?
what I got myself in for.
cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?
how good do you think he is? -He's all right.
you think he's as good as Wheeler said he was?
he threw me my gun and while it was in the air, he got one of them.
then he got another one. -Good enough.
is he as good as I used to be?
it'd be pretty close.
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.
then you got the best of it. Him for me.
what's he talking about, him for me?
nobody never tells me nothing around here.
he's quitting.
what's got into you?
look at me. Ain't that pretty?
shaking worse all the time.
what can a man do with hands like that? Tell me, what?
take a drink! You said Chance told you to. You did, didn't you, Chance?
he can take the whole bottle.
go ahead.
stumpy.
don't close it.
didn't spill a drop.
shakes are gone...
...just because of a piece of music.
till they played that piece, I forgot how I got into this thing.
keep on playing it, I don't think I'll ever forget again.
chance, give me another shot at it...
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.
you heard him.
bring it out, put it back. Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.
I ain't going to wait for them to ask me, because I do.
you two are enough to drive a man to it.
I think I'll go watch the road again.
unless you need me for something else.
did you forget this?
you could clean up a little.
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.
I'm better than I look.
I'll do that tonight.
if you think of it, send me some food. I think I could eat something.
nothing in his stomach.
nothing but guts.
you can quit worrying about him and start thinking about me.
we know about him, he's going to be all right, but I ain't.
that got my goat. I can't watch a man get down.
Where're you going?
to get Dude something to eat. And you'd better
I know, get back in my hole.
no, you'd better watch out for Colorado when he comes back.
I forgot to tell him how trigger-happy you are.
we get a good man, he has to watch you to keep from getting shot full of holes.
close the window!
still talking about that little accident last night.
never can satisfy him.
that's real pretty. Go on, play some more.
why don't you play something I can sing with you?
good one.
that's nice. Ain't it, Chance?
it's better than being out in the street and getting shot at.
I can't argue with you.
you're right, Stumpy. -Right about what?
I should have thought of it before. -Thought about what?
burdette's shown his hand. He isn't going to rush this jail.
everything he's tried has been outside.
we could sit here and wait for the marshal.
only be three or four days.
how much food you got, Stumpy? Enough for all of us?
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.
water and firewood? -Filled up this morning.
we do need some blankets and tobacco, and matches.
less you got plenty. -He ain't.
and a few bottles of beer, Dude? -Thanks, Stumpy.
there's another thing now...
...if we're all going to be in here three or four days, close together like...
...it might be a good idea if a certain party, not to mention no names was to...
...do what he said he'd do.
a horse barn's a good place but it ain't a place for a fellow to roll around in.
all right, Stumpy.
me, I like roses, but this fellow ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.
I'm going to take a bath. I said I would.
dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.
I was just a wondering when.
he'll keep talking till we get out of here.
I'll take a bath while you gather up the stuff.
yell when you get back, because you look different when you're clean.
how you do that?
it's easy, Carlos. You just weren't watching.
Carlos, open up.
coming.
buenas tardes, Senor Chance. I think it is best to lock the door.
Carlos, I'm sleeping over at the jail tonight. All of us are.
we'll need some blankets, plenty of tobacco, and matches.
and some beer, too. -Feeling better?
much better.
that's all you need? -That's all.
when you get the stuff together, let us know. I'll be upstairs.
now don't make any noise.
open your mouth.
Hi, Feathers.
have you got any soap that smells like roses?
I have some soap, but it doesn't smell like a rose.
won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.
who's Stumpy?
the fellow that likes roses.
no, he watches the jail.
hurry it up.
right away.
Yeah, what's all this about moving down to the jail?
something I should have done two or three days ago.
are you sorry you didn't?
are you?
I know an easy way of telling you.
can't you talk plainer than that?
chance, give me a towel.
I'm busy.
What'd you say?
somebody's telling me something.
I can't-- Give me a towel, will you?
he's a big help.
I'll finish telling you later.
the Dude went in to take a bath.
I couldn't see, but I don't think he has his guns.
the sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl. He has his gun.
I don't want to go up and get him.
Burdette wants him alive. -Then don't talk so loud.
he'll come charging here with that rifle and we'll have to kill him.
that might just work. -What?
the stairs are pretty dark.
we stretch a rope across them. Let him hear something.
give me that piece of rope. Come on, give me a hand.
hurry it up, will you?
be right out.
if you're leaving, I might as well get some sleep.
I don't suppose I could come by the jail once in a while...
...and see if you needed anything. -I don't want you anyplace around there.
I was afraid of that.
that means I won't see you for three or four days.
that's a long time, you know.
you'll live through it.
Yeah, you do the same.
all right, you both better get out there. You, too, Pedro.
leave the door open a little.
get the gag out of her mouth.
now, lady, we want you to call the sheriff down here.
No! No!
maybe this'll help.
please don't. Don't!
he's out cold. Get upstairs, quick!
hold it, Dude.
watch him.
just keep coming, lady.
all right, everybody, downstairs.
all right, get on your feet.
come on, get up!
can you walk?
Where're we going?
that's up to you.
we go to the jail and you let Joe go.
or we tuck you two away and make a trade with Stumpy.
take your choice.
you won't make any deal with Stumpy.
you'll just get Joe killed. -Not if he knows we got you two.
they got us. We're licked.
go on, take them over to the jail, and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.
are you out of your mind? -I'm telling you to do it now.
stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got water or food and he's all alone.
nobody to get him any water. Now go on, do it.
do you know what you're saying? -I do.
I'm thinking good, too. Now do what I tell you.
and then after they get Joe, what happens?
all we want is Joe.
you still think it's a good idea? -I still think it's good.
we'll go over to the jail.
take the shells out of his gun.
I unloaded his pistol.
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.
now look, Sheriff, we're going out of here natural like.
you carry your gun and don't do anything to make anybody...
...think something is wrong.
if you have to explain to Stumpy, tell him we put up bail for Joe.
burdette's got it figured out pretty good.
if it was up to me, you'd have never got up off the floor.
some of those you killed were friends of mine.
give him his rifle.
you first.
hold it.
yell to Stumpy you're coming in. We've been watching you.
stumpy, this is Chance.
it took you long enough.
Steve, cover from out here.
all right, open up. We're going to let Joe go.
how come?
his friends here put up bail.
give me the keys then. They're on your desk there.
I forgot.
easy.
this fellow will talk all right. -Watch him. I'm going after Dude.
you go along with him. I'll watch him.
now watch yourself.
there's two of them holding Dude.
the window.
all right, Colorado.
in here.
they're gone.
they took Dude when they heard the shooting.
they went out the back door. They had horses. I heard them.
they've gone all right.
we going to go after them?
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen if he came after his brother.
you ought to remember that.
you thought it was funny.
what do you think he'd do if we went after Dude?
I didn't think.
think the shoe's on the other foot now.
the men who took Dude, they were very angry.
they say Dude set a trap for them.
he sent them over there, all right.
he knew what he was doing. Knew what stumpy would do, too.
that's why they're not happy about it.
What're you going to do?
it's what Burdette will do.
Carlos. Get a hold of Burdette.
I don't care how. Tell him I want to talk to him.
tell him to set the time and the place. But I want to talk to him.
we'll be at the jail.
aren't you sorry now you didn't get on the stage?
come on, Colorado.
let's wake up the Chinaman again.
it's me, Carlos.
what's the matter? What'd he say?
he say he don't want to talk to you.
he say if you want Dude back, he'll make a trade.
a trade?
dude for Joe.
he'll be in his place over by the creek.
warehouse?
he'll be there half an hour after sunup.
he'll have Dude. If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.
he said to let him know.
tell him we'll be there.
you're crazy! You can't do that!
not even if Dude was your own brother.
what can I do?
what we figured on doing. Hole up till the marshal comes.
when the marshal takes Joe, what'll happen to Dude?
dude knew what he was in for when he sent you over here.
I'd like to add my two cents worth, Sheriff.
go ahead.
from what I hear, you and Dude are the only witnesses.
let's say that we're the only ones that'll talk.
after Nathan gets Joe back, he's still got to live here.
which means you two can't, and if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?
the brakes'll be off then.
that ought to be as plain as the nose on your face.
you're right, Colorado.
but you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.
I don't think he'll bother you two.
I'm not worried. -Me neither.
you'll just wait for the marshal to come.
he's still going to want you and Dude. -I'd say so.
you can't get out of town because he's got it bottled up.
when you make the trade then Burdette's going to get both of you.
after a little argument.
but why at all? Why the both of you? -Dude ought to have a chance.
he won't get one the other way. Will he?
will he?
you're going to have me crying.
fellow's got to be a drunk to get anywhere around here. I might as well start now.
go ahead, Carlos.
burdette's here.
about time to go.
how about I go ahead, see if they'll play any tricks?
look out here.
we're drawing quite a crowd.
there won't be any tricks. At least not till we make the trade.
besides, you're not going.
when you decided to make the trade for Dude, I went along with you.
I'm going along now.
Why?
just say I'd like a closer look.
up to now I thought you were smart. Stumpy, you're not going.
why ain't I going? Give me one good reason why?
I'll give you one.
you've done a good job in here because you haven't had to move around much.
but out there if anything happens, you'll have to move, and move fast.
I'd feel better if you weren't there.
it's plain enough. Old cripples ain't wanted.
you give me a reason.
do you want that I should bring Joe out, or do you want to do that yourself?
bring him out.
I think I'll take along a rifle, some extra shells.
I told you I'd get out of here.
open your mouth again and we'll carry you out.
see you, Stumpy.
see you.
that's far enough, Joe.
through the barn.
just sit down over there on those grain sacks.
you want a closer look?
this is close enough.
take that window.
watch Joe.
we're ready.
Joe's here.
we're ready, too.
start Dude.
I'll start Joe.
go ahead.
all right, Joe.
you can start walking very slow.
and stop if I say stop...
...or I'll stop you.
bring him out.
go ahead.
slow.
look out!
do you want me to go help Dude?
he'll take Joe all right.
he's got a strange way of doing it.
he'll take him.
you're right. He did.
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.
he can't walk, but I can drag him.
stay right where you are.
we'll throw you a gun.
I'll do it. I'm closer.
wait till we start shooting, Dude, then make a grab for it.
let's make a little noise, Colorado.
that ought to start something.
it will.
on your left!
two of them made it to that shack.
if they get across that creek, we'll be in bad shape.
they'll get behind us.
I don't know how we're going to stop them from here.
is that who I think it is?
old Stumpy.
the fellow I left behind.
don't shoot, it's me.
Carlos, what are you doing here?
I bring you some more shells. You might need them.
who'll turn up next?
maybe the girl with another flowerpot.
chance, Stumpy sitting in a bad place. That wagon's got dynamite in it.
I go tell him.
you stay here. I'll go get him.
give me those shells.
stumpy, get out of there.
no. Come on, I got a front seat. It's a good one.
you got a good seat, all right.
that's wagon's full of dynamite.
jumping Jehoshaphat.
why don't nobody never tell me nothing?
get away from that wagon or you won't be around to hear anything.
stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?
what do you think I'm doing? Taking a siesta?
I brought us some dynamite.
that's a good idea.
let's get farther away from that wagon.
can you shoot as good as you say you can?
can you throw? -Near as far as you can shoot.
we'll find out. Get that box open.
dude!
over here.
get ready.
let it go!
that was a good one.
stop cackling.
get one a little farther out there.
there you go again.
what would you do if I wasn't throwing them for you?
I'd throw them myself.
Yeah, I guess you would at that. You ready?
let it go.
dude, how do you like them apples?
that's all right.
throw one for me.
go ahead, but throw it harder this time.
there you go again. You never can satisfy you.
throw it.
here you are, Dude.
took you two.
I didn't allow for the wind.
can't you throw them any farther?
I can if you want to blow the whole place down.
that's the general idea. Throw it!
don't shoot. We've had enough.
that got them. That took the fight out of them.
look at them quit.
sure is quiet out there.
find anything?
there isn't a Burdette man left in town outside those who got locked up.
rest of them all cleared out. We won't have any trouble.
you're welcome.
thank you.
what do you want to do about them?
want to take them to Presidio or wait for the marshal?
we'll wait for the marshal. -Wait for the marshal?
I'm glad you agree, since you have to cook for them and watch them.
that ain't the way I said it. I said, "Wait for the marshal?
and that's a question.
I'm fed up feeding them, and I ain't going to watch them.
I've been sitting back there so long in the dark that I feel...
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl or something.
when I went outside, couldn't hardly see in the daylight.
I'll watch it for you if you want to go out.
would you? -Sure.
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside, it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.
I don't think it would.
maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me either.
I don't think it would.
should I go?
go ahead.
go ahead.
you ain't going to give me a argument? -No.
don't care whether I go or not.
chance.
have you seen that girl yet?
I said, "Have you seen that girl yet?
the job.
didn't have time.
the Fort Worth stage is in. They run at night.
should be leaving soon.
you mean she's going on it? -I don't know.
I don't think you do either.
but if it was me, I'd find out.
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.
she might be leaving and she might not.
she might need help making up her mind.
but you're the expert.
I, I don't know anything about women.
next thing you'll be telling me you don't remember one.
a man forgets.
sometimes it isn't easy.
something happens, he just forgets.
in case you're interested, I have.
I don't even want a drink.
it's about time.
I was getting awful tired of taking care of you.
if you want to jump in, I'll take care of you.
what is this now? You're going to take care of him.
tell me about it. -Sheriff's got himself a girl.
shut up.
we ain't going to go through that again?
you going to do the same thing Dude done?
keep still. -Why don't somebody tell me these things?
where you going?
let him go, Stumpy.
no fooling, has the sheriff got himself a girl?
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.
she got him on the run? -She sure has.
I can just see him.
laying down the law to her.
I told you to get back in there!
and then getting told off himself.
everything is all right?
I am so happy. -Thank you, Consuelo.
you look for the girl?
she's in there.
no got time.
Hi, John T.
just a second while I get my shoe tied.
there.
it's all over, isn't it, John T?
Where'd you get those things?
I wore them the last place I worked.
why are you wearing them now?
tonight's a big night.
Consuelo thought a little entertainment might help.
I'm going to do a song.
you need a rig like that to sing?
you haven't heard me sing.
my legs aren't so bad. Consuelo thought these tights might help.
but you don't like them.
I didn't say that. -You don't want me to wear them.
I didn't say that either.
is it because they show so much of me? -They certainly do that.
you're a stubborn man, John T.
sometimes I know what you're thinking.
and other times...
you just can't make up your mind about me, can you?
you like what you see.
you like kissing me. You like what you touch.
but you decided in the beginning what kind of a girl I was.
and I haven't helped much.
I wore these before I met you.
I wanted you to know it.
to know what kind of a girl you were getting.
I wanted you to get that funny look on your face and tell me not to wear them.
but it didn't work.
you didn't even get mad.
I told you once you wouldn't have to say anything.
that I'd know, but I don't know.
so, you're going to have to talk.
I'm hard to get, John T.
you're going to have to say you want me.
Where're you going? -Downstairs.
you'd better not.
why had I better not?
because I'm still sheriff.
you wear those things in public, I'll arrest you.
John T.
I've waited so long for you to say that.
I thought you were never...
you have the funniest way of saying things.
just when I think you're going to say one thing
get those darn things off. I'll wait outside.
no, you don't have to go. I can use this screen.
besides I want you to stay here...
...because the other thing is all over now, isn't it?
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.
what I had to go through!
put on these tights, ask a lot of questions...
...start to walk out. I thought you were never going to say it.
say what?
that you loved me.
I said I'd arrest you.
it means the same thing, you know that. You just won't say it.
we're different. I'll have to get used to you.
I, I just talk all the time.
you most certainly do.
you'll get used to that. You'll have to.
either that or start talking, too.
tell me something.
these tights, now why didn't you want me to wear them?
because I didn't want anybody but me to see you in them.
I like that.
you're getting better already.
shall I save them and wear them just for you?
do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff? -Not unless you mind your own business.

the huliis second ...
manuai, manuai, manuai, manuai
it is not because matter that I already passed by
but it is because matter that I am about to face
because today
they are your legs, but in all aspects a certain
you will lose them
can you cure it
an arrangement for can seeing destiny
but the in case dided not get to cure
always like this
always like this
who also can't tell you that what should they do
you this appearance who also do not know, he should say that is good
your husband is very optimistic
this means what
mean that does his account ability undertakes the all these
then he eeds to work hard
then fantasize a certain I recovered from illness it can stand up
then fall flops again
become again a heap of discards .
this is what I fear
I say with you that this is because you are a social righteousness work
two year ago I thought the dead
but I still live at last to come down
but I can't suffer any further now
I can not stand any further
this shouldn't be my life
does your husband know
I am not clear
he will know
the huliis second to fear is a very mighty weapon
fear the freedom that capture the person the decision oneself destiny
this is your fear to tell me
perhaps later on, you can be stronger because of fear
you have to face to fear
you support people who suiside
no
you think that I am to say that if who have problems, he had better commit suicide?
is not such
what our support is the person's freedom
rare freedom with the freedom of the dead
that is different
this kind of ? it is all right to do not say this
I think only of to let you liking again like want
the thunder receive to let me giving you to this
if the another day think chat to come right away to seek me with me
she was how
very good
OK? I think she is OK
it is very happy to see you

the huliis second, what's the matter with you
there is a reason letting me descend to settle the determination
I want that only have to face the person of the of same race circumstances with me
just understand I pain and sufferings of the hellish sort
I know now that you just deserve to live in my hell
you are different from others
her sharing together and equal of the felling is worthy
write to order the silly talk coming to comforting her now
these are silly
I am to say that this person is a writer
I can make of just give her the help, Habier will sometimes replace the paper for me
in addition life here a the layer is constant habier continues for watch the television the game worry
only have this is they would come to here together
a lot of friends come, this month
some people 25 in the last years always at celebrate this festival
his gross will let go of the work in the hand in advance
they share my story
that girl
I miss that he found out the free space here
the business disappoints her
sorting clothes
now they are quarreling
because the manuai is used to everything for the others
but, she participate in, the result is
the manuai pulls to manage my my small room
until you can return to here
why
seeing this is what
the life is not what like thisover
no, we should say that
the life is not such period where?
no
this changes to grow the tone like this
there is euphonic here seeing here
the death is my the friend of to stir the number,
if throw away the comma
sometimes the tone is what concealment
why don't you talk
you should notice the distinction, know
like has better comprehension in talent
your in case always like this I prefer to you what do not
take a pen for me
take a pen for me
is it all right to much pay attention to order ratio
no matter
dear thunder
excuse me, I packed me the computer when you gave me letters
I am diligent to recover my leg
they say soon I can walk
although they think that I can't continue with your legal case
at recover from illness there is numerous new apparatus in its house
sometimes I will imagine oneself's elephant you are similar
fly to cross Barcelona
I flew to the seaside
has been flying the ...Until see such pure ocean I did not see
I imagine you are too similar from the section from Ronnie
perhaps take a tour around the world again
it's better for us to meet at somewhere again
I think I short for ego with the freedom
particularly my husband
he looks at my everything
but sometimes I do not like to become the sloth
but I can accept to do not have no his method in addition
I hope that I can see you in a few months
I will let a friend help you write a book
stop writing now
embrace each other you your friend
I know that huliis second what is the row I know early
if I were you, I won't do that
that we are continuously to like hard still abandon like this
the thunder can not stand other people's comments
do you understand?
the gossip language is continuously
because the news always spreads more quick than what
do you know? Now only have I can receive to do to order what for the thunder
I want to share for you I do not quarrel with you bacause of that
all right I is not because of you to receives what to conflict with the thunder like this
paralyzing the patient thunder receives. Wear virtuous request the happy and dead resort
because the reason shortage rejects in court
the judge puts forward to request the mercy killing the first appearing in the section the benefit is second
but not in Barcelona
as for this case, many people announced opinion
also come out the speech
the thunder sasy that he does not want to be alive
I do not know his realistic circumstance
but this caused our whole society to concern people surrounded him
death, from reverse side, is for the sake of better exist to relax
his friend and his family
can not become intimate or help him
complete nonsense
but what we make sureis that
what Thunderneed need is more love
I want to see him very much
I want to have a chat with him
I want to tell that him have ten million a reason for lively descending going to
why don't you go to school
you are happy now
you are happy
your famili members are all on television
you should be like this, you should be like that
as duck that were chased after
why don't your father speak
I want to emphasize that
father has nothing to do with this
what do you want to do
now all people are talking about us
do we still have quiet and peaceful days
have you thought for us
you only think of dying
hearing me, hear me say
this is your biggest wishes
hear I say a minute
do not say that, you do not draw conclusion to me
have you ever thought
had to think
what I bear
you have your own family
you have that family, work and father
you need to pay the old age pension for him
but I am different
to me the, on the hoof is the most difficult matter
one thing I have to say clarity with you
that is the most important
only I am on the hoof, I would make decision by me
do you like to me to remember, do you know
I came downstairs
just leave, father
I open door
good evening, I come and see Thunder
but you do not know how late it is now
I know, but I can not come early
I will explain with Thunder
I think that nobody will welcome you now
very late, why dn't you come tomorrow or day after tomorrow
this is very important
the research has been canceled
they no longer took care of this matter
no one can pay them
all of them walked
good heavens, this did not make sense, did not make sense
do not cry
sorry
nothing
I can be with a clear conscience
they started begging for the money now
a lot of people all think that this is not reasonable
I do not like comments by people
I will get angry if you do that
but you gave me the fine wishes
I want that do to somrthing for you
because this is in the world, thunder, can you imagine
there is never a man who is similar to you
I never do so bad to a woman
I do not want to ca like that
I can't trouble you again
you do not like the sentimentalist
I can not like men
this time said so for the first time
you say that I am a woman of failure
I have said
I say now that you are a strong woman
brave woman
docile
beautiful
people who says you are stupid is stupid
you did what to get to release
it can feel that
you will let me cannot stand tempetation
sit there
I still do not know that the woman can wake my consciousness up
my son says that you pretended
you pretended to here nothing
but can you, can't you
I really hope to help you
what matter I would like to help you
do you will help me
yes
you can not shrink back
sure, several year ago, I think
no one can accept this matter
a few friends say that after helping me all shrunk back
only a few friends are strong persons like you
insists down
I just help you the live
rather than help you commit suicide
OK, young men
we go to there
made an effort
to make an effort, like this
we cannot pass here
can not go up here
can not go up
thank
the thunder is uncomfortable today, so he refused interviews
all right
that's all right
come here
you go upstairs
you say that to thunder as such
when we are in mother's womb
life and death root are not to be controlled by oneself
but when we arrive in the world
we are own hosts
we have the duty to exist
but you have to know
the faith of church decides your personal life ownership
but this is impossible
why impossible
I said with you
my life decides my faith
his life
not his faith decides in his life
But.You tell him
sir, God believes life is worthy
why the church opposes dying like this
death is a part of the life of his religion follower
just from world to the first step of the Kingdom of Heaven
he says that the problem is not on the body
but is the Spanish morals ethic
OK, good
you tell him ethical problem is not a slope
why most German
most German
all support Hitler
compare me with Hitler
why are you sweating

tendril

I am to say
dignified dying
I do not think it has different things
you say so
according to you, I kill myself and everything finished, that is different
this is different
you put premium on liffe rather than me
if you want I think so
from today, you only think of dead

positive if you say of
your circumstance is similar to me
is not
don't you are crazy about freedom
thunder, my friend

on the hoof is not only move the arm
you can run in front of other people

to liveis a power but not a duty
not anyone supports you
who will wish to be killed
the thunder
you are the first in Spain
want to look for the vital person in abdication in mercy killing
put forward such public litigation from the first time
carry out to the beginning
have been over a lot of year
you think that how judge sees
your will say what with them
I will tell them my spirit have no the trouble
solemnly silent
please solemnly silent
according to the constitution
everyone contains not summit to penalty in power and molestation
everyone can announce verdict
can decide own life and death
in fact, if who try to commit suicide or on the hoof
can't change
but when a person must ask for help of other people's
then he can live better
so this kind of life and death is decided by other people's person
lose vital right in oneself
please each judge to this case
do not want from superficial from the religious meaning to come up the judgment
so I plead the judge to announce verdict this case as a non-church case
here I plead the everyone
give my the party concerned a legal verdict
a rational judgment
now here, law court top
the thunder hopes to read for everyone
request to be invalid
my party wants everyone hear his own standpoint
you understand the legal procedure as us
certainly, I am very clear
but plead the judge and then give me three minuteses in the party concerned
illustrate his viewpoint

he have worked hard for 28 years for this
if you want to change the legal procedure
then change first the law all

somewhat, that is impossible
especially a person who insists ego
what do you mean, thunder

so get married with you
I can't give you happiness as a normal
certainly you can
Yes, but

Hey! Jo fri - Off, jo friday.
Jane, what are you doing? - Why'd you give the dog our burgers?
you want food? Go hunt and gather, all right?
okay, if that's a pizza, i'm sorry for anything I have ever done, especially, tommy, when I locked you out of the house and pretended like I didn't know who you were.
did she really do that? - Still crying over it.
daddy.
so, you gonna invite your old man in, or what?
level of decomposition suggests she's been here for at least two days.
she's still not picking up. - She does have a personal day.
still... This is the first case they're working together since the shooting.
look at this.
professional frenemies? Cop shoots medical examiner's mob father.
Sheesh. That's bad.
Jane didn't have a choice.
paddy would have pulled the trigger on us.
you and I know that, but how would you feel if I shot your father?
my father's not a mobster.
you having a hot flash?
your cologne not working for you today?
the medical community is debating if men go through menopause.
you could be experiencing a decrease in testosterone.
I got plenty of testosterone.
how about you, Frost?
love the smell of deco in the morning.
Ooh, maggots like it, too. Look here.
steam from the pipes has accelerated decomposition.
you know, few students know about these old tunnels.
21/4 miles of them run beneath the university.
they were constructed to house steam pipes...
they should just apologize for whatever they said to each other in that cat fight.
cat fight"? Women hate that expression.
they do?
damn. So many new rules.
Hey, janie, you got any more chips?
can you believe the contract they gave this guy, huh?
calls himself a pitcher. Can't even throw the speed limit.
good one, Tommy.
Oh! What are you doing?
pilgrims lost 8-7. - Jane

I don't want you bullying your baby brother. - That doesn't work anymore, pop.
talk, tommy.
I introduced him... To lydia.
wait till you meet her.
you're divorced, so how do you plan on having this big catholic wedding?
Yeah, the church kind of frowns on that.
just some paperwork I got to fill out.
what kind of paperwork?
Oh, my god.
you're gonna try to get an annulment, aren't you?
janie, it's a piece of paper. It means nothing.
does ma know she didn't mean to have kids?
look, I have no desire to hurt your mother, all right?
she doesn't know, does she?
you haven't even had the guts to tell her.
so, I guess that makes us all bastards.
Hey. Where you been?
my father remembered he had a family and popped by.
Wow. My dad's a too.
no, I'm busy feeling sorry for myself.
now I got to feel sorry for you, too?
well, this'll cheer you up.

Rachel lawson, 25.
grad student in earth and planetary sciences.
now I feel sorry for her, too. Where's the body?
Where's the body? - It's down there.
how long she been there?
looked like a couple of days, but you could ask
relax, Frost. I'll ask Dr. Isles.
victim rented a car. It's parked outside. There's nothing in it.
here's the rental car agreement.
BCU campus car." She was a v. i. p.
she rented a car every weekend for the last 20 weeks?
Yeah, it's a lot of mileage. See?
maybe she was going home. - She's from boston.
she wasn't due to return the car until tomorrow.
well, where was she going, and why'd she come back early?
studies show that 5% to 7% of the male pop
hello... Detective rizzoli.
Hello, Dr. Isles.
well, I don't see any drag marks.
no. Lividity confirms that she was killed here.
she's passed through rigor.
so she's been dead at least 36 hours.
she's in workout clothes. What was she doing down here?
she was strangled.
thank you, doctor. I can see that.
looks like the weapon was a garrote. - Garrote.
gee, I would love a history lesson on the... garrote.
wouldn't you, frost?
well, it was most popular in the 17th century when it was used as a means of silent assassination by the thuggee cult in india.
well, let's be on the lookout for the thuggees.
what are those red patches?
urticaria. - Urticaria?
uh, maybe you'll know what this means.
the yucky red stuff is a rash.
thank you for clearing that up. - yes, that was a good explanation.
let's go.
you stay.
you have any idea what rachel was doing in the steam tunnels?
steam tunnels? What steam tunnels?
you have any idea what this is?
it was rachel's?
okay, let's take it with us.
uh, Where's her bedroom?
should I be worried?
in horror movies, they always get the roommate next.
the campus is on high alert, and there are campus police outside your apartment.
you'll be safe.
and here I thought I missed out on the whole "roommate bonding" thing.
Oh, what a relief
cruelty free cotton.
I hate it when people are mean to cotton.
and vegan shoes. Can you say "vugly"?
says the woman who's been wearing the same boots for the past two years.
Oh, snap!
okay, rachel had a "skinny" section and a "fat" section.
how do you know about "skinny-fat" clothes?
I've tried on all sizes.
Oh, snap again!
all right, what do we got here?
loofah, aloe vera toothpaste...
a crystal... - That's a deodorant.
how do you know?
told you - all sizes.
Oh, hello!
here's a sure way to keep the weight off.
cocaine.
Why?
why would somebody do this?
Rachel was the kindest person.
did rachel mention any problems she was having? Maybe with friends?
no. She was there to study environmental geology.
she was very dedicated.
she worked very hard.
was she seeing anyone? - no.
she wouldn't have talked to you about that.
Mr. Lawson, did you just come from a business trip?
no. Why?
your watch is set to a different time than your wife's.
are you separated?
Yeah.
did you tell rachel?
I told rachel I was leaving her mother...
when I brought her back to school after winter break.
that's when she started going down into the tunnels, isn't it?
we don't know why she was there.
why do you say that?
Rachel wasn't an only child.
she had an older sister.
Emily died when rachel was 7.
Rachel would go down into the basement.
she would sit there in the dark for hours.
when she was really suffering, she'd find a place...
it was my fault she was in those tunnels.
this may not be my place...
but this beautiful girl loved you both very much.
honor her by being kind to each other.
you just pulled a midnight. What, did you take another shift?
all this stuff with pop, i'd figured I'd at least make some overtime.
you talk to maura yet?
Frankie, I don't think we're ever gonna be friends again.
we just keep making it worse.
okay. Thank you. Yes.
dad hasn't told her? - no.
I ran a check on her. On lydia.
Frankie, you can't be doing that.
they watch stuff like that, all right?
What'd you find out? - You don't want to hear it.
no, I don't. Tell me everything.
she's 28 years old.
she's younger than us!
Hey, rizzoli. You got a minute? - Yes, sir.
Hey, frankie. - Hey. Lieutenant.
look, how we doing with that murdered bcu girl?
I'm getting a lot of heat from the brass.
parents are going nuts over there.
Yes, I haven't actually... Spoken to maura - Dr. Isles...
